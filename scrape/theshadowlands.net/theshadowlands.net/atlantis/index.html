Legend of Atlantis</font></font></font></i></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">The legend of Atlantis
has to be one of the oldest and most spellbinding of all the world's mysteries.
It has puzzled both skeptics and believers alike.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where exactly
was Atlantis and where is it now?&nbsp; What caused its destruction?&nbsp;
Exactly how advanced were the Atlanteans?&nbsp; I hope someday everyone
will know the answers to those questions.&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">Plato, a Greek philosopher,
gave us the first known account of Atlantis.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plato was said
to have lived from about 428 to 348 B.C.&nbsp; He was a student of Socrates.&nbsp;
After studying with Socrates, Plato opened up his own philosophy school.&nbsp;
There he began to write his philosophies in a play-type form.&nbsp; These
dialogues always featured Socrates as the main character.&nbsp; In the
dialogues Timaeus and Critias, he wrote about an amazing place called Atlantis.
In Critias, Plato wrote of Atlantis' architecture, engineering, and ceremonies
in great detail.&nbsp; Many people, even Plato's own students, thought
this place&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">was Plato's own
creation, but he argued that Atlantis was real, and filled with more splendors
than anyone could imagine.&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">All races share the
story of a great flood that destroyed an entire civilization.&nbsp; The
name Atlantis appears in various forms throughout the world.&nbsp; The
Canary Islands have a legend involving Atalaya.&nbsp; The Basques of Northern
Spain have Atlaintica.&nbsp; The Vikings told the tale of Atli.&nbsp; Northern
Africa called it Attala.&nbsp; The Aztecs have Aztl&aacute;n, and the North
American Indians called theirs Azatl&aacute;n.&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">Plato said Atlantis
was a large island in the Atlantic Ocean, somewhere west of the Pillars
of Hercules (the Rock of Gibraltar).&nbsp; This description has lead to
many people believing that Atlantis could have been the Aegean Island of
Thera (Santorini) which suddenly blew up.&nbsp; Atlantis was also identified
as part of an ancient series of land bridges that stretched across the
Atlantic and even out into the Pacific as far as New Zealand.&nbsp; Others
say that the Canary Islands are the tops of Atlantis' tallest mountains.&nbsp;
Some say that the Bermuda Triangle is the result of Atlantis sinking.&nbsp;
The discovery of&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">blue eyes and blondness
among some of Africa's Berbers soon led some people&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">to place Atlantis
in the Atlas Mountians of modern Morocco and Tunisia.&nbsp;&nbsp; Still
others claim that Atlantis was not even on this planet.&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">According to the
continental drift theory, all the continents fit together, like a jigsaw
puzzle.&nbsp; If you look at a map, you will see that the continents really
do fit together- with the exception of the USA in North America and Western
Europe.&nbsp; Could Atlantis be the missing piece?&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">According to Plato,
one of the best splendors of Atlantis was the palace compound located in
the heart of its capital. It was ringed by three canals. Plato remarked,
"As each king received it [the palace] from his predecessor, he added to
its adornment and did all he could to surpass the king before him, until
finally they made of it an abode amazing to behold for the magnitude and
beauty of its workmanship.&nbsp; The visitors passed through a wall of
brass, a wall of tin, and a wall of copper.&nbsp; White and black and red
stone quarried from the native rock."&nbsp; He also wrote that the wealth
they possessed&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">was so immense that
the like had never been seen before in any royal house, nor will ever easily
be seen again.&nbsp; This, of course, lead to Atlantis' destruction.&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">He stated that the
Atlanteans appeared to be superlatively fair and blessed, yet they were
filled with lawless ambition and power. The Atlanteans started valuing
material wealth above goodness-that's where they went wrong.&nbsp; Plato
said, "The portion of divinity within them was now becoming faint and weak
through being oftentimes blended with a large measure of mortality."&nbsp;
The Atlanteans were unable to bear the burden of their possessions. So,
"There occurred portentous earthquakes and floods, and one grievous day
and night befell them, when...the island of Atlantis...was swallowed up
by the sea and vanished."&nbsp; Plato doubted that any sign of the lost
land would ever be found. "The ocean at that spot, has now become impassable
and unsearchable." This&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">contributes to the
Bermuda Triangle theory above.&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">Even though it seems
that no one could survive such a tragedy, it is believed that many Atlanteans
escaped. One example of this is Edgar Cayce.&nbsp; In April of 1939, he
fell into a trance and spoke about Atlantis. "In Atlantis, when there was
the breaking up of the land came to what was called the Mayan Land or the
what is now Yucatan-entity was the first to cross the water in the plane
or air machine of that period." In support of the escape, Atlantis has
been hailed for spawning civilizations such as Hellenic Greece, the Mayas
&amp; Incas of the New World, and ancient Egypt.&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">Atlantis has had
an impact on every culture. In 1675, Olof Rudbeck, a Swedish scholar, used
Homeric sailing directions to Ogygia and located Atlantis in Sweden.&nbsp;
English poet William Blake, believed that the Atlantean King, Albion lead
the last of his subjects to Britain, where they became Druids.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Charles-Etienne Brasseur de Bourbourg, a French scholar, translated a Mayan
manuscript in 1864, that described the story of an ancient land that had
sunk into the ocean after a great catastrophe.&nbsp; In 1882, Philadelphian
politician, and avid reader, Ignatius Loyola Donnelly published his book
Atlantis: The Antedefuvian World.&nbsp; The world's reception of his writings
was so great,&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">Donnelly was elected
to membership in the American Association for the Advancement of Science.&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">The most important
thought that is on everyone's mind is not where, what, or&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">how, but will.&nbsp;
Will Atlantis ever resurface??&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - by TisavadeT@aol.com</font></font>

<center><a name="Atlantis, The Lost"></a><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066"><font size="+1">Atlantis,
The Lost City</font></font></font></i></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">Atlantis, the Lost
City everyone is talking about. Where is it, is it real?&nbsp; Why are
there rumors if it's not true? Here we will explore the myths and realities
of the Lost Continent of Atlantis. Sit back, relax and take a wonderful
ride!</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">The city of Atlantis,
if you hear about it, one would think that it would be located in the Atlantic
Ocean, hence the name. But researchers have been looking for this continent
for years. The continent was mentioned in many religions and folklores,
that it became a possibility that it truly does exist. But if it does,
where is it and has it been found by scientists yet, or have they think
they have found the Lost City or Continent of Atlantis?</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">The great philosopher,
Plato, wrote in his Critias, that he believed that a great continent was
extremely technologically advanced, and that this continent had been destroyed
and lost by a rush of ocean covering the evidence to us to this day. Plato
had believed that Atlantis was located in the Atlantic Ocean somewhere.
In fact, the reason why the Atlantic Ocean is called such today, is because
of the Atlantean theory. Plato believed that Atlantis was a sunken continent
approximately the size of Libya and Asia put</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">together. That would
be about 5 to 10 million square kilometers hidden below a large oceanic
surface!</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">Monoliths, similar
to the monoliths in Easter Island, supposedly are a "signature" of the
Atlantean culture. Some believe this culture survived on to Islands and
lands such as Easter Island and other various areas still leaving scientists
and archeologists befuddled. Pyramids, such like those found in Egypt and
other ancient sites, are also a supposed "signature" of the Atlanteans.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">Plato believed that
Atlantis had a great army, probably of around 1.2 million armed men. He
also believed that the army had a vast number of chariots. Horses were
definitely used. This was the theory that had caused many to believe that
the horse that evolved from Asia became domesticated in Atlantis. This
remains a striking detail, because scientists and archeologists cannot
determine precisely when the domestication of the horse occurred.&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">Elephants are supposedly
also a very big part of the Atlantean culture.&nbsp; Plato even writes
himself:</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">"There were a great
number of elephants in the island, for there was ample provision of food
for all sorts of animals...including for the animal which is the largest
and the most voracious of all."</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">The strange part
about the elephants, is that the epoch in when the continent of Atlantis
was supposedly alive and flourishing, mastodons and mammoths were abundant,
and the elephant did not come about until approximately the supposed time
when the continent of Atlantis was believed to have "fallen" into the ocean,
the same time when mastodons and mammoths became extinct.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">It must be remembered,
that Plato had written Critias in 360 BCE. This was where it all started,
with Plato's words:</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">"Let me begin by
observing first of all, that nine thousand was the sum of years which had
elapsed since the war which was said to have taken place between those
who dwelt outside the Pillars of Hercules and all who dwelt within them;
this war I am going to describe. Of the combatants on the one side, the
city of Athens was reported to have been the leader and to have fought
out the war; the combatants on the other side were commanded by the kings
of Atlantis, which, as was saying, was an island greater in extent than
Libya and Asia, and when afterwards sunk by an earthquake, became an</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">impassable barrier
of mud to voyagers sailing from hence to any part of the</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">ocean. The progress
of the history will unfold the various nations of barbarians and families
of Hellenes which then existed, as they successively appear on the scene;
but I must describe first of all Athenians of that day, and their enemies
who fought with them, and then the respective powers and governments of
the two kingdoms. Let us give the precedence to Athens."</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">Where did Plato's
revelation of the continent of Atlantis come from? Plato's revelation was
told to him by a man named Solon, who in turn received the information
about Atlantis from the ancient Egyptians. If it's just a story, it is
one heck of an intriguing one! A thrilling reality to this wonderful piece
of writing, is that the end of the transcript has been lost. What was at
the end of the transcript...we will never know. He talked of Gods and spirits
that made the islanders what they were. An ancient influence that could
have come from anywhere. Could it have come from the stars? And is it just
plain mythology, or is there a glimpse of truth in the evidence?</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">What is interesting,
is that what Plato described is also described in the Bible as the "Great
Flood". Could the continent of Atlantis be the true "Garden of Eden?"</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">Some scientists believe
that the sinking of Atlantis was caused by a great "Ice Age." Pillars are
abundant on the oceanic floors, but are these pillars naturally made or
manmade?</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">The "Sleeping Prophet",
also known as Edgar Cayce, had believed he was an Atlantean himself. He
was a prophet that believed that spirits spoke to him in his dreams. The
dreams revealed revelations of great extent for his own life and many others.
His prophetic visions attracted many people, which in turn made many seek
out his help in life through his "seeing eye." Cayce believed that he was
being told his clairvoyances from Atlantean gods and spirits.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">One prophecy that
Edgar Cayce had made, did not come to pass, this was regarding the lost
continent of Atlantis. Cayce prophesized that the lost island of Atlantis
would emerge from the ocean in 1968 or 1969. Cayce also suggested that
the island was located near the Bermuda island of Bimini.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066">The lost continent
to this day, has many possibilities of where it could "be," however, no
scientific evidence that is strong enough to prove Atlantis had existed
has been yet found. But that doesn't mean that it doesn't exist!</font></font>

<center><a name="location"></a><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000066"><font size="+1">The Location of Atlantis<br>
      <br>
</font></font></font></i></b></center><font color="#000066" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The story of this lost city has been around since 355 B.C. Plato wrote 
about this lost land in two dialogues, Timaeus and Critias. Plato believed 
that this land was near the Straits of Gibraltar until its destruction 
10,000 years prior.<br>
      <br>
Atlantis was explained to be in the shape of a 
bullseye. Alternating rings of land seperated by the Atlantic. Plato used his 
dialogues (Timaeus and Critias) to express his thoughts.<br>
      <br>
In these 
dialogues a powerful empire was said to be located to the west of the Straits 
of Gibraltar (or what was then noted as the Pillars of Hercules). This Empire 
was founded by the God of the Sea, Poseidon. Poseidon had 5 children on this 
island. Atlas, the first born, had the continent and the surrounding ocean 
named after him. The land was then divided into ten sections to be ruled by 
each of his sons, and their heirs.<br>
      <br>
The capital of Atlantis was the best 
of engineering and architecture. This city was made up of walls and canals. 
In the very center was a hill, and on top of this hill was a temple to the 
God of the Sea.Inside of the temple was a gold statue of Poseidon driving six 
winged horses.<br>
      <br>
If you dare to assume that Atlantis exists then the only 
place that it could be found (my opinion, may differ from other researchers) 
is near the Azores Island which is just west of the Straight of Gibraltar. 
However a survey has been conducted in this area showing a blanket of 
sediment that would have taken millions of years to accumulate. Even though 
there is no scientific sign of the sunken continent....it's 
there.<br>
      <br>
Ocassionally someone will try to convince someone interested in 
Atlantis that it is near New Zealand or Switzerland?.If you find yourself in 
a situation where a person presents this idea..briskly walk in the 
opposite direction.<br>
      <br>
If you've done your research on Atlantis you 
should know the name K.T. Frost. Frost was the first to present the idea that 
Atlantis may be to the east rather than the west of Straits of Gibraltar. 
Frost also believed that the destruction of Atlantis came only 900 years 
before the birth of Plato.<br>
      <br>
So...where...is...Atlantis? If your not 
confused yet you should be. Ready for the 360 degree turn into a brick wall? 
Everyone knows the Island of Crete. If you don't...it's a modern part of 
Greece that lies just a bit south of Athens. If you don't know where Athens 
is...well...your a lost cause.<br>
      <br>
If we take a trip back in time to about 
1500 B.C. you would see the Island of Crete as the seat of the Minoan Empire. 
I know...I know, I lost you again.&nbsp; During this time period the Minoans were 
all over the eastern Mediterranean. Minoan Crete was the most sophisticated 
cultures of this period. Then without warning the Minoans disappeared...like 
dinosaurs after (insert your preferred theory here).<br>
      <br>
Ten miles north 
of Crete is Santorina. Many scientists, including myself, believe that a 
disaster occured here capable of destroyiing the Minoans. Twenty-five hundred 
years prior to this Santorina was just an island with a volcano, which 
erupted around 1500 B.C. The eruption was four times as powerful as Krakatoa. 
Imagine a 400 feet high tsunami, and now picture it landing in your backyard. 
Hey....wheres your house? Ash would have blackened the sky for 12 
days.<br>
      <br>
That tsunami hit Crete and destroyed everything including the 
Minoans. No castastrophe matches Plato's account of Atlantis than the one I 
just gave you. Do you accept this theory? Do you have one that puts this one 
to shame? Do you have more questions?<br>
