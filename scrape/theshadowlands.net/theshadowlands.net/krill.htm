<P ALIGN=Center><B>                          O. H. KRILL</B>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>The KRILL papers seemingly came out of nowhere and have
<P ALIGN=Center>stirred up a small hornets nest of speculation.  Who is O. H.
<P ALIGN=Center>Krill?  Is the information correct?  Are parts of the text
<P ALIGN=Center>correct and parts incorrect?  Where did the papers come from?
<P ALIGN=Center>I am going to answer SOME of those questions in this file.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>When the aliens landed at Holloman AFB in the 60's a basic
<P ALIGN=Center>communication was established  between the United States
<P ALIGN=Center>Government and the aliens.  During this communication a basic
<P ALIGN=Center>agreement was reached which was the precursor for the formal
<P ALIGN=Center>treaty and the diplomatic relations which followed.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>The aliens left a hostage with the United States as a pledge
<P ALIGN=Center>of fulfillment of their part of the agreement.  The name of
<P ALIGN=Center>that hostage was KRLL and was sometimes spelled KRYL.  I will
<P ALIGN=Center>refer to him as KRLL as this was the spelling used in the
<P ALIGN=Center>MAJESTY documents which I saw.  This hostage furnished much
<P ALIGN=Center>information about the aliens which became the foundation of
<P ALIGN=Center>the "YELLOW BOOK" that was completed from information
<P ALIGN=Center>obtained from the "GUESTS" at a later date.  In order that
<P ALIGN=Center>this information could be circulated and discussed among the
<P ALIGN=Center>military and the scientific community a pseudonym was coined
<P ALIGN=Center>as a code for information which had originated from KRLL.
<P ALIGN=Center>The code name for KRLL was Cril.  The initials O.  H.  stand
<P ALIGN=Center>for "ORIGINAL HOSTAGE"
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>All information thus circulated from the source KRLL was said
<P ALIGN=Center>to be authored by O. H. Cril.  The information was usually of
<P ALIGN=Center>scientific or seemingly occult nature and was sanitized so
<P ALIGN=Center>that no inference to an alien race or culture occurred.  This
<P ALIGN=Center>was done so that feedback and recommendations could be
<P ALIGN=Center>gleaned from those experts who were not privy to the secret.
<P ALIGN=Center>It was also used to pass technology from the aliens into the
<P ALIGN=Center>defense contracting community and the U. S. Space program.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>KRLL became ill after a few years and almost died but was
<P ALIGN=Center>nursed by a physician who eventually became the government
<P ALIGN=Center>expert on alien medicine and pathology.  My information is
<P ALIGN=Center>that KRLL did at some later date die.  The pseudonym
<P ALIGN=Center>continued to be used for the same purpose for many years and
<P ALIGN=Center>may or may not be in use at this time.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>The KRILL papers must have been authored by someone in the
<P ALIGN=Center>government or military who knew this information because the
<P ALIGN=Center>author O. H. Krill is an obvious take-off on O. H. Cril and
<P ALIGN=Center>thus on KRLL.  I do not know who the author is and I do not
<P ALIGN=Center>know if the material is directly from KRLL or not.  BUT IT IS
<P ALIGN=Center>APPARENT THAT WHOEVER O. H. KRILL MAY BE HE DID KNOW THE
<P ALIGN=Center>STORY OF KRLL.  In my opinion the origin of the material will
<P ALIGN=Center>most probably be the object of much speculation.  I cannot
<P ALIGN=Center>comment on the material which covers information that I have
<P ALIGN=Center>never seen before, however I can and will say that much of it
<P ALIGN=Center>is correct and agrees  with the information that I have
<P ALIGN=Center>already released.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>I never saw the KRILL papers before in my life until the
<P ALIGN=Center>Sysop of Paranet RHO called my attention to them in a file on
<P ALIGN=Center>that board.  This occurred only a few days before Christmas
<P ALIGN=Center>and I uploaded them to Ted Markley as soon as I could.  He
<P ALIGN=Center>informed me however that he had already obtained them from
<P ALIGN=Center>another source.

<P ALIGN=Center>         A SITUATION REPORT ON OUR ACQUISITION OF ADVANCED
<P ALIGN=Center>          TECHNOLOGY AND INTERACTION WITH ALIEN CULTURES
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>JANUARY 1988
<P ALIGN=Center>                                BY
<P ALIGN=Center>                             O.H. KRILL
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>                            ABSTRACT
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     Throughout the forty year period when UFO have been
actively
<P ALIGN=Center>observed in our civilization, a lot of data has been gathered
--
<P ALIGN=Center>data which has often pointed to aspects of the phenomena
that have
<P ALIGN=Center>been supressed. As a result of the suppression and
<P ALIGN=Center>compartmentalization of the information, our culture has
been
<P ALIGN=Center>fragmented into several levels of "reality" which both co-exist
<P ALIGN=Center>and oppose each other. Part of our culture does not or will
not
<P ALIGN=Center>believe in the existence of other species; part of our culture
<P ALIGN=Center>acknowledges their existence or the probability of their
<P ALIGN=Center>existence; part of our culture is actually interacting with
the
<P ALIGN=Center>other species. These simultaneous realities contribute to
the
<P ALIGN=Center>condition of extreme confusion in which we find ourselves.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Research into UFO's follows a similar pattern. Some
view the
<P ALIGN=Center>matter in a completely empirical perspective; others search
for
<P ALIGN=Center>patterns and functional relationships in events; still others
go
<P ALIGN=Center>out and ask the right questions at the right time and get
answers.
<P ALIGN=Center>Some of those answers that have appeared are, to some people,
<P ALIGN=Center>quite disturbing and fantastic.
<P ALIGN=Center>     All in all, we are dealing with new concepts in physics,
new
<P ALIGN=Center>concepts in psychology, and the gradually growing awareness
that
<P ALIGN=Center>we are not only not alone here, but we have never been alone
here.
<P ALIGN=Center>As if that were not enough, it turns out that factions of
our
<P ALIGN=Center>society have known this, and apparently have been interacting
with
<P ALIGN=Center>some of these alien species for quite a while.
<P ALIGN=Center>     The bottom line is that all along, humanity has been
led down
<P ALIGN=Center>a false path, a path that has been plagued by layer upon
layer of
<P ALIGN=Center>conspiracies and disinformation. Technological knowledge
and
<P ALIGN=Center>absolute power have been the motives on the human side. Survival
<P ALIGN=Center>has been the motive on the alien side, or at least as far
as the
<P ALIGN=Center>predominant alien visitors are concerned.
<P ALIGN=Center>     The intent of this paper is to bring much of the details
<P ALIGN=Center>regarding this into the open. You are not being asked to
believe
<P ALIGN=Center>it, but to consider it in the light of what has happened,
what is
<P ALIGN=Center>happening, and what may be developing right under our very
noses.
<P ALIGN=Center>If you find that you cannot stomach such thoughts, or that
you
<P ALIGN=Center>cannot deal with it, read no further.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     It is quite evident, or it should be, that the UFO situation
<P ALIGN=Center>is both complex and dangerous. The UFO problem is a multi-
<P ALIGN=Center>situational and multi-dimensional phenomena. We have established
<P ALIGN=Center>the following as having a basis in fact:
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Craft from other worlds have crashed on Earth.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Alien craft are from both ultra-dimensional
sources
<P ALIGN=Center>             and sources within this dimension.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Early U.S. government efforts at acquiring alien
<P ALIGN=Center>             technology were successful.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  The U.S. government has had live alien hostages
at
<P ALIGN=Center>             some point in time.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  The government has conducted autopsies on alien
<P ALIGN=Center>             cadavers.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  U.S. intelligence agencies, security agencies,
and
<P ALIGN=Center>             public agencies are involved in the coverup
of facts
<P ALIGN=Center>             pertaining to the situation.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  People have been and are currently abducted,
<P ALIGN=Center>             mutilated, murdered and kidnapped as a result
of the
<P ALIGN=Center>             UFO situation.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  There is a current active alien presence on
this
<P ALIGN=Center>             planet among us that controls difference elements
of
<P ALIGN=Center>             our society.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Alien forces maintain bases on Earth and on
the Moon.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  The U.S. government has had a working relationship
<P ALIGN=Center>             with alien forces for some time, with the express
<P ALIGN=Center>             purpose of gaining technology in gravitational
<P ALIGN=Center>             propulsion, beam weaponry and mind control.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Millions of cattle have been killed in the process
<P ALIGN=Center>             of acquiring biological materials.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Both aliens and the U.S. government are responsible
<P ALIGN=Center>             for mutilations, but for different reasons.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  We live in a multi-dimensional world that is
<P ALIGN=Center>             overlapped and visited by entities from other
<P ALIGN=Center>             dimensions. Many of these entities are hostile.
<P ALIGN=Center>             Many are not hostile.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  The basis of our genetic development and religions
<P ALIGN=Center>             lies in intervention by non-terrestrial and
<P ALIGN=Center>             terrestrial forces.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Actual technology far exceeds that perceived
by
<P ALIGN=Center>             the public.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  The United States space program is a cover operation
<P ALIGN=Center>             that exists for public relations purposes.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  People are being actively killed in order to
suppress
<P ALIGN=Center>             the facts about the situation. The CIA and the
NSA
<P ALIGN=Center>             are involved so deeply that exposure would cause
<P ALIGN=Center>             collapse of their overt structure.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Facts indicate alien overt presence within five
to
<P ALIGN=Center>             ten years.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Our civilization is one of many that have existed
in
<P ALIGN=Center>             the last billion years.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>You will probably have more conclusions. To see, just read
on....

<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>                  Animal Mutilations and UFOs
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>General Chronology
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     In the middle of 1963, a series of livestock attacks
occurred
<P ALIGN=Center>in Haskell County, Texas. In a typical case, an Angus bull
was
<P ALIGN=Center>found with its throat slashed and a saucer-sized wound in
its
<P ALIGN=Center>stomach. The citizenry attributed the attacks to a wild beast
of
<P ALIGN=Center>some sort, a "vanishing varmint." As it continued its furtive
<P ALIGN=Center>forays through the Haskell County outback, the bloodluster
assumed
<P ALIGN=Center>somewhat more mythic proportions and a new name was destined
to
<P ALIGN=Center>endure: The Haskell Rascal.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Throughout the following decade, there would be sporadic
<P ALIGN=Center>reports of similar attacks on livestock. These attacks were
<P ALIGN=Center>occasionally described as "mutilations." The most prominent
of
<P ALIGN=Center>these infrequent reports was the mutilation death of "Snippy"
the
<P ALIGN=Center>horse in southern Colorado in 1967, accompanied by area UFO
<P ALIGN=Center>sightings, a Condon Committee investigation and worldwide
press
<P ALIGN=Center>coverage.
<P ALIGN=Center>     It was in 1973 that the modern animal mutilation wave
can be
<P ALIGN=Center>said to have begun in earnest. That year is generally thought
of
<P ALIGN=Center>as the year of the last concerted UFO flap, although there
may be
<P ALIGN=Center>reason to question that contention, given the events of two
years
<P ALIGN=Center>later.
<P ALIGN=Center>     In 1973 and 1974 the majority of the classic mutilation
<P ALIGN=Center>reports originated in the central United States.
<P ALIGN=Center>     In 1975, an unprecedented onslaught spread across the
western
<P ALIGN=Center>two-thirds of the United States. Mutilation reports peaked
in that
<P ALIGN=Center>year, accompanied by accounts of UFOs and unidentified
<P ALIGN=Center>helicopters. In 1978, the attacks increased.
<P ALIGN=Center>     By 1979, numerous livestock mutilations were occurring
in
<P ALIGN=Center>Canada, primarily in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Attacks in
the
<P ALIGN=Center>United States leveled off.
<P ALIGN=Center>     In 1980, there was an increase in activity in the United
<P ALIGN=Center>States. Mutilations have been reported less frequently since
that
<P ALIGN=Center>year, though this may be due in part to an increased reluctance
to
<P ALIGN=Center>report mutilations on the part of ranchers and farmers. The
<P ALIGN=Center>mutilations still continue. Over ten thousand animals have
died in
<P ALIGN=Center>the United States; although the mutilations have been occurring
<P ALIGN=Center>worldwide, the same circumstances are always present.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>General Observations
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     Any investigation which intends to probe the systematic
<P ALIGN=Center>occurrence of the mutilation attacks upon livestock and other
<P ALIGN=Center>animals must include within its purview certain factors which
may
<P ALIGN=Center>or may not be directly related to the acts of mutilation
<P ALIGN=Center>themselves. These mutilations -- the killing and furtive
removal
<P ALIGN=Center>of external or internal parts -- have been directed at literally
<P ALIGN=Center>thousands of animals (primarily livestock) since the 1960s.
The
<P ALIGN=Center>surgery on these animals is primarily conducted with uncanny
<P ALIGN=Center>precision, suggesting the use of highly sophisticated implements
<P ALIGN=Center>and techniques. The numbing and persistent regularity of
the
<P ALIGN=Center>mutilations and the seemingly casual disposal of the useless
<P ALIGN=Center>carcasses all hint at extreme confidence -- even arrogance
-- of
<P ALIGN=Center>the mutilators. It is an arrogance which appears to be justified
<P ALIGN=Center>by the freedom and impunity with which these acts have been
<P ALIGN=Center>carried out.
<P ALIGN=Center>     The pertinence of a specific element of the problem
is
<P ALIGN=Center>shortly revealed in the course of any thorough investigation
into
<P ALIGN=Center>the mutilations. I refer to the appearance of unmarked and
<P ALIGN=Center>otherwise unidentified helicopters within a spatial and temporal
<P ALIGN=Center>proximity of animal mutilation sites. The occurrence of the
two has
<P ALIGN=Center>been persistent enough to supercede coincidence.
<P ALIGN=Center>     These mystery helicopters are almost always without
<P ALIGN=Center>identifying markings, or markings may appear to have been
painted
<P ALIGN=Center>over or covered with something. The helicopters are frequently
<P ALIGN=Center>reported flying at abnormal, unsafe or illegal altitudes.
They may
<P ALIGN=Center>shy away if witnesses of law officers try to approach.
<P ALIGN=Center>     There are several accounts of aggressive behavior on
the part
<P ALIGN=Center>of the helicopter occupants, with witnesses chased, "buzzed,"
<P ALIGN=Center>hovered over or even fired upon. At times these choppers
appear
<P ALIGN=Center>very near mutilation sites, even hovering over a pasture
where a
<P ALIGN=Center>mutilated carcass is later found. They may be observed shortly
<P ALIGN=Center>before or after mutilations occur -- or within days of a
<P ALIGN=Center>mutilation. The intention here is merely to stress that the
<P ALIGN=Center>"mystery helicopter" element is a part of the issue which
deserves
<P ALIGN=Center>scrutiny.
<P ALIGN=Center>     The idea of "mystery helicopters" did not develop
<P ALIGN=Center>concurrently with the animal mutilations themselves. Such
<P ALIGN=Center>helicopters -- unmarked, flying at low levels, soundless
(or
<P ALIGN=Center>sounding like helicopters) -- have been reported for years,
and
<P ALIGN=Center>have been linked to an even more widespread phenomenon --
the
<P ALIGN=Center>"phantom" (fixed wing) aircraft. The helicopters themselves
have
<P ALIGN=Center>been seen in area where UFOs were reported, in many countries.
In
<P ALIGN=Center>some of the more interesting accounts, the mystery helicopters
<P ALIGN=Center>were seen with UFOs, or shortly after the UFOs were sighted.
<P ALIGN=Center>     The most apt case I can think of, but certainly not
the most
<P ALIGN=Center>isolated, is a case described by Virgil Armstrong in his
lecture
<P ALIGN=Center>on "What NASA Didn't Tell Us About the Moon." He discusses
<P ALIGN=Center>helicopters and UFOs in general.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Armstrong describes a friend of his that had invented
a
<P ALIGN=Center>special camera arrangement with the idea that it would increase
<P ALIGN=Center>the chances of getting good pictures of UFOs. The camera
was
<P ALIGN=Center>mounted on a gunstock along with a laser. The idea was to
fire the
<P ALIGN=Center>laser at the UFO, if one appeared, and hopefully the UFO
would
<P ALIGN=Center>come to a halt, enabling him to take some quality pictures.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Not too long after they were set up in the desert, a
UFO did
<P ALIGN=Center>in fact appear, and they fired the laser and the disk stopped
in a
<P ALIGN=Center>hovering mode. They took quite a few good pictures of it.
Shortly
<P ALIGN=Center>thereafter, the disk flew away. Within minutes, they heard
the
<P ALIGN=Center>unmistakable sound of helicopters coming their way. The
<P ALIGN=Center>helicopters landed strategically around their group, and
out of
<P ALIGN=Center>the choppers came a croup of Black Berets, which are strategic
Air
<P ALIGN=Center>Force security forces. The commander of the Berets walked
up to
<P ALIGN=Center>the group and said, "What are you doing here?" "Obviously,
we are
<P ALIGN=Center>photographing flying objects, and we just saw a flying saucer
and
<P ALIGN=Center>we got some very very good pictures of it." The commander
then
<P ALIGN=Center>asked the leader of the group if he knew where he was. The
group
<P ALIGN=Center>leader replied "No." The commander then said, "We suggest
you get
<P ALIGN=Center>out of here right now!" The group leader then asked, "What
right
<P ALIGN=Center>do you have to tell us to get out of here? Is this government
<P ALIGN=Center>land?" The commander of the Black Berets replied, "Indeed
it is.
<P ALIGN=Center>It is Andrews Air Force Base, and if you are not out of here
in
<P ALIGN=Center>ten minutes, you are under arrest." With that, the Berets
removed
<P ALIGN=Center>the film from the camera, and the group left.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Not only does this illustrate one kind of instance where
UFOs
<P ALIGN=Center>are seen in relationship to helicopters, but it also illustrates
<P ALIGN=Center>the fact that either some of the disks are ours, or we have
a
<P ALIGN=Center>military/government relationship with those who fly them.
The
<P ALIGN=Center>helicopters mentioned above are not the mystery ones, but
were
<P ALIGN=Center>United States military ones.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Another case of military helicopters and United States-owned
<P ALIGN=Center>disks comes from the book "UFO Crash at Aztec," by Wendell
<P ALIGN=Center>Stevens. In the book he relates the incident where an Indian
was
<P ALIGN=Center>backpacking in the mountains in the vicinity of Area 51,
Groom
<P ALIGN=Center>Lake, on the Nellis AFB range north of Las Vegas. He heard
<P ALIGN=Center>approaching helicopters and hid out of sight. The helicopters
were
<P ALIGN=Center>broadcasting a warning over public address systems for anyone
in
<P ALIGN=Center>the area to show themselves because they were going to conduct
a
<P ALIGN=Center>"dangerous military test." The Indian maintained his hidden
<P ALIGN=Center>posture, and the helicopters flew overhead and back down
toward
<P ALIGN=Center>the Groom Lake facility. Minutes later, two helicopters were
seen
<P ALIGN=Center>flying up the canyon with a black disk flying between them
and
<P ALIGN=Center>slightly above them. They flew overhead and then the helicopters
<P ALIGN=Center>turned around and flew back towards the base, followed shortly
<P ALIGN=Center>afterward by the disk. The individual's name and how to contact
<P ALIGN=Center>him for further details is given in the book.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>The Mystery Choppers
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     Situations involving the mystery helicopters appear
to be a
<P ALIGN=Center>little more insidious. A good example is an event which occurred
<P ALIGN=Center>in Madison County, Montana, between June and October of 1976.
<P ALIGN=Center>Twenty-two confirmed cattle mutilations had occurred during
that
<P ALIGN=Center>period, and they were accompanied by reports throughout the
county
<P ALIGN=Center>of silent, unmarked, jet-black helicopters, flashing or steady
<P ALIGN=Center>anomalous lights in the air and near the ground, unmarked
fixed-
<P ALIGN=Center>wing aircraft and white vans in remote and previously
inaccessible
<P ALIGN=Center>areas.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Toward the latter part of this period, in early autumn
of
<P ALIGN=Center>1976, a hunter from Bozeman, Montana, was out alone around
3:00pm
<P ALIGN=Center>one day in the Red Mountain area near Norris. He watched
as a
<P ALIGN=Center>black helicopter without markings flew overhead and disappeared
<P ALIGN=Center>below a small hill. The curious hunter climbed to the top
of the
<P ALIGN=Center>hill. There was the black chopper (a Bell Jet Ranger, he
thought)
<P ALIGN=Center>on the ground, the engine still running. Seven men had apparently
<P ALIGN=Center>exited from the craft and were walking up the hill toward
the
<P ALIGN=Center>observer. As the hunter advanced toward the seven, he waved
and
<P ALIGN=Center>shouted congenial greetings. It was then that he realized
there
<P ALIGN=Center>was something about the men -- they were all Oriental. They
had
<P ALIGN=Center>slanted eyes and olive skin and were jabbering among themselves
in
<P ALIGN=Center>some indecipherable language. They wore "everyday" clothes,
not
<P ALIGN=Center>uniforms. Suddenly they began to return to the helicopter.
The
<P ALIGN=Center>hunter, still waving and shouting friendly greetings, started
<P ALIGN=Center>after them. The Orientals quickened their pace. When the
hunter
<P ALIGN=Center>approached within five or six feet, they broke into a dead
run,
<P ALIGN=Center>crowded into the chopper and took off.
<P ALIGN=Center>     In a documented "mystery helicopter" wave in England,
<P ALIGN=Center>accounts place Oriental-appearing occupants in an unidentified
<P ALIGN=Center>chopper. Slant-eyed, olive skinned, Oriental-seeming occupants
<P ALIGN=Center>have been a staple at the heart and at the periphery of UFO
<P ALIGN=Center>accounts for years. Significant numbers of the infamous "men-in-
<P ALIGN=Center>black" (MIB) have a similar appearance, but very often they
are
<P ALIGN=Center>seen as very pale and gaunt men who are sensitive to light.
<P ALIGN=Center>     In STIGMATA No. 5 (Fall-Winter 1978) Tom Adams outlined
the
<P ALIGN=Center>most prominent speculative explanations accounting for the
<P ALIGN=Center>mutilation/helicopter link, including the following:
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  The helicopters are themselves UFOs, disguised
to
<P ALIGN=Center>             appear as terrestrial craft.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  The choppers originate from within the U.S.
<P ALIGN=Center>             government/military and are directly involved
in
<P ALIGN=Center>             conducting the actual mutilations.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  The helicopters are government/military and
are not
<P ALIGN=Center>             involved in the mutilations but are investigating
<P ALIGN=Center>             them.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  The helicopters are government/military, and
they
<P ALIGN=Center>             know about the identity and motives of the
<P ALIGN=Center>             mutilators and by their presence, they are trying
to
<P ALIGN=Center>             divert attention to the possibility of involvement
<P ALIGN=Center>             by the military.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     The answer, as far as Tom Adams is concerned, could
be a
<P ALIGN=Center>combination of the above explanations. There also has been
<P ALIGN=Center>speculation that they are involved in biological experiments
with
<P ALIGN=Center>chemical or biological warfare or the geobotanical pursuit
<P ALIGN=Center>of petroleum and mineral deposits. On one occasion, an army
<P ALIGN=Center>standard-type scalpel was found at a mutilation site. Since
the
<P ALIGN=Center>disks have been mostly involved with the mutilations, it
is
<P ALIGN=Center>thought that this was a diversionary event.
<P ALIGN=Center>     These events, or the discussion of them, is just the
<P ALIGN=Center>precursor to the actual revelations of what is behind the
<P ALIGN=Center>mutilations: alien acquisition of biological materials for
their
<P ALIGN=Center>own use. To discuss this in a logical and sequential manner,
we
<P ALIGN=Center>must review what has been really happening right under our
noses:
<P ALIGN=Center>direct interaction with extraterrestrial biological entities
<P ALIGN=Center>(EBE's). To discuss that, however, we must attempt to start
at the
<P ALIGN=Center>beginning with what we now know to be true.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>                         The Saga Begins
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     It seemingly all began thousands of years ago, but for
the
<P ALIGN=Center>purposes of this discussion, let's start with some events
that we
<P ALIGN=Center>all are familiar with. In 1947, two years after we set off
the
<P ALIGN=Center>first nuclear explosion that our current civilization detonated,
<P ALIGN=Center>came the Mantell episode, where we had the first recorded
incident
<P ALIGN=Center>of a military confrontation with extraterrestrials that resulted
<P ALIGN=Center>in the death of a military pilot. It is quite evident now
that our
<P ALIGN=Center>government did not known quite how to handle the situation.
In
<P ALIGN=Center>1952, the nation's capital was overflown by a series of disks.
It
<P ALIGN=Center>was this event which led to the involvement of United States
<P ALIGN=Center>security forces (CIA, NSA, DIA, FBI) to try to keep the situation
<P ALIGN=Center>under control until they could understand what was happening.
<P ALIGN=Center>During this period, the government established a working
group,
<P ALIGN=Center>known as Majestic Twelve (MJ-12). The original members were:
<P ALIGN=Center>Admiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, Dr. Vannevar Bush, Secretary
<P ALIGN=Center>James Forrestal, General Nathan P. Twining, General Hoyt
S.
<P ALIGN=Center>Vandenburg, Dr. Detlev Bronk, Dr. Jerome Hunsaker, Mr. Sidney
W.
<P ALIGN=Center>Souers, Mr. Gordon Gray, Dr. Donald Menzel, General Robert
M.
<P ALIGN=Center>Montague, and Dr. Lloyd V. Berkner.
<P ALIGN=Center>     The MJ-12 group has been a continuously existing group
since
<P ALIGN=Center>it was created, with new members replacing others that die.
For
<P ALIGN=Center>example, when Secretary Forrestal was upset at seeing the
United
<P ALIGN=Center>States sold out in World War II, he wound up being sent to
a Naval
<P ALIGN=Center>hospital for emotional strain. Before relatives could get
to him,
<P ALIGN=Center>he "jumped out a 16th story window." Most persons close to
him
<P ALIGN=Center>consider his suicide contrived. When Forrestal died, he was
<P ALIGN=Center>replaced by General Walter B. Smith.
<P ALIGN=Center>     In December of 1947, Project Sign was created to acquire
as
<P ALIGN=Center>much information as possible about UFOs, their performance
<P ALIGN=Center>characteristics and their purposes. In order to preserve
security,
<P ALIGN=Center>liaison between Project Sign and MJ-12 was limited to two
<P ALIGN=Center>individuals within the intelligence division of the Air Materiel
<P ALIGN=Center>Command whose role it was to pass along certain types of
<P ALIGN=Center>information through channels. Project Sign evolved into Project
<P ALIGN=Center>Grudge in December, 1948. Project Grudge had an over civilian
<P ALIGN=Center>counterpart named Project Bluebook, with which we are all
<P ALIGN=Center>familiar. Only "safe" reports were passed to Bluebook. In
1949,
<P ALIGN=Center>MJ-12 evolved an initial plan of contingency called
MJ-1949-04P/78
<P ALIGN=Center>that was to make allowance for public disclosure of some
data
<P ALIGN=Center>should the necessity present itself.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Majestic Twelve was originally organized by General
George C.
<P ALIGN=Center>Marshall in July, 1947, to study the Roswell-Magdalena UFO
crash
<P ALIGN=Center>recovery and debris. Admiral Hillenkoetter, director of the
CIA
<P ALIGN=Center>from May 1, 1947, until September, 1950, decided to activate
the
<P ALIGN=Center>"Robertson Panel," which was designed to monitor civilian
UFO
<P ALIGN=Center>study groups that were appearing all over the country. He
also
<P ALIGN=Center>joined NICAP in 1956 and was chosen as a member of its board
of
<P ALIGN=Center>directors. It was from this position that he was able to
act as
<P ALIGN=Center>the MJ-12 "mole," along with his team of other covert experts.
<P ALIGN=Center>They were able to steer NICAP in any direction they wanted
to go.
<P ALIGN=Center>With the "Flying Saucer Program" under complete control of
MJ-12
<P ALIGN=Center>and with the physical evidence hidden away, General Marshall
felt
<P ALIGN=Center>more at ease with this very bizarre situation. These men
and their
<P ALIGN=Center>successors have most successfully kept most of the public
fooled
<P ALIGN=Center>for 39 years, including much of the western world, by setting
up
<P ALIGN=Center>false experts and throwing their influence behind them to
make
<P ALIGN=Center>their plan work, with considerable success. Until now.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Within six months of the Roswell crash on 2 July 1947
and the
<P ALIGN=Center>finding of another crashed UFO at San Augustine Flats near
<P ALIGN=Center>Magdalena, New Mexico, on 3 July 1947, a great deal of
<P ALIGN=Center>reorganization of agencies and shuffling of people took place.
The
<P ALIGN=Center>main thrust behind the original "security lid," and the very
<P ALIGN=Center>reason for its construction, was the analysis and attempted
<P ALIGN=Center>duplication of the technologies of the disks. That activity
is
<P ALIGN=Center>headed up by the following groups:
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  The Research and Development Board (R&amp;DB)
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Air Force Research and Development (AFRD)
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  The Office of Naval Research (ONR)
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  CIA Office of Scientific Intelligence (CIA-OSI)
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  NSA Office Of Scientific Intelligence (NSA-OSI)
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     No single one of these groups was supposed to know the
whole
<P ALIGN=Center>story. Each group was to know only the parts that MJ-12 allowed
<P ALIGN=Center>them to know. MJ-12 also operates through the various civilian
<P ALIGN=Center>intelligence and investigative groups. The CIA and the FBI
are
<P ALIGN=Center>manipulated by MJ-12 to carry out their purposes. The NSA
was
<P ALIGN=Center>created in the first place to protect the secret of the recovered
<P ALIGN=Center>flying disks, and eventually got complete control over all
<P ALIGN=Center>communications intelligence.
<P ALIGN=Center>     This control allows the NSA to monitor any individual
through
<P ALIGN=Center>mail, telephone, telexes, telegrams, and now through online
<P ALIGN=Center>computers, monitoring private and personal communications
as they
<P ALIGN=Center>choose. In fact, the present-day NSA is the current main
extension
<P ALIGN=Center>of MJ-12 pertaining to the "Flying Saucer Program." Vast
amounts
<P ALIGN=Center>of disinformation are spread throughout the UFO research
field.
<P ALIGN=Center>Any witnesses to any aspect of the program have their lives
<P ALIGN=Center>monitored in every detail, for each has signed a security
oath.
<P ALIGN=Center>For people who have worked in the program, including military
<P ALIGN=Center>members, breaking that oath could have any on of the following
<P ALIGN=Center>direct consequences:
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  A verbal warning accompanied by a review of
the
<P ALIGN=Center>             security oath.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  A stronger warning, sometimes accompanied by
a brow-
<P ALIGN=Center>             beating and intimidation.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Psychologically working on an individual to
bring on
<P ALIGN=Center>             depression that will lead to suicide.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Murder of the person made to appear as a suicide
or
<P ALIGN=Center>             accident.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Strange and sudden accidents, always fatal.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Confinement in special "detention centers."
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Confinement in "insane asylums" where they are
<P ALIGN=Center>             "treated" by mind-control and deprogramming
<P ALIGN=Center>             techniques. Individuals are released with changed
<P ALIGN=Center>             personalities, identities, and altered memories.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Bringing the individual into the "inside," where
he
<P ALIGN=Center>             is employed and works for "them," and where
he can be
<P ALIGN=Center>             watched. This is usually in closed facilities
with
<P ALIGN=Center>             little contact with the outside world. Underground
<P ALIGN=Center>             facilities are the usual place for this.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     Any individual who they perceive to be "too close to
the
<P ALIGN=Center>truth" will be treated in the same manner. MJ-12 will go
to any
<P ALIGN=Center>length to preserve and protect the ultimate secret. As we
will see
<P ALIGN=Center>later, the characteristics of what this ultimate secret would
turn
<P ALIGN=Center>out to be would change drastically, for it was something
even MJ-
<P ALIGN=Center>12 could not predict -- actual contact with alien groups.
<P ALIGN=Center>     How the actual contact between the government and aliens
was
<P ALIGN=Center>initially made is not known, but the government was made
aware
<P ALIGN=Center>that it could be done by a civilian using the right equipment.
<P ALIGN=Center>Dr. Paul Bennewitz,  civilian scientist, did so using computer
<P ALIGN=Center>equipment and informed the government he had done so, not
<P ALIGN=Center>realizing that by then, in 1983, that the government was
in truth
<P ALIGN=Center>as deep into dealing with the aliens as his communications
with
<P ALIGN=Center>them revealed. Dr. Bennewitz lives next to Manzano Weapons
Storage
<P ALIGN=Center>Area in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He observed UFOs constantly
over
<P ALIGN=Center>the area and initially decided that they were a threat to
the
<P ALIGN=Center>installation. He proceeded to figure out a coding system
and
<P ALIGN=Center>attempted and was successful in communicating with the aliens
that
<P ALIGN=Center>were flying over that area.
<P ALIGN=Center>     What he found out is that after initial contacts with
the
<P ALIGN=Center>aliens years ago, we agreed to to provide them with bases
<P ALIGN=Center>underground in the United States in return for certain
<P ALIGN=Center>technological secrets which the aliens would reveal to us.
The
<P ALIGN=Center>aliens would also be allowed to carry out certain operations,
<P ALIGN=Center>abductions, and mutilations without intervention.
<P ALIGN=Center>     The original contact between the government and the
<P ALIGN=Center>extraterrestrial biological entities, who are grey in color
and
<P ALIGN=Center>about 3.5 to 4.5 feet high (hereafter referred to as the
Greys),
<P ALIGN=Center>was achieved between 1947 and 1951. We knew that the Greys
were
<P ALIGN=Center>instrumental in performing the mutilations of animals (and
some
<P ALIGN=Center>humans) and that they were using the glandular substances
derived
<P ALIGN=Center>from these materials for food (absorbed through the skin)
and to
<P ALIGN=Center>clone more Greys in their underground laboratories. The
government
<P ALIGN=Center>was also aware that the Greys performed some of the abductions
to
<P ALIGN=Center>secure genetic materials. The government insisted that the
Greys
<P ALIGN=Center>provide them with a list that would be presented to the National
<P ALIGN=Center>Security Council.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Through all this, the government thought that the Greys
were
<P ALIGN=Center>basically tolerable creatures, although a bit distasteful.
They
<P ALIGN=Center>presumed at the time that it was not unreasonable to assume
that
<P ALIGN=Center>the public would and could get used to their presence. Between
<P ALIGN=Center>1968 and 1969 a plan was formulated to make the public aware
of
<P ALIGN=Center>their existence over the succeeding twenty years. This time
period
<P ALIGN=Center>would culminate with a series of documentaries that would
explain
<P ALIGN=Center>the history and intentions of the Greys.
<P ALIGN=Center>     The Greys assured us that the real purpose of the abductions
<P ALIGN=Center>was for monitoring of our civilization, and when we learned
that
<P ALIGN=Center>the abductions were a lot more frequent and insidious than
we were
<P ALIGN=Center>led to believe, the government became concerned. Their concern
was
<P ALIGN=Center>also based on additional information regarding the purposes
for
<P ALIGN=Center>the abductions:
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Insertion of a 3mm spherical biological monitoring
<P ALIGN=Center>             device through the nasal cavity into the brain
of the
<P ALIGN=Center>             abductee.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Implementing subliminal post-hypnotic suggestions
<P ALIGN=Center>             that would compel the abductee to perform some
<P ALIGN=Center>             specific act at a time to be within the next
two
<P ALIGN=Center>             to five years.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Genetic crossbreeding between the Greys and
human
<P ALIGN=Center>             beings.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Insertion of discoid monitoring devices into
the
<P ALIGN=Center>             muscle tissue of the abductees. Presence of
these has
<P ALIGN=Center>             been verified by x-ray.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     By the time we had found out the truth about the intentions
<P ALIGN=Center>of the Greys (they intend to stay here and stay in control
of our
<P ALIGN=Center>world) it was too late. We had already "sold out" humanity.
Not
<P ALIGN=Center>that it would have made any difference, because they were
here
<P ALIGN=Center>doing what they were doing anyway.
<P ALIGN=Center>     In 1983, a story was outlined by government sources
that said
<P ALIGN=Center>that the Greys are responsible for our biological evolution
<P ALIGN=Center>through manipulation of the DNA of already evolving primates
on
<P ALIGN=Center>this planet. Various time intervals of the DNA manipulation
were
<P ALIGN=Center>specified for 25,000, 15,000, 5,000, and 2,500 years ago.
<P ALIGN=Center>Originally, the government thought that the Greys meant us
no
<P ALIGN=Center>harm, but today, in 1988, the picture that is emerging is
exactly
<P ALIGN=Center>the opposite. The story now is one of great deception at
several
<P ALIGN=Center>different levels: the Greys Trojan Horse-style manipulation
and
<P ALIGN=Center>lying which allied MJ-12 forces with them four decades ago;
the
<P ALIGN=Center>government's disinformation of the subject of UFOs in order
to
<P ALIGN=Center>perpetuate the agreement with the Greys free of public scrutiny;
<P ALIGN=Center>the lies to the abductees; the Greys on-going abduction of
people
<P ALIGN=Center>and mutilation of animals in order to harvest enzymes, blood
and
<P ALIGN=Center>other tissues for their own survival needs; and a genetic
blend of
<P ALIGN=Center>the Grey race and a tall Nordic race to enable Grey interface
with
<P ALIGN=Center>humans to be done with greater ease.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Information from a source at a southwest Army base reveals
<P ALIGN=Center>that these multiple levels of deception are true. It is also
<P ALIGN=Center>indicated that the goal of SDI (Star Wars) is actually to
follow
<P ALIGN=Center>through with an attack, proposed by the Greys, on the Nordics
when
<P ALIGN=Center>they arrive en masse between now and 1992. This time schedule
<P ALIGN=Center>seems to match with the post-hypnotic programming of many
<P ALIGN=Center>abductees for actions between the next two to five years.
<P ALIGN=Center>     This same source sees the world dominated and controlled
by
<P ALIGN=Center>the Greys in a way similar to that portrayed in the "V"
television
<P ALIGN=Center>series -- they are concerned only for their own survival
agenda,
<P ALIGN=Center>and this agenda requires biological substances from other
life
<P ALIGN=Center>forms on our planet.
<P ALIGN=Center>     The apparent reasoning for the Grey preoccupation with
this
<P ALIGN=Center>is due to their lack of a formal digestive tract and the
fact that
<P ALIGN=Center>they absorb nutrients and excrete waste directly through
the skin.
<P ALIGN=Center>The substances that they acquire are mixed with hydrogen
peroxide
<P ALIGN=Center>and "painted" on their skin, allowing absorption of the required
<P ALIGN=Center>nutrients. It is construed from this that some weaponry against
<P ALIGN=Center>them might be geared in this direction.

<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>                            by O.H. KRILL
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>Observations by a Visiting Nordic
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     In October, 1987, UFO researcher George Andrews was

<P ALIGN=Center>successfully able to contact one of the Nordics not associated

<P ALIGN=Center>with the Greys, through a woman in California. What follows
are 
<P ALIGN=Center>the comments made by the alien:
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     "Were you a culture about to invade, you would not do
it with 
<P ALIGN=Center>a flourish of ships showing up in the heavens and undergo
risk of 
<P ALIGN=Center>being fired upon. That's the type of warfare slightly less
evolved
<P ALIGN=Center>beings get into. You would create intense confusion and 
<P ALIGN=Center>disagreement with only inferences to your presence -- inferences

<P ALIGN=Center>which would [in turn] cause controversial disagreement.
<P ALIGN=Center>     "The Greys are insidious little fiends. They did exactly
[to 
<P ALIGN=Center>us] what they're doing here [to you]. You are not on the
verge of 
<P ALIGN=Center>an invasion. You are not in the middle of an invasion. The

<P ALIGN=Center>invasion has already taken place. It's merely in its final
stages.
<P ALIGN=Center>     "What would you invade? [Here he describes the operational

<P ALIGN=Center>plan of the Greys from the beginning.] You would go to the
most 
<P ALIGN=Center>secret of communities within a society. In the case of the
United 
<P ALIGN=Center>States, you would go and infiltrate the CIA. You would take
over 
<P ALIGN=Center>some of them and you would take over part of the KGB.
<P ALIGN=Center>     "You would create great dissension and disagreement
between 
<P ALIGN=Center>factions of the public at large -- some groups saying they
have 
<P ALIGN=Center>seen UFOs, others saying 'No, no, this is not possible.'
You would 
<P ALIGN=Center>involve two major countries in an on-going idiotic philosophical

<P ALIGN=Center>disagreement so that while the Soviet Union and the United
States 
<P ALIGN=Center>constantly battle back and forth about who has which piece
of 
<P ALIGN=Center>territory or whether one invades Iran or whether one invades

<P ALIGN=Center>Afghanistan or whatever... whether one dismantles one nuclear

<P ALIGN=Center>warhead or the other dismantles another group of warheads
-- you 
<P ALIGN=Center>would sit back and laugh if you had the capacity to laugh.
<P ALIGN=Center>     "You would present yourself indeed to some in a group
who 
<P ALIGN=Center>would protect you [CIA or MJ-12] thinking they had a secret
more 
<P ALIGN=Center>secret and more perfect knowledge of something than anyone
else on 
<P ALIGN=Center>this planet had, and they would covet you and you would trust

<P ALIGN=Center>their own greed and you would trust their own mass stupidity
to 
<P ALIGN=Center>trap them. And you'd do it on both sides.
<P ALIGN=Center>     "You'd show yourself to some of the mass populace to
further 
<P ALIGN=Center>involve [factions of] the government in an attempt to shut
them 
<P ALIGN=Center>up, to keep them even more busy quieting them and trying
to 'stop 
<P ALIGN=Center>more information about UFOs from getting out.' You'd have
the mass 
<P ALIGN=Center>populace to a state where they distrusted the government.
'Oh, why 
<P ALIGN=Center>don't they believe us? Why can't they understand that these
things 
<P ALIGN=Center>are really happening? We're not crazy!'
<P ALIGN=Center>     "So you would have battles constantly about whether
UFOs 
<P ALIGN=Center>exist or they don't exist. You would have the public and
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>government at each other's throats. You would set two major

<P ALIGN=Center>superpowers at each other's throats. And you would have set
up 
<P ALIGN=Center>groups like 'haves' -- the wealthy but contented -- and the
'have-
<P ALIGN=Center>nots.' You would plant the seeds of massive discontent.
<P ALIGN=Center>     "Eventually you might have some show of ships landing
in the 
<P ALIGN=Center>1990s. One or two. By the time they have landed, be assured
they 
<P ALIGN=Center>will be in complete control. You will start doing crossbreeds
and 
<P ALIGN=Center>more crossbreeds, generation after generation.
<P ALIGN=Center>     "You bribe the government with a few tidbits -- a Star
Wars 
<P ALIGN=Center>system. You tease and tempt the Soviet Union with a laser
system 
<P ALIGN=Center>far finer than any of their own scientists could think of.
And you 
<P ALIGN=Center>always have that subtle inference -- just on the borderline
of 
<P ALIGN=Center>consciousness so that UFOs don't seem to believable, yet
you keep 
<P ALIGN=Center>it couched in secrecy and make it seem quite so insane that
no one 
<P ALIGN=Center>would believe them. On top of it, you would unleash forces
that 
<P ALIGN=Center>would want to kill them [UFO contactees] if they disclosed
that 
<P ALIGN=Center>the CIA is dealing with the exact same things the [contact
victim] 
<P ALIGN=Center>is. 
<P ALIGN=Center>     "Maybe one or two hundred years from now, some of the
Greys 
<P ALIGN=Center>will even physically mingle and you may have some creatures

<P ALIGN=Center>walking around who are pretty much hybrids between Greys
and your 
<P ALIGN=Center>own race. For now, anything that walks around will look much
like 
<P ALIGN=Center>yourselves. It's simpler. It holds down on mass panic.
<P ALIGN=Center>     "Everyone who has experiences with them [Greys] will
be at 
<P ALIGN=Center>odds with the government. To add to that, we will go into
a 
<P ALIGN=Center>complete phased of earthquake after earthquake and upheaval
after 
<P ALIGN=Center>upheaval.
<P ALIGN=Center>     "The inner core of the CIA is deeply controlled by the
Greys. 
<P ALIGN=Center>The CIA sees interaction with the Greys as a path to greater

<P ALIGN=Center>scientific achievement.
<P ALIGN=Center>     "One reason you are seeing so many different kinds of
UFOs is 
<P ALIGN=Center>that other cultures are watching with extreme interest.
Scientists 
<P ALIGN=Center>from other cultures arrive to watch. The Greys have not only
taken 
<P ALIGN=Center>over the intelligence agencies, they have also taken over
what 
<P ALIGN=Center>those agencies call 'lunatic fringe groups.'"
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>*****************************************************************
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     Well, that's what they Nordic had to say. The source
of this 
<P ALIGN=Center>also makes the following commentary:
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     "The ultimate evil is that masked form of psychological

<P ALIGN=Center>complacency that leads one to adhere to a group philosophy
rather 
<P ALIGN=Center>than eke out one's own horizons. As soon as you acquire an

<P ALIGN=Center>awareness of being a so-called 'chosen special group,' you
are on 
<P ALIGN=Center>the way to a fall. That is the seed of destruction in any
society 
<P ALIGN=Center>and any culture and it leaves it vulnerable. It will be the

<P ALIGN=Center>eventual undoing of the Greys as well. They see not their
error -- 
<P ALIGN=Center>it is the very weakness they seize upon that is their own
inherent 
<P ALIGN=Center>weakness. To try and change a Grey, or a cultish type of
'Star 
<P ALIGN=Center>Person,' or a CIA member is futile. It will happen, but all
in its 
<P ALIGN=Center>own good time... it is the spirit that makes anyone stand
up and 
<P ALIGN=Center>disagree with something that is untrue and incorrect that
will be 
<P ALIGN=Center>the thorn in the side of the Greys, and the other forces
that have 
<P ALIGN=Center>allied with them."
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     During the occupation of the Greys, they have established

<P ALIGN=Center>quite a number of underground bases all over the world,
especially 
<P ALIGN=Center>in the United States. One such base (among others in the
same 
<P ALIGN=Center>state) is under Archuleta Mesa, which is about 2.5 miles
northwest 
<P ALIGN=Center>of Dulce, New Mexico. Details about that base have come across
by 
<P ALIGN=Center>way of two sources. The first source is by way of an abduction
of 
<P ALIGN=Center>a woman and her son who witnessed the pickup of a calf for

<P ALIGN=Center>extraction of biological materials.
<P ALIGN=Center>     "In May, 1980, a most interesting case occurred in northern

<P ALIGN=Center>New Mexico. A mother and her son were driving on a rural
highway 
<P ALIGN=Center>near Cimarron when they observed two craft in the process
of 
<P ALIGN=Center>abducting a calf. Both of them were then abducted and taken
on 
<P ALIGN=Center>separate craft to the underground installation, where the
woman 
<P ALIGN=Center>witnessed the mutilation of the calf. It was alleged that
she also 
<P ALIGN=Center>observed vats containing cattle body parts floating in a
liquid, 
<P ALIGN=Center>and another vat containing the body of a male human. The
woman was 
<P ALIGN=Center>subjected to an exam and it was further alleged that small

<P ALIGN=Center>metallic objects were implanted into her body as well as
into her 
<P ALIGN=Center>son's body. More than one source has informed us that catscans

<P ALIGN=Center>have confirmed the presence of these implants."
<P ALIGN=Center>     The above extract is from a transcript of a conversation

<P ALIGN=Center>between Jim McCampbell and Dr. Paul Bennewitz on July 13,
1984. 
<P ALIGN=Center>Bennewitz reports that through regressive hypnosis of the
mother 
<P ALIGN=Center>and child (required only in about 30% of abduction cases)and
his 
<P ALIGN=Center>own follow-up investigation (including communications receive
via 
<P ALIGN=Center>his computer terminal, which are ostensibly from a UFO-related

<P ALIGN=Center>source), he was able to determine the location of the underground

<P ALIGN=Center>facility: a kilometer underground beneath Archuleta Mesa
on the 
<P ALIGN=Center>Jicarilla Apache Indian Reservation near Dulce, New Mexico
(since 
<P ALIGN=Center>1976, one of the area of the U.S. hardest hit by mutilations).

<P ALIGN=Center>Bennewitz' information is that this installation is operated

<P ALIGN=Center>jointly as part of an on-going program of cooperation between
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>U.S. government and EBEs.
<P ALIGN=Center>     There are also underground bases at Kirtland AFB and
Holloman 
<P ALIGN=Center>AFB, as well as at scores of other bases around the world,

<P ALIGN=Center>including Bentwaters, England.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Back to the base under discussion.... After Bennewitz
briefed 
<P ALIGN=Center>Air Force officials on what he had found, a trip to the area

<P ALIGN=Center>revealed the following data:
<P ALIGN=Center>     The base is 2.5 miles northwest of Dulce, and almost

<P ALIGN=Center>overlooks the town. There is a level highway 36 feet wide
going 
<P ALIGN=Center>into the area. It is a government road. One can see telemetry

<P ALIGN=Center>trailers and buildings that are five-sided with a dome. Net
to the 
<P ALIGN=Center>domes, a black limousine was noted -- a CIA vehicle. These
limos 
<P ALIGN=Center>will run you off the road if you try to get into the area.
To the 
<P ALIGN=Center>north there is a launch site. There are two wrecked ships
there; 
<P ALIGN=Center>they are 36 feet long with wings, and one can see oxygen
and 
<P ALIGN=Center>hydrogen tanks. The ships that we got out of the trade are
atomic-
<P ALIGN=Center>powered with plutonium pellets. Refueling of the plutonium
is 
<P ALIGN=Center>accomplished at Los Alamos. The base has been there since
1948.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Some of the disks are piloted by the NSA. The base is
4,000 
<P ALIGN=Center>feet long and helicopters are going in and out of there all
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>time. When it became known that Bennewitz was familiar with
this, 
<P ALIGN=Center>the mutilations in the area stopped. In 1979, something happened

<P ALIGN=Center>and the base was temporarily closed. There was an argument
over 
<P ALIGN=Center>weapons and our people were chased out. The aliens killed
66 of 
<P ALIGN=Center>our people, and 44 got away.
<P ALIGN=Center>     One of the people who in fact got away was a CIA agent
who, 
<P ALIGN=Center>before leaving, made some notes, photos, and videotapes,
and went 
<P ALIGN=Center>into hiding. He has been in hiding ever since, and every
six 
<P ALIGN=Center>months he contacts each of five people he left copies of
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>material with. His instructions were that if he missed four

<P ALIGN=Center>successive contacts, the people could do whatever they want
with 
<P ALIGN=Center>the material.
<P ALIGN=Center>     This agent calls an individual known to MUFON. Somehow,
a 
<P ALIGN=Center>description of the "Dulce Papers" was issued, and was received
in 
<P ALIGN=Center>December, 1987, by many researchers. The "Dulce Papers" were

<P ALIGN=Center>composed of 25 black and white photos, a videotape with no

<P ALIGN=Center>dialogue and a set of papers that included technical information

<P ALIGN=Center>regarding the jointly occupied (U.S.-Alien) facility one
kilometer 
<P ALIGN=Center>beneath the Archuleta Mesa near Dulce, New Mexico. The facility

<P ALIGN=Center>still exists and is currently operational. It is believed
that 
<P ALIGN=Center>there are four additional facilities of the same type, one
being 
<P ALIGN=Center>located a few miles to the southeast of Groom Lake, Nevada.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>****************************************************************
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     "A general description of what these papers contain
is that 
<P ALIGN=Center>they contain documents that discuss copper and molybdenum,
and 
<P ALIGN=Center>papers that discuss magnesium and potassium, but mostly papers

<P ALIGN=Center>about copper. Sheets of paper with charts and strange diagrams.

<P ALIGN=Center>Papers that discuss UV light and gamma rays. These papers
tell 
<P ALIGN=Center>what the aliens are after and how the blood (taken from cattle)
is 
<P ALIGN=Center>used. The aliens seem to absorb atoms to eat. They put their
hands 
<P ALIGN=Center>in blood, sort of like a sponge, for nourishment. It's not
just 
<P ALIGN=Center>food they want; the DNA in cattle and humans is being altered.
The 
<P ALIGN=Center>'Type One' creature is a lab animal. They know how to change
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>atoms to create a temporary 'almost human being.' It is made
with 
<P ALIGN=Center>animal tissue and depends on a computer to simulate memory,
a 
<P ALIGN=Center>memory the computer has withdrawn from another human. Clones.
The 
<P ALIGN=Center>'almost human being' is slow and clumsy. Real humans are
used for 
<P ALIGN=Center>training, to experiment with and to breed with these 'almost

<P ALIGN=Center>humans.' Some humans are kidnapped and used completely. Some
are 
<P ALIGN=Center>kept in large tubes, and are kept alive in an amber liquid.
<P ALIGN=Center>     "Some humans are brainwashed and used to distort the
truth. 
<P ALIGN=Center>Certain male humans have a high sperm count and are kept
alive. 
<P ALIGN=Center>Their sperm is used to alter the DNA and create a non-gender
being 
<P ALIGN=Center>called 'Type Two.' That sperm is grown in some way and altered

<P ALIGN=Center>again, put in wombs. They resemble 'ugly humans' when growing
but 
<P ALIGN=Center>look normal when fully grown, which only takes a few months
from 
<P ALIGN=Center>fetus-size.
<P ALIGN=Center>     "They have a short life span, less than a year. Some
female 
<P ALIGN=Center>humans are used for breeding. Countless women have had a
sudden 
<P ALIGN=Center>miscarriage after about three months' pregnancy. Some never
know 
<P ALIGN=Center>they were pregnant, others remember contact some way. The
fetus is 
<P ALIGN=Center>used to mix the DNA in types one and two. The atomic makeup
in 
<P ALIGN=Center>that fetus is half human, half 'almost human,' and would
not 
<P ALIGN=Center>survive in the mother's womb. It is taken at three months
and 
<P ALIGN=Center>grown elsewhere."
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>****************************************************************
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     Well, that's what the "Dulce Papers" review says. There
are 
<P ALIGN=Center>some pen and ink reproductions of some of the photos made
in the 
<P ALIGN=Center>laboratories (3), an illustration of what one of the wombs
looks 
<P ALIGN=Center>like (2' x 4'), an illustration showing one of the tubes
where one 
<P ALIGN=Center>of the "almost humans" is grown, a page showing a simple
diagram 
<P ALIGN=Center>of crystalline metal, pure gold crystal, and what looks like

<P ALIGN=Center>either a genetic or metallurgical diagram or chart. Also
attached 
<P ALIGN=Center>is what looks like an x-ray diffraction pattern and a diagram
of 
<P ALIGN=Center>hexagonal crystals, with a comment that they are best for

<P ALIGN=Center>electrical conduction.
<P ALIGN=Center>     It would appear that the last half of material in the

<P ALIGN=Center>"review" applies to the supercrystalline metal used for hull

<P ALIGN=Center>structure, or something along that line.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>****************************************************************
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     Obviously, this is all rather bizarre from a certain
point of 
<P ALIGN=Center>view -- any point of view, in fact. Nevertheless, material
that is 
<P ALIGN=Center>supported by years of descriptions and multitudes of 
<P ALIGN=Center>corroborations must mean something, especially when bumped
against 
<P ALIGN=Center>what is seen to be going on.
<P ALIGN=Center>     It is apparent from this and other data that has been

<P ALIGN=Center>accumulated over the years, that there are underground bases
and 
<P ALIGN=Center>tunnel complexes all over the world, and that more are being

<P ALIGN=Center>constructed all the time. Many of you may recall the "Shaver"

<P ALIGN=Center>mysteries and inner-earth city stories. Well, all that is
true. 
<P ALIGN=Center>There are cities down there, amongst other things, and some
of 
<P ALIGN=Center>them have nothing to do with the main subject of this paper.

<P ALIGN=Center>They've been there for a long time.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     Let's change direction for a moment. One individual
by the 
<P ALIGN=Center>name of Lew Tery has been working on some ideas regarding
UFOs and 
<P ALIGN=Center>geomagnetic anomalies. I will go into what he has discovered

<P ALIGN=Center>(although the concept of the relationship is not new) and
let you 
<P ALIGN=Center>judge that for yourself.
<P ALIGN=Center>     After purchasing aeromagnetic and gravitational anomaly
maps 
<P ALIGN=Center>from the United States Geological Survey, it becomes evident
that 
<P ALIGN=Center>there was indeed a valid connection between these areas and
UFOs. 
<P ALIGN=Center>Mr. Tery gave a lecture in Arizona about that relationship,
and 
<P ALIGN=Center>was subsequently harassed by the FBI, and told that the 
<P ALIGN=Center>information is "sensitive." Mr. Tery took the hint and declined
to 
<P ALIGN=Center>talk publicly about it to the degree that he had been doing.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Both the aeromagnetic and gravitational (Bougier Gravity)

<P ALIGN=Center>maps indicate basic field strength, as well as areas of high
and 
<P ALIGN=Center>low field strength. Interestingly enough, the areas of maximum
and 
<P ALIGN=Center>minimum field strength have the following:
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  All have frequent UFO sightings.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  All are either on Indian Reservations, government
<P ALIGN=Center>             land, or the government is trying to buy up
the land.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Many of them, especially where several are clustered
<P ALIGN=Center>             together, are suspected bases areas and/or areas
<P ALIGN=Center>             where mutilations and abductions have historically
<P ALIGN=Center>             taken place.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     In these observations, Mr. Tery has gone far, but he
has gone 
<P ALIGN=Center>a little farther in noting that there are times when the
UFOs are 
<P ALIGN=Center>seen in these areas. Through painstaking research, Mr. Tery
found 
<P ALIGN=Center>that the sightings, as well as many abductions and mutilations,

<P ALIGN=Center>occur:
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  On the new moon or within two days before the
new 
<P ALIGN=Center>             moon.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  On the full moon or within two days before the
full
<P ALIGN=Center>             moon.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  At the perihelion (moon closest to earth) or
within 
<P ALIGN=Center>             two days before the perihelion.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     A glance at the nearest farmers' almanac will give you
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>information you require as far as the days for this year
or any 
<P ALIGN=Center>other one. There seems to be no concrete explanation for
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>coincidence of the times and the events, but it is true.

<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>The Men in Black
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     All things considered, UFO research has become pretty
much of 
<P ALIGN=Center>a circus today, and the most intriguing and controversial
sideshow 
<P ALIGN=Center>skirting the edges is the question of the "silencers," or
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>mysterious "Men in Black." There is a strong subliminal appeal
in 
<P ALIGN=Center>these accounts of visits by mysterious dark-suited figures
(I have 
<P ALIGN=Center>been visited myself, as have others I've known) attempting
to 
<P ALIGN=Center>silence UFO witnesses. A typical situation would be that
a witness 
<P ALIGN=Center>has a UFO sighting or UFO-related experience. Shortly thereafter

<P ALIGN=Center>he is visited by one or more "odd"-looking men who relate
to him 
<P ALIGN=Center>the minutest details of his experience, even though he has
as yet 
<P ALIGN=Center>told no one for fear of ridicule or other reasons.
<P ALIGN=Center>     The men warn him about spreading the story of his experience

<P ALIGN=Center>around and sometimes even threaten him personally, sometimes

<P ALIGN=Center>obliquely, sometimes directly. Any evidence, if it exists,
is 
<P ALIGN=Center>confiscated in one way or another. Sometimes the visit is
for some 
<P ALIGN=Center>totally meaningless reason and the subject of UFOs is hardly

<P ALIGN=Center>mentioned, if at all. But again, the men all seem to look
alike.
<P ALIGN=Center>     We actually seem to find ourselves in close proximity
to 
<P ALIGN=Center>beings who obviously must be directly connected in some way
with 
<P ALIGN=Center>the objects themselves or the source behind them, yet they
seem to 
<P ALIGN=Center>be functioning unobtrusively within the framework of our
own 
<P ALIGN=Center>everyday existence.
<P ALIGN=Center>     The classic conception of an MIB is a man of indefinite
age, 
<P ALIGN=Center>medium height and dressed completely in black. He always
has a 
<P ALIGN=Center>black hat and often a black turtleneck sweater. They present
an 
<P ALIGN=Center>appearance often described as "strange" or "odd." They speak
in a 
<P ALIGN=Center>dull monotone voice, "like a computer," and are dark-complected

<P ALIGN=Center>with high cheekbones, thin lips, pointed chin, and eyes that
are 
<P ALIGN=Center>mildly slanted.
<P ALIGN=Center>     The visitors themselves are often on absurd missions.
They 
<P ALIGN=Center>have reportedly posed as salesmen, telephone repairmen or

<P ALIGN=Center>representatives from official or unofficial organizations.
Their 
<P ALIGN=Center>mode of transportation is usually large and expensive cars
-- 
<P ALIGN=Center>Buicks or Lincolns, sometimes Cadillacs, all black, of course.
<P ALIGN=Center>     I might note at this point that their physical appearance

<P ALIGN=Center>also has included beings that have pale-greyish skin, and
that 
<P ALIGN=Center>some of them have been seen to have blond hair, yet they
wear the 
<P ALIGN=Center>clothing and drive the cars previously described.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Their cars often operate with the headlights off, but
ghostly 
<P ALIGN=Center>purple or greenish glows illuminate the interior. Unusual
insignia 
<P ALIGN=Center>have been seen emblazoned on the doors and the license plates
are 
<P ALIGN=Center>always unidentifiable or untraceable.
<P ALIGN=Center>     The fabric of their clothes has been described as strangely

<P ALIGN=Center>"shiny" or thin, but not silky -- almost as if they have
been cut 
<P ALIGN=Center>from a new type of fabric.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Their often mechanical behavior has caused them to be

<P ALIGN=Center>described by some as being like robots or androids (think
back to 
<P ALIGN=Center>the Dulce lab).
<P ALIGN=Center>     A lot of descriptions of some of these "folks" are pretty

<P ALIGN=Center>bizarre. A businessman's family in Wildwood, New Jersey,
was 
<P ALIGN=Center>visited by an unusually large man whose pants legs hiked
up when 
<P ALIGN=Center>he sat down, revealing a green wire grafted onto his skin
and 
<P ALIGN=Center>running up his leg.
<P ALIGN=Center>     There are other cases of MIB appearing on the other
side of a 
<P ALIGN=Center>wet, muddy field after a heavy rain, but having no mud whatever
on 
<P ALIGN=Center>their brightly shined shoes and in the bitter cold, out of

<P ALIGN=Center>nowhere, wearing only a thin coat. Their shoes and wallets
all 
<P ALIGN=Center>seem new and hardly broken in.
<P ALIGN=Center>     They are not alone. They seem to have faceless conspirators

<P ALIGN=Center>in the nation's post offices and phone companies. Researchers
and 
<P ALIGN=Center>witnesses often report their mail going astray at an unusually

<P ALIGN=Center>high rate and being bothered by bizarre phone calls where
they are 
<P ALIGN=Center>spoken to by metallic, unhuman-sounding voices.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Unusual noises on the phone, intensifying whenever UFOs
are 
<P ALIGN=Center>mentioned, and voices breaking in on conversations, have
all led 
<P ALIGN=Center>many people to suspect that their phones are being tapped.
<P ALIGN=Center>     One can't discuss the MIB for long without mentioning
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>name of John A. Keel, an author who has written much about
them. 
<P ALIGN=Center>Keel has done more than any other writer to publicize this
bizarre 
<P ALIGN=Center>aspect of the UFO situation. Keel suggests that the UFO are
part 
<P ALIGN=Center>of the environment itself and come from another time-space

<P ALIGN=Center>continua; that most of the UFO phenomena is psychic and 
<P ALIGN=Center>psychological rather than physical. Well, I personally would
not 
<P ALIGN=Center>define it that way, although those two components are certainly

<P ALIGN=Center>deeply involved in what's going on.
<P ALIGN=Center>     The first noted appearance of the MIB was in 1947, at
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>scene of the Maury Island incident, where some debris was
ejected 
<P ALIGN=Center>from a disk, and subsequently recovered by officials, who
loaded 
<P ALIGN=Center>them on an Army bomber which crashed on takeoff.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     To illustrate a little how bizarre some of the incidents
are 
<P ALIGN=Center>regarding the MIB, I have assembled a short list of some
of the 
<P ALIGN=Center>more interesting factors in some cases:
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  An ex-Air Force man is gassed and interrogated
by MIB 
<P ALIGN=Center>             after he has learned classified NASA secrets.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Closeup photos of UFOs were seized from a teenager
<P ALIGN=Center>             who is also directly threatened by MIB.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  MIB sighted in the lobby of the U.S. State
Department
<P ALIGN=Center>             leave a mysterious artifact.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  MIB pose as Air Force officers to silence witnesses.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  MIB tries to buy before-hours Coke and sings
to birds
<P ALIGN=Center>             in trees.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  MIB disintegrates a coin in a witness' hand
and tells
<P ALIGN=Center>             him that his heart will do the same if he talks.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>****************************************************************
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     Throughout all this information, I have neglected to
mention 
<P ALIGN=Center>some aspects of the psychology of the Greys. Dr. Paul Bennewitz,

<P ALIGN=Center>in his original report to the government entitled "Project
Beta," 
<P ALIGN=Center>goes into some detail, which I will now discuss:
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  The alien, either through evolvement or because
the
<P ALIGN=Center>             humanoid types are "made," will exhibit tendencies
<P ALIGN=Center>             for bad logic. They appear to have more frailties
<P ALIGN=Center>             and weaknesses than the normal Homo Sapien.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  They are not to be trusted.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Because of the aliens' apparent logic system,
a key
<P ALIGN=Center>             decision cannot be made without higher clearance.
<P ALIGN=Center>             All are under control of what they call "The
Keeper,"
<P ALIGN=Center>             yet it would appear that even this is not the
final
<P ALIGN=Center>             authority. Delays as long as 12-15 hours can
occur
<P ALIGN=Center>             for a decision.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Because of this apparent control, individual
<P ALIGN=Center>             instantaneous decision-making by the alien is

<P ALIGN=Center>             limited. If the "plan" goes even slightly out
of
<P ALIGN=Center>             balance or context, they become confused. Faced
with
<P ALIGN=Center>             this, possibly, the humanoids would be the first
to
<P ALIGN=Center>             run.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Psychologically their morale is near disintegration.
<P ALIGN=Center>             There is pronounced dissension in the ranks
-- even
<P ALIGN=Center>             with the humanoids.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Because of their own internal vulnerability
mind-wise
<P ALIGN=Center>             to each other, there is a basic lack of trust
between
<P ALIGN=Center>             them.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  They appear to be totally death-oriented, and
because
<P ALIGN=Center>             of this, absolutely death-fear oriented. This
is a
<P ALIGN=Center>             psychological advantage.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  The prime, and weakest area discovered, probed
and
<P ALIGN=Center>             tested is exactly what they have used, thinking
it
<P ALIGN=Center>             their key strength -- that being the manipulation
of
<P ALIGN=Center>             and control of the mind. Manipulated in reverse-
<P ALIGN=Center>             psychology they face a situation where they
have a 
<P ALIGN=Center>             vulnerable, integrated weakness.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  They totally respect force.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>****************************************************************
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>Grey Physiology and Anatomy
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     The approximate height of most specimens is between
3.5 and 
<P ALIGN=Center>4.5 feet. The head, by human standards, is large in comparison

<P ALIGN=Center>with the body. Facial features show a pair of eyes described
as 
<P ALIGN=Center>large, sunken or deeply set, far apart or distended more
than the 
<P ALIGN=Center>human, and slightly slanted as Oriental or Mongoloid. No
ear lobes 
<P ALIGN=Center>or apertures on the side of the head were seen. The nose
is vague. 
<P ALIGN=Center>One or tow holes have been mentioned. The mouth area is described

<P ALIGN=Center>as a small slit or fissure. In some cases there is no mouth
at 
<P ALIGN=Center>all. It appears not to function as a means for communication
or 
<P ALIGN=Center>for food. The neck area is described as being thin, in some

<P ALIGN=Center>instances not being visible at all because of the tightly-knit

<P ALIGN=Center>garment. Most observers describe these humanoids as being

<P ALIGN=Center>hairless. Some of the bodies recovered have a slight hair-patch

<P ALIGN=Center>atop the head. Others have what appears to be like a silver

<P ALIGN=Center>skullcap. There were no breathing attachments or communications

<P ALIGN=Center>devices. This suggests telepathy with higher intelligence.
In one 
<P ALIGN=Center>instance there was an opening in the right frontal lobe area,

<P ALIGN=Center>revealing a crystalline network. This network implies the

<P ALIGN=Center>development of a third brain.
<P ALIGN=Center>     The arms are described as long and thin, reaching down
to the 
<P ALIGN=Center>knee section. The hangers each contain four fingers, with
no 
<P ALIGN=Center>thumbs. Three fingers are longer than the other. Some are
very 
<P ALIGN=Center>long. Some are very long. Others are very short. No description
is 
<P ALIGN=Center>available of the legs and feet. Some pathologists indicate
that 
<P ALIGN=Center>that section of the body was not developed as we would
anticipate, 
<P ALIGN=Center>showing that some of these beings were adapted to life in
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>water. There was a webbing effect between the fingers on
most of 
<P ALIGN=Center>the specimens.
<P ALIGN=Center>     According to most observers, the skin is grey. Some
claim it 
<P ALIGN=Center>is beige, tan or pinkish-grey. No reproductive organs or

<P ALIGN=Center>capabilities were discovered. No phallus. No womb. Confirms

<P ALIGN=Center>cloning mentioned by other sources. The humanoids appear
to be 
<P ALIGN=Center>from a mold, sharing identical racial and biological 
<P ALIGN=Center>characteristics. There is no blood as we know it, but there
is a 
<P ALIGN=Center>fluid which is greyish in color.

<P ALIGN=Center>****************************************************************
<P ALIGN=Center> 
<P ALIGN=Center>     
<P ALIGN=Center>     The "Taxonomy of Extra-Terrestrial Humanoids," another

<P ALIGN=Center>offering by George Andrews, yields some other observations:
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Working under the instructions of the humanoids
<P ALIGN=Center>             from Rigel (the Greys), CIA and former Nazi

<P ALIGN=Center>             scientists have developed and deployed malignant
<P ALIGN=Center>             strains of bacteria and viruses, including AIDS,
in
<P ALIGN=Center>             order to exterminate undesirable elements of
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>             human population.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  The Greys are almost entirely devoid of emotions,
<P ALIGN=Center>             but can obtain a "high" by telepathically tuning
in
<P ALIGN=Center>             the different kinds of intense human emotion,
such
<P ALIGN=Center>             as ecstasy or agony. (Does that explain why
UFOs
<P ALIGN=Center>             have always been seen in regions of war and
human
<P ALIGN=Center>             conflict?)
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  There are over 1,000 humans in the United States
<P ALIGN=Center>             alone who are the offspring of intergalactic
or
<P ALIGN=Center>             extragalactic beings and terrestrial humans.
(The
<P ALIGN=Center>             son of an acquaintance of [deleted in original]
<P ALIGN=Center>             is one.)
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Throughout recorded history, as well as during
<P ALIGN=Center>             prehistoric times, there has been constant genetic
<P ALIGN=Center>             manipulation of and interbreeding with humans
in
<P ALIGN=Center>             order to breed out the less evolved simian traits.
<P ALIGN=Center>             The Nordic races have participated in this from
the
<P ALIGN=Center>             beginning, and we are as much a part of them
as we
<P ALIGN=Center>             might suppose.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Greys have the ability to camouflage themselves
as
<P ALIGN=Center>             tall Blonds through mental energy projection.
Blonds
<P ALIGN=Center>             never project themselves as Greys. Some Blonds
seen
<P ALIGN=Center>             with the Greys are physically real, but are

<P ALIGN=Center>             prisoners of the Greys who have either paralyzed

<P ALIGN=Center>             them or have destroyed their ability to teleport
<P ALIGN=Center>             through time and other dimensions. Note: A lot
of
<P ALIGN=Center>             the material obtained by George Andrews has
as its
<P ALIGN=Center>             source a Blond that is a time traveler that
escaped
<P ALIGN=Center>             the Grey takeover of their system.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Both Blonds and Greys have the ability to
<P ALIGN=Center>             disintegrate matter into energy and then
<P ALIGN=Center>             reintegrate the energy back into matter. This
<P ALIGN=Center>             ability allows them to pass through walls and
to
<P ALIGN=Center>             transport abductees out of their cars with the

<P ALIGN=Center>             doors still locked.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  The original Rigelians were the Blonds until
they
<P ALIGN=Center>             were invaded by the Greys, a parasitic race,
who
<P ALIGN=Center>             took over and interbred with them. The original
<P ALIGN=Center>             Rigelians were the ones who seeded the earth.
It
<P ALIGN=Center>             is because of this common ancestry that terrestrial
<P ALIGN=Center>             humanity is of such interest to both the Blonds
and
<P ALIGN=Center>             the Greys.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Terrestrial human females can be impregnated
either
<P ALIGN=Center>             on board ship or while they sleep in their homes.
<P ALIGN=Center>             Males need not be manifested in visible form
for
<P ALIGN=Center>             this to occur.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  The Blonds now habitate the Procyon system.
The
<P ALIGN=Center>             conflict between the Blonds and the Greys is
in a
<P ALIGN=Center>             state of temporary truce, although the conflict
<P ALIGN=Center>             between the Rigelian and the Sirius system is
being
<P ALIGN=Center>             fought actively.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  The Blonds with speech abilities will respond
<P ALIGN=Center>             violently if attacked or threatened, but the
<P ALIGN=Center>             telepathic ones will respond peacefully.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Blonds were sometimes mistaken for angels in
<P ALIGN=Center>             earlier centuries. They do not seem to age,
and
<P ALIGN=Center>             consistently appear to be from 27 to 35 human
years
<P ALIGN=Center>             old.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>****************************************************************
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     Confused? Well, now you can see why the natural diversity
of 
<P ALIGN=Center>the way things are are hard to sort out for the average 
<P ALIGN=Center>researcher. The probability that this information is true
or 
<P ALIGN=Center>partially true remains fairly high, based on analysis of
what we 
<P ALIGN=Center>know about abductions and general contact between humans
and EBEs 
<P ALIGN=Center>that has been documented.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>****************************************************************
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>Real Esoterica -- Sirius and the MIB
<P ALIGN=Center> 
<P ALIGN=Center>     Let's regress for a moment back to the MIB. According
to John 
<P ALIGN=Center>Keel, the MIB often state that they are representatives of
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>"Nation of the Third Eye."
<P ALIGN=Center>     Based on some of the info we have already researched,
it is 
<P ALIGN=Center>apparent that Sirius has been in contact with us for a long
time. 
<P ALIGN=Center>According to George Hunt Williamson (one of the early contactees)

<P ALIGN=Center>in his book "Other Tongues, Other Flesh," the earth allies
of 
<P ALIGN=Center>Sirius, i.e., the secret societies, use the Eye of Horus
as an 
<P ALIGN=Center>insignia. This symbol has also been seen on the MIB. Secret

<P ALIGN=Center>societies believe that there is a Great White Lodge on earth.
They 
<P ALIGN=Center>call it Shamballa -- and consider it to be the spiritual
center of 
<P ALIGN=Center>the world. Now, theosophists such as Alice Bailey say that
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>Great White Lodge is on Sirius. If the All-Seeing-Eye is
a symbol 
<P ALIGN=Center>of Sirius' earth-allies and the MIB wear that symbol, and
if 
<P ALIGN=Center>Shamballa represents the Great White Lodge on earth -- then
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>MIB are emissaries of Shamballa. Sirius and Shamballa are
two 
<P ALIGN=Center>sides of the same coin. This is verified in the book "The

<P ALIGN=Center>Undiscovered Country," by Stephen Jenkins. Jenkins was told
by 
<P ALIGN=Center>Buddhist priests that Shamballa was located in the constellation

<P ALIGN=Center>of Orion.
<P ALIGN=Center>     The entrance to Shamballa on earth is usually placed
in the 
<P ALIGN=Center>trans-Himalayan region. Some assert it is in the heart of
the Gobi 
<P ALIGN=Center>Desert (where there have been allegations of crashed disks
and 
<P ALIGN=Center>bases). According to the explorer Nicholas Roerich, there
are 
<P ALIGN=Center>caves in the Himalayan foothills that have subterranean passages.

<P ALIGN=Center>In one of the these passages, there is a stone door that
has never 
<P ALIGN=Center>been opened, because the time for its opening has not yet
arrived.
<P ALIGN=Center>In 1930, Doreal founded the Brotherhood of the White Temple.
He 
<P ALIGN=Center>says that the entrance to Shamballa is far underground. he
goes on 
<P ALIGN=Center>to say that space bends around Shamballa, and that there
is a warp 
<P ALIGN=Center>which leads into another universe.

<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center> 
<P ALIGN=Center>     Let's get back to something we can have more of a direct

<P ALIGN=Center>handle on. Many times psychics have been called upon by 
<P ALIGN=Center>investigative authorities to evaluate situations, and in
many 
<P ALIGN=Center>cases what they have contributed has been very helpful.
<P ALIGN=Center>     This was done in the case of animal mutilations back
in 1980 
<P ALIGN=Center>by Peter Jordan, who engaged several psychics to render their

<P ALIGN=Center>impressions from photos and maps of mutilations and mutilation

<P ALIGN=Center>areas. What follows is a condensation of what was found during

<P ALIGN=Center>this exercise.

<P ALIGN=Center>****************************************************************
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     Well, there you have that little presentation. I don't
know 
<P ALIGN=Center>what exactly to make of it, but there it is. Certainly a
non-UFO 
<P ALIGN=Center>implication here, however, it only relates to THREE mutilations.

<P ALIGN=Center>How about the other 10,000 -- most of which have the UFO

<P ALIGN=Center>connection? What did I tell you about a multi-level reality?
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>****************************************************************
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     At this point, I will put some references and excerpts
from 
<P ALIGN=Center>some volumes that I believe are relevant to all the things
we've 
<P ALIGN=Center>been talking about. Where I feel it is applicable, I will
comment 
<P ALIGN=Center>on them.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>"The Goblin Universe"
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     (p222) The ability to materialize mental constructs
is not 
<P ALIGN=Center>unknown. Suppose one creates a field with the mind that is
strong 
<P ALIGN=Center>enough to attract supercharged particles. The particles are
real 
<P ALIGN=Center>but unstable in their assemblage since the stability depends
on 
<P ALIGN=Center>the intermediate mental component.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     (p223) Physical aspect of UFOs and other phenomena lie
in the 
<P ALIGN=Center>behavior of electromagnetic fields.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     (p124) If all UFO incidents were chance encounters,
someone 
<P ALIGN=Center>would have obtained a filmed record or a series of stills
years 
<P ALIGN=Center>ago. The only way that such episodes can be engineered so
that 
<P ALIGN=Center>they remain total mysteries is for the entities to have advance

<P ALIGN=Center>knowledge of any situation before it occurs.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     (p117, referencing John Keel) These entities labor to

<P ALIGN=Center>cultivate belief in various frames of reference, and then
they 
<P ALIGN=Center>create new manifestation which support those beliefs.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     (p120) Illness is common after close contact with some

<P ALIGN=Center>beings.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     (p122) Guy Underwood classified primary geomagnetic
currents 
<P ALIGN=Center>into three classes: water lines, aquastats, and track lines.
Some 
<P ALIGN=Center>magnetic signals appear as spirals, others are linear. Gnats
and 
<P ALIGN=Center>flies congregate above magnetic patterns.

<P ALIGN=Center>     
<P ALIGN=Center>     (p2-3) On several occasions after UFOs flew over missile

<P ALIGN=Center>sites, it was found that the targeting of the missiles had

<P ALIGN=Center>changed, and the warheads had to be replaced.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     (p3) On 22 June 1980 a UFO that was 10 miles in diameter
was 
<P ALIGN=Center>reported over the Kuwait oil fields.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     (p4) On July 30, 1985, a UFO over Mongolia that was
10 km in 
<P ALIGN=Center>diameter was reported heading south. It was sighted by a
Chinese 
<P ALIGN=Center>jet and reported in the "Japan Times." The Unites States
ignored 
<P ALIGN=Center>this report.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     (p8) JANAP-146 specifies up to 10 years in prison and
$10,000 
<P ALIGN=Center>in fines for anyone in government service who makes unauthorized

<P ALIGN=Center>public statements about UFO phenomena. The British Official

<P ALIGN=Center>Secrets Act makes similar provisions.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     (p9) Many routes of UFOs take the form of an isosceles

<P ALIGN=Center>triangle.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     (p16) On September 14, 1978, a UFO as big as an ocean
liner 
<P ALIGN=Center>flew over Italy, and over Rome on the 15th and 16th.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Comment: This was two weeks before Pope John Paul I
was found 
<P ALIGN=Center>dead under suspicious circumstances. He was killed between

<P ALIGN=Center>September 28-29. Autopsy was refused. It was rumored he intended

<P ALIGN=Center>to reveal the Fatima message of 1917.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     (p 20) UFOs dart around in daylight at speeds which
cannot be

for 
<P ALIGN=Center>UFO witnesses.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     (p24) Dr. Brian T. Clifford (Pentagon) announces on
October 
<P ALIGN=Center>5, 1982, that contact between U.S. citizens and extraterrestrials

<P ALIGN=Center>on their vehicles is illegal. Title 14, Section 1211 of the
Code 
<P ALIGN=Center>of Federal Regulations (adopted July 16, 1969, before the
first 
<P ALIGN=Center>manned lunar landing) says that anyone guilty of this becomes
a

<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Falls from the sky of flesh, blood, reptiles,
etc.,
<P ALIGN=Center>             were due to either spoiled food or cleaning

<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Comments describe TWO different space races
who share
<P ALIGN=Center>             the planet with us without our knowledge. They
are 
<P ALIGN=Center>             not visitors -- they have been here longer than
we
<P ALIGN=Center>             have. They feel more at ease in the ocean.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  The little men were almost wiped out by a serpent
<P ALIGN=Center>             race identified only as the "S-men." S-men are
<P ALIGN=Center>             ravenous for red meat, extremely materialistic,
and
<P ALIGN=Center>             are greedy for power. Comment: Sounds like the

when 
<P ALIGN=Center>the lights on the helicopter went out, and the only thing
seem on 
<P ALIGN=Center>the ground was a missile silo.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     (p166) About the time mutilations began in earnest (1973

<P ALIGN=Center>wave), a new branch of science was beginning to develop --

<P ALIGN=Center>biogeochemistry -- analysis of mineral and oil deposits by

<P ALIGN=Center>analysis of tissues of herbivorous animals.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     (p168) An elderly lady in Arkansas in 1979 injured herself

<P ALIGN=Center>and was cut during a fall. The injuries were repaired by
two 
<P ALIGN=Center>aliens, who gave her a piece of metal with pyramids and six-
<P ALIGN=Center>pointed stars on it. The aliens told her they "consumed juice,"

<P ALIGN=Center>but not the kind consumed by humans. Six weeks later, she
was out 
<P ALIGN=Center>looking for her dog and spotted a horse lying on its side,

<P ALIGN=Center>unconscious.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Two men in white, dressed like surgeons, were at work
on the 
<P ALIGN=Center>horse. There were two Air Force helicopters parked in the

<P ALIGN=Center>clearing, two men in Air Force uniforms, and the same two
aliens 
<P ALIGN=Center>who had helped her after her fall. The lady was spotted by
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>group and she was overtaken by a helicopter which flashed
a blue 
<P ALIGN=Center>light on her which burned her clothing. Help arrived as the

<P ALIGN=Center>helicopter retreated, and she was brought to the local hospital.

<P ALIGN=Center>People having nothing to do with the hospital staff began
turning 
<P ALIGN=Center>up to question her. After release she was harassed at all
hours by 
<P ALIGN=Center>strangers who insisted on questioning her, repeating the
same 
<P ALIGN=Center>questions over and over again. The couple moved to a different

<P ALIGN=Center>state, only to have it start all over again. MUFON began

<P ALIGN=Center>investigating this case, but as of 1986 had not yet made
public 
<P ALIGN=Center>its conclusions. Research into the case began in 1980.

<P ALIGN=Center>mutilations are highly organized and have a lot of resources."
<P ALIGN=Center> (p172) The theory of biogeochemical basis for the mutilations

<P ALIGN=Center>fails to account for the fact that mutilations are worldwide.
<P ALIGN=Center>

<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     (p200) In an anonymous letter to a Denver paper on April
8, 
<P ALIGN=Center>1983, it was told that the mutilations are being done by
a secret 
<P ALIGN=Center>government group called Delta. Animal parts are used to test

<P ALIGN=Center>effects of germ warfare and poison (cyanide and dioxin) they
are 
<P ALIGN=Center>testing on civilians in America. Testing is associated with
black 
<P ALIGN=Center>helicopters. Helicopters are also used to ferry heroin and

<P ALIGN=Center>cocaine. Delta bases said to be all underground on Indian

<P ALIGN=Center>Reservations. HQ for operations and where a lot of choppers
are 
<P ALIGN=Center>based in 28 miles east of Albuquerque on I-40, then 14 miles
north 
<P ALIGN=Center>on a dirt road into the Laguna Indian Reservation. Comment:

<P ALIGN=Center>Disinformation attempt?
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     (p204, UPI story, February 2, 1984) Dr. James Womack
at
<P ALIGN=Center>Texas A&amp;M University announced his discovery that humans
share 
<P ALIGN=Center>"perfect match" chromosomes with cattle. The perfect match
is with 
<P ALIGN=Center>portions of the 21st chromosome pair, a strand known to carry

<P ALIGN=Center>characteristics of Mongolism or Down's Syndrome, associated
with 
<P ALIGN=Center>mental retardation. Dr. Womack says, "We must have more in
common 
<P ALIGN=Center>than previously believed."
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     (p205, 1984 letter) A recent arrival on the nutritional
scene 
<P ALIGN=Center>is protomorphogens, or glandulars -- ground up glands of
cattle. If 
<P ALIGN=Center>one takes these for a year you get "hooked" on them. Your
own 
<P ALIGN=Center>glands stop producing hormones.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Many EBEs have no alimentary canals and no glands.
<P ALIGN=Center>     In some cancer clinics, these glandulars are used to
treat 
<P ALIGN=Center>cancer victims, and so are glands from human fetuses.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     (p206) What is happening with the mutilations would
make 
<P ALIGN=Center>sense in human terms if the location on which the cattle
grazed 
<P ALIGN=Center>was important, or the parts taken could be used geobiologically

<P ALIGN=Center>(which they aren't).
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     (p208) UFOs are: Extraterrestrial, ultraterrestrial,

<P ALIGN=Center>interdimensional, and time travelers.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     (p208) Some UFOs behave as if the UFO itself was a living

<P ALIGN=Center>organism. Comment: Refer to Trevor James Constable's book
"Sky 
<P ALIGN=Center>Creatures," for a discussion of biological aeroforms, of
"Flying 
<P ALIGN=Center>Saucers at Etibi-Raa," by Wendell Stevens for a discussion
of just 
<P ALIGN=Center>that subject.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     (p208) Entities with cyborg-like traits, having both

<P ALIGN=Center>mechanical and biological features, turn up quite frequently
in 
<P ALIGN=Center>reports.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     (p208) It is odd that among the viruses there are some
that 
<P ALIGN=Center>look like UFOs, like T. Bacteriophage. Do some UFO have the

<P ALIGN=Center>ability to operate in the micro-dimension of viruses? Comment:
In 
<P ALIGN=Center>the discipline of Yoga is noted the ability to become large
or 
<P ALIGN=Center>small.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     (p209) Anyone with more access to even one more dimension

<P ALIGN=Center>than we have access to could evade our most carefully planned

<P ALIGN=Center>investigations indefinitely.

<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>            The last two appeared quite suddenly.
<P ALIGN=Center>     
<P ALIGN=Center>     (p210) Theory of Max H. Flindt attributes paradoxically
rapid 
<P ALIGN=Center>development of the human brain to interbreeding between primitive

<P ALIGN=Center>humanity and ETs.
<P ALIGN=Center>     According to Flindt, schizophrenia is caused by subconscious

<P ALIGN=Center>racial memory of the ET branch of the family tree, longing
for 
<P ALIGN=Center>home. Considerable differences between glandular and nervous

<P ALIGN=Center>systems between primitive humans and ETs would provide a
basis for 
<P ALIGN=Center>traumatic tension associated with regressed memory.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     (p210) Our civilization has forgotten the existence
of other 
<P ALIGN=Center>intelligent beings in the universe.

<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>Well, as if this weren't enough, let's examine the basic

<P ALIGN=Center>allegations that were raised by Gary Stollman when he held
an 
<P ALIGN=Center>empty BB gun to David Horowitz on KNBC Channel 4, Los Angeles,
in 
<P ALIGN=Center>October, 1987. Gary clearly though that he was alone in his

<P ALIGN=Center>knowledge, and evidently turned to desperation to have the
public 
<P ALIGN=Center>become aware of what he knew. For the sake of brevity, I
will 
<P ALIGN=Center>simply summarize the allegations, and make comments where
I wish 
<P ALIGN=Center>to do so:
<P ALIGN=Center> 
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  His physical father is in fact a clone created
by
<P ALIGN=Center>             the CIA and alien forces.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Cloning is a part of a plot to overthrow the
U.S
<P ALIGN=Center>             government.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  The CIA maintains mental-retraining hospitals.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Phones were turned off at Rohlman Psychiatric

<P ALIGN=Center>             Hospital in Cincinnati for 48 hours after his
<P ALIGN=Center>             arrival.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  A former CIA official had an interview on KPFK
radio
<P ALIGN=Center>             in which he told a college audience that the
CIA has 
<P ALIGN=Center>             towed barges across New York Harbor that were
<P ALIGN=Center>             disease-ridden.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  The CIA may have created the AIDS virus to wipe
out
<P ALIGN=Center>             the gay population. Comment: Hmmm, where have
we
<P ALIGN=Center>             heard THAT before?
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  The CIA assassinated John F. Kennedy and the
22
<P ALIGN=Center>             material witnesses who died with two years.
Comment:
<P ALIGN=Center>             Hmmmm, I have heard that as well.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  He demands that the Air Force release all
<P ALIGN=Center>             information on UFOs.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  He demands that the information about Hanger
18 at
<P ALIGN=Center>             Wright-Patterson [AFB] be released.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  He relates that he spoke to a girl at Florida
Junior
<P ALIGN=Center>             College who told him that seven of her friends
had
<P ALIGN=Center>             been "replaced."
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  The CIA doesn't trust people on computers.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  Individuals at the Optimist Boys School in Pasadena
<P ALIGN=Center>             were recruited by others and given false IDs
and
<P ALIGN=Center>             birth certificates.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  There is a secret group led by the President's
own
<P ALIGN=Center>             staff.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  There are beings around with the power to teleport
<P ALIGN=Center>             instantly and do the same to others; who can
read
<P ALIGN=Center>             and control minds, and transform matter into
other
<P ALIGN=Center>             forms and create it at will.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  He asks for a congressional investigation and
<P ALIGN=Center>             federal protection.
<P ALIGN=Center>          o  He states that he cannot harm anyone with an
empty
<P ALIGN=Center>             BB gun.

<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     For some of you who keep an eye on the news, the President
<P ALIGN=Center>(Reagan) has said some mighty interesting things in some
speeches
<P ALIGN=Center>of his:
<P ALIGN=Center> 
<P ALIGN=Center>To the students of Fallston High School in Fallston, Maryland,
on 
<P ALIGN=Center>December 4, 1985, he said:
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     "I couldn't but -- one point in our discussions with
General 
<P ALIGN=Center>Secretary Gorbachev -- when you stop to think that we're
all God's 
<P ALIGN=Center>children, wherever we may live in the world, I couldn't help
but 
<P ALIGN=Center>say to him, just think how easy his task and mine might be
in 
<P ALIGN=Center>these meetings that we held if suddenly there was a threat
to this 
<P ALIGN=Center>world from some other species from another planet outside
in the 
<P ALIGN=Center>universe. We'd forget all the little local differences that
we 
<P ALIGN=Center>have between our countries and we would find out once and
for all 
<P ALIGN=Center>that we really are all human beings on this earth together.
<P ALIGN=Center>     "Well, I don't suppose we can wait for some alien race
to 
<P ALIGN=Center>come down and threaten us...."
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>To the 42nd General Assembly of the United Nations, September
21, 
<P ALIGN=Center>1987:
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     "In our obsession with antagonisms of the moment, we
often 
<P ALIGN=Center>forget how much unites all the members of humanity. Perhaps
we 
<P ALIGN=Center>need some outside universal threat to make us recognize this

<P ALIGN=Center>common bond. I occasionally think how quickly our differences

<P ALIGN=Center>worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat
from 
<P ALIGN=Center>outside this world. And yet, I ask you, is not an alien force

<P ALIGN=Center>already among us? What could be more alien to the universal

<P ALIGN=Center>aspirations of our peoples than war and the threat of war?"

<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>General Types of Entities
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>The Greys are known to be of three types:
<P ALIGN=Center>     
<P ALIGN=Center>o  Grey 1: 3.5 feet tall. Large head. Large slanted eyes.
Worship 
<P ALIGN=Center>           Technology and don't care about us. Type popularized
in
<P ALIGN=Center>           "Communion" by Strieber.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>o  Grey 2: Same general appearance, although has a different
<P ALIGN=Center>           finger arrangement and a slightly different face.
<P ALIGN=Center>           More sophisticated than Grey 1. They possess a
degree
<P ALIGN=Center>           of common sense and are somewhat passive. It is
not 
<P ALIGN=Center>           known if they require the secretions needed by
Grey 1.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>o  Grey 3: Same basic type. Lips thinner. Subservient to
other
<P ALIGN=Center>           two types.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>Other entities known to frequent this planet:
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>o  Blonds/Swedes/Nordics: Known by any of these names. Similar
to 
<P ALIGN=Center>           us. Blond hair, blue eyes. Will not break law
of non-
<P ALIGN=Center>           interference to help us. Would only intervene
if the 
<P ALIGN=Center>           Greys' activity would affect other parts of the
<P ALIGN=Center>           universe.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>o Interdimensional: Entities that can assume a variety of
shapes.
<P ALIGN=Center>           Basically of a peaceful nature.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>o Short Humanoids: 1.5 to 2.5 feet tall, skin bluish in color.
<P ALIGN=Center>           Seen quite frequently in Mexico near Chihuahua.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>o Hairy Dwarfs: 4 feet tall. Weigh about 35 pounds. Hairy.
<P ALIGN=Center>           Neutral. Respect intelligent life.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>o Very Tall Race: Look like us but 7-8 feet tall. United
with
<P ALIGN=Center>           the Swedes.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>o Nordic Clones: Appear similar to us but with grey tinge
to their 
<P ALIGN=Center>           skin. These are drones created by the Greys. Child-
<P ALIGN=Center>           like mentality.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>o Men-In-Black (MIB): Oriental or olive-skinned. Eyes sensitive
to 
<P ALIGN=Center>           light. Eyes have vertical pupils. Very pale skin
in 
<P ALIGN=Center>           some types. Do not conform easily to our social

<P ALIGN=Center>           patterns. Usually wear black clothes, drive black
cars, 
<P ALIGN=Center>           and wear sunglasses. In groups they all dress
alike.
<P ALIGN=Center>           Sometimes time-disoriented. they cannot handle
a
<P ALIGN=Center>           psychological "curve-ball" or interruption to
their
<P ALIGN=Center>           plan. Often intimidate UFO witnesses and impersonate
<P ALIGN=Center>           government officials. Equivalent of our CIA. From

<P ALIGN=Center>           another galaxy.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>Although there are some 40 or more known types of aliens
visiting 
<P ALIGN=Center>our world at the present time, these are the most commonly
seen 
<P ALIGN=Center>types.

<P ALIGN=Center>Extract of information from: "UFO Contact from Undersea,"

<P ALIGN=Center>Sanchez/Stevens
<P ALIGN=Center> 
<P ALIGN=Center>Section 1: Regression session, Filiberto Cardenas (subject)
<P ALIGN=Center>           Event date: 3 January 1979 UFO CEIII
<P ALIGN=Center>           During the regression session(s) the following

<P ALIGN=Center>           information came forth:
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>1. Subject was taken to one of three pyramid bases. Two pyramid

<P ALIGN=Center>bases are under ocean, one on land. Subject was taken to
base 
<P ALIGN=Center>between Berin and Santiago of the coast of Chile. Other
underwater 
<P ALIGN=Center>base is in the Atlantic in an unspecified location. The base
was
<P ALIGN=Center>entered through an underwater tunnel. The aliens stated that
they 
<P ALIGN=Center>had been there 36 months at that time.
<P ALIGN=Center>2. Aliens told the subject that there were six (6) other

<P ALIGN=Center>individuals whom the aliens had contacted.
<P ALIGN=Center>3. Subject stated that the aliens voiced that they were
eventually 
<P ALIGN=Center>going to make themselves known to the world.
<P ALIGN=Center>4. Aliens stated that they control the Chinese, and they
have 
<P ALIGN=Center>provided the Chinese with a device that can "paralyze cities
and 
<P ALIGN=Center>towns completely."
<P ALIGN=Center>5. Aliens stated that the device will cause a change that
"is 
<P ALIGN=Center>going to be something for which the world cannot wait." The

<P ALIGN=Center>Chinese are to provoke certain unspecified changes, and that
in 
<P ALIGN=Center>those changes, "people who are negative will disappear."
<P ALIGN=Center>6. Subject remembers seeing (future) scenes of people running

<P ALIGN=Center>disoriented along roads, and that there is a disaster coming.

<P ALIGN=Center>7. Details of underwater tunnel described as walls of " firmed

<P ALIGN=Center>water," not rock. The ship evidently generated a force field
which 
<P ALIGN=Center>repelled the water around it.
<P ALIGN=Center>8. Devices were supposedly installed in subject's head by
aliens. 
<P ALIGN=Center>Subsequent x-rays revealed nothing.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>(Session 3)
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>1. First contact with these groups of aliens began 4,000
years 
<P ALIGN=Center>ago.
<P ALIGN=Center>2. It has been thousands of years since this group last descended

<P ALIGN=Center>to earth.
<P ALIGN=Center>3. If progress on earth does not continue, aliens will use
more 
<P ALIGN=Center>forceful demonstrations to get their point across that we
must 
<P ALIGN=Center>have peace and progress.
<P ALIGN=Center>4. Subject was interrogated for 15 days after the events
by US 
<P ALIGN=Center>security and intelligence services.
<P ALIGN=Center>5. Information from aliens had also to do with "an atrocity
in the 
<P ALIGN=Center>plans certain forces on earth had planned."
<P ALIGN=Center>6. Subject was seven years old when contact with aliens first

<P ALIGN=Center>occurred.
<P ALIGN=Center>7. Aliens have ability to dematerialize their craft.
<P ALIGN=Center>8. Aliens stated that we should beware of other alien groups
who 
<P ALIGN=Center>will present themselves in a good light but if they pursue
"bad 
<P ALIGN=Center>objectives against us they could do two things. They could
destroy 
<P ALIGN=Center>this planet with the same arms that this planet has, or on
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>contrary, transport away all our arms in one operation, which

<P ALIGN=Center>would take no more than 20 minutes of our time. They can
be 
<P ALIGN=Center>visible or not, whatever they choose."
<P ALIGN=Center>8. [sic] Treatise references 81 other crossbreeds from (negative)

<P ALIGN=Center>aliens who have performed duties on earth. Half alien-half

<P ALIGN=Center>earthling = Crossbreed
<P ALIGN=Center>9. Aliens spoke of great portions of land and whole cities
will 
<P ALIGN=Center>[sic] disappear. Mexico City and major cities in California.

<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>History and Operations -- Operation Trojan Horse
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     The amusing little mystery of flying saucers slowly
evolves 
<P ALIGN=Center>into a complicated series of coincidences and paradoxes as
we 
<P ALIGN=Center>plunge deeper and deeper into the data, excluding nothing,
and 
<P ALIGN=Center>considering everything as objectively as possible.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Our skies have been filled with "Trojan Horses" throughout

<P ALIGN=Center>history, and like the original Trojan Horse, the SEEM to
conceal 
<P ALIGN=Center>hostile intent.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Several facts are now apparent:
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     o  The objects have always chosen to operate in a
<P ALIGN=Center>        clandestine manner, furtively choosing the hours
of
<P ALIGN=Center>        darkness for their enigmatic activities over thinly-
<P ALIGN=Center>        populated areas, where the possibility of being detected
<P ALIGN=Center>        is slight.
<P ALIGN=Center>     o  The hostility factor is further supported by the
fact
<P ALIGN=Center>        that the objects chose, most often, to appear in
forms
<P ALIGN=Center>        which we can readily accept and explain to our own
<P ALIGN=Center>        satisfaction -- ranging from dirigibles to meteors
and
<P ALIGN=Center>        conventional-appearing airplanes.
<P ALIGN=Center>     o  The objects of unusual configuration, undoubtedly
<P ALIGN=Center>        constituting a deceptive minority of all the
<P ALIGN=Center>        paraphysical objects flitting about in our atmosphere.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     In other words, flying saucers are not at all what we
have 
<P ALIGN=Center>hoped they were. They are a part of something else. John
A. Keel
<P ALIGN=Center>called that something else "Operation Trojan Horse."
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     When one really digs into UFO literature, it readily
becomes 
<P ALIGN=Center>clear that the ultraterrestrials deliberately conveyed whatever

<P ALIGN=Center>impression that would meet the available frame of reference
for 
<P ALIGN=Center>that time.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Until 1848, the religious frame of reference was constantly

<P ALIGN=Center>used by the phenomenon. As man's technology improved many
of our 
<P ALIGN=Center>old beliefs were discarded and the "phenomenon" was obliged
to 
<P ALIGN=Center>update its manifestations and establish new frames of reference.

<P ALIGN=Center>No more objects were seen in 1947 than had been seen in 1847.
We 
<P ALIGN=Center>were simply seeing them in a new way. A new game was being
played 
<P ALIGN=Center>with us.
<P ALIGN=Center>     A new game has emerged: the artifact or hardware game.
The 
<P ALIGN=Center>phenomenon has always obliged us by planting false evidence
all 
<P ALIGN=Center>over the landscape.
<P ALIGN=Center>     UFO cultists trapped themselves into a hopeless situation

<P ALIGN=Center>almost from the outset. The apparent purpose of most of the

<P ALIGN=Center>landings seems to have been to advance belief in the frame
of 
<P ALIGN=Center>reference, not to provide absolute proof that the frame of

<P ALIGN=Center>reference is authentic.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>Physical Evidence
<P ALIGN=Center>     
<P ALIGN=Center>     All kinds of junk have fallen out of the sky throughout

<P ALIGN=Center>recorded history. Ivan T. Sanderson has in his files extensive

<P ALIGN=Center>lists that go back to Roman times. Ridiculous things such
as stone 
<P ALIGN=Center>pillars and heavy metal wheels have come crashing out of
the blue, 
<P ALIGN=Center>and there are countless cases of ice blocks, some weighing

<P ALIGN=Center>hundreds of pounds, dropping all over this planet. The flying

<P ALIGN=Center>saucers have been spewing all kinds of trash all over the

<P ALIGN=Center>landscape. In nearly every instance, these materials always
prove 
<P ALIGN=Center>to be ordinary earthly substances like magnesium, aluminum,

<P ALIGN=Center>chromium, and even plain old tin. Each of these incidents
give the 
<P ALIGN=Center>skeptics new ammunition.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Mysterious hollow spheres have also been dropping out
of the 
<P ALIGN=Center>sky all over the world. Three such spheres were found in
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>Australian desert in 1963. They were about 14 inches in diameter

<P ALIGN=Center>and had a shiny polished surface. Efforts to open the spheres

<P ALIGN=Center>failed, and they were turned over to the USAF. Other metal
spheres 
<P ALIGN=Center>have dropped out of the sky in Mexico (1967) and Conway,
Arkansas 
<P ALIGN=Center>(1967). The Mexican steel ball was identified as titanium,
the one 
<P ALIGN=Center>in Arkansas steel.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Smaller colored spheres were found scattered over the
French 
<P ALIGN=Center>countryside in 1966-67, as if it had been raining balls there.

<P ALIGN=Center>Where is all this stuff coming from? The same place as the
stone 
<P ALIGN=Center>pillars and blocks of ice. Innumerable cases of contact and

<P ALIGN=Center>landings have been flushed down the ufological drain because
of 
<P ALIGN=Center>the deliberate "negative factors." Sincere witnesses have
actually 
<P ALIGN=Center>been ruined because the amateur UFO investigators have accused

<P ALIGN=Center>them of being liars and worse.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Another fascinating game which the ufonauts play with
a 
<P ALIGN=Center>vengeance is the "repair" gambit. Beginning in 1897, there
has 
<P ALIGN=Center>been an endless stream of stories and reports, many from
reliable 
<P ALIGN=Center>witnesses, on how they encountered a grounded UFO and observed
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>occupants making repairs of some kind. The basic details
in all 
<P ALIGN=Center>these stories are so similar that it seems as if the ufonauts
are 
<P ALIGN=Center>following a carefully rehearsed procedure.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Generally speaking, there are three (3) types of beings

<P ALIGN=Center>observed in relation to UFOs:
<P ALIGN=Center>     o  Normal-looking people, including females.
<P ALIGN=Center>     o  Oriental, dark-skinned beings.
<P ALIGN=Center>     o  Unidentifiable creatures, who have made a real effort
to
<P ALIGN=Center>        hide from witnesses.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Oddly enough, when all the reports and the data is in,
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>scope of the phenomenon and the overwhelming quantity of
reports 
<P ALIGN=Center>negates its validity. An analysis of cases indicates that
flying 
<P ALIGN=Center>saucers are not, in most cases, stable machines requiring
fuel, 
<P ALIGN=Center>maintenance, and logistical support. Most of them are, in
all 
<P ALIGN=Center>probability, transmutations of energy from other dimensions
and do 
<P ALIGN=Center>not exist in the same way that this paper exists.
<P ALIGN=Center>     The UFO phenomenon seems to be largely subjective: that
is, 
<P ALIGN=Center>specific kinds of people become involved and are actually

<P ALIGN=Center>manipulated by the phenomenon in the same way that it manipulates

<P ALIGN=Center>matter. These subjective experiences are far more important
to our 
<P ALIGN=Center>study that the "random" superficial sightings. We are obliged
to 
<P ALIGN=Center>forget about the sightings and concentrate on the claims
and 
<P ALIGN=Center>experiences of the contactees.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     Thousands of UFO photos have been taken since 1882.
There's 
<P ALIGN=Center>just one problem. With very few exceptions, no two UFO photos
are 
<P ALIGN=Center>alike. The sightings force two unacceptable answers upon
us:
<P ALIGN=Center>     o  All the witnesses were mistaken or lying.
<P ALIGN=Center>     o  Some tremendous unknown civilization is exerting
an all-
<P ALIGN=Center>        out effort to manufacture thousands of different
types of
<P ALIGN=Center>        UFOs and is sending them all to our planet.
<P ALIGN=Center>     The governments of the world overtly have maintained

<P ALIGN=Center>variations of the first proposal. UFO enthusiasts accept
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>second. There is a third proposal which merits some attention:

<P ALIGN=Center>some "hard" objects definitely exist as temporary
materializations 
<P ALIGN=Center>from other dimensions. They leave indentations in the ground
when 
<P ALIGN=Center>they land. Witnesses have touched them and even been inside
them. 
<P ALIGN=Center>These "hard" objects may be decoys to cover the multitudinous

<P ALIGN=Center>activities of the "soft" objects. The "soft" objects hold
one of 
<P ALIGN=Center>the keys of the mystery. There are countless sightings of
objects 
<P ALIGN=Center>which changed size and shape in front of witnesses who often
get 
<P ALIGN=Center>the impression that it was alive, that it was not behaving
like a 
<P ALIGN=Center>mechanical object at all.
<P ALIGN=Center>     There is no question at all that there are intelligences
that 
<P ALIGN=Center>can manipulate or materialize any kind of object into our

<P ALIGN=Center>dimension. Let's take a look, for a second, at the
electromagnetic 
<P ALIGN=Center>spectrum. As you know, our visual spectrum makes up a small

<P ALIGN=Center>portion of the whole. Look at what's involved with UFOs:
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>Ultraviolet
<P ALIGN=Center>Blue        UFO ENTRY FIELD    _________________
<P ALIGN=Center>Cyan        ____________________________________
<P ALIGN=Center>Green                           Visible
<P ALIGN=Center>Yellow                            
<P ALIGN=Center>Red         __________________  Spectrum     
<P ALIGN=Center>Magenta                        _________________
<P ALIGN=Center>Infra-red   UFO DEPARTURE
<P ALIGN=Center>Heat           FIELD
<P ALIGN=Center>Radio
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     If you will relate this to cases that you are familiar
with, 
<P ALIGN=Center>as far as appearance, spectrum shift when in flight, etc.,
you 
<P ALIGN=Center>will see the applicability of the above diagram.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     When UFO stabilize in our dimension they radiate energy
on 
<P ALIGN=Center>all frequencies and become glowing white. Radical maneuvers

<P ALIGN=Center>require a frequency alteration, which produces color changes.
It 
<P ALIGN=Center>is interesting to note that in Blue Book Report #14, they
replaced 
<P ALIGN=Center>the phrase "Electromagnetic Phenomenon" with the word "Unknown"
in 
<P ALIGN=Center>a majority of those cases. Why? There is no doubt that again,
a 
<P ALIGN=Center>situation exists where we have multiple realities within
the UFO 
<P ALIGN=Center>realm as well. It is clear that we are not dealing with random
ET 
<P ALIGN=Center>visitors. It has an extreme element of intention to do with
all of 
<P ALIGN=Center>it. Mutilations started in April, 1897, with the abduction
of 
<P ALIGN=Center>Alexander Hamilton's calf, witnessed by several people. That
is 
<P ALIGN=Center>one of the constants that has been with us that has not changed

<P ALIGN=Center>frame of reference. How many people give thought to the three

<P ALIGN=Center>dark-skinned wise men who appeared before the birth of Jesus,

<P ALIGN=Center>spread the reality of the happening, and disappeared again.
All 
<P ALIGN=Center>the dark-skinned men in threes. MIB. It makes you wonder.
Hmmmm.
<P ALIGN=Center>Charting the Enigma
<P ALIGN=Center>     
<P ALIGN=Center>     Well, here we are again. Taking a sample of 33% of 10,000
or 
<P ALIGN=Center>so cases, or about 3,330 cases, we find that 730 are so-called

<P ALIGN=Center>Type I, a low-level object observed and reported by reliable

<P ALIGN=Center>witnesses. It was found that 2,600 were Type II, high-altitude

<P ALIGN=Center>objects performing in a controlled manner and distinct from
normal 
<P ALIGN=Center>aircraft and natural phenomena. The time of the sightings
depends 
<P ALIGN=Center>on where you are. If you are in a rural area, sightings 
<P ALIGN=Center>conveniently begin after 10 p.m. A populated area would have
them 
<P ALIGN=Center>between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. For some reason, in many "flaps,"

<P ALIGN=Center>Wednesday had about 20.5% of the sightings. Hmmm.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Now, if the UFO phenomenon (and I dislike that word)
had a 
<P ALIGN=Center>purely psychic basis then I would think there would be more

<P ALIGN=Center>sightings on a Saturday, when people are statistically out
and 
<P ALIGN=Center>about than on Wednesday. There are notable exceptions to

<P ALIGN=Center>everything of course, one of which was the "flap" of August
16, 
<P ALIGN=Center>1966, which was on a Tuesday.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Reports seem to cluster within political boundaries
of 
<P ALIGN=Center>states, as if there were a methodical exploration of states
from 
<P ALIGN=Center>border to border. If the UFO were a natural occurrence, one
would 
<P ALIGN=Center>expect otherwise.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Thousands of sightings can be fitted into the "great
circle" 
<P ALIGN=Center>route, and often the dates are staggered so that it appears
that 
<P ALIGN=Center>the phenomenon moves systematically from point to point.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Every state in the United States has from two to ten

<P ALIGN=Center>"windows." These are areas where UFOs appear repeatedly year
after 
<P ALIGN=Center>year. The objects will appear in these places and pursue
courses 
<P ALIGN=Center>confined to sectors with a radius of about 200 miles. The
great 
<P ALIGN=Center>circle from Canada (not to be confused with the traditional
Great 
<P ALIGN=Center>Circle) in the northwest through the central states and back
into 
<P ALIGN=Center>northeast Canada is a major window. Hundreds of smaller windows
<P ALIGN=Center>lie within that circle. Another major window is centered
in the
<P ALIGN=Center>Gulf of Mexico and encompasses much of Mexico, Texas and
the
<P ALIGN=Center>Southwest. 
<P ALIGN=Center>     As mentioned previously, many windows center directly
over 
<P ALIGN=Center>area of magnetic deviation.
<P ALIGN=Center>     UFOs seem to congregate about the highest available
hills in 
<P ALIGN=Center>these window areas. They become visible in these centers
and then 
<P ALIGN=Center>radiate outward, traveling sometimes 100-200 miles before

<P ALIGN=Center>disappearing again.
<P ALIGN=Center> 
<P ALIGN=Center>****************************************************************
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     Among the great heaps of neglected and ignored UFO data,
we 
<P ALIGN=Center>find hundreds of "minipeople" accounts. These are very rarely

<P ALIGN=Center>published anywhere because they tend to be so unbelievable.
Most of 
<P ALIGN=Center>them are identical to the fairy and gnome stories of yesteryear.

<P ALIGN=Center>Witnesses to these events can experience conjunctivitis,
akinesia 
<P ALIGN=Center>(paralysis), amnesia, and the other effects often noted by

<P ALIGN=Center>witnesses to more conventional events. One notable event
is one 
<P ALIGN=Center>that occurred in Seattle, Washington, in the latter part
of 
<P ALIGN=Center>August, 1965. A woman awoke around 2 a.m. and discovered
she could 
<P ALIGN=Center>not move a muscle or make a sound. Her window was open, and

<P ALIGN=Center>suddenly a tiny, football-sized dull-grey object floated
through 
<P ALIGN=Center>the window and hovered over the carpet near her bed. Three
legs 
<P ALIGN=Center>lowered from the object and it settled to the floor. A small
ramp 
<P ALIGN=Center>extended from it and five or six tiny people clambered out
and 
<P ALIGN=Center>seemed to work on some kind of repairs on the object. They
wore 
<P ALIGN=Center>tight-fitting clothing. When they were finished, they got
in and 
<P ALIGN=Center>the object took off and sailed out the window. At that point,
she 
<P ALIGN=Center>was able to move. The case was investigated by J. Russell
Jenkins 
<P ALIGN=Center>of Seattle.
<P ALIGN=Center>     You can readily see why almost none of these kinds of
stories 
<P ALIGN=Center>ever appear in print, except in occult-oriented literature.

<P ALIGN=Center>Nevertheless, if we hope to assess the true UFO situation,
we must 
<P ALIGN=Center>examine all these stories. We can learn nothing by considering

<P ALIGN=Center>only those incidents which are emotionally and intellectually

<P ALIGN=Center>acceptable to us.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>****************************************************************
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     TIME is one of the most important aspects of the UFO
thing. 
<P ALIGN=Center>It plays a strange but significant role. Part of the answer
may 
<P ALIGN=Center>not lie in the stars but in the clock ticking on your fireplace.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Our world exists in three dimensions. We can move in
many 
<P ALIGN=Center>directions within these dimensions. Space does not exist
except 
<P ALIGN=Center>when we make it exist. To us, the distance between atoms
in our 
<P ALIGN=Center>matter is so minute that it can only be calculated with 
<P ALIGN=Center>hypothetical measurements. Yet, if we lived on an atom, and
our 
<P ALIGN=Center>size was relative to its size, the distance to the next atom
would 
<P ALIGN=Center>seem awesome.
<P ALIGN=Center>     There is another man-made measurement called time. Unlike
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>other three dimensions, time has us seemingly trapped. Time

<P ALIGN=Center>becomes very real to us, and it appears that we couldn't
live 
<P ALIGN=Center>without it. Yet time doesn't really exist at all. This moment

<P ALIGN=Center>exists to us. Does this mean the same moment is being shared
by 
<P ALIGN=Center>other planets?
<P ALIGN=Center>     The UFO phenomenon does seem to be controlled. It does
follow 
<P ALIGN=Center>intelligent patterns. If the objects themselves are
manifestations 
<P ALIGN=Center>of higher energies, then something has to manipulate those

<P ALIGN=Center>energies somehow and reduce them to the visible frequencies.
Not 
<P ALIGN=Center>only do they enter the visible frequencies, but they take
forms 
<P ALIGN=Center>which seem physical and real to us, and they carry out actions

<P ALIGN=Center>which seem to be intelligent.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Thus we arrive at the source. The source has to be a
form of 
<P ALIGN=Center>intelligent energy operating at the highest possible point
of the 
<P ALIGN=Center>frequency spectrum. If such an energy exists at all, it might

<P ALIGN=Center>permeate the universe and maintain equal control of each

<P ALIGN=Center>component part. Because of its very high frequency, so high
that 
<P ALIGN=Center>the energy particles are virtually standing still, the source
has 
<P ALIGN=Center>no need to replenish itself in any way that would be acceptable
to 
<P ALIGN=Center>our environmental sciences. It could actually create and
destroy 
<P ALIGN=Center>matter by manipulating the lower energies. It would be timeless,

<P ALIGN=Center>because it exists beyond all time fields. It would be infinite

<P ALIGN=Center>because it is not confined by three-dimensional "space."
<P ALIGN=Center>     Children. Children figure neatly into this, and they
always 
<P ALIGN=Center>have. The child's mind, especially before the so-called age
of 
<P ALIGN=Center>reason when the logic circuits begin to form, is a clear

<P ALIGN=Center>instrument, open and uninfluenced by opinions and conclusions.

<P ALIGN=Center>This is an important point in the UFO mystery.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Perhaps if we were in a pure energy state, each particle
of 
<P ALIGN=Center>energy would itself serve as a synapse, and information could
be 
<P ALIGN=Center>stored by a slight alteration in frequency. All the memory

<P ALIGN=Center>fragments of a rose, for example, would be recorded at one

<P ALIGN=Center>frequency, and the whole energy form could tune into that
memory 
<P ALIGN=Center>by adjusting frequencies, as we might adjust a radio receiver.
In 
<P ALIGN=Center>other words, no complex circuitry would be required. No body
would 
<P ALIGN=Center>be necessary. The energy patterns would not need material
form. It 
<P ALIGN=Center>would permeate the entire universe. It could surround you

<P ALIGN=Center>completely at this very moment and be aware of all the feeble

<P ALIGN=Center>impulses of low energy passing through your brain. If it
so 
<P ALIGN=Center>desired, it could control those pulses and thus control your

<P ALIGN=Center>thoughts. Man has always been aware of this intelligent energy
or 
<P ALIGN=Center>force. He has always worshipped it.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     Our first conclusion is that the UFOs originate from
beyond 
<P ALIGN=Center>our own time frame or time cycle. Our second conclusion is
that 
<P ALIGN=Center>the source has total foreknowledge of human events and even
of 
<P ALIGN=Center>individual lives. Since time and space are not absolutes,
these 
<P ALIGN=Center>two conclusions are compatible.
<P ALIGN=Center>     It is that all human events occur simultaneously when
viewed 
<P ALIGN=Center>by a greater intelligence. If a greater intelligence wants
to 
<P ALIGN=Center>communicate with a lower form, all kinds of problems are

<P ALIGN=Center>presented. The communication must be conducted in a manner
which 
<P ALIGN=Center>will be meaningful and understandable to the lower life form.
An 
<P ALIGN=Center>acceptable frame of reference must be found and utilized.
<P ALIGN=Center>     UFO phenomenon, especially the "soft" ones, are frequently

<P ALIGN=Center>reflective; that is, the observed manifestations seem to
be 
<P ALIGN=Center>deliberately tailored and adjusted to the individual beliefs
and 
<P ALIGN=Center>attitudes of the witnesses. Contactees are given information

<P ALIGN=Center>which, in most cases, conforms to their beliefs. UFO researchers

<P ALIGN=Center>who concentrate on one particular aspect or theory find
themselves 
<P ALIGN=Center>inundated with seemingly reliable reports which seem to 
<P ALIGN=Center>substantiate that theory.
<P ALIGN=Center>     John Keel's extensive experiences with this reflective
factor 
<P ALIGN=Center>led him to carry out weird experiments which confirmed that
a 
<P ALIGN=Center>large part of the reported data is engineered and deliberately

<P ALIGN=Center>false. The witnesses are not the perpetrators, but merely
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>victims.
<P ALIGN=Center>     The apparent purpose of all this false data is multifold.

<P ALIGN=Center>Much of it is meant to create confusion and diversion. Some
of it 
<P ALIGN=Center>has served to support certain beliefs which were erroneous
but 
<P ALIGN=Center>which would serve as stepping-stones to the higher, more
complex 
<P ALIGN=Center>truth. Whole generations have come and gone, happily believing
in 
<P ALIGN=Center>the false data, unaware that they were mere links in the
chain.
<P ALIGN=Center>     If it were all understood too soon, we might crumble
under 
<P ALIGN=Center>the weight of the truth. This earth is covered with windows
into 
<P ALIGN=Center>those other unseen worlds. If we had the instruments to detect

<P ALIGN=Center>them, we would find that these windows are the focal points
for 
<P ALIGN=Center>super high-frequency waves -- the "rays" of ancient lore.
These 
<P ALIGN=Center>rays might come from Orion or the Pleiades as the ancients

<P ALIGN=Center>claimed, or they might be part of the great force that emanates

<P ALIGN=Center>throughout the universe. The UFOs have given us the evidence
that 
<P ALIGN=Center>such rays exist. Now, slowly, we are being told why.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>****************************************************************
<P ALIGN=Center>  
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     It is also apparent that some entities are having a
good 
<P ALIGN=Center>laugh at our expense. As mentioned before, literature indicates

<P ALIGN=Center>that the phenomenon carefully cultivated the religious frame
of 
<P ALIGN=Center>reference in early times, just as the modern manifestations
have 
<P ALIGN=Center>carefully supported the extraterrestrial frame of reference.
<P ALIGN=Center>     The Devil's emissaries of yesteryear have been replaced
by 
<P ALIGN=Center>the mysterious "men in black." A major, but little-explored,

<P ALIGN=Center>aspect of the UFO phenomenon is therefore theological and

<P ALIGN=Center>philosophical rather than purely scientific. The UFO problem
can 
<P ALIGN=Center>never be untangled by physicists and scientists unless they
are 
<P ALIGN=Center>men who also are schooled in the other disciplines.
<P ALIGN=Center>     The earth was occupied before man arrived or was created.

<P ALIGN=Center>That's an important point to consider. The original occupants
were 
<P ALIGN=Center>paraphysical and possessed the power of transmutation of
matter. 
<P ALIGN=Center>Man was the interloper. The inevitable conflict arose between

<P ALIGN=Center>physical man and the paraphysical owners of the planet. Man

<P ALIGN=Center>accepted the interpretation that this conflict raged between
his 
<P ALIGN=Center>creator and the Devil. The religious viewpoint has always
been 
<P ALIGN=Center>that the Devil has been attacking man (trying to get rid
of him) 
<P ALIGN=Center>by causing havoc upon him. There is historical and modern
proof 
<P ALIGN=Center>that this may be so.
<P ALIGN=Center>     It is interesting that parapsychologists have long concluded

<P ALIGN=Center>that the paralysis that contactees experience is a contributing

<P ALIGN=Center>cause; that the entity may materialize by utilizing energy
from 
<P ALIGN=Center>the percipient himself.
<P ALIGN=Center>     John Keel has in his files hundreds of cases, some of
which 
<P ALIGN=Center>have now been investigated by qualified psychiatrists, in
which 
<P ALIGN=Center>young men and women obsessed with the UFO phenomenon have
suffered 
<P ALIGN=Center>frightening visits from apparitions, followed up by mysterious

<P ALIGN=Center>black Cadillacs which appeared and disappeared suddenly,
and have 
<P ALIGN=Center>been terrified into up their pursuit of the UFOs. The phenomenon

<P ALIGN=Center>is again reflective in nature; the more frightened the victim

<P ALIGN=Center>becomes, the more the manifestations are escalated. Think
about 
<P ALIGN=Center>it.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>****************************************************************
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>The Other Side of the Coin
<P ALIGN=Center>     
<P ALIGN=Center>     There is a balance in nature, and there also seems to
be a 
<P ALIGN=Center>balance in the UFO picture. People have actually died after

<P ALIGN=Center>exposure to the gamma and UV rays from UFOs. But other people
have 
<P ALIGN=Center>actually had their ailments cured by similar rays. Occult

<P ALIGN=Center>literature is filled with accounts of this type.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Except for those who might be specially constructed
for 
<P ALIGN=Center>incubus-succubus activities, it does appear that our "angels"
and 
<P ALIGN=Center>"spacemen" come from a world, in many cases, with sex --
and very 
<P ALIGN=Center>probably, a world without an organized society; a world in
which 
<P ALIGN=Center>each individual is merely a unit in the whole and is totally

<P ALIGN=Center>controlled by the collective intelligence or energy mass
of that 
<P ALIGN=Center>whole. In other words, these beings, or some of them anyway,
have 
<P ALIGN=Center>no free will. They are slaves of a very high order. Often
they try 
<P ALIGN=Center>to convey this to percipients with their statements, "We
are One," 
<P ALIGN=Center>"We are in bondage."
<P ALIGN=Center>     We face a great task in trying to isolate the UFO phenomenon

<P ALIGN=Center>from the larger and more important "big picture," the overall

<P ALIGN=Center>situation of which the UFOs are merely a small part.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Elemental beings are another aspect of the world we
live in. 
<P ALIGN=Center>Children see them more than adults, perhaps for the reasons

<P ALIGN=Center>described before. Historical records certainly indicate that
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>little people have always existed all over this planet; that
they 
<P ALIGN=Center>possess the power of flight, the power of invisibility, and,
to 
<P ALIGN=Center>varying degrees, the power to dominate and control the human
mind. 
<P ALIGN=Center>Accounts of little humanoids with supernatural powers can
be found 
<P ALIGN=Center>in almost every culture.
<P ALIGN=Center>     The manifestations have remained the same throughout
history. 
<P ALIGN=Center>Only our interpretations of those events have changed. It
brought 
<P ALIGN=Center>the birth of Spiritualism, which was in its heyday in the
1850s 
<P ALIGN=Center>and 1860s, and was just another form of communication between
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>ultraterrestrials and ourselves.
<P ALIGN=Center>     UFO flaps also parallel outbreaks of poltergeist cases.
It 
<P ALIGN=Center>all ties in together.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Assuming that each discovered historical report represents
a 
<P ALIGN=Center>larger number of unpublished or undiscovered reports, just
as 
<P ALIGN=Center>today's UFO reports represent on the average 250 unreported
or 
<P ALIGN=Center>unpublished sightings, we can conclude that a flap condition

<P ALIGN=Center>existed, for example, in the years 1820, 1834, 1844, 1846,
and 
<P ALIGN=Center>1849. We also find that there was an outbreak of poltergeists
in 
<P ALIGN=Center>1835, 1846, and 1849.
<P ALIGN=Center>     As the 19th century progressed, reporting improved,
and we 
<P ALIGN=Center>are able to make more precise correlations. A UFO flap took
place 
<P ALIGN=Center>in 1850, and there was also a series of poltergeist cases.
A 
<P ALIGN=Center>larger poltergeist outbreak occurred in 1867, following flaps
in 
<P ALIGN=Center>1863-64. UFO activity became more intense beginning in 1870,
and 
<P ALIGN=Center>there were notable flaps in 1872, 1877, and 1879. The 1880s

<P ALIGN=Center>produced a major explosion of all kinds of phenomena, including

<P ALIGN=Center>the sudden disappearance of people. Poltergeist cases were
in 
<P ALIGN=Center>abundance in that decade, particularly in the big flap years
of 
<P ALIGN=Center>1883 and 1885.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Astrophysicist Morris K. Jessup labeled the years 1877-87
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>"Incredible Decade" after scouring astronomical journals
of the 
<P ALIGN=Center>period. Astronomers made some remarkable discoveries during
those 
<P ALIGN=Center>years. The previously unobserved satellites of Mars popped
into 
<P ALIGN=Center>view in 1877, new craters appeared on the moon, all kinds
of 
<P ALIGN=Center>strange objects flitted around the upper atmosphere.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>****************************************************************
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     
<P ALIGN=Center>     The trance phenomenon deserves extensive study because
so 
<P ALIGN=Center>many aspects of it are directly related to the contactee

<P ALIGN=Center>phenomenon. In both, you will find the same contradictions.
There 
<P ALIGN=Center>seem to be both good and evil forces at work. The good guys
latch 
<P ALIGN=Center>onto people with particularly receptive minds and turn them
into 
<P ALIGN=Center>trance mediums and the bad guys use the same methods to tamper

<P ALIGN=Center>with the minds of contactees and even to commit murder
indirectly. 
<P ALIGN=Center>Since incidents of these types can be traced throughout history,

<P ALIGN=Center>it seems probably that these forces have always been here
on this 
<P ALIGN=Center>planet. do the ultraterrestrials really care about us? There
is 
<P ALIGN=Center>much evidence to suggest that they don't. They care only
to the 
<P ALIGN=Center>extent that we can fulfill our enigmatic use to them.
<P ALIGN=Center>     There have been innumerable psychic hoaxes for the past
150 
<P ALIGN=Center>years, and many of these parallel the UFO hoaxes. In ufology
we 
<P ALIGN=Center>have to contend with the teenager's hot air balloon, and
in 
<P ALIGN=Center>psychic phenomenon we have to worry about youngsters firing
rocks 
<P ALIGN=Center>at houses. There are, however, more UFO sightings than there
are 
<P ALIGN=Center>plastic balloons, and more poltergeists dumping rocks in
living 
<P ALIGN=Center>rooms than there are wild-eyed youngsters with slingshots.
There 
<P ALIGN=Center>are also more ultraterrestrial entities than either the
occultists 
<P ALIGN=Center>or the UFO researchers can dream of.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Giant winged beings, usually described as headless,
are an 
<P ALIGN=Center>integral part of the UFO phenomenon. Winged human forms have
been 
<P ALIGN=Center>seen flying over many areas of the world. John A. Keel wrote
a 
<P ALIGN=Center>book called the "Mothman Prophecies" and Gray Barker a book
called 
<P ALIGN=Center>"The Silver Bridge" that go into some detail. They are usually

<P ALIGN=Center>described as having blazing red eyes set deep in their shoulders.

<P ALIGN=Center>****************************************************************
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     On May 13, 1917, three girls in Portugal were in the
meadows 
<P ALIGN=Center>of a place called Cova da Iria outside of Fatima, Portugal,
when 
<P ALIGN=Center>they saw a flash of light in the clear sky. They ran for
shelter 
<P ALIGN=Center>under a tree, thinking that was lightning. When they reached
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>tree, they stopped in amazement, for there hovering just
above a 
<P ALIGN=Center>3-foot evergreen nearby, a brilliant globe of light hung

<P ALIGN=Center>suspended.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Within this globe there was an entity garbed in a luminous

<P ALIGN=Center>white robe with a face of light which dazzled and hurt the
eyes.
<P ALIGN=Center>     The figure stated that it was from heaven, and asked
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>girls to come there on the 13th day, for six months in
succession. 
<P ALIGN=Center>On October 13, 1917, an estimated 70,000 people had gathered
at 
<P ALIGN=Center>the site. Suddenly the crowd screamed, for something came
through 
<P ALIGN=Center>the clouds: a huge silver disk which rotated rapidly as it

<P ALIGN=Center>descended towards the crowd. It seemed to change color, going

<P ALIGN=Center>through the spectrum. These gyrations continued for ten minutes.

<P ALIGN=Center>Miles from there, others were also watching the same object.
<P ALIGN=Center>     The incident at Fatima was obviously a carefully planned
and 
<P ALIGN=Center>deliberately executed demonstration. The major prophecies
of 
<P ALIGN=Center>Fatima had been written down and sealed in an envelope, and
turned 
<P ALIGN=Center>over to the Vatican. They were supposed to be revealed to
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>world in 1960. The secret of Fatima? One Pope was murdered
after 
<P ALIGN=Center>only 30 days in office when the Vatican thought he would
reveal 
<P ALIGN=Center>it. It is said to be a prediction of the end of the world.
The 
<P ALIGN=Center>demonstration was therefore a failure as far as the 
<P ALIGN=Center>ultraterrestrials were concerned. Such demos proved highly

<P ALIGN=Center>effective in Biblical times, but times were changing and
new 
<P ALIGN=Center>methods were called for.
<P ALIGN=Center>     A similar event such as Fatima took place in Garabandal,

<P ALIGN=Center>Germany, on July 2, 1961. Even more startling, on the entity's

<P ALIGN=Center>right side they could see "a square of red fire framing a
triangle 
<P ALIGN=Center>with an eye and some writing. The lettering was in an old

<P ALIGN=Center>Oriental script." The Third Eye. Haven't we heard of that
before?
<P ALIGN=Center>     Remember the Nation of the Third Eye -- the MIB. etc?
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>****************************************************************
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>ADDENDUM BY THE AUTHOR
<P ALIGN=Center> 
<P ALIGN=Center>Gravitational Propulsion
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>     Well, I have gotten this far in explaining some things
to 
<P ALIGN=Center>you. I might as well turn to my favorite subject of all --

<P ALIGN=Center>gravitational propulsion. The best place to start is with
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>efforts of a personal acquaintance of mine who had the good

<P ALIGN=Center>fortune to meet in England -- Mr. J. R. Searl. His investigations

<P ALIGN=Center>into gravitational propulsion have proven to be quite revealing
-- 
<P ALIGN=Center>he's done it, and I want to tell you about it.
<P ALIGN=Center>     In 1949, he was employed by the Midlands Board as an

<P ALIGN=Center>electronic fitter. He was very enthusiastic about the subject
of 
<P ALIGN=Center>electricity, though he had no formal education on the subject

<P ALIGN=Center>other than was required by his job. Unhindered by conventional

<P ALIGN=Center>ideas about electricity, he carried out his own investigation
into 
<P ALIGN=Center>the subject. During work on electrical motors and generators,
he 
<P ALIGN=Center>noticed that a small electromotive force (EMF) was produced
by the 
<P ALIGN=Center>spinning metal parts -- the negative toward the outside and
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>positive toward the rotational axis.
<P ALIGN=Center>     In 1950, he experimented with rotating slip rings and

<P ALIGN=Center>measured a small EMF on a conventional meter. He also noticed
that 
<P ALIGN=Center>when the rings were spinning freely and no electrical current
was 
<P ALIGN=Center>taken, his hair bristled. His conclusions were that free
electrons 
<P ALIGN=Center>in the metal were spun out by centrifugal force being produced
by 
<P ALIGN=Center>the static field in the metal. He then decided to build a

<P ALIGN=Center>generator on the same principle.
<P ALIGN=Center>     It had a segmented rotor disc, passing through
electromagnets
<P ALIGN=Center>at its periphery. The electromagnets were energized from
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>rotor, and were intended to boost the EMF.
<P ALIGN=Center>     By 1952, the first generator had been constructed and
was 
<P ALIGN=Center>about three feet in diameter. It was tested in the open by
Searl 
<P ALIGN=Center>and a friend. The armature was set in motion by a small engine.

<P ALIGN=Center>The device produced the expected electrical power, but at
an 
<P ALIGN=Center>unexpectedly high potential. At relatively low armature speeds
a 
<P ALIGN=Center>potential of the order of 10^5 volts was produced, as indicated
by 
<P ALIGN=Center>static effects on nearby objects.
<P ALIGN=Center>     The really unexpected then occurred. While still speeding
up, 
<P ALIGN=Center>the generator lifted and rose to a height of about 50 feet
above 
<P ALIGN=Center>the ground, breaking the union between itself and the engine.
Here 
<P ALIGN=Center>it stayed for a while, still speeding up and surrounding
itself 
<P ALIGN=Center>with a pink glow. This indicated ionization of air at a much

<P ALIGN=Center>reduced pressure of about 10^-3 mm Hg. More interesting was
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>side effect, causing local radio receivers to go on by
themselves. 
<P ALIGN=Center>Finally, the whole generator accelerated at a fantastic rate
and 
<P ALIGN=Center>is thought to have gone off into space.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Since that day, Searl and others have made some ten
or more 
<P ALIGN=Center>small flying craft, some of which have been similarly lost,
and 
<P ALIGN=Center>have developed a form of control. Larger craft have been
built -- 
<P ALIGN=Center>some 12 feet and two 30 feet in diameter.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Once the machine has passed a certain threshold of potential

<P ALIGN=Center>voltage, the energy output exceeds the input. The energy
output 
<P ALIGN=Center>seems to be virtually limitless. We made some measurements
when I 
<P ALIGN=Center>was there, and as far as we could see, the estimated output
is 
<P ALIGN=Center>somewhere in the vicinity of 10^13 to 10^15 watts. Above
what 
<P ALIGN=Center>appears to be the threshold potential, some 10^13 volts,
the 
<P ALIGN=Center>generator and attached parts become inertia-free. There is
also 
<P ALIGN=Center>some "matter snatch" upon acceleration away from the ground,
since 
<P ALIGN=Center>it tends to take a little "turf" with it when it goes.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Analyzing what is happening is fairly easy. What the

<P ALIGN=Center>generator is doing is placing a "stress" on the ambient space

<P ALIGN=Center>around it. The space breaks down to provide the magnetism
to 
<P ALIGN=Center>relieve the stress, but the energy by-product is absorbed
by the 
<P ALIGN=Center>generator, which reinforces the field.
<P ALIGN=Center>     It should be noted at this point that only a very small

<P ALIGN=Center>amount of space fabric passes through the craft and an even

<P ALIGN=Center>smaller amount is converted for energy. However, I have noticed

<P ALIGN=Center>that small changes in etheric forces lead to large physical

<P ALIGN=Center>effects. It was aptly demonstrated and I was impressed.
<P ALIGN=Center>     Recently, Mr. Searl had (1987) a brush with authorities,
when 
<P ALIGN=Center>he began simply generating his own power for his own house.
Now he 
<P ALIGN=Center>doesn't have a very large house, but the Utility Board didn't
like 
<P ALIGN=Center>the fact that they had lost their monopoly. Now he lives
in 
<P ALIGN=Center>Birmingham under an assumed name. Simple, eh?
