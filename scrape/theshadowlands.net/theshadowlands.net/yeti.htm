<td><font color="#000099"><b>Or the abominable snowman as it is commonly
called has been sighted in the Himalayan mountains for 100's of years.</b>

<b>The creature is a tall manlike creature coverd with shaggy hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The people of Nepal see the creature regularly.&nbsp; Accounts say it's
height is approx. 6-8 feet, conical scalp, pointed ears, hairless chest
area and a human-like face.&nbsp;&nbsp; The creature is said to have a
very bad temperment and will attack anyone who ventures close enough.&nbsp;
The Yeti's descriptions are similar to those of <a href="bf.htm">Bigfoot</a>.&nbsp;
Below are some pictures of foot prints and tracks attributed to the Yeti.
Judging by the depth of the footprint impressions, the average yeti most
way upwards of 800 pounds.&nbsp; Many Westerners have also observed this
creature while on expeditions in the mountains.&nbsp;</b> <b>The most recent
sighting was in 1986 when the creature was observed by the famous climber
Reinhold Messner.</b>&nbsp; <b>In 1992, an expedition discovered the Yeti's
footprints in and around their camp when they awoke in the morning.&nbsp;
The areas in this region are not well traversed, so it is believable that
an unknown primate lives here and remains yet undiscovered by science.&nbsp;</b></font></td>

<p><b>In 1957, Tom Slick financed and led an expedition to the mountains
of Nepal to search for the Yeti. They wanted to uncover solid proof that
there was an unknown primate living there. They hoped the discovery would
help science and medicine learn more about illness and disease from a species
that reportedly is very similar to man. They found bedding areas that were
similar to ones made by the mountain gorilla. They also took many hair
and dropping samples that were packed away and forgotten for years. When
the items were finally tested, they found parasites from an unknown primate
in the dropping samples.......</b></td>
