</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P><B>Spring-Heeled Jack first leapt out of the
shadows
in the late fall
of 1837.</B>
<P><B>At first he was just a rumour, and few Londoners believed the tales


they</B>
<P><B>heard of the bogey-man who was reputed to be be able to leap huge


hedgerows,</B>
<P><B>and breathe flames from his mouth. Few believed the tales of the


attacks,</B>
<P><B>mostly on young women, carried out by the mystery man. The rumours</B>
<P><B>persisted as the number of attacks grew. It seemed his modus opperandi


was</B>
<P><B>to secret himself behind walls or bushes and then leap out on


unsuspecting</B>
<P><B>travellers. Usually he would rip their clothes with the claws on his


hands,</B>
<P><B>and breathe flames into the victims' faces. Then, with shock still</B>
<P><B>immobilizing his prey, he would bound away in huge, leaping strides


which</B>
<P><B>covered great distances at each step. The thing about the devil-man


which</B>
<P><B>most stuck out in the minds of the victims were his terrible,


protruding,</B>
<P><B>hell-like eyes, and his peculiar ringing laughter, which echoed in


their</B>
<P><B>minds for days afterward. Concerned citizens formed vigilante committees


to</B>
<P><B>try and track down the miscreant, and at one point the group included


the</B>
<P><B>Duke of Wellington, and Admiral Codrington, the former of which set
out on</B>
<P><B>horseback every night with his trusty pistols to try and bring


Spring-Heeled</B>
<P><B>Jack to justice. All to no avail. Spring-Heeled Jack continued his


reign</B>
<P><B>of terror. His ability to leap over huge hedgerows and walls made him</B>
<P><B>extremely difficult to catch. He had also added the act of terrifying</B>
<P><B>coach-drivers to his list of conquests. The attacks reached a climax


when,</B>
<P><B>in the winter of 1838, he moved his activities into the city proper.</B>
<P><B>The first of these London attacks took place on a dark February night.


Lucy</B>
<P><B>Scales was walking home with her sister from their brother's house
along a</B>
<P><B>lonely street in the Limehouse district. As they passed Green Dragon


Alley,</B>
<P><B>a tall cloaked figure bounded out of the shadows at them. He spat


blue</B>
<P><B>flames into Lucy's face, blinding her. As she lay writhing on the


ground,</B>
<P><B>Spring-Heeled Jack calmly turned around and melted back into the


shadows.</B>
<P><B>Panic spread over the city of London. Up until now, the man's


activities</B>
<P><B>had been centred around the surrounding towns and villages along the


Thames.</B>
<P><B>Word spread quickly: Spring-Heeled Jack was on the prowl in London


itself!!</B>
<P><B>He struck again a few nights later. The Alsop family was spending a


quiet</B>
<P><B>evening at home, when a violent knocking was heard at the front door.


Jane</B>
<P><B>Alsop (who lived with her father and her two sisters) got up to answer


it.</B>
<P><B>When she opened the door she saw a man standing in the shadows near


the</B>
<P><B>front gate. He swung around. "I'm a police officer," he said. "For


God's</B>
<P><B>sake, bring me a light, for we have caught Spring-Heeled Jack in the


lane!"</B>
<P><B>As Jane ran to fetch a candle, she thought how exciting it would be
to see</B>
<P><B>Spring-Heeled Jack arrested. When she gave the candle to the man at


the</B>
<P><B>gate, she realized she had made a terrible mistake, for the man applied


to</B>
<P><B>candle to his breast to reveal the hideous features of Spring-Heeled


Jack</B>
<P><B>himself! Jane screamed as he vomited forth a huge amount of flame from


his</B>
<P><B>mouth. He then grabbed her and tore at her clothes with his sharp


claws.</B>
<P><B>She tried to get away, but the man caught her and continued his


attack.</B>
<P><B>Soon the whole family ran out into the street, hearing her screams,


but</B>
<P><B>Spring-Heeled Jack bounded away down the road, and was soon lost to


sight.</B>
<P><B>Jane described her inhuman attacker to the police, saying that he wore


a</B>
<P><B>tight oilskin suit, and a kind of close-fitting helmet on his head


(pictures</B>
<P><B>of Spring-Heeled Jack portray him as wearing a mask with a pointed
beard and</B>
<P><B>pointed ears--like a devil)</B>
<P><B>Spring-Heeled Jack made an aborted attempt at the same trick a few


nights</B>
<P><B>later at another house, but a servant boy realized who he was and began


to</B>
<P><B>shout for help. Spring-Heeled Jack escaped again, this time victimless.


</B>
<P><B>Throughout the 19th century, Spring-Heeled Jack was sighted all over</B>
<P><B>England. After a brief period of inactivity in the late 1830's he was


seen</B>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="jack2.jpg" WIDTH="193" HEIGHT="239"><B>time

and time again in the 1840's and 50's. </B>
<P><B>He frightened army sentries
in</B><B>the 1870's, by </B>
<P><B>darting out of the darkness and slapping their </B>
<P><B>faces
with a</B><B>cold, clammy hand before leaping </B>
<P><B>onto the roofs of their sentry
boxes.</B><B>Angry townspeople </B>
<P><B>shot at him in the streets on night in 1877. As usual,
he</B>
<P><B>laughed and melted away into the darkness, </B>
<P><B>unrepentant.</B>
<P><B>Spring-Heeled Jack was last seen in 1904 in Liverpool. </B>
<P><B>There, he
terrified</B><B>people by bounding up and down the streets and onto their rooftops.
</B>
<P><B>When</B><B>attempts were made to corner him, but simply vanished into the
darkness.</B>
<P><B>This was the last reported sighting of Spring-Heeled Jack.</B>
<P><B>It is thought that the original Spring-Heeled Jack (for there was


obviously</B>
<P><B>more than one) was an Irish nobleman, The Marquis of Waterford, who


was</B>
<P><B>renowned for his sadistic taste in practical jokes, and his scorn for


women.</B>
<P><B>Author Peter Haining in his book "The Legend and Bizarre Crimes of</B>
<P><B>Spring-Heeled Jack" believes that Waterford's idea for the character
of Jack</B>
<P><B>was brought about by a humiliating experience with a woman and a


police</B>
<P><B>officer while travelling abroad. Haining believes that Waterford and


his</B>
<P><B>rich friends thought up the idea as a prank to get even, by proxy,
with the</B>
<P><B>police and women in general. Haining also believes that Waterford (who


had</B>
<P><B>friends who studied applied mechanics) helped him invent


"spring-heeled</B>
<P><B>boots" (boots with powerful springs in the heels) to help him with


his</B>
<P><B>attacks. It is likely that he also learned the technique of the


fire-eater</B>
<P><B>in order to heighten the supernatural aura of Spring-Heeled Jack. In</B>
<P><B>addition, Waterford had strangely protuberent eyes, which matched the</B>
<P><B>descriptions of Jack. He was also in the area when many of the


attacks</B>
<P><B>occured. As a final piece of evidence, the servant boy who scared Jack


away</B>
<P><B>saw a crest with the letter "W" on the man's cloak.</B>
<P><B>Although the mystery of Spring-Heeled Jack's identity has probably


been</B>
<P><B>ascertained, it is far more entertaining and romantic to think of</B>
<P><B>Spring-Heeled Jack as a mysterious creature of the night who may


someday</B>
<P><B>leap from the shadows again. </B>
