<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Two Incidents<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">By: Anonymous<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Here are two incidents that
happened when I was a small child and then later as a teenager just entering
puberty (I am a male):<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">(1) I lived in this house
from my birth till I was about my early 20's and to my knowledge, no one else
had lived there except my family.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I don't remember exactly how
old I was, maybe 6 to 8, and I was walking down our hallway from my bedroom
that I shared with my younger brother, and as I passed my Mother's room I
looked in there (there were no lights on in there or reflecting into it), and I
saw a glow of light and standing in the glow of light was an older woman
wearing a high neck dress with a brooch.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I wasn't scared, just
confused and finally went into the kitchen to eat with family members, some
time later I told my Mother what I saw (it might have minutes, hours, days,
weeks later, I don't remember), and she got out our old family photo albums,
and I correctly picked out a picture of my great-grandmother who I had seen in
the glow of light.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I was to find out years later
from my aunt that this was my great-grandmother's old bedroom, and she had died
in that very room (back then, more people died at home than hospitals, which
were fewer back then).<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">(2) I was playing some game
(cards maybe) with my younger Brother in my Mother's bedroom (used to be my
great-grandmother's old bedroom long before I was born), and while we were
playing, the door knob to an un-used room turned and then turned again (as if
someone was turning it), and my brother was frozen, but I jumped up and with NO
fright ran through another route, and looked all through the other rooms for
someone there, and I found NO one there, later on as I got much older, I
wondered if it was a poltergeist (possibly caused by me), or a spirit in there
that turned that door knob that night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Other than a few OOBE's that
I had much later as an adult, I have had no other incidents in my lifetime
except those two incidents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I was on your site regarding
NJ Hauntings and wanted to report one from my old house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I bought the house from my uncle by marriage,
Joe, who inherited it from his cousin Josephine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She lived there with her 5 siblings since the
early 1900's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did not know any of the
history before I bought it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One morning
when the alarm clock went off I turned it off and flipped over on my side to
wake my husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Standing next to the
door was a boy who looked to be in his teens.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">He was dressed in old time
garb, like knickers, high socks, a shirt with buttons and fuller sleeves, a
cap, and he was carrying a gas light or lantern.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stared at me and I remember feeling frozen
and I was trying to wake my husband up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The boy had a glow around him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
I stared at him, the image started to fade until the room went black.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was really scary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few months later I mentioned this to my
Uncle and he said oh that boy - that's Keats (which was a nickname).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He died in the house in the back bedroom when
he was a teenager from pneumonia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
Uncle said or it could have been the boy's brother who also died young while
swimming in the Delaware River.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both of
them were buried from the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
had the viewing in the house also for a few days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I only saw him once and to this day I swear
to it that it was a ghost.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The guy who wrote the book
Haunted Decatur, and the other Haunted books has never mentioned the house I
lived in for four years in Decatur IL.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We moved there when I was 10, and lived there until I was 14.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a big plantation style mansion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was pretty cool because for one it had a
tree growing right through the middle of the porch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also had a very long hallway closet, and a
small solarium.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the rooms were
huge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The most haunted areas were the
pink bathroom, (pink tiles, and a huge pink bath tub.), the basement and the
second floor storage room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a
grave stone in the yard which said FRITTY. (Assumedly this was the grave of a
dog.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The basement was so eerie, and
scary, but it was where our parents expected my brother and I to play.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When you went own usually it was fine, but
the longer you stayed the more you felt the presence of multiple entities
closing in on you, and when you finally got frightened enough to leave it
seemed as thought they were chasing you up the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were afraid to turn off the lights, but my
dad always made us go back and turn them off.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Bla, bla , bla, $1000 a month electric bill).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told you it was a big house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The pink bathroom connected
my bedroom with my parent&#8217;s bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(We
never got to use that big tub because it leakedL)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It always seemed like a scary room, and I
hated my room, because it scared me too, I used to go sleep in my brothers room
when I could not sleep in my own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
feeling of entities was always in that bathroom, but one day I went up to use
it and forgot to turn my bedroom light on before opening the pink bathroom
door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A screaming terrifying ghost sped
right for me, in a tattered pink night gown, it was a skeletal figure, with
long grey ghostly grey hair, almost like something out of a movie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact my parents blamed the sighting on the
movie Ghost Busters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I slammed the door,
and avoided that bathroom for months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
resolved to never ever open the door without turning the light on in my bedroom
again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Another thing that happened
in that house was my friend and I were playing in the room at the end of the
hall, adjacent to the storage room, and taking turns running up and down the
hallway well I was about half way down the hall way and she&#8217;s right behind me
when we heard a growl that would remind you of a hell hound or something. (We
never had a dog.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It set us dead in our
tracks and screaming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have been able
to hear and feel presences and entities ever sense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never saw anything like that ghost in the
pink bedroom again though.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I am a 62 year old white male
who has lived in Temple off and on sence Birth and would like to add a few
places not mentioned thus far that are haunted in the Temple area,one being the
old post office in down town Temple, The cities Library now I believe. Another
is the cemetery on North main St. ,another is that portion of the cemetery That
the oweniville road road cut thru, The head stones can still be found "I
think" between the roadway and the Railroad Tracks about 30 yards before
making the curve to the right to go over the tracks. As a Youngster I can
recall my head light on my motorcycle eluminating the figures of two people
standing by the Headstones ,one being a female dressed in a long ankle length
dress w/ruffled collar and cuffs, hair appeared to be long and done in a bun
that was on top of her head ,She was white and looked to be in her 40s or 50s ,
The male was dressed in a very old fashioned suit and was in the same age range
,also white . Upon getting to the part of the roadway where they were near,
they faded away. That sparked my interest about Ghosts and I soon found that my
friends were like minded about such things so one of the Cemeterys that we
visited was in a part of Bell County that is now part of Still house hollow
lake . There were four of us<span style="">&nbsp; </span>on a Friday
Midnight in nov that saw a black figure that vanished in to the tallest
Monument in the cemetery and before we left we spotted two more black
forms<span style="">&nbsp; </span>by far that was one of the
creepiest places around. not long after our visit there the Corps<span style="">&nbsp; </span>flooded the area.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I recall another place that
we visited Near Salado Tx where we saw a blue light that floated thru the
Cemetery , This was a well known event by seemed like all of the kids back
then.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I recall visiting a hangmans
tree near Salado as well where there was supposed to be ghosts of those who had
lost their lifes that lingered there . I have more recollections but these are
some of the more noteable ones.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I have a ghost story for
you,Back in the 1990's I moved into a apartment that an old girl friends mother
had just moved out of in Lancaster PA. Not many problems at first, but after
about a month I started hearing foot steps going up and down the stairs leading
to my 2nd floor apartment.Was curious enough to get up and investigate,but
always' found nothing! Then one day I was shaving in the bathroom,right next to
the bedroom and I thought I heard my closet door shut in the bedroom. This
apartment was an old place and had old door knobs on the doors that were hard
to work right. you had to use a little bit of force to shut these doors right.
Sure enough the door was shut when I knew I had left it open prior to going to
the bathroom to shave! One night late when I was sleeping I thought I felt my
covers move,it woke me up! I just layed there in bed for awhile thinking what
it could of been,(my bed room was totally dark,I couldn't see my hand in front
of my face),then all of a sudden my covers<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>started to be pulled down over<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my
chest real slow!!!! At first I thought it may have been my toes curling up and
pulling them down but I held my whole body still including my toes and the
covers kept being pulled down off my body!!! I'm telling you, I've never been
so scared in my life!!! I wanted to turn on the lights real quick but the light
switch was on the wall down at the end of my bed,and in order to turn the light
on,I would have to be<span style="">&nbsp; </span>face to face with
what ever was doing this!!!! NO THANK YOU!!!! I ended up turning over on my
side and it all of a sudden stopped!!! I remember laying there for a long while
trying to build up enough balls to turn on the light.Finally decided to go for
it,did it and of course, nothing there!!! I also have seen shadows,quite
frequently. About three feet tall,walking across the door way entrance to my
living room! I always felt like somebody was there with me,when I knew, there
was nobody there!!! Very spooky stuff!!!!! Was very happy to find another place
to live shortly after!!! Hope you enjoy the story!!!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">A few months ago, I was
working at the county sheriff's office, located in the basement of the
courthouse. I had heard stories from the other employees about the place being
haunted by a few different ghosts, but just never paid attention to them. One
night I was on graveyard shift, and the garage door slammed. Now, this door is
a huge, heavy door that is locked 24/7 and is only opened by a key. It is also
monitored on both sides by cameras. So the door just slammed and I got scared
because I thought maybe someone had broken in. I went back to the cameras and
no one was there! The camera clearly showed the door opening and slamming, but
nobody around it! I then went and checked the door and it was tightly locked! <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Another experience I had was
another night when I was on graveyard shift. It was the end of the shift,
around 7 am. It had been a very quiet night, almost too quiet. The jailer went
into the women's cells to serve them breakfast. In the woman's cell, there is
the sleeping room with a couple of bunk beds and a toilet, and right next to
that, connected with a door is the day room. Anyway, the ladies asked the
jailer if there was anyone brought in last night. The jailer said no. They were
all shocked because all of them clearly heard a woman crying in the day room! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I was about nine years old
and living in an old house that was about 100 years old. The man who owned the
house, actually died there. Well, my room was his when he was alive. I woke up,
feeling like someone was watching me, so I looked and there was a man sitting
on the end of my bed asking me why I was in his room. I didn't scream, I was
too scared to, and just sat there. After about a minute he got up and walked
out of the room and then dissappeared at the foot of the stairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The only times I ever saw
him, were from outside. And he was in my room looking out my window and stared
at me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I wanted to tell you about a
strange "event' that occured here in my home last week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've had things happen to me ever since I was
very young, but since my husband and I moved away from home in 1999 it seems as
though I have something following me. Everywhere we have lived there has been
occurances that are not able to be explained.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So here we are in Germany (only been here 2 months) and so far it had
been quiet in the house, up until last week anyway.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I was home alone, my kids
were at school and my husband at work. I was here in the office doing some
class work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of a sudden I hear this
crash downstairs. I figured it was something under the stairs falling since I
had been digging through boxes looking for a photo album.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't think much about until a couple of
minutes later when I heard something turn on. All of my hair seemed to stand on
end as I started down the stairs. I didn't want to go down there but I new I
had to to find out what was running. To my shock I saw that it was my hairdryer
laying on the bathroom floor TURNED ON. This was no accident. Let me explain
the set up in my bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the right
side of the sink is a towel holder thingy but it has 4 hooks so you can put
your hair dryer, straightener etc on it. My hairdryer has a loop on the handle
and I use that to hang up the dryer, and the cord has to run under the sink to
the outlet left of the sink. So how in the world was my hairdryer on the floor
under the outlet on the left side of the sink switched on?!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned it off, laid it back down on the
floor, and bolted back upstairs. I left it there for my husband to see when he
got home, and I didn't touch it for 2 days. Just let my hair airdry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I startled me that bad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So far this week it's quiet but it is only
Tuesday and now that things have started up I know it will continue. Hope you
find this interesting, I sure did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Every house has its own way
of settling. Distinctive creaks, distinctive groans. To some it is a sense of
comfort, others it is a nuisance, giving owners the idea that there are repairs
to be made. It seems the older the home, the more it settles. It leads to a
rhythm that most people grow accustomed to. My house has such a rhythm. It is
comforting and peaceful, never foreboding or bothersome. there are familiar
creaks and groans. You can hear the pipes rattle here and there despite the
insulation and every now and then the sound of little feet scampering across
the roof. But in my house, you also hear footsteps in the hall at night when
all are asleep. You also hear your name being called when there is no one else
home, or when someone is there but not the person who's voice you heard. In my
house, you hear the loud banging of something heavy hitting the floor upstairs,
only to find that a securely placed object has somehow landed several feet away
from it's original resting place. Lights come on with no one there to turn them
on. And our dog and cat watch someone pace the entrance way quite often, never
scared but curious, almost as if they don't know why this person has not
stopped to pet them. There are sightings, but not frequently. When there are
sightings, they are very distinct and un-ignorable. Our inhabitant is male. How
do I know? I feel it. And I have seen him, both from a distance and up close
and personal. This man has made himself known to the women in our family. While
in the kitchen one night, cleaning and putting away the remnents of dinner, my
mother saw who she assummed to be my father step off the bottom step of our
stairs and walk into the living room. How do I know that it was not him? I was
in the living room at the time and there was no one there to walk into the
living room. My mother was convinced my father was playing a joke on her and
that I was in on it, with him hiding and waiting to scare the you know what out
of her as he often liked to do. She looked in every room downstairs and my
father was no where to be found. She called for him and he had been upstairs in
the bathroom, occupied the entire time. A few weeks later, my mother was alone
in the house, again working in the kitchen, when she felt someone lay their
hand on her shoulder. She went cold and then she felt a gentle squeeze. This
has happened several more times since then. She lets it go, saying it is our
friendly inhabitant saying hello. As for me, well, I have seen him come down
the stairs. I have heard him step fro the bottom step onto the parque wood
floor of our entrance way and then I have seen his back walk as he walked into
the living room. When I follow, he is gone. I have seen him peeking out at me
from behind the partial wall between our living and dining room, his hat very
visible while the rest almost blurred and transparent. This happens more often
than not when I am alone in my house. I have also been awakened by a man's
voice in my ear, almost yelling my name. It isn't my fathers voice. But it is
male. I hear my name being called when I am downstairs from the upstairs
bedroom while my dad is upstairs. But he has not called for me and swears by
that. My most interesting moment happened late one night. I was asleep, but
awoke when I felt someone staring at me intently. The hairs on the back of my
neck raised and I knew someone was in the room with me. I rolled over and not
one foot away from my own face was his. He was transparent, his face whitish,
like it was formed from smoke. It was just his face, nothing else. It was like
he was watching my while I slept, like this was a habit of his only this time I
woke up. the face was friendly enough, but it was enough to cause my heart to
leap into my throat. I had to slowly reach around him, the air was freezing,
and turn on a light. When I did so, the face went away, but the feeling of him
was still there. I sat up in my bed and I spoke to him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">"I am fine with you
staying here. I am fine with you living with us and being with us and I am fine
with the occaasional sighting, However, what you did just now was not ok. If
you watch me, I don't want to know. I don't want to see you like that. You
scared me and now I can't sleep. So, stay if you like, but DO NOT EVER DO THAT
AGAIN!" <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Since then I have only felt
him with me in my room. I am never uncomfortable, but I am always watched. I
know that much. I feel that much. And while I know he has made himself known to
my mother, I feel as though he has attached himself to me. I am never alone.
Even when I am alone in a room, there is always that feeling of another
presence. This is no matter where I go. And while that does not scare me, I can
say that at times, it is QUITE un-nerving.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hi- I just wanted to share my
story and to be reassured that I am not going crazy. I moved last summer to a
small town in Maine. The house that I moved into is one of the original houses
to this town- it is almost 250 years old. There was nothing out of the ordinary
with the house until about 2 months of being there. I did some laundry and
before I went to bed upstairs, I threw the clothes into the dryer- I know, not
the brightest thing to do. Anyway, I got up the next morning and went
downstairs and the dryer was still going. The clothes should have either burned
or the motor should have caught on fire. This was 8 hours later and it was like
I had just put the clothes in an hour ago.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The dryer has worked fine
since.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">On another day a few weeks
later, I woke up and the coffee maker was on but I had not set it up to do a
delay brew. It was not hot so it had not been on long. The coffee maker has
worked fine ever since.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The other day I came home and
the storm windows upstairs were all<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">down- I had gone to open the
windows to let some air in because it was warm that day. That night, however,
they were calling for an early frost and temperatures in the 30's. The storm
windows had been up ever since I moved in and no one has a key to the house but
me and I had them installed the day after I moved in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I do not have a bad feeling
about the house, I feel like it is someone that may have lived in the house in
years past that is continuing to look out for the house that they once enjoyed
living in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Heres my story. This sent me
running with my hair standing straight up. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>It was in the summer and an elderly neighbor
of mine had had a garage sale. It was getting dark and she had gone in her
house for the night. I stayed outdoors to help her pack up things after the
sale. I picked up military hat that was laying on the table getting ready to put
it away, when suddenly I felt and heard a "hey!" in my ear. I was the
only one outdoors at the time. I threw the hat down and ran into my
house........fast!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day I told
the neighbor about it, she laughed and said that was probably her husband because
the hat had belonged to him, he was deceased.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The small house where I grew
up in had an entity or "ghost" if you will and he inhabited the
upstairs of the home, which is where my bedroom was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I call him a "he" because that's
what I felt he was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Every night soon after going
to bed he would play games by bumping the bed, making it shake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not violently, but just if someone was
kneeing the side of the mattress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
would say out loud enough!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I want to go
to sleep now and it would stop.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My bed was up against a wall
just below an air vent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One morning just
after waking up, still half asleep and still lying in bed, I was looking up at
the vent when suddenly one screw came loose from the wall leaving it dangling
on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then suddenly the whole
thing fell out heading directly towards my head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was absolutely frozen in sheer terror!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the last possible nanosecond it flew a
good 5 feet from the bed landing on the wooden floor leaving a sizable gash.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I don't believe my ghost had
anything to do with the vent falling off of the wall, but I do believe he saved
me from it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that, I had a new
found respect for him and I would sometimes talk to him even though he couldn't
talk to me, at least not that I could understand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was also no longer afraid of him after
that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">There were two rooms
upstairs, my room and a pool room / entertainment room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night while watching t.v. downstairs, my
friend and I heard a very large crash with the sound of pool balls knocking in
to each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We raced upstairs to find
everything in order, including the pool balls which were still set in their
triangle as if ready ready for a game. I told my mother about that but she told
me it was our "active imagination" at work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">As if to prove a point, a few
nights later my mother was with me watching t.v. downstairs when the exact same
sound occurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just looked at her and
said I told you!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Every time you would walk
down the stairs it was as if someone had their face pressed up against the back
of your neck making the hair literally stand up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think my ghost was trying real hard to
communicate with us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, my mother
became afraid to go upstairs after she heard the sound of the pool table being
slammed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

you post it on your site.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I'm stationed at Fort Carson
As an MP. The past two nights<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Myself and
a few other MP's had been going to the old hospital here on post to scare some
onf the rookies that we have gotten. Well the last night<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we where there on of our patrols was hiding
and waiting to scare the other guys in the hospital, and some how was locked in
a closet and couldn't open it. Well at the same time some of the guys were
outside and heard a loud scream. When the individual that was in the closet
finnally got out and came out he was white as a sheet and told us he had got
locked in a closet only he didnt lock someone else locked it. And started
blaming the guys outside we were all laughing. We started making fun of him for
screaming like a girl. He told us that that wasn't him screaming. he thought it
was us that locked him in a closet and then was screaming to scare the crap out
of him. the night before a few guys had went in the hospital and i never realy
went back there because i just get a bad vibe from the place even when i just
drive buy the place. any ways we go in there and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and we go to this room everyone calls the
blood room. every time we go in there theres new<span style="">&nbsp; </span>wet blood on the floor and walls and ceiling.
then<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i think that there are making
someone mad because the same night that we were doing this there was a phone
call to a room in a nother building where suppoivly a guy killed three people
and the call happend we were told buy creditable sources that the call was
staticy and he thought he heard some one talking and then it went dead. when
these guys went to check it out the building was secured except one door and
when they got to the room where the call had come from the door was locked and
no one was in the room. And some nights when i've driven past the hill behind
the new hospital i've seen things walking on the top of the hill. But also many
other people have reported thigns like noises,and lights and childrens hand
prints on the back of vehiclesand one of the guys were telling me they had a
trained dog with them and they threw his ball down the hall way of the hospital
and the k9 wouldn't even go down the hall to get i i think they said that was
in on of the hall ways to the morgue or insane assyleme side but i wasn't
accually there for that. Other people have reported seeing someone hanging
thems selves off the watch tower at the old jail to but i dunno about that one.
Only one i'm for sure it could possibley be haunted is the hospital cause i've
accually been there and witnessed it. I didnt much belive in ghousts and that
kinda stuff used to think it was a joke but when i was in high school my mother
bought a house in the town i'm from in the mid west that had been built and
used as a hospital and hotel and everything inbetween in the 1800's and some
pretty non explainable things happend when i lived there throughout high
school. The house was since condimmed and torn down an turned into a parking
lot and plans to build a church fellow ship area on top of the ground. but
thats all i got. thank you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Forney Road, New Lebanon, OH<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">By: susie.mullins@yahoo.com <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hi. I see that you have a
listing for Forney Road on your site. I grew up in New Lebanon and have always
been afraid of this road. Local legends always talked about a "hook"
man that would come after you and kill you. When I was a little girl, the
"hook" man was a friend of my neighbor. His name was Henry and he was
a crotchety old man. He may have chased a few kids away as he didn't like
people snooping around his property which I can't blame him. Something happened
to his hand and it was replaced with a hook. I was never afraid of him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">As kids, people would take us
down this road and tell stories and scare us and it was fun. As I got a little
older, I realized there are 2 parts to Forney Rd. One part is west of Lutheran
Church Rd and the other is east. You have to make a slight right then left
coming from either part. The part of Forney Rd just east of Lutheran Church
Road has a very old grave yard. When I was a kid, I went to that graveyard but
hadn't gone all the way down the road. Years later when I was sixteen, I had a
horrific dream about a house that set on Forney Rd that had a long lane just to
the right of it. I'd never seen this house before and just thought it was the
dream, you know how dreams can put you in a place that doesn't make sense.
Anyway, I delivered pizzas for a place in New Lebanon at the time and I went in
to work and was telling about my dream and was laughing and saying that if we
ever got a delivery for Forney Road, I was not taking it. We all laughed. We
didn't start taking "delivery" calls until 4:00. The very next day at
4:00 the very first call we had was a delivery to Forney Road, of course I was
the only delivery driver working that night so I had to take it. I answered the
phone and the person asked if we delivered to Forney Road. I asked my
supervisor and he laughed and said yes. We didn't deliver East of Lutheran
Church Rd but I forgot to ask what part of Forney they were on. I reluctantly
took the order out to the house. When I got there it was the house in my dream.
Nothing happened of course but I was freaked out the rest of the night. I
worked at that job probably a year after and never again had another call for
Forney Rd.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Again, years later, I had a
friend of my husband told me he was buying a house on Forney. It was that
house. I don't remember why but he ended up not buying it. For some reason this
house kept coming up. I haven't been back down that road since.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nothing paranormal happened
but I thought it was eerie that this house kept coming back to me even though I
had initially never seen it before. I would love to know if something happened
in that house or down that lane as my dream was extremely evil. It was a white
two story farm house sitting on the south side of the road with a long lane to
the right of it as you look at the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The home was built in 1850 by
Simon E. Dow. He was a prominate man in Iowa, and was at one time the mayor of
town. There was two horrible fires that destroyed the barn and parts of the
house, but is was rebuilt. The Dow's had 6 children. Three of which died while
they were babies. The oldest daughter died shortly after her graduation of high
school. The youngest son died at the age of 5 of TB. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The summer I was giving tours
I had seen a ghost of a small boy through the door. When entering the servants
quarters, you have an eerie feeling of anger. Something tells you to leave. I
took every tour through this room and EVERY group said the same thing. In the
early morning you can smell the smell of bacon cooking in my kitchen. At night
you can see a woman on the balcony walking back and forth. Mrs. Dow would
reportedly walk out onto the balcony in the evening to call her children in for
bed. The balcony is currently very fragile and cannot be stepped on. The barn
or carriage house was rebuilt after the fire. The upstairs was where the field
hands would sleep. A tall man has been reported as sitting on the top of the
stairs removing his boots. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Other than the servants
quarters the house is very warm and inviting. Having spent my summers there as
a pre-teen I can say, the spirits that inhabit the home are very nice and it is
not at all a scary place. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Buckskin cemetery on Buckskin
road is one of the most haunted places in Defiance County. So much so that even
the local Sheriff's office will chide you or deny existence of these happenings
just to keep people away, but ask anyone other then the sheriff's office and
all know of "Buck Buck" and warn you not to go to this place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">There is...something (some
call it a large bigfoot looking thing, and others say that it is an
overpowering feeling of extreme danger that makes you want to run away) that is
in this place. And only the very foolish do not take heed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Large handprints appear on
cars with dents around them like something was pushing very hard, yet no sound
is ever heard and nothing is seen. People are shoved roughly to the ground and
sprains are common. Strange lights and movement are seen inside this cemetery
at night even though the gates are locked and the fence is too high for anyone
to crawl over or under. Neighbors report on some nights, moaning's and cry's
are heard coming from this graveyard and that is when the neighbors close the
blinds and lock the doors and windows. Pets are brought indoors as some have
vanished never to be seen again and others will steadfast refuse to go outside
again after dark. One pet dog refuses to even enter the part of the yard that
faces this place and has tried to bite people that attempt to take him into
this part of the yard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">A former Defiance College
Professor and his son tried to document this, and returned the next day visibly
white and shaken and both have refused to speak of what happened to this day.
If asked they will go pale and deny it or just turn and walk away refusing to
say anything. The last we know of them they moved over three and a half hours
away from here and when asked why, they replied "you already know
why."<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Whatever resides in
"Buck Buck" cemetery does not take kindly to strangers nor to people
who stay after dusk, and will even play tricks on you during the day by causing
you to see movement where none should be. If you decide to visit this place and
this happens to you, take the warning and leave quickly or you too just might
end up as one of this "thing's" many true believers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hello - I recently submitted
a ghost story and wanted to submit another.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This one is about the experiences I had while living in the first house
my hubby and I bought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The Haunted House on Mine
Hill ----My hubby and I bought our first house in 1998.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a cute cottage style house on a
picturesque street called Mine Hill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
the first 18 months or so things were normal but suddenly we started having
weird little things happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The 1st
thing - and admittedly the oddest - was that everytime I washed my face at
night I would take off my top so I wouldn't get makeup or water on my shirt and
when I had my eyes closed I would feel a tickle on my back always on the left
side right by my bra strap.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was so
strong a sensation that the 1st time it happened I though it was my hubby<span style="">&nbsp; </span>joking around and I was scoulding him saying
that if he caused me to get cleanser in my eyes I would get him! After I rinsed
my face off I turned to playfully reprimand him and no one was there!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I finished up and walked into the bedroom and
ask him about it and he had no idea what I was talking about.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This happened almost every night!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just eventually got used to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It wasn't really spooky because there was a
playful, teasing feel to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next
thing that began to happen was that very late at night the TV would sometimes
turn off by itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We also began to
hear very loud crashing sounds as though pictures had fallen off the wall<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and when we went to investigate nothing would
be out of place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Things only seemed to
happen when my hubby and I were home but finally, we had an occurance when my
mom was visting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She and I were sitting
in the living room talking about my grandfather who had been dead for about 10
years years - he was a BIG believer in the paranormal - and we suddenly heard
the oven timer go off in the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Odd becasue we were not cooking and that timer had not been touched in a
long time because I always used the microwave timer when I cooked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got up and turned it off and we were both
saying that it was so strange especially given the subject of our conversation
so we return to the living room and just as we are about to sit down the timer
goes off again!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We both were amazed
because you can excuse away the first occurance but to have it happen twice is
crazy!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next weird thing was I began
to hear a man call my name from another room, for instance, if I was in the
living room I would hear a man call my name from the bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was faint but distinct and this would happen
only when I was alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I told my
hubby he sort of jokingly said that our ghost must be male and given that he
tickles my back when my shirt was off he must like me!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As absurd as that is,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it did freak me out a little I must admit!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">So this stuff continued to
happen the entire time we lived there but we just kind of got used to it. After
living there for 6 years we started to consider moving up and buying a nicer
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first night we talked about
selling our house the smoke detector in the hall went off at three in the
morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We jumped out of bed<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in a panic and we found that everything was
ok.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day we checked the detector
and changed the batteries just in case there was a problem with them but a few
days later it happened again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it happened so frequently that we
took the batteries out and only used the the detectors in the kitchen and
living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I finally came to the
conclusion that this was the ghost's way of saying he did not approve of us
leaving!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We sold our home in August of
2004 and the movers were packing everything up and we decided to go around to
the neighbors and say goodbye and what our next door neighbor told us explained
it all!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were chatting with him
telling him about our new home and how we would miss this house because it had
been our 1st home<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and he said that the
previous owners ( he remained friends with them after they moved)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>felt the same when they moved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said they had raised their children there
and told him that would always love the house because of the wonderful memories
it held for them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he said something
that absolutely freaked me out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went
on the say what a tragedy that about a year and a half after the previous
owners left that the man had been killed in an accident!!!! <span style="">&nbsp;</span>As my hubby and I walked away we looked at
each other and we knew both who our ghost was. The previous owner had died
about 18 months after leaving the house and that's when our paranormal
experiences began and all long my hubby had said he felt it was a male
ghost....I cannot explain this but I do know that nothing like this has
happened since we moved to our new home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Oh and by the way, the only person who tickles me now is my hubby!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">So far I have 3 spirits in my
home. One is a man who appears in a black sillouette and I've had 4 people
confirm it. 3 of which have had him stand over her more than once. My best
friend has had him stand over her 2 times, she also claims that the spirit
followed me to my new home. My mother says that I have a Gardian Angel, but I'm
not sure. I was wondering if you could verify. So far, he has stood over all of
my friends and one has even heard him yell. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I also have a weird feeling
when our shitzu died. She died on my mom'sbed and ever since I feel like I'm
beeing followed and watched. This only happens when I go in to my mom's room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">One last one is when my
kitten died, she was hit by a car and killed. Before she died I would let her
into my room and she would walkon my computer desk. I have had a few
experiences dealing with her. After she had died, I was lying in bed and my
computer mouse moved causing my screen to come on. This has happened twice.
Also, she used to sleep on my bed and after she had died, I was in bed and the
space between my legs, covers and all, made a depression as if she was lying
down. It frightened me very much so I jumped out of bed and turned my light on
and she was sitting on my bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have
since switched rooms and since has been freezing cold in that room. I also get
the feeling that I am being watched.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In 1971 I was 9 years old and
about to move from the area of Midway Airport in Chicago to a brand new house
in the suburb of Palos Hills.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ours was
the first house built in a brand new development.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we first looked at the area it was a
large farm with a apple and pear orchard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The roads had just been put in and they were selling the lots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We bought a lot on 84th ave directly across
from the small orchard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As they were
building our new house, our family would go to the site and take home movies
and pictures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My folks were very proud
of their new house in the Burbs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As they
excavated the site for the basement, they uncovered numerous Indian artifacts
such as pottery, tools, and arrowheads.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When we closed on the finished house, my Grandmother and I stayed the
night in the house and the rest of the family came the next day with the moving
truck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the first night I kept
hearing footsteps.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">As the years went on, we all
would hear footsteps and creaking steps on the stairway and upstairs
hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several times my Dad would come
into my room and tell me to stop walking around at night and I would tell him
that it was not me but the ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
could hear the footsteps actually come into my room and I would hide under the
covers so my Dad thought it was me walking the floors at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I hit my teen years and would stay up
late, I could hear the front door open and then the footsteps go upstairs and down
the hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Funny thing is the front door
was locked with a dead bolt so it actually didn't open but you still heard it
open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I began talking to the ghost when
he would come in to the house at night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I would say hi to it, and goodnight to it when I went to bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">After high school, I enlisted
in the Navy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last weekend I lived in
the house before I went in the service was when it happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was getting ready for bed for the last time
in this house and I went to the upstairs hall bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was dark and as I entered the bathroom I
flipped on the light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the light came
on and I looked in the mirror, there he was plain as day in full color.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Standing next to me and just back of my right
side was an Indian!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was a full body
and looked as solid as anyone, wearing a loincloth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was just looking at me in the mirror.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was frozen in place for about 5 seconds
just looking at this vision in the mirror.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I then spun around to look directly at him and there was nothing next to
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked back at the mirror but he
was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never felt threatened all
through the years and I guess he showed himself to me because I would actually
talk to him and maybe he knew it was my last night in the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My folks sold the house and
moved two years later but they sold the house to a cousin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My folks never told them about our
Ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 2007, I returned to the house
for the first time in 24 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had to
ask if they ever "Heard" anything in the house at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was happy to hear that they have heard
someone walk the stairs, hallway and back bedroom almost every night since they
bought the house from my Folks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
friend the indian is still on watch.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Research showed the land was actually the land of the Potowatami tribe
so I am guessing he was a Potowatami Brave.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This is my experience at the
Bersley Dorm in the fall of 1991.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I was a senior in high school
visiting a friend who was a year older and a freshman at the Art School on
University of Michigan&#8217;s North Campus. We slept in her dorm room which she
shared with a roommate who was gone for the night. I slept in the top bunk and
when night came, we drifted off to sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">&#8230;I woke to a solid thump on
my forehead by a palm. I jolted upright and looked around the room. Looked
below at my friend <st1:PersonName w:st="on">Karen</st1:PersonName> sleeping
soundly. I then got very afraid. I believed in spirits. I slowly drifted back
to sleep, but was suddenly put under a trance. I couldn&#8217;t open my eyes or &#8216;get
outta&#8217; my body. I screamed on the inside and all around me I could hear the
effects of a party going on, there were voices of people laughing and having a
good time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I then felt a cold hand move
up and down my body, like a male thick hand feeling my breasts and private area
up. It was a cold, tingly feeling. I was going crazy trying to open my eyes and
scream . Then as quick as it came, it left.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I opened my eyes and looked around. Nothing but dark quiet. One whole
side of my body was cold to the touch. I felt so exposed and vulnerable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Of course my friend was
knocked out with sleep. I laid back down and remained awake until the morning
and promptly left.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">when I was 16 I woke in the
middle of the night , I lived in a Trailer court in painted <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Post</st1:City> <st1:State w:st="on">Ny</st1:State></st1:place> . I
was awakened by a Noise coming from the living room, I ran out to see what it
was and someone around the age of 25 to 30 was sitting in a reclined state in
my fathers chair, I froze scared out of my wits then finally had enough courage
to ask, Do I know you , he said I am your brother Philip.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I ran to my room screaming
and I woke my father up by screaming.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">he ran to my room asking what
was wrong with me I said there is someone in your chair.He ran out to see who
it was he came back and stated to me there is no one there were you sitting in
my chair? I said no a man was he said well come look and I went to see that the
chair was still reclined back as someone was sitting in it. as to this day I
remember it very well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">when I told my Mother of my
experience she informed me she had a Miscarriage a few years before I was born
and she had named him Phillip, I had goose bumps !<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Well how do I start this very weird
story. Well I guess from the beginning, I work at a place where I have to go to
the basement to get supplies and ect and everytime I go down to the basement I
am o.k. in certain area's of the basement. I get to an area that just gives me
the creeps and I get goosebumps and I just have a weird sensation through out
my body of someone watching me or in the room with me. I decided to do any
experiment and I took my camera down to the basement and just take pictures of
the whole area in the basement and when I got to the creepy or spooky part of
the basement I just had a weird feeling that someone was there with me and I am
so scared to go to the basement alone I have a friend of mine go with me and he
would follow me through the basement while I am taking the pictures and I was
about to take one last picture of this door way that freaks me out from the
inside of the dark room. I was focusing on the door way and I backed up to get
a better view and I felt like I ran into a box or something and so I moved to
one side and it was still touching me and then I moved to the other side and I
said---- Ed what the h*** am I backing into and he said - what I said- what am
I backing into or what is touching my back, am I touching a box or something
and he said what are you talking about there is nothing behind you <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I looked behind me to see what was
touching my back and there was absolutely nothing behind me and I said-- OH SH**!!!!!
Oh my God - Oh my God and I turned off my camera and ran back up stairs. But
the wierd part was when I got home and I went to bed and the next morning I
decided to see what my camera had on it for pictures and if there was anything
that is not normal that should be in the photo's and all of them was just fine
just pictures of junk in the basement!!! Until the one picture that I first
took of the door way that leads into the spooky room that freaks me out
everytime I go down to the basement. I stood in the hall and took the picture
of the door way that leads into the spooky room and there is something in that
picture..... When you first look at it you really see nothing.... until you
start to zoom in and then that is were all sh** breaks loose....you zoom in and
from what I can see is a young man about 25 - 30yrs old just sitting there with
his knees up and his arms across them and just has his head tilted just a bit
and looking right at me as I was taking his picture. You can see his hair
parted on the side and eyes and nose and shape of his whole face. I will send
you the photo and you tell me if you see what I see. But the funny thing is
when I felt something touching my back was taken shortly after this picture of
the young man was taken and that would have meant he would have been behind me
when I was taking the last picture because my back was to him when I took that
last picture and then freaked out and ran back up stairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I have two stories that I
would like to share.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have wondered if
it is because I love my animals so much that God has allowed two of my pets to
visit me after they were gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess
it is something that I will understand when I have left this earth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My stories are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I have loved animals my whole
life and lost my cat, Domino, whom I loved dearly, several years ago. I had him
for 15 years and he was about 17 when he died due to complications from kidney
failure. After he died I got two kittens from a local shelter. I named them
Joshua and Caleb. They would often wake me up in the mornings, jumping on the
bed and running across me. There were many times that I would lie in bed after
waking up and close my eyes, not wanting to get up. I would then hear a noise
like one of my cats jumping on the bed and then feel what I thought was one of
them walking around on the bed. When I would look around to see which one of
them had joined me there would not be anything there. This has continued even
though I moved to a new location.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In February, I lost Caleb,
who was only 5 years old. He had been sick due to a bladder obstruction since
early in the month but that had cleared and I put him on the new food that the
vet recommended. My roommate arrived at home after work one day and Caleb was
running ahead of her, excited to get the little bit of canned food he would get
every afternoon. All of a sudden, he collapsed and seemed to have a seizure. My
roommate rushed him to the vet, whose office was only 5 minutes away, but he
could not detect a heartbeat. Needless to say, I was devastated when I found
out what had happened. About 2 weeks later I was woken up in the middle of the
night by the sound of Caleb's meow, which was very distinctive. I sat up in bed
and saw what looked like Caleb except for the fact that he was glowing. I could
even see the stripes that he had. I put my hand out to touch him, the glowing
dissipated and he just faded away. I think that he came back to visit me
because of the deep sadness that I had due to his loss. I still miss him but I
am glad that I was able to give him a good home for the time that he was here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Years ago when my family
owned this house, me and my older brother on two different occasions saw the
same ghost of a woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When each of us
saw her we were alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My experience was on a new
years, I was home alone and everyone else was out celebrating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was 13-15 years old at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in my basement (furnished) and around
2am I heard my mom call my name loud and clear saying my name and calling out
that she was home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ran up the stairs
to the main floor of the house and looked around and no one was home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went out side figuring she went to the car,
and her car was not there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I go back
in the basement to turn off all the lights because I was freaked out, and went
and was watching tv in the upstairs family room, and no more than 10-15 min
later after being up there i see a woman wearing a dress like this
http://www.rossetti.vispa.com/c18-2.html<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>but white (not exact but similar) with her hair up in a bun/pinned up
standing right in my kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
standing there like she was walking by the door and stopped with her head
turned looking over her shoulder in the room at me like she was trying to make
sure I was alright.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was froze staring
at her for till she turned her head facing it forward and she moved down the
hall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My older brother saw the same
woman but her whole body was facing him and he said it looked like there was a
fan pointed at her and her hair was down and blowing around and so was her
dress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did not call to him in my
mothers voice like what happened with me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Also unlike me once he saw her he hid his head in the pillow, and only
saw her for like 5 sec before hiding.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I know friends that would
stay over would say that they would hear foot steps at night like someone was
walking around (which is the area directly below where I saw the woman)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Also me and my brother would
always get a strange feeling like we were not the only people in the basement
and like there was something bad down there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>previous owners use to play with Ouija boards in the basement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One time door closed by itself going to the
basement (door knob was on backward so you had to turn the knob to close it)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Also before moving out of the
house there were a few times where the floor would start shaking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I lived in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Dubuque</st1:City> <st1:State w:st="on">Iowa</st1:State></st1:place>
up until I was 3yrs old. It was me, mom and my sister who is only 13months
younger then I am. We stayed at my grandparents house for a while, until my mom
got us our own apartment. My grandparents house was down in older <st1:City w:st="on">Dubuque</st1:City>, though most of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Dubuque</st1:City></st1:place> is old! It was off of <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Lincon Ave.</st1:address></st1:Street> Right
across the street from an "old folks home". The house was beautiful,
big white house with black trim. Still is, well it was last year when I was
back. My grandma had 7 kids, one of which was my mom. Of course I was so small
when we lived there I dont personally remember encountering anything. Though
the stories could go on forever between the seven kids (my aunts and uncles)
and my grandparents. They eventaully sold the house when I was oh about 11yrs
old. And that was about the time they started telling me stories. Guess they
never figured I was old enough to hear them. The one that sticks out in my head
the most is one my grandma told me. (who has since passed on, MISS YOU
Grandma!) It was early one weekday morning and everyone had gone to work or
school. She went down stairs and layed down on the couch, which was pushed up
against a half wall that led up the stairs. Her head being next to the bottom
of the stairs. she closed her eyes and layed there for a moment in silence,
until she heard someone slowly coming down the stairs. She thought maybe my
aunt who was living with her at the time had not gone into work that day, so
she called out to her, "ande?" No one answered, "Bob?" my
grandpas name she called out next. Though she knew it couldnt be him, as he was
off to work at 4am and had been long gone for the day. The foot steps stopped,
and she felt something lightly brush their hand, or whatever it might of been
over the top of her head, just barley touching her hair. My grandmas first
language was spanish, she learned english later in life. When she felt this
brush over her head, she freaked out and the first thing out of her mouth was
"lord protect me!" in spanish. She jumped up swung around to face the
staricase and heard something moan and thump back up the steps, but nothing was
there! She herself ran out side, in her pj's hair a mess for all the neighbors
to see! <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">When the house was sold,
after basically raising 7 children in it they figured they didnt need such a
big house and wanted a ranch style home in their old age... they moved to
Norman Oklahoma. The house was sold to a family with 2 small children, a
husband and a wife. An aunt of mine and an uncle of mine still resided in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Dubuque</st1:City> <st1:State w:st="on">Iowa</st1:State></st1:place>.
When my aunt got married the whole family went back to good ol' <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Dubuque</st1:place></st1:City> for the wedding.
Old neighbors, of the haunted house on Lincon house were invited to the wedding
and old friends too. The day after the wedding us girls, my 3 aunts my mom and
my sister and my who was 14 now went out for lunch. We met the next door
neighbors that they grew up with at the resturant. A while into chatting one of
the neighbors that my mom and aunts grew up with living next door said they
knew the people who lived in the old house on Lincon and were in fact pretty
good friends with them. She suggested that if we all wanted to she could see if
they would let us in and show us around, let us see what they had done with the
place as far as remolding and redecorating. Everyone agreeded and were all
excited to go back to the home they grew up in. We had it arranged to go over
there that evening for drinks and a tour! Of course all I was drinking was
apple juice! We arrived the family showed us all around and it brought back so
many memories, mostly for my mom and aunts as I was so little when we did live
there. When the tour and memories were over we all sat at the table for some
drinks. Just wrapped up in conversation, laughing remembering when the mother
that lived there sat quietly for a moment sort of staring at nothing. I
remember her blank expression. It was like she was trying to think of a way to
bring up soemthing that may be offensive or that she may be thought of as crazy
for talking about. It sort of broke in the conversations and while everyone
sort of sat quiet for a second taking a sip of their drinks the mother jsut out
of no where asked..."when you all lived here, did you ever hear a baby
crying or a woman crying?" Everyone sat quietly and answered no. Even
though that was a lie. the mother continued "yeah we have an infant and
thought many times that it was our child crying from the other room, but our
4yr old was holding him one day and the crying was coming from upstairs, and we
were all in the living room." So the mother continued on with her stange
noises and cold spots. All the while none of my aunts nor my mother say
anything. Shortly after that conversation begins we all leave. I later asked my
mom why no one told the lady any of their stories about the house being haunted
and she said that when you buy a house you are supposed to tell the buyer
everything about it, even if you sound crazy if you tell them something like we
think its haunted. And that house was def haunted. There was another time when
I was 18yrs old when I went back to visit my aunt in <st1:City w:st="on">Dubuque</st1:City>,
from <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
which is where I live now. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Dubuque</st1:place></st1:City>
is a pretty friendly place and so we drove by the old house on Lincon about 8
in the evening on a summer night. We got brave and decided to go knock on the
door and see if the person who lived there now, (we werent sure if it was the
same family) would let us in to look around again and reminice. To our surprise
a woman answered the door, and we didnt recognize her. It was a new family
living there. We said who we were, and told her it was ok if she didnt want to
let us in because we were strangers and it was sort of an odd request. She
smiled and laughed and said no of course come in! She walked us upstairs showed
us all the rooms. My aunt had an experience in one of the rooms upstairs where
she swore she saw a figure of a woman with long black hair in a white night
gown on several occasions. This room was always the coldest rooms in the house,
no matter how hot it was out (No A/C) that room was always freezing and the
closet door never stayed shut, and was even colder. When we got to this room,
it was a baby nursery at this time, and my aunt not thinking sort of got a
chill and said "uhoo this is the ghosts room, Ednas." (She named her)
My aunt sort of looked at the lady like oooppps, and the lady was like oh no
this whole house is haunted. We hear crying and moaning and steping up and down
the steps, cabintes open on their own we hear doors open and shut. This is the
3rd family that has lived there, including my own. All of which agree the house
is haunted. I cant wait for our next adventure, maybe Ill be bold enough again
to go knock on the door and see who lives there now, and ask for a tour! Im 23
now, so its been a while! There are so many stories and I hope I havent bored
you with this. I could go on forever telling the stories my family has told me.
I think it's be way interesting to have one of thoes ghost hunter shows go
investagate it, and see what they find! Thanks for listening!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">By: GSBUF@aol.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I've just been reading some
of the ghostly experiences on the shadowlands website, and felt that I should
write and share my own.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I've had several experiences
over the years, that I can't readily explain. There are all the usual, hairs
standing up, cold breezes, feelings of being watched etc. but two specific
incidents stand out as being something more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The first of these happened
to me as I lay alone in bed, at our holiday flat, in a small seaside resort, on
an Island just off the west coast of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Scotland</st1:place></st1:country-region>, about five years ago.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The flat itself, is a small
one-bedroom property, on the ground floor, and was formerly used as a shop in
years gone by. It has a pleasant feel, and people often remark how comfortable
and "homely" it feels. I haven't experienced any incidents prior to
the one I'm relating here, with the small exception of sometimes catching a
movement, out of the corner of my eye, near the front porch area. I always dismissed
this as someone passing the front door, until one night my wife looked up at
exactly the same time and said "Did you see that?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We both thought that the figure of a woman
had gone from left to right across the inside of our small porch. I immediately
jumped up and looked up and down the street outside, and you can see for
several hundred yards in each direction, but there was nothing there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Anyway, on the night of the
first incident that I am going to relate, I had locked up, gone to bed, and fallen
asleep, only to wake up with a start, sometime in the early morning around 4am.
All of my senses were screaming at me that something was very wrong, and at
first I thought that someone had broken into the flat or something. It was then
that I tried to get up, to investigate what was wrong, and realised that I was
completely and totally paralysed. I had managed to open my eyes when I woke up,
but now could not even move them. It was then that I felt a horrible, huge,
powerful and threatening presence, which I perceived to be in the hallway, just
outside my closed bedroom door. I can only describe it as being like a large
angry bull or something, pacing the hallway, breathing heavily. I lay
completely motionless, still paralysed, staring at the ceiling, when I suddenly
realised that the presence was moving. It had managed to get through the (still
closed) door into the bedroom, and was gliding, floating, silently across the
foot of my bed. The presence felt very evil and powerful, and I have to admit,
that by this point I was absolutely terrified, and by the way, I am 6'3"
tall, fairly intelligent, logical, well-built and not easily scared! The
presence continued to move, silently across the room, to a point where the
bedroom window is, and, as it made its' way through the area where the closed
window is, the feeling of dread and fear lifted, and within seconds, the
paralysis completely stopped, and I was able to look across to the window and
doorway. Both were still closed, and there was no sign of any disturbance. It
may or may not be significant that the bedroom window overlooks the entrance
path which leads to an old church?<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The second incident happened
about 12 months ago. We have a young son now, who was about 2 then, and it was
quite a nice day in the quiet village where I live, in west central Scotland,
so I had decided to take him out in his 3-wheeler pram for a walk. Shortly
after leaving the house, I felt like we were being watched, or possibly even
followed. There were the rustle of leaves in the hedgerow or small stones
rattling softly on the road behind us, even though there was no breeze. I felt
the hairs rise on the back of my neck, and several times, I whirled round
quickly, to try and catch sight of whatever was there, but never did. It was then
that I decided I didn't want to go any further away from the centre of the
village, out into the country, so I doubled back and headed for the local
play-park, so my son could play on the swings etc. You'd think that the
cheerful surroundings of a children's play park would have relieved the
feelings, but it actually got worse. This continued for about 5 minutes, until
I felt drawn to look across the field which borders the back of the park.
There, about 100 yards away stands a line of trees, at the lower end of the
field, this is met at right angles, by a second row of trees heading away into
the distance, in a second field. My eyes suddenly focused on the tree which
stands nearest the junction of the two rows of trees. This tree was shaking
back and forth, rhythmically, and forcefully, as if being physically shaken.
The trees on either side, as well as the row of trees heading away at right
angles did not move at all. It was very still, and there wasn't even the
slightest breeze, but this one tree was shaking very much, and all of the
others nearby were completely motionless.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This was pretty scary, but I
was determined to find out what was causing it, so I left the park, and headed
down the road which would take me to a point directly at the end of the row of
trees, so that I could look down the row, to see if anything could be causing
the tree to move. I felt the same "following" presence all the way
down the road, to the end of the line of trees, and even heard twigs snap
behind us on at least three occasions, but every time I turned round, nothing
was there. There was nothing to see, along the line of trees, and by the time I
got there, the one moving tree had stopped. I continued walking a little
further, to see if anything else would happen, but a couple of minutes later,
the feeling of being followed suddenly stopped. The presence left, and
everything immediately felt fine. I went back over our route, and found nothing
out of order. I've never seen anything else like this since, and I still can't
explain it. There was no wind to move the tree, and even if it was a freak gust
or something, it lasted for several minutes, and didn't affect any of the
surrounding trees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I am happy for these
incidents to be posted and shared via the website if required.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">If anyone has any thoughts on
either of these incidents, please feel free to get in touch!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hey i am a really big fan of
the site.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">A few years ago i lost my
grandmother it was a really hard blow for my whole family but most of all me.
One day we where all praying for her soul to go in peace when something really
creepy happened we had a little table in the middle of the living room with her
picture in the middle and flowers on each side of the picture when all of a
sudden i<span style="">&nbsp; </span>show the picture moving and the
flowers fell to the ground. It scared me<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>because their was no way it could have happen cause the way everything
was set up her picutre was exactly in the middle of the table and the flowers
side by side and i am the only one that saw it slide off the table and their
was a big candle in front of the picture and it was not touch at all. the weird
thing about it was that it was lighted and it turn off when the flower fell and
their was no wind at all that night. i would like to think it was her way
of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>telling me she was ok.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
