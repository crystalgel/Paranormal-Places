The Patient<br>
<br>
By: tori_wants_u@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
my mother and i just moved in with my grandmother because of some
problems with her boyfriend. my grandmothers house is very big with 5
bedrooms upstairs and 2 downstairs. she lives with her new husband joe
who's wife had dies some years ago while his kids were in high school
(they are now in there 40's). anyway my grandparents room is downstairs
and my mother and i's room is upstairs right next to each other.<br>
one day i ewnt out with my friends to do a little bit of shopping and
my mother had told me to be home by 5:30 because i had to babysit my
little brother and sister becuase my mom had to be at work by six for
her 12 hour shift. my grandparents were away at there cabin for a month
so they couldnt watch them. when my friends mom drove me home at about
9:30. i was scared because my mom will sumtimes not go to work if im
not home on time. so as we came up to the country house i looked to see
if my moms bedroom light was on indicating that she was home, it was
and someone was pulling her curtains shut. i told my friends that i was
going to be in trouble because my mother didnt go to work and they
apologized for keeping me to late. as i opened the door to my house i
got the chills down my back as i noticed a note on the door. it was
from my little sister saying my brother was being a brat so she had
called her grandma to come and get her and she had taken mitchel. i
found this weird since i swear i saw my mother in her room. i then
began to think that mabe someone else was in the house with me so i
grabbed a kitchen knife and my dog and headed up the stairs which are
so well put together that they make no sound if you want to tip toe up
them. as i neared the top i looked around the corner to my mothers room
and the door was wide open and no lights were on what soever i ran to
her room and flicked the light switch on. no one was in there! but it
was very cold and i could feel someone watching me. i turned the light
off and went downstairs. as i sat there with the tv on all i could
think of was what might be upstairs, i decided not to dwell on it and
that i might ahve just fooled myself into seeing sumthing there. a
couple minutes into my show i heard a big bang from directly above me
which was my moms room. i again mustered up my courage and grabbed my
knife and dog and headed back upstairs. once again her light was off
and when i turned it on there was nuthing out of the ordinary so i look
at the rest of the rooms to see if anything fell over and found
nothing. i then went back downstairs and went to bed in my grandparents
room. the next day when my mother got home i told her what had
happened. she told me that when she was upstairs one day while i was at
school the dog started parking histarically at the ceiling. knowing we
have to attic for little animals to get into she ran downstairs
frightened. she also told me that my grandmothers new husbands old wife
had cancer and that she had suffered many years the bedroom my mother
now has. she died in the hospital but still comes back. i can feel her
watching me as i write this story to you. she knows what im doing and
just slammed my mothers door. i hope this will give me a higher respect
with her now that she knows i can feel her and understand what she went
through alone. thnk you for reading my story.<br>

Our Ghosts<br>
<br>
By: pony1@westpa.net<br>
<br>
HI in my house we have a ghost it's a man I believe about in his
sixty's. The first encounter started when we lived in are house for
about two months. My grandmother was siting in a chair reading a book
and my father doing something though I'm not sure what I was only two
or three at the time. Well as my grandmother read the book she could
hear my tricycle on are front porch now please keep in mind we have an
enclosed porch. The tricycle was rolling back in fourth on are porch
squeaking. My dad and grandmother had fought I had got out of bed and
was out on the porch so my father opened the front porch door and I was
not out there and the tricycle was on the other end of the porch not
were my father had put it. Another incident happened when my older
sister was in are living room everyone was in bed she then fell asleep
on the couch. My sister woke up and standing there looking down at her
was a man she said you could not see him because it was so dark. All I
remember is waking up and my sister screaming her head off! I got out
of bed and went into my parents room my sister was jumping on my
parents bed yelling and screaming though I don't remember what she was
screaming. My dad kept asking her whats wrong? Whats wrong? I have
never seen my sister that scared in her life and untill this day my
sister will not sleep in the downstairs alone or be in are home alone.
I have exspearenced him to. One day my mom was at work and I decided to
clean the house for her. I had just finished the living room and
decided to do the kitchen. I was vacuming the floor and I turned over
and I saw someone standing there but I just saw his shoes he was
wearing these boots. I jumped and yelled who jeese! and he was gone at
first I fought maybe it was just the cat but then I relized come on the
cat? I don't think the cat wears boots. And I used to be homeschooled
and I remember siting at are kitchen table doing school work and I
swaer to God my I could feel my hair being played with slowly being
picked up and droped and I would touch the back of my hair because it's
a bit anoying when you feel your hair being played with. I allso have
had things of mine go up misingand are house has been looked over many
times for the items but we have not found any of them. The reason I
know it is a man is because the woman that sold my parents the house
her husband died in the back yard and he loved this house or so I'm
told I think he is just trying to make sure it's taken care of. there
are many other incidents but I think I will stop hear. <br>

Homeland Haunting<br>
<br>
By: laurie_hallberg@sbcglobal.net <br>
<br>
GG Grandfather built "early prairie" style home on Indian Grant Land in
NE Oklahoma.&nbsp; My mom and dad have reported water faucets and
lights going on/off. This past weekend, we were talking about him in
the living room and a cup flew off the kitchen table onto the floor.
Nothing scary, just interesting.&nbsp; He's family.&nbsp; I have always
felt a presence.&nbsp; Richard Henry Crotzer 1858-1945.&nbsp; He told
MY grandmother that he remembers soldiers marching in the streets of
Terre Haute Indiana for the Civil War. <br>
When I was younger, I remember seeing an "orb" floating around in the
kitchen and into the living room even before I knew what an orb
was.&nbsp; This house was built around 1900-1908.&nbsp; There was a
cabin on the property then Grandpa built the kitchen as a "summer
kitchen" then the rest of the house was added on later.&nbsp; Upstairs,
you are immediately in the first room, then walk thru the second room
to get to the 3rd room.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were 7 or 8 children.&nbsp;
GG Grandma, Fanny Todd, died in 1918 during the Great Influenza
epidemic.&nbsp; She was registered as a 1/4 indian, but was more than
likely close to, if not, full blooded Loyal Shawnee of Kansas. <br>

My Wall<br>
<br>
By: sparkling_gem@hotmail.co.uk<br>
<br>
hello i just wanted to tell you my encounter with ghosts.<br>
I was watching a real horror movie with my brother but know the movie
is band (thats how horrifying it is) i went to go to sleep when i saw
this blueish face on my wall, from the start i knew it was a ghost. i
was really really cold, it was about 12.00 this face stayed till
6.00am. Probably because my mum came to my room. I did tell her about
it she said it was my imagination but i knew she knew it was true. This
face i saw was blueish greyish, it was a man with a grin on his face
and red eyes. I told my friend who was older than me it this time. (i
was 11 years old) she was 19. The real scary bit was that she seen
EXATLY the same ghost on a tree. This house that i lived in was pretty
old and looked like it been there in world war 1 or 2 because there was
a basement which was where the people hid. My brother and mum saw quite
alot of freaky things in this house. one other storie :<br>
My brother was in my bedroom speaking to my cousin when suddently he
saw two eyes lookin at him which was right infront of him. He ran
downstairs when whatever the thing was pushed him down. Gladly he didnt
get hurt, but my mum encounterd something aswell but that seemed as if
the ghost was really friendly.&nbsp; We have gladly moved out of the
house and the house that i lived before that was really freaky aswell.<br>

Personal Haunting in Massachusetts<br>
<br>
By: alycia274@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I am from Norton, Massachusetts. I lived in a house on a street which
was definetly haunted. The house was about 220 years old or so. It was
the home to a family known as the Whites. The family had a wealthy
judge who lived there and he even had a personal sidewalk made that
lead to the trainstation near the center of town. (which is longer in
use) We moved out but we still own the house. The house had an eerie
feeling and a dirt basement that we all disliked going into. There were
instances of the Tvs going on and off and showers and such but more
often than not we heard footsteps and one night distinct Whistling but
myself and a friend were the only ones home. A whisk once flew out of
the sink when my back was turned. Many times the cats would spazz out
in my bedroom and they would run out and i went in and books were on
the ground. It creeps me out just writing this email. I never felt that
they were bad. Just trying to be known of their presence. As a child
living there I saw a mans shadow. My father came from NY to visit and
he stood in the driveway looking up at the upstairs window and said he
saw 2 children. The house has 14 acres of land and to the right there
is the family cemetary. The house once had a stable and multiple sheds
which burned and were taken down. The house is definetly creepy for
those who arent used to it. But I just figured Id share my stories with
you.<br>
<br>
My House Experiences<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp; dorion@cccb.ca<br>
<br>
<br>
Hi, My name is Marc and I used to live in a haunted house for about 10 years.<br>
I know it was haunted because all members of my family had the same
feeling and saw some things. It all started when I was about 6 years
old. We moved to this house in a small town in Quebec. The house was an
older home, about 60-70 years of age.<br>
I will tell you a little about how the house was divided so you know
exactly where you are situated when I tell the story. First you came in
the front entrance, on your left you had the stairway going to the
second level, on you right you had the living room. Then you walked
about 10 feet and you had the kitchen and the dining room. On your left
you had the door to the basement and right beside it, the door to go in
the back yard. <br>
For the second level you came up the stairs and you had the bathroom on
your left, right in front of you was my parent&#8217;s room and then on your
right you had the guest room and at the end of the hall you had my room.<br>
Ok like I said, it all started when I was 6. I used to play ball with a
little boy about my age and a young woman (I&#8217;d say about 25) in my
room. We had fun and I was never scared or anything, I always felt
loved and safe in that room. It lasted about 3 years, I saw them every
day and it became routine. When my sister was born, they put her in
that room and put me in the guest room. Everything was good until about
2 years after I got in my &#8220;new room&#8221;, I started to have this uneasy
feeling like I was about to be sick every once in awhile but as soon as
I got out of the room, the feeling subsided. In the meantime, my sister
who was in my old room started talking alone and smiling when looking
at nothing and stuff like that. When my parents asked her whom she was
talking to she told them a little boy and a woman. They started to
believe me a little bit more.<br>
Anyways, getting back to me, my parents were away for a few days and I
really didn&#8217;t want to stay in the house alone so I had 4 friends to
sleep over. The second night we went to bed at around 11pm. At 2:30am
we all wake up to 6 loud thumping sounds coming from downstairs. We all
look to each other and I said: did you guys hear what I heard? .
Everyone responded yes. We all find something to protect ourselves with
and went downstairs to find. &#8230;Absolutely nobody. Everything was at it
was when we went to bed. Weird! Anyways while we were walking towards
the stairs to go back to the room, the basement door opened and slammed
really hard. We all jumped and ran to the kitchen to get knives in case
there really was someone in the house. We went to open he door to the
basement when this same sickening feeling as in the room came over us
all and then there was this smell of eggs and cabbage. We decided to go
down in the basement and when we got down there, there was nothing. We
were almost sh**ting ourselves. We all started to go back upstairs when
the lights started to turn on and off and the TV went on by itself and
the door to the laundry room opened and shut several times and at the
same time we all saw and heard the same thing, 4 big human-like shadows
and a really deep and &#8220;broken&#8221; voice that said COME HERE! Of course we
all ran outside and went to my friends house but we all still had that
sickening feeling for about 2 days. When my parents came back I told
them all about it but they didn&#8217;t believe me of course. I then said
that I wasn&#8217;t going to stay in that house anymore so I went to live
with my grandmother not far away. SHE believed me! She said she had a
bad feeling about that house. All in all, it took 1 year, a divorce and
a lot of frightening apparitions for my parents to get out of that
house. To this day they don&#8217;t want to tell me what they saw. When I
talk to them about it they say that they can&#8217;t talk about it and they
turn white as a ghost (no pun intended) and they start shaking,
literally. My dad owned the house for about 3 years after that but
rented it to people. In 3 years, there were 12 tenants in the house.
Now that I am older, I want to go back there with infrared cameras and
EMF detectors and EVP equipment to try to capture something on film or
on audio.<br>
Thanks for the opportunity to share my Encounters. I have more to share also.<br>

The French Office<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
My younger sister and I have both experienced ghostly encounters at our
school on separate occasions. My recap of the story is this:<br>
I go to an after-school care program in the library. When I leave, I
always go upstairs to put my running shoes back in the hallway beside
my fifth-grade classroom. On this particular occasion, I saw a strange
movement in the French Office out of the corner of my eye. (The French
Office is just down the hall from my classroom.) Papers on the desk
were rustling in a way only a human(or ghost) hand could move them.
Stranger still, a glowing blue orb-like thing was hovering over the
desk. A loud bang sounded. I thought that my shoe had fallen off the
shelf, so I looked around behind me, but nothing was out of the
ordinary back there. I turned back toward the office. The chair beside
the desk was tipped over, and was being lifted up by unseen hands. The
bang sounded again as the chair tipped again. Then the orb disappeared,
just as suddenly as it had appeared.<br>
My sister had a similar encounter:<br>
She was going upstairs to see if I was there as she often did. When she
turned to the French office, something caught her eye. A light was on,
although not plugged in! Then a blue wavy object flashed on and off on
the ceiling. After flashing twice, it stopped. The Tweety Bird
bobblehead on the desk began to move back and forth, then fell over. It
seemed to be lifted up again by unseen hands. <br>

My Year Long Experience<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous&nbsp; <br>
<br>
I lived in a house when I was about 12 years old that to this day,
myself as well as everyone else in my family are convinced that is
haunted.&nbsp; We moved there from a house up the street because it was
bigger.&nbsp; It was a tri level home with two bedrooms, and a bathroom
on the top level, the kitchen and the living room on the main level,
then two other bedrooms and another bathroom on the garden level.&nbsp;
It also had a finished 1/2 basement that we used as<br>
our main gathering area for the family.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mine and my brothers' rooms were<br>
on the garden level, and my mom and dads rooms were on the top level,
at the time my uncle was living with us as well, so he was in the other
room on the top level with my parents. My first experience was when I
woke to my cat growling, hissing and scratching at my legs under the
blankets, as I lifted the blankets, he relieved himself all over the
bed, and me shot out of the bed and the room never to return.&nbsp; I
would wake during the night to see small white almost fairy-like
figures dancing in and out of the mirror I had hanging on the wall next
to my bed, I would also hear things in my closet.<br>
like something was moving back and forth in the small space, almost
like it was trapped, and was trying to find a way out.&nbsp; I was a
little braver than most at the time, so I would jump up and open the
doors, and there wouldn't be anything there.&nbsp; I never spoke of any
of this to my parents.&nbsp; I thought for sure that they wouldn't
believe me.&nbsp; They figured the cat just freaked out because I had
rolled over on top of him or something.&nbsp; Then my brother would
wake up crying during the night, and would want to come in and sleep
with me, his room was right next to mine.&nbsp; He would tell me that
he felt that something had been sitting on his chest, and when he cried
out it would go away.&nbsp; He said things would move around in his
room, and often felt that something would tap him on his head while he
was asleep.&nbsp; My brother and I suffered this alone for almost 8
months before I had overheard my parents talking about how they thought
we had a ghost.&nbsp; When I heard this I ran into the room and told
them everything.&nbsp; My parents were waking up during the night
feeling like something was walking on them in their bed.&nbsp; I would
wake up crying during the night from a bad dream and she would lay
there and listen to whispers, almost like a radio that wasn't quite in
tune.&nbsp; She had a friend that she worked with who was into the
paranormal, and she asked her about it all and she had explained to her
that the ghost was pacing the house, and my mom and dads bed was laying
in it's path, and that it had probably been the reason for my cat to
freak out.&nbsp; My mom and dad moved their bed and didn't feel it
anymore, unfortunately, there really wasn't much of anything that my
brother and I could do but try to be strong.&nbsp; Over the next 4
months lights would go off and on, my cat wouldn't even come into the
house anymore, and my uncle moved out, and to this day, he refuses to
speak about what happened to him (he works in a cemetery if that
explains his nerves).&nbsp; My mom and dad couldn't put the family
through any more and moved everyone out to a safer house.&nbsp; They
were worried about it following us to our next residence, as I was just
starting puberty at the time, the medium that my mother worked with
explained to her that young girls just starting puberty were attractive
to the ghosts, and that could be why we were having such a hard time,
and that we needed to be prepared for what could happen if we
moved.&nbsp; That was 20 years ago, and we haven't experienced anything
out of the ordinary since we lived in that house.<br>

Could have been my Imagination<br>
<br>
<br>
By: Bobbie.Joe.Lozano@AlaskaAir.com<br>
<br>
I guess I will start by saying I love your site and was really excited
to find it and I must have read hundreds of stories around Halloween
last year. Now I consider myself a level headed person who believes
that some things out there just cannot be explained and maybe shouldn't
be because it would no longer be interesting. Well one day I was home
by myself and I had just jumped in the shower to get ready to pick up
the kiddies from school. I was in mid-shampoo when I heard three very
clear knocks on the door. I froze and was scared since I knew I was the
only one home.&nbsp; I didn't know what to do, all kinds of thoughts
were running threw my head like may be someone broke in and just wanted
to let me know they were there, even though it sounds insane now I
thought it could be the only explanation for the knocking. After a
minute of standing in the shower I just told myself I was hearing
things, knowing I was not, I just decided to act like it didn't happen.
I finished in the shower and after what seemed like a long time took a
deep breath and walked out of the bathroom. I fully expected someone to
be in the house or find that things were missing, but no one was in the
house and nothing was missing. I told my friends at work the next day
and they just laughed it off and told me it was my imagination because
I had been reading so many of the stories on your website.<br>
I know what happened was real but I do wonder if I brought it on
myself. I still live in the same place and nothing weird has ever
happened again which in a way I am glad. I just thought I would put
this out there to get it off my chest. <br>
Thanks again for just having such a great site.<br>

Ghost Attack<br>
<br>
By: brendajnb@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
My name is Brenda,I was reading a story the shadowlands page called
attaced by a ghost,and I decided to tell my story that is almost the
same. The truth is I was shocked to read the story because the almost
exact same thing happened to me. This happened this past February, my
husband and I were driving to Houston Tx. We live in Brownsville Tx 6
hours away. Anyway we arrived in Houston about 1:15 am and we rented a
hotel room. I remember being so tired so I practically fell asleep
quickly. I don't remember what time it was but I could almost be sure
not alot of time had passed since I fell asleep. I'm thinking it was 3
am. Anyway I was asleep and I am 100 percent sure that I was asleep
because I still remember what I was dreaming. As I am asleep dreaming I
suddenly feel something heavy sit on top of my chest, this
automatically woke me up I could hardly see anything because it was
very dark, but I could feel a presence and like a shadow on top of me
triying to choke me and hit me. I was very scared and could not
breathe. And I'm trying to struggle with it but I can't. I tried to
scream my husband's name but nothing comes out of my mouth which scares
me even more. I felt my husband next to me but he could not feel that I
was kicking and moving. BY this time I was very frightened so I started
praying, asking GOD to help me. As soon as I started praying I just
felt a relief as if whatever was attacking me moved from top of me. I
was so scared that I could not go back to sleep. I was just there so
scared to open my eyes. The weird thing is I've always heard that when
you feel a presence you feel vey cold, in my case I felt very hot, what
I'm thinking is that what ever was there was very evil. But I'm not
finished yet, the next day when my husband wakes up I tell him what
happened and insist that I was dreaming, that we were tired from tha
road that it was my imagination. I could not convince him it was not a
dream but I did convince him to change hotels. The hotel room number we
were in was 220 where this happened to me. Well we go to another hotel
about a block away and when I'm registering the girl gets ready to give
me my key she gives me room # 220. Needless to say I got frightened and
started crying. The girl shocked asked what was wrong I just let her
know I did not want that room number. So she gave me another one but I
just thought that was so weird. But to this day I am positive it was
not a dream and I am terrified of sleeping alone or with the lights
off. I even slept with a bible on top of my chest for a while. People
actually believe me now what they tell me is that it was just a demon
trying to attack me. I don't know why this happened to me, but since
that day nothing else has happened to me. i was very frightened. I just
thought I'd share my story with you.<br>

2 Unexplained Stories<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
<br>
I have two unexplained stories i would like to share with you.<br>
My grandmother passed away two years ago. She was great and we
connected very well. We had a good relationship and when we were
together we would always talk. Both of us shared a great interest in
ghost stories. Although i never had any person stories to share with
her, she had her share to tell me and to freak me out. My grandmother,
my mother and I would always catch ourselves sitting at my gram's
dining room table telling freaky stories. One day, when i was probably
11 i flat out told my grandmother and my mother that if they passed
away, i did not want them to come back and see me as a ghost, that they
could come back in a dream or something but i didnt want to be haunted
(just becuase i get to freaked out by this kind of stuff). The night
that my grandmother passed was an awful night. My house was filled with
relatives and we were all deeply upset. I was to sleep in my parents
room on the floor becuase there were to many relatives taking over the
house. That night i woke up twice. The first time i woke up and i felt
unbelievably sad and cold (It was the middle of June and the weather
was way to hot). I couldnt stop feeling cold yet i was covered in
blankets. The next thing i remember was feeling someone vividly putting
their arms around me, and i then felt warm and this feeling of
unbelievable happiness. This feeling instantly put me back to sleep. I
woke up one more time in the middle of the night with the same feeling,
and again i got the same response. I still believe to this day that
this was my grandmothers way of reaching me, in a way that i would not
freak out, but help ease my pain. <br>
I live in a really small town, not to many cars and everyone lets their
dogs pretty much run free becuase they dont go to far. I had a big
black lab named Jack. Him and my other dog had just been let out and it
was a cold night. They werent out very long when a man pulled up to my
house. I was upstairs on the computer and my mom was sleeping. My
brother answered the door and started to scream. The man had told my
brother that both of our dogs had been hit and one was not doing good
at all. We immediately rushed outside, i not knowing what to do ( Jack
was my baby) ran down the road half dressed. When i got there my
brother was already there, he had been with Jack when he was still
alive but when i arrived he wasnt. My other dog was missing and thought
to be dead as well. (Come to find out she ran away becuase she was so
spooked and came back two days later.) My family was torn. These two
dogs were such a big part of our life. That night, we all went to bed
in our own rooms. In the middle of the night i woke up to this pain on
my legs. Still being half asleep i yelled, "Jack get off of me" and
kicked my legs out. Not even thinking, the pain went away and i went
back to bed. Not even 5 minutes later again i awoke to a pain on my
legs, as if a dog (not two but one) were laying on my legs. When i
thought about this i became very scared and rushed into my parents
room. The odd thing is that Jack always slept iwth me on my legs, and i
was always kicking him off becuase he hurt me. THe next day i told my
parents and my dad became horrified. He too had woken up more than once
to a pain on his legs which felt like an animal sleeping on him. We
were scared, but very releived that Jack was still with us.<br>

you reach the top of the stairs you have to make a left sort of wrap
around . the only bathroom in the house is upstairs.as I stand now im
looking to my left and down the stairs.directly in front of me is my
sisters room, and to the left, right outside the door is a small door
to the attic on the left wall. A walkway about 2 ft long leads up to
it, this is above the first 3 to 4 steps. my room is down thehall from
this and the bathroom is of the hall leading to my room.<br>
At night you can hear what sounds like yelling whispers in the hall
near the attic door, as if the male and female are having an argument
and dont want to wake children. At about 1:00am you can hear footsteps
up and down the stairs over and over. If im at home alone wont go
upstairs because I took showers at home alone and it would sound like
someone was home and in the house then I would get out and there was
nobody home.I've told my dad but he says its the house settling I know
its not, my sisters have seen the ghosts. I got used to it but my
little sister hasnt. I just keep my radio on and my door pulled tightly
shut.<br>

Hotel Raj Kiran<br>
<br>
By: aaryan6752@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I am Arvind frm Bombay, India. I read the list of places haunted by
ghost in India. I would like to share my piece of experiance with u. It
was Augest 2004, or early Sept Approx. I and my wife planed a small
holiday in LONAVLA, 100 km frm Bombay. All the good hotels were full,
and we went to Hotel RAJ KIRAN, even there all the rooms were full, but
the manager told us tht he can arrange us a room in 2 hours, till then
he gav us a room in ground floor. At first the room was looking good,
so we decided tht to continue in the same room. As we checked in tht
room. the climate of the room changed completely, room was silent, very
silent. We travel a lot, stayed in different hotels, ordinary hotel,
star hotel and rented banglows, but we never experianced this STRANGE
silence. first we looked at each other and ignored it, and 1 hour or
so, we sat together talking, but we both were not comfortable,
something was wrong, both of us were restless. We thought tht was
enough for us, we called the receiption and asked them to change our
room, even they without askin us a single question changed our room to
a DUPLEX room on the 1st floor of the hotel, and tht room was good, it
was comfortable and very very beautiful.<br>
I am sure there is something wrong with tht room.<br>
It is the same HOTEL RAJ KIRAN, which is listed in YOUR SITE as a HAUNTED PLACE.<br>
If possible plz let me know who else had an experiance with the same "HOTEL RAJ KIRAN".<br>

Jawless<br>
<br>
By: Sk8nFreak23@aol.com<br>
<br>
hi.&nbsp; i live in new haven connecticut. this is one of my true stories.<br>
i call it jawless.<br>
i had just moved into my new home and had always been dealing with
hauntings my whole life and i hoped that this new home would be
un-haunted. i lived with my brother sister and father. also my fathers
girlfriend and three children too. i always loved to play around in the
basement in the dark to try to scare her son (my dads girlfriend's son)
david with the help of my older brother vinny. one day we were in the
basement in the dark trying to scare him as usual. i was at the door
holding it almost closed. it was open enough just so there was a crack
of light. i held the door so he couldnt get out. when it was nice and
quiet my brother tried to sneak around davids bed which was in the
middle of the room. then out of a closet, i saw a shadowy women in a
robe with long black hair float across the room, threw the bed and to
the other side of the room where it vanished. i held the handle of the
door as tight as i could as tears ran down my face. my brother looked
at me and i had never seen him so shocked in my life. we ran upstairs
and tried to tell my father but he did not beleive us. after a year in
the house i some-what got over it and still went in the basement. once
i just happened to be going down there and i saw something so
frightening i froze. my basement has a set of 15 stairs which leads to
three doors: one goes left, the other right, and the third goes
straight. i looked into the one on the left as i was going up stairs
and saw the women again, only this time she didnt have a robe. she wore
a white night gown. she had little black beady eyes. and as i scanned
her face i saw in horror that she had now bottom jaw. i bolted up th
steps and told everyone. not even my brother beleived me. not until
yesterday did i realize that they were the same women, and that is when
my brother believed me.<br>
i hope u liked my story and i hope u add it to ur website. i would really appreciate it.<br>

The Faceless Many and other Experiences<br>
<br>
By: angelwendy85@gmail.com<br>
<br>
Hey, my name is Wendy and I'm originally from Holland. It's not really
me who had strange experiences, but mostly my mother. She always sees
and feels things. When I was at the age of 0 till 6 years old we lived
in a 2-story high appartment building. It contains the
basement/entrance floor, then a floor with a little playground (and the
appartments ofcourse) and then the second floor. We lived on the second
floor. On the basement floor (which was also the entrance and the place
where the bicycles and garbagecontainers where kept) there was always a
cold spot. Right next to the stairs. I still remember that I was always
scared there. I always ran very fast on and off the stairs because I
always had the feeling I was chased. There was also a cold spot next to
our bathroom. <br>
Luckily I never experienced more things than the feeling of being
chased, but my mother had more quite bad experiences. One time she woke
up from something. Suddenly she saw a man without a face and with a
black coat and hat walking to her, coming from the kitchen (the bedroom
faced the kitchen more or less). He walked right through her and
dissapeared through the wall ! The strangest thing was that my father
didn't woke up or anything. <br>
Also she saw I think was a vortex in the kitchen once. She said it
looked like an eye from a hurricane. My mother saw her whole life
happening in that thing (hope i explain it understandable enough..). <br>
It not only affected my mother and father but also their German
Shepard. First there was nothing wrong with him. But on the one from
another day he didnt wanted to go on the stairs anymore. It came so far
that my parents had to bring him away. They brought him to the police
where he became a police dog. <br>
When I was 6 years old my brother was born. And soon after that we moved out. <br>
In the new house there was nothing much as far as i know, only my
mother couldn't walk there in the beginning. She had the feeling that
she was paralyzed or something. My father solved that by putting
something under the floor. I don't know what it was. After that
everything was normal. <br>
Now I am 20 and I live in Spain with my brother and parents. Here are
only some things happened. With my mother again. Sometimes when she is
sleeping she has the feeling that she is chased out of her bedroom. The
whole bed feels then as it is electrified. The whole wall across her is
then covered with colors also. And strangely enough my father never
notices much..only sometimes that he feels the "electricity" going
through the bed. For the rest there we all saw some orbs occasionally
flying in and out..and some bottles of cola are moving from the left to
the right of the table :-) Also we smell flowers and cigaresmoke, but
we all know THAT is just my grandfather. <br>
This was my story..I hope people find it usefull :-)<br>

A VERY UNUSUAL HUNT<br>
<br>
<br>
By: Shylock1041@cs.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
THIS IS A STORY THAT WAS TOLD TO ME BY MY FATHER JUST BEFORE HE PASSED
AWAY AND I THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE INTERESTING ENOUGH TO PUT ON
SHADOWLANDS.<br>
MY FATHER WAS FROM TENNESSEE ORIGINALLY AND THIS WAS TOLD TO HIM BY A
FRIEND OF HIS. THIS FELLOW LIKED TO HUNT BEARS WITH DOGS AND HE HAD A
PACK OF JUST ABOUT THE BEST IN THE STATE TO DO IT WITH, NORMALLY WHEN
YOU HUNT BEAR, YOU DRIVE THE BACK ROADS WITH THE PACK IN THE BACK OF
THE PICKUP TILL YOU FIND WHERE A BEAR HAS RECENTLY CROSSED THE ROAD AND
WHEN YOU DO THIS, ONE OF THE HOUNDS (THE ONE WITH THE BEST NOSE) WILL
OPEN WITH A HOWL AND LET YOU KNOW IT.<br>
HE WAS DOING JUST THAT THIS ONE MORNING NEXT TO A VERY DEEP CANYON WHEN
HIS TRACKER DOG LET OUT A BELLOW. HE IMMEDIATELY STOPPED THE TRUCK
AND&nbsp; RELEASED ALL OF THE HOUNDS WHO TOOK OFF DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF
THE CANYON, BAYING VERY LOUDLY BY THIS TIME. BEING A VETERAN HUNTER WHO
WAS VERY GOOD AT FOLLOWING THE HOUNDS, HE STAYED PUT TILL HE FIGURED
OUT THE DIRECTION THAT THE BAYING WAS COMING FROM, THEN JUMPED IN THE
TRUCK AND HOT -FOOTED IT UP THE ROAD TO MAKE SURE THAT HE DIDN'T STOP
TILL HE WAS WELL IN FRONT OF THEM AND THE BEAR.<br>
HE DROVE OUT OF THE TIMBER INTO A HUGE CLEAR CUT SO HE COULD SEE THE
BEAR WHEN IT CAME OUT AND STOPPED AND WAITED, LISTENING TO THE BAYING
OF HIS HOUNDS. THIS IS WHERE THINGS STARTED TO GET A LITTLE WEIRD.<br>
HE EVENTUALLY SAW SOMETHING COME OUT OF THE TIMBER INTO THE CLEAR CUT
AT A RANGE THAT WAS TOO EXTREME TO TELL WHAT IT WAS, OTHER THAN THE
FACT THAT HE SAID LATER THAT THE THING WAS STANDING UPRIGHT ON TWO
LEGS. NOW, IT IS USUALLY VERY HARD TO PULL DOGS OFF OF A HOT TRAIL BUT
WHEN HIS DOGS CAME OUT OF THE TIMBER AND SAW HIM AND HIS TRUCK STANDING
ON THE ROAD ABOVE THEM, THEY IMMEDIATELY MADE A BEE-LINE FOR HIM. <br>
EVERY DOG IN THE PACK HAD THEIR TAILS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS AND ALL OF
THEM TRIED TO GET BETWEEN HIS LEGS AT THE SAME TIME, SCARED TO DEATH.
NOW IT IS ALMOST UNKNOWN FOR A HOUND TRAINED TO HUNT BEAR TO BE AFRAID
OF ANYTHING BUT THESE WERE WHIMPERING AND TRYING THEIR BEST TO GET AS
CLOSE TO HIM AS THEY COULD. THEY FINALLY DECIDED THAT THEY WERE GOING
TO GO HOME AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN WAIT TO BE LOADED INTO THE TRUCK, THEY
JUST ALL TOOK OFF.<br>
ALL THIS TIME, THE FELLOW HAD BEEN TRYING TO KEEP AN EYE ON THIS
CREATURE(?), EVEN THOUGH BEING DISTRACTED. THIS FELLOW TOLD MY DAD THAT
IT MOVED OFF SLOWLY UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED OVER THE NEXT HILL AND, AS
CLOSE AS HE COULD TELL, IT NEVER DID DROP DOWN TO ALL FOURS.<br>
HE THEN DECIDED THAT HE COULD NOT LEAVE THERE WITHOUT SEEING THE KIND
OF TRACKS THAT IT LEFT, SO, BEING ARMED WITH A HIGH-POWERED RIFLE, HE
STARTED THE LONG DESCENT INTO THE CANYON. WHEN HE ARRIVED AT THE
BOTTOM, WHATEVER IT WAS WAS LONG GONE BUT HE TOLD DAD THAT IT HAD
INDEED LEFT THERE WALKING ON ITS HIND LEGS BUT THE STRANGEST THING OF
ALL WAS THAT IT LEFT A CLOVEN HOOF PRINT!<br>
THIS FELLOW WASN'T PARTICULARLY RELIGIOUS BUT AFTER HE SAW WHAT
HAPPENED TO HIS HOUNDS, HE SWORE TILL HIS DYING DAY THAT HIS DOGS ENDED
UP TRAILING THE DEVIL AND HE WOULDN'T BELIEVE ANYTHING ELSE. THE DOGS
WERE ALL AT HOME WHEN HE GOT THERE AND WERE ALL TRYING TO GET IN THEIR
PENS.<br>
<br>

Ghosts in my Old House<br>
<br>
By: hydro3312002@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I grew up in an old house in Portersville, PA. It was a very old house
and had been torn down from a place in the woods about a mile away and
completely rebuilt there about 100 years ago. (time could be off
could've been longer) We moved there when I was four and I could tell
you many more stories about this house than I will.<br>
&nbsp;"Our" house no longer stands, however they did rebuild a similar
looking place (video store/police station??) in the same place. <br>
Ok. There was an abandoned house right next to ours also. It was so old
and very very scary to me. These houses were about 15-20 feet apart.
One night when I was about 5 or 6 my grandparents and great-grandmother
spent the night(I'm not sure why). It was summer and still very warm
and humid so we had windows open in the house. Now everyone was in bed.
I remember waking up to a large pounding/knocking sound. one about
every five seconds...13 times...everyone in the house was woken up by
this. We all went to the kitchen. We're all pretty sure we saw lights
in the house. My dad went outside and yelled for whoever it was to get
out of there (as no one lived in the house for probably the past 50-60
years...If you'd like a description let me know...it looked like
whoever lived there just packed up and moved and no one ever moved into
it again Anyways, it stopped eventually we all went back to sleep. The
next day, my dad, mom, aunts &amp; pap pap went over there...no foot
prints at all, it looked like it hadn't be entered in years everything
was covered in dust.....and 12 steps with a hole at the bottom of the
stairs that went into the cellar below. I could never bring myself to
go into that house. I was always terrified of it. Thankfully it was
torn down when I was about 12-13. It was like a black cloud had been
lifted.<br>
Now on to our house. I always felt scared to be alone in our house as did my sisters. <br>
I suffered from "paralizing dreams" the entire time I lived there which
about 21 years. The cellar was exceptionally scary. There was a fruit
cellar type room which I rarely ever went into as well as a pump room
where the water well was. I would have vivid nightmares going down to
the cellar and someone coming out of one of those rooms to "get" me. It
got to the point that I wouldn't go down there alone. When I was about
15/16 my cousin was over we were talking about ghosts in my bedroom
when suddenly part of the ceiling (plaster and latheboard) fell in and
knocked the light off the wall and left us in darkness. :D We ran. <br>
We've all heard footsteps and other unexpainable noises in the house. Things would just disappear never to be seen again. <br>
One night my sister heard a noise in the room between our bedrooms. It
was unoccupied at the time had a bunch of boxes and stuff in it. Then
she said I walked out of my room and opened the door to the room and
said, "Oh, it's just you. You scared me), I shut the door and went back
to bed. She said she just laid there the rest of the night and never
heard anything else. I don't remember doing that at all. I don't think
I sleep walk although I do talk quite a bit in my sleep so I'm told.<br>
I've had a ghost get into bed with me on several occasions. This never
happened to anyone else in our house. The scariest time was when my
ex-husband and I first got married. We lived at my parents house while
they were renevating an old german families farmhouse they were to move
into(yep more stories there some) and we slept downstairs in one of the
rooms. My ex was upstairs getting ready for bed. I was laying on the
pull out sofa-bed and dozing off. I felt my ex, I thought, getting into
bed with me and snuggling up to me. I turned to say something and no
one was there. my ex-husband started coming down the stairs just then.
I freaked out. <br>
One evening we had about 4 or 5 friends over to play cards. Suddenly
there was a huge crash from upstairs like a big dresser falling over
(by the way, everyone was downstairs at the time). My dog freaked out
and ran upstairs and was barking ferociously. My friends and I ran
upstairs. Nothing was out of place and the dog was just barking into
thin air.<br>
Also my daughter and niece and nephew were playing one day and we heard
them talking...Like they were talking to someone. We went into the room
they were playing in and there was only them. We asked what they were
doing and they all said they were playing with James. He was an old man
dressed in black with a star necklace on.&nbsp; When asked where James
was they just said he's gone now. None of us knew anyone by the name of
James. Just about everyone who's been in that house believes it to be
haunted. <br>
We had a lot of fun growing up there also, it really wasn't all so scary. <br>

Ghosts.....<br>
<br>
By: LGarner@att.net]<br>
<br>
<br>
I went into the Old Town area that was just off the freeway
(coincidence?). Among the buildings I visited was the Whaley House,
which was built in 1857 and, for a time, was used as the County
Courthouse. It was getting to be mid-afternoon when I set up my camera
tripod in the room that was formerly their court-room. I was taking
some readings with my light meter when I had the feeling that someone
was looking over my shoulder; I turned around but there was no one
there. I returned to my meter read-ings and was transferring the
settings to my Leica 35mm camera on the tripod. Again, the feeling that
there was someone watching my every move; no one was there. I took a
few exposures, picked up the tripod and moved to the nearby kitchen
area. <br>
Again I felt as if I was being watched, but I was alone. I took the
tripod and went upstairs to photograph the upper bedroom areas, where
everything was normal. It was about 5PM and was just beginning to get
dark when I packed up my photo equipment and was preparing to leave. As
I passed the building custodian at a table near the door I heard
someone walking in the upstairs hallway. It was the sound of heavy
boots moving from one end of the hallway to the other. Looking up
toward the ceiling I turned to the lady at the entrance desk and said,
&#8220;I thought I was the last one here&#8221;. &#8220;You are&#8221;, she said. Although I
was obviously a bit stunned by her response, I put down my equipment on
the floor near the desk and walked over to the stairs and went up. I
looked in every room; they were empty. I knew that the one stairway was
the only way to get to or to come from the second floor. I went back
downstairs and picked up my equipment; I was the last one there! I have
never been able to explain what happened there; I know what I felt and
what I plainly heard. I'm a scientist and I don't like things that I
can't explain.<br>

The Spirit in Mosque Road<br>
<br>
By: Vinay_Mangalore@Dell.com<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
My Name is Vinay. I work for Dell international, Located in Bangalore
India. This happened around four years ago. My friend Nash's mother had
passed away that morning. After giving a decent burial for his mother
Nash and I went to his aunty's house. He was told to stay back. But he
was hesitant about it. He hated his relatives. He decided to stay with
me. It was too late for us to leave. It was around 11.30PM. We could
not get any public transport. So we decided to walk to my room. The
distance was approximately ten kilometers. We had to pass thru a
burrial. All though I felt that I would see something that night. It
never happened near the burial. We were approximately three kilometers
from my room. We reached the enterance of a road called mosque road. I
saw an old man coming towards us. Although he was walking, it seemed to
be unnatural(rather pretending to walk, he was literally floating). He
was almost one hundred meters away from us. But with in a span of a
second he was in front of us. He asked for beedi (something like
cigarette). His eye looked artificial, I mean there was no sign of life
in his eyes. I told my friend to offer a Cigarette<br>
To this gentleman (also made my friend aware that this is not a human
being) My friend handed a cigarette to this person. Then this person
thanked us. Before leaving he asked us the way to the bowring hospital.
I gave him the necessary instruction. He left. We had hardly taken two
steps. Both of us turned back and lo no one was there.<br>

VA Haunting Continued<br>
<br>
By: camelotsmaiden@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I want to thank you for posting my paranormal experience (page 383 VA
Haunting) and, as promised, I also wanted to share another experience
from that same house that is 100% true.&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the
events surrounding the sighting of the second ghost that haunted our
house.&nbsp; If you remember my previous posting, we lived in a
two-story farmhouse in Lancaster, VA.&nbsp; I don't know exactly when
the girl made her first appearance since I was not the first to meet
her.&nbsp; She seemed to favor my Mom.&nbsp; For this story, I'll need
to give a bit of the house layout.&nbsp; Basically, it was four large
rooms and an extra wide hallway stacked on top of each other.&nbsp;
Living room, dining room, den and kitchen downstairs and 4 bedrooms
upstairs and a bathroom between them.&nbsp; When you walked up the
stairs, directly in front of you was the bathroom, directly to your
right my parents room, turn left about 6 steps and you were at me and
my sisters room, turn left again go about 6 steps to my younger sisters
room, go about 6 more steps turn left and you would be at the attic
door and the fourth bedroom.&nbsp; Think U shape.&nbsp; Note that I
said their were 4 bedrooms but me and my sister shared a bedroom,
that's because none of us girls would dare take that back bedroom next
to the attic door.&nbsp; It gave us the creeps.&nbsp; Well, this is
where I believe the girl ghost lived and here's why.&nbsp; One night,
early in the morning (or really late at night depending) my Mom came
into our room and turned on our light and wanted to know who was
calling her.&nbsp; Of course me and my sister were groggy and half out
of it and told her it wasn't us.&nbsp; She said okay and turned off the
light and left.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know how long it was because I had
fallen back to sleep but my Mom came back into our room and flipped the
light on again.&nbsp; She ask us again "Are you sure no one is calling
me?".&nbsp; Again we reassured her that it was not us and asked did she
check with our younger sister.&nbsp; She said yes.&nbsp; The main thing
I remember about that night besides the light in my eyes was how
perplexed my mother looked.&nbsp; Like she was total baffled.&nbsp; She
told us good night and turned back off our light.&nbsp; The next
morning I asked my mom what that was all about and she said someone was
calling "mommy, mommy" all night long and she said she could have sworn
it was coming from the empty room but she knew no one was in
there.&nbsp; Skip forward a year or so, My mom told us (many years
later so as not to scare us) that one night she was lying in bed asleep
when, what she thought was one of us girls, came in the room and
started shaking her and saying "Mommy, wake up, wake up mommy"&nbsp; My
mom said it was strange but she couldn't seem to pry her eyes open so
she told 'us' to hold on a second while she opened her eyes but the
shaking of the arm continued.&nbsp; Finally she was able to get her
eyes open and their stood a young girl and clearly not one of
hers.&nbsp; They looked at each other for a moment and the girl said
"Oh, you're not my mommy" and she walked down the hallway and
disappeared.<br>
Now remember, my Mom didn't tell us kids about this incident until we
were adults and had moved out so that in no way influence my experience
with the girl.&nbsp; I was 16 at the time and my older sister had moved
out, leaving me sleeping alone in our room.&nbsp; For the first 3
months, I slept in my younger sisters room down the hall.&nbsp; I was
just too scared (embarrassing at 16 but true) to sleep in there
alone.&nbsp; Finally one night I was going to bite the bullet and sleep
in my own bed.&nbsp; I kept telling myself I was being ridicules and to
grow up.&nbsp; I went to bed at my usual time and fell asleep almost
immediately.&nbsp; I woke up about 12:30am feeling quite proud of
myself for having conquered my fear.&nbsp; I smiled to myself then
turned on my side to go back to sleep however when I looked out my
door, which put my view right into my parents room, there was a young
girl coming out of their room.&nbsp; She looked about my age with long
hair (brown I think) and wearing a calf length white night shirt and
she was headed straight toward me.&nbsp; I froze.&nbsp; I don't even
think I breathed.&nbsp; I watched her move toward me then right before
she would have walked into my room she turn and went down the hall
toward my sisters room.&nbsp;&nbsp; I laid there for a few minutes not
believing what I just saw and trying to rationalize it.&nbsp; I kept
thinking, it could have been my sister but my sister had very short
hair.&nbsp; Needing to know, I got out of bed and peeped around the
corner toward my sisters room.&nbsp; There was nothing in the hallway
so drummed up the nerve to walk down the hall and peak into my sisters
room.&nbsp; I called out softly so as not to wake her if she was asleep
but she answered.&nbsp; Since she was awake I asked her did she just
come out of our parents room and she said 'No, why?'&nbsp; I didn't
want to scare her so at first I didn't answer, I just asked could I
sleep in her room.&nbsp; She asked again why and finally I told her
what I had just witnessed and then she told me that she hadn't been
able to sleep because she had been hearing things all night.&nbsp;
Needless-to-say, it was several more months before I again drummed up
the courage to sleep alone but I eventually did for a few months and
then I moved out.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know this has been long but I hope it
helps someone else who may be experiencing the same thing.<br>

A Creepy, but True Recollection!<br>
<br>
By: BigCarsonG@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Around 1978 I rented a tiny apartment in the old town of Port Costa,
CA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A much larger apartment was soon to be available
in an adjacent building in this town, and it had a superior view of
scenery.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The "problem" started when the apartments
current resident was arrested for jumping on a paper delivery boy who
had come to his door.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rumor was that this
resident was gay, and said and/or did something illegal to this
boy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police were called by the boy's
parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charges were filed and this resident had to
go to court.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All this came to light in newspaper
articles.&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe he eventually served jail time for this
incident. <br>
My encounter with this resident came shortly after this
incident.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He apparently did not want to move from
this apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I came to his door twice, telling him
I was getting into trouble waiting for him to move, since I needed a
definet move-out date for my old apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third
time I came to his door, he leered at me and said in a threatening
tone, "You won't like it here".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Needles to say,
it gave me goosebumps, but I didn't dwell on it, thinking it was the
remark of a troubled guy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked him what he meant
by that, and he said, "You'll find out".&nbsp; It was a warning I
should have heeded.<br>
This resident was finally forced by the landlord to
leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I first entered this apartment, I sensed
an ominous feeling I couldn't put my finger on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I
moved things in, my bed came.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a one room
arrangement, with an open loft at the back end creating a partial top
floor room.&nbsp;&nbsp; A railing separated it from the lower, main
room.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Being an aspiring artist, I made this top floor loft into my art
studio, and arranged my bed on the lower floor towards the far end of
the apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first night there was quite eerie,
to say the least!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I started noticing dark shadowy
"things" moving just out of my periferal vision, in the corners of the
room!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And when I'd glance up to the dark, quiet loft,
through the railing....my fear began to rise.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seemed to
me I saw things move in the shadows up there!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again,
I passed this all off to paranoia from his threats, and sleeping in a
new place I was unfamiliar with.<br>
After a few days of this, I had a neighbor come over to
visit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of the blue, he said "This place seems to
kind of drain my energy".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yikes....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You could've pushed me over with a
feather.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I blurted out my own concerns and what
I had been experiencing there, and knew at that moment I was not
imagining things!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each successive night, as
dusk approached and darkness settled in, I could feel this "presence"
moving closer and closer to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although I tried hard
to dismiss this all as rubbish.....these dark, shadowy things kept
moving around in the dark corners of my apartment!<br>
Finally, in desperation, and feeling I couldn't endure another night of
this, I rummadged through my boxes of unpacked stuff, and brought out a
cross that had been given to me upon leaving some much earlier bible
study class I attended as a child.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in fact, I was
curious to see if this might have some affect on these spooky, nightly
encounters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not being an active "church goer" for
many years, I had my doubts.<br>
To my amazement, these scary nightly encounters slowly started to
diminish!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They didn't stop immediately, but after
about three days (nights), I wasn't seeing these shadowy things in the
corners of my apartment any longer or feeling the dread that came with
the night.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And by the fourth night, all seemed at
peace!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phew......&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
tell you this not as an endorsement for religion, but simply as the
truth to what I had encountered.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To this day, I
have no resonable explanation for all this, but it ranks at the top of
"spooky encounters" for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't had anything
even come close to this in the ensueing years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thank
goodness!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Postscript:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I later discovered this previous tenant
was the co-owner of a well-known metaphysical bookstore in San
Francisco.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My assumption is that he used one of his
store's books to conjure up some sort of demon (s) to curse this
apartment he was forced to leave under such unhappy conditions.&nbsp; <br>
