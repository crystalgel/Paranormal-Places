Alaskan Haunting<br>
<br>
By: roc688@mts.net<br>
<br>
This house was once a floating barge for visiting fishermen to buy the
company of women.&nbsp; The "house" was landed and turned into a
residential home for families to come.&nbsp; The house has four to five
bedrooms from the original design along with a living room and kitchen
area.&nbsp; The attic holds two bedrooms connected by an A-frame
hallway.&nbsp; You can only walk down the hallway if you stand exactly
in the center.&nbsp; Only one girl has witnessed sightings in this
house, but on several occasions.&nbsp; Even after the House was
remodeled it kept a very un-homely presence.&nbsp; The young girl's
room was rudamentary and functional without any homely touches.&nbsp;
After finding hidden holes in the wall behind her bed the sightings
began.&nbsp; In the wall was found: handcuffs, faux jewelry, a handheld
mirror, and rotting lipstick.&nbsp; All these things were kept secret
and stored back in the wall.&nbsp; Through the young girl's floor a
square hole cut-out made for ventilation.&nbsp; It was big enough for a
small child to fit through.&nbsp; These are the accounts of the house
haunting this one girl.&nbsp; In the night when there was no light she
witnessed shadows of unearthly beings on the walls of her room, She
could look down into the living room through the hole and watch the
t.v. turn on and off and flip through channels of "t.v. snow"although
there was no remote control, After moving into the bedroom downstairs
she witnessed the oven turning a firy orange color as if it were
overheated although it was not on.&nbsp; Continuously plagued by
nightmares&nbsp; she developed insomnia and watched the t.v.
incessently.&nbsp; Day to day she would find her favorite stuffed
rabbit crammed behind the t.v.&nbsp; She later developed at the age of
9 lucid dreams where she would sleep walk out into the bay and return,
waking up in the morning with rocks and shells in her feet.&nbsp; The
only other sign of haunting outside of the young girl was the constant
flow of anger that seemed to reside inside the walls itself.&nbsp; The
garage which was built years after the house was landed has been
investigated for similar hauntings.<br>

This is a personal experience in a house where the owner does not believe in things such as any thing paranormal of any kind. <br>
I live in North Carolina and was visiting there for a week. While I was
in his house in fact I was in his room about to go to sleep. <br>
The bath room door has a full length mirror on it. The door was shut
all the way and I know the latch was closed so there was no way that a
breeze or any thing except a person could have opened this door. While
I was laying there I happened to glance int the mirror and at the point
in time as I looked into it. The door had became a jar and swung open.
The door also appeared to have hit something and abrubltly stopped.
There was nothing behind the door at all for it to stop like that. The
way it stopped it was like someone was standing behind the door.<br>

Ghost Story<br>
<br>
By: tupac892005@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
Hey, I just wanted to share this story about my family and the house
that we live in.&nbsp; The house was built in the eighteen hundreds,
here in Provo, UT.&nbsp; Ever since we moved in back in 1999 my whole
family has experienced the paranormal.&nbsp; We've heard babies crying,
seen the ghosts of former residents, including women and
children.&nbsp; I myself have had my bed shake uncontrollably at
night.&nbsp; The doors of closets look like someone is trying to break
out from the inside, even when I've been alone so it couldn't have been
any of my brothers. We've even had family members experience and see
stuff too.&nbsp; <br>
One encounter though scared me more than anything though, so much that I couldn't sleep for days.<br>
Well it was late one night and I got home at about 1 in the morning
from hanging out with my girlfriend.&nbsp; I went into my room and my
younger brother who is sixteen was on his computer; we share a
room.&nbsp; Well after talking for a little bit I fell asleep and he
stayed on for another hour.&nbsp; He said he got his Zune (mp3 player)
and went to his bed when he was done.&nbsp; He said he was listening to
music and looked over at me from across the room and saw hooded figures
floating around the room.&nbsp; Total he said there were 7.&nbsp; He
said he looked away and covered himself up cause he was scared but for
some reason peeked back to see if they were gone.&nbsp; He said they
weren't and that one was actually making its way toward him.&nbsp; Next
thing he knew he saw a dark hand coming towards his face until it
actually graced his face and then it quickly disappeared! The "Thing"
returned back and walked around until my brother got up and turned the
light on from our bathroom.&nbsp; It was weird because my brother said
he could see them clearly cause they were darker than the night! After
he told me this I couldn't sleep for days. He has been the one in my
family that has seen and heard more than anyone.&nbsp; Hes one of the
most fearless people I know which is why I think they appear to him
more often.&nbsp; If anyone has ever experienced anything like this I
would like to hear your story.<br>

Odd Experiences<br>
<br>
By: por-que-22@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
All of this is true. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to email me.<br>
When I was 3, my grandmother died of cancer. My family said that she
loved me so much. I don't remember her at all. When I was five or six,
I had a dream that I was at the hospital, which was also at the
cemetery for some reason, to visit my dying grandmother. I awoke from
this dream to hear my name be called. When I left my room, I went down
the hall and looked down the stairs to see an old woman looking up at
me. It freaked me out, so I ran back to my bed and hid under the
covers. That incident never happened again. Later, when I saw a picture
of her and asked who that was, my mother told me it was my grandmother.
A few times later in my childhood, in the middle of the night, I would
wake to find, basically, people staring at me. A man would be in the
middle of the room looking at me, and one time, there was a woman kind
of hiding behind my toybox. I thought it was my mom, so I told her to
stop. When she didn't respond, or move, I freaked out and hid under my
covers. It took about an hour before she disappeared. Then it all
stopped for a while and nothing happened. I digress.<br>
In middle school, I met a friend whom, after awhile, started telling me
that he had a spirit in his house that would not leave him alone. When
he told his dad about the spirit, his dad told him to grow up. He said
it looked like an outline with a white "hollow glow" of&nbsp; a man.
One day he decided to confront "him" with his star wars plastic light
saber. For some reason the figure always stood outside his room, so one
night he took the light saber and swung it at the figure. It did
nothing, but the light saber started turning on and off and flickering.
I think confrontations after that became limited.<br>
I also met another friend in middle school who was like me at the time:
a weird, quiet outcast type kid. One summer, he went to Michigan were
his family was and when he came back he started talking about Wicka, or
Wicken. Now, I know a lot of people out there decommission Wicka from
ever being a real religion, but let me say the things I saw, heard and
felt in my 3 years of dealting into this religion have shown me things
I never thought possible of this world. I believe this to be the most
"real" religion any human has ever created or discovered.&nbsp; This
friend of mine showed me things like how to find your inner demon(and
yes, we ALL have one), how to open parts of your mind to the "other
side", channel energy, and various other things. Well, at one point, my
friend told me that he was starting to see an old man standing at the
front of the neighborhood staring at him when he looked outside his
window anytime of day.(His house was across from the entrance of the
neighborhood.) We had the idea we would try to contact him using
various methods. I'm sure you've read on this site to not do this
unless you are trained. Well, they're not lying. We opened a very
strong spirit that we did not know how to handle. He told me applainces
in his house would turn on and off, and his little sister started
having nightmares of this man. I, on the other hand, got the better
half. I would hear whispering in the house all the time, see blue
streaks of light at night, and I also had a Galileo thermometer(for
those of you not familiar, it's a tall,thin sealed glass vail that
contains different liquids in smaller little vails that raise and lower
with the temperature) that would rise and fall constantly at times. I
thought maybe it was all in my head, so I asked my other friend who was
sensitive to come over for the night. That night, the spirit kept
talking to him in his sleep, and I found out that he was basically
camped out in front of the stairs, always watching. In his dream, he
told me the spirit place a shotgun to his head and shot a "cube of
information" into him. He then lifted him up to the attic and pointed
to the other side and told him what is there will not hurt either of
you, but everyone else. I personally did not know what he was talking
about and never did figure it out. He told me when the spirit shot him,
he suddenly had quick clips of images of a house and a forest behind
it, and various other images of no relation. We also tried getting an
evp, but all that kept coming up was heavy, deep breathing and a faint
"sorry" in the backround. So, me and the weird friend decided it was
time to put this spirit to rest. We used a ritual to put him back into
the ground, if you will. It worked, but before it was over, he revealed
himself to me. He was an old man in overalls, but he had bullet shots
all in him for some reason. Nothing of the spiritual kind has happened
to me since. <br>
We later found out that the old man used to own the property that is
now the neighborhood my parents live in. I saw a picture of his house.
It was very time worn and there was nothing but forest behind it. The
forest, for some reason, looked pitch black in the photo, even though
it was taken during broad daylight. He disappeared one day and no one
heard from him after that. My friend and I believed that where my house
was and his death may have had some connection. <br>
Do not close your mind to events that have happened to you. There is
far more to this world than what's on the surface. Most people just
choose not to believe what they see.<br>

Rise and Shine<br>
<br>
<br>

I have lived in Hendersonville, North Carolina all of my life, and in
the fifteen years I have lived, I have had numerous experiences. One of
my most terrifying times was when i was around ten years old. My dad
and stepmother moved into the house when i was five. Nothing was really
happening until i was about nine. I told my mom (who is a medium), and
she told me that there was a young girl by the name of Elizabeth in the
house. I told my dad and stepmom, but they didn't really believe me.
Well, one night, i was asleep in my bed. My sister and I shared a
bunkbed, and I had the top bunk. I was under a wool blanket, and I was
getting hot. I woke up, to see a face looking at me. I was so scared,
and i hid under the blanket for about ten minutes. I finally got up
enough courage to go to my parents room to tell my dad. I slipped
between the wall and railing of my bunkbed, because i didn't want to go
down the ladder where i saw the little girl. I ran to my dad's room and
woke him up, saying, "Daddy, there is a ghost in my room." He woke up
and walked me to my room and turned on the light. "There is nothing in
here, now go to bed." I decided to sleep with my sister in the bottom
bunk after that. Not much happened after the incident. My TV would turn
on and off at times, and things would go missing, but I never saw her
again. My dad and stepmom got divorced, but she stayed in the house
with my other sister, so i havn't&nbsp; been over there for a while,
and when i do go over there, usually nothing happens. So i don't know
if Elizabeth has moved on or not.<br>

DeKalb, Illinois Experience<br>
<br>
By: jbryan@LSIJAX.COM<br>
<br>
We lived in a house built on the crest of a hill in DeKalb, IL on Ridge
Road.&nbsp; Just after moving in my wife and I both experienced several
sightings of a little girl, in the house, wearing what we assumed was a
costume dress of some sort.&nbsp; The dress was very Victorian - lacy,
with layers and so long it came down to her feet.&nbsp; She was seen
standing just inside the front door (which was open when we saw her but
was closed when we moved forward and she disappeared), walking up or
down our stairs, and playing on the floors in several of the main
sitting rooms of the house.&nbsp; When we would vacuum the Living Room
floor, a few minutes later one of us would walk by and see little foot
prints across the carpet.&nbsp; On two occasions, she spoke to
us.&nbsp; Her voice was not associated with seeing her the first time,
and she said something that didn't make any sense at first, but when I
asked what her name was, we both clearly heard the name
"Abigail".&nbsp; When we asked what she wanted, she said that we were
in her house - not hostile, just a quiet statement.&nbsp; The next time
we actually saw her, too.&nbsp; She was sitting on the stairs when we
came in from outside.&nbsp; She smiled at us and we smiled back and
said hello.&nbsp; She then faded out, still smiling.&nbsp; After that,
every now and then, we would notice furniture that had moved, more
footprints of a little girl in our carpets, and one wall in an upstairs
bedroom where a certain picture would fall down no matter how we tried
to fasten it to the wall.&nbsp; We never had any problems with Abigail,
and she never seemed to wish us trouble, so we all just kind of lived
together.<br>

Strange Things<br>
<br>
By: paulawilkerson1@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
There is a house on u highway in Oregon county Missouri, my husband and
I lived there a very short time as newly weds. It was told to us that
the house was haunted , but we didn't believe it, until we moved in.
While in the house alone, my husband was mowing outside,I was taking a
nap and when I awoke our wedding flowers were all being knocked down
the staircase like someone was walking through them. When I got up wind
blow down the stairs and the front and back doors of the house slammed
shut and locked. My husband had an overwhelming feeling that something
was wrong with me and broke down the back door. All of this time the
wind was blowing up and down the stairs( there were no windows open)
immediately when my husband entered the wind stopped and everything was
still. Many strange things happened in that house, such as a radio in
the kitchen would come on by itself to a station I couldn't pick up
that happened at different hours of the day and night. The wind chimes
in the kitchen would blow when the house was closed up.&nbsp; My nephew
was about 6 years old at this time and was visiting me , I sent him out
to play for awhile, later when he came back he wanted to know if he
could go back out and play with the little girl that glowed all white.
When questioned about this he said she had walked around the corner of
the house in a long flowing white dress that seemed to glow, he played
with her for awhile and then she disappeared , he assumed she went
home. On the night we decided to move all hell broke lose, we had just
came home from our honeymoon and had our car to break down in the drive
so we could not leave we had no phone or neighbors close by. When we
got ready for bed we turned off the lights and shut the bedroom
door.&nbsp; As we laid there we heard someone walking upstairs, my
husband got up and opened the door and it stopped but the wind blew
down the stairs and footsteps were heard running up and down the
stairs. We decided to keep the door shut, all night the noises
continued , the door handle rattled and we could see it turning! We
were terrified! We had never used the upstairs because every time we
went up there a horrible smell would fill the room. At day light
everything was calm again , my husband walked to our nearest neighbors
to use the phone and we moved that day. As we were leaving my husband
went upstairs to see if we had left anything and a small bed we had
slid across the floor towards him, that bed is still there I guess we
left! Another strange thing we saw a dog in our yard several times with
red eyes, we could never catch him, but he was always under our house.<br>

The Presence in My Room and the Ghost at School<br>
<br>
By: darth-vader@talktalk.net<br>
<br>
<br>
Hi, i read ghost stories every day and i've had a few experiences.<br>
The first one was when i was in year 3 (because i live in England they
have year 1,2,3 and so on) i was rushing to the toilet and when i got
there i did my buisness and went to leave but i couldn't move, and it
got really cold in there all of a sudden, suddenly a white sort of orb
went from one end of the toilet to the other, i heard the door open and
then close and the second door open and close, but the strange thing
was is that whatever type of shoe you had it would make footstep sounds
but i didn't hear any, shocked i ran out to see the person or spirit
but there was none and this was a straight corridor about 50m's long
and no-one could of ran that fast, so i asked a teacher&nbsp; about it
and he said that the toilets were hit by a bomb in the second world war
and a child was killed.<br>
The second experience happens all the time i turn off my TV and it
turns its-self back on, i've asked my dad about it and he says that
theres nothing wrong with it, the freakiest thing is once my dad was
sorting out the electrics and the power was turned off yet my TV would
be going on and off all day, but whenever i am at the top of my stairs
i get this feeling of being watched from my right in my little brothers
room.<br>
One of my most scary experiences is when i had the smallest room in the house when i was about 7 <br>
(i am 12 now) and i always had my bed facing the way so that i could
see out of the room, I saw&nbsp; a glowing light go across the landing,
i thought it was my little brother messing around but he was asleep i
could hear his loud snoring, i gathered up the courage to go and look
and see what was out there, when i got there i saw an old man in his
(well i would say) about 50 - 60 and dressed in old clothes and hat.<br>
Thank You for letting me vent my ghostly experiences for the first time.<br>

A Lifetime of Experiences<br>
<br>
By: CGroner1@cfl.rr.com<br>
<br>
First I would like to say that I have enjoyed your site and it has
helped me tremendously. I don't know why, at 32, I feel like I need to
feel validated, but I do. It feels good to know I am not alone and I am
NOT crazy. My earliest memory of a ghost or spirit is at the age of
four. I was lying in my bed trying to go to sleep. Suddenly my room
felt extremely cold then I saw a full body aparition of a woman come
out of my closet and sit on the end of my bed. She was humming to
herself and she looked very pleasant. I don't know if I moved or
something, but it got her attention. She turned and looked straight at
me, smiled, reached out and touched my foot (under the blanket), and
then began to sing to me. I remember not feeling frightened. Somehow I
just knew she meant me no harm. As I drifted off to sleep, I felt a
cold "touch" on my cheek and forehead then she was gone. She continued
to visit me regularly throughout my childhood. I remember having a
sleep over when I was eleven years old. I was sound asleep, then
suddenly one of my friends woke me up shaking all over. When I looked
up, this woman was sitting next to my friend stroking her hair and
humming. As I got a little older she didn't visit me as often, then she
stopped. I am married now with two daughters. She has been visiting
them since they were very small... still doing the same things. That is
just one of the countless encounter I have had. This was something we
DID NOT discuss in our family growing up. In fact, the one time I tried
to talk to my mom about my experiences, she told me if I ever spoke of
it again, she would have me locked up. This has always been a way of
life for me. For a long time I thought like everyone else that ghosts
only haunted places, but I have learned that that is not always the
case. For some reason, they seem to be drawn to me. There are times
when activity is stronger than others. I was just talking to my husband
last night about it. Even If I do nothing...ignore it and disengage
myself from it, they are still with me everywhere I go. There are
certain oddities that are synonymous with me that my friends and family
have gotten use to whenever I am around. These things don't happen all
of the time, mind you, but enough for it to be a major part of who I
am. Here is a list of theses oddities, in no particular order:
Electrical items going haywire, never being able to keep charged
batteries (even rechargable and brand new), cold spots, low talking and
whispering, objects moving spontaneously (one of them threw a pencil at
my friend from upstairs), objects disappearing or being moved to
strange locations, perfectly good lightbulbs with perfectly working
wiring busting all of the time (my lightbulb bill is rediculous),
lights coming on and turning off on their own, radios always having
static, bizarre dreams and "visions"...the list goes on and on.&nbsp;
At times it hasn't been that great, sometimes lonely and even
terrifying, but mostly it has been a wonderful experience. I would love
to share more of my encounters with you and with the Shadowland
community. I must close for now, but you will be hearing from me soon.
Keep up the good work!<br>

Georgia Sites<br>

<br>
I lived on second floor Sanford Hall at Georgia College &amp; State
University for two years, shortly before the university closed off the
third floor of the dorm.&nbsp; I spent the night in some of the rooms
up there and it was definitely haunted:&nbsp; doors opened and closed
by themselves, temperatures shifted drastically, many saw a cat we
never could catch, some evenings perfume was strong in a front room,
and a girl who lived in the room where the suicide supposedly lived
tried to jump from the dormer window.&nbsp; I know--I was one of the
ones who pulled her back inside that night.&nbsp; The suitcases and
trunks in the storage room were never where we put them when we went to
get them.&nbsp; We never went to the snack area in the basement alone
either; we all felt there was something there that watched.&nbsp;
There's a coffee shop there now.<br>
Georgia Military College, the junior college across town, was some haunted spots, too.<br>
Central State Hospital is one of the most haunted places on the face of
the earth.&nbsp; For the past several years, I've researched the
hospital's history and have talked to some who worked there.<br>

It was a few years ago when my dad lived in what was an old pub in the
center of a small town in England. The building was from the 16th
century and in its present condition looks just like an ordinary home.
After 6 years living there I knew that something didnt seem right. One
day it was just me and my brother in the house, he was in his room and
I was in the main hallway, what looked like a human shadow moved up the
doorframe and dissapeared to the right up a set of stairs the door was
open a jar and was seen to be moving, after calling out and checking
the room I bought myself a camcorder, between christmas 2003-2005 me
and a friend examined every part of the house and always did filming in
the two rooms once used as bars. On a seperate occasion with another
friend we ventured to the celler which was empty, here we caught dust
moving quickly and the odd orb, the orbs were seen around the blocked
up tunnel (we dont know where it leads) also when veiwing back tapes a
distinct groan could be heard which wasn't heard during the
investigation. In Bar 2 nothing was reported (this is where i saw the
shadow coming from) Bar 1 however was where most of the orbs were
captured..........a few weeks after the investigation my dad sold up
the house, this was because his bedroom was above Bar 1 and he reported
the sounds of clicking and knocks when no-one was down there.<br>
Me and my friends belive that we heard the voice and saw the orbs of the one of the Landlords.<br>

I guess that this is a more peculiar story. Three years ago, my cat
died after a snakebite. I lived alone with just the cat so it really
hit me, at the time. Some weird things started happening afterwards.
The back door would slam shut when there was no wind (this is how the
cat used to signal that she wanted to come in - the latch at the time
wasn't working). One night, I woke up because I could feel claws
scratching at my legs - she used to do this when she wanted to go out
at night, to get my attention, annoying as it was. I felt all the time
like the cat wasn't really gone - sometimes, it was difficult to be at
home. Anyway, after a few months it all stopped.<br>
I've experienced a few 'supernatural' things in my life, like
precognition. Once, I saw a UFO for a few seconds - it was a red light
moving around outside my window. Over the past seven years, I've
occasionally been able to see white lights around me, anywhere that I
am. I see them even if my eyes are shut. It used to scare me once, but
am more used to it now. It's usually just accompanied by a feeling of
upliftment or a comforting presence. I don't talk about it much at all
with others - it's difficult. Anyway, thanks for letting me write it
here.<br>

My Little Trip<br>
<br>
By: brandonaitcheson@gmail.com<br>
<br>
This summer me(14) my little sister(11) and my dad are on a cross
country trip through the US in are RV. I live in florida and I love
going to cemetarys and night to get orb photos. So I decided it would
be cool to go to to some haunted places in diffrent states. So this
hole trip I have been using the haunted places index and so far 3
hauntings. <br>
1st we went to Wal-Mart Store on Flammang Dr- Crossroads shopping
center and stayed the night in the parking lot. We went into the store
about midnight but nothing was out of the ordenary. So we left later
that night I was watching TV with my sister and my dad was taking a
shower. When I noticed my bed was vibrating then it started to shake!
At first I thought it was just my dad jumping around trying to get
dressed. Then I turned over and saw that nothing else in the RV was
shaking! So I jumped up and it stop. I didnt tell anyone else just
incase something else happend. So the next moring about 9:00 I was
eating breackfeast and my dad asked me what I wanted last night. I
asked what he ment? He said last night after he went to bed he said
someone was shaking his mattress like I would if I wanted him to get up
but since I didnt say anything he just went back to sleep. I was so
amzed I jumped up and ran back into the store. I probly walked in
circles for 2 hours when I finaly gave up I was walking to the checkout
counter when I felt like somthing was behinde me I turned around no one
was there except a lady checking out and the check out lady. So I
turned back around and just as I did I heard somthing giggle right next
to my ear. It was so freaky! <br>
Then a few days later we were looking for some of the listed places in
Keystone South Dakota when we found the first school house of the town.
I thought it was a cool place to check out. Later my little sister went
out to play in the playground in the school yard. I could see here from
the window. She was playing on the merry-go-round when I noticed here
get off to go look and a chipmunck she saw. Then I turned away. About 1
minute later I noticed here runing up to the RV with this Crazy scared
look on here face! When see first came in she was just yelling stuff
like crazy! Things like "It keepet sping" and "She jumped off". Finaly
she was able to tell us what happend. She said she was play on the
merry-go-round when she saw a chipmunk. So she jumped off to see it
closer. She said after it ran off she noticed the merry-go-round out of
the corner of here eye. She said It was still sping and getting faster!
So she turned around and there on the merry-go-round she saw some one
stand and then jump of. I asked here tons of questions just to make
sure she wasent pulling my leg but here describtion was so good. She
said It was only about 3 seconds long but she said it had to be a girl
but It didnt have legs or a head. So I asked why she said it was a
girl? And see said because it was wearing a dress. She said it was a
white dress with blue fringe and the bottom. She said it was solid like
a normal person but without a head. Then I jumped off and and turned
into legs with white socks with fringe like the kind on the dress with
tan shoes. Then It dissepered. So later I went out and got tons of orbs
all over the grounds. Im going back tonight! <br>
Then Yesterday we went to the Bullock Hotel. We were walking around and
met this old guy who worked there and he was nice enough to give us are
own privet tore! When heard some storys and got some ghost orbs. When
we went down stairs we were looking at the old stone from the orignal
building. When I heard the some one coming down the stairs. Then I saw
the stairs start to move forward like some one was coming down! I was
so spooked I called the guy to come hear and he rushed over. When he
saw the stairs he just smield and say oh yay this happends all the
time. I turned and looked at him. I was like what do you mean this
happends all the time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Tomorrow night were going to spend
the night in the hotel!<br>

True House Haunting Stories<br>
<br>
<br>
By: Juliemom5@aol.com<br>

<br>
Hi!&nbsp; I'm new to your site, but it is so nice to read about similar
experiences by other people!!&nbsp; I was always a very practical
military wife, who didn't believe in ghosts.&nbsp; I was married to a
military man for 15 years and moved 15 times during that
marriage.&nbsp; Out of all those homes, two have been haunted,
including the house I live in currently with my five children.&nbsp;
Both of the homes are located in Kearns, Utah, where the old Camp
Kearns used to be situated.<br>
The first time I really had to believe in ghosts was in our home on
Townsend Way.&nbsp; There is a train track that goes behind the back
yard there, and I always wondered if perhaps someone who worked or was
injured or killed in association with the railroad was haunting our
home.&nbsp; When I first encountered our ghost, I was alone in the
house the first night we moved in, as my husband had taken the kids out
to get dinner.&nbsp; I was washing my face in the bathroom, and I heard
a noise that sounded like someone jumping in the back bedroom, next to
the bathroom I was in.&nbsp; Being a mom, I first thought it was just
my kids roughhousing, but then I remembered that they weren't
home.&nbsp; A split second later, while I was getting the soap out of
my eyes, I heard, and felt, someone running down the hall, then heard
them run throught the kitchen and heard the back doorknob rattle (it
was locked).&nbsp; I came out into the kitchen and looked out the
window into the back yard, in time to see the motion-activated lights
turn on.&nbsp; I opened the window and yelled out the back window for
whoever it was to, "Get out of here, or I'll call the cops!!", but I
saw no one in the yard at all.&nbsp; I thought maybe the previous
owners had just given their keys to some local teens, and they were
trying to get a thrill from being in my house and not being seen.&nbsp;
I even called the police because I was so certain someone was there who
had ran away out into my yard.&nbsp; The policeman acted as if he had
heard these kinds of things before from people who lived in my home,
and was a bit surprised when I told him we were newly moved in.&nbsp; <br>
I forgot all about the "intrusion" until I started hearing similar
noises when I was home alone.&nbsp; There would be a jumping, banging,
sort of tantrum-throwing noise in the back bedroom, which my husband
used as a study and storage area.&nbsp; Then I would hear the distinct
footsteps walking down the hallway, through the kitchen and hear the
door rattle, and sometimes at night I would then see the back yard
motion-activated lights turn on.&nbsp; I tried and tried to puzzle out
what it might be;&nbsp; my appliances, my imagination, the train that
would go by sometimes during the day or evening.&nbsp; But whenever I'd
just convinced myself it was all in my head, I would hear it again, and
know that it was definitely not those things!&nbsp; <br>
One evening, I had a friend over who is more in tune with the
supernatural, and who had lived in a haunted house before.&nbsp; I
didn't know this.&nbsp; We were expecting our husbands to come home
from the store with dinner, and we were downstairs watching a video
with our children.&nbsp; All of us heard the banging, the steps and the
doorknob.&nbsp; It sounded just like our husbands had come home and
were walking around in the kitchen.&nbsp; We wanted to watch the end of
our movie, so we did, and then we went upstairs, expecting to see
dinner the table, and our husbands there.&nbsp; But the lights were all
off and no one had come home.&nbsp; When the men arrived, we asked them
if they had come home and then left, and when they said no, we were
spooked.&nbsp; All the kids, my friend and I had all heard it.&nbsp; My
friend calmly said, "Oh, you've got a poltergeist."&nbsp; I laughed at
that, until she explained things to me about the ghost she'd had in her
house when she was growing up.&nbsp; I began to allow myself to think
maybe this was true for me also.&nbsp; My husband said he didn't
believe it either, but one time on Halloween night we were alone, and
deciding on a pizza, and Ididn't want to stay alone in the house, so I
said I'd go and get it.&nbsp; To my surprise, my husband said he was
creeped out and he didn't want to stay alone in the house either!!<br>
We had the hardest time getting babysitters who would return!&nbsp;
Every one we ever had, including my sister-in-law who didn't believe in
ghosts (before!) got scared and told us that they had heard someone
walking upstairs in the house.&nbsp; If our kids told them it was only
our ghost, they were even more scared.<br>
I definitely believe in ghosts now.&nbsp; I have always believed in
spirits, but I now know they do interact with us more than we
think.&nbsp; Once I believed in our house ghost, I really wasn't scared
of it.&nbsp; I don't believe spirits can have any power over mortals
because we have bodies as well as spirits inside our bodies, and we
have more power over them.&nbsp; I think we can become so frightened of
them that we give them power at times, but I really am not scared of
them.&nbsp; I treated our ghost as&nbsp; a lost soul who wandered in
our home seeking some kind of comfort there, and we shared our dwelling
place with him.&nbsp; I felt sort of sad for the ghost, and felt a
sadness from his presence.&nbsp; I still wonder what happened to him to
cause him to haunt a house instead of move on.&nbsp; I believe he could
sense my acceptance and lack of fear, and my concern and compassion for
him.&nbsp; My husband thought I was nuts, but my kids believe.<br>
The second home we lived in that was haunted, we live in still.&nbsp;
When we first moved in a few odd things happened.&nbsp; There was a
door that would open and close in our living room, right in front of
us, although there was no breeze, and it was fairly hard to push across
the carpet.&nbsp; It would literally slam hard, and scare the daylights
out of us!&nbsp; Our stereo would turn off and on by itself as we sat
on the floor playing games.&nbsp; The first time it did that, we looked
at ourselves, scared, and then laughed, saying it must be a
ghost.&nbsp; One of my kids said, "We ought to give our ghost a
name."&nbsp; They decided that "Poca "HAUNT US" was the best, and they
still call our ghost that.&nbsp; It is a girl name, of course, but I
feel the ghost is a male, possibly one of the soldiers stationed at
Camp Kearns, which was here before our neighborhood was built.&nbsp; <br>
One night I heard a noise coming from the hallway, and I got up.&nbsp;
As I was walking down the hall, I saw my son's remote-control car
coming right at me, in little electronic jerks.&nbsp; It scared the
daylights out of me!!&nbsp; Especially the silly little toy man in the
driver's seat smiling at me!!&nbsp; I looked to see who was using the
remote controls, but I just found the controls laying on the floor,
with no one using them!!&nbsp; I thought my heart was going to leap out
my throat!!&nbsp; I went into my son's room to see if he was doing it
somehow, but he was only five years old, and he was sound asleep,
snoring gently in his bed.&nbsp; I checked each of my children, to find
them all fast asleep.&nbsp; I couldn't sleep for the rest of the night,
and I was afraid to tell my kids, because I didn't want them to think I
was completely off my rocker!!&nbsp; But I did tell them, and they
wanted to believe me, but I think the older ones were doubting a
bit.&nbsp; I didn't blame them!<br>
A couple of months later, however, my oldest daughter had the exact
same experience with the remote control car, in my son's bedroom!&nbsp;
Now they all believed me and my daughter both!&nbsp; We've had cupboard
doors slam by themselves and I've even seen the bluish-white
see-through form of a man in my basement one time in the dark as I was
going to get in bed; he didn't want to let me thorough my bedroom
door.&nbsp; I remember I just kept saying in my mind, "He can't hurt
me, he can't hurt me, I'm mortal, I'm more powerful than him."&nbsp; I
said firmly, out loud, "GO AWAY.&nbsp; NOW!"&nbsp; And I closed my eyes
and walked into my bedroom.&nbsp; I was shaking, but didn't see
anything after that.&nbsp; I didn't feel like he wanted to hurt me,
just to control me and keep me where he wanted me to be.&nbsp; I still
believe he is a lost soul, a soldier from the old days of Camp
Kearns.&nbsp; I don't know why he is still here among the living, but
my pity goes out to him.<br>
I wasn't afraid, but it was causing a few problems for my
children.&nbsp; They would get scared of the dark, and they would tell
kids at school and be ridiculed for believing in ghosts.&nbsp; So I
called on the priests and elders of my church to come and bless our
home.&nbsp; They did, and I felt a very good feeling when they were
here.&nbsp; We haven't had any problems with the ghost since
then.&nbsp; I don't know if the ghost is gone, or if he has just
stopped doing things while we are home, or stopped altogether.&nbsp; I
wouldn't move from this house because it is haunted.&nbsp; I'm not
afraid.&nbsp; As long as there is no harm, why worry?<br>

I forgot to include in my last account, that my next door neighbor told
me that everyone who had lived in the house before we did, also
complained about "ghosts or spirits" and the noises they made and
things they did in that house.&nbsp; There were some rumors about some
old man dying there, and one rumor about a woman being murdered
there.&nbsp; The most interesting thing to me is what I heard one day
when I took a walk past the old house.<br>
I live near the old house, and one day my daughter and I were out
walking and we saw the new people we had sold the house to, out in
their yard.&nbsp; I couldn't resist my strong urge to talk with them
and find out if they were experiencing the abnormal things we had when
we lived there.&nbsp; The wife could only speak Spanish, and she took
her young child and went into the house, but the husband was very glad
to talk to us.&nbsp; I asked him some general questions about how he
was liking the house, and then got brave enough to ask him if they had
had any experiences with ghosts there.&nbsp; His eyes opened wide and
he said, "YEAH!!&nbsp; Yes, yes!&nbsp; You, too??"&nbsp; I told him
about the banging in the bedroom and the footsteps in the hall;&nbsp;
the rattling of the doorknob and the motion lights coming on in the
back yard.&nbsp; He said they had experienced the same thing, and some
other wierd things.&nbsp; <br>
One time when they were downstairs watching a video, they heard the
upstairs stereo come on, and it was turned on to full blast.&nbsp;
Their three-year-old liked to turn on appliances, so they just thought
it was him.&nbsp; But when they came upstairs, the baby was awake,
standing up crying in his crib, and there was no chair or stool nearby
to show he could have reached the knobs to turn on the stereo.&nbsp; <br>
The scariest thing was that he and his wife had turned into a guest
bedroom, the room I used to hear all the banging noises when we lived
there.&nbsp; His brother came to stay the night and slept in that room,
or tried to.&nbsp; He said in the morning when he went to get up, he
found he couldn't move, as he was being held there by a ghostly
force.&nbsp; He said he felt like he couldn't breathe, and he began to
panick.&nbsp; Everyone laughed at him when he came out and told them of
his frightening experience, and said he had just been dreaming, but the
man who owned the house fully believed him.<br>

When I was Younger<br>
<br>
By: fiddlezapper@aol.com<br>
<br>
Not sure if I have sent this to the correct email but I just came
across your site and wanted to share a couple of experiences I had when
I was younger.<br>
My friend where I used to live in a small village in England lived in
an quite old house. Her dad was an avid collector of old coins and had
hundreds littered about the place. Anyway, one night I stayed over at
her house (I was around 9 at the time I think) and I slept in her room
on the bottom bunk. I was trying to get to sleep and I was just staring
at the TV and the little red standby light on the front of it. Suddenly
it went off. I didn't really think anything of it, I thought maybe it
went off after a while, I didn't know. Anyway, in the morning my friend
asked me why I had unplugged the TV. Confused I said I hadn't and asked
why. She said the plug had been pulled out of the wall. <br>
The second experience I had in the same friends house happened in the
conservatory while we were playing chess on the floor. Her mom had one
of those snowglobes that plays music when you wind it up. Suddenly the
snowglobe started playing the music but it was playing really fast and
as if it had been wound up and the winder was been pushed back the
other way so the music was all backwards and fast. That really scared
me, especially when the coal shuttle started to rock next to me on the
floor!!!!<br>
The same friend also told me that one night her, and her parents had
come home from been out somewhere. Her dad had gone to unlock the house
to let her mom and her in and then went back to put the car in the
garage. When he came to get back in the house he saw a pair of legs
with white ankle socks and a long skirt run up the stairs (the stairs
are directly opposite the front door) He called out my friends name
thinking it was strange as my friend was a bit of a tom boy and
definitely wasn't wearing a skirt. My friend had been down the garden
the whole time looking at the cockatoos they kept in an avery. <br>
Finally, my friends dad knew someone from work that claimed she was a
pyschic. He took one of his old coins in to show her in the hope she
could tell her a little bit about its origin.<br>
She told him a little bit about it and then shocked him by finally
telling him that one of the most recent times he looked at the coin a
young girl with blonde hair, wearing a long skirt and white ankle socks
was looking over his shoulder! Freaky! I moved away not long after and
we didn't keep in touch but as far as I know she is still living there
and I can only wonder whether they found out more about the ghost of
the young girl that resides there!<br>

White Haven Plantation<br>
<br>
By: blair.cardinale@gmail.com<br>
<br>
My name is Blair&nbsp; and I am originally from Mer Rouge, LA. I grew
up on White Haven Plantation, which was originally built in 1776. My
great grandmother bought the house from a Spanish family. We have the
original Spanish land settlement document. <br>
The house has 19 rooms downstairs and 5 upstairs. The numerous
buildings around included the barn, smokehouse, milk house, cooks
house, etc. <br>
My great grandmother, Gertrude Rolfe White, was a medium and would
frequently have seances. The woman who previously lived in the house
was also a medium. During these seances, attended by my grandmother,
father and other family members, many spiritual activies would occur.
We still the have actual spirit writings. My great grandmother would
hold a pen with her fingertips and her hand would quickly write. The
writings describe heaven and also told my great grandmother who her
guardian angel was.&nbsp; This is just one of many, many instances that
have occured. <br>
My parents bought the house in 1981, after my great grandmother passed
away. The first night they stayed there, they walked in the side door
to see a tall man sitting on the bed, wearing a German soldier uniform.
My great grandmother had housed numerous German soldiers there in the
past. This gentleman has appeared on numerous occasions. Over the
years, my Mother saw the majority of the spirits. She saw a little girl
a lot sitting in the corner of our sunroom and an older woman wearing a
long white gown. <br>
Many friends of the family have also experienced spiritual happenings.
Friends would ask my mom, "why didn't you come to the door yesterday?
you walked half way to the door and then turned around and went back to
the kitchen." Mom would say.."was i wearing all white?" hah..that man
has never come back to our house. There are so many things..I don't
even know where to start. <br>
I have seen my great aunt, who died before I was born, and my great
grandmother. My sister and I also used to see dogs in our bedrooms when
we were toddlers. That room used to have windows very low where the
dogs could come in and out. I have also heard more things that you can
imagine. In the middle of the night, I've heard things crash to the
floor and shatter. In the morning, everything would be in place with
nothing broken. Footsteps, whistles, coughs, people calling your name,
spirits sitting on the edge of your bed, lightly touching your shoulder
as you thought someone walked by, etc.... <br>
I can't even begin to tell all of the stories. Many people are scared
of our house, but it is only good spirits. If people are afraid,
spirits will not appear to them. It takes a lot of energy for a spirit
to appear to us. Usually, it is for a warning or as a sign. I've grown
up seeing/hearing things my whole life so it's nothing new to me. <br>

THE MAN ON THE STAIRS<br>
<br>

I have had very little ghost experiences. About a year ago I was doing
a huge school project and happened to have just finished so I was
reading this site. It was about midnight and I was about to get up to
go to bed, my room is downstairs in a two story house. As I walked
toward the stairs I saw a man, all black with red eyes. This probably
sounds fake, but it is totally true. I was so petrified I just sat
there staring at it, as it began to climb the stairs toward me,I fell
back onto the couch,.it reached my living room smiled at me and just
disappeared. I was so scared I refused to sleep in my room or go
downstairs for a few days. I haven't seen him since. But what I don't
understand why I saw him in the first place, it is a new house (few
years old) and we are the only family to live in it. Whatever happened
it was strange and I really don't understand why it came but it
did...well I will never doubt a ghost's existence...but I really
haven't ever really...<br>

Skeptical<br>
<br>
By: n.kaouthia@gmail.com<br>
<br>
Trenton, FL- I'm a bit of a skeptic when it comes to ghost stories,
though I have a feeling the house my mother lives in is haunted by
something.&nbsp; When we first moved in, there was carpeting in the
master bedroom only.&nbsp; In the middle of the floor was a large stain
that resembled a lot of blood.&nbsp; I considered maybe a home birth
since, out in the boondocks of Trenton, homebirth's weren't exactly
uncommon.&nbsp; However, I knew the only person who lived there before
me and she debunked my theory, saying she didn't even know there was a
stain of any sort on the master bedroom floor.&nbsp; During the middle
of the night, I would hear inhuman screaming noises in the distance
that I can't even begin to describe.&nbsp; I would often wake up with a
strong sense of fear that seems to come from the kitchen.&nbsp; A
friend who stayed over once slept on the couch and left in the middle
of the night because of the same reason.&nbsp; I hadn't told him of my
experience, either.&nbsp; Again, it was directed at the kitchen.&nbsp;
I've slept in the living room to wake up panicking in the middle of the
night and seeing "dark spots" in the kitchen when the lights are left
on (though it could be explained by just waking up in bright
light).&nbsp; My mother, on the other hand, doesn't get any bad
feelings, but she has felt someone rub her soulders and grab her on the
behind when she was alone in the kitchen.&nbsp; Some new information
told me that the grandfather of my friend who lived there before died
in the house which he built.&nbsp; There's a chance that his spirit
lingers and takes a liking to my mother, but wasn't too fond of me or
my friends, which for an old, southern man, wouldn't be
surprising.&nbsp; Either way, that's my story.&nbsp; If you have any
questions, you've got my email. <br>

&#8220;Paranormal of Pennsylvania&#8221;<br>
<br>
By: JOKERSBOX13@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I have had a lot of strange things happen to me and to my relatives. I
will start with my family and finish with me. My dad&#8217;s grand mom was
depressed and suicidal and was put in a mental asylum after two suicide
attempts. When she died in there my dad felt a presence in his bed [he
shared a bed with his twin brother and his grand mom would sleep in it
when she slept over.] so he rolled over to push his brother over he saw
him on the other side of the twin bed. The whole night both he and his
brothers al heard heavy breathing. The next night was fine but that
happened around thanksgiving the next year. my dad&#8217;s mom now lives in a
5 bedroom house all by herself and when she would pray at night she
would here voices with her [a heard a tape scary] she believes it to be
all the people that passed in the house. my mom&#8217;s uncle reconstructed
his house in the late 70&#8217;s when this happened strange things happened
like shoes being taken out of the closet all the widows and doors being
unlocked catching people out of the corner of your eye. Then in the mid
80&#8217;s it stopped just stopped. When my mom was little, she would, her
brother and cousins would smell pipe smoke even tough none one in the
house did and none of the neighbors did.&nbsp; and my cousin was saved
a couple of times like on time for example when a big lamp was about to
fall on her and it stopped in mid air and moved over about 2 feet [she
had enough time to get up!] and drop like it never stopped. Another
time like that happened when china closet leg broke and almost fell on
them then it stopped in mid air and got back up. they ran into the
kitchen and then when all of them where out of the area the heard a
bone chilling crash they went into the dinning room and to there horror
the closet fell over almost went through the floor if that didn&#8217;t
happen they would have been dead. my uncle was home once by his self
and heard knocking on all the walls of his bed room and also heard
Latin chanting he knows this because he went to catholic school]. It
stopped instantly when my grand mom got home. <br>
Then when my dad was a park ranger, he and a K9 partner was called to
the Poe house because report on light in there. When the got there the
door was, open and they heard a mooning. When the got to the basement
it got louder and the dog [king] became so scared he urinated and layer
down. Then a door began shaking he cocked his shotgun and his partner
coked his revolver the kicked open the door and a window flew open and
a very loud moon was heard and king howled. to there horror the found
another park ranger dehydrated and half conscious on the floor when at
the hospital he said he way sin there about four days ago and heard
something he went into a room and just feel asleep when the brief
periods came when he woke up the man claimed to hear people murmuring
but despite all his physical power he couldn&#8217;t move. Now on to me. The
first thing that really happened to me is when I was 8 or 9 and was at
eastern state penitentiary I was in death row all alone and thought &#8220;it
would be horrible to be locked up in here all day waiting to die&#8221; then
I heard a voice say you have no f*cking idea. I looked around and no
one was there I ran outside and asked my dad what f*uck means he got
mad and asked me where I learned it from I told him &#8220;the man in there
said it&#8221; with out finishing he went in there to &#8220;beat up the person who
was teaching kids bad words&#8221; he went in a found no one despite checking
it twice. One time while in the basement I happened to look into the
laundry room I saw a person in there but with out any legs and missing
a hand. I told my grand mom the next day and she said it was probably
my great uncle Stanley who lost from his waist down and his hand in
WWII. a couple of month later I woke up and saw a old lady in the
corner of my room when I went to my grand moms the next morning I saw a
picture of her wearing the same dress and she said it was my great
grand mom who died three days after I was born and she also said she
never got to see me. about 4 months ago I learned my sister and brother
where playing with a Ouija board [which I discourage] the next day I
woke up and I was home alone so I made a cup of coffee and as I was
sitting on my couch then I noticed a&nbsp; laundry basket filled to the
top with close fell over rolled to my feet and rolled back across the
room and stood up the I noticed the animals where starting to act up
the dogs where in on corner of the room and barking wildly at the
opposite the cats where clawing at the same one I felt very cold for a
second. fearing it my be non human I grab holy water and said a strong
a I cold &#8220;From where you came the power of Christ commands you to
return&#8221; then the light flashed I grabbed my keys jump I my car and
drove as fast as I could to my grandma&#8217;s house. The whole way there, I
felt like I was being watched. so I went into seven eleven grabbed a
cup of coffee and when I came out I saw my dead pop pop&#8217;s old dodge
drive by and till this day&nbsp; I&nbsp; still swear that that was him
in the drivers seat.&nbsp; when I got to my grand mom&#8217;s I went in then
about a 30 minutes later she asked me to go out with her to run some
errands she and my grand pop followed me in there minivan I parked and
my house went in to get my wallet [since I used the little cache a keep
in my car for toll booths up] I grabbed my stuff and when I walked out
of my room&nbsp; I saw a black foggy animal in my parent door way I ran
out to the car and my grand mom asked what was wrong I told her. She
got some holy water from her car and blessed the house after that
nothing happened I believe this is because she such a god relationship
with god. My family also tells me I physic or a medium or something
because I predict stuff or get a feeling for stuff. like for example I
would when I went to Gettysburg for a class trip I knew where almost
everything was and when I was standing in one spot and became filled
was drat and disappointment in myself. The tour guide said that was
where the retreating confederate forces where after general pickets
charge failed. Which my teacher later told me Robert E. Lee was feeling
the same way after the failed charge. Then I wanted to say I was
related to him but I decided to keep it to my self because I didn&#8217;t
won&#8217;t to be called crazy the whole way home. another example is when me
and my mom and dad lived in our old house [I couldn&#8217;t start school till
I was six because I was born in November] there was cemetery on the
next block over and when we would walk in it I would know the names on
all the headstones despite the fact I didn&#8217;t know how to read and no
one taught me. the last thing you can call paranormal was when I woke
up and saw who I thought was my dad in the hall way it was about 3 in
the morning and he usually wakes up at 5 so I whispered &#8220;dad what are
you doing&#8221; when he turned around it was my dead grantor [dad&#8217;s dad] I
never met him because I was born 2 years after his death I&#8217;m even named
after him but anyway he just laughed and spayed &#8220;No, it&#8217;s your popup
and tell your dad not to worry&#8221; the he disappeared. I told my dad the
next day and he spayed I was lying but the next morning he apologized
because my popup and a recently deceased deacon came to him in a dream
and said he wouldn&#8217;t lose the house and he would get money soon. lAfter
that day, an old cop friend who was very wealthy came to town and
offered my dad the money to get out of dot. <br>
Well that is all the paranormal events that I heard and happened to me hope you believe.<br>
