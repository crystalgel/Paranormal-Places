</H3><P>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Two years ago, I made a visit to the Gettysburg Battlefield. I</B>
<P><B>chanced to come upon the area known as the Wheatfield. I don't</B>
<P><B>understand why, but an incredible feeling of sadness overcame me as
I</B>
<P><B>gazed over the expanse of green and tried to imagine what it was like
to</B>
<P><B>be there in the heat of battle and to experience the terrible
bloodshed</B>
<P><B>that took place.</B>
<P><B>    I had read various books about the ghosts that are supposed to
haunt</B>
<P><B>the battlefield but had never really taken it seriously until I had
my</B>
<P><B>experience. To this day I have no explanation for what happened.</B>
<P><B>    That particular day I had spent quite a long time on the field
and</B>
<P><B>had decided to call it a day and head back home.</B>
<P><B>    I got home and was telling my husband about my adventure, he
wasn't</B>
<P><B>very much interested, but was busy with household chores and asked
me to</B>
<P><B>drive to town to get gas for the riding mower.</B>
<P><B>     On my way into town, I was driving along when suddenly, from the</B>
<P><B>back seat, there came a noise just as though someone were sitting in
the</B>
<P><B>back and would have reached forward and slapped their hands down on
the</B>
<P><B>back of the front seat beside me. This startled me and I simply
stopped</B>
<P><B>the vehicle and looked over my shoulder. Nothing was there but I
still</B>
<P><B>didn't understand what it could have been. I had not hit a pothole
or</B>
<P><B>anything that would have made the car vibrate or anything like that.</B>
<P><B>    The following day was Sunday, my husband was out in the garage</B>
<P><B>working on his antique truck, I was down in the basement cleaning and</B>
<P><B>just tinkering around, when directly overhead I heard someone RUNNING</B>
<P><B>back the hallway towards our bedroom. There was a tremendous thump
on</B>
<P><B>the floor and when I heard this I stopped what I was doing and
wondered</B>
<P><B>what was going on. It was a really heavy THUMP! like someone falling
to</B>
<P><B>the floor. I decided to investigate. I couldn't imagine why Bob would
be</B>
<P><B>running in the house. </B>
<P><B>     I came upstairs calling out, "What are you doing?" and proceeded
in</B>
<P><B>through the kitchen, living room and back the hall expecting to find
Bob</B>
<P><B>on the floor and hurt. I saw noone in the house, but the oscillating
fan</B>
<P><B>we kept in the window was on the floor at the foot of the bed.</B>
<P><B>    I was astonished to say the least! By this time Bob heard me
calling</B>
<P><B>and came in to find me picking the fan off the floor. I had asked him</B>
<P><B>why he threw the fan down. To this, he replied,"I wasn't in here- I
was</B>
<P><B>out in the garage the whole time!"</B>
<P><B>   Well, I thought for sure that he was pulling some kind of prank
and I</B>
<P><B>kept asking him to come clean and admit that he had done this. He
kept</B>
<P><B>insisting he didn't. I must tell you that even though the fan was</B>
<P><B>propped in the window that day, it wasn't plugged in or running at
the</B>
<P><B>time. Actually, there was hardly any kind of breeze whatsoever and
the</B>
<P><B>cats were both outside. We have placed that fan there many times to
draw</B>
<P><B>the cool evening air in and not one time has it ever fallen off the</B>
<P><B>window sill. And to add one more thing that happened; later that same</B>
<P><B>afternoon, we were both in the living room watching a movie. My
husband</B>
<P><B>was sitting in a chair beside the endtable where I have a picture of</B>
<P><B>Jesus on it. From out of nowhere, the picture fell off the table</B>
<P><B>backwards onto the floor. I just looked at him as though to say,"O.K.</B>
<P><B>enough is enough, you DID THAT!" To this very day, he swears that he</B>
<P><B>didn't get anywhere close to the picture.</B>
<P><B>    Well, this is my story, believe it or not, it is true. Did I
bring</B>
<P><B>someone home with me that day? Whomever it was they sure must have</B>
<P><B>wanted me to "break up" housekeeping. I haven't had any experiences</B>
<P><B>since that time but have been on my guard never knowing what to
expect</B>
<P><B>after a visit to Gettysburg.  goabob@epix.net</B>

<P>
<P><B>By: LMoore9508@aol.com</B>

<P><B>had a wierd expirience happen to me. Me and my boyfriend and three
friends </B>
<P><B>were sitting around talking about ghost stories when my boyfriend said
that </B>
<P><B>the lake by his house (grapevine lake) was haunted, he continued to
explain </B>
<P><B>of a family who lived next to the lake and that the father had killed
his </B>
<P><B>wife and son then commited suicide. The story says that If you park
next to </B>
<P><B>there house settlement (which is torn down except for the chimney)
turn off </B>
<P><B>your lights and car and wait yuor car will be pushed, he also noted
that if </B>
<P><B>you spread baby powder on the car you will see there hand prints. We
were all </B>
<P><B>very excited and decided to goof around and try it. I drove, my boyfriend
was </B>
<P><B>in the front seat and my friends in the back, we must have waited for
about </B>
<P><B>20 minutes when my friend in the backseat decided to be funny and yell
out </B>
<P><B>the window " hey you sick freaks why don't you show yourself and quit
</B>
<P><B>hiding....etc.) We all laughed for about a minute but thats all the
time we </B>
<P><B>had when all of a sudden the back of my car started bouncing up and
down, we </B>
<P><B>all were quiet and I could hear the wind blowing( thats how quiet it
was) the </B>
<P><B>front of my car expirienced a sudden jerk and my car started rolling
</B>
<P><B>backwards uphill! heading towards the lake! we were pushed about 200
feet </B>
<P><B>when it suddenly stopped and I did not wait a minute longer I turned
my car </B>
<P><B>on and threw it into drive we dorve for about 15 minutes and stopped
at a gas </B>
<P><B>station, two of my friends were now crying but me and my boyfriend
jumped out </B>
<P><B>and looked at the car, there were childrens shoe prints on the back
bumper of </B>
<P><B>my car and two sets of handprints on the front. me and my boyfriend
just </B>
<P><B>looked at each other, all my friends soon followed to witness the marks
on my </B>
<P><B>car. When we went back into my car it wouold not start(we have NEVER
had </B>
<P><B>problems with this car , its new) after about 10 mintues it started
and we </B>
<P><B>all went home that night we all decided to sleep in the same room together
in </B>
<P><B>fact we all crammed on the same bed(5 of us) now we are all between
18 and 21 </B>
<P><B>years old, never believed in this stuff or especially never were frightened
</B>
<P><B>before from it! I dont know how to explain it and I dont know your
opinions </B>
<P><B>but that is what happened. thanks.</B>

<P><B>The Maple Street Horror</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: pete@goffick.freeserve.co.uk</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>Hi, My name is Lynn and I now live in Somerset, England. My </B>
<P><B>story starts when we moved to a small town on an Island of the coast
of Kent </B>
<P><B>called Sheppey. When we went to view the house, I felt there was a
strange sort </B>
<P><B>of emtpy atmosphere, but because we had to buy in a hurry and we needed
a large </B>
<P><B>house, against our better judgement we went for this house. That was
the start </B>
<P><B>of six years of terror, which only stopped when we eventually left
the house. I </B>
<P><B>will list what happened and you can judge for yourself the sort of
duress we </B>
<P><B>came under at the hands of this or these entities. My daughter ( who
was about </B>
<P><B>nine at the time) had a cat called Willow, he loved to go out at night,
one </B>
<P><B>night I got up to get myself a drink, when I noticed on my daughters
bed a cat </B>
<P><B>that I at first took to be Willow,as it looked up at me a shiver went
down my </B>
<P><B>spine but I could'nt put my finger on why that should be. But then
through the </B>
<P><B>glass street door I could see Willow quite clearly sitting on the doorstep.
I </B>
<P><B>rushed back to my daughters room only to find the cat had disappeared,
I thought </B>
<P><B>I must have been dreaming,so I went back to bed and tried to forget
about it. </B>
<P><B>The next morning my daughter got up and she was covered in scratches
all down </B>
<P><B>her face and arms, I asked her what had happened and she said she had
woke up in </B>
<P><B>the night and had seen Willow on the bottom of her bed, she had a strange
</B>
<P><B>feeling about it and lifted it of her bed to put her out. Has she got
to the top </B>
<P><B>of the stairs she noticed Willow (as I had done) outside the street
door, at </B>
<P><B>that moment, the cat suddenly hissed and attacked her,she dropped the
cat ,and </B>
<P><B>it ran off. We searched the house high and low the next day, but it
was no where </B>
<P><B>to be seen, (there was no way out of the house, it was a very cold
winters night </B>
<P><B>and we had all the windows shut, we did'nt have a cat flap) I must
also mention </B>
<P><B>that Willow had never attacked anyone and never did again. Then there
was the </B>
<P><B>time I heard screaming I ran upstairs only to be confronted with my
daughter </B>
<P><B>laying on her bed, the bed was rocking violently, the covers were being
shook </B>
<P><B>off, and I've never seen such a look of terror in my life. One day
I was in </B>
<P><B>Woolworth's shopping when a women I had never met before came up to
me, shesaid </B>
<P><B>" You live in that horrible house in Maple street don't you"I said
"What do you mean"</B>
<P><B>She said her friend had lived there for a short time but had </B>
<P><B>to move out because of the terrifying goings on there, she said her
friend ad to </B>
<P><B>shut off the back end of the house because thats were the worse of
the activity </B>
<P><B>was. Also other houses in the street were affected. I will tell you
about these </B>
<P><B>and other things from my house if you are interested, because I could
go on for </B>
<P><B>ever. We actually appeared in the local newspaper, when I get my scanner
</B>
<P><B>installed I send you a copy of the article. Hope you find this interesting,
I </B>
<P><B>can assure you its 100% true (Iwishe it was'nt) </B>

<P><B>Many Strange Experiences</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Bellwitch@paranormal.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Ok this is the first time I have ever written anywhere and told anyone
my </B>
<P><B>experiences but I have much respect for your webpage and read it all
the time. </B>
<P><B>So I thought I might add my own to it.</B>
<P><B>I have never been chased by ghosts and all my experiences are my own.
 Because </B>
<P><B>I have always been the see it or hear it is to believe it type.</B>
<P><B>Where do I start I have had a quite a few isolated incidents that were
never </B>
<P><B>any danger to me.</B>
<P><B>First of all I have always been able to remember my dreams.  And the
first </B>
<P><B>"dream" I remember is when I was 4yrs old.  I was sleeping and I woke
up like I </B>
<P><B>was sliding up the bed into myself.    Well I dreamt I was in heavan
and walking around</B>
<P><B> with Jesus and there I was only 4yrs old.  </B>
<P><B>I guess the second probably was a dream I dont know.  But I was sleeping
 </B>
<P><B>were a bunch of others with us  And he showed me a room of people on
cots </B>
<P><B>holding there hands out to me and there was a door I couldnt go in.
 Strange I </B>
<P><B>guess.  </B>
<P><B>This next one is more on the lines of ghosts or spirits that you hear
in your </B>
<P><B>other stories.  But it was early new years morning and I  was spending
a night </B>
<P><B>at my brothers gfriends house.  I was only 11 at the time.  My mother
was in </B>
<P><B>the next bed and the only other people were a young boy and his sister
in </B>
<P><B>another room.  Well I was laying there and I heard a mans voice say
my name.  </B>
<P><B>Freaky and I jumped up and turned the light on.</B>
<P><B>The next incident happaned when I was 14 and there was a cabdriver
that used to </B>
<P><B>call our place the haunted house.  Which I thought she was crazy and
she sure </B>
<P><B>acted it (haha).  Well I was sleeping and my grandmother was in the
next bed and </B>
<P><B>I woke up and leaned over the bed and saw something that looked like
a sheet </B>
<P><B>and I reached for it and just as quick as u please snapped back.  And
I looked </B>
<P><B>back over the bed and it was back.  When I turned on the light it was
gone.  </B>
<P><B>I only have two more things that happaned to me  which were actually
recent</B>
<P><B>Last year I was sleeping and I always sleep with the lights on I was
alone and </B>
<P><B>my cat was at the foot of the bed.  Next thing I know I wake up the
bed is </B>
<P><B>shaking and the cat jumped up rather surprised.  That really scared
me bad!</B>
<P><B>The last thing happaned after I moved from Maine to Memphis Tn.  I
was born and </B>
<P><B>brought up in Maine and moved here because my fiance is here.  Well
anyway we </B>
<P><B>were coming down the highway and I looked up and so this miniature
white thing </B>
<P><B>run across the street no shape at all.  And apparently it disapeared.
 First </B>
<P><B>thing I thought of was a deer cause thats what we saw where I was from.
 But I </B>
<P><B>was in a city on a highway.  I asked him if he saw it and he said yes.
 </B>
<P><B>I guess the only other thing thats really strange is that I have also
heard </B>
<P><B>voices like I thought was a tv in the house coming home from work.
And things </B>
<P><B>have disapeared and turned up in strange places.</B>
<P><B>This all sounds crazy to me.  But I never would have told you if it
hadnt </B>
<P><B>happend specifically to me.  Thankyou for listening.  And I really
love your </B>
<P><B>webpage!  </B>

<P><B>Haunted Campus</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: ljo@gte.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I've been looking at your web site, love the additions! I decided to
sit</B>
<P><B>down and send you some of my ghost stories. Here is the first and
most</B>
<P><B>recent experience I've had. If you like I will send others at a later
date.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I work as a computer technician at the local college and this episode</B>
<P><B>occurred  while I was on a service call at one of the campus
extensions.</B>
<P><B>The campus extension is located on a former Army helicopter pilot
training</B>
<P><B>post that was primarily active during the Vietnam War. The first
impression</B>
<P><B>you receive when you drive through the gates is one of neglect and</B>
<P><B>abandonment. It is a very lonely and sad place. Most of the buildings
are</B>
<P><B>used for storage and a few companies have set up warehouses in the
area</B>
<P><B>close to the main gate. The most active portions are those used by
the</B>
<P><B>college and the National Guard, and it was in our buildings that my</B>
<P><B>experiences took place.</B>
<P><B>I was not alone that day. My new boss and my technical manager were
with me,</B>
<P><B>but they did not appear to be aware that anything unusual had happened.
We</B>
<P><B>went through three old classrooms that were used for storage and I
felt like</B>
<P><B>I was being watched the entire time. I also received a horrifying
impression</B>
<P><B>of a man who had been shot in the face while I was in one of the
store</B>
<P><B>rooms. My mental image was of a man in new, starched olive drab
utilities.</B>
<P><B>Half of his face was gone and the right side of his uniform was soaked
in</B>
<P><B>blood. I had the feeling that he wanted to communicate with me. I tried
to</B>
<P><B>ignore him as I was in the company of my manager and the head
maintenance</B>
<P><B>man. Fortunately he went away after a few minutes, leaving me wishing
to do</B>
<P><B>the same!</B>
<P><B>Our next stop was in the building used by the campus for classrooms.
The</B>
<P><B>feeling in this building was that of an incredible amount of energy.
I felt</B>
<P><B>like I was surrounded by people all in a hurry to get where they were
going.</B>
<P><B>I also had the sensation of being followed while in one of the hallways,
but</B>
<P><B>when I turned around, no one was there. It was very eerie feeling and
I</B>
<P><B>turned around and went back just to see if it would happen again. It
did.</B>
<P><B>This entity seemed to be enjoying the interaction, but he stopped
following</B>
<P><B>me whenever I came to the hallway intersection.</B>
<P><B>I did not get any solid proof of ghostly activity such as moving
objects,</B>
<P><B>cold spots or unexplained noises, but there is not a doubt in my mind
that</B>
<P><B>the place is haunted. I have often longed to question some of our
employees</B>
<P><B>there about it, and someday I will. I also intend on bringing some
equipment</B>
<P><B>with me the next time I go back in an effort to try and get something</B>
<P><B>tangible. If I am successful I will most certainly send the results
to this</B>
<P><B>website!</B>

<P><B> </B>
<P><B>I live in England. My grandparents have also lived in England </B>
<P><B>all their lives.They had just got married and moved into a new house
in Essex. </B>
<P><B>While they were there, they experienced these scary happenings; there
</B>
<P><B>were sightings of phantom coaches, a nun and a headless man.There were
</B>
<P><B>poltergeists throwing things about, mysterious footsteps, objects appearing
and </B>
<P><B>disappearing, bells ringing, writings on walls, and, from Borley church
nearby, </B>
<P><B>weird monastic chanting and organ music. They left shortley after.
No one </B>
<P><B>believed their stories but all I know is a rev. moved in and the happenings
</B>
<P><B>started again.</B>

<P><B>(Un) Holy Smokes</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: tsaltase@comcorpinc.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>This is an account of what happened to my friend Nora and her husband
Max</B>
<P><B>about one year ago in their house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Nora lives in the house she grew up in with her husband Max, her
mother</B>
<P><B>and younger sister Gina.  Nora's father passed away 4 years ago.
 There</B>
<P><B>have been quite a few strange occurances in Nora's house since her
father</B>
<P><B>passed away, but this one scared me the most when she told me about
it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One night, Nora was at home alone with her husband.  Her mother and
sister</B>
<P><B>had tickets for a play downtown, and would be home quite late.  Since
it</B>
<P><B>was about 10:00 at night, and the middle of winter, Nora and Max
decided</B>
<P><B>to go to their room and watch some television in bed.  After being
in bed</B>
<P><B>for some time, there was a knock on their bedroom door.  "Come in",
Nora</B>
<P><B>called out, thinking it was odd that her mother and sister were home
so</B>
<P><B>early.  No one came in.  Nora started thinking she imagined the
knocking,</B>
<P><B>but Max had heard it too.  Just as she was about to dismiss the whole</B>
<P><B>incident, there was another knock at the door.  Nora looked over at
Max,</B>
<P><B>hesitated for a minute, and then repeated, "Come in" louder this
time.</B>
<P><B>Still no one entered.  Since their bed faced the door, they both had
a</B>
<P><B>clear view without any furniture or other obstructions.  After what
seemed</B>
<P><B>like hours, a cigarette rolled under the door and into the room.  No
one</B>
<P><B>in the house smoked, except Nora's father who had passed away years
ago.</B>
<P><B>The house had been rid of all cigarettes by now.  It was bad enough
that</B>
<P><B>this cigarrette appeared in the first place, but it was the same
brand</B>
<P><B>that Nora's father smoked.  Max and Nora sat frozen in bed.
 Eventually</B>
<P><B>the two got up enough nerve to open the door and examine the hallway
and</B>
<P><B>the rest of the house.  As they suspected, Nora's mother and sister
had</B>
<P><B>not been home, and indeed did not make it home until about 1:00 a.m.
(Nora</B>
<P><B>and Max waited up for them).</B>
<P>
<P><B>Since then other things have happened in Nora's house (stereo coming
on by</B>
<P><B>itself, doors opening &amp; locking from the inside).  But they all
occur</B>
<P><B>quite sporadically.  It seems as though whatever entity is in the
house</B>
<P><B>doesn't want to harass them, but at the same time, doesn't want them
to</B>
<P><B>forget about it either.</B>

<P><B>The Swinging Plant</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Haven903@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My husband and I stayed the night at my mom's a few days before Christmas.
</B>
<P><B>There were several other people staying there too so the only place
where </B>
<P><B>there was room to sleep was in the spare room which was a room in the
center </B>
<P><B>of the home. My mom set up our bedding under a hanging plant. My husband
was </B>
<P><B>on the left hand side of me right under the plant. Eventually he felt
</B>
<P><B>uncomfortable and asked if I could trade him places. So we traded places
and </B>
<P><B>we lay side by side under this plant and we were facing upwards as
we talked. </B>
<P><B> Eventually the plant about a foot above us, started swinging back
and forth </B>
<P><B>with great strength. We were very confused but not afraid at all. We
tried to </B>
<P><B>come up with every logical explanation. 1.It couldn't have been drafts
</B>
<P><B>because there weren't any at all in the room. And it would have taken
quite a </B>
<P><B>large wind to blow in order to make it swing that violently. 2. No
one pushed </B>
<P><B>it because the house was completely still and we were both looking
up at the </B>
<P><B>time. We definitly would have seen someone push it. 3.My husband didn't
reach </B>
<P><B>up to swing it because one of his arms was under me,and the other one
was </B>
<P><B>over me and my eyes were open the whole time....So anyway,as my husband
and I </B>
<P><B>were talking amongst ourselves as to why this plant was swinging above
our </B>
<P><B>heads, the plant stopped. Then about an hr or two later,it started
swinging </B>
<P><B>again,then slowly came to a stop once we were discussing it again.
Nothing </B>
<P><B>else was unusual that happened in this house. The only clue I have
is that my </B>
<P><B>mom was having dreams about my dad being temporarily allowed to come
back </B>
<P><B>from wherever he was (he died a year before). And the way the plant
swung,if </B>
<P><B>it had come loose from the hook that it hung on,it would have landed
on Ian </B>
<P><B>and probably hurt him if he had remained laying on the left hand side
of me. </B>
<P><B>(My dad always hated my boyfriends. So maybe if it was him,then he
didn't </B>
<P><B>like seeing some guy laying with his daughter. He had died before my
husband </B>
<P><B>and I were married so maybe he didn't know he was my husband).  I am
very </B>
<P><B>confused about this situation. If you have any possible ideas or comments
</B>
<P><B>about this, please contact me and let me know. thanks. </B>

<P>
<P><B>  My daughter, at age 4, met the angel, or ghost, of her 6 year old
cousin, </B>
<P><B>who died from a fall from a 3 story window. It was creepy enough, that
my </B>
<P><B>daughter saw this child, even though we had not told her of the death.
It was </B>
<P><B>worse, when my child insisted she still saw her, night after night.
</B>
<P><B>Eventually, our ghost was gone.. We moved.</B>
<P><B>                In our new house, for one year with nothing, an odd
thing </B>
<P><B>came up. Karen, our ghost, had an older sister, alive and well. Her
name is </B>
<P><B>Heather. Heather is only 16.</B>
<P><B> She(heather) walked out on her baby, that she gave birth to, at age
16, and </B>
<P><B>I took this infant in my home. The baby lives me me...But boy do I
not feel </B>
<P><B>alone.</B>
<P><B>   Karen is back. As I type these words, this 10 month old baby is
laughing, </B>
<P><B>as if a person is with her in the crib. Karen, is the babies aunt.
I sound  </B>
<P><B>unreal, but as I speak, someone, or something, is making that baby
laugh.</B>

<P>
<P><B>   Okay here is my story. This is before I had moved to southern  
    </B>
<P><B>New Jersey. My mother poor, strived to make ends meet for us. I was
five </B>
<P><B>years old and still  sleeping in a crib at the time of the occurances
  </B>
<P><B>that terrorized me  for three nights. In the dead of night I would
wake up</B>
<P><B>for no reason  and become very curious. now before I go on I must</B>
<P><B>tell you my sister had Raggedy  Anne doll that I think she slept</B>
<P><B>with, I do know she at least had the doll but I can't remember if</B>
<P><B>it was her favorite doll or if she slept with it, well any way. one</B>
<P><B>night I awoke very curious as I  have just said. I peeked over my</B>
<P><B>crib out my  door way into the hall way, my mother's room just</B>
<P><B>to the right our two door ways creating a some what ninety-degree</B>
<P><B>angle. as I peered over the post of my crib it peeked from my</B>
<P><B>mother's door way slowly staring back into my eyes. it was the</B>
<P><B>Raggedy Anne doll as tall as a man now and very eerie looking. I was</B>
<P><B>scared and just dropped down into the crib but it was right next to
me</B>
<P><B>suddenly, it screamed out while gripping it's hand's around my</B>
<P><B>neck. I would wake up in the morning frightened not knowing if</B>
<P><B>it was a dream or if it had been real.I think it was real especial</B>
<P><B>with all the things that have happened since then. not big things but</B>
<P><B>little tell tale signs. that add up if you sit down and think about</B>
<P><B>it, the only strange thing is  these tell tale signs didn't</B>
<P><B>start to happen until  was eight-teen. I had this happen to me a</B>
<P><B>second night, and then only part of the third. I woke up curious</B>
<P><B>again, I would say but when I opened my eyes on the third night, I</B>
<P><B>simply closed them and went back to sleep. when I had  an</B>
<P><B>opportunity I destroyed my sister's Raggedy  Anne doll. I never had
a</B>
<P><B>problem again at least nothing as big as this.</B>
<P><B>Now when I was  eight-teen years of age a friend at the time</B>
<P><B>introduced me to paganism ( old nature religion and witch</B>
<P><B>craft faiths, druids, and  wiccans ) when I heard of this it I</B>
<P><B>had little  interest in it, but as time went by my interest</B>
<P><B>over night grew, until I practicaly sang to me.  since that time I</B>
<P><B>have seen things from the  corner of my eye. I have gotten</B>
<P><B>sudden feelings of dread when alone in my room which ever room of</B>
<P><B>any house i may have been living in since my junior year. I've</B>
<P><B>heard voices whisper in my ear encouraging thoughts I never verbaly</B>
<P><B>expressed. as recently as this past month I was  talking to my girl</B>
<P><B>friend on the phone when I suddenly got this urge to hang up on</B>
<P><B>her. the thought sort of desperate and and a bit but not   to much</B>
<P><B>so agressive came to me. hang up on   her. came my thought as if it
was</B>
<P><B>not my own. I  could feel my arm sort of tingling getting ready   to</B>
<P><B>slam the receiver down but with little effort I stayed on the line</B>
<P><B>though if I had just let go what very little control I need to</B>
<P><B>keep my arm  doing what I wanted I would have hung up on her.</B>
<P><B>that's about it. I've rambled on for to long.  everything I said has</B>
<P><B>been true. I can't prove it  but I at least know what my experiences</B>
<P><B>have been.</B>

<P><B>I Saw a Ghost</B>
<P><B>By:valerie-sheighn@gurlmail.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was about 10 years old I lived in a old two story house. My
room had</B>
<P><B>once been the room of a young girl who had died there. It was Christmas
Eve</B>
<P><B>and I was asleep and I remember waking up with cold chills. I looked
over</B>
<P><B>to the right of my bed and saw a young girl that was probably 5 or
6, she</B>
<P><B>had blonde hair and a little old fashioned blue sailer type dress on.
She</B>
<P><B>didn't do anything but look at me. Then I jumped under the covers and
never</B>
<P><B>looked again until morning. That was the only time I ever actually
saw a</B>
<P><B>ghost- but for the next 2 years that I lived in that house, almost
every</B>
<P><B>night at 10:30 I would hear footsteps by my bed. When we moved I never
had</B>
<P><B>any more experiences like that again.</B>

<P><B>The Footsteps on the Stairs</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: ZapMacaro@aol.com&gt;</B>
<P>
<P><B>In 1962, my father and a friend that he worked with purchased a farm
in </B>
<P><B>Michigans upper peninsula that had been vacant since the early 1950's.
The </B>
<P><B>farmer that had owned the farm previously had died there, his wife
also </B>
<P><B>having passed on there a few years before his own death. The house
was a two </B>
<P><B>story farmhouse with no running water or electricity, oil lamps providing
the </B>
<P><B>only illumination for the first few years we owned it. We eventually
had </B>
<P><B>electricity put in in the late sixties but the house never lost it's
"charm". </B>
<P><B>It was purchased as a hunting lodge and was used as such but eventually
we </B>
<P><B>started using it on vacations and at Thanksgiving as a kind of tradition,
my </B>
<P><B>mom having added a nice touch to the place.</B>
<P><B>  The house had a huge kitchen with a wood stove, and the living room
was </B>
<P><B>huge also, the oil furnace being the main attraction in the room. Off
to the </B>
<P><B>side of the room was a closed up stairwell that went to the second
floor </B>
<P><B>which was not heated and also not used by anyone in years. I believe
the last </B>
<P><B>time that door was opened by anyone was probably right after we bought
the </B>
<P><B>place. The door was sealed with strips of carpeting rolled up around
the </B>
<P><B>edges of the door to offer some kind of insulation from the cold air
</B>
<P><B>upstairs. If one was to open that door and walk into the stairwell
he would </B>
<P><B>first be confronted with a small vestibule and a closet that was under
the </B>
<P><B>stairs to his right. As one walked past the closet he would walk towards
the </B>
<P><B>window and turn right and go up the stairs that went directly up over
the </B>
<P><B>closet to the second floor. This floor was unfinished but had some
cages </B>
<P><B>against the walls whose purpose I have never discovered and would not
hazard </B>
<P><B>to guess.</B>
<P><B>  It was the second week of October, !979, when after a morning hunt
my </B>
<P><B>father and I found ourselves alone, he in the kitchen making stew and
I was </B>
<P><B>just dozing off, in that nether world between conciousness and sleep.
As I </B>
<P><B>lay dozing, I heard heavy footsteps coming down  the stairs from the
second </B>
<P><B>floor. It did not register in my mind what this implied. The footsteps
came </B>
<P><B>to a stop at the closet under the steps and a shuffling noise could
be heard </B>
<P><B>as if was either hanging something up or taking it down. After about
three </B>
<P><B>more steps the sound of the doorknob turning and then the door opening
and </B>
<P><B>shutting rather hard, (not quite a slam) I was in full possesion of
my </B>
<P><B>faculties and sitting up on the couch. At that, my father came out
of the </B>
<P><B>kitchen, looked at me and said with a look of consternation on his
face, </B>
<P><B>"What the hell was that?" I replied that I didn't know but that I had
heard </B>
<P><B>it also. At that point we both looked at the door, which had not opened
or </B>
<P><B>moved at all in the last several years.</B>
<P><B>His next exclamation, and I can quote him on this, was "lets get the
hell </B>
<P><B>outta here"</B>
<P><B>and that is exactly what we did. </B>
<P><B>  In his truck on the way into town (to the nearest bar, which was
in </B>
<P><B>Gladstone 17 miles away) we reinforced what the other had heard and
that was </B>
<P><B>the last time we discussed it to this day. When I bring it up he just
says </B>
<P><B>that it was a rather unusual experience.</B>
<P><B>  We returned to camp later that afternoon and it was never mentioned
to our </B>
<P><B>hunting partners, but we had a little trouble explaining why the stew
wasn't </B>
<P><B>ready when they returned. I can offer no explanation, but two people
in </B>
<P><B>separate parts of that house heard the same thing. I never did go upstairs
</B>
<P><B>again either, and in 1983 the house was hit by lightning and burned
to the </B>
<P><B>ground.</B>
