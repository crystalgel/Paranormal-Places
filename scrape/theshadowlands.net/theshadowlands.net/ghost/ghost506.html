Haunted All My Life<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shannonshanri@webtv.net<br>
when i was living in this house in 1999 in&nbsp; Hazleton, PA.. My
children and my boyfriends children were in the pantry and they were
arguing over something stupid. The English muffins lifted right off the
microwave and flew across the room.. Another time i was the only one
home someone threw a shoe at me... Another time i heard the kids at 1
in the morning running up and down the stairs giggling and playing with
a ball. When I got out of bed to put them back to sleep it got real
quiet and it wasn&#8217;t even my kids.&nbsp; Mine were sound
asleep....Another time I was laying in my bed and I heard rustling
noises on the side when I looked to the side it shuffled to the other
side when I looked at that side it shuffled back I was playing with
someone who. I don&#8217;t know.....another time there are two mirrors in my
room one to the left of me and one to the right.&nbsp; When I sit on my
bed in one mirror I can see a nun in black kneeling alongside me in the
other mirror I and see a nun in white&nbsp; <br>
standing over me.&nbsp; But when I look to the left and right of me
there was <br>
nothing.. Only in the mirrors...another time I seen a frail and fair
dark haired lady with a pale blue leisure suit on. I walked right over
to her and put my hand right through her....I moved out.&nbsp; My
boyfriend stayed it got to toilet flushing. Banging on walls, vacuum
cleaner running, and many more until one day the pipes just burst
forcing us out of the house.&nbsp; Anyway that&#8217;s just one of my
haunting stories...I&#8217;ve been haunted all my life, still am....<br>

Crescent Hotel in Eureka Springs, Ark.<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melodie.Terry@BankSterling.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
This has got to be the most haunted place I have ever experience, and I
am what is considered a "spiritual sensitive".&nbsp; My daughter and I
and 2 friends were attending the ghost tour in the hotel, when my
daughter abruptly got panicked and had to return to the room. Only
later did she tell me that while the guide was describing the event
that led to a young woman being thrown off of a third floor balcony by
an unknown person, did she have her hair tugged and a male voice
whispered "Anna" in her ear. She said she could even feel the hot
breathe on her neck. This was supposedly the name of the young girl who
was killed, Annabelle", but she had no clue at the time of the
tour.&nbsp; After that, she was a believer!<br>

Ghosts in the Southern Desert Correctional Center, Indian Spring Nevada<br>

i worked at sdcc for over 17 years and we have several housing units 8,
5, 3, and gun towers , and the prison culinary that are haunted, i will
start with tower 4, officers are not allowed to read or have a radio
when on duty, and the lt. or sgt. will check on the tower officers at
all times of the day, when in a gun tower you can see everything anyone
coming or going, so its easy to see if you are going to be checked on,
the door at the bottom of the tower will slam shut and foot steps a
very heavy tread will be coming up the winding staircase they will stop
at the top landing where there is a 10 foot ladder leading to a
trapdoor, then it just stops, thinking it is a sgt. or lt. i will walk
over to the trapdoor to help let them in, and when you open the
trapdoor there is nothing, and there is no way anyone can get out of a
60 foot stair well in just a few seconds and leave the tower are with
out being seen, many officer have had this experience and it happens so
many times we just don't pay much attention and just say to&nbsp;
myself&nbsp; ( the tower 4 ghost) and leave it at that, the prison
culinary has many ghosts, when all is done at the end of a feeding and
clean up and all the inmates are sent home for the evening and the
shakedown of the culinary begins, in the mop room you can hear voices
almost like a party is going on and i would look at my partner and she
would look at me and one of us will say i thought we got rid of
everyone, well there is a prison count coming and we had better find
these people and send them home so off to the mop room we will go and
when lisa and i get to the mop room&nbsp; there is nothing, and the
noise has stopped, this has happened so many times i just pay not
attention to the party or what ever is going on, once when working
alone in the culinary with out a crew or officer&nbsp; i saw a dark
figure pass by a observation window i got up and left my office to see
who it was&nbsp; but there was no one and nothing to be seen, in unit 5
during a prison count and prison counts are very serious, but when you
have more&nbsp; inmates in your unit it throws off the state count, so
s/e or search and escort is sent to do a count, its always the same
cell or room as we call them that has the extra inmate, s/e can't find
the extra inmate the ghost of unit 5&nbsp; has been seen again , the
ghost of unit 8, unit 8 is a lock down unit for people who cant conform
to any rules, the inmate is let out of his room for 30 minutes a day
for exercise, i was doing a health check and no one was out of there
room i heard some one walking behind be with bare wet feet as if he
just came out of the shower and when you turn around to see who is
there no one is to be seen, many officers and staff have heard and seen
many&nbsp; strange things we don't consider them a threat and they have
never hurt any one so we concentrate on the real danger the inmates.<br>

Hartsdale, NY Hauntings<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ramystein@gmail.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
I have spent most of my life growing up in Hartsdale, NY, a block away
from the Ferncliff Cemetary, directly behind the old cemetary flower
shop. When I was younger, and our family first moved into the house, my
mother would yell at my father, blaming him for leaving the door <br>
to the basement open, claiming that my sister and I could easily fall
down the stairs and hurt ourselves. My father would always deny it was
him who was opening the door. It could not have been my sister and I,
because the bolt to keep the door closed was too high for us to reach
at that age. My father wanted to test if it could be someone else. My
father, my mother, sister and I all went into the guest room to to
watch a movie one night around the times of the door constantly being
opened. Before the movie started, my father went downstairs to check
and make sure the door was closed and the bold was locked. Halfway
through the movie, he went downstairs and realized that the bold was
un-done and the door was wide open. My mother had to have priests come
over one day and do whatever it is they do when there is signs of a
ghost in a house.&nbsp; Clearly it didn't work, or maybe there is
different spirits because that isntance isn't the only time.&nbsp; One
day, around the time we were about to re-model the kitchen, I walked in
the house and my mother looked at me like she saw a ghost. Thats
because she actually saw this white form of a little girl running up
the stairs and into my bedroom. Often, I have come home and heard
voices or whispers. I would yell out that I am home to inform whoever,
thinking my mother or someone else was home, that I had come back from
school. I would then go around the house and realize no one was there.
At first I would think there were theives who broke in and hide.
Eventually, I realized this was a common occurance and did not want to
be home alone by myself because of this. My mother has heard voices
too.&nbsp; When I moved away for a while to live in New Jersey, I would
get frantic phone calls from my mother to come home to vist her because
she constantly heard voices and objects would move on their own. One
night, the most terrified I ever heard my mother, she said she did not
get any sleep because she kept hearing things, objects moving about and
then the wireless doorbell she had recently installed went off at
around 2 or 3am. She went as far as to take the batteries out but the
bell continued ringing for a good half an hour or so. I believe she
said her bed was shaking too before any of this happened.&nbsp; Books
have flown off shelves and across the room in my sister's bedroom. This
has happened on several occasions. I also recall as a child, my toys
moving on their own and me just telling myself that it was all in my
imagination because I could not believe what I was seeing, resulting in
me just hiding under my covers until sunrise.&nbsp; Finally, I know
this is probably just a weird coincidence, but the day my old
refridgerator died, was ironically the same day the elderly grandmother
of the previous owners' died. She was very fond of that old fridge and
was very upset that the family did not decide to take it with them to
the next house they moved off to. I just consider it an odd
coincidence, but whatever. The damn thing was old as time so I was
surprised it even lasted as long as it did.&nbsp; Oh, and while on the
subject of paranomal, the Ferncliff Cemetary. Never had a problem with
it until one night I was walking through. My friends and I would always
cut through the cemetary to get to one another's houses cause it was
safer than walking on the main and busy streets. Usually we would go in
packs, or if alone, during the day time. I don't anymore because, well,
besides the fact I can drive now, one night when the moon was full and
you could see clearly that no one was around except for the fields of
graves, I constnatly heard voices whispering. I would constantly look
around thinking maybe it was some teenagers drinking (that is what kids
used to do in town, drink in the cemetary) but no one was anywhere in
sight. I know my house in this town/area near the cemetary is not the
only one that has or is still being haunted. On the other side of the
cemetary, in White Plains, there is another house, near my where my
mom's friend lives where the mother thought the son was making up an
imaginary friend that he would talk to until one day she saw for
herself an apirition of an olderly man rise up from the ground of the
room she has her washer and dryer in and the vanish.<br>

Ghost at UVM Grasse Mount Burlington VT<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anonymous<br>
<br>
In 1985 I was employed by UVM&#8217;s Dep&#8217;t. of Continuing Education, then
located in Grasse Mount.&nbsp; My office was on the second floor.&nbsp;
One summer evening I was working late.&nbsp; As I worked I became aware
of sounds of someone working in the front room, downstairs on the first
floor.&nbsp; I assumed that a colleague was working there; I heard
sounds of a typewriter (there were both typewriters and computers in
use), a desk chair being rolled across the floor, file drawers opening
and closing, footsteps.&nbsp; Connecting the two floors is a circular
staircase.&nbsp; When I finished working (approximately 2 hours later),
as I came downstairs, I asked &#8220;who&#8217;s been keeping me company
here?&#8221;&nbsp; I glanced into the front room&#8230;no one was there!&nbsp;
Needless to say, I ran out the front door.&nbsp; The next morning I
asked everyone on the staff if they had worked late&#8230;no one had.&nbsp;
Aside from being totally startled by finding no one in the room, my
&#8220;feeling&#8221; while I was working upstairs was that whoever was downstairs
was quite amiably keeping me company.<br>

My Ghost Experience<br>
By: odieloft@gmail.com<br>
It is an event I will never forget, and cannot explain.&nbsp; It was
the summer of '96, I was 15.&nbsp; It started out as a normal summer
day, a perfect day to sit outside and enjoy the sun.&nbsp; All five of
us girls were sitting outside Angie's house.&nbsp; She lived on a busy
street, and had a retaining wall running the entire length of the
sidewalk in front of her house, with a set of four stairs in
front.&nbsp; We were sitting on the wall/stairs, smoking cigarettes and
waiting for some friends to come pick us up to go to the lake.&nbsp; I
am unsure which one of us noticed him first, but we all saw him.&nbsp;
He came from our left, and walked right up to us, staring at Angie the
entire time.&nbsp; He was wearing what I can only describe as a polo
uniform.&nbsp; He had on beret type of hat, a wide, horizontally
striped shirt, khaki pants, and loafers.&nbsp; On his shoulder a dark
brown bag was slung.&nbsp; It was not the everyday attire of anyone we
had ever come across before.&nbsp; We were never the kind of girls to
be frightened by a stranger walking up the street, but this was not
"normal".&nbsp; We try to engage him in conversation, asking him who he
was and what he wanted, but he continued to walk towards us, staring at
my friend.&nbsp; He stops right in front of her and asks: "Are you
Angie?"&nbsp; He repeated himself about half a dozen times.&nbsp; At
this point, we were very upset with him, yelling at him to go away,
that he was a freak, typical teenage girl response.&nbsp; He must have
realized he was not going to get anywhere with us and turned around to
start walking away, so we turned to each other, and commented on how
weird that was.&nbsp; We looked up to watch him walk away, trying to
see if we could figure out if he lived around there, or had a friend
waiting in a car, but he was nowhere in sight.&nbsp; The only place he
could have vanished to was the alley down the block, so we ran down
there, but still no trace of him.&nbsp; We ran to the end of the block,
but still nothing.&nbsp; We dismissed it as just some crazy freak, and
went on about the rest of our day, trying to forget about it.&nbsp;
Now, if the story ended here, I probably wouldn't think it was anything
but weird. If only the story ended there.&nbsp; The next day, Sarah and
I walked back over to Angie's house.&nbsp; We were walking through the
backyard, in the early afternoon, sun was shining, nobody else
around.&nbsp; I turned to Sarah and asked her: "What if that creepy guy
comes back again today?"&nbsp; She replies: "Don't worry, he
won't."&nbsp; The next thing we heard was very loud demonic laughing,
like somebody had hooked up surround sound to the trees around
us.&nbsp; The laughing continued until we made it up the stairs to the
door.&nbsp; There is no explanation for what we heard.&nbsp; It was in
our ears, and shook us to our core.&nbsp; We never saw the guy again,
or heard that horrible laugh.&nbsp; All I know for sure is that it felt
wrong, it felt evil, and I am not easily frightened.&nbsp; This is the
first memory I have of anything in this category.&nbsp; <br>

Castle Almere<br>
By: Anonymous&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
Everyone says the construction of "Castle Almere" was interrupted
because of money issues and no agreement on the laws. But this is what
really happened. Unfortunately, due some problems with the construction
company, only half of the ordered constructers could be put on the job.
This was kind of a problem, because it was the end of 2005 and the
owner of the plan wanted the castle to be finished by the end of 2008.
So the only possible solution was to let the constuctors work in two
groups. One group would work on daytime and the other group would work
at night. Everything went great for six months in a row. Then suddely
the constructors wanted to swich shift. They refused to work at night
or tell anything about why they wanted to switch, so the other group
had to agree and changed shifts. This went well for another six months.
Then the other group of constructors started to complain. They also
refused to work at night, but this time the company was done switching
and told them to keep on working at night. Because they found out the
constuctors sneaked out and went home, they one night closed the fences
and gates around the castle so the constuctors couldn't get away 'till
morning. At night, they could hear the constuctors scream and yell and
they heard their equipment making lots of noise. But the guards didn't
saw anyone coming out of the castle. The next morning they opened the
gates to go have a look. What they encountered was <br>
horrible. The constuctors killed each other with chainsaws, hammers,
really everything you could kill someone with. It looked like a
massacre, but there was one very strange thing they couldn't figure
out. "DONT STOP BUILDING" was written with blood on every wall inside
the castle. After the horrible incident the construction was shut down
and they made something up for the newspapers. Nowadays it's impossible
to enter the castle, but if you manage to get in, be sure to leave your
tools at home...<br>
