</H3><P><B>by salomon@concord6.powersoft.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>In the the Winter of 1995 I worked in a Youth home that was over a
hundred </B>
<P><B>years old. Since it was during Christmas vacation most of</B>
<P><B>the kids had gone to their families, or stayed with friends and only
8 were </B>
<P><B>at this large home.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Late at night I walked down a dark hallway making sure all the kids
were in </B>
<P><B>bed. At the end of the hall was a large mirror. Looking down</B>
<P><B>this hall I could see myself and the hall behind me. I also saw an
old women </B>
<P><B>dressed in white. She had no expression on her face but we</B>
<P><B>made eye contact through the mirror.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Without turning my head I called out asking why she was upstairs. I
had </B>
<P><B>thought see might be a staff member, though there were only</B>
<P><B>two other staff members and neither of them looked anything like her.
The </B>
<P><B>woman slowly turned away and started walking. I wiped my</B>
<P><B>head around and saw no one.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I then jogged down the hall and rounded the corner and still saw no
one. At </B>
<P><B>that moment I felt very uncomfortable, as though I was in</B>
<P><B>someone else's house without their permission. I left the area shaking
and </B>
<P><B>went to speak with the other staff members. Keep in mind that</B>
<P><B>their were no kids at that side of the house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>After speaking with several staff members in confidence over the next
couple </B>
<P><B>of months I uncovered that most of them had seen this</B>
<P><B>same women in white. One staff member stated that she felt a hand grab
her </B>
<P><B>shoulder but she didn't see anyone nor was anyone home at</B>
<P><B>the time.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Another staff member, (my supervisor), heard his name called loudly.
He ran </B>
<P><B>down the stairs and saw a smoky apparition of a women in</B>
<P><B>white just before he ran through her. He said he felt a bone chilling
cold </B>
<P><B>and he experienced a sense of terror, but thought the feeling was</B>
<P><B>from the ghost not from him. At noon, while the kids were at school,
three </B>
<P><B>staff members witnessed a women in white walk by the door</B>
<P><B>of the main office. Since the doors were locked, and no one was home,
they </B>
<P><B>had thought someone broke in. When the staff members</B>
<P><B>went out to talk to the women, no one was there.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Several of the kids that are housed there reported seeing a woman as
well as </B>
<P><B>a few other people. One girl, who was very stable and</B>
<P><B>never cried, was screaming. When I had gone in to see what was wrong
she </B>
<P><B>said a woman walked into her room and smiled at her. This</B>
<P><B>same story was told by several of the girls. Since this place houses
young </B>
<P><B>girls the staff felt it best to vehemently deny any stories about</B>
<P><B>ghosts. In at least one case a staff member was fired due to his inability
</B>
<P><B>to keep this fact a secret. After researching this house I found</B>
<P><B>that it had once been privately owned by a family who had been murdered
in </B>
<P><B>the house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is a true story from Newburyport, Mass. I welcome your comments
or </B>
<P><B>similar experiences.</B>

<H3><A NAME=indiana>Multiple Visits in Indiana</A>
</H3><P><B>by rlehman@skyenet.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>There's more than corn in Indiana or at least from my experiences there's
a</B>
<P><B>few ghostly hauntings to visit you along the way. My first experience
with</B>
<P><B>ghostly guests was when I was about 7 years old or so. We lived in
a small</B>
<P><B>house in Mishawaka near the old Grand Trunk railroad that crosses
through</B>
<P><B>our two Citys (South Bend being the other one). One summer night I
was</B>
<P><B>laying awake in bed looking out my window into the darkness dreaming</B>
<P><B>boyhood things that typical 7 year olds dream about when all the
sudden</B>
<P><B>this dark faceless shadow figure looks in on me from the window
holding</B>
<P><B>what looked to be a latern that eminated a eary glowing light that
did not</B>
<P><B>caste about the house or figure but stayed within it's latern shape.</B>
<P><B>Terrified of this visitor thats watching me from my window I darted
out of</B>
<P><B>my room screaming for my mom and dad which slept in the room next door.
My</B>
<P><B>father went outside to investigate and found no footprints at the
window</B>
<P><B>and the dog outside was calm. (It rained earlier and my mother had
a garden</B>
<P><B>around the foot of the house in the back and side with fresh dirt,
so there</B>
<P><B>should of been something!). Of course my parents dis-missed me and
let me</B>
<P><B>sleep on the couch that night, for I was to terrified to go back to
that</B>
<P><B>bedroom. The next morning I went about my daily ritual of bothering
the</B>
<P><B>next door nieghbor lady which was one of the older senior citizens
who us</B>
<P><B>block kids liked hanging around with and I told her about my visitor.
As I</B>
<P><B>described what I saw her face became pale and she told me that 20 years
ago</B>
<P><B>her husband worked for the rail road as a switchman and it was just
down</B>
<P><B>the path a little ways from the house at the tracks that very night
he met</B>
<P><B>his death from a train while walking home along the tracks from work
late</B>
<P><B>at night.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My parents were a transient type of family so we ended up in various
places</B>
<P><B>during the 12 years I lived with them. We moved to Plymouth Indiana
for</B>
<P><B>awhile when I was about 10 years old. One day while walking down the
street</B>
<P><B>with the nieghborhood kids on my way to my first day at school we passed
a</B>
<P><B>boarded up house which a group of the kids with me told was haunted.
They</B>
<P><B>told me a few years prior a young single woman was brutally raped and</B>
<P><B>murdered in that house and ever since everyone was scared of going
in it.</B>
<P><B>Being the inquisitive type that I was I took it upon myself to prove
those</B>
<P><B>scardy cats wrong and go explore the house myself. I took my trusted
dog</B>
<P><B>with me one day over to the house and I entered the doorway. My dog's
hair</B>
<P><B>raised on his back and ran, thinking nothing about his odd behavior
I</B>
<P><B>continued in the house. I explored the house from room to room for
awhile</B>
<P><B>and nothing happened. Then while standing in the dining room looking
around</B>
<P><B>a very cold chill overcame me and I felt something ice cold grab my
arm and</B>
<P><B>hold it tight for a few seconds. I was scared out of my wits and ran
home</B>
<P><B>as fast as I can. I felt a burning sensation on my arm where it was
held by</B>
<P><B>that chilling hand and discovered a bright red mark on my arm the shape
of</B>
<P><B>slender fingers. To this day I still have a scar on my arm in place
of that</B>
<P><B>mark that outlines a finger, and since that day I have became oddly</B>
<P><B>sensitive of apperations and in most cases they tell me who they are
and</B>
<P><B>why they are here. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Then at around eleven years old I was living in a foster home and while
our</B>
<P><B>foster parents were away one night my foster sister and brother and
I got</B>
<P><B>bored and broke out the wee-gee (dont ask me to spell it) board. We
were</B>
<P><B>playing with it for awhile when all the sudden this horrible pig like
demon</B>
<P><B>thing start scratching at our living room window and the pointer on
the</B>
<P><B>board was going nuts! Of course, we swore off wee-gee (dont ask me
to spell</B>
<P><B>it) boards ever since. Maybe this has something to do with the
previous</B>
<P><B>encounter, I'm not sure, but this next story is.</B>
<P>
<P><B>All my other encounters with spiritual sights from that day untill
I was 25</B>
<P><B>was more of a sensing than of a actual visit. But one night I was
visiting</B>
<P><B>a girlfriend and her friends house up in the woody nieghborhood area
of the</B>
<P><B>Notre Dame campus. I told the girls I had to use a tree and would be
right</B>
<P><B>back and procceded to the woody section next to her house. I entered
the</B>
<P><B>section and saw this ghostly woman about 19 - 22 years old standing
there</B>
<P><B>crying and I asked her why. She told me her name was Mary Milner and
she</B>
<P><B>was raped and murdered in 1971 at that spot while on her way to class.
She</B>
<P><B>wanted to see her Mother in Philedelphia but did not know how to get
home.</B>
<P><B>We must of been in a ghostly conversation for a spell because the gals
were</B>
<P><B>calling for me and throwing their usual shake it more than once insults.
I</B>
<P><B>walked out of the cluster and they said I was white as a ghost (I
usually</B>
<P><B>am after an encounter, they seem to take alot out of me) and I was
chilled</B>
<P><B>to the bone. I told Suzy (my girlfriend's friend) about what I saw
and what</B>
<P><B>the woman told me and Suzy said without a doubt that situation
occured.</B>
<P>
<P><B>If you think these incidents are interesting, you should read my
great</B>
<P><B>grandfather's book on Poltergiests; fact or fiction circa 1910. One
fo the</B>
<P><B>first scientific studys ever conducted in the Midwest by Daniel Lehman.
One</B>
<P><B>of the storys I recall my grandfather telling me was when he was boy
he</B>
<P><B>used to go to the field trips with his father and there was this farm
house</B>
<P><B>that was haunted they were investigating. Everytime someone tried to
live</B>
<P><B>there hot iron nails would fly at them from nowhere and suddenly
disappear</B>
<P><B>as fast as they came. </B>

<H3><A NAME="hat man">The Hat Man</A>
</H3><P><B>by tjarvis@falcon.cc.ukans.edu</B>
<P>
<P><B>Fortunately, I have not seen anything ghostly for </B>
<P><B>awhile..unfortunately, I've had a lot of bad premonitions.  I will
</B>
<P><B>tell you a story that happened several years ago. The details are kind
</B>
<P><B>of fuzzy. But, what I can remember is that I was walking down the </B>
<P><B>upstairs hall of my house and in the last room I caught a glimpse of
a </B>
<P><B>man in a suit  and a hat like they used to wear...in the 20's or 30's.
</B>
<P><B>THat room used to be my room when I was a kid, and I thought it was
</B>
<P><B>creepy (more stories) anyway, he disappeared...then one day I was at
</B>
<P><B>work ( I worked at a donut shop and it was at least </B>
<P><B>afternoon..daylight) I was there all alone..when I heard the bells
on </B>
<P><B>the door jingle as if someone were coming in. I looked up and caught
a </B>
<P><B>glance of the same figure standing against the wall. It was really
</B>
<P><B>weird. My friends and I call him "the hat man". Haven't seen him </B>
<P><B>since.</B>

<H3><A NAME=guardian>Guardian Spirit</A>
</H3><P><B>by lintili@nac.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was in high school in 1976 I was in a terrible car accident.
 The</B>
<P><B>funny thing is right before the car I was riding in struck the
telephone</B>
<P><B>poll, I jumped into the back seat and went immediately to sleep.  I
would</B>
<P><B>have been decapitated as the force of the hit caused the hood of the
Buick</B>
<P><B>to come to a point and pierced the seat where I was sitting.  I
remember</B>
<P><B>waking up and although I was in shock I can remember seeing the other
two</B>
<P><B>people that were in the car as well.  I remember looking out the window
and</B>
<P><B>there was a figure leaning in towards me.  I know it was a man, however,
he</B>
<P><B>was luminating and looking at me.  I can recall a sense of friendlinesss
and</B>
<P><B>knew everything would be alright.  After four years of pain that
followed</B>
<P><B>that tragic night, I was sleeping in my room in my parents house when
I</B>
<P><B>rolled over to my right side and there was the same figure.  He was
sitting</B>
<P><B>beside my bed watching me.  For an instant I froze then wiped off the
covers</B>
<P><B>and ran to my parents room.  As I was waking my mother up I remembered
the</B>
<P><B>night of the accident and this warm presence that was with me that
night and</B>
<P><B>realized it was the same spirit.  My mother, being the good Catholic
mother</B>
<P><B>that she is, told me it was my guardian angel coming to tell me
everything</B>
<P><B>would be alright.  I often wished that I did not run from the room
that</B>
<P><B>night as I missed an opportunity to try to communicate with him.
   Years</B>
<P><B>passed and I was travelling home from work one Saturday afternoon.
 The exit</B>
<P><B>for my home was a two lane exit to the left and I was in the right
hand</B>
<P><B>lane.  There was little traffic if any that day.  As I was about a
mile from</B>
<P><B>my exit, I felt the presence of the spirit again and he told me that
the big</B>
<P><B>brown van barreling up in the left hand lane was going to cut me off.
 As</B>
<P><B>the two lane exit approached and I would normally just go with the
road, I</B>
<P><B>let up on the gas, slowed down gently and sure enough the van cut me
off.  I</B>
<P><B>would have been killed.  I was totally calm anticipatingg this to
happen.</B>
<P><B>And then he was again.  I often think about this spirit or angel that
I have</B>
<P><B>and maybe one day I will have the opportunity to thank him.</B>

</H3><P><B>by mroach@tctc.com</B>
<P>
<P>   <B>My name is Mike and I saw something in your story that caught my</B>
<P><B>eye. When I was around 8 years old I woke up one night and had to go
to</B>
<P><B>the bathroom. When I came back, I got in bed and pulled the covers
up</B>
<P><B>to my chin. We had a hallway light that was left on all night so we
</B>
<P><B>could find our way to the bathroom at the end of the hall. As I lay
</B>
<P><B>there for about 1 minute, I saw a shadow coming down the hall and I</B>
<P><B>thought, oh I must have woke mom up and she's coming to see what I'm</B>
<P><B>doing. I was shocked to see a little man?? about 2-3 ft. tall turn
in</B>
<P><B>my doorway! He just stood there and I couldn't see his face because</B>
<P><B>once you step in my doorway the hallway light doesn't shine on you</B>
<P><B>anymore. I could tell that it had a hat on that looked like the kind</B>
<P><B>that the pilgrims wore. I could also tell that it had a long bushy</B>
<P><B>beard, but I could not see his face clearly. I sat there and I was
so</B>
<P><B>scared I couldn't move, then he started to walk to the end of my bed.
I</B>
<P><B>just about s**t my pants! The only thing I could think of to do was
to</B>
<P><B>lay down and pull the covers over my head because he blocked the only</B>
<P><B>exit out of my room. I layed there under the covers waiting for him
to</B>
<P><B>get on the bed and grab me. I must have layed there about 5 minutes
but</B>
<P><B>it seemed like eternity. I finally got the courage to slowly pull the</B>
<P><B>cover down and I couldn't see him anywhere. I jumped off the end of
the</B>
<P><B>bed in one leap and flew into mom and dads room. I woke mom up and
told</B>
<P><B>her what I saw but she just said I was dreaming and to go back to
bed.</B>
<P><B>I'll tell you that I went and turned on every light in the house and</B>
<P><B>looked around all over the place. I didn't go to sleep until the sun</B>
<P><B>came up and I am positive that I did not dream it. I am 40 years old
now</B>
<P><B>and I still am a little afraid of the dark. The only people I have
told</B>
<P><B>this story to is my mom (who passed away in 1978) and my present
wife.</B>
<P><B>It hit me like a ton of bricks when I saw your story about a small</B>
<P><B>person! I couldn't quite tell if the one I saw had an oversized head</B>
<P><B>though and I wonder how many other people have seen the same thing
but</B>
<P><B>was afraid to say something about it! I have only seen this thing
once</B>
<P><B>and that is all I care to see too!</B>

<H3><A NAME=malaysia>Story from West Malaysia</A>
</H3><P><B>by aeka@pl.jaring.my</B>
<P>
<P><B>I live in West Malaysia and the paranormal has been a mix of
curiousity</B>
<P><B>and fear for me...</B>
<P><B>	In my whole life, I have experienced 3 ghostly activities; more than</B>
<P><B>the rest of my family. My first sister heard noises but had not no</B>
<P><B>concrete proof of it being a paranormal activity. However, my second</B>
<P><B>sister had had a full perspective of an apparition which was
connected</B>
<P><B>to the story I'm about to tell below. </B>
<P><B>	My last sister, at 2 years of age had, one night, freaked out</B>
<P><B>hysterically for only 20 seconds whilst staring in mid air. This was</B>
<P><B>explained later when she was 3, very vividly but with no hard
evidence.</B>
<P><B>However, the incident had an unusual side-effect. After the
apparition,</B>
<P><B>which seemed to be a Victorian Englishman dressed in black with a top</B>
<P><B>hat and red glaring eyes, my sister constantly complained about pain
in</B>
<P><B>her right leg. So, she went to the doctor's. It revealed a twisted
joint</B>
<P><B>but with very odd chracteristics. As usual, it was dismissed as a
mere</B>
<P><B>double-joint. </B>
<P><B>	Questioning my sister, she claimed that the figure had appeared
quite</B>
<P><B>earlier and bit her with great force on the very same location she
had</B>
<P><B>problems with. But she was only 2 at the time. So, even I would
dismiss</B>
<P><B>it as hallucination. But, I could never dismiss a first-hand
experience:</B>
<P><B>	</B>
<P><B>Unexplained #1</B>
<P><B>	I was 10 when I discovered that something odd and out-of-place was</B>
<P><B>going on in the house I lived all my life. I sleep by myself in one</B>
<P><B>room, upstairs whilst my 2 sisters slept in another next to mine. One</B>
<P><B>night, the bed began to shake violently in a full burst lasting 3</B>
<P><B>seconds. I jumped at this and ran to my sisters' room and tried to</B>
<P><B>rationalize the whole thing.</B>
<P><B>	Firstly, I took it as a ground tremor. In Malaysia!? No way! If it
was</B>
<P><B>a ground tremor, my sisters, who were wide awake at that time,
must've</B>
<P><B>felt it as well but they did not. Then I began to check out my room,</B>
<P><B>especially areas near my bed. I didn't sleep in my room that night
but</B>
<P><B>crept to my parent's room and slept there. </B>
<P><B>	In the morning, after a full explanation, my parents assumed that
I had</B>
<P><B>made it up. But this was to be proven untrue in my next story.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Unexplained #2</B>
<P><B>	Following the poltergeist incident, my second sister experienced</B>
<P><B>something I would never ever in my life dreamed of experiencing. The</B>
<P><B>following was told by my sister when she was 8 years of age.</B>
<P><B>	One afternoon, in broad daylight, she went upstairs to her room.
Before</B>
<P><B>she reached there, she claimed to see a black hazy figure of a
cat-sized</B>
<P><B>creature which looked something like a rat (she drew this apparition</B>
<P><B>just after the incident) with fangs and glaring eyes. It came from
under</B>
<P><B>my bed and chased her into her room, vanishing under her bed. My dad
and</B>
<P><B>I raced upstairs in reaction to her hysterical screams and saw her</B>
<P><B>standing on a chair mumbling, appeared to be shocked and pale. We</B>
<P><B>searched her room for this "creature" but with no luck. After that</B>
<P><B>apparition, my room was free from the poltergeist. Phew...</B>
<P>
<P><B>Explained Unexplained #3</B>
<P><B>	This first-hand experience happened to me about a year ago and is
still</B>
<P><B>vivid in my mind. At that time, I had just moved to Eastern Malaysia
and</B>
<P><B>was staying in my grandmother's second house. This house was actually</B>
<P><B>rented by people and aged back to World War 2 when the Japanese came
to</B>
<P><B>Malaysia and created havoc.</B>
<P><B>	At around 1 am one night, I came back late from my part-time job at
a</B>
<P><B>restaurant as usual. We had just moved to the "second" house and my
room</B>
<P><B>was near the back. I was tired and slept easily.</B>
<P><B>	Before the apparition came into view, I was half awakened by dogs</B>
<P><B>barking and the sound of muffled voices in my ears; much like the
sound</B>
<P><B>of 2 tape recorders played backwards. Then I opened my eyes to be</B>
<P><B>greeted by a floating head of a person; vivid yet transparent. Only
the</B>
<P><B>head, no body, nothing else. Just a head in mid-air. It stared at me
for</B>
<P><B>about 4 seconds with cold sweat running down my neck. I took in the</B>
<P><B>details of the sad, almost unanimated face at that time before it</B>
<P><B>suddenly vanished. Almost instantly, the dogs stopped barking and all</B>
<P><B>was silent again. I turned on my room lights and tried to rationalize</B>
<P><B>the whole thing but failed. I woke up the next morning in my</B>
<P><B>grandmother's room.</B>
<P><B>	I was 16 at the time and I didn't want to let the apparition become</B>
<P><B>another unsolved experience in my life. So, I asked around. My</B>
<P><B>grandmother said that the previous people who rented the house had
also</B>
<P><B>seen such apparitions but with different intensities. One tennant</B>
<P><B>claimed that he/she saw a ghostly body of a man but without a head</B>
<P><B>walking around the rooms. My new-found friends claimed that they have</B>
<P><B>been seeing weird things floating near the back of the house whilst
they</B>
<P><B>were playing outside. </B>
<P><B>	After telling all this to my parents, they had the house checked out
by</B>
<P><B>a spiritualist who was actually my very own second uncle. He said
that</B>
<P><B>the man I had just seen was chinese and was a sad ghost. The man was</B>
<P><B>beheaded by the Japanese communists during the war. The man's death
was</B>
<P><B>upon his own request. This was because his 6 month pregnant wife was
cut</B>
<P><B>open by the communists and was then executed without reason. He</B>
<P><B>apparently took with him his sorrow and grief. And he was not
properly</B>
<P><B>buried.</B>
<P><B>	Near my room, under a small tree lie the skull of a chinese man and</B>
<P><B>about 20 kilometers away lie his body in a cemetery. So, these facts</B>
<P><B>explained the apparitions. The head was searching for a matching body</B>
<P><B>and vice versa.</B>
<P><B>	Recently, we left the house and moved to another due to some other</B>
<P><B>paranormal activity which I will not discuss now. Maybe at a later
time,</B>
<P><B>I will. It's up to you to believe.</B>

</H3><P><B>by OBRIENR@mops.wl.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I can only tell you this story from second hand experience </B>
<P><B>because I was sleeping throughout the whole incident.  Nonetheless,
</B>
<P><B>according to both of my parents, it involves me.  </B>
<P><B>	Back when I was about four years old, my parents were sitting in </B>
<P><B>the family room watching T.V. when they heard the sound of someone
</B>
<P><B>running up the stairs.  Now the staircase is adjacent to the family
room.</B>
<P><B>At the time, the only thing separating the staircase and the family
room </B>
<P><B>was a railing.  So when they both looked over the railing to see who
was </B>
<P><B>coming up the stairs they saw me, in my pajamas, run up the stairs
and </B>
<P><B>around the corner into the kitchen.  </B>
<P><B>	Both my parents thought this to be a bit odd because not only was
</B>
<P><B>it past my bed time, but my action and expression seemed aimless. 
They </B>
<P><B>called out my name and asked me what I was doing in the kitchen, and
I </B>
<P><B>gave no answer.  Still puzzled, they both got up from their chairs
and </B>
<P><B>went into the kitchen to get me and put me back to bed.  When they
got </B>
<P><B>into the kitchen and turned on the light they expected to see me standing
</B>
<P><B>there, but I was nowhere in sight.  They looked under the table to
see if </B>
<P><B>I was hiding from them but still I was nowhere to be found.  When they
</B>
<P><B>went back down stairs, into my bedroom, they found me lying in my bed
</B>
<P><B>fast asleep.  </B>
<P><B>	If this seems a bit sketchy to you, let me present some </B>
<P><B>interesting facts.  Number one, I was terrified of the dark.  As a
child </B>
<P><B>I always slept with a light on.  I would never have run into a dark
room.</B>
<P><B>Number two there is only one staircase in our entire home.  I would
have </B>
<P><B>had no way to get back down stairs unless I passed the family room,
where </B>
<P><B>my parents were.  Thirdly there was no reason to go into the kitchen.
 </B>
<P><B>When I was a kid I wasn't allowed to get my own food from the kitchen,
</B>
<P><B>and I was the most sickeningly obedient kid you could have ever met.
 I </B>
<P><B>would never have tried to sneak food from the kitchen, and I would
never </B>
<P><B>have played a game like this with my parents, regardless of the odd
hour </B>
<P><B>of the night. Finally, you can only accuse one of my parents of tripping
</B>
<P><B>out and seeing something wierd like this.  What is the likelihood that
</B>
<P><B>both my parents could see the exact same thing, even though neither
one </B>
<P><B>was on anything.</B>
<P><B>	Anyway, my theory is that either myself or one of my parents may </B>
<P><B>have created an image of me running up the stairs and into the kitchen.
 </B>
<P><B>While this may sound rediculous, there have been many stories like
mine </B>
<P><B>told before.  To tell you the truth;  if this hadn't happened to my
</B>
<P><B>family, I doubt that I would believe that stuff like this could </B>
<P><B>actually happen.  Now I know that it does.</B>

<H3><A NAME="mr brown">Mr. Brown</A>
</H3><P><B>by lakespeed@viponline.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>In 1983 after i got married,my wife and i bought a house. It wasn't
an</B>
<P><B>old house it was only 7years old at the time. We bought the</B>
<P><B>house,located in west Ky from an aging couple,she had terminal lung</B>
<P><B>cancer and wanted to spend her last years up north with her children
and</B>
<P><B>friends. The old man loved the house and area,i only meet him a couple
</B>
<P><B>of times,but he told me he hated to leave.</B>
<P><B>Now both of these people where heavy smokers and we had alot of work</B>
<P><B>ahead of us for such a recently built
home,paint,carpet,wallpaper,ect.</B>
<P><B>And spent the first year pouring our hearts out into this home. my
wife</B>
<P><B>is always spooky,and doesn't like being alone and wont answer the
door</B>
<P><B>if shes home alone,so i keep a handgun stored away,and always check
out </B>
<P><B>rooms and noises for her,it became commonplace.</B>
<P><B>Well after three years of not ever having anything occur,other than</B>
<P><B>maybe some nieborhood cats making noises at night. I came home from
work</B>
<P><B>day to an empty house,as i walked into the den i definatly saw a man</B>
<P><B>dressed in overalls walk into our bedroom. I got my revolver from its</B>
<P><B>hiding spot and checked it to make shure it was loaded and proceeded</B>
<P><B>into the bedroom. When i arrived know one was there,with no way out
of</B>
<P><B>the back of the house except passing me,i searched everywhere under
beds</B>
<P><B>windows</B>
<P><B>(locked with screens atached) closests,nothing. I quickly chalked
this</B>
<P><B>up to imagination,though i have never had it happen to me before,and
the</B>
<P><B>last thing i was going to do was tell my skitish wife.</B>
<P><B>So about a week or so later, i awake in the middle of the night and
see</B>
<P><B>the same figure standing in the corner of the room, i didn't feel
scared</B>
<P><B>or thretened. I rubbed my eyes and he was still there,the corner was</B>
<P><B>empty but it was if he were in front of a desk or dresser doing</B>
<P><B>somthing. I finnally desided to wake my wife and when she finnally
arose</B>
<P><B>groggy from her sleep he was gone. Of course i didn't tell her what
i</B>
<P><B>had seen,we would have been moving the next day.</B>
<P><B>Ten days or so passed and i was working out in the yard and a neibor</B>
<P><B>that walks the subdivision stoped to chat and said. Well mister Brown</B>
<P><B>finally passed away, i said whos mister brown? She replied he's the</B>
<P><B>sweet old man you bought your house from,you know the one that always</B>
<P><B>wore overalls every day of his life, you know i talked to him just
a few</B>
<P><B>months ago after his wife passed away and told him how nice you and
your</B>
<P><B>wife had fixed up the house and where taking great care of it!</B>
<P><B>She said that he missed it so bad and now that his wife was gone he</B>
<P><B>wished more than anything that he was back here,he loved it here.</B>
<P><B> Well i didn't tell her of seeing him come to make his last rounds
and i</B>
<P><B>never saw Mr Brown again. I was a sceptic before and i sometimes
still</B>
<P><B>find stories hard to believe,but this i saw with my own eyes and am
glad</B>
<P><B>that i was able to explane what once was unexplanable.</B>

<H3><A NAME="the church">The Church</A>
</H3><P><B>by &nbsp;robman@netrail.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I live in Virginia, just outside of Washington, DC.  There's a church
in</B>
<P><B>Potomoc, Maryland, which is about a half hour drive away.  It's just</B>
<P><B>down the street from my ex-girlfriend's house.</B>
<P><B>One night, a friend of mine and I were driving around, just doing</B>
<P><B>talking and stuff, and we ended up in Maryland, and there was a</B>
<P><B>restaurant I wanted to go eat at.  On our way to the restaurant, we</B>
<P><B>drove by the aformentioned church.  It was around 2 in the morning.</B>
<P><B>Right as soon as we passed the church, I pulled my car over to the
side</B>
<P><B>of the road, and both my friend and I looked at each other and asked</B>
<P><B>each other if we felt a cold feeling as we passed the church.</B>
<P><B>It was winter time, but I had the heat on in my car, and if anything,</B>
<P><B>both my friend and I were very hot inside my car, but for some
reason,</B>
<P><B>we both got incredibly cold the moment we passed that church.</B>
<P><B>To test it out, we went back a week later, and we experienced the
same</B>
<P><B>feeling.  We went back at different times of day, and no matter what</B>
<P><B>time, if it was 2 in the afternoon or 2 in the morning, it was always</B>
<P><B>the same feeling.</B>
<P><B>My ex-girlfriend told me about something that happened right near the</B>
<P><B>church.  When you're driving on the road that the church is on,
there's</B>
<P><B>a bunch of trees, kind of a mini-forest, that go back a little ways.
</B>
<P><B>Supposedly, about 6 or 7 years ago, sometime around the beginning of</B>
<P><B>this decade, two girls were found murdered in those woods.  I've
never</B>
<P><B>had a chance to check this out for certain, but it's something I've
been</B>
<P><B>meaning to do for awhile.</B>
<P><B>Something else that's somewhat odd, is that every single person I've</B>
<P><B>been to that area with, I don't keep in contact with.  My
ex-girlfriend</B>
<P><B>and I had a pretty bad breakup, and we didn't quite work out as friends.
</B>
<P><B>The friend I mentioned and I started to get in a lot of fights over</B>
<P><B>things, and we no longer have any contact with each other.</B>
<P><B>Another person who went to the church with me was the aformentioned</B>
<P><B>friend's ex-girlfriend.  We spent a lot of time together, and she's
a</B>
<P><B>photographer, and was interested in taking pictures of the church.
 One</B>
<P><B>night we braved the chilling feeling and parked in the church and
used</B>
<P><B>two rolls of film on pictures of the church and the surrounding area.
</B>
<P><B>She developed her own film, and has never had any of her film go bad,</B>
<P><B>but not a single one of the 48 pictures we took turned out.  As for
my</B>
<P><B>relationship with her, she went back to her ex-boyfriend when she
found</B>
<P><B>out I had feeling for her, and basically left me with a broken heart.</B>
<P><B>I've never been to the church by myself, and it's something I'm
planning</B>
<P><B>on doing very soon.</B>

<H3><A NAME="my father">My Father, Pete</A>
</H3><P><B>by &nbsp;whistler@indy.net</B>
<P>
<P>     <B>My father was a tough minded no frills man, wgo led a spartan
life </B>
<P><B>in his small house on the New Jersey coast, never spending an unnecessary
</B>
<P><B>penny.  A coal miner's son from eastern Pennsylvania, and one of eight
</B>
<P><B>children, he was a product of the great depression of the thirties.
 He </B>
<P><B>was kind and generous to everyone but himself.  I might have known
that </B>
<P><B>he could make it back from anywhere.  Even death.</B>
<P>
<P><B>     In early October of 1992 my sister called at my home in Indiana
with </B>
<P><B>the news that Dad had had a massive heart attack.  She found him in
his </B>
<P><B>home in great pain.  After much pleading from her he went to the hospital
</B>
<P><B>in Bricktown.  I flew in that evening and was able to see him in the
</B>
<P><B>intensive care ward in the morning.</B>
<P>
<P><B>     I told him that when he came out of the hospital he would come
to </B>
<P><B>Indiana with me to recover.  He looked at me and said, "Mike, I'm not
</B>
<P><B>going to make it out of here alive.  I can feel it coming."  He laughed
</B>
<P><B>and said, "We'll be together soon enough.  Life is short.  I'll be
</B>
<P><B>waiting for you when you pass over, and I'll be watching you in the
</B>
<P><B>meantime."  Two days later he died.</B>
<P>
<P><B>     My sister wanted me to stay with her, but I needed to be alone
with </B>
<P><B>my grief, so I stayed in Dad's home the night that he died.  It was
a </B>
<P><B>small home in a subdivision where only retirees live.  The house was
full </B>
<P><B>of Dad's unique personality.  A little desk nameplate from his office
</B>
<P><B>jokingly given by his friends which said "CHEAP PETE."  A weding
portrait</B>
<P><B>of my grandparents in a guilded oval frame.  The food still in the
</B>
<P><B>refrigerator.  Underwear that he had washed out hanging from the shower
</B>
<P><B>head.  Pictures of all of us that he loved.  The TV guide open to the
</B>
<P><B>listings of the night of his heart attack.  And I couldn't shake the
</B>
<P><B>feeling that I had always unconciously associated with his presence.
 I </B>
<P><B>told myself that it was only my immagination.  That I missed him.</B>
<P>
<P><B>     Sick with grief I sat up and watched a movie, then tried to read.
 </B>
<P><B>Around three AM I was overcome with exhaustion and shut all of the
lights </B>
<P><B>off.  I laid down on Dad's bed and began to pray in the dark for his
</B>
<P><B>soul.  Suddenly I heard a click and light flooded into the room from
the </B>
<P><B>hall.  The hairs stood up on the back of my neck.  I jumped out of
bed to </B>
<P><B>confront the intruder that I knew must be in the house with me.  I
</B>
<P><B>grabbed a cordless phone as a weapon and stepped into the hall and
felt </B>
<P><B>my fathers presence powerfully.  And I felt sadness.  I could feel
very </B>
<P><B>tangibly that he was sorry for me.  I knew that there was no one in
the </B>
<P><B>house but us, but I checked the door locks anyway which were secure.
 The </B>
<P><B>light in the bathroom had come on.  The switch was the older type which
</B>
<P><B>had a positive click.  I had just shut it off minutes before.  I said
</B>
<P><B>aloud, "I love you Dad, thanks for the message."</B>
<P>
<P><B>     I still feel him sometimes when I least expect to.  He was there
</B>
<P><B>recently when I took a picture of my son Michael.  About a year ago
I </B>
<P><B>dreamed of him, and later learned that my brother Pete had and almost
</B>
<P><B>identical dream on the same night.  I believe that he's keeping his
word </B>
<P><B>as he always did.  I feel him most strongly occasionally as I'm dozing
</B>
<P><B>off to sleep.  At those times it's as though he's sitting right beside
</B>
<P><B>me.  I learned many things from my father.  The last thing that he
taught </B>
<P><B>me was that there is a bond, the glue of which is love, and that it
</B>
<P><B>transcends death.  And that death is nothing to fear at all.</B>

<P>                               <B>My name is Amanda, i'm 13 and live in
Maryland. When I was</B>
<P><B>about 11 yrs. i saw a ghost. It all started one night when I got a
strange</B>
<P><B>sickness. I was lying on the top bed on my bunk bed sleeping. Then
I heard</B>
<P><B>something and I woke up(so origanal). Then all the sudden I saw a
black</B>
<P><B>ghostly figuree standing at the bottom of my bunk bed. At first I thoght
I</B>
<P><B>was halucinatiing, but I have very good eye sight in the dark. I told
it to</B>
<P><B>go away and it left.</B>
<P><B>               The next day at school I told my best friend Tonya
about</B>
<P><B>what happened and she didn't believe me. That weekened I had her stay
with</B>
<P><B>me to prove I wasn't lying. That night she woke me up crying. I got
up and</B>
<P><B>asked her what was wrong. She said she saw a female ghost with long
red</B>
<P><B>hair standing at the end of my bed.  </B>
<P><B>                I connected these sightings to a ring(it was the
freakest</B>
<P><B>thing you ever saw) my mom gave me the night i saw the ghost. It wasn't
a</B>
<P><B>present she just gave it to me. I showed her the ring the next day
and we</B>
<P><B>went in the woods to the creek and threw it in. Tonya and I haven't
seen</B>
<P><B>anything paranormal since. The only time they appered was 2 times.
One w/</B>
<P><B>her and the first w/ me.</B>
<P><B>                 I don't know what Isaw and I'm not sure what i saw
but i</B>
<P><B>believe they were something out of the ordinary. </B>

<H3><A NAME=copycat>Copycat</A>
</H3><P><B>by jcol@wt.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>During my life I've experienced several times, in different houses
yet,</B>
<P><B>something I shall call a copycat. I don't think ghost is an accurate</B>
<P><B>term, since those whose forms are copied are alive and well, nor do
I</B>
<P><B>think of it as some form of astral or mental projection, as they are</B>
<P><B>usually awake and active in the next room.</B>
<P><B>   But on to the experiences.. my first as such was when I was about
6</B>
<P><B>years old.. this house was exceedingly haunted anyway, though I don't</B>
<P><B>remember much about what went on there. I lived there from around 3
to</B>
<P><B>about 8 and though we now live not very far from it, I'm 22 and most
of</B>
<P><B>the paranormal stuff there only survives in the tales of my mom. </B>
<P><B>But I do remember this.. we had a garage accessible from our living</B>
<P><B>room, and that had a spare room inside it for some odd reason, that
was</B>
<P><B>frequently used as a playroom by my brother and I. Well, one day I
went</B>
<P><B>out to that room by myself. I got to about the middle of the room and</B>
<P><B>suddenly before me appeared a transparent humanoid figure. I couldn't</B>
<P><B>make out any details below the neck but atop it sat the grinning
heads</B>
<P><B>of both my brother and myself, faces clearly detailed but equally</B>
<P><B>transparent. The heads flopped right to left, phasing straight
through</B>
<P><B>eachother without contact and continuing to grin at me. It seems
amusing</B>
<P><B>as I think about it now, though I still shiver at the strangeness of
it.</B>
<P><B>At the time it was the most terrifying experience I could have
imagined.</B>
<P><B>I backed up slowly as it floated about half an inch off the ground</B>
<P><B>toward me until I hit a small window A/C unit behind me and sat down</B>
<P><B>hard on the floor, when it just as suddenly vanished. Needless to say
I</B>
<P><B>ran back inside immediately, and never felt comfortable going in the</B>
<P><B>garage alone anymore.</B>
<P><B>I've got lots more such experiences to share, and would be interested
to</B>
<P><B>know if anyone else has dealt with a copycat.</B>
