      <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">In the
last few years the internet has become saturated with people who have
started investigation groups.&nbsp; Whether this is because of the boom
it has
seen on TV, or whether activity has increased it is hard to say.&nbsp;
Regardless of the reasons why, here are a few things for the people
seeking
help and the ones attempting to give it to remember. </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">For the people
seeking help&#8230;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Documentation is great.&nbsp; If you have activity going on in your
home,
record it.&nbsp; Buy a diary, keep a notebook, keep a log on your
computer,
have a camera ready, have a video camera set up and ready to go, leave
an audio
recorder in the room with the activity.&nbsp; Any one of these can help
you
determine whether you need to call someone to come to your home.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You
don't need to buy a bunch of equipment to determine whether you have
activity
in your home, just being observant and noting things can help do this
for
you.&nbsp; If you are experiencing a shadow at the same time every
night take
notice.&nbsp; If you are hearing something strange but cannot pinpoint
its
origin, write it down.&nbsp; If you feel a breeze blowing through your
home,
but there isn't a source you can locate, make a note.&nbsp; If the
overall
general mood of your home makes you uneasy, make an entry on your
computer.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You
can do research into your home and the property it is built on.&nbsp;
First
start with the internet.&nbsp; Most cities now have a crime map that
tells of
happenings by zip code or even by street names.&nbsp; I would start
with
that.&nbsp; Perhaps a major crime such as a murder took place in your
neighborhood on even on your property before the building was created,
that may
cause the activity that is occurring now.&nbsp; Going to the court
house, or
place in your city where property records are kept can be of help as
well.&nbsp;
Getting the names off the land title can lead you to a tragic love
affair, a
spy ring, a vice presidents home, or an unsolved crime.&nbsp; The
possibilities
are endless.&nbsp; If the land title leads to nothing, try the
newspapers to
see if they have anything in their archives.&nbsp; Also speak to
neighbors who
have been around a long time. Perhaps a rumor from 40 years ago can
lead you to
why your home is possibly haunted now. Remember that the land is as old
as
time, if you don't find anything, that doesn't mean your house is not
haunted.&nbsp; Something may have occurred before records.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Something you own may also be related to the haunting.&nbsp; Perhaps a
family
heirloom, an antique, or a piece of second hand furniture or piece of
jewelry..&nbsp; Not all old things have ghosts, and not all ghosts
belong to
old things either.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Do
not resort to activities that may make the situation worse.&nbsp; Ouija
boards,
s&eacute;ances, automatic writing, anything that challenges a spirit to
make itself
known when you are not trained to handle the outcome can be
disastrous.&nbsp;
It can make a relatively calm haunting turn into a hurtful, mean, and
disgruntled haunting that will make everyone in the house miserable.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Research a group thoroughly!&nbsp; I cannot stress this enough.&nbsp;
You
wouldn't buy a car without looking it over, you wouldn't go to a doctor
who had
only been in med school for 6 months, why let a stranger into your home
without
checking them out first?&nbsp; I am not just talking about the
internet.&nbsp;
The internet is filled with lies and misleading statements.&nbsp; Get
word of
mouth and recommendations from family, friends, workmates, on the group
you are
asking into your home.&nbsp; Newer groups may need more experience,
check how
long they have been around.&nbsp; Older groups may have become
complacent or
close minded to new thoughts.&nbsp; Also keep in mind that just because
they
may be a member of a known paranormal family does not automatically
make them
the group for you.&nbsp; Religion, personality, reputation, and an
overall
feeling that you receive from them will help determine whether they are
going
to be able to help you.&nbsp; A good group will always put the clients'
needs
first.&nbsp; Try to arrange a meeting with them before inviting them
into your
home.&nbsp; This is crucial.&nbsp; A smiling face on their website does
not
mean that they do not have ulterior motives to get into your home or
that they
have your best interests in mind. A website here today, might be gone
tomorrow
leaving no trace, I have seen it happen.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The
size of the group does not exact quality.&nbsp; A group of twenty
people does
not necessarily mean they are experienced or have any field training.
On the
same note, a group of 2 may not have the man power to cover all the hot
spots
or equipment in your home.&nbsp; Again research into the background of
a group
is key here.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After you have made a decision to invite a group to your home, I would
suggest
that you pick a night where you know you won't be overly tired after a
long day
at work or just home from a trip. Try to arrange for it to be as normal
night
in your life as possible. Also try to pick a night where you think you
will be
comfortable, not rushed due to a busy day the next day.&nbsp; A change
in your
normal day will make the atmosphere in your home change and may cause
the activity
to slow or even to stop. Nights are preferable for most investigation
groups.
However if you notice the activity occurs more during the day, do not
hesitate
to arrange for a daytime investigation. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If
entirely possible arrange for sleepovers for the children in your
home.&nbsp;
Investigators do not want to frighten the children by something they
say or
do.&nbsp; Most children are scared by what is happening and a bunch of
strangers coming into their home at bedtime and possibly through their
bedrooms,
might make them even more uneasy.&nbsp; Or find a group that is
experienced
with how to explain to children about ghosts..&nbsp; This is crucial as
the
last thing you want after an investigation group leaves is to have a
child up
all night scared to go to sleep.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">10)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pets
should be kept to one area away from the rooms with the most activity
if
possible, while the investigators are in your home.&nbsp; False
positives on
any of the equipment pieces due to animals running through the room are
something you and the investigators do not want. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">11)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If at
any time during the contacting of the investigators or the
investigation, or
afterward, the investigators ask for money for services, drop them and
contact
another group. Just tell them that there are too many groups out there
that do
not charge and you will be contacting one of those.&nbsp; Any group who
asks
for money are generally going to tell you what you want to hear because
you are
paying them for that service, not for solid proof that activity exists
in your home.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">12)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Try not
to talk too much about investigators coming to your house to search for
the
paranormal in the house.&nbsp; Ghosts can hear you and this may change
the
activity.&nbsp; They may be just as scared of being found out as you
are to
have them there and the activity will just stop.&nbsp; Or in other
situations,
the clients report activity increased tremendously until the
investigators
arrived at the door and then it just stopped.&nbsp; This happens!
Please do not
feel embarrassed, it does not mean that the investigators will not
believe
you.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">13)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One or
two investigators may ask for a walk through and a description of the
activity
by room, or ask you to show them of any new or noteworthy activity
since you
last spoke..&nbsp; Knowing what is happening and where in the home
avoids any
surprises later.&nbsp; It also helps to point out things such as
squeaky floor
boards, or a door that will not stay shut.&nbsp; Video of a door coming
open on
its own would be great, until we find out that the door won't stay shut
due to
a construction defect.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">14)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My group
will also explain the equipment we use in your home.&nbsp; This helps
you to
understand any readings or findings we may get.&nbsp; Ask
questions.&nbsp; If
you are curious about anything ask, we are more than happy to explain.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">15)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you
can keep notes a few days before the investigators arrive.&nbsp; This
will help
you to point out any new activity and may also help pin point a pattern
of
phenomenon, such as the light only comes on in the hallway when you are
in the
kitchen at 10 pm.&nbsp; This will be great help to the paranormal
investigators
to recreate the variables that might make the activity reoccur.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">16)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
During
an investigation what my group will do is ask if you would like to move
from
room to room about the house with us. This does not mean that you have
to
follow the investigators if you do not want to.&nbsp; We do this for
your
comfort.&nbsp; If you are uncomfortable with a group or they will not
let you
into a room with them, find out why. This is your home and if you feel
like
being there to observe you should be allowed to.&nbsp; Remember though
that
group is there to conduct an investigation so we may ask you to not
whisper or
talk but just observe. Another set of eyes is always welcome, however
whispering can lead to false positives which neither you nor the
investigation
group wants.&nbsp; If you witness something, try not to get excited or
raise
your voice. Your excited voice may not sound like your everyday voice
and may
make us question the audio later.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">17)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If there
are items in the house that are special to you, please make the
investigators
aware of them.&nbsp; With cords and equipment being moved, we would be
as
devastated as you would to break a valuable. If at all possible put the
items
out of the way.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">18)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nothing
may happen right away in the home. Again this is normal. Spirits are
for the
most part shy and while they may be used to you, they are not
accustomed to the
stranger standing in your home talking about a temperature gun or EMF
detector.&nbsp; Be prepared, it may take some time before the
paranormal
activity begins.&nbsp; Possible even more than one or two
investigations will
have to happen before the activity occurs while the investigators are
there.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">19)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In most
cases the investigators might give you an idea of their findings before
they
pack up their equipment, it will just be a general idea until we
analyze the
evidence.&nbsp; Some groups do this and some do not.&nbsp; Keep in mind
that
our statements may change as we view the evidence.&nbsp; Nothing is set
in
stone as this is an ever evolving, ever changing science. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">20)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As
clients you should know that just because we may not find anything
during our
investigation does not mean in any way that there is or is not activity
in your
home.&nbsp; We can only present our evidence to you.&nbsp; It is
ultimately up
to you to decide based on everything involved whether you think you
have
paranormal activity. As investigators our evidence is circumstantial
and just
too many variables are involved to be able to tell anyone without a
doubt that
there is or is not activity in your home.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">21)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Please
give the investigators time to analyze the evidence collected.&nbsp;
Most
groups have many video cameras, many digital cameras, many audio
recorders and
many logs and to go through hours of these pieces of equipment and then
go back
with the positive evidence and compare it with all the aspects to
eliminate any
false positives takes time. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">22)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When the
evidence is presented to you and you have questions, please ask.&nbsp;
This is
your house that is being discussed. We would rather you ask and
understand the
evidence presented, then to always have doubts or questions about what
we
believe to be evidence.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">23)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you
are uncomfortable and would like another investigation, tell the
group.&nbsp;
Most groups will be more than happy to come back to your home.&nbsp;
Good
groups are not only there for the science but mostly for the client and
the
clients well being and level of comfort in their homes.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">24)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Try
not to base what you are experiencing on what you see on
television.&nbsp;
Most of what you see has been edited from
hours of footage and only the best activity taken from that
footage.&nbsp;
Don&#8217;t let this stop you from picking up the
phone and calling for help, or emailing a local investigation group in
your
area and asking questions.&nbsp; The groups on
TV have to keep their shows exciting for ratings sake and often have to
do what
the producers tell them to do.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Investigation groups should try to remember these things&#8230; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">1) When starting a
group, remember that the best place
to start is not a private home without experience.&nbsp; Going into a
private
home that is not family or friends as one of your first investigations
can be
harmful to not only your group but also your clients.&nbsp; Friends and
family
might understand if something goes wrong, but as a group you should
start at a
public accessed haunted locale to learn how to work as a group. To
learn who
best works the different pieces of equipment, who interacts best with
the
clients, who works best at filling out forms and activity logs, or who
best to
set up and break down an investigation.&nbsp; The last thing a group
wants to
present is disorganization or even arguing while on an
investigation.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">2) Always check with
an owner of a property to get
permission to enter a haunted location.&nbsp; Even if it is a cemetery
that
does not have hours posted, it is best to contact the cemetery owner to
ask if
you can have access after dark.&nbsp; Too many people have been
arrested for
not asking permission because they have seen the location listed on
some
website and forgot to follow this basic of rules.&nbsp; A listing does
not
grant permission, just says that someone somewhere has felt that the
area might
possibly be haunted.&nbsp; Permission from the owner will go a long way
when a
policeman is asking you why you are in an abandoned building after
dark.&nbsp;
Written permission or a cell phone number of the owner might keep you
out of a
jail cell.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">3)Self advertising
and word of mouth is going to be
the best way to get your name out there, so remember to conduct
yourself
appropriately. Put logos or names on your shirts, jackets or hats, but
remember
people are watching you. If in a public suspected haunted location, do
not use
bad language, drink alcohol, smoke, or roughhouse.&nbsp; A potential
client may
not remember your first name but they will remember your logo and your
actions.&nbsp; If you conduct yourself in a profession manner, you will
be
remembered. </p>
&lt; style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"&gt;4)&nbsp; You
do not need to get all the most updated
equipment to form a group or go out to get field experience. A
notebook, and a
flashlight, is what a lot of people started with.&nbsp; Fancy cameras,
recorders, or emf detectors will come in time. Learn the basics first
and then
you can concentrate on the equipment that comes with more in-depth
investigations.<br>
&nbsp;
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">5) You don't have to
lie about how long you have been
a group to get your name out there.&nbsp; If you conduct yourself with
respect
to the afterlife, respect to the clients, respect to your surroundings
and
respect to yourselves, you will get noticed and you will get
contacted.&nbsp;
Too many individuals and groups have decided that tacking on years of
investigating is a good thing. I can't tell you the number of times I
have been
asked to add a link of a new group, then when I revisit the group a few
month
later, suddenly the time they have been investigating has jumped by
years or
even decades.&nbsp; Keep in mind that there is always a trail and if
you begin
by lying about how long you have been investigating someone always
knows the
truth. If you are willing to lie about that, how can you be trusted
with
evidence or in someone's home? Trust is earned.&nbsp; Do yourself and
your
clients a favor and start out right by telling the truth.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">6) Surround yourself
with people who are willing to
work with you to make your group grow.&nbsp; Many times when a group
has worked
together for a while they become complacent and start to rely on the
friendship
rather than what brought you together in the first place.&nbsp; It is
then the
director's place to step up and get the group back to functioning and
going in
the right direction.&nbsp; Your group is only as good as the people who
are
willing to work to make it so.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">7) The best skill a
new group can learn is to work
with each other and balance your skills off of one another.&nbsp;
Learning how
to voice to each other what you are feeling is a great group builder.
But I
personally feel that the best thing a group can learn is to trust each
other.&nbsp; Ghost investigations can be dangerous sometimes and
learning to trust
the feelings of your group and know without a doubt that you have each
other's
back in any situation.&nbsp; </p>
&lt; style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"&gt;8) Get
yourself a free website.&nbsp; A website even
with just your contact information will bring in clients searching for
a group
in your area.&nbsp; A basic website with some of the things you do
while in a
clients home will bring in even more clients.<span
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span>&lt;
style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"&gt;<br>
      <br>
9) Respect the afterlife.&nbsp; Remember the dead were
once living people and retain all the same personality traits and
emotions as
they had in life.&nbsp; If you go out to antagonize, provoke, or
disrespect the
afterlife you can expect repercussions.&nbsp; To want to do this for
any reason
means you are absolutely in the wrong field.&nbsp; My best advice is to
act
like you are in your grandma's house.&nbsp; If you treat any possible
spirit
you are trying to investigate with respect, you will get respect back
thus
yielding better evidence.&nbsp;
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">10) Learn to protect
yourself and your group before
during and after an investigation.&nbsp; This can mean an opening and
closing
prayer, or anything that your group believes in.&nbsp; For example my
group
uses a prayer before going into a cemetery, a clients house, or a known
haunted
location but we also use a white light technique that makes us feel
more
protected.&nbsp; Whenever we feel a little uncomfortable in any
location we
will also use prayer.&nbsp; You can do anything that makes you feel
comfortable.&nbsp; Even a group pep talk will help. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">11) Know your
surroundings.&nbsp; If you walk through
a cemetery during the day before the nights ghost hunt, you will get to
know
the terrain and possibly where spots are that you feel may get active
later.&nbsp; Back to the protection aspect of your surroundings, I
carry a
snake bite kit in my bag along with a First Aid Kit.&nbsp; I know that
there
are snakes in the places my group and I go and I prepare for that
circumstance.&nbsp; In my bag I also carry pepper spray for a couple
reasons.&nbsp; We have been on a case in a neighborhood that most
police would
not venture at night. Also wild animals in the middle of nowhere are
just as affected
by pepper spray as wild animals in the worst part of town.&nbsp; Be
aware of
not only natural noises but people around you as well. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">12) Take notice of
everything.&nbsp; A simple chill or
goose bumps could mean that the temperature has changed around you
indicating a
spirit, or it could just possibly be wind.&nbsp; Before you head out to
a
location in the open, you should listen to the weather report.&nbsp;
Make note
of the expected temperature, wind speed, any anticipated precipitation.
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;13) Volunteer
your time.&nbsp; Taking a couple hours
out of the month to clean a cemetery, repair fences, rake leaves, or
picking up
trash is a great way to get yourself and your group noticed.&nbsp;
Contact the
owners of the cemetery, abandoned property, foreclosed house or
anything
reported to be haunted and see if you can do anything for the owner to
help
clean it up during the day.&nbsp; Establish yourself with a good
reputation and
then see if you can investigate the property at night.&nbsp; A little
hard work
and some elbow grease can yield some great rewards.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">14) Dave and his
group have suggested joining a
Historical Society.&nbsp; Just letting the local Historical Society
know you
and your group exist is a great way to get into properties that may not
be
available to anyone. </p>
      <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span>&lt;
style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"&gt;<br>
15) If you are just in this for the thrill or chills,
please do not go into private homes.&nbsp; Stick to the public
locations, you
can really cause harm to private citizens by going into their homes
just for
the scare when they are expecting help and understanding in their
situations.
Every home haunting is different and felt differently by the home
owners.&nbsp;
I have known clients on the verge of abandoning their homes, or even
divorcing
because of the stress the activity has caused them and their
families.&nbsp; A
thrill group is best left for ghost tours and walks.&nbsp; You should
have some
level of paranormal training and know how to help clients in a haunted
home
before turning on a video camera and going into a strangers home. Not
only is
it dangerous to the client but also to you as the investigator. Without
training you do not know how to protect yourself or your group.<span
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span>&lt;
style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"&gt;<br>
      <br>
16) Keep in mind that you can go to the most haunted
location in the world and never pick up activity.&nbsp; This can be
caused by a
few different reasons.&nbsp; A) The spirits do not want to interact
with you.
Do not take this personally.&nbsp; Every spirit has their own
personality, just
like we do. The spirit in the location may only want to talk to someone
in
their age bracket, who knows how to play cards, who has a great smile,
red
hair, the list goes on and on.&nbsp;&nbsp; B) Or they just may not want
to
interact that day/night with anyone. It happens more often than not. C)
Or it
may be a residual haunting and the conditions are just not right to
produce the
activity. D) Any of the above or more.&nbsp; There are just too many
reasons to
list why a spirit does not want to interact, but do not use this as an
excuse
to antagonize, threaten or bully a spirit.&nbsp; These actions have
become the
norm on some reality shows but can get the novice investigator into
real trouble.&nbsp;
Spirits are just people without bodies and can get just as angry as
anyone you
yell at or call names.&nbsp; The old saying comes to mind, you'll catch
more
flies with honey than vinegar. It just means that you will get a bigger
reaction by trying to find something the spirit is interested in and
being
nice, then trying to make the ghost mad.&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;

17) Meet the clients at a neutral&nbsp;place before
going into their home if possible.&nbsp; Again this is a safety
issue.&nbsp; We
call it a preliminary meeting.&nbsp; It allows the client to get to
know you a
bit and you get to know them.&nbsp; The clients want to be assured that
you
aren't out to have some fun at their expense and you need to know that
you are
not walking into their environment under unsafe conditions.&nbsp; Try
to meet
at least the afternoon prior to going to into their home. This gives
the
clients a chance to talk after meeting you and to back out if they so
desire.&nbsp; You want them to feel as comfortable as possible at the
investigation.&nbsp; &lt; style="font-family:
helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"&gt;<br>
      <br>
18) Try to explain step by step what you are going to
do while in a clients home.&nbsp; This helps to alleviate some of their
concerns
that you are there to help them, and some of the clients curiosity as
well.&nbsp; This is most likely the first time they are letting someone
into
their private world of activity, so letting them know how you do things
will
definitely help them to understand that you are serious in what you are
going
to do.

      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">19) Listen.&nbsp;
Just listening to a clients concerns
and experiences that they have had with the afterlife will help
them.&nbsp;
Many times they have kept all activity a secret and now that they have
found
someone to talk to about what they are going through is a huge relief.
Try to
be understanding of the clients circumstances, compassion is the key
here. If
you smirk or laugh out loud by an experience the client is relating to
you, it
can make the client distrust you and it is very disrespectful. They are
confiding in you and looking for answers. Conduct yourself as you would
a
friend telling you a secret.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">20) Sometimes it
helps to tell the client a little
background of your own experiences with the afterlife.&nbsp; I make it
a point
to always tell how I got interested in ghosts and how it has led me to
investigations.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just knowing that you have had experiences
with
ghosts will help a client open up more of what they are experiencing.
But
remember you are there to hear about their haunting, do not make it all
about
you and your experiences, give them a little background and if they
have
questions they will ask. In fact encourage them often to ask questions
or ask
them if they experienced anything like what you have while telling your
story,
it may help the client open up more to you. Going into an investigation
with as
much knowledge as possible will help you in your investigation. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">21) When entering
into a clients home do not make a
big deal if the house is messy.&nbsp; Many times a client has been
embarrassed
by a load of laundry on the bed, or a layer of dust on the
cabinet.&nbsp;
Clients are real people and we all have messes at one time or another
in our
own homes.&nbsp; We make it a point to tell the clients at our
preliminary
meeting not to do a clean up before we get to their home.&nbsp; We are
there to
investigate a haunting, not inspect housekeeping techniques.&nbsp;
Again though
be aware of your surroundings.&nbsp; We once walked into a house of a
hoarder.&nbsp; It was dangerous not only to the client but to our
team.&nbsp;
We had to respectfully decline the investigation due to tunnels through
household items to get from one end of the house to the other.
Sometimes even a
preliminary meeting will not warn you of these types of situations. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">22) Here is a big one
that is a personal peeve of
mine.&nbsp; Do not ask for money! Before, during, or after an
investigation do
not ask for money for services, gas, lodging, evidence or
cleansing.&nbsp; Most
of the good investigators come into this field because they have had
experiences of their own and want to learn more about the supernatural
or help
others.&nbsp; They are not in the field for fame or fortune.&nbsp; I
have said
this before, but the same questions that are being asked now about
ghosts have
been asked for 100's of years. The same evidence is still being
collected about
a science that has yet to be proven or explained to the point of being
believed
by everyone.&nbsp; This evidence is circumstantial at best and can be
dismantled by the most persistent skeptic and there are lots of those
skeptics
out there.&nbsp; So charging a fee for evidence or a service that
includes
taking a few photos, walking through a house, and talking into a
recorder is
ridiculous.&nbsp; Most clients at the end of an investigation will
offer some
sort of pay to the investigators. Turn it down unless you have said
from the
beginning that you take donations.&nbsp; Do not extend your hand first
though.
Let the client offer it.&nbsp; And do not take more than the client can
afford.&nbsp; We have been in a house where we could tell that the
family was
down on their luck.&nbsp; The client turned around at the end of the
evening
and offered my team money when we could tell they were having a hard
time
putting food on their table.&nbsp; We turned it down, in fact my team
turns
down all monetary offerings.&nbsp; Not all groups can survive without
donations, but do not get greedy!&nbsp; If you are in the field of the
paranormal for the money you are in the wrong field.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">23) Fame!&nbsp; It is
a lovely thing, but do not come
into this field of the supernatural expecting to get a TV show, a
movie, or a
book deal.&nbsp; It doesn't happen for most groups, but unfortunately
looking
around at the websites out there a lot of emphasis is being put on
media
mentions. In fact it has become common practice to submit a groups link
to the
Shadowlands that lists media mentions first instead of what they can do
to help
people.&nbsp; Where just 10 years ago it was a great thing just to be
involved
in helping people with personal hauntings, now it seems like the field
has changed
to what TV show can I get my group on.&nbsp; Many times on these shows,
they
embellish the activity to get good ratings.&nbsp; Very few places have
activity
every few minutes like on TV, so embellishment does occur.&nbsp; This,
to me,
is misleading the public to believing that if their home doesn't have
activity
happening as frequently as on TV then it makes them hesitant to pick up
the
phone or look at the internet to find help. Very few people make money
in this
field and it is fleeting.&nbsp; Many paranormal TV shows have come and
gone,
and then you never hear from those groups again.&nbsp; It is one thing
to get
your name out there and the message that ghosts do exist, but at what
cost?&nbsp; Sometimes it will boil down to fame versus integrity and
where you
and your group will draw the line. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">24) When delivering
the evidence to the clients, be
prepared to explain everything.&nbsp; Remember these people do not go
out to
investigations all the time.&nbsp; Just telling them what the evidence
is may
not be enough.&nbsp; You should explain what you collected and
where.&nbsp;
View the photos with the clients, if possible let them listen to the
evps.&nbsp; Let them give you their opinion on what they see and what
they
hear.&nbsp; If it differs from yours be prepared to change your
mind.&nbsp;
What you may hear as Mommy, may actually be Bobby, or Tommy which might
be a
personal connection to the client. One option to consider, my group
gives a
copy of all video and photos collected during the investigation. That
way the
clients can view it at home. We think of it as a fresh set of eyes. The
client
is advised that they can call us with any questions or sees anything on
the DVD
that we may have missed.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">25)&nbsp; Keep in
mind if you did not find any
evidence while at the client's house, or if you found natural causes
for some
of the activity that the client has reported, does not mean that the
house is
not haunted or that you "debunked" the home.&nbsp; Dave does not like
the word "debunking" and neither should a good investigator.&nbsp;
You have probably heard it before but it stands stating again, you get
to leave
after spending a couple hours in a house.&nbsp; The client has to stay.
You may
have found a natural cause for some of the activity, but the feeling
that the
house is still haunted is still there.&nbsp; You may not have been
there at the
right time to catch the activity as evidence.&nbsp; Another thing that
may have
happened is that the spirit may have set up the evidence to make it
look
natural.&nbsp; Ghosts are capable of almost everything in death as they
were
able to do in life.&nbsp; So anything is possible.&nbsp; Just do not be
too
quick to tell the client their home is not haunted, just state that the
evidence you were presented with during the investigation does not
prove
without a doubt that their home is haunted.&nbsp; Debunking should be
left out
of an investigators vocabulary. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">26)&nbsp; Ask what
the client wants to do now.&nbsp;
Be prepared to do another full blown investigation.&nbsp; Most clients
just
want someone to validate their experiences with the possibility that
ghosts do
exist.&nbsp; Yet some others want someone to tell that there isn't a
ghost in
their home.&nbsp; Again all clients seem to want someone to listen to
them.
Above all they need to be told that most ghosts are not here to hurt
them or
even to scare them.&nbsp; They just want someone to notice them or the
things
they do in their very lonely world. They want validation too.&nbsp;
Never
dismiss a client until you have done everything you can possibly do for
them.&nbsp; You may go into a clients home 3, 4 or 10 times before the
spirits
get used to you being there and then you will get the best evidence.</p>

&nbsp; <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">These
are
just my hints, tips, thoughts and opinions
on what I feel clients should look for in an investigation team and
what good
investigators, researchers, hunters, and hobbyists should keep in the
back of
their mind. All we can do is share our thoughts and ideas to keep this
science
of the paranormal growing.&nbsp; The day we close our minds to new
ideas is the
day we become the skeptics and not the believers.</span>
