<P><B>The Goblins of Hervey Bay</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: go_luke@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I live in Australia and have had many things that are strange happen
to me in my 21 years, the strangest is my encounter with a real live goblin.</B>
<BR><B>In highschool around year 11, I was 16, a lot of the native Australian
kids started saying they had been harrased by evil goblins along a main
road. Aparently they were called Jun Jetties and are only to be seen by
those with Aboriginal blood. I am whiter than casper and I still saw one.</B>
<BR><B>I lived in the granny flat out the back of my parents house and
it was on a hot summer night that this happened. I had the fan on and I
left the window open so that I could feel&nbsp; the summer breeze. I went
to sleep and during a dream about T-shirt shopping, was awoken by my little
brother pacing the room. My door was always locked and Paul slept inside
the hpuse with the rest of my family. I spoke to my brothe and asked him
"What's wrong?'. he paced around much like guard dog does when you go near
the fence and through the moonlight I began to relalize it wasn't Paul
(my bro) at all. It came up to me and started breathing on me. It had a
raspy horrible sound in it's throat that gurgled contiuouly as it took
breaths. I was looking face to face in a small, grotesque little man who
was pale caucasian in complexion, bald beedy eyes with alot of white and
tiny dark pupils and a lot of gappy pointed littl pirhanna teeth. I seized
up. He continued looking down at me from bed for the next 2 minutes and
I began to start losing focus and had fight for consciousness from the
fear I was suffering. These things had been known to kick&nbsp; the crap
out of drunk indigenous folks but what was my fate? He backed up eventually
in to the shdows by my computer desk and tried to grasp the situation and
regain composer. I eventually switched on the TV next to the bed which
took ages to warm up and show a cherent picture. When it lit the roomwiht
it's dull glow, I ran to the door, which was still locked.I locked and
closed the door behind me and I took off to my not so ,much younger brother,
Lee, who slept in the room closest to the back door and when i got inside
I balled my eyes out. I explained what had happened and he tried to comfort
me. We started hearing pacing out side his window but did not look out.</B>
<BR><B>The next morning my Dad took us to my room out side and found the
room empty of evil midgets but the door was unlocked and open.</B>
<BR><B>Since then stories very similar to mine have appeared in the local
paper and there have even been hunts for the strange little dudes. As far
as I know&nbsp; the hunts still continue but an area out side of town around
farmland has been pinpointed as the source of the evil munchkins. Time
will tell if they are&nbsp; real, physical beings or some kind of spiritual
apparation.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Short Stay</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: david.lee121.21@virgin.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is an account of something strange that happend to me about
22yr,s ago.I had just came out of the Navy and had,nt quite decided what
to do with my life.Anyway joined a volunteer group in Cardiff working with
the disabled.Being from Liverpool I had to travel down to Cardiff which
is a journey of some 4hr,s by train,Iwas met at the station by the group
supervisor,who told me that dig,s had been arranged for me and that he
would take me there.The dig,s were not the best place I,d ever stayed but
then again they were not the worst.The house was owned by an old couple,and
I was to stay in a room on the ground floor that was furnished with a bed
easy chair table and kettle, it was all I bit spartan to say the least,if
I wanted to watch T.V I had to do so with the old couple in their livingroom
which was a prospect that I did not relish.After showing me around the
house I put my bags in my room and Pete the supervisor said that he would
take me to the home where I would be working.</B>
<BR><B>The home was about a 10 minute walk and on the way he filled me
in on what my duties would be,he also informed me that they had mixed up
the date,s and that I was not due to start work until monday,it now being
friday. he also told me that the rest of the staff would be going home
for the weekend and so the home would be empty. We arrived at the home
which was a large victorian house,the kind usually converted into flats.Pete
opened the front door and gave me a key,he then showed me around the house.
As you came through the front door ,which was a large solid wooden one,there
was then a smaller inner door.Then there was the hall with the stairs on
the left ,on the right where 2 door,s each s a bedroom of the staff member
who lived in.Further along the hall was another door which led into a large
room, this was known as the games and activity room,in the games room were
2 large windows coverd with heavy velvet curtains.Beyond the game,s room
were the kitchens and utility rooms .After a tour of downstairs we then
proceeded upstairs. At the top of the stairs there was a long landing with
4 bedrooms leading off then a couple of steps and then the bathroom there
was then a door which led into the upstairs lounge, this was a large room
furnished as a living room with a large T.V in the corner.</B>
<BR><B>This was the end of the tour so we sat in the living room and made
small talk, which ended in Pete suggesting that if I didnt fancy walking
back to my digs I could stay here,I would also be doing him a favour as
he didnt like leaving the home empty.Well the thought of staying with the
old couple didnt seem to inviting and besides this place had a T.V and
a large one at that that swung it for me and I decided to stay. After Pete
had left I had another look around the house ,made myself a cup of tea
and went upstairs to watch T.V. At about 10.30p.m I got a bit restless
and bored and noticed that there was a phone in the corner behind the door,I
thought about phoning my girlfriend in Liverpool, I didnt know if I was
allowed to use the phone but thought "what the heck".</B>
<BR><B>I called my girlfriend and told her how I was settling in and what
the place was like,whilst on the phone I sat by the door with the door
open just in case as I did,nt want to get caught using the phone on my
first night. After being on the phone for about 5 mins I heard the front
door open and close, followed by the inner door"I,ll have to go "I whispered
down the phone "Pete,s back" . I put the phone down and went and sat on
the couch and carried on watching T.V. I had heard someone walk to the
games room then open the door, walk across the game,s room which had a
wooden floor and out into the kitchen area.</B>
<BR><B>I just thought that Pete had called back to check on me and gone
to the kitchen to make himself a drink. After a while I thought "whats
he up to down there" and why has,nt he came upstairs. Then I thought that
it may be that one of the other members of staff called back and didnt
know that I was here. Not wanting to startle anyone I called down "Hello"
but got no reply. Then I thought about what Pete had said about not wanting
to leave the home empty and thought that we may have a burgler. I looked
around the room and in the corner in a box found a rounders bat,I took
this and proceeded downstairs. Downstairs I checked the 2 bedrooms both
were locked, I then went into the games room,no-one there ,I then went
into the kitchens, I checked the kitchens and utility rooms, no sign of
anybody,so I switched off the light,s and went back into the games room.
In the games room I was just about to switch off the light and go back
upstairs when I thought about the curtains, I walked over a quickly stached
the curtains back whilst having the bat ready in my other hand, nothing!
perplexed I switched off the light and went back upstairs. I had just resumed
my conversation on the phone and was telling them about what had happend
when the whole incident repeated itself, again I heard the front door open
and close and the the footsteps and then the other doors,again I hung up
the phone but this time ran straight downstairs and into the game,s room
determined to catch whoever was messing about, again Ilooked around the
kitchen and utility rooms to no avail,Iwas in the games room about to switch
off the lights when I remebered that I had,nt turned them on and was sure
that I,d switched them off last time,this spooked me a little I looked
at the curtains but this time did,nt have the heart to go and look behind
them.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway after that I spent an incident free night on the couch in
the lounge,only to be disturbed by a clock chimming in one of the rooms.</B>
<BR><B>We moved from that house a couple of week,s later, and talking to
Pete in the pub told him about my first night at the house" I think it
may be haunted " I said</B>
<BR><B>"Why do you think we moved" he replied with a grin</B>
<BR><B>P.S nobody in the house owned a clock that chimmed?</B>

<P><B>Ringing Telephone</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: Harbinger32@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I have never had a ghost experience in my life, and this is the
closest I</B>
<BR><B>have ever gotten to truly being scared in my own home.&nbsp; I work
nights and</B>
<BR><B>sleep during the day.&nbsp; While I am asleep at home during the
day, if my</B>
<BR><B>telephone rings, my wife will answer it to prevent it from waking
me up.</B>
<BR><B>This is a routine in our home for the past two months, but last
week my wife</B>
<BR><B>and two year old daughter were in South Carolina visiting friends
and I was</B>
<BR><B>alone in our home for ten days.&nbsp; After being woken up several
time in one</B>
<BR><B>day, I decided to disconnect the telephone from the wall because
I cannot</B>
<BR><B>control the volume of the ringer and my answering machine also has
no volume</B>
<BR><B>control.&nbsp; I did this for several days without incident until
I happened to be</B>
<BR><B>home one night that I had no work.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; It was about 2 AM and I was still awake on my computer.&nbsp;
I was getting</B>
<BR><B>tired and decided to call it a night.&nbsp; I unplugged the telephone
cord from my</B>
<BR><B>phone as usual, and went to the bedroom to lie down.&nbsp; I did
not go to sleep</B>
<BR><B>right away and laid in bed reading a book.&nbsp; At about 2:30 AM
my phone started</B>
<BR><B>to ring, and I, engrossed in my book, forgot that I had disconnected
my</B>
<BR><B>phone.&nbsp; All I could think of was who would be calling a 2:30
AM and that it</B>
<BR><B>must be an emergency.&nbsp; I ran to my phone to pick up before
my answering</B>
<BR><B>machine did and pressed the "on" button on my cordless phone.&nbsp;
I said hello,</B>
<BR><B>but my phone continued to ring.&nbsp; Puzzled, I looked down at
the LCD screen on</B>
<BR><B>my cordless to see who was calling (caller ID) and it read "remote
calling."</B>
<BR><B>It was then that I realized my telephone was not connected to the
telephone</B>
<BR><B>line, and the remote calling ID indicated that the "Page" button
had been</B>
<BR><B>pressed on the telephone console.&nbsp; This was confirmed when
I pressed the Page</B>
<BR><B>button and the telephone stopped ringing.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Needless to say I was a little scared that my phone would
start ringing</B>
<BR><B>without being plugged in, and the fact that I was the only person
in the</B>
<BR><B>house and have no pets made me even more nervous.&nbsp; I was afraid
if I went to</B>
<BR><B>bed it would start ringing again, so I removed the battery pack
from the</B>
<BR><B>cordless and then went to bed, a little less tired, and more scared
than I</B>
<BR><B>would have liked</B>

<P><B>Harrison High School</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: QueenKirstine@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am writing you this to clarify a few things. I am
that young woman who was caught by Malcome.</B>
<BR><B>I had grown up at HHS becasue my mother worked there, always hanging
around the Drama students becasue even at a young age I was interested
in theatre. I had heard all the stories of Malcome but never believed,
afterall, ghosts weren't real to me then. My freshman year of high school
I walked into the auditorium after school to sit on the stage and imagine
all the plays I would participate in. As I was sitting on the center of
the stage I glanced up to the catwalk becasue a light caught my eye. I
climbed the ladder to find out what the light was. As I was exploring the
world above the stage I could hear the custodian locking the doors. I freaked
out and started to run toward the laddar. I happened to slip and fall,
as I fell I rolled under the bar and barely caught myself. As I have very
little upper body strength I was sliping fast. I was looking down crying
and begging for help when it happened. I felt something pulling me up and
the next thing I knew I was back on the catwa!</B>
<BR><B>lk. I was so shocked. I looked around while wiping the tears yet
found no one there. I then felt something cold brush my cheek, as though
a kiss. I then remembered the doors and climbed down the ladder. I opened
the door, stupid me, they are not lockable from the inside. That day i
started believing in ghosts. Many times after that while performing a play
or musical, I would up to the catwalk and see the light watching. I knew
he was watching me. The last day of my senior year I went inot the auditorium
alone and said good-bye to Malcome once again feeling that cold tingly
kiss on my cheek. Each time I go back to the school, I always make a special
stop in the auditorium to say hello to Malcome. Without him saving my life,
I would have joined him there forever.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi , im 13 years old and go to Kenneth White Jr. High. we had to
do a report on ghosts and my teacher said to look through ur site so i
did. i wanted to tell you my experiences at K-White Jr. High. People say
that there is a ghost named Charlie in our school, and its true. usually
we here weird noises in the gym very early in the morning (we have to get
to school at 6:00 am for athletics) and we here basketballs bouncing. a
teacher has claimed that she saw charlie look through the window on the
door when she stayed late at school to finish up some work. She said he
just looked through the window and looked at her, but somehow, she didnt
fell scared or threatned by him. Any wayz Charlie was supposed to have
fallen off of the&nbsp; bleachers and goes into the girls locker room to
open their lockers (thats what ive been throuh, i know i lock my locker,
and the next day i find it open. coincidense?)</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The Green Indian</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: janine_mm@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was a little girl about seven or eight ( I am now 30) I was
laying on the couch watching television with my brother who was laying
on the floor.&nbsp; When I saw this green Indian Head pop out of the cushion
right in front of my face and I began to scream and by brother asked me
what had happened and I told him I saw&nbsp; a green man (an Indian)&nbsp;
with two braids one on each side and one feather in his hair.&nbsp; It
was so scary.&nbsp; Then maybe a year later My brother had one of his friends
spending the night and I was all alone in my room and was upset because
I was all alone.&nbsp; When lying in my bed I saw the Green Indian Man
again at the end of my bed standing there just staring at me with a tomahawk
in his hand.&nbsp; I screamed and my brother and his friend came running
to ask me what had happened.&nbsp; No one believed me until my mom checked
into the history of the house to find out that our house was built on an
old indian burial ground.&nbsp; I believe this to be true because when
I was a kid we used to dig up stuff in our back yard like arrow heads made
out of obsidian.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Greenville@entertainment.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>I would like to share with you, my experience, in which I believe
I was</B>
<BR><B>visited by a spirit.&nbsp; Of course, this could have been all my</B>
<BR><B>imagination, but I believe that it was the ghost of my child.</B>
<BR><B>In April of 1994 I was 15 years old, and gave birth to a healthy
baby</B>
<BR><B>girl named Jade.&nbsp; She died suddenly of SIDS in June of 1994.&nbsp;
I used to</B>
<BR><B>sleep with the blanket that she died on, and the day we buried her,
I</B>
<BR><B>was obviously grief stricken.&nbsp; My mom had given me one shot
of Rockin'</B>
<BR><B>Rye to help me sleep.&nbsp; That night, when I went to bed, I was
crying and</B>
<BR><B>holding on to her blanket, when all of a sudden, I got a kind of
chill,</B>
<BR><B>and I felt a breeze pass by me.&nbsp; Right then and there, my tears</B>
<BR><B>stopped, and I could smell the scent of her all around me.&nbsp;
I remember</B>
<BR><B>feeling a sense of relief, and I actually smiled for the first time</B>
<BR><B>since her passing.</B>
<BR><B>I honestly believe that Jade had come back to let me know that she
was</B>
<BR><B>OK, and that I shouldn't cry anymore because she was in a better
place.</B>
<BR><B>I am now 23 years old, and time has eased my pain of her death,
and I</B>
<BR><B>will always miss Jade, but I will carry that feeling that passed</B>
<BR><B>through me on that night for the rest of my life.&nbsp; I still
wish that I</B>
<BR><B>could feel her presence one more time, but I guess it's better to
just</B>
<BR><B>let her go, and be with the lord, and maybe that's why I haven't
ever</B>
<BR><B>felt her again.</B>
<BR><B>Thank you for allowing me to share my story with you.</B>

<P><B>Ghost Experience?</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jkiehart@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This will probably not cause chills for the readers, but it certainly
did</B>
<BR><B>for me:</B>
<BR><B>I love ghosts, and call ghosts to me often.&nbsp; It never worked
until tonight,</B>
<BR><B>just about ten minutes ago.</B>
<BR><B>Every night, I bathe by candlelight.&nbsp; It's just something I
like to do;&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>fill the tub, light the candles, get in, relax, and scrub away the
worries</B>
<BR><B>of the day.</B>
<BR><B>Tonight, I think my wish to experience a ghost was filled.</B>
<BR><B>I was in the tub, and two candles were lit.&nbsp; Two candles which
I have always</B>
<BR><B>had lit when I take a bath; one at my head, one at my feet.&nbsp;
There was</B>
<BR><B>absolutely nothing odd about this bath.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were lit,
I was relaxing.</B>
<BR><B>Nothing "odd" has ever occurred during my nightly baths.</B>
<BR><B>The candle at my feet starting making an odd "popping" sound.&nbsp;
The flame</B>
<BR><B>slowly became dimmer and dimmer.&nbsp; Finally, with a resounding
"pop," it</B>
<BR><B>extinguished itself.</B>
<BR><B>"Cool," I thought.&nbsp; "Wouldn't that be so cool if that was a
ghost, and the</B>
<BR><B>other candle went out, in the same fashion?"&nbsp; I only waited
for a moment or</B>
<BR><B>so before I said aloud, "I know a ghost is doing this, and I want
whoever</B>
<BR><B>you are to do the same thing to the remaining candle."</B>
<BR><B>I kid you not, the candle at the "head" side of the tub, starting
making the</B>
<BR><B>same popping noises, and within less than a minute, it, too, extinguished</B>
<BR><B>itself.</B>
<BR><B>There was no "reason" for this to happen.&nbsp; Like I said, I take
a bath every</B>
<BR><B>night with these candles lit (and when they're not in use, they
have "lids"</B>
<BR><B>with which I keep them protected with, so as not to coat the wicks
with</B>
<BR><B>hairspray, etc.).&nbsp; I've never heard and/or seen a candle, let
alone two in a</B>
<BR><B>row, extinguish themselves in this fashion.</B>
<BR><B>The best part was was that I was NOT afraid.&nbsp; I thanked whatever
it was for</B>
<BR><B>showing itself to me.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Athens</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: dragonsong86@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello.&nbsp; I'm a freshman at Ohio University in Athens Ohio.&nbsp;
We have been</B>
<BR><B>named the most haunted place in Ohio and the 13th scariest place
in the</B>
<BR><B>world by the television show Scariest Places on Earth that is shown
on Fox</B>
<BR><B>Family Channel frequently.&nbsp; I have only had one personal experience
so far</B>
<BR><B>here, but I've spent a lot of time researching and getting all the
legends</B>
<BR><B>that center on our school and town, and I thought you might like
to know</B>
<BR><B>some of them.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The residence hall that I live in, Bush
Hall, is one of the least</B>
<BR><B>haunted buildings on campus. Everyone who has lived here for years
and years</B>
<BR><B>has heard strange sounds that no one can explain.&nbsp; It comes
from the</B>
<BR><B>ceilings, and it sounds like there is someone in the room above
dropping</B>
<BR><B>marbels on the floor one by one, over and over.&nbsp; It's been
said that it also</B>
<BR><B>sounds like drops of water, except heavier, perhaps blood.&nbsp;
My roommates and</B>
<BR><B>I have heard these noises, along with most of the other girls in
the</B>
<BR><B>building.&nbsp; It's also said that footsteps follow people in the
halls at night</B>
<BR><B>and the water fountains turn on by themselves to give drinks to
ghostly</B>
<BR><B>visitors, but I have neither seen these things nor do I know of
anyone who</B>
<BR><B>has.&nbsp; The sound of the dropping marbels happens in every building
on campus</B>
<BR><B>that is supposed to be haunted, but in most of the other bulidings
it sounds</B>
<BR><B>like hundreds of marbels all at once.&nbsp; They have tested all
the piping and</B>
<BR><B>other structural things that might cause these noises, but no explination</B>
<BR><B>has been found.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Jefferson residence hall some students
went into an abandoned and</B>
<BR><B>normally locked room back in 1996.&nbsp; Sitting at an old desk,
in the corner of</B>
<BR><B>the dark room, was an older woman, of perhaps 40 years. She wore</B>
<BR><B>conservative clothes, and was described as looking very much like
an</B>
<BR><B>elementary school teacher from the '50s. The residents at first
didn't</B>
<BR><B>realize what they were seeing, and greeted the woman, only to then
realize</B>
<BR><B>that she was slightly transparent and floating an inch or so above
her</B>
<BR><B>chair. The residents ran to tell their RA, and when they</B>
<BR><B>returned the door was closed and locked, with no sign of anyone
having been</B>
<BR><B>there.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dorm right next to mine is Washington
Hall.&nbsp; A few years ago a</B>
<BR><B>girls basketball team came to play our team, and stayed in that
dorm.&nbsp; They</B>
<BR><B>had a wonderful time, laughing and shouting all the time.&nbsp;
On their way back</B>
<BR><B>home, their bus crashed and every member of the team died.&nbsp;
They say you can</B>
<BR><B>hear them laughing and shouting in the halls and lobby of the dorm.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few years ago a student fell from her
fourth floor window in Crawford</B>
<BR><B>Hall and died rather gruesomely.&nbsp; She has been seen walking
about at dusk,</B>
<BR><B>and sometimes she talks to students.&nbsp; The hall has a history
of unexplained</B>
<BR><B>noises, lights going on and off by themselves, doors opening and
closing,</B>
<BR><B>and various other strange happenings.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A girl died in her sleep at the Convocation
Center a few years back,</B>
<BR><B>and a girl named Lisa, who had not heard this story, often woke
up in the</B>
<BR><B>middle of the night screaming that someone was next to her in her
bed.&nbsp; They</B>
<BR><B>later found out that it was the same room and the same bed that
the girl had</B>
<BR><B>died in.&nbsp; Across the hall from that room, there was a girl
who used to talk</B>
<BR><B>to her closet.&nbsp; Her roommates thought she was crazy.&nbsp;
She left for the</B>
<BR><B>weekend once, and told her roommates that her closet was angry and
that they</B>
<BR><B>should be careful.&nbsp; After she left, the shades began to go
up and down,</B>
<BR><B>books began to fly, chairs tipped, lights switched on and off, the
tv</B>
<BR><B>changed channels, and the closet doors flew open and shut.&nbsp;
When the girl</B>
<BR><B>returned and talked to the closet again, everything returned to
normal.&nbsp; A</B>
<BR><B>boy also murdered his ex-girlfriend in one of the rooms in the 1980's
and</B>
<BR><B>it's said that she walks the halls at night, watching over the students.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scariest and most provable tale on
campus happened in Wilson Hall.</B>
<BR><B>There was a girl who lived there who practiced in black magic.&nbsp;
It was said</B>
<BR><B>that she could be heard chanting in strange tongues late at night
and a</B>
<BR><B>green light came from under her door.&nbsp; Then no one saw her
for a long time.</B>
<BR><B>Finally the RA got a key and opened the girl's room.&nbsp; The girl
had slit her</B>
<BR><B>wrists, written satanic symbols all over the walls in her blood
and then</B>
<BR><B>hanged herself in the center of the room.&nbsp; They cleaned the
room, painted</B>
<BR><B>over the walls with many coats of paint and gave the room to two
other</B>
<BR><B>students the following year.&nbsp; They didn't stay there long though.&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>symbols in blood came back, and the room glowed green, drawers slammed,
and</B>
<BR><B>ghastly screams were heard.&nbsp; Finally, the school officials
decided that the</B>
<BR><B>room was not safe for students to stay in, so they sealed off the
room</B>
<BR><B>perminently. To this day if you go to the room on the 4th floor
you can see</B>
<BR><B>a demonic face in the grain of the wood on the door.&nbsp; This
story is tracable</B>
<BR><B>in the school's records.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bryan Hall is usually conscidered the most
haunted building on campus.</B>
<BR><B>It is the oldest residence hall on campus still used as a residence
hall.</B>
<BR><B>There is supposedly a ghost in the attic, a few on the second floor,
and 3</B>
<BR><B>on the fourth floor, but I haven't been able to find the specific
stories</B>
<BR><B>behind them, other than witnesses of aparitions, but there is no
record of</B>
<BR><B>death there.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; You can't live in or around Athens without knowing
about the 5 graveyards</B>
<BR><B>that form a perfect pentagon around the entire campus.&nbsp; THe
pentagon is</B>
<BR><B>commonly known as a symbol of magic and other worldly happenings.&nbsp;
It is</B>
<BR><B>used as a protection sometimes.&nbsp; The building that is at the
very center of</B>
<BR><B>the pentagon is the only one on campus that has no tales of ghosts
attached</B>
<BR><B>to it.&nbsp; They say it is protected by the pentagon.&nbsp; The
graveyards are very</B>
<BR><B>strange in themselves.&nbsp; One of them has the graves laid out
north and south</B>
<BR><B>instead of the normal east and west.&nbsp; One of them has a tree
on a rock ridge</B>
<BR><B>that has rope marks on it from where they used to execute people
by hanging.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; All the graveyards are reportedly haunted.&nbsp; They are
a favorite place for</B>
<BR><B>cult activities and seiances.&nbsp; They say that the pentagon supplies
the power</B>
<BR><B>to raise the dead.&nbsp; The cemetary at the Ridges, an old insane
assylum, is</B>
<BR><B>especially spooky.&nbsp; Most of the graves have no names, they're
either marked</B>
<BR><B>by numbers or nothing at all.&nbsp; There is a circle of unmarked
graves, with no</B>
<BR><B>apparent reason, and it is said that if you sit in the circle you
will be</B>
<BR><B>visited by spirits, and there are several tales of spirits following
people</B>
<BR><B>home from the circle.&nbsp; The assylum has almost hundreds of ghost
stories to</B>
<BR><B>itself.&nbsp; It was an old institution, where hyper-active or slightly
disturbed</B>
<BR><B>people were kept in solitary confinement and treated with shock
therapy.&nbsp; It</B>
<BR><B>was shut down in the 80's becuase it was considered cruel treatment.&nbsp;
Some</B>
<BR><B>of the patients can still be found in town. One works at the local
Rax, and</B>
<BR><B>another plays his violin on the street for the students walking
by.&nbsp; Another</B>
<BR><B>stands on the streets and tells people they are living in sin and
bound for</B>
<BR><B>hell.&nbsp; At any rate, you can hear screams in the halls of the
assylum, and</B>
<BR><B>many other strange occurances have been reported.&nbsp; The most
popular tale is</B>
<BR><B>of an old patient named Marge.&nbsp; This story has solid proof
to back it up.</B>
<BR><B>When they closed the assylum, they knew that the students and kids
of the</B>
<BR><B>town would try to get in and explore, so as each section of the
buildings</B>
<BR><B>were evacuated, they were sealed shut.&nbsp; Marge was deaf and
dumb.&nbsp; She exited</B>
<BR><B>the building, but then remembered that she had left a cherished
possession</B>
<BR><B>behind.&nbsp; She asked permission to go back for it, and was granted
it.&nbsp; No one</B>
<BR><B>is sure what happened next, either she got confused in the long
twisting</B>
<BR><B>halls and could not find her way out, or&nbsp; simply forgot to
come back out,</B>
<BR><B>but she was sealed in the building because everyone thought that
she was</B>
<BR><B>out.&nbsp; She could not yell for help to the workers not ten yards
outside of</B>
<BR><B>the barred windows because she couldn't talk.&nbsp; She took off
her clothes,</B>
<BR><B>folded her arms across her chest, and eventually died of starvation.&nbsp;
Her</B>
<BR><B>body was found when the building was reopened several years later.&nbsp;
When</B>
<BR><B>they moved her body, there was a print on the floor, like a leaf
leaves on</B>
<BR><B>cement sometimes, where her body had lain.&nbsp; As hard as they
scrubbed, the</B>
<BR><B>stain is still there, in the shape of her body, and if you went
on the tours</B>
<BR><B>they used to give of the assylum, you could see it.&nbsp; If you
are a little</B>
<BR><B>determined, you can find a picture of it on the internet on one
of the</B>
<BR><B>'Haunted Athens' sights.&nbsp; Some say that she walks the halls,
looking for a</B>
<BR><B>way out and screaming in panic.&nbsp; The details of Marge and her
print can be</B>
<BR><B>found in the Athens city police records.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Our school is built on old Indian territory.&nbsp;
There is at least one</B>
<BR><B>Indian burial ground, located under the Memorial Auditorium.&nbsp;
There is also</B>
<BR><B>a story that is rarely believed, about a headless buffalo that roams
College</B>
<BR><B>Green.&nbsp; It has a story behind it, but it's so ridiculous it's
hardly worth</B>
<BR><B>telling.&nbsp; There are more believable Indian legends surrounding
the area</B>
<BR><B>though.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So.&nbsp; There are as many of the ghost stories
about the school and area as</B>
<BR><B>I have been able to find and get details about.&nbsp; Some of them
are probably</B>
<BR><B>completely untrue, some are based on absolute researchable fact.&nbsp;
If you</B>
<BR><B>want to include any of them in your sight, feel free.</B>

<P><B>Hauntings</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: courtneymerriman@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I should preface these stories by saying that I think I am open to
spirits of all kinds. I have frequently had dreams of occurances that have
yet to happen, and found later that they have. I have dreams of places
I have never been, and when I go exploring I find them exactly as I saw
them in my dream. I can frequently look at other people and say out loud
what they are thinking or getting ready to say. None of these things have
ever upset me or made me nervous, although they have freaked out a few
of my friends.</B>
<BR><B>I have had three "ghostly" experiences in three different houses.
The first and most frequent is in the house that I grew up in which is
located in Montgomery County Maryland. I have always had a fear of my basement,
since I was a child, but I couldn't quite place what it was that made me
uneasy. Often when I am down there, I feel cold gusts of air and "cold
spots" in the room. This is strange because my basement is completely underground.
I always feel like someone is watching me when I am down there. A few days
ago I was running on the treadmill late at night. I felt the cold gust
of air, and saw that my cat was looking up in the corner of the wall. It
made me a little nervous, but I continued to run, occasionaly looking over
my shoulder to see if someone was there. The reason I did this is because
I felt as though someone was in the room with me watching me. I finally
turned around and faced the wall and started running, thinking to myself
that nothing had ever happened so to just calm down, and I closed my eyes.
That was when it happened, I felt a male figure come up from behind me
( Iknow he was male even though I didn't see him because of his height)
he put a string over my head and around my throat, to choke me from behind.
I got short of breath (which could be attributed to the running) shut off
the treadmill and picked up my cat and ran upstairs.</B>
<BR><B>Both of my houses in college were also haunted. The first one was
an old lady who would walk by my bedroom at night (it was right off the
kitchen). She would walk back and forth form the kitchen to the bathroom,
stirring something in a coffee mug. All of my roomates heard the same thing,
but it never made any of us upset, she was like an Grandmother watching
over us.</B>
<BR><B>The second "house" was actaully an apartment in a building that
was buiilt in 1883. I lived on the top floor in the corner. One night my
boyfriend and I were laying in bed and he shook me awake saying that he
had seen a little boy standing by my stereo in the corner smiling and saying
"Come play with me." I didn't see anything and assumed that he was just
trying to scare me, I asked why he hadn't woken me while he was there,
and he said that he couldn't move. While I never saw this "ghost" the lights
and electrical appliances in my apartment began to turn on and off by themselves.
Whenever I would take a shower, the curtain would brush up and all around
me covering my entire body until all I cold see what the fabric. When I
would say "stop it" it would float back down. The ony windows in the house
were on the other side of the apartment, and there was no way that there
could have been a draft. I would wake up in the middle of the night and
all of the drop ceiling panels would be on the floor. I would pick them
up and put them back, but they kept falling until the day I moved out.
The only time I ever felt threatened was the rececnt experience in my basement,
but other than that I am not bothered my the pressence of "ghosts" in my
life.</B><B></B>

<P><B>This isnt really an experience or anything, not like what most the
people on</B>
<BR><B>this website talk about but it is weird and strange to me, but totally</B>
<BR><B>natural at the same time. Im 15 years old and as long as i can remember,
ive</B>
<BR><B>never felt really alone, like someone is always with me. I feel
this</B>
<BR><B>especially at night when im drifting off to sleep at night and it
feels like</B>
<BR><B>someone is in the room with me. And at moments when i should feel</B>
<BR><B>frightened, i feel totally relaxed and like that nobody can hurt
me. I feel</B>
<BR><B>safe. There are also times when i get these feelings, like something
bad is</B>
<BR><B>going to happen that day, or that someone is going to hurt themselves
(i</B>
<BR><B>usually feel this just before it happens). When this happens i feel
like i</B>
<BR><B>see or sense it happening in my head at slow motion. Now i suppose
i sound</B>
<BR><B>totally pathetic and sad! So im going to go.</B>

<P><B>Ghost Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: TASHLAWN@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>We were outside with me and my friends and one of my friends kept
getting pushed down every time we left a yard. We had walkie-talkies and
we kept getting strange signals, such as a girl screaming, we couldn't
talk to each other on them even though we were standing next to each other.
Then we went into my friends back yard and they have a club house, and
I saw something watching us in the clubhouse. Then the next day me and
my friend Justin, went over to the neighbors house (the people we were
with the night before) and went in there house and we still had the walkie-talkies,
and one of them went into the bathroom. A couple of minutes later we heard
a scream and I rushed to the bathroom and there on the mirror was the word
DIE written in water...... These strange happening have been happening
for 14 years which is how long we've lived in these two houses.</B>

<P><B>for about 40 years my grandma has lived in the same house. and i
have loved</B>
<BR><B>that house ever since i could remeber. the only time i did not want
to go</B>
<BR><B>into it was 6 years ago when my grandpa died from cancer, and i
knew that he</B>
<BR><B>wouldn't be there.</B>
<BR><B>well my cousin and her mom moved in with my grandma(my aunt making
an</B>
<BR><B>apartment of the basement, and my cousin having the upstairs).&nbsp;
my cousin is</B>
<BR><B>only 5 monthes younger then me, so we're real close.</B>
<BR><B>about 4 monthes ago, i spent a night over there.&nbsp; it was just
like normal,</B>
<BR><B>we were late-night movies, after every one else was asleep. we talked
about</B>
<BR><B>normal teen girl issues. but maybe you should know something about
me and my</B>
<BR><B>cousin.&nbsp; we have always beleived in the paranormal, and have
always</B>
<BR><B>witnessed and experienced it throughout the years. but this night
in</B>
<BR><B>particular, was something way different then any thing else; especially
for</B>
<BR><B>me.</B>
<BR><B>i was sitting down in the living room on the floor in front of the
t.v., my</B>
<BR><B>cousin on the couch, and of course the lights were off. i started
feeling</B>
<BR><B>something, kind of like...like a presence you could say.&nbsp; so
i told my</B>
<BR><B>cousin about it.&nbsp; she said she felt something too, but it turned
out that my</B>
<BR><B>grandmas dogs were just coming into the living room with us.&nbsp;
but even when</B>
<BR><B>they left, i still felt something.</B>
<BR><B>i felt something breathing down the back of my neck.&nbsp; and i
started hearing</B>
<BR><B>my name being called.&nbsp; so i asked my cousin if she said anything,
she</B>
<BR><B>didn't.</B>
<BR><B>when the channel began to change, i told my cousin to the turn it
back, she</B>
<BR><B>was shocked! she told me that i was doing it. i looked down and
noticed that</B>
<BR><B>i was holding the remote and that i was turning the channel.&nbsp;
at that moment</B>
<BR><B>i noticed that i wasn't myself, i felt soooo different.&nbsp; when
i looked at my</B>
<BR><B>cousin she screamed.&nbsp; i had no idea why.&nbsp; she told me
that for a second my</B>
<BR><B>eyes turned beat red and that my entire face changed.&nbsp; i didn't
know to</B>
<BR><B>believe her or not.&nbsp; then she started getting freaked out so
she went into</B>
<BR><B>the kitchen.</B>
<BR><B>i was left in the living room by myself. i had no idea what to do,
so i just</B>
<BR><B>sat there and continued to watch t.v..</B>
<BR><B>then something happened that will scar me for life.&nbsp; (you know
the pictures</B>
<BR><B>of people that are just muscle, you see them in science classes,
and health</B>
<BR><B>classes) well a picture like that came up except the guy was just
blue, the</B>
<BR><B>background white, it was just his head, and he began talking to
me.&nbsp; i got</B>
<BR><B>up turned off the t.v. and ran. i went outside to the front yard,
and my</B>
<BR><B>cousin came out only to see me crying hysterically. after that nothing</B>
<BR><B>happened, for the night.</B>
<BR><B>the next day, me and my cousin went in to the attic to play hide-n-seek(we</B>
<BR><B>like playing little kid games together)well she hid in the closet,
and i</B>
<BR><B>couldn't find her, so i told her to come out.&nbsp; she was trying,
and i heard a</B>
<BR><B>noise, so i walked over to her. i heard her scream, and started
yelling for</B>
<BR><B>me to help her. i began pulling her as hard as i could, and i finally
got</B>
<BR><B>her out.&nbsp; she told me that she could feel someones hands holding
her back</B>
<BR><B>against the wall.</B>
<BR><B>i've always beleived that that house was haunted, but not until
those recent</B>
<BR><B>events i thought that it was really true. now every night i pray.
hoping</B>
<BR><B>that my grandpa will look over that house and protect my grandma

<BR><B>Ghosts Recalled</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: lillymunster13@home.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I found your web sight through my search for ghosts. Anyway, my story
starts like this. I was 12 years old and my parents had moved into this
apt. complex in California. The apt complex was built in the excavated
area of a washed out cemetery that was moved to a new location in the 1970's.
Unfortunately, part of the cemetary was still located next to the apt.
complex.</B>
<BR><B>The apt. we moved into was #113 directly lined up with the cemetary
gates. My bedroom window was allined with the open space between the gate
and the iron fence. Shortly after moving in, I noticed strange happenings
in the apt. My cats never wanted to come inside, there were unusual cold
spots in the apt. and I could always hear voices. Explaining this to my
parents was useless at the time.</B>
<BR><B>In my parents room there was one apparition that I didn't care for
he was an older man probably in his 50's. The reason I know that it was
a he, because he actually had a shaped apparation. He always walked from
the window to the wall, and only stopped in the doorway. He never did leave
the room. When you were in the room together, he was always staring right
at you when he walked through. He was always dressed in a buttoned dress
suit-grey, with nothing below the knees. He wore a grey derby/bolero hat,
and swung his arms when he walked.</B>
<BR><B>Later on when I first met my husband, he explained about the same
male apparition in the same room. And I hadn't told him about that story
yet. Apparently he And his parents used to live in the same apt. and his
mother had the same experiences. To this day I still see Ghosts, I can
walk into a building, sometimes even standing outside, I can sense them.
I can feel cold spots, hear voices, and see lights roaming around if I
stop what I'm doing long enough. My youngest daughter is the same way,
she's two, and will stare off into a corner. She says that there's people
in our house, or where ever we go. She seems to like my neighbors house
the best. She's always there, playing with someone only she can see.</B>
<BR><B>I can't walk into a cemetary without feeling like there's something
clawing at my hands and ankles. I don't know if this is normal, But my
G-ma, and mother have pictures that you'ld swear were taken with defective
cameras, but weren't. They have smears and smudges on them, even the one's
with my youngest are that way.</B>

<P><B>Ghosts in the Phillipines</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: khufu_69@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Well. I used ta go to the Philipines a lot to visit relatives. At
night standing right beside my bed would be a woman dressed in red. I was
able to see through it in a way. I couldn't really see here face or anything
but the red dress standed out. The figure was freaky but somehow gave me
a sense of comfort and safety. I don't know how or why though. I guess
it was just a feeling that happened to come accross. Outside i saw a lady
dressed in white running somewhere. I went with my older cousin to come
and check it out cause well I was about 10 then and I was afraid. there
was nothing. I was able to see specs of white somewhere. The house was
pretty big. There was a whole compound that they owned. we were the only
people with electricity in the area besides some people accross the street.
Well I guess we returned to Canada.</B>
<BR><B>On May 27,1999 my grandmother died. My mother and my aunt went to
the Philipines to go to the funeral. Well I had a dream one night. Due
to time differences this seemed to have happened at the time of the funeral
maybe. I had a dream that I was at the funeral. I saw some ofg my relatives
there. All of a sudden my Grandmothers spirit was beside me saying how
mucvh she loved us all. No one noticed me in the dream except the spirit
and some dogs i played with when i was there before cause my uncles has
a lot of animals. My mom came back with a few pictures. To my surprise
they looked exactly what i saw in the dream of the burrial and stuff.</B>
<BR><B>After what happened weird things appeared in the sky. A few times
the moon was red and kind of had a skull on it.</B>
<BR><B>Nothing else really went on.</B><B></B>

I am Jessica and i am 12. i have lived in my house for 4</B>

is</B>
<BR><B>who i believe is haunting it.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The first year i moved here it was just little signs, like</B>

back</B>
<BR><B>of my neck, strange noises, moveing objects, and things turning
on and off.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On the second year it was like everywhere i went i was</B>
<BR><B>being watched by 'something'. but it never went away, even when
i slept</B>
<BR><B>i would wake up and know it was there. i started getting really
freaked</B>
<BR><B>out and my dad called a phsychic but she couldn't find anything.
i got</B>
<BR><B>so scared. Every night i couldn't sleep, it seemed like i was the
only</B>
<BR><B>one who really noticed it. This was for the 3rd year also.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But on the 4th year i realized it didn't mean me any</B>
<BR><B>harm. It was my friends father who had died and he spoke to me and
said</B>
<BR><B>i was in for a large amount of danger in the next few years so he
was</B>

<BR><B>parents and older brother in an ordinary looking house on the end
of a</B>
<BR><B>dead-end street in a city near Green Bay, Wisconsin. I couldn't
have been</B>
<BR><B>more than 4 or 5 years old when the events started happening to
me in that</B>
<BR><B>house. The three rooms where things would happen were in the bathroom</B>
<BR><B>downstairs, in my bedroom at the top of the stairs and down in the
basement.</B>
<BR><B>(Of course... these types of things *always* happen in the basement,
don't</B>
<BR><B>they...?)</B>
<BR><B>In the largest room of the basement, my brother and I kept our toys...</B>
<BR><B>this room was our playroom where we could be rambunctious while
we</B>
<BR><B>played and wouldn't disturb my dad, who slept up on the second floor</B>
<BR><B>during the day time. (He was a police officer that worked the graveyard</B>
<BR><B>shift.) To get to the basement, there was a doorway to the stairs
leading</B>
<BR><B>down. To the left of the top of the stairs was the door leading
to the back</B>
<BR><B>yard. The staircase was straight and was always dark, even with
the lights</B>
<BR><B>on. I grew to become terrified of these stairs, especially if I
were</B>
<BR><B>climbing down them alone. I always felt like someone was watching
me at the</B>
<BR><B>bottom of the stairs... I never felt like it was an evil presence,
but</B>
<BR><B>merely that it liked to scare children and tease them. I remember
several</B>
<BR><B>times falling down the last few stairs, even when I would make considerable</B>
<BR><B>efforts to scoot my way down the last 5 steps... you know that motion...</B>
<BR><B>where kids kinda slide down each step on their bums, rather than
walking on</B>
<BR><B>their feet... My mother always thought that I was clumsy, despite
my</B>
<BR><B>pleading that I was indeed being careful on the stairs. I think
that whoever</B>
<BR><B>was down there liked to trip me up on the last few stairs. It delighted
in</B>
<BR><B>seeing me stumble and fall on my face. Note that it never tripped
or pushed</B>
<BR><B>me from the top of the stairs, as this type of spill</B>
<BR><B>might have ended fatally for me... No... it was always a teasing
sort of</B>
<BR><B>spirit, kind of like the way an older brother or sister plays tricks
and</B>
<BR><B>rough-houses with their younger sibling.</B>
<BR><B>After stepping off the stairs, you walked straight and entered the</B>
<BR><B>playroom, which spanned over to the left. However... if you kept
walking</B>
<BR><B>straight there was a short door that lead to a sort of closet, where
my</B>
<BR><B>brother and I kept our collection of board games. This room was
always icily</B>
<BR><B>cold to the point of being able to see your breath, even in the
middle of</B>
<BR><B>the humid Wisconsin summers. I abhorred going near this room, often</B>
<BR><B>insisting that my brother or father go fetch the game when we wanted
to play</B>
<BR><B>one. I guess I sort of deduced that whatever was tripping me on
the steps</B>
<BR><B>"lived" in this room, and I didn't want to have any part of it.
I was scared</B>
<BR><B>that it would lock me in there or something.</B>
<BR><B>On to the other rooms... the bathroom was located on the first floor,
and</B>
<BR><B>was the only bathroom in the house. There was a frosted window that
was</B>
<BR><B>above the bathtub on the wall opposite the door. One time late at
night I</B>
<BR><B>went in there and saw the shadowy image of the shoulders and head
of a man</B>
<BR><B>in the window... it was a profile view and he was doing what appeared
to be</B>
<BR><B>working, swinging what looked like a sledgehammer over his shoulder
with</B>
<BR><B>both hands. I just froze and stared at it in terror.. I watched
it for a</B>
<BR><B>moment, at first thinking it was my dad outside, but I knew that
my dad</B>
<BR><B>wouldn't be up doing anything like that in the middle of the night.
(He</B>
<BR><B>would have been at work anyway.) Quickly I forgot about having a
need to use</B>
<BR><B>the bathroom and high-tailed it up to my bedroom. It was there that
I had</B>
<BR><B>the most lasting and terrifying experience of my childhood life...</B>
<BR><B>My bedroom was to the immediate right of the top of the wooden stairs</B>
<BR><B>that led upstairs... down at the opposite end of the hall was my
parent's</B>
<BR><B>bedroom, and in the center was a very small room that my mother
used as a</B>
<BR><B>sewing room. (My brother slept in a room downstairs.) Since most
of my toys</B>
<BR><B>were down in the playroom, my bedroom was fairly empty... I had
a double</B>
<BR><B>bed, a dresser and a small shelf that held my large collection of
stuffed</B>
<BR><B>animals. There wasn't even a closet built in this particular room</B>
<BR><B>originally, and my father was in the process of constructing me
one... All</B>
<BR><B>that was completed was a couple of drywall structures off the wall
to the</B>
<BR><B>right of my bed, he hadn't even installed a door yet.</B>
<BR><B>One night I was sleeping peacefully on my side, with my back facing
the</B>
<BR><B>unfinished closet, when I was awakened by a very sharp jab to my
lower back,</B>
<BR><B>like someone was very forcibly poking me with their finger... It
felt like a</B>
<BR><B>"wake up and get out" kind of poke. I instantly opened my eyes,
initially</B>
<BR><B>thinking it was my brother picking on me... It poked me again, harder
this</B>
<BR><B>time. I sat up in bed and looked around, but no one was there...
The air</B>
<BR><B>seemed heavy around my bed, dense with a crackling sort of energy.
I could</B>
<BR><B>still feel the sensation in the area of my back where the thing
had poked</B>
<BR><B>me, kind of like when you bump into something and know it's going
to leave a</B>
<BR><B>bruise... So I knew I hadn't been dreaming. Needless to say, I was</B>
<BR><B>absolutely terrified and I leaped out of bed and tore off running
to my</B>
<BR><B>parents room. My mom consoled me and let me sleep with her that
night... but</B>
<BR><B>that wasn't the end of it... The poking happened several times afterwards.</B>
<BR><B>My parents would never let me take more than one stuffed animal
with me when</B>
<BR><B>I went to bed... so after they tucked me in, I would hop out of
bed and grab</B>
<BR><B>handfuls of dolls and place them around me in the bed... a feeble
attempt at</B>
<BR><B>making a stuffed animal</B>
<BR><B>cocoon, thus (or so I had hoped) deterring the thing from poking
me.</B>
<BR><B>Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it didn't... I could never tell
if it was</B>
<BR><B>the same entity that used to trip me in the basement... but its
actions were</B>
<BR><B>similar in that it never wanted to harm me too badly; it just liked
to</B>
<BR><B>frighten and tease.</B>
<BR><B>Well, after a long, unsatisfactory marriage, my parents were divorced
and I</B>
<BR><B>moved with my mom and brother down to Texas to be near my mom's</B>
<BR><B>side of the family. Thankfully I was out of the house, but I still
built my</B>
<BR><B>"shield" of stuffed animals at night, up until I was about to start
junior</B>
<BR><B>high school. Like I said, it had made a lasting impression upon
me... to</B>
<BR><B>this day, I rarely sleep alone with my back to an area of the room
where</B>
<BR><B>someone could walk up and poke me from behind.</B>
<BR><B>I never mentioned the incidents to my mother when I was young, for
I</B>
<BR><B>was sure my parents would say I was dreaming, etc. When I was older,</B>
<BR><B>however, I had mentioned it to her once while we were talking on
the</B>
<BR><B>subject of ghosts and she was dumbfounded by the experiences that</B>
<BR><B>came out of my mouth. She revealed to me that she used to get odd</B>
<BR><B>feelings in the bathroom and kitchen of that house when she was
home</B>
<BR><B>during the day... (while dad was asleep upstairs and the kids were
at</B>
<BR><B>school) Like she was being watched by an unseen presence... particularly</B>
<BR><B>when she would shower. She said she had always chalked it up to
an</B>
<BR><B>overactive imagination or some sort of psychological effect of being
in an</B>
<BR><B>unhappy marriage to my father. I've never asked my brother if he
had any</B>
<BR><B>strange experiences in that house, perhaps I should.</B>
<BR><B>I never got a chance to do any research about the house, to learn
about its</B>
<BR><B>history or previous owners. Now that I'm older, I'd like to do some
digging</B>
<BR><B>and see what I can find about the house (if it's still standing...)</B>
<BR><B>I've had some other encounters when I was older in junior high and
high</B>
<BR><B>school in a house down in Texas, but I think I will save them for
another</B>
<BR><B>time, as this post has become long enough.</B>
<BR><B>If anyone has questions about my experiences or has had similar
things</B>
<BR><B>happen to them, I'd love to hear from you... You can email me at:</B>
<BR><B>sanshouo_ninja@hotmail.com (Of course... if you're going to email
me with</B>
<BR><B>criticism, religious rants, or generally idiotic comments, don't

<BR><B>Night Demons</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sara.jameel@goodrich.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi, I&nbsp; religiously visit your site everyday. I do believe in
ghosts and</B>
<BR><B>spirits but never really had frequent experiences in life expect
a couple of</B>
<BR><B>times. I hope I am able to describe these experiences that I had.</B>
<BR><B>The first personal experience I had was when I was 13 years old
(now I am</B>
<BR><B>27) and at that time&nbsp; we (my family) lived in Jeddah KSA. Now
thinking about</B>
<BR><B>this gives me the creeps, but I didn't realize it at that time for
I was a</B>
<BR><B>kid and didn't think much about it. But this experience has been
imprinted</B>
<BR><B>in my mind for all these years. Now on with my story..</B>
<BR><B>Like I said we lived in Jeddah, KSA.&nbsp; Our was a 4 bedroom apartment
and we</B>
<BR><B>rented out 2 bedrooms of our apartment. My family had the other
two</B>
<BR><B>bedrooms. At that time money was tight for my parents. So we kids
(myself,</B>
<BR><B>my brother and sister) shared one bedroom and my parents had the
other</B>
<BR><B>bedroom. This one particular night (I remember it so clearly as
if it had</B>
<BR><B>happened yesterday)&nbsp; I don't know if this was a dream or what
but I felt</B>
<BR><B>that there was something at the foot of my bed, what saw I could
forget</B>
<BR><B>after all these years. I saw this dark form with red glowing&nbsp;
eyes and evil</B>
<BR><B>grin was at the foot of bed and trying to pull me with my feet,
I felt it</B>
<BR><B>drag me out of my bed with my feet. I tried screaming but could
not, I tried</B>
<BR><B>to wake up my brother who was next to me I could not do anything
I was</B>
<BR><B>terrified. I don't know what happened but I started praying and
as soon as I</B>
<BR><B>had done that it let me go and I was left there dangling from my
bed. As you</B>
<BR><B>know I couldn't sleep for the rest of the night. Now I realize that
if I</B>
<BR><B>haven't prayed on time it would have got me. I never mentioned this
to my</B>
<BR><B>parents until recently, I told this to my mom and she got upset
at why I</B>
<BR><B>haven't told her before when it happened. Maybe she had experiences
too</B>
<BR><B>which I never got a chance to ask.</B>
<BR><B>Now the second experience happened after we (my family) moved to
US. We had</B>
<BR><B>rented out a two bedroom apartment in Memphis TN. Every member in
my family</B>
<BR><B>seemed to have an experience in this apartment except my dad (because
he</B>
<BR><B>left us there and went back to Jeddah). Everyone of us heard the
kitchen</B>
<BR><B>cabinets opening and closing any time during the day. I remember
my mom</B>
<BR><B>waking me up in the middle of the night saying that we might have
a burglar</B>
<BR><B>because she heard kitchen cabinets banging. I had to wake up and
convince</B>
<BR><B>her that nothing was wrong and we would go to the kitchen and find</B>
<BR><B>everything normal and nothing out of place. At first we thought
it was the</B>
<BR><B>tenants who lived below&nbsp; us but we found out that the apartment
was vacant.</B>
<BR><B>At that time nobody paid any attention to this happenings.</B>
<BR><B>But the worst of all that left all of us scared was this one night.
We were</B>
<BR><B>up late at night (sometime after 12:00am) because we had this religious</B>
<BR><B>holiday where we are to stay up and pray at night. We were all up
praying,</B>
<BR><B>it was so quite and we were so much involved in our praying. Then
all of a</B>
<BR><B>sudden out of nowhere, the fire alarm goes off. This scared the
heck out of</B>
<BR><B>us just imagine this going off at this late) we all jumped up expecting</B>
<BR><B>something was burning in the kitchen we checked the whole apartment
and we</B>
<BR><B>couldn't find any smoke that would make it go off. As soon as we
were trying</B>
<BR><B>to locate the cause it stopped, We thought maybe it was a malfunction
and</B>
<BR><B>forgot about it and resumed our prayers and as soon as we were into
praying</B>
<BR><B>that damn thing goes off again. We just couldn't believe what was
happening.</B>
<BR><B>At this time my mom was completely freaking out. This happened for
a couple</B>
<BR><B>more times till we gave up praying. Then we all huddled into one
bedroom and</B>
<BR><B>locked the door because my mom was completely freaked out. I being
the</B>
<BR><B>oldest was surprised at the whole incident and was really pissed
of&nbsp; at what</B>
<BR><B>was happening. Anyways my mom and my sister had few more experiences
there</B>
<BR><B>but I wont get into it now. We moved out of that apartment a couple
of</B>
<BR><B>months later my dad got back. Surprisingly nothing ever happened
when he was</B>
<BR><B>around. Thanks for reading this, and thanks for letting me share
this with</B>
<BR><B>you all.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Ghost story.....</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: WildMage79@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;I decided to write what I had experienced in a different way,
instead of the norm. This is all true, just written in a third-person view.
I will follow this up when I get the time, with a story of my grandmother
and I, as well as some of my child-hood. Might edit this story as well
and add some more description of me and other things.[Words in brackets
are what i was thinking at the time]</B>
<BR><B>A man walked in the darkness. A slight limp marred his stride. A
dull, familiar pain resonating from his knee with each awkward step. A
cold breeze swept through the trees brushing his short brown bangs away
from his eyes. His neck buried deeper into his jacket, a shiver racked
his frail body. [Damn this cold.]</B>
<BR><B>His right arm rose from his pocket and turned towards his body.
His eyes glanced down towards the soft green glow of his watch. The light
illuminated his pale face, making it appear even more ghost-like. The hand
scratched the scrub of his un-shaven chin before darting back to the warmth
of his pockets. [9:00. Shit. Better hurry.]</B>
<BR><B>The man walked faster, the dull pain becoming just a little sharper.
A scowl appeared on his face as he looked towards the reason for his troubles.
[Damn my leg.]The limp became more prominent with each quickened step.</B>
<BR><B>The distant streetlights barely pierced the gloom of the sheltered
path he was walking. The shadows of the swaying branches danced in the
pale glow of the moonlight. He unconsciously walked the path he had walked
so&nbsp; many times before, his mind wandered to a different place. But
it was soon brought back. Something moved off to his right, a bush rustled.
His eyes darted to the source. But there was nothing to be seen but shadows.</B>
<BR><B>A light wind stirred the top branches of the trees. The shadows
dance anew in the glow of the moon. His mind registered a strange pattern
in the dancing. There seemed to be human-like shapes dancing amidst them.
His breathing slowed, he concentrated and listened for anything abnormal
in the darkness. [Nothing.] His aching knee tightened. A queasy feeling
crept into the bowels of his stomach. A buzzing sound echoed in the hollows
of his ears. [This energy feels familiar.] A sinister cloud-like, yet human-shaped,
figure flashed in the recesses of his mind.</B>
<BR><B>The bushes beside him erupted with dirt, leaf, and branches. In
his peripheral vision he caught site of it. Something dark. Something wrong.
The form was cloud-like, but his eyes couldn&amp;#8217;t penetrate its
murkiness. It was huge, the size of a well-built man, a seven foot tall
well-built man. The man couldn&amp;#8217;t tell where the shadows started
and where the creature ended. His body turned towards the oncoming creature,
its red eyes leaving an after mirage in his turning vision. [Shit.] The
creature&amp;#8217;s body hit the delicate chest of the man. Pain exploded
in his mind accompanied by a bitter cold.</B>
<BR><B>His vision dimmed as his limp body slammed into the tree behind
him, arms and legs flailing like a rag-doll. Consciousness slowly slipping
away&amp;#8230; a sharp pain made its way to his mind. Slowly his weakened
head lolled to one side, eyes slowly closing into blackness. Before consciousness
was taken from his grasp, he caught sight of red gleaming eyes staring
at him with intensity.</B>
<BR><B>Consciousness came back to him for a fleeting moment. A sharp pain
originated from his knee, and a tightness worse then before. A dry tongue
crossed over his parched lips. A shaking hand brought itself to his lips
as well. Wetness. Moonlight reflected off a reddish liquid on his fingertips.&nbsp;
[Hmmm. Blood... Night night time.] A smile crossed his stained pale lips,
as the darkness finally took him. He heard laughing.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Cat Place</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: cin_win@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My earliest memory of anything "weird" happening to me was at the
age of two. Many other experiences have happened since, but this was one
of the odder of situations.</B>
<BR><B>My mother and I lived in the basement apartment of an apartment
complex. Being two years of age, I was early to rise. My mother said I
used to wake up with the sun. To curb this habit, my mother covered my
basement window with tinfoil (to keep out the light), in hopes of a few
extra hours of sleep.</B>
<BR><B>One night, I woke up. I don't remember the reason I did but, being
awake I noticed a cat in my window. The strange thing about the cat was
it resembled a cartoon character. Sylvester, the cat on the Bugs Bunny
show you know? Anyways, I see this cat and start screaming. My mom comes
in, turns the light on to find out what went wrong. I yelled "Cat! Cat!"
and pointed at the window. There was nothing there so she kissed me, turned
off the light and closed the door and left.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;As soon as she left, the cat was back. I started to scream
again when it spoke to me. It called me by name and asked me to be quiet.
I was in shock and shut up almost instantly. It told me it would not hurt
me, that it was my friend and was there to keep me safe.</B>
<BR><B>It asked permission to come down and sit with me on my bed. As memory
serves me, I did not contest. I could feel the weight of it as it landed
on my bed. I pet the living cartoon. It had consistency to it and I was
not frightened. He was soft and friendly. I do not know how long he stayed
that night but, I do remember I got a bowl out of the kitchen that my mother
always left in my reach for cereal, filled it with water and brought it
back for him. I fell asleep comfortably to the sound of him drinking. In
the morning, the cat was gone and the bowl was bone dry.</B>
<BR><B>He was there every night after that and I was happy.I had a cat
to love who loved me back. One night he came for the last time.He told
me my mother and I had to go away. It was not good for us to be there anymore.
I didn't understand. I asked if he would come with me. He said he could
not, but that my mother and I would move and I would be safe. I cried at
the thought of leaving him behind. He said it was for the best. I never
saw him again.</B>
<BR><B>The rent went up and my mother could no longer afford to live there
(she told me later) and we moved two weeks later. In the following weeks,
there was a fire in the laundry room and burnt down most of the apartments
including ours. If we were still living there we could of been killed.</B>
<BR><B>My mother does not completely believe me on this. She says a ghost
or cartoon can't hike the rent which forced her out. Or that a ghost can
drink water but, she does remember me waking her up screaming and other
nights she heard me talking in my room. She just automatically assumed
I was talking in my sleep. The weird thing is, that complex was in the
city, we moved to the suburbs, yet at any age, if we were in the city and
she drove past the building, I pointed it out. "Hey Mom, the Cat place".</B>
<BR><B>Seeing as how I am terrible with directions, this always blew her
mind. I swear on my life the cat thing is true. My mom thinks I have an
active immagination and my friends just think I'm freaky.</B>

<P><B>Experiences in New Jersey</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: marisa1116@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have two personal experiences and two recurrent</B>
<BR><B>areas of activity witnessed by many individuals over</B>
<BR><B>an extended period, all of which took place in my</B>
<BR><B>childhood home and the surrounding property, in</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;New Jersey.</B>
<BR><B>Briefly, the main house was a small Cape Cod located</B>
<BR><B>at the front of a 1/2 acre property, while in the rear</B>
<BR><B>was a one bedroom cottage with a shed and workshop,</B>
<BR><B>where my grandparents lived.</B>
<BR><B>My experiences took place in my bedroom, located on</B>
<BR><B>the second floor. My room had an outcove (dormer) with</B>
<BR><B>a window seat facing the street, and one night, when I</B>
<BR><B>was around 8 (1978), I woke up to see what looked like</B>
<BR><B>a gray outline of a woman in a robe walking from the</B>
<BR><B>outcove across the center of my room, directly in</B>
<BR><B>front of the foot of my bed. I panicked and broke a</B>
<BR><B>porcelain table lamp trying to get the light on, but</B>
<BR><B>by the time I looked back, it was gone.&nbsp; She didn't</B>
<BR><B>look at me or seem to notice I was watching her.</B>
<BR><B>The second experience took place about a year later -</B>
<BR><B>it was evening, but still fairly light in the room. I</B>
<BR><B>looked up and saw the outline of my grandfather</B>
<BR><B>standing against the wall opposite my bed, he was</B>
<BR><B>wearing a suit and looking straight at me. About a</B>
<BR><B>year earlier, he had gone to visit my uncle for the</B>
<BR><B>weekend, when a prostate tumor burst. We were very</B>
<BR><B>close and I never got to say goodbye to him, so I</B>
<BR><B>think that's why he came back.</B>
<BR><B>Found out much later, from an elderly neighbor who</B>
<BR><B>lived across the street, that the woman who lived in</B>
<BR><B>the home before us had died of cancer. Her husband, a</B>
<BR><B>doctor, was having an affair with a nurse at his</B>
<BR><B>office, and my neighbor used to see her sitting in the</B>
<BR><B>window seat waiting for her husband to come home at</B>
<BR><B>night.&nbsp; After she passed away, her husband sold the</B>
<BR><B>house, married the nurse, and moved away.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I</B>
<BR><B>suspect that what I witnessed was a replay of a very</B>
<BR><B>sad nightly ritual.</B>
<BR><B>Of the recurrent incidents, I have an explanation for</B>
<BR><B>one, none for the longer lasting and more</B>
<BR><B>disturbing... Sitting next to my grandparents' cottage</B>
<BR><B>was a smallish (10' x 10') rusty metal shed, and for</B>
<BR><B>as long as I can remember we (friends, neighbors,</B>
<BR><B>family) heard violent banging coming from inside of</B>
<BR><B>it. My parents called out animal control thinking a</B>
<BR><B>rabid raccoon was trapped, they called out</B>
<BR><B>exterminators thinking that something might be nesting</B>
<BR><B>inside, and they even called out the gas company,</B>
<BR><B>concerned that there was some sort of leak or pocket</B>
<BR><B>underneath the shed, but nobody ever found anything.</B>
<BR><B>Please understand, that the banging wasn't the</B>
<BR><B>disturbing factor - rather, it was the horrible</B>
<BR><B>feeling you'd get going near that shed. I saw grown</B>
<BR><B>men jog away from it in broad daylight - something was</B>
<BR><B>just very wrong there, and my eyes are tearing up just</B>
<BR><B>thinking about it.</B>
<BR><B>The explainable recurrent experience involved my</B>
<BR><B>grandfather's workshop located directly behind the</B>
<BR><B>shed. He had turned it into a little quiet place where</B>
<BR><B>he'd drill his bowling balls, and after he passed</B>
<BR><B>away, we'd often hear the familiar drop of balls on</B>
<BR><B>the floor.&nbsp; Ironically, and thankfully, after his</B>
<BR><B>death, the banging in the shed and that dreadful black</B>
<BR><B>feeling we got when going near it, lessened</B>
<BR><B>dramatically.</B>

get</B>
<BR><B>grandma and return to the room.Vallie was gone and the back door
was</B>
<BR><B>opened.We looked every where for her.Finally she shows up a couple
of</B>
<BR><B>hours later.We asked her where she went.She said Grandpaw took her
tothe</B>
<BR><B>fair.She did have a ballon.Needless to say we did not belive her
but</B>
<BR><B>grandma did and that fall she moved out of the&nbsp; house because
granddads</B>
<BR><B>spirit would not leave.And still to this day she will not go back
in</B>
<BR><B>that house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My next experience
happened 11 years later.I was</B>
<BR><B>livivg out side of Brigsdale,CO the middle of no where.I had a room
mate</B>
<BR><B>at the time that had 3 kids ,and 2 dogs that where outside animals</B>
<BR><B>only.It all started that winter. I was sleeping one of the couchs
in the</B>
<BR><B>living room Kristian the middle child was on the other around 2am
I hear</B>
<BR><B>some one calling for Kristian I get up and look around I see three</B>
<BR><B>people a man and two women on eith side of him the clothes they
were</B>
<BR><B>wearing were the type worn in the1700-1800s.I told them they should</B>
<BR><B>leave.They vanished.All was calm until that summer .Your in the
kitchen</B>
<BR><B>you have a night light on the east wall.That is in direct sun light
in</B>
<BR><B>the afternoon.It keeps flickering on when there is no shadow in
the</B>

my</B>
<BR><B>hair it is 105 degrees out side no breeze and we did not have a
air</B>
<BR><B>condition.I felt a cool breeze on the back of my neck.And the hair
on</B>
<BR><B>the back of my neck stood on end.I ran out of there.I told the people</B>
<BR><B>who owned the house.They say it is haunted.The house was built on
an old</B>
<BR><B>cematary.I kind of wish they would have told us.They finally sat
down</B>
<BR><B>and told us the history of the land.Thank You for letting me share.I</B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;My Experience with Ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: emrickk @hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>About 2 years ago I lived in a small community called Courtice, ON,
Canada.&nbsp; My one bedroom basement apartment was fairly new and I lived
alone with my two cats, Veronica and Theodore.&nbsp; (Their names are a
whole other story!!)&nbsp; Anyway, my apartment was small with a main entrance
through the kitchen and another entrance through the living room that led
to the backyard.&nbsp; This night was not unlike others, I went to bed
early as I had to be at work early the next morning.&nbsp; I followed my
regular routine, checking the doors, brushed my teeth and settled in to
bed.&nbsp; Later I woke up to hear my cat rushing from one end of the apartment
to the other, and some other unidentifiable noise in the background.&nbsp;
I started to dismiss the noise as part of a dream, but it wasn't fading
away.&nbsp; My cats continued to meow and rush through the house which
is also very strange.&nbsp; My cats only become excited when I have company.&nbsp;
This was company I didn't want!!&nbsp; I started to focus and looked out
my bedroom to door into the livingroom to see what the cats were doing
that had them in such a fit.&nbsp; Instead I saw two figures standing in
my livingroom, looking around and pointing at things.&nbsp; The noise seemed
to become more of a whisper and the sound of my heart and heavy breathing
were quickly drowning out everything else.&nbsp; I didn't move, I just
watched.&nbsp; The figures appeared young; one was a girl and the other
a boy about the age of 15-20.&nbsp; I must have been watching them for
about 5 minutes when the girl suddenly seemed to realize I was there.&nbsp;
She didn't move from her spot, just appeared to lean forward a little and
squint as though she were trying to get a closer look at me.&nbsp; I froze.&nbsp;
That was when she waved at me.&nbsp; I was done for!&nbsp; I jumped out
of bed, turned on the light and ran into the livingroom prepared to confront
whoever or whatever was in my apartment.&nbsp; Nothing was there.&nbsp;
My doors were still locked and I stood in my livingroom alone with my two
cats.&nbsp; I called 911 and reported what I saw.&nbsp; The police came
and checked things out and I'm certain they shared a good laugh when they
left.&nbsp; Nothing like this ever happened again while I lived there.</B>
<BR><B>Strange things have happened to members of my family for as long
as I can remember, but they never happened to me until then.&nbsp; A few
years before that incident I went to see a psychic and she told me I was
surrounded my spirits.&nbsp; I didn't really take her seriously.&nbsp;
I should have because I listened to the tape she made of our session and
she also described my husband and step son who I met years later.&nbsp;
I'm definitely a believer!!</B>
<BR><B>Thanks for listening!</B>

<BR><B>&nbsp; Past Haunting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: LEGLI@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was approximately 2 or 3 years old, I spent a night in the
hospital</B>
<BR><B>for a minor procedure.&nbsp; During the night, I awoke to hear strange
voices</B>
<BR><B>calling my name and trying to get me to come and join them.&nbsp;
I remember</B>
<BR><B>something grabbing at my hand as well.&nbsp; Around the age of I
would say 5 or 6,</B>
<BR><B>I began awakening at night to the same types of voices.&nbsp; They
knew my name</B>
<BR><B>and continually harassed me and kept me from sleeping.&nbsp; Sometimes,
if my hand</B>
<BR><B>happened to fall over the side of the bed, they would grab my hand.&nbsp;
I never</B>
<BR><B>had the courage to actually open my eyes and look to see what was
grabbing at</B>
<BR><B>it.&nbsp; These events would happen only at night and not just in
my bedroom at</B>
<BR><B>home.&nbsp; They also happened when I stayed overnight with my grandparents
who</B>
<BR><B>lived next door.&nbsp; One night, I woke to this horrible panting
and growling</B>
<BR><B>noise.&nbsp; I felt pressure on my chest and couldn't breathe or
move.&nbsp; When I</B>
<BR><B>opened my eyes, I saw a large bull with red eyes on top of me.&nbsp;
I gathered</B>
<BR><B>all the strength I had and finally managed to sit up and after I
did so, it</B>
<BR><B>disappeared.&nbsp; Another night I awoke completely paralyzed to
the sound of</B>
<BR><B>laughter and a threatening voice.&nbsp; After all of these instances,
I used to</B>
<BR><B>scream for my parents.&nbsp; They never heard or saw anything and
thought I just</B>
<BR><B>had an overactive imagination.&nbsp; After awhile, I was afraid
to even admit why</B>
<BR><B>I was screaming for them and when my father would come in the room
I'd just</B>
<BR><B>ask for a drink of water.&nbsp; The voices would taunt me with that.&nbsp;
They'd</B>
<BR><B>torment me for awhile and then say, "Go ahead and ask for a drink
of water</B>
<BR><B>now!" and laugh.&nbsp; It was very frightening.&nbsp; Then, I learned
that a friend of</B>
<BR><B>mine, who lived right across the river from me, was experiencing
the same</B>
<BR><B>type of thing.&nbsp; There was a river that ran behind our house,
with railroad</B>
<BR><B>tracks behind that, and then houses.&nbsp; She lived in one of those
houses.&nbsp; On</B>
<BR><B>nights when they weren't harassing me, I could actually hear them
across the</B>
<BR><B>river harassing her!&nbsp; This continued sporadically until we
reached the age of</B>
<BR><B>around 7 years old.&nbsp; Then everything stopped and we never heard
or saw</B>
<BR><B>anything again even though we continued to live in the same homes
for many</B>
<BR><B>years after that.&nbsp; I have never been able to explain it, and
it still bothers</B>
<BR><B>me to this day.&nbsp; Could it be that we were victims of a haunting?&nbsp;
Could it be</B>
<BR><B>that I attracted the spirits of deceased patients when I was in
the hospital</B>
<BR><B>and they followed me home?&nbsp; Why would all the phenomina just
abruptly end?</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Granddad's Visits</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: a.l.hale@larc.nasa.gov</B><B></B>

<P><B>Two years ago, my partner and I moved into my Grandmother's home
on a</B>
<BR><B>temporary basis to take care of her.&nbsp; She was born in 1918,
and married my</B>
<BR><B>Grandfather in 1936.&nbsp; She and I were never close, but my Grandfather
and I</B>
<BR><B>were.</B>
<BR><B>Granddad served in the Navy during World War II, in the South Pacific,</B>
<BR><B>France and England.&nbsp; He always believed in waking up before
sunrise, and</B>
<BR><B>was up and cooking breakfast every morning by 6:00 am.&nbsp; He
loved swing</B>
<BR><B>music, the music of his youth, and his favorite hobby was gardening.</B>
<BR><B>When my partner and I moved into the house where my Granddad had
died in</B>
<BR><B>1996, we decided to use the bedroom where Granddad had died.&nbsp;
That didn't</B>
<BR><B>bother me--I am from an old family, in whose homestead many family
members</B>
<BR><B>have lived and died.&nbsp; Not long after moving in, we started
to notice some</B>
<BR><B>unusual occurrences:</B>
<BR><B>After we had lived there for about three weeks, I was awakened at
5:30 a.m.</B>
<BR><B>by some voice I couldn't identify.&nbsp; At first, I thought it
may have been</B>
<BR><B>the television and was coming from my Grandmother's room.&nbsp;
I walked into</B>
<BR><B>the hallway, and knew that it was coming from the living room.&nbsp;
When I</B>
<BR><B>walked into the living room, I discovered that the sound was coming
from an</B>
<BR><B>alarm clock on the sideboard.&nbsp; The alarm was set for 5:30 a.m.,
had not</B>
<BR><B>been touched in weeks, and had not gone off before.&nbsp; I thought
nothing of</B>
<BR><B>the event, until the following night, when my partner and I were
awakened</B>
<BR><B>at about 3:00 a.m. by the sound of the storm door creaking open,
a key in</B>
<BR><B>the deadbolt lock, and the heavy wooden door being opened and then</B>
<BR><B>shut.&nbsp; We heard heavy footsteps crossing the living room, and
heading into</B>
<BR><B>the kitchen.&nbsp; I got up, sure that someone was in the house.&nbsp;
I looked into</B>
<BR><B>the living room, and noticed that the front porch light was on</B>
<BR><B>(motion-detector).&nbsp; Our two cats, who are shy around others,&nbsp;
were standing</B>
<BR><B>in the hallway looking towards the kitchen; not afraid, just curious.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>said "who's there?" loudly and when I received no response, I checked
out</B>
<BR><B>the rest of the house.&nbsp; There was no one there.&nbsp; This
happened several</B>
<BR><B>times throughout our stay in the house.</B>
<BR><B>The most amazing occurrence was on December 7.&nbsp; At about 9:00
pm, we were</B>
<BR><B>in the back of the house reading, when we heard the sound of drums.&nbsp;
At</B>
<BR><B>first, we thought it was someone in the neighborhood playing loud</B>
<BR><B>music.&nbsp; When we opened the window, however, we heard no music.&nbsp;
We checked</B>
<BR><B>to see if my Grandmother's television was on in her bedroom, but
it</B>
<BR><B>wasn't.&nbsp; We walked into the hallway, and the music was coming
from the</B>
<BR><B>den.&nbsp; As we walked closer to the den, we discovered the music
was Gene</B>
<BR><B>Krupa's Drum Boogie.&nbsp; The music stopped when we got to the
den.&nbsp; How</B>
<BR><B>fitting for my Granddad's spirit to be playing Drum Boogie on December
7.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;Shakesphere.....</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: gsauceda@excite.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>In 1972, my husband and I purchased our first new home. After 2
or 3 years I noticed a pinching sensation on my butt everytime I walked
down the hallway. Months later I always seemed to be missing my hairbrush
or other things from my makeup table minutes after I had just used them.
I would backtrack, only to find them in unusual places later such as the
refrigerator.</B>
<BR><B>I would mention the\is to my husband or children and they would
look at me as is I was losing my mind.</B>
<BR><B>One evening as we all slept, we jumped out of our skins as we were
blasted into awakeness at the loud sound of music. This started happening
almost every night and always at midnight or a a minute past.</B>
<BR><B>As we all sat in the livingroom watching T.V., the kitchen light
came on and then it shut off. My husband looked at me, and then towards
the children, and back at me again. He asked, "Did you see that?" I just
said, "M-hm."</B>
<BR><B>He said, "but we are all in here in the same room! And that light
came on and off by itself!" I told him I have been telling him that but
he always made me seem as if I was crazy.</B>
<BR><B>This ghost, I named him Shakesphere, got to toying with me; pinching
my butt, hiding my things and then replacing them, and sometimes I could
see shadows of him in the hall. I got so used to having him around and
he never hurt anyone.</B>
<BR><B>One night after I went to bed, I felt someone moving me at me shoulder
and calling my name. I thought it was my daughter, and I ignored it. I
felt it again, and again I heard my name called to wake up. I yelled out,
"What!" and as I awoke, I saw my candle was melting onto my stereo lid
and had caught on fire on the entertainment center. I had fallen asleep
with the candle lit. I put out the fire, and saw I was alone in the bedroom.
I checked on the kids and they were fast asleep, and my husband was in
th livingroom watchiing T.V. I belive that Shakesphere alerted me to the
fire. I had. asked my husband and he said he was in the LR the whole time.</B>
<BR><B>My granddaughter also saw a dog that trapped her in the bedroom
barking at her she said, yet no one else could see or hear the dog even
though we could see she was looking at something and crying. My younger
daughter had seen a woman in black, and a child going from room to room
as well.</B>
<BR><B>I believe Shakesphere got bold one day as I half lied on the couch
as my son and his wife were talking to me, and I felt someone's hand go
up my skirt and squeezed my butt making me gasp and jump! My son looked
at me and asked me what was wrong, and my daughter in law looked&nbsp;
at me and asked the same. I didn't know what to say.</B>
<BR><B>As the years passed, they got a little bolder around my friends
and family members just being pranksters. Sometimes they could smell a
very sweet odor. Once as I laid in bed feeling very lonely, and I felt
the weight of someone get on top of me, and just held me with arms covering
mine. I even felt his breath on my hair. Not once did I feel threatened.
I just felt comfort. I felt that until I slept.</B>
<BR><B>I just recently sold my home after 29 years. I wonder if moved too,
or should I have told the new owners?</B><B></B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;It Followed Me</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Spooky753@cs.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>had a paranormal experience at my part-time job (first ever!!) and
then it followed me home.&nbsp; This spirit remained in my home for several
months and then disappeared.</B>
<BR><B>To be brief.......I must have angered whatever it was at my part-time
job.......I was supervisor at a call center.........earlier in the evening
I was talking to one of the call takers.....there was a storm coming up
and somehow we started talking about ghosts........later that evening when
it was very slow......only a few call takers spread out down in front of
me..........the magic marker I use to post hourly stats flew by my head......I
had just finished using it and had placed it back on the magic marker board.......I
mean the marker HURLED past me @ 90 miles an hour.....I pulled my head
away and thought "was that a bird in here?".&nbsp; Well you know how a
baseball flies past a player so fast......you can't really see it but you
can tell it is white and round.......well I thought......of my.......whatever
it was looked round a cylinder shaped........I didn't see where the marker
had landed but somehow I just knew that it had landed in the bag that I
carry everywhere with me........I got up and looked and sure enough.....there
was the marker laying right in the middle of the clothes that were in my
bag.....I looked back and the marker on the board was gone!!!!</B>
<BR><B>The next week at work.....I happened to be typing on the computer
and for some reason I looked down ( supervisors sit up on a little platform
in this huge room overlooking call takers), I looked down and the momenet
I did I saw, just for an instant, legs......from the knees down.......black
boots on.......step up on platform and stand directly facing me......only
for an instant did&nbsp; I see this......but I distinctly saw it.......three
weeks later my boyfriend hollers to me out of bedroom.....he was lying
in bed watching TV........out of the corner of his eye he saw what appeared
to be a black arm (from the elbow down) and it knocked on of the chains
hanging down from celling fan......by the time I got to the room......the
chain was slowing down...but it was still swinging back and forth......my
boyfriend said it knocked it so hard it was swinging back and forth like
a pendulum.&nbsp; After that.......stero would come on in the middle of
the night......noises all over the house.........things moved.....boyfriend
placed a pair of sock on the bed....turned around to get another pair out
of the drawer....when he turned back around socks had moved to the floor......etc.&nbsp;
those types of things.....fortunately it is gone......no sign for over
a years.</B>
