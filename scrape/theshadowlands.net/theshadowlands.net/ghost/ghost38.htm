</H3><P><B>by rudym@attnet.or.jp</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was little, my Dad was stationed at Loring AFB, in Maine, (it
is</B>
<P><B>now closed).  This was back in the mid to late sixties, and when we</B>
<P><B>moved on base our new home was a multiplex apartment building.  The</B>
<P><B>family who lived next door to us, the husband had a heartattack in
the</B>
<P><B>downstairs bathroom,  the wife came over and got my Dad, and he</B>
<P><B>performed cpr on him but he died.  I'm not sure how much time passed</B>
<P><B>but, the family moved out and another moved in.  My mother and Mrs.</B>
<P><B>Cruise, (who's family moved in) became friends and she would come
over</B>
<P><B>and have coffee and chit-chat with my Mom.</B>
<P><B>One day she came over and was talking to my mother and she said that
her</B>
<P><B>apartment was haunted.  My mother had never told her that a man had
died</B>
<P><B>in there before she moved in, so she just asked Mrs. Cruise what made</B>
<P><B>her think that it was haunted.  She told my mom that she knew that
a man</B>
<P><B>died in her bathroom, Mom was shocked and asked how she knew that,
she</B>
<P><B>told her that when she went in the downstairs bathroom she would see
him</B>
<P><B>lying in the floor.  Mom was shocked and asked what he looked like
and</B>
<P><B>she said just a black misty thing, and that when her kids were at
school</B>
<P><B>someone would roll a ball down the stairs!  Well, that's it, they
never</B>
<P><B>really talked much about it after that,  I wish everyone who has had
a</B>
<P><B>weird experience in on base housing would tell their stories, I'm
sure</B>
<P><B>there would be many</B>

<P>
<P><B> 6 years ago I was with two friends of mine.We were walking up the
end a</B>
<P><B>road talking about childhood,growing up,our fears and dreams.While
talking </B>
<P><B>we walked in front of an old empty house  (it had been empty for
about</B>
<P><B>20years).As we walked by it we saw what looked like fire flies in
each</B>
<P><B>window each a different color.We then looked around to try to figure
out if</B>
<P><B>it was a reflected light we were seeing or if it was coming from inside
</B>
<P><B>the house.(the moon was not out it was cloudy that night) We were
standing</B>
<P><B>in the road and when we started walking toward the house.We all heard
a</B>
<P><B>noise behind us a sort of buzzing noise (like a bottle cap spun off
your</B>
<P><B>fingers).Suddenly a black ball like form went over our heads toward
the</B>
<P><B>house,we thought  it to be an owl or something.Then we heard the same
type</B>
<P><B>of noise behind us in the woods a whirling sound.Just then a yellow
ball 6"</B>
<P><B>or 7" in diameter came a foot and a half from our heads  toward the
house</B>
<P><B>by that time we were out of there. The very next day I was going to
work</B>
<P><B>with my girlfriend (who is my wife now).We were traveling down route
2 in</B>
<P><B>Wendell,MA ,when I saw what looked like a deer in the woods the eyes</B>
<P><B>reflecting back at us.So I slowed the car down to about 40mph careful
not</B>
<P><B>to hit it if it came over the guardrail.We were roughly 50'from it
when it</B>
<P><B>came across but it wasn't a deer .It was a little blue light almost
like</B>
<P><B>liquid light,a small 2"ball.I've never seen anything move so fast in
my</B>
<P><B>life,back and forth fromthe other side of the road.I never told my
girl</B>
<P><B>friend about the night before she might think that I was crazy. I
thought</B>
<P><B>it was just me that had seen it .She said did you see that and I said
see</B>
<P><B>what.She described it to me,It was the same thing I saw .To this day
I</B>
<P><B>don't  know what it was .It was a little more than coincidence it was
twice</B>
<P><B>in two days ,and with witnesses.Two weeks later the house burned
down.Three</B>
<P><B>years after the first experience, Curt(one of the friends I went with
the</B>
<P><B>first time),another friend and I went to the same place to see if it
could</B>
<P><B>happen again.As soon as we hit the property line we got this chill
up the</B>
<P><B>back of our legs.When that happened I told Curt to start talking about
the</B>
<P><B>same topics as three years ago.About two minutes later the other
friend</B>
<P><B>thought he saw a dark shadow cross in front of us,neither me nor curt
saw</B>
<P><B>anything.Maybe 4or 5 minute went by.So then I told curt to go back
to the</B>
<P><B>same story when Tim thought he saw something.Suddenly we heard a voice
it</B>
<P><B>sounded 100' away a loud whisper it said"hey hi"and about 3 seconds
later</B>
<P><B>we heard it again but 6' in the woods to our left.We turned around
and got</B>
<P><B>out of there,Tim is  too paranoid anyway.Curt and I are still interested
in</B>
<P><B>it.We both have had alot of the same paranormal experiences together
at</B>
<P><B>least 20 different times.And I think that when we had that other
person</B>
<P><B>things might have happened.I mean we may have got into a different
mindset</B>
<P><B>accepting the unknown like a child would, and the stories gave us</B>
<P><B>flight.Who knows? The place is still active the are still cold spots
in the</B>
<P><B>road at night.I've ordered some Infared film to try to see what might
be</B>
<P><B>there.We are still very curios to what happend there in the past. 
   </B>
<P><B>  Thank you very much hope to here from someone</B>

<H3><A NAME=room>Ghost in My Room</A>
</H3><P><B>by jmacmill@bcinternet.com</B>
<P>
<P><B> When I was young, about six or seven I expereinced several ghost</B>
<P><B>sightings. My bed used to face the hallway and I remember and not why
but I woke up and</B>
<P><B>looked down the hall. I recall a white transparent shape floating down
the hall. I</B>
<P><B>can't remember who it looked like because believe me it wasn't for
very long. My head went</B>
<P><B>under my covers as quick as it went out. After a bit I looked again
and this time it</B>
<P><B>was closer. &nbsp;Minutes later I looked again to see it by my brother
on the other side of</B>
<P><B>the room. Once &nbsp;again it was duck and cover. The next time I looked
up it was over me and</B>
<P><B>well that was enough for this six year old and of course run and scream
into mom and dads</B>
<P><B>room. &nbsp;I recall this happening several times including seeing
a red and black</B>
<P><B>hunting jacket going down the hall. Over time I've tried to bring reason
to these sighting</B>
<P><B>and my only explanation to the event if any was that this was my
grandfather</B>
<P><B>overlooking &nbsp;is grand kids. He died before I was born and They
had the property behind ours. </B>
<P><B>My father &nbsp;also related a story of a presence in the garage of
his parents years</B>
<P><B>before this. Its one of those things that unless you actually experience
it , it's not</B>
<P><B>really real. I still wonder to this day.</B>

<H3><A NAME=girl>The Little Girl</A>
</H3><P><B>by BGL@qconline.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>I've read several of the stories on your site, and this one probably
sounds</B>
<P><B>familiar--but I thought I'd add it to your collection.  When I was
12 years</B>
<P><B>old (15 years ago) I was babysitting for a friend of my mothers, and
had</B>
<P><B>planned on spending the night since she had planned on being out late.
 I</B>
<P><B>don't know what time it was, or why I even woke up, but when i did
(I was</B>
<P><B>sleeping on the couch), the figure of a young girl, roughly 5 or 6
years</B>
<P><B>old appeared before me.  I immediately became frightened, becuase I
was</B>
<P><B>babysitting two young boys.  The girl didn't appear to be menacing
at all,</B>
<P><B>in fact she was rather pretty.  She was however, dressed in what I
can only</B>
<P><B>refer to as "Little House on The Prarie" clothes, complete with bonnet.
</B>
<P><B>She had long blond hair, braided down both sides, and all she did was
smile</B>
<P><B>at me.  I was terrified, and rubbed my eyes thinking I was having some
sort</B>
<P><B>of waking nightmare, but when I opened them, she was still there. 
The next</B>
<P><B>thing I did was put my blanket over my head, and chant "please go
away"</B>
<P><B>over and over again.  After a few minutes that felt like hours, I
removed</B>
<P><B>the blanket and she was gone.  This is the only experience I've ever
had</B>
<P><B>with the paranormal, but I thought you might be interested.  </B>

<H3><A NAME=spirits>Spirits</A>
</H3><P><B>by pookied@hotmail.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>I have never written this down because I didn't think anyone would
take </B>
<P><B>me seriously.  I came arcoss your web site by accident.  I as looking
</B>
<P><B>for Halloween poems to share with some students of mine.  (Purely 
 for </B>
<P><B>entertainment only)  Well I have had some experience with what I believe
</B>
<P><B>are spirits or a spirit.  I moved into a third floor apartment in </B>
<P><B>August, 1994.  I began to experience things in 1995.  Please remember
I </B>
<P><B>am new at this and I'm still skeptical.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My first episode occurred around 11:15-11:30 pm.  I was reading as
I </B>
<P><B>always do at that hour.  I was propped up on two pillows.  My cat was
on </B>
<P><B>my bed with me and was lounging.  She then sat up and began looking
at </B>
<P><B>the ceiling.   I thought maybe she had spotted a moth or a fly but
there </B>
<P><B>was nothing.  her eyes began to dart about and she then jumped off
the </B>
<P><B>bed.  I resumed my reading.  A few minutes later, while I was still
</B>
<P><B>reading, a very soft, gentle, and cool, (not cold) breeze came over
my </B>
<P><B>left arm.   There was not a window open, a fan on, or anything that
can </B>
<P><B>explain the soft breeze.  It was actually comforting. I went to bed
and  </B>
<P><B>didn't experience any more until a few months later.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Around the same time at night, I as reading, propped up on my pillows,
</B>
<P><B>my cat was in the den, I felt something on my bed with me.  I thought
it </B>
<P><B>was my cat's paws, but no she wasn't there.   It was as if someone
had </B>
<P><B>placed their hand on the side of my leg.  It was very light and </B>
<P><B>non-threatening.  But I really felt strange.  I began to think then,
</B>
<P><B>that maybe this was a ghost or spirit.  I began telling some of my
</B>
<P><B>co-workers to get their opinion.  I then began to notice that when
I </B>
<P><B>would turn on my tv it would turn off right away. This happened for
</B>
<P><B>awhile.  I attributed that to electronics.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Another situation that really bothered me occurred on a Thursday evening
</B>
<P><B>in November of 1996.   I went to the grocery store just 2 minutes away.
 </B>
<P><B>When I came back the door to the crawl space above the kitchen was
wide </B>
<P><B>open.  It looked as if someone had moved it.   In order for it to be
</B>
<P><B>moved (it was located on the ceiling) would be for someone to push
up on </B>
<P><B>the wood and push it over.  I was fascinated and was getting spooked.
  </B>
<P><B>It was winding the whole night and I figured that the wind had something
</B>
<P><B>to do with the dorr being moved.  It had never happened before or since
</B>
<P><B>then.   That really didn't seem to make sense.  i often try to </B>
<P><B>rationalize situations such as this but this really made me wonder.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The last and probably the scariest for me occurred this year in March.
 </B>
<P><B>It was around 6:30 pm and I was making dinner.  My sister phoned me.
 </B>
<P><B>While I was trying to cut up peppers and talk to her at the same time
i </B>
<P><B>realized I couldn't do both.  I put down the small paring knife on
the </B>
<P><B>counter and walked into the den.   When I walked back into the kitchen
</B>
<P><B>the small knife was in the kitchen floor.  It looked as if someone
had </B>
<P><B>thrown it on the floor.  I know to this day that I placed the knife
on </B>
<P><B>the cutting board away from the edge.  My cat was not in the kitchen
and </B>
<P><B>I knew that this was something.  I remember getting off the phone and
</B>
<P><B>just standing there looking at the knife.  i tried to recreate the
knife </B>
<P><B>in the floor by dropping it several times.  It never stuck.   I'm sure
</B>
<P><B>there's a rational reason.  Well that night I decided to "talk" to
</B>
<P><B>whomever this may be.  I said " I'm not afraid  to live in this </B>
<P><B>apartment."  I also said that "I was sorry if anyone did them wrong
in </B>
<P><B>anyway and that doing things like this didn't really bother me."  I
was </B>
<P><B>telling the truth about (75%)  I was very calm.  I thought maybe this
</B>
<P><B>spirit, it it were a spirit was a young woman or even a young girl.</B>
<P>
<P><B>In June 1997, I experienced my last episode.  I was moving out from
my </B>
<P><B>apartment and had packed everything except some necessities.  I was
</B>
<P><B>sleeping on the floor in the den, (I had no bed, couch etc.)  It was
</B>
<P><B>about. 2:00 am when I sprang up and noticed I was bleeding on my right
</B>
<P><B>arm.  It was a perfect 2 inch incision.  What it could have been i
don't </B>
<P><B>fully know.  I went into the bathroom and noticed that I had 4-5 spots
</B>
<P><B>of blood.  They turned out to be small punctures.  I thought for sure
</B>
<P><B>that it was my cat.  He was necx to me when I woke up but he looked
as </B>
<P><B>if he were surprized as well.  i immediately checked his paws to see
if </B>
<P><B>he had any blood on them. He didn't.   This did scare me.   I have
a </B>
<P><B>scar on my right arm and still don't understand what it was.  It it
was </B>
<P><B>my cat, what was he thinking.  (My other kitty I mentioned couldn't
</B>
<P><B>handle living there anymore.  I took her back to my parents in January.
 </B>
<P><B>She was destroying the entrance door.  This kitty who was with me in
</B>
<P><B>June is my male kitty)  Anyway, one week later I was completely moved
</B>
<P><B>out and have never forgotten those experiences.  I'm sure there must
be </B>
<P><B>some explanation for some of those things, but in a way, I believe
</B>
<P><B>someone else was there with me.   may she was angry that I was leaving.
 </B>
<P><B>I was good tenant; very calm and peaceful.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I hope this doesn't sound like jibberish.  I really felt weird at times.
 </B>
<P><B>I have read several storied and realize others have had very BAD </B>
<P><B>experiences with spirits and felt their lives were in danger.  I never
</B>
<P><B>really felt that at all.  I did have a dream that scared me though.
  I </B>
<P><B>hope someone can tell me whether these can or cannot be rationalized
or </B>
<P><B>explained.</B>

<H3><A NAME=blue>George and the Blue Lady</A>
</H3><P><B>by gates.7@osu.edu</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have been reading the collection of stories here for some time, and</B>
<P><B>finally I decided to pass on mine.  This story has been told to</B>
<P><B>countless of my friends and family- and of course freaked them all
out.</B>
<P><B>:)</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am a firm believer that there are things beyond our experiences,
and</B>
<P><B>that sometimes they cannot be explained by science.  The following
story</B>
<P><B>is an experience that I had, as well as others in my family.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The first story is about the Blue Lady........</B>
<P>
<P><B>Our farmhouse was built in 1894.  We bought the place, after the
death</B>
<P><B>of the most recent owners in 1975.  Of course, my  parents felt the
need</B>
<P><B>to remodel, and bring the house up to code.  For a while the house
was</B>
<P><B>in disarray - and weird things began to happen.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My father was sitting in the living room watching the television, we
he</B>
<P><B>caught movement out of the corner of his eye.  He said to his best</B>
<P><B>recollection it was an older woman, dressed in blue running from the</B>
<P><B>kitchen to the bathroom.  He was shaken, but dismissed the incident.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Not to long after that my mother, sitting in the same location saw
the</B>
<P><B>same woman run from the bathroom to the kitchen.  My mother described</B>
<P><B>her in the same way that my father had, adding that she was able to
see</B>
<P><B>the windows and the wall through the woman as she dashed across the</B>
<P><B>room.</B>
<P>
<P><B>After the remodeling was completed neither of my parents can remember</B>
<P><B>seeing the woman again.</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B> A Story About George..........</B>
<P>
<P><B>Strange occurrences in our farmhouse were becoming commonplace.  We
had</B>
<P><B>just resigned ourselves to the fact that the house was haunted, and</B>
<P><B>lived with it.  We had a frequent visitor whom we called George.  We</B>
<P><B>assumed it was a man, that is just how the presence "felt".</B>
<P>
<P><B>The summer between my freshman and sophomore in college I was waiting</B>
<P><B>tables, and working many hours.  One morning I awoke at 4:11 a.m. and</B>
<P><B>saw the figure of what appeared to be a man in a trench coat standing
at</B>
<P><B>the foot of my bed.  Still in waitress mode I asked "Can I help you?"</B>
<P><B>and the figure rushed at my face.  My heart pounding I frantically</B>
<P><B>turned on the light and looked around the room.  I was alone.  For
the</B>
<P><B>rest of the summer I continued to wake up once or twice a week at
4:11</B>
<P><B>a.m. ....and always the same occurrence.  It got to the point that
I</B>
<P><B>refused to look at the end of the bed, and took to sleeping with the</B>
<P><B>light on.  I thought I was cracking up, just working too many hours
I</B>
<P><B>figured.  I told no one about the incidents.</B>
<P>
<P><B>That fall my parents split up, and my mother took to sleeping in my</B>
<P><B>room.  She called me at college and we were having one of our weekly</B>
<P><B>chats, when she mentions - quite calmly- "Did you have any 'trouble'</B>
<P><B>sleeping in this room before you left?" - I asked her to clarify her</B>
<P><B>question and she said - "Well, I keep waking up at 4:11 a.m. in the</B>
<P><B>morning to see a dark man standing at the end of my bed, and then</B>
<P><B>suddenly he rushes at my face."  Needless to say I almost dropped the</B>
<P><B>phone.  I wasn't the only one- my mothers friend, who has since</B>
<P><B>succumbed to cancer- experienced the same.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Other than the unnerving feeling of being rushed at and watched, we</B>
<P><B>never really felt in any danger.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My Aunt and Uncle have now purchased the farmhouse, and renovated it</B>
<P><B>back to it's original state when it was built in 1894.  My Aunt won't</B>
<P><B>sleep in the room in question, but says she does here creaks and
groans</B>
<P><B>in the floor, but figures it is the natural pine floors, but I have
a</B>
<P><B>feeling it is George checking things out and making sure that
everything</B>
<P><B>is okay........</B>

<H3> <A NAME=do>I do Believe!</A>
</H3><P><B>by anonymous</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi I just had to add to your page some true accounts!  I won't
mention</B>
<P><B>names for privacy.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The house was in Carencro, Louisiana and it was my step-uncle's.
 Every</B>
<P><B>summer I'd go spend a few weeks up there with my cousin.</B>
<P><B>First off, this is what happened to them before I had my own</B>
<P><B>experiences.</B>
<P><B>My Aunt was washing her hair at the kitchen sink and my cousin was</B>
<P><B>sitting at the table reading.  Well my Aunt stood erect and said,
"Oh,</B>
<P><B>did *Mark* just come in here?"  My cousin told her no, and it wasn't</B>
<P><B>him.  What had happened was that she felt someone come up behind her
and</B>
<P><B>wrap their arms around her waist, which her husband usually did.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Another time my guy cousin was in the Kitchen late at night fixing
a</B>
<P><B>bowl of cereal and he heard someone shout, "Get out the kitchen!" 
His</B>
<P><B>step-dad didn't like him going to the kitchen all hours of the night,
so</B>
<P><B>my cousin thinking that it was his step-dad yelling at him took off
to</B>
<P><B>the bedroom.  The next day he asked if he's step-dad had been up
around</B>
<P><B>the time and found out that he was sound asleep at the time.</B>
<P>
<P><B>On other occasions the "Ghosts" loved my female cousin.  She seemed
to</B>
<P><B>get their attention the most.  One night her ceiling fan fell.  Other</B>
<P><B>times she heard voices, her mother too heard voices. They said it
always</B>
<P><B>sounded like a woman and man yelling at each other.</B>
<P><B>One day my Aunt walked in and found my cousin sleeping on the floor
and</B>
<P><B>she asked her why, The night before and it happened on a couple of</B>
<P><B>occasions something threw her out of her bed against the wall.  Now</B>
<P><B>usually it just pulled her out the bed, but she eventually opted for
the</B>
<P><B>floor once it threw her against the wall.</B>
<P><B>Now, my Aunt and her children told my step-uncle time again about
these</B>
<P><B>events and he just shrugged it off.  Till one night a ball of light
shot</B>
<P><B>in front of his face and hovered then flew off and disappeared. After</B>
<P><B>cussing and freaking out he asked my Aunt who was laughing, "Did you
see</B>
<P><B>that?!"  She was laughing more out of relief because he had finally</B>
<P><B>seen, other than that she was pretty scared about what was going on
in</B>
<P><B>the house.</B>
<P><B>Now my Aunt and my cousins never told me about these things but, when
I</B>
<P><B>would go visit I felt like someone was watching.  Eery Feeling,</B>
<P><B>sometimes I felt all the hair on my arms and neck stand up.  One day
I</B>
<P><B>was walking down the hallway which had a mirror at the end.  As I was</B>
<P><B>approaching my Uncle's bedroom to get my cousin, I noticed a black
mist</B>
<P><B>hovering behind me over head.  I turned around to get a better look,
but</B>
<P><B>nothing was there!  When I looked back into the mirror it was still</B>
<P><B>there staying still until I moved on, every step I took it followed.
 I</B>
<P><B>tried not to think to much about it, I told myself my imagination was</B>
<P><B>getting the best of me (Please remember I still did not know of the</B>
<P><B>occurences going on in the house!)  Well a couple of years later my</B>
<P><B>cousin and I decided to stay at the house for the night.  No one was</B>
<P><B>there.  </B>
<P><B>When we went to bed, house locked up and alarm on. There was a loud</B>
<P><B>knock at the bedroom door!  Three times it pounded.  I shook my
cousin</B>
<P><B>and in a frantic whisper I asked, "Did you hear that?  Someone's in
the</B>
<P><B>house and their knocking at the door!"  She covered her head and told
me</B>
<P><B>it was the refrigerator.  Now after spending plenty of summers there
and</B>
<P><B>knowing good and well what the refrigerator sounded like when dumping</B>
<P><B>ice, I grabbed at her arm and said, "You know that's not the
freezer!"</B>
<P><B>She asked me to please go to sleep.  I could not I felt like static</B>
<P><B>energy covered my skin.  The next day after leaving the house and
being</B>
<P><B>very tired, my cousin told me about everything that had happened. 
I</B>
<P><B>have never ever ever been back to that house.  I probably would go
back,</B>
<P><B>but then again...I reeaally don't have a reason to!</B>

<H3><A NAME=say>He Needed to Say Good-bye </A>
</H3><P><B>by IDA-TEX@WORLDNET.ATT.NET</B>
<P>
<P><B> Six years ago, my daughter's boyfriend, "R.", was killed in a
terrible</B>
<P><B>automobile accident; he was very young, not quite 19 years old.  He
&amp; my</B>
<P><B>daughter had a 9 month old baby boy &amp; R. had worked hard to
overcome</B>
<P><B>problems borne of youth &amp; immaturity so they could finally be together
as a</B>
<P><B>family.  Days before the accident, he decided to start attending church
&amp;</B>
<P><B>just hours before he died, he had been hired for a new job, which was
to</B>
<P><B>start the next morning.  Elated, he called my daughter to tell her
the</B>
<P><B>wonderful news, but she wasn't home. </B>
<P><B>   R.died at 9:00 p.m.  At 9:00 p.m., our phone rang; no one was there.
</B>
<P><B>Also at 9:00, a picture fell off the wall, crashing to the floor. 
That was</B>
<P><B>only the beginning...</B>
<P><B>   One of his mother's friends reported that, though she didn't learn
of</B>
<P><B>his death until the next day, she heard R.'s voice crying &amp; calling
out to</B>
<P><B>her constantly during the night. She was confused &amp; frightened,
as she was</B>
<P><B>definitely awake at the time.</B>
<P><B>   My older daughter also heard him call out to her.</B>
<P><B>   A few days after the funeral, my husband heard a young man's voice</B>
<P><B>coming from the baby's room, saying "Hey, little dude!", which was
a</B>
<P><B>nickname R. used frequently for the baby.  He also heard the jingling
of</B>
<P><B>what sounded like car keys.  He couldn't figure out who it could be,
so he</B>
<P><B>threw the door open; there was no one there, except the baby, standing
up</B>
<P><B>in his crib, giggling, arms stretched upward toward empty air, as if
he'd</B>
<P><B>been waiting for someone he loved to pick him up.       </B>
<P><B>   The next day, my daughter heard someone walking down the hall in
the</B>
<P><B>direction of the front door, car keys jingling.  She was
apprehensive,</B>
<P><B>because of the things that had already happened.  She went into the
hall &amp;</B>
<P><B>sure enough, no one was there &amp; the door was still locked &amp;
latched from</B>
<P><B>the inside.</B>
<P><B>   Many more things like this continued to happen, until one night
my</B>
<P><B>daughter saw R. She was in bed, when she looked up &amp; there he
was,</B>
<P><B>"floating" toward her, smiling all the while.  His figure floated
toward</B>
<P><B>her until it was directly above her, at which point R. leaned over
&amp;</B>
<P><B>"kissed" her.  She was terrified at the time, but now finds what
happened</B>
<P><B>comforting.     </B>
<P><B>   After that, the visits stopped.  We've pretty much decided that
R. just</B>
<P><B>wanted to say good-bye.  He was so young &amp; died unexpectedly; we
think he</B>
<P><B>just wasn't ready to let go.  </B>
<P><B>   As a footnote to this, my grandson, who is now 6 years old,
mentions</B>
<P><B>from time to time how "I wish daddy would come &amp; visit me at night
like he</B>
<P><B>used to".     </B>

<P>
<P><B>Ghosts and ghost tales seem to follow my mother's side of the family
like a</B>
<P><B>faithful friend. There is nothing friendly about this stuff, however!
My</B>
<P><B>great-grandmother is a living archive of the family ghosts. Here is
one of</B>
<P><B>the spookier true tales she related....</B>
<P><B>My great-grandfather died many years ago, after an extended illness,
I</B>
<P><B>believe. In his last moments, Granny (my great-grandmother) and her
daughter</B>
<P><B>took turns watching over him. One day when Gan-Gan (the family's
nickname</B>
<P><B>for my great-grandfather) could hardly breathe and Granny and Grandma
knew</B>
<P><B>he was about to die, Grandma was called away into town suddenly. She
didn't</B>
<P><B>want to leave, but the business in town was vitally important, and
she</B>
<P><B>didn't think she would be gone long.</B>
<P><B>Not long after Grandma had left, Granny was sitting in the living
room,</B>
<P><B>which was by the bedroom Gan-Gan lay in. Suddenly she heard a loud
flapping</B>
<P><B>and tapping coming from the bedroom. She rushed to open the bedroom
door and</B>
<P><B>saw outside the closed bedroom window a large gray dove frantically
beating</B>
<P><B>at the window, trying to get in. Now, an old Southern superstition
(we live</B>
<P><B>in Alabama) is that when a bird tries to enter a house through the
window,</B>
<P><B>it is a sign of death. Granny ran into the kitchen and grabbed the
broom,</B>
<P><B>then went back to the bedroom to try to scare the bird off. Being
very</B>
<P><B>superstitious, she knew she couldn't let it get in the house. But when
she</B>
<P><B>entered the bedroom again, the dove was perched on the headboard of</B>
<P><B>Gan-Gan's bed where he lay sleeping, right over his head! Mind you,
the</B>
<P><B>bedroom window was still closed, and Granny says that there was no
other</B>
<P><B>opening anywhere in the house where the bird could have entered.
Besides</B>
<P><B>that, she had closed the bedroom door behind her when she went to get
the</B>
<P><B>broom, and the window was the only other way to enter the room. Granny
was</B>
<P><B>so shaken that she didn't try to scare off the bird; she backed out
of the</B>
<P><B>bedroom and closed the door again, then sat outside on the porch to
wait</B>
<P><B>until Grandma came home.</B>
<P><B>While she was outside waiting, their 3 dogs suddenly ran to Gan-Gan's</B>
<P><B>bedroom window and sat under it, barking and howling with their fur</B>
<P><B>bristling. When Granny tried to enter through the front door to see
what was</B>
<P><B>going on in the bedroom that made the dogs act up, they darted over
to the</B>
<P><B>porch and stood in front of the door, still growling, and wouldn't
let her</B>
<P><B>enter the house. </B>
<P><B>She stood there staring at the dogs for about fifteen minutes, until
Grandma</B>
<P><B>came home. When Grandma came near the porch, the dogs suddenly stopped
their</B>
<P><B>ferocious blocking of the door and reverted to their normal friendly
selves.</B>
<P><B>Granny told Grandma what happened after she'd left for town. Nervously,
they</B>
<P><B>decided to go see Gan-Gan. They went into the bedroom, and when they
opened</B>
<P><B>the door, the bedroom window was still closed, but the dove was gone!
When</B>
<P><B>they neared the bed to check on Gan-Gan, they were shocked to see that
he</B>
<P><B>had died in his sleep. At that moment, they heard what sounded like
heavy</B>
<P><B>footsteps coming from the attic directly overhead. The only door to
the</B>
<P><B>attic was in the closet in that very bedroom, the door of which was
tightly</B>
<P><B>shut. They opened the door and ascended the attic stairs. There was</B>
<P><B>absolutely no one in there when they peeked out into the attic from
the</B>
<P><B>steps, and the footsteps had stopped. When they inspected the attic
closer,</B>
<P><B>all they found was 3 fresh gray dove feathers on the dusty floor. Now</B>
<P><B>remember that the door to the attic was tightly closed; there was no
way for</B>
<P><B>the dove to enter either room from the other room!</B>
<P><B>Needless to say, Granny and Grandma got the out of the house as fast
as</B>
<P><B>possible, and stayed with friends while they arranged Gan-Gan's
funeral.</B>
<P><B>They bought a new house and demolished the old one immdiately following
the</B>
<P><B>funeral. There are many more true tales of my family's ghosts, but
they'll</B>
<P><B>have to wait till later.... :)</B>

<H3> <A NAME=guest>Uninvited Guest</A>
</H3><P><B>by kheadley@dave-world.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>Rob and June were living in a small apartment with their two small</B>
<P><B>children. They were looking for a larger place when they heard about</B>
<P><B>this big two story house that was coming up for sale. The elderly owner
</B>
<P><B>had passed away and the heirs were going to sell the house, complete</B>
<P><B>with the contents. This would be an ideal solution to their housing</B>
<P><B>situation. They contacted the people and made a quick deal. They were</B>
<P><B>soon the proud owners of this huge old house.</B>
<P><B>   Soon after they moved into their new home, Rob's high school
alumni</B>
<P><B>was getting together for a class reunion. Rob and June were going to</B>
<P><B>host this event. All of the former classmates showed up and they had
a</B>
<P><B>great time. All but one of the couples. The wife of one of the</B>
<P><B>classmates wasn't feeling well so she and her husband excused
themselves</B>
<P><B>and they left the party.</B>
<P><B>   The men had settled in the living room and the women gathered in
the</B>
<P><B>kitchen. Suddenly the back door opened and someone entered the grade</B>
<P><B>line entrance. From the back door entrance you can go straight down
to</B>
<P><B>the basement or take a few steps up to a door leading into the
kitchen.</B>
<P><B>Footsteps were heard climbing the steps leading to the kitchen and
then</B>
<P><B>stopped. Thinking that the husband of the absent couple had
returned,all</B>
<P><B>eyes turned toward the kitchen door. No one entered. The women jumped
to</B>
<P><B>their feet and ran into the living room and told the men what had
just</B>
<P><B>taken place. The men went into the kitchen and opened the door. No
one</B>
<P><B>was there. Their first thought was that some one was playing a trick
on</B>
<P><B>them. They searched the basement and found nothing. Whoever it was,
is</B>
<P><B>gone now, they decided.</B>
<P><B>   Eventually the party broke up and everyone went home. Rob had a</B>
<P><B>little too much to drink so June decided to sleep in one of the other</B>
<P><B>bedrooms. Rob hung his pants on his bedpost and crawled into his bed.</B>
<P><B>June removed her evening gown and laid it neatly acros the cedar
chest</B>
<P><B>at the foot of her bed. Both were asleep immediately.</B>
<P><B>   Rob awoke the next morning to find his pants across the room and</B>
<P><B>crumpled up on the floor. His first thought was that he had been
robbed</B>
<P><B>by the mysterious intruder from the night before. Checking his pants,
he</B>
<P><B>discovered that his money was not missing. He went to June's room to</B>
<P><B>wake her up. They were shocked to find June's gown on the floor and
the</B>
<P><B>contents of the cedar chest strewn all around the bedroom. They were
now</B>
<P><B>convinced that someone entered the house, waited until all was quiet
and</B>
<P><B>intended to rob them. Nothing was missing so this became a mystery.</B>
<P><B>   Rob was a member of a group of friends that met almost every
Thursday</B>
<P><B>night and played poker. A few weeks after the mysterious incident had</B>
<P><B>almost been forgotten, Rob was attending his Thursday night poker
game.</B>
<P><B>June had tucked the children into bed and was going to take a hot
bath.</B>
<P><B>As she was relaxing in the tub, she heard the back grade line door
open</B>
<P><B>and close. She figured that Rob was coming home early so it didn't</B>
<P><B>surprise her. The footsteps came through the kitchen, through the
living</B>
<P><B>room, through the hall and stopped right outside the bathroom door.
If</B>
<P><B>it was Rob, he would have spoken or would have entered the bathroom.</B>
<P><B>Jane is becoming frightened by this time. She is afraid to move or
make</B>
<P><B>any noise so she sits quietly in the tub until the water is starting
to</B>
<P><B>get cold. She does not know what or who is on the other side of the</B>
<P><B>bathroom door and wishng that Rob woud come home soon.</B>
<P><B>   Eventually Rob comes home only to find June sitting quietly in the</B>
<P><B>bathtub full of cold water. She tells her story and Rob thinks there
is</B>
<P><B>a prankster involved. Several odd things happened after that and they</B>
<P><B>always seemed to happen on a Thursday evening. Rob figures that
whoever</B>
<P><B>is bothering them knows that he is gone to his poker game and takes
this</B>
<P><B>opportunity to frighten June.</B>
<P><B>   Rob devises a plan. He will drive his car to the poker game and
then</B>
<P><B>have someone bring him back home creating the illusion that he is not
at</B>
<P><B>home. He is going to catch this guy and administer some home town</B>
<P><B>justice. His bed is located next to an upstairs window that looks out</B>
<P><B>upon the grade line entrance that seems to be where the intruder
always</B>
<P><B>starts from.</B>
<P><B>   Rob has a 38 caliber revolver and a heavy duty flashlight which
he</B>
<P><B>places on the night stand beside his bed. June is going through her</B>
<P><B>normal routine and Rob is waiting for something to happen. Rob must
have</B>
<P><B>drifted off to sleep. He awakened suddenly to find himself lying on
his</B>
<P><B>stomach, heavy sweat (or blood) running down the back of his neck and
a</B>
<P><B>guy standing over him looking closely at the back if his head. Rob's</B>
<P><B>first thought was that this guy has hit him on the head and is
looking</B>
<P><B>to see if there is any further movement. If there is, he will finish
the</B>
<P><B>job.</B>
<P><B>   Rob knows thaat his pistol and flashlight are within easy reach
but</B>
<P><B>he will have to move fast because this guy is almost on top of him.
With</B>
<P><B>one quick move Rob throws his arm toward the night stand intending
to</B>
<P><B>grab the gun and hit this guy on the head. His fingers close upon the</B>
<P><B>flashlight instead. No time to search for the gun, the flashlight
will</B>
<P><B>have to do. With a continuing motion he comes down hard on this guy's</B>
<P><B>head. Expecting a contact with a solid object, namely this guy's
head,</B>
<P><B>he is surprised to feel nothing as the flashlight passed through the</B>
<P><B>object standing there. He was dumbfounded as his arm buried itself
deep</B>
<P><B>into the soft mattress. As Rob looked at the figure it seemed to be
a</B>
<P><B>gray mist that he could see through. It stood there for a few seconds</B>
<P><B>and then seemed to suck itself, like a funnel, down to the size of
a</B>
<P><B>quarter and then disappear into the wall.</B>
<P><B>   Rob and June have now become aware of what they are dealing with.</B>
<P><B>Other than frightening them a few times, no harm was ever directed
to</B>
<P><B>them. The only thing that really bugged them after the above
occurances</B>
<P><B>was the attic light. It was always on. They would turn it off and
soon</B>
<P><B>thereafter it would be on again.</B>
<P><B>   Rob investigated the situation and made a discovery that he thinks</B>
<P><B>explains what took place. The old gentleman that lived in the house,</B>
<P><B>until his death, had farm land and a substantial amount of money.
Upon</B>
<P><B>his death, his heirs liquidated all of the assets of the estate and
went</B>
<P><B>through it in a remarkably short time. This old fellow had spent his</B>
<P><B>entire life building an estate which was destroyed almost immediately</B>
<P><B>after his death. Rob figured that this soul was upset at the way
things</B>
<P><B>went and was hanging around not knowing what else to do.</B>
<P><B>   Rob and June eventually purchased  June's faamily homestead and
sold</B>
<P><B>their big home. The people that now own it have had no unusual</B>
<P><B>experiences.</B>

<H3><A NAME=house>The House</A>
</H3><P><B>by chipperrox@loop.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>On a more serious note, the main reason I literally got on the
internet</B>
<P><B>with the sole purpose of ghosts on the brain, was becasue of a house</B>
<P><B>that I visited.  I will tell you a little about what my background
is as</B>
<P><B>well as my familys, and the background of the house.  Please try and</B>
<P><B>help me figure this out... I am very seroius.</B>
<P>
<P><B>In our family, about 5 of us have seen ghosts.  It was really when
my</B>
<P><B>mom and her parents and her siblings lived in a house that was haunted.
</B>
<P><B>My mom has seen the ghosts of an old couple standing at the foot of
her</B>
<P><B>bed before, and my grandfather has seen and heard a little girl ghost</B>
<P><B>crying.   My grandmum has also seen the ghost of a deceased family</B>
<P><B>member before... and all in that same house.  Although that was 25+</B>
<P><B>years ago, a few recent incidents have come up.  About 1-2 yrs ago,
my</B>
<P><B>aunt and family bought a house.  One night, only a few weeks maybe
a</B>
<P><B>couple of months after they moved in, my aunt was awakened in the
middle</B>
<P><B>of the night.  She glanced at the foot of her bed and saw a faint
white,</B>
<P><B>short figure leering at her.  She assumed it was her 10 yr old
daughter</B>
<P><B>and said to the figure in a harsh tone, "What do you want?"  The
figure</B>
<P><B>kept on staring at her for a few moments, and then slowly dissapated
and</B>
<P><B>flew out of the window.  This was the last incident in the family,
but</B>
<P><B>it seems that my mother and I have this feeling we get whenever we
enter</B>
<P><B>a house... that we can tell if its haunted or not.  Numerous times
we</B>
<P><B>have been touring Open Houses and we have both felt the presence of
the</B>
<P><B>supernatural.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Now, on to the house.  I really don't know that much about it, but
it</B>
<P><B>is  a very old mansion.  It is located on the grounds of a small,</B>
<P><B>Catholic, all-girls school in So. Calif.  It is called "The Villa".
</B>
<P><B>There was once nuns living in the house, but when the school no
longer</B>
<P><B>employed them, they all moved out.  Those were the last inhabitants
of</B>
<P><B>the house.  Now it is mostly used for movies.  I have heard stories
that</B>
<P><B>a doctor who treated TB patients used to live there, and he kept them</B>
<P><B>all in the basement of the house.  It is rumored that some died down</B>
<P><B>there.  I also recently learned that the villa has the first working</B>
<P><B>elevator in california.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Just a few days ago, my mom and me and a few of my friends went in.
 We</B>
<P><B>felt an eerie presence in there and it seemed to us that the elevator</B>
<P><B>might be haunted.  The basement also was too frightening for me to</B>
<P><B>venture down in.  There are a few trap doors and secrest passages in</B>
<P><B>there, but none of them are accessable.  I really want to find
evidence</B>
<P><B>of ghosts living there... but its impossible to stay the night of
after</B>
<P><B>4pm.  I wanted to bring a tape recorder in and see what I could get
in</B>
<P><B>the late afternoon.  What do you think I should do?</B>

<H3><A NAME=man>The Man in My Room</A>
</H3><P><B>by bowling@iwk0.attnet.or.jp </B>
<P>
<P><B>My first of two experiences happened when I was 12 years old living
in my</B>
<P><B>parents home just outside of Washington D. C.  One night, I was
sleeping</B>
<P><B>peacefully in a room that I shared with my sister.  Something awakened
me</B>
<P><B>from a dead sleep.  I looked towards the door and saw a figure
standing</B>
<P><B>there.  I couldn't scream or anything, as much as I wanted to.  I just
lay</B>
<P><B>there looking at this figure, which I couldn't quite make out.  After
about</B>
<P><B>20 seconds or so, I pulled the covers up over my face hoping that it
would</B>
<P><B>go away.  It didn't.  I, for some reason, could see it through the
sheet</B>
<P><B>coming towards me.  It seemed to disappear from sight when it got beside
me</B>
<P><B>so I pulled the sheet away from my face.  Upon doing this, I was
almost</B>
<P><B>scared to death because the figure was standing right beside me.  It
gently</B>
<P><B>touched my forehead and then left.  I still couldn't scream or anything
so</B>
<P><B>I lay there awake for awhile, with the covers over my head.  In the</B>
<P><B>morning, I told my mom about the happening, and she was shocked.  She
said</B>
<P><B>she had had a similiar experience not long before.  We never really</B>
<P><B>discussed it again.  Many years after that happening, I got married
and</B>
<P><B>moved away.  During a party one night, some friends and I were
discussing</B>
<P><B>"ghost stories" and I brought the story up.  After the party, my
husband</B>
<P><B>asked if it were a true story.  I told him it was and he acted as if
he</B>
<P><B>wasn't quite sure he believed me.  He was later made into a believer.
</B>
<P><B>During a trip home for Christmas, my husband decided to retire to our</B>
<P><B>bedroom, at mom's before I was ready for bed.  I stayed out in the
den</B>
<P><B>watching T.V., and like so many times during my youth, I fell asleep.
I was</B>
<P><B>awakened very suddenly by a feeling and looked to my right.  There
crouched</B>
<P><B>down about 5 feet from my recliner was what looked to be a man.  He
was</B>
<P><B>approximately 25-30 years old with dark hair, and a mustache.  He was</B>
<P><B>grinning at me.  It wasn't a malicious grin, but one like he was happy.
 I</B>
<P><B>was frightened out of my mind.  I started backing up in the chair and</B>
<P><B>trying to scream.  He just disappeared.  I then ran into the bedroom,</B>
<P><B>crying and frightened.  My husband was shocked, to put it lightly.
 He</B>
<P><B>decided he needed to check out the house.  He did and found
everything</B>
<P><B>secured.  When I explained everything to him, he seemed a bit more
able to</B>
<P><B>believe.  We've discussed this several times and feel that it is a
guardian</B>
<P><B>angel.  It has appeared to my sister, my mom and me.  I'm the only
one who</B>
<P><B>could make out a face, but we've all had several experiences.  </B>

<H3><A NAME=white>The White Lady</A>
</H3><P><B>by Chupapez@mx1.wport.com </B>
<P>
<P>     <B>On the year 1991, I moved into a new house at bellevue Washington
and</B>
<P><B>it was a nice cosy house.   After about 1 year after moving into it
I</B>
<P><B>started to see stuff that was quite strange.  Like I would be coming
home</B>
<P><B>and look inside of my window and see something white floating in my</B>
<P><B>kitchen.  I didnt know what it was at first but about 1 week of seeing
it I</B>
<P><B>finally saw it kinda close up and it had a face, but no legs. it just</B>
<P><B>floated there.  Later I would see it just fly down my hallway which
was</B>
<P><B>really wierd.  Then my dad saw it and later my mom saw it and so we
all</B>
<P><B>decided to call it the white lady. </B>
<P>
<P><B>   Then about 1 year ago (1996), I didnt see the white lady for a while
and</B>
<P><B>started to see a tall shadow walking around in my house.  So I would
freak</B>
<P><B>out a lot.  But one night the shadow started to come in my room while
I was</B>
<P><B>trying to sleep and then I saw the white lady run past and pull the
shadow</B>
<P><B>away and from then and on I never saw either of them again.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>   We asked the past owner about it and he said that he could contact</B>
<P><B>spirits and he said that he contacted a mother that was trying to find
her</B>
<P><B>2 boys that died under my maple tree in my back yard.  And that she
was sad. </B>
<P>
<P><B>  So we came to the conclusion that the white lady was the lady that
was</B>
<P><B>looking for her kids!!  </B>

</H3><P><B>by DaveGrohl14@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>My name is Lance.  I am 14 years old.  I am very interested in</B>
<P><B>ghost and paranormal things.  I had not had any major paranormal
things</B>
<P><B>happen to me until I was about 13.  One night  I woke up for some odd</B>
<P><B>reason.  For some reason the bathroom light was left on and my room
was</B>
<P><B>slightly lominated.  Well anyways I had just woke for no perticular</B>
<P><B>reason when I looked  up towards my door I saw a small figure.  It
was</B>
<P><B>about three feet tall and had no features.  It was very skinny.  It
was</B>
<P><B>very frightning</B>
<P><B>The only thing I could make out of the figure was it had dark hollow</B>
<P><B>eyes.  The sight of the figure scared the beejesus out of me.  For
about</B>
<P><B>ten minutes I hid under my pillow.  Then I realised how long I had</B>
<P><B>waited for something like this to happen and I desided to take a
look.</B>
<P><B>When I got out of bed the figure did not respond to my movement.  It</B>
<P><B>just stood there.   I went over to the figure.  It was not so scary
up</B>
<P><B>close.  I ran my hands through it and everything.  It was pretty
cool!</B>
<P><B>All that time it still never paid any attention to me at all.  It was</B>
<P><B>like I was not even there. After a while I went to my bed and layed
back</B>
<P><B>down.  The figure was still there.  It did not bother me anymore.</B>
<P><B>Eventually I went back to sleep.  When I woke up it was gone.  I have</B>
<P><B>not heard anything from it since then.  I told my dad and little
brother</B>
<P><B>and sister, Lacretia and Jared. They all believed me.  I have not yet</B>
<P><B>told my Mom and Step-Dad about it and it was there house it happened
in.</B>
<P><B>I hope you will beleive me.</B>

<H3><A NAME=grandmother>Grandmother's House</A>
</H3><P><B>by catkins@aksi.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I didn't used to believe in the paranormal.....but now I do. In
August</B>
<P><B>of 1996, I went to spend the night at my grandmothers house. People
had</B>
<P><B>always told me stories about the house, but I didn't believe them.</B>
<P><B>Nobody ever wants to stay the night there....I figured out why.My</B>
<P><B>grandparents go to bed considerably early ( 10:00). I got to pick
which</B>
<P><B>room I got to stay in, since it is a very old house and has seven</B>
<P><B>bedrooms. I picked the room that was beside the screened in patio and</B>
<P><B>the attic stairs. ( The attic has 2 tiny bedrooms in it). I spent an</B>
<P><B>hour and a half reading a book. At about 11:30, I turned out the</B>
<P><B>lights,  and laid in bed staring out the window that faced the woods
(</B>
<P><B>The house is up in the mountains in the middle of the woods.) It was
a</B>
<P><B>hot summer day so I had no covers on the bed. At about 12:00 I feel</B>
<P><B>something reach and grab my waist. I felt like a huge hand! It
wrapped</B>
<P><B>itself around my waist and pulled across the bed, slaming me into the</B>
<P><B>wall. I look around the room and nothing was there. The bed was
against</B>
<P><B>the wall, so nobody could have pulled me in that direction without
being</B>
<P><B>on the bed. While I'm looking around the room, a light catches the</B>
<P><B>corner of my eye. At the doorway there was a cluster of little round</B>
<P><B>balls that were bright white and spinning very fast. Then all
together</B>
<P><B>they begin to move out of the doorway and to the right. ( To the
right</B>
<P><B>was the attic stairs) I could hear footsteps moving slowly up the</B>
<P><B>stairs, then the attic door open and shut. Then I heard footsteps</B>
<P><B>walking around upstairs and I could see the roof of the room shaking
a</B>
<P><B>little. There was silence for awhile and then a
snap/click/slam......and</B>
<P><B>then footsteps again and then another snap/click/slam. My
grandparents</B>
<P><B>heard it too. They came into my room just as scared as I was. We all</B>
<P><B>went upstairs to investigate and nothing was there. But the windows
that</B>
<P><B>always remain open, that nobody had touched, had been shut and
locked.</B>
<P><B>While we were standing there a gust of wind came by. ( The windows
were</B>
<P><B>still shut) After that I fainted and at about 7:00 in the morning,
after</B>
<P><B>none of us getting any sleep, I WENT HOME. I never would stay the
night</B>
<P><B>there again. I  hear stories about what still happens there. But this</B>
<P><B>time I BELIEVE THEM!</B>

<H3><A NAME=apartment>The New Apartment</A>
</H3><P><B>by rev_susan@yahoo.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>I had just moved into an apartment, which was upstairs from a very</B>
<P><B>elderly man (who owned the house).  It was a charming place, although</B>
<P><B>I didn't have a private entrance (I had to walk thru his house to get</B>
<P><B>to the stairs).  I started fixing it up by painting the kitchen
first.</B>
<P><B> I had just finished and left to go visit my sister while the paint</B>
<P><B>dried.  When I returned I found every door opened:  the pantry, the</B>
<P><B>cupboards, the stove!  Now, my apartment was locked up tight, I made</B>
<P><B>sure of that as I had no private entrance.  I didn't think much of
it</B>
<P><B>until I found that every time I left the apartment (I could have been</B>
<P><B>gone for 1 minute or 1 hour, didn't matter) all the doors would be</B>
<P><B>open!  If that wasn't scary enough, every night at 2 am precisely,</B>
<P><B>there was knocking on my bedroom wall right behind my headboard!  Of</B>
<P><B>course, I thought it was my elderly landlord signalling for help, so
I</B>
<P><B>went downstairs to check on him....sound asleep!  You can bet I
didn't</B>
<P><B>live there long!</B>
<P>
<P><B>Another incident happened when my husband and I had moved in
together.</B>
<P><B> It was the middle of the night and we were both sound asleep.  I was</B>
<P><B>awakened by the sound of the answering machine beeping and it sounded</B>
<P><B>like someone was leaving a message, but who would be calling us in
the</B>
<P><B>middle of the night?  I opened my eyes to check the machine...no</B>
<P><B>messages, but standing in the bedroom door was a portly man, looked</B>
<P><B>like Fred Mertz from I Love Lucy, smoking a cigar...I could smell the</B>
<P><B>smoke!  I asked him who he was and he said "Fred", smiled at me and</B>
<P><B>walked away.  I looked down the hall and he was gone!  In the morning</B>
<P><B>I told my husband about it and he said it was his grandfather, who's</B>
<P><B>name was Fred, and he has passed away in the 1960's.  My sister lived</B>
<P><B>in the downstairs apartment and she repeatedly heard footsteps coming</B>
<P><B>from our apartment...problem was, we weren't home!!  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Thank you for allowing me to share my stories...I have many, many of</B>
<P><B>them!  I have been encountering spirits since I was 3 years old.</B>

<H3><A NAME=road>Ghosts Along the Road</A>
</H3><P><B>by vensel@isrv.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was  young I went to visit my friend who lived out in the
country.</B>
<P><B>She lived on a lone country road where there was only about three
others</B>
<P><B>house around and her house was near a big cemetary.  She and I went
to</B>
<P><B>visit her friend who lived about a half mile up the road.  Before
leaving</B>
<P><B>the house her mom told us to call home so her brother could go after
use</B>
<P><B>and walk us home because it was one of those pitch black nights.  We
called</B>
<P><B>him and he said he would be up there shortly.  We waited for a time
then</B>
<P><B>went out when we saw a young man standing along the side of the road.
 We</B>
<P><B>walked a half mile talking to him and laughing.  I thought it was
strange</B>
<P><B>this normally talkative twenty year-old man  who constantly teased
his</B>
<P><B>sister  and I was so quiet.  That is, until we reached her house and
her</B>
<P><B>brother came out onto the porch demanding to know who we were walking
with.</B>
<P><B> We turned and the man was gone.I was frightened but my frient wasn't.
 Her</B>
<P><B>house was right beside the dirt road that led to the cemetary and she
said</B>
<P><B>that was not the first time she encountered  ghosts along the road.
 She said </B>
<P><B>she often saw an old man and woman walking down the road together.
 She knew </B>
<P><B>they were ghosts because she could see right thru them!  Her mother
also </B>
<P><B>encountered spirits along that road.</B>

<H3><A NAME=strange>Strange Supernatural Incidents</A>
</H3><P><B>by &nbsp;whiz@i-cafe.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi... I have experienced some strange supernatural incidents over the</B>
<P><B>years which I believe are unexplainable. After reading your story I</B>
<P><B>thought I would share mine. Keep in mine that my story is not as
scarey</B>
<P><B>as yours but it is definetely something that should interest you.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The first "strange incident" occurred when I was 3. One night I
dreamt</B>
<P><B>about a woman named Gloria with pale white skin and long dark
hair...Now</B>
<P><B>that it is 20 years later my memory is a little fuzzy but here's what
I</B>
<P><B>recall. She wore old fashioned clothes (18th century?) and sat
swinging</B>
<P><B>on a swing. The next thing I remember was that she was dead laying</B>
<P><B>underneath a tree. I felt enormous sadness for her and I woke up
crying.</B>
<P><B>From then on vaguely I remember her kneeling by my bedside talking
with</B>
<P><B>me. </B>
<P>
<P><B>After that for about a year my parents would hear me singing in the</B>
<P><B>middle of the night. When they asked me, why was I singing? I would
tell</B>
<P><B>them "Gloria told me too." Also when my parents would call me by my
name</B>
<P><B>which is Erica I would stubbornly tell them my name was not Erica but</B>
<P><B>Gloria. </B>
<P>
<P><B>This went on till I was 5, but I would not have another incident with
a</B>
<P><B>"spirit" until I was 16. This time it would be frightening.</B>
<P>
<P><B>It was a weekend night, 3 AM to be precise... and my house was dark
and</B>
<P><B>empty (my mom was at her boyfriend's) So I asked two of my friends
Amy</B>
<P><B>and Eric to spend the night. </B>
<P>
<P><B>As we lay in our beds...let me paint you a picture of how the scene</B>
<P><B>looked. I was in my bed and my bedroom door was right behind my head.</B>
<P><B>Amy and Eric slept in sleeping bags down below me. I was almost
asleep</B>
<P><B>when I suddenly felt scared. I then leaned my head back and became
stiff</B>
<P><B>with fear. The door knob was moving. I blinked...was this really</B>
<P><B>happening. I wanted to yell! to scream to do something! but I was
frozen</B>
<P><B>with fear. Within a few seconds the door began to open, yet I was</B>
<P><B>paralyzed. Suddenly there stood a big black shadow (6ft or taller)</B>
<P><B>lurking above me. It was then that my animal instinct caved in. I
began</B>
<P><B>to scream at the top of my lungs. And lo and behold so did Amy! She
saw</B>
<P><B>the whole thing! And she was screaming too! We jumped out of bed to
grab</B>
<P><B>something to hit this "thing" with. (Eric by the way was asleep)</B>
<P><B>Meanwhile, it ran away and by the time we got to the living room, it
was</B>
<P><B>gone. After the panic subsided we checked all doors and windows and
they</B>
<P><B>were locked. More strange things would not happen for a few years but</B>
<P><B>when they happenned they would be closer together in time.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next incident is one that made me very mad because no one
believed</B>
<P><B>me. This happened 1 year ago.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I call it the "key story"</B>
<P>
<P><B>Ok now I am 22 and living in my own apartment in another city with
2</B>
<P><B>friends. Feeling incomplete when I don't know where my keys are since
I</B>
<P><B>use my car a lot to drive to school, I always leave them in a place</B>
<P><B>where I can easily find them. </B>
<P>
<P><B>One day in December I came home from classes and found I had an hour
to</B>
<P><B>take a quick shower before my next class. Nobody was home and since
I am</B>
<P><B>very cautious of my safety, I locked the door. I then placed my keys
on</B>
<P><B>the kitchen counter. After I got out of the shower I felt a strange</B>
<P><B>feeling. I looked on the counter for my keys and they were gone! I
was</B>
<P><B>in total shock, I was totally positive  that this was where I left
them.</B>
<P><B>However, I proceeded to look for them and missed my class. And that
day</B>
<P><B>never found then. </B>
<P>
<P><B>A few hours later when my roommates came home, I asked them if they
had</B>
<P><B>come in and taken my keys. They said no. So, when I told them what
had</B>
<P><B>happenned they just laughed and said I misplaced them. They then
began</B>
<P><B>to look all over the apartment. We particularly tore my dresser
apart,</B>
<P><B>dumped everything out. Nothing!</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next day no keys....And I am very mad that I can't drive to
school.</B>
<P><B>I am also a little afraid. So that night once again I tear the house</B>
<P><B>apart looking for them...but still nothing!</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next day came (now it had been 2 days and still no keys) So here
I</B>
<P><B>am calling a locksmith to come and make me a car key (I only had the
1)</B>
<P><B>and I am very upset. After getting a price I went into my room and
sat</B>
<P><B>on the bed wishing the keys would appear. I looked around my room saw
my</B>
<P><B>empty dresser which now just had a little mirror sitting on top of
it</B>
<P><B>(since I had taken everything off it) and cried. I was so
frustrated...</B>
<P>
<P><B>After I calmed down I went into the kitchen to get something to drink</B>
<P><B>(remember my roommates are once again gone) I then went back into my</B>
<P><B>bedroom and there sitting in the middle of my dresser were my keys!!!
I</B>
<P><B>couldn't believe my eyes, I thought I was hallucinating. </B>
<P>
<P><B>The last couple incidents I will tell briefly since this story is
going</B>
<P><B>on and on. 1 month ago my boyfriend and I were sitting on my bed
talking</B>
<P><B>about how much we cared for each other. My music box then opened and</B>
<P><B>began to play it's tune which is "it had to be you"</B>
<P>
<P><B>The last incident occurred 2 weeks ago where the oven timer went off
at</B>
<P><B>4 in the morning. (remember these can only be set for an hour)</B>
<P>
<P><B>So that's basically my story. Let me know what you think. My own
belief</B>
<P><B>is that certain people attract spirits (for what reason I do not
know)</B>
<P><B>And I think I have attracted a few.</B>

<H3><A NAME=shower>Ghost Shower</A>
</H3><P><B>by pooh@recorder.ca </B>
<P>
<P><B>I am not one to believe in hauntings but this one event happened to
me</B>
<P><B>last spring at my parents ranch house. My parents were going on a
trip</B>
<P><B>and they asked me to stay at the ranch and babysit their dog so as
they</B>
<P><B>wouldnt have to place her in a kennel. I agreed anxiously because I
live</B>
<P><B>in a small two bedroom apartment with my boyfriend and our son. The
day</B>
<P><B>I arrived at the ranch with my son the strange occurances began. I
had</B>
<P><B>put my son down for a nap and decided to take a shower. When I was</B>
<P><B>finished in the shower I was putting my hair in a ponytail and I felt
a</B>
<P><B>presence behind me. All of a sudden the shower turned on all by
itself</B>
<P><B>producing a full blast of hot water. I turned around and let go of
the</B>
<P><B>ponytail and it fell to my shoulders than I felt something around my</B>
<P><B>head and my fallen ponytail began it rise straight up from my head.
I</B>
<P><B>ran to the shower and turned it off and ran out of the bathroom</B>
<P><B>screaming so loud my son woke up. I grabbed him and ran from the
house</B>
<P><B>(by the way did I meantion I am the biggest chicken in the world?).</B>
<P><B>Anyways I went to my neighbours and he came back to the house with
me</B>
<P><B>and inspected everything in the house paying careful attention to the</B>
<P><B>shower and the plumbing. He suggested that seeing how I was so scared</B>
<P><B>that he would turn the water off in the house and I would sleep there</B>
<P><B>just one night and take the dog to the kennel in the morning. Later
that</B>
<P><B>night I was in bed sleeping with my son next to me and the dog at the</B>
<P><B>foot of the bed. I began to hear the dog whining and I sat up in bed
to</B>
<P><B>see what was wrong. Just as I sat up I heard the shower turn on in
the</B>
<P><B>bathroom which is adjacent to the bedroom. I went into the bathroom
and</B>
<P><B>the shower was giving out a full blast of hot water. I went to the
main</B>
<P><B>pipe and sure enough it was closed off. I grabbed my son the dog and
my</B>
<P><B>car keys and left the house and did not return until my parents came</B>
<P><B>back. Freaky huh?</B>

<P><B>Emirates in the Middle East.  I visited your site 7 months ago.  I</B>
<P><B>really enjoyed it very much and here I am visiting it again.  Here
in</B>
<P><B>the UAE we have many ghosts stories and they are true coz I lived
some</B>
<P><B>of them.  We have a city in UAE called Al-Ain and it has many</B>
<P><B>ghosts/spirits and I heard lots of stories that happened there so if</B>
<P><B>anyone would like to hear it just e-mail me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Anyway .. I'm the only one in my house that saw ghosts/spirits.  It</B>
<P><B>began when I  was 9 years old.  I was sleeping with my mother that</B>
<P><B>night and I woke up to see a small black shadow near the bedroom
door.</B>
<P><B> It looks like a young boy and it was looking at me.  I thought that</B>
<P><B>it was my younger brother who was 3 years old at that time, so I kept</B>
<P><B>calling his name and then my mom woke up and asked me who am I</B>
<P><B>calling, so I told her can't you see my brother? He is standing right</B>
<P><B>near the door!! And when she looked she saw nothing and she told me</B>
<P><B>that I was dreaming but I swear that I saw it and it was so real. 
A</B>
<P><B>couple of years after that I woke up at 2:30 in the morning.  I</B>
<P><B>couldn't go to sleep after that.  I felt that someone was in my room</B>
<P><B>but I couldn't see it.  My sister Hissa was in a deep sleep so she</B>
<P><B>didn't feel anything.  The door was shut but suddenly it was opened</B>
<P><B>very fast and hard also.  I waiting for someone to come in but know</B>
<P><B>one did and I put the cover on my face and started reading some</B>
<P><B>phrases from the "Holy Quran" in my heart and after 5 minutes I took</B>
<P><B>the guts to see what is happening and there was nothing.  Just for</B>
<P><B>your information I'm a Muslim and just like the "Bible" we have the</B>
<P><B>"Quran". </B>
<P>
<P><B>Anyhow .. one day, at 9pm I was going toward my sister's bedroom to</B>
<P><B>get something from there and when I entered her room it was so dark</B>
<P><B>but I could see everything because of the light that comes from the</B>
<P><B>window.  So I saw a black shape of a man that was sitting on the edge</B>
<P><B>of the bed and was starting to wear a sock.  I stood there for a</B>
<P><B>second with my eyes opened wide from fear and when he looked at me
I</B>
<P><B>shut the door quickly and ran to my mother to tell her what I saw.
</B>
<P><B>That night I was so afraid to sleep alone so I went to my mothers
room</B>
<P><B>and slept near her on the bed.  I didn't sleep actually because I was</B>
<P><B>so scared.  I kept hearing a young baby crying. The voice was coming</B>
<P><B>from the door.  I felt that someone was getting closer to me and then</B>
<P><B>this thing that I didn't saw was holding my throat and holding my</B>
<P><B>hands at the same time and I felt something heavy on my chest.  I</B>
<P><B>couldn't breath and couldn't scream or move my body.  I tried to call</B>
<P><B>my mom and wake her up without any luck.  I thought that I was going</B>
<P><B>to die.  This thing lasted for half a minute and it stopped like</B>
<P><B>nothing has happened.  It happened to me again last year.  I was
lying</B>
<P><B>on my bed with the bed cover on my face trying to sleep and I felt</B>
<P><B>something heavy on my chest and face.  This time I tried to push it</B>
<P><B>away from me and I managed to do that and when I took the cover off
my</B>
<P><B>face a saw it.  It was a little thing (black shadow) with red eyes</B>
<P><B>about 3 feet tall.  I closed my eyes and I tried to go to sleep and</B>
<P><B>when I opened it again it was gone.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One night, my cousin who is 16 years old now was staying with us (me</B>
<P><B>and my sister). She was sleeping on the floor.  The room was dark and</B>
<P><B>she was a sleep but my sister and I weren't.  we saw my cousin Noura</B>
<P><B>getting up toward the bedroom door and going out.  I looked at my</B>
<P><B>sister and she looked at me.  I asked her were is Noura going and she</B>
<P><B>didn't know. And then I asked her to check her out if she was a sleep</B>
<P><B>or not and when she looked at here she was THERE !!! she was sleeping</B>
<P><B>and without saying anything we went to sleep.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have many stories to tell but I'll end up now with this experience.
</B>
<P><B>My family and I went to Al-Ain to visit my aunt.  At 2am my cousin</B>
<P><B>Noura and My sister Hissa were in the living room talking and without</B>
<P><B>any reason they stopped and the room was so quite.  They saw a tall</B>
<P><B>lady wearing a white dress with lights coming out of her coming from</B>
<P><B>one of the rooms, walking too slowly toward another room.  My sister</B>
<P><B>and my cousin just looked at her without moving or saying anything</B>
<P><B>until she got into the other room.  After that my sister asked my</B>
<P><B>cousin with a low voice "who was she?" and my cousin replied "I
don't</B>
<P><B>have any idea!!" and then they just kept looking at each other with
a</B>
<P><B>surprise on their faces.  After that my sister asked my cousin to go</B>
<P><B>with her to the room that the lady came from and when they went there</B>
<P><B>they found many things on the floor and my other cousin was sleeping</B>
<P><B>there.  I was sleeping that night so they told me about it and they</B>
<P><B>were very scared but happy at the same time coz it was the first time</B>
<P><B>for them to see this kinda' thing.</B>

<P>
<P><B>Well, I am a 25yr grad w/ a degree in accounting.  I have had so </B>
<P><B>many experiences that I might was well be a "paranormal expert".  At
</B>
<P><B>times I feel as though I am the X-files, and I think most of you can
</B>
<P><B>relate.   I will share one experience which later became a focus point
</B>
<P><B>in my family.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>     You see, when I was about 10 yrs old, I had already been sensitive
</B>
<P><B>to many unseen things.  I was told it was my imagination.  But I </B>
<P><B>believed otherwise.  I knew for a fact that "they" the ghosts existed
</B>
<P><B>because of what had been and still is happening to me.  But when I
was </B>
<P><B>10 years old, my mom took my sis *6 at the time* and my  baby brother
</B>
<P><B>*about 1 at the time* to my Grandma's located in San Antonio Texas.
 My </B>
<P><B>grandfather had passed away at that time and we came down from North
</B>
<P><B>Dakota for the funeral.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>    Well, one night as my sis and I shared a twin bed and feeling her
</B>
<P><B>kicking me and all, I noticed some movement in my mom's room adjacent
to </B>
<P><B>ours. You see, I was facing the entrance to my mom's room *which was
</B>
<P><B>open*.  And the  baby light was on so that we can find the bathroom
and </B>
<P><B>such.. but the light was so bright that I can make out anyone in her
</B>
<P><B>room.. Well, I saw a little "man" in that room.  I was making sure
that </B>
<P><B>I wasn't dreaming... so I pinched myself and held my breath... But
the </B>
<P><B>"man" was still there.  I couldn't make out the features, but I can
</B>
<P><B>still remember him walking around my mom's room and then he started
to </B>
<P><B>float and disappear.</B>
<P>
<P><B>     Well, the next morning I told my Mom what happened and of course
I </B>
<P><B>was dismissed for making up such "a silly story wrought from an over
</B>
<P><B>active imagination."  </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>    Needless to say, a couple years later I learned that my uncle had
a </B>
<P><B>paranormal experience in that house.  Also learned that my aunt Janie,
</B>
<P><B>used to tell my mom that when she *my aunt* slept in that room, she
felt </B>
<P><B>someone choking her.  Also, learned that in that particular room not
</B>
<P><B>many people liked being in there at all. </B>
<P>
<P><B>     Overactive imagination?  You be the judge.  I know what I have
seen </B>
<P><B>in that house.  I have had other experiences as well, and they </B>
<P><B>manifested since I was 8 yrs old.  As for now, I have had many </B>
<P><B>encounters.  But at this time, for more information on those as well
not </B>
<P><B>now...</B>

<H3><A NAME=aunt>My Aunt's House</A>
</H3><P><B>by sjgeisle@fuse.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hello, I'm Amber from Ohio. I came across your web page and saw these</B>
<P><B>stories and it made me feel brave enough to tell you mine. Please
don't</B>
<P><B>think I'm nuts but since I was a little girl I have been able to see</B>
<P><B>ghosts when others can't.My mother and her mother have this gift too.</B>
<P><B>Last year when I was 19 I got a job babysitting my Aunt's youngest
3</B>
<P><B>children. I have always known this house was haunted. I could just
feel</B>
<P><B>it when I walked through the door. I didn't know the extent of it
untill</B>
<P><B>I started babysitting. First let my say the ghosts never made me feel</B>
<P><B>uneasy or like they would harm me in anyway. In some cases I often
felt</B>
<P><B>very safe there. Okay you are probaly thinking get on with the story
so</B>
<P><B>here goes. As i said when I walk through the door I can feel it there.
A</B>
<P><B>couple of days after I started things really began. Things I would
sit</B>
<P><B>down and come back for would not be in the place I left them.I asked
the</B>
<P><B>kids about moving things thinking they were joking with me, every
time</B>
<P><B>they would up at me and say they didn't do it. I belived them because</B>
<P><B>they are good kids and they rarely tell fibs. Then when I was in the</B>
<P><B>house by my self I would here someone talking(there were no radios
on in</B>
<P><B>any room). On one occation the kids were home from school because of</B>
<P><B>snow. The 7 year old girl got up to go to the restroom. A few seconds</B>
<P><B>later I heard her scream so I ran down the hall to see what was
wrong.</B>
<P><B>She was standing there pointing and I noticed she was very pale. I</B>
<P><B>hugged her and asked her what was wrong she held on to me tightly and</B>
<P><B>said she saw something go from her room to her sisters room. Being
the</B>
<P><B>brave person I am (yeah right!) I made the three kids lock themselves
in</B>
<P><B>the bathroom while I searched both rooms. I looked under beds in</B>
<P><B>closete  I could not find anyone or anything.Later that day the kids</B>
<P><B>were sitting around the kitchen table while I fixed lunch. Stevie who
is</B>
<P><B>11,said Amber please make it stop. I asked him who was I suppose to
make</B>
<P><B>it stop what. He said the ghost was banging on the wall. I stopped
what</B>
<P><B>I was doing and listened. Sure enough I heard the knocking sound on
the</B>
<P><B>wall. As nice as I could I asked it to please stp knocking on the
wall(</B>
<P><B>I hate rude people) the knocking continued and by this time I had had
it</B>
<P><B>with the thing. I yelled STOP THIS NOW!!! I soon as I did that the</B>
<P><B>knocking stopped. I said thank you to the ghost and Stevie looked at
me</B>
<P><B>and said "It must know you are the boss" Many more things have
happened</B>
<P><B>but I will save them for another time. Thanks for the time. Amber</B>
