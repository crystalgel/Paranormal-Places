<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I recently spent the night in a renovated 16th century
villa, the Villanova, in Levanto <st1:country-region><st1:place>Italy</st1:place></st1:country-region>--just
a few kilometers north of Cinque Terre on the Ligurian coast of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Italy</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
There is a culinary program there that a friend of mine from <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> was signed up for, and I agreed to drive her
down from my home in Lugano <st1:country-region><st1:place>Switzerland</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We arrived in a heavy storm at night, and as
we pulled into the Villanova I got an immediate sense that there was some
serious history there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were shown to
our apartment on the grounds, which was attached to the church, and had
historically been the priest's apartment. It had been renovated with modern
amenities, and was quite beautiful. We were then invited to join everyone for
dinner in the cantina, which still had the feel of a 16th century cantina. At
dinner, the couple from Dallas who runs the culinary program brought up the
fact that the apartment we were staying in was apparently the 'haunted one,'
but they were laughing at that idea, obviously because they don't believe in
such things. They also mentioned that the Massola family who built the villa in
the 1500's were buried under the church, which was were we were sleeping. To
them, it was a joke.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My friend and I looked at each other, not laughing at all,
aware that there must've been some truth to this if many people had brought
it<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">up to the owners before.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After dinner, we relaxed in the courtyard<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">and laughed and tried to ignore what we had been told at
dinner. We went to sleep, each of us in adjoining rooms with the door open
between them, and the thunderstorm picked up again and became very heavy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A couple hours later, I woke up to the sound
of someone running through the apartment. At first, it sounded like it ran
through my room. Then a minute later i heard something very heavy with 2 feet
running across the roof. It was NOT a cat or a dog, as i've heard that sound
many times--this was something as heavy as a human and with 2 feet. My friend
yelled for me from the next room asking me if that was me up and running
around---of course, i told her i was awake, but that i was laying in bed. She
sounded quite scared, as i was, and asked me what the hell that was---i told
her that we should just pretend it's a big animal so we can go back to sleep.
As i said this to her, I saw a shadow of a very human-shaped figure walk
through the door from her room and past the foot of my bed. I immediately
closed my eyes, well aware of what i saw, and i didn't say anything to her as I
didn't want to scare her any further.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">For the rest of the night, i kept my eyes shut, but did not
sleep much--and if i did manage to sleep, it would be for a few minutes and i
was having incredibly twisted dreams that were NOT from my head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The noises continued, and I had an overwhelming feeling of a
presence (or a few) in the apartment. In the morning, my friend asked me not to
say a word about the night before, as she was spending the next 6 nights there
by herself. I kept my mouth shut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it
was the most intense haunting i have ever experienced--i have had feelings of
people being in the same room before, or heard things, but i've never seen an
actual spirit until this experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
thought i would share this with you!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">About 6 miles southwest of this small Michigan village, at
the corners of Lovejoy, Zimmer and Barry roads, is a large tract of farmland
that while now broken up was for years owned by a single family. The family has
been plagued by tragedy, suicides, mental illnesses and deaths.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The original home is still occupied by members of this
family.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">For years strange, unexplained happenings have been
witnessed by area residents. Strange lights in the fields where a grandfather
shot himself, a general feeling of unease when simply driving past. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Visitors in the house have seen dishes move across tables on
their own, doors that refused to stay closed. Even a hangman's noose
appearing<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in an upstairs hall. Pounding
on interior walls and wails from the attic.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The family is large but none will often speak of the goings
on in their home. Older members won't talk of it at all! <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My husband grew up nearby and was a close friend of one of
the sons (who committed suicide in the 1970's) My husband spent a few nights as
a visitor in the house and still breaks out in sweats and chills when talking
about the being in that place.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">On the same farm there are the remnants of an old still
where many local people claim to have seen apparitions and heard weird sounds
around. It's said you will never seen any of the abundant native wildlife in
the vicinity of the still.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In early October 2005, a group of 4 of my friends and I
walked through St. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Patricks Cemetary after reading about it on The Shadowlands
website.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We conducted our short journey
about <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">1 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning,
walking up the hill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About halfway up
the hill I was the only one that heard the sound of feet shuffling on the grass
about 8-10 yards to my right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a
light that was on, on the side of the church, and with that shine I did not
notice anything moving in the grass (like an animal and such).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly after mentioning what I heard to the
others, the sound was heard again by three of us, once again not noticing
moving. We regained our composure and continued up the hill where nothing out
of the ordinary occured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We all felt
very nervous and uncomfortable and refused to continue deeper in the cemetary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">On the way down the hill towards the parking lot, we came
upon the same spot where the shuffling of feet on the grass was heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet again it happened a third time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did not hear it, though two others heard it
at the same time. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We discussed what we all heard, and could not come up with a
logic explanation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We did not have proof
of an animal, cause we did not see it run or anything move around. It remains a
mystery, though we do believe there is something unexplainable at St. Patricks
Cemetary in <st1:place><st1:City>Oakdale</st1:City>, <st1:State>Pennsylvania</st1:State></st1:place>.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">True Ghost Story <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: aleaird@totalnet.us<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I am not one of those who's beliefs are for or against the
supernatural. During the time of the event I will tell you about, I was your
normal Freshman in college in <st1:State><st1:place>Oklahoma</st1:place></st1:State>.
Anyway, my self and 3 other fraternity brothers were looking for a house to
rent in <st1:place><st1:City>Ada</st1:City> <st1:State>Oklahoma</st1:State></st1:place>
when we found this great house not far from the college but still pretty
isolated. It was a two story brick house with 4 large bedrooms. It had been
empty for several years which should have been our first clue that something is
wrong, but we were young and cash is cash. We asked the realtor if there was
something wrong with the property and why was the rent so cheap in a college
town but got no straight answer. Regardless we took the deal and moved in. I
and Skip took the rooms upstairs wile Randy and Alvin moved downstairs. Nothing
much happened at first. Nothing that we took as remarkable. For one thing the
front door, made of heavy wood and very difficult to open or close would
sometimes just open, stand open for a moment then close. We would laugh it off
even though one of our roommates worked as a carpenter and would examine the
door and say that it was not possible to do that on it's own. After one of
these incidents he went over to the door and tried to open it and had a
difficult time opening it (like always). He looked it over very close as said
it had warped with time and would always be hard to open and close without
planing the ends off.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Soon after so other things began to occur. All of us, at one
time or another had seen a small ball of light go from the bottom of the stairs
to the second floor. Still we thought this was odd but not something to be
concerned about. Being in college we figured it was a reflection from some
source causing this and that was kinda cool. This is when things started
getting very strange. One night we were all in the living room watching a
football game on TV when a loud noise started coming from the wall separating
the living room from the kitchen. It was a banging noise like someone hitting
the wall. The strikes were so strong that our Frat. crest hanging on that wall
was bouncing off the wall. We all got up and ran to the kitchen figuring we
would find someone playing a trick on us but when we got there found no one.
The banging continued for only a few more minutes then stopped. Alvin (the
carpenter) said it was from some pipes in the wall causing it and we had better
tell the land lord. The next day we called them and were told that there were
no pipes in the walls.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This still was nothing more than a strange event to us, but
we did start to compare notes about things that had happened in the house. One
thing was in my room (upstairs) you could not keep the window closed. These
were old wooden windows. Hard to open or close. My window was opened about an
inch the day I moved in and with great effort I closed it only to find the next
morning it would be back open to the same place. This got a bit uncomfortable
because it was winter. Each night I would close the window and the next morning
it would be open. I got very angry with my room mates about this and asked them
to stay out of my room, but they each denied opening the window or even being
in my room. Finally I figured the window was warping during the night that is
why it opens so I put a cut off broom handle wedged at the top. The next
morning the window was open again and the broom handle was sitting propped up
near the door (12 feet away). It gave me chills but decided to just leave it
be. As I told my story, my upstairs room mate reminded me about his room.
Although exactly the same as mine, his room was always dark. No mater how many
lights or stronger watt bulbs we put in there, it would never lose the
darkness. Not enough to not be able to see, but not enough to read.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Our other room mates told some other stories but you get the
gist. As things progressed we noticed some other changes in the house. For one
thing some girls would not go into our house. I know what your thinking, no we
were popular and had girlfriends and such (plus had some great parties). Yet
some girls would not go into the house. As soon as they got to the door they
just said they could not go in. A couple even broke into tears at the thought
of entering the house. When asked why they could not give any answer. All they
could say was they were not going into that house ever.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This is getting a bit longer than I expected so I guess I'll
cut to the chase. Have not thought about this in 30 years and it's still giving
me the creeps.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Anyway, things were happening and <st1:City><st1:place>Alvin</st1:place></st1:City>
and Randy was ready to move out (Randy's girlfriend was one of those that could
not come into the house). It was Christmas time and our house was pretty
dressed up for a bunch of guys. Big Tree with too much decorations and the Xmas
presents we would be taking home to our families in a few days under the tree.
Nothing remarkable happened this night, as a matter of fact it was particularly
quiet. We had all went to bed about <st1:time minute="0" hour="2">2 am</st1:time>
and nothing woke us till morning, when I heard Randy yelling from downstairs.
It was about <st1:time minute="0" hour="7">7 am</st1:time>. We thought maybe
the house was on fire or worse, but when we got down stairs the look on his
face was scary. There in the middle of our large living room was our Tree with
all the tinsel and trimming stripped off of it. All the presents, all the
furniture, all the dishware, every stitch of clothing we all owned everything
piled in a heap that reached the ceiling (16 feel ceiling I might add). In the
haste to get down stairs none of us had noticed that everything in our rooms
had been removed as we slept.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After a few minutes of just staring at the site in our
living room we checked the house from top to bottom. Everything we had brought
into the house was there, everything.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This was it for a couple of the guys. We all said it was a trick
another Frat. had played on us, or some of our friends that had heard some of
the stories that had started to get around about our house. Still, <st1:City><st1:place>Alvin</st1:place></st1:City>
was done. He moved his stuff out that day and the rest of us said we would do
the same when we got back from Xmas break. That night my girlfriend and I was
laying on the couch that faced the stairs (she was one of the girls that was
not afraid to come over) when suddenly the door did it's trick by opening and
closing but this time it was followed by the dim light darting up the stairs. I
could feel her body tense and she was trembling and I told her not to be scared
she knows that happens all the time when she let our a scream I'll never
forget. She pointed to the top of the stairs where steps join with the ceiling
and there in plane site was a face looking straight at us. No body, no
expression, just a face between the top rung, stair and ceiling. No one could
have contorted themselves to a point to get in that position but there it was.
I remember my are muscle tensed so much I had a black bruise for weeks. Just as
soon as we had both got a good look at it, it moved from site upstairs (no it
did not vanish). I have never wanted to run more in my life, but being a young
man at that time, I grabbed a baseball bat and ran upstairs ready to kill
someone. I tore the house apart looking everywhere to find no one. Jane was
still in tears about to have a complete break down. I grabbed all my clothing
and everything I knew I could live without and left (I knew I would not go back
there again).<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Not sure I want anyone to belive me or not. I guess if I had
choice I would choose not. Never had any experiences like that before or after
and I guess it just does not matter. I just thought you might get a kick out of
a story by someone with no reason to tell it.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Also, postscript to the house. They were never able to sell
it or rent it. It was finally tore down and now is just an empty lot.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The Follow-up to Allen Leaird's True Ghost Story: <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Several years ago, our Frat. had a reunion and I and a
couple of the guys from the story where having a few when Skip brought up the
house. We had never talked about it afterwards, as if it never happened (way
too proud to admit we were scared you know). Funny how difficult the conversation
was. Maybe not difficult but guarded. Anyway, after a few more drinks we opened
up a bit and <st1:City><st1:place>Alvin</st1:place></st1:City> told a few
events that he had never reveled before. Said he though we would think him
nuts. He said that one night he was in bed asleep (this guy sleeps like a rock)
when suddenly he woke up. Did not know why but he felt like something was in
the room with him. He said he was so scared he could not move (by the way, this
guy was not afraid of anything. Big, strong and never told a lie in his life).
His room was just off the living room closest to the front door and stairs.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">He noticed his bedroom door was open and from his room he
could also see the front door was wide open. He figured that was what woke him
up. One of us had come in late from a party and had left the door open. He said
he got up and went to the door and yelled "Who the hell left this door
open?" To this day I think he spoke the truth when he said he heard a
voice that seemed to be right behind him say "We did". He said he
spun around and there was no one there. As a mater of fact, he checked the rest
of the house and we were all asleep. You'll remember <st1:City><st1:place>Alvin</st1:place></st1:City>
was the first one to say he was leaving but he never said why until that day of
the reunion 20 years later.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi my name is Kathy i use to live in <st1:place><st1:City>Chesapeake</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>Virginia</st1:State></st1:place> years back. I grew up in a House
on <st1:Street><st1:address>1313 Hull Street</st1:address></st1:Street> that
was haunted. For 18 years i lived there with my family at night you could hear
footsteps going up an down the stairs. Everynight i would close my closet doors
in my bedroom and every morning they would be open. One night I floated down
the stairs and woke up on the couch, like something was carring me. There was
something dark in that House and one Sunday morning i was downstairs all alone
in the Living room watching TV<span style="">&nbsp; </span>an i
heard a<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>boom<span style="">&nbsp; </span>boom<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>like loud foot steps comming down them stairs, I jumped up and ran out
the back door<span style="">&nbsp; </span>outside to the picnic
table an waited for someone to come home. I always believed something Evil
lived in the wall upstairs to the left of my bedroom. A few years back a woman
called me from the House on 1313 Hull Street and asked me if i new the house
was haunted i told her yes and she said just then the water from the kitchen
sink came on by itself and that her husband tried to stab her with a kitchen
knife in that House. She also felt she was loosing her mind in the House. My
heart races when i talk about the House on <st1:address><st1:Street>1313 Hull
  Street</st1:Street><span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:City>Chesapeake</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>Virginia</st1:State></st1:address>. Its a place i will never forget

<p class="MsoNormal">It started at 12:00 pm in my room,I was sleeping and I got
an unweary wake up call,something was licking my hand.So I woke up and looked
around but I couldn't see anything ,so I just went back to sleep and kept
telling myself that my mind was just playing tricks on me.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I woke up again,but instead of my hand feeling like it was
being licked to death ,I heard noises and scratches on the floor. Again, I got
up and looked around,but I still couldn't see anything,so I tried to go back to
sleep,but this time I couldn't because at that moment I felt something jump on
my bed and stat licking my hand again.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This time I knew my mind wasn't playing tricks on me,and
this wasn't a dream,it was real life.I looked around for a third time,I still
saw nothing,so I got up,went to the washroom and splashed water on my face.On
the way to my bedroom I caught something at the corner of my eye.I quickly went
on my bed and put the covers over my head.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I took the covers off of my head after about 15 minutes and
looked around,in the darkest corner of my room I saw A shadowy figure of a dog.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I screamed and froze in spot because I was soooo........
scared. The dark figure of the dog kept coming closer and closer until it was
at my feet.It kind of looked at me wierdly and then jumped on my bed.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">At that moment I knew that this "dog spirit" was
in fact my dog named Buttons that died in February 2004. Now every night at <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">12:00 pm</st1:time> my "dog spirit",Buttons
comes and joins me to go to sleep.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When I was six years old, I went to a family reunion in <st1:State><st1:place>Oklahoma</st1:place></st1:State>.
After everyone had eaten, I went outside to play with my cousins in the
woods(at the time i didn't think this was a bad idea).We were playing hide and
seek in an old abondend construction site. I was it. I was looking for them and
I ran in to a tall dark figure.It was a man about 6'4. I ran the other way, and
there it was again. I yelled for my family and they came running. Immediatley I
opened up my eyes, it was gone.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I've never gone in the woods since.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I can't really say if this is much of a ghost story, more of
a chain of events that I can't explain. I had just moved out of home into my
own place. I had unpacked everything and was sitting on my new bed cutting my
toenails of all things, when I suddenly felt the presence of something unseen
in my room, then I heard a voice whispering, "Stop it, stop it, stop
it." I'm pretty sure that the words were only repeated 3 or 4 times. I
looked around the room with wide eyes, still not seeing anything. For some
reason I then stood up and walked to the front door where I saw the door open
al by it self. i ran out the door to see if I could see anything around the
house. There was nothing. I was a little shaken, but tried to forget it. That
night I went to sleep no trouble, but in the middle of the night I awoke to
find that there was somthing heavy on my back, I always sleep on my stomach,
the weight was incredible and I could feel arms wrapped tightly around my
chest, I could not breath and I could not move. In my mind I said these words,
"Jesus please help me!" And the weight was gone immediatly. I grew up
i a christian home and I am a christian myself, so to call out to God for help
was natural. I told my parents the next day. Dad said that he had had similar
experiences when he first moved out of home. He went on to explain that I had
moved out of my safe christian surrounds and I was vonerable. My mother then
told me that if I pray in every room of the house as she did at her house for
protection, God would protect me. So that is what I did and to this day evil
forces have stayed away.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By: redauntqueen1@msn.com <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I grew up in a house in <st1:place><st1:City>Allentown</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>PA</st1:State></st1:place> that, to me unknowlingly for the greater
part of my life, was haunted.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Larue F. and her family lived in our house before we bought
it in the late 1960's. One morning, before school, Larue's son shot and killed
his sleeping mother in the back right corner of the living room, from what I
understand, as she slept. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As I understand it, Larue was a difficult woman to get along
with. My parents and my sister lived up the street from them and Larue used to
babysit my sister. My mother was pregnant with me at the time and Larue was
very excited at the my upcoming birth. My sister has told me stories of how
Larue's son was cruel to her when she was at the house. He would lock in rooms,
hang her up the back collar of her shirt on a coat hook and leave her hanging
while laughing at her cries. One theory to the motive of the murder was that he
was having an affair with the married woman next door and Larue found out and
threatened to tell the husband, but no one really knows why he did it except
the son himself.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After I was born and the the son was found guilty of the
murder and sent to the state mental hospital, we acquired the house and moved
in. It was the first house my parents ever owned. I had to been about two years
old at the time, no one in my family is exactly sure of the dates.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Larue was still there. Toilets would flush. The refrigerator
would become unplugged repeatedly and if you are old enough to remember the
models from the 60's they were mammoth appliances that could not be moved and
this one was jammed up against the the wall where the receptical was. Pots and
pans would come out of their cupboards and land on the floor. A crucifix on the
wall in parents bedroom would move from side to side creating scratch marks in
the paint.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My mother had knick-knacks on tables in the living room that
would move from their positions and end up on the floor. She originally thought
she kicked the tables in her sleep<span style="">&nbsp; </span>, so
she moved them all to the center of the tables instead of placing them close to
the edges. It still would happen, but not as frequently. She still does this to
this day although they live 3,000 miles away from PA. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then Larue began to appear as herself. First to the family,
then to friends of the family. I have to stop at this point and tell you that
no one was ever frightend of her. They all knew Larue and were (fascinated?)
that this was happening. They knew she meant us no harm because she loved my
family and was so excited at the upcoming baby (me). Unfortunately she never
lived to see the birth.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When she would appear, most times it seemed to be in the
living room where she died. A friend of my mother's saw her at the big bay
window facing the street. Other times as my mother and her friends were having
tea in the kitchen , they<span style="">&nbsp; </span>would see her
walk, always to the front window. This happened countless times that it became
to almost a joke. "She's here".<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One frightening thing did happen to my mother. One night as
she slept, she had a nightmare of finding Larue the morning she was murdered,
and ran to her to help her as she lay bleeding. My mother touched her in her
dream , looked at her hands and they were covered in blood . She woke up at
that moment and looked at her hands<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and
they were truly covered in blood. My father immdiately took her to the
emergency room and they found no cause for the blood to be there. Not a
nosebleed, no cuts, no explanation. Of course my parents kept this to
themselves. The way I found out about this story was that one day I was leafng
throught the bible and found a bookmark in a page that was titled "To stop
bleeding" and questioned my father. He didn't give a real good reason but
I was young and shrugged it off. Only later after my insistence after my own
experience did he finally tell me the truth.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">During the years I was growing up I never saw nor felt her.
My parents had a psychic cleanser come to the house and he confirmed that she
was there, but she meant us no harm. She was there to watch and wanted to see the
baby (me). He didn't suceed in releasing her from the house but the occurences
did lessen in frequency.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I was about 20 yrs old, one early morning at dawn, I
finally had my own encounter with Larue. I was in bed, asleep, and awoke
suddenly-wide awake and alert. Down at the foot of my bed stood Larue. She was
white, solid, not misty but like solid smoke. She didn't move as she faced the
window. I wasn't afraid in the slightest. I sat up in bed and still she did not
move. It seemed like a long time that I stared at her but it was only about a
minute or less that she was there. In the blink of an eye she was gone. She
didn't slowly fade or drift away. She just wasn't there anymore. Like, snap! I
lay back down and thought to myself, Holy cow, I just saw Larue! and promptly
went back to a peaceful sleep.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I went downstairs in the morning for breakfast I told
my mom. She thought to herself a moment then went to the calendar and chuckled
and said "yes, this is the day she died".<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The second encounter I had with Larue I shared with my
husband at the time. My parents where on vacation and we were watching the
house. It was a Saturday morning and he and I were watching tv in my old
bedroom. All at once, simutanlesly, the tv and the stereo switched. The tv went
off and the stereo went on. Twice. The was a pause between each switch. I
remember looking at one as turned off, then to the other as it went on and
again it repeated. My husband was scared to death. I just laughed and tried to
calm him down.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We as a family don't really talk much about Larue anymore,
she was like a childhood friend you grew away from. I think the last encounter
that my dad can remember is waking up in the night and he said it was like
someone was in the bed with him swishing the sheets around his body. He told
her to stop and she did.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">For those that don't believe in ghosts, I wish they would
have the experiences our family did. We are all believers since we saw it all
first hand and feel lucky to have done so.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Sometimes still, when I can&#8217;t sleep, I think of Larue and
she comforts me. I hope she has found her peace.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A Few Ghost Stories<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: matsuki_ryu2004@msn.com<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I am not a ghost hunter or anything, but I am very
knowledged in many things, paranormal is one of them.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Queen Mary-Luxury Cruiser(retired) it was used as a hospital
ship during world war 2, after that it was back as a luxury liner, it is now
located in Long Beach, CA.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This happend to me when I was 8 or 9 years old (19 years old
now) so my memory about it is a little vague during the tour Ii noticed a young
girl with strange clothes on for that time, I also noticed that when i tried
talking to her she wouldn't respond, she was alone so I wondered where her
parents were.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During that time i was
unusually cold, it was during fall, but if you live in Southern California you
know that the weather is usually pretty decent all year round, but i could of
sworn it was at least 60 degrees the whole time the girl was there, after a
while I took notice that she was gone, but only after I had one last glance at
her, I know she couldn't of gone far without me seeing her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I now wonder if that's the same little girl
from the pool area or that pulls pranks.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This next one happend to me in <st1:place><st1:City>Fort
  Sill</st1:City>, <st1:State>Oklahoma</st1:State></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My family and I went to <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>Fort</st1:PlaceType>
 <st1:PlaceName>Sill</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> to see my sister graduate from
Army Basic Training.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We learned that the
native american Geronimo was buried there, also most of his family, when we
went to see his graveyard all of us except my dad (he is a little<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">deaf) heard drums coming from the forested area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For you that aren't aware, Geronimo's
Graveyard is inside an Army Base, so the graves are dug up periodically in
order to see that the bones are in tact and not missing. The drums sounded like
native american war drums, my dad told me a few years after (this happend in
2000) that navajo and mexicans were enemies, and we are mexican, so I'm
guessing that those were drums of were, we also took pictures, but no
paranormal appearences came in the pictures.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have a few more experiences, but I'm only going to mention
this last one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This was in <st1:place><st1:City>Delano</st1:City>, <st1:State>CA</st1:State></st1:place>
I was visiting my girlfriend (friend friend no relationship just a girl friend
I'm a guy so that's ok to have a girl girl<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">friend) ok so i went because she invited me to Filipino
Weekend, but a few days before I was searching the Haunted Places in this site,
and I learned about the ghost of Browning Road.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was well aware of the stories about the "hitchhiker ghost"
so i told her i was going to go investigate, she just laughed at me and said
whatever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I began driving back and forth
on Browning Road, but I didn't see the "lady of the rear view mirror"
I was growing more and more frustrated, so I got off my car and began mocking
the ghost to show itself, then I saw a figure in the backseat of my car (I'm
not afraid of anything supernatural) so I approached it, then it disappeared, I
quickly jumped in my backseat of my car and felt a very cold spot almost
freezing cold, it was at least 102 degrees outside, and I didn't have my AC on
that day because I like breezing feeling of the wind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I assume that it was at least 65 degrees in
that spot of the car, ONLY that spot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Well that was my most recent one (July 2005).<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When we first moved into the house, after cleaning throughly,
I found an old fashioned hair pin in the master bedroom. During the 10 years of
living there, many other unexplained things happened.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We found that previous owner's son was murdered by the
neighbor's son over a girl,and buried in the woods behind the house. The
neighbor hid her son in the attic for 2 weeks before authorities found
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was a strange case herself, as
she is a fotune-teller known throughout the county.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One year I took her pies and cakes for Thanksgiving and she
gave me some air freshner called " More Money". The next thing I
knew, everything was breaking, the fuse box started shooting sparks, the
plumbing was leaking, both cars broke down and you better believe I threw that
stuff out. It didn't bring more money, it spent more money.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The scariest things to happen in that house were the kids
waking at night saying someone was pulling on their feet, especially the ones
who slept on the top bunks. I was awakened several times by what felt like
slaps on the face and once I woke when I felt like someone was smothering me. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Anytime walking through the woods, was unsettling, even on
the warmest, summer day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The kids tended
to play in to woods across the street rather than behind the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had found myself lost a few times,even in
just a few acres, at night, totally disoriented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Several times, we would see an unexplained mist-weather was
not a factor- floating up from the old shed behind the house.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">While in college, I decided to move out on my own away from my
roommate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I found a very reasonable
one-bedroom apartment on <st1:Street><st1:address>Main St</st1:address></st1:Street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I did my walk through of it, I
immediately loved it even though it needed some cleaning up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I moved in the next day and cleaned and
cleaned to my preference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After getting
everything cleaned up and my stuff all put away, I took a breather in the
living room and admired the curved arches in the doorways.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I loved the old feel there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It didn't take long for me to notice
something strange there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My old roommate
would come over during the day to use my apartment as a study place while I was
at work because she was in transit and finding it hard to study in our friends'
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a few days, she informed me
that she would no longer be using my apartment because she couldn't get any
studying done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said that she would
always fall asleep just minutes after settling down to study.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also noticed that I would fall asleep
anytime that I sat down for more than 15 minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And my husband, who was my boyfriend at the
time, also mentioned that he slept the deepest he had ever slept in his life
whenever he was at my aprartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
found it strange, but thought nothing of it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As the days went by, a few other things seemed to happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I noticed that my tv would come on by itself
in the middle of the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There would
also be soft voices heard from my living room and nobody there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I believe that the most significant thing
happened about 4 weeks after I had moved in.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My husband used to spend the night frequently at my apartment on days
when he had to work because I lived closer to his workplace.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night, I vaguely remember feeling him get
up from my bed and shuffle into the kitchen on his way to the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I simply rolled over and drifted back to
sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I awoke in the morning, I
remembered that incident and then realized that he didn't spend the night that
night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, whatever I felt get out of my
bed and go into the kitchen wasn't him!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I moved out of that apartment shortly afterwards because of a job
transfer, but later found out that that old place used to be a funeral home
many years before!!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: daisymae5@alltel.net<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Hello there, I have three tales to tell, one of mine and the
others from people I have met.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I was 6 years old, my family moved to <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>
because of my Dad's work. We came from <st1:City><st1:place>Miami</st1:place></st1:City>
and were renting a house. Being so young, I never thought of ghosts except at
halloween. Here is what happened to me. Even though I was 6, I remember it as
it was yesterday!<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One night I awoke to find the house shaking and creaking,
thats right, an earthquake. Being from <st1:State><st1:place>Florida</st1:place></st1:State>,
you can imagine my terror. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Jumping from my bed, I ran to my door to go to my parents
room which was down the hall to the left. I know I was awake for I remember
looking down by the door and my pet hermit crab was literally bouncing up and
down in his box. Well, once at the door, I looked to my right, and down the
hall, coming out of the kitchen was a bed enveloped in green light. I watched
as this brass bed came bouncing down the hall and I saw an old man lying in the
bed. It bounced down the hall, into my parents room, and out through the wall.
Needless to say, I was scared out of my mind, I jumped back in my bed and
somehow went to sleep. I told my mother about it the next day and of course she
told me it was a nightmare. I know the earthquake was real for we drove the
neighborhood and looked at all the damage. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Another thing that happened was: One morning I woke up and
was laying there. (this is kinda gross but hey, we all do it) I was picking my
nose when I looked at my brothers bed. The head of my bed was in the corner and
the foot of his bed was what I could see. There was a body in the bed for the
sheets were going over it. As I looked, I saw my brother (who was 12) squating
on the side of his bed with his back against the wall, in his underwear, with
his hands pointing to the sides of his head. His fingers were streched out
pointing toward each side of his head. He had a goofy smile on his face and his
tongue was sticking out. He was looking out across the room, not at me. I
thought, If he is against the wall, who is in the bed? Again, scared as can be,
I turned my face away and went back to sleep. Later and the breakfast table I
asked him about and he said I was crazy.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Another time I was watching cartoons in the morning and
through the floor it felt as if someone punched it. It was so hard, I remember
coming off the floor.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One more thing, Years later my mother told me this, <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One day after her chores, she was taking a nap on her bed.
She was in that half awake half asleep mode and heard foot steps coming down
the hall. She thought it was my oldest brother (15) home from school. She was
thinking of what kind of snack to fix him as she heard the foot steps enter the
room and someone sat on the bed. When she looked up, there was no one there.
She was so alarmed, she got up got my little sister (2) and called my Father at
work and said that she would be on the front steps till he got home. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It was then that I found out that an old man had died in
that house. I guess I was about 16 when she told me. We moved from that house
and went back to <st1:City><st1:place>Miami</st1:place></st1:City>.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Another story I have heard was from a man that used to hang
out at the Kangaroo where I worked once. I was 18 at the time. The mans name
was Jimmy and has past on since. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Jimmy told me about <st1:City><st1:place>Butler</st1:place></st1:City>
bridge. Back in the 50's, people used to go there and picnic and couples went
there too, you get the picture. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">He told me that <st1:City><st1:place>Butler</st1:place></st1:City>
bridge was built in the 1800s and back in the civil war, the confederates hung
many slaves there in the trees as the union army aproched. He said that if you
look close, you can still see the ringlets which held the ropes. Well one
night, he and a buddy took there dates down there. It was getting dark. As they
were getting comfortable under the bridge, they heard foot steps going across
the bridge toward them. The women were frightned so the men went up the hill to
investigate. They crept up there and as soon as they popped there heads over
the sides to see who it was, the foot steps stopped and there was no one there.
<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">They were gone within the minuite. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have visited this place during the day, but not at night.
Many of the locals say it is haunted.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The last tale came from a man I met at a Halloween party.
There were not many people there and we were talking about this and that when
the conversation eventually led to ghosts.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I told him that I had seen a ghost ( my story above) and he

<p class="MsoNormal">"When I was 12 we lived in <st1:City><st1:place>Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>.
One night I awoke to see a blue light going down the hall. I thought it was my
older brother with a flashlight. I walked out my bedroom and down the hall to
the right. There was a corner there to the left where the light was. As I
rounded the corner, there stood a Paul Revear type dude bathed in this light.
He had on revolutionary clothes and a three pointed hat. I stood there trying
to compehend what I was seeing. He looked at me, tiped his hat and went thru
the door there that led down to the basement. As I stood in a daze, my brother
came out of the bathroom which was on the other side of the hall. He said
"What are you doing?" I said "Nothing". He told me to go
back to bed."<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Since I was a little girl, (I am now 31 years old) I have
always felt as though someone was watching me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I haven't ever wanted to call it a guardian angel, for it has never
helped me in any way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't think it
is a malicious presence either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has
remained with me through childhood and into adulthood, through various moves to
different houses and such.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It may sound crazy to some of you, but I wish I would have
had more of a concrete experience with "the after life".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several of my relatives on my father's side
have claimed to have had premonitions and other such things happen to
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I attribute that to where my third
daughter picked it up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She seems to know
things that she wouldn't know unless she were "special".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she was eighteen months old and barely
talking, she would look to the corner of our living room and point to a
"being" she called "Ryan".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ryan was described the exact same way each time he was spotted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Black hair, green eyes and big like Daddy but
he acted like a baby, almost always crying or sad looking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She would have actual conversations with this
"being".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night I was typing
an e-mail to family and she was on my lap.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She pointed to the corner and said, "Mommy, he's here."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked over and the corner was only
illuminated by the light from the computer screen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did feel the room to get cold, so we went
out into the living room where it was warmer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She had been tired and kept turning away from "Ryan" as if his
being there was upsetting her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When she was almost three years old, she started saying that
this bald man, who frightened her was showing up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She described him as wearing dark clothing
and he was pale, bald and had black eyes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Black eyes that were hard to see or weren't there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She only saw Ryan at our home, but first saw
this bald man at our friends house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
first time she saw him her eyes were transfixed to their white wall near their
hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We all thought it was cool and
tried to keep quiet, so we wouldn't affect her in any way as she watched
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this entity scared her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She didn't like him and while
"Ryan" sightings were getting fewer, "bald man" sightings
were becoming more frequent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't
like it at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is when my Mother
in law began to tell her that these were imaginary friends that she thought she
needed and she really didn't need them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Soon after she began believing that, my Mother in law gave her a
"dream catcher".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She touches
this each night before bed and each day when she wakes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since then she hasn't seen the bald man or
Ryan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She speaks of Ryan now as if he
were a dear friend of hers from long ago.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She remembers him, but will not say he was a ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She sticks to what her Grandma told her about
him being an imaginary friend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The only personal experience I can jot down happened when I
was 12 years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I used to hang out
with the girls next door till they became teenagers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were about 5 and 6 years older than
I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The elder of the girls was killed on
her 18th birthday in horrible car accident that killed 4 other teens in our
area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was my first experience with
someone close to me dying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I handled it
strangely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Drawing pictures of her in
her casket, writing about the night she died, the time, the date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A year from the date she passed, I was laying
in my bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were no storms in the
area that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At <st1:time minute="5" hour="0">12:05 a.m.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked
at the clock and said, "Well Cindy, it's been a year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Please show me that you are still with
us."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That instant the lights went
out in my room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had a power outage,
but it was confined to just our house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Was it Cindy giving me a sign?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It was <st1:time minute="0" hour="3">3:00am</st1:time>, I
remember hearing a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>whispering in my left
ear.. I looked over to find nothing to my left.. I began to feel a cold breeze,
but no windows were open. I got up holding the covers around my waist. I
quickly went to the bathroom to find my medication. I heard the shower curtain
rattle.. I looked up and my tinted windows were open in the bathroom. I closed
them and heard the rattle again. I walked away slowly but the door was locked
from the outside. I started to walk toward the shower when I heard it again.. I
opened the shower curtain and a flash of cold air rushed through my veins. I
finally decided to listen to the whispering, And I heard a voice say "the
shadow with a flash will cremate close." Out of nothing, I woke up on the
couch to a phone ring.. My great Uncle George was electrocuted by lightning
that night and was going to be cremated..<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I cannot say that I have any physic abilities or anything
like that or had a lot of paranormal experiences, but I know that I had one
just recently.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A little background
first....<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My brother passed away in August of 2000 and my dad in
January of 2002.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My brother visited me
shortly after his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in bed
and I felt something go over my head and then my mattress moved (like someone
ran across the bed).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was the only
time I think he has come to say hi.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My mom and dad have a park model trailer down the <st1:place>Jersey</st1:place>
shore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My dad loved to be there and
spent as much time there as possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the summer my son, my niece, my mom, my brother (I had 3) and his girlfriend
and I went down for a weekend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They all
decided to go to the boardwalk, but I was bushed from the busy day and decided
to stay at the trailer.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It was around <st1:time minute="0" hour="23">11:00 pm</st1:time>
and they still were not home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I made the
coach bed up for the kids and was sitting on it watching tv.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sliding door and the backdoor was shut
and locked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of a sudden there was a
loud bang noise that came from the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Of course I was freaked out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was all alone and the doors were locked.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So I did what all the stupid females do in the movies and went to see
what the noise was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tiptoed to the
bathroom and slowly opened the door.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Laying on the floor was my brothers traveling kit (toothbrush, deodorant
that kind of thing).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had been hanging
on a hook on the door the entire day and night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The bag was on the floor; however, the hook was still on the door. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Freaked out a little, I went back to sitting on the bed and
watching tv.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not 2 seconds go by and the
key hook holding a small set of keys went flying across the room. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>That is when I knew that my dad was trying to
say hi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said "Ok dad, your
freaking me out so knock it off"<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>and that was that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know
who it was or if it was just coincidences that happened, but I was happy to
think it was my dad saying hi.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My family and I visit <st1:City><st1:place>Gettysburg</st1:place></st1:City>
every year for our family vacation. We have ever since I was 15 and I am now
37. In 1998 my mother and I after searching for the Triangular Field finally
found it and decided to take a walk down to the bottom of the field. My
grandmother was with us and decided to wait in the car while mom and I ventured
down the somewhat rough terrain of the field. The further we went we felt a
heaviness in the air, like we werent supposed to be there. This was the area of
the Confederate soldiers and since we are from <st1:State><st1:place>Pennsylvania</st1:place></st1:State>
I guess we were considered the enemy, Union side. Then as we reached the bottom
and just stood there looking around and discussing the battle, off in the
distance we heard drums, ever so faintly.We both looked at each other and asked
one another "Did you hear that?" We both agreed that we heard drums
beating. We started to walk back up the incline and the drums were silenced. I
asked my mom if she would turn and walk back down with me to see if we could
hear the drums again. We did walk back down and when we got to the same spot we
were at before, we again heard the drums. There was wooded areas on both sides
and we knew no-one was down there playing any kind of drums. Feeling
uncomfortable, we both walked back up the hill and through the gate. We stopped
to listen to see if we could hear the drums again, but we heard nothing. We
both asked my grandmother if she had heard any drums and she told us no. But my
mother and I both know what we heard that day.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Just wanted to add some experiences on two house(s) we owned
in <st1:place><st1:City>Media</st1:City>, <st1:State>PA.</st1:State></st1:place>
It was originally a schoolhouse (School #1) dated back in 1862. It was closed
down in 1920 with kids damaging the property and went to auction in 1922. I've
had strangers ask me about ghosts in the house or sightings (out of the blue
i.e.).<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Sightings:<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Strange sounds from the living room usually at night-lights
turning off &amp; on TV turned off for no reason. When I was renovating the
attached garage (was originally a horse stall) at two separate occasions -
apparition sightings of young children with dark knickers (short pance) running
in front of the garage door and giggling/talking. No "live" human
beings were around I checked it out.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Had taken pictures of the inside of the house and have
pictures with ghost mists &amp; orbs (one time some mist was draped above the
healthy animal (rabbit). The animal died the next day for no apparent reason
(wasn't real old - about 3 yrs.). <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I don't no more history except I believe Habersett's wife
died there, again it was a schoolhouse for 50+ years and the living room was
the original schoolhouse (one story at that time).<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Another house in <st1:place><st1:City>Malvern</st1:City>, <st1:State>PA</st1:State></st1:place>
<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Many sightings (sounds, things moving by itself etc.) with
separate witnessest.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We called the ghost "Ester".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Foorsteps &amp; taping doors in the upstairs
hallway late at night, typing (old typewriter) keys (no one had a typewriter at
the time). One morning when going to work, at the top of the stairs I heard a
faint old "ragtime" music coming from downstairs. I said to myself
that is strange someone left the stereo on. I came down the stairs and saw a
flash of light and the music stopped. (the stereo was off). One time a TV came
on and it was unplugged! (That one freaked me out a little)<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One Party we had at least (twice) doors opened by itself
(heavy wood doors) at least one foot+. Witnesses saw that and some were
scared-I shrugged it off and blamed Ester. Attic had cold spots. Always flys
and or wasps even in the middle of winter (even when windows were sealed and
even when I sprayed up there they always seem to come back)<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I just found your web site.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I used to live in <st1:City><st1:place>Meriden</st1:place></st1:City>,
on <st1:Street><st1:address>Sylvan Avenue</st1:address></st1:Street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house is haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My son (only 12 at the time) was choked by an
entity when I was at work. He called me hysterical and when I got home, there
were bruses on his neck and arms, where the entity held him down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From then on we slept in the same bed and
kept lights on at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was to no
avail.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We had a little boy who was pretty much harmless, just a
real prankster However there was a very dark and evil presence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was a dark tall Man entity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We contacted the Warrens who sent two people
to our home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They too experienced an
evil presence in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An exorcisim
was done in the house, however the evil presence never left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I moved out of state. To this date, the house
has been sold a couple of times. I believe that it is still haunted.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Since I was a child, I could see and hear things that others
could not. I still can. I know without a doubt they are not just dreams, or
fantasies, they are without a doubt real.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have many stories in which I could share, but for now, I
will give you the story of my house.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I do not call myself a psychic, but I do believe such people
are real, but they are few and far between. I think, in some since, perhaps I
posses a small amount of psychic influence. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My house, for example, has an interesting story. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A split-level house built in the early '70's, having only
one preveous own before my family. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This owner was known as a robber, a cheat, a drunkard, and
an abusive father and husband. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">While now they are replaced, when I was a child, I
remembered the gaping holes in the doors and walls from where he had tired to
get to his wife and son when he was in a drunken rage. I even remember my Dad
filling the holes with plaster when we couldn't afford to replace the doors
completely. Of course, by some odd cause, the plaster would chip and fall from
the hole as soon a sit dried.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I suppose this story never fully sunk in until recently. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The downstairs area is a family room, and then a second room
split into two with a small bathroom having only a shower in it. I stay in the
family room. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This shower, installed almost 10 years ago, is what I use
even today. Every time I shower, I hear something rather freitening (sp?). <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I hear a man, yelling. While usually it is muffled by the
running water, I sometimes hear loud profanity and loud pounding noises. Behind
this, there is a woman who screams wildly, frantically. Often times it's
"Stop it!" And.. the most devestating noise behind this is th crying
of a small child. Not a baby or toddler, but maybe one of 6 to 8 years of age. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The first time I heard this I was devestated. I thought
something had gone horribly wrong in my house, but upon going upstairs, I found
out everything was normal and that I was the only one who heard it. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">To this day, I am still the only one who hears it. I've
grown rather accostumed to singing in the shower at the top of my lungs to
block out the noise. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Thanks for reading, I hope this or any other stories I could
offer you will be of interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My grandparents passed away and I moved into their house,
where they lived for over 35 years. I always felt safe and happy there. My
grandfather died first, in 1996, and my grandmother passed in late 2003. She
had a brain tumor removed several years before her death, and was very
forgetful and confused much of the time.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After I moved in, strange things started happening. Things
would disappear and then reappear a few weeks later, in a prominent place. I
couldn't find a favorite ring and tore my room apart searching for it for three
weeks. I went through my jewelry box piece by piece five times, looking for it.
One day I was dressing for work and opened the jewelry box, and there it was,
sitting right on top of everything, right where it should have been.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I misplaced a favorite skirt for a over three
months, and then walked in from work one night and it was laying in the middle
of my bed. I don't know if my Grandmother was trying to make me crazy, playing
games with me, or was borrowing my stuff and returning it...........Then there
was the electronic equipment. It started with the CD player in the den. To turn
it on, you have to hit the power button and then the play button. Somehow, it
would come on all by itself. Scared me to death the first few times that
happened. The TV was in my bedroom, and it would come on and go off by itself.
I managed a nightclub, so I would leave in the late afternoon for work, and the
light in my bedroom would not need to be turned on while I was getting dressed.
However, there were several nights I came in and the bedroom light, ceiling
fan, and TV would be turned on, and the TV would be blaring, louder than I would
have had it. I might understand forgetting to turn off the ceiling fan and the
TV, but I never had the light on in the first place before leaving the house.
And I swear the rocker recliner was barely rocking one of those nights when I
walked in. It never really scared me, cause I felt that my grandparents were
looking out for me. I sold the house and moved out several months ago.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">And on the subject of taking care of me, my parents were
killed in a car accident, and we were very close. I feel they watch out for me,
especially my daddy. My bartender and I joke about it, and she made the comment
one night that if my business partner didn't stop dissing me that daddy was
going to take care of him and hit him up side the head. The very next evening
we were in the middle of staff meeting and my business partner made a smart
remark to me, and his bottle of water shot off the table and across the floor.
No one had touched it! The bartender and I looked at each other and tried not
to laugh, and as soon as the meeting was over, she came running over to me and
said, "Were you thinking what I was thinking? He ticked your daddy
off!"<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">"A Little Girl Ghost"<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: <st1:PersonName>nikitajd@bigpond.net.au</st1:PersonName><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I had seen ghosts
before but only very briefly. None have ever identified themselves to me, or
spoken to me, nor had I had an experience so personal! <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In the middle of the night I 'woke up' and noticed a dull,
white blob floating on my ceiling. I immediately recognised it as a spirit. It
began moving accross the ceiling and down onto the wall beside me, so I sat up
and tried to 'pull' it into focus, almost as if I knew I would not be able to
see it with just my eyes. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As I did this it began morphing into a bright white, glowing
little girl! She was about 5 years old and so bright and beautiful that it
literally hurt my eyes to look at her, so I closed them.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Not wanting to appear rude or as shaken as I really was, I
said 'hello' and she said 'hello' back! <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have to say, when she spoke these words to me, I had to
really focus on hearing her voice... not with my ears, but with some other part
of me. I managed to open my eyes then, and the glare had eased off. I asked her
what her name was and she replied softly, "Mary Hoskie". Her voice
was very beautiful, very angelic.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It was then that I asked her how she had died. I dont really
remember if she had told me what happened to her aswell, but she certainly
'showed' me!<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She had been playing on some old floor boards when she fell
through them, landing on some wires that electrocuted her to death.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After the vision she gave me, I immediately felt the need to
comfort her as I would my own child. I grabbed her and held her in my arms for
a minute or so, not so forgeting what she was, but understanding that she
needed comfort and I became comfortable with her!<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I then made room for her on my bed and prompted her to lay
beside me. I held her hand all night and I noticed that her hand was very
warm... not cold like I would've expected. I did not notice any change in
temperature in my room either.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I kept 'waking' throughout the night (atleast 3 times), to
see if she was still there and she was! <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The last part of my experience was that I 'woke up' again,
and went out to show my mother a picture of her and I together in a family
photo, with two or three other young children (whome I don't recognise). My
mother told me she thought it was Maddison (my real life daughter), and even
though she did look alot like Maddison, the only way I could prove to her that
it was infact 'Mary Hoskie', I smudged my thumb accross the photo, and the
image changed. I did this several times until finally, she believed me.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">From my experience, I got the distinct impression that I may
have been Mary's mother in a past life. It felt almost as if she was coming to
me for comfort and to be held by me again. The photo that I showed my mother
was a family portrait with other children there also, and her initials, M.H are
the initials of my real like daughter, Maddison Hinde!<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I'd be very interested to hear your comments, please feel
free to email me.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I know this is not a private residence, nor is it a new
listing for you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, I have never
been to your<span style="">&nbsp; </span>website before this
evening.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I can attest to strange things happening at the <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Manresa</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>Castle</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had first hand experiences about 3 years
ago on October 29th.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stayed there for
one evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having read a little about
it, and having seen it at a distance or passing in my prior five or six visits
to Port Townsend, I decided to stay there out of curiousity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I figured I was safe enough to request the
Jacuzzi Suite as they called it then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
knew I did not want to stay in the Tower Room since it was supposed to be the
room with most activity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lucky me-- the
Jacuzzi Room was directly next to the Tower Room, not down the hall as I had
hoped.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Yes, the television did switch on and off in the
evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But stranger yet was the shower
in the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had been soaking in
the jacuzzi tub, and decided to rinse off.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At first the showerhead was flowing straight on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then it seemed to turn towards the bathroom
floor, making a puddle on the floor before I shut it off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would turn the showerhead back, and it
would once again turn the outside of the tub.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I thought it had<span style="">&nbsp; </span>become loose, so
I shut the water off, and tried to tighten it up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I stood outside of the tub, and turned
the shower back on and let it run for<span style="">&nbsp; </span>at
least a couple minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During that
time, the shower acted normal, running straight into the drain as it should.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I stepped back into the shower and once
again the shower head turned outside of the tub.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have no explanation for this.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was concerned about being the only one on the third floor
at this time since it was a mid-week, and I left the blinds up, and the lights
on until nearly <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was relieved when I heard a young family
with children arrive and move into the Tower Room earlier in the evening (<st1:time minute="0" hour="21">9PM</st1:time> or so).<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The following morning I heard a clock chiming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It sounded like an old style grandfather
clock or school clock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I checked my
watch beside the nightstand, and saw that it was about 5:50 AM or abouts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought it was odd that a hotel clock would
chime before most people would be ready to get up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next morning I walked down the stairs and
passed a clock that was not working near the kitchen or lobby area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I cannot remember now exactly where it was,
but I think it was near the restaurant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To this day I do not know if there might have been another working clock
in the hotel on the second or third floor.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Although I sometimes have a little imagination, these things
I could not rationalize away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A couple
of other things during that visit I could so I will not include those.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This was the second time in my life that I felt the presence
of somebody else.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other time was
working late at a private university in <st1:City><st1:place>Seattle</st1:place></st1:City>
probably 10-13 years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But that will
leave alone.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My Husband is the one who experienced this, and it was
before we even met. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Anyway, he owned a house in Odin MI, <st1:PlaceName>Emmett</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceName>County</st1:PlaceName> in the <st1:place>Upper Lower Peninsula</st1:place>.
He didn't see it every night but it followed the same pattern at what I have
copied and pasted below:<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><st1:City>Grand Rapids</st1:City> - The <st1:place>Black
 Hills</st1:place> - A house <st1:Street><st1:address>Norwich St</st1:address></st1:Street>
hosts a ghost. On the second story and in the far room at the right-hand side
there is a ghost of a man that sometimes appears to be dressed in clothing from
the 30's or 40's. Sometimes he appears to be an elderly man. At approximately
10:00 to 11:30 the specter wanders from the hallway and then hesitates at the
doorway and then look like it is about to turn around. But then he walks into
the room. The former residence to that place reported that the ghost walked to
the middle of his room and stood there for minutes and then goes out into the
hallway and stands. It is not known when he vanishes. He was last seen in 1996.
<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My Husband moved out of the house in 1993. But the fact that
the house he lived in was the towns old train depot and boarding house. The
pattern and the description on the ghosts walk at the same time of night. it 2
separate houses 200-300 miles apart. The railroad started in <st1:City><st1:place>Grand
  Rapids</st1:place></st1:City> and ended in Alanson which is the neighboring
town to Odin.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We don't know if the Spirit is still in the Odin house, but what
makes me think this one shared an area is that in 1995-1999 the railway was
torn up and the rails used for scrap metal, around the time the Grand Rapids
Spirit was last seen.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">about 15 years ago, when i was in my mid 20s, i was living
in a religious commune with about 15-20 other people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we didnt have a whole lot of room and so most
of the time we shared rooms with other people (all female rooms, all male
rooms) and at the time i was sharing a bedroom with 2 other women.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we all had single beds in different areas so
we sort of had our own spaces.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">one night i had the room to myself (a rare occurrence!) as
the other 2 women were out and i had the chance to get to bed early.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i prepared for bed around maybe 10 pm and
once i turned my light off, there was no light in the room except from a window
that had no draperies across the room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the bedroom door was closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i was lying on my back and had fallen into a heavy sleep
when i suddenly woke up to see a figure floating directly above my face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it was completely black but i could see
details of a cloak surrounding its head (i didn't see a face).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in fact, instead of a face, there was just
deeper blackness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the figure appeared to
have its own light source, since i could make out details sort of, but there
was actually no light involved here....it was just a streaming black cloak, a
deeper black featureless face, and it appeared to be floating above my face
looking at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i felt frozen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i don't know how long this went on but i became aware of the
sounds of one of my roommates coming up the stairs and headed into the
bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it seemed that the figure heard
my roommate also, because it suddenly stopped looking at me, jerked its head up
to look at the bedroom door, and then streaked off to my left, into what was a
closet area that had behind it an attic crawlspace for storage.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">when my roommate walked into the room, i was gasping for
breath and crying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>she turned on the
light and she said that she had heard me scream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the next day the story had made its way around the
commune.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>this was a religious community
and so the figure was explained away as being a demon of some sort, or perhaps
a spirit of death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i was never sure what
it was but the explanation of "demon" seemed too easy to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it didn't seem so much evil as curious; i
figure if it had wanted to harm me, it could have very easily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Haunted <st1:place>Shiloh</st1:place> Battlefield<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: jroyston@charter.net<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">a few years ago my husband &amp; i went to shiloh battlefield
in <st1:place><st1:State>tennessee</st1:State></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i went there with no idea of what was going
to happen there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it was a sunny
afternoon in may and everything was green and bright - not the time you'd
expect to see anything weird.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">before we took the tour of the battlefield, we went to the
guide center and saw a film explaining the battle and what action happened
where.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">after the film you had the option of going with a group on a
tour with a guide or taking a tape recorder and a tape to play and going by
yourself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>neither my husband nor i are
really "joiners" so we opted for the tape player.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">it was a sunday afternoon and really REALLY quiet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we turned the tape player on and listened as
the guide's voice told us where to stop on the tour, told about the spot, and
then you could get out and look around. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">this was going pretty well until we got to the part of the
tour that was called "the bloody pond."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>apparently, during the battle of shiloh, men
and horses were dying all over and about the only place they could get a drink
before they died was "the bloody pond."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the tape said during the battle, the water in
the pond was as red as blood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">we listened to the tape and then we got out and approached
the pond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we sort of seperated...we were
maybe 15 feet from each other, sort of in our own thoughts and looking into the
water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">it was just this very ordinary pond, not as big as a lake,
and adjacent to a big field where part of the battle happened.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">as i stood looking into the water, i felt sort of like i was
going into a different level of consciousness, sort of like how you get when
your eyes are out of focus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>when that
happened, i started hearing sounds, like horses neighing and then i heard
gunshots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i looked up and i could see
dead and dying men and horses, i could hear their voices, i could see fighting
going on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the figures were sort of
transparent but i could see them very clearly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>i sort of shook my head to shake it off and when i did that, the scene
disappeared and there was just the water and the green may afternoon quiet
again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i felt like i was being given a
choice; if i wanted to, i could walk away and pretend it never happened, or i
could watch the scene if i wanted to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i
opted to watch the scene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i stood there
for a few minutes watching the men and the animals and the battle going
on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the water in the pond was red.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it was amazing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i started crying and i felt like my energy
was draining out of my body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i was still
aware of my husband walking around the pond to my left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">finally my husband came over closer to me, and i asked him
if he was experiencing anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he
said, yes, let's get the hell out of here!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>so we left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">that weird, otherworldly feeling lasted the rest of the
afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i was pretty shaken by what
i'd seen and i told my husband about it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>he said he hadn't seen what i did, but he did feel a very heavy presence
of "something."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>after that,
during the rest of the tour, i didn't have as intense an experience anywhere
else at shiloh, though the sense of oppressiveness and overwhelming sadness
lasted until we left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i had a feeling
that the battle was still going on, all around us, just under the surface.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">a while later i wrote to the people at shiloh and asked them
if anyone else had ever reported anything similar happening to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>they never wrote me back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: ctx53369@centurytel.net<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It all started when my husband and I moved into our new home
in <st1:place><st1:City>Riverton</st1:City>, <st1:State>UT.</st1:State></st1:place><span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first all was quiet and we were very happy
to finally be homeowners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was pregnant
during our move and delivered my son soon after moving in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, as anyone who has been a new mother can
confirm, the night became my "familiar".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, as I found myself up at all hours I
realized just how noisy my home was becoming.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We have all heard of a new house settling, and, at first, this is
exactly what I thought it was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as I
listened over time I realized that these sounds happened only at night and were
eminating from the basement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And even
though I could identify some of them, there were many that had no logical explanation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I plainly heard heavy footfalls and the
sounds of heavy objects being slid across the concrete floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We only had boxes in the basement as it was
unfinished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I even went so far as to
have my husband slide a couple of them across the floor himself to see if I
could identify the sounds I was hearing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It wasn't what I heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless
to say, my husband thought that perhaps I was just delerious with fatigue and
started taking on a few of the nightly feedings for me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claimed he never heard a thing out of the
ordinary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, I was inclined to believe
him and tried to just forget it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it
worked for awhile.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">But not for long.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
my son grew and started sleeping through the night, I became much more
rested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But having grown accustomed to
being up in the wee hours, I would oftentimes stay up for 3-4 hours after my
family had retired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My normal bedtime
was between 1 and 2 AM.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd like to
impress upon those reading this account that all was quiet until about 11 PM
each night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And right about 11 PM my
basement became a suddenly noisy place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I can remember hearing the footsteps and hoping against hope they
wouldn't start up the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got the
impression that whoever it was down there was not in a good mood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The footstep sounds were pacing and
aggravated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On several occassions there
would be a loud crashing sound like someone dropped something heavy onto the
floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This my husband heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is a light sleeper and the sound would
wake him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would come running out of
the bedroom asking me if I was alright and what just happened!?!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would tell him it came from downstairs and
he would swear that it sounded to him like it came from the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everytime.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">About a year went by and I began hearing the sounds in the
daytime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would also catch my son, (who
became mobile at about 8 months and was crawling around everywhere) peaking
around the bannister and staring down the steps leading to the basement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was engaged in this activity so often that
whenever I couldn't find him, I would go look there before anywhere else.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>9 out of 10 times I wouldn't have to look any
further.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had considered putting up a
gate, but he never even acted like he wanted to go downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, when we would go down for whatever
reason (as I said, we used the area for storage) and would pick him up to go
with, he would cry and not want to go down with us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then one day, just after Christmas and a
month before his 2nd birthday he was playing on the couch with his dad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When suddenly he snapped his head toward the
landing at the top of the basement stairs, screamed with fright, jumped off the
couch and literally climbed me saying, "oh no, oh no, oh no".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband went to the landing and walked
onto it in an attempt to make him feel better, but to no avail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was afraid of something that he saw
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And then, when he was in his
third year he started telling me about "the bad man who watches
you."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How he knew he was bad I don't
know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I pressed him for more
information he would say,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"He's
just bad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He's mean."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I put a lock on the basement door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In hindsight that seems stupid, but at the
time I couldn't think of anything else to do to feel safer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also took to having my son sleep in our bed
with us as his bedroom was before ours when coming down the hallway and the
footsteps had taken to pacing up and down it all night long.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had come upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I began going to bed with my family and I
always closed and locked the bedroom door now.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I would turn on the t.v. and leave the volume at such a level as to
drown out the sound of the pacing just outside the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently that annoyed our
"roommate".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because after
about a month of ignoring the pacing noises, at about 2 AM one night someone
banged loudly on our bedroom door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>FROM
INSIDE OUR HOUSE!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We all jumped up
terrified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband ordered me and my
son to go into the bathroom and lock the door while he went and
investigated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He came back saying that
there was nothing out of order and the exterior doors were all locked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nobody slept again on that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We sat up all night waiting for something
else to happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Until the following night when the garage
door leading into the house, which had a bolt lock on it and sqeaky hinge,
opened and slammed shut twice within 20 minutes time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both times when my husband ran out of our
bedroom to catch the intruder, he came back saying the door was not only
closed, but also deadbolted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were all
afraid of our house now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Luckily my
husband got a job transfer a few months after these incidences and we
moved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But up until the day we did, we
both had the experiences of being watched.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And we both heard the heavy footfalls in the hallway at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say, we moved to <st1:State><st1:place>Montana</st1:place></st1:State>
with a big collective sigh of relief.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Upon arrival we moved into a brand new duplex
apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was lovely and, for a few
months...quiet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But about 3 months after
we moved in we were all lying on our master bed, which gave us a direct view of
the pass-though kitchen, when my now 4 year old son sat straight up, gasped and
pointed at the kitchen saying, "It's the mean man!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't believe it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I believed him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we pressed him for more he simply said,
"He was looking at you, mommy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like
he always does.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He's gone
now."<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My husband had been helping out on another construction job
that took him away from <st1:State><st1:place>Montana</st1:place></st1:State>
for weeks at a time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He left us the next
day to return to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, about a week
after he was gone, I was in the kitchen making my son's breakfast as he sat on
the master bed watching cartoons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard
him say, "Someone's looking at you."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was like, "What?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
he repeated, "Someone's looking at you."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His eyes were the size of dinner plates when
I looked over to talk to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked,
"Is it the man?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And he nodded
"yes".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Where is
he", I asked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Right
there", he replied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And pointed to
the area right next to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had it been a
real person standing there I would've been touching them!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried to stay calm and brought my son's
waffles into him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sitting on the bed, I
asked him if he was still there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My son
actually leaned around me to get a better look and said, "Yes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He's right there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>See?"<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No, I didn't see and I didn't want to.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I grabbed him up and we were out the door in less than five
minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we returned that evening,
nothing else happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">But 2 or 3 days later I was in the garage when I clearly saw
the shadow of a man wearing a hat (like a soft leather cowboy hat with the
saucer brim) on the garage wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
transfixed by it and walked up to it for a closer inspection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I reached out my hand to touch it, it
MOVED away from me!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was paralyzed with
fear for about 10 seconds or so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
when I did get my wits about me again, I backed away from it, like along the
wall leading to the door into the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And it moved again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time it
came toward me!!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stubbled backward up
the couple of stairs to the door, and grabbing the knob I opened it and
literally fell through the doorway into the house, slammed the door closed and
locked it tight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once inside the house I
put furniture up against it in an effort to keep whatever was in there IN
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I called my husband begging him
to come home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was terrified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My son was terrified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were alone with this thing and didn't know
what to do to make it stop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Later that same night my son and I were sitting at the
dining room table eating when we both heard the sound of voices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like almost party chatter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it sounded like it was coming from a tiny
speaker.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It started in the living room
and came towards us, getting louder as it drew nearer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My boy actually looked behind him as it
approached us, and slowly turned his head watching the sound as it passed by
within 2 feet of us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned my head as
it passed by and watched the sound go into the kitchen and fade away as it turned
the corner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We looked at each other like
"Oh no!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And for the second
time that week we were driven from our home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Only to return to silence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Everything was as it should be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We didn't sleep alot in <st1:State><st1:place>Montana</st1:place></st1:State>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally I convinced my husband to allow us to
travel with him to his jobs, claiming that we needed the adventure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be fun, I assured him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we went with him to <st1:State><st1:place>Arkansas</st1:place></st1:State>,
where we are still.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We didn't even get a
rest brake this time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The disturbances
and my son's sightings started almost immediately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The "mean man" was always looking
at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Always me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew I had to do something, but what?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had contacted psycics about this a few
times and they always confirmed it was a male presence, but some of them said
he was just curious, while others told me they had unsettling feelings about
his intentions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one helped me to get
rid of it!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was always the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Just ask it to go away", they'd
say.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oh yeah, like that worked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This thing knew we were afraid of him and he
liked it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seemed hopeless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Until one day my son and I had just returned home from the
laundrymat and I was running in and out the front door bringing in
clothes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just happened to glance out
the living room window and there he was!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sitting in the backseat of my <st1:State><st1:place>Durango</st1:place></st1:State>!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Watching me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He didn't smile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He didn't
frown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He just stared at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was frozen for a second.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was the first time I had actually seen
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And from the look of him
(weathered, rail-thin, like, haggard looking) I could certainly understand why
my son feared him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He looked like
something out of the old west.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And for
some reason, I wasn't afraid anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was good and mad at him!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I ran out
the front door to do I don't know what.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But I was hell-bent to deal with this thing once and for all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, when I got out there he was
gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">At the end of my rope, I called my uncle and told him the
whole story I just told you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He seemed
to think it was a "spirit guide" and I should send it love.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Uh, ok.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But, let me tell you. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>At this
point I was willing to try anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
I sent it love.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sat in my dining room
and sent this thing as much love and compassionate understanding as I could
muster.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told it I would help it if it
needed something, please just let me know what it needed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on and on...<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There hasn't been a single disturbance for us ever since.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When i was about 10 or so, my mother and father decided to
rent this home on <st1:Street><st1:address>Common Street</st1:address></st1:Street>
in <st1:City><st1:place>Lake Charles</st1:place></st1:City>. The house was
right by Bob's Gags Shop. I don't remember the specific address but i remember
everything that i saw. I came home from school one and my dad picked me up on
the corner of our old house. he told me that we are moving but i will still go
to the same school. i was excited cause the house we lived in was not that
nice. He explained to me about the house we were going to be renting.. when we
got tot he house i loved it. Big yellow house with 3 bedrooms and 2
bathroom..very nice. Well the first time i entered the house, i had the biggest
chill i ever had. my mom asked me what was wrong i told her that something was
funny. i felt really weird. Well minor repairs were needed to the house, so i
helped me dad with them. i kept feeling weird every minute i was in the house.
Around 4 or so my dad went pick up my sister from her friends house and brought
her to the house. she asked me what i done to my hair and i told her nothing.
she said that it was turning blonde. i looked in the mirror and i told her it
is not.my mom did not understand why i was acting so werid and always around
her.She said tht my hair was changing and the my eyes were changing also... I
felt werid all the time and i could not stay away from her. Well later that
night my dad was building a wall for the utility room. he nailed the wood to
the floor which was very sturdy from his foundation. he shook it to make sure
that it was nice and solid in which it was. when we turned to nail the paneling
on he saw a nail come right out of the floor. and flew into the wall. my mom
ran<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to go see. he was white as a ghost.
well after that nothing else happened. About week or two later...we finally got
in touch with the land lord of the property. We asked him about he room inthe
back that was dead-bolted and why we can't enter there. He gave us the key and
told us about the man who lived ther before. He was Satanist and he sacrificed
he son to the devil,and that his son's soul remains in the house. His son loved
his mother and was always there to protect her. He was always around his mother
and never left her side. his son was about 10 years of age and had blue eyes
and blond hair. When we opened the room a gush a cold air came out and the
stinch of rotten meat filled the air, but the room was clean and empty and the
windows were shut. the land lord said that before us nobody has lived ther for
2 years since that accident. i don't know that happened to the man nor the
mother. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I just have to share this little story with all you ghost
lovers out there. In February of 1998 me and a friend of mine went on a once in
a life time trip to <st1:country-region>Australia</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>New
  Zealand</st1:place></st1:country-region> just for the experience of it. (I
highly recommend mortgaging the house, or getting a credit card and just going
on your fantasy vacation, I have never regretted it.)<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One day we visited <st1:PlaceName>Larnach</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Castle</st1:PlaceType>
in <st1:City><st1:place>Dunedin</st1:place></st1:City>, a wonderful little
manor home that entertains guests and is open to the public for tours. The
house has a long rich history. The day we went I would say there were about
five tour groups in the house at one time and each group had enough people in
it that if you were all in one room at the same time, it would be hard to see
much of the room. Because of this my friend and I decided to stay close enough
to our tour to hear what our guide was saying, but we would go into the near
rooms that no one was in so we could really get a good look around.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We walked into one of the bedrooms while our group was in
the next room. I instantly felt like I had intruded on someone, but there was
no one there. I even went as far as to say, "Hello." to announce our
entry so I didn't feel like we had intruded quite as rudely. I felt that I
should behave very respectfully in this room, as if the owners eyes were on us.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Our group was coming into that room next, so my friend and I
left. We were standing in the hallway when we heard our guide say, "This
room is supposedly still haunted by the original owners first wife." Me
and my friend just looked at each other with our jaws dropped. We had
definitely sensed her presence. We were thrilled and honored that she would be
so willing to let us sense her.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It was such a neat experience, I will never forget the Lady
of Larnach, I just had to share it with all of you ghost junkies.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As a side note, there was another room in this house where
the staff gave up making one of the beds because it is always rumpled when they
come back. They suspect another ghost is at work, (or napping - tee hee).<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Happy Haunting Everybody, be nice to your ghost! You may be
their only friend! Help them cross over! <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hey. I don't really know if you would call this a ghostly
encounter, but I think it's kinda strange. When I was 14, i had a dog called
Odie, a little mini foxy. He was like my best friend, even though I only had
him for about<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">2 or 3 years. My parents and brother went on a holiday one
day, leaving me at my friends house, and Odie tied up by a chain out the front
of our house. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">On the 2nd last day that I was staying at my friends house,
we went into town, and I insisted on going to visit Odie. I got there, and
found him hanging off the verandah by his chain, dead. My friend comforted me
all night, and for some reason, we were so terrified all night, so much that we
pushed our beds together and never let each other out of sight. I had a
restless sleep, but then I woke up in the morning and then fell into a deep
sleep. I had a strange dream. I dreamt that Odie was still alive, runnig
around. But then when I picked him up, his eyes kept turning into white. I was
scared and crying, and my mother said "He's passing over, say goodbye to
him now" I told Odie that I loved him so much and I would miss him. Then
all of a sudden, his eyes went normal brown again, and he licked me, jumped
around and ran around the house. There was a hole in our fence next to a tree,
that he would always use to get out of the yard. i ran outside and i could see
Odie look at me, then run through the hole, not looking back. I believe that,
because i didnt have the chance to say goodbye to my beloved dog, his spirit
stayed behind until he could say a proper goodbye to me. Has anyone else ever
had this kind of experience?<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My first and only experience with a ghost was when I was 4,
I and my family went on a holiday trip to <st1:place><st1:City>Whitby</st1:City></st1:place>,
we stayed in this gourgeous house that a man owned. Because I cannot remember
as such the full story of my haunting my mum had told me when I was old enough
to understand. The man who owned the house had told us that the house was
alive, ofcoarse we thought he was just trying to scare us.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>But that night, my
dad had to go downstairs, complaining that the bed was uncomfortable, I was
woken up by the bed moving and was curious where my dad was going. Being me, I
went to follow. My first thought was that he had gone to the toilet, so I went
into the bathroom.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The only thing I can
remember is walking into the bathroom and seeing a figure, from then my mind is
blank, but my mum said that when my dad had found me, the figure had gone, and
I had told my dad what he had looked like. He had a wooly jumper, a beard and a
warm smile. I must have been talking to the man for taleast 10 minutes.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Although it might not
sound like a massive, ultra cool experience but to me it is the best experience
ever!!!!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By: einar214@hotmail.com<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I recently checked your website for haunted places in <st1:country-region>Iceland</st1:country-region>,
being that I am from <st1:country-region><st1:place>Iceland</st1:place></st1:country-region>
myself. I saw that you had 2 places registered. I can tell you about one other
house that is haunted and has been conformed by a news team investigaton from
Denmar. It's the place where Ronald Regan (US former<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">president) and Gorbachev (former president of the Soviet
Repuplic) met to discuss a peacetreaty. It's referd to by Icelandes as
"Hofdi" and is located near the shore in <st1:City><st1:place>Reykjavik</st1:place></st1:City>.
People have been seen walking past the windows often stopping to glance out
while there is no one in the house. This is usually around midnight. I believe
I have some psychic ability since I can almost always sense someone else in the
room and see people around me as though they are walking through a mist or fog.
I have been into the house just after it got dark and I sensed something was
following me and then later on urging me on to go deeper into the house,
specifically the addict. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I went there but nothing was out of the ordenary in there.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Also regarding the viking longship that has been seen by the
American couple <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">and the phrase that they<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>thought they heard, Icelanders have also seen <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">something that might be taken as a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>longship sailing along the coast, but never
to my knowledge have I heard anybody say anything about the vikings yelling
something out. The translation for that phrase is very hard to come by. During
the Viking ear, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Iceland</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was controlled by both the Danes and the Norwegans. The dialect they used ath
that time<span style="">&nbsp; </span>is quite different from what
they use today. Your best chance of getting it translated would be to get
someone from <st1:country-region>Norway</st1:country-region> or <st1:country-region><st1:place>Denmark</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to translate it. It is not Icelandic or "ancient" Icelandic.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I grew up in the neighborhood of Covered Bridge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I used to play in the park and hang out at
the stream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We all would get freaked out
after about 5 min yet it would be clear day light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On a few occasions I had parties in the park
when I was in elementary school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People
would go back there to see and just explore and all would come back saying it
was strange and not know why.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It isn't
even like a large stream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is just two
sides of mud with a little bit of water.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nothing exciting or nice at all, yet one just has to go see it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a farm or just vacant land that backs
up to the stream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One fall we went back
to feed the deer that would sometimes hang out there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can not describe it but we all felt a
urgency to get out after the deer had left suddenly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Note that this was probably 4:00 and very
nice out in the day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It isn't like it
was dark and spooky.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It probably was the
last time I went back past the park or to the park at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, just so you know, you do not have to go
back to the stream to see things or just get spooked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You always feel like you just missed seeing
someone watching you when you turn around toward the stream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is why we first went to the back of the
park.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We all thought that one of our
friends was back there playing a prank.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was shocked to see this on your web page, as I have never heard
stories of it being haunted, but I would really like to know what others find
back there.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Mom had passed away about 5 years ago. I was down the
shore at a high rise hotel one summer, when I decided to go out on the balcony.
I looked down to a balcony below and saw a woman smoking a cigarette looking
exactly like my Mom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I called my wife
out to look and she confirmed what I was seeing. I went back in our
room....laid on the bed thinking....and remembered my Moms birthday was July
14th.....and TODAY was July 14th. I went back to look and she was gone...and
the rest of vacation I did not see her again. Was I getting a reminder from
Mom? could be.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Between the years of 1985 &amp; 1989 I lived<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(upstairs apartment) which I became aware,
was haunted.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I lived there with my then boyfriend, Alan Webb.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">During the 4 years I lived there, upon several occasions
there were extremely loud crashing noises in the middle of the night that would
wake up both of us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes it was one
isolated CR-RRRRASH! <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">...and other times it was a repetetive BANG BANG BANG BANG
BANG!<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">These noises seemingly came from the kitchen area.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Upon checking the kitchen, then the entire apartment, nothing
was out of place, had fallen or broken.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It wasn't our downstairs tennants because they were not home on these
occasions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All was quiet and dark
downstairs.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Sometimes the screens in the diningroom would be taken out
of the windows while the windows were not cranked open, so we knew it wasn't
the wind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The cranks would still be in the screen frames.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They would be neatly standing upright and
positioned against an ajoining wall.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This would happen during the day.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Items would come up missing then re-appear untampered,
months later, with no logical explanation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This would happen during the day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mail, etc.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My pet bird was occasionally frightened upon seeing
"something" or having been tormented, in the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Birds are quiet and sleep at night, you know,
if you're a bird owner.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The "<st1:State><st1:place>Michigan</st1:place></st1:State>
basement" of the home had, at some point, been painted in bright primary
colors and there were all sorts of symbols or Latin spellings on the
walls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cement floor had been painted
red.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In the attic, there was an old (original) wooden door which
at some point had been taken down, laid horizontally and had 100's of candles
burnt on it, as if it were used for a table for bizarre practices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We wondered if former tenants had summoned spirits to dwell
there through witchcraft or seances.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The next door neighbor, an elderly gentleman, who I hadn't
met my first Fall there, told me that two women who were sisters lived in that
home in the early 1900's and stayed in the home for 40 or more years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">(He and his wife lived in <st1:place><st1:State>Florida</st1:State></st1:place>
for several months at a time and would return home only in the Spring.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His name, I remember, was Jack and I want to
say his wife's name was Jane. ?)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
lived in the green house next door.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">He said, "One sister lived upstairs, one lived downstairs
with her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He died in that home,
downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two women switched
apartments when the sister upstairs became to weak to climb the stairs and she
later died downstairs in that home, too."<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Jack also told me that prior to my moving in, <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">"Two girls who were <st1:place>Kendall</st1:place> art
students lived in that apartment upstairs, (just like me) and the two girls had
taken photos of the 'ghost.'"<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I asked him what the photos were "of?"<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">He said it was a white-ish figure at the top of the
stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">He thought the art students were fooling him, but when his
very first words to me were, <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">"So, how do you like living in that old haunted
house?"<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">You can imagine - he had my attention!<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I told him about the noises and crashing sounds, items
disappearing, etc.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Later, in about 1999, I ran into an old neighbor from that
neighborhood, the neighbor who lived next door on the other side... another
brick home similar to my old apartment/home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He said his parents still live there now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their last name is Schantz.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Lon Schantz told me there was a fire a few years ago in that
upstairs kitchen where a lady died.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: theresa.mcmanus.itq7@statefarm.com<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><st1:State><st1:place>Iowa</st1:place></st1:State>, Cedar
Falls, Lawther Hall (Augie and Others)<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Update: Personal Experience - I attended UNI &amp; lived in
the Lawther Hall "Penthouse" in 1994-95 and have witnessed many
strange events while there. Enough to believe in no-uncertain terms that there
is something to the haunting stories. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I'm also fairly certain that there is more than one force in
this location.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The spirit referred to as Augie has always been described as
a playful prankster. One experience in particular occured in the middle of the
afternoon. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The "Penthouse" was made up of nine or so dorm
rooms on the top floor (excluding the apartments &amp; attic above). One
morning it was announced that the power would be shut off to the hall to do
some electrical work. We as a group decided that this was the perfect
opportunity to skip our early afternoon classes. The plan was: Go to lunch,
come back in time for "Days of Our Lives", &amp; then start drinking
when the lights go out. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The plan went as scheduled. We made it back to our rooms at
12:15, just fifteen minutes before Days was to start. We'd decided on one room
to congregate, grabbed up any alcohol/beer we had available, locked up our
rooms &amp; went to the meeting place. The lights cut off right on time as
well, however they didn't stay off as long as we'd hoped; half an hour is all.
Not a lot of drinking could be done in that time and so we all disbursed back
to our individual rooms, rather slowly.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Two minutes later, fifteen+ girls were running from room to
room to feel for ourselves what "Augie" had done. In nearly half of
the dorm rooms, the radiators had been turned to full heat, making the small
rooms a virtual sauna.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The Apartment: Augie wasn't the only story told 'round the
"Penthouse". There is a story about a resident &amp; her roommate
that lived in the apartment, situated upstairs, just outside of what we
affectionately referred to as Augie's Attic. Story goes that in the 1970's
these two girls were roomed up in the apartment (wasn't any bigger that a
regular dormroom). During Semester finals, one roommate lost control &amp;
followed her friend downstairs into the "Penthouse" bathroom, killed
her, drug her down the hallway, up the stairs &amp; back into the apartment,
where she then hung herself. It's also said that there have since been several
attempts to open the empty apartment door which no success. It was even rumored
that not even the local locksmiths could get the door open without taking the
door off it's hinges. I do know that I remember seeing the door open in 1995
right before the "Augie's Attic Haunted House". <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Other things that I've witnessed: footsteps down the hall,
footsteps on the stairs leading up to the apartment, dark shadows in the
hallway mirror, dark form moving down the hallway, cold spots &amp; breezes
when no windows were open, whispers &amp; whistling, hotspots in the walls, the
feeling of being pushed or pulled. Not all of these events were the playful
pranks that we attributed to "Augie". The dark shadows &amp;
footsteps always had a more sinister feel to them. There were occasions of
definate uneasiness. Whether "Augie" exists as told in the stories or
whether he was something else entirely, I, as well as almost everyone who's
lived in the penthouse believed he was real. He may have been a prankster, but
he was our prankster &amp; our group looked on him as our protector. He may not
have been alone, but he WAS there first &amp; the attic, apartment &amp; Penthouse
were his.<o:p></o:p></p>

Walmart (Crossroads)<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Update: Personal Experience - I used to work 3rd shift
there, when it was easiest to detect Jeremiah, the ghost. Although I can only
say that I've experienced him once. At the time of the event, I didn't even
know there was a ghost in the store. It was a very quiet night. I was up front
stocking the shelves around the cashiers when I heard the quiet chime of bells.
Just up the row there was a center aisle display of small wind chimes and they
were ringing softly. I glanced around &amp; didn't see anyone, not associate or
customer. At first I dismissed it as the air conditioning had caused them to
ring, although I quickly remined myself that the store's AC shuts off at night.
I started down the aisle to investigate further and got within a few feet of
the display when all of the chimes rang out loudly as if someone had just
swiped an arm through the whole of them. I stopped where I was, turned and went
immediately to one of the cashiers who had been working there for sometime. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I asked her if she believed in ghosts and she immediately,
without even blinking replied, "Oh, you mean Jeremiah?" Well
curiousity getting the better of me, I began interogating all the long-term
associates. It seems that anyone that's put in any significant time in the
store has had an experience in some shape or form.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I wish I could share their stories, but I wouldn't do them
justice.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><st1:State>Iowa</st1:State>, Beaman, <st1:City><st1:place>Vienna</st1:place></st1:City>
Cemetary<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Anna Weise was a young girl growing up in the early 1890s.
She lived in <st1:place><st1:City>Vienna</st1:City></st1:place> township and
worked a family that lived down the road from her, taking care of the children
&amp; down housework. It's unsure how the whole thing came about, but the wife
got it in her head that her husband and Anna were having an affair. One day it
all came to a head. She accused the girl of adultery &amp; sent her home. Anna
began walking home, but never made it there. She was later found dead, her
throat cut from ear to ear, right to left.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Anna is buried in the Vienna Cemetary just outside of <st1:place><st1:City>Beaman</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>IA.</st1:State></st1:place> She has a tall, spire of a headstone
that reads "Vengence is Mine, Saith the Lord". It was believed that
at night Anna would reappear and search for her murderer and that on the 100th
anniversary, Anna would reveal her murderer.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Vienna Cemetary is a hub of activity around Holloween &amp;
the anniversary of Anna's death. Many a high school/college kid has gone there
looking for evidence and a good scare. It can be noted that in the late 1980s a
group of teens went out there with an old video camera and captured what was
believed to be an apparition. While there they also experienced electronic
difficulties, dogs howling from every direction, and they were said to have
recorded her headstone moving from one location to another. Over the years many
people have experienced car failure within the cemetary, eerie lights coming
from within the graveyard and always dogs howling.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In the early 1990s the 100 year anniversary of Anna's death
approached and with it a kind of hushed excitement that was shared privately
among people who believed in the stories. A private saince was performed at the
location of Anna's death while in the cemetary a group of high school &amp;
college kids gathered to await Anna's return. I was one of those kids. It was
the first time in all the years of visiting the cemetary that I did not
experience a single event. We waited until after 2am, sitting quietly around
her grave. When we'd finally given up, we all stood &amp; said our goodbyes to
Anna. I reached into my pocket and took out the only thing I had with me, knelt
down beside her headstone and said something sappy like, "Anna this is all
I have, but I want to thank you for all the years of enjoyment that you have
provided us." I laid my favorite lighter in the center of the stone base,
a quarter to each side of the spire, then a dime to the outside of that, and
then a nickel and then a penny, except that I only had one penny so I had to
borrow one from a friend. No sooner had someone in our group wished Anna peace
then the place erupted in howling dogs, something which had been lacking the
entire night. We quickly got in our cars and left.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By: peanutt@cox.net <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Per the Oklahoma Haunted Places Index, there is a
"Salina-Old <st1:City><st1:place>Salina</st1:place></st1:City>-the Old
Salina court house".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After visiting
<st1:City>Salina</st1:City>, <st1:State>OK</st1:State>, we were redirected to <st1:place><st1:City>Rose</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>OK</st1:State></st1:place>. on old Hwy 33 or what is now known as
Scenic 41, to Saline Court House.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Please
note the difference in spelling of Salina &amp; Saline.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not a typo error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After visiting with a gentleman familiar with
the property we were told the one &amp; only cemetery on the property is that
which is located within 4 feet of the road, <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
county rd. I believe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cemetery
consists of 7 headstones, some of which are so old the names are no longer
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The best we could tell the last
to be buried was before 1910.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
per a local, as recent as a week ago, they had to reset 2 of the headstones
after someone knocked them down &amp; a couple were ran off by the authorities
for engaging in sexual activity on the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under normal circumstances people are welcome
to come and go as they please but through out Oct. the authorities watch the
property routinely for pranksters &amp; so forth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The gentleman we spoke with laughed &amp;
said there was gossip there was something spooky on the property around
Halloween time. The courthouse itself is taped off with no trespassing signs.
The holding cell is located over a natural spring that you can readily
tour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although we did not visit with him
there is a Cherokee Indian caretaker living on the back of the property who
does an excellent job with the grounds (for over 7 years) but apparently his
job security is in the air with the Cherokee Nation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the museum at <st1:City><st1:place>Salina</st1:place></st1:City>
was of the opinion the Saline courthouse will be refurbished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can only assume the state historical
society plans to do it for the gentleman we spoke with was of the opinion the
Cherokee Nation won't put out any money or effort.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Trees that had to be removed were taken down
to aproximately 4' stumps that some one carved into animal totems.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So per the <st1:City><st1:place>Salina</st1:place></st1:City>
museum there is no old court house in their area &amp; is redirecting everyone
to the Saline Court House at Rose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Follow old Hwy 33 east out of Locust Grove to Rose OK.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Don't blink or you'll miss Rose. A short
distance east of Rose you will see a <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Delaware</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>County</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> road sign.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first street past the sign, turn right or
south, &amp; travel aproximately 1/4 mile.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Saline courthouse will be on your left or the east.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The graves are shortly past the drive way
&amp; could easily be missed if you don't walk the entire property or drive on
south, a short distancepast the driveway.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, the grounds are lovely in a woodland setting with a small shallow
stream running through the property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, it is Saline, not <st1:City><st1:place>Salina</st1:place></st1:City>
&amp; the cemetery is across the creek to your west, not the north as your
index states.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The square of flowers
where the old hanging tree was still exists within only a few feet of the
courthouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The jail cell is also only a
short distance from the courthouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
property due N. of the courthouse land is being cleared and is marked no
trespassing so we could readily see the land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There were no graves to the north of the creek on the courthouse land or
the adjoining land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also across the road
is land owned by a dairy farmer and also posted no trespassing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The road is freshly paved blacktop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hope this helps.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We lived on <st1:Street><st1:address>Lafayette St</st1:address></st1:Street>
in <st1:City><st1:place>Waterloo</st1:place></st1:City> where a little boy was
seen by several persons through our time living there and after.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we first moved in we were all sleeping
downstairs [this was about 5 adults], when we heard creaking on the stairs, we
looked to see who was there but noone came down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just a quick shadow disappearing back up the
stairway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stairs going up had a
small landing to which about 4 stairs were not in the viewers site unless
standing below them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The little boy
never came down past that landing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
grandson once told me that the kohla bears that his grandfather gave him before
his death would begin to dance at night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My other grandson slept upstairs in his crib until one night suddenly
refusing to sleep there anymore.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Several people commented on seeing him through the several next years
when we lived in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally all
agreeing that there was indeed a small boy living in the upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was a friendly sort, as he never really
did anything to annoy any of us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
frightened the children, but that I think was because he was looking for them
to play with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the wierdest
things that I personally saw was upon going upstairs with my daughter and our
dog.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had passed through the hall and
after returning to go back downstairs as we thought our dog acted as if he had
to go outside, there was a wet spot in the carpet [our dog had a tendouisy to
pee in the house sometimes]; right before us was a TRIANGULAR wet spot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now our dog couldn't have wetted in that
manner!<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After we moved out of the house, our stuff remained in there
for a couple of years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People would tell
us of seeing the lights on upstairs and someone looking out the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All utilities were shut off!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My own grandson was one of the persons who
saw him looking out the window, so I knew it wasn't just someone making up a
story to annoy us of someone being in the house.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We have since sold the house and it has been remodeled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we don't know what happened to the little
guy as we friendly called "Our Little Ghost".<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I am a historian for Winston County, Alabama, and naturally,
I visit a lot of cemeteries in our area.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In 2003, I decided to photograph every cemetery in the county.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eventually my list dwindled just a couple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There is a cemetery in Helican named Hefner; actually, there
are only three visible graves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's
located about one-half mile down into the woods (and I mean in the middle of
nowhere).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got my aunt to venture with
me since I don't like walking in the woods alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The person who owns the property directed us
on how to find this cemetery, and after driving through his pasture, we came to
an old road bed that looked horrible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
looked like a tunnel actually.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Briars
were growing everywhere, and we had to watch for snakes since it was in the
early summer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once on this road bed, it
turned straight downhill through water and mud.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We came to a little clearing, where the cemetery was supposed to be
behind in the thick of the brush.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This is where it gets weird.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For some strange reason, something made me look to my right on the
bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There stood a person (or was
it?).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My first thought was gladness,
thinking maybe this person could show us exactly where the graves were.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, I only got see a hairy leg with
checkered shorts on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Right in front of
this was an animal's snout.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After it all
happened, I think it was a horse's nose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My mind said otherwise at the time!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I turned straight around and hollered "BEAR!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Talk about running out of there!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was hard too, straight up hill in
mud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing came after us though.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Later on, I got the guy to carry us back down in there to
show us where the graves were.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He

<p class="MsoNormal">Years ago, in the <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>island</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName>Oahu</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>, I was living in a duplex
near the downtown area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was going to
school during the day and working nights at a hotel in <st1:place>Waikiki</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After classes, I usually take a nap before I
start the late shift.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this particular
day I fell asleep on my couch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Day
became night and everything was pitch black in the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For some reason I awoke quickly and saw an
abrupt flash of a hand in front of my face.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As quick as the hand appeared I felt it smother and put pressure on my
mouth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was frozen with fear--my arms
could not move--but also desperately gasping for air.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I honestly thought that a person was in my
apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, within seconds, the
pressure released and I found myself alone in the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could not sleep after that, of course. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>When I reported to work that night, I told my
co-worker about the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being a
local, he was aware of what took place and said I was the victim of a choking
ghost--an entity that literally tries to choke a person while they sleep. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I've told this story to countless individuals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many agree that it is a choking ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Others think I had a nightmare or experienced
what is sometimes called sleep paralysis.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It's hard to determine what really happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If anything, it was a living nightmare that I
hope I never encounter again.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hello. My name is Dylan . I am but 14 years old, yet I have
had many ghostly experiences in my short life.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I would like to tell two stories, one about my current
house, and one about a friend of mine's house.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This is the story of my house...<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My house was built in 1866 as<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place><st1:City>Stoneham</st1:City>, <st1:State>MA</st1:State></st1:place>.
I have been living in it for about a year, yet I have come into many close
encouters with the spirit that possesses my house. When I first came to this
house, the first thing I noticed was the coldness of the unfinished basement,
even in the hot summer month of July. It always seemed to be chilly down there.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">So one day, a few weeks after I had moved in, school had
started, things were getting colder, I went to my basement to retrive a
bedspread that was still packed in one of the boxes. As I was reaching into the
box, I felt a cold wind pass by my head. I turned, and I saw fingerprints and
the outline of what looked like a face enscribed in the dust of the furnace.
The furnace was on, so nobody placed their hands and face on it in my house. I
grabbed the bed spread, and walked back up stairs. That was my first, and least
freighting experience. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The next time, it happened to my step father. He went down
into the basement for whatever reason.He came back up, white faced, went into
his room, grabbed a cross necklace, and sat down and did the rosary. When I
asked him what happened, all he said was "I saw something..."<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The next encounter happned to my mother. I was talking to
her while she was on the treadmill, again, in the unfinished basement. Then, in
a split second, she fell, but it seemed like gravity, shot her back up. It
looked unreal. We thought it was sheer luck, but again, encribed in the dust on
the furnace was something that looked like "Your welcome." It was
hard to see, but after squincing, you could barley see it.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The latest one, happned to me not to long ago. This is what
I would just call weird. I was walking into my kitchen, and all of sudden, my
hand was SOAKING wet. I have no idea what happned, it was as if I dipped my
hand in a bath tub.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">These are just the main stories, I've had many encouters
with things crossing out of the corner of my eye, cold spots, low buzzes,
things moving alone, things in places where I didn't put them, just plain weird
shit.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This is the story of my friend's house. This is rather
short, but it comes with a picture.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was at my friend's house on <st1:Street><st1:address>8
  Pine Street</st1:address></st1:Street> in <st1:City><st1:place>Stoneham</st1:place></st1:City>,
near the infamous Octagon House. We were just playing some Halo 2 on XBL, and I
was messin' round with my camera phone. I took a straight picture across the
hallway. The .jpg is attached. It was taken, straight on, and that is the way
it came out.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I know this sounds fake, but I swear to god, that that picture
is 100% unaltered.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Thank you for reading this, and I hope that my submission
gets accepted into your site.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As I was typing the paragraph about the low buzzing noise, I
got a phone call from a "No ID" number on my cell phone (the one I
took that picture with) and when I picked it up, I heard the exact same low
buzzing noise.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I have experienced
the Lucy ghost in <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Stoneham</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>High
  School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, since I go there, and have been in the
auditorium, many a-time.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My story is from when I was about 6 or 7. It took place at <st1:Street><st1:address>1158
  South Seminole Drive</st1:address></st1:Street> in <st1:place><st1:City>Chattanooga</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>TN.</st1:State></st1:place> The layout of the house was a living
room when walk in the front door keep going straight there is a back porch in
front of you and a hallway to your right. Down the hallway to your left was the
bathroom, straight ahead was the bedroom, and diaganoly to your right was the
master bedroom. For the back door we had one of those, good for nothing,
slidding doors. The door broke one night and in fear of someone trying to break
in, my grandmother slept on the couch. I woke up during the middle of the
night, to pull the blanket over me more. <st1:State><st1:place>Tennessee</st1:place></st1:State>
winters can be harsh. Then something in the hallway had caught my eye. I looked
up and saw my grandmother going into the master bedroom (my room) with a basket
of clothes like Saturday had already come and she was working on getting the
house tidey. She was fully clothed, her blue ducky shirt, her jeans, her
princess reebok shoes, and as always her hair rolled. I called her name, which
I call my grandmother, "Mom"... she turned her eyes first to the
corner of her eye. Then she turned her head toward me, but her eyes never
moving, they were focused on me. When she got her head fully turned toward me,
she blinked once and her eyes became blood red. It was about a 3 minute
encounter. Yet in every encounter I have ever had, the eyes are always blood
red. I cannot figure out why. They are supposed to be the sign of evil, but
these spirits/ghosts/supernatural beings never hurt me. Why is that?!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In April of 2004 my father-in-law passed away of a massive
heart attack. It was the night that he had passed that my husband and I were
staying at his (my husbands) sisters house so that we could all be together. It
was about 3AM and my husband and I were lying in her living room floor he had
fallen asleep and I was tossing and turning unable to sleep when I felt this
unexplainable sense of calmness. I rolled over to face my sister-in-laws
bedroom and seen what appeared to be my father-in-law, but I knew that it was
impossible. I layed there for a few seconds and then sat up and rubbed my eyes
only to see him still standing there. What happened next I wouldn't believe
unless I seen it which I did. He leaned down and kissed my husbands forehead
and said "Everything will be ok. Don't worry I love you." Then went
into my sister-in-laws room and spoke to her also. I to this day have not told
my husband or anyone else for that matter. It was the most peace I felt through
out all of the funeral procedures. We got his truck and to this day whenever I
drive it I can almost always feel his presence in it. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">its actually taken me a while to actually write this
story.well my sister, belive it or not she can actually see some energies that
are always around us. i now a lot of people wont belive this and they think
shes crazy but is not like that. Two years ago we moved to this new house in
mira loma <st1:place><st1:State>california</st1:State></st1:place>, i mean
brand new, no one is ever lived there before we did. therefore i thought that
no ghost were gonna appear there. a yaer after we moved in me and my sister
were getting in the car to go to school when driving out of the drive way she
stoped and looked at my window. i actually know the look she gives me when she
just saw something, so i asked what is it? she said that a girl not that young
had just walked<span style="">&nbsp; </span>next to my window and
stand there to watched us drive off, she stoped and said she's wearing a white
dress. we drove off and left. when we got home i had completely forgot about
it, we didn't tell my mom anything because that kind of stuff really scares
her. so during dinner we told my step dad. he's the type of guys who don't belive
in anything that has to do with ghost, he sait to us to not be scared and that
he wont believe it till he sees it. well time pass and my sister will continue
to see the girl and she will only go up the stairs and dissapear at the top of
them. maybe three months after that my dad got home late from work, (he is a
nurse RN), he was so tiyer he went upstairs and said hi to my mom and forgot to
get himself a cup of water, so he went back down stairs. this all happen around
2AM. when he got to open the fridg, he looked to the side where our table is
and he said that he saw a girl wearing a white dress seating there looking at
him. in that moment he turned the other way and almost run up the stairs. my
mom asked him what was wrong he said that he had just seen the girl and asked
her to please go back to her home that she's in the wrong place. my mom got so
scared she just locked the door. after that my sister stop seeing the girl and
my step dad now believes that energies or ghost do exist.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By no means do I discount anyone who tells me about seeing
or hearing things that they can&#8217;t attribute to a natural occurance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One particular night, due to a decreased
amount of work to do on my shift, (11p-7am), I came back home. It was a dreary
night in winter, unseasonably warm, with drizzling rain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband and one of my sons were at work
also, which left me with the other children who were asleep in the stairs
bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My older sons&#8217; room was next to
ours and he kept it locked when he was away.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Well, my son has one of those big leather office chairs for his computer
desk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It made this awfully loud
squeaking, wailing noise whenever he leaned back in it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On several occasions I had to go to his room
to investigate in which he was always there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But not on this night.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I had
gone to bed, TV and lights out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
started hearing that noise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just shook
it off at first but the noise continued.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I got up, turned on the lights, and knocked on his door to no
avail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried calling my son at work
but could not get through to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
the noise continued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked and
listened outside of my house, front and back, checked<span style="">&nbsp; </span>everywhere I could in the house but my sons&#8217;
room is the only place that noise occurred.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Well, the noise continued, so I turned on the TV, left my closet light
on and just blocked out the noise and fell asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, my son was really at work and there was
no one in his room that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never
heard that noise again&#8230;.that following night I went to work,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a patient of ours, whom we had considered a
miracle child, had died right before I got there. I did get to see her.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CJ<o:p></o:p></p>

same place as my light...the bulbs would explode ...late at night you could
hear cans rolling down the steps...when checking ,nothing was there...the door
on the stair case would be locked and you could see and hear it being
kicked...but if the door was unlocked you would not see or hear anything...once
everyone was gone except my Aunt,mom and myself...we were in the kitchen and we

there...we heard it 2 times,same tune....once me and my husband were playing
cards downstairs and it was quit ...and then a sound came from upstairs
,sounded like a lamp had been broken into a million pieces....we went up
there...nothing had been moved or broken...then not to long before I decieded
not to stay there anymore...I was cleaning the table and putting dishes in the
sink and there was a women about 20 standing by the refrigerator watching

rooms...my sister also had seen her...in the living room my dad had built some
room deviders with flowers beds at the bottom,mom had hung wooden shoes on it
and they had been there for 9 years...one came off and floated to the
floor....it didn't fall straight down it floated around the devider and slowly
to the floor...there were about 4 people who seen<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it ,was early evening....and my last days
there were diseaster,I had been upstairs cleaning and on my way back down I
felt a push on my shoulders and pulling on my feet...I fell down the stairs and
thought my back was broke...I couldn't move and I was home alone and had no
help....I moved ,my Mother has passed away and there was no need for me and my
family to stay...we got the deed to the house and it was like a book...it

<p class="MsoNormal">A RIFT IN THE CURTAIN<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: Denotesme@aol.com<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">May 23rd, 1999 my husband was diagnosed with lung
cancer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A huge tumor was found outside
his lungs and was inoperable.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Basically, (although we did not know it at the time) his
doctor assumed he had perhaps six months to live.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Needless to say, I was totally devasted and needed the help
and support of some of my family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
daughter opted to come and stay with us.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">So many things that were odd and very unusual happened at
that time, it is difficult to describe them all.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">To begin with, a clock that had never run....a victorian German
wall clock, began to keep time, chime, and ran for several days, for no
apparent reason because it was not wound and should not have even been capable
of running.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It kept beautiful time for
about a week and then just stopped and never ran again.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When my daughter arrived, she was constantly being<span style="">&nbsp; </span>freaked out by all the strange things
occuring in our house...things that never happened before.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My husband began a round of sleeptalking...not just
sleeptalking, no mumbling, long conversations while he was sleeping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All was clear and easy to understand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was having long discourses with invisible
people, ones that we could not see or hear.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My daughter walked into the living room one morning and saw
an old woman with long gray hair looking out the window and the entity just
disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My daughter rubbed her eyes
and thought, "ok, just an hallucination", but, walking to the window,
she found several strands of long gray hair on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have gray hair, but have always kept it
very short...so it wasn't mine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I took my husband for his chemo treatments, we were
always gone for about 8 hrs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had to
drive 130 miles to <st1:City><st1:place>San Diego</st1:place></st1:City> for
the chemo and he sat there for 6 hrs. receiving it.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My daughter saw apparitions so many, many times in our home
during that time, one was a little girl with big blue eyes who liked to stay in
the beds when they were free.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Food would
disappear, small personal items, shoes, clothing....you name it, they would be
gone and then just reappear. I slept on the couch during that time and would
often awake to a gentle hug, or breath on my cheek. Since I am not comfortable
with such things, I would just say,"please, go away", and they always
did.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The odd thing is that we never felt threatened by any of the
presences in our home. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It was as though
a curtain had been pulled aside and all these strangers invited themselves
in....I often wonder if it was because my husband literally had one foot on the
other side.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We were so very, very lucky.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I believe that all our loved ones who had passed over came to lend
support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been over six years now
and my husbands cancer is not in remission, the doctors tell him he is
cured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The tumor was gone within six weeks,
he had radiation therapy for a time, and they finally just dropped it...he has
no outward signs of ever having had lung cancer, just shortness of breath from
the radiation treatment.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My belief is that we were helped by unseen forces that
invited themselves in, and all were very loving....no threat came with
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I realize that it could have been
much different, and thank God everyday for the miracle he gave us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also offer up thanks to all the forces that
rushed to his defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have no idea if
this is a common occurence or not, but, we feel blessed everyday to have been a
part of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thanks so much for letting
me share.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>I live in an old
farm house with my boyfriend and my daughter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The house is very old and has three floors with the third floor the
attic. I was told that there was alot of people living in this house a very
long time ago. The attic is like an apartment, it has its own kitchen and
bedrooms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not use the second floor
because there are two bedrooms downstairs and a bathroom which is all we
need.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A couple weeks after moving in
things started happening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When you walk
upstairs you get a very eerie feeling like someone is right behind you and we
do not even like to walk by the attic entrance because it feels very creepy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do believe in ghosts but I am not very
easily spooked but these couple of things cannot be explained and scared me. My
boyfriend and I were in our bedroom and the door was shut when we heard my
daughter talking to someone, this is not unusual as she is three and talks to
everything, but then we heard a mans voice answer her. It was a very deep
voice. We went out there to see if someone was out there, but of course no one,
but it was very cold. The TV was not on nor was the radio or anything so that
couldnt have been it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also the bathroom light
upstairs turns on by itself and the door opens and closes itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night my daughter was sleeping on the
couch and for some reason I woke up about 4 in the morning. Something was
telling me to check on her so I went out there and god, it was so cold! I just
happened to look up to see the end of a skirt going around the corner to the
kitchen. Of course there was no one there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My daughter has a boobah toy, if anyone knows what those are, the sing
and dance and that is all they do. I was in the bath and my boyfriend was
sitting in the living room and he heard that toy laughing, they do not laugh.
We took the batterys out and it hasent happened again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the next morning i was asleep, and alone
in the house, when i was woken by a very loud banging coming from upstairs. It
was very cold and I had a very bad feeling like I shouldn't get out of bed. So
I didn't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just little things happen,
things out of place, noises and such.... its kinda creepy.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I was out driving around one night looking for a vacant
apartment, when I saw an accident where the driver had been decapitated, but
had been taken away before I got there and I got out to see what was going on
like most of the people in the neighborhood.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A bunch of us were talking about different things when a young girl
around 3 years old came up to her mother and asked if the man was OK.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her mother told her she didn't know &amp; the
Doctors would take care of him.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then the little girl walked up to the group of us saying the
man was walking over towards us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
looked to see if there was anyway she could see someone or had a sixth sense as
they say children do, we couldn't see a thing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was persistent that a man we could not see was walking towards us
then minutes later turned around throwing her hands in the hair &amp; said as a
matter of factly, "He's dead."<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I did end up living at the house on the property I was at
and it gets better.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later that year, I
got a ride home from work on a snowy evening.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My back porch had the light on for me and I saw a man leaning against
the screen from across the yard wearing a red flannel shirt, a ball cap &amp;
shoulder length sandy brown hair with a mustache.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't recognize the man, but thought it
was strange he wasn't wearing a coat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
the time I got to my door, he was gone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No footprints in the snow, no one on the porch or in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My boss who dropped me off saw him standing
on the porch too &amp; asked me if I knew who it was &amp; even watched me go
inside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Weird things happened at that house, TV turning itself on
&amp; off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My (dirty) cast iron frying
pan disappeared off the stove before I could wash it and to this day, still
have not found it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is right in the

<p class="MsoNormal">This is a story that I've never told to anyone outside of my
family, so please sit back and enjoy.It was right around Halloween time of 2000
and it was also my brothers birthday and we all wanted to give Tom (my brother)
a real birthday gift and also do something excitng on Halloween,so we got
booked to go on a ghost tour in this little town just north of where we were
living at the time.we were schedualed to go two nights before halloween and
Tom's birthday was that same day.so we all loaded up in my Ford explorer and
headed to this location.It was to be held in this really huge,but old
cemetary.The group leader had us set up for an 8 p.m. tour with about 10 other
patrons.As we arrived at the cemetary I immediately had chills going up and
down my side.I felt the urge to leave,but for my brothers sake I stuck it
out.The evening began with the group leader giving a prayer of protection and
then advised all of us information of what to do if we were to get separated
from the rest of the bunch.He said not to panic and just to stay calm and at
the end of the tour they will take on a head count and that if not every one is
there when they're through that they will go on a search in the grave yard to
find that lost person.So as 8:10 approached and the group leader began us on
the tour I deffinitly felt a presence there.We took a few camera's along,all of
which were digital and we took a few pictures of the graveyard.The weather was
perfectly normal,no clouds,no wind,the moon shone fully and there were no other
things to cause an illusion of the eyes in any of our pictures (i.e. trash on
the ground, people form the group standing directly in front of the camera
lens',or any lights from that of a car or street lights,besides we were to far
from the street for any car lights or any others to hit us)Anyways, when we got
home my brother said he had a real fun time and then our cousin,Jason called us
(he was also there with us)and said he<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>had seen the most disturbing thing the night before (on our hunt),but it
was as if there were something compelling him not to tell any of us at the
time,he said he saw this figure (of a young woman) go into the woods that were
nearby the cemetary.He said he felt like he would faint,but luckily had the strength
enough to go on with the help of all of us (his family).I just felt like
sharing this.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Story of My Ghosts<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: Terri <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was in my 20's and the adminstrator of a children's group
home for Mentally retarded and emotionally ill children. I lived in the
basement apartment of the home. At night I could hear knocking from a little
entry way where I put my cleaning supplies off from the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We could also hear footsteps on the second
level of the house.This is where the bedrooms were located as well as the
laundry room. We could especially hear the steps while it was meal times. Staff
would go up and check to see who was up there and no one was..yet we could
still hear the steps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One day I came back from a meeting around 10 am. When I
walked into the home. I heard giggling coming from upstairs. It sounded like
two little girls. I shouted out for one of the staff thinking that some of the
kids were home ill from school, however no one was home. I went upstairs and as
soon as I started walking I felt this coldness. There was no one<span style="">&nbsp; </span>home.. No staff..no children.. I checked the
house. I then came to the attic door which we had to keep looked. There was no
fire exit so the door had to be locked at all times. The door began to open in
front of my eyes with no one touching it. I felt this urge to walk upstairs.
This was so not like me I was not a person that would do this but I was drawn
to it. I remember the senation of being so cold. Now it was in August and was
like 90 degrees outside. The attic was so cold. I went upstairs and there I saw
two little images of children playing and smiling. They appeared for like 30
seconds. When they disappeared I was able to go back downstairs. I ran down the
steps and then the door slammed behind me. I went and checked to open the door
again and it was locked.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Throughout my career at that home. We had several events
that occured with these children. They loved to take the laundry out of the
dirty clothes baskets in the laundry room and throw them on the floor. They
also liked to spill the soap. It became natural for me to just go up and check
the house and find this happening and I was just used to talking to them
telling them to knock this off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We had had repair men that have worked on the washer/dryer
and would hollar out talking to children. staff would go up and see what they
wanted..They would say.."nothing just talking to the sweet little girls
that are home today." Myself or staff did not say a word to them.. afraid
that if they knew, they would not come back to work when we needed them. But
little did they know.. all the children were in school and no one else was
home.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Since this time the group home no longer is open. The house
remains and a family moved in.. However the house<span style="">&nbsp; </span>has had several families come and go. I
wonder if they didnt enjoy their extra houseguests.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I'm not sure if this would actually be considered a ghostly
encounter or not. When my nephew was a baby I would take him for walks in the
cemetary up the road from our house. I would walk through the really old
sections and read the head stones while he took a nap. It was a bright day in
the middle of summer. We were in our usual section just looking. Out of no
where I heard or at least thought I did a voice say get the baby home! I looked
around and didn't see or hear anything else. I turned around and did just what
the voice told me to do. It never did happen again. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>My name is Ryan, and
I live with my girlfriend in a house that we bought three years ago in <st1:place><st1:City>Peoria</st1:City>,<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:State>Illinois</st1:State></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About a week after we moved in,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I l went in the bedroom to take a nap (I was
tierd from all the unpacking).<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was in
a deep sleep when my girlfriend woke me up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was being very quiet about waking me up when normally she stands in
the doorway and yells, "Ryan! Get up!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I finally woke up fully and she was whispering, "Come here,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>you have to listen to this."<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
followed her down the hallway, and into the Kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>" Shhhh,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>listen," she said.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I didn't hear anything for a few
seconds,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>until suddenly it started
up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a heavy deep breathing
sound!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stood there and just
listened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It kinda freaked me out,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>but my girlfriend didn't look scared,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>so I didn't act scared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She turned to me and said, "What do you
think it is?"<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I said I didn't
know, and went back to lay down.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I woke
up about an hour later,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and my
girlfriend was sitting in the livingroom watching t.v.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I asked her if she still heard it, and she said,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"No it stopped a few seconds after you
went to lay down."<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A couple
nights later we were at her mom's for dinner,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>and Heather, ( my girlfriend), told her mom about the breathing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her mom told us that refridgerators make that
sound all the time!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was thinking in my
head that I had never in my life heard a fefridgerator sound like that.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next day when I got home from work
Heather was standing in the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
imediately told me to shush.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I quietly
creep into the kitchen with her, and sure enough, our "spirit" was
breathing again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ran to the office,
grabbed my tape recorder, and rushed back into the kitchen to try and capture
the sound.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I recorded for about 10
minutes before the breathing upruptly stopped.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We both went into the livingroom to listen to the tape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We reround it and hit play,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>but all you could hear was Heather tapping
her fingers on the kitchen table.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got
mad and said,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"You should have been
quiet,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>all it picked up was your
tapping!" ,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and thats when she
said, " I wasn't tapping my fingers or my feet or anything else for that
matter."<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was really kinda
freaked out then,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>but I got over
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We still live in the house, and
still hear the breathing every now and then.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We have played the tape for many of our friends and family who usually
just laugh, or get wide eyed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
breathing doesn't bother us,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and we are
so used to it that we rarely hear it when it does start up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>my aunt,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>heather's sister, and
heather's dad have all stood in the kitchen with us at some point and listened
to the breathing with us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have tried
to record the sound many times since the first recording,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>but usually only pick up the sound of
whispers,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>or the same tapping we heard
the first time,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>never the
breathing.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I just thought I would
share my haunting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hope you enjoy,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and if any one has a similar experience or
can explain this experience please let me know.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I have two stories for your website. In 1995 my Grandmas'
boy friend of 10 plus years died in our garage of a heat attack. For the next
three months she swore when she woke up that she could smell coffee being made
or eggs and sausage being fried. I never reayl thought about it because i new
the loss of Ken was a heavy blow to Gram. I don't know if this was all that
happened to her, But thos is what she shared with me some years latter.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My second story is more of a dream. My Great Great Aunt
Hellen was very ill and was spending the night at our house. She was sleeping
in the room right blow mine. In my dream i dreamed that a girl with a cloak
holding a scythe came to get my aunt. I fought her off and won. Some weeks
latter my aunt was fitted with a pacemaker and is still alive. That was in
2001. Now she is 84 years old and is decent heath.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">First let me say that I am a 29 year-old-male from <st1:State><st1:place>Kentucky</st1:place></st1:State>.
I think I was about 14 when this happened. I also want you to know that I am a
skeptic when it comes to ghosts and believe that there must be a logical
explination to everything even though it may not be a logic that we currently
understand. If asked about U.F.O.s, I would have to say that I am very
skeptical, but the possibility is far greater than the possibility that there
are spirits of the dead walking amoung us. The reason I mention this is that
this story falls somewhere between U.F.O.s and ghosts. I want to assure you
that as God is my witness this is a true story. It has recently been on my mind
and really scares me anymore. So enough already, here is the story: It was late
one evening in mid-summer about 15 years ago. You see, I had this very strange
habit: I was always absolutely obsessed with throwing rocks. I would spend
hours doing this. I had one spot in particular where I spent much time engaged
in my hobby, as there were many rocks there. The spot is located about 60 yards
up the hill behind my house. Because the summer days were geting very hot here
and one was advised not to be out much in the day, I had adopted the habit of
waiting until evening to go out and do this. It was a ritual that I had
repeated many nights before, just about every night for the last month or so. I
was a rough boy who was never afraid and all the ghost stories in the world
would not have kept me from my love of stone-throwing. So this night I was out
there sitting in my usual spot just throwing away. I had been doing this for
about an hour, and it was just beginning to get dark, probally about twilight.
I heard the front door open to my house and knew that my father was coming out
to tell me it was getting dark and to come on in so he could go to sleep
without worrying about me. He came around the house and stoped at the bottom of
the hill, then yelled "Donald! Eric! Come on in it's getting dark, and I
want to go to bed." Now Eric is my little nephew who was about 9 years old
or so. I sat there a minute and said sort of low like "Huh? Ok." He
stopped, walked a bit closer and again said "Donald! Eric? You boys get in
here now." Now I stood up and said, "Eric is not up here. He is there
in his room. I am the only one up here. He walked up the hill and asked,
"Well, who were those people you were talking to?" I said, "No
one. I am here alone." I could see that scared him. He said "Donald,
honey, are you sure Matt and Eric are not up here?" I said, "No, Matt
(who is Eric's little friend) is not even here tonight." He said that
there was someone there behind me and did I see them? I said no, and we went
and looked around the yard. We searched everything very thoroughly and went in
to confirm that every family member was where they were supposed to be. They
were. We got my brother up, who got his pistol and went up the road to see that
there were no strangers in the area and further search the yard. All the while,
my poor father was not saying much. He was so scared, and I had never seen him
frightened before. It was not until the next morning that he had recovered
enough to give us the whole story. My father said that when he walked out he
saw two little people standing there dressed in white, like a "damn doctor
or something" to use his words. He did not see me, as I was sitting down
and he assumed that the little people -- whom he estimated to be about 3 1/2 to
4 feet tall -- were me and my nephew. When he yelled he said they ran around
the side of the hill above me then went behind some small buildings of ours and
he never saw them again. Now it is important to know that our yard is totally
fenced in two sections, the "little white men" as my dad put it were
behind me on the other side of the fence. There was an open gate which went out
into our yard which is also fenced. They could not have gotten into our yard
without me seeing them and even so could not have crossed our fence so fast --
and then world certainly have been heard by us and the dogs. My father admitts
that this scared him worse than he had ever been scared before. For months he
would not go out after dark and after that never went out unarmed. It was not
until he used the phrase that "they were standing there looking right down
my shirt collar" that it scared me some. I hope you are interested in this
story. What I was wondering was have you ever heard anything similar to this
before? If you have or ever do I would appreciate you letting me know. I sure
haven't a clue what they were. I often wonder where would I be if my father
hadn't came out that night. Or how many other nights they had been there
before.<o:p></o:p></p>
