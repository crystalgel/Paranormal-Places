Figures in the Gum Tree<br>
<br>
<br>
By: black_kat_1313@msn.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I never realized the amount of unexplained things that happened to me
until I stared thinking about my experiences, lumping them all together
and questioning whether I really could put them down to just
imagination. As a fairly balanced teenage girl I haven&#8217;t exactly
advertised the fact, see what you think&#8230;<br>
One of my very first memories involves unexplained appearances. I was
about three years old (I am now 16) when I was out in the front yard
playing. It was fairly early; I remember my mum was still in bed, when
I looked up into the small gum nut tree (probably about 4m high.) It
was really strange, there were little wrinkled old people about three
inches high and what probably would be best described as gnomes dressed
in old style clothes all over the tree. There were both men and woman,
some&nbsp; were wearing gumboots others plain dresses, they seemed out
of proportion and chubby, their heads seemed bigger than a normal
persons would be compared to their body and all were older, like
grandparents.<br>
They seemed frozen, most of them smiling; I was fascinated and didn&#8217;t
feel threatened so I tried to reach the closest ones, an old man and a
woman sitting in a small rowboat balancing on the lowest branch. I
jumped but I couldn&#8217;t reach and so I asked them to come down. They
remained frozen and I became frustrated so I threatened them (you must
remember I was only 3 and had no idea how to deal with the situation)
eventually I realized I should show mum and she could reach them so I
ran inside, mum was still half asleep and brushed aside my stories as
my imagination and remained in bed. I ran outside again to find them
gone and the tree once again bare. I haven&#8217;t seen them since and I have
apologized profusely for threatening them and I somehow believe they
understand ( know I probably sound insane right about now but that&#8217;s
just what happened.)<br>
I have had several other things happen to me that I cannot explain
logically but I&#8217;ll put them under another heading because it would be
too long, please e-mail me if something similar has happened to you I&#8217;m
so sure it wasn&#8217;t just my imagination, thank you, <br>

Haunting in Private Residence<br>
<br>
By: jmbolles94121@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I lived in Boston for 3 years.&nbsp; Late 1990s. The elevator would
constantly be on the move, would go from floor to floor without any
operator,&nbsp; would often open as I approached from the hall. Many
service persons attempted to solve the problem, none could, and usually
they were skeptical re. our information.<br>
One evening, the butler and I were enjoying a respite in the kitchen,
after a busy evening getting our employers organized and off on a trip.
We distinctly heard a box being dragged across the floor overhead. The
butler told me to search the bottom floors while he searched the top
floors. I laughed at him, because the floors overhead were heavily
carpeted and it was impossible for what we had just heard to have
happened!<br>
Today it is a private residence, but in the earlier years, mid 20th
century, it housed 10 small apartments. One morning I greeted an old
woman at the foot of the front stairs, who promptly vanished! Later the
mailman told me that an elderly woman had lived in the house for years,
and had died there. She had not been found til she had been dead for
several days.&nbsp; Maybe she was my ghost?<br>

My Great Grandmother<br>
<br>
By: Tiffylou5@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;i am 23 now and when my great grandmother died i was about 14. (
this is a bizarre story) any way b4 she passed my parents had bought a
car of&nbsp; her since she was so old she couldn't drive any more and
my Mom needed a car. along with the car they got her tag. she had the
tag when she was in her 20s. it had the numbers 666 in them. she was a
very nice women so i don't think that means any thing. i just think she
likes the # 6. on with the story. well she passed and the&nbsp; family
had a family auction were the family bought her stuff. my father got a
lot of things and for me he got a ring a little blue glass bird and an
old deck of cards she had in the 50s. she had used the heck out of well
i was bored one day and took it upon my self to count the deck of cards
and one card was missing.now back to the 666 tag well happens to be the
6 was missing from the deck. very weird. couple of years later the 6
reappearred. as i said 6 must of been her # nothing evil. since she
passed i have also had a dream once and a while that i am in a car
driving past her and she is waving to me. i think she is watching over
me and letting me know she's there. every time i see the #6 i think of
her by the way my parents have gave the licence plates of the three 6s<br>

Mother My Ghost<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
My mother passed away in December 10th of 2004 and a month afterwards
to the date I was sitting if front of the computer at work inputting
data. When I came up to a patient with my maiden last name, so I keyed
in the last name and low and behold there popped up my mother's name
and information but she had never been&nbsp; seen at this clinic. There
was never a visit, a bill or anything.&nbsp; Since then I have had
experiences with the light bulb in my closet it will flicker and then
within a couple of days it will come lose and unscrew itself. Just the
other day my husband said a picture of her that sits on the mantel just
fell off that same day I went to my closet and the light flickered and
later that same day it unscrewed itself. So I had my husband screw it
back in, I'm waiting to see what or how long it will take till it
happens again.<br>

Alice<br>
<br>
<br>
By: Mallie.Schorege@Husch.com<br>
<br>
This is a story told to me by my mom&#8230;several years after it happened
because she said she couldn't tell it before then.&nbsp; I was about 11
years old at the time and lived with my mom and stepdad when the
incident happened but I have to give some background first before I get
to it.&nbsp; <br>
My mother had a sister who had Down's Syndrome that had passed several
years before I was born due to the typical problems often associated
with Down's-heart defects.&nbsp; Her sister, Alice, had passed when my
mom was in her early twenties and Alice was in her mid-thirties (quite
a feat for a Down's person to make it to such a ripe old age!).&nbsp;
My mother ADORED her sister as did her whole family even though, when
Alice was born, the doctors had told my grandmother to "put her in a
home and forget about her.&nbsp; She'll be nothing but
heartbreak".&nbsp; My grandmother wouldn't hear of it and raised Alice
just like she was just as normal as her siblings.&nbsp; And Alice grew
up as the most loving, generous person you'd ever want to meet.&nbsp;
My mother and her brothers and sisters loved Alice and were very
protective of her.&nbsp; My mom would tell me stories about her when I
was little and how Alice would bring such joy to all of them even
though she was stubborn as a little goat!&nbsp; It seemed she loved the
drama of soap operas in the afternoon and would sit contentedly on the
floor of their living room enthralled while the storylines would play
out on the screen.&nbsp; But, my mom said, you did NOT interrupt Alice
while she was watching her soaps or else this sweet little thing that
loved everyone would turn into a snarling bear!&nbsp; My mom would
laugh about it as she told me. <br>
Anyway, Alice passed and one night, in the middle of the night several
years later, my mom was woke up by the phone ringing.&nbsp; As I said,
by this time I was 11 and Alice had been gone several years (before I
was even thought of so you figure she'd been gone about 20 years at
this point).&nbsp; My mom, when she heard the phone, reached for her
beside table where her phone sat figuring that something had happened
to one of my sisters&#8230;why else would she get a call in the middle of the
night??&nbsp; She picked up the receiver and said, "hello?" and from
the other end came a voice that said only one word, "Paula?"&nbsp;
Paula is my mother's name and she knows for a fact that it was Alice on
the other end.&nbsp; You see, like many Down's people, Alice had a
particular speech impediment due to how her tongue protruded slightly
from her mouth.&nbsp; It made her talk a little garbled&#8230;and very
distinct.&nbsp; My mom said she sat up quickly and listened, gasping
for breath, waiting for another word.&nbsp; No other word ever came,
the line went full of static and then died.&nbsp; She set the phone in
it's cradle and sat there for a moment.&nbsp; My stepfather, who woke
up then, asked her who was on the phone.&nbsp; "My sister, Alice" my
mom said quietly, shaking.&nbsp; <br>
"Isn't she dead?" was his response and it was then that my mother broke
into uncontrollable sobs.&nbsp; He sat there and hugged her for a long
time, trying to console her.&nbsp; She told me about the incident when
I was about 18 and said that when she got that call, she was so
incredibly happy to hear Alice's voice again and she said that she
thinks it was a message from Alice telling her, years later, that she
was ok and still there.&nbsp; It was very emotional for my mom but she
said she wouldn't trade that call for the world.&nbsp; I can't say I
blame her and I told her that when she passes on, I fully expect the
same courtesy call to me that her sister provided to her&#8230;just a quick
hello to say that she's sticking around to watch over me!!<br>

El Perro Negro / The Black Dog<br>
<br>
<br>
By: ms_lmartinez@juno.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
My dad told me a story that I think you would find very interesting. In
the town my dad grew up in there was a story called El Perro Negro or
The Black Dog. The lore begins with a single man working on in the
power plant. The city was small, it wasn&#8217;t anything big. But he was the
only man specializing in electricity back in those days. It was the
turn of the century, pre-war (1913). The man found himself alone many
years in a grandiose Victorian home too big for a single man with now
family. His only companion a big black dog and his many books for he
was a well educated man from a wealth family. <br>
One day the man heard about the revolution that was coming. Villa and
his men were getting near. It was time for an adventure, and the man
soon left with the revolutionaries. It was very soon after that a big
black dog began to appear between the Rail tracks near his house. It
was a long and lonely road that connected one small town to the next
that ran along side the rail way tracks. Many people began to avoid the
road, deciding to go around that long way. There was no doubt the dog
was a cursed for he only appeared at night, and barked viciously at any
one who got near. <br>
Years passed, and a family had already settled into the man's home
whish was owned by the electric company. The black dog became infamous.
People avoided the area after sunset, and no one dare got near. And so
it was, that many years after the war, and the country had settled in
to its new way of life, and the economy was begging to burst, vehicles
had been the norm. World War II had come and gone and my father was a
young man when he witnessed the end of the legend of the black dog. An
old man walked into town he wore an old revolutionary outfit. Big hat,
ragged boots, and handle bar mustache. He could have been Villa
himself, but it wasn&#8217;t it was the man from the electric company. Many
people greeted him, he was still recognizable as an old man, with his
green eyes, and charming smile, and prestigious prideful march.<br>
Before he could reach his destination he was stopped by another old
man, his grandson and my father. The men talked for hours, recounting
there life&#8217;s adventure, and tragedies. Finally, one man said to the
other &#8220;you know there&#8217;s a vicious black dog over the tracks where
you&#8217;re heading at&#8221; that Revolutionary responded, &#8220;She&#8217;s not vicious,
she&#8217;s my bitch.&#8221; laughingly. The three men (including my father) stood
in shock as the old man walked away. <br>
He knocked on the door of his old Victorian and introduces himself to
the new family that had moved in after the one that moved in after him.
They graciously let him in after all his things were still stored down
in the basement. But he didn&#8217;t really come for his things; &#8220;after all&#8221;
he said &#8220;I could always buy new things&#8221;. He thanked the young couple
for there hospitality, and walked across the now highway. He walked
over to the tracks and stopped between them. He had pulled out a shovel
and began to dig. He dug right in the place where the Black Dog had
been spotted night after night after night for the past 4O some
years.&nbsp; <br>
As the man stood digging under the sunset, my father took an interest
to the old mans madness, not sure if he should believe the town&#8217;s
legend of the demon dog or to believe that this brittle old man could
have anything to do with it. Hours passed and people gathered around
cautiously at a distance. The dog did not appear that night or any
other night after. The old revolutionary dug up the body of a big black
dog, of course by then it was just an old black leather sack with a
head hanging from it. He reached inside the beast mouth and pulled out
a handful of gold coins. <br>
My father, his friend and his friend grandfather soon joined the old
man for some tequila shots. And he revealed the truth behind the Black
Dog; after hearing that Pancho Villa was on his was soon going to
arrive at that town. He realized he was a filthy rich man representing
in looks as in life style the very thing Villa was against. He opted to
set an enchantment on the dog. He was a well educated man, and in his
many years of traveling he had come across many things in his young
life on being the dark arts of Voodoo and Santeria. Having himself read
books he felt he knew what to do. <br>
He took his dog one night to the tracks and told him he was to stay
there until his master returned. The black dog was not to let any one
near this treasure, he said. He then cut him open gutted him, filled
him with all his coins, and cash, and sewed him back up again. He
buried him between the tracks right across his house, he was sure no
one would dare go digging around between the tracks especially with a
huge black enchanted dog there. Then he disguised himself as a peasant
and joined the movement. He discouraged the overtaking and burning of
his former home, and had many experiences and adventures along side
villa in his army, and post war, he just wondered about, fighting for
justice and living off the kindness of supporters and strangers. He
explained that now that he had his money he was going to retire in the
riches he was born into, but not before paying some kindness back. And
like any old western, he disappeared into the sunset, never to be seen
again.<br>

Ghost Cake<br>
<br>
<br>
By: billybirdtwo@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
The Hose and Hound Pub in Calgary, Alberta, used to be a firehall. When
the house was saved by the fire department, Mrs. Cross would send a
cake every year at Christmas for them to eat. I think she died in the
1950's but the cake she sends every year is still seen. A friend and me
are pretty sure we saw it.<br>
Back in 1988 when I was having something to eat with a friend of mine,
we saw a cake sitting on one of the tables down from us. I Didn&#8217;t think
anything of it until I asked if I could have some for desert. The
waitress said they didn&#8217;t serve cake, only apple pie. I told her I saw
a huge white cake sitting on a counter just down from us. She must have
thought I was crazy. But my friend saw it as well. Of course when we
went to look for it, it was gone. I forgot about it until I read about
the cake Mrs. Cross would send every year to the fire hall for putting
out a fire at her house. A ghost cake? I don&#8217;t think so. But I know
what I saw.<br>

Mortimer<br>
<br>
<br>
By: belleandguaca@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
I lived in a townhouse in the community of Ocean Beach in San Diego,
California.&nbsp; I had about 15 different roomates in that house and
the one common denominator between all of us was experiences with our
ghost, who I dubbed Mortimer.&nbsp; We all had the distinct feeling
that our spirit was a man although none of us actually saw him
clearly.&nbsp; My best friend Jaimey and I were the first to live there
and things began almost immediately.&nbsp; I started noticing footsteps
upstairs when no one was home and a distinct feeling that I was not
alone...when I should have been.&nbsp; I noticed that sometimes when I
was washing dishes I would see a form of a man gliding across the
carpet out of the corner of my eye and would turn around expecting to
see my boyfriend and there was never anybody there.&nbsp; I remained
mum about my experiences at first thinking it was my imagination.&nbsp;
One evening I was getting ready to go out and was conscious of keeping
my stereo down as my roomate was sleeping.&nbsp; <br>
As I was doing my hair in the mirror I heard my stereo suddenly start
blaring.&nbsp; I ran into the bedroom and looked incredulously as the
dial turned up louder and louder.&nbsp; I put my hand out to turn it
back down and it went all the way down the volume 2 before I could even
touch it.&nbsp; I ran into my roomate's room and yelled that we have a
ghost...she sat up in bed and said she knew and went on to detail all
the experiences that I had that she had also had.&nbsp; As the roomates
came and went we started to consider Mortimer an initiation.&nbsp; We
never mentioned him...but everytime, they would eventually come up to
us sheepishly to ask if we'd had any experiences.&nbsp; One roomate was
in her room with the door closed when she heard a scraping under the
door and saw a gardening glove that had been laying in the hallway
being lodged under the door.&nbsp; She ran to the door and threw it
open to find no one and no one else was home.&nbsp; At one point, that
girl and I were sitting downstairs talking when without warning the
faucet in the bathroom adjacent turned on by itself full blast.&nbsp;
The toilet would also flush by itself.&nbsp; He seemed to like
electronics and our stereos, vcrs, dvd players and other things would
turn off and on at random.&nbsp; Another girl said she was trying to
leave the house at night and turned off thre light in her room but
before she had gone three steps she heard the light flick back on in
the room.&nbsp; She turned and saw that it was indeed on.&nbsp; This
happened two more times before Mortimer let her go out for the
evening.&nbsp; I have since left the house but I am sure that Mortimer
is still breaking in any new renters that move in.<br>

Anniston AL<br>
<br>
By: jesswnchstr@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
You have a very cool website. I wanted to share my story that happened in Anniston, Alabama.<br>
Several years ago, I worked at a small warehouse in Anniston, AL, on
south Wilmer Street. I volunteered to work late alone and the other
employees warned me not to stay after dark. After everyone else had
left, I started hearing strange noises like something was pounding on
the concrete floors. It felt like there was an angry presence in the
building. I left and quit soon after that night.<br>
A few months ago, the local newspaper reported that dead bodies had
been found under a house on south Wilmer. My grandmother had lived in
Anniston as a little girl and remembered that I had worked in that
area. She said that in the 1960s many of the old homes had been torn
down to make way for stores and warehouses. When the lots were cleared,
bodies had been found. No one could prove what had happened, but when
the original houses had been built for the local mill workers, several
local single women disappeared.<br>
The rumor was that a carpenter who had worked on the mill houses would
seduce single women. He knew they were lonely and upset because they
had become old spinsters and weren&#8217;t married. He would take them to the
construction sites to show off his work on the homes but they had to go
after dark when the carpenter&#8217;s boss wasn&#8217;t at the site. The carpenter
would kill the women and hide them in the foundations of the new homes.<br>
The warehouse where I had worked was built on one of those sites. I
don&#8217;t know if the spirit was the carpenter or the ghosts of the
murdered women. I was afraid to stay there and try to find out. I think
it&#8217;s a printing and mailing place now. I&#8217;ve heard that strange things
still happen there at night.<br>

Never Went Back<br>
<br>
By: littlebit_bennett@yahoo.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<br>
once when i was about 17 years old me and my uncle (who is only 2 years
older then me) found out that his older sister was not his sister but
actually his biological mom...however upsetting to him,he relized
suddenly things kinda made sense..he, however never had much to do with
her and was in no big hurry to have that change.when he was 19 my
grandfather died (his father) my grandmother followed shortly later..he
called one day and asked if i would go to kentucky with him to visit
his biological mom and several brothers and sisters..there were 3 boys
and a girl..they ranged from ages to 8 to 17..the girl being the
oldest..we were all related..but he was uncomfortable going alone..my
uncle and i hung out a lot many times..he realy had no friends he was
shy and pretty much a book worm..<br>
well i travled with him for several hours to my aunts home (his mom).i
know it will be fun. there comical . there actually great people..<br>
we arrive at there house around 6 or seven friday evening and they have
made a place for us down stairs in the basement..the basement smelled
totaly like a basement but, was nice..it had a bathroom..it looked like
, well i thought an old freezer or something it was strange..but there
was only a livingroom set up down there and the wierd but nice bathroom
down there.now i must exlplain the set up of the house.as soon as you
walk in the door to the house there is a hall way, and you take about 5
steps and to the left is the bathroom..then about another 5 steps and
to the left is&nbsp; 4 steps up to a opening to the kitchen..(wierd i
know) then<br>
2 more steps past there is about 22 steps down to the basement..the
kitchen is set up to were as soon as you walk in the room you have to
avoid the table and chairs..there is a door on the other side of the
kitchen that leads to a wide foyer then the living room and another,
larger, foyer and a set of stairs to the3 bedrooms on the next floor. <br>
odd set up but the room a fairly large, exept the kitchen..<br>
well anyway we talked and laughed for awhile and made fun of eachothers
most imbarresing moments..which in my case far to many, and suddenly
there fireplace just kinda, well burst into flames..it made me
jump..james (my uncle )&nbsp; fell in the floor..he was setting right
next to it..of course we made fun of him...he's a verly large guy..as
in round..very heavy..(he's wieght makes him shy)he finally gets off
the floor and&nbsp; my uncles mom and her husband tells us that the
house is haunted and this happens every nite..and proceeds to tell all
kind of things they have heard and witnessed...you have to understand
they aggravate (in a nice way) constantly..me and james humored them
and soon relized they we honestly believeing this stuff...i thought o
great more wierdos in the family..(like i dont have enough already)
ghost, parrnormal was something i watched on tv...james was like me..he
though it was stupid to believe such things..later everyone wanted to
play cards but&nbsp; i was tired and told them i was going to bed and
if they decided to play come get me and i would...my uncle joined me
and we went to the basement ..there was an old cot ..then one nice
comfy couch...we fliped a coin for the couch ...i lost the toss..but
insisted to my uncle..that being a girl i needed the couch, then wined,
then begged..and then did the lip thing and stomped my foot..so he gave
in...( i knew&nbsp; he'd give in) i dosed off..i woke up because i
could hear my family upstairs in the kitchen they were laughing and
giggle..nothen strange, and as i listen i relized they were playing
cards..i could hear the chairs moving under them and what sounded like
someone drinking out of a glass, i could hear them being placed back on
the table.. i heard cabinets opening and things of that nature..you
know the sounds of people playing cards in a kitchen, noises. you have
to understand im a big chicken..if it didnt sound normal you wouldn't
see me move eneywhere near that direction..they were laughing and
having a good time..so i looked over and james is snoring .so i dont
wake him and i go up the stairs stop and turn at the landing there and
i rubbed my eye's (they were still blury) and walked up two steps about
to hit the third so that i could see in the kitchen and like all of a
sudden ..nothing..i was standing there in a dark kitchen..no one was in
there...i walked to the opening into the foyer looking room and it was
dark..just a dim lamp was on not bright but very dim..it was on for a
nite lite..so it was dark in there but you could see well enough...i
didn't feel scared . i just felt wierd..i relized i had been
dreaming..i just turned and made my way back to the basement..i laid
back down....no thoughts no nothing..wasnt worried, i just thought (key
word here) it was a dream...james was not snoring eney more and
apparently stirred enough to cause him to stop snoring..took note of
that for when he started back up again..and then i began to hear them
again..just like before, laughing joking, only this time i hear someone
slide there chair as they stood up to get somthing out of a drawer...i
heard the drawer open, heard them fiddling around in there and then
slide there chair back to sit on it and it sounded like a fork or some
thing of that sort being tossed on the table...so i am sure im awake
this time ..and now relized they are trying to scare me..i think this
is funny...so i walk up the stairs very quickly, i hit that landing
turn to start going up the stairs and on that 3rd step right before i
can see in......it stops...no sounds, no people, no cards,just a very
dim lit room....huh i think...so i hurry to track through the house to
look for them, thinking there hiding in the livingroom ..well no
one...every thing is still and quite..i relize im totaly creeped
out..which is not unusual to me..im in a different house that im not
used to, and its dark..but i am so sure there trying to trick me...im
am not falling for it...i walked back through the kitchen notice the 2
chairs pushed out, so i push them back in..i see one cabinet door open
and i walk over and&nbsp; i closed..no big deal...i walked backed down
to the basement, i laid back down and i waited..withen just a few
moments i heard them again..same noises as before..laughing , chairs
moving under the wieght of someone as the threw a card on the table and
shouted read um and weep....then laughter and some aahhhhssss
proceeded..i then heard a glass hit the floor and break i heard the
piecies sliding everywhere...well i thought.." gotcha now " i jumped up
and ran up the steps as fast as i could taking two steps at a time,hit
that landing and started for the last 4 and ..well there was
nothing...no people no nothing....i start to walk and jerked my foot
off the floor...i stepped on glass...i knew they would not leave a
mess..i knew there were to many people to get out of the kitchen fast
enough without making alot of noise..i knew the room was still and
dark...still not thinking i walked up the stairs and my mind being so
confused&nbsp; i was not scared or thinking ghost.i.went to go and look
in the boy's room..i knew if little robby was in on it ..he would not
be able to hold in he's laughter, i opened the door and they were sound
asleep..i went in and sat next to robby and he did stirr but only
because i sat on his bed he rolled over and never knew i was there..i
looked at the other two boys and the were sound asleep...i walked to my
other cuzins room and when i went to grab her door nob i heard
footsteps behind me..they were heavy steps like my aunts husbands would
have been..i turned around and no one was there...im looking and theres
no person just there&nbsp; footsteps coming towards me...well i didnt
know what to do..i stood there with my hand still in the air from
almost grabbing the door knob to tonya's room and my mouth was wide
open..(im sure i looked like a complete slack jawed<br>
dork) the footsteps got closer and closer untill it stopped directly in
front of me..im still in the same position..im scared and&nbsp; i could
move but didnt...about two minutes went by and im still standing there
not moving an inch..i was thinking it was gone...thinking im just crazy
...i relized this is not real..and im silly..i drop my hand down finaly
and am still facing the direction i heard the noise from..i still don t
walk eney where..i just stood in the same spot..trying to convince
myself im imagining it...thats the price of being a chicken..you tend
to overreact to things...i start to take a step and i hear the
footsteps again only it sounded like it was moving out of my path so i
could walk by....i totally spazed...i didnt move i was to afraid to..i
just tryed to yell but only managed to stutter..then i heard it back
further away like to give me more room...well i dont quite know how but
i suddenly relized i was running down the stairs for the livingroom.
i&nbsp; stopped in the living room because something&nbsp; i&nbsp;
could&nbsp; feel but not see got my attention...it scared me...it
felt&nbsp; like it was male..i say male because i suddenly felt like i
wanted to make sure all my clothes were on and covering everthing, i
dont know why i suddenly felt like that but i did, i felt like to was
going to get me...i was afraid to go through the kitchen...i could hear
the card game playing again, the laughing ,talking ect..but i was
afraid of what was in the livingroom....so i took off for the living
room..and as soon as i got to were i could see into the kitchen
everything stopped ..(well the kitchen eneyway) so i ran in the kitchen
and turned on the overhead light..i didnt want to leave the kitchen,
the bright lights in there were very comforting...i was listing to see
if i heard eneything else...and sorta looking but not looking, i didnt
want to see eneything but didnt want to not see something coming at
me...it was a very strange and scary moment..to see or not to see...so
i just stood there...i still felt like the thing in the livingroom
wanted to get me...i think that ill scream for james...but then again
im to scared..stupid huh!<br>
thats when i relized theres no glass on the floor eney longer...i still
have that slight burn you keep for a day or so after you cut you foot
on glass...not a major cut. i dont even care by this point how the
glass got off the floor...i know my family didnt do it, do to the fact
i was by the bedroom doors and i would have seen one of them come
out...so i walk by the hall way by the basement and hit that lite
hoping that i dont see or hear nothing else...i hit the lite in the
basement and debate if im actually going to go down those stairs..i
mean what if something reached up through the steps and touched me or
tripped me...major delimma....i stood there thinking it over..but only
for a secound...the card playing dissapearing act started up again and
i flew down the stairs like a bolt of lightning....i got on the couch
and drew up my feet away from the bottom and leaned forward just in
case something tried to get me from behind...im setting there all
paranoid and i hear james ask me "leslie is that you?"&nbsp; i just
replied what! he asks me "did you hear that?"&nbsp; "who's up?"&nbsp;
he&nbsp; was totally under the covers not looking&nbsp; out. i told him
yes i did hear that and no&nbsp; noone is awake....he said he&nbsp;
heard them playing cards but i kept comeing back down again so he was
confused....he said the last time i went up and didnt come back that we
were playing cards and goofing..he said he sat up and put his feet on
the floor and thats when he relized water was everywhare..he said he
jumped up in a panic...it was almost to his knee's...he said he could
hear water dripping in the bathroom so he waded through the water&nbsp;
and went into the bathroom and said sure enough the shower was dripping
pretty good and the drain in the floor was clogged with towls (it was a
walk in tile shower not a bathtub) so he tried to pull the towls out
but they were stuck..so he imediatly walked to the shower stall and as
soon as he's hand touch the faucet...everything stoped..no dripping ,no
water...(sounded familiar) so he looked were the drain was clogged and
no towls..not even so much as a wet spot eneywhere...he said he thought
he had a weird dream, when he started to walk away thats when he
noticed he's pants were sticking to him....they were wet to about his
kness...he pulled his covers off and dropped his legs down and sure
enough...they were wet...so i said lets go out side and we did and i
told him what had happend up stairs...we didnt go back in the whole
nite....when the sun came up, then we went in...i however didnt go past
the kitchen...no way man...well i felt braver in the day time so i went
for a shower..now the bathroom was in the middle of being
remodeld...the stipped the walls down there was these little thin long
pieces of wood making up the interior of the wall...unfortunitly you
could see through the walls...and there were no locks well no nothing
but a hook latch that would hold the door still....i dont know why, you
could see through&nbsp; the walls......so i demanded james stay outside
the bathroom door and stand gaurd while i bathed...i told him if he saw
eneything to yell and i would be out there in a flash butt naked if i
had to...which i was joking...i thought ghost came out at nite
only...well im bathing and i get done&nbsp; in record time and get out
and relize in my rush to be in and out of the shower to then again rush
to get dressed and rush to get my butt back out side....i forgot to
bring my clothes to the bathroom...there in the basement still....oh
great...so i wrap up in my towl and head for the door...i flipped the
hook over and pushed on the door..it didnt move...i pulled, it still
didnt move...i wasted no time..i freaked out right away...i was
screaming to james the door wont open he's pushing im pulling, then
he's pulling and im pushing to know avail.....tonya comes up because
she could hear me yelling ( of course, so can the whole house)&nbsp;
she tells me to just step away from the door and wait a minute and
he'll stop..she tells me this happens alot, not to worry...i just
replied something along the line of&nbsp; " like hell" and i continue
to kick and hit the door...james tells me to stand back away from the
door...i look at him through the door ( because 2 walls in the bathroom
plus its door you can see through) and i can see he's gonna ram it...so
as i stood back and he got ready to ram the door, it just opens, all
the way. ..i just stood for a moment ...when a thought in my mind
pictured that door slamming shut again. i shot out of there ran in the
basement and got my cloths on and went out the door...me and james
spent the entire day outside on saturday..never went in that
house...they told us why the house was haunted...its actually such a
sad and cruel story that i dont want to repeat it...but i will till you
the house was about 150 years old or more and there was slave houses in
the back and a awful doctor lived in the big house...<br>
we was supposed to stay till sunday nite. james and i in the daytime
were quite brave...so we were going to try and stay another nite...my
aunt informed both of us that it was fun and to try not to be scared
and you couldnt actualy get hurt....<br>
so we went back in the house at nite fall...its the south, truthfully,
the mosqetoes were sucking us dry..well we were back in the living room
and talking and laughing and i was totally faking the im ok thing and
the fire place lit up..i jumped out of my chair as did james and we
tore out of the house...we just left are stuff&nbsp; there...i didnt
want to venture through the house collecting my things and neither did
james.<br>
i never went back to that house..ever!!&nbsp; i am now 30 years
old..and i think about that house often and it still scares me to think
about it ....<br>

It was a hot summer day when &#8220;Fancy&#8221; and &#8220;Pretty&#8221; played in the
trailer. Grandma was attending great grandma and grandpa was out
watering the yard. The two girls played while keeping cool near the air
conditioner. Quietly spending the day wishing they had other kids to
play with when out of the corner of the living room came a little boy
and girl playing jump rope and hop-scotch. The girls thought nothing of
it and accepted their new friends in and began to play. They laughed
and giggled and played. Not long after &#8220;fancy&#8221; and &#8220;pretty&#8221; looked at
each other&#8230; something had changed. The little girl and boy had gone
with out saying good bye. Years later the girls would describe the
experience with wonderment. Who were they? Where did they come from and
how did they walk throw the living room wall?<br>
i could only speculate they must have been earthbound souls looking for some playmates.<br>

The Toys "R" Us in Sunnyvale:<br>
<br>

My husband has told me two stories of how Johnny saved his life when he worked there.<br>
The first was when he was in the rafters hanging signs from up there,
he lost his footing and was about to fall backwards when someone pulled
on his vest and pulled him back into place then put a hand on his
shoulder to steady him but no one was there and it was after closing
time.<br>
The second was when he was in the back storage room and was trying to
push boxes around on top of the shelfs and one of the boxes above him
started to fall and the box was mysteriously caught and then moved out
of harms way but no one was up there or even in the room with him. When
he checked the box my husband saw that it was full of heavy material
that could have crushed him if it would have fallen on him.<br>

The Man Next Door<br>
<br>

When I was about 7 my grandmother passed away in our house of old
age.&nbsp; After that I always felt as if I would bump into someone who
wasn't there, especially right outside my bedroom.&nbsp; I would be
walking at a good pace sometimes and feel as if I've hit a brick wall
that wasn't there.&nbsp; My mother said that my grandmother didn't die
in my room but I know she did.&nbsp; I had to share my brother's room
when she was living with us during her last few weeks.&nbsp; I remember
someone grabbing me by the arm after feeling like I had just bumped
into someone real hard.&nbsp; I was in the basement at the time so I
don't know if it was cold because of a ghost or because of bumping into
a ghost.&nbsp; After that I always beleived in ghosts.<br>
When I was 12 or 13 I came home from baseball practice and was told
that the elderly man next house over had writen a note and blown his
head off with a 12 gauge shotgun.&nbsp; I was told to stay inside while
the police did their report and the coroner finished up.&nbsp; I
remember my father offered to clean up the blood in the basement where
the man killed himself.&nbsp; It was odd that someone would kill
themselves in my neighborhood.&nbsp; We lived in a fairly decent middle
class suburban area.<br>
Ten years later the wife of the man next door died of a stroke.&nbsp;
Later the elderly couple's children sold the house to a nice
family.&nbsp; I came back from college and moved back in with my family
while looking for work.&nbsp; One day the mother of the family next
door asked me who the old man in the house was.&nbsp; I didn't know
what she meant at first so I asked her about the man and she discribed
my old neighbor very clearly, down to his thick black glasses and
powder white hair.&nbsp; She said that her youngest kids see him in the
house all the time.&nbsp; I didn't tell her about the old man blowing
his head off because I didn't want to scare them off.&nbsp; I wouldn't
live there, especially after seeing the old man's ghost.<br>

Scream<br>
<br>
By: ms_lmartinez@juno.com<br>
<br>
July, 2006. It was early morning, the sun had just come up, I was lying
in bed with my 8 months old son, and had to go to the bathroom for my
morning ritual. I was being very careful that my son didn&#8217;t wake. I
have a high bed so I have to step on a stool before setting foot on the
floor. I stood there a while waiting and making sure my son wouldn&#8217;t
stir or wake. After fixing a body pillow next to his tiny body and I
was sure he wouldn&#8217;t miss me or notice I was gone I stepped down. A
shrieking scream suddenly came from underneath my feet! Just then my
son screamed too, and sat right up! I jumped up onto the bed and held
my baby and hide us under the covers.&nbsp; I was too scared to move,
and too scared to reach out and turn the lights on.&nbsp; I soon fell
asleep next to him until noon, and climbed out of bed from foot and not
the side I usually do. <br>
Needless to say there is nothing under my bed, or under my floor. What ever it was scared the hell out of me that morning.<br>

7 year Mystery<br>
<br>

Hello my name is Jessica Aleman. I Am 20 years old and I reside in San
Antonio, Texas with my husband of 2 years; Nestor Aleman. Ever since I
was a little girl I have been abel to communicate with the dead. I have
lived in many places and have been contacted by many spirits,&nbsp; I
even believe that I almost became trapped in an alternate dimention.
You are probably intrigued by this, I will explain. I lived in a place
called Hawarden, Iowa from the time I was 10-13 years of age. In my
time here I had seen many things, strange and amazing things that have
changed the very way I see the world. Well there was this old boat
landing on the Missourri river called Carrs landing that I loved to go
to in Hawarden. There used to be a bridge over the river, but a flood
washed it down and only parts on the concreate remained in the water.
These pieces made it possible for me to sit in the middle of the river
upon them. It was such a beautiful day and I had brought my lunch and a
good book. The rock was large enough for me to lay upon and I had
spread out and began to read. The warm late spring sun and the sound of
the rushing river around me contributed to my dosing off. I woke up to
a start and relized the sun was just hanging over the tree and that I
had very little light to get&nbsp; home by. Well I hoped to shore, and
to get to my bike there was about 10-15 feet of trees and foilage that
I had to get though. I had been through so many times that I had worn
somewhat of a path and travel through the foilage was fairly easy. I
felt very strange, dizzy almost. I shruged off the feeling, believing
it was caused by the fact I had just woken. I had noticed that I was
takeing much, Much too long to get to the end of the small shock of
trees along the shoreline. I could see the end, but it was almost as if
I was makeing no progress tword it. I felt a wave of fear and doom
crash into me with such a palpable force that I almost fell. There wa a
sound behind me, subtle at first then frantic, like running. I didn't
dare look back as I took to my feet and ran. I ran faster than I
believed humanly possible, The sound still followed. Trees and lights
flashed past me, I was begining to think that I was runing in place,
and the tempatation to look back beat down upon me like I was a nail
and it we're a hammer. I broke through finally. The sun was well up and
there was a group of people standing around my bike including my
parents. I didn't know what happened. The police of course just
dissmissed it, saying that I had gotten lost. But I had been coming
here for years now, I knew it like the palm of my hand. Please if you
have any idea of what happened that night, it is a mystery I have been
trying to solve for 7 years now. I have many more, Many more
experiences. If you would like to hear of them please let me know.<br>

Asylum<br>
<br>

<br>
we went to fairfield hills asylum in newtown ct. we believe we saw a
face in the window of what we think is the auditorium. his head
followed are movement as we walked away from building. we then looked
at the glass doors to a little boy standing in the doorway starring at
us and his body following our movement. his face was white with black
eyes and a black mouth. it looked like he had a dark shirt on with
white writing. as was took off running we turned to take one last look
at the building to see if our eyes were playing tricks on us. as we
looked we saw the boy in another window. the boy moved to different
windows as we ran. when we where walking to my car we could feel
someone following us. as we got in the car we felt extremely hot and
could not cool down with the AC. blasting and the temp being 65
degrees.&nbsp; as i got my self set in my car i had the door open and
one leg out the car door. i felt someone or something grab my leg and
pull. i struggled to get my leg in the car. as we took off in my car,
we still could not cool down and then we got extremely cold and could
not get warm until we turned out of the asylum area. <br>
we went to the easton cemetery to see the white lady. as we looked in
to the cemetery we saw a white figure walking toward my car. as we took
pictures it seemed she was getting closer. as we took one last picture
and the flash went off her face was at my window starring at me and the
person next to me. she then went away and we did not see her for the
rest of the night.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

Alligator Alley Spirit-<br>
<br>

On September 23, 2006 at 7:30 P.M. I was driving west on&nbsp;&nbsp;
I-75 from Ft. Lauderdale to Naples returning from visiting family. At
this time the sun had just gone down, the weather was fair with just a
few clouds in the sky. As I was passing mile marker #95 (or somewhere
near to it, i didn't pay attention to the location until after the
incedent) I saw what at first to be appeared to be a small area of mist
(about 4 feet hight and about 1 foot wide) floating about 20 feet above
the median, as I approached this object it sudenly became clear that
this object was not just shapless mass but it was the figure of a human
being. As I got closer I saw that it was the figure of a woman in a
dress with no legs. I was unable to make out any more details as I had
to return my attention to the road in front of me, but I am quite sure
that what I did see was in fact not natural. I have logged thousands of
miles and hundreds of hours driving on Alligator Alley at all times and
weather conditions, in fact my job as a test driver requires me to
drive up and down this stretch of roadway up to 4 times a day, and with
all this time spent on this roadway I can safely say I have never seen
anything like what I saw that night. I have no idea what the origins of
this spirit may be but I do know that many drivers have lost their
lives on this stretch of highway and I would not be the least bit
surprised if a few of these poor souls still remain around this
roadway. By the way I don't drink, do drugs, or drive tired.<br>
