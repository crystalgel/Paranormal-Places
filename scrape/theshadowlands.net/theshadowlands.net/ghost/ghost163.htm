<b>Paralyzed</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: BigBaller18@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I was trying to sleep and I could feel something watching me.&nbsp;
I kept on</b>
<br><b>getting out of bed and looking around my room, trying to find what
was</b>
<br><b>watching me.&nbsp; What ever was in my room terrifying me to death.&nbsp;
After a while</b>
<br><b>I felt silly and decided that I should just go to bed, even though
I was</b>
<br><b>scared.&nbsp; As soon as I shut my eyes I felt paralyzed, I good
not move nor</b>
<br><b>scream.&nbsp; Then a white figure came from my closet and stood
next to my bed.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>kept on trying to yell and run away but I was stuck in my bed silently.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>could tell the ghost was trying to tell me something but I was too
scared to</b>
<br><b>listen.&nbsp; It stayed at my bedside for a couple of minutes and
then left.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>later had similar experiences.</b>

<p><b>Several Spirit Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cdbell06@email.msn.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Greetings Dave, I am so glad that a family member introduced me to
your website.&nbsp; I have been intrigued by ghosts and hauntings since
I was 7 years old.&nbsp; I was always the child who loved horror movies,
ordered "scary books" and who loved the mysticism of Halloween.&nbsp; It
is so nice to know that there is someone out there who believes.&nbsp;
I have had a sixth sense and several experiences with spirits for quite
some time now.&nbsp; In fact, I can share a couple of accounts with you
now.&nbsp; Although the stories may not make one's hair stand on end, they
were enough to convince me that something weird was going on at the time.It
was 1995, and as a grad student and resident assistant, I decided it was
more convenient to spend my spring break in the dorms.&nbsp; While I was
getting ready to go out with a friend of mine, someone called to tell me
that the electricity would be turned off completely in the dorms at 2 am.&nbsp;
I thought nothing of it, and when I returned at 1:30 am, I followed the
normal routine- I got undressed and watched TV.&nbsp; I was tired, and
I must have fallen asleep, because I felt something literally jar me out
of my peaceful slumber.&nbsp; I immediately opened my eyes, and saw nothing
but darkness.&nbsp; I got out of bed, opened my door and walked out into
the main hallway.&nbsp; There was nothing there.&nbsp; I could see the
dim light that the emergency lights emitted.&nbsp; At this point, I was
so terrified, that I ran back into my room and locked my door.&nbsp; Whatever
had jarred me awake was not friendly, because I felt this terribly evil
presence surrounding me.&nbsp; I was completely terrified.&nbsp; So much
so, that I could not go back to sleep.&nbsp; All I could do was curl up
in a ball and lean on the wall behind me.&nbsp; I have no idea what the
heck had come to visit me that night, but when I called my mom and aunt
the next day and told them what had happened, they mentioned to me that
they had had similar experiences.&nbsp; All they could say was that there
was some evil entity that felt it needed to make its presence known to
me.&nbsp; I know that this does not sound scary, but I cannot even find
the words to describe the eerieness of this account.&nbsp; Rumor has it
that two girls had died in the dorm 20 years ago, and that they had lived
in a vacant 3rd floor room.&nbsp; No matter how many times residents were
placed in that room, no one could ever stay there for a long period of
time.&nbsp; Perhaps it had something to do with them- who knows.&nbsp;
To this day, I have no idea.&nbsp; All I know is that I hope to never experience
that type of visit again.&nbsp; I have more stories to share, but have
to sign off for now.&nbsp; The next stories I share will be about people
I know and some who I don't know who have come to tell me things in my
dreams after they have died.&nbsp; Stay tuned!!!!!</b>

<p><b>A Gift</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: artemismoon_1@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I read your article on ESP and(although not totally agreeing with
it)decided to send you a story of mine. Keep in mind that this story is
true and the events I describe in it did happen to me. It was a Friday
night and I was alone in my room around 1 AM.I was watching tv when all
of a sudden I saw my friend.(He was on a trip over hundreds of miles away.)
He was at a concert jumping up and down yelling and screaming.Then I saw
a young girl with long brown hair with a hood covering most of it look
over and smile athim.Then immediatly after seeing that I saw them in a
hotel room together with alot of other people drinking and smoking and
dancing.Then just as quickly as it had come the image faded.Two days later
my friend reterned. I was on the phone with his sister when he was telling
her what he had done.(By this time I had nearly forgotten my stange experiance)She
then jokingly asked (in a much ruder manner than what I am about to put)who
he had made out with.He laughed and said some girl in a black hood with
brown hair.Then he stated how she had smiled at him first getting his attention.I
nearly dropped the phone.These types of things happen to me very often...well
actually they happen several times a day.Each little preminition or vision
coming true within a short amount of time.In my opinion it is a gift.And
I for one welcome it.I don't call myself a phsycic though.I just use them
to my advantage.And I am very happy to be chosen to have</b>
<br><b>this gift from God.Well thank you so much for you time.If you would
like to contact me you can reach me at artemismoon_1@yahoo.com.</b>

<br><b>Black Foreboding Figure</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: nintend65@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I believe my house is haunted. When I am home alone doors open and
close,</b>
<br><b>and I hear conversations going on sometimes when I am home alone.
Sometimes</b>
<br><b>we hear a loud bang at my house and when we go to the room that
the loud</b>
<br><b>bang was at a few things had been thrown on the floor. I have seen
three</b>
<br><b>apparitions at my house also. One of them is just white mist, one
is a</b>
<br><b>hooded black figure, the other looks like my late grandmoher. The
one who</b>
<br><b>look like my late grandmother sounds like my late grandmother when
she was</b>
<br><b>alive and the white mist sounds like a man I have heard before.
I've seen</b>
<br><b>the apparition of my late grandma just yesterday out of the corner
of my eye</b>
<br><b>when I was going to sleep. Sometimes I've heard her say goodnight
to me. The</b>
<br><b>black figure always appears before something bad happens but he
hasn't</b>
<br><b>appeared for at least one year though. I think the white mist is
my mom's</b>
<br><b>dad even though he died a few months before I was born. Also at
my house</b>
<br><b>sometimes the lights turn on&nbsp; and off. Anyway your sight is
the best sight</b>
<br><b>about the paranormal on the net.</b>

<p><b>George the man of the house</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dmbcw@telus.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Kerene and I live in a small town on Vancouver Island
,</b>
<br><b>British Columbia , Canada. It is about 3 hours drive from Victoria
B.C.</b>
<br><b>You may have heard that Victoria is the ghost capital of B.C. This
story</b>
<br><b>is recent. My mother-in-law, Jan and my brother-in-law , Brett were
the</b>
<br><b>main people affected by this haunting. In 1992 Jan , Brett , My
husband</b>
<br><b>Shaun , And a friend of the family Ian moved in to a house in Victoria.</b>
<br><b>The realtor who found the house for them said a man named George
built</b>
<br><b>the house in the early 30's. They said he owned the house until
1989.</b>
<br><b>The family sold the house when he passed away. They said he had
built it</b>
<br><b>himself. It was a lovely house. It had two bedrooms up and one down.
A</b>
<br><b>beautiful garden in the back with a fish pond and tons of roses.
Jan</b>
<br><b>loved it imediately. Ian and jan shared the room upstairs near the
front</b>
<br><b>of the house. Brett and Shaun shared the room down stairs near the
back</b>
<br><b>of the house on the opposite side from Jan and Ian. Jan and Ian
used the</b>
<br><b>room upatairs at the back of the house as a work space because of
the</b>
<br><b>beautiful garden view.</b>
<br><b>One day jan and Ian were discussing something and started to argue
while</b>
<br><b>sitting in the room overlooking the garden. they were both sitting
on</b>
<br><b>the couch looking towards each other. After ian saying something
rather</b>
<br><b>mean to Jan , Jan saw a ball of light like static on a TV fly across
the</b>
<br><b>room and behind Ian, pushing Ian's head forward. Ian then acused
Jan of</b>
<br><b>hitting him. Jan said she didn't touch him. She told him what she
saw</b>
<br><b>but he didn't believe her.</b>
<br><b>Another time jan was alone in the house doing laundry. She went</b>
<br><b>downstairs to check if it was time to put in the fabric softener.
She</b>
<br><b>noticed the&nbsp; washer lid was open and the washer was stoped
at the rinse</b>
<br><b>cycle. She tought she must have forgoted to close the lid. She went</b>
<br><b>upstairs to the living room and found the VCR time flashing. She
reset</b>
<br><b>the time and went to check the bedroom clock. It was fine. She went</b>
<br><b>downstairs again in a while to see if the wash was finished. The
machine</b>
<br><b>was open and this time unplugged. Jan went upstairs again to check
the</b>
<br><b>clock on the vcr to see if Brett could be home from work yet and
playing</b>
<br><b>a prank. The Vcr was blinking again. She went into the bedroom to
check</b>
<br><b>that clock, it was blinking. She went downstairs fixed the washer,
went</b>
<br><b>upstairs to find the clock in the bedroom unplugged and the VCr</b>
<br><b>unplugged. When brett got home she accused Brett of pulling a prank.
He</b>
<br><b>claims he did not. Jan told Brett about the incident with Ian in
the</b>
<br><b>room overlooking the garden, and Brett told Jan about how at night
he</b>
<br><b>hears a man's voice while in this room. He thought it had to be
Ian's</b>
<br><b>voice but now he doesn't think it was.</b>
<br><b>Soon after that everyone noticed the men in the house becoming</b>
<br><b>increasingly hostile towards&nbsp; each other. Jan was only affected</b>
<br><b>residualy as she loved all three men in the house and wanted them
to get</b>
<br><b>along. All three started to become violent. They had never been
violent</b>
<br><b>people before. Ian finally left the home. ian did not believe in
ghosts</b>
<br><b>or such stuff. He believed it was caused by the stress of trying
to find</b>
<br><b>work.</b>
<br><b>Soon after everyone that entered the house noticed that the room</b>
<br><b>overlooking the garden was always cold and no one liked going in
there</b>
<br><b>except jan. Jan sarted to leave the door closed when guests came
over</b>
<br><b>because no one liked the room and if you had to use the washroom
you had</b>
<br><b>to walk passed it.</b>
<br><b>Jan and brett also started experiencing car problems. The radio
would</b>
<br><b>change stations on its own , headlights would go off and on, and
wipers</b>
<br><b>shut off when Brett would get in the car with Jan.</b>
<br><b>Jan felt someone get in bed with her on a number of occations to
find</b>
<br><b>there was no one there. One night she woke up again with the definate</b>
<br><b>feeling someone was curled up against her. He stood up&nbsp; , pointed
to the</b>
<br><b>door and said " Get out George , go to your room!" She immediatly
felt</b>
<br><b>the absence of the pressence. She did not have any inclination that
this</b>
<br><b>was caused by a "person" let alone George. She said it just came
to her.</b>
<br><b>as long as they kept the door closed to the room overlooking the
garden</b>
<br><b>as was fine. Sometimes George would get curious and open the door
a</b>
<br><b>little. We would just say " get in your room george!" and the door
would</b>
<br><b>close again.</b>
<br><b>Jan soon asked the realtor for extra information.( until now Jan
wasn't</b>
<br><b>willing to believe in ghosts) With a little digging they found that</b>
<br><b>George built the house for his wife Janet ( Jan's real name is Janet).</b>
<br><b>Janet and George cared for the garden. Janet had her sewing room</b>
<br><b>overlooking the garden. She spent alot of time there. When Janet
got</b>
<br><b>terminally ill ,Janet stayed in the bedroom upstairs while George
slept</b>
<br><b>in the sewing room on a cot. George and Janet had a daughter who
helped</b>
<br><b>care for her and she slept on a cot in Janet's bedroom. When the</b>
<br><b>daughter couldn't be there George would curl up next to Janet. He
wanted</b>
<br><b>her to never be alone. She passed in 1988. He visited her grave
every</b>
<br><b>day until his death in 1989. Our family believes that george was
drawn</b>
<br><b>to Jan and she to him. He was jelous of the love she received form
the</b>
<br><b>men in the house and made them act strangly. He played pranks on
Jan to</b>
<br><b>let her know he was there. He was angered by anyone miss treating
Jan</b>
<br><b>and Ian was "smacked" by him. He curled up in bed with her so she</b>
<br><b>wouldn't be alone.Jan felt comfortable in the sewing room when no
one</b>
<br><b>else did because George wanted it to be her room. after they moved
out</b>
<br><b>The men went back to normal except for my husband. He is easily</b>
<br><b>frightrned of scary movies and now suffers form a form of depression.</b>
<br><b>Jan also suffers from a form of depression since leaving that house.</b>
<br><b>Brett feels more aware of the paranormal now and believes that house</b>
<br><b>screwed up his brother ( who won't discuss anything about it) and
his</b>
<br><b>mother.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Increased Activity in Experiences</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: clorox2@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>For years I have had experiences with the supernatural.&nbsp; And
just recently</b>
<br><b>(ever since I took a job at a local cemetary) I have been feeling
very oddly</b>
<br><b>and seeing things now with increased frequency.&nbsp; I wish now
to tell you of</b>
<br><b>the first experience i had with the supernatural because it confuses
me.</b>
<br><b>I was about 3-4 years old and sleeping in my parents room while
my father</b>
<br><b>was away working in another state.&nbsp; I awoke to the sounds of
loud speaking</b>
<br><b>in the room and i didn't recognize any of the voices.&nbsp; I tried
to wake my</b>
<br><b>mother but she seemed to be in a deep sleep and i was unable to
bring her</b>
<br><b>around.&nbsp; So I had no choice but to sit and listen alone.&nbsp;
There were three</b>
<br><b>seperate voices.&nbsp; Two of them belonged to men and one was a
woman.&nbsp; The two</b>
<br><b>men seemed to be hiding from the woman for some reason in what i
could</b>
<br><b>gather from the sounds surrounding them was a junk yard of some
kind.&nbsp; At</b>
<br><b>first it was only the voices of the men and they were talking about
the</b>
<br><b>woman for a few moments but then i heard the sound of steps on gravel</b>
<br><b>getting closer and closer and the male voices quieted each other.&nbsp;
Then</b>
<br><b>there was silence for a few moments but it was broken by the sound
of a foot</b>
<br><b>kicking the side of a car.</b>
<br><b>This woman was VERY angry and yelling at the men.&nbsp; They explained
that they</b>
<br><b>were only hiding and trying to explain themselves.&nbsp; This continued
for a few</b>
<br><b>moments and then just as quickly as it had come it was gone.&nbsp;
I heard this</b>
<br><b>same conversation and series of events several times during my childhood.</b>
<br><b>But never in any room but my parents bedroom.&nbsp; Only recently
have i</b>
<br><b>confessed to my mother that i heard the voices and i asked if anything
had</b>
<br><b>ever happened in that room or the property and she said that there
had never</b>
<br><b>been anything even resembling a junk yard on the property and my
father</b>
<br><b>built the house so we were the only people to ever live there.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>wondering if perhaps you could tell me what you believe these voices
were</b>
<br><b>and why they seemed to be centralized in that room.</b>
<br><b>Also I believe that any spirit in the house may have been localized
around</b>
<br><b>me as none of my other siblings ever experienced (that they have
spoke of</b>
<br><b>anyways) anything unusual but i remember very clearly another instance
when</b>
<br><b>i opened the door to my room one of my toys (a stuffed bear) was
upright and</b>
<br><b>walking on two legs towards the door but after a few seconds of
opening the</b>
<br><b>door it again dropped to the floor.</b>
<br><b>I grew up around hauntings so i was never really uncomfortable around
the</b>
<br><b>events i have experienced as my grandfather's house is also haunted
with a</b>
<br><b>spirit that is very active in non threating ways.&nbsp; I was just
curious as to</b>
<br><b>why the voices i heard were only in that room and i only i heard
them and</b>
<br><b>perhaps why a spirit would centralized itself on me.&nbsp; Thank
you for taking</b>
<br><b>the time to read this email and i hope to hear from you soon with
any</b>
<br><b>answers you might be able to provide.&nbsp; Thank you also for building
such a</b>
<br><b>wonderful sight so that those of us who do believe and have experienced
the</b>
<br><b>supernatural have a place to tell our stories.</b>

<p><b>Footprints</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tammy@verinet.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>First of all, I have something that I think is very important regarding
children. When I was a child, I had some "bizarre" experiences when I would
try to fall asleep at night. My parents told me these things were just
my imagination. I was at the point where I believed them, and begged them
to take me to a psychiatrist. In other words, sometimes we must believe
what children say. It can be more comforting to tell them they are seeing
ghosts than tell them they are crazy.I use to have my dad sing me to sleep
(bless his heart) even when I was in my teens because I was so frightened
of my room and the things there that would take place. In fact, the things
I can remember are not so bad, but I have a feeling there were some things
that happened that were so devastating, that I blanked them out. Whenever
I think of going to bed during a part of my childhood, I get sweaty and
my heart races.Thanks for letting me get the things I can remember off
my chest!!</b>
<br><b>Once, when I was about 9 ( I am 35 now), I was listening to a 45
record of Donny and Marie in my bedroom. I had the hair brush out (microphone)
and was singing my heart out. The music stopped and I heard a sniffing
sound. I looked down at my bed, which was a canopy with ruffles at the
bottom, and saw the ruffles bellow out with the sniffing sounds. At the
time we had a poodle, Mitzi, who hated me, and I knew she couldn't possibly
be in MY room. But just to make sure, I left my room and went into the
living room where my dad was, with Mitzi right beside him. My dad panicked
because he said I was pale and out of breath from what I had seen. He checked
my room out, but nothing was found. I heard my dad tell my mom later (when
they thought I was out of hearing range) that he believed there was something
to my "stories". About a month later, I was asleep and woke up to a woman
sitting next to my bed with a blanket in her lap. She was very old. I said
to her, "Mom?". Because I was very confused. I yelled "mom" until my mom
entered my bedroom and the lady disappeared. 1) I have the most bizarre
dreams, but I can tell the difference between dreaming and when you think
you are awake. I was</b>
<br><b>definitely awake. 2) My Aunt had passed away about a week before
this, and I believe it was my aunt.I didn't know her too well, but she
didn't have any children herself, and actually tried to kidnap my sister
once.The last thing I remember was when I was about 14. (This is actually
quite funny!). We moved to a new house. It was just my parents and I. My
dad had just finished painting my new bedroom. We closed the bedroom door
for a couple of days to keep the paint fumes minimal.I was told that under
no circumstances was I to go in there. And above all else, when I was allowed
to go back in I was NOT to put my dirty bare feet on the wall. In the past
I had ran around bare-foot alot and sometimes I would lay on my bed with
my feet on the wall, only to leave brown foot prints there. At this point
(un-like other times) of my life , I listened to what my parents told me.
Two days later, after having my bedroom totally off limits, we opened the
door.</b>
<br><b>There, at the head of my bed, on the wall, were black foot prints!!!
The black stuff was smeared all over the wall! Keep in mind, it was black,
not brown like dirt. I didn't even get in trouble. My parents knew me too
well to think I would go that far! In case you are curious, the stuff came
off easily. My parents didn't yell at me, but I stuck up for myself anyway.
"I didn't do it! I didn't do it!" They never said anything except " We
believe you."And I REALLY didn't do it!</b>

<p><b>Old Court House Inn</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; bobandnadine@cs.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This is the name of a restaurant.&nbsp; It's a 2 story cream city
brick building with the restaurant on the first floor and living quarters
upstairs.&nbsp; While knowing a woman who lived next door to this place,
she would always come to work telling us of the</b>
<br><b>"ghost" that lives next door.&nbsp; At the time the building was
vacant and up for sale.&nbsp; Her driveway and bedroom window were on the
side of this restaurant where you could see suspicious movement in one
of the upstair windows.&nbsp; There were curtains on</b>
<br><b>the window and she would tell us how sometimes one curtain would
be open, while other times they would both be open or both be closed.&nbsp;
There were times that one side of the curtain would be "drawn" to the side
from the middle like someone, or something, was holding it open.&nbsp;
One other time there was a candle burning in that window.&nbsp; I was always
one to not believe unless I could see it for myself.&nbsp; I went out there
one night and parked my car facing the "window" for about a half an hour.&nbsp;
I saw nothing.&nbsp; I parked in a different spot to get a view of the
upstairs because none of the other windows</b>
<br><b>had coverings and you could see through the building with the street
lights shining through the other side.&nbsp; While out there I thought
maybe teenagers or vagrants had entered using the vacancy as shelter.&nbsp;
Being that it was winter and the last snowfall we had was approximately
2 weeks prior, I looked for footprints to and from all the entrances to
the building.&nbsp; There were none.&nbsp; I later moved my car to my original
location and watched just as the curtain on the upper level was drawn open
as if someone was looking out.&nbsp; I finally believed that there was
someone or somthing up there and the stories were true.&nbsp; After talking
to certain area people I was informed that the place had a history of being
haunted.&nbsp; It was for sale because the woman, previous owner, lost
her son to suicide in that apartment upstairs.&nbsp; But according to people
who are familiar with this story, it was allegedly haunted before the suicide.&nbsp;
True or not True?&nbsp; I believe what I saw and have no logical explanation
for it except that a curios ghost lives there.</b>

<p><b>Safety Town</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:ice7711@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>A few years back, I worked with young children to teach them safety.
It was</b>
<br><b>a program called Safety Town, and trips to the fire house and municipal</b>
<br><b>building were always scheduled. So we went to the municipal building
and</b>
<br><b>were in a small courtroom with other workers and the children. The
lights</b>
<br><b>were turned off so that the chilren could watch a movie. I was sitting
on</b>
<br><b>the floor in the front row with a few of my friends when we all
saw whiteish</b>
<br><b>ghosts sitting in the chairs around the table. There were four of
us that</b>
<br><b>noticed them but I don't think anyone else did because they were
busy</b>
<br><b>watching the movie. This was the only time I ever saw ghosts but
two of the</b>
<br><b>others had seen quite a few of them.</b>

<p><b>Saved by a Crashing Flouresent Light</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: clschultz@tc3net.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>The house that I grew up in, I believe strongly was shared with spirits
of some kind. I heard a lot of differnt noises such as, doors creeking
and foot steps. My parents always told me it's an old house with drafts.
Which could explain the creeking</b>
<br><b>doors, but what about the foot steps I heard? I always saw some
kind of floating almost transparent fog. It didn't hold a particular shape
and never stayed for long. I became very confortable with these spirits.
Sometimes I sensed that they were there watching me, but I didn't always
see them. I didn't fear them, I actually felt very secure and safe. There
was only one room that I couldn't bare to be in. Ofcourse that was my bedroom.
Even my dog wouldn't go in that room. I spent many nights in my parents
room untill they gave me a differnt room to sleep in. Anyhow, the main
thing I wanted to share, I can not</b>
<br><b>explain "logically" but I am glad that it happened. I was about
eight or nine years old and I was sitting in the kitchen watching my Mom
cook. I sat at the bar underneath a flouresent light. I was resting my
chin on my hand. I didn't hear a noise, nor did I sense anything, but for
some reason I looked up at the light and then brought my head back down.
The next thing I knew I was lifted and flying backwards across the room.
I landed on my feet on the other side of the kitchen table. It was about
six feet from where I was to where I landed. As I went backwards I watched
the light come crashing down. I didn't feel anything grab me. I do know
that there is no way I jumped. I didn't know that the light was going to
fall. I've wondered for years if something saved me from the fallen light
or did I sense it was going to happen before it did. Either way doesn't
sound logical to me at all. If I would have atleast heard a noise from
the light I could use the adrinline reasonI'm not sure why I looked at
the light. Maybe a spirit was looking through my eyes. (Just a thought)
Anyhow thats my story of the house I grew up in. My Dad still owns the
house, but he rents it out. I know this sounds strange but when it's empty
with no tenants I go and visit the house hopeing that something will answer
my questions, but I am just a little too scared to ask, because I don't
want to contact the wrong spirit.</b>

<p><b>Tapped Shoulder</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: rrussell49@home.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>i live in ontario, canada.&nbsp; in december of 1998 my husband and
i purchased a bungalow.&nbsp; one night we had an argument and i went to
the basement to do some laundry, and to be by myself for a while.&nbsp;
i put the laundry in the machine and was reading a book-not a scary one
either- when i heard my husband come walking down the stairs.&nbsp; the
wood of the stairs makes a particular squeak, so i was sure he was coming
down as he was the only other person home.&nbsp; i guess i wasn't entirely
startled when i felt him tap my left shoulder, but i sure was when i turned
and no one was there.&nbsp; i had been angry with him</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;and that is why i paid no attention when i heard him come
down the stairs.&nbsp; so i calmly (really) went upstairs and told my actual
husband what had just happened.&nbsp; nothing else notable has happened
before or since.&nbsp; whoever it was that tapped my shoulder that night,
i believe is gone now.&nbsp; i say that because i am no longer uneasy at
home alone at night.&nbsp; maybe i have just gotten used to it, though
i doubt it because i never ever want to see a spirit.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Arthur's&nbsp; Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: abruso@jcrew.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I would like to relate some of the experiences my family and myself
have had</b>
<br><b>with regards to the spirit world.</b>
<br><b>I was born in Albany, NY. I grew-up in a house at 56 Elm Street
which (in</b>
<br><b>fact the whole neighborhood) was built in 1858. My great-grandmother
bought</b>
<br><b>the house in 1918. She was an Italian immigrant who had mystical</b>
<br><b>experiences. Previous to moving to Elm Street, she had lived on
Western</b>
<br><b>Avenue. At the Western Avenue house, she had a visitation of the
Blessed</b>
<br><b>Mother (Maria d’Jersulemme) as an answer to a prayer to cure her
daughter</b>
<br><b>(my grandmother) who was congenitally crippled. Mary gave my great</b>
<br><b>grandmother instructions to follow, which resulted in my grandmother
being</b>
<br><b>able to walk. For four generations we have lit candles to Mary as
thanks for</b>
<br><b>this gift. (I can tell you details about this if you are interested.)</b>
<br><b>My family has had a lot of paranormal experiences, especially my
sister Sue</b>
<br><b>who can read palms and minds; as well as myself.</b>
<br><b>My first experience was after college. I had just graduated and
was</b>
<br><b>separated from my partner who had moved to Philadelphia. The mail
I was</b>
<br><b>sending to the address he had given me was being returned and I
had no phone</b>
<br><b>number. I was frantic to find out what was happening to him. I agreed
to</b>
<br><b>spend the night with a friend this July. While I was there, ( it
was in</b>
<br><b>Albany, but I no longer remember the street) I awoke at about 3:00am
to a</b>
<br><b>bright light emanating from the foot of the bed. It was brilliant,
but did</b>
<br><b>not hurt the eyes. It was female, but without any overtly female</b>
<br><b>characteristics. I knew at once that I was facing Mary, the mother
of Jesus.</b>
<br><b>I tried to speak and found that I could not. I wanted to ask, What
do you</b>
<br><b>want? Immediately as I thought of the question, I received the answer
very</b>
<br><b>calmly, Everything will be all right. I struggled vainly to ask
another</b>
<br><b>question, What do you mean? because I was confused with this message.</b>
<br><b>Again I was answered, Everything will be all right. At that point
my</b>
<br><b>friend came to me and asked if I was all right, because I seemed
to be</b>
<br><b>mumbling. I turned my head to him and clearly and effortlessly,
said, I’m</b>
<br><b>OK. And then turned back to the foot of the bed to find the bright
woman</b>
<br><b>gone.</b>
<br><b>My father died a few years after I graduated college. He had&nbsp;
a heart attack</b>
<br><b>while bowling. A month after his death, my sister Sue was walking
down the</b>
<br><b>stairs of the Elm Street house. Halfway down, she froze and watched
our</b>
<br><b>father come through the front door, up the stairs, pass through
my sister</b>
<br><b>and on through the door on the second landing. As he passed through
my</b>
<br><b>sister, he said, I’m home.</b>
<br><b>I moved to Philadelphia and was living at 5922 Master Street in
a house</b>
<br><b>which was built in 1900. It was about six years after my Visitation.
My</b>
<br><b>partner had been murdered in November the day before Thanksgiving
, I was in</b>
<br><b>a state of deep depression and my life was disintegrating around
me. My</b>
<br><b>partner was dead, I had lost my job, I couldn’t keep up the house
I was at</b>
<br><b>the lowest point of my life, everything was going wrong. It was
now the end</b>
<br><b>of February or the beginning of March. I was lying in bed as the
day was</b>
<br><b>breaking. It was turning out to be a grey day and I was thinking
about what</b>
<br><b>I was going to do. I began to notice a breeze coming from the window,
and I</b>
<br><b>thought how drafty the window was. Then I realized that the window
was shut,</b>
<br><b>and the breeze was getting stronger. Suddenly, I felt my partner’s
presence</b>
<br><b>come through the closed window, pass over me and into the room.
As he passed</b>
<br><b>over me, he kissed me on the cheek. The kiss had a burning sensation,
which</b>
<br><b>lasted the whole day. After his arrival, I would see him sitting
in the</b>
<br><b>bedroom chair as I passed the room. I would hear footsteps in the
hall while</b>
<br><b>I was downstairs or I would hear the steps creak as if someone were
walking</b>
<br><b>up them. One night, I was lying in bed in the dark, by myself. I
felt the</b>
<br><b>bed sag under the weight of someone sitting on it. My back was to
the</b>
<br><b>sitter, who then leaned his back against the back of my legs. I
froze in</b>
<br><b>fear, because I knew I was alone in the house. On another night,
I saw a</b>
<br><b>dark figure crawl across the floor of my bedroom and under the bed.
And</b>
<br><b>another time, I watched my partner’s ghost climb up the stairs,
as I looked</b>
<br><b>over the banister from the top floor. I had been drawn to look by
the</b>
<br><b>creaking stairs. Eventually, I began to think that I was going insane.
I</b>
<br><b>finally broke down one day after seeing my partner in the bedroom
chair and</b>
<br><b>screamed out, What do you want from me! I did not see him after
that, but</b>
<br><b>I did feel him around. It made me sad that I drove him away.</b>
<br><b>During this low point in my life, I began to question a lot of things</b>
<br><b>including the message of my visitation, Everything will be all right.</b>
<br><b>Everything was far from all right. I went to Elm Street in Albany
to visit</b>
<br><b>my family for Christmas that year. On Christmas Eve, I was restless
and was</b>
<br><b>wide awake at 3:00 am or so, thinking about the bad turn my life
was taking.</b>
<br><b>Very slowly, beginning with then ceiling, then extending down, the
walls of</b>
<br><b>the room began to grow soft and cloudy until the whole solid structure
of</b>
<br><b>the bedroom became like a mist. Then a figure, slowly began to descend
from</b>
<br><b>above, until he (I got the distinct impression that this figure
was male)</b>
<br><b>lay on top of me and covered me with his body, positioning himself
so that</b>
<br><b>he covered me completely and placed his mouth against my ear. It
was the</b>
<br><b>most secure and safe, feeling that I have ever experienced. He then</b>
<br><b>proceeded to explain to me what was happening to me, why it was
happening</b>
<br><b>and what my future would be. He talked for about twenty minutes
or so and</b>
<br><b>then the whole process reversed itself, first with the man lifting
off of me</b>
<br><b>and drifting up and then the room solidifying again. The reverse
process was</b>
<br><b>quicker.</b>
<br><b>The Christmas prior to my angel experience (as I call it), my sister
Sue was</b>
<br><b>living in the same apartment. (56 Elm Street is a row house with
four</b>
<br><b>floors, three upper floor and a basement level, each floor having
been</b>
<br><b>converted into an apartment. The top floor is where my angel experience
took</b>
<br><b>place. My sister Sue had lived there, and then moved into the middle
floor.)</b>
<br><b>Christmas Eve is when my family traditionally gathers to celebrate
the</b>
<br><b>holiday. We put the children to bed for their Christmas morning
experience,</b>
<br><b>then the adults celebrate. My sister Sue had put her son Miguel
to bed.</b>
<br><b>Miguel was about three or four at this time. Sue came downstairs
to the</b>
<br><b>first floor to join the family festivities. At this time in her
life, Sue</b>
<br><b>had gone through an unpleasant divorce, with a vindictive custody
battle.</b>
<br><b>Her finances were a mess and her dating life non-existent. She was
lonely</b>
<br><b>and desperate. After some merry-making, Sue left the party and went
upstairs</b>
<br><b>to her apartment to check on her son. A few minutes later she was
back at</b>
<br><b>the party white-faced and shaking. We all wanted to know what was
wrong; was</b>
<br><b>Miguel sick we all guessed? She told us that Miguel was awake when
she went</b>
<br><b>upstairs to check. He told her, Gramma can to visit me, she said
to tell</b>
<br><b>you that everything will be all right.</b>
<br><b>Sue asked him, What gramma, Gramma is downstairs, she hasn't come</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;upstairs?</b>
<br><b>Not that gramma, this one is older, he said. Gramma Aurilio is at
her</b>
<br><b>house. What are you talking about?,&nbsp; Sue was getting impatient.</b>
<br><b>Gramma, Miguel insisted now and was becoming exasperated. She said
not to</b>
<br><b>worry, that everything will be all right. She’s older than Gramma
Aurilio.</b>
<br><b>Sue understood now, she replied,&nbsp; the only gramma that is older
than Gramma</b>
<br><b>Aurilio, is Nonni and she died twenty years before you were born!"</b>
<br><b>"That's who came to visit!," Miguel said now excited, "She said
everything</b>
<br><b>is going to be all right!"</b>
<br><b>My sister was shaken by this incident, "I have a weird son.," she
would say</b>
<br><b>when she repeated this story.</b>
<br><b>Later that year, my sister Sue had an incident that changed her
life. Late</b>
<br><b>one night, she was using the Ouija board to divine her future. She
had</b>
<br><b>gotten into the habit of doing this frequently. She had also taken
up the</b>
<br><b>tarot and palm reading. The tarot she was only fair at but palm
reading came</b>
<br><b>to her intuitively and with instant understanding. This night she
was using</b>
<br><b>the Ouija board, when she began to feel cold. She put it away and
went to</b>
<br><b>bed. Once in bed she felt something climb in the bed with her and
pin her</b>
<br><b>down to the mattress. It put its whole weight on her and held her
hands out</b>
<br><b>over her head. She struggled, but couldn't get up. Yelling and cursing
did</b>
<br><b>nothing to free her. Finally she thought of reciting the Lord's
Prayer. With</b>
<br><b>that, the entity jumped up and flew under the bedroom door out into
the</b>
<br><b>hall, where it left in a red flash of light and demonic laughter.
After that</b>
<br><b>incident, she never did the Ouija board again and stopped all forms
of</b>
<br><b>divination and exploration of the paranormal.</b>
<br><b>I moved to 1623 Fitzwater Street, in Philadelphia, PA. One night
while</b>
<br><b>living there, I awoke to see a woman from the waist up hovering
over my bed.</b>
<br><b>She was an elderly black woman with an artificial looking wig on
her head. I</b>
<br><b>stared at her for about five minutes, neither of us communicated,
then she</b>
<br><b>disappeared. A few day later, I saw as I was lying in bed, the dark
form of</b>
<br><b>a man in my bedroom doorway. I asked who he was and what he wanted,
but the</b>
<br><b>form only shuffled back and forth in the corned of the doorway.
At the end</b>
<br><b>of that week, I got the news that a friend of mine's mother had
died and</b>
<br><b>that a male friend of mine had finally passed from AIDS after a
long</b>
<br><b>illness.</b>
<br><b>After Philadelphia, I moved to New York City. I lived on East 13th
Street,</b>
<br><b>between First and Second Avenues. During my stay there, I would
get this</b>
<br><b>overwhelming feeling of being stared at while I was sleeping by
a small boy</b>
<br><b>between the ages of six and eight. He would stare at me only inches
from my</b>
<br><b>face. When I would open my eyes, I would see his light, small figure
dash</b>
<br><b>out of the room and down the hall. Sometimes I would be reading
in bed and I</b>
<br><b>would see him peek around the corner in the hall, then disappear
when he saw</b>
<br><b>that I was awake. This went on until I moved.</b>
<br><b>I moved to East 9th Street. There I awoke one night to see my boyfriend</b>
<br><b>sleeping next to me and sitting up on the edge of the bed; there
were two of</b>
<br><b>my boyfriend in one spot. The one sitting on the edge of the bed
looked at</b>
<br><b>me with a smile and said, "Hello, bye," then jumped off the edge
of the bed</b>
<br><b>and scurried out of the room.</b>
<br><b>Then we moved to Fifth Street, in Jersey City, NJ. The house had
been owned</b>
<br><b>by Charlie and Maggie Olson since 1958. Charlie had died a year
prior to our</b>
<br><b>acquiring the property. The family, had not made any repairs or
improvements</b>
<br><b>to the one hundred and forty-two year old house since they moved
in. This</b>
<br><b>included painting from the looks of things. We started into renovating
as</b>
<br><b>soon as we received ownership. We had no plans to do anything major
to the</b>
<br><b>house, except paint and plaster. We respected the age and design
of the</b>
<br><b>property. About a week after moving in, I had a strange dream where
I</b>
<br><b>watched a grey haired man in blue work clothes crawling through
a tunnel of</b>
<br><b>light. After that dream I began to see Charlie in the house, or
feel his</b>
<br><b>presence. At first he preferred to hang around the skylight at the
top</b>
<br><b>landing. He always stayed in the hallway and stairwell. He would
peek in</b>
<br><b>doors occasionally, but never come in any of the rooms, except when
I was</b>
<br><b>fixing the room that had been Maggie's bedroom. There he seemed
to make the</b>
<br><b>repairs difficult. He doesn't approve of our changes to his house.
He once</b>
<br><b>went away for a week, to visit his wife (she moved to Bayonne) and
then came</b>
<br><b>back. Now after a year, Charlie isn't as strong a presence as he
was,</b>
<br><b>although he is still lingering at the turn in the stairs. A darker
force</b>
<br><b>inhabits the dining room. The dining room is in the basement level
of the</b>
<br><b>house and is four feet underground and six feet above. I cannot
get a fix on</b>
<br><b>what this force is, except that it isn't good and it is much older
than</b>
<br><b>Charlie. It does not enter the kitchen, which is on the same level
as the</b>
<br><b>dining room and will creep up the stairs, following me, but only
as high as</b>
<br><b>the ceiling of the dining room. Our neighborhood was built on a
swamp, which</b>
<br><b>may have something to do with the dark force.</b>
<br><b>The top front bedroom, where we sleep, seems to be a safe space.
I credit</b>
<br><b>St. Joseph with helping us get this house. On St. Joseph's day this
past</b>
<br><b>March, I lit a candle as an offering of thanks. The light of the
candle in</b>
<br><b>the darkness of the room formed the figure of a man. Directly above
the</b>
<br><b>candle flame was the head the arms and torso stretched across the
ceiling to</b>
<br><b>the light fixture (which is phallic shaped) his phallus was formed
by the</b>
<br><b>light fixture and his legs and feet stretched beyond. The entire
figure of</b>
<br><b>light was twelve feet long and three dimensional. It stayed as long
as the</b>
<br><b>candle burned; which was about a week. I had been seeing three dimensional</b>
<br><b>light ever since we began to sleep in the room. I have looked for
the</b>
<br><b>source, street lights or the moon. But it persists even without
those</b>
<br><b>sources.</b>
<br><b>I would appreciate your comments on any of these phenomena.</b>

<p><b>Little Girl Lost</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: jeanniev01@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>As for our story, we were stationed in Okinawa. It was 1987 and I
was</b>
<br><b>pregnant. We moved into a larger house on a differnt part of the
base</b>
<br><b>right before the baby was born (a few days actually!). After bringing
the baby</b>
<br><b>home we noticed that our dog seemed uneasy in the baby's room but
wouldn't</b>
<br><b>leave as long as the baby was in the room. She was extremely protective.
Within</b>
<br><b>a few weeks we began to notice odd happenings. Things like the baby
crying</b>
<br><b>but upon entering his room we'd find his mobile going. We just assumed
one of</b>
<br><b>our older children had wound it up and gone out the other door.
Then as he</b>
<br><b>grew we'd notice him staring and laughing at different spots on
the ceiling or</b>
<br><b>walls, he'd wake up from a nap and cry for us and when we'd enter
his room</b>
<br><b>he'd be laughing and playing with toys that I knew weren't in his
crib</b>
<br><b>when he was sleeping but suddenly he's playing contently with them.
On</b>
<br><b>different occassions we'd see shadows going around corners. Several
times late at</b>
<br><b>night while I was up with the baby or waiting for my husband to
come home (he</b>
<br><b>was&nbsp; a shift worker) I'd feel like someone was there and my
dog would growl and</b>
<br><b>the hairs on her back were up. One night as I sat rocking my son
I felt like I</b>
<br><b>was being watched and quickly turned around catching a glimpse of
a little</b>
<br><b>blonde haired girl about 3 years old. As soon as I turned around
she</b>
<br><b>disappeared. I looked but couldn't find her. After this it became
like a</b>
<br><b>game. She'd appear just long enough for me to see her then disappear
and</b>
<br><b>I'd look for her. I soon grew tired of this and when she'd disappear
I'd just</b>
<br><b>sit&nbsp; there. This led to a game like peek-a-boo. As we played
my baby would</b>
<br><b>giggle and laugh and I knew this was "who" he'd been playing with
in his</b>
<br><b>room. The more we played the more she let me see her. She was always</b>
<br><b>wearing a little pink housecoat&nbsp; (the quilted one with lace
that was popular about</b>
<br><b>20-25 years ago) and slippers with bunny heads on the front of the
foot</b>
<br><b>with floppy ears (also in pink and white). She had long blonde hair
(to about</b>
<br><b>the middle of her back)and big blue eyes. She was a beautiful child
and had</b>
<br><b>such a happy laugh. She seemed to stay in the baby's room or the
square hallway</b>
<br><b>between the bedrooms and bathroom. She never did anything bad and
seemed</b>
<br><b>very concerned about keeping the baby happy. Any time he even whimpered
we'd</b>
<br><b>know that no matter how quickly we'd get to his room he'd already
have his</b>
<br><b>favorite toys in his crib before we'd get there. On several occassions
my</b>
<br><b>husband saw her and they also played peek-a-boo. She was always
sweet and</b>
<br><b>playful. We knew she'd never harm the baby so we didn't worry when
we</b>
<br><b>heard him laughing or when we saw him pointing and playing with
things we</b>
<br><b>couldn't see. Our other children saw her on occassion and they too
witnessed the</b>
<br><b>toys being in the crib even though they knew they'd been across
the room on the</b>
<br><b>shelves. The little girl just became a part of our house in a sense.
She</b>
<br><b>seemed happy and like I said she loved playing with the baby and
making</b>
<br><b>him happy. We lived there until my son was about 18 months old.
It was</b>
<br><b>actually sad leaving her when we were reassigned. We wondered who
she was and what</b>
<br><b>the story was behind her and I called the MP station to see if there
was any</b>
<br><b>reports of anything happening in our house. They couldn't find anything.</b>
<br><b>Looking in old papers I couldn't find anything. So we never solved
the</b>
<br><b>mystery of the little girl but always wondered. Many years later
my</b>
<br><b>husband&nbsp; also died. After his death the children and I often
felt him in the house.</b>
<br><b>On several occassions we even saw him. After moving out I rented
the house to</b>
<br><b>a friend's family. They asked me if I had noticed anything weird
happening.</b>
<br><b>I asked why and they told me that they had a grandfather clock that
they</b>
<br><b>both had stppoed winding and suddenly it was wound. The entire time
they lived</b>
<br><b>there the clock stayed wound.</b>

<br><b>Little Boy</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:Anonymous</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>About 9 years ago I believe that a house that I was renting in Toronto
Canada was haunted.&nbsp; I was renting the main floor and upstairs of
the house with one of my friends and her baby boy.&nbsp; Before I moved
in my friend had mentioned some strange things that had happened, but I
didn't really believe her.&nbsp; She had said that she would hear heavy
breathing over the baby monitor, shortly before the baby would wake up
screaming.&nbsp; She was positive that it wasn't coming from the baby,
but something or someone else.</b>
<br><b>Some of the things that happened while I was living there were questionable.&nbsp;
Others weren't.&nbsp; For example;I would leave the door of the bathroom
open when I was taking a shower (no one else was home) but the door would
be closed when I got out of the shower.&nbsp; The floor was carpeted so
the door didn't move freely.If the light switch on the wall was in the
"off" position, the light would turn, as well as the reverse.&nbsp; We
would be sitting downstairs watching T.V. and we would hear footsteps across
the hallway upstairs.&nbsp; The tap in the kitchen would be turned off,
but water would start running and we couldn't turn it off.&nbsp; It would
stop by itself.&nbsp; One time we had a cordless phone,</b>
<br><b>unplugged on the shelf, without any batteries in it and the phone
started ringing.&nbsp; Small things would get moved around.&nbsp; Little
things like that were happening, but we weren't scared or anything.&nbsp;
I thought is was interesting.&nbsp; Of course no one else really believed
us.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What changed everything was when my boyfriend
stayed over one night.&nbsp; He woke up in the middle of the night and
he said he saw a little boy maybe 7 or 8 years old standing at his feet.&nbsp;
He described him as wearing a red jacket and a baseball cap.&nbsp; For
whatever reason something about the boy made him close his eyes and kind
of kick out.&nbsp; When he opened his eyes again there was nothing there.&nbsp;
From that point on other friends saw and heard things too.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One of our friends was over with her 3 year old son.&nbsp; They were staying
over, so I was putting her son to sleep in my bed.&nbsp; I read him a story
and everything was fine.&nbsp; About 20 minutes later he was sceaming at
the top of his lungs.&nbsp; When we rushed upstairs, he was completely
freaking out.&nbsp; He said there was a boy in the room.&nbsp; We tried
to question him about it and what we gathered was that the boy was older
than him and he was wearing a baseball cap.&nbsp; The strange thing was
when I asked him where the boy was he pointed at my bedroom window.&nbsp;
My bedroom was on the top floor.&nbsp; We brought Mathew downstairs with
us since he was too upset to stay upstairs. Later on he had to go to the
washroom which was also updtairs.&nbsp; I brought him to the washroom and
since he seemed fine I left him there to come back by himself.&nbsp; A
couple of minutes later he came back down; he hadn't even pulled up his
pants.&nbsp; A little bit later we were kind of playing with Mathew and
we asked him if he knew where the little boy was.&nbsp; He pointed to the
living room window.&nbsp; We told him to tell him to come inside, so Mathew
went to the front door and told him to come in.&nbsp; Then he was gone.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all of this had happened, we began to play
with the "ghost" as we had started to call it.&nbsp; We had a bunch of
friends over one night and were reading Tarot cards and talking about the
ghost.&nbsp; One of our friends came up with the idea of putting a quarter
in a circle rubbed into the carpet in my roommates room.&nbsp; We then
rubbed out all of the footprints leading into the room in order to be able
to tell if someone had walked in the room.&nbsp; The idea was to see if
the quarter would still be inside of the circle when we went back to check.&nbsp;
Later on in the night I had to go upstairs, so I brought another one of
my friends with me (for proof) to check on the quarter.&nbsp; It was flipped
over, outside of the circle.&nbsp; No one else had been upstairs.I had
wanted to hold a seance or something but my roommate was starting to get
upset by this point, so we didn't do anything.That's pretty much everything
that had happened because we ended up moving out not too long after that.&nbsp;
Sometimes I wonder if anyone else in that house ever experienced anything,
or what the history was behind the house.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ghost Doctor</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; chrisss@thornlight.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have enjoyed reading some of the many accounts of the supernatural
on your</b>
<br><b>web site and would like to contribute my own, or rather, that of
my mother.</b>
<br><b>I only know of one ghost story, but it is either true, or I'm calling
my mum</b>
<br><b>a liar. She used to be a nurse at Nottingham City Hospital (in England)</b>
<br><b>before I was born and one night she was working a night shift, when
a doctor</b>
<br><b>whom she had not seen before approached her and told her to keep
an eye on</b>
<br><b>one particular patient. She did as she was instructed, even though
the</b>
<br><b>patient seemed to be relatively stable. Later that night, the patient
went</b>
<br><b>in to cardiac arrest and almost died. My mum was astonished at how
the</b>
<br><b>doctor could have predicted such a thing and went to tell her ward
sister.</b>
<br><b>The ward sister didn't seem surprised and asked my mum to describe
the</b>
<br><b>doctor's appearance. She did so, then the ward sister took my mum
to the</b>
<br><b>entrance of the hospital wing, where a large painting hung, at the
bottom of</b>
<br><b>which was a commemorative plaque which bore a name, a date of birth
and a</b>
<br><b>date of death.</b>
<br><b>My mum recognised the man in the painting as the doctor she had
met earlier.</b>
<br><b>"Yes, I thought it might have been him." Said the ward sister. "I'm
told</b>
<br><b>that he comes back from time to time to check on the patients".</b>

<p><b>Books</b><b></b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Well I live in a small house in Taunton,MA. My hauntings are very
weird, because different things happen.Let me get started on telling you,
I have a book case that is located in the hall way at the top of the staircase
leading up to the bed rooms.</b>
<br><b>Well six out of ten times the books fall I mean the big books that
we keep on top of the book case. One time a big dictionary fell and I dodged
it by an inch.</b>
<br><b>Another experience is one night a friend was sleeping over and we
were in the living room. It was about 12:00PM when we were just about to
doze off. All of a sudden there was the biggest boom it sounded like someone
took a bowling ball threw it up in the air and let it slam on the floor.
One time when I was in my room starting to fall asleep there was something
that caught my eye in the corner of my room. It was a misty figure of a
old women. She just stood in the corner for about 4-5 min. than disapered.
The two most frighting experiences that ever happened to me were both in
me room at night. First I was just laying there when a white-ish fog glided
across the floor and right throught the door hopefully the first and last
time I will ever see that.&nbsp; The second thing is when (this experience
was so frighting my hands are shaking now) I was laying there in my bed
,once again, and I had the sensation someone or something was sitting on
my legs. So, I tried to lift my legs up but it just wasent working. Than
a few seconds later my legs flew up and werent held down. Now the most
thing that happens is the books.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Black Angel Of Iowa</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: res04xyu@gte.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;I have grown up two blocks away from this cementary. Me and
my brother played around and even climed on her. One late afternoon my
brother and I went to a wooden park nearby the cementary. When we lost
track of time, we realized the sun was setting. As we started home we both
got the feeling we were being watched. Then we could here footsteps behind
us. As we went faster so did the footsteps.. We ran as fast as our legs
could carry us still hearing the sound behind us. We saw the Angel and
ran towards the cementary to her. The street lights lit her up we figured
we would be safe there. When we entered the cementary we could hear someone
in the shadows walking in the leaves on th ground. We got closer to the
Black Angel I saw a blue light come from her eyes. We jumped up on the
base of her, backs against her. We felt safe, and the sounds faded away.
My brother than asked me if I saw the blue eyes. About ten to fifteen min.
later my grandmother walked up&nbsp; looking for us. The words still ring
in my ears today to what she said to us."When I could not find you two
at the park, I knew the Angel was taken care of you." My grandmother has
lived near there for over fifty years. Any stories that I have heard about
her. The teenagers, years ago that took a chainsaw and cut her fingers
off. They got killed in a car accident driving down I-80 before constuction
was done. The drove into a big hole and all was decapitated.</b>

<br><b>Buildings 2&amp;10 at Sinclair Community College</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Shinobi691@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am currently attending Sinclair Community College in Dayton, Ohio
for my</b>
<br><b>Step 2 Tool and Die Machinist certificate. When I first started
at Sinclair,</b>
<br><b>I was scheduled to take classes in building 10, and I had to walk
through</b>
<br><b>building 2 to get to some of my other classes in building 5. When
I would</b>
<br><b>walk through building 2, I would always get a serious feeling of
dread, and</b>
<br><b>it was as if a thousand things were staring at me from whatever
shadows were</b>
<br><b>there. I am not a guy that is easily intimidated, being 6'3", 360#
and a</b>
<br><b>martial artist for most of my life, as well as being a Zen practitioner.
I</b>
<br><b>would often feel like I was being watched in building 10, where
my classes</b>
<br><b>were being held in the lower level classrooms, and on the grounds
between</b>
<br><b>Building 2 and 10. I don't get the feeling like they are practically
on top</b>
<br><b>of me anymore, since I now have a Seal of Solomon, which has certain
hebrew</b>
<br><b>symbols and divine names on it to disperse negative energy, but
none the</b>
<br><b>less, I looked up the history of the grounds that these buildings
are built</b>
<br><b>on. I found out that the city's gallows were once there, where many
prisoners</b>
<br><b>were executed. This would explain the build up of negative energy,
and the</b>
<br><b>multitude of other occurences I also heard about from other students,
and</b>
<br><b>teachers. What I am about to relate to you is second hand-my friend
talked to</b>
<br><b>these people and related it to me when he heard about my investigative</b>
<br><b>efforts into the schools reported incidents- from a pair of former
security</b>
<br><b>officers that experienced it, and now refuse to go anywhere near
Blair Hall,</b>
<br><b>let alone the vicinity of building 2. They were on their usual rounds</b>
<br><b>checking to see if all the doors were secure around 11:30-11:45pm,
and split</b>
<br><b>up to check Blair Hall and the upper floors of building 2. The female
guard</b>
<br><b>went into Blair Hall, to check the stage door, and back stage for
students in</b>
<br><b>the drama class before securing the theatre area, since they often
kept late</b>
<br><b>hours rehearsing. When she went in to check, the theater was almost
pitch</b>
<br><b>black, so she reached for her flashlight to turn it on. Before she
could, she</b>
<br><b>heard footsteps and a rustling noise in the vicinity of the stage.
She</b>
<br><b>cautiously backed out and went outside to call for her partner.
Within a</b>
<br><b>couple minutes, he had joined her, and told him what she had heard.
They</b>
<br><b>proceded into the theater with their lights on, slowly scaning&nbsp;
the stage</b>
<br><b>area to see who was the cause of the noise. Their beams came to
rest on a</b>
<br><b>dark shape toward the right side of the stage, which appeared to
be very</b>
<br><b>large, possibly 8 or 9 feet tall with no distinct features about
it with the</b>
<br><b>exception of two slits where the eyes should have been, which glowed
with a</b>
<br><b>peircing red light. They told my friend-who also works in security-
that they</b>
<br><b>drew their guns at this point and told "it" to stay where it was
and</b>
<br><b>identified themselves as security officers. It then began to approach
them,</b>
<br><b>as they described it it was gliding rather than walking, and started
to laugh</b>
<br><b>at them, almost deafeningly. They told it to stop twice more before
they</b>
<br><b>opened fire, and dumped 2 8-round clips total into it, and it kept
coming,</b>
<br><b>after appearing to react to the bullets hitting it. At that point,
the thing</b>
<br><b>was only 10 meters from them, and they couldn't have missed. they
turned and</b>
<br><b>ran, and called for backup once they got out of the theater, and
continued</b>
<br><b>running out of the building. Once more backup arrived a few minutes
later,</b>
<br><b>they went in and checked, and with the exception of the casings
on the floor</b>
<br><b>from their sidearms, no trace was found of the bullets, or the "thing".
I</b>
<br><b>hope that I never run into this entity, which was evidently solid
enough to</b>
<br><b>take bullet impacts, and keep coming. I don't know what it was,
but I have</b>
<br><b>heard speculation about it being a wraith or a demon, or perhaps
the mass</b>
<br><b>negative energy from all the people they hung there.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Dark Shadows</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ljhudgens@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have had many experiences, but I will tell you about the first
that I can</b>
<br><b>remember. When I was about 4 and my sister 6, our family lived in
a very</b>
<br><b>small house located in a suburb of Albuquerque, New Mexico. We were
there</b>
<br><b>for a couple of years and lots of strange stuff happened. My father
tells me</b>
<br><b>now that my mom and him were aware of it, but did not want to scare
my</b>
<br><b>sister and I by acknowledging it. The layout of the house was simple.
You</b>
<br><b>entered directly into the living room, with the kitchen being straight</b>
<br><b>ahead. Off to the left of the living room was a small dark hallway,
with two</b>
<br><b>bedrooms on the left, and the bathroom and master bedroom on the
right. Off</b>
<br><b>the master was another bathroom that led to the kitchen again.</b>
<br><b>My sister and I slept in the room furthest down the hall on the
left, across</b>
<br><b>from the master. Almost every night we would scream to my dad that
there was</b>
<br><b>a gorilla in the closet, and he would come in, bang around in the
closet,</b>
<br><b>pronounce the gorilla evicted for the night, and we would happily
fall</b>
<br><b>asleep. The thing is, we would actually see something big and dark
moving</b>
<br><b>around in the closet. Most times it would just stand there, never
exiting,</b>
<br><b>just staring (it was featureless, but you could feel it watching).
Often, we</b>
<br><b>would awaken in the morning to see that darned closet door open
after we had</b>
<br><b>watched our father shut it the night before. To this day I must
have the</b>
<br><b>closet door shut or I will not be able to sleep for fear I might
see</b>
<br><b>something in there! (And no, there was nothing wrong with the door.
It</b>
<br><b>latched quite firmly.)</b>
<br><b>Invariably, and this is the part that always terrified me the most,
I would</b>
<br><b>have to go to the bathroom at night. It was down the hall next to
the</b>
<br><b>entrance to the living room. The living room was always pitch dark,
as my</b>
<br><b>mom had very heavy curtains over the window to keep the sun from
heating it</b>
<br><b>up in the summer and at night to keep the streetlight from lighting
up the</b>
<br><b>whole house (it was right outside and very bright). What little
light there</b>
<br><b>was filtered in from the tiny kitchen window, and on a night with
little or</b>
<br><b>no moon it was DARK!</b>
<br><b>My parents left the bathroom light on at night so my sis and I could
find</b>
<br><b>our way there and not be so scared. (And so we wouldn't keep waking
them up</b>
<br><b>to take us!) Whenever I had to go at night, there was always a large
black</b>
<br><b>shadow standing right at the edge of the light spilling across the
hall from</b>
<br><b>the bathroom. It was like it couldn't cross that light barrier.
It just</b>
<br><b>stood there motionless, darker than the darkness around it. My sister
and I</b>
<br><b>insisted that a witch lived in the living room at night. (Although
now I am</b>
<br><b>more inclined to think the presence was male, it was just witches
wore all</b>
<br><b>black, and it seemed to have a pointy hat...) It never harmed me
or my sis</b>
<br><b>in any way, it just stood there. We would talk about it once in
awhile, and</b>
<br><b>we confirmed we had each seen the same thing. Sometimes, we would
even wait</b>
<br><b>for the other to have to go to, so we could go together. I was also
under</b>
<br><b>the impression somehow that the presence in the closet was not the
same as</b>
<br><b>the one in the living room.</b>
<br><b>Once, my sis and I had gotten up way earlier than my parents. It
was that</b>
<br><b>blue-gray twilight just before dawn. Probably around 5:30 or 6 am.
We had</b>
<br><b>gone into the kitchen since the 'witch' left as soon as it started
to</b>
<br><b>lighten even a little bit in the living room, from light coming
in the</b>
<br><b>kitchen window. We were going to color and draw and did not want
to disturb</b>
<br><b>our parents so early. As we sat at the kitchen table, which was
right across</b>
<br><b>from the living room entrance, an intensely bright ball of light
shot across</b>
<br><b>the living room at great speed. It took probably less that a second
to go</b>
<br><b>from the hallway side to the outer wall of the living room. Remember,
the</b>
<br><b>living room window was covered by heavy curtains. So no passing
car</b>
<br><b>headlights could explain this. The kitchen window faced the back
yard, which</b>
<br><b>was bordered by a six foot high cinder block wall, which faced an
alley,</b>
<br><b>which was bordered by another six foot high wall bordering the neighbor's</b>
<br><b>yards. So no headlights could come in that way either. We simply
looked at</b>
<br><b>each other and continued coloring.</b>
<br><b>My dad told me he would hear heavy booted footsteps on the roof
(it was a</b>
<br><b>one story house, with little or no attic space). Upon investigation,
of</b>
<br><b>course, nothing would be found.</b>
<br><b>The alley behind the house scared me as well. It was used by the
city for</b>
<br><b>trash pick-up. It had these concrete pads recessed into the walls.
There</b>
<br><b>were two foot high walls around the pads in the back yards of the
houses so</b>
<br><b>trash cans and bags could be lifted over them and set onto the concrete
pad.</b>
<br><b>I remember seeing an old man, dressed in rags, coming down the alley
one day</b>
<br><b>when I was out there (not being allowed out there, of course I had
to go</b>
<br><b>investigate). I became frightened and turned to run back into the
yard</b>
<br><b>through the trash pick-up bin. I was about six at the time, so I
was just</b>
<br><b>big enough to climb the two foot walls around the bin in the back
yard. I</b>
<br><b>glanced back just as I entered the bin and he had simply disappeared.
From</b>
<br><b>the time I looked away to the time I looked back was just a second
or so.</b>
<br><b>Since the alley was bordered by six foot cinder block walls, and
he was</b>
<br><b>nowhere near a neighbor's bin that I could tell, to this day I don't
know</b>
<br><b>where he went.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Duck your head in the kitchen</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bpcoffey@gis.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>During high school I had a friend who lived down the road from my</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; Very often when school let out early, we headed immediately
for</b>
<br><b>her house since both her parents worked and we could get into whatever</b>
<br><b>mischief we wanted without an authority figure to answer to.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well,</b>
<br><b>everyone in her family, including her, were neat freaks.&nbsp; This
meant</b>
<br><b>that in her home there was not a crumb to be found on a table, not
a</b>
<br><b>smudge mark on the mirrors, etc.</b>
<br><b>Several times when we came home from school,( and for some reason,
this</b>
<br><b>only happened on half days, mind you), we found all the kitchen</b>
<br><b>cupboards and drawers wide open.&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaving cabinet doors
open was an</b>
<br><b>impossibility for such a cautiously clean family like hers.&nbsp;
I sometimes</b>
<br><b>wonder whether her mother noticed this when she got home from work</b>
<br><b>before the rest of the family but just closed the doors and never
said</b>
<br><b>anything to the rest about it.</b>
<br><b>I also wonder if this situation had anything to do with the myriad
of</b>
<br><b>Indian Burial Mounds in the woods behind our houses.&nbsp; Those
woods were</b>
<br><b>said to be cursed and teens who partied back in those woods at a
place</b>
<br><b>called "The Tables" told stories of being chased through the woods
by an</b>
<br><b>invisible being.&nbsp; I haven't found a way to tie in this thought

<br><b>&nbsp;When I was young we (my family)use to go to my greataunts'
house in</b>
<br><b>Old Mines, Mo. for family gatherings. There all my aunts,uncles,
and</b>
<br><b>cousins would gather for a "Bullion Party" which is a old french
custom</b>
<br><b>of boiling chicken and eating it and the clear soup(bullion). Old
Mines</b>
<br><b>is an old french mining town. After dinner the adults would play
pinochle</b>
<br><b>which lead to nickel dime poker. The kids would be left to ourselves.We</b>
<br><b>would usually play hide and seek until the wee hours of the morning.for</b>
<br><b>some reason this night we (the kids) where discussing ghosts and
other</b>
<br><b>such stuff in my cousin Mary's room(she lived</b>
<br><b>with with my greataunt). We then went outside (around 1am) and proceeded</b>
<br><b>to play hide and seek. Well my aunts yard is fenced in all around
and</b>
<br><b>the only way in is from theroad across a small bridge which spanned
a</b>
<br><b>deep gully. We were hiding around her yard behind sheds,outhouse,
and</b>
<br><b>other parts of the yard. I was sneaking up the south side of the
house(front</b>
<br><b>porch was base)when I saw a girl on the outside of the fence. Remember</b>
<br><b>I said to get outside the yard you had to go out the front gate.
On this</b>
<br><b>side of the house there was about 10 feet to the fence from the
house</b>
<br><b>and about the same from the fence to the edge of the woods. My aunt
lived</b>
<br><b>in the woods about a mile from her nearest neighbor (which was family</b>
<br><b>who were at the party.This girl was blonde and about 5ft 2,wearing
a</b>
<br><b>pink gingham dress (pink and white checkered) and standing just
at the</b>
<br><b>edge of the woods, hands folded at her waist, watching me. I could
just</b>
<br><b>make her out from the light from the front porch. Now that I think
of</b>
<br><b>it I don't remember her face clearly. Well I thought it was my cousin</b>
<br><b>Patty, who was the only blonde at the party, and I whispered that
I would</b>
<br><b>meet her on the front porch (figuring she had to go around to the
gate</b>
<br><b>to get in the yard. I then proceeded along the house and ran-up
and taggedbase.</b>
<br><b>Not more than a couple seconds later, patty came around the other
side</b>
<br><b>of the house. She was wearing a flannel shirt and jeans! I didn't
think</b>
<br><b>much about it the rest of the night. After getting home I realized
that</b>
<br><b>the girl had not said anything and was wearing a dress (this party
was</b>
<br><b>in October).We had these parties about once a month until my aunt
died</b>
<br><b>several years later. I asked all my cousins,brother and sisters
at the</b>
<br><b>next party if they had seen anything but none had. I still remember</b>
<br><b>this vividly 30yrs later (I was 14) and tell this story at family
gatherings.</b>
<br><b>Maybe she heard us playing and she wanted to play too.</b>

<p><b>My Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Sarah S.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have always been fascinated with ghosts and the unexplained.&nbsp;
I never</b>
<br><b>thought I'd be faced to live with them though...</b>
<br><b>Everyone knows that certain individuals can be haunted, as well
as homes and</b>
<br><b>woods and other things.&nbsp; My experiences began when my sister
Amy's friend</b>
<br><b>moved in with us.&nbsp; Her friend had a troubled past, and her
life was full of</b>
<br><b>sorrow.&nbsp; One evening, Amy, her friend (Kim) and myself were
in the dining</b>
<br><b>room chatting and such.&nbsp; Suddenly Amy and Kim stopped talking
and looked at</b>
<br><b>each other nervously.&nbsp; They turned to me and asked simultaneously
if I had</b>
<br><b>"felt that."&nbsp; Then, without even waiting for my reply, they
ran terrified</b>
<br><b>from the house.&nbsp; Not knowing what was going on, I followed
them.&nbsp; To this</b>
<br><b>very day I am still not clear what happened.&nbsp; They never really
told me.</b>
<br><b>A few moths later, Amy was sitting on her bedroom floor cleaning
her closet.</b>
<br><b>My father had left for work about an hour earlier, Kim was out,
and my mother</b>
<br><b>and I were down in the family room watching a movie we had rented.&nbsp;
Suddenly</b>
<br><b>we heard Amy yell and start pounding on the floor.&nbsp; My mother
sent me up to</b>
<br><b>find out what had happened.&nbsp; I went upstairs and called for
Amy.&nbsp; She quickly</b>
<br><b>opened her door and asked, "Were you just up here? Were you just
outside my</b>
<br><b>door?"&nbsp; I told her no, I was watching a film with my mother.&nbsp;
She didn't</b>
<br><b>believe me at first, since I have a long history of scaring the
wits out of</b>
<br><b>her.&nbsp; Them my mother came up and wanted to know what happened.&nbsp;
When she told</b>
<br><b>my sister that we had both been down watching a film, Amy bolted
from her</b>
<br><b>room and ran to the family room.&nbsp; She told us that she was
cleaning her</b>
<br><b>closet when she heard footsteps walk down the hall and stop outside
of her</b>
<br><b>room (which is in the middle of the hall).&nbsp; Then she heard
a knock on the</b>
<br><b>door, and what sounded like fingernails scratching down the length
of the</b>
<br><b>door.&nbsp; She at first thought it our father trying to scare her.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A short</b>
<br><b>while had past when she realized that she hadn't heard steps walk
away from</b>
<br><b>the door.&nbsp; It was also then that she realized our father had
left for work</b>
<br><b>for the night and no one else was home.</b>
<br><b>No one believed her at first.&nbsp; We thought it was here imagination
since she</b>
<br><b>is a naturally jumpy person.&nbsp; Then one day, Amy and I were
in the family room</b>
<br><b>watching television.&nbsp; Our parents were at work, and so was
Kim.&nbsp; We were</b>
<br><b>talking and laughing when we heard a noise.&nbsp; We muted the T.V.
and listened.</b>
<br><b>Then we heard the chair in the computer room rolling around on the
hardwood</b>
<br><b>floor.&nbsp; Sure enough, when we went to investigate, the chair
was across the</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; We knew it could not have been one of us because our
mother always</b>
<br><b>yells when chairs are not pushed in.</b>
<br><b>Months had passed without much happening.&nbsp;&nbsp; The most exciting
thing was that</b>
<br><b>I would always hear my mother call my name, only to find out that
my mother</b>
<br><b>would be on the phone, or not even be home at all.</b>
<br><b>After that, more thing began to happen.&nbsp; My father was home
alone working in</b>
<br><b>the basement when&nbsp; he heard the front door slam and several
heavy footsteps</b>
<br><b>go rushing through the upper part of the house.&nbsp; One day, my
mother was at</b>
<br><b>the dining room table reading her paper when she heard the kitchen/basement</b>
<br><b>door open, and the fridge and cabinets doors open and close.&nbsp;
Thinking it was</b>
<br><b>Kim coming to get a snack, she went into the kitchen only to find
it empty.</b>
<br><b>She went down to Kim's room only to find her asleep.</b>
<br><b>The incidents ended as quickly as they started.&nbsp; Then last
major incident</b>
<br><b>happen one evening when Amy and Kim invited an old friend of theirs
over to</b>
<br><b>watch movies and play pool in the basement.&nbsp; We were all near
the dining room</b>
<br><b>watching the movie when Amy's guest said he saw someone walking
into the last</b>
<br><b>bedroom of the hall, which was my room at the time.&nbsp; We told
him he must be</b>
<br><b>mistaken, since no one else was home.&nbsp; We quickly decided to
play pool in the</b>
<br><b>basement.&nbsp; We went down and started laughing and joking and
listening to</b>
<br><b>music very loud.&nbsp; Then we heard a noise.&nbsp; We turned the
music off and</b>
<br><b>listened.&nbsp; We heard the basement door slam shut and heavy footsteps
walk down</b>
<br><b>the stairs.&nbsp; It repeated itself all to quickly for it to be
human.&nbsp; SLAM!</b>
<br><b>Thump-thump-thump...SLAM! Thump-thump-thump... over and over.&nbsp;
When it</b>
<br><b>finally stopped, we ran up from the basement and out of the house.</b>
<br><b>Nothing has happened since then, because Kim moved out soon after
that.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>believe that a spirit followed Kim around and stayed at our house
during the</b>
<br><b>time Kim lived here.&nbsp; I am still interested in ghosts, and
now attend a</b>
<br><b>school which has had several sightings of a spirit named Emily.</b>
<br><b>I''ll let you know if anything happens with her.</b><b></b>
