<p><b><font size=+1>Oklahoma Haunt</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: galid_99@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>You asked for ghost stories and I recently had an</b>
<br><b>experience that I could not explain</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am a maintenance person for two small apartment</b>
<br><b>communities in Oklahoma.&nbsp; I recently had to clean an</b>
<br><b>apartment in which a man lost at Russian roulette.</b>
<br><b>During the first day, I felt uneasy, thinking this was</b>
<br><b>strictly a psychological effect of knowing about the</b>
<br><b>violent death of this man, I resolved to finish the</b>
<br><b>first part of the task and come back the next day with</b>
<br><b>my dog.&nbsp; I did so on the following day.&nbsp; Around noon,</b>
<br><b>I was painting and my hair, which is long and kept in</b>
<br><b>a rubberbanded bun at the nape of my neck, came down.</b>
<br><b>My hair never comes down due to the way I tie it.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>thought maybe the band was bad, so I tied it up again</b>
<br><b>and went on with my work.&nbsp; I went to another room to</b>
<br><b>begin repairs in there, this time my dog followed.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>hair came down again and I felt a definite brush</b>
<br><b>against the back of my head, like fingers running</b>
<br><b>through hair.&nbsp; My dog reacted, barking and growling.</b>
<br><b>By this time I was seriously spooked, but since I was</b>
<br><b>almost finished and I am the only person on the job, I</b>
<br><b>finished the day, constantly putting up my hair and</b>
<br><b>enduring chills.&nbsp; I told my husband, who manages the</b>
<br><b>apartment what happened, when I came that evening and</b>
<br><b>he, the sweetheart, informed me that he had seen the</b>
<br><b>shape of the man when he went to the bathroom to check</b>
<br><b>an electrical problem the week before.&nbsp; I have had to</b>
<br><b>go back to the apartment since and have noted lights</b>
<br><b>on when no one occupied the unit and odors emanating</b>
<br><b>from the wall that was covered with the unfortunate</b>
<br><b>man's blood.&nbsp; I also had to re-clean the shelves in</b>
<br><b>the unit because moldy bread keeps reappearing. Don't</b>
<br><b>ask me why, I don't know. But, anyway, If you want to</b>
<br><b>use this in your site, please feel free.</b>

<p><b>By: ArtSkate38@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I distinctly remember sitting in a room when I was young (I seem
to remember</b>
<br><b>being really little) talking to my parents about how I wanted to
go with them</b>
<br><b>to their trip to England. They were going on this trip the next
day. They</b>
<br><b>were talking about going to a castle in England where there was
a hedge maze</b>
<br><b>and I remember really really wanting to go with them. We had a conversation</b>
<br><b>about how it was a "parents only" vacation and how "nice my babysitter
would</b>
<br><b>be".</b>
<br><b>One night about six months ago, I mentioned this trip to my dad,
asking how</b>
<br><b>old I was when they went to England. He said I wasnt even born then.
I was</b>
<br><b>shocked because I distinctly remember talking to them about it before
the</b>
<br><b>trip.</b>
<br><b>Then, I also thought about the recurring dream that I have been
having as</b>
<br><b>long as I remember. In this dream, I am standing in an English hedge-maze,</b>
<br><b>and my father is standing there saying over and over, "it is your
turn. it is</b>
<br><b>your turn.".</b>
<br><b>Turns out that I was concieved on the trip they had to England.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>How I got into Ghost Stuff</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: FUNKYFINGERS@webtv.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;Thanks for the info on night vision scopes. I have to tell
you my story</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;about getting into ghost stuff though. (I may have posted
this long</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;ago). Ok, bout 3 years ago i started getting into ghost because
i got my</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;internet. I piddled with the sites just here and there. Later
my mom</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;opened a shop that sold custom painted used and antique furniture.
I</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;noticed in some pics from her shop that there was orbs floating
over</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;various peoples heads, so i went through other photos of mine
and found</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;maybe 5 or 6 more in the whole family collection. (That spans
20 years).</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The weird thing is, is that there was as many strange photos
from the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;shop as there was in our picture history. Six photos came
out strange</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;from the 24 taken! 5 w/orbs, 1 w/white blur. Heres the main
catch of my</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;story though. My mom closed the shop soon after that and thats
when i</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;really GOT INTO ghost stuff. So that left me with a potential</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;investgation WASTED! I still get mad over that because ive
always wanted</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;to hunt and where could there be a better place than there....I
can back</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;up the photos with 3 things:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;1. Antique furniture = Ghost</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;2. Orbs floating over heads = Ghost</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;3. Noises heard sometimes by my mom = Ghost.....</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Feel free to post this as a story on your site.....Thanks.</b>

<br><b><font size=+1>My Grandmother's thoughts!</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: 1cartoon@home.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Wow, I never thought I would tell this story on the Net.&nbsp; ,
I am not</b>
<br><b>even sure of how to type it because it was just so real.</b>
<br><b>Lets see..</b>
<br><b>I was maybe 16 or 17 years old.&nbsp; My grandfather had passed
away months</b>
<br><b>before my grandma.&nbsp; He died in route to the hospital, and my
mom was</b>
<br><b>with my grandma at the time.&nbsp; Anyway, my grandmother was having
a very</b>
<br><b>difficult time with his loss, and had become very distant to everyone.</b>
<br><b>It was all we could do to keep her company and try to keep her mind
on</b>
<br><b>the present and not the past.&nbsp; My mother was constantly trying
to get us</b>
<br><b>kids over to see her and keep her company (those of us that drove,
she</b>
<br><b>wanted us to visit her on our own). Anyway, one particular afternoon,
it</b>
<br><b>was asked of me to visit her and I didn't.&nbsp; I was a teenager
and had</b>
<br><b>other things to do.&nbsp; Anyway, days went by and no one could
find my</b>
<br><b>grandma.&nbsp; She left her rings on her dining room table and all
of her</b>
<br><b>personal belongings in the house.&nbsp; Then we heard she was found
(drowned</b>
<br><b>in the river), and that was her ending to life.&nbsp; You see, my
grandma and</b>
<br><b>grandpa had a beautiful house on the river.&nbsp; Probably a year
had passed</b>
<br><b>and for some reason my destiny brought me to actually live in their</b>
<br><b>house, while I was just getting out on my own, while they were in
the</b>
<br><b>process of selling the house.&nbsp; I lived there for the summer
of 1985.</b>
<br><b>Many strange phanomanas happened that made me a true believer of
the</b>
<br><b>afterlife, but one in particular will stay in my mind the most.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;One day, literally in the middle of the afternoon, I was walking
from</b>
<br><b>the kitchen into the Living room.&nbsp; I can only recall my last
moment of</b>
<br><b>actually being myself, until I had walked through the threshold
of the</b>
<br><b>kitchen to the livingroom, at such time I only remember walking
into a</b>
<br><b>Dark Cold Freezer (that is what it felt like).&nbsp; I stayed in
the dark</b>
<br><b>cold place until I began to think for myself again.&nbsp; It was
at that</b>
<br><b>point, as I was standing in front of these glass doors that face
the</b>
<br><b>River, that I had mixed emotions of not just my own, but also my</b>
<br><b>grandmothers.&nbsp; As I was beginning to see the world again, it
was my</b>
<br><b>grandmothers thoughts.&nbsp; I remember standing there thinking
how the River</b>
<br><b>was my savior and the answer to all my problems and worries were
inside</b>
<br><b>the river.&nbsp; Then I knew it was what I had to do, and I was
not afraid.</b>
<br><b>The River was going to take me where I wanted to go to be happy
again.</b>
<br><b>Just as I was thinking these thoughts, it scared me, because I knew
I</b>
<br><b>was not that kind of person, and&nbsp; "WHO'S THOUGHTS WAS I THINKING".&nbsp;
It</b>
<br><b>was very quick, and my grandmother left my soul.&nbsp; But from
that time on,</b>
<br><b>I really understood what was going through her mind at the time
she</b>
<br><b>decided to do what she did.&nbsp; It was almost like she was happy
to be</b>
<br><b>telling someone, what she did was not a bad thing, it was what she</b>
<br><b>wanted most in the world.&nbsp; I was happy and scared all at the
same time.</b>
<br><b>She was there, in this house, telling me her life story, because
of this</b>
<br><b>situation, and all the others that she brought to me while I was
living</b>
<br><b>there, I believe that a person does not always leave this earth</b>
<br><b>completely.&nbsp; Atleast, until they have been able to explain
why they were</b>
<br><b>here in the first place......and why they left.</b>

<p><b>By:dspe@sequent.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This story starts the day we moved to Canby, Oregon.&nbsp; My father
in law</b>
<br><b>was gracious enough to let my wife and I stay in the family house
until</b>
<br><b>it was sold.&nbsp; This house was occupied by my wifes grandfather
until he</b>
<br><b>died which was about 8 months before we moved in.&nbsp; The family
was having</b>
<br><b>trouble selling the house and thought it would be good to have someone</b>
<br><b>to occupy it until it was sold to upkeep the grounds and take care
of</b>
<br><b>the property.&nbsp; The house was big to me coming from an apartment.
Two</b>
<br><b>story and five bedrooms not including the basement we were both
in awe</b>
<br><b>the day we pulled up.&nbsp; The house sits on an acre of land out
in the</b>
<br><b>country and was also located directly next to an old Pioneer Cemetary.</b>
<br><b>It was a little to close for my comfort actually.&nbsp; When you
pulled your</b>
<br><b>car up in the driveway you actually had to get out on someones grave.</b>
<br><b>My first night there was sleepless to say the least.&nbsp; This
house</b>
<br><b>reminded me of the house on Night of the living dead.&nbsp; Eventually
I got</b>
<br><b>use to the house and all its creaking and groanings and was ashamed
of</b>
<br><b>myself for being scared.&nbsp; My father in law will not talk about
his dad,</b>
<br><b>there were some strange things that occured there and Im not sure
what.</b>
<br><b>In all the closets we found clocks drawn on the walls in crayon
with the</b>
<br><b>hands of the clocks in different positions.&nbsp; Not just one clock
but many</b>
<br><b>clocks in all of the closets. Trap doors and drawers in rooms that
were</b>
<br><b>set up to only open with a secret spring latch hidden away.&nbsp;
(I followed</b>
<br><b>a hidden string that led me to it!) I've had the feeling, along
with my</b>
<br><b>wife, that the children were kept in closets here as punishment.&nbsp;
None</b>
<br><b>of the family wants the house(there are 5 brothers and 1 sister)
and</b>
<br><b>will not set foot on the property.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I had a bad feeling in this house the day we moved in.&nbsp; My wife
did too</b>
<br><b>she just wouldnt admit it.&nbsp; It was free so we stayed.&nbsp;
For the first 6</b>
<br><b>months nothing out of the ordinary happened.&nbsp; Then everything
happened</b>
<br><b>at once.&nbsp; I was awake one night when I heard someone coming
up from the</b>
<br><b>basement.&nbsp; Not just coming up but pounding up the stairs.&nbsp;
Every step</b>
<br><b>got louder and louder until I thought I would die with fright.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>thought someone had broke in the basement window and was coming
up the</b>
<br><b>stairs.&nbsp; I jumped up and threw on the light and they stopped.&nbsp;
My wife</b>
<br><b>woke up and asked me what the hell that noise was.&nbsp; I grabbed
a bat and</b>
<br><b>told her to call the police someone is in the basement.&nbsp; I
looked but no</b>
<br><b>one was there.&nbsp; A little while later my wifes little sister
who at the</b>
<br><b>time was 20 moved into this house with us.&nbsp; She needed somewhere
to stay</b>
<br><b>until she could find a place to rent.&nbsp; She wanted to stay upstairs</b>
<br><b>(there was 2 bedrooms up there) that way should could have the whole</b>
<br><b>upper part of the house to herself.&nbsp; We were both relieved
to have</b>
<br><b>someone else move in.&nbsp; The next morning we awoke to find my
wifes sister</b>
<br><b>sleeping on our floor in our room.&nbsp; When asked what happened
she</b>
<br><b>sheepishly replied nothing and left for work.&nbsp; She tried staying
there</b>
<br><b>another night but soon moved all her stuff downstairs with us.&nbsp;
When</b>
<br><b>asked why she avoided the question.&nbsp; When I had her alone she
finally</b>
<br><b>admitted that she heard noises in the cubby holes up there.&nbsp;
She borded</b>
<br><b>them up with bookshelves shed brought but they wouldnt stay closed.&nbsp;
Her</b>
<br><b>stuff was thrown out of the way.&nbsp; She left her stereo up there
though.</b>
<br><b>This was the only thing she left up there.&nbsp; On more than one
occasion I</b>
<br><b>was woken up by the sounds of that stereo.&nbsp; The first time
I was asleep</b>
<br><b>during the day (I was working graveyard then).&nbsp; It was so loud
that I</b>
<br><b>got pissed and figuring her sister was home and turned on the stereo
I</b>
<br><b>ran upstairs to tell her to turn it off.&nbsp; It was not on.&nbsp;
She was not</b>
<br><b>there. This happened for 3 days in a row and I finally checked the
dam</b>
<br><b>thing and it wasnt plugged in.&nbsp; I foolishly told my wifes sister
about</b>
<br><b>this, I say foolishly because she left the next day leaving us alone</b>
<br><b>again.&nbsp; It was quiet for about a week.&nbsp; I was sitting
in the living room</b>
<br><b>eating when I heard a sound coming out of the kitchen.&nbsp; I was
alone and</b>
<br><b>it was during the day again.&nbsp; I heard the sound of our cookie
jar (the</b>
<br><b>pillsbury dough boy).&nbsp; This sound is made when you lift the
head of the</b>
<br><b>doughboy off.&nbsp; It makes a mechanical laughter noise.&nbsp;
I then heard the</b>
<br><b>sound of the head being placed back on.&nbsp; Kind of a porcelin
against</b>
<br><b>pocelin sound.&nbsp; Figuring my wife had snuck in and done this.
(We always</b>
<br><b>thought the noise it made was funny and pulled the head off once
a day</b>
<br><b>or so) I called into the kitchen for my wife.&nbsp; When no response
came I</b>
<br><b>went in to investigate.&nbsp; She was not there.&nbsp; I looked
all over the house</b>
<br><b>figuring she ran to hide or something but she wasnt there.&nbsp;
When I told</b>
<br><b>me wife about this that night she said it must be that the sound
went</b>
<br><b>off by itself.&nbsp; I could accept this except that I heard the
sound of the</b>
<br><b>head being lifted off first then the sound came then I heard the
head</b>
<br><b>being put back down.&nbsp; While I worked graveyard many was the
time when my</b>
<br><b>wife would call me scared to death because of crashing noises she
heard</b>
<br><b>in the basement. Things came up missing and re appeared after days
in</b>
<br><b>places impossible to miss.</b><b></b>
<p><b>We finally moved soon after buying a house in downtown Portland.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>wife waited until we had moved to tell me one last story shed been</b>
<br><b>saving as not to upset me further.&nbsp; On more than one night
she had seen</b>
<br><b>an old man visit the graveyard next door.&nbsp; He wore an old leather
hat</b>
<br><b>and had on old clothes similar to those worn in the pioneering days.
He</b>
<br><b>carried an old leather pouch and would just stand there in the graveyard</b>
<br><b>staring at our house.&nbsp; When he would leave he would walk down
the middle</b>
<br><b>of the street.&nbsp; My wife got in the car to follow him but around
the</b>
<br><b>corner he vanished.&nbsp; He always came but you never saw him coming.&nbsp;
He</b>
<br><b>was always just there.&nbsp; After a while she stopped looking.&nbsp;
Afraid of</b>
<br><b>his blank stare.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;It was almost like whatever lived in that house knew we were
getting</b>
<br><b>ready to leave. Well thats it.&nbsp; Hard to believe until something
like</b>
<br><b>this happens to yourself.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>My Ghost Experiences</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Hetfieldfan@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When i was 9 years old i had my first paranormal experience,&nbsp;
after about 3</b>
<br><b>years of living in a brand new house,&nbsp; and about 6 months after
of my sisters</b>
<br><b>and I messed around with an Ouija board,&nbsp; i woke up one night
at about 2 am</b>
<br><b>in the air totally levitated off my bed,&nbsp; i felt 2 hands grab
me, then slam</b>
<br><b>me down on the bed,&nbsp; i really thought nothing of it, i thought
it could be a</b>
<br><b>dream,&nbsp; but i did sleep in my parents room after it happened.
After that&nbsp; i</b>
<br><b>would ask my mom if our house was haunted,&nbsp; she would always
say,&nbsp; a new</b>
<br><b>house can't be haunted.</b>
<br><b>A few months after that my 2nd oldest sister would complain of hearing
her</b>
<br><b>name being called.</b>
<br><b>About 4 years later, my parents divorced, and i went to live in
an apartment</b>
<br><b>complex with my dad. About after 4 months of living there,&nbsp;
i woke up one</b>
<br><b>night, saw my closet door open, and a image of a man walking out,&nbsp;
then the</b>
<br><b>image faded away, i was so scared, then more came,&nbsp; voices,&nbsp;
i would hear gun</b>
<br><b>shots late at night,&nbsp; but my dad would not hear them.</b>
<br><b>1year after that,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we moved to a 60 year old cottage
house, the house i am</b>
<br><b>currently living in as i speak.&nbsp; My first experiences where
shadows of people</b>
<br><b>going along the walls,&nbsp; and yes i was very scared.&nbsp; About
a couple weeks</b>
<br><b>later, my dad and i where fighting in the family room,&nbsp; then
the ceiling fan</b>
<br><b>just cut on,&nbsp; at the point of anger i was in,&nbsp; i was not
scared.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After</b>
<br><b>about 4 months of those experiences,&nbsp; more came,&nbsp;&nbsp;
knocks on the walls, more</b>
<br><b>voices. Around that time i developed an anxiety disorder from all
the fear i</b>
<br><b>was going through, and went to a christian councilor. Then after
it got</b>
<br><b>worst,&nbsp; glasses falling of tables,&nbsp; loud noises at night,
she came by to</b>
<br><b>command the sprits out of the house,&nbsp; for the next 2 weeks&nbsp;
nothing happened,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;but now on this day Mar. 16, 2000, we are hearing the noises
again at night,</b>
<br><b>but lucky enough,&nbsp; i have been taught how to ignore and not
be in fear of</b>
<br><b>these things that are going on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the end of April,&nbsp;
we will be moving</b>
<br><b>into a brand new house again, i guess we will have to see what happens.</b>

<p><b>My husband was sitting at the dining room table one morning about
6</b>
<br><b>months ago.&nbsp; Now my husband does not believe aat all in the
paranormal.</b>
<br><b>He noticed the cat staring up at something at the stairway going
down to</b>
<br><b>the basement.&nbsp; He looked down to pick up his coffee cup, looked
up , and</b>
<br><b>saw an older woman dressed in old fashioned clothing standing at
the the</b>
<br><b>entrance of the stairs.&nbsp; She was motioning with her hand as
if</b>
<br><b>indicating him to go down stairs.&nbsp; Needless to say it scared
the life</b>
<br><b>out of him, the non-believer.&nbsp; I got up shortly after this
and found him</b>
<br><b>white as a ghost.&nbsp; It's the first time he's ever admited to
seeing&nbsp; a</b>
<br><b>ghost.&nbsp; Our house has many strange happenings.&nbsp; A couple
was living in</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Our ghost HENRY</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b>by:&nbsp; kdcab61@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My husband has been cleaning this church for three years and he as
well as</b>
<br><b>the rest of our family has expierienced some very strange things,
so has at</b>
<br><b>least one other member of the church. First it was just a feeling
of a</b>
<br><b>presence that you just couldn't shake, a glimpse of a shadow from
the corner</b>
<br><b>of your eye, and the occasional sound that could not be explained.
My</b>
<br><b>husband worked&nbsp; his regular job from 4:00pm to 1:30 am and
would go to the</b>
<br><b>church after leaving his job and that was when he would experience
most of</b>
<br><b>the things. Then it didn't seem to matter what time of day it was
and it</b>
<br><b>even started happening when the kid's would be there helping, our
two boy's</b>
<br><b>are now 9 and 12 and we never said anyhting to them for fear of
scaring</b>
<br><b>them and then they were in an upstairs room were my husband was
cleaning and</b>
<br><b>suddenly the piano started playing one note over and over for a
minute or so</b>
<br><b>and then it stopped. The boy's were very frightened but also very
intriuged</b>
<br><b>by the whole thing. I have been a victim of HENRY as we affectionatly
call</b>
<br><b>him now, I have heard many things,&nbsp; little bumps and unexplainable
noises.</b>
<br><b>Our 19 year old son took over the cleaning job for about six months
this</b>
<br><b>past summer and he has also heard many things like foorsteps in
front of</b>
<br><b>him, doors on other floors slamming when there is no one else in
the church,</b>
<br><b>he also went to clean in the middle of the night, mainly because
it it</b>
<br><b>easier to do when no one is there to get in the way, or so we thought!
When</b>
<br><b>my husband took the job back over it wasn't very long before he
would start</b>
<br><b>experiencing HENRY again, oh did I mention that he would always
seem to find</b>
<br><b>dimes laying in the oddest places sometime as many as two dollars
worth in a</b>
<br><b>few hours of cleaning, never finding them in places where people
would</b>
<br><b>frequent in the building.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We never felt we needed to fear HENRY since his
presence never seemed to</b>
<br><b>be a threatening experience, but there was a woman who has been
a long time</b>
<br><b>member of the church and she was there one day by herself doing
the books</b>
<br><b>when she had heard moaning to the point of causing her to call the
police</b>
<br><b>because she really felt that someone was there, my husband had arrived
while</b>
<br><b>the police were in the building, they had asked the woman to wait
outside in</b>
<br><b>case they found someone but needless to say there was no one to
be found</b>
<br><b>they kind of humored the woman but my husabnd told her of his experiences</b>
<br><b>and she said that this wasn't the first time that things have happened
to</b>
<br><b>her there either. The most disturbing thing was when he was in the
boiler</b>
<br><b>room cleaning some mops before he left and me and my 2 son's were
out side</b>
<br><b>warming the car and suddenly he came running to the car with a horrified</b>
<br><b>look on his face and shaking tremendously, I could tell something
was</b>
<br><b>terribly wrong but he didn't want to frighten the boy's so he waited
to tell</b>
<br><b>me, after we were able to be alone he had revealed to me that he
actually</b>
<br><b>saw to men walking down some stairs in the back of the boiler room
talking</b>
<br><b>to each other as if he wasn't there at all, they were dressed in
the style</b>
<br><b>of the 20's and seemed to be almost floating down the steps, there
is no way</b>
<br><b>to enter the room from that door since it is locked very securely.
We have</b>
<br><b>had many of the people we have told these things to try to explain
them away</b>
<br><b>but there is no human explaination for these things. There have
been times</b>
<br><b>when we have went there and left only after a few minutes because
there is a</b>
<br><b>sense of something just not being right. I come from a family that
my mother</b>
<br><b>and sister have always had experiences similar to this in thier
lives&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>have also had times were I know the other side is present in my
life.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>four year old nephew had come with us one day and the children were
all</b>
<br><b>playing in the preschool room for about an hour the neaxt time we
took my</b>
<br><b>nephew, which was only the second time he had ever been there with
us</b>
<br><b>cleaning, they were in the gym playing and he came out in the hall
and asked</b>
<br><b>me where the big fella was at, I was shocked that he would say that
since</b>
<br><b>the only people there on both trips he had made with us was US.
I didn't</b>
<br><b>want to frighten him so I just said what big fella would that be
he responed</b>
<br><b>you know the big fella that was here the last time we were here
playing.</b>
<br><b>Well I feel that this is really all that needs to be said to explain
just</b>
<br><b>who or what is there in this church, a child that doesn't know what&nbsp;
we have</b>
<br><b>all experienced can hardly imagine the same thing if it isn't so.</b>

<p><b>By: STARBOARD1@prodigy.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is my second time writing this site.&nbsp; I come here offen
to read the articles and stories they interest me alot even.&nbsp; I am
a very religious person but have an interest in the paranormal, im 18 and
attend highschoo.&nbsp; Well anyway down to my story.&nbsp; I have lived
in our house for only 2 years now and it is a brand new manufactured home
so we are the first owners.&nbsp; We live in a new section of a trailer
park in Michigan.&nbsp; This section is in the rear of the park and is
surrounded by thick woods and not far down the streets is were an old Indian
tribe used to live before their relocation..im not to sure on what tribe
they were.&nbsp; Well anyway I really dont have to much of reason to feel</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;uncomfortible in this new house seeing how were the first
owners, well once and awhile I have theses strange feelings, sometimes
a dread of having to close my eyes in certain spots of the house.&nbsp;
My room is in the front of the house and my brothers room is right acrossed
form mine, well sometimes late at night when im asleep I will hear a loud
bang that sounds like its coming form inside my wall and the trailer stands
on some blocks which makes it kinda high and the pounding was more at the
top of my wall so it would make it diffacult for someone</b>
<br><b>outside even a tall man to hit it with the force it does and it
does not sound like anything hitting it like a rock or something because
it sounds more like a open hand striking the wall with a palm.&nbsp; Well
it will happen every couple months and then sometimes 2 aweek..always lound
enough to wake me up and sometimes happens when im wide awake, I know im
not crazy because others have heard it to. And the pounding is allways
in the same spot on the same wall except for once it happen right above
my headboard of my bed, I ususally just ignore the sound</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;and go back to sleep not really wanting to know what it was
at the exact time.&nbsp; My girlfriend is also terrified of having to stay
in my room alone while I take a shower or something always having me leave
the door open or something.&nbsp; Another time around may of last year
I was laying in the den that faces our living room, I had just got home
from school and decied to lay on the couch in the den to read and listen
to my head phones while waiting for my girlfriend to arrive.&nbsp; Well
im pretty sure most of the people reading this can see things</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;out of the corner of thier eyes well i was reading my book
when out of the corner of my eye I seen a shadow moving pretty fast and
jump acouple feet and then continue to run past the door, I jumped up and
threw my headphones off and ran to investigate looking around and seeing
nothing, I told my girlfiend when she got thier which made her even more
frightend to be there alone.&nbsp; Well there hasent been much</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;activity for awhile but I always have a bad feeling about
a certain corner of my room which is right next to my closet..I always
feel if as im being watched while i sleep.&nbsp; Well I just wanted to
share this story with some of you who will beleave me and not call me crazy
and maybe reveal some light on whats going on in my house.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Outside, of Southern, Columbus, Ohio, There is a small, town called,
Georgesville, Ohio, We bought a home,there, that hadbeen remodled, the
orignal,home,was added on to, and orignal was a log cabin, of Civil War,
days, and owned by a major,from Civil War days, also,from day one, that
we moved in this home, we started hearing, and seeing things,We always
had a bad smell, that lingered, no matter, how much we cleaned. In the
basement, of new part, we had a pool table,at night, you could hear,the
pool balls, being struck, and knocked, into the pockets, of the pool table,
We had Three, small, children, who, would not sleep in their rooms, saying,
their beds, rocked, and moved, and they were lifted up, and turned around,
by someone, they could not see, in midair, above, their beds, We had a
big, old, pinao, it would wake you up, playing, by itself, also, around,
midnight, a couple, times a week, you could be in bed, asleep, in the Winter,
even, with storm windows in, and windows closed, a loud sound, of breathing,
like a huge, animal, that had ran a long way, would run by these bedroom
windows, and it was so loud, it sounded as if it were in the bedroom, with
you, exhaling and inhaling, deep, and raspey, sounds, and a hard, running,
sound, There was deep snow, and drifts, piled under, the outside windows,
but, when we went outside, to look, right, after hearing, this pass our
windows, there was never nothing there, And, " No Prints," of any kind,</b>
<br><b>in the snow, at all. We sold this house, and moved, to Northern,
Ohio.&nbsp; I do not want my email address, gave out, and I will sign this
simply, "A Person, who believes, in things, that cannot be explained, from
Ohio".</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Since I was 10 or 11, I have had experiences with ghosts, with one
friend in</b>
<br><b>particular. It all started at the mall, when me and a few friends
snuck up to</b>
<br><b>an unopened museum part above a store. We were sneaking around when
we</b>
<br><b>noticed a set of unfinished stairs. For some reason I wanted to
climb down</b>
<br><b>the frame of the stairs. Thats when I saw him for the first time.
He was a</b>
<br><b>shadowy figure who was wearing a hat. He started to walk up the
stairway, but</b>
<br><b>he wasn't walking on anything.&nbsp; My friends and I ran, screaming,
and we</b>
<br><b>pushed frantically at the elevator buttons. It wasn't coming. The
ghost</b>
<br><b>disappeared, and the elevator button lit up.&nbsp; My friends and
I, all except my</b>
<br><b>one friend (in a very long deal with some money disappearing, who
later this</b>
<br><b>will play a crucial role in these experiences) gathered in an empty
area of</b>
<br><b>the playground to talk.&nbsp; I saw things, and was almost positive
my friends</b>
<br><b>were faking it.&nbsp; I was the one to see something, and they just
agreed about</b>
<br><b>it. About 3 years passed, with nothing said about our experiences.
One day, I</b>
<br><b>got the phone number of the friend that supposedly "stole my money."
I didn't</b>
<br><b>believe it.&nbsp; When we first talked, we immediately clicked.
We became the best</b>
<br><b>of friends.&nbsp; About a month passed, and we occupied our time
talking about</b>
<br><b>boys and trying on new make-up.&nbsp; It all started one day, when
we were sitting</b>
<br><b>outside on my picnic table, looking up at the sky and the moon in
the</b>
<br><b>daylight.&nbsp; I had a picture in my head all of a sudden, we had
to go to a park</b>
<br><b>with two dogs. My friend broke the top of her foot at the time,
and was</b>
<br><b>trying her hardest to keep up with my frantic speed.&nbsp; When
we finally reached</b>
<br><b>the park, the dogs, I noticed, were gone. I looked at the unusual
sunset, and</b>
<br><b>in a rush, it came to us. There was "fire in the sky" as we call
it. Then, we</b>
<br><b>thought of the elements. Fire, Water, Earth, Air. I'm a Pisces,
obsessed with</b>
<br><b>water. I must represent Water, I thought.&nbsp; But what about Megan
(my friend)?</b>
<br><b>This was her first time at the park. The sunset! It had never happened</b>
<br><b>before. She must be fire. She is on the Cusp of Cancer and Leo,
on the last</b>
<br><b>possible day of being a cancer. Leo is a fire sign, and with her
fiery</b>
<br><b>personality, she fits the description perfectly. People are drawn
to her</b>
<br><b>light, it seems. Crows began to circle around us. It wasn't till
the next</b>
<br><b>time when we saw the dog, a black lab-type dog. It stared at us,
with glowing</b>
<br><b>eyes, and then disappeared. A similar experience happen with a cat.
there are</b>
<br><b>many other feelings we've had, these are just a few. It seems me
and my</b>
<br><b>friend had become closer, since now we have a sort of Karmic bond.&nbsp;
This is</b>
<br><b>the summary of my earlier experiences, but there is much more detail
that I</b>
<br><b>can't take the time right now to write. I would appreciate any help
or</b>
<br><b>support, and if you would like to know more, Email at</b>
<br><b>Cometothelight13@aol.com&nbsp; or&nbsp; Kluvcow@aol.com. I would
appreciate any</b>
<br><b>information regarding this type of spirit. Thank you for your time,
and Have</b>
<br><b>a nice day.</b><b></b>
