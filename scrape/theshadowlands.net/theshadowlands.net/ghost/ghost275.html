<P><B>Aiken SC</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jlynes@jacklynes.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Aiken SC&nbsp; East Pine Log Road, now houses "Rileys Whitby Bull</B>
<BR><B>Restaurant."</B>
<BR><B>This house was in my wife's family from the late 1960's until it
was</B>
<BR><B>sold to the present owners, operators of the named restaurant.&nbsp;
My</B>
<BR><B>family and I moved there in 1993 and lived in the house for 2 years</B>
<BR><B>after we moved back here from Atlanta.&nbsp; This house was built
in the late</B>
<BR><B>1800's (estimated from the style) and was remodeled in 1914, when
indoor</B>
<BR><B>plumbing was installed and this date appears on the tax records
(which</B>
<BR><B>would be correct... they use the latest remodeling date for 'effective</B>
<BR><B>date').&nbsp; Archeaologists from the SC state highway department
visited the</B>
<BR><B>site in the winter of 1994 when the road in front was being surveyed
for</B>
<BR><B>widening.&nbsp; I took them under the house and they showed me where
kerf</B>
<BR><B>marks in the big supporting beams evidenced that the original part
of</B>
<BR><B>the house was either built before the War Between the States or
wood</B>
<BR><B>from that era was recycled into this house.&nbsp; In any event,
the house is</B>
<BR><B>an old, large, rambling affair of an old southern home that, like
I</B>
<BR><B>said, is now a restaurant. It is unusual in that it is in the Second</B>
<BR><B>Empire style, with a Mansard roof, and a large wrap around porch
with</B>
<BR><B>doric columns.</B>
<BR><B>On to the story:</B>
<BR><B>We frequently heard footsteps when no one was there, and had strange</B>
<BR><B>feelings that we were not alone.&nbsp; I could be in the front room,
which I</B>
<BR><B>used as an office, and hear someone come down the stairs and stand
at</B>
<BR><B>the large open pocket doors.&nbsp; When I turned from my computer,
no one</B>
<BR><B>would be there.&nbsp; I got used to that.&nbsp; One day I was relaxing
in the</B>
<BR><B>upstairs bathroom in the old 6' long iron bathtub.&nbsp; It was
the middle of</B>
<BR><B>the day.&nbsp; I had some time to relax; my wife was away, the kids
were in</B>
<BR><B>school, I had no pressing work. So I took a mid-day soaking bath.&nbsp;
I was</B>
<BR><B>lying quietly in the hot sudsy water with water up to my neck, stretched</B>
<BR><B>out with a washcloth across my face.&nbsp; I heard someone coming
down the</B>
<BR><B>hall.&nbsp; I slid the washcloth away, opened my eyes and listened
carefully,</B>
<BR><B>because I knew I was alone.&nbsp; The footsteps came slowly down
the hall,</B>
<BR><B>toward the bathroom door which was at the end of the hall.&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>footfalls stopped at the door, and the old porcelain doorknob moved</B>
<BR><B>slightly like someone had it in their grip, then started to turn
slowly</B>
<BR><B>in its big square lock housing.&nbsp; It was right near me, because
the head</B>
<BR><B>end of the tub was by the door.&nbsp; I watched it over my left
shoulder and</B>
<BR><B>then spoke:&nbsp; "Mary Ann?"&nbsp; The turning stopped.&nbsp; I
jumped up in a torrent</B>
<BR><B>of steamy water and snatched the door open, and .... there was no
one</B>
<BR><B>there.&nbsp; No one down the hall, no sounds of anyone running or
jumping</B>
<BR><B>down the stairs.&nbsp; Just the sounds of dripping bathwater.&nbsp;
I grabbed a</B>
<BR><B>towel and ran down the hall, down the big hallway stairs, and jumped
to</B>
<BR><B>the landing.&nbsp; The front door was closed and locked.&nbsp; I
could see down</B>
<BR><B>the hall to the old victorian carved door leading out to the back</B>
<BR><B>porch.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; I sprinted to the kitchen.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp;
I looked out the</B>
<BR><B>windows onto the side drive and the circular drive out front.&nbsp;
No car,</B>
<BR><B>no nothing.&nbsp; Doors were locked. There was no sign of anything
out of the</B>
<BR><B>ordinary.&nbsp; I searched from room to room and found nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I never</B>
<BR><B>said anything that might spook the family, but nobody like to be
in the</B>
<BR><B>house alone anyway.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Funny thing is, now that we live in a modern house (built 1973) across</B>
<BR><B>the cotton field from 801 East Pine Log, we still hear noises and</B>
<BR><B>footfalls when no one else is in the house.&nbsp; I have sensed
a presence</B>
<BR><B>more than once, and a teenage friend of the family told us that
he saw a</B>
<BR><B>kind looking old man one night, dressed in white, standing in our</B>
<BR><B>foyer.&nbsp; It was late at night, and Tyler was in the library,
and from</B>
<BR><B>where he was sitting he could see out into the foyer.&nbsp; The
man in white</B>
<BR><B>looked at him, smiled and nodded, and turning, went down the hall.&nbsp;
He</B>
<BR><B>said it was really interesting but not too scary.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Who was there?</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: RuthEllen120@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My granparents died when I was 4 and we moved into their house. They
were the</B>
<BR><B>only people who ever lived in it. I ened up getting their room.
When I was in</B>
<BR><B>5th grade I started experiencing things in my room. My tv would
go on and off</B>
<BR><B>whenever I would think that I need to turn it on or off. I had to
sleep with</B>
<BR><B>the hall light on. On night I thought I saw my mom im my room standing
by my</B>
<BR><B>closet. When I turned my light on she wasn't there. Then I thought
I saw my dad</B>
<BR><B>standing in the same spot but that time I kept looking at him as
I went into</B>
<BR><B>the hallway to see if he was still sleeping on the couch and he
was. I was</B>
<BR><B>looking at him in the living room and my room and when I turned
my light on he</B>
<BR><B>wsn't there but still on the couch. It always felt like some one
was watching</B>
<BR><B>me. Then my last experience of seeing something was in the same
spot but just a</B>
<BR><B>head looking at me. He looked like he ws from the 1700's. When&nbsp;
I tried to</B>
<BR><B>tell my mom she wouldn't believe me. I'd wake up at night not being
able to</B>
<BR><B>breath and my sister would run in. Then my mom started to believe
me when she'd</B>
<BR><B>hear heavy breathing in her room when it was just her in there.
I'd be walking</B>
<BR><B>and it feel like some one was trying to trip me. So I told my mom's
mom and she</B>
<BR><B>gave me a cross to hang in my room. When I put it up I didn't see
anything</B>
<BR><B>after that but it always felt like I wasn't alone in my room. Now
years later I</B>
<BR><B>found out that the guy stairing at me from the 1700's looked just
like a</B>
<BR><B>picture in our living room. He was an old relative. When I still
go by the house it</B>
<BR><B>still feels like somethings evil there but at our new house it feels
like a</B>
<BR><B>house should. Now that I'm 21 I think that it was my dad's parents
still in</B>
<BR><B>their room that I had. That's the only reason.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>White Phenomena</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: lfields38@cox-internet.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This happened to my mom and my cousin:</B>
<BR><B>When my mom was a teenager, she and my cousin were on a paper route
on Buck Mountain. It was very dark. Mom said there had been some really
eerie places on the road, but nothing really happened on them. Then they
came to a place in the road where there were no houses on either side of
the road. They both saw It at the same time. It was tall and white, and
it came from the right side of the road, out of nowhere-It just appeared.
They had the windows of the truck rolled down (remember, they were throwing
papers), and Mom just barely rolled up her window when It passed right
through the middle of the vehicle, went out the other side, and dissapeared
into the woods. They said It was making a strange moaning sound. But It
didn't try to hurt them. Just passed through and dissapeared. Mom's still
not sure if It was a ghost, or what. But I call It a White Phenomena.</B>

<BR><B>Whiskey Hollow</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: cj123167cj@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Description of Haunting: i was reading of whiskey hollow on this
web site,and went there for my own investigation with some friends,and
cameras and recording equipment.first of all,the road which the subscriber
of the location says is about 5 miles long is incorrect.it is only about
a mile and a half long dirt road which connects 2 other roads.there are
natural springs there,which alot of local people get water from.we traveled
for hours down and back and forth every road in the whiskey hollow area.the
only thing we did find that was odd is this. something caught the corner
of my eye when we were driving down the said dirt road.when i stopped i
noticed 2 domestic rabbits.one was a lop eared furry grey bunny,the other
was a black and white mix.(it is now about 1:30 am)so i pulled over the
vehicle,and started taking pictures of the rabbits,thinking to myself and
my friends,it is kind of strange to have 2 domestic rabbits out here in
the middle of nowhere.but we figured they could have been strays who ran
off from a house a couple miles down the road.and didnt think anything
else of it.the rabbits were very tame,they let me pet them,pick them up,and
i even put one in my vehicle thinking it would surely die out there.but
i started thinking about it and decided to leave the rabbits there with
each other.</B>
<BR><B>then i hear this strange screech come out of the woods directly
next to my side. so i stand up and shine my flashlight into the woods,and
see nothing.1 of my friends heard it also,but the other didnt.so i start
walking back to my truck and notice this tiny baby maple tree about 16
inches tall moving around. and i look down right where i had been standing
playing with the rabbits,and walking all around i look at that little tree,and
see an conure parrot looking up at me.so i call to my friends to get the
camera,and shine their lights over here. and sure enough here in the middle
of nowhere sits,a $1,000 bird,friendly as can be,i bent down and picked
him up,and he just sat on my hand looking at me.now i guess what im wondering
is this.the rabbits i can discredit,and say they were strays who ran away
from a near by farm,and could live.but this parrot had clipped wings,couldnt
even get enough lift out of his wings to keep his balance,or climb up any
higher on my arm.how did he get way out there? there was no way a bird
like that walked over a mile to get where he was.and what was he doing
right there with the rabbits? they were all together in a little group,as
if they were all pets of the same person,or people.</B>
<BR><B>i thought of taking the bird and both rabbits at that point thinking
somethings wrong here,and how and why is this expensive bird out here in
the middle of nowhere,along with 2 domestic rabbits,all together like they
were friends.so i did that and got about 20 yards down the road,and i dont
know why but thought i should leave all the animals right where they were.and
just go homw and right it off as a wasted night. so i turn around,go back
to where the rabbits and bird were.and take them out of my truck,and put
them exactly where they were.and they all went right back to the same exact
spot where i found them,right by that little maple tree.so i figured i
really need pictures of this one,no one will believe we seen this out here.
and i took 2 pictures of the rabbits,and then 3 of the bird.and for some
reason the camera,kept turning off,like the batteries were dead.but they
wernt,i always make sure theyre brand new so i dont get stuck with a dead
camera.i went to take another pic of the bird,and my camera just shut off,didnt
take the picture,didnt do anything.just shut itself off.</B>
<BR><B>so i turn to get back into my truck and see a beer bottle on the
ground,right on the side of the road,which was not there the entire time
i was playing with the rabbits and bird.so thinking i just didnt see it
before,i picked it up and tossed it to the side of the woods so it wouldnt
get ran over .and when i picked it up,it was cold,like it just came out
of the cooler,and it was wet like it was sweating from the heat and cold.</B>
<BR><B>legend has it as i have heard this area and road, many ,many years
ago was used by satanic worshipers,and k k k members,where they used to
sacrafice children.hard to believe in my book,but thats the legend.supposedly
there is a bloody blanket,you see on the side of the road,and some have
said to have seen children standing on the side of the road.we traveled
every inch of every road in whiskey hollow and thats not what we found,maybe
we wernt there on a good night,or maybe those animals in the middle of
nowhere were a sign. maybe those domestic animals were out in the middle
of nowhere for the children who were supposedly murdered years ago? tell
me how,or why a parrot with perfectly clipped wings,and friendly,like a
good pet is,and 2 domestic rabbits,all in great health,and aparently not
a care in the world,happy as can be, are doing out there?and why did they
stay right there by that tree together?kind of a strange combo of friends
huh? almost like a disney movie.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Car Crash</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:tiger_power2007@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A long time ago about 20 years
or so, there was a car crash in front of my drive way (at the time I did
not live there, at that matter nobody did) in the car there were six young
boys ages ranging from 6-20. They crashed because there were a couple of
drunk drivers who hit them head on. All the young men died in the car.
about 10 years later I and my family moved a double wide on the lot in
front of where the men died. about one year later ther was an aweful car
crash at the exact same spot of where the young men died. The woman was
not killed but she was seriously injured. after a couple of years I went
down to get the mail, when I heard a strange noise, like a young boy crying.
I was the only on ehome at the time. I looked around and seen nobody. The
crying became fainter and fainter until I could hear no more. The next
day I went back down to check the mail and I heard talking two men about
18 years of age. I looked around and saw nobody. I listened to the conversation
I could not make out anything they were saying but I could here the voices
as clear as day. Soon after the voices began to faint away. I talked to
my grandmother who lives just up the road. She told me that the accident
happened about 20 years ago and everyone in the car were killed. i asked
her what time it was they wreckeed. she said it was about 5-10 pm. Around
7 pm is when the young woman wrecked her car. A few years after the woman
wrecked her car. Another woman broke down on the bridge several feet away
from where the young men crashed. Another time a couple were driving with
a full tank of gas when all of a sudden thier gas tank just went empty
right where everything was happening. There were several more break downs
and acciddents that have happened over the years where the young men crashed
and more of my family members have heard strange talking and crying below
our drive way. after time we have moved and still there have been breakdowns
and accidents at that same location. We think that the bridge and the area
around it is haunted by the ghosts of the 6 young men.</B>

<BR><B>Same Dream</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: spahlmann@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I thoroughly love this site. I have been reading these stories for
a week now.&nbsp; I want to post something that happened to my mother,
Marie, my uncle ( her brother) David, and my aunt (her sister) Gayle.&nbsp;
A little background first please.&nbsp; Marie was living in Arkansas, David
was living in Florida, and Gayle was living in South Carolina. Many miles
apart these 3 siblings shared the same dream on the same night and called
their mother within 24 hours of the dream to tell her of it.&nbsp; This
dream occurred in 1989.&nbsp; The dream starts with the 3 siblings visiting
an old farm house they lived in as children 30 years ago with their other
siblings and parents.&nbsp; The house was empty.&nbsp; Marie, David, and
Gayle all got out of the car and walked completely around the house, recalling
climbing an old oak tree that held the tire swing, recalling the farm area
and what used to stand there, etc.&nbsp; When the 3 returned to the front
of the house, there on the steps sat their dear old Dad. (Dad passed away
in April of 1974) Shocked to see their father on the steps they called
out to him. Dad stood and looked at the three with a malevolent grin.&nbsp;
He motioned for his kids to follow him into the house. They followed through
the living room, past the kitchen, down the hall, until they reached their
parents old room. He turned and looked each one in the eye and put his
fingers to his lips as if to say “SHHHH”, he then motioned with his hand
for them to follow.&nbsp; He opened the bedroom door and they followed
him inside.&nbsp; He walked to the closet and walked through the closet
door.&nbsp; Now in each person’s dream they were the ones about to open
the door. As each reached for the doorknob and slowly started turning the
knob, their mother appeared from nowhere SCREAMING at them to not open
that door. They instantly woke up from the dream.&nbsp; I was a teenager
at the time this occurred and I did not see the big deal about following
their dad into the closet until we visited my grandmother.&nbsp; My grandmother
was telling my mother of how David and Gayle both called her after Marie
did saying they had the same exact dream as she had.&nbsp; My mom looked
scared and my grandmother told her they all needed to get into church because
Satan himself was using their father’s image to lure them into some evil
doings. I asked dear old granny how she got that from a dream and grandpa
going into a closet. She told me because her husband, their father, my
granddad was SCARED of closets. I thought she meant he was claustrophobic.
She assured me he was TERRIFIED of closets. The whole time they were man
and wife, she would have to get his clothing out of the closets and lay
them out for him.&nbsp; She would have to put things into closets. He refused
to open them or go into them.&nbsp; My grandmother believes that Satan
used granddad’s image to lure the 3 siblings down a path of evil.&nbsp;
I know this is not much, but I love to hear the story.</B>

<P><B>No One in the Basement</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: X143MaDLuV143x@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Within my years I have had many many ghostly experiences. But the
most recent experiences seem to scare me the most. Almost everynight sitting
in the downstairs of my home.. i feel a strong presence..each time at a
different location within the dining room and the living room.first, you
may want to know how my dining room and living room are set in my house..
when you first walk into my home u enter a little narrow hallway where
you then have to go through another door to get into my living room, then
to get to my dining room we have a huge opening . and theres my dining
room and my steps to go to the second story in my home.. The other night
i was sitting on my couch closest to the two living room windows, but something
just kept telling me to look over at the window in the dining room, sure
enough i saw a black mist that looked as if a face was watching me but
then it disappeared... i passed it off as if it were nothing and that I
was seeing things because it was around 11:30 PM and i was quite tired.
Then my eyes kept gazing toward the window closest to me.. for some odd
reason my shades were semi open for 5 blades and then the rest were closed
so no one could see.. i then moved my brother to the other couch and we
sat together and i just could not keep my eyes off the window and the hallway
entrance.. within a hour later i was finally getting comfortable, my brother
was sleeping, my mother and stepfather were sleeping and my older brother
was home upstairs with his car parked outside. I gazed at the window and
the black mist was back, but this time it was more clear and bigger, it
seemed more like a body and face but turned to gaze out my window, then
it sounded like someone was trying to open my front door, its a big steel
door and when its locked and somebody trys to open it, it sounds as if
someone is pushing against it, it happened at least 6 times before it stopped,
i held my little brother closer to me, within the next fifteen minutes
it sounded like someone was walking in the hallway and jingling keys, well
that was enough for me i woke my brother up and sent him into my room because
i had my air conditioner on in my room, but the jingling sound seemed to
follow us to right outside my bedroom door, then stopped for the night.my
mother recently saw the mist and told it to go back to where ever it came
from, it then seemed to glide to my basement door and disappear. My home
is about 150 years old and back then people couldnt afford to have a proper
funeral, so they buried people in the walls in the basement or in the floor.
We recently had a dirt basement floor and a cobblestone wall, but we had
the floor cemented over. My grandmother whom i can safely say is a ghost
expert, sences something in the walls in my basement. Around my house but
mainly in my room. I know for a fact there is a ghost in my room but shes
a sweet woman and she just seems to watch me until i fall asleep. There
are several ghosts in my home, but recently i feel as if more are residing
here. Just the other night i was drifting to sleep in my room and i heard
the sound as if someone were breathing, i held my breathe and the sound
was still there so i turned the tv on an it seemed to just go away, i was
scared and looked toward the mirror and i saw a flash and then nothin happened,
but i saw the woman and felt comfort, i feel as if she scared the other
thing/spirit away.At my grandmothers house there is a attic but its hidden
in the ceiling and u have to pull steps down, during the war at her home,
soldiers were hid in the attic and rumor hasit one night the other people
found them and killed everyone in the home, but the one young nurse wsa
raped and then&nbsp; murdered. I had a dream once about a place whre theres
a dangling light and u have to walk on beams and then open a door and theres
a little room with blood stains and a african american man on his needs
bleeding. I told my grandmother and she said i described her attic exactly
even though i had never been in the attic. The woman whom was raped and
murdered was a beautiful woman and she is often spotted around my grandmothers
house scrubbing floors and walking, my grandmoms house wsa remodeled after
the war and the woman comes down the steps and walks straight turns and
goes out a door, which is now a window, but before there was a wall seperating
the rooms and a seperate door. Recently my grandmom has seen a little boy
petting her dogs saying come on doggy come with me, she thought it was
my little brother because he has spent the night, but he was downstairs
sleeping and no one else in the house was awake, she knows hes a ghost
and she is comfortable with him, although i am severly frightened of her
basement which in 1947 a man was found hanging with a grin on his face
and a woman shot in the head underneath him,, there was children found
suffocated in their beds. My grandmom says the boy was one of the children
found and the man is evil, she feels that he may harm me and she doesnt
like anyone except for her in her basement.</B>
<BR><B>Well i have many more stories to tell you but im sorry im out of
time, i wil contact you later with many more stories, thank you, feel free
to email me any ?? or if you just want to exchange experiences, thank you</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Life of Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: GraceG81@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I think I was about seven when I first started seeing things in my
house and around my neighborhood. The first time I saw something was when
my sister and i were sharing a room. I knew that i had always felt something
in the room,but i never saw anything so I really paid it no mind. Then
one day while i was sitting in my room i looked up and i saw a image by
my door. i don't know exactly what it was but i know that i was scared.
Over the next couple of days i would hear things in my room, like people
walking, the door knob would wiggle, and things would just tip over. When
i talked to my mom about these things she told me not to be scared of them
just to tell them to go away. The next night i was sitting on my bed and
i heard somebody walking around. I did what my mom told me to and told
it to go away. It didn't work. The sound became closer and an image bagan
to appear. At first i was kind of scared but when i saw what the image
was i wasn't so scared anymore. It was a little girl about five years old
who was lost. She was just staring at me for a while and then she just
sat down on the bed next to me. She was sitting next to me for about two
minutes and then she was just gone.</B>
<BR><B>For a few years i wouldn't see anything, just hear things. When
my oldest sister moved out, my sister and i finally had our own rooms.
I satyed in our original room and my sister moved to my other sisters'
old room. For a couple of months things were cool and then my sister woke
up in the middle of the night and asked if she could sleep with me. The
next morning when i asked her why she slept with me, she told me it was
because she was hearing people talking from the closet. Me and her had
to switch rooms because she wouldn't sleep in her room. The first night
nothing happened but the second night was different. I was hearing whispering
and footsteps, at first i thought i was scaring myself but when i heard
someone ask why my sister and i switched rooms, i knew i wasn't imaging
it. At first everyone thought iwas making it up,but when i told my grandma
about she look at me as if she were surprised. She told me that i wasn't
the only one in the family to be able to hear and see things. It was something
that actually ran in my family. After that things started happening more.
People would talk to me, i would feel them touch my arm,face or feet when
i was sleeping, and sometimes i could feel someone sitting at the end of
my bed. I think when i really got scared was when i decided to sleep with
my light on so nothing would bother me, but when someone said "turn the
light off" that was it. I ran to my moms room and fell asleep on the edge
of her bed. That was the last time anything happened to me for about a
year. I thought it was just something i went through but when i turned
fourteen it got bad. Not only was i seeing things at home but i was seeing
them outside, and in school. I learned not to say anything cause when i
would people would just laugh at me.</B>

<BR><B>My Great Grand Mother</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: nemi_bluerulz@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I m a 14 year old from India and i want to mention this extraordinary
incident i had when i was younger.</B>
<BR><B>To begin with, when I was about 11, my great grand mother (who I
call granny) who was extremely precious to me passed away at the age of
98. I was really close to her and loved her truly which even she did. Well,
this day was a Sunday about 11 in the morning and I and my mother were
having a serious argument, both of us were furious at one another and I
was bitterly crying. At this time, we were completely oblivious to the
death of my granny as she lived in Chennai, India while we were in Mumbai,
India. My mum, while she was screaming endlessly at me, got infuriated
and lifted her hand to slap me but all of a sudden, she felt an icy cold
hand hold her back. She seemed to be unable to speak either, as I could
see her opening and closing her mouth but no voice came out...I was genuinely
surprised and scared and had no idea what is going. Then, I felt a hand
on my hair traveling down my sweating forehead to my eyes and then wiping
my tears. The hand felt really cold, soft and kind of wrinkled. I was glued
to my position. I couldn’t move or speak. Although I felt really scared,
I also felt a peculiar feeling of warmth and love, like I m near someone
who really adores me and truly cares for me. I also suddenly remembered
my granny, wishing I could see her and talk to her and all the memories
came flooding back to me. However, as soon as these feelings came they
went away and the eerie air departed giving place to fright and wonder.</B>
<BR><B>We couldn’t interpret the reason for what happened, while my mother
told me about the chilly hand that held her, I mentioned my experience
leaving behind the part where I remembered my Granny out of the blues,
my mum did the same which I realized later on. However, as we sat in curiosity
and fright, we got a phone call from my uncle announcing my Granny’s death
at about 10.30 in the morning. It came as a subtle shock, for which I cried
for ages but it always felt great to perceive that she came to tell her
beloved daughter goodbye before leaving us all for ever.</B>
<BR><B>I also had a few more paranormal incidents after that, though they
wouldn’t be mentioned as ones which I don’t have nightmares about….. I
would love to share them with you but some other time. I don’t have any
proof for this story but this is really true. I would be really grateful
to you if you publish my story because I want to tell people that you always
don’t have to be scared of ghosts. I m very sorry if this is too long.</B>

<BR><B>My Grannys Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: spahlmann@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My whole 28 years, my grandmother has been a very religious person.&nbsp;
I used to kid her about being born with more religion than Jesus.&nbsp;
She is an open, honest, blunt person.&nbsp; She told me she was not always
the goodie goodie I see today. She was a rather hellcat back in her day.&nbsp;
My grandmother is 79 years old so I guess she could have had a life before
being a granny (lol).&nbsp; Well during one summer, I believe it was in
1988, my aunt and cousin were visiting us from South Carolina, Granny had
all her granddaughters, and daughters spend the night. It was like a big
generational slumber party.&nbsp; I was teasing Granny about being a holy
roller (we are close and kid all the time with her) , she said that she
had a story to tell me that caused her to find GOD and find him fast.&nbsp;
Back in the day, my granny’s brother Vaughn was a hooligan, as Granny put
it.&nbsp; He was cavorting with a married woman. One day my great Grandmother
told Uncle Vaughn to baby-sit my granny.&nbsp; He was a good 8 years older
than her.&nbsp; He threw a fit about watching his sister because he had
some place he needed to go.&nbsp; Great Grandmother told him to take Granny
with him.&nbsp; Uncle Vaughn made Granny walk with him down the field and
across the brook to his lady friends house.&nbsp; On the way, they passed
this HUGE tree, directly across the street stood an old 3-story home that
was vacant at the time.&nbsp; As they approached the tree, Uncle Vaughn
and Granny both stopped dead in their tracks. A huge fireball rolled from
the top of the tree, across the street, and under the old house.&nbsp;
The house did not burst into flames as one would think.&nbsp; Granny said
it just rolled under the house.&nbsp; Uncle and Granny both looked at each
other confirming the other had seen the same thing and bolted down the
road.&nbsp; Granny swears it was a warning from a higher power telling
Uncle Vaughn to leave that lady alone.&nbsp; Sure enough, as they approached
the lady’s house HER HUSBAND WAS HOME.&nbsp; Uncle Vaughn wanted to wait
him out, BUT Granny started crying and he decided to walk her home then
come back.&nbsp; On the way, back they had to cross the tree’s path once
more.&nbsp; Nothing happened this time.&nbsp; Great Grandmother was not
home yet and Uncle Vaughn had to stay and watch Granny.&nbsp; Two hours
passed and Great Grandmother came home and she was distraught.&nbsp; It
seems that Uncle’s lady friend and her hubby had a terrible fight and the
husband SHOT and KILLED his betraying wife.&nbsp; My Granny swears to this
day God was telling them what he was doing was wrong and he saved them
from being there and possibly being shot.&nbsp; Granny said she found God
that day and has not let him out of her grips.</B>

<P><B>My Grandparents House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: DaisyLadybug19@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have three things to tell, only one about me and the other two
about my dad and aunt. Just so everone knows, I haven't actually ever seen
a ghost or anything like that, I have just had funny feelings and all of
that kind of stuff.&nbsp; Ok here goes.</B>
<BR><B>When I was a baby, my parents and I lived in a one bedroom farm
house in the middle of a pasture.&nbsp; My dad has told me that he would
always get funny feelings in that house and see things out of the corner
of his eyes.&nbsp; Well, one night, he says he woke up and saw an old lady
standing over me, just watching me sleep. He told me that he felt very
peaceful, like she was there to watch over me and protect me.</B>
<BR><B>The second thing is that at my granparent's house, which they currently
live in, my aunt has seen a figure in a long robe with no face.&nbsp; She
has seen it three times, all when she was younger and still living at home.&nbsp;
She says that it was standing at the foot of my other aunt's bed and all
three times, turned and looked at her.&nbsp; Finally, the last time, she
told it to leave and to never return--ever.&nbsp; Every since then, no
one has seen it since then.</B>
<BR><B>Finally, both my dad and aunt have had other experiences which I
have been too afraid to have them tell me or they won't tell me For example,
my dad has had an out of body experience where he traveled across three
states to see his ex-wife.&nbsp; That is really strange.&nbsp; Anyways,
thank you for your time.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Ghostly Roommate</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: garbo9_99@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi, my name Nicole and I briefly shared my old apartment with a ghost.&nbsp;
I was living by myself in New Rochelle, NY, in an apartment building that
had been built in the early 1920's.&nbsp; The first strange experiences
revolved around an often empty apartment on my floor, where the door would
open by itself.&nbsp; During my three years living there at least ten people
had moved in and out of this apartment, many in the middle of the night.&nbsp;
My neighbors and I swore it was haunted.&nbsp; It was after many months
of this apartment being empty that strange things started happening in
MY apartment.&nbsp; I was planning to move, which may also have started
my ghostly friend's actions.&nbsp; The first occurance involved my 2am
need for a peanut butter and jelly sandwhich.&nbsp; Standing in my small
kitchen, I felt someone put the flat of their hand on my back.&nbsp; Jumping
and turning around, I found that not only was I alone in the room, but
both my cats were sitting on the floor and meowing at the empty space behind
me.&nbsp; After that, the occurances only increased.&nbsp; I would find
items moved around my house.&nbsp; At first I blamed my very playful cats,
but soon the objects included heavy books and candles, items a cat could
not have moved or knocked over.&nbsp; I found two hardcover books completely
on the other side of the room from where I'd left them, and a large candleholder
was completely upside down on my bedside table.&nbsp; One morning I was
blowdrying my hair, when another sound mixed in with the blowdryer.&nbsp;
I followed the sound into the kitchen to find it was the stove fan, which
had suddenly turned on full blast.&nbsp; As I approached it, it turned
itself off.&nbsp; The button never moved.&nbsp; Most of the occurances
happened in or around my kitchen.&nbsp; I was not frightened, for some
reason the idea of ghost did not scare me, and I was moving out soon anyway.&nbsp;
In fact, I think my moving may have been what prompted the ghost to show
itself.&nbsp; In the last occurance before I did finally move, I was going
through the apartment listings in the local newspaper when loud banging
noises started coming from my kitchen.&nbsp; It sounded as if things were
being knocked over and heavy items were being dropped onto the tile floor.&nbsp;
Immediately looking to blame my cats, I called for them to settle down
only to find them both sleeping on the couch beside me.&nbsp; The sounds
continued, growing louder and louder.&nbsp; Finally, I spoke outloud to
the ghost, asking it to stop making so much noise and that I was moving
whether it liked it or not.&nbsp; The noise suddenly stopped completely.&nbsp;
I moved a few weeks later, without any further incident.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Experiences and siblings experiences.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: loranda@mindless.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Loranda and I am a person who believes in the supernatural
and respect strange happenings, even though there may be some who do not
believe in ghost or strange happenings but I know there are some who believe
and have experience weird things that have happen. The stories I am about
to tell is what happen to my sister.</B>
<BR><B>The Mysterious Lady who slept beside my sister.</B>
<BR><B>One night about 7 yrs ago in 1996 my little sister Marisa who was
only 6 was home alone with me and I was about 12 our parents had a wedding
to go to and was going to be home late. The night was okay we played games
and watched videos in which we rent when our parents go out, but it was
a rainy night, anyways since it was a saturday night my sister wanted to
stay up late so she stayed up watching cartoons. I eventually went to sleep
in room and then half an hour later she went to sleep and it was around
8:00pm. I somehow could not go to sleep as i recall so I woke up at 8:30
cause i went in bed at 7:00pm or so and just watched TV or listen to music
in my room I was so caught up in everything I was doing that i didnt notice
my sister going to the talking to someone but I thought she was saying
something to me but I couldnt hear. Eventually I went to bed at 12:30am
or 1:00am.</B>
<BR><B>The next morning my parents were home and my sister told me that
my parents came home early at like 9:00am or so, obviously she telling
me she thought I was sleeping since I went to bed earlier, Then i replied
to her thats impossible cause I stayed up at 9pm and Mum and dad didnt
even come yet. She was convinced that my mum came at 9pm cause she told
me she had awoken up in bed and seeing a lady sitting up in bed next to
her and lying down and telling her to go sleep. Then to make everything
clear I told my sister to ask my mum and dad and they told her they came
at 1:30am or 2am. My sister told the incident to my parents but my dad
trying not to scare my sister told her she could of been dreaming but until
this day, 7yrs gone by she does not believe at all that she was dreaming.</B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>July 14, 2003 (Monday night)</B>
<BR><B>Record of events:</B>
<BR><B>I live in a two-story townhome.&nbsp; It was the middle of July
and it was</B>
<BR><B>very hot in Kansas City.&nbsp; I was sleeping on the couch downstairs,
as the</B>
<BR><B>upstairs is hot in the summer months.&nbsp; I was sleeping and I
remember a</B>
<BR><B>low heavy dark voice saying I must help Laura (my cousin) understand.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>woke up startled by the deepness of the voice, you could even say
a</B>
<BR><B>little bit scared.</B>
<BR><B>My dog, which hardly ever barks, was looking into the kitchen and</B>
<BR><B>growling, and then slowly he started to bark.&nbsp; He was watching
something</B>
<BR><B>and when I looked in the direction he was looking, of course I</B>
<BR><B>couldn't see anything.&nbsp; Light from the outside street lamp
was</B>
<BR><B>beaming through the window so it was somewhat light.&nbsp; He started
to back</B>
<BR><B>away and follow the presence into the den and then to the wall that
was</B>
<BR><B>straight across from me.&nbsp; He was watching something but of
course I</B>
<BR><B>still couldn't see anything but from the way I woke up, in a startled</B>
<BR><B>state, I was somewhat scared to move.&nbsp; Like an idiot I just
stayed still</B>
<BR><B>and watched my dog follow this presence that only he could sense.&nbsp;
He</B>
<BR><B>then stared to go to the door (located on the wall across from me,
and</B>
<BR><B>which opens to my garage) growling at the door.&nbsp; He would back
up and</B>
<BR><B>then move closer and then he stared to smell under the door.&nbsp;
Still I</B>
<BR><B>was too afraid to move, I just stayed there and watched.&nbsp; Within
5 to 10</B>
<BR><B>minutes of this, the presence seemed to have left for my dog stopped</B>
<BR><B>growling and was going from the kitchen to the wall and to the door</B>
<BR><B>again and again, as if to look for something.&nbsp; Finally he gave
up and</B>
<BR><B>just curled up at my feet (which have not moved a inch this whole
time)</B>
<BR><B>and fell asleep.&nbsp; Feeling now that the presence had left the
room I went</B>
<BR><B>to the door, which lead to my garage, and pushed on it to make sure
the</B>
<BR><B>door was closed.&nbsp; Once again stating what an idiot I am, I
did not dare</B>
<BR><B>open the door.&nbsp; Just to give you some back ground on my house
the door</B>
<BR><B>that goes to my garage does not have a lock on it, yes this is dangerous</B>
<BR><B>for if my garage door is open anybody could just walk right into
my</B>
<BR><B>house.&nbsp; Feeling somewhat safe that the presence had left, I
joined my</B>
<BR><B>dog and soon fell asleep.</B>
<BR><B>In the morning I woke, went upstairs to take a shower and dress
for</B>
<BR><B>work.&nbsp; When I came downstairs I gathered up all my things and
opened the</B>
<BR><B>door, which leads to my garage, and stood there in total amazement.&nbsp;
My</B>
<BR><B>garage door was wide open.&nbsp; I had left the door open all night
and</B>
<BR><B>morning.&nbsp; I truly feel my sprit guide was trying to warn me
and I was</B>
<BR><B>too stupid and afraid to listen to him.&nbsp; As I drove to work
I thanked</B>
<BR><B>him for trying to warn me and I promised to try and listen more</B>
<BR><B>carefully next time.&nbsp; The realty sank in that I could have
been robed,</B>
<BR><B>raped or killed.&nbsp; Yes, today I'm buying a chain lock for that
door and</B>
<BR><B>installing it right away.&nbsp; In hindsight, I wish I had been
more</B>
<BR><B>accepting of the events that were happening to me.&nbsp; If this
has taught</B>
<BR><B>me anything, it's to stop, slow down and listen to the ones who
are</B>
<BR><B>trying to help me.</B>

<BR><B>Interlocking Dreams &amp; Reality</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: rossiwrites@yahoo.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I had some strange and incredible experiences over the</B>
<BR><B>years. Just posted one in the last batch. Some of</B>
<BR><B>them, I haven't sorted out how to share yet. But the</B>
<BR><B>following experiences are pretty strange.</B>
<BR><B>My roommate and I were living in a Seattle</B>
<BR><B>neighborhood called, Capitol Hill. Our apt. bldg, The</B>
<BR><B>Ben Lomond was built in 1910 and my apt. overlooked a</B>
<BR><B>little park area with a long retaining wall in the</B>
<BR><B>back. One night I must have fallen into a deep sleep</B>
<BR><B>as soon as I went to bed. When I woke up the next day,</B>
<BR><B>I immediately told my roommate about a disturbing</B>
<BR><B>dream that a menacing, sinister black figure had</B>
<BR><B>climbed out of a hole in the ground right against the</B>
<BR><B>retaining wall. He seemed full of rage and anger. And</B>
<BR><B>was coming closer and closer to our window and meant</B>
<BR><B>real harm. It was a very real fearful feeling.</B>
<BR><B>After hearing my dream, my roommate said, she tried to</B>
<BR><B>wake me soon after I went to sleep but I was out cold.</B>
<BR><B>She said she heard something like a gunshot outside in</B>
<BR><B>the park and walked through our darkened apt. to the</B>
<BR><B>living room's bay window to see if she could see</B>
<BR><B>anything. She said she saw a black man fitting the</B>
<BR><B>physical discription of the man in my dream to a T. He</B>
<BR><B>appeared to be staring up at her. For whatever reason,</B>
<BR><B>I don't understand why she did this (considering she</B>
<BR><B>thought she heard a gunshot) but she shined a</B>
<BR><B>flashlight on him. When she did, she could no longer</B>
<BR><B>see him. Although she saw everything else, trees, the</B>
<BR><B>ground, bushes...everything where he was standing was</B>
<BR><B>illuminated but she he'd vanished. When she covered</B>
<BR><B>the light, there he was again. I guess she did this a</B>
<BR><B>few times until he really vanished. Very, very</B>
<BR><B>strange.</B><B></B>

<P><B>New Story:</B>
<BR><B>Another time I was staying in an artist loft in San</B>
<BR><B>Francisco that was in a really crappy area on Market</B>
<BR><B>Street &amp; 6th. I was in bed just starting to get that</B>
<BR><B>semi-lucid feeling when I woke with a frightened gasp.</B>
<BR><B>The only way to describe it is a "flash-vision." I</B>
<BR><B>thought for sure my throat had been slashed deep with</B>
<BR><B>a long knife from left to right and all this blood was</B>
<BR><B>pouring. I remember sitting up gasping knowing it was</B>
<BR><B>fatal. Then on the news the next day, chills went up</B>
<BR><B>my spin when the anchorperson said that someone's</B>
<BR><B>throat had been slashed at a hotel on 6th St. Right</B>
<BR><B>around the corner from where I was staying. Somehow, I</B>
<BR><B>must have picked up on the victim's fear, anxiety,</B>
<BR><B>shock.</B>
<BR><B>Not really a ghost story but still weird!</B>
<BR><B>Another time, a friend and I had inter-connecting</B>
<BR><B>dreams. I dreamt one part and she dreamt the other.</B>
<BR><B>They matched perfectly and since we both dreamt this</B>
<BR><B>right before we waking up, we assumed we had these</B>
<BR><B>dreams at the same time.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>I sensed the Presence</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: joanne.osullivan@ntlworld.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>As i was growing up i had several experiences with paranormal , one
time was as a youngster i was playing with my toys in the lounge and suddenly
i had this great feeling of fright around me. So i&nbsp; went running into
my mother who was washing the dishes, she told me not to be&nbsp; frightened
as there was nothing to be frightened of. So she reasured me and&nbsp;
took me back into the lounge to carry on playing but as she walked back
to carry on washing she saw a&nbsp; figure standing still in the hallway,
it what looked to be was a monk in a brown habit with his face covered
by his hood all you could see was his feet which had sandals on. My mother
walked towards it and it disapeared into my mothers bedroom. But my&nbsp;&nbsp;
mother always said " how i must of sensed the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
presence of the ghost "</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Another time in the same house , it was night time
and i couldnt sleep so i was just looking into space when 3 squares appeared
on the wall . I thought it must be some kind of light shining in from the
window , knowing full well that no light normaly shines through as we had
blinds and curtains up at the window, i kept on staring at the squares
on the wall, they didn't&nbsp; move or anything but i felt really frightened
like in the other story. I must of fell asleep thinking about the lights
on the wall. In the morning when i awoke the first thing i done was get
out of my bed and go straight to the wall , Hoping in the back of my mind
that there would'nt be any kind of marks on the wall where the squares
was , but i was so wrong. Where the squares was there&nbsp; was quite deep
line marks around where the shapes were. There is no logical explanation
for this story not that i can explain anyway, It was not possible for any
light to come through the curtains or blinds and there was no other kind
of lights or anything on in the room or in the house.&nbsp; I've tried
to come up with some sort of explanation and i dont have 1 and that happened
about 23 years ago</B>

<P><B>Ghosts in the Laundry Room</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: dvensel@csonline.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>This happened back in the late 60's when I was residing at the job
corp</B>
<BR><B>center in Excelsior Springs Missouri.</B>
<BR><B>It was a big old rambling campus type place that had once been a
hospital</B>
<BR><B>of some sort. At least that is what I had been told. I never paid
much</B>
<BR><B>attention to that kind of stuff back then and the stories that went
around</B>
<BR><B>the campus at that time did not mean much to me.&nbsp; One night
I was sitting</B>
<BR><B>in the laundry room washing out a few clothes while reading a book
when I</B>
<BR><B>felt something brush against the back of my neck. I never paid it
any mind.</B>
<BR><B>I just brushed it away.</B>
<BR><B>Suddenly someone nudged me on my back. I waited for them to say
excuse</B>
<BR><B>me.&nbsp; I thought it was rather rude of them not to say that so
I looked</B>
<BR><B>around to see who it was. There was no one there.&nbsp; I knew what
I felt and I</B>
<BR><B>knew someone had to be in that room with me for me to have felt
it. I felt</B>
<BR><B>they might be hiding and it was one of my friends playing a trick
on me. I</B>
<BR><B>went back to reading and the same thing happened.&nbsp; I grabbed
my book and</B>
<BR><B>the keys to my room and ran out. I never went back down there alone.</B><B></B>

<P><B>England Haunting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: amanda.kitty@tesco.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I live in England and have seen your great site. I have had interesting
experiences but never really spoken about them, only really with my family
as we all seemed to have had experiences in our childhood home.</B>
<BR><B>Our situation basically came to a head when our local priest (we
are non practisicing) had to visit our family home on two occaisions, possibly
a third time to do a blessing because we were having paranormal activity,
ranging from things being thrown, furniture moving, and also, being touched.
My parents called in the priest because the activity seemed to be getting
worse and my brother was attacked in his bed, he had a weird dream and
woke up suddenly because he had hands around his neck. When he told my
parents this, they called in the priest who told them that he had blessed
the house but didnt think that helped.</B>
<BR><B>My family moved into our house in the 1970's (the house was owned
by the local authority and known as a council house, we took over the tenancy
from the previous owner)</B>
<BR><B>The house was crowded as there were lots of children in the family,
my eldest sister had a small bedroom to herself but ever since moving in
I remember her telling my parents that</B>
<BR><B>there was something wrong in the room. The house generally felt
creepy, especially upstairs, we had a loft</B>
<BR><B>entrance on the ceiling outside the bathroom and it always used
to feel odd to be near it or standing under it. My parents had had a conversation
which one of the children overheard where my father said that the house
was haunted as he had seen a figure hovering outside the bathroom door,
near one of the bedrooms.&nbsp; My sister was always running out of the
room during the night, and on one night it must have been really bad as
she ran out of her room screaming telling my dad to 'get it out of her
room'. I am really sure that my parents knew exactly what was going on
but didnt talk about it to the younger children.</B>
<BR><B>As we got slightly older things had escalated. Every night my parents
would leave the 'landing' light on upstairs and leave our bedroom doors
wide open. If we heard our parents go up to the bathroom while we were
in bed, we would say 'goodnight'. For a long time we would hear footsteps
on the stairs and say goodnight, the footsteps would stop and there would
be no one there.</B>
<BR><B>As a small child, I had always been very imaginative and withdrawn
and remember hearing odd things in the house, or having odd sensations.
As I became a teenager these feelings became worse. I remember in particular,
one evening I was going upstairs to the bathroom, my little brother was
in there so I decided to sit on the top of the stairs to wait my turn.
My eldest sister came in from work and opened her bedroom door. As soon
as the door was opened, a can of&nbsp; coke, came flying out of the room,
whizzed past my sisters head and hit&nbsp; the wall opposite.</B>
<BR><B>Its strange but whenever the younger children went to the bathroom
my mother would wait for them and sit on the top step. One evening my youngest
brother was in the bathroom and we heard my brother start screaming. My
sisters bedroom door had opened, and a ring pull floated out of the room
and was aimed towards my brothers face, but it seemed to move not very
fast, giving my mum time to slam shut the bathroom (toilet door) so that
it didnt hit him.</B>
<BR><B>When my older sister left home, I got her bedroom. I could never
sleep as I kept thinking that I saw shadows in the room. I didnt sleep
easily at all,&nbsp; I would be in a half dozing state and would always
be woken for some reason but not sure what. My expriences really started
when my sister left home, also things seemed to happen to the rest of the
family. Everyone always felt very uncomfortable at the top of the stairs,
on the landing, near the bathroom and the first bedroom. Or either felt
that when they were going down stais, someone was behind them.</B>
<BR><B>It mainly started one night when I was desperately trying to get
to sleep, I was half dozing when my bed (it was placed near to the wall
but not directly against it) began to move, just slightly, a soft push
towards the wall. It sort of felt like a rocking motion. I was too scared
to do anything, as I was in a half dreamlike state and very imaginative
I decided that it was my imagination and ignored it. But this continued
for nearly a year.</B>
<BR><B>I was off school for some months due to illnes and sometimes would
be in the house on my own. One day, while I was in the kitchen (mum was
out shopping) I looked up towards the living room and saw a figure, of
a person, (white and sort of misty but a definate shape) move across the
living room. I dont know if the figure was male or female but I definately
saw it.&nbsp; I was frightened.&nbsp; Later on, I sat in the living room
and began to get a feeling of electricity flowing through me, it increased
to the extent that my fingers had a really bad pins and needles sensation
and I felt on edge. I began to feel like I could fill the whole room and
then I heard a man, faint but I could definately hear him.He laughed and
then said something like 'lovely'.&nbsp; Whenever I had any other experiences
I would get the electricity feeling in me again and it seemed to make the
experiences worse. One afternoon, I was in my living room and it was quite
dimly lit as it was in winter and overcast outstide and I didnt have any
internal lights on. I began to get the electricity feeling again but didnt
hear or see anything odd, the only thing was that when I looked at my hands
they looked as if they</B>
<BR><B>to have been dipped in a very light blue florecscent substance,
I could see the more intense blue in the lines of my hands. After&nbsp;
4 seconds or so they blue just disapeared and my hands looked normal and
the electricity feelings stopped.</B>
<BR><B>I will tell you something quite private but as its email and you
have never&nbsp; met me I can talk about it. My family was disfunctional
in that there was a lot of unrest in the house and when I was a child,
I was diagnosed&nbsp; emotional problems, so for a long time I couldnt
trust my own feelings and it took a while for me to confide in my parents.
One day I told my mum that my bed had been moving for months. She didnt
dismiss me or tell me that it was my imagination, she said that it was
my grandmother trying to get me to sleep. Which I thought was a bit odd
as an explanation.</B>
<BR><B>I needed to know for myself if the bed moving would happen to me
anywhere else in the house and if anyone could validate it. So I told my
younger sister what was going oin and asked her if I could sleep in her
bed for a couple of nights, but I wanted her to pretend to be asleep so
that if the bed moved I knew it was for real. This sounds like a stupid
plan but we were very young!</B>
<BR><B>I stayed with my sister for two nights, on the first night nothing
happened, and my sister fell asleep anyway. On the second night, at about
1 in the morning, my sister had</B>
<BR><B>started sleeping and the bed began to move. I woke my sister up
and told her to stay awake. When she was wake the bed would not move, when
she fell asleep again.it would. I woke my sister up and got pretty angry
with her telling her to pretend to be sleeping so that if the bed moved
she could feel it. Nothing happended for another hour or so, so I decided
that there was no point in distrubing my sister again. I was drifting off
to sleep and the bed started to move again, I said something like ' stop
it' and the bed stopped moving. About 10 minutes later I had shifted position
in the bed and my right knee was raised slightly off the bed.&nbsp; I was
very nearly sleeping when a hand ( I could feel the seperated fingers)
grabbed my knee for about 3 seconds, I screamed out and my mum heard me
and came running into the room. I told her what happened and she said that
I had imagined it.</B>
<BR><B>Shortly after my eldest brother Michael had said that he saw a figure
looming on the landling near his room and he was sure that it was male
as he saw a brief outline of some kind of uniform.</B>
<BR><B>The most unusual occurance happended one night at about 11 pm, the
children were all put to bed and I was having a strange dream where I saw
a woman, very short and naked, in the corner of my room, very near the
ceiling high up against the wall. In this dream she suddenly dropped down
towards me in my bed. I woke up suddenly because I was frightened, about
3 seconds after I woke, my sister Helen ran into my room telling me that
I must stay with her in her bed as she saw a woman who tried to grab and
hit her in bed.</B>
<BR><B>Lots more experiences happened in the house but they were not as
major as the ones I have listed here. Unfortunately I can find out more
specific details as my mother died in 1991 and my dad had an accident and
now has slight brain damage which does affect his memory, however I spoke
to him recently regarding the house and he appeared to know what I was
talking about but did not want to give me any more information. I got a
feeling that he was trying to cover up.</B>
<BR><B>I remember my mum telling me and other family members that they
had got a local priest in the bless the house, and I thought that this
was odd as we were not church goers at all. I later found out from my eldest
brother Michael that he was present on one occiasion when the priest visited
and we went into every room in the house to bless it. I know that the priest
was called a second time but am not sure if he visited a third time.&nbsp;
The second time he was called in because Michael had a strange dream one
night which appeared to be about some kind of water, and he woke to find
hands around his neck. There were marks on his neck and my parents panicked
as they felt that the activity was getting quite serious so the priest
was called in the second time. When the priest returned to the living room
he told my mum and Michael that 'he tried but he could not get rid of it'</B>
<BR><B>Things seemd to quiten down after about six months or so after the
blessing and while my dad was clearing out the loft area for storage space,
he found an old services uniform and threw it away. From then on we didnt
seem to have any other experiences in the house and gradually the family
moved out. We all left the house in the 1990's.</B>
<BR><B>I have done some investigation work and found out that an elderly
man lived in the house from 1945 to 1971, where he was moved into residential
care where he died.</B>
<BR><B>The housing development itself was built in the 1920.s</B>
<BR><B>I am sure that lots more happened but neither my eldest sister or
dad will talk about it.</B>
<BR><B>I have had other experiences, in other places, at work, other places
I have lived but nothing like the events in our family home. It is a relief
to finally be able to talk about it to people who can understand and make
sense of it.</B>

<BR><B>Alexandria Hotel, Los Angeles, California</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Honoredhubert@earthlink.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Some friends and I were just talking online today about the Roosevelt
Hotel in Los Angeles, and how it's supposedly haunted by Marilyn Monroe.
I've never been to the Roosevelt, but I've been in the Alexandria a couple
times. THAT place is most definitely haunted. My spooky-radar was going
off like crazy.</B>
<BR><B>If you go up the back staircase, behind the front desk, and turn
right, on your right is the top part of the false ceiling they put in over
the lobby years ago. They turned it into some sort of commons area (it's
a transient motel now). If you go to the doorway, something malevolent
lets you know it doesn't want you to intrude. Go a little farther in, even
to inspect the plasterworks that used to grace the balcony, and it is mentally
pushing you back out. When you leave, it stays at the doorway, watching
you to make sure you're not turning around... and when I turned to look
again, it pushed me again.</B>
<BR><B>Then, down the hall, is an old ballroom. It's beautiful in there,
but there is this just really bittersweet feeling to it. Whether it's the
room itself or some ghosts, I don't know, but something is waiting for
the band to play again, and the parties to return. You walk in, and you
want to dance ballroom-style. Both the guy I went with and I actually felt
like swaying our bodies when we were in there.</B>
<BR><B>Farther down the hallway, it's pitch black, or at least it was when
we were there. You can't even see the hallway, it grows so dark. And there's
something just totally sad and unwelcoming down there. Needless to say,
we didn't venture too much farther, and turned and went back towards the
stairs. The presence was still near the door on the right, guarding the
room.</B>
<BR><B>I forgot to add, when we were walking away from the first room,
we stopped dead in our tracks, thinking someone was coming down the stairs,
and we'd be caught trespassing. There was someone the floor above us, step-step-THUMP,
step-step-THUMP, like he was dragging something heavy down the stairs.
We hid a bit behind the wall, waiting, but as the noise rounded the corner
where we should have been able to see someone, the noise just stopped.
And no, there wasn't anyone there. We played it off, saying it must have
just been an echo from a few floors up, but it was definitely right there
on the stairs.</B>

<P><B>A Daycare Haunting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: CFlores@HillcrestBank.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I use to work at this day care center, that only stayed in business
for two</B>
<BR><B>years.&nbsp; The building that we worked in had many owners, and
many businesses</B>
<BR><B>but never stayed in business for longer than 2 years, usually bankruptcy</B>
<BR><B>would follow.&nbsp; Anyway, I had worked there for about a year
and had always</B>
<BR><B>been scared of the back of the building.&nbsp; There was a long
dark corridor</B>
<BR><B>that always gave me the chills, and I always felt like I was being
watched.</B>
<BR><B>I had the early morning shift, so I had to be there at 6:30, and
get ready</B>
<BR><B>for the kids to arrive.&nbsp; One morning I had an infant, who was
only four</B>
<BR><B>months old and was asleep at the time of the incident.&nbsp; We
were in our room</B>
<BR><B>and I was right out papers for the rest of the day when I saw a
toy out of</B>
<BR><B>the corner of my eye being thrown across the room.&nbsp; I didn't
think anything</B>
<BR><B>of it, and played it off as my imagination, until a week later,
when another</B>
<BR><B>co-worker had told me what happened to her.&nbsp; She was in the
sleep room</B>
<BR><B>changing a Childs diaper, when she looked right and saw a little
girl</B>
<BR><B>standing there staring are her.&nbsp; She looked back at the child
she was</B>
<BR><B>changing and back and the little girl, who had vanished.&nbsp; There
were no</B>
<BR><B>children besides the one she was changing in the room with her.&nbsp;
It freaked</B>
<BR><B>her out, and when she told me freaked me out because then I realized
that</B>
<BR><B>the toy I saw thrown across the room wasn't my imagination.&nbsp;
Neither one of</B>
<BR><B>us had another experience, but those two were enough for us.</B>

<P><B>THE UNDERPASS</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: john@righttouchinteriors.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My family and I became aware of a pariticular area of supposed haunting
in the Jamestown, NC area.&nbsp; We were intrigued by the article and wanted
to investigate even though we are people of faith.&nbsp; The article which
made us aware of the haunting was in a local magazine and caught my two
sons' attention after my wife read the article in a restaurant.&nbsp; The
article described the following:&nbsp; In the 1920's, their was an accident
in Jamestown near a certain bridge underpass involving two high school
students returning from the local prom.&nbsp; Both of the young students
were killed in the accident.&nbsp; From time to time, locals have reported
driving by the area where the accident occurred and spotting a young woman
dressed nicely standing by the road side needing a lift.&nbsp; The stories
tell of a young woman, named Lydia, entering the car and decribing where
she needed to dropped.&nbsp; Upon nearing the destination, she vanishes.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Of course, my wife and I are skeptical to say the least.&nbsp;
So, unaware of any peril or should I say for a lack of knowledge or fear,
we thought we would investigate with our two young sons of five and eight
years.&nbsp; We arrived at the location which is off the main road into
the woods about 100 yards.&nbsp; There is an old</B>
<BR><B>stone blocked railroad underpass located next to the now regularly
used underpass.&nbsp; Both of the underpasses have been covered with grafitti
in tribute to the stories of Lydia.&nbsp; The old underpass, however, has
been overgrown with ivy and weeds and is relatively secluded to say the
least.&nbsp; Nevertheless, we were determined to investigate despite the
"spooky" nature of the claims.</B>
<BR><B>As we entered the underpass, the air became distinctly colder which
we all noticed. We all felt frightened and left after only a few moments.&nbsp;
We got in our car and drove home.&nbsp; We though nothing of the event
until that evening.&nbsp; Strange things began to occur at about 2:00 am.&nbsp;
Of all things, an old "Woody" doll with a pull string began to speak in
a toy box and would not stop.&nbsp; The electric van door opened and closed
several times without any provocation.&nbsp; My boys thought someone was
in their room.&nbsp; We thought we were just frightened from our prior
experience and let our logical minds control.&nbsp; The house still seamed
strange to me and I had difficultly sleeping even though my male ego would
not let me admit my fear.</B>
<BR><B>Time went by and although the supposed haunting events were less
dramatic, they nevertheless continued for about a month.&nbsp; It came
time for the van to have a regular tune up and we took it to the dealership.&nbsp;
When my wife returned with the van, the troubles ceased.&nbsp; I don't
know what we experienced exactly over that month period in 2001, but it
seemed real.&nbsp; My wife and I still question the validity of our "haunting,"
but our youngest son still maintains that Alydia, as he refers to her,
often talked to him and was very nice.&nbsp; Anyway, it is a nice little
story we often tell family members, who don't think were lost, on cozy
evenings.&nbsp; Hope you will enjoy.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Restaurant</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: MOM2TYANDBRAN2@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi My name is Tracy and I live in upstate NY. For a while I lived
in a small town in Ct where I worked as a supervisor in a small town restaurant.
this restaurant was a very active field of energy and I had many expericences
here. One of the most visual happened early one morning as myself and two
of the staff were entering the building for the morning. We had 4 different
entrances to the building. The cook and I unlocked the door in the down
stairs bar and entered while our co-worked unlocked the upstair door and
entered through the main enterance. I went to open the door to go upstairs
and found it stuck. This door had no lock and never closed tightly. At
that moment I heard a set of feet running down the stairs. I expected to
open the door and see my co-worker standing at the botom of the stairs
since the door he had come through was irght at the top of the stairs.
When the door finally opened there was no one there and in fact he had
not entered the building yet. I had on more then one occasion seen the
little girl whom I had come to know a CORA. She was a small girl, frail.
Perhaps seven. She wore a deep blue velvet dress with patten leather shoes.
She had very curly brown hair and played with a small rubber ball which
I would see and hear going up and down the stairs. I think because I am
so open an unafriad I see peole who have passed as clearly as I see someone
who is living. She was a young girl who was buried in a small rural cemetary
behind the restaurant that was exclusivly for people who had dies from
small pox. She was tiny and very sweet. Never harmed anyone but liked to
play on the stairs with her ball.</B><B></B>

<P><B>hi, my names stephanie and i live in detroit.&nbsp; last month on
july 5th, i</B>
<BR><B>went up north to a city called manistee with my sister, her boyfriend,
his</B>
<BR><B>mom, his step dad, 2 of his cousin, his 2 younger brothers, and
his grandma.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; a few days went by with nothing happinging, then 4 days before
my sisters</B>
<BR><B>boyfriends parents, brothers, grandma, and one of his cousins were
going to</B>
<BR><B>leave, his younger brothers, step dad, and younger cousin (who is
around my</B>
<BR><B>age) decided to go to the cemetary down the road from their cabin,
called</B>
<BR><B>the riverview cemetary, around midnight.&nbsp; while they were there,
one of the</B>
<BR><B>brothers had kicked a headstone and the cousin, named whitnee, had
said to</B>
<BR><B>him, "You know, their going to get you for that!"&nbsp; then they
decided to</B>
<BR><B>leave.&nbsp; as they were walking down the path (which seems to
light up during</B>
<BR><B>the night) whitnee said that at one point, everything became suddenly
quiet</B>
<BR><B>and as the others walked ahead of her, she felt someone pat her
on the head</B>
<BR><B>more then a few times, and when she turned around, no one was there.&nbsp;
then</B>
<BR><B>later, the younger brothers and whitnee decided to take the family
dog,</B>
<BR><B>zeke, into the cemetary.&nbsp; the cemetary, by the way, is very
very old and</B>
<BR><B>small, and many of the headstones date back to the 1800's.&nbsp;
while zeke was</B>
<BR><B>in the cemetary, he went up to almost every headstone and sniffed
it and was</B>
<BR><B>very happy.&nbsp; then he came to a headstone that was broken (the
cross had</B>
<BR><B>ether fallen off or someone had purposly broken it.)&nbsp; he refused
to go near</B>
<BR><B>the stone and whimpered and put his tail between his legs.&nbsp;
the same thing</B>
<BR><B>happend at another headstone in the far left corner of the cemetary.&nbsp;
then</B>
<BR><B>the day they were all leaving, me and whitnee decided to go down
to the</B>
<BR><B>cemetary to take a few pictures of the headstones zeke had been
afraid of.</B>
<BR><B>while we were there, we found a pale yellow grasshopper and i was
having</B>
<BR><B>whitnee take a picture of it when we faintly heard screaming start.&nbsp;
we were</B>
<BR><B>of course scared, and stood completely still as it got louder and
we could</B>
<BR><B>clearly hear a little boy screaming for someone to help him.&nbsp;
we decided to</B>
<BR><B>leave and right when we reached the path and the edge of the cemetary,
the</B>
<BR><B>screaming completely stopped.&nbsp; we did think of the possibility
that it was</B>
<BR><B>the younger boys trying to scare us, so we headed back to camp,
still</B>
<BR><B>spooked, and asked everyone if ether of the boys had left at all.&nbsp;
everyone</B>
<BR><B>said that they had just finished taking down the tent and were now
playing</B>
<BR><B>football with the older cousin, which they indeed were and neither
looked</B>
<BR><B>tired at all, and they would have had to run extremely fast in order
to get</B>
<BR><B>back to camp before us, especially since they would have had to
have been</B>
<BR><B>close to us due to the volume of the screaming.&nbsp; thank you

<P><B>It was after my eleventh birthday which was a few weeks after November
5th.</B>
<BR><B>It was around 12 midnight when this happened. I woke up like I was
expecting to see someone. So, I look out into my hallway and I saw this
little boy who was staring right at me. He was dressed in a suit and some
fancy shoes. I pinched myself hard to see if I was dreaming, but....I sure
wasn't.&nbsp; I got so scared that I couldn't speak-I was afraid to anyway.</B>
<BR><B>The little boy was there waving at me, and at the same time, smiling.</B>
<BR><B>I couldn't even wave back, I was so scared.</B>
<BR><B>After a while, the boy went away, disappearing into the darkness,
but he still comes back, and now I am used to it.</B>
<BR><B>On November 5th I had a sleepover party and I invited a few of my
friends.</B>
<BR><B>We stayed up late, but eventually we went to sleep.</B>
<BR><B>My friend Briana couldn't get to sleep because she was getting distracted
by someone or something&nbsp; pulling books from my bookshelf. You couldn't
see the person. One book landed in front of my best friend's face, which
she woke up and saw it right there in front of her, and that's when I woke
up.</B>
<BR><B>She was going to scream,so I bent over and covered my hand on her
mouth and told her to stay quiet.&nbsp; I grabbed the book and threw it
to the other side of the room.</B>
<BR><B>My friend was very terrified and she was trembling, and really trembling.</B>
<BR><B>We&nbsp; weren't alone that night because we just didn't feel alone.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Hill</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: P2i2ShAwTy@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I just thought to send in an odd and abnormal experience that concurred
a couple of months ago.&nbsp; My friends and I have never shared this information
and knowledge with anyone for the fear that we may become social rejects,
laughed at, or maybe even classified as "troubled hoodlums" making hoax
stories.. Well, I'm from Syracuse, NY.&nbsp; That place is just...like
everywhere you go you feel something tagging alongside you...also, just
add another haunted spot in Syracuse, NY...On James St. behind a couple
of buildings their is this borded up house the sits in the center of a
parking lot...weird...but if you go there late at night and if the light
in the lot goes off..which it always does...you can see about 4 ppl..very
clearly standing on the balcony.&nbsp; It looks as though a woman is drinking
something in the shape of an odd looking class...2 men sit to the side
and one man, who is very scary and mean looking....people that I know broke
into the house and they ran screamin down the street.&nbsp; They claimed
that they heard the sounds of a woman screaming and men laughing.&nbsp;
I never went inside the house only saw but that isn't what I want to talk
about...in watertown, ny there has been claims of a vortex...so my friends
and I decided to go to travel through this "vortex"&nbsp; It took forever
to find the place...we got the help of a young resident to show us were
the story takes place....they say you can see the white lines and stuff
like that....We never say any white lines of any sort...but it took us
forever just to find the right path of trees...my friend discovered it
first...she collapsed to the ground because she was so dizzy...she had
no idea what had happened..we thought she was crazy...until her watch started
blinkin 12:00 because somehow her watch wasn't set anymore...so we asked
her where she walked through...at the this point im curious but very hesitant..as
I took my steps you can feel your lungs collapsing almost as if the air
is so heavy to breathe in...but yet it feels as if "others" besides my
friends were watching...my friends claim they saw a glow around me...well
not a glow...you know when you see an apparation you see white stuff around
it thats what they say was around me...then in a split second i was on
the middle of the hill with my legs wobblin and everything seemed disoriented
as if i was on a "bad drug"....My mind went crazy...thoughts and images
of when i was younger and I believe to this day an image of my past life
was brought to me.. i never believed in past lives until that night....I
think of this "vortex" as a path were you meet the person that once contained
your spirit...I dunno..even typing this sounds weird but its still all
jumpled in my head...also when my friends look at my watch the dates (i
have digital watch) kept going back and back while my watch blinked 2:31....it
didn't stop for about a week...I know this may sound weird but I thought
I would share it with you guys...</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Lux1784@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello. My name is Rachel. Im 18. I have been seeing ghosts since
i was 11. The first one i saw was when i lived in New York in my kitchen
when i was getting orange juice. It was a boy standing in front of me.
He was wearing clothes from the 1800's. He was also glowing blue. Then
I saw a man at the foot of my bed when i was laying down when i was 12.
When i was 13 I was at my friends house sleeping over and the lights were
off and i saw a face in her kitchen(like it was ducking) the hands were
on the counter. The face was very very scary looking. I couldnt sleep that
night. Then i moved to Massachusettes when i was 14. When I would be in
my room at night with the light off i would see faces. Then i was walking
by this house and i looking in a window and there was a little boy and
a little girl and they were waving at me. Then i was still walking home
and i was walking in a parking lot and i saw a girl in a car and the car
started and i looked to the side for one second. When i looked back she
wasnt there. I went by the car and looked in but no one was in there. The
freaky thing was the car was on. Now no on would be able to get out of
the car without me seeing them. This parking lot is severly hugh. Then
i was in the living room watching tv with my brother and i looked out the
living room into the dining room and i saw an old man and he disappeared
behind the wall. The last time i something happened to me was 6 months
ago. I was talking to my brother in my room. Then he left and I told him
to shut the light and he did and he shut the door. As soon as he shut the
door I heard growling and barking as if a dog was right in my ear. I got
really scared and called him back in the room to turn the light on. Ever
since then i cant go to sleep with the light off unless im with my sister.
Even then Im scared. But its better when im with someone. I used to love
the dark. Not anymore. So i dont know if ill start seeing thing again or
if i move ill start seeing things and hearing things. I really hope not.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;The Ghost of Mr. B.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Titan0508@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I'm 14 years old now. It happened 9 years ago. I was 5 at the time.
I lived in Walpole, Massachusetts with my sister, my brother, my mom, and
my stepdad.&nbsp; I had an awful cold that night. I couldn't breath through
my nose at all. It was becoming very hard for me to sleep. I didnt want
to wake anyone up at this time in the night because it was about 2:00 in
the morning. So instead, i went to go downstairs to get some cough syrup.
We lived in a two family apartment. There was an old lady that owned the
apartment. Her name was Mrs. B. Well thats what we all called her. She
had a husband but he had died years before we had moved in. When i was
walking down the stairs into the bathroom to get the cough syrup, i saw
a transparent, luminous figure somewhat taking the shape of a male adult.
I was very scared. It didnt see me. It acted as though i was not there.
It just walked into my living room as i watched. I ran back into my room
and layed under the blankets the rest of the night partly because of my
cold but mostly because of my fear. I will never forget that night when
i saw who i believed to be the ghost of Mr. B</B>

<BR><B>Spooky Cat Statue</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: TaiKwonDoQueen@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My nan once told me about when she was married to her first husband.
It was about April 1976. My nan had just purchased this three foot tall
statue of a leopard in attack position. It was a brilliant piece of art
and everyone was proud of it. My nan kept it in her living room and polished
it regularly. But then a few weeks later, my uncle (who was 12 at the time)
ran into it and it's head fell off. My nan was so upset she moved it onto
the landing because of the crack after it was repaired. That night after
the statue was broken and repaired, nan and her husband went to bed. They
slept in the room at the front near where the statue now was. Nans' husband
woke her up and said he heard something on the landing. She listened. She
heard low growling and padded footsteps walking up and down the landing.
Then when they sat up, there was the sound of something heavy hitting the
door. Then there was load scratching noises on their door. Then the noise
stopped. In the morning, after a sleepless night, they examined their door.
There were claw marks in the wood, like a huge cat had tried to get in.
They wondered what had done it and nan looked at her statue. It was in
the exact same place it was yesterday but it's claws were covered in wood
shavings. My nan freaked and got a friend to drive the statue to the dump
and smash it to bits. To this day my nan believes that it was the statue
that clawed her door. But she doesn't quite know.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Sach's Bridge</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: MandyMoo@starmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>There is a bridge in Gettysburg called "Sach's Bridge" and one time
My grandma,mom,and I went there one night.We were the only ones there and
it was about dusk.I was just looking around with the video camera just
to show the people at home what was there.So when I pointed the camera
at the top left hand corner of the bridge I seen what looked like white
smoke.After I seen it I showed my mom and grandma what I seen.So they seen
it and we were walking closer to it.When we were directly under it we smelled
cigar smoke,but none of us smokes and there was no one else there.Soon
after that a man came along and he had a digital camera.So we were telling
him what we seen and he seemed to be very interested so he took a couple
of pictures where I said I seen the ectoplasm (thats what I thought was
smoke).So he took a couple pictures of that then took some pictures of
inside the bridge.Well on the back of his digital camera was a screen that
you could see what you took pictures of,so he showed us all of his pictures
.And in one of the pictures were my grandma,mom,and I walking to the other
side of the bridge.Right behind my mom was a humungous orb that looked
as big as a full moon.Well after a couple hours of talking about our experiences
at the bridge we went down to the triangular field.We were the only ones
there because it was past 11:00 and we seen a blue light flicker at the
bottom so we walked down and we were looking around with the video camera
and we seen a man walking back and forth like he was a guard.We went over
to ask him why he was walking back and forth and when we walked closer
he dissapeared.We realized then that we should go because the battlefeild
patrol might come and make us get out of the battlefeild because it was
so late.That was an experience ill never forget</B><B></B>

<P><B>Room 207 Henry:the final chapter.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: PatnConnie99@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, It's been a few months since I've written to
you about our ghost in residence Henry.&nbsp; For the past few months it
was the same old thing, a few noises here and there and the occasional
"it's a little chilly in here can we have some more blankets?" but nothing
of any real consequence. Nothing of course until a few days ago. A couple
checked in after requesting that particular room spent the night and upon
check out they informed me that they had read my story on the Shadowlands
website and were intrigued. They did verify that there was a ghost in the
room (the woman claimed to be a medium) and that he was a man in his mid
sixties that died about 4 years ago. He was a guest here for a few days
while he was on vacation. She claimed that he slipped on some ice while
out enjoying Colorado in the winter and died. (Not at the hotel) She said
that this (the Days Inn) was his last memory before he died and that is
why he came back. She was vague on a name or a date (surprise) but she
did say that he was sad and missed his family. They then told me that they
did a "cleansing" and that he has gone on. A few things that bother me
about this. Number one with a bullet is what if they didn't do this so
called cleansing correctly and sent him somewhere worse, Number two, no
one asked them to do this. Number three, they lit incense in one of my
non smoking rooms. I have not seen/felt Henry since then. There have been
no complaints of cold or banging on the walls. All I can do is hope that
he is in a better place and wish him well.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Haunted Television</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: anonymous</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>First off, I want to say that I love your site to bits!</B>
<BR><B>I want to share with you one of my own true 'ghost stories'.</B>
<BR><B>It all happened just a few days ago. My best friend, Danielle, Danny
for short, and I were in my basement watching T.V. I should mention that
the basement is actually my room, and we always hang out there.</B>
<BR><B>Well, in the middle of the show, the T.V. turned off by itself.
First, I thought he power went out because of a storm. Keep in mind we
are in the basement, no windows. SO I had no idea what was going on upstairs.
Danny and I went upstairs to look outside. No storm or sign of rain at
all.</B>
<BR><B>So we thought maybe someone had cut the power off or something.
I kept telling myself that, although I knew very well it wasn't true because
the T.V. upstairs was still on. I have always believed in ghosts even though
no one in my family did. Danny believed in ghosts also.</B>
<BR><B>Danny and I made our way back downstairs and found the T.V. was
still off. I went and sat on the couch and so did Danny. We were a little
scared by this point, but thought that Zach was playing a trick on us.
Zach is my little brother, also a really good prankster.</B>
<BR><B>But, after a while of talking, I noticed the button that turns the
T.V. on was pushed in, meaning someone had turned off the T.V.</B>
<BR><B>Slowly, I got up, scared to death, grabbed Danny's hand, and stormed
up the stairs and out the basement door. On my way out, I couldn't bring
myself to look at the T.V. I just ran until I got to the living room, where
Zach was sitting on the couch and watching T.V.</B>
<BR><B>Later when I had enough guts to go back down there, and partly because
Danny forced me, I saw that the T.V. had been turned back on. But the button
was still pushed in.</B>
<BR><B>I tried to turn it off. But every time I pushed it, the button wouldn't
come out, meaning the T.V. was on but in the case it was off. So I unplugged
it. Still wouldn't turn. This time I didn't wait for Danny. I ran out of
there like my life depended on it.</B>
<BR><B>Danny followed me and soon after, I got Zach and my mother to go
down with me. My mom was determined to prove me wrong. Well, she did. The
T.V. was plugged in and off, and the button was pushed in, meaning that
it was indeed off.</B>
<BR><B>I have a few other stories, but I will send them in later. Thanks
for reading this one!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Peaceful Haunting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:saz121401@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Three years ago my family and I moved from the city to an older house
in a rural area of Massachusetts. The house is about 70 years old. Before
moving I had never had any belief in ghost, spirits etc. However over the
last few years my whole outlook has changed. The first thing I noticed
was that the front door would knock on it's own. The funny thing was it
would only knock about five minutes before a visitor arrived. To this very
day if I hear the knock I can look outside no one will be there and within
five minutes someone will show.&nbsp; All the t.v's in the house will change
channels, and turn on by themselves. Often they will come on to a channel
with only no clear picture. Just snow. If you change it it will change
back. You can shut it off all you want but it comes back on. The only way
to have it stay off is to ask. My friends thought I was making this up
until they saw it themselves. There are sounds of running on the stairs
and maybe the creepiest of all the sound of my family members when they
are not around. Such as my sister talking on the phone. My father owns
a guitar and more than once a chord will be strummed as the instrument
stands alone in the room.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; My sister has felt someone holding her hand, lights
come on by themselves and each member of my family has seen switches move
by themselves. Things fall off of places they couldn't fall off by themsleves
(such as items pushed far back on a counter) Things are stuffed into off
places and there are light scratches on many of the doorways. As scary
as all this sounds there is something about whatever it is that is absolutely
peaceful. There is never anything dangerous or even bothersome. A simple
"please stop" will usually bring about an end to whatever is going on.
The only thing I know about the histroy of the house is an older woman
lived here most of her life and owned all the surrounding property. Her
children sold us the house when her health forced her into a nursing home.
She died soon after. Before her there was another family that built the
house but I have been able to find almost nothing about them.&nbsp; This
area was also very highly populated with Indians. My family and I agree
that it seems to be a child. The running up the stairs and gettig into
things it shouldn't but also how quickly it listens if you ask it to stop.
It seems that when there is a disagreement in the household things really
start up. This seems like something a child would do. It does not like
any confrontation or bad feelings.Sometimes as night it does get a little
creepy but for the most part we have accepted that whoever it is was probably
here first and since they seem to enjoy us being here we have no need for
concern.</B>

<BR><B>Past Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: pcdp@brain.net.pk</B><B></B>

<P><B>It has been while since I sent my first story and after reading more
of</B>
<BR><B>people's experiences I have started to remember more encounters
that my</B>
<BR><B>family had over the last few decades, some of which I had totally</B>
<BR><B>forgotten about. Here they are.</B>
<BR><B>The Apple</B>
<BR><B>This happened to me when I was very small, maybe five or six, but
I can</B>
<BR><B>remember it as if it was yesterday. We lived in a tall, narrow three</B>
<BR><B>storey house in Chandlers Ford, Hants, UK. My bedroom was on the
top</B>
<BR><B>floor and was not very big.</B>
<BR><B>At the time my grandparents were staying with us. I was about to
go to</B>
<BR><B>bed and asked my parents for something to eat, they gave me a big
juicy</B>
<BR><B>apple which I took up to my bedroom and put on the corner of the</B>
<BR><B>dresser. Remembering that I hadn't kissed my grandparents goodnight
I</B>
<BR><B>left the room, minus the apple and went downstairs.</B>
<BR><B>When I returned about ten minutes after, the apple was gone, no
sign of</B>
<BR><B>it anywhere. At the time I was not really worried, strange really.
My</B>
<BR><B>parents hadn't come upstairs and the only pets we had were Siamese
cats</B>
<BR><B>who were more interested in mice than apples. I never saw that apple</B>
<BR><B>again and up to today I wonder who took it.</B>
<BR><B>Grandma</B>
<BR><B>As I mentioned in my first story, my mother's side of the family
have</B>
<BR><B>had some 'gift' in varying levels.</B>
<BR><B>My grandmother told me two incidences that happened to her after
her</B>
<BR><B>husband (my grandfather) died. The first one was when she was trying
to</B>
<BR><B>open a sliding door in his room. The door was warped due to damp
and you</B>
<BR><B>had to rock it in a certain way to make it slide. My grandmother
was</B>
<BR><B>trying to open it not longer grandfather's death, without much success,</B>
<BR><B>when suddenly it lifted itself and she was able to slide it easily.</B>
<BR><B>The second one happened either before the first one of after it,
I am</B>
<BR><B>not sure when. My grandparents had been married along time and though</B>
<BR><B>they didn't see eye-to-eye sometimes, my grandmother was missing
him a</B>
<BR><B>lot, especially since his death (heart-attack) was unexpected. So
one</B>
<BR><B>day she sat in the living room and wished in her mind to him to
show her</B>
<BR><B>a sign that he was still with her in spirit. I guess she had her
eyes</B>
<BR><B>closed whilst she was doing this because when she opened them a
rose</B>
<BR><B>from a bouquet she had received was lying on the floor. This bouquet
was</B>
<BR><B>in a deep vase and she swears there was no way to it could have
fallen</B>
<BR><B>out of the vase, it would have to had to been physically picked
out and</B>
<BR><B>dropped. Whatever it was, she took this as a sign and also as strength</B>
<BR><B>to get on with her life.</B>
<BR><B>Another incidence I remember related to my grandfather's death is
of my</B>
<BR><B>mother and her sister. If I remember correctly, my grandfather died</B>
<BR><B>quite late in the evening and both his daughters were asleep many
miles</B>
<BR><B>away from his house. My mother remembers waking up that night and</B>
<BR><B>feeling a breeze cross her face, the windows were not open and she
just</B>
<BR><B>knew that her father had died. My aunty however, scoffs at the</B>
<BR><B>paranormal and did not experience a thing.</B>
<BR><B>My grandmother would visit us quite often and once after my</B>
<BR><B>grandfather's death she was babysitting me. I was not that young
but my</B>
<BR><B>parents wanted some kind of house insurance! We were sitting in
the</B>
<BR><B>living room and I was showing her the 'ring on a string' trick.
I don't</B>
<BR><B>know if you know about it but if you get a ring, tie it to a piece
of</B>
<BR><B>string or cotton then hold it and think in you mind a direction
i.e.</B>
<BR><B>clock-wise, the string starts moving in that direction. We used
to fool</B>
<BR><B>around in school and make up stories that if you use so-and-so ring
it</B>
<BR><B>will go faster etc. usual kids stuff. I am not sure how it works
but is</B>
<BR><B>probably your unconscious moving the hand very slightly which in
turn</B>
<BR><B>starts moving the ring. Try it. Anyhow, to the point, we were trying</B>
<BR><B>this and were both concentrating hard. There was no other noise
in the</B>
<BR><B>house and the atmosphere was quite 'heavy', when suddenly my grandmother</B>
<BR><B>looked at me and said 'we are not alone'. I looked around and replied</B>
<BR><B>'huh?' She was again quiet and after sometime got up to the use
the</B>
<BR><B>washroom. I was quite freaked out by this time and went into the
kitchen</B>
<BR><B>for two reasons, one, I was close to the washroom and two, the kitchen</B>
<BR><B>had the most lighting. The only other companion in the house was
our pet</B>
<BR><B>dog. She was in the hall opposite the washroom and without any warning</B>
<BR><B>went into a barking frenzy at the front door, but not at the door,
at a</B>
<BR><B>spot on the ceiling, above the door. I forgot about ghosts and went
to</B>
<BR><B>see who was there. However after seeing how and at where the dog
was</B>
<BR><B>barking, I returned to my freaked out state. The dog was running
forward</B>
<BR><B>towards the door and then suddenly stopping about ten foot away
from it</B>
<BR><B>while continuously barking. I didn't know what to do. My grandmother</B>
<BR><B>came out of the washroom and the dog stopped barking. Not abruptly,
she</B>
<BR><B>would still return to the point and give a few disgruntled yaps
at the</B>
<BR><B>spot. My grandmother asked me what happened and I just feigned</B>
<BR><B>ignorance. There was no one at the front door; my father had built
a</B>
<BR><B>small porch on the front of the house, thereby building a new front</B>
<BR><B>door, which was not the one the dog was barking at. The dog never
acted</B>
<BR><B>like that before or after this incidence in fact she was the quietest</B>
<BR><B>dog I have ever seen but that night she was definitely barking at</B>
<BR><B>something.</B>
<BR><B>Lastly relating to my grandparents is a story my grandfather told
me</B>
<BR><B>when my grandmother and I were telling ghost stories to each other.
He,</B>
<BR><B>like at my aunty, scoffed at the supernatural but told me once that
he</B>
<BR><B>was driving along a lonely country road at night when an owl suddenly</B>
<BR><B>started flying above and in front of the car. He thought nothing
of it</B>
<BR><B>since owls were common in that area, however, this owl stayed above
and</B>
<BR><B>in front of the car for along time, I can't remember how long he
said he</B>
<BR><B>observed it but it was many minutes. He was astonished because owls</B>
<BR><B>don't usually keep on a straight path like that for long, especially</B>
<BR><B>when they are in the high beam of a car. However, his astonishment
was</B>
<BR><B>nothing compared to when the owl just vanished. He said one second
it</B>
<BR><B>was in the cars full beams and the next it was gone. He still wouldn't</B>
<BR><B>admit that it was anything paranormal he just thought it was very</B>
<BR><B>strange!</B>
<BR><B>Office experience</B>
<BR><B>Finally, I want some comments on an experience I had recently (a
few</B>
<BR><B>months ago). I have always been interested in the paranormal and
occult</B>
<BR><B>and every six months I download hundreds of these stories and read
them</B>
<BR><B>- it's like an obsession. The last time I did this was around February,</B>
<BR><B>I was reading loads and loads of ghost encounters tales, looking
at</B>
<BR><B>photos etc. Though I don't usually scare easily, I was beginning
to see</B>
<BR><B>things out the corner of my eye, which I put down to my unconscious</B>
<BR><B>playing tricks on me and I wasn't really worried. However, one evening</B>
<BR><B>after reading a lot of stories I was proceeding up the stairs of
our</B>
<BR><B>office cum residence, not really thinking about ghosts but a bit
on</B>
<BR><B>edge. I was climbing a flight of about twenty-stairs when suddenly</B>
<BR><B>someone tugged on my shirt-tail. Thinking it was a colleague playing
a</B>
<BR><B>trick I turned around with a smile to be faced with empty stairs.
There</B>
<BR><B>was no way my shirt-tail was caught on something since the stairs
are</B>
<BR><B>walled in every direction (except foot and head) and I was about
halfway</B>
<BR><B>up when it happened. Since I was a bit on edge I turned round quickly</B>
<BR><B>and didn't give anyone any time to escape, especially on such awfully</B>
<BR><B>constructed stairs (the ones that the either too short or too long!).</B>
<BR><B>The reason I think it has something with reading stories is that,</B>
<BR><B>firstly, despite all the experiences I have had this is the first</B>
<BR><B>paranormal experience that has 'physically' happened to me in my
adult</B>
<BR><B>life, and I cant find any explanation - even today I can remember
the</B>
<BR><B>tug, like when someone catches a piece of your clothing and tugs
it.</B>
<BR><B>Secondly the building is new, is not built on a graves or holy ground,</B>
<BR><B>nor has anyone died there (though the stairs may rectify that one
soon).</B>
<BR><B>After it happened I started thinking on whether all these ghost
stories</B>
<BR><B>'open' your mind to the paranormal and make people more susceptible
to</B>
<BR><B>encounters. Comments would be welcome.</B>
<BR><B>I have more experiences from my wife's side of the family which
I will</B>
<BR><B>write down in the future. Keep up the good work.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Walnut Experiences..</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: aquastar_skye@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Okay this is kind of long but ill try to sum up as much as i can.&nbsp;
Im half navajo indian and in my culture we are very spiritul.&nbsp; Since
i was little i have always had that six sense.. I know this is stupid but
i mean from like 4 and beyond there were times when my mom would drive
past a cemetary and i would just say something out of the blue or start
crying.&nbsp; There was this one time i was like 9 and we were in san diego.&nbsp;
There is this place down in old town (im sure uve all heard of this place)
thats haunted.&nbsp; I guess the guy was burried head first so he would
go to hell faster.&nbsp; But anyways we walked by it and no one told me
it was suppose to be haunted.&nbsp; The moment i was infront of it i started
screaming get me out of her.. and i broke down crying and to this day I
still cant take walking by that place without breaking down with fear.</B>
<BR><B>Well im 19 now and i moved to walnut california when i was 9.&nbsp;
My brother had just been born and the place we moved into needed alot of
work.&nbsp; I never felt anything before when we first moved in.&nbsp;
The first experience i had in this house was when my brother was 3.&nbsp;
I would have been 12 at the time.&nbsp; I walked past my brother and stopped.&nbsp;
He was talken to the entrance of his walk in closet.&nbsp; Like a full
blown on conversation.&nbsp; Okay a little spooky right.&nbsp; I just kept
on walking.&nbsp; This went on for months.&nbsp; And i would ask him who
are you talken to he would say no one.&nbsp; I kinda just put it behind
me.. So when he was about 5 he came out one night when we were in the living
room and he said "Oh great grandma said she had to leave.. that she couldnt
talk to me anymore."&nbsp; Let me tell you i froze and watched my mom and
dad expressions.. My dad freaked and kept asking what did u say?&nbsp;
(They all knew he talked to his closet by the way).&nbsp; And my mom ran
and got a photo album.&nbsp; She gave it to my brother and asked him to
point out great grandma and without help he searched thru it and sure enough
he pointed and laughed and said "There she is mom!"...</B>
<BR><B>Okay there is this hallway that goes down from the living room that
passes my room and ends at a pantry.&nbsp; Right next to the pantry is
my bros room on the left then my parents and then the garage is on the
right.&nbsp; Down this hall a little after i turned 14 i use to have to
run.&nbsp; I could never walk down the thing without the back of my hair
standing up on my neck or getting goosbumps.&nbsp; I would seriously dread
having to go down there especially since my room is right there.&nbsp;
Thats only the beginning of signs.&nbsp; My cousins came to live with us
that year and i had to share a room with my girl cousin nicole.&nbsp; Her
bed use to face the left corner of the room and one nite she climbed in
bed with me and was shaking.&nbsp; I asked her what happened and she just
turned and hid her face in the pillow.&nbsp; Okay being 14 with a 10 year
old im going hmm this sucks.&nbsp; I brushed it off and went to sleep.&nbsp;
Around sometime before the sun came up i heard like these foot steps going
back and forth across my ceiling.&nbsp; I woke up and stared at my ceiling.&nbsp;
I turned and nicole was doing the same thing. For some reason i thought
it was my ceiling fan so i turned it off and the noise stopped.&nbsp; I
couple seconds after it stopped and i closed my eyes it started again.&nbsp;
and they were loud clanking footsteps.&nbsp; I finally asked nicole what
had made her come in my bed and she told me that she had heard voices in
the wall.</B>
<BR><B>This house is just weird.&nbsp; There has been small things like
my mom and my dad eating dinner and a fork right in the middle of the table
flew off and smacked the side of the wall. There was something with my
dads friend coming over and saying out of the corner of his eye he saw
a shadow and he ran down the hall (we were all out of town and he was watching
the house for us) but noone was there.&nbsp; Trust me we have all seen
the shadows but no on ever wanted to acknowledge it.&nbsp; There was this
one time my dad went away for the weekend and my brother was sleeping on
the couch with my mom.. I was 16 I think so he was 7.. and he woke up with
a start and screamed dad and ran into my room.&nbsp; Okay i woke up cause
my brother was screaming dad and my mom came in and she turned on the light
and she said "dad's on vacation sweetheart." to which my brother replyed..
"No mom i swear i saw dad come in here."&nbsp; Lets say i didnt sleep in
my room that night.&nbsp; Ever since that experience i have slept with
my door shut.</B>
<BR><B>We use to have this Akita.&nbsp; Her name was Blaze and she would
never bark.&nbsp; To those of you who have an Akita you might get this..
If an akita barks you better go see whats up.&nbsp; WEll anyways.&nbsp;
I was sleeping in my room and everyone was asleep.&nbsp; I think this is
when i still slept with the door open.&nbsp; But Blaze ran into my room
barking so loud.&nbsp; I woke up and all the little hairs on my arms stood
up and i started breathing really heavy.&nbsp; I couldnt explain it i just
knew something was there.&nbsp; But Blaze lept onto my bed and layed her
body over mine so that her head layed protectively on my head... I was
so scared i started screaming for my mom but i stopped because Blaze started
growling this sound.. I have never once in my life heard i dog make this
sound but i started crying and blaze raised her head and baired her teeth
to the darkness of the hallway.&nbsp; As soon as my mom came rushing to
my room she lept off of me and ran out my room.&nbsp; My door is now closed
when i sleep.. AS i said before.&nbsp; There were more things like that
with Blaze.&nbsp; She would sit there facing the entrance to the hallway
and her head would just start going from side to side like she was following
something.&nbsp; And then there were sometimes she would just bark at nothing
its really creepy to think about these things.</B>
<BR><B>My mom called the medicine man (now remember im half navajo indian)
and he told us to prepare a meal for the spirit to acknowledge him cause
he was on the path of becoming harmful. So we did that and the very next
day it was gone.&nbsp; I couldnt feel anything scary anymore i could walk
down the hall with ease and everything was just fine, still i sleep with
my door shut.</B>
<BR><B>As of recently, there hasnt been to much but we have 2 labs now,
Sakura and Kasia, Blaze Died, but sometimes they stare at the hallway or
air and just bark.&nbsp; I dont know sometimes i feel things down there
and sometimes i dont.&nbsp; Im not as afraid of it as i was before but
there are times i find myself looking over my shoulder and just taking
deep breathes to get rid of the chill.</B>
<BR><B>I just recently bought a deck of tarrot cards.&nbsp; BAD IDEA!!!!!&nbsp;
I havent touched them cause i dont know i just feel this energy from them.&nbsp;
But the first question i asked the first day i got them in mY house was
is the ghost still here.&nbsp; The tarrot cards told me that if i dont
know what im doing then dont do it at all because i can bring back something
evil..&nbsp; It also said that it was a repressed anger that doesnt want
to be repressed.&nbsp; Let me tell you the day i asked the question the
whole house was cold.&nbsp; I called my mom and she told me to burn sage.&nbsp;
Both me and my friend and my brother now 10 ran around the house burning
sage (sage is suppose to warn off evil) .. after we did that it was gone
so..</B>
<BR><B>Sorry this story was so long i have one more thing to say.&nbsp;
I read this one entry on here by this guy arthodes@broc.com&nbsp; and let
me just say i experienced the same thing.&nbsp; I was 17 i dont know if
i was dreaming or what but i woke up and i swear i felt like this huge
force of energy was standing at the edge of my bed and i couldnt move or
anything I just stared. And i could hear my mom banging the garage door
walking by my room and i kept screaming "MOM HELP!!" but my voice sounded
so far away and i remember just screaming and screaming and trying to move
but i couldnt.. Then it was almost as if as fast as it happened it stopped
and it was like i was pushed back to sleep.. I just remembering turning
my head and closing my eyes.&nbsp; I woke up a couple of hours later told
my mom and she told me i was probably dreaming but after reading that guys
story im not to sure anymore.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ghosts and Hauntings</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:akadole@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Growing up, we lived in an old farm house that was over 100 years
old.&nbsp; It became a common thing for us to see ghosts, hear ghosts,
and to feel an eerie presence in certain rooms of the house and even in
our barn.&nbsp; The ghosts that we saw did not scare us but the eerie feelings
and cold gushes of air in certain rooms did.&nbsp; The ghost I most usually
saw was a young woman with long blonde hair and a long flowing white gown.&nbsp;
I only saw her at night while I was in bed.&nbsp; I would wake up in the
middle of the night to find her standing at the foot of my bed just peacefully
watching me and she had a content smile on her face, I wasn't scared of
her.&nbsp; One time I fell asleep on the floor in my brothers' room and
woke up to see her on her hands and knees looking at me right in the face.&nbsp;
It was like she just wanted to watch over me and make sure I as okay.&nbsp;
I saw her through all of my years at the home, from about the age of 5-16.&nbsp;
My brothers saw her too.&nbsp; On one occasion, the strangest thing happened.&nbsp;
I really don't know if the woman ghost did it or what, but one night I
was scared to sleep in my room for some reason.&nbsp; I went ahead and
fell asleep in my bed and left the light on.&nbsp; I slept great the whole
night.&nbsp; When I woke up, I was laying on my brothers floor on a perfectly
spread out blanket, with my pillow and I was covered up.&nbsp; I was totally
confused, because I could'nt figure out how I got there.&nbsp; I asked
my Mom if she moved me, and she did'nt.&nbsp; My brothers did'nt know either.&nbsp;
I know that I did'nt go in there on my own and I never sleepwalked.&nbsp;
Whether the ghost did it or not, I don't know.&nbsp; The scariest room
in our house was the laundry room.&nbsp; It just had an eerie feeling to
it.&nbsp; We would never go in there by ourselves.&nbsp; We would be putting
clothes in the washer or dryer and would feel a quick gust of cold air
behind us.&nbsp; We could just feel a presence in there, but this one was
scary.&nbsp; We would turn around and nothing would be there.&nbsp; There
was a closet in the laundry room and we would hear the metal hangers rattling
around all by themselves.&nbsp; There was no draft in our laundry room
to explain any of the occurrences.&nbsp; Our bathroom was next to the laundry
room.&nbsp; A couple of times I would be in the shower and would see a
shadow through the curtain.&nbsp; I would open it, and no one would be
there.&nbsp; It got to be so scary, that even as we got older, my brothers
and I would leave the bathroom door open when we took a shower.&nbsp; There
are so many things that happened there, it would take me hours to tell
you everything.&nbsp; I just wanted to tell you about a few of them.&nbsp;
I was glad to discover your website.&nbsp; I will write again sometime
and tell you more.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Life</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: s0505846@monmouth.edu</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have never really seen a ghost
and i do not think my house is</B>
<BR><B>haunted but i have had strange experiances. The first one i can</B>
<BR><B>remember is my freshamn summer into my sophmore year i woke to find</B>
<BR><B>my mom( or so i thought) standing in the door way, she was wearing</B>
<BR><B>a gray dress which i thought was odd. I wasnt afraid at all and</B>
<BR><B>wanted to greet her,but i realized that i couldnt move my arms,</B>
<BR><B>legs and did not have the ability to speak. When i finally had</B>
<BR><B>mobility my mom had vanished, and i suddenly got the chills but</B>
<BR><B>fell asleep shortly after that. I called my mom later on that day</B>
<BR><B>to ask her is she had visited me and she said no, all she could
say</B>
<BR><B>though was " grandmom".</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I kind of wrote it off and
never thought about until juinor year. I</B>
<BR><B>had to get up for school real early when once again i felt myself</B>
<BR><B>in that strange immobile state. I could see i was in a green room</B>
<BR><B>and i felt a woman over me taking care of me.I had the impression</B>
<BR><B>that i&nbsp; was in a hospital. I kept saying to myself that my
brother</B>
<BR><B>was hurt worse than i was. Anyways i rolled out of bed and lazily</B>
<BR><B>got into the shower. As i was in the act of doing this i thought
to</B>
<BR><B>myself, why am i going to school? i was just in an accident. Later</B>
<BR><B>that day at work i told my coworker about the dream. Anyways sure</B>
<BR><B>enough a few days later i was in the hospital, in a green room and</B>
<BR><B>my brother was hurt worse than i was. Right then and there i knew</B>
<BR><B>that i had been saved by some fate.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next
summer after i had graduated from high school i had</B>
<BR><B>some dreams that scared the crap out of me. The first one i was</B>
<BR><B>in that immobile state ( but totally aware) and i heard a loud</B>
<BR><B>buzzing noise almost like a fly. I had those awful feeling that</B>
<BR><B>something was in my room. As soon i was able to move the feeling</B>
<BR><B>was gone. The next dream i had was the day after a kind of</B>
<BR><B>spiritual awakening where i had began to realize that god truly</B>
<BR><B>existed. Anyways that day i had blown off the whole</B>
<BR><B>experiance as being just stupid thoughts. Then when i was taking
a nap</B>
<BR><B>suddenly i was in that state again. I heard the loud buzzing noise
once</B>
<BR><B>again but this time it followed a guy's voice calling my name. He
asked me</B>
<BR><B>if i had ever met my grandfather and i replied in my head ( i was
unable</B>
<BR><B>to speak) that i had not because he had died almost 40 years before
me. I</B>
<BR><B>was trying desperately to move my hands so i could not concentrate
on what</B>
<BR><B>he was saying. Then i heard him yell at me about the accident with
me and</B>
<BR><B>my brother and then he said YOU COULD HAVE SUFFERED FROM A COMA!
Right</B>
<BR><B>after that i was mobile&nbsp; and ran straight to my mom&nbsp; and
told her. She was</B>
<BR><B>freaked out and asked me if i was doing anything stupid to get me</B>
<BR><B>hurt...like possibly it was a warning. I thought no not really but
i knew</B>
<BR><B>in my heart i was being bad that summer. After that i believed in
god.</B>
<BR><B>After that i was afraid to go to sleep. A few weeks after that I
was</B>
<BR><B>asleep and during my dream i heard all these voices calling my name
and</B>
<BR><B>telling me to let go. i was suddenly aware that i was in my room
again</B>
<BR><B>but floating up towards my ceiling!&nbsp; It gave me a sudden euphoric
feeling</B>
<BR><B>like a warm ruch of waves come over me. Finally i thought where
am i going</B>
<BR><B>and all of the sudden i was back on my bed. I was so freaked out
that i</B>
<BR><B>couldnt go back to sleep and i called my friend and he said his
mom had</B>
<BR><B>plenty of out of body experiances. Another dream i had while napping</B>
<BR><B>during the day. I felt myself being carried around my room and then
placed</B>
<BR><B>back on my bed. Then i felt people touching me ( like in inappropiate</B>
<BR><B>places ) and i felt so violated and all i wanted to do was scream
"mommy!"</B>
<BR><B>but of course i couldn't. Then i looked at whoever it was and it
was two</B>
<BR><B>teenage guys one beside me and one holding down my legs. I saw the</B>
<BR><B>expresion on the guys face that was holding me down and it was like
pure</B>
<BR><B>evil. I realized that dream was the replay of a night that may have</B>
<BR><B>happenend to me ( i had passed out). It was like a sign to me that
it did</B>
<BR><B>happen, After that i decided to totally change my life style and
stop</B>
<BR><B>running with a dangerous crowd.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know my
dreams seem a little odd but i credit them to changing</B>
<BR><B>my life, i often wonder if it isnt someone from above giving me</B>
<BR><B>a warning or maybe just my inner most conscious reaching out to</B>
<BR><B>save myself. Now i have a some dreams that are a little odd like</B>
<BR><B>i feel people kisssing me and things but i am much more relaxed</B>
<BR><B>now and do not get scared. I tell myself they are just a dream</B>
<BR><B>state( i cant really say deam because they are totally different</B>
<BR><B>feeling from one) and i will wake up.</B>

<BR><B>Mudhouse Mansion</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ramones_chik@yahoo.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I went to visit "mudhouse mansion" in Fairfield County Ohio. My friends
and i heard scratching on the door to the brick building along with loud
sharp noises (as though someone was being struck with a whip) and screams.
Once we got inside we heard screams and what sounded like a little boy
crying, in a downstairs bedroom, we are assuming it was a bedroom. As we
were walking up one set of stairs we heard a noise as though someone or
something was falling down another set of stairs. Also there is a white
house next which is boarded up pretty tightly except upstairs. In the upstairs
portion of the house, it appears there was a door leading to an outside
balcony or something. As we were leaving Mudhouse Mansion we saw a lady
in a pink night gown watching us from the door less doorway.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Melissa</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: louveciennes@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My friend Melissa is an otherwise completely normal girl who just
happens to have a few rather unusual aspects, two of which are the presences
in her house. I hesitate to use the word 'psychic',since it conjours up
stereotypes of heavily made-up women with crystal balls, but she displays
an uncanny ability to know things she has no way of knowing;whether or
not that has any bearing on the situation in her house remains to be seen.
The house is in no way unusual and features three bedrooms, a screened-in
porch and a lovely yard. Melissa and her boyfriend occupy one bedroom,the
second is used for storage, and the third is used for absolutely nothing,
because no one who goes in there can stand to be in there for longer than
a minute.Never mind the fact that the lights in the room and the hall will
either flicker on and off, or go completely on/off, regardless of the position
of the switch the minute anyone steps into the room,our money is on the
heavy,resentful presence that permeates the room as being the thing that
drives people out.We don't go in there unless a guest expresses doubts
and insists on being allowed to see for themselves,and they inevitably
do.Oddly,the feeling doesn't extend past the door,but she keeps it locked
and closed,just in case. I spend a lot of time over at their place,and
I often will spend a whole weekend there with them.One night, I began to
notice movements out of the corners of my eyes when I was sitting on the
couch in the living room and Melissa was in kitchen.Since I have several
cats of my own,I recognized that it was the motions of a cat,walking proudly
about its home and happy with its tail held high.'Oh, it's just her little
dark cat',I thought absentmindedly to myself...how silly to have forgotten
about the cat......only then I remembered that she doesn't have a cat,dark-furred
or otherwise.Thinking I was just tired,I dismissed it.A few days later,in
the middle of the day,it happened again,and this time I mentioned it to
her.She was relieved to hear that she wasn't hallucinating,or if she was,then
we both were,and confided that she notices the small,dark(she thinks it's
a chocolate brown)cat quite often,usually when her boyfriend was away or
when she was otherwise alone in the house,and always in the living room.It
brought with it a cheering,calming feeling, and as time progressed her
boyfriend and some other friends noticed it,too. Her theory is that it
is there to counteract whatever lurks in the unused bedroom,and she's even
purchased cat toys in an effort to keep it around - yes,it 'plays' with
the toys.If we're in the kitchen,or on the porch, we can hear the jingle
of the ball with a bell inside coming from the living room,and the toys
never stay in the same place.I know that most people would probably be
horrified by such a casual attitude to an actice presence in a house,but
she and I both grew up in haunted houses that had much more than an ominous
room and a friendly,invisible pet,although those are other stories.Maybe
it is something about us that attracts these events!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Haunted house on Anderson Hill</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Ladydarkelfprinces@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This happened in Port Orchard Washington.&nbsp; I was about 13 years
old and we</B>
<BR><B>had just moved into an older house on Anderson Hill Rd.&nbsp; My
parents had left</B>
<BR><B>for the day and I was down in the living room, thinking about stoking
up a</B>
<BR><B>fire, when I heard people talken and laughing up stairs.&nbsp; I
already&nbsp; knew</B>
<BR><B>that no one was up there, because no one else lived with us, but
I had to go</B>
<BR><B>check anyway and of course no one was up there just like I knew.&nbsp;
Now I was</B>
<BR><B>feeling double sure that I was dealing with some ghosty beings.
I didn't run</B>
<BR><B>out of the house or freak out, but instead I went back down the
stairs and</B>
<BR><B>into the living room and sat in a chair to listen again.&nbsp; Sure
enough, the</B>
<BR><B>muffled conversation started up again and the laughing was more
intense as</B>
<BR><B>if somebody up stairs found something awfully funny.&nbsp; You could
hear a</B>
<BR><B>womans voice quite clearly layughing and commenting, as well as
the low</B>
<BR><B>sounds of a mans voice here and there in the ghostly conversation.&nbsp;
I was</B>
<BR><B>completely convinced now that I had just had the ghost experiance
of the</B>
<BR><B>century.&nbsp; That is until later that week.&nbsp; I had mentioned
to my parents what</B>
<BR><B>I had experianced and my Dad said that he had - had the very same</B>
<BR><B>experiance. Well a few nights had went by, and then on about the
third or</B>
<BR><B>fourth night of living there, something came into my room and sat
on the end</B>
<BR><B>of my bed that night when I was just about to fall asleep.&nbsp;
I could feel the</B>
<BR><B>weight of it sink my bed down.&nbsp; I was too scared to move so
I pulled the</B>
<BR><B>covers over my head and just layed there.&nbsp; Next it tried to
pull my covers</B>
<BR><B>off.&nbsp; I held onto the covers because I was scared to death.
(This girl did</B>
<BR><B>not want to get into a cat fight with something that she could not
whip!)</B>
<BR><B>It stopped pulling on my covers and picked up the end of my bed.&nbsp;
I only had</B>
<BR><B>a light twin bed and so picking it up would have been easy for even
me,(</B>
<BR><B>which was about a 95 pound small boned girl, who thought she could
whip king</B>
<BR><B>kong at the time.)&nbsp; I was small but strong and fiesty. I truly
was not</B>
<BR><B>afraid of much back then, but this thing was SCARY!&nbsp; It picked
the bed up so</B>
<BR><B>high, at the foot of my bed, that I was at a slant and I felt like
I was</B>
<BR><B>about to stand on my head.&nbsp; I was so scared that I couldn't
even scream.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>was intencely afraid that I was going to come face to face with
the ghost or</B>
<BR><B>what ever it was, and I didn't know how to deal with it, much less
hurt it</B>
<BR><B>and make it go away.&nbsp; Anyway my big bad whip ass attitude turned
into a</B>
<BR><B>puppyish whimper and some fast running into my parents room.&nbsp;
I know I must</B>
<BR><B>have looked like a streak of lighting going into my parents room,
cause I</B>
<BR><B>was running full speed.&nbsp; The worst thing about the whole entire
thing was my</B>
<BR><B>mom didn't want to believe me.&nbsp; She hunted for every excuse
that she could</B>
<BR><B>find to make me sleep in that room again, but I never did!&nbsp;
My Dad believed</B>
<BR><B>me though, and he made it a point to move! (smart man)&nbsp; I think
my Mom</B>
<BR><B>didn't want to believe it because it would have made her world just
too</B>
<BR><B>complicated.&nbsp; She would have had to admit that everything in
the world is</B>
<BR><B>not so cut and dry and that it's not always as some would have you
believe.</B>
<BR><B>We live in a world that definately has things going on in it that
doesn't</B>
<BR><B>always meet the eye.</B>

<P><B>Green Orb out of my Shirt</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: anglys5@charter.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>On the 30th of July 2003 , my friend and I were in the basement of
my house and the time was around 11 p.m. and we decided that we were going
to go to bed and so we turned out the lights and I said that '' I don't
think that I can sleep in my shirt,'' so I took off my shirt and a green
light or an orb came out of my shirt and all that I seen was a bright light
out of nowhere and it was pitch black in my basement and my friend said
''what in the hell was that''and I said I don't know. We turned the t.v.
back on to see if someone was trying to play a joke on us ,but then I remembered
that we were the only ones in the house except for my mom and she was in
her room sleeping. So we forgot about it utill the morning time. When we
woke up I called my mom at work and before I told her any thing she told
me about what happened at my grandma's house the night before. It was that
2 of her clocks that wind up where not running and she set one of the clocks
for 10p.m. and she said to my grandpa which is dead ''Jerry I have to set
your clock'' and all of a sudden the other clock that was not running,rung
11 times.</B>
<BR><B>Which was the real time,11 o'clock. But before my mom said any thing
about the time, I told her what happened and then she asked me what time
that all of this occurred at and I told her around 11, she started yelling
to my grandma the time it happened. We think that all of this happened
from my grandpa in which he died in late January of this year. This is
a true story!!!</B><B></B>

<P><B>When my son was between the ages of 18 months to almost 3 years we
lived in a very old house. He NEVER slept through the night when we lived
in that house.&nbsp; He would wake up about every half hour and he'd be
screaming. He would sleep if I sat out on the porch with him, or if I drove
in the car, but never when we lived in the house.&nbsp; We eventually sold
the house and decided to move when he was almost 3. At this time was able
to say some words. He began to tell me about the "Grandpa man" who was
in his (my son's) room. The Grandpa man would always tell him(my son) to
get out of his(grandpa man) room. We were told by locals that the hysband
of the woman who owned the house, had passed away in the house.</B>
<BR><B>We slept on the living room floor the last two weeks before we moved,
and it was a little better, but the first night in our new house, he slept
all night.&nbsp; Consequently, my mother died in the early morning hours
of that same day.</B>
<BR><B>Later I had a call from the new owners of the house asking me what
we had done to the electricity in one of the bedrooms. Of course they were
referring to my son's old room. I told her that we had updated the wiring
in the entire house (and we had) it was all new so there would be no reason
for the electricity to not work. She told me that not one light or outlet
worked in that room.</B>
<BR><B>I don't know much more after that, but I still get goose bumps when
I tell anyone this story. I have also had some personal experiences with
visitations...but one story at a time</B>

<P><B>Some people out there are going to read this story and think what
a load of rubbish but this one isn't i assure you. when my mum was growing
up at my nans house ( my nan has lived in the same house for 30 years and
is still living here!) she had the little room (now spare) above the kitchen.
one night when she was about 12 she felt really hot so she opened the curtains
to open the window when she looked at the end of the garden in next door
there was a white man in a nightie sort of dress you know what they wore
back in the olden days night gowns with a spotted hankie chief over his
eye he wasn't in my nans garden he was in next doors garden looking over
like the woss my mum is she screamed. my nan and grandad ran up stairs
and my mum told them what she saw (may I tell you this isn't the only sighting)
my nan truthfully couldn't see it but my grandad replied to my mum very
shocked don't be so bloody stupid and shut the curtains ever so quickly
he shut the window and told my mum and nan to come down stairs. about just
after that expieriance my uncle was born kevin (now 15) and I also have
another uncle andrew (now 25 then 22). when kevin was 13 he woke up and
to ckeck if if he had got in from a night out he looked in the mirror and
there a man with a long grey beard and a hat and a long brown coat with
his arms folded looking at andrew he just pulled his cover over his head
and went back to sleep. then a couple of weeks after he was telling his
friend leeroy about him&nbsp; and he said don't be so bloody stupid there
is no such thing as ghosts then when they were doing there hair in the
same mirror he appeared again i can't tell you what they said it is to
rude. he appeared again in a smaller version so it comes to show they can
her and see every movement so just be careful what you say and what you
see</B>

<BR><B>Ghost Dog</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Wired4zac@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I once had a friend who lived with her grandmother in a rundown neighborhood
and the house behind her had been abandoned since the owner was arrested
for animal abuse. The man had left a dog chain in the backyard, where he
had once tied the dogs he killed them. One day Stacey and her grandma heard
a dog barking in the house out back and then a heavy chain being carried
into the old house. They followed the noise all the way to the attack where
it growed and dissapeared. All of a sudden the door slammed and locked,
they were trapped in that attic for 3 hours before the door opened. It
was said that the man buried all the animals under th attic floorboards
and buried in the basement. Oh yeah this isn't just a ghost story it happend.</B>

<P><B>Gas Station</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: MamaSmirf1279@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I'm back. And these ghost stories that I'm starting to remember has
came back to mind. Well, it was few years ago, my little bro and I were
coming home from watching a movie. I really had to use the restroom and
I told my bro to stop at a gas station (I know it's disgusting but MAN
I had to go!) Finally, we got to a station and I went to do my business.
All of a sudden, someone was knocking on the door. I told them that I was
in here, can you please wait. Again they knocked but it was more harder,
and I said again 'can you wait, I'm in here!' Then, whoever (probably kids
or teenagers), was trying to get in and was knocking even more harder.
I had screamed at the top of my lungs, 'SOMEONE'S IN HERE. PLEASE WAIT!!'
It kept doing it and doing it. As I was washing my hands, finally, I got
out of the bathroom and looked around to see if there was anyone waiting
to use the restroom! NO ONE WAS AROUND. My bro's car was facing the restroom,
so he will know. I got in the car and I asked him if there was anyone at
the door I was in. He told me there was NO ONE there! I was like OOoooK!
But the funny thing was, I saw the shadows when I was in the bathroom and
it was daylight out! Oh yea, the cementary was across the street! *lol*
It didn't accord to me that it was a ghost or it was haunted!</B>

<P><B>Friends Apartment</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:deepenthemystery@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This summer (2003), I stayed in an apartment with two friends of
mine while we worked at our college in southern Illinois.&nbsp; It's a
fairly new place, with two bedrooms (one upstairs, one downstairs) and
a loft upstairs, which is where I stayed.&nbsp; My boyfriend also came
over to visit a lot.&nbsp; One night, we were up in the loft and both of
us happened to be looking into the upstairs bedroom (my roommates weren't
home- they never were for any of this).&nbsp; Near the ceiling, we saw
a very odd flash of light.&nbsp; It wasn't like a truck or car driving
by or the computer clicking off.&nbsp; It was a sudden, isolated flash
of light.&nbsp; If it had just been me, I would have thought that my eyes
were just adjusting to the dark or something, but both of us saw it.</B>
<BR><B>About two weeks later, I was downstairs in the living room area.&nbsp;
My boyfriend was outside and I was sitting, facing down the hallway that
led to the bathroom and other bedroom.&nbsp; I looked up and saw the exact
same burst of light right where the shadows in the hall started.&nbsp;
A week or so later, my boyfriend was in the apartment alone.&nbsp; He was
standing in the bathroom with the door open and looked out to see the same
burst of light in the same place I saw it, but at a different angle.</B>
<BR><B>A week before we moved out for the summer, we were lying down in
the loft.&nbsp; Occasionally in the apartment (and nowhere else), my body
would jerk spasmodically right as I started to relax.&nbsp; I don't know
if it's just a muscle spasm, but it only happens there.&nbsp; That night,
it happened again, but my boyfriend jumped at the same time. He said it
felt like someone had put their hands on his back and pushed him.&nbsp;
Again, my roommates were gone.</B>
<BR><B>I only talked to one of them about it and he said he hadn't felt
or seen anything like it.&nbsp; It never felt threatening, only strange,
so I'm moving back there in a few weeks for the school.&nbsp; I don't know
what any of that was, but it was merely odd.</B>

<BR><B>Footsteps</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Freestylepimps@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>It was about 1:20 when i was bearly going to bed. I had just finished
going to sleep when all of a sudden I heard heavy footsteps coming from
the living room. At first they were light and far away but they became
heavier and sounded alot closer as it approached to my room. At that time
I still had my eyes closed so then I heard the footsteps stop in front
of my door so I opened my eyes and looked up at the ceiling.I got to see
a shadowy figure standing in my door. At first I thought it was my mother
because she wears black to go to sleep but then when i was bearly going
to look, I closed my eyes so that i could surprise her by turning very
fast. When I did that I looked and nobody was there anymore. I stood up
and went to check but nobody had left my mothers room that night. the reason
i know that is because her door was still locked and when it is, that means
nobody had gone out.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Fear</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Spritzgoddess@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Sorry, this is kinda long...:O) Forgive me, I just had to share.</B>
<BR><B>My ghost stories are not scary, no mysterious hand prints on the
wall, or knocking on the door. But they are in fact real. See, when I was
a freshman in high school, I got my first glimpse of my ability to actually
sense ghosts presence. I was watching the MTV's program called FEAR. (Where
real people would be given the task of visiting haunted places (like abandoned
prisons, human slaughter houses, murder sites etc...places that people
had suffered in one way or the other) and they would have to do certain
things at each site. Such as having to sit by themself, in the dark, for
4 hours, cut off from any communication what-so-ever. If they decided to
do it, and got through without giving up, they would go back to the main
building where everyone else was and they would then give another assignment
to the next member of the team. It doesnt sound to bad, but watching it
was amazing because they would be put through horrifying experiences. One
woman actually had to be put in a coffin and buried alive for 6 or so hours!
) Well, after watching it for the first time, I decided to go to bed. Stupid
thing to do. Before I could even close my eyes, I heard something that
was right behind me. And I thought it was my mom, but I turned to look
and there was nothing. But the sound didnt stop. It kept getting closer.
I closed my eyes trying to make it go away, but it wouldnt stop. Then this
feeling came over me like I was completely surrounded by something bad.
I ran into my mom's room and told her what was going on. She tried to comfort
me, but it didnt help. So, like any child needing a mother when they're
scared,&nbsp; I crawled into her bed and held on to her the whole night.
Still feeling that something was behind me. I didnt sleep at all that night.
At 5 or 6 in the morning I finally fell asleep. And when I woke up, I had
bruises on my arms and legs that werent there the night before, and when
I talked to my mom, she said that I didnt stop shaking the whole entire
time. That was experience #1. My second experience didnt come until the
next year, again in my room. My sister and I are 14 years apart, and I
never really see her. So when she decided to come stay with us for awhile
I couldnt be happier. She also brought her 3 kids, who at the time were
all under the age of 8. It was probably the second night she was there,
everything in the house was quite and well. The kids were downstairs sleeping
and my sister and brother -in- law were sleeping in the room next to the
kids, while I was upstairs in my room. About 3 in the morning, I awoke
to a young boy holding my hand, only the boy was pale white, and kind of
transparent. But I was still half asleep, so I didnt acknowledge it at
the time. I thought it was my 4 year old nefew. He told me that he was
scared he was going to die, so I told him that he wasnt going to die, and
to crawl up in bed next to me so that he'd feel safe. He then quickly got
into my bed and fell asleep. The next morning my bed was empty next to
me, so I figured that he had gone downstairs for some breakfast. So downstairs
I went, but when I got there, all the kids were still sleeping, my nefew
was in the room with my sister, fast asleep in her arms. Later, when everyone
was up, I went up to him and asked him if he was ok now, and if he needed
to sleep in my bed again. He gave me this blank stare and turned to my
sister, who also had a blank stare on her face. What she said, and I'll
never forget this, "Lizzy, he was in my bed the whole night."</B>
<BR><B>We finally figured it out though, my sister had wanted to have a
baby a fews years back, but had problems while carrying the child, and
it died. But she said that it was born on it's expected date as a ghost
and was staying with her, growing up just as an alive person would. Our
guess is that it came with her on her visit with me, and decided that it
was time he got to know his "would have been" aunt.</B>
<BR><B>Ever since those two episodes, I have been able to see things, such
as ghosts ( the one I see actually looks as though its made of soap, the
colored, metallic, shiny bubbles. But in the form of a person.</B>
<BR><B>It's my grandfather, we figured out. He died in my house. And that
another ghost story that I've heard about a million times. My dog at the
time actually witnessed him dying, and they say that when he died, my dog
looked up and then looked as though he was following a light across the
ceiling and out the door. Although, he didnt leave entirely because I still
get a sense he's in the room with me.</B>
<BR><B>Anyways, thanks for reading my entirely long story... I'm glad I
can tell someone. :O)</B>
