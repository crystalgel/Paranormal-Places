My Mother&#8217;s Story<br>
&nbsp;<br>
By: alkavariel@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
My mother and her sisters had many interesting paranormal events
throughout their lives. My Aunt D has pronounced precognitive
abilities. The ability to sense spirits has passed down to my female
cousins and their daughters; all on my mother&#8217;s side of the family.
When my mother was a young girl, a bedridden neighbor would call for
her sister (my Aunt D) to come over to help her with whatever. I don&#8217;t
mean call her on the phone, I mean shout for my Aunt D through the open
windows of the two houses. After the neighbor passed, you can probably
guess what happened. My mom and her two sisters (Aunt D and Aunt M)
were sitting close to the open window on a hot summer&#8217;s day when all
three heard the neighbor shouting for my Aunt D. They didn&#8217;t go running
over to the deceased neighbor&#8217;s house, they ran for their mother.<br>

Newfoundland Ghosts: Canada<br>
<br>
By: stizzard@shaw.ca <br>
<br>
Having experienced a ghost firsthand (turn of the 20th century home,
Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada), I believed my Mother's
tale of my Grandmother's experience in a haunted house.<br>
Many years ago, during the 1950's, my Grandmother sat young children to
earn some extra money.&nbsp; A Doctor and his family recently moved
into an existing house in a community near where my Grandmother lived
(Portugal Cove, NFLD).&nbsp; I do not know the history of this house,
however, suffice to say it was considered a new home in its time.<br>
My Grandmother had a Gift.&nbsp; She had abilty to percieve more than
what was physically apparent.&nbsp; My Mother has this gift, as do I
and now my oldest son is beginning to manifest this gift as well. (it
starts as dreams of events yet to happen...)&nbsp; We don't understand
nor control this ability, it just seems to happen. <br>
One evening my Grandmother went to nanny 2 toddlers for the evening
while the Doctor and his wife attended a Christmas party.&nbsp; While
looking after the children, my Grandmother noted physical and auditory
manifestations.&nbsp; For example, she could hear a baby crying as if
it were in the next room, however, no baby was present in this
house.&nbsp; She recalled being physically &amp; aggressively pushed
about.&nbsp; She heard a woman's screams, and a man's loud
argumentative voice.&nbsp; She was, however, the only adult in the
house.<br>
The young children awoke amongst the noise.&nbsp; She related that out
of fear, and her desire to protect the scared children, she locked them
and herself in a wardrobe closet and deadbolted the door from the
inside.&nbsp; The security was shortlived as the lock unbolted and the
door flew open by themselves.&nbsp; She ran outside with the children
in tow.&nbsp; As she ran outside, she saw all the Christmas decorations
strewn about the living room, and that the cross hung on the wall had
been oriented upsidedown.&nbsp; The cross should not have remained this
way as it was fixed to the wall with a nail at the top of the
cross.&nbsp; The weight of the cross should have corrected its inverted
orientation, but it did not and held fast.<br>
As she ran out the front door with the children, the electric lights in
the house went out she recalled hearing the horrible wails of a woman
and the screams of a young baby.<br>
The family who lived there moved out 2 months later.&nbsp; The families
before and after also did not remain in the house long.&nbsp; She
stated one night, after the house had been abandoned for some time, it
burned to the ground.<br>
In a separate incident, my Grandmother recalls helping a homeless man
during the Great Depression.&nbsp; She heard a knock on her back door
and when she opened the door, a ragged man stood on her stoop and asked
if she could spare some food on a cold winter night.&nbsp; My
Grandfather was not a socially amicable man, and would chase such
persons away.&nbsp; My Grandmother, however, had a good heart.&nbsp; On
this night, she bade the man come inside.&nbsp; She recalled that she
instinctively felt no fear of him.&nbsp; She told him to sit at the
table while she gave him her portion of what would have been her supper
that night.&nbsp; My Grandfather was still at work.&nbsp; My
Grandmother hurried the man along fearing that my Grandfather would
come home and cause a ruckus if he saw the homeless man at his table
eating his food!.&nbsp; After the man ate, he thanked my Grandmother
for her kindness and stated that he would remember her.&nbsp; He also
called her by her name.<br>
My Grandmother then heard my Grandfather in the driveway and quickly
shooed the man out the back door.&nbsp; My Grandfather was none the
wiser, as my Grandmother explained the dishes on the table by way of
her eating early.<br>
As my Grandfather went to change for supper, my Grandmother recalled
that she nervously opened the back door of the house to ensure that the
man had left.&nbsp; <br>
As she looked out the back door and glanced upon the fresh snow, she
noted that no footprints were present where the man had just stood and
walked minutes ago.&nbsp; It was at this momemt that she also realized,
she had never told the stranger her name.<br>

Black Shadows<br>
<br>
By: jwgray@erols.com <br>
<br>
<br>
In the three incidents they were all benevolent and helped me and others out of bad situations.<br>
Your article confirms for me that others have had this experience as well. I don't feel as crazy.<br>
There were three incidents involving 3 people at different times and
places not until I told my story did they come-forth with their similar
experiences my boss and my daughters boyfriend . I wonder how wide
spread this black human shape experience is?<br>
My daughters boyfriend had a head on collision a couple of days ago. <br>
Both he and the oncoming car driven by a 90 year old man. No one was
injured everyone walked away.&nbsp; The boyfriend said he saw this
black shape sitting on the hood of a car that very morning as if to
watch over him.<br>
My Boss when he was younger and wilder approached a drug dealer with 2
of his friends to tease him and make him feel uncomfortable about being
in their neighborhood. The dealer produced a gun and began to fire and
chase them when they got to a field they split.&nbsp; As by boss was
running he said that he saw many of these shapes rise up from the field
and flank him and accompany him as if to guard him.<br>
I had lost a tent on the way home from a beach trip.&nbsp; I had it
strapped down on the top of my car.&nbsp; The family was asleep in the
car. I had crossed a very large bridge and I noticed that the flapping
of the straps were not present I pulled over to inspect the tent.<br>
As I was pulled over and before I could get out a car pulled up and
asked me if I had lost something?&nbsp; How would they know that? or to
ask that besides people don't pull over for other people on a major
interstate.&nbsp; They said they thought there was a tent about 2 miles
or so back on the road.&nbsp; They pulled away I checked and sure
enough the tent was gone and I was in a state of confusion I sat their
being weirded out for a few minutes. Then of all things another car
pulls up and tells me that my tent is just back on that bridge I just
crossed.&nbsp; <br>
I am just on the other side of the bridge pulled over.&nbsp; I am
trying to reconcile how one report places it 2 miles away on the road
and another report places it on the bridge behind me and the even odder
reports themselves why would these people pull over and tell me this?
They were<br>
4 or 5 minutes apart leaving me to believe even if one had been an
eyewitness they both could not have been? Maybe there was more than one
tent lost on the road that day? Anyway I decided since the bridge was
right there and the family was still asleep I would just go check the
bridge for my self not wanting my tent to reek havoc with
traffic.&nbsp; As I approached the bridge I noticed a small white
moving truck pull over on the bridge with no markings.&nbsp; They
pulled of so as not to impede the traffic on the bridge several of
these wispy black human figures got out and grabbed and heave hoed what
looked to be a tent over the railing and off the bridge. Quickly got
back into the truck and merged effortlessly back into impossible
traffic from a stand still and continued on its way I was to freaked to
look at it as it went by. I looked back at where I knew it had pulled
over but there was no place to pull over. I walked back to my car in
shock.&nbsp; My family was still asleep the idea then occurred to me.
My Tent! Its now just under that bridge.&nbsp; I went to look for it
scoured everywhere but it was no where to be found I had had enough of
this bizarreness and walked back to the car and got in waking my
wife.&nbsp; She asked what's the matter why are we pulled over.&nbsp; I
couldn't explain then I think I just said something like I think we
lost the tent oh well lets get on home.<br>
I get the feeling that they are guardian Angels looking out after us and protecting others from our unwitting actions.<br>
They just look so disturbing, yet I cannot match their appearance to their actions.<br>

Roses and Grandma<br>
<br>
By: navy_girl02130@yahoo.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
My name is Kathleen. I'm 21 and the following is my experience.<br>
I was spending the summer with my fiancee and his parents. My bedroom
was right next to David's and across the hall from his parents'. We had
come home from a wedding reception late one night and I walked upstairs
to change into some comfy clothes before David and I watched a movie.
The hallway was dark and I hadn't bothered to turn the light on, as I
knew my way around pretty well. I opened my bedroom door and felt
somewhat uneasy. Then, it felt as if something stepped through me. I
never saw anything, but I did smell roses. I had no roses in my
bedroom, nor did I have a rose-scented candle or perfume. It didn't
make sense to me, but I knew that something had just entered my room. I
slept with David from then on. The next day in church, I was sitting in
the pew right next to my fiancee and I smelled the roses again. There
was a floral arrangement at the front of the church, but it consisted
of carnations. That night, as I was getting out of the shower, I felt
as if someone were in the small bathroom with me, but knew that it
wasn't true. I moved over to the mirror once I was dressed and started
brushing my hair. All of a sudden, I saw an old lady's face looking at
me in the mirror. However, I wasn't scared. She had a very
grandmotherly look to her and a kind smile on her face. Over the course
of the summer, I kept smelling the roses faintly whenever I would go
and especially when I went to my room. Just before I left, I asked
David if anyone in his family loved roses. He told me that roses were
his dead grandmother's fa rite flower. She always planted them every
spring, wore rose-scented perfume and gave them away as gifts to people
she loved. I told him what had happened and he told me that these same
experiences happened to his sister-in-law, too. The family believes
that it's his grandmother's way of saying from the other side that she
knows I truly love David and she's accepted me into the family. Sorry
it's not scary!<br>

Taylor City Michigan-Haunted House.<br>
<br>
By: jakethesnake1@comcast.net <br>
<br>
I live in a small house with my parents in Taylor City, State Of
Michigan, (Address &amp; Directions Not Necesary) that is basically
made of concrete blocks with yellow aluminum siding that is about 40-45
years old or so with not ten rooms or more in it, that has been in the
family since it was built. A fairly cozy little house but up until
about 2 years or so ago it appeared "haunted", the "hauntings"
strangely stopped just weeks after my grandfather died of cancer,
making this an Ex- Haunted House of sorts.&nbsp; But back when it was
"haunted" though, strange things would happen. Once I was watching TV
and the phone rang, I went and checked the caller ID and my own houses
number was on the screen. I of course didn't pick up that phone. Not
quiet sure how sugnificant that is though. Another time I tried to go
to the bathroom when (As crazy as it sounds) a black mist went right
past me. Dazed &amp; confused from just awakening I thought it was the
old 'eye's ajusting' thing, until the bathroom door slammed &amp;
locked in my face, of course, unlocking the second I stumbled back into
my bed room in fright. But normally it was small things like cold spots
and oddly enough hearing a small bell go off in my closet, even though
it was very much empty for a time &amp; blocked up by old junk.
Sometimes I'd see shadows fly past my bedroom door when it was opened,
usually after 10 PM. I do have dogs but the thing is, the shadows were
man sized and moved fairly fast and these are miniature collies, not
even below the knee caps in height. A few more sugnificant things have
happened here though. <br>
Covers sliding off of you in the middle of the night, and if the covers
were pulled over your head and you are on your side, you might see a
hand print press down in front of your face, threw the blanket as if
someone was leaning over you. It all started occuring after my
grandmothers death, nearly 10 years ago but didn't actually start until<br>
6 to 7 years after her demise. On a side note, when the house was still
disturbingly haunted, it would still only target loners. If you were
alone in the house or by yourself or even a few rooms away from
everyone else, ESPECIALLY after 10:30 PM, you were singled out and
things would happen to you only, which is why only I (And a few<br>
friends) have really seen or heard anything because I am an only child.
Being a young ghost hunter I don't really know what to make of those
experiances, but there's my little story anyway.<br>

Wapsie Valley Ghosts<br>
<br>
By: riv85@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
High my name Is nick and I would like to tell you about a picture that I saw<br>
2 years ago at my highschool when I was a junior. I live by the small
town of oran Iowa next to a small rural cemetary and for a long time I
have belived in ghosts and apperations because of things that have
happened in the past while living at that house and stories told by my
parents. I have many things to tell you but I am going to start first
with the Highschool ghost since it is the most recent. In the year 2004
I was shown a photo taken with our forign exchange students camera that
took place at our highschool auditorium. It was taken at night time
after school hours during I think it was a play or the annual swing
show. In this photo you can see a woman floating in the backround as
clear as day wearing a pink dress. The whole school was in dismay and I
think if you would ever mention it to anybody that went to wapsie at
that time they would say that they saw it. I will try to pull it up for
you guys if at all possible to see what you guys think. But I cant
promise anything but the fact that the picture does exist. <br>
There was alot of speculation about who the ghost could be but in my
mind I think it could only be one person. Her name was carrie and she
died a year ago on the night of the home coming dance. She was involved
in a deadly accident in which she fliped her car numerous amount of
times and she was ejected from the car and ultimatly crushed by the
vehicle. She was a senior that year.This is no lie.Now I will move on
to another location in the fairbank Iowa area. Down the road from where
I live there used to be rail road tracks that ran from readlyn to oran
then to fairbank. Years ago In the 50's I think there were some teens
that were driving down on the road where my house is which is white
tail ave. They came upon the railroad tracks and the car they were in
was struck by a train. legend says when the train made its next stop
after the accident rail crew found wreckage on the front end of the
train. When the went to look for the scene of the accident one of the
rail workers stumbled upon the head of one of the victims. Near the
scene of the accident there is a slope where my brother and I always
went sledding during the winter and whenever I would go there I would
always feel like someone was watching my brother and I. It was a really
erie feeling.Now lets move on to my house. I live in a house right next
to a local cematary outside of oran Iowa. The house I live in used to
be the preachers house I cant rememberthe technical term for it though
but that doesnt matter. I am about to tell you things that I have never
told anybody. When I was a child at about 9 years old my parents left
me home alone sometimes because they had to work or do other things. I
remember one time I was upstairs in my room playing the good old super
nintendo when I would hear the door slam like somebody was pissed off.
I would go down stairs to see if it was one of my parents but when I
went down stairs nobody was there and the door would be locked so I
would look outside and I would see no cars in the drive way and I would
hear no cars take off. That day I was scared to death because I had no
Idea what was going on. And for as long as I can remember whenever I
would go upstairs I always felt like there was someone right behind me
but I would turn around and see nothing but I would still feel a
presence. <br>
Sometimes our dogs would bark uncontrollably in the middle of the night
and they would always be looking toward the cemetary. I never had the
nerves to go into the cemetary during the night time for my whole life.
Now this I have never told any body because I was afraid people would
think I was crazy. I was coming home one night after hanging out with
my friends and before I pulled into my driveway I saw a apperation of a
man standing at the gate looking out towards the road as if he was
hanging on the fence. and know I wasnt drinking or on drugs that night.
After I saw him I ran inside the house locked the door and ran to my
room. That night I was truely scared to death.And like I said I never
told anybody. And just recently I had to run to the gas station at
readlyn to grab some cigs. I locked the door and made sure everything
is where it is supposed to be at and when I got home there was a bucket
on the table with a dirty glass and a screw driver in it. <br>
I called my parents and asked if they were ever home but they both said no. <br>
Those were the most outragous things that have happend but once in a
while the ocasional door closing will happen and thats about it. Thanks
for taking your time to read this email and hope to hear from you guys
soon to see what you think. thanks alot Nick<br>

It Didn&#8217;t Work<br>
<br>
By: MoonBeem227@aol.com<br>
<br>
This isn't much because my grandma (Gram-Gram) told me about her
experiences when she married grandpa (Gramps) and he got assigned into
the Navy. She was looking into a long mirror (those big ones that you
see your whole self top to bottom) and she saw a man standing behind
her, even though no one was there. At first she thought it was Gramps,
but it turned out to be her brother(I think) And at one time she was
living with one of her lady relatives (forgot who) and they had a very
loud manual typewriter. So one night she was sleeping and she heard
someone typing on it and thought it was her lady relative so she just
ignored it and went to sleep. so in the morning her lady relative asked
her if she was typing last night, so gram-gram says," I thought it was
you typing." so they look at the typewriter, there was no paper in it,
and they hadn't left any in. So I guess if someone was trying to reach
them, it didn't work.<br>

Family home in Eerie, Pa<br>
<br>
<br>
By: lilachandra1@hotmail.com <br>
<br>
My parent&#8217;s bought a flat in 1949 after my Dad returned from WWII. It
dates from 1887 when the area was farmland and outside the city of Erie
limits. By the 50&#8217;s when my brother and I grew up there it had evolved
in to a working class neighborhood. My Mom&#8217;s sister and her family
lived in the upstairs apartment and my parents and my brother and I
lived downstairs. I can&#8217;t honestly say that the apartment was so much
haunted as much as odd things would happen frequently.<br>
One time when my aunt and uncle where away visiting relatives and the
upstairs apartment was empty. My mother and I were talking downstairs,
when we distinctly heard footsteps walking across the dining floor
upstairs. So we crept up the backstairs armed with rolling pin and
baseball bat. When we unlocked the door no one was there and no one
could have gotten out of the apartment without passing us! Several
years later my aunt told me of her encounters with a phantom wind when
all the windows were shut. She also bumped into someone in the night on
her way to the bathroom. She thought that it was her husband but found
that he hadn&#8217;t gotten out of bed!<br>
In the 80&#8217;s, when my Mom died and Dad remarried and moved away, my
husband and I bought the house. From the moment that we moved in more
frightening phenomena began to take place. While she was taking a box
down to the basement my 6 year old daughter was assaulted by an evil
entity in the basement. She described it as having a skeletal like face
surrounded by billowing blackness that she thought was wings. At night
she would hear spirits would call to her name and see figures in the
dark. (From that time on she would sleep with the lights on until she
left for college.) After I separated from my husband I made a spare
room in the basement into my bedroom so the children would each have
their own rooms. At night I would awaken with the strong feeling that
something was in the room with me! The room well was lit by my alarm
clock and I saw nothing. I would jump up and turn on the light and the
feeling would go away only to come back as soon as I turned off the
light.<br>

Totally True<br>
<br>

<br>
This is completely real. My father and my uncle were going to move into
this little white house. They did and when they did it started. The
first week they were in there they heard funny noises that everyone
could hear. They went to go check it out and nothing&#8230;well maybe,
something was there, but they couldn&#8217;t see anything. My father didn&#8217;t
think it was a big deal and neither did anyone else. One day they tried
to tape a foot ball game and when they did you could here a scratchy
voice that said &#8220;GET OUT!!&#8221; well as you suppose that freaked everyone
out. So they just threw the VCR away and bought a new one but every
time they did the same thing happened. After a couple days they waited
for something just one little thing to happen, but nothing did. Another
few days while they were a sleep my father awakened to a noise, so he
went to check it out. He found that all the sinks were suddenly turned
on. My uncle&#8217;s room was so cold ice was on the windows. When my uncle
first went into his room his nose bled when he looked up for the first
time ever. They decided to move. After they sold the house and it was
moving day they found a room and went inside it had a fold out bed a
lamp on a night stand that was on. So they found the history of the
house&#8230; a couple was murdered there it was a dark history so they got
out of there nothing ever happened again.<br>

"Emily"<br>
<br>
<br>
By: Patricia.King@aviano.af.mil <br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Don&#8217;t you find it weird that most of the tales on this page start out with &#8220;when I was&#8221; and then name an age under 10?<br>
Are children considered more open minded?&nbsp; Or just more accepting of spirits?<br>
Any here is my experience&#8230;<br>
The first instance that I can remember was 6 days before my 9th
birthday.&nbsp; Upon this occurrence my Mom said that it was very
common occurrence for me to be sitting and talking to no one or playing
with &#8220;Emily&#8221;.&nbsp; My Mom started to notice these occurrences starting
to happen about the time of my Father&#8217;s death (when I was 13 months
old).&nbsp; She just assumed I had made up an imaginary friend (and
later told me so).&nbsp; I never thought it was strange and why would
I?&nbsp; I had grown up with Emily my whole life&#8230;<br>
Well this particular night.&nbsp; I was awakened from my bed by Emily
she wanted me to go into the living room so that we could talk.&nbsp; I
didn&#8217;t understand why we couldn&#8217;t talk in the bedroom but she was upset
so I went.&nbsp; The time was about 10:00 at night so everybody was
asleep.&nbsp; I went to the living room and we started to talk.&nbsp;
She was upset because she said that I wouldn&#8217;t be living in the house
any more.&nbsp; That the house I was in was going to burn down and I
was moving away.&nbsp; The more I tried to convince her I wasn&#8217;t going
any where the more upset she got.&nbsp; Finally she got upset enough
that she was floating kitchen knives and the like around my head.&nbsp;
Still I&#8217;m not worried she&#8217;d done this before and I wasn&#8217;t afraid of her&#8230;<br>
I don&#8217;t get the feeling to be afraid of her.&nbsp; I always feel said when she&#8217;s around but not afraid.<br>
Unknown to me (and probably Emily) my Mom was in the hallway watching this happen and she was able to get it on tape.<br>
Up to this point I was the only one who saw her (although it seemed like my Grandmother would smile at her occasionally).<br>
My Mom was really freaked, I don&#8217;t blame her now.&nbsp; When Emily
noticed my Mother she dropped the utensils and faded away angry.&nbsp;
I stopped seeing her for years.<br>
Three days later my family was celebrating my Step-dad&#8217;s day off (he&#8217;s
in the Army) and he decided to take us out to the drive-in after a
BBQ.&nbsp; The house burnt to the ground while we were gone.&nbsp; The
only other thing I remember about that day is wanting to take my dad&#8217;s
picture with me to the drive-in I didn&#8217;t want to leave it in the
house.&nbsp; I just had the feeling that it wasn&#8217;t going to be there
when I got back.&nbsp; My Mom didn&#8217;t want to hear about &#8220;My little
feelings&#8221; she was still spooked.<br>
When Emily appears to me she is usually dressed a ballroom type blue
silk and lace dress.&nbsp; She&#8217;s about 5-7 years old.&nbsp; Upon doing
research on the house I found out that a little girl named Emily had
lived there and her Father had raped and murdered her when she was 7.<br>
When I was 16 my Mom showed me the tape she had made of that night
(guess she finally decided to talk about it) and this is when Emily
started coming around again.&nbsp; Soon after she was back the tape
disappeared.&nbsp; She is always looking out for me.&nbsp; I am now in
the Air force and stationed in Italy.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the first time I have
been away from home.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been here for seven months and she has
been here with me every night just incase I need to talk!&nbsp; But
lately she&#8217;s been wearing a little pink dress.&nbsp; She won&#8217;t tell me
why it&#8217;s been puzzling me why she changed or even how.<br>
I have always had experiences with the others as my Mom calls them but
nothing bad happens I think Emily is just making sure I live the life
she wasn&#8217;t able to.<br>
If you have any ideas as to why her gown changed or even why she&#8217;s
starting to behave differently after the 19 years she&#8217;s been with
me.&nbsp; Please e-mail me.&nbsp; I really want to help her.<br>

My Ghost Stories<br>
<br>
<br>
By: kikakirsten@msn.com<br>
<br>
Hello<br>
my name is Leonie and I am 18 years old. I have had a couple of weird
expierences in my life. This one time, when I felt very sad because
things werent working out in my life, i was in the shower sitting on
the floor, crying, and all of the sudden i heard some one singing very
softly to me. It was just like it was on the other side of the shower
curtain. I couldnt hear the words of the song but i am sure it was a
womans voice. nobody except me was in my house at that time. The
singing made me feel very happy like someone was trying to comfort me.
i think it was my guardian angel, trying to help me.<br>
A couple of years ago i was very ill. the doctors couldnt tell what it
was but i felt so miserable . i didnt sleep for 2 nights. my stumach
hurt so much! i prayed to God to help me, to let me get some sleep
because i was so tired but i couldnt sleep because the pain was holding
me up all the time. while is was praying i felt a hand on my head and
one on my belly. the pain went away in seconds, i felt happy and
finally i fell asleep. The next day i felt better.<br>
in the spring of 2003 me and my class mates wnet on school camp. whe
have had a lot of fun. but one night whe were dropped in a smaal forest
by our teachers and whe had to find the way home our selves. It was fun
in the beginning, but after an hour it started to rain. and it poured!
i was walking with a classmate and we were holding eachother by the
arms bacuase it was so cold. she had a flashlight in her ohter had so
we could see where we were walking. we just walked for a while, talking
and lokkign at the ground. when i was lokking at the ground, footsteps
appeared in the muddy sand right nest to me and my classmate. I lokked
at my classmate and i could tell she saw it to. "I saw it too, you
don't have to say anything" she said. We just kept on walking, not
looking at the ground an whe havent said anything to eachother the
whole night. we were so shocked by this incident. And we havent talk
about is since either...<br>
I can also hear someone calling my name sometimes. Even when i am all
alone. and when i look around i dont see anybody. it's so weird.<br>
Thank you for letting me share my stories!<br>

I've seen/heard/smelled ghosts since i was 4. <br>
<br>
<br>
By: bloodyacidpink@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
My life is a little crazy. I've first scenced a ghost when i was about
4 years old living in my old house in town. My mother, my brother and
myself have witnessed a baby picture of my mother fly across to another
wall in our living room, and the light would flicker and my brother
would yell "grandpa, stop!" yes indeed it would sop, but it would
happen more. also in that house i would have dreams of my grandfather
whom i never met, i explained what he looked like to my mother and she
cried, knowing i never seen his face before. in that house as well my
pool misteriously fellover in the backyard leaving strange footprints
in the mud in our yard. In the house i moved into when i was about 5, i
would have dreams that my gandmother was sleeping next to me and i
would smell her lavender perfume (i had no idea she wore that until i
told my mom). i would also smell cherry tobacco smoke which was my
other grandfather who had died in that house, and when i would smell it
i would feel somehing cold on the back of my neck. my mother would also
say i was screaming in my ssleep saying "no, please dont do that to
yourself" in regaurds of my grandmother killing herself, which i did
not know about.i woke up in the middle of the night one night, seeing
my brother and my mother in the living room downstairs staring at my
dog, my mother was saying "miranda, sweety please stay right there,
dont move, your walk right through it" i started to cry because i was
scared and the i saw it. . . this beautiful figure, almost like an
angel, but it disapeared as soon as i turned to look it, it was like i
could anly see it through the corner of my eyes. my mother
started&nbsp; crying more when my dog sinally moved and barked, she
said "your grandmother was in the dog anf i could feel her". in the
house i am currently living in, im constantly taking pictures of myself
and seeing orbs and sngel-type figures standing right next to me. it
must be my grandmother, grandfather, and my great-aunt who lived in
this house and died in the room im always taking pictures in.
sometimes, i come to beleive i am possibly a psychic or a medium,
because the fact that i can see/smell/and hear ghosts, spirits,
poltraguists and entities. My mother also has this gift, but hers is
alot stronger. . . <br>

out of their as fast as I could I never told my mom what was wrong or
why I wanted to leave. but one time my mom let me and my sister have a
sleep over and&nbsp; we did. Before we knew it we were playing truth or

one of the girls there volunteered and we went up their I showed her
the room and she seen the doll house and asked if we could play with
them and I said no when she asked why I said they ant mine they belong
to another little girl. So we made our way to the door and again I
started to feel that sad feeling and so did she, she asked me if I was
ok and I said im fine and she opened the door and screamed we fell back
on our bottoms and i said what? she said there are more dolls in there,
i suddenly got a confused look on my face because the dolls wernt their
before. we went in the room and she found a picture or a little girl an

A Family with Stories<br>
<br>
By: corporate@svcconection.com<br>
<br>
<br>
It started with my grandmother, she was young and so was my mother. <br>
My mother was from the ages of 15-16 and it was 1976 when my grand-<br>
Mother decided to take her life, my mother and uncle found her in her bed<br>
No longer with us. My mother then moved in my dad&#8217;s house and pregnant<br>
My other grandmother said after my mother had my older sister my grand-<br>
Mother (mom&#8217;s mom) had come to visit she said she knew it was her by <br>
The way she walked in the house. My grandmother said she could hear her <br>
Walk in the hallway and open the bedroom door. The funny thing is my<br>
Mother had a dream that night that her mother came to see my sister.<br>
When I was about 15 my great grandmother passed away and my grandmother<br>
(Dad&#8217;s side) told me wouldn&#8217;t it be funny if your great grandmother came back to <br>
Say bye to everyone. I just smiled and said I hope not. Well after the funeral I <br>
Was putting my little brother to sleep in his crib. After that I went to my bed because<br>
We shared the room.&nbsp; I turned to face away from the doorway and a couple of seconds<br>
Later I felt chills go up my spine so I turned to see what was going on and I saw this <br>
Woman with long black hair wearing black standing over my little brother and as I<br>
Tried to focus she turned to me and started fading away. I never knew who this woman <br>
Was and I don&#8217;t think it was my great grandmother because my great grandmother had<br>
Natural red hair. Who ever she was I didn&#8217;t see her again, until now 23 I had a dream that<br>
The same lady came to me I remember her talking to me in my dream the only thing is<br>
I don&#8217;t remember what she had told me.<br>
We were living in my grandmother&#8217;s house (dad&#8217;s side) they decided to move so they wanted<br>
Someone to stay at their home so one day it was night and my brother went out with some <br>
Friends, so my stepmother and I woke up around mid night we heard <br>
A noise from the front door and my brother&#8217;s room close so we thought he was home. We even<br>
Smelled his cologne that he wears passes through the air, we went to see how his night was <br>
Only to find out he didn&#8217;t come home.<br>
I have more if your interested.<br>

Charlie<br>
<br>
By: bebo@millry.net<br>
<br>
&nbsp;I was fourteen years old when I went to stay with my dad in South
Carolina during the winter of 94. My dad told me stories of a ghost
named Charlie and several other ghosts who occupied the house.<br>
The first night I spent in the house I remembering waking feeling
something lifting me upward than it let me go. Whatever it was, I
rationalized it over in my head and decided it was my imagination
playing tricks on me. I truly did not believe in ghosts.&nbsp; After
staying their a couple of weeks I believed differently. things would
disappear and reappear. My room was always cold and I would awake with
the feeling that something was watching me. The television would come
on by itself, lights flickered on and off, and the worst thing was
hearing someone walking up and down the stairs tapping on the walls,
but no one would be there.<br>
One night I fell asleep on the couch I awoke to the kitchen doors being
slammed and reopened, things rattling, and it basically sounded as if
someone was tearing the kitchen apart. I went and got my dad whom came
into the living room and he could hear the noises also. <br>
I was a true believer when I left that house, though I had never return since then.<br>

Cortland Ghost<br>
<br>
<br>
By: anonymous<br>
<br>
I have a couple stories about experiences with ghosts, but I&#8217;ll stick
with one story from my old sorority house. I went to college in
Cortland, NY.&nbsp; Your site already mentions this town with ghost
stories coming from campus (on a side note I lived on the fourth floor
of Cheney Hall my freshmen year and knew of the story about the girl
who was pushed by her boyfriend and fell over the railing).&nbsp; <br>
When I was first joining my sorority my pledge sisters and I had been
told ghost stories, by the current sisters, about the ghost in the
house. They merely mentioned strange happenings, but no one claimed to
have actually seen the haunter. It turns out one of my suitemates and I
ended up being the first ones to actually see our ghost&#8230;or at least the
first ones to own up to it.<br>
For me it started the first year I lived in the house. One day while I
was heading to the first floor from the third floor (where my room
was), I happened to glance in the mirror across from the stairs on the
second floor.&nbsp; I noticed that there was a girl behind me in the
mirror, half covered by the banister there. Without getting a closer
look, I assumed she was one of my sisters, so I immediately turned
around to ask her if she was headed to the kitchen like I was. But when
I turned around there was no one there. I ignored it thinking it was my
imagination and that in my quick glance to the mirror I only saw the
banister and mistook it for a girl. This happened many more times where
I would think I saw a girl in the mirror, but when I turned around no
one was there. I think I convinced myself I was seeing things because I
couldn&#8217;t deal with what it might really be.&nbsp; Just in case, I did
politely ask the &#8220;possible ghost&#8221; one evening to never appear to me
again because &#8220;even if [she was] my grandmother I would be frightened.&#8221;
Actually, after asking this I never saw her in the mirror again.<br>
My doubt about seeing someone in the mirror changed one day when I was
at the bottomed of the steps and my suitemate, Kate, came running down.
She was out of breath and her eyes were wide.&nbsp; When Kate saw me
she asked me if I had ever seen anything in the mirror on the second
floor.&nbsp; The rest of our conversation went something like this:<br>
Me: &#8220;Yea, a girl.&#8221;<br>
Kate: &#8220;Yea, with dark hair about to here (pointing to her shoulders).&#8221;<br>
Me: &#8220;Yea, and a dark, long dress.&#8221;<br>
After this we were both sure what we had seen was real since we went
back and forth describing the same thing. We ended up telling our story
to others in the house and asking them if they had ever seen anything,
but no one else had. Most of the other girls thought we were trying to
play a prank on them.<br>
I have to say, for the most part, my fear went away because our ghost
never appeared to me again. Besides that, we didn&#8217;t see her as a
harmful spirit. She never did anything mean, just little things to let
us know she was there.&nbsp; <br>
A few of the younger members actually went to the town&#8217;s historical
society to see if they could dig anything up about the house. They
found out that no one died in that house (despite it being built in the
early 1900s) and couldn&#8217;t see why there would be a ghost haunting it. I
personally believe there is some old piece of furniture she is attached
to&#8230;or maybe it is something about the land the house is on.<br>
.Sometimes when I visit my college and the sorority house, a part of me
wishes she would appear to me again. But then I remember I would become
frightened and not know what to do, so I go on content that she
listened to my request, years before, of never appearing to me again.<br>

Creepy Bedroom<br>
<br>
<br>
By: tmanz@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
Hi. I LOVE this website.&nbsp; It makes me feel so normal!&nbsp; I have
many, many, stories I can tell on this website, I've been experiencing
the paranormal since I was born.&nbsp; I believe it runs in the family
on my mother's side, but they all had a strict Christian (Quaker)
upbringing thru many generations and as a result these things are
never-ever discussed or acknowledged.&nbsp; It's a shame, I feel I have
lost some of my abilities over the years because I never
understood/embraced them until I was in my very late twenties.&nbsp; I
still have experiences to this day but am no longer afraid and pretty
much know how to handle the situations.&nbsp; What a huge weight off my
shoulders, it can be so stressful to endlessly wonder if you're losing
your mind - especially when you're a child an can't understand what's
happening to you and no-one is offering any explanations.&nbsp; Yes, I
was a very stressed out child &amp; youg adult.&nbsp; You can ask
anyone who knew me then.<br>
This story centers around a luxury hi-rise apartment building that many
foreigners lived in over in Seoul, South Korea.&nbsp; We lived in South
Korea for a time and another American family we knew lived in this
apartment building. <br>
I spent alot of time there, and the younger sister of my friend would
never sleep in her room.&nbsp; She said she hated it in there and
insisted that a light always stay on and the be door open even if
no-one was in there. All her clothes &amp; other stuff was in there but
she would always run in and out of there to get whatever she
needed.&nbsp; It always seemed dark/dingy in there even with the light
on, but I attributed that to the fact that the window faced the inside
hallway of the apartment building instead of the outdoors.&nbsp; I
found out how wrong I was soon enough.&nbsp; I never went in there
much, no reason to, until one night.&nbsp; I was living with them for a
time while my parents were out of town.&nbsp; I had to go somewhere on
my own and when I came back everyone at the apartment was already
asleep.&nbsp; I tried to go in my friends room where I usually slept
only to find that there were many girls sleeping over and every inch of
the bed/floor in the room was taken.&nbsp; I had nowhere to sleep and
there were two perfectly good beds in the younger sisters room so I
decided to sleep in one of them.&nbsp; Keeping with tradition I kept
the light on but laid down to go to sleep.<br>
I had not been laying down long when I felt a hand grab my foot and
give it a good squeeze.&nbsp; I sat up immediately thinking it was one
of the girls playing with me and I was going to catch them before they
could get out of the room.&nbsp; I saw no-one but figured they were
crouched at the end of the bed.&nbsp; There was no-way anyone could
have got out before I sat up.&nbsp; I got up looked over the end of the
bed and there was no-one there.&nbsp; That's when I freaked a little
but then told myself it was late and I "must have been imagining
things".&nbsp; I laid back down on my side and within 5 minutes I felt
a huge pressure on my side like someone was trying to sit on me in the
lower chest/hip area.&nbsp; It felt heavy so I lifted just my head up,
looked and there was nothing there.&nbsp; I stared for a minute only to
feel and watch myself sink further into the bed as the pressure
increased.&nbsp; That's when I REALLY freaked.&nbsp; I somehow jumped
up ran out and slept on the couch.&nbsp; I never said anything to the
people that lived there.&nbsp; They too were a very religious bunch and
it would not have gone over well.&nbsp; A few days later, I don't
remember how it happened but I found myself back in that room.&nbsp; I
felt as if I was in a trance as I dug through all the shoes &amp; junk
on the closet floor to find a small trap-door on the wall at floor
level.&nbsp; How I knew it was there and why I went looking for it I
will never know. When I opened the door it was pitch black inside and a
puff of cold air came out. It sounded like there was alot of open space
on the other side of that door and I could hear mechanical things in
the distance.&nbsp; As I sat there two conflicting things were going
through my mind.&nbsp; I felt as if someone had fallen thru there and
perhaps thru falling quite a distance had died.&nbsp; (remember, this
was a hi-rise apartment building)&nbsp; The other feeling I was having
was that someone wanted me to look thru the opening...wanted me to be
curious enough to look in there...but I also felt that if I did I was
going to get a shove and perhaps fall thru myself.&nbsp; To my own
death maybe?&nbsp; In the end I snapped out of it, closed the door and
I don't think ever went in that room again.<br>
Looking back on these events I think there was either a spirit trapped
there who was harmless but very curious and had perhaps met an untimely
death.&nbsp; <br>
Maybe was trying to communicate with me?&nbsp; Or, there was a
mischievous entity in there who would have like nothing more than to
see me or someone else get injured&nbsp; - possibly pretty badly.<br>
If anyone emails me please put "Shadowlands Ghost" in your subject line
or I will delete as junk mail. More stories to come soon.&nbsp; I have
quite a few!<br>

I never really considered my experiences to be anything out of the
ordinary until I read some of the stories and saw they were a lot like
mine.&nbsp; I&#8217;m a twelve year old girl from Washington, so don&#8217;t think
my age would make it so my stories are made up please, because they are
totally, even if I wish they weren&#8217;t, true.<br>
They started when we moved into a house in a nice community.&nbsp; The
house was brand new, we bought it before it was done being built, so
youd think it wasn&#8217;t haunted.&nbsp; But I had two experiences
there.&nbsp; The first was when I was eight, and I was about to go to
bed.&nbsp; My closet was open, and a pile of clothes I had put in there
flew off their shelf and onto the middle of the floor of my room.&nbsp;
I ran downstairs and told my parents, but they said that my clothes
just fell&#8230; across the room?<br>
Then my second experience at this house was again, I was about to go
bed.&nbsp; My bed was a bunker with out a bottom bunk.. a loft.&nbsp; I
heard a crackling under my bed, and let me tell you, that I was scared
to death when the crackling started up my ladder.&nbsp; I had my head
under my blanket, and the crackle is right above me, accompanied by
heavy breathing.&nbsp; When I got the guts to peek out of my blankets,
it all stopped.<br>
Just as an added, I believe that a spirit wasn&#8217;t necessarily haunting
one house, but came with us on our moves.&nbsp; We moved into another
neighborhood, and I experienced similar things for about the week we
were there.&nbsp; But I found out that there was four houses on the
block that were already haunted, including this one.&nbsp; I guess our
ghost that followed our moves was kicked out, because another entity
found it&#8217;s way in.&nbsp; I knew it was another spirit because of the
attitude of the events.&nbsp; The other, who I admit, scared the living
daylight out of me, seemed just curious and not necessarily
harmful.&nbsp; WELL, anyhow, at the new house we had an old wood
burning stove.&nbsp; Whenever I went out of my bedroom to the kitchen,
which was connected to our family room ((the family room had the
stove)) late at night for a drink or the like, two pinpricks of flame
would be in the stove.&nbsp; They wouldn&#8217;t put off heat, in fact, if I
was alone then, it would be freezing.&nbsp; The other spot in that
house was the kids&#8217; bathroom.&nbsp; I was always way to scared to be in
there alone, because the faucets would slowly turn on full blast, and
the little curtains would fling around even though the window wasn&#8217;t
open.<br>
In our current house, I believe one of the two entities that I&#8217;ve
experienced followed me home, but not the curious one.&nbsp; The only
two things that have been noticed this house is when I heard a scraping
noise on the stairs, and when I checked the next morning, there was
finger marks halfway across the wall, denting into the sheet
rock.&nbsp; The other is the word &#8216;die&#8217; scratched into my bedpost that
came about just last week.&nbsp; I am certain that I will encounter
more all too soon, but until then&#8230; thanks for reading all this!<br>

I Have Come to pick up my Daughter<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous<br>

I've a strange story I want to relate to the readers. This story takes
place in 1998. I'm a policeman in the NSW Policeforce. One evening,
late June 1998, we were called out to a house where a young woman was
found dead. We had the place cornered off and I was put on guard duty
with another Constable, who we'll call Stu. I was standing out front,
making sure that noone came anywhere near the place when this woman
appeared...and I mean appeared...at my side. She wore a floral dress,
like something from the early eighties, in her late twenties, early
thirties.<br>
"Um, can I help you?" I asked as she was standing there, looking at the house.<br>
"I've come to pick up my daughter,' she said in a flat voice, still peering over at the house.<br>
"Sorry but we can't allow anyone to enter-"<br>
"I've come to pick up my daughter," she repeated again in that flat voice.<br>
"And like I said, noone's allowed to enter," at that Stu called me on
the radio. I turned my back on the woman for a few seconds then I
turned around. She was gone. I looked around, thinking that she
might've slipped passed me but I would've seen her. I looked up and
down the street but no sign of her. <br>
Footnote: I was let inside for a cup of tea as someone else took my
place. I felt bad entering some poor dead woman's house but I was
offered some tea. As I entered the hallway, I noticed a small framed
photo. I picked it up and almost dropped it. It was the same woman from
outside. Written beneath the photo was a small engraving: Lois P-
1950-84. RIP Mother.<br>

Not a Dime in my Pocket<br>
<br>
By: Sherriejjac2@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
My father died five years ago, on 12/24/00.&nbsp; All the time I was
growing up he used to say you always need a dime in your pocket.&nbsp;
I guess in the City of Houston, sometimes when they wanted to arrest
you, they could for vagrancy during the depression.&nbsp; If you had a
dime in your pocket, you were OK.&nbsp; <br>
Before he died, he would have to go to the hospital about 2 times a
month.&nbsp; This went on for several months before his heart finally
gave out.&nbsp; When we left his room each night in Intensive Care, he
would say that the nursing staff wouldn't let him have a dime in his
pocket.&nbsp; <br>
During the funeral, my husband put a brand new shiny dime in his suit
pocket.&nbsp; This of course made both of us feel better.&nbsp; Since
then we both find dimes everywhere.&nbsp; Brand new shiny dimes!&nbsp;
He's still helping others I guess.&nbsp; I always say HI DAD, we're OK
thanks for the dime in my pocket!!!.&nbsp; I've saved all over 300 of
them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for listening<br>
You too, Dad!<br>

Some More Ghost Stories<br>
<br>

Hi guys, I have a few stories that I would like to share. They aren't
the biggest things and might be able to be put off as something other
then supernatural but it still made me raise an eyebrow. The first one
has to do with a guinea pig of mine that passed away, his name was
Paulie. We only had him for a week when he passed away from fluid in
his lungs, I was listening to a song by Avril Lavigne that reminded me
of him. It made me upset and I started to cry, my dog Toby came in my
room and laid down on my bed next to me. I was just petting him, he had
his head on my lap, all of a sudden his ears perked up and he put his
head up. He looked up to the ceiling his eyes following something that
I couldn't see and I started to call his name. He didn't respond and
just kept looking at the ceiling, I also have two guinea pigs in my
room and both of their noses were up in the air like they were sniffing
something. I smiled because I knew Paulie was there telling me it was
ok. Another one happened a few weeks ago, I was just going up to my
room to put something on my bed. Just as I got into my room I heard
something run around in my guinea pig, Simons, cage. I saw something
run behind his igloo, if you don't know what it is, it's a little
plastic igloo that guinea pigs can lay in. I noticed that Simon had not
moved an inch and he was in front of his igloo. We had gotten Paulie
and Simon together, so they were kind of like brothers, I think Paulie
just wanted to play with Simon. The other one happened just last night,
Simon had finish drinking some water and I opened up his cage so I
could pet him, he gets scared when someone is going to take him out or
puts their hand in his cage so he runs into his igloo. The weird thing
was that he would have half of his body in the igloo but it looked like
something kept pushing him out, he would have his head up to his
shoulders in there and then come back out. He did this a few times, I
smiled and said "Ok Paulie I love you but it scares me a little so can
you please leave". Simon went into his igloo and it was fine. I just
remembered another one, I had recently gotten a web cam , and I was on
with my boyfriend. He didn't tell me at the time but he saw something
watching me on the basement stairs, he showed me the picture, it's kind
of blurry but it looks like this white thing standing on the first
step. I'm not sure how to put a picture up otherwise I would show you.
Thank you for taking the time to read this.<br>

This is My Story<br>
<br>
<br>
By: Angel4eva69g@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
Well I submitted some of this story before, but couldn't find it so here we go again!<br>
Things started to happen to me when i was 8 right after my grandfather passed away.<br>
Within 3 months he came to check on me and it was really creepy, but i
knew he wouldn't hurt me because he had loved me so much in life.&nbsp;
Well he had on what he was buried in and he seemed to be happy and he
just looked at me and smiled.&nbsp; I covered my head and peeked out
and he was gone! Well not much else happened to me when until I was 14
not supernatural, but in my dreams.&nbsp; I have a gift which it will
lead into more weird things!&nbsp; Well the dream I was having I was
giving birth to a child and i woke up in the birth giving position yeah
that's right i did, but 4 years later this dream came true when i was
18 and everything was grey around what i was seeing in real life like i
did in my dream through my eyes in my dream if that makes sense!&nbsp;
Well then I moved from Arkansas to North Carolina shortly after that
and that is when things started happen!&nbsp; I was at my sisters house
one day and had a bad feeling the whole day and decided to call my
parents to come get me and when i got in the car my mom told me that my
brothers and my friend Chris had got stabbed and i started to cry and
she told me he was only going to be stiched up and sent home and i told
my mom that he was dead (I had a dream of it a month to the day before
that and dismissed it).&nbsp; Well as night fell and i was tired and
turned out the light and decided to sleep still being upset and i
tossed and turned and had that eerie feeling as if i was being watched
well when I turned over towards the door that is when i saw a shadow
about 6 ft or so in the corner of my room towards the door. I couldn't
do nothing but lay there in fear but i wasn't scared well threatened by
what I saw he stood their and as i kept looking at him i realized that
i knew that outline of that black fugure it was Chris to come to say
his last goodbye to me all though he never spoke to me. Well I stayed
awake till the sun come up and finally got a little sleep and my
brother was already there and he called and told me that his mom had
kept him on life support from April 1st to April 2nd but he was saying
his last goodbye because he was like a brother to me.&nbsp; Well not
long after that we moved to Monroe,NC and we were in a apartment and i
was 16 by this time and I went to sleep and had one of my dreams.&nbsp;
Started out that Chris and i were dancing on a cloud and we were in the
1940's dance clothes and all the sudden Chris disappeared and things
turned dark and grey and I heard Satan tell me that Chris wasn't in
heaven that he was in hell with him and I said no he wasn't and that he
was in heaven with god well after i woke up my room was hot i was
pouring sweat!&nbsp; It was summer time and the ac was on like 70 so i
know something there was freaky !&nbsp; I didn't have much happen to me
until i was about 27 if i did i dont' remember!&nbsp; But my dreams
pretty much stopped till then.&nbsp; It was about August of 2003 I
dreamt of people in a room dressed in black and they were sad and i
could people i didn''t know well of course i dimissed that one as well
and then right before x-mas my husband got insurance and all the sudden
popped up and said if something happens to me i want u to greive and go
on with ur life and i told him the same.&nbsp; and 1 month later my
husband was killed tragically.&nbsp; It's like he knew that he was
going to go.&nbsp; Well at my mother-inlaws house we had friends and
family and i went outside to smoke and one of his bestfriends came out
a minute behind me and said I don't know if this is going to help or
hurt u, but the day before he and his bestfriend was sitting in the car
and he told him how much he loved me but he knew that it was over
between us (we were seperated) and I started to bawl like a baby and
then it was like an hour after that I was sent to the store to get some
ice and another one of his bestfriends was their and his wife road with
me (we were friends as well) and another person was with us and they
got out to go in the store and said Misty I dont' know if this going to
help or hurt u but G loved u so much and u were all he talked about,
but he said he knew it was over between u but he said u were the only
one he ever loved!&nbsp; I broke down in the car and I am thinking
being told that by 2 different people an hour apart i think he was
trying to tell me something.&nbsp; I loved him very much too!&nbsp;
Then at the viewing I saw all the same people that i saw in my dream 6
months earlier and the samething happened with the grey smoke and I got
so light headed I nearly passed out! I met the people I met in my dream
and walked up to them and called them by name and they were stunned i
knew them and i was too for that fact!&nbsp; Well after i turned 28
right before xmas.&nbsp; After the funeral my dreams were more and more
and when i went to work i saw customers in my dream i never seen before
in my life the were travelers and i recalled several conversations
after he died i stopped putting my dreams off and started to look for
the signs so to speak well i was told by a preacher that i was a
deciphle (however u spell it) and i was shocked well i talked to my
cousin about this he is a religious man and he said the same thing i
did about the decyphle deal and he told me that i had a special gift
from god that i had when i was little that god has had his hand on me
for a longtime!&nbsp; And that i didn't know how to use this gift but
it would come to me....Well i would say about a year later i started to
have supernatural things happen to me when i met a friend of mine who
is a wiccan and his ex had sent something to follow him and he was a
truck driver and he came to the house to stay the weekend playing games
and all and well this thing came into my house and my ex roommate
around this time was a wiccan wanna be and called upon the gods and any
wiccan knows that is a nono!&nbsp; Well something was unleased in the
midst of the same time my friend came down.&nbsp; I didnt' know she was
practicing i dont' allow that in my house even though i am a wiccan
too, but i don't practice.&nbsp; I have 3 kids and my exroomie has one
and well things didn't start going bump in the night until he left and
this thing she unleased well it attacked her in her dreams and then it
started to try to bug me not in my dreams but it was posseing (i can't
spell) me but i am a strong wiccan it couldn't do a complete
possesstion i had a weak spot in my arm and it got in and i had a outof
body experience and i could see myself as if i was writing and i could
see a man in my bathroom and i really didn't feel threatned by him, but
as i sat up then i saw him and well i did this 3 times and something
laid me down and made me go back to sleep (i was in the bed by
myself).&nbsp; Well the next night my youngest was in the bed with me
and nothing happened and well when i rolled over with my back towards
the door i felt a mans hand touch my back as if it was saying I am
still here!&nbsp; Well needless to say the dreams with my ex roomie
started and then we got my friend on the phone and he had problems too
and well we stayed on the phone and well he yelled said some stuff and
his left and mine did too as well because after that things were back
to normal and it was like something was lifted off me and her as
well!&nbsp; Then about i would say 8 months later i met someone online
and we had lots incommon or so i thought with our dreams and he asked
me if i could dream walk and i was like no idont' think so he told me
how and well i did that night and well i pulled him in my dream with
his permission and then i started having dreams with my oldest brother
that had been dead like 9 years now and i was walking in a church and
he reached out and grabbed my arm and was happy to see me and we
chatted and well i noticed that right beside him was a man that looked
like this guy and my brother kept moving his eyes over towards him and
talking trying not to alarm him and well he went mute!&nbsp; Well when
i talked to this guy the next night i asked him if he was their adn he
told me yes that i was talking to some guy that had brown hair and a
mustach and had on jeans and a white sweater!&nbsp; Ok yeah that is
what he had on I freaked well i had several dreams that this guy i was
always running to him and before i could get to him i was sucked out of
the dream for the reason i woke up and my cat had hopped on me and
brought me back!&nbsp; Well once again i called on my strong wiccan
friend and told him and he told 2 more strong wiccan friends of his
well needless to say i had a Incubus which feeds off ur powers and
dreams and they will tell u anything to get u to trust them and well i
got a spell from one till we could really get intouch with the
strongest wiccan of the 3 and i did a spell in my mind doing a
crysitllene ball well i over did it, it was a spell to keep the incubus
out and well i was in the ball in delta state (that is why i say i over
did it the ball was only suppose to be like beach ball size) well as i
in the dream state looked around i looked up and i saw 2 dragons come
down feet first (i believe the them both to be male they were huge and
the same size) well anyways i crouched down thinking they were going to
squish me and i look down and saw a small demon running away scared of
the dragons then in the morning i called my friend and told him about
what happened and he kinda went silent and said well they found u i
said who found me he said he called on the dragons to find me because
he couldn't because he was so far away then i freaked and they were
earth dragons and he didnt' say nothing to me about this the night
before!&nbsp; When a incubus talks to u they r tagging u!&nbsp; so they
can find u in dreamstate and they can also tag u in person and online i
found that out I saw his webcam i felt this eerieness about him before
i done all this he said his eyes were blue but they looked deep black
and evil! I know all this sounds crazy but it's the gods honest
truth!&nbsp; Thanks for reading my story I haven't had problems in
almost a year now and I am happy to keep it that way the dreams i have
now r good and not bad, but remember don;t sleep with a incubus or u
will never get rid of them!&nbsp; U will be there's 4 ever, well the
same goes for the succubs the female version! Sorry it's so long but i
had to tell u from when i was little to get to the presant time!<br>

Someone to Play With<br>
<br>
<br>
By: Timothy.Guhl@qwest.com<br>
<br>
I am the youngest in my family, and when I was a child (and still
today) my two big sisters looked out and took care of me. They are the
best sisters a baby brother could have. When we where all small, my
family lived in town north of Winter Park Colorado, and at this time it
was all I knew. When I was four my parents had a beautiful new two
story house with a finished basement built. This was a great change
from the trailer that we lived in for my entire life up to that point.<br>
The first night we where in the house was hard for me. My sisters both
had their own rooms which where close to mine, but not close enough.
What was more difficult was that my parents bedroom was on the other
side of the house and three floors down (very hard for a mama's boy to
take). After some time we all settled in to my families dream house,
then the problems started.<br>
One day my family was in the back yard having a B.B.Q. and I was alone
in the house playing in my room. There I was just minding my own
business when an older man who was bald stuck his head into my doorway
and said "Pick-A-BOO"! Not really putting much thought into it (like
little kids do) I had a pretty good giggle. The man continued to play
in this fashion with me for what seemed to be some time. Then, it was
not just the man but a woman with brown hair started in the game with
the other man. After a little time past the game developed into them
repeating what I stated above, then I would run out into the hallway to
find nothing there. Then I would go sit back down and start playing
with my cars and they would come back.<br>
Then it became a four person game. The fourth person was a younger man
that looked about the same age as the women. This time when I ran out
into the hall to try and catch my new friends trying to hide from me, I
watched&nbsp; one of them go into my sisters room. Then, all three
started the same pick-a-boo game using my sisters doorway. At this
point I was not running into my sisters room. She may be a great big
sister, but she made it clear what would happen to me if I went into
her room. <br>
it was the afternoon on a summer day. The light seemed to stream
through all of the windows in the house. But my sisters room grew dark
with a cold air that started to flow along the floor. The familiar
voice of the older bald man came from the room "Come on in". At this
point I was not having fun anymore and ran to the backyard with the
rest of my family. <br>
I had never told this story to anyone but my wife. Now, almost twenty
years have passed. We went to my oldest sisters house to carve pumpkins
for the upcoming Halloween party. We got into telling ghost stories. I
asked my sister had she ever seen anything strange in any of the houses
we lived in when we where kids. She said no, then she said " but there
was that time in Winter Park when I was in my room going to sleep, and
there was a bald man with a green glow around him standing at the foot
of my bed." My blood ran cold.<br>
To finish the story, my parents did not know anyone meeting the description of the people who played with me as a little child.<br>

A Few Years Ago<br>
<br>
By: tenchidbz2005@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Hello My name is William.&nbsp; I am 25 and live on Long Island,
NY.&nbsp; I had a super-naturial experence a few years ago.&nbsp; I was
living with my parents and was in my old room one summer night.&nbsp; I
was alone in the house and I awoke at about 2 AM.&nbsp; I had a box fan
on and my stero playing music, like I did every night.&nbsp; Suddenly
the power went off and the house was silent, untill I heard my parents
yelling at me from downstairs to get down there.&nbsp; I knew that they
were not home yet and no one besides me was in the house.&nbsp; After I
heard that, the power came back on, and I was up for the rest of the
night.&nbsp; I did not see anything, just heard what I&nbsp; thought
was my parents. I was about 14 or 15 years old then, and it creaped me
out.&nbsp; To this day I dont know if it was ghosts, or demons or what
it was.&nbsp; Then after that a while later, I woke up at the same time
about 2 am again.&nbsp; This time I heard the sound of someone putting
their fingers on the plastic fan blades like they were trying to stop
it.&nbsp; The fan was right next to me, but I saw nothing, again just
hearing.&nbsp; After the second time, I never experenced this Again.<br>

A Van Sant Bridge Story<br>
<br>
<br>
By: hareball527@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
In the winter of 2002, me and two of my good friends decided to take a
trip to the Van Sant Bridge in Bucks County PA at around 10pm one
night.&nbsp; It must have been mid February and it was freezing and
pitch black with no moon that night.&nbsp; We drove through the woods
on the long narrow road to the bridge in rural Bucks County PA blasting
theme songs to hit scary movies on my buddies car stereo as a
joke....The build up is nerve racking as you approach the train tracks
which mean you're just about there...we all giggled with anxioty when
the bridge was finally in sight.&nbsp; We had never actually seen
anything on our previous journies there but this night is one we will
never forget. We first parked the car and turned it off while actually
sitting inside the bridge. We heard that's what you're supposed to do
and then your car will begin to shake.<br>
No such luck.&nbsp; So after 10 minutes of waiting and giggling inside
the car we backed up off the bridge and got out to take pictures. This
is where we got a hell of a scare.&nbsp; As we walked toward the bridge
we suddenly realized that we were not alone anymore. <br>
There were 2 figures at the opposite end of the bridge standing
motionless and seemingly facing us.&nbsp; We yelled at them to see if
they were kids but there was no sound or voices to be heard back to
us.&nbsp; We stared for about a minute longer when the figures moved
forward.&nbsp; Well, we just about jumped out of our skin and ran to
the car.&nbsp; Thankfully the car turned on and the lights shined into
the bridge but there was nothing to be seen.&nbsp; I truely think
something wanted us gone. Later we learned that, on top of a woman and
her baby dying at the bridge, a number or horse theives had been hanged
at the bridge about 200 years<br>
ago as well.&nbsp; We haven't been back since.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

Alamo<br>
<br>
By: sutherland52@verizon.net<br>
<br>
on june of this year my family took a trip to texas. the reason for
this trip was for our son to be in the u.s. jr. olympic teakwondo. we
had a chance to visit the alamo. while there I had the feeling that
there were whose who had fought there where still there. it felt like
they where there to make sure that no one whould cause harm to this
place. this feeling was both conforting and reasuring to know. I think
that the reason I felt this is because I served in this country's army.
although I didn't see any ghosts I did feel thier presents there. if
anyone goes there they need only need to take the time to respect their
final resting place. I think that they stand guard to this honored
place.<br>
