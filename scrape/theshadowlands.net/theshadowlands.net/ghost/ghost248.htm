<BR><B>&nbsp;GHOSTLY MIST</B>

<P><B>By: jessedan@rocketmail.com</B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Let me start off by saying that I must be the most</B>
<BR><B>UN-phsychic person around. I have never seen, heard,</B>
<BR><B>smelled, or felt anything wierd, and for this reason I</B>
<BR><B>tend to be a little suspicious when someone tells me</B>
<BR><B>about any strange experience they've had. I always try</B>
<BR><B>to look for a logical and scientific explanation. What</B>
<BR><B>I'm about to relate to you happened to my son Jesse</B>
<BR><B>about 6 months ago, and terrified him so much that he</B>
<BR><B>still sleeps in my mom's room at the foot of her bed.</B>
<BR><B>My two sons Jesse and Nicky (they're 24 and 18</B>
<BR><B>respectively) live with my mother in Huntington Beach</B>
<BR><B>because they both attend college in California. They</B>
<BR><B>both share a room in my mom's two story house. On</B>
<BR><B>occasion, my grandfather will come to stay with my</B>
<BR><B>mother, and my sons always give him their bedroom so</B>
<BR><B>he'll be more comfortable, and they sleep downstairs</B>
<BR><B>in the family room in sleeping bags. On this</B>
<BR><B>particular night, everyone else had gone to bed and my</B>
<BR><B>sons had set out their sleeping bags on the family</B>
<BR><B>room floor and had just settled down to watch some</B>
<BR><B>television.&nbsp; Nicky fell asleep almost immediately, but</B>
<BR><B>Jesse (who had taken the position next to the wall)</B>
<BR><B>stayed awake watching a program that he liked. Just</B>
<BR><B>then a commercial came on and he closed his eyes for a</B>
<BR><B>second to rest them until the program started again.</B>
<BR><B>Suddenly, just out of the blue, he heard whispering in</B>
<BR><B>his right ear. It was a masculine voice and it started</B>
<BR><B>out whispering softly but quickly got louder and</B>
<BR><B>louder although he couldn't make out the words. The</B>
<BR><B>first thing he thought was "how did Nicky get over on</B>
<BR><B>the other side of me without my noticing him? And how</B>
<BR><B>did he wedge himself into the space between me and the</B>
<BR><B>wall?"&nbsp; This all happened in a split second, and he</B>
<BR><B>immediately opened his eyes, but to his horror he saw</B>
<BR><B>that Nicky was still sound asleep and hadn't moved</B>
<BR><B>from his position. Just then something caught his eye</B>
<BR><B>on the ceiling on top of him, and when he looked up,</B>
<BR><B>he saw a grey mist floating above him close to the</B>
<BR><B>ceiling. At first the mist was up high, but it slowly</B>
<BR><B>began to descend towards his face. By this time he was</B>
<BR><B>really scared and tried to wake his brother up, but</B>
<BR><B>found he was frozen and couldn't move a muscle. So all</B>
<BR><B>he could do was lay there while the mist came down,</B>
<BR><B>first over his face, then lower on his torso, and then</B>
<BR><B>down towards his feet. It just hovered a few inches</B>
<BR><B>above him, and he says that wherever it moved, he felt</B>
<BR><B>an extremely hot, burning sensation. (I find this odd,</B>
<BR><B>since everyone else always says they experience an icy</B>
<BR><B>cold feeling) When it got to his feet, the mist</B>
<BR><B>started to move again towards his face. It continued</B>
<BR><B>to do this several more times, all the while Jesse was</B>
<BR><B>unable to move. He was conscious of the t.v. program</B>
<BR><B>he had been watching, the commercial was over, and the</B>
<BR><B>show had started again, he could see the t.v. through</B>
<BR><B>the mist. He kept hoping it would go away, but it</B>
<BR><B>didn't. It just hovered there, moving back and forth.</B>
<BR><B>Finally, it occurred to him to pray. He remembers that</B>
<BR><B>he silently repeated the Lord's Prayer 3 or 4 times,</B>
<BR><B>and then he just began begging God in earnest to</B>
<BR><B>protect him. Suddenly the mist just faded away. As</B>
<BR><B>soon as that happened, he was able to move again and</B>
<BR><B>immediately screamed out his brother's name. Nicky</B>
<BR><B>woke up and when he heard what had happened he refused</B>
<BR><B>to sleep in the family room any longer. They were both</B>
<BR><B>now thoroughly spooked and decided to take their</B>
<BR><B>blankets into the living room, and sleep together on</B>
<BR><B>the couch. They tried to get to sleep, but they began</B>
<BR><B>to hear strange noises in the kitchen, as if someone</B>
<BR><B>were rummaging through the cabinets. They both heard</B>
<BR><B>the noises. By this time they had had just about</B>
<BR><B>enough, and they made a run for it, up the stairs to</B>
<BR><B>my mom's bedroom and dove into her bed, to sleep with</B>
<BR><B>her. These are both college students who have never</B>
<BR><B>used drugs, who don't drink, who aren't proned to</B>
<BR><B>imagining things, and who are both active, healthy,</B>
<BR><B>athletic soccer players. When they told me about this</B>
<BR><B>experience (skeptic that I am) I immediately began</B>
<BR><B>searching on the internet for some sort of information</B>
<BR><B>on night terrors or extremely vivid dreams, (the fact</B>
<BR><B>that most people seem to see these things at night</B>
<BR><B>when they've been sleeping makes me highly</B>
<BR><B>suspicious), and I did find a very interesting page on</B>
<BR><B>sleep disorders, and what is called the "Hag</B>
<BR><B>Phenomena". I said as much to Jesse, and he read the</B>
<BR><B>information, but he was adamant, that what he</B>
<BR><B>experienced was real. He says that he had not been</B>
<BR><B>asleep, and during the entire episode he was fully</B>
<BR><B>aware of the program that was on t.v. since he could</B>
<BR><B>actually see it through the mist. And he had enough</B>
<BR><B>time to say several silent prayers before it</B>
<BR><B>dissapeared. This doesn't seem to be consistent with</B>
<BR><B>Hag Phenomena. So, the bottom line is, I don't know</B>
<BR><B>what he saw. As a side note, my brother who also lives</B>
<BR><B>there, and who is about as UN-phsychic as I am, has</B>
<BR><B>tried desperately to see the "ghost", and has been</B>
<BR><B>sleeping in the same exact spot Jesse was in for the</B>
<BR><B>last six months, in hopes of catching a glimpse of it,</B>
<BR><B>but much to his dissapointment, he hasn't seen a</B>
<BR><B>thing.</B>

<P><B>Seabrook Texas: Toddville Mansion</B>

<P><B>By: thx8675@charter.net</B>

<P><B>From your Web Page: Seabrook - Toddville Road - the former Toddville
Mansion, which has recently been torn down, the property turned into apartments
or condos. Reports of a strange creature roaming the grounds, noises, feelings
of being watched, shadowy figures.</B>
<BR><B>Actually this mansion is was the List Mansion. The story of this
place was well known to the people of Seabrook who lived their at the time.
I&nbsp; lived near the List Mansion for many years.</B>
<BR><B>Several acres of land were bought by a Houston buisness owner in
the late 70's early 80's right on Galveston Bay near the intersection of
Toddville Rd. and East Meyer Rd. Bill List was his name and for the most
part at first no-one knew who he was, only that their was a major construction
project going up near the Bay.</B>
<BR><B>Bill List owned a trailer manufacturing buisness and with the success
of his business came great wealth. The mansion was a massive undertaking,
built up on several feet of soil the three story brick structure dwarfed
the modest homes surrounding the property.&nbsp; The brick foundry where
Bill was buying the bricks for his&nbsp; mansion was unable to keep up
production of&nbsp; bricks for the mansion and bricks for other products
so Bill just bought the brick foundry so all the bricks made could go into
his construction project.</B>
<BR><B>Month by month the mansion began to take shape. The stark brick
structure was three stories tall, four if you count the massive garage
on the ground level. All the windows on every floor featured wrought iron
bars. It was divided into two separate sections with a large glassed in
garden and pool. Catwalks on the second floor crossed from the front of
the house to the back part. the rooms were arranged into separate apartments
with kitchens, bathrooms and living areas.&nbsp; The entire property was
surrounded by a brick wall from Toddville Rd., the List Mansion (as it
was called) resembled a prison which was not far from true.</B>
<BR><B>When construction was completed, Me and some friends were in the
Kroger parking lot in Seabrook when two guys a little older than us invited
us to a "big party to celebrate the opening of the List Mansion". we talked
to them for a few minuets and they left. We did not go to the party.</B>
<BR><B>For years after that you rarely saw anyone coming or going from
the mansion, even though several families could live there at the same
time and never see each other. The Guys we saw at Krogers that day never
showed up anywhere in town. Then one day Bill List was dead, Murdered and
the whole story came out&nbsp; in the Daily Citizen, the&nbsp; Bay Area
News Paper.</B>
<BR><B>The list Mansion was built like a prison, not to keep people out
but to keep people in. As it turns out Bill List had a preference for younger
men and would cruse the alleyways and parts of Houston where runaways would
frequent. He would offer them a place to stay and drugs in return for his
indulgences for the young men.</B>
<BR><B>Bill would keep them drugged and locked in the mansion, providing
every thing for them but freedom. Some would stay and others would eventually
be let go but it was the final group of guys who figured it all out. They
decided that Bill List must die, so one day they got a hold of a shotgun
and waited for Bill to come home from work. Bill never made it up the stairs
from the garage before he was shot and killed. The guys who killed him
ransacked the mansion, stole Bills credit cards and car and left. Some
were picked up on their way to Canada others were caught in&nbsp; the Houston
area.</B>
<BR><B>For years after the death of Bill List, the mansion was up for sale
and yet no-one would buy it. Care takers were brought in to maintain the
property and eventually a bunch of people who had a rock and roll band
rented it for awhile. I moved from Seabrook in the early '90's,&nbsp; Eventually,
the list mansion was bought by a real estate land develper and he tore
down the List mansion. In it's place was built stucco condos with clay
tile roofs. There is nothing left of the list mansion except the sorted
stories of the long time residents of Seabrook.</B>
<BR><B>These are my memmories of the List&nbsp; Mansion.</B>

<BR><B>Secrets of a Childhood Home</B>

<P><B>By: Zatura88@aol.com</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Remembering back when I was 5, It all started. I lived
in a house in Terre haute, Indiana. I had recurring nightmares about a
man who was chasing me with a large object that looked like a huge sewing
pen. He would stab me continuously but his speech seemed slow. I could
feel my life force being drawn away and then I was watching the room from
above. I would been drawn by a light that led through my bedroom closet
and would see myself lying on a cement slab. I was about 30, blonde hair
and a man was standing over me. My family was terrorized by my running
through the house screaming for my life yet, no one could wake me up and
if someone touched me, I would freak out and they say that I possessed
enormous strength for only being 5 years old. This went on as long as I
lived in this house, which was at age 10, we moved. I must add that when
I played in the basement. I often felt a sudden disecruited me to help
her clean the place up. I was reluctant to go into the house and when we
went to the basement where a boy I went to school made his room down there.
It was freaky. There was graffiti all over the walls in paint that looked
like blood. It had everything from help me, to die. I never knew if the
messages was coming from the killer or from the woman killed. I asked my
father recently, if someone was drawn to the closet in the bedroom. What
was under that closet and he replied "The cellar" I constantly worry about
the people who occupy the house now because there is a daycare and they
built a fortress type privacy fence all the way around it, even the front.
I thought about writing them and request an investigation. We'll see. I
honestly feel there is a body within that cement slab in the basement that
has wanted to get discovered.</B>

<P><B>Shadowy Figure In Woods</B>

<P><B>By: JNAHOBBS@TRELLIS.NET</B>

<P><B>Being a Catholic I belive there is an afterlife(heaven, ect.) and
spirts occasionally visit people here on earth.</B>
<BR><B>One winter my family and I (mom, dad, and two younger sisters) went
to visit and help out my grandparents, who had recently cleared some land
they owned on the Tennessee river, move in to thier new home.&nbsp; The
land they had bought had many lengends accompanying it including stories
of gold and ghosts.&nbsp; My sisters and I were very interested in exploring
the 25 acres of wooded land that had an old Civil War homeplace on it.&nbsp;
An old country store was located about a mile away and this was the only
neighbors my grandparents had.</B>
<BR><B>When we arrived, there was a 50 foot long, 15 foot high pile of
cut down trees that had been piled up to made room for the new house.&nbsp;
This was a great jungle gym for my sisters and I to play and hide on, being
as it was a long way from the house.</B>
<BR><B>One day my mom took my youngest sister on a walk around the woods
while my other sister and I stayed on the wood pile looking into the woods.&nbsp;
I saw this black, four foot high figure scrambling from tree to tree.&nbsp;
At first I thought it was my youngest sister running around, so I called
her name.&nbsp; She answered from the opposite direction of the figure
that I saw.&nbsp; By that time I was really frantic, in tears, and running
home because I could still see the figure moving extremly fast.&nbsp; It
was so fast I would only see it for about two seconds at a time before
it went behind another tree.</B>
<BR><B>When everyone was in the house I told them, but my grandpa brushed
it off as "a bear" (there are no bears in the area that he lives in), so
I felt better.&nbsp; About a week later after my family and I had left
more people were beginning to have "experiences", I guess you could say.</B>
<BR><B>My grandpa had taken his dog out one night when he heard a woman's
voice, faintly yell, "Help me!"&nbsp; The dog began to bark, so my grandpa
got in his truck and began to circle his property, looking in the ditches
for an injured woman.&nbsp; He found no one and went home.</B>
<BR><B>About three months later a lady was changing a sign outside of the
country store around closing time.&nbsp; Extremly scared and shook up,
she quit her job because she had seen a quick, black, shadowy figure coming
from my grandparents woods.</B>
<BR><B>We still don't know what is living in my grandparent's woods, but
other people have seen it so I know it's not a figure of my imagination.</B>

<BR><B>Shadowy Figure</B>

<P><B>By: ncoody1@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>One night about 13 years ago, my brother and I were</B>
<BR><B>Christmas caroling with friends around our block. We</B>
<BR><B>were about 10 or 11 at the time. After ending the</B>
<BR><B>night my brother and I said goodbye to the last of our</B>
<BR><B>friends who had turned in for the night. We were</B>
<BR><B>riding doubles on a bike that night. My brother</B>
<BR><B>pedaling, we approached the edge of the driveway when</B>
<BR><B>he suddenly stopped. We both looked across the street.</B>
<BR><B>I said "Do you see what I see?" He replied, "Yes!"</B>
<BR><B>Happening very quickly, across the street, was a dark</B>
<BR><B>shadowy figure (void of prominent features)</B>
<BR><B>approximately 7 feet tall. When it began to approach</B>
<BR><B>us, we through the bike down and we were able to slide</B>
<BR><B>under the electric garage door (still in the process</B>
<BR><B>of closing). We were able to summon our friend's dad</B>
<BR><B>to investigate, but nothing. That night we rode our</B>
<BR><B>fannies home about 8 houses down. Amazingly, we never</B>
<BR><B>mentioned it to our parents who were waiting in the</B>
<BR><B>driveway to take us to the town's Candy Cane Lane. We</B>
<BR><B>have since told them about everything, and to this day</B>
<BR><B>when I visit home and happen to walk that corner of</B>
<BR><B>the block at night, I am constantly looking over my</B>
<BR><B>shoulder and feel as though I being watched.</B>

<BR><B>Haunted Home Place</B>

<P><B>By: andreabooth2000@yahoo.com</B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Hello, I read your site often.&nbsp; I have been trying for about
a month now to get up enough nerve to send my story so here goes.&nbsp;
You can give me your opinion if you want but I really just wanted to share
something.&nbsp; I don't tell alot of people this and my mother all but
refuses to talk about it at all (understandable considering the circumstances)
Plus I only know a few things about what happend because my mother would
only tell me so much before freaking out.&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall start with
a brief introduction.</B>
<BR><B>Okay, I grew up in a small town and for about a year we lived in
a haunted house when I was just 2 years old or so. In other words I don't
remember specific things just feelings.</B>
<BR><B>It all started when my mother and father moved from South Carolina
to Kentucky. They rented an old house with a huge basement.&nbsp; (this
was told to me by my mother)&nbsp; I don't remember much about the house
so this is all second hand information.&nbsp; They had lived there only
about a month when my mother and older sister started noticing things.&nbsp;
They told me that I was the focus of this spirit as it would do things
to me or around me. here is a few of the things that happend to me when
I was little.</B>
<BR><B>One time my mother and sister was sitting in the living room watching
TV. I had a little wooden rocking chair that I loved to sit in. My father
was at work working the night shift in the coal mines.&nbsp; Mom said all
of a sudden things got very cold and my little rocking chair started rocking
very fast and the rocking tossed me out onto the floor. Then the chair
fell backwards against the wall (with noone in it by the way) and my mother
and my sister both heard a very dull laughing.</B>
<BR><B>My mother said that the thing in the house would push me, and a
few times when she was watching me play on the front porch would pick me
up and drop me down hard on the ground.&nbsp; My mother says that she was
terrified to leave me alone. Then another time my big sister and her best
friend was playing with me in the front yard and my mother said she heard
them screaming for her.&nbsp; When she went out in the yard my sister and
her friend was holding on to me and crying.&nbsp; I was trying to go down&nbsp;
the little hill into a little field below our house begging to go play
with "it".&nbsp; My sister to this day swears that she and her friend saw
a big black figure hiding behind a tree motioning for me to come to it
and what was scary was that I was going.&nbsp; My sisters friend refused
to come visit her at her house after that episode.</B>
<BR><B>My mother told me that I told her its name ( I won't repeat it here
for it makes me have anxiety attacks) and that it lived in a deep dark
hole in the ground. down in the field below our house.&nbsp; My mother
went looking for a hole in the ground and she found an old well that had
been boarded up and the weeds had grown over it pretty bad so it was very
difficult to see.&nbsp; (She didn't tell me if she experienced anything
there or not but she wouldn't talk about it with me) She kept begging my
father to move.&nbsp; My mother said it would laugh at her and she was
constantly scared.</B>
<BR><B>Finally, one night when my dad was home something happend that made
my dad rethink and take my mother seriously.&nbsp; My parents were in bed
and it was pretty late.&nbsp; My father looked up and noticed the shadow
of someone staring at him in the darkness.&nbsp; My dad at first thought
it was my sister so he raised up and asked her what was wrong.&nbsp; The
thing laughed and my mother screamed that it wasnt my sister because the
shadow was too big to be my sister.&nbsp; When she screamed my dad jumped
up to turn on the lights and it laughed again and disappeared.&nbsp; From
then on my dad took what my mother said seriously.&nbsp; After a while
my dad was able to buy a piece of land and we moved and according to my
mother not a minute too soon.&nbsp; To this day my mother refuses to talk
about it.</B>
<BR><B>I didn't find out about this until years later when I was watching
TV about 15 years old or so.&nbsp; I saw a commercial for cat food with
the same name of the thing that had haunted us years before.&nbsp; ( I
had no idea about this because my mother didn't tell me about until afterward)&nbsp;
Anyway, As soon as I heard the commercial and name of the cat food I had
an anxiety attack.&nbsp; When I told my mother what happend she turned
very pale and told me some of the story.</B>
<BR><B>Some history of the house after we moved out.&nbsp; There was a
man and his daughter who moved into the house.&nbsp; He was a single father
so he had his mother move into the house with him to help him take care
of his daughter while he worked. Within two years of them living there
the man went crazy and one night killed himself with a gun.&nbsp; The daughter
and her grandmother moved out the night of his suicide and moved away to
another state.&nbsp; No one ever lived in the house again.&nbsp; It stood
empty for years and the house started falling apart.&nbsp; The owner had
since died along time ago and everyone just sort of ignored the old house.&nbsp;
(my mother never told anyone of our experiences).&nbsp; Finally, about
6 or 7 years ago they tore down the house and the basement and they built
a community volunteer fire department on the property.&nbsp; That building
isn't exactly where the house was. It stands about 30 or so feet from where
the original house stood.&nbsp; Anyway things seem to be prett</B>
<BR><B>Anyway that is my story.&nbsp; I have had other experiences as an
adult but I will save those for another day. Thanks for listening.</B>

<BR><B>Skeleton in the Car</B>

<P><B>By: jessi0303@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>This is a story my mom told me that happened when I was young. She,
he</B>
<BR><B>then boyfriend, Darin and a bunch of friends decided one night to
go to</B>
<BR><B>this street called Sleepy Hollow that was rumored to be haunted.
While</B>
<BR><B>there nothing very eventful happened. They saw an old abandoned
car</B>
<BR><B>sitting off the side of the road. Darin thought it would be a cool</B>
<BR><B>picture to take so he snapped a photo of it. After that they all</B>
<BR><B>decided to leave. A few days later Darin got the film developed.
When</B>
<BR><B>looking at the photo of the car there was no one in it, but when
you</B>
<BR><B>look at the negative you could see a skeleton in the driver's seat</B>
<BR><B>looking in their direction.</B>

<P><B>Some More Spooky Stories</B>

<P><B>By: jenniferwilcox@nexicom.net</B>

<P><B>Hey there again, I just recalled some more ghost stories that I'd
like to share with everyone at this site.&nbsp; I'll start off with a few
more experiences involving my mother.&nbsp; Okay...28 years ago, my mother
was up extremely late one night studying for an exam.&nbsp; It was around
3 am and everyone was alseep.&nbsp; She decided to turn in for the night
and began to collect her books on a pile on her desk.&nbsp; As she pushed
her chair out to stand up, she heard a destinct voice filtering from the
register above her desk say, "Good night, Christina".&nbsp; She froze for
a few minutes before going to her siblings' rooms to see if anyone was
playing a practical joke, but everyone was fast asleep, plus, the vent
above her desk ran up to the attic, and was not connected to anyone else's
room...</B>
<BR><B>A few years ago my aunt died unexpectedly and though she and my
mother weren't particularily close, she was devistated.&nbsp; Years passed
and on the anniversary of my aunt's death, my mother had a vivid dream
of her sister.&nbsp; In the dream the two were sitting drinking coffee
and chatting.&nbsp; My aunt said, "Goodbye" suddenly in the dream and my
mother awoke.&nbsp; She felt as if her whole body was paralized and could
not get up.&nbsp; A minute or two passed and suddenly, this huge weight
began to lift itself from my mother's body.&nbsp; As the presence left,
my mom sat up slowly and when the weight was completely gone, the sensor
light near the back door went on (she could see the light filtering from
the spare room into the hallway).</B>
<BR><B>Here are a few little things that have happened to me...</B>
<BR><B>when I was a child, I spent Easter at my grandparent's house in
Quebec.&nbsp; I slept on the couch in the living room because all the other
rooms were occupied with other family members.&nbsp; I'll remind you that
I still believed in the Easter Bunny at this point of my life.&nbsp; Early
Easter morning, around 4 am, I awoke to the sound of someone walking across
the living room floor.&nbsp; I opened my eyes and saw a figure moving across
the room a few feet from the couch on which I was sleeping.&nbsp; I immediately
got excited thinking it was the Easter bunny but then became really confused
when it stopped infront of the window.&nbsp; The street lamp outside was
casting light throughout the room and I DESTINCTLY saw the figure.&nbsp;
It was facing me, and though I couldn't see it's features, I knew it was
looking at me.&nbsp; I sat there, afraid now because this figure looked
nothing like a rabbit, but a regular person.&nbsp; I then gathered my courage
and quickly turned on the lamp that was beside my head.&nbsp; As the light
went on, the figure vanished.&nbsp; I was around eight years old, and remember
this experience very vividly, but then again, kids memories are rather
questionable...I don't really know what to think.</B>
<BR><B>Last February a friend and I went to a graveyard one night and took
pictures to see if we could snag some neat and scary pictures of some spirits.&nbsp;
The night was rather uneventful, and as we walked the path back to my car,
we heard someone throwing stones at one of those little sheds you find
in cemetaries.&nbsp; We whirled around and saw no one.&nbsp; I got this
sick feeling come over me and was suddenly very afraid.&nbsp; We walked
very quickly and went home.&nbsp; From that night on, strange things began
to happen in my room and other places.&nbsp; That night I was awakened
by soft voices speaking to eachother.&nbsp; I wasn't afraid because I immediatly
thought it was my radio (I listen to it when I go to sleep), so I turned
it off, and went back to sleep.&nbsp; About a minute later a heard the
voices again.&nbsp; Petrified with fear, I shivered under my covers for
a good ten minutes, listening, trying to verify what I was hearing.&nbsp;
I finally got up the courage to bolt out of my room and into my brother's
room.&nbsp; I sat at the end of his bed crying hysterically.&nbsp; I made
such a comotion that my mother came up from her room (which is now in the
basement), to see what was wrong.&nbsp; I ended sleeping in my mom's room.&nbsp;
I slept in the spare bedroom the next night, and the night after that,
and the fourth night, I tried to sleep in my room again.&nbsp; The same
thing happened.&nbsp; But this time I listened hard, to make sure it wasn't
someone else in the house making the noise.&nbsp; The voices were so strange,
they were far away, but right there in my room, above me, all around me.&nbsp;
That night they sounded like they were fighting, but whispering...loudly.&nbsp;
I knew for sure that I wasn't hearing things.&nbsp; My room now has this
uncomfortable air to it.&nbsp; I hate being in there - anytime of the day.&nbsp;
The thing is, now I'm in university and my brother is moved into my old
room, and he's claimed to have heard strange sounds, and one night he claimed
his bed started to shake under it's own power.&nbsp; My mother thought
we were just spooking ourselves out, but a few weeks ago she was telling
me that one morning, while getting ready for work, down in her room,she
heard a loud knocking on her door.&nbsp; My brother stayed at a friend's
that night, and there was no one else home.&nbsp; She went and opened the
door and no one was there, obviously.&nbsp; She ignored it and figured
she mistook the banging as her imagination.&nbsp; But right after she carried
on with her morning routine, another three loud knocks.&nbsp; She was frightened,
nothing else has happened to her since, but she's convinced that I brought
someone, or something home with me that night I went to the graveyard.</B>
<BR><B>And I have ONE more story; okay, I live in residence at the univerisity
I attend.&nbsp; I live in a big house downtown (it's owned by the school),
and it is OLD.&nbsp; It was built in 1864, but there are no reported hauntings.&nbsp;
This kind of dissapointed me because as much as I fear ghosts and the unknown,
I really like having stories to tell.&nbsp; Anyhoo, a few things HAVE actually
happened.&nbsp; One night, about a week ago, my roomate was out for the
night and I had the room to myself.&nbsp; Around 2 am I was awakened by
the sound of someone walking across the floor, pretty loudly, and I was
ticked that my roomate would make such a raquet so late at night.&nbsp;
So I shot up to tell her to be quiet, but no one was there.&nbsp; The room
was pitch black, and silent.&nbsp; My roomate wasn't home, and no one was
awake on my floor (there are only two other people on my floor and they
live way down the hall).&nbsp; I was so scared that I put my headphones
on for the rest of the night until I finally fell asleep again.&nbsp; Other
weird things happen too.&nbsp; I've had a few mysterious knocks on my door
- which is always open, so when I shoot around to see who it is and tell
them to come in, there's no one there.&nbsp; plus, my hallway is far too
long to not hear someone run away if they were playing a trick.&nbsp; It's
happened quite a number of times now.&nbsp; The lamps in my room will turn
on and off by themselves, as well as the tv, objects will be moved to strange
places - for example, I found my phone in my laudry basket in my closet,
on the top of my lamp shade on my desk, behind my bed - all when I've specifically
placed the cordless phone back on it's cradle to recharge.&nbsp; And two
nights ago, while falling asleep, I noticed a strange blue light filtering
underneath my door.&nbsp; There is an exit sign in the hall that glows
at night, but it's red.&nbsp; So I went to open the door to check it out
and it faded away.&nbsp; A few people have mentioned that they see a blue
light in their halls on the middle level of the house as well.&nbsp; The
only ghost that could possibly be in the house is the spirit of a young
girl who commited suicide in the 1980's.&nbsp; Well, that's about it, hope
you enjoyed the stories.</B>
<BR><B>I'll write again about some other stories about the old residential
houses in my area that are true and have intelligent people to back-up
the claims.</B>

<P><B>Someday I will Find Out</B>

<P><B>By: Chickiediva@Microsoft.com</B>

<P><B>Hi there. I believe that I have had a true experience with a haunting.
I used to live in Apartment 205 in Kings Wood Apt. in Fresno Ca. A lot
of weird stuff used to happen there while my family and I lived there.
I am Hmong. My religion is not christianity although I do no doubt that
there is a God. I do believe in Jesus Christ but I was simply not raised
that way. My family on both my father and mother's side are shamen. Many
do not believe our customs and ways to&nbsp; be valid but you'd be suprised
by how much sense it makes...to us at least. I grew up around shamen all
my life listening to chants and stuff. It's awesome. Well...</B>
<BR><B>enough talk...here's my story.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was a little girl growing up in California
and being in a Hmong family, I grew up with spirits and ghosts and hauntings
all around me. I accept it for it is real to me. Although I've never experienced
an actual haunting myself, being around my family of shamen forced me to
acknowledge the supernatural. But when I was 9...I did have an experiement
of my own. Our apartment has always been rumored to be haunted. As a child...I
never really paid much mind to it. Weird things happen at night. Things
go bump in the night. Dishes rattle and doors slam. I woke up every night
from a nightmare I couldn't remember and crawled into bed with my parents.
My sisters complained about seeing dark shadows moving across her walls.
In our culture, hauntings happen because it it caused by some or something
that is associated with the family or someone in the family. In our case...it
was my mother. I remember one time my mother was cleaning the tub and I
was standing out in the hallway watching her. All of a sudden the door
slammed and the lights went out. I heard the lock in the door click in
place and my mother screamed. I stood frozen in my spot unable to comprehend
what I just saw. I banged against the door and then it opened. The lights
were back on and my mom was still in the tub. Naturally she accused my
of doing it. To this day I still don't know what had happened. There was
a time that something happened to me, not long afterwards, that scared
me so bad I forgot about it until a couple of years ago. I remember it
being around noon and I was off on summer vacation. I had just finished
the third grade. I was laying on my mother's bed reading a book given me
by a former teacher. I started to have this funny feeling all over my body.
More like an awareness that something was watching me or something was
near me. All of a sudden the bed started to shake. I felt something, hands
maybe, holding me down on the bed and I was unable to move or even say
anything. Not even a scream. The bed literally shook for a few seconds.
It was over in a matter of minutes but it scared my terribly. I jumped
off the bed and ran into the living room. To this day I've never told my
parents or hardly anyone. Those that I have told thought I was joking.
Was I? Yet the memory is so vivid...and I remember that feeling of helplessness
and fright. It was weird. I sort of forced myself to forget about it until
a couple of years later when my class was asked to write about an actual
haunting that we know about. I don't know but things are weird. My shaman
grandfathers (both maternal and paternal) came to our house to "bless"
our room. They performed their ritual in our room on my mother's bed. I
remember something about someone dying or commiting suicide in our closet.
But it was so long ago I can't remember much about it. My mom has been
having dreams about a little girl carrying a knife chasing her through
a rice field in ThaiLand. My grandfathers did this chant thing and all
this stuff (too much to explain) to capture this Thing. They locked her
up in two bowls that has been sealed and chained together. Part of the
chain that was used to seal it was made into an anklet brace that my mother
wears around her ankle at all times. The trap used to capture it was something
that my grandfathers did. To this day my mother is doing better. No more
Chucky-like girls chasing her. The bowls were taken to my mom's father's
altar and locked up. When he past on...it was given to my mother to keep
safe. So now...it's in our bathroom closet on the top self. Every time
we open the door...there it is...Scary!!! I get the creepiest feelings
when I look at it. So...you wonder.... what exactly is going on and what
happened? I couldn't tell you...but something did happen...and I've never
been able to forget it. Could it be some evil spirit or poltergeist? Who
knows? Maybe one day...I'll find out eventually.</B>

<P><B>Something Here</B>

<P><B>By: Mytwan@msn.com</B>

<P><B>When I moved here over ten years ago, it didn't take me long to figure
out that there is something strange about this house. A bit of history,
This little town is in the middle of that area where there was a lot of
Indian trouble a century ago and also mountain men roamed this area trapping.
This area is close to where the Wild Bunch outlaw gang holed up too. Anyway
this town was a big city that never really happened. It was all mapped
out to be a big town by Tom Hamilton and his brother but the oil boom went
bust and it is just a few scattered houses now.&nbsp; Most of the houses
were moved in here from the oil camp and this one was the cook shack back
there.&nbsp; It was cut in two and the ends put together at right angles.
The kitchen is in what was one end while the rest of the house is the other
end. I don't know what there is but most of the "strange happenings" are
in the kitchen. The light goes on and off without the switch moving. It
burns out the bulbs frequently but I've come in at night and the light
is burning brightly but the switch is off. In fact moving the switch has
no effect on the light. It is not a defective switch either because we
replaced the switch twice when we first noticed it. It still happens. There
has been times when the door slammed very hard but there was no wind or
even a breeze to make it slam. Sometimes there are the sound of footsteps
but no one is there. I guess what bothers me most is the very strong smell
of cigar or pipe smoke that is in the bedroom a lot of the time. It is
so strong, that breathing can be difficult yet none of us smoke. I've also
smelled that strong smell of smoke outside along the creek several times.&nbsp;
I started asking questions and so far I don't know why it is my house but
it seems that some people that lived in this area earlier, often saw this
man dressed in buckskins and smoking a pipe.&nbsp; He would be walking
along and just disappear but the smell of his pipe would remain. I have
never seen him but I often smell his pipe. I do not think he is trying
to harm anyone though and often he seems to be here to warn me of something
bad happening, just a friendly presence to let me know he is still here.
I don't know why but I call him Martin and he seems to like that. I've
also told him I don't like the smoke in my room and I haven't smelled it
as much lately.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp; My Childhood and Teen House</B>

<P><B>By: the-mitchells@mindspring.com</B>

<P><B>I used to live in a house on Panola Rd. in Ellenwood, Ga. After we
moved there (I was in 5th grade at the time) it didn’t take long for me
to feel funny feelings especially at night. They were feelings of a cold
feeling and like something evil was watching me.&nbsp; From the den to
the hallway to the bedrooms, there was a door that you could close that
separated that hallway from the den. Sometimes when&nbsp; I was a teenager
I would stay up later in the den watching television. We had stairs that
went from the living room to the downstairs. Now part of our downstairs
were a finished basement, with part (closed by a door) that was not finished.
There was like a downstairs den, another bedroom, washing and dryer area,
small bathroom and a garage with the garage door facing the back yard.
I&nbsp; would get this feeling of evil watching me from those downstairs
and all I could think was I had to get thru that door to the hallway where
the three bedrooms were.&nbsp; Once I was thru that door I would feel safe.
I later found out that my mother would have this same experience and have
to thru that door to the bedrooms. Now is that not strange?&nbsp; I also
found out my sister had strange experiences as well.&nbsp; Now my grandmother
( my mother’s mother) lived there at the time and she was a devout Christian
and a praying woman. She later died in my later teen years from cancer.
A lot of the things happened while she was still alive. I believe whatever
entity was present in that house did not want to go to those back bedrooms
because of my praying grandmother. I don’t know if my grandmother ever
had any of these negative experiences that we had. One night my mother
slept in the downstairs bedroom. I can’t remember why. This is what happened
as told by my mother: she had just lain down on the bed with all the lights
out when she heard the sound of very loud footsteps like someone with boots
on coming down the stairs. She thought it was my stepfather. She thought
it odd that he didn’t turn on the light as he came down stairs. Well, those
footsteps kept walking thru the downstairs living room, by the bedroom
door&nbsp; and opened the door to the garage door and closed it.&nbsp;
She immediately jumped up&nbsp; and ran to the garage, turning on the lights
and nothing was there!&nbsp; She ran upstairs and checked on everyone and
everyone was sound asleep. Needless to say she never slept down there again.&nbsp;
After my grandmother died,&nbsp; I started sleeping in her room. She had
always wanted me to have her room.&nbsp; I&nbsp; remembered one time I
was in there trying to sleep and I sensed something evil watching me at
the foot of my bed.&nbsp; It was a dark shadowy figure. I said some scripture
and rebuked it in Jesus name and it was gone. I don’t remember&nbsp; it
ever happening again.&nbsp; The only other thing that ever happened&nbsp;
in that bedroom was a positive thing. I remembered being sick in bed&nbsp;
and I know I saw my grandmother’s spirit in her old rocking chair looking
over me. It was very comforting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now that I am out of that house I have not had these negative experiences.
The whole family has since moved from there.&nbsp; I&nbsp; am now happily
married going on 16 years now with two wonderful boys.&nbsp; The only unusual
thing that has happened since than is when my beloved father-in-law died
from cancer. He used to smoke cigars years before his diagnosis and I and
my boys have definitely sensed his presence and during those times we smell
cigar scent, and there is a cold sensation as well. This of course is a
comforting feeling not scary. This happens in the house he shared with
his wife. Thanks for taking the time to read my story. It’s nice to know
there are people who understand and believe you. Believe me this is not
something I’ve shared with others outside the family.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<P><B>Spirit Story</B>

<P><B>By: pam7@mindspring.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>Hello.&nbsp; My name is Pam Serafin.&nbsp; My boyfriend, Justin
Riley, died on August 4,</B>
<BR><B>2002.&nbsp; His death was tragic and untimely.&nbsp; Justin had
a CBR Honda sport bike</B>
<BR><B>that he loved to ride.&nbsp; He was always very careful on his bike
and never</B>
<BR><B>wrecked it.&nbsp; One day he was riding with his friend's near the
Shenandoah</B>
<BR><B>Mountains in Woodstock, Virginia.&nbsp; He was riding fast with
another friend and</B>
<BR><B>came to a hill.&nbsp; No one knows what happened on the hill to
cause him to crash</B>
<BR><B>and die.&nbsp; Both he and his friend crashed, but his friend lived
while Justin</B>
<BR><B>died instantly.&nbsp; His friend isn't telling anyone anything about
the accident.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, about a month and a half after Justin died I was emailing
back and</B>
<BR><B>forth to my friend on the computer.&nbsp; We were talking about
Justin and I</B>
<BR><B>started to feel very weird.&nbsp; I felt as if someone was watching
me.&nbsp; I looked</B>
<BR><B>to my right and I saw Justin standing there, just staring at my
computer.&nbsp; It</B>
<BR><B>was as if he was reading what I was writing.&nbsp; He had his hands
on his hips,</B>
<BR><B>like he used to do, and had this look on his face as if he was upset.&nbsp;
He</B>
<BR><B>wasn't in color, sort of like grayish or clear.&nbsp; I couldn't
believe my eyes</B>
<BR><B>when I saw him.&nbsp; He was only there for a&nbsp; brief moment.&nbsp;
I was scared, happy</B>
<BR><B>and didn't know what to do at that point.&nbsp; Then after that
I heard a noise in</B>
<BR><B>my kitchen, like clanking of dishes and my son's pampers fell off
the table.</B>
<BR><B>I have seen Justin 3 other times after that, which makes me wonder
if he is</B>
<BR><B>earthbound.&nbsp; My 3 year old son has told me that Justin has
been in his room on</B>
<BR><B>his bed.&nbsp; This is my story, nothing very extravegant but I
still take it as a</B>
<BR><B>blessing.&nbsp; I was able to see Justin a couple more times and
each time I did I</B>
<BR><B>just had to smile.&nbsp; Thank you and God Bless, Pam.</B>

<P><B>Spirits of the Wimbledon Square Apartments</B>

<P><B>By: GOTTALUVME641606@aol.com</B>

<P><B>2 Years ago I had&nbsp; My candles burning and the smell of Vanilla
was in the air I was laying on my couch one night watching unsolved mysteries,
a picture of Shandra Levy was being flashed on the screen and a number
on the TV for anyone with information about her disappearance to please
call. At the same time, Out of nowhere a very pungent smell of rotten flesh
filled the room.</B>
<BR><B>I sat up and instantly said outloud (where in the hell is that coming
from)?&nbsp; I looked back at my cat "Tuff" that was stretched out on the
back of the couch as he lifted his head and sniffed the air, I got up knowing
it wasn't just my imagination and that my cat could smell this rotten stench
as well.</B>
<BR><B>I searched my very small one bedroom apartment and in every spot
I went the smell was there. Within 10 seconds of getting up and searching
the smell left as quickly as it appeared. I walked back into my living
room and looked at my cat and as I was walking all of a sudden it was like
I was trying to walk thru molasses. There was nothing there but air, but
I felt something and it was thick and slow and went thru my whole body
and I was trying to force myself to go forward but I couldn't, then all
of a sudden it was like someone letting go of the back of my belt loop
and I fell forward. OK, so I freaked out and called my sister and told
her what had just happened, of course she believed me cause she has weird
stuff happen to her too, I have in the past also but nothing like this
and nothing like what IM about to tell you.</B>
<BR><B>Three days pass with nothing else happening until that 3rd day,
I get home from work and I go into my bedroom I sit down to check my email
and as IM sitting there the whole house instantly starts to stink like
someone just took a lid off a diaper pale and all its saturated diapers.
I jump up and think what the #^(#^@ is going on, I search the house it
is filled with this urine odor, then again as quickly as it came it disappeared.
Now IM starting to freak out again, so I go into the middle of my living
room and out loud say "LISTEN UP GHOST OR WHATEVER YOU ARE ...I DON'T MIND
YOU HANGING AROUND BUT QUIT STINKING UP THE PLACE I LIKE MY VANILLA CANDLES"</B>
<BR><B>A few days pass its finally Friday woohoo the work day is over and
IM heading home. I get home and as IM walking down the covered hall to
my apartment I hear my cat majorly meowing IM 3 apartments away. I think
that this is odd because he never is like this he's always asleep. I unlock
the door and open it and Tuff fly's out the door meow meow ...I say what's
wrong tuff and he wont stop meowing and he's focused on the hall closet
right at the front entrance. He is so persistent and freaked that I start
getting a little nervous thinking someone has broken into my place. So
I tell Tuff I will get him some food and I go into the kitchen grab the
biggest Butcher Knife I can find and search every nook and cranny ...I
cant find anything.</B>
<BR><B>After 45 minutes my cat finally calmed down and came inside.</B>
<BR><B>Saturday, Next morning....5:30 am Tuff wants out he's batting at&nbsp;
the plastic blinds that cover the sliding glass door, i lay there for a
few minutes listening to his persistent plea of LET ME OUT NOW...i get
up and let him out the slider door, i know he will want back in to eat
then want to go back out within a 10 minutes (his routine) so i lay on
my bed and wait for his scratch at the glass. 5 minutes goes by, scratch
scratch ... there he is, I get up let him in and lay back down for a few
more minutes, I can hear him crunching his food, he stops then meows and
i know he wants out again. I Get up and go to the slider door but he's
not there, I hear a meow and a scratch I turn around and he is waiting
at the front door ...I think this is different he never goes out that way
in the morning. So I go to the main door to let him out, as I open the
door I can see the beige carpet ... suddenly something catches my eye by
the bottom hinge of the door. It is about the size of a basketball as thin
as a pancake aI got on the phone and told my sister I think I just saw
an entity or ghost of some sort.</B>
<BR><B>2 weeks went by and nothing happened, I told everyone at work what
had happened and of course they looked at me as though I had lost my mind.</B>
<BR><B>I came home from work about 3 weeks later and started chit chatting
with an old guy that lived in the complex he was telling me about how he
used to live in the complex back in the 70's when it was first built and
how they had outrageous party's it was for singles only...ect. Then he
looks at me and said did you know that since 1975 until now there has been
12 people who have died here at these apartments? I just looked at him
as he kept talking, he said 11 of the people committed suicide and one
woman a dancer was murdered by a neighbor cause she refused to go out with
him. He beat her to death with a baseball bat then threw it up on the roof.</B>
<BR><B>I hadn't mentioned what had been happening in my apartment nor did
i.</B>
<BR><B>At first when this stuff was happening I thought that maybe it was
my cat Abbey that I had to have put to sleep at another apartment on the
premises a year earlier coming to visit, but with the new information I
had just gotten from the old man makes me wonder if it could have been
one of the ghost that died at the apartment building or maybe Shandra Levy?
Anyway I moved and whatever it is decided not to be left behind and has
followed me... I have a lot more true stories and witnesses that are roommates
that have also encountered this or these spirit ghost.</B>

or so and the class required 2 sleep overs at the church. The church was
the Neshaminy Warwick presbyterian Church in Warrington PA. I think its
the second oldest Presbyterian church in PA. So when we had these sleep
overs we would play games and the one game we were playing was called sardines.
The point of the game was to turn out all of the lights in the church and
one person goes out and hides. If you find that person you sit quietly
with them. Sometimes you could walk through a room full of people and never
know it. Well this one girl Jessica was "it" and ran off to hide. Me and
my buddy Darrell always teamed up to find who ever was hiding so we started
looking around going from room to room. So we are in a class room which
was across the hall from the nursery and we saw what looked like someone
with their back against the wall in a crouched position because you could
only see its leg. Darrell says to me, is that Jessica? I said I don't know
and it turned around and looked right at us. It's face had the regular
2 eyes, mouth nose and hair but there was nothing distinctive. Its hard
to explain but it was like looking at someone with a blurred shadowed view.
So I said to Darrell thats not Jessica, and he said "lets go get her anyway"
We got up and just as we did, the ghost got up and ran as well. It was
a girl (don't ask me how I know that) and she was little, probably 5 or
6 years old. I was right behind her and Darrell was right behind me as
we chased her into the nursery bathroom. She ran in and around the door
and we ran in right behind slamming the door right behind us. We yelled
out "we got you" and turned the lights on just to find out that we were
alone in the bathroom. We were so scared we started to tremble and cry.
Then we heard crying in the nursery, we came out and the girl Jessica that
we were looking for was underneath a crib crying, she had seen the whole
thing. It changed all of us and our views about ghost forever. I still
see Jessica time to time and we talk about it. When we ran up to the people
running the sleep over to tell them what had happened, the told us the
next time you see it to be nice to it. Thanks for the advice on the most
spiritual moment of my life.</B>

<BR><B>Hey there. I m an 18 year old girl from India. I m pretty interested
in</B>
<BR><B>exploring the unexplainable. The other world kinda fascinates me
especially</B>
<BR><B>after experiencing some of the paranormal stuff myself. I would
like to</B>
<BR><B>share some of them with you.</B>
<BR><B>That night (I must have been 17) I was sleeping next to my grandmom,
who was</B>
<BR><B>visiting us. I didn’t feel like sleeping in my room as I had this
uneasy</B>
<BR><B>feeling cuz my room had gotten unusually cooler despite the hot
Indian</B>
<BR><B>summer. After I fell asleep, I saw a 'foot' in my dreams, just above
my</B>
<BR><B>face. It kinda felt like whoever the person was, was trying to trample
me.</B>
<BR><B>Immediately afterwards, there was this terrifying experience as
though</B>
<BR><B>someone was desperately trying to get inside of me. I was wide-awake
but was</B>
<BR><B>completely paralyzed, unable to move or even talk. I could clearly
see my</B>
<BR><B>grandmom sleeping soundly right next to me but all my efforts to
wake her up</B>
<BR><B>were simply futile. It was as though I had been muffled and tied
up so i</B>
<BR><B>could make no movements. And then as suddenly as it came, the phase
died</B>
<BR><B>out. It left me sweating profusely. All I could do was pull the
sheets over</B>
<BR><B>me and cuddle up to granny. The next day, I didn’t even mention
it to</B>
<BR><B>anyone, as I didn’t want to be labeled as a freak. Then as we were
talking</B>
<BR><B>over a cup of tea, granny mentioned that the night before, she saw
me in her</B>
<BR><B>dreams lying on my bed, completely unaware of a girl, about 4-5
years old,</B>
<BR><B>standing right next to me, on my bed and pointing her 'foot' to
my face as</B>
<BR><B>she stared hard at me, expressionless. She thought it was weird
and laughed</B>
<BR><B>it off and no matter how much I tried I couldn’t even smile.</B>
<BR><B>There was another such ghastly stuff experienced by my aunt's friend
who was</B>
<BR><B>staying overnight at her in-laws house. She woke up in the middle
of the</B>
<BR><B>night to get a glass of water. After she was done, she lay in her
bed trying</B>
<BR><B>hard to fall asleep. Just then, she saw a man dressed in white and
smoking a</B>
<BR><B>cigarette, go past her room to the kitchen. Bewildered, she realized
that</B>
<BR><B>there were no smokers in that family. She went in to the kitchen
to</B>
<BR><B>investigate and there was no one there. But there was an unmistakable
hint</B>
<BR><B>of cigarette odor, so strong, that it seemed to fill the whole room.
She</B>
<BR><B>told her husband of what she had seen the previous day and to her
relief, he</B>
<BR><B>believed her. He said there had been such instances before. However
the</B>
<BR><B>spirit had never hurt anyone and having it there was more of a comforting</B>
<BR><B>rather than a scary experience</B>

<P><B>St marys church. Hougton on the Hill</B>

<P><B>By: froggie.g@virgin.net</B>

<P><B>This is the experience that my husband and I had whilst visiting
relations in Norfolk in 1995.</B>
<BR><B>My uncle told us of a nearby church which was undergoing some rebuilding
work due to disrepair and vandalism, he said that there had been some reports
of Satanism and such like there, being interested in this kind of thing,
we decided to go take a look.</B>
<BR><B>We could see that there had been a fire lit in the courtyard and
some of the tombstones had been defaced with pentagrams and so on, but
this was merely the tip of the iceberg.</B>
<BR><B>There was a spiral staircase, and though it was very badly damaged
we knew that we just had to go up it, my husband went up first, I waited
for him, and as he went up we shouted a conversation, it was after a little
while that I sensed something amiss, I knew that he was up there, yet felt
strangely and frighteningly alone, I asked him to come down which he did.</B>
<BR><B>Then I went up there, and I had not gone far when I could feel a
presence and it was pushing me back, as though it did not want me to go
on, I went as far as I could but as the pushing feeling grew more intense&nbsp;
and foreboding I decided to turn back.</B>
<BR><B>Afterwards my husband told me that he had felt exactly the same
thing, also at the top he had taken a few pictures of the view from the
roof (as most of the roof had gone) but oddly the pictures did not come
out when we got the film developed, even though they were in the middle
of a film, and all the other pictures came out fine.</B>
<BR><B>Before this happened I was cynical about ghosts, but now I am sure
that they exist.</B>

<BR><B>I believe i eventually dozzed off after awhile, but heard whispering
I opened</B>
<BR><B>my eyes and i had noticed that my mom and dad were sound asleep
, one on each</B>
<BR><B>side of me.I remember sitting up and as i was ready to lay back
down, i</B>
<BR><B>glanced at my blanket that was over me, (my very favorite blanket)
and I kid</B>
<BR><B>you not, there was a severed hand laying on my blanket,as it jolted
me i even</B>
<BR><B>noticed how , when i moved it slid a bit, again i began to scream,
my mom and</B>
<BR><B>dad again jumped up, they knew i was sure of what i had seen..my
dad searched</B>
<BR><B>the bed and the blanket, under the bed etc...but found nothing.</B>
<BR><B>I beleive we all got a total of 2 minutes sleep that night//but
once again</B>
<BR><B>the horror had only begun.</B>
<BR><B>finally it was daylight, my parents, my sister and myself were at
the dinning</B>
<BR><B>table getting ready to eat breakfast when out of the blue I said
to my sister</B>
<BR><B>who was sitting across from me, "a spider is crawling up you back)
though i</B>
<BR><B>could not see her back, my parents said "dont play around at the
table, you</B>
<BR><B>know better" I said once again, a spider is on her back! my dad
looked and</B>
<BR><B>behold a freagin spider was on her back.</B>
<BR><B>I remember my parents looking at one another like thinking "what
the heck was</B>
<BR><B>that about?".</B>
<BR><B>then after a few minutes my dad asked my mom what time it was cuz
he needed</B>
<BR><B>to leave for work..i blurted out a time and lord and behold it was
the exact</B>
<BR><B>time..mind you I was a small child I didnt know how to tell time,
not to</B>
<BR><B>mention the clock was in the other room behind me..again my parents
looked</B>
<BR><B>freaked out.</B>
<BR><B>well I went to the back yard to play with the 3 dogs that we had
at the</B>
<BR><B>time..and I had noticed that my aunt (whom lived right across the
ally from</B>
<BR><B>us) her dog was dragging something through our back yard, it look
awful, i</B>
<BR><B>went and told my parents that the dog was in the yard and hard something
with</B>
<BR><B>it. we all walked back out there, suddenly my dad became very upet
and yelled</B>
<BR><B>for me and my sister to get back in the house...I was very curious
on what</B>
<BR><B>was happening, alls i remember seeing was police cars, and a coroner
car in</B>
<BR><B>front of my house.</B>
<BR><B>well, from what I could get out of neighbors&nbsp; talking and hearing
my mom say</B>
<BR><B>"I will have a heart attack if im walking to my moms through the
ally and I</B>
<BR><B>see the head rolling" (my grandma lived right down the ally from
us as</B>
<BR><B>well)..and hearing that a foot was found by a neighbors motorcycle.
that some</B>
<BR><B>one was murdered and chopped to peices and I guess the head was
not found.</B>
<BR><B>Being a child at that time my parents thought best to tell me it
was a leg of</B>
<BR><B>a deer..but now being grown up, they tell me about the true story
of what it</B>
<BR><B>actually was.</B>
<BR><B>Now I dont know or even if i will ever know if the terrifing night
i had ,</B>
<BR><B>had anything to do with the murder, but hell, i dont think I want
to ever</B>
<BR><B>know, and for those of you who ask, if i had ever had any other
experince</B>
<BR><B>such as i did that night.. the answer is "no".</B>

<P><B>The Whistler and other hauntings</B>

<P><B>By:jpgr_4ever@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>I have a strange but true tale to tell. I was staying at a relatives
house for a week only this summer. It was a really nice little house, sparsely
decorated and pretty. The bedroom I stayed in happened to also be my relative's
bedroom. She had told me the previous week that it was haunted, and considering
that I was always a believer, I seriously hoped that "they" would be attracted
to me. She told me of many strange happenings in her room, of the cold
spot on the steep stairway that was supposed to be the spirit of a small
child who fell and broke his neck (One night she was coming downstairs
and a little boy was standing there staring at her.), and of the Whistler.
There was supposed to be a little dog who ran out of her closet and jumped
out the window. Recently, her cat had died.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;It was the cat that I sensed that first night, alone, getting
ready for bed. My neice was downstairs brushing her teeth and I decided
I was too tired to do anything but read. Suddenly, the hair stood up on
the back of my neck. SOMETHING was floating outside in the other part of
the attic. I was frozen with fright. I could see it as if it was transparent,
and only a medium sized ball or something just . . . floating. But it was
staring at me. I could not tear away from it. It moved along the high railing
and seemed to sit there, staring . . . staring . . . I was HORRIFIED. .
. . Absolutly frozen. My neice came upstairs, and the sensation disappeared.
I took a huge breath and I told her. She wasn't surprised, telling me matter
of factly that her dead cat often came up here to seek the living. Maybe
he wanted to see me. I don't really know. Whatever it was, it scared the
heck out of me.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;The Whistler was another spirit who came around. He was never
seen, just heard, and he was quite intriguing. The first night, when I
saw the cat, I heard nothing from him. My neice said that she heard him
around midnight. The day after, I said aloud to the room(or to the Whistler),
"Hey, why do I never hear you?" Man . . . That was a silly mistake. All
night, I heard nothing BUT the Whistler! There was a stone pathway running
from the back to the front of the house. It's rather old and ratty, but
I think that's what the Whistler followed, because you would hear him coming
up and down. You would never hear any footsteps or see anything. He whistled
about eleven times. In the morning, I woke up, and lo and behold he was
at it again, in broad daylight, whistling away! he sounded like he was
going up and down the street. The funny thing is, is that nobody living
could EVER make it to the end of the street in the time between the whistles.
. . That's why I think he was not living.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;The scariest is always saved for last. This is the most amazing
thing about the whole place. I was walking with my neices from a day of
shopping downtown. I have never seen a ghost, but this was the next best
thing. I happened to look up at the attic window facing us. I saw, to my
amazement, the curtains meticulously opening, and a hazy, misty bluish
grey figure staring down at me! I gasped and pointed at the window, but
my neices just looked puzzled. They never saw it. I was shaken.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Well, that was the grand finale, I guess. Ever since the misty
figure appeared in the window, the Whistler only whistled twice during
my duration of the week, and the cold spot eventually went away. I'm only
seventeen, but I am telling you the truth. I am convinced, thanks to a
bunch of spirits, that ghosts are for real. I believe in them more than
I did just because of that one strange week. i've alos thought about something
else; you see, right across the street is a hospital. I guess some spirits
who were earthbound had nowhere else to go, so they came to a spot where
they knew they would be noticed.</B>

<P><B>Strange Experience</B>

<P><B>By: gfull@ntlworld.com</B>
<BR><B>My name is John, I am 30 years old and live with my partner Debbie
and her son Carl who has just turned four. She works nights at our local
supermarket so I am alone with Carl until she usually returns home at about
4:00am. Last Wednesday night I went to bed at around 12:30am and read until
1:30 and then, felt, that I had dropped off to sleep. At 2:00am I awoke
with an unmistakable feeling of dread! I fully expected to see something
in the bedroom, but did not see anything. Because I felt strange I went
to check on Carl, I found him lying in bed just staring at me. I found
this to be odd as when he usually wakes he cries or asks for something.
I asked him if he was ok and he replied yes, I asked him if was going to
sleep and he replied yes. I went back to bed just a little unnerved. .About
an hour later I awoke with the same horrible feeling. On turning around
to face the door I found Carl to be stood right next to my bed....his eyes
really wide and unblinking(not at all normal for Carl or probably any child)!
I asked him what he was doing, he replied "where's my mummy" I said "she
is at work" he said "who is that in bed with you then?" My heart skipped
a beat, but I thought perhaps the quilt was doubled up and looked like
someone was there, so pulling back the covers I confirmed that no-one was
there "yes there is " he said and pointing his finger he asked again "who's
that in bed with you" By this time I had sort of lost it and was quite
relieved when he quite calmly said "I'm going back to bed now" But when
he went all I could hear was him talking to himself.At about 4:00am Debbie
returned and went to his room and I heard him say "I can't shut my eyes"
He went to sleep after a bit. The next day he fully remembered being in
my room and actually described the 'thing' in my bed as being "a man with
a bold head and wearing dark clothes" he also said he was "a bad man and
didn't want to see him again"</B>
<BR><B>I have to say that I do not easily get frightened and actually enjoy
reading scary stuff but the feeling I had that night has taken me aback
somewhat, I just cannot explain it. As to Carl he is ok, but I have to
rule out that he slept-walked for FOUR hours AND remembered everything,
add this to the really strong and tangible feeling of dread I experienced
I am sure you agree it was a very strange experience indeed.</B>
<BR><B>Nothing has happened since then, that may be because I now sleep
(or not) with the light on.</B>

<P><B>Hi I would just like to share a true story with you that happened
to me about a year ago. It is probably not as scary as alot of these stories
but I'm sure the people that have had experiences with the paranormal know
it is much scarier when you acually experiance it. Anyway I was at my nana
and papaws house laying in bed. I could not sleep so i was just layig there
when i heard the clock strike 3:00 a.m. I looked over an saw a white figure
moving around so i put a pillow over my head. Then i heard scratching on
it. About a week later i looked up and saw some purple dot fly away. To
this day i still think their house is haunted.</B>

<P><B>Strange House</B>

<P><B>By: bast78@msn.com</B>

<P><B>Growing up in the outskirts of Fryburg, PA, I always had a strange
yet soothing feeling in my home. It's an old farmhouse where much sadness
and tragedy has happened. I know a distant uncle had killed himself by
turning the gas on to the stove where there was no fire. Several people
have died there, one being my stepmother, and another relative went crazy
in the house.</B>
<BR><B>When I was just 13, a young girl and a very depressed one, things
began happening that I had never noticed before. Late at night I was contemplating
suicide when the door to my bedroom flew open and a lot of cool air followed.
I didn't feel frightened, but knew someone was there with me. I believe
it was the ghost of my distant uncle. Another time I opened the door to
my bedroom and saw in the hallway a large black bird. Being afraid I slammed
the door shut just before the bird hit my door. But to my surprise it didn't
hit, and I was confused because there was no way it could have not hit
it. After a few moments I opened the door and there was no bird to be found.</B>
<BR><B>I also hear strange noises, voices, things always malfunctioning
or otherwise not working, and that same strange sensation. It's like someone
follows me around even though I do not know who it is.</B>
<BR><B>Another strange thing that happened in the house is that the stove
was turned on, burners not lit. Dad had to check on all of us to see that
we were ok.</B>

<BR><B>Strange</B>

<P><B>By: chiggi2@lsu.edu</B>

<P><B>I grew up in a farm house (ca. 1920) that was an old renovated church
in</B>
<BR><B>the delta of southeastern Arkansas. The first deed to the land was
from</B>
<BR><B>1868 and was held by a Union soldier, also a Cherokee Indian. I
remember,</B>
<BR><B>on several occasions, that we heard strange noises and other oddities
such</B>
<BR><B>as stereos turning on by themselves. At one point we had an intercom
system</B>
<BR><B>placed in the house that fed to the shop. I would hang out in the
shop with</B>
<BR><B>the intercom on in case someone knocked on the door.</B>
<BR><B>More times than once did I go to the house to confront either a
family</B>
<BR><B>member or a friend only to find no one there. My friends and I would
sneak</B>
<BR><B>around the house to try to catch whoever was making the noises in
the</B>
<BR><B>house, but never saw a soul. The noises consisted of dishes clanging</B>
<BR><B>together, keys shuffling around, footsteps, etc. I just assumed
there were</B>
<BR><B>restless spirits in the old house, but I never felt an evil presence.</B>
<BR><B>I was also witness to a column of mist or fog one night after a
large storm</B>
<BR><B>rolled through the area. About a mile from the house, a friend and
I were</B>
<BR><B>driving around looking at the devastation left by the violent storm,
and we</B>
<BR><B>drove through the column on fog (it appeared to be a foot in diameter

<BR><B>I lived in Sumter from June of 2000 until May of 2001.&nbsp; Where
I lived was on Alice Drive in Le Chalet Apartments, which happens to be
next to Thomas Drive and the vacant lot.</B>
<BR><B>After my husband and I moved in, we looked in our guest room one
day and found writing on the wall in pencil, at a child sized eye level.&nbsp;
The writing was nothing that was clear.&nbsp; It was just letters and was
clearly a child's writing.&nbsp; We also found it on another wall in this
room, but it was only a couple of scratches with pencil.&nbsp; When we
had moved in, we inspected the place and never had seen this.</B>
<BR><B>I have had communications of sorts with loved ones that have passed
in my dreams, so if we had a ghost, it was not a big deal to me, especially
if it was a child.</B>

I can actually remember my face touching the carpet and the smell of the
carpet as I layed there.&nbsp; I then remember looking up to our bed and
shoving my husband over to get back into bed.&nbsp; I then remember that
a figure of a man in black, or possibly a black man was at the edge of
my bed and I did not hear a voice, but I could see that he was agitated
and was yelling something to me.&nbsp; I then woke up and started screaming,
which immediately woke up my husband.</B>
<BR><B>I then looked out of the door and saw a figure coming up our stairs
and began to scream, so my husband turned on the lights and went to find
what he thought was an intruder.&nbsp; Our house was tightly shut and nobody
was in the house.</B>
<BR><B>This experience was so real to me and had me so freaked out that
I called my father crying and my other family members thinking I was going
crazy.&nbsp; My husband also claims that I was sleeping like a rock that
night, only until I began to scream, and that I had never moved out of
bed or shoved him over.</B>
<BR><B>While in the apartment I had also had a number of clothing items
taken from me when my husband used the complex's laundry room, and we got
a number of phone calls with someone breathing then hanging up.&nbsp; I
even had a call one night where the caller asked for me specifically, then
hung up.&nbsp; My husband also recalls a few occasions where at night he'd
wake up and see a dark figure in our bedroom, but didn't know exactly what
it was.</B>
<BR><B>Again, after seeing the story about the Thomas Drive Vacant Lot,
I am sufficiently freaked out!&nbsp; Our apartment was just a stone's throw
from Thomas Drive, in fact next to Thomas Drive....Oh We Oh!</B>

<BR><B>The Baby Monitor</B>

<P><B>By: Rina@civildemand.net</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>It was a sunday evening, 1999. I had just had my baby boy a couple
months earlier and lived with my husband and my older, 26 yr old sister.
As my son laid asleep, before it began to get dark, I was picking up in
my room as I heard a mumbling coming from the monitor that at the moment
was barely up in volume. So I went to raise it and heard as though two
children were speaking and giggling with each other. I paused for a moment
as though I was hearing things then thought maybe it's my son and he's
awake or something. So I entered his room and sure enough he was sound
asleep and the giggling ceased. I returned a little creeped out to my room
and stepped slowly towards the monitor. Once again I heard the giggling
faintly coming from the monitor. It sounded more like a little girl than
a little boy. I ran to my sisters room as she confirmed the children's
voices I heard. And once again we peeked in my son's room to find him sound
asleep. I walked in slowly thinking and rebuking the spirits in my mind
and quitely out loud. I grabbed my boy and took him to sleep in my room,
quickly having my sister shut the door. When my husband arrived home, of
course, he thought I overreacted to some birds chirping or something. So
as night began we fell asleep, still leaving my son in our room.</B>
<BR><B>About 2 am I woke up to find my older, very bold, sister laying
on my bedroom floor. I asked her in a whisper, "what is the matter?". She
shushed me asking me, "Can you hear that?" Faint footsteps were heard walking
back and forth across the outside of my bedroom door. She stayed up very
late every night and said she went to look for her remote control and realized
she had left it in my sons room from our little venture earlier. So she
went to get it and went back to her room. I guess about 10 minutes after
that she started hearing the floors crack as you would if someone was walking
around in her room. It was back and forth all around her room. She stood
on her bed as her blinds started moving back and forth from one side to
the other as though someones fingers were being ran through them. She stayed
bravely for 20 minutes or so before she ran to my bedroom and slammed the
door.</B>
<BR><B>We all slept in my room from then on until I was able to get some
people from my church to come pray over my home. They stated that spirits
travel from one place to another by following people and that when my sister
went to get her remote control they must have followed her. They felt no
presence in my sons room but a strong presence in my sisters. They said
they felt the spirit of death. That was the only thing that occurred to
us and we sold the property shortly after.</B>

<P><B>THE CAT ???????????</B>

<P><B>By: Imnbenson@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>Here is just one of my stories, however I do indeed have a life
time of them. My name is Terry and i am 36 years old....About 22 years
ago, my sister and I, along with my mother and step father, lived in government
housing, it was an apartment, hey that's not the spooky part come on !!!!!!!
Anyway, i suppose i was about 13 , i had seen on several occasions, a small
cat like figure mostly out of the corner of my eye, but sometimes a full
view of it, now nothing sinister ever really occurred and it n ever hurt
me in any way although oh many occasions, managed to cause me to hurt myself,
well, one day we were sitting at the table eating and all of a sudden there
he was he went flying under the kitchen table me, my Mom, my step dad,
all three at the same time, quickly scooted our chairs backwards, this
was the first time that i had found out that they to had be seeing the
figure that we have kind h the old lady and man etc. sent me running out
of my house and up to the church where the door was always open, which
i found it to be locked, so no divine intervention there for me, However,
i feel the need to say that the black cat is still here, and in fact i
saw him just two days ago and i had to email my sister who saw him hear
at my house last, about 6 months ago, and it ran toward our fire place,
and it scared her so bad it put tears in her eyes, all she could say at
first was my name over and over about 3 times, she didn't have to tell
me, i knew, i didn't see him that time, but i knew it by the look on her
face, i just said, did you see him Shannon? the black cat is called the
black cat simply because its black and low to the ground and walks on all
fours, if it is indeed a cat, maybe i will never know, maybe you could
tell me, or come by and see for yourself, cant promise he will come out
though, but he just very well may, you are welcome to email me for the
other stories,</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello.&nbsp; I just recently moved
from an apartment building on the east</B>
<BR><B>side of Kansas City.&nbsp; This apartment building was built in
1910.&nbsp; This</B>
<BR><B>apartment was huge..1800 square feet and full of history, being
that the area</B>
<BR><B>that it was in was the "hot spot" in Kansas City in the 20's and
30's.&nbsp; I had</B>
<BR><B>a few things happen...but it was the scent that I remember and will
remember</B>
<BR><B>the most.&nbsp; I would come home or walk through the apartment...and
smell this</B>
<BR><B>intense floral scent.&nbsp; It was usually in my bedroom (although
the scent</B>
<BR><B>greeted me a few times at the front door).&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember
the last time that I</B>
<BR><B>noticed the scent.&nbsp; I was in my bedroom, reading on my right
side and noticed</B>
<BR><B>this scent that seemed to come right at me, like a breath that was
blowing</B>
<BR><B>straight at me. (I could actually feel the air blowing at my face).&nbsp;
(Please</B>
<BR><B>note that all scents or anything that could have a scent was removed
from</B>
<BR><B>that bedroom months before.) Not soon after that though, I moved
out, due to</B>
<BR><B>the type of area.&nbsp; I have had no other instances at my new
apartment.&nbsp; Though</B>
<BR><B>I kind of miss the scent.&nbsp; On another note.&nbsp; The basement
in that apartment</B>
<BR><B>was huge.&nbsp; I remember going down into it and having this extremely
strong</B>
<BR><B>feeling of not wanting to walk past the gas meters.&nbsp; It was
not a good</B>
<BR><B>feeling past that point.&nbsp; It was a dark, forbiding, itchy feeling.&nbsp;
I had</B>
<BR><B>later learned that a "handy" man had lived down there for years

<BR><B>The Coal Mine</B>

<P><B>By: stevencharles@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; This happened when I was about six years old in Elyria, Ohio.
A man was buried underneath our porch who died in the Coal mines underneath
our house. At night we would hear coal buckets screeching and moaning.
My cousins and I were in a box house that my uncle made us in the cellar
of the house when we witnessed a sighting of that man. We were so scared
that we stayed in the far corner of the box. We all screamed and my older
cousin, Jeremy, wet his pants. When we moved out the people that moved
in contacted the ghost and submitted their story in the newspaper and then
moved out. It is now history in the Elyria Newspaper. That house is still
vacant.</B>

<P><B>The Evil Spirit</B>

<P><B>By: kaharris@lis.net.au</B>

<P><B>This is a true story that happened to me when I was 27. I rarely
speak of this but when I do, noone really believes me so, here I go, and
draw your own conclusion. I'm an experienced bushman, know most of the
backtracks where tourist don't bother going, I know most of the trees that's
grown around there and I know where there's Aboriginal Burial Grounds are
and I don't go anywhere near them. This is why.</B>
<BR><B>I heard about this great walk that only a few ppl knew of. Me and
two mates decided to do this four day walk through the virgin forest. So
we pored over the map we managed to get the hold of and off we went. The
first day was warm but it was nice down in the forest but on the 2nd day
rain came. We found a small cave where we decided to set up camp. I went
off in search of fresh water for our billy-as in tea-The bush was thick.
I had a hard time pushing through the thicket when I stumbled out upon
a small creek. I filled the billy and looked around the bush. First I thought
it was a tree stump but, when I looked harder, I saw it was tall black
man with tribal scars across his chest and wearing only a lion cloth. In
his right hand he held a spear and in the other a Boomerang. I stumbled
back into the bush, shit scared. I told the others but they said I mistaken
a tree stump for a blackfella.</B>
<BR><B>That night each of us had a dream. In mine I was in the water, waist
high, searching for something, what I haven't a clue, when I looked up
I saw a boat with a hurricane lamp attached to a pole, with the blackfella
pushing it with a stick. His eyes were dark as the pits of hell and he
spoke to me in his tongue. I understood him. He literally told to pee off
from his terriory or we'll live to regret it. The next morning, we all
packed up without a word and left that area. I told an Aboriginal mate
about what I just told you and he went, excuse the pun, pale. He searched
my eyes and said: That, Buddah, was the Nimbijiman-one of the Gatekeepers
of the Rocks. That was, Buddah, the Evil Spirit. You lucky to be alive.
You very lucky he didn't make you sick.</B>
<BR><B>I never went back to that part of the forest and never will. There's
parts of that forest I refuse to go anywhere near. When in Rome, do what
the Romans do. Believe the locals, they may bulls**t you but most times
they're bloody correct. Thanks for reading, sorry it was so long.</B>

<P><B>Mothers Spirit</B>

<P><B>By:rhoskins77@msn.com</B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Well it was 4 days before my mothers death, my sister-in-law and
than almost husband came and woke me up and told me their was bad news.
They had said that my mother was in the hospital.&nbsp; So I got up and
went to the hospital and talked to the doctors and found out that she wasnt
going to make it.&nbsp; She was dying from sciosis of the liver.&nbsp;
So I sat there for 3 to 4 days. Me and my brothers had to make a decision
of what we were going to do. I already knew she wanted to go, she was in
comitose all her organs were gone basically. This was a very hard decision
to make.&nbsp; The worst thing about it was that I was planning on getting
married in 3 weeks. It was Aug 13, around 10:30ish, I sat with her,her
last hours. As time went on her heart rate and blood pressure went down.
Than around 6:30 in the morning I was so tired I decided to take a small
nap, I had told her that dont worry I'm not leaving you I'm just taking
a small nap. I closed my eyes and sat there for 10 minutes. I just couldnt
sleep. When I opened my eyes I have seen a shadow walk by me in the corner
of my eyes. I swear I thought it was her leaving her body.&nbsp; Than a
half hour later, she took a big breath and I ran and told the nurse. The
nurse told me to take a small break. So I did that. I wasnt gone that long,
the nurse ran in and told me and my soon to be husband that it was happening.
I ran and soon as I got there ,she was gone. It seemed like she knew I
was there so she kind of sent me out the room so I wouldnt see her last
minutes. She knew it would be to hard for me to see.</B>
<BR><B>Well it was over and soon as I got home I started to cry hard. Russ
my soon to be husband told me to come outside and see something. The pretty
flowers that I had planted were dead the day before, now they are full
bloomed. But all the other neighbors flowers were still dead. I got to
my brothers house the same thing happened his flowers were full bloomed.
She always had a thing for flowers. Strange huh?</B>
<BR><B>Well it was the day before my bridal shower, I went to my hair dresser
to get my hair done. My regular hair dresser had told me that she was 60
years of age, part polish and hungarian, loved vodka a lot, dated a finnish
guy and was an alcoholic,loved stuffed cabbage,and had the exact same personality
as my mom, blunt and very wild and outgoing. Well after my hair was done
she handed me her card. It said her real name and also a name below it.
I asked her whats this word"Meme"? She had told me it was her nick name.
She said she has had it for years.&nbsp; I said thats wierd remember when
I told you all those things about my mom? She was 61 years old when she
died. She was part polish and hungarian. Her favorite liquor was vodka.
Married to my dad, a finnish person that is and alcoholic. Stuffed cabbage
was her fav. food. Same exact personality, I swear Im not lying, blunt
and wild.&nbsp; My mothers nick name since she was little was Mimi. Wierd
huh?</B>
<BR><B>I got home and told everyone.&nbsp; Well that night I was talking
to her, the next morning I woke up a hand print was on my black marble
bedroom set. It didnt fit my hand nor my soon to be husband. It still had
the feature, for example when you touch glass and your handprint is on
the mirror but than it disappears. You do know what I mean? I dont know
how to explain it. What was really wierd about it, I cleaned the house
the night before so it would look good for the bridal shower, so I wiped
the dresser with windex the night before. I dont know where it came from.</B>
<BR><B>One night I was sleeping in the room. I woke to the sound of my
door shutting. I got up. Russ, my now husband was sleeping on the couch,
the cat was in my bed sleeping soundly and the dog was in the utility room
sleeping. Nobody could of shut it. I think it was her checking on me.</B>
<BR><B>Another time, from time to time I get in my depressing moods, I
start thinking about her. For example, it was her birthday. I was upset.
It was wierd because earlier in the day I ate stuffed cabbage at my mother
in laws house(my moms fav. food) got home, turned on the tv and her fav.
movie was on. Gone with the wind was on tv. I cried. Than another movie
came on it was On Golden Pond with Henry Fonda. My mom took me to see that
movie four times when I was little cause I loved that movie.</B>
<BR><B>It was Valentines Day and my husband bought me flowers.&nbsp; I
had those flowers for about a wk. Well I went from room to room to throw
the flowers out. First the kitchen, I had flowers in the kitchen, than
in the living room, and than finally in the bedroom. I had a couple of
roses next to my mothers pict. she was 13 in the pict.all the flowers in
every room was completely dead, except the two roses next to my mothers
pict. they were full bloomed. I cried. Later on that night, I was watching
tv again a movie came on, it was The Black Stallion. That was a movie I
havent seen in yrs. Again my mom took me to see that movie.</B>
<BR><B>Well thiers been so many more experiences but I cant type them all.
But definitly do know that my mothers watches over me all times.&nbsp;
Thiers pictures from my wedding with alot of orbs, but I dont have any
way of sending you them. I was joking one day with my sister-in-law I had
said, "Paula, I bet your family that had passed on and mine were at the
wedding on each side of the family, I guarantee they were sitting there
with thier imaginary beers partying with us. Especially my mom. She loved
to have a good time.</B>
<BR><B>Thiers one thing I have to say, when you loose a parent, sibling,friend,
or anyone you loved or cared for, its a very hard thing to overcome, youll
never get over it. The grief always stays with you. I miss my mom and I
always will miss her.</B>

<P><B>The Ghost in the Mountains</B>

<P><B>By: kaharris@lis.net.au</B>

<P><B>Hi, this a true story which happened to me when I was travelling
thru Ireland back in 1994. Originally I was born in Ireland but brought
up in Australia. Anyway, I was cycling through Connemara-West Coast-and
was staying in a YHA. It was my 2nd day that I decided to climb the mountains
behind the YHA- Twelve Bens they're called. So I made lunch, had my trusty
Pentax MZ50 Camera and off I went. I am used to walking in the bush by
myself so I took off for these mountains. It was a clear but cold day.
No clouds whatsoever. And I was by myself as there was no other hikers
around. I came across, every now and then, shells of old cottages that
were there during the Potato famine of the 1860's. I took some snaps and
wandered on. It was around 1ish in the afternoon when I came across the
perfect spot for lunch. It looked over the valley and the sea. I was eating
away when I heard, or thought I heard, someone calling my name. Now, I'm
14 miles from the YHA, and two, noone knows me there. I turned around and
saw a young woman wearing a dark blue jacket and black pants. She was waving
at me (or someone else) so I waved back. I dropped my knife and when I
turned back to where the young woman was, she was gone. In 1.2 seconds
the woman vanished. There was no where for her to run as it was all flat
and rocky and I would've seen her run anyway. I felt confused and went
back to the YHA. I didn't tell anyone that night but the next day I did
tell someone, the owner. He freaked out and poured me a whiskey. Then he
told me that the young woman I saw was a ghost of a young woman who disappeared
up there 3 years and her body was never found. Thats no lie. I've others
to tell like the experince with the Fairies (no, not poofters) one day
I'll tell that one. Thanks.</B>

<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>This happened this year around march 2002. I was in Viet Nam on a
tour. We were visiting Da Lat and the scenery was beautiful but it was
also very chilly there. The tour guide stopped in this really old and small
hotel so we can have a little rest. It was me, my mom, dad, and grandma.
There was only 2 beds in the room so i had to sleep with my grandma while
my mom and dad slept in another bed. Then, I took a shower in the bathroom,
the bathroom was small and had a big window. I was showering and i looked
out the window and saw a figure, it was very dark and i can see right through
it. I rubbed my eyes and looked again. And still, i saw it. I was so scared
i hurridly dressed and went to sleep. I didnt tell anyone this because
they might have thought i was crazy. So, i went to bed with my grandma.
Then, heard noises. It was loud and scary. The door was opening and shutting
by itself. My dad knew and heard it too so he went and checked the door.
He put a table next to the door to stop it from opening. The next morning,
the table disappeared.</B>

<P><B>The Lady in Pink</B>

<P><B>By: jssjr79@msn.com</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>On Christmas break about eight years ago, my family and I decided
to take a ski trip to Wisconsin.&nbsp; My brother, Louie, who was eleven
at the time and a regular daredevil, was on the black diamond hills with
moguls.&nbsp; For those of you who don't know, these are very dangerous
and are only supposed to be used by excellent skiers--which my brother
was not.&nbsp; Toward the end of the evening, my cousins and I went to
look for my brother as we were about to head back to our hotel room.&nbsp;
After searching for him for about an hour, I got fed up with looking and
just decided we should wait for him at the bottom of one of the hills.&nbsp;
After only five minutes, we saw him coming down the hill alone in his little
camouflage ski outfit.&nbsp; When he got to about twenty feet away from
me, he turned around, waved, and said, "Bye.&nbsp; Thank you."</B>
<BR><B>As I stated before, Louie came down the hill alone so I asked to
whom he said this.&nbsp; His reply, "The lady in pink."&nbsp; My brother
looked awful and, more concerned with where he was all this time rather
than who he was talking to, I asked him where he was all this time.&nbsp;
He said that he had gone way off the ski trail and was going at top speed
through the forest when he crashed into a tree.&nbsp; He passed out and
had awoken to a woman in a pink ski outfit asking him if he was ok.&nbsp;
She helped him up and out of the forest.&nbsp; She then escorted him down
the hill to where we were all waiting.&nbsp; Again, neither I nor my two
cousins saw ANYONE with him.</B>
<BR><B>As we walked, I could tell my brother was really out of it.&nbsp;
He could not remember where we were or even what day it was.&nbsp; He did
not believe me that we were on Christmas break or even the girl's name
who he had a crush on.&nbsp; I knew there was something wrong right then
and there.&nbsp; It ended up that Louie had a concussion that required
hospitalization immediately.&nbsp; He ended up being fine after proper
care and that was when I began questioning him about "The Lady in Pink".</B>
<BR><B>He was adamant in saying she was there because there was ABSOLUTELY
NO WAY he could've made it out of the forest without someone guiding him.&nbsp;
Also, because he had no recollection of where he was, without her help,
he would not have even known where to go.&nbsp; All he remembers is her
waking him up, taking care of him, and guiding him the WHOLE way down a
black mountain ski slope saying she'll help him find his family.&nbsp;
Pretty impossible without someone's aid--especially with a concussion.</B>
<BR><B>While I know for a fact no one REAL had guided my brother down the
hill (because myself and two other people had seen NOTHING), I still believe
it was something.&nbsp; Whether it was the ghost of a woman who died on
the ski slope or Louie's guardian angel, I do not know.&nbsp; But what
makes my brother and I happy is that whoever this woman was, she saved
his life.&nbsp; With him being passed out way off the ski trail and in
those cold temperatures, no one would have found him in time.&nbsp; Whoever
she is, thank you.</B>
<BR><B>This wasn't the last incident my brother has had with "ghosts".&nbsp;
Our grandfather was always a prankster and my brother was definitely his
favorite grandchild.&nbsp; Not long after my grandfather passed away in
March of 2001, my brother had pranks being pulled on him for about two
weeks after his death.&nbsp; These pranks occurred when no one was around
except my grandfather.&nbsp; For example, my brother would wake up in the
middle of the night and a basket of flowers that were previously on the
kitchen table were now in the middle of the hallway right in his path.&nbsp;
Other times, doors and closets would open right in front of my brother
with no breezes to blow them open or anyone to push them.&nbsp; Louie was
a little freaked out by the incidences but he truly feels it's our grandpa
letting him know he's still around and thinking about him.&nbsp; There
are a couple of other things that have happened to Louie but he is going
to have to refresh my memory.&nbsp; I'll send more stories when I get them.</B>

<BR><B>The Little Boy I Lost Now Found</B>

<P><B>By: Slsawyer322@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>One time about 10 years ago, I decided to meet with a psychic.&nbsp;
She told me a lot of things about myself and my life that truly amazed
me, yet I knew to be true.&nbsp; One thing she said was that I had two
children, a boy and a girl.&nbsp; Now I really only have one child--a girl.&nbsp;
But something I had never told anyone was that when I was about 18 and
married (briefly), was that I had a miscarriage.&nbsp; Since that time,
I have always secretly thought about the child and how old "he" would be
and what he would look like if he had been born.&nbsp; Somehow I knew it
was a boy.&nbsp; I have other miscarriages, but that was one that haunted
me until the day of the psychic reading.&nbsp; I confessed this all to
her.&nbsp; She said that he was my guardian spirit and was wahair color
quickly.&nbsp; I ran back into the bathroom and was shocked by what I saw:&nbsp;
there on the mirror and wall, just missing the fabric curtain and skirt,
was my left over hair color squirted all over, back and forth.&nbsp; I
realized after awhile that he was confirming his presence and showing me
what I had missed in mischievous little boys who play in the toilet and
write on the wall.</B>

<P><B>THE MAN BY MY BED</B>

<P><B>By: Staceyinfo@aol.com</B>

<P><B>Thank you for letting me share my story as I have enjoyed reading
everyone else's. Actually, I wouldn't believe in ghosts and still really
don't - except it happend to me!</B>
<BR><B>When I was about 9 we moved to Berkeley, CA after my older sister
Claudia died of cancer (we had been living in Lancaster,&nbsp; CA).</B>
<BR><B>We moved to a new tract house which sat next to a creek and in front
of an older home. I am assuming that the people who owned the old house
built the house we were living in.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, I don't know how long we had been living in our new home
but I do remember that I was asleep in my bedroom and that I suddenly woke
up. An old man was standing next to my bed looking at me. Folks, all I
can tell you some decades later (I am 43 years old now) is that this man
was SOLID FLESH AND BLOOD. He was as solid and real as solid and real can
get.</B>
<BR><B>He didn't seem evil or menacing. I don't remember what he was wearing
either. I just remember looking at a real live man standing next to my
bad and deciding that screaming my head off in terror was the thing to
do at that moment. So I screamed and screamed and screamed. My dad ran
into the room and ran to me. He leaned over to hug me. MY FATHER LEANED
RIGHT THROUGH THE MAN. At that point, I was solidly and really in the biggest
state of terror I have ever experienced (may I also say that I was for
years in law enforcement and have been in alot of danger). Nothing compares
to the feeling of terror that I experienced seeing my father lean through
this man.</B>
<BR><B>At that point I had thought this man was real. All I can say is
that I was awake for a few minutes during this entire experience and remember
it so vividly all these years later, that when my parents maintain I was
dreaming, to this day I know that I wasn't. Anyway, I instinctively told
my father to turn on the bedroom light. He ran across the room to turn
on the light (and the man was STILL there). He turned on the light and
then the man disappeared.</B>
<BR><B>At this point in my life I am still completely fascinated with the
experience. I am sorry to say that I think I would read all of these other
stories and think the people were lying if it hadn't have happened to me.
If anyone would like to write me for more details or to share experiences,
you are more than welcome. Thank you.</B>

<P><B>The Man, the Women and the Child</B>

<P><B>By: flashdancer1983@msn.com</B>

<P><B>I really don't know how to start telling you about this haunting,
but here goes nothing:</B>

<P><B>It was the first time that I stayed the night at my best friends
Chrissy's former house. It was a very nice house, the outside was built
like a log cabin, it had two nice living rooms, and it was a three bedroom,
it also had two bathrooms. It was really nice. When I first walked in,
I felt a really bad cold spot in the kitchen. I knew something was there.
I didn't want to scare Chrissy so I didn't mention it. I followed her to
her bedroom. We had to walk down this really long hallway. As I passed
her brother's room I felt coldness so bad it gave me chills. But, I continued
on. We sat in her room and chatted. Her mom came in asked if we wanted
to go see a movie. We agreed and started getting ready. Now, this is where
I tell you of my first encounter with one of the ghost in the house. We
were in the bathroom by the kitchen putting on makeup when Chrissy asked
me to go get a washcloth from the hall closet where the second bathroom
is. As I turned to go toward the hallway I saw a figure sitting on the
couch. It was an old man he was dressed up in clothing looked like something
from the 1820's. He looked angry. I leaned back and told Chrissy that there
was a man sitting on the couch. She looked at me and all she said was "yeah."
I looked back out at the living room and he was still sitting there. I
told her that he is still there and it is not Joey (her brother) or Ira
(her father). She just said "yeah," and continued putting on her makeup.
I looked back out and he was gone. So I braved up and walked down the hallway
and grabbed the cloth and came back. We went to the movies and had a great
time. We came back and laid down in her room that she shared with her sister
Toby. I was laying on the top bunk and Chrissy was laying on the bottom
bunk. We were just talking girl talk when all of a sudden the room got
very cold. I asked Chrissy if she felt that and she said "yeah, I do."
Then what sounded like glass falling and breaking on the floor filled the
room. It was so loud that it woke Toby up and let's face it Toby could
sleep through a tornado. Toby flicked on the lights and looked on the floor.
There was absolutley nothing there. We looked at each other like "what
the heck was that?" Toby then shut off the lights and went back to sleep.
That is when Chrissy told me about her house bieng haunted and all about
the man, the women, and the child. Now, I've seen the man so that left
three other ghost I will have to meet. Little did I know, I would meet
one of the women the next afternoon. Me and Chrissy was in the kitchen
messing around while everyone else was out doing their thing. Chrissy asked
me to go get a towel from the closet because we spilled water on the floor.
I started walking back toward the closet in the back hallway. I just past
Joey's room but as I did, I spotted something in there on the floor. i
slowly back up and looked in there was a woman sitting there crying her
eyes out. I panicked and ran back to the kitchen to tell Chrissy as I reached
the kitchen and said Chrissy's name she turned to me and said, "she's always
in there crying." I looked at her like she was crazy. I asked her what
is going on in this house. She goes "don't worry. The women and the child
are nice. The man is the one you need to watch out for. Like I told you
last night." I left later on that afternoon and went home. It was a couple
of months before I went back over there and stayed the night. But when
I did it was the most terrifying night of my life. Because I actually touched
the man's face and saw the last two ghost. As I pulled up to the house
that evening I looked at the kitchen window because I parked right in front
of it. When I looked up I saw what looked like an Indian woman staring
at me from the kitchen window. We locked eyes for about 10 seconds and
she vanished. I ran inside to tell Chrissy. She met me at the door and
I told her what I saw. She just smiled. Her family ordered pizza that night
and when the pizza arrived Chrissy and I went to the back door to pay for
it. I knew the pizza guy because I went to school with him. As he left
I looked out at the woods by her house and saw the little boy and the Indian
woman standing out there looking at us. I looked at Chrissy and I could
tell that she was looking at the same thing. We just turned around and
walked inside. We had a great time that night and around 1:00 in the morning
Chrissy and I went to bed. I jumped onto the top bunk and Chrissy stood
on hers and started talking to me. I felt something there standing right
next to her I touched her face five times and asked her five times "Chrissy
is that you?" She answered back to me five times "Yes, it's me." Then all
of a sudden I felt anger and sadness all at the same time and I just started
crying my eyes out. I grabbed a hold of Chrissy and told her not to leave
me. She grabbed on to me and held on for about 5 seconds and let go and
told me to put the covers over my head and don't pull them back until she
said so. So I did. She bent down and turned on the lights and when she
did I felt calm. I asked her how many times did I touch her face. she told
me three. I was shocked. I argued with her saying that I touched her face
five times when she is saying I didn't. She finally grabbed my hands and
told me that she wasn't lying. I believed her. So, what was that that my
hand touched? I'll let you figure that one out.</B>

<P><B>I have some stories to tell you friends non of these stories i have
experienced but was told to me by family members here's one my aunt and
(uncle who unfortunately passed away in 9/11/02)live in a house that's
about close to if not hundred years old.This house was a bar/restaurant
in the 1920's and had a bar fight in the basement around that time and
the person who lost had died in that house.One time my mom when she was
a little girl was playing hide &amp; go seek and she hide down stairs under
a pool table and seen a pair of boots come down the stairs and run around
the pool table and then start running into different rooms.My mom stood
up and looked at it and it had no body just a pair of boots running and
then the boots ran around the corner and disappeared later that night the
door down stairs slammed. my uncle could never find the pair of boots again.Another
is taking place up stairs of the house where my aunt and uncles son slept
he had a set of cars that he kept in a certain order but every night something
went upstairs and switched the cars around he would always get up in the
morning and have to switch them back.One time my aunt put a tape recorder
up by the cars and taped the noises that night all you heard was the door
open, faint talking and&nbsp; cars moving.The last one my take place in
the living room/stairs/upstairs bedroom.one time my aunt had a helium balloon
and let it sit on the ceiling but when it made it way to the stairs it
hit the bottom stair went up and hit the ceiling then hit the next stair
and&nbsp; ceiling.it just did that to all the stairs and then when it got
to the top it went to a closed bedroom some how got it open then went to
the corner of the bedroom and popped.I'm not sure if these stories are
true but usually families don't lie about these kind of things thanks for
taking time out of you life to read my ghost story.</B>

<BR><B>The People and the Man</B>

<P><B>By: bigdaddyburrell@charter.net</B>

<P><B>Hello. my name is Jessica and I should preface by saying that I am
a believer in ghosts and spirits. Though I believe, my husband does not.
We have a three year old daughter with whom I've never told about my beliefs.
I guess I never wanted to scare her. My story begins when my daughter was
two. We lived in a mobile home a few miles from a very small town in Mississippi
where nothing ever happens or if it does the locals never talk about it.
We bought our home from my husband's niece and nephew and nothing of note
happened for the first few months. One day we all got together at a family
gathering when his niece asked how we liked the house and if we'd noticed
anything odd. We said no and we asked why she would ask that. She told
us that when she lived in the house she would hear footsteps in the hallway
late at night. I was mildly concerned but didn't give it much thought.
A few weeks later my husband noticed a bright light outside our bedroom
window. As he got up to investgate he heard a LOUD banging on our front
door. He ran to the door and looked out but no one was there. Thinking
nothing but that it was a dog jumping against the door, he went back to
bed.( I slept through all of this.) A minute later he heard the banging
again. He looked again and saw nothing. All the while the light was outside
the window but he couldn't tell where it was coming from. (We had no neighbors
anywhere nearby and it wasn't a car.) He decided to return to bed and try
to sleep. That's when the hum started. It sounded to him like a large truck
passing the house but it never got closer or farther away. Eventually it
stopped and he went to sleep. The next encounter happened to my two year
old daughter. It was late and&nbsp; she was still awake waiting for her
daddy to get home. The back of our couch faced the kitchen and she was
standing up on the couch looking into the kitchen when she turned to me
with a scared look on her face and said there were "people" by the fridge.
I could feel the hair on the back of my neck stand up as I went into the
kitchen. She was right behind me then she abruptly stopped and started
crying. She would not take another step in there with me. She ran out and
refused to go into the kitchen for the rest of the night. After that she
saw the "people" regularly. When we would return home after dark she would
point to the kitchen window and tell me the "people" were looking. A few&nbsp;
months later my daughter was ill with a stomach virus and took to getting
in bed with me if she woke up feeling sick.(My husband was away with the
Army.) Well, about one or so in the morning she came to my room but before
she got in the bed she stopped in the door and looked in the direction
of the T.V.,(that was off) and started whispering. The hushed conversatiion
lasted a minute or so then she turned to me and pointed to where she was
speaking and said "Mommy, there's a man." I moved faster than I ever have
before. I grabbed her and ran from the room turning on all the lights in
the house as I went! She didn't seem as afriad of the"man" as she she was
of the "people". When I told my family they told me it was only her imagination
and there was nothing in my house but up until we moved to another city
I refused to sleep without a light on. I would appreciate some feedback
on this. Does anyone think she really saw something?</B>

<P><B>The Quiet Visitor</B>

<P><B>By: Wa1ksWithReb0ks@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>This happened to me when I was in high school, in the two-bedroom
apartment that I shared with my mother at the time in Huntington Beach,
California.&nbsp; It was extremely late--actually early, considering--about
four in the morning.&nbsp; I had just got home from a fun night with my
friends.&nbsp; I was exhausted.&nbsp; I wearily put on my pajamas and crawled
into bed, burying myself under the covers and quickly began drifting off.&nbsp;
Though I genuinely believe something happened, I will grant that I was
at that inbetween moment between being awake and falling asleep.</B>
<BR><B>As I lay in bed, a figure walked into my room, entering from the
hallway through the door to the right of my bed as I lay on it.&nbsp; It
was the figure of a woman:&nbsp; slightly heavy, wearing a sweater of broad
blue and white stripes, and with a dark blonde--perhapse starwberry--hair.&nbsp;
She walked with a shuffling gait, hands clasped in front of her, head down
in a very submissive pose.&nbsp; I never saw her face, which was hidden
in shadows cast by the short, yet sweeping mane of hair... a very motherly
style of hair.</B>
<BR><B>In fact, I thought it WAS my mother.&nbsp; It was a reasonable assumption,
considering she was the only other person I knew to be in the apartment.&nbsp;
She crossed in front of my bed and sat facing me in the chair by my desk
at the left-hand foot of my bed, still appearing very submissive.&nbsp;
Her face was still hidden.</B>
<BR><B>I don't remember what it was that I said, I was very tired, after
all, but I said something, believing the visitor to be my mother.&nbsp;
The figure sitting at my desk then began to quietly, yet violently, to
thrash her head back and forth!&nbsp; She just kept doing it, non-stop!</B>
<BR><B>This was scaring the hell out of me.&nbsp; I said something, but
the figure continued her violent head movements.&nbsp; She just would not
stop!&nbsp; Real terror then gripped me and I began to crawl away from
the figure, dragging by blankets with me.&nbsp; Every time I looked back
at the figure, she was still just sitting there, shaking her head back
and forth, the hair was flying about so that I still couldn't see a face.</B>
<BR><B>As I got to the door to the hall, I took one last look.&nbsp; She
was still there and still thrashing her head!&nbsp; I then went to my mothers
room and woke her, insisting that there was someone in my room.&nbsp; She
went in and checked everywhere... no one.&nbsp; No one in the bathroom
(it was the master room), no one in the closet, and the window was in tact
and we were on the second floor, so no jumping and no other means of mundane
escape was available.&nbsp; Nothing.</B>
<BR><B>Well, as you can probably imagine, this whole incident unnerved
me so that for the next week, I slept each night out on the couch in the
living room.&nbsp; This was without a doubt, one of the creepiest moments
in my life.&nbsp; I still remember every detail down to the posters that
were on my walls at the time.</B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;The Scratching</B>

<P><B>By: musicajava@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>During the first two weeks of July 2001 we had the following encounter
in our home in Florida. My name is Jean and my husbands' name is Scott,
at the time in our lives I was six months pregnant and my husband was playing
guitar as a profession. The first episode of the encounter took place while
I was cooking in the kitchen and I kept hearing a scratching sound coming
from the back bathroom. I went into the music room and asked Scott if he
heard anything and he said "yes, I thought it was you cooking," we then
went into the bathroom and listened closely. There was indeed a scratching
sound coming from inside the wall in between the kitchen and bathroom.
We called the exterminator, thinking mice had invaded us due to the slight
degree of the sound. The exterminator found no evidence of any pests, upon
his rather thorough inspection. Within a week the scratching had gotten
louder and more insistent. Scott did his own inpectirue stories of his
encounters if you would like. By the way, our son was born premature three
days after the ridding and unfortunately died in Scotts' hands after only
three ours of life.</B>

<P><B>The Screaming Girl</B>

<P><B>By: Slsawyer322@aol.com</B>

<P><B>A number of years ago, my then husband and I were vacationing near
Lake Tahoe in Northern California.&nbsp; We decided to go for a long drive
through the forest roads.&nbsp; We were having a great time, laughing,
talking.&nbsp; The radio was turned on, the music was blaring, and I was
not thinking about much of anything except the beautiful day and the adventure
we were on.&nbsp; Suddenly right in the middle of all of this as we passed
this one particular spot, I distinctly heard two very loud bone chilling,
blood curdling screams that sounded like they had come from a little girl.&nbsp;
I heard it above our talking, the music, the wind in the open windows,
the engine roar, everything.&nbsp; It sent the hair up on the back of my
neck.&nbsp; Yet, I thought I might be going a littlep a fight, so in one
small clearing, he struck her and knocked her out.&nbsp; I then saw him
carry her off in a specific direction out into the forest where he raped,
murdered and buried her.&nbsp; I saw how he had brought her here in his
car from a location far away.&nbsp; I did not report this to the police--they
would think me certifiable.&nbsp; Some say I should have gone to the police,
but how could I explain how I got this information?&nbsp; I don't know
if it was her ghost relaying this to me or the leftover energy from the
experience, but I have never forgotten her screams.</B>

<P><B>The Sister</B>

<P><B>By: Nicki22@i-love-cats.com</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>&nbsp; Hi. I am 11 years old. I have a ghost story.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Last summer, I spent the day with a friend, we'll call her
Sara. Her mom is the secretary for the school Sara and I go to, so she
has to go there someimes during the summer. They say that the school is
haunted by a nun. I think her name is spelled Sister Rapheal. I don't know
why she sticks around.She was also the 5th grade teacher.Well,went to the
school. My school is made up of three buildings if you don't include the
church. They are the Parish Center, the Lower Elementary Building, and
the Upper Elementary and Middle School(6-8th grade).</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sara and I go to the Upper Elementary Building,which
is where the office is. Sara and I went to the first floor hall, her mom
and sister in the office. We decided to pretend that the staircase was
a mountain and that we had to climb it.We got up the first flight of stairs,
the second floor which has the 5th,4th, and 6th grade classrooms. I asked
her If she wanted to go and look,but she didn't want to. So we went up
the other flight and looked in the 7th and 8th grade homerooms, the Science
lab and Science room.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we went back downstairs and sang Girl Scout
songs. Later, I wanted to walk back upstairs. I asked Sara, but she didn't
want to. So I went alone. I went upstairs to the second floor. I opened
the double doors to go down the hallway. I was less than halfway down the
hall when I started to feel presure around me. I then saw a shadow in the
corner of my eye in front of the double doors I just passed. I just ran
back that way, and flew down the steps to the first floor.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I saw at the corner of my eye,again, a shadowy figure on
the first landing.I then ran down the hall to Sara. I was SCARED!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;That's not the only time I saw Sister Rapheal. When I was
in 5th grade, I went to the coatcloset to get something ou of my backpack.
I thought I saw someone, so I said Hi. I looked up and there was no one
there. I was only scared a little then. I'm not the only one who saw her.
My 5th grade teacher, the cleaning lady,and two of my friends have seen
her,too. I'll tell you one more story.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; This also happened while I was in 5th grade. After school,as
volunteers and not too much after school, my friend,we'll call her Kate,
and another person in my class, we'll call him Jim, washed the boards.
Jim went to empty the bucket of water in the sink while Kate waited outside.
She then saw something go inside our classroom and thought it was Jim.
She thought that he probably went up the other staircase. She went in the
room, but no one was there.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;So, we're not sure why she still stays here. Could she have
died here? I don't know. So, that's all for now.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;The Train Bridge</B>

<P><B>By: roovisk@hotmail.com</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I never really believed in ghosts, spirits
or whatever.&nbsp; That was until</B>
<BR><B>one night me and my friends Josh and Rocky were driving to the country.</B>
<BR><B>Rocky and I had been drinking and Josh was the the DD that night.&nbsp;
We came</B>
<BR><B>to the old train bridge that we had visited many times before.&nbsp;
This bridge</B>
<BR><B>was very old. It was made of wood and passed over a valley that
a train ran</B>
<BR><B>through underneath.&nbsp; It was a somewhat foggy night that night.&nbsp;
We stopped</B>
<BR><B>on the bridge just as we had several times in the pass. Josh was
the first</B>
<BR><B>to get out of the 1988 Monte Carlo of mine.&nbsp; He went to the
side of the</B>
<BR><B>bridge and looked over the side.&nbsp; Rocky and I got out and were
in the middle</B>
<BR><B>of the bridge.&nbsp; Josh said to us, "hey there are people down
there on the</B>
<BR><B>tracks. You can just barely see them through the fog."&nbsp; Rocky
and I went to</B>
<BR><B>where he was at the edge of the bridge and looked over. It did look
like</B>
<BR><B>there might be people down there laying on the tracks facing up
at us, but</B>
<BR><B>it was very hard to tell. We made up excuses of what it might really
be.&nbsp; So</B>
<BR><B>Rocky and i went to the other side of the bridge to look over. Rocky
and I</B>
<BR><B>were convinced it was just the way the light was shining through
the fog.</B>
<BR><B>Josh however was still scared and raving that it was really people
down</B>
<BR><B>there.&nbsp; Rocky thought that it would be fun to scare Josh a
little bit and</B>
<BR><B>started yelling stupid things, but then said, " Death is here, I
can feel</B>
<BR><B>him, Show your boney face Death!!" Out of nowhere from under the
bridge came</B>
<BR><B>this floating figure all black except for its face.&nbsp; Its face
was the palest</B>
<BR><B>shade of white and grey you could imagine.&nbsp; IT had no eyes,
just hollow</B>
<BR><B>black pits where eyes should be.&nbsp; Neither Rocky nor I could
move.&nbsp; Today Im</B>
<BR><B>not sure if it was fear or the power of the ghost we were looking
at that</B>
<BR><B>froze us in out place.&nbsp; Suddenly it fell to the bottom and
when it ran for</B>
<BR><B>the trees that covered the hillside on the west side of the valley
the fog</B>
<BR><B>parted around him then filled back in when he vanished in the trees.&nbsp;
Rocky</B>
<BR><B>and I turned abruptly in fright to see Josh jumping up and down
yelling that</B>
<BR><B>the people on the tracks were floating up to get us.. we ran back
to the car</B>
<BR><B>and bugged out of there as fast as were could.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later I asked my grandmother about that
bridge and she told me about an</B>
<BR><B>old family that was talked about when she was a child.&nbsp; She
said her</B>
<BR><B>grandmother told her that there was a family that had a child at
a very late</B>
<BR><B>age.&nbsp; They were very rich owning a barge company that ran up
and down the</B>
<BR><B>Illinois River in those days.&nbsp; They died when the boy was very
young and</B>
<BR><B>left thier mansion to him alone.&nbsp; There he lived with only
an old butler</B>
<BR><B>type guy to care for him.&nbsp; I guess his loneliness consumed
him and he went</B>
<BR><B>nuts.&nbsp; Near this bridge back then was a small town. People
started comming</B>
<BR><B>up missing from this town.&nbsp; Evidently the boy who was now a
man was killing</B>

<P><B>The Train Home</B>

<P><B>By: Rturman@webtv.net</B>

<P><B>Approximately 10 years ago when I just sepersted from my husbad,
my two</B>
<BR><B>daughters and I ages 6 and 11 moved into a very old 6 family house
that</B>
<BR><B>was called a train or locomotive setup similar to the inside of
a train.</B>
<BR><B>Any rate, we moved in with total reluctance&nbsp; and from the beginning&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>had a feeling in my gut that something just wasnt right. I tried
to make</B>
<BR><B>it as homey as I could but something or someone didnt want us to
leave</B>
<BR><B>ther. One night my oldest daughter was taking a bath but said she
was</B>
<BR><B>afrai and wanted her younger sister to at least stay with her until
she</B>
<BR><B>was done. The fear that I felt was the same fear I saw on my girls</B>
<BR><B>faces. The next morning I woke up and in my kichen was my daughters</B>
<BR><B>heavy winter coat on top of my refrigerator. There was no way either</B>
<BR><B>daughter did this--why would they. There coats ended up only on
the</B>
<BR><B>floor--but the top of the&nbsp; refigerator? So--I let it go but
then another</B>
<BR><B>thing happened----I was home most of the time on the weekends by
myself</B>
<BR><B>because my daughters were with their father. I remember getting
a strong</B>
<BR><B>smell every once in awhile that would only happen when I felll asleep,
I</B>
<BR><B>would wake up because the smell was so rancid and I knew it wasnt
an</B>
<BR><B>oder I have ever smelled before. As soon as it would wake me up-----it</B>
<BR><B>was gone. I hated what was going on and the icing on the cake was
that I</B>
<BR><B>would see things in the corner of my eye, as if someone walked past</B>
<BR><B>me---but also felt a slight breeze. I never told my kids about these</B>
<BR><B>happenings but they feared the house also. We ended up moving out
after</B>
<BR><B>4 moths of living there and I ended up doing some research on the
house</B>
<BR><B>and&nbsp; found that a woman that lived there not too many years
previous to</B>
<BR><B>me had put her infant son in the oven and then placed him in the
garbage</B>
<BR><B>dumster that was in the back yard, which afterwards&nbsp; police
found the</B>
<BR><B>baby's body. This house is located on Prospect St. Naugatuck Connecticut</B>
<BR><B>Thanks for listening!</B>

<BR><B>&nbsp; The Yellow Eyes</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>By: CoRnFlAkE91@aol.com</B>

<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Last year at my friend Nicole's birthday party were playing with
a video camera. We were walking around in her house in the dark recording
on night vision. We walked into the room where her table was and passed
it and were standing in the kitchen. When I turned around and looked back
at the pantry door. In the cat door we saw these big yellow eyes. At first
thinking it was the cat we paid no attention to it.</B>
<BR><B>When we got back in her room we were telling every one what we saw
and then Jessie was sitting in the corner holding the cat. She told us
that Sabrina (the cat) had been in the room with her the whole time we
were out walking around. By now we were all about to shit our self's. We
got up the courage to go back out and see if it was still there. It was.
Then we decided to get someone to put there hand in the cat door and see
if it touched them. Well no one was stupid enough to fall for that so we
decided to put the cat in there. When she got in there we herd hissing.
Then Sabrina came running out, taking her back into the room were cuts
and blood on here face. We didn't leave the room again that night.</B>
<BR><B>Then at about 4:00 am we herd something outside in the hall. We
made Nicole go and see what it was. When she opened the door we all saw
what it was. There about half way down the hall there was all little girl
with yellow eyes laughing. Nicole ran back and jumped on the bed. The little
girl came all the way up to the door then disappeared. There was nothing
the rest of the night none of us slept. Everyone that was there hasn't
been over to Nicole's since.</B>

<P><B>Shiver</B>

<P><B>By: cuz_im@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>&nbsp; This story is about a ghost named Tommy, we met him shortly
after we moved to Prince George B.C. Although we didn't know it then, we
now believe that our newly adopted 9 week old puppy,Jacob, met him first...or
at least was the first to let us know that there was someone else there
with us. We(myself,my husband and our 2 daughters)had been living there
for about a month when we decided to get a dog, we had heard a few strange&nbsp;
things&nbsp; but never related them to anything in particular other than
we must be hearing things. It wasn't until we got Jacob that we started
to suspect something was amiss.We noticed that he would growl at nothing
sometimes and refuse to follow us down the hallway or would sit and shiver
in the porch. Again we thought he must be nervous being in a new home and
away from his other family.&nbsp;&nbsp; One night my husband and I were
just hanging out relaxing in the living room watching some t.v. when my
husband heard " Hey Tom". ( my husbands name is also Tom).Tom asked me
" Did you say something?" My reply was "no". Not believing me my husband
insisted it was me until our dog changed before our eyes, he went from
a mild mannered baby king shepard/golden retreiver, into a growling,snarling,
hair standing on end uncontrolable animal... My husband heard it again,
"Hey Tom". This time my husband jumped up and looked down the hallway of
our trailor in the same direction as our puppy... there he saw the shadow
of a man."Dar" (that's me) he said, " Someone is in the house". I did not
see what he saw so i could not comfirm that there was a man there but,
I could feel a very cold blanket of air come over us. My husband insisted
that he saw the glowing figure of a fairly lean young man in our hall and
of course had to check it out. As we neared the hallway, half scared and
half joking about who should go first, our puppy suddenly put on the brakes...he
refused to go down the hall...the cold feeling got stronger and the hair
on our arms and necks stood as high as the fur on our dog, his back and
neck hair stood like a grizzlies and he would not go any further. Tom and
I made our way, (arm in arm) to the back bedroom to check on the girls
and make sure they were ok. We checked the bathroom and our bedroom on
the way and found nothing as we did when we got to the girls room. There
was only one door left to check...the back door entrance. This door led
into a little mud room or back porch where we took off our dirty work boots
and such, this door did not have a proper lock on it so it had to be tied
shut. We thought that this must be how the intruder got in, maybe we had
forgotten to tie it shut. Taking a deep breath before we opened the door,
we thought we had it figured out but, the door was tied shut and there
was no way someone had come in that way. The cold feeling came back even
stronger and this time rushed past us to the outter door, the door shook
a little and then the cold was gone. Jacob calmbed down some and his fur
relaxed. Tom and I looked at each other not saying anything but, we bothe
knew that what just happened was not normal. We had a brief discussion
about it that night and decided that we would not say anything to the girls
as we did not want to freak them out.( at that time our girls were just
turned 12 and almost 10) Over the next couple of weeks not much happened,we
would hear the odd wierd noise but nothing too concerning. As it was not
quite yet the end of winter, my husband wasn't working steady( he's a concrete
finisher) and we were laying in bed being&nbsp; lazy after we sent the
girls to school, I heard the deffinate sounds of feet shuffling in my kitchen
and the sounds of cupboard doors opening and closing. I got up to see if
one of the girls had come home, we only lived 2 doors from the school and
i thought maybe one of the girls came home sick but, when i went out to
the kitchen there was no-one there. Again the cold feeling came back and
I felt really creepy. Just as I was about to go tell Tom about this he
called "What did you say", I had said nothing. I told my husband that it
was not me talking to him. He said that he again heard his name being called.
A week or so went by and our youngest daughter Mel was playing outside,
she came in with one of our neighbours whom we had never met but had seen
a time or two, she was 22 and had a 3 year old son. We became friends and
had coffees now and then. She had lived next door since she was 11 years
old and still lived there with her family. I asked her right away if anything
strange ever happened on there property and thats when everything started
to make sence. She eplained to us that when she was a young teen she became
very ill and while she was recovering at home a ghost named Tommy came
to her. Tommy was a 22 year old man. There used to be an old shed on the
back corner of their propertywhich joined the back corner of our property
and at one time it all used to be the same property, anyway Tommy was apparently
shot in the doorway of the shed that used to be on the land. He&nbsp; would
sit with her when she was sick and never seamed to bother her or harm her
in any way. This floored my husband because the discriptions matched and
my husband also had a hard time believing in ghosts in the first place.
After we started talking to our nieghbour more about Tommy, more weird
things started to happen only this time they were way more seroius.</B>

<P><B>Scary to this Day</B>

<P><B>By: angeldiva39@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>this is such a true story it even scares me to this day............about
3 years ago when i was 10, i would be in my room laying on my bed in the
dark and i would see what looked like a young boy about 13 or 14 that would
just come sit in my room and watch me. so later that day i asked my mom
if she had another boy she didn't tell me about and my mom asked why. i
told her what i saw and about how old he looked and she nearly passed out.
she told me she had another boy (who would've been my older brother) who
would only be a little older then me and i was shocked. as i got older,
i saw the "ghostly boy presense" even less until i didn't see him at all
and slowly forgot about him. but, im now 13 and just the other day (Dec.
16) i thought i saw a more hazy presense that came out of my closet when
i was getting ready to go to bed. i told my mom and the subject was brought
up once again. this time when i told her, she told me something she hadn't
told me before.</B>
<BR><B>before i had started seeing the "young presence" my mom had gone
to a party for a wedding where instead of there being a stripper, there
was a pshycic. the pshycic knew my mom had 2 kids (my younger brother and
i) and she also knew my mom had another child who had died after birth.
she told my mom that he was still hanging around our home and us because
he wasn't ready to "leave" yet and that not to worry he wouldn't hurt us.
she also said that he was jelous of my little brother and that he didn't
like my dad very much.</B>
<BR><B>about 6 months after the pshycic was when i started seeing "the
presence" and thats why my mom nearly freaked when i told her i was seeing
this because if he was still alive, he would be about 15, just a little
older then me, which is about how old the boy i was seeing was.</B>

<BR><B>4 Generations of Hauntings</B>

<P><B>By: sherrainKokomo@webtv.net</B>

<P><B>I have lots of stories,but first of all you have to understand that</B>
<BR><B>these kind of things have been happening to my family for four</B>
<BR><B>generations,so I don't know where to really begin. So i guess I
will</B>
<BR><B>tell you about the last thing that has happened to me. About a week
ago</B>
<BR><B>on a Wensday night I had came home (and I live in an Apt building
now,so</B>
<BR><B>there should be no one here?) and i went to hang up a silk blouse
that i</B>
<BR><B>didn't want to get wrinkled,and when I shut the closet door i heard
a</B>
<BR><B>banging and scratching noise,so I thought "I wonder what that is?</B>
<BR><B>because where I used to live I had a cat,but I couldn't bring him
with</B>
<BR><B>me here,and before he used to get sometimes shut in the closet ,so
i</B>
<BR><B>knew that wasn't it) so I opened the door to the closet,and I saw</B>
<BR><B>something I will never forget! The clothes in the closet where actually</B>
<BR><B>flying off of hangers!!&nbsp; I didn't know what to do, so I started
trying</B>
<BR><B>to catch the clothes,and I was screaming "QUIT,QUIT" but they just
kept</B>
<BR><B>on, and the all of sudden it just stopped! NOW I DON'T DRINK! OR
DO</B>
<BR><B>DRUGS! AND THIS IS ONLY ONE OF MANY THINGS,I'll tell you more later,but</B>
<BR><B>the strange thring is this happened on Wensday and on Monday that
next</B>
<BR><B>week a close friend died an untimely death, and I just marked it
off as</B>
<BR><B>a warning from a angel telling me to get my clothes in order as
i would</B>
<BR><B>be needing them, and I did,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you would like to hear more,</B>
<BR><B>I'll be happy to tell you more. i have lots of them,and they have
been</B>
<BR><B>passed down from my granmother,my great grandmother,to my mother,to</B>
<BR><B>me,and now they have been passed down to my daughter,and now my</B>
<BR><B>granddaughter! It seems it is the first born daughter in the family,and</B>
<BR><B>my granddaughter is 9 yrs old and she has had several experence's</B>
