<H3><A NAME=miracle>A Miracle</A>
</H3><P><B>by Tarianna21@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Early 1960's  I guess is when I first started having experiences. I
was about</B>
<P><B>3 and I came down with Spinal Menengitis(sp?).  Before my mother knew
I was</B>
<P><B>sick I started having confulsions (again sp?).  By the time I had gotten

to</B>
<P><B>the hospital I had lasped into a coma.  The Drs. told my family that

they</B>
<P><B>would do all they could but they didn't hold out much hope for me.

 They</B>
<P><B>didn't think I would last another 24 hours. They told my family to
pray and to</B>
<P><B>start thinking about my funeral arrangments.</B>
<P><B>   Meanwhile I remember going down a dark hallway to a bright light(I

know</B>
<P><B>typical right?) Before I could reach the end a lady with with long
black hair,</B>
<P><B>bright blue eyes  and a very loving face carressed my cheek and told
me I had</B>
<P><B>to go back, because it was not my time  and I still had alot to accomplish

in</B>
<P><B>my life.</B>
<P><B>      I came out of the coma much to the dr's surprise. My family was
told it</B>
<P><B>was a miracle.  I told my mother about the nice lady and she told me

sick</B>
<P><B>people sometimes dream strange things. It was forgotten until a few
years and</B>
<P><B>experiences later, I was about 6 and looking through my grandmothers

photo</B>
<P><B>album when there was a picture of the nice lady.  I asked my grandma
who the</B>
<P><B>lady was and was told it was my great Aunt who had died several years

before</B>
<P><B>my birth.</B>
<P><B>    I would love some feedback about if this is why I can sometimes

see</B>
<P><B>things, hear things or sense things that other people cannot.  Or if

the</B>
<P><B>reason I can do this is because I was raised in an atmosphere where

the</B>
<P><B>supernatural was very commonplace and nothing to be scared of.  Thanks

for</B>
<P><B>your time and please only serious e-mail since I take this subject

very</B>
<P><B>seriously.</B>

<H3><A NAME=my>My Parents' Story</A>
</H3><P><B>by ejhst13@pitt.edu </B>
<P>
<P><B>  This story was told</B>
<P><B>to me by my parents.  I was in the house at the time but I was very

young.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	My parents are from Joplin, MO.  In the early to mid seventies, my</B>
<P><B>father got a job teaching at a community college in Philadelphia. 
My</B>
<P><B>parents went out there to find a house.  They found a house for sale

that</B>
<P><B>they really liked a lot and they made arrangements to see it.  My

parents</B>
<P><B>and the realtor showed up at the house.  Before they knocked on the

door,</B>
<P><B>however, the realtor let them in on a bit of inside information.  She

said</B>
<P><B>to them "you think that you're looking at this house and judging

whether</B>
<P><B>or not you want it.  Actually it's the other way around.  these owners

are</B>
<P><B>judging you and they're going to decide whether you're good enough
to buy</B>
<P><B>their house."  My parents were like okay, whatever. Apparently the

couple</B>
<P><B>who lived in the house had built it themselves.  The husband had

basically</B>
<P><B>built the house with his own two hands and they were in love with

their</B>
<P><B>house.  But as they got older, they soon found they couldn't care for</B>
<P><B>themselves and they were forced into a rest home.  They were so</B>
<P><B>heartbroken over leaving their house.  So who lived in it after them

was</B>
<P><B>very important to them.  </B>
<P><B>	My parents met the owners and they really hit it off.  The old</B>
<P><B>husband even gave my dad his power tools and work bench since he

wouldn't</B>
<P><B>be needing them at the rest home.  My parents bought the house.

 Later,</B>
<P><B>they found out that other people had offered the couple MORE money
then my</B>
<P><B>parents but they had refused them, and had let my parents buy it. 
</B>
<P><B>	The story fastforwards a few years.  I was about three years old,</B>
<P><B>which would have made my sister six.  So I guess it was around 1979-80

or</B>
<P><B>so.  It was in the middle of the night.  My parents were asleep in

their</B>
<P><B>bed room, which was on the first floor, when all of a sudden my

father</B>
<P><B>heard a "aa-huh", like a very distinct human sigh.  Just one sigh,

right</B>
<P><B>above his head.  My mother heard it too.  They stood there terrified
for a</B>
<P><B>few moments....each was hoping the other had sighed.  They soon

discovered</B>
<P><B>that neither had sighed.  And obviously you don't wake yourself up

with</B>
<P><B>your own sigh.  My father's second thought, after he realised my

mother</B>
<P><B>had not made the noise, was that a robber was in the house.  He jumped

up,</B>
<P><B>turned on the lights, but no one was there.  He checked the house from

top</B>
<P><B>to bottom.  All the windows and doors were locked from the inside.
 My</B>
<P><B>sister and I were fast asleep.  My parents went back to bed and tried

to</B>
<P><B>forget about it.</B>
<P><B>	A few months later, my mother ran into the former owner, the wife,</B>
<P><B>at the store or something.  My mother found out that her husband, the

old</B>
<P><B>man who built the house, had passed away.  He died at the exact same</B>
<P><B>time my mother and father heard the digh.  My mother swears to this

day</B>
<P><B>that that old man took his last breath in his beloved house.  My

father,</B>
<P><B>who is a scientist and a huge skeptic of everything says, "I don't

believe</B>
<P><B>in ghosts or anything supernatural.  But I heard that sigh.  Just as

clear</B>
<P><B>as can be, I heard it.  And I'll never forget it."  </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>what makes this story so amazing is that my father doesn't beleive
in</B>
<P><B>ANYTHING and he swears it happened.  </B>

<H3><A NAME=george>George</A>
</H3><P><B>by aclemens@dialnet.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>    I don't know if you will believe me or not, but I often wonder
if there is something in my house.  One morning about three years ago I got
up and went into my bathroom.  I knew I was alone in the house because I
work nights and everybody else works days.  All of the sudden something started

banging on the walls like a child trying to be funny.  Later I told my mother

about it and she said it had happened to her, but she figured it was some
kind of animal living in our walls.  Now I grant you, animals do make noises,
but this was something else.  </B>
<P><B>    The next night I got to bed late (as always) and had just laid
down when I heard what sounded like footsteps running up and down the stairs.
 I was absolutely scared, but it didn't wake my parents at all.  I told my
mother about it and again she said it was probably mice.  Two nights later
my cat was sleeping on my bed when the footsteps returned.  The cat woke
up immediately and wanted to investigate, but I was afraid to let her go.
 I learned later that I should have because animals can sense spirits.  Late
at night when I on the computer or watching t.v. the lights will flicker
or on a couple of occasions I've had to fight to shut the door to the computer

room when normally it shuts fine.  I've heard footsteps walk across the upstairs

landing and felt my bed get a sudden shake when I go to bed.  </B>
<P><B>    The spirit seems to have a knack for teasing one of my friends
as well.  She never saw any evidence of the ghost until one evening when
her, my mother, and I were sitting watching television.  I noticed that every
so often she would make a strange face and look to the side.  She did this
about 3 or 4 times.  Finally when my mother went to be she told me why. 
She could hear someone breathing in her ear.  She said that she thought it
was me or my mom, but as she listened she realized that rather than hearing
three people breathing, she was hearing four.  The next night she came over
again and suddenly looked nervous as we were standing by the table.  Apparently

the ghost was running his fingers through her hair.  We have named this spirit,

George.  One of my other friends is rather superstitious and won't stay real
late at my house because she doesn't want to meet George.  I'm not as afraid
as I used to be except when it's walking.  I still get nervous when I hear
the footsteps walk across the floor upstairs.  My house was built either
in the very early twenties or the very late teens.  I was asked once if there
was any room I felt uncomfortable in.  I hadn't thought about it before,
but yes there is.  There is an upstairs walk-in closet that I hate to go
into.  First of all it slants because it was built between my room and the
roof.  Secondly, I don't care how much light you bring with you, you just
can't dispel the darkness in there.  The closet is used to store all the
dolls my mother collects so I don't have much cause to go in there, but when
I do I try not to go beyond the doorway.  I'm the only one the spirit does

anything to with the exception of my friend.  There is no one else in my
family that believes. </B>

</H3><P><B>by tonyranner@shenessex.heartland.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I live in Iowa and I have all through my life loved </B>
<P><B>paranormal experiences. Although I have not Had one my self, My sister,

mother, </B>
<P><B>father, and uncle have. &nbsp;Before I was born (when my sister was
a </B>
<P><B>baby) They all lived in a house in Kansas. As I was told, My uncle
would hear </B>
<P><B>footsteps going up and down the stairs to the attic. (which was through
his </B>
<P><B>room.) &nbsp;&nbsp;He would hear them all hours of the day or night.
And sometimes </B>
<P><B>they would stop in front of him as if to say hi! &nbsp;As I said my
sister was a baby and one night my </B>
<P><B>mom went downstairs to check on her and seen a man! He look real but
real pale </B>
<P><B>and his hands and feet were almost transparent. &nbsp;All he was doing
was </B>
<P><B>standing over my sister's crib looking at her. He looked at my mom
and soon </B>
<P><B>after he left. (I don't know how!) And at night my mom left a big Bible

open on her </B>
<P><B>stand to a certain page and every morning she woke up and it was closed.

</B>
<P><B>Everytime she did this it would always close. &nbsp;I am sure these
things are true because my uncle </B>
<P><B>and mom are not one's to lie about something of this sort. &nbsp;The
House later </B>
<P><B>was tore down and now a lake is where the house was.</B>

</H3><P><B>by townsend@iamerica.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am from a very small town in Madison Parish Louisiana One cold

Feburary</B>
<P><B>night, my 5 sisters and I were going to visit my dad's brothers as
was a</B>
<P><B>habit of ours to do so a couple of times during the week.. My fahter
had a</B>
<P><B>work van in which the motor was encased on the inside of the van. 
Since it</B>
<P><B>had only a driver's seat and a passenger seat, some of us had to sit
on top</B>
<P><B>of the motor case.  This night, in particular, we took a different
route to</B>
<P><B>our uncles' home for some unkonwn reason. As we turned onto a side

street,</B>
<P><B>only one of my other sisters and I saw a woman with long flowing brown

hair</B>
<P><B>down to her waist and a long flowing white gown, glide across the

street</B>
<P><B>about 1 or 2 blocks ahead of us.  My sister and both looked at each

other</B>
<P><B>at the same time, and said "Did you see that?"  One second she was
to our</B>
<P><B>left and the next she was across the street and then just vanished.

 When</B>
<P><B>we got home later that night, I told my mother what my sister and I

had</B>
<P><B>seen.  She said that many, many years (I'm not sure if it was in the

arly</B>
<P><B>1900's) that a young lady who lived in that area was to be married.
 On her</B>
<P><B>wedding night, her fiance' was tragically killed before the wedding

could</B>
<P><B>take place.  The bride, who was very much in love with her fiance',

pined</B>
<P><B>away and died from the greif of her loss.  My mother said that my

sister</B>
<P><B>and I were not the only ones who had seen this lady.  I will never

forget</B>
<P><B>the apparition that I saw that night and I truly believe that what
I saw</B>
<P><B>was a ghost from the past.</B>

<H3><A NAME=home>The Ghosts in My Home</A>
</H3><P><B>by charlottestangledweb@yahoo.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I saw your web page on my computer at college.  My family and I have</B>
<P><B>had quite a few dealings with what I think are ghosts at my house.
 I</B>
<P><B>never used to believe in that type of thing, but when you see things</B>
<P><B>with your own eyes and several others also see, you begin to believe.</B>
<P>
<P><B>It really makes me question what I was brought up to believe as a</B>
<P><B>child, that, when you die, you either go to heaven or hell.  If that</B>
<P><B>is so, who the heck is roaming around my house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is who I think may be in my house.  In 1971, there was a tragic</B>
<P><B>fire two doors north of where I now live.  A family of 5 were all</B>
<P><B>killed in that fire.  The house was torn down after the fire.  There</B>
<P><B>were two boys and two girls killed in the fire along with their</B>
<P><B>father.  The mother was the only one to get out.  The ghosts that I</B>
<P><B>personally have seen seemed to be that of a small boy who looked like</B>
<P><B>a dark shadow going down to my basement and months later, I saw a</B>
<P><B>girl</B>
<P><B>in a white gown going from my kitchen to my daughter's bedroom.  I</B>
<P><B>thought it was my daughter at first.  I said, Becky, and my daughter</B>
<P><B>answered from behind me.  I knew it wasn't her then so I got up and</B>
<P><B>went into my other daughter's bedroom to see if it were her.  She was</B>
<P><B>asleep, wearing a black tee shirt, the person I saw glide through the</B>
<P><B>hall was wearing a white gown.</B>
<P><B>I was rather freaked out by this.  This was several years ago that
I</B>
<P><B>saw anything, but several others have seen the man in our house.  I</B>
<P><B>never saw him, but I think that he messes with our clocks.</B>

<H3><A NAME=campus>Campus Ghost</A>
</H3><P><B>by cgwilliams@kpmg.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I just discovered your page and I wanted to share a recent experience

with</B>
<P><B>you. I live in Boise Idaho and this past summer I went to the Boise

State</B>
<P><B>Campus one morning to pick up a catalogue. It was during the late

summer</B>
<P><B>after summer school had ended so there was literally nobody around
as I was</B>
<P><B>walking through the big quad area. Except for the grass and

cris-crossing</B>
<P><B>walk areas there are only a pair of large (very wide) "Christmas

Trees"</B>
<P><B>growing in the quad. I was wondering where the administrative building

was</B>
<P><B>since I'm not familiar with the campus and was looking for somebody
to ask.</B>
<P><B>There was only one man walking across the campus about 100 feet from
me. To</B>
<P><B>get close enough to him to ask directions, I knew I had to speed up
to get</B>
<P><B>around one of the very wide trees to intercept him. I noticed he was

wearing</B>
<P><B>dark jeans and a long sleeved dark work shirt with buttons down the

front</B>
<P><B>and some sort of dark baseball cap. Very odd clothing for a 100+ degree

day.</B>
<P><B>He appeared to be in his late forties and had a bushy dark beard. It

occured</B>
<P><B>to me that he probably would not know where the administrative building

was</B>
<P><B>since he did not look like somebody who inhabited a college campus.
I also</B>
<P><B>noticed that the man was very thin, his thighs showed through the jeans

and</B>
<P><B>were as narrow as my calfs. When I raced around the tree and expected
to see</B>
<P><B>him he was gone. I looked farther down (had he started to sprint I
may have</B>
<P><B>missed him) but I did not see him. There was no explanation as to where

he</B>
<P><B>could have gone. </B>
<P><HR>
<H3><A NAME=closet>The Thing in My Closet</A>
</H3><P><B>by dethanjl@mindspring.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>i suppose that every kid imagines a monster in the closet or under
the bed at one time or another.and i had in fact began to belive my experience
to be the result of a young fertile imagination.</B>
<P><B>  </B>
<P><B>you see, my room was located in the basement of my parents home. located

next to the basement stairs. my closet ran under the stair and had only an
open doorway. no door. as i lay trying to sleep at night i was sure i could

discerne a pair of glowing red eyes staring at me from the closet doorway!
this allways filled me with a sence of fear and trepidation.</B>
<P><B>  </B>
<P><B>i could never quite make out the body of the apparition,more like having
an idea of the shape and size,but never really seeing it. i also had the
strange feeling that the apparition indeed wished me ill. furthermore there
was some "force" that restricted it to the closet.</B>
<P><B>  </B>
<P><B>however, as i said. i had begun to doubt the evidence of my own experience.

until years after i had left the family home , my cousin came to stay with
my mom and dad due to "family difficulties". she stayed in my former room.
mom informed me that she was having trouble sleeping. however, she could
not seem to get her to give any reason as to her apparent insomnia.</B>
<P><B>  </B>
<P><B>my mother asked me to to talk to her, fearing her dificulties stemed
from the problems in the family. she further belived that being closer in
age might make it easier for her to open up.</B>
<P><B>  </B>
<P><B>she described to me exactly the same manifestation i had "imagined"
when i slept in that room! after a room change she was once again able to
sleep comfortably at night.</B>

<H3><A NAME=state>Eastern State Pen</A>
</H3><P><B>by mcafee@aacr.org</B>
<P>
<P><B>My boyfriend and I decided to do something different as a prelude to</B>
<P><B>Halloween this year.  On Saturday, October 24 (3 days ago) we went
on a</B>
<P><B>ghost tour of the Eastern State Penitentiary located in the Fairmount</B>
<P><B>section of Philadelphia.  The prison is very old, having been built

in</B>
<P><B>the early 1900's and was in use until 1971.  At one time, it was</B>
<P><B>considered the prison to model all others after.  Among its many

famous</B>
<P><B>prisoners, Al Capone once spent some time at the prison.  The prison

is</B>
<P><B>reputed to be haunted, as many prisoners were murdered in their cells

or</B>
<P><B>died of disease while incarcerated.  As background for me, I have

seen</B>
<P><B>and sensed ghosts all my life.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We stood in line outside the prison at about 10pm...the line

stretched</B>
<P><B>almost the entire block.  While the prison walls are high and</B>
<P><B>foreboding-looking, I didn't feel threatened or get any sense outside</B>
<P><B>the walls.  We got a little nervous when we were forced by the City

of</B>
<P><B>Philadelphia to sign a waiver release and wear hard hats -- the

prison</B>
<P><B>is in severe disrepair.  The roof is caving in in spots and the lead</B>
<P><B>paint is peeling.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Once inside the prison walls, the prison itself is in the shape of
a</B>
<P><B>spoked wheel: the middle hub is the where the prison guards collected</B>
<P><B>and each "spoke" was lined with prison cells.  We were led around the</B>
<P><B>outside of the spokes and into the spoke that housed the solitary</B>
<P><B>confinement cells.  All of the doors and locks had been removed from</B>
<P><B>each cell and the doors to the cells were only about 3 feel tall. 

The</B>
<P><B>cells were pitch black and there was only a dim light in the

corridor.</B>
<P><B>We were explicitly told no one was allowed to go into any of the

cells.</B>
<P><B>I didn't really get a feel for any presence, but I felt an

overwhelming</B>
<P><B>sense of sadness.  After we left that particular spoke, the feeling

went</B>
<P><B>away and the rest of the tour was uneventful (aside from the

"ghostly"</B>
<P><B>spooks popping out at us from various spots in the building).  I felt</B>
<P><B>completely comfortable.</B>
<P>
<P><B>After the actual ghost tour is over, you are invited to go back into

the</B>
<P><B>prison into a few rooms that had been set up as a sort of museum of</B>
<P><B>sorts.  I'm not sure if the rooms had been cells or what.  There were</B>
<P><B>pictures and articles about the prison and a collection of knives and</B>
<P><B>zip guns confiscated from prisoners over the years, among other

things.</B>
<P><B>I was walking through a doorway from one room to the other when I</B>
<P><B>actually felt as if someone put their hands on my chest and pushed.
 I</B>
<P><B>actually had to take a step back to keep from tripping backwards, and</B>
<P><B>then whatever it was actually went through me.  It knocked the wind

out</B>
<P><B>of me!  There was no one near me and it wasn't windy, so I am going

to</B>
<P><B>assume that I came in contact with some spirit.  Luckily, it didn't

seem</B>
<P><B>malevolent......it was just there.</B>

<H3><A NAME=lee>Lee Hall</A>
</H3><P><B>by sharus@sprynet.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I've read better stories than the one I'm going to recount here.  In
fact, the actual story of what happened to me often falls on deaf ears. 
It's fairly anti-climatic in the telling.  Scared the hell out of me, though,
and my good friend Jim.  I guess that's what counts.  My first summer after
my freshman year in college, I began working at a place in Black Mountain,
North Carolina, called Blue Ridge Assembly.  The most prominent feature of
the place is a building called Lee Hall.  It's a mammoth building. Five stories

including the basement and attic, full of rooms that have been used as a

dormitory of sorts since it's foundation.  it was built, I believe around
the turn of the century.  I believe the date was 1912.  it was built entirely

from the timber gathered off the mountain there, and has served many different

purposes.  It's current function is housing people who book the mountain
for conferences and retreats.</B>
<P><B>  </B>
<P><B>Anyway, I do regress.   It's a hard building to miss.  It's just plain

"spooky" as any old building can be.  Especially one of its size with very
long hallways.  My second summer there, I was working in housekeeping.  the

office was on the second floor.  Actually, the 3rd, if you count the basement.
 It was the end of the summer, and the staff was finishing up final cleaning
to shut many buildings down for the winter, including Lee Hall.  It was dark,
and everyone was pulling together to finish the job so we could have a few
days rest before returning to college.  My friend Jim and I were sent down
to Lee Hall, which I had personally locked up for the day, for more supplies.
 We approached the back stairs which was the easiest way to reach the

housekeeping supplies, joking about how spooky the whole thing was.  As we

climbed the stairs, we both grew silent.  later, we both told each other
that we knew something strange was happening.  Above us was a huge metal
door that led into the main hallway of the second floor.  We got halfway
up the stairs, and the door slowly swung open revealing the gaping hallway,
lit only by the exit sign. Nobody stood there.  If someone had pushed it
open and run, we would have heard them running across the floorboards, but
they couldn't have, because it had been my responsibility to lock the place
up for the night, and I'm sure I did just that.  Jim and I both felt a terror
far beyond that of seeing a door open strangely.  I really felt like it was
an invitation.  Does that make sense?  An invitation to something I didn't
want.  We fled, screaming and cursing.  the terror we felt was beyond that
of just seeing a door open strangely.  </B>
<P><B>  </B>
<P><B>We returned shortly with several people and searched the building.
 No one was there.  Jim's story continues from there.  he stayed the winter
and had a lot of strange things happen.</B>

had moved us to Indiana, to a small town outside of Indianapolis. The house
was an old Victorian house, that had no square rooms. I knew from the moment
we walked up the stairs that the bathroom at the end of the hall was not
a place I had wanted to go into. Even our dogs wouldn't go in there. My parents

couldn't understand why all of us kids refuse to take our baths upstairs.
They didn't believe that the window would open and close by itself. They
didn't believe that everytime you go in, the door would shut all by itself.

 Luckily for us, we moved right after a couple of months.  My second visitor

didn't show up until after I had gotten married, and we had moved into a
small house in Kansas. We had a basement that had our washer and dyer in
the corner. I had a small table that I keeped my cleaning stuff on, which
I had just cleaned the day before. All of my children were in school, and
I would be downstairs. I would hear children running and laughing upstairs.
When I went to go check, no one was there. I went down stairs and on the
table was a ladies pinky ring. I knew that it wasn't there earlier. I had
asked the children and my husband if they knew where it had come from. No
one knew. In my heart, I knew the ring was for me, I have worn this ring
for almost 8 years now. Things would disappear and reappear, and we would
just blame it on our "Ghost".  I have known for along time that I have the

ability to "find " ghost. The third experience was when my husband was deployed

in Desert Storm. The children and I had just gotten home, to Indiana, to
my parents house. I had just put my daughter down for a nap and had been
asleep for just alittle while, when I felt as if I was being watched. I sat
up, and I saw my grandfather, who had died right before our daughter was
born, the year before. He walked over to her crib and then he looked at me,
and he said "Everything is going to be fine, Don't worry he'll come home".
 I had notice that the room had a smell that I had associated with my

grandfather.  Within 6 months, my husband did come home safely.  My last

experience happened when we got stationed over seas to Germany. We had spent

three years there, and were getting ready to move back to the states. I was

cleaning out a closet, and all of the sudden, I was engulfed in the aroma
of roses. I had called to my husband, who was in the other room. He laughed,

because he thought I had broken a bottle of perfume. The only thing is, I
had no perfume in my bedroom or in my closet. A neighbor who lived downstairs,

came up, she too smelled the roses. She believed that I was visited by what
the Haitians called "The Lady". I am not afraid of my visitors. I only wish
that they would stop playing jokes on us, and return the items that they
like to "borrow".</B>

<P>
<P><B>My  experience is not unusual in any way.  It began when my</B>
<P><B>childrens father comitted sucide back in October the 29 of 1993.  I

was</B>
<P><B>3 months pregnant with our little girl, our little boy was 9 months</B>
<P><B>old.  It was really a terrible time in mine and his families life.
</B>
<P><B>About three weeks after we had buried him, I was visting his mother

and</B>
<P><B>it was getting late when I got home.  My mother was watching my son,

and</B>
<P><B>I got no more than in my living room when he was standing there right

in</B>
<P><B>front of me and said, "Where have you been?"  I started screaming,
my</B>
<P><B>mother runs in and asks whats wrong.  I told her and she said I was</B>
<P><B>dreaming.  Not when I am wide awake.  You have to believe me, for what

I</B>
<P><B>have told you is true.  There has always been something like that

happen</B>
<P><B>to me, as far as I could remember.  I wish I knew if I wasn't the

only</B>
<P><B>one to see things.  One more example of the stuff that happens to me.

</B>
<P><B>When I was  pregnant with my son, I was laying down on my bed on my

back</B>
<P><B>when all of the sudden I felt little hands moving across my stomach,</B>
<P><B>they were like that of a small child.  That really scared me, I had

my</B>
<P><B>eyes shut, I was praying for it to stop.  When all of the sudden it</B>
<P><B>crawled on top of me and laid there for a couple of minutes, I felt

its</B>
<P><B>weight like it was real.  Then it rolled off me and crawled in bed</B>
<P><B>beside me.  I laid there for at least 10 minutes trying to get

 courage</B>
<P><B>to open my eyes.  When I finally did there was nothing there.  I ran

out</B>
<P><B>of that room screaming.  Eveyone looks at me like I am crazy when I

tell</B>
<P><B>them that,  but it is true I swear to it.</B>

</H3><P><B>by longo@win.bright.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>It all started when I was about 10 or eleven.  This story is very true,

by</B>
<P><B>the way.  We had moved into a new house in north-eastern Wisconsin.
 Let me</B>
<P><B>explain where my room was.  There was a porch, and then the door into

our</B>
<P><B>house.  To the left was the kitchen, to the right was the laundry room,

and</B>
<P><B>if you were to go straight when you entered the door, there was a

stair</B>
<P><B>case.  It lead to the attic, were my room was.  The stair case was
not very</B>
<P><B>long at all, 12 steps to be exact.  When you went into the attic, there

was</B>
<P><B>a bathroom if you went straight, my room if you turned left, and to

the</B>
<P><B>right was a living room with a T.V.  </B>
<P><B>	One night while I was lying in bed trying to sleep, I heard creeking

up</B>
<P><B>the steps.  I thought it was my cat or one of the dogs, so I wasn't

scared.</B>
<P><B> I counted the number of steps I heard.  There was twelve.  I noticed

it</B>
<P><B>sounded like a person coming up, I remembered every creak the steps
made. </B>
<P><B>I looked at the staircase which I could see from where my bed was.
 I</B>
<P><B>notices some sort of dim light from the top step.  The lights in the</B>
<P><B>kitchen were off, and so was the upstairs light.  I hid under the

blankets,</B>
<P><B>hoping for it to go away.  I listened closely, and heard 12 steps

going</B>
<P><B>down the stairs.  Every night from then on, I heard the steps.  One

night,</B>
<P><B>after I heard the steps going down the stairs, I got out of bed and

looked</B>
<P><B>at the bottom of the stair case.  It was very dark, but I thought I

could</B>
<P><B>see a crumpled figure on the linoleum. </B>
<P><B>	 Three years later, we moved into a new house in Indiana.  One night

my</B>
<P><B>mother told me that a little boy had died in the house in Wisconsin

because</B>
<P><B>he fell down stairs.  She didn't want to tell me when we livd there

because</B>
<P><B>it might frighten me.  to this day, I am still very haunted by that</B>
<P><B>experience.</B>

<P><B>My friend Christy is engaged to this guy named Sean.  Sean has lived

for</B>
<P><B>most of his life at his parents' house in Cincinnati, Ohio.  Sean's</B>
<P><B>house is very old and just happens to be in a development that is</B>
<P><B>situated over an old Indian burial ground.</B>
<P>
<P><B>For as long as Sean can remember, there has been a ghost in the

house.</B>
<P><B>It imitates the voices of people who live in the house.  There are

many</B>
<P><B>instances of Sean or his sisters being alone in the house and hearing</B>
<P><B>one their parents begging for help downstairs, only to go to the

parents</B>
<P><B>aid and discover that parent is not in the house.  Sean even recorded

it</B>
<P><B>once while he was recording himself playing drums.  In addition,

there</B>
<P><B>is a spirit that follows them and visitors around the house...it is
a</B>
<P><B>tall dark figure wearing a hooded cloak.  It has never harmed anyone,</B>
<P><B>merely made them feel uncomfortable.</B>
<P>
<P><B>About a year ago, Christy made a trip out to Cincinnati to meet

Sean's</B>
<P><B>parents for the first time.  He didn't tell her about the house

because</B>
<P><B>he didn't want to spook her.  Sean's parents invited her to stay in

the</B>
<P><B>guest room and Christy accepted.  The first night of the visit,

Christy</B>
<P><B>was sound asleep when she woke up suddenly and felt something icy

slide</B>
<P><B>over her and felt like something was watching her.  She got spooked,

and</B>
<P><B>went over to Sean's room and slide into bed with him and stayed there</B>
<P><B>the rest of the night.  Sean didn't tell her at the time, but the

hooded</B>
<P><B>figure followed her into the room.  The same thing happened the next</B>
<P><B>night and Sean finally told her.  She refused to stay in the house</B>
<P><B>another night.</B>

<P><B>I have been in the house two times, but I haven't experienced the

<P><B>actually have to ask for them back and the item reappears only after</B>
<P><B>pleading with the ghost. My friend says her sister placed the glasses

in</B>
<P><B>the kitchen after coming home from work. When she went to get them,

they</B>
<P><B>were gone. They later reappeared, after asking the ghost to return

them,</B>

<P>
<P><B>She says he also takes plates from the kitchen and hides them and

they</B>
<P><B>later find them in the laundry room or somewhere else in the house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>She thinks someone was killed there many years ago because of a large</B>

My cousin,</B>
<P><B>who was with us at the time, decided he wanted to go down stairs to
the arcade.</B>
<P><B>The arcade was located in the basement of the hotel we were staying
at. The </B>
<P><B>hotel was built in the 1800's and had been the site for many different
killings (which I didn't know untill I did my own research on the place).
Anyway,  when we got down to the arcade room and started playing, we noticed
that we were the only</B>
<P><B>people in the basement at that time. When we ran out of money, we went
back up the stairs that we came down. As we were turning the corner to  go
back up, we noticed a very tall woman in some type of gown standing at the
top of the stairs.</B>
<P><B>By the time we got to the top she was gone. We asked the workers in
the lobby</B>

<H3><A NAME=woods>The Indians in the Woods</A>
</H3><P><B>by longo@win.bright.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is a ghost story my grandma and grampa told me.  My grampa likes
to</B>
<P><B>joke, but my grandma wouldn't lie to me, and I, also, have experienced
what</B>
<P><B>I will tell you in this story, so it is very true.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	Let me explain where this story takes place, perhaps it will clarify</B>
<P><B>things better.  We live next to Amacoy Lake, a lake in Bruce WI.  It
is in</B>
<P><B>the north-eastern region of WI.  Where my granbdparents live is a
very</B>
<P><B>undeveloped area of land, very close to the lake.</B>
<P><B>	One day I asked my grandma if she has ever seen ghosts (this was when
I</B>
<P><B>was about 11).  She told me one night in mid-fall, she and grampa
were</B>
<P><B>sitting out on the deck.  They noticed sounds that sounded like
Indians</B>
<P><B>wailing.  They looked in the window to see if the noises were coming
from</B>
<P><B>the television.  They weren't.   They noticed lights (such as torches
or</B>
<P><B>fires) coming from the woods by the house.  They thought it was an</B>
<P><B>interesting experience.  They told me they weren't afraid, because
ghosts</B>
<P><B>can't hurt you.  Next spring, my gramma took me out to the woods where
the</B>
<P><B>lights were seen.  We saw some mounds that were probably Indian
burial</B>
<P><B>grounds (maybe not).  The man who had previously lived in that area,
about</B>
<P><B>in the 1920's-40's, used that are of woods as a junk yard.  I remember
from</B>
<P><B>a very young age when we used to live by my gramma, my dad bringing
me down</B>
<P><B>to the woods.  There was a steep hill and a little creek that ran
into</B>
<P><B>Amacoy.  We used to go and sit in an old truck from the 30's.</B>
<P><B>	Anyways, there was lots of old bottles and cans in the woods, so
gramma</B>
<P><B>and I did an experiment.  We found an old glass bottle, it was kind
of</B>
<P><B>square past the neck.  We set it on a stump right in front of the woods.
</B>
<P><B>Gramma and I were the only ones who knew about the bottle, and we had
been</B>
<P><B>cooking in the kitchen.  I decided to go and see if anything had
happened</B>
<P><B>to the bottle.  When I looked at it, there was a perfect black feather
in</B>
<P><B>it.  I left it inside the bottle.</B>
<P><B>	The next day I came back to gramma's.  I went and looked at the
bottle</B>
<P><B>again.  It was standing on it's neck.  I picked it up and tried to
stand it</B>
<P><B>on it's neck again, but it wouldn't balance.  These are the only</B>
<P><B>experiences I've had with the indians, except one time while I was
in my</B>
<P><B>grampa's workshop, I heard them.  </B>

<P>
<P><B>This is less of a haunting, and more of a notice that a friend is not</B>
<P><B>completely gone from me.</B>
<P><B>Back in May of '97, my husband's (then my fiance) mother died. In April
of</B>
<P><B>that year, on his birthday she had an artery bi-pass surgery of her
leg.</B>
<P><B>Unfortunately, soon after she came home, the site at top of her leg
where the</B>
<P><B>graft started, opened up and bled. That time, she survived. The wound
wouldn't</B>
<P><B>heal, and it had gotten infected. In May, it hemorraged again. This
time, it</B>
<P><B>was so fast that in less than 5 minutes, she could not speak or respond
to my</B>
<P><B>husband next to her. The EMS got there just as I had gotten downstairs.
She</B>
<P><B>started to go into coronary arrest in the ambulance, in front of the
house. I</B>
<P><B>had to drive myself to the hospital. Not too long, we got the word
that she</B>
<P><B>had died.</B>
<P><B>Both of us were in shock. She was only 69. I thought it was so unfair.
I loved</B>
<P><B>her very much and had only known her for about a year. She was always
so good</B>
<P><B>to me, a very good friend and Mother-to-be-Inlaw. It just wasn't
fair.</B>
<P><B>Now, so you know... I am an aetheist. I have a very hard time when
loved ones</B>
<P><B>die, because I don't believe that I will see them again. But
everytime</B>
<P><B>something happens, I kind of look to God for solace. Somehow my faith
returns,</B>
<P><B>if only to get me thru a difficult time, to which I cannot control.</B>
<P><B>I prayed to her... Hoping she would hear me, if there is a place for
those who</B>
<P><B>have passed on. I asked her to give me a sign, if she was okay and
if there is</B>
<P><B>another "side". One night, I was alone in my bedroom. Since I am an
artist, I</B>
<P><B>thought that making the thank you notes for her funeral would be a
good</B>
<P><B>tribute to her memory. As I was sitting there, I said outloud: "Rose,
I'm</B>
<P><B>making your cards... What do you think of them?" At that moment, I
hear a</B>
<P><B>noise from the stairs that traveled into the room, to the wall next
to where I</B>
<P><B>sat. I didn't feel scared (I'm a scaredy cat by nature), just happy.
Then just</B>
<P><B>as the sound ended, a puff of cold gentle air hit my back. Okay, so
I had the</B>
<P><B>airconditioner on, and that is behind me to my right. So, I sat still
waiting</B>
<P><B>for yet another increase in air movement. Never happened. Now, this
house is</B>
<P><B>very creaky and noisy, but I have never before or since heard the
traveling</B>
<P><B>sound.</B>
<P><B>Well, I had to go to work the next week. While in the car, I asked
Rose to</B>
<P><B>once again give me a sign, that other one wasn't too convincing. I
had to be</B>
<P><B>sure. One of my husband's friends told us a hilarious story about the
first</B>
<P><B>time he met Rose. She was a short 2nd. Generation Italian-American.
She was</B>
<P><B>cooking dinner when he came over. He told us that he went to say hi
to her,</B>
<P><B>when she looked up at him with fish in both hands and said "SCHHHHMELTS?"
She</B>
<P><B>was basically asking if he wanted smelts for dinner. But the friend</B>
<P><B>exaggerated it in his telling. He told me about that while she was
still</B>
<P><B>alive. While in the car, I noticed that I had not turned on the radio
yet.</B>
<P><B>That is rare, it goes on right after the engine. I turned it on...
A D.J. said</B>
<P><B>SCHHHHMELTS exactly the way the friend did. Then everyone on the
station</B>
<P><B>laughed. I did not catch the ending of a word, it was the start and
finish.</B>
<P><B>They were indeed talking about smelts. That's an odd topic, especially
for a</B>
<P><B>top 40 radio station.</B>
<P><B>Now, I didn't convert... Tho' I do think more of her as being "alive"</B>
<P><B>somewhere else. What I don't understand is why this is only with her,
and not</B>
<P><B>with my grandmother who died the year before, or my husband's Father
who died</B>
<P><B>two weeks before our wedding. By the way, my wedding gown is cursed.
The day</B>
<P><B>before Rose died, I bought it and showed it to her. The day I tried
it on for</B>
<P><B>a fitting (After my bridal shower), Joe, my husbands Dad goes into
the</B>
<P><B>hospital - Never to come home again. The day of my husband's bachelor
party,</B>
<P><B>Joe dies in a nursing home, close to my final fitting. Not too long
after my</B>
<P><B>wedding, my dear seamstress who was battling cancer died. That was
the last</B>
<P><B>dress she worked on. I don't believe in curses, but this one takes
the cake!</B>
<P><B>Just so you know... I am hearing a number of bumps that normally don't
occur</B>
<P><B>here, so maybe I'll stop now. I'm starting to get freaked out.  </B>

</H3><P><B>by BATMAN9644@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hello, my name is Bill. I live in a small town in the south were strange
things are often seen and heard. I have a story that still puts chills all
over me everytime I tell it, and those chills are there now. My story starts
when I was five or six, and it involves me and my older brother. We have
two older brothers but this story only involved us to an extent. Here goes....
My older brother, Norman, was asked to take the scraps out one night after
supper. It was a normal routine for each of us, but on that night, it would
change his life forever. He walked outside to empty the scraps, and that's
when this whole thing began... When he got to the spot where we dump the
scraps, he noticed a pair of green eyes. He didn't pay much attention,
considering that we did have dogs and cats, so he continued. After he was
done, they were still there, but this time, they were looking up at him with
a squint to them. He started calling all of the dogs and cats names, and
none of them responded, and that really took him by surprise, especially
with it being time for them to eat. He noticed that the eyes was all he could
see, and he got scared at that point. As he took a closer look, this thing
smiled at him, and at that point, he threw the pot at it and ran back into
the house to tell us what had happened. We all laughed and went about our
business, but I could tell that he was telling the truth. That was the first,
but still not the last of Green Eyes. As the years went bye, things got worse
for him. This thing was taking over every part of my brothers life. It would
lock doors on him and wake him up in the middle of the night by breathing
heavy on his face. As the years went by, I started witnessing these things,
like the doors locking and unlocking, the tv turning on and off and changing
channels, lights going on and off, etc. One night, I couldn't sleep, so he
got on the top bunk with me and told me to go to sleep. It worked until I
woke up and looked at him, and his hair was moving like a fan was blowing
air in his face. I woke him up and told him what I saw and he just laughed
and said that it happens to him all the time. One part of this whole ordeal
that will always be in my mind happened when I was about 7. We were all out
playing and we made him mad, so he went to our eldest brothers room and went
to sleep. When it turned dark, we all went back in to watch tv. My mom, dad,
and the rest of us was watching a movie, when he called for me from the bedroom.
The tone of his voice let me know that he was scared, bad. He didn't scream
at me, it was more like he could barely get it out, you know, like it took
all of his effort just to say my name. I was about 30 feet from him, in the
living room, and the hall led straight to the room he was in. I was afraid
to even look down the hall, and the funny thing was, nobody heard him but
me. He asked me again to come in the room, and to hurry. I was scared, but
I proceeded down the hall. When I got close to the door opening, I was scared
to go on. He said, get in here, it is in front of the bed, I want you to
see it. At this point, I was frozen, and as I turned and looked through the
door, and cought the expression on his face, I screamed at the top of my
lungs. The whole family came down the hall, pushed me out of the way, and
by the time they got to him, he was in shock. I'll never forget it, his face
was blue from holding his breath, and my dad slapped him in the face to get
him to breathe again. Dad looked at us with pure terror in his eyes, he could
not believe that something could put this much fear in someone, and he held
him all night so that he could sleep knowing that he was ok. Things did get
worse, because soon, it all started happening to me. The only time that I
ever saw it was in my bedroom. It had large green eyes, and they were squinted.
At one point, it would call out your name, when you were alone, even in the
daylight. A few years later, he got married and moved into a trailer about
50 yards away. At this point in time he was moving out of  his bedroom which
was a few years old from an addition. I wanted a new room, but his was one
that I really didn't want to be in at all because of the things that were
heard and seen by him in there. I did move into it in time. When he moved
out, things were fine for about six months for him, the only reason was that
this thing turned its intentions on me, and I knew that I was in trouble.
The same things that he was hearing, I started hearing. My name was called,
lights turned on and off, the tv would turn on and off, even when other people
was in the room with me. I would have friends over and they wouldn't even
know of the occurences and they would wake me up in terror and ask me about
all of these things and I would tell them the story. Many of our family members
experienced these things. Soon, it turned it's sights back on him and this
time it was stronger. It would actually wake him up and be on top of him.
At one point, it told him that it was back, and that it was stronger and
that this was it's house and for him to leave. A few years later, enough
was enough. They asked a priest to come and bless the house, and he agreed
to do so. I remember that day well, because at that point, I had gotten married
and had a son, and I lived close to him. He had two kids of his own, which
would at times play with a friend that was not there. So he summoned the
priest. I stayed at home that day, just to see what would happen. I did not
go in, instead, I stayed outside. After they came out, the priest said another
prayer and left quickly. Then my brother told me what had happened. The priest
had just made it through the door, when he turned to my brother and his wife
and said, " Do you feel that?". My brother was scared, although he had lived
with this for several years. To see the Priests face turn pale, was overwhelming
for him. When they got to the kitchen, the priest stopped, and told them
not to move because it was in the room with them. The priest started sweating
and praying and told my brother, this is not a spirit, it is the devil himself.
He fought with this thing, spiritually, and the room got very cold, and that's
when the priest said that it was running to the back room. They all ran to
the back room, where the priest cornered it in the left side of the closet.
After this was all done, he spoke with my brother and told him that he could
not guarantee that the spirit would not come back, but he did say that if
it did, it would be twice as bad. Things were fine for about a year, then
out of the blue, it was back.Once he was working on the water line under
the sink in the kitchen when something started rubbing his back. He thought
nothing of it and kept on working. It started again and he thought that it
was his wife, so he turned around, and nothing was there, and at that point,
he knew that it was back. He ran, and yelled for his wife and found her in
the bathroom where she said that she was for about 45 minuts. She didn't
hear him screaming until he opened the door. On one occasion, he saw a little
girl run through the living room,and vanish into the bedroom, not to be found.
If I told you of all of the occurences over the years, It would be book length,
but I may add to this story from time to time because he's probably being
bothered as we speak. The last time that he said it bothered him was about
a month ago when he was sitting at the table with his wife. They were talking,
and a glass from on top of the refrigerator was lifted and floated across
the room, within inches of them, and placed on the floor in front of the
door. They just looked at each other and said " Did you see that?" They have
become used to these things happening, and friend and family also experience
things while being in their house. Over the years, he has shown me bruises
on his arms, throat and legs, where it has grabbed him, and one night it
picked him up by the ankles and dangled him over his wife until she woke
up and he fell on top of her. After all of these years of evil that he has
seen, it has slowly taken over his life, although he refuses to believe that.
For the past few years, he has turned evil himself, disowning his family,
picking fights over nothing, and lashing out at everyone over simple things.
I love my brother, and I know that this thing has a hold on him and is taking
control. Well, that's the end for now, but rest assured I will tell you more
because I know that this thing is not going away. There are several things
left out of this story because It is quite long anyways, but If you want
to know more, please E-mail me. For all of you out there who are laughed
at when you tell your story, just remember that there are people out there
just like you and me who know the truth and the truth is that there is something
else out there, there are things that can't be explained, and people like
us that see and hear things all the time. We are not crazy, we have just
been chosen to see and hear these things to let people know that they are
there, and that they are not going away anytime soon.......</B>

<H3><A NAME=marci>Marci</A>
</H3><P><B>by james028@ameritech.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>In 1992, my daughter (who was pregnant), her boyfriend and their
3-year</B>
<P><B>old daughter moved into a beautiful old apartment house in town.  The</B>
<P><B>house was one of the first built in the early 1800's in that area.
 It</B>
<P><B>had once been a luxurious private home, a private children's boarding</B>
<P><B>school and last converted to an apartment house with 12 units. 
Inside</B>
<P><B>the apartment, walls had been plastered over where open staircases
had</B>
<P><B>once gone upstairs and to the basement.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Things went well there for the family until shortly after the birth
of</B>
<P><B>the new baby.  One night Theresa, Erika (3-year old), the baby and</B>
<P><B>Theresa's friend Karen were at the apartment watching TV and talking.
</B>
<P><B>The baby was in the bedroom asleep and Erika sat on the floor in
front</B>
<P><B>of the TV.  The girls heard the baby let out a terrible scream as if
she</B>
<P><B>were in pain and they both ran to the bedroom.  When they picked up
the</B>
<P><B>baby she had a bite marked on her cheek the size of a small child's</B>
<P><B>mouth.  They checked the closet, the kitchen and the doors were all</B>
<P><B>locked. Later the bite marked turned black and blue (I saw this with
my</B>
<P><B>own eyes).  We knew that no matter what Erika could not have done
this</B>
<P><B>for she was missing her top two teeth and the marks showed a full
set.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Within a few days Erika seemed to have made the aquaintance of an</B>
<P><B>imaginery friend.  She would play for hours in the bedroom, talking
and</B>
<P><B>singing and sometimes arguing over toys with her friend.  Her mommy</B>
<P><B>asked her who her friend was and she said "Marci".  We all thought
it</B>
<P><B>was cute until.....Marci didn't like to share toys and she would pull</B>
<P><B>out clumps of Erika's hair.  This would happen as her mommy watched.
</B>
<P><B>Erika would be arguing over toys, saying "No, you can't have it" when</B>
<P><B>all of a sudden she would scream and put her hand on her head.
 Theresa</B>
<P><B>would look and big clumps of her hair would have been pulled out. 
</B>
<P>
<P><B>This became very eerie, Marci would play with toys and books, I mean
to</B>
<P><B>say throw them at people and move them from one end of the room to
the</B>
<P><B>other while many people watched.  It also seems that Marci had a
little</B>
<P><B>brother with her.  The only time the apparitions were seen was by T's</B>
<P><B>boyfriend who absolutely did not believe in ghosts.  One night he was</B>
<P><B>watching tv while he laid on the couch, he looked at the hallway and
saw</B>
<P><B>a little girl with long brown hair in braids and a dress with the
waist</B>
<P><B>about hip level (circa 1920's) and guess what,  her little brother
was</B>
<P><B>standing at her side. The next day he told T it was a dream she said</B>
<P><B>"okay then, what was on tv?"  He told her, we looked it up and sure</B>
<P><B>enough, he was not asleep.  That very day he said "There's no such
thing</B>
<P><B>as ghosts" as soon as this was out of his mouth he was viciously</B>
<P><B>scratched across his forearm while others in the room watched.  He
was</B>
<P><B>also the target of books and other items thrown at him constantly.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My older daughter and I questioned Erika about Marci.  We thought
maybe</B>
<P><B>she had heard that name somewhere and liked it, but that was not the</B>
<P><B>case, she'd had limited contact with other children except her cousin</B>
<P><B>who is a boy.  We asked her how old Marci was and she said "She used
to</B>
<P><B>be 6".  Then we asked her if Marci went to school, she said "She used
to</B>
<P><B>but she can't anymore" her tone was very sad.  It raised goosebumps
on</B>
<P><B>our arms.  We asked her whose house it was and she said "It's her</B>
<P><B>grandma's house" we asked about her parents and she said" They're
dead".</B>
<P><B>We told her to tell Marci and her brother to go find their mommy and</B>
<P><B>their daddy and she said "She can't find em". This whole questioning
was</B>
<P><B>in itself strange because Erika was not a very outspoken child and
was</B>
<P><B>never subject to imagination, not even a little.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One day T. was folding laundry and Erika came in crying her heart
out,</B>
<P><B>her mommy said "What's wrong?"  She said " Come quick, mommy, Marci's
in</B>
<P><B>the closet and she can't get out, please let her out she's crying"
 T.</B>
<P><B>went and looked and the closet door was closed, normally it was
always</B>
<P><B>ajar slightly (old house-latches didn't work well).  It seems T. had</B>
<P><B>used her rear end to push the door shut tight with her armful of
clothes</B>
<P><B>and had shut Marci in.  T. told her "sorry but Marci's going to have
to</B>
<P><B>stay there".  Things were really quiet until a few days later the
closet</B>
<P><B>was open and once again Marci was at her old stuff.  She pulled a</B>
<P><B>telephone cord while T. was talking to me until she almost fell out
of</B>
<P><B>the chair.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Theresa and her family moved out after several months of this, her</B>
<P><B>friends mother had contacted Unsolved Mysteries and they wanted to
come</B>
<P><B>out but she was not staying there.  She gave them her landlord's
number</B>
<P><B>(who was very interested in this by the way).</B>
<P>
<P><B>Also they experienced noises such as pots &amp; pans being washed
(clanging)</B>
<P><B>in the basement.  The basement was sealed off by the landlord.  It's</B>
<P><B>seems the boarding school's cafeteria was in the basement.  The other</B>
<P><B>apartments heard loud parties coming out of T's apartment late at
night</B>
<P><B>while they were in bed asleep.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have been told that I am somewhat psychic and I always felt these</B>
<P><B>children were in that closet when there was a fire and died together.
 I</B>
<P><B>also felt the year 1923 (hence the dress-sighting happened after I
came</B>
<P><B>up with the date) I also felt her full first name was Marcianna with
an</B>
<P><B>Italian last name. I also felt they were buried in the cemetary about
1</B>
<P><B>1/2 blocks from the house-We've been too chicken to check but we will</B>
<P><B>someday.  Well early this year this entire house was consumed by fire
no</B>
<P><B>cause was ever found and now there are 3 empty city lots where it
once</B>
<P><B>stood.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Very scary!!! Erika has not had an imaginary friend since.</B>
<P><B>If anyone would like to contact me they may.</B>

<H3><A NAME=girl>The Little Girl</A>
</H3><P><B>by Nikodi1@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>when i lived at my parents current house, my bedroom was in the attic.
 my mom often would sneak up the stairs and try to scare me with the good,
old "boo!".  well, one evening i was in bed reading when i heard someone
coming up the stairs..not wanting to let mom get the best of me, i told her
that i had heard her and to just come on up.  i looked up from my book to
see a little girl w/long blond hair peeking around the edge of the stairs.
 i figured that my eyes were playing tricks on me, and called again to my
mom.. but she wasnt on the stairs.  well, the next morning at breakfast i
told my parents my little story, and they were freaked.  i guess for almost
a week they had been hearing the voice of a little girl in the house and
didnt want to tell me. every so often i would still hear the stairs squeeking
as if there was someone on them and an occasional voice every so often, but
no one in the house has ever seen the little girl again.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>i feel stupid telling this story because i was inbetween 8-14 when
these things occured and i guess i could just have an over active imagination.
 well, anyways, when i was about 8 year old i first saw our lady in
white(different house than w/little girl).  i woke up one night and had the
urge to look over the side of my bed.  well, there she was, all in white,
except for where her eyes were.  i felt no fear and just layed back down.
 a few minutes later i looked again and she was still there, but laying with
her head at the opposite end of the bed..eg. her feet were now by my head.
 i laid back down, looked again she was gone.  every so often i'd see her,
as i got older i did start to get a little bit scared.  i have a feeling
that she was a sad spirit.  if you looked into our bathroom mirror you could
see out into the hallway and into my bedroom.  it got to where i wouldnt
look into the mirror w/the bathroom door open. believe it or not you could
actually see a woman, in white, fleeing the bedroom, looking like she was
crying...very upset.  we also had a little dog or cat, a small brownish black
blur that would run into the kitchen every so often.  we moved before my
15 birthday to the house that has the little girl. about three years ago
i got a job at city hall and looked up the histories on both houses.. i didnt
turn up anything on the little girl, but the house w/the woman was on market
for 4 years before my parents bought it and it had a few short term owners
before that. </B>
<P>
<P><B>now this next one is about my ticked off great grandfather.. never
met nor saw the man.  i guess when he died he asked to have a catholic
burial...well, his then wife went against his wishes and buried him w/out
a catholic blessing.  for 2 or 3 days he "showed up" at my grandma's house
(his daughter).  he kept say "why did you let her do it, irene"  i guess
a few of my aunts and an uncle might have saw this as well.  fed up w/her
father had a catholic priest bless his grave and she never saw him again.
  i've got a few more, but i'm at work and have to do just that.</B>

<H3><A NAME=old>Old Kelley House</A>
</H3><P><B>by rcald311@detnet.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I just sent you info on the Old Kelley</B>
<P><B>house in Houston,Tx. I used to rent there with 4 other people. It is
a 3</B>
<P><B>story, turn of the century house built by Mr. Kelley. He owned Kelley</B>
<P><B>Lumber company and used his lumber to build the house. The rent house
goes</B>
<P><B>for about $2,300 to $2,000 a month as of current.</B>
<P><B>It has a long history of hauntings that started right after Mrs.
Kelley</B>
<P><B>committed suicide. We found out about this info by accident which I
will</B>
<P><B>describe later. </B>
<P><B>I was the first to experience the haunting. I just moved in and had
a</B>
<P><B>friend over. The front window blinds at the entrance slammed shut and</B>
<P><B>closed by themselves. It scared my friend so bad ..he ran out of the
house</B>
<P><B>without saying goodbye! I shared the house with 4 other adults. Two
of</B>
<P><B>them,ladies, were amatuer mediums. Just local pychic fairs and
healing</B>
<P><B>centers was their occupation. We overlooked the house together before
we</B>
<P><B>rented. Upstairs in the masterbathroom is a set of old french windows
above</B>
<P><B>the sinks. It has a crank to open the windows. Two of us tried to open
it</B>
<P><B>but it was weathered and painted shut. We forced it and it would not
budge.</B>
<P>
<P><B>That year the hard freeze came early and our first evidence to share</B>
<P><B>together of the haunting became known. All five adults and two
children</B>
<P><B>were accounted for. Matt, one of the roommates came down from taking
a</B>
<P><B>shower and asked was there any reason for us having the other
bathroom</B>
<P><B>windows open. Sandy and I looked at each other with raised eyebrows
with</B>
<P><B>disbelief. We asked Matt again to be sure we heard him right. We</B>
<P><B>invistigated. Sure enough when we got to the top of the stairs you
can feel</B>
<P><B>the cold winds blowing. As we enter the bathroom..Sandy and I stood
shocked</B>
<P><B>to see the french windows fully opened. We debated the issue in our</B>
<P><B>heads...but there is no way Matt himself could open those french windows
by</B>
<P><B>himself...even if he was on steroids. I tried to reel in the window
using</B>
<P><B>the crank. It was rusty and hard to close..I had to use tools to shut
it.</B>
<P><B>That moment on we all knew we had a problem on our hands.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Few weeks later, Sandy wanted to use the house as a gathering of friends
to</B>
<P><B>share vegetarian meals. Her ambition expanded to the public. For
public</B>
<P><B>relations she wanted to write something about the house...but steered
away</B>
<P><B>from haunting stories. She struggled with different concepts. But
succumbed</B>
<P><B>to telling the story of a couple and their tragic love for each other.
The</B>
<P><B>story is about a recently engaged, mischief young lady that plays a</B>
<P><B>practical joke on her fiance at their engagement party. From the
upstairs</B>
<P><B>balcony she pours water on her beau down below. This enraged him and</B>
<P><B>scolded her with fever.</B>
<P><B>Shocked and dismayed she bursted out in tears and ran to the other
side of</B>
<P><B>the house to the porch on the second floor. Heart broken and drunken
with</B>
<P><B>wine with misery she hangs herself.</B>
<P>
<P><B>It wasn't until violent weather did the secrects come out. On October
13,</B>
<P><B>1993 a tornado paid us a visit.</B>
<P><B>It was all over the nation and CNN. It was unheard of a tornado
touching</B>
<P><B>down near a large downtown area...especially in Houston. The tornado
struct</B>
<P><B>our neighbors next door and apartment building across the street.
Because</B>
<P><B>of our national cover and Sandy's interview with news reporters being</B>
<P><B>broadcast over the nation...it prompted a old resident to pay us a
visit.</B>
<P><B>The Granddaughter of Mr. and Mrs. Kelley came by to see if we were
all</B>
<P><B>right and wanted to share pictures and story about the house. But we
wanted</B>
<P><B>to ask her questions too..without sounding like nuts.</B>
<P><B>We already had a couple of occurences of the hauntings since then.
We</B>
<P><B>decided to minipulate her in going upstairs to the upstair
masterbathroom.</B>
<P><B>There we unfolded to her the news about the house and it's little
gifts.</B>
<P><B>She hesitated on entering the bathroom..which raised question in our
minds.</B>
<P><B>We told her about the windows and suddenly she started to get very
nervous.</B>
<P><B>She finally told us the house was in fact haunted. It was in that very
room</B>
<P><B>she found her grandmother hanging from the ceiling. The room used to
be a</B>
<P><B>screened in porch overlooking her grandmother's garden. She was over
rotten</B>
<P><B>with pain in her knees so much so she couldn't garden anymore. It
crippled</B>
<P><B>her to where she was using a wheel chair and had a elevator installed.
She</B>
<P><B>couldn't take it no more..and took her life. Margaret one of the
other</B>
<P><B>roommates always complained about her knees. I started to have
problems</B>
<P><B>myself. She told us about their dog which is buried out back near the
pool.</B>
<P><B>The granddaughter heard scratching noises when she was a little girl
at the</B>
<P><B>back door. The dog had been dead for years. She would hear a cabinet
open</B>
<P><B>and shut when the scratching sound occured. Then the sounds would stop.
She</B>
<P><B>says of seeing a apparition of her grandmother in the garden was too
much</B>
<P><B>to bear and never stepped foot in the house again till that day.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I would be more than glad one day to show you the house. Many people
that</B>
<P><B>lived in the house had shared similiar stories and are still around
the</B>
<P><B>nieghborhood. Drop a word or two.</B>

<H3><A NAME=dad>My Dad's House</A>
</H3><P><B>by chsar@home.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>we moved to corpus christi in 1978. we bought a house that was</B>
<P><B>supposedly built around ww2. at the time it was my parents(divorced
but</B>
<P><B>still together) and us 3 younger sons. the house is pretty big, 4</B>
<P><B>bedrooms, 2 baths o a large lot. we didn't move in right away. we
looked</B>
<P><B>at the house first. it was eerie in that the detached garage had lots
of</B>
<P><B>animal horns and skulls nailed to the eaves of it. i supposed the
former</B>
<P><B>owners were hunters. the garage was immediately a place that made me</B>
<P><B>uneasy(to this day). the house itself was empty and clean except for
a</B>
<P><B>front room that was the only one carpeted and also had stuff that was</B>
<P><B>left behind, mostly old audio visual equipment. this room also made
me</B>
<P><B>uneasy immediately, even though it would be my room at one time. when
we</B>
<P><B>moved in the garage was cleaned out, there was stuff in there too,
junk</B>
<P><B>and an old freezer. and the animal skulls were gone too, except for
the</B>
<P><B>odd skull pieces found later in the yard. when we got there my mom
did</B>
<P><B>this old mexican wives tale thing of sprinkling salt around the house
to</B>
<P><B>be swept out later with any "bad" spirits, it never got swept out,
the</B>
<P><B>humidity melted it. anyway, we were in there for a time when i
started</B>
<P><B>to hear voices that sounded like 2 women whispering in conversation.
it</B>
<P><B>was always at night and when i would try to find the source it would</B>
<P><B>move to another part of the house. one night while trying to find the</B>
<P><B>source i ran into my mom who asked me what i was doing. i told her
of</B>
<P><B>the voices and she said she heard them too, but she thought they were</B>
<P><B>not going to hurt us. i accepted this and never heard them again. my
mom</B>
<P><B>left my dad again and then it was me and my 2 brothers and my dad in
the</B>
<P><B>house. since i was the only mature one, i kinda raised my other
brothers</B>
<P><B>and this meant being at home alone at various times of the day. like
i</B>
<P><B>said nothing ever seemed to stick out in my mind supernatural wise.</B>
<P><B>although the front room(with the carpet) and the garage always made
me</B>
<P><B>uncomfortable. I lived there from 1978to 1983 when i graduated from
high</B>
<P><B>school. i moved to cal. with my mom. eventually my brothers followed
me</B>
<P><B>here. before the last brother moved here my grandfather died. he was
my</B>
<P><B>dads dad and we never met him. he lived in the Philippines. my
brother</B>
<P><B>said that some weird things were happening in the house and that at
one</B>
<P><B>point my dad said it was our grandfather. my brother only said that</B>
<P><B>lights were going off and on by themselves. by the time summer came
the</B>
<P><B>last brother and in cal. and it was time for my annual texas vacation.
i</B>
<P><B>was thinking about what my brother said but was unprepared for what</B>
<P><B>happened that summer. my sister had moved to texas in 1980. this has</B>
<P><B>bearing later in my story. i got too the house and immediately felt</B>
<P><B>uneasy, i have been back every summer since leaving,this year was</B>
<P><B>1988,87? so its not like i was gone for a long time. the house seemed</B>
<P><B>abondoned and things started off quickly. the first morning there my
dad</B>
<P><B>woke me up to say he was going to work and to show me which keys to
use</B>
<P><B>for  house and cars. fine, off he went and into the bathroom i went.</B>
<P><B>when i came out(it was still dark) different sets of lights were
either</B>
<P><B>on or off(the kitchen lights were on and the bedroom lights were now</B>
<P><B>off)i quickly jumped into bed thinking i was imagining things. when
i</B>
<P><B>woke i grabbed the keys i needed and put them on the living room
coffee</B>
<P><B>table. i then took a shower and got ready for my day. when i went to</B>
<P><B>retrieve the keys they were gone!!!!! i nearly went insane looking
for</B>
<P><B>them tracing my steps over and over and even looking under the sofa</B>
<P><B>cushions. to no avail, i never found the keys.(my dad found them a</B>
<P><B>couple of years later, after he had cleared some blackberry bushes
in</B>
<P><B>the back year, the keys were above ground but in the thickest part,
have</B>
<P><B>you seen the thorns on blackberries? he blamed it on the dog(no the
dog</B>
<P><B>was not in the house and had no access inside and if he had put them
in</B>
<P><B>the bush he woulda had bad scratches i would think) after that and
the</B>
<P><B>lights i had my 6 year old nephew stay with me in the house where he</B>
<P><B>repeated stories of the lights and how my dad said it was "great</B>
<P><B>grandpa". the next day brought more lights going off and on mostly
when</B>
<P><B>you turned your head. that was it. i stayed with my sister until the</B>
<P><B>last night of my visit. i went back so my dad wouldn't feel bad that
i</B>
<P><B>didn't stay there. he knew that i was afraid. well i didn't sleep
well.</B>
<P><B>when i finally got to sleep i was rudely awakened by my dads truck
horn.</B>
<P><B>it was going off in the middle of the night!! i woke my dad up and
asked</B>
<P><B>if he had an alarm on the truck and he said no, we went out to the
truck</B>
<P><B>and it was locked and still blaring. we had to disconnect the
battery.</B>
<P><B>after that i hardly slept. the next morning we reconnected the
battery</B>
<P><B>and no horn. i flew home to cal. where for years i tried to figure
out</B>
<P><B>what went on that summer. no i have never been back to the house,
'cept</B>
<P><B>for a drive by. finally i asked the brother who was there last about
his</B>
<P><B>last days there and he told me one night he woke up to see three dark
or</B>
<P><B>black figures standing over his bed. he said he covered his head and</B>
<P><B>prayed that god help him. he woke up the next day and never spent the</B>
<P><B>night there again. but he went back last year and spent the night
there</B>
<P><B>and said nothing happened. but what happened to me i felt was not the</B>
<P><B>actions of the "talking women" but something as you put it evil and
not</B>
<P><B>ever human. but i felt it was aware of me. anyway since the talking</B>
<P><B>women spirits i feel if i concentrate i can sense "things" but that
time</B>
<P><B>has dulled my sense. i have lived in two distinctly haunted places</B>
<P><B>since, my current one the 2nd. but if this story is worthy to you i
will</B>
<P><B>tell you about the others(which were not as intense as my dads
house).</B>
<P><B>thanks for the space.</B>

<H3><A NAME=black>The Black Figure</A>
</H3><P><B>by skippybaby@yahoo.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>This story is a true story that happened to me! It is one of many and
I</B>
<P><B>mean MANY stories that happened to me that involve</B>
<P><B>                                              spirits!</B>
<P>
<P><B> It started one night, I was spending the night at my grandma's
house,</B>
<P><B>in the spare bedroom. She has 2 spare bedrooms, one is</B>
<P><B>  mine, and one is my older sister Tammy's. I used to sleep in my
room,</B>
<P><B>but after that incident that happened about a year ago</B>
<P><B> (no, no one died or anything, the room just went wacko from the</B>
<P><B>presence of a spirit when me and my friend Dannen were in</B>
<P><B>         it), I haven't gone in there since! So now I stay in my
sisters</B>
<P><B>room, since she doesn't visit as much as I do.</B>
<P>
<P><B>  I was lying down, looking at the white ceiling, like I always do
when</B>
<P><B>I can't sleep, and all of a sudden, I saw a black shadow</B>
<P><B> coming up from the bottom of my eyes! It slowly covered my whole</B>
<P><B>vision, and turned it black! It was holding my head down</B>
<P><B>  so I couldn't move! I got so scared, that I swung my hand at it!
And</B>
<P><B>it was just like swinging at smoke, it just separated, and</B>
<P><B>  then moved back together. Then, it formed into a hand and it curved
to</B>
<P><B>the left. Then it looked at me with glowing red eyes,</B>
<P><B>  and then flew away! The next time I met the black figure was when
I</B>
<P><B>was at home, I was having a sleep over with my friend</B>
<P><B>  Sarah in the basement. We were both on the pull-out-couch, across
the</B>
<P><B>room from the bar. She turned and looked over and</B>
<P><B> saw the black figure, staring at her, with glowing red eyes, leaning
up</B>
<P><B>against the bar, right in front of her bag. She slept facing</B>
<P><B> the other way for the rest of the night. Again, I had a sleepover
with</B>
<P><B>Sarah, in the basement. This time I saw it! It came through</B>
<P><B> the roof, right above me, with it's arms and legs strait out to its</B>
<P><B>side, as if it was in the shape of a star. When it popped through</B>
<P><B> the roof I could see some smoke come from around it's body. What is</B>
<P><B>this thing? Why is it following me? What does it want?</B>
<P><B> Will it hurt me? And then slowly, it lowered it's self down towards
me.</B>
<P><B>I was so frightened! I didn't want to tell Sarah, because</B>
<P><B> she might get scared, so I just pressed my head into the bed, trying
to</B>
<P><B>stay away! I was right in my sleeping bag, so I couldn't</B>
<P><B>  swat at it again. And then Sarah leaned over and asked, "what are
you</B>
<P><B>doing?" then I told her, "that thing is right above me!"</B>
<P><B>and she looked around me, and saw nothing. "There's nothing there</B>
<P><B>Tricia!" And I thought, how could she not see this? It's right</B>
<P><B>  there! How can she not see this? and then I said "it's right
here!!!</B>
<P><B>It's right above me!" She then tried to prove that there was</B>
<P><B>nothing there, and waved her hand over top of me. Just as she did
that,</B>
<P><B>the figure jumped up and spread it's arms and legs again</B>
<P><B>and just popped through the roof. That was the last time I saw that</B>
<P><B>figure. I have many other stories, most of them I am going to</B>
<P><B>   submit to this page. If you have any questions, or if you want to</B>
<P><B>talk to me about spirits, ghosts, or angels, e-mail me. I am</B>
<P><B>       constantly researching at the library and the net. If you want
to</B>
<P><B>talk to me or tell me your story, just e-mail me.</B>
