<P><B>My 1st haunted stay at the Jefferson Hotel (Jefferson, Texas)</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: anonymous</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>First of all, I would like to give you permission to put my true
life ghostly experience on your website for all to view.&nbsp; I, like
you, have an extreme interest in the research of ghosts and the paranormal
energies that surround us.&nbsp; I have always had a belief in ghosts,
but only had a few things happen to me in my life to confirm my belief.&nbsp;
My name is Daniel, you can post my name as being the author of my story.&nbsp; We reside in
San Antonio, Texas which has its share of the paranormal/ghostly world.&nbsp;
I do not wish my email address to be published on your website because
I do not want to acquire any spam.&nbsp; We are going back to the Jefferson
Hotel in about four weeks.&nbsp; I will be taking my Sony digital camcorder,
digital camera, and a good tape recorder with us this time to capture something
on tape.&nbsp; I feel that I will indeed come back this time with good
researched evidence of the spirits in this hotel.&nbsp; I have enjoyed
reading your website and of your explanations.&nbsp; I too have the same
perspective of ghosts and how they exist in our physical dimension world.&nbsp;
Here is my true ghostly story below:</B>
<BR><B>My story begins in that my belief was finally confirmed on a trip
that my wife and I took to the Jefferson Hotel in Jefferson, Texas in September
2003.&nbsp; This town is very unique and small and has a very historical
feel to it.&nbsp; Every building has a historical marker dating back to
the 1800's.&nbsp; The town has a sprawling history dating back to the 1800's
when steamboat travel was very popular off the Mississippi River in to
the bayou and one of the main means of transportation at the time.&nbsp;
The town also has the reputation of being one of the most haunted towns
in Texas and the United States.&nbsp; We really did not know anything about
Jefferson, but were told through an acquaintance that the hotel and town
had a haunted history.&nbsp; I really wanted to confirm my belief and acquire
good evidence of the paranormal spirit world.&nbsp; I have always believed
that ghosts are indeed spirits or entities of people who for some reason
have not passed to the other side.&nbsp; That they are stuck in limbo between
the physical dimension world that we live in our physical state and the
spiritual world that we pass on to.&nbsp; We traveled from San Antonio,
Texas to the Jefferson Hotel which is about a 440 mile trip.&nbsp; We arrived
on a Friday afternoon and planned on staying 3 days/nights.&nbsp; We had
booked 3 different rooms in the hotel that were rumored to be very haunted.&nbsp;
All of these rooms had recent paranormal activity in them.&nbsp; The hotel
was very plain looking from the outside, but the inside was very exquisite
due to the way they had decorated with many antique pieces of furniture
spread around the hotel.&nbsp; All the rooms are decorated differently
to where you feel you are in another hotel.&nbsp; The hotel has I believe
23 rooms that you can stay in, and about half of those are rumored to be
haunted by spirits.&nbsp; I had heard a story that a psychic had once ventured
into the hotel and said that there were seven spirits in the hotel.&nbsp;
For our first night, we stayed in room 6.&nbsp; The room was very quaint
and had a queen-size bed in it along with an antique tub that stood by
itself in the bathroom.&nbsp; At first nothing happened which dampened
my hopes, but then at 11:30 pm things started to happen.&nbsp; However,
they only happened to myself.&nbsp; We were lying in bed with the lights
off and the television on.&nbsp; The television was located on a dresser
at the foot of the bed facing us.&nbsp; I was lying on the side of the
bed closest to the one window in the room.&nbsp; There was enough distance
between the bed and wall for someone to walk.&nbsp; I had my exposed right
arm resting along my side and slightly off the side of the bed.&nbsp; Suddenly,
something began to pull the hairs on my arm.&nbsp; I felt an electrical
sensation such as that when you acquire static electricity.&nbsp; I looked
down in disbelief but I could not see anything.&nbsp; I then nudged my
wife and told her what was happening to me.&nbsp; She started to laugh
thinking that I was trying to scare her or something.&nbsp; Just then while
she was talking, I felt a small woman or girl's hand and fingers drag itself
all the way up my arm from the tip of my fingers to almost my shoulder.&nbsp;
It felt like a woman because it was a small hand.&nbsp; This really got
my attention.&nbsp; I then jumped out of bed telling my wife what had just
happened.&nbsp; She of course could not feel or see anything and thought
I was making up the whole situation.&nbsp; I then had the feeling that
someone was standing in the corner between the bed and wall staring at
us.&nbsp; I had the distinct feeling that the ghost was a woman or a girl
because it seemed to be small and unobtrusive.&nbsp; This lasted for about
five minutes and then it stopped with me no longer having the feeling that
the ghost was in the room with us.&nbsp; I remember it upset me that my
wife was not encountering anything.&nbsp; Nothing else happened that night
even though I had expected it to.&nbsp; The next morning we moved across
the hall to room 12 which had a very grandiose king-size poster bed in
it.&nbsp; The room also was quite larger than room 6.&nbsp; I really was
waiting for the opportunity for something to happen so that I could look
at researching it more.&nbsp; I have to admit that I had been slightly
alarmed from my experience in room 6.&nbsp; Well, nothing happened in room
12, but something did later happen that night in the hallway just outside.&nbsp;
I had become bored watching television with my wife and decided to go out
into the hallway around 1:00 am that night.&nbsp; I ended up sitting in
an antique couch that is at the end of the hallway pushed up against a
door that goes out onto the front balcony.&nbsp; The hotel was working
on the balcony and had locked the door and pushed the couch up against
it to block the door.&nbsp; The door had a glass pane that covered approximately
the top half of the door enabling a person to be able to stare outside
into the main street or the buildings across the street.&nbsp; Well, the
street was very dark and there was no activity at all in the street.&nbsp;
It was very quiet at the time.&nbsp; I kept hearing noises in the hallway
every time I looked down or away.&nbsp; It was strange that noises would
happen only if I was not directly staring down the hallway at the time.&nbsp;
The hotel is very long front to back and narrower in width.&nbsp; At one
point, I heard a noise down the hallway and looked down with nothing happening
or being seen.&nbsp; Then I heard a noise outside and looked to again see
nothing.&nbsp; I then heard the noise down the hallway again and turned
to look.&nbsp; When I did this, something then knocked on the glass behind
me with 3 taps suddenly.&nbsp; I admit that I jumped about 3 feet because
it startled me so badly.&nbsp; When I turned around to look, there was
nothing there.&nbsp; I walked back to the window in the door and looked
out again.&nbsp; Again, I did not see anything at all.&nbsp; I then went
to get my wife and told her to sit in the couch a few minutes to see if
anything would happen.&nbsp; Of course, she came back in after about 10
minutes and told me that nothing happened to her.&nbsp; This again was
very frustrating to me because I began to think that the spirits were only
trying to communicate with me.&nbsp; Nothing else happened that night and
we went to bed.&nbsp; The next day we moved into room 19 which is rumored
to be one of the most haunted rooms in the hotel.&nbsp; The maids were
in the hallway as I walked down to put our bags in the room.&nbsp; Room
19 sits on the upstairs hallway all the way to the rear on the left side
of the hallway.&nbsp; The maids began to tell me the story of room 19.&nbsp;
They said that a blond lady spirit haunts the room and that the bathroom
is haunted.&nbsp; When a person goes into the bathroom, you are supposed
to run the hot water in the bathtub and sink at the same time and then
close the door and turn out the light.&nbsp; The spirits are supposed to
turn off the water sometimes and you are supposed to be able to see words
in the mirror when you go back in and turn on the light.&nbsp; As the maids
were telling me this story in the hallway, a woman suddenly stepped out
of one of the rooms adjacent to room 19.&nbsp; This woman began to tell
me that her friend had stayed in room 19 the previous night and that they
had brought a Ouija board with them.&nbsp; She told me they had been trying
to summon the spirits of the hotel.&nbsp; They had asked the board if there
was a spirit that haunts the room and what the spirit's name was.&nbsp;
She said that the board told them that yes there was a spirit and the spirit's
name was Laura which it had spelled out.&nbsp; When the board had stopped,
the woman's friend had been lying on her stomach on the bed watching the
other two people on the floor do the board when something suddenly grabbed
her exposed legs from behind and pinned her down to the bed for a few seconds.&nbsp;
The woman had not been able to move and was terrified by this.&nbsp; Later
that night, the woman had grabbed her pillow and blanket and went downstairs
to spend the rest of the night with the desk clerk that was there all night.&nbsp;
Apparently, other things happened to the woman in the room to make her
want to do this from what the woman explained to me.&nbsp; This really
got my attention and I could not wait to conduct our research of room 19.&nbsp;
We also were the only guests in the hotel that night and the desk clerk
went home around 9:00 pm.&nbsp; My wife and I ended up doing the bathroom
thing right away.&nbsp; When we first went into the bathroom, there was
nothing in the mirror over the sink and the bathroom was very clean.&nbsp;
I then turned on the hot water in the tub and sink, turned off the light
and closed the door.&nbsp; Well, the water never quit running and after
about 3 or 4 minutes, I went back into the bathroom and turned on the light.&nbsp;
My eyes were in amazement at the words that had suddenly appeared in the
mirror.&nbsp; The mirror had been steamed up by the hot water, but the
words were very clear in a sort of film on the mirror.&nbsp; The words
read Help Judy Help and the word murder was written backwards in the mirror
on the bottom.&nbsp; At first I thought this was joke, and I had my wife
come in and smear the film on the mirror with her fingernails to where
it was literally smeared all over the mirror.&nbsp; I felt that if there
was some kind of chemical on the mirror that it would be smeared the next
time we did the experiment.&nbsp; Again, I went through the process and
again the water never shut off or anything while we waited.&nbsp; When
I went back in, I was truly amazed.&nbsp; The words appeared in the mirror
exactly as they had appeared before without any distortion at all.&nbsp;
This really freaked us out and I really had the feeling something paranormal
was taking place there in that room.&nbsp; We had decided to stay up late
into the night since we would be alone in the hotel that night.&nbsp; We
asked the desk clerk to unlock most of the rooms in the hotel so that we
could walk into any of them should we hear or see something.&nbsp; The
desk clerk did this and we followed around as she did it.&nbsp; When she
got to room 6, the room we stayed in on the first night, she put the master
key in the lock and unlocked the door.&nbsp; She then began to push on
the door and it would not open or budge.&nbsp; I was standing about 15
feet behind her watching her as she pushed on the door and got a scared
look on her face.&nbsp; She said "Oh no, not again"&nbsp; I then began
to walk towards her and ask what was wrong.&nbsp; When I got up to her,
the door suddenly opened.&nbsp; We all stared at the open door in disbelief.&nbsp;
I then walked into the room, but I saw nothing or felt anything out of
the normal.&nbsp; The desk clerk then left shortly after that.&nbsp; My
wife and I decided around 1 am to sit in a couch in the middle of the upstairs
hallway and wait for things to happen.&nbsp; Of course nothing did, since
we were sitting there prepared for anything.&nbsp; I then got up and decided
to go downstairs to the lobby.&nbsp; When I was in the lobby, I had the
distinct impression of being watched by more than one person and I kept
turning around to look expecting someone to be standing there.&nbsp; I
got this really weird feeling and I decided to go back upstairs.&nbsp;
When I got upstairs, I decided to go into room 14 which has a bed rumored
to be haunted in it.&nbsp; This is a queen-size bed with a ornate, sculptured
wood headboard that goes almost to the ceiling.&nbsp; The bed actually
is kind of spooky the more you looked at it.&nbsp; I did not turn on the
light when I went in because the hallway light was bright enough under
the door for me to see.&nbsp; When I got into the room, I immediately got
a chill from the room.&nbsp; Something then seemed to draw me to the bed.&nbsp;
For some reason, I went and sat down on the edge of the bed.&nbsp; Nothing
at first happened, but then the bed suddenly began going up and down as
if someone were pushing on the mattress underneath me.&nbsp; It felt like
the mattress were breathing as if a person were lying on the bed breathing
heavily.&nbsp; This really alarmed me because beds are not supposed to
do this per the realm of science.&nbsp; I asked that my wife come in the
room and sit on the bed.&nbsp; I remember my wife saying when she entered
the room how cold it was.&nbsp; She did lie down on the bed and said that
it really was cold on the bed, but she did not feel anything.&nbsp; She
did not lie there that long.&nbsp; We both went back outside in the hallway.&nbsp;
I had the feeling that spirits were around us watching us even though nothing
else happened that night.&nbsp; The next morning, I got up around 9 am
before my wife did.&nbsp; I ended up sitting in the rocking chair in the
room.&nbsp; I started to read a journal of other people's experiences in
the rooms of the hotel.&nbsp; The hotel lends this to patrons if you are
interested in seeing what other people have seen.&nbsp; I decided to do
the bathroom test one more time for old time's sake to see if anything
else would happen.&nbsp; I went in and did the same thing.&nbsp; At first
nothing happened, but then when I sat back in the rocking chair, I could
hear physically the water faucets turn off slowly on both the bathtub and
sink.&nbsp; I then waited to see if I could hear anything else.&nbsp; There
was this very eerie silence in the room except for the breathing of my
sleeping wife in bed.&nbsp; Suddenly, a woman's voice began to moan over
and over the words "oh" which sounded like a broken record repeating itself
over and over.&nbsp; This did not sound sexual either as some people may
think in reading this.&nbsp; It actually sounded very sad and it was not
very fast.&nbsp; This sound/voice was kind of loud but it did not wake
my wife.&nbsp; I was too startled at the time to wake my wife.&nbsp; My
curiosity was in trying to figure exactly where the sound was originating.&nbsp;
I looked around the room in all directions, and finally decided the noise
was coming from behind the window shade by the window.&nbsp; I walked over
and the noise did seem to get louder there.&nbsp; As I stood by the window,
the sound seemed to be coming from behind the shade between the shade and
the closed window.&nbsp; The sun was shining outside, but since we had
the shaded pulled down, the room was kind of dark and gloomy with only
one light on.&nbsp; I then reached for the shade and pulled it back.&nbsp;
When I did this, the sun then entered the room.&nbsp; As this happened,
the water faucets suddenly turned again and the water came back on in the
bathroom.&nbsp; The woman's voice also suddenly stopped.&nbsp; I then walked
over to the bathroom in disbelief at what had just happened.&nbsp; I looked
in the bathroom, and it was very cold in there with the same steamy words
in the mirror.&nbsp; I then went back to my wife and woke her up screaming
what had just happened.&nbsp; Again, she looked at me in shock and disbelief.&nbsp;
I was indeed very frustrated that I had not woke her up to hear what I
had heard.&nbsp; It definitely would have gotten her attention.&nbsp; About
a half hour later, we were getting our stuff together to leave.&nbsp; My
wife was in the bathroom and I was putting my contact lenses in using the
mirror in the room.&nbsp; I remember having all sorts of problems trying
to do this because something kept knocked the lens off my finger.&nbsp;
My wife screamed "look" and I turned around.&nbsp; The light was swinging
back and forth from the ceiling as if someone had grabbed it and swung
it.&nbsp; My wife was so happy that she had finally experienced something.&nbsp;
My wife had also asked the spirit earlier when we got into room 19, if
it would swing the light at some time to acknowledge its presence in the
room and that the female spirit knew we were there.&nbsp; The spirit had
answered our request.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Best Friend</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: settle_kitty@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was 7 my step dad gave me a dog and I named him blacky. He
was my best friend every night hed walk to my room to check on me to see
if I was alright. A year later he got ran over by a car and he died the
next day. For weeks I cried, I missed him so much. Then I got over him
the next year. In 2003 I woke up one night from a bad dream so I went to
grab a glass of water. When I went back to my bedroom door I saw a black
tail pass me and I freaked out. The next morning I told my mum. But she
didn't believe me. The next day my best friend came over and she has the
sixth sense. When she walked into my room she felt cold&nbsp; it was 37
degrees outside. That night I went to get water and I saw the tail again.
But then I remembered Blacky. So I thought maybe he's back to look after
me. Now every night I see blacky and I go straight to sleep because I know
he's here to protect me. Thank-you</B><B></B>

<P><B>STRANGE HAPPENINGS</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: Charlotte696@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>GROWING UP STRANGE STORIES OFTEN CIRCULATED IN OUR HOUSE. OFTEN THINGS
THAT MYSELF OR MY SIBLINGS DIDN’T DO GOT BLAMED ON THE FAMILY GHOST.</B>
<BR><B>WHEN I WAS 8 YEARS OLD THE FAMILY MOVED IN TO A OLD FARM HOUSE.
ONE NIGHT I REMEMBER LYING I&nbsp; BED LISTENING TO WHAT SOUNDED LIKE SOMEONE
WALKING AROUND IN THE LOFT ABOVE. THE FOOTSTEP'S SUDDENLY STOPPED AND WERE
THEN FOLLOWED BY A LOUD BANG THAT SOUNDED LIKE A CHAIR BEING KNOCKED OVER.
WHAT FOLLOWED NEXT CHILLED ME TO THE BONE. IT WAS A WARM SUMMER NIGHT AND
NO BREEZE COOLED ME IN BED.</B>
<BR><B>AFTER THE BANG I LAY IN SILENCE TO SCARED TO MOVE. THEN QUIETLY
OUT OF THE SILENCE A LOW CREAKING NOISE BEGAN. IT SOUNDED JUST LIKE A ROPE
RUBBING AGAINST THE OLD BEAMS IN THE ROOF. I DON’T REMEMBER FALLING ASLEEP
BUT IN THE MORNING I TOLD MY MOTHER ALL THAT I HAD HEARD. STOPPING ME HALF
WAY THROUGH SHE FINISHED MY STORY FOR ME. SHE HAD HEARD IT ALL TO. AT LEAST
I KNEW IT WASN’T MY IMAGINATION.</B>
<BR><B>IT WAS ABOUT A YEAR AFTER WE FIRST MOVED IN THAT MY ELDER BROTHER
INTRODUCED US TO HIS GIRLFRIEND. IT TURNED OUT THAT HER GRANDFATHER WAS
A DOCTOR BEFORE HE DIED. THE PEOPLE THAT LIVED IN THE HOUSE BEFORE THE
PEOPLE THAT WE BOUGHT OFF WERE HIS PATIENTS. THE PATIENTS IN QUESTION WERE
A FAMILY OF THREE. MOTHER, FATHER AND SON. THE SON HAVING LOST BOTH HIS
PARENTS TO ILLNESS IN ONE YEAR TOOK HIS OWN LIFE. HE HUNG HIMSELF. IN THE
LOFT. OTHER SUCH THINGS FOLLOWED AT THE FARM HOUSE. MY HAIR BRUSH WOULD
OFTEN DISAPPEAR ONLY TO REAPPEAR DAYS LATER IN THE PLANT POT IN THE HALL.
MY CD PLAYER WOULD OFTEN TURN ITSELF ON AND OFF AT THE PLUG SOCKET AND
MANY A TIME I’D LEAVE MY BEDROOM ONLY TO RETURN TO FIND MY WARDROBE (CLOSET)&nbsp;
DOORS OPEN. ON OTHER OCCASIONS I’D LEAVE THEM OPEN ONLY TO FIND THEM CLOSED
WHEN I RETURNED.</B>
<BR><B>ANOTHER NIGHT MY MOTHER WAS WOKEN IN HER SLEEP BY THE SOUND AS WHAT
SHE COULD ONLY DESCRIBE AS SOMEONE DROPPING PEBBLES AT THE SIDE OF HER
BED. TURNING ON THE LIGHT SHE SAW NOTHING BUT THE SOUND CONTINUED.</B>
<BR><B>ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO ME IN THAT HOUSE TOOK PLACE
IN THE STUDY. ONE DAY HELPING MY MUM WITH THE HOUSE WORK I WAS DUSTING
AWAY THROUGH THE MANY PHOTO FRAMES THAT ADORNED THE LEATHER DESK AND WINDOWSILLS.
TWO PHOTOS IN PARTICULAR WERE OF MY MOTHER AS A BABY AND HER SISTER ON
HER WEDDING DAY,</B>
<BR><B>BOTH OF WHICH HAD STOOD NEXT TO EACH OTHER ON&nbsp; ONE WINDOWSILL.
THE OTHER WINDOW</B>
<BR><B>WAS WHERE MY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GRANDDAD’ S ORNATE GOLD CLOCK
HAD PRIDE OF PLACE.</B>
<BR><B>HOWEVER, THERE IS SOMETHING I MUST TELL YOU ABOUT THIS CLOCK. FOR
MANY YEARS OR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER THE BACK OF THIS CLOCK WAS JAMMED.
PREVENTING US FROM WINDING IT UP. HAVING BEING TAKEN OFF AT SOME POINT
IT WASN’T PUT BACK RIGHT. MYSELF,BROTHERS, MOTHER AND FARTHER HAD ALL TRIED
AS HARD AS WE MIGHT TO PULL FREE THE JAMMED CLOCK BACK. WE EVEN TRIED PLIERS.
ON THIS DAY AS I SAID I WAS DUSTING. MOVING THE PHOTOS AROUND I THOUGHT
IT NICE TO MAYBE PUT MY GRANDDAD'S CLOCK ON THE SAME WINDOW CILL AS HIS
TWO DAUGHTERS. SITTING THEM TOGETHER IF YOU WILL. WHAT HAPPENED NEXT CAUSED
ME TO RUN FROM THE STUDY IN WHAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS AMAZEMENT, NOT
FEAR. AS SOON AS A PLACED THE CLOCK DOWN BETWEEN THE TWO PHOTOS THE BACK
FELL FREE. I LIKE TO THINK THAT IT WAS MY GRANDDAD JUST SAYING HI. ALTHOUGH
IT COULD HAVE BEEN SOMEONE ELSE. PERHAPS THE HAIRBRUSH HIDER?IT WASN’T
JUST AT THE FARM THAT STRANGE THINGS HAPPENED TO ME. ONE WEEKEND I WAS
AWAY WITH MY PARENTS STAYING IN WALES. OUR ACCOMMODATION WAS SUM WHAT HAUNGHTING
IN ITSELF. A GRAND 16 TH CENTURY FARM HOUSE. LOW BEAMED CEILING’S, LEADED
WINDOW’S, STONE FLOORS AND THICK WOODED DOORS FULL OF CRACKS BIG ENOUGH
TO</B>
<BR><B>PEEP THROUGH. LOOKING AT IT AS WE PULLED IN TO THE LONG DRIVE MY
FIRST THOUGHT WAS, “I BET IT HAUNGHTED”.LYING IN BED I WAS WATCHING THE
HALL LIGHT SHINE THROUGH MY SPLINTERED DOOR. TIREDNESS TOOK HOLD AND SO
I GOT UP TO TURN OF THE TV AROUND 1.00AM. RETURNING TO BED I WAS JUST NODDING
OF WHEN I WAS WOKEN BY MY TV BLARING AT LOUD</B>
<BR><B>VOLUME. TURNING ON THE LIGHT I STARTED MY HUNT FOR THE REMOTE THAT
I MUST HAVE ROLLED ON IN MY SLEEP AND CAUGHT THE ON BUTTON. THEN MY EYES
CAUGHT THE TV AND LYING ON TOP OF IT WAS THE REMOTE. FIRST THOUGHT WAS
TO CHECK IF I’D TURNED IF OFF PROPERLY. YES I HAD. ID PUSHED THE MAIN POWER
BUTTON. THE ONLY WAY IT COULD HAVE COME ON WAS BY PUSHING THAT POWER BUTTON
AGAIN AND LET ME TELL YOU IT WASN’T ME FINGER THAT DID IT.</B>
<BR><B>DASHING FROM THE ROOM I WAS MET WITH MY PARENTS BEDROOM DOOR. A
FEW LOUD KNOCKS LATER AND MY MUM WAS IN BED WITH ME FOR THE REST OF THAT
NIGHT. TELLING THE OWNERS LATER THAT MORNING ITS SAID THAT MANY OTHER PEOPLE
HAVE WITNESSED THE SAME THING HAPPEN. IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANY OF THEIR 9
GHOST’S, SHE SAID. THANKFULLY THAT WAS OUR LAST NIGHT THERE.</B>
<BR><B>IM NOT LUCKY ENOUGH TO SAY THAT I EVER SAW A GHOST BUT THERE WAS
ALWAYS A FEELING OF BEING WATCHED. I CAN’T EXPLAIN EITHER WHY IT WAS ONLY
MYSELF AND MY MOTHER THAT HEARD OR HAD THESE HAPPEN TO THEM. OVER TIME
THESE OCCURRENCE'S BECAME PART OF LIFE. SOMETHING I GOT USED TO. I NEVER
FELT THREATENED BY A PRESENCE. HOWEVER I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT MALE. BUT EVEN
STILL, UP UNTIL WE MOVED HOUSE WHEN I WAS 17 I COULD NEVER WALK DOWN THE
HALL IN THE DARK. THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING THERE, WAITING AND WATCHING.
NOW 22 AND LIVING IN OUR NEW HOUSE, NOTHING STRANGE HAS HAPPENED. HOWEVER
I LIKE TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND. MY DAD DOESN’T BELIEVE. HE THINKS THAT PEOPLE
THAT DO HAVE WEAK MINDS. I HOWEVER THINK ITS BECAUSE HE’S NEVER EXPERIENCED
ANYTHING</B>
<BR><B>LIKE I HAVE.</B>

<P><B>Sleep paralysis or Old hag.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: prayersandpromises@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I just read the article on Sleep paralysis.. I too use to sleep in
the</B>
<BR><B>supine position and found that I would have many bouts of sleep
paralysis...</B>
<BR><B>I have dealt with 3 different types.</B>
<BR><B>One was of the grim reaper coming into my room.&nbsp; I would hear
a chanting and</B>
<BR><B>he would show up shortly after it started.&nbsp; He was very intimidating
though</B>
<BR><B>he never entered into my room but would stand just out side taunting
me.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>found that thinking the Lords Prayer would get him to leave.</B>
<BR><B>Another one was I never figured out, cause I found myself floating
over my</B>
<BR><B>children and the dog one night when we all crashed in the living
room.&nbsp; If</B>
<BR><B>this was a hallucination, the dog was very spooked.&nbsp; I could
see him from</B>
<BR><B>where I was by the ceiling. Feeling a force pulling me into the
corner of</B>
<BR><B>the room.&nbsp; The dog looking up at me.&nbsp; When I finally found
myself back on</B>
<BR><B>the floor, the dog was so freaked out it would not come to me.&nbsp;
Once he</B>
<BR><B>realized I was ok, he came to me trembling and would not leave my
side.</B>
<BR><B>The other time this happened, I was sleeping on my stomach.&nbsp;
I could hear</B>
<BR><B>people walking around and speaking though I could not make out what
they</B>
<BR><B>were saying.&nbsp; It was very loud.&nbsp; I could not move my head
but from my</B>
<BR><B>position could see legs of who ever were around.&nbsp; I could hear
doors and</B>
<BR><B>cupboards slamming.&nbsp; I heard someone come up the stairs and
go to the</B>
<BR><B>bathroom.&nbsp; When I came out of this I was terrified.&nbsp; I
walked to the window</B>
<BR><B>in a surreal state.&nbsp; At that point my oldest daughter (19 years
old at the</B>
<BR><B>time) called up to me and asked me if it was all gone and if we
were awake.</B>
<BR><B>I told her I wasn't sure, she came up to talk to me.</B>
<BR><B>She had been the person who came up the stairs to go to the bathroom.&nbsp;
When</B>
<BR><B>she looked in on me she said she saw a child sitting by my head.&nbsp;
At first</B>
<BR><B>she thought it was her baby sister, but then the child was too big
to be her</B>
<BR><B>sister.&nbsp; So she thought it was her brother, but the child was
to little to</B>
<BR><B>be her brother.&nbsp; She could not make out who it was.&nbsp; Then
she noticed that</B>
<BR><B>she could not make out if this child was male or female, and finally
that</B>

<P><B>Sleepover</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sweet__strawberrie@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Jamie. It was late May, and I was at my friend, Anna's
birthday party. It was a sleepover. Around, 5 or 6 giggling girls showed
up for a night of pizza and movies. Although we were all excited and jumpy
from eating pizza and consuming vast amounts of pop and ice cream, I decided
I would turn in, as I was really tired, and they were watching a movie
I didn't enjoy much. They were all in the TV room, just down the hall and
to the right from where I had set my sleeping bag in the Family room. The
floor was hard, and I was uncormfortable, but I tried my best to drift
off. I was closest to the dining room, which was an extension to the family
room and ended in a dead end. I had stretched myself right&nbsp; in front
of the entrance, so there was no possible way anyone could get into or
out of the dining room without stepping over me. Also, once they had stepped
past me, there was no way out again, without stepping over me a second
time. I sat up for a moment, because I thought I had heard someone breathing.
I looked around the room, but it was empty. Across the hall, the basement
door was slightly ajar, and I heard my friends laughing and talking in
the TV room. I sighed and lay back down, finally able to close my eyes.
I awoke, only minutes later, to a thud in the room. It sounded as though
some one with heavy boots was deliberatly stomping on the floor towards
me. I assumed it was Anna, or one of the other girls, trying to scare me.
I heard them stomp to the edge of my sleeping bag, and step over me. Whoever
it was, they were clumsy, because they stepped on my arm and a few strands
of my hair, casuing my to wince in pain. I heard the boots stomp to the
corner of the Dead-end dining room, and stop. As I said before, there was
no way a person could go into the dining room, and then step back out without
having to walk over me. And judging by the person's boots, they would make
a lot of noise doing so. I opened my eyes, and was startled. No one was
in the dining room, behind the table or under the chairs. In fact, the
whole Living room area was empty and silent, except for my heavy breathing.
At that, I picked up my pillow and bolted towards the TV room where my
friends had fallen fast asleep, the movie credits rolling by, lighting
the room a faint blue. I lay down, far as I could from the hallway, and
after stealing a blanket from a sleeping Anna, fell asleep.</B>

<BR><B>Indonesia #2: West Sumatra</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: superrama_show@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This story is my father’s story happened about 40 years ago. He’s
not a big hero in this story, just one of the witnesses of maybe the most
shocking and clear appirition(do i spell it right?) that ever happened
in this world.</B>
<BR><B>The location is a village called SARIK in West Sumatra, Indonesia.
If you accidentally bump an Indonesian he/she might not know this valley
because of it’s remoteness. The village lay beside mount Barisan(in the
mount’s valley).. Sarik can only be reached after a couple hours of&nbsp;
a&nbsp; 4-wheel-drive-car ride if you don’t wish to walk a shorter pass-through
path through woods and rivers. Now, after most of the next-generation(including
my family) moved to Jakarta to seek for better life, this village, my home-land,
looks like a dead-village, only be lived-in if all the dwellers come home
together(pulang basamo’) in a wave from big cities in Indonesia.</B>
<BR><B>My father told me that appirition is not a very un-ussual things
that can be happened in this village. People are ready to be scared at
anytime. My father half jokingly said that i can meet my great-grand-parent
if i walk in the right time at the right street in the right night. He
said that some of the first generation of the villager sometimes appeared
like people who don’ know they’re dead yet, calling their families(ask
them to ‘sit and talk for a while’), who maybe came home too late, when
they pass a road in the night. So this great appirition had to be something
ussual for the villagers, right? Yep. But that time they didn’t just close
their eyes and walk faster while praying to God. Everybody were running
for their sake that night.</B>
<BR><B>The story started in a fine normal day. A villager(i forgot his
name) died that day. Normally die in a normal death. And that day, it rained
a normal rain. But, we got this person to be burried, my father said. So,
the villagers sat in the dead’s house waiting for the rain to stopped to
take their fellow vilager to his final resting place.</B>
<BR><B>Sadly eventhough it’s normal, the rain poured by God for a whole
day. For your information, muslims(Islam believers) are restricted to bury
a man after the sun sets. So, it’s must be done this afternoon or they
should go the next day.</B>
<BR><B>About 4 pm, the rain stopped, so the villagers went to the village
burial site. My father is one of the teenagers who carry the corps(the
palbearer). My father told me that the villagers were shocked when they
found the whole to bury the corps was full of water. So, some men were
appointed to took the water out. When the whole was almost empty, the rain
started to poured down again. And the whole was starting to once again
filled with water. The sun was almost finish it’s setting. So, the palbearers
were instructed to bury the corps in the half-full whole.</B>
<BR><B>Another fact that you need to know is, muslim don’t use a coffin.
We’re buried only with the accompanion of a couple of white sheets to cover
our body. And when the body is taken to the burial site, the fabric was
tied in three places: above the head, on the hips, and at the ankle. We
tie the body for two reasons: to keep the sheet attached to the body and
to maintain the body to a praying position(if you see an asian muslim prays.
The position when he prays in the first part o the prayer—standing—is the
position he will be buried. We will be buried with our arm on our belly
and feet close to each other. We will be lied like that on our right with
our body facing mecca).</B>
<BR><B>Back to the story, they take the body down on it’s right, facing
mecca. Some woods are used to keep this position. When the palbearers took
the wooden board, suddenly the body floated in the surface of the water.
Working in a rush, the palbearers must kept the body in the ‘position’
and also took the board. So, they use the feet. They took the body down
again with their feet and took the board with the hand. After the body
in the position, they got the board in place. Now, the body would stay
in position. The soil digged in again. Everything was settled, everyone
was happy. Not yet...</B>
<BR><B>Between the ‘positioning’ of the body and the ‘positioning of the
wood, there is one more ritual to do, untied the corps. They forgot this...</B>
<BR><B>Everyone went back home but soon got together again in langgar(little
mosque). One more ritual after burial. In mass, they read surra Yassin,
one of the surra/chapter from the Qur’an. The use is separated into two:
some say we read it so the dead’s condition in the cemetery will be full
of light, but the more modern muslim says it’s for the one whom left by
the dead, to give spiritual and psychological help to ease the pain. Everyone
were reading their own holy Qur’an.</B>
<BR><B>Then, one man stopped. Followed by the person next to him. They
were freaked out. The corps(oh, yeah. A body which is wrapped by the sheet
is called pocong. And some old stories is told about a ghost of this pocong
came back to life) was standing in the front of the room. “almost transparent”,
my dad said. The pocong stood there with the tie in the ‘three places’.
Everyone runned from the room. Except those old people who was to weak
to run and the langgar keeper. My father said that the keeper although
scared to death managed to stand in front of the ghost of the corpses.
“untied m I can’t rest easily with this rope.”, the ghost said, witnessed
by the villagers whose looking through the window. The mosque keeper said
yes, then the ghost disappear. Yes, almost forty people saw the ghost.</B>
<BR><B>In the next morning, the villagers went back to the cemetery and
open the whole again, untied the corps and nothing bothers the villagers
in the form of this pocong anymore.</B>
<BR><B>When i heard this story or re-telled it, the hair behind my back
are always raised. Like now. It’s a glad i’ve finished this story although
no one is in my house when i started. My parents are in the city beside
Jakarta to look one of the witness who will passed out soon(no relation
with this story).</B>
<BR><B>Conclusion: muslims don’t believed in ghost if people told it as
a spirit which come back to world to spoke what they wanted. The soul of
every dead are rest in peace after they die. We(my dad and I) believed
that that pocong was a geenie which we muslims(islam believer) called an
accompanion geenie. An accompanion geenie is a geenie which accompany each
human in this world. The geenie and the human gives effect to each other.
If one is so bad, than it’s company can be bad, vice versa. Because this
geenie is borned everytime a human is borned, they sometimes take a same
shape with the human it accompany. And sometimes it doesn’t realized that
they are different individual with the human before they die and some times
after the human’s death. So, if you see one of your family in your house
when they are supposed to be far from you, you are seeing your family’s
geenie. That’s what happened too after someone’s death. The geenie’re sometimes
felt lonely and go to the people it known. Like this case, the geenie knows
what happened to it’s company and want it’s friend(maybe it thinks themself)
to be free from the rope. Because a tied muslims are believed to be rest
un-easily.</B>

<P><B>The House BUilt on Indian Grounds</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jaidenroo@yahoo.ca</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I have a story that is a little long but very true.........When I
was younger I lived in this house that was built on sacred Indian grounds
and even had a Indian museum there, and when I went to bed at night I would
wake up very late to a cat jumping in bed with me, well we never had any
animals and I could never see the cat either but something always told
me it was a cat! it would cuddle up to me and I would get out of bed and
go to my parents room and sleep with them. Well another experience I had
was when I was playing in the basement and I looked up and I saw tons of
shadows dancing or running around the walls and I was very freaked out
I couldn't't move.</B>
<BR><B>My sister said on Christmas eve one year she had to sleep in my
room we had family sleeping over, and very late at night she woke up to
someone opening my bedroom door and she looked very fast and saw shadows
walking around and something told her to put the covers over her head,
she knew not to open them course what ever it was it wasen't good. My father
would also say just out of the blue a cloud of smoke would appear in some
of the rooms and it would travel around the house and would work its way
up to the fireplace too.</B>
<BR><B>I know this house was very very creepy we also tried to get a dog
but they would go crazy then we had to get rid of them as well. Now its
been like twenty years since I have lived in this house and I was searching
the Internet and I came across this site that was called (True ghost stories
from around the world) and their it was!! someone else lived in the same
house I did and wrote about it on a different site. now he had different
things happening to him and his family but when I lived there the houses
were not finished being built yet, we just moved in and moved out two years
later or even sooner everyone around us were moving it seemed like. This
story took place in London Ontario Canada the house was on Attawandaron
Rd. thank you I hope you enjoyed my little story.</B>

<BR><B>The House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mary@littlepagebooth.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am not one to scare easily, I am a horror movie buff, and watch
any horror</B>
<BR><B>flick I can. But about 6 years ago, something happened that scared
me so</B>
<BR><B>bad, I no longer watch scary movies alone!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I had a one year old son at the time, and we ended up at this
homeless</B>
<BR><B>shelter with no where to go. The homeless shelter was run by some
religious</B>
<BR><B>people and they had a program they ran. They had bought a few houses
in town</B>
<BR><B>and they would pick certain families out to stay in these houses,
under the</B>
<BR><B>conditions they save any income the family gets and put it in the
bank, and</B>
<BR><B>save money to move. Anyway, me and my son were picked to live in
one of the</B>
<BR><B>houses. It was a 3 bedroom house with two bathrooms. I was uneasy
living</B>
<BR><B>alone, but my mother was only a phone call away.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;On our third night there, my son was just learning to walk
and had took his</B>
<BR><B>first step,and he kept stumpling and then he stood and looked at
me and i</B>
<BR><B>was if he was slung foward. he busted his lip pretty good at that
time. i</B>
<BR><B>brushed it off as those few wobbley steps a baby takes.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Two of the rooms, i did not use. Me and my son stayed in one
room and in</B>
<BR><B>one of the rooms, there were two matching twin beds, they were left
by the</B>
<BR><B>previous owners and the church never removed them when they bought
the</B>
<BR><B>house. well i would keep the door closed because no matter what
the room</B>
<BR><B>stayed cold. and their were a box of toys in the corner, covered
in dust. i</B>
<BR><B>left them alone. and one day the door was open when i walked by
and i seen a</B>
<BR><B>figure in the corner of the room with one of the toys. i slammed
the door</B>
<BR><B>and immediatly called a friend to pick me and my son up. she was
an older</B>
<BR><B>lady and she is penacostal and goes to church regularly. when she
walked</B>
<BR><B>into my house,(her first visit there) she immediatly felt something
wrong</B>
<BR><B>and walked out, she told me she felt "demons" there. and so i went
back and</B>
<BR><B>had no problems, and one day i was going over to her house, and
she would</B>
<BR><B>not come to my house, so her 18 year old son came to get me. he
never went</B>
<BR><B>to church and he did not believe in ghost. he walked in my house,
sat down</B>
<BR><B>and started crying. i freaked out and we left. he refused to come
back. then</B>
<BR><B>one day i seen the figure in the back room again, standing bedside
one of</B>
<BR><B>the twin beds. It was a large dark fifure and oddly enough i could
only see</B>
<BR><B>his hands plainly, and he was holding the same toy as before, a
little small</B>
<BR><B>doll that fit in your hand. it scared me so bad. so my older friend
decided</B>
<BR><B>to help clean out the ghost. she had me say a certain prayer and
tell him to</B>
<BR><B>leave and never come back. and she left later on and that night,
i was on</B>
<BR><B>the couch and me and my son had started sleeping in the front of
the house,</B>
<BR><B>we were ready for bed and i seen this large brown spider, coming
straight</B>
<BR><B>towards the couch where i was. it was the size of my palm. i got
up and went</B>
<BR><B>around towards the kitchen, there was another one in the middle
of the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen coming towards me. i freaked and grabbed my sleeping son
and went</B>
<BR><B>towards the back of the house. i felt an awful coldness i had never
felt</B>
<BR><B>before and seen yet another spider, this time the big shadowy figure
behind</B>
<BR><B>it. i was so scared, i went to the laundry room and called my mother
to come</B>
<BR><B>get me. i ran towards the door and 4 huge spiders ran right after
me and the</B>
<BR><B>shadowy figure was no longer in the back, it was right there with
the</B>
<BR><B>spiders. my mom and dad came, and he tore the house up looking for
spiders</B>
<BR><B>and could not find any at all. they thought i was crazy. i went
to their</B>
<BR><B>house and i never went back to the house. i found out later two
little girls</B>
<BR><B>were kidnapped a long time ago from there and the man that took
them was a</B>
<BR><B>big burly man, much like the sadow i seen, he killed the girls and
then he</B>
<BR><B>killed his self for doing what he did. i do not know how much is
true but</B>
<BR><B>not a whole lot of people believed me. i am now a believer and i
have talked</B>
<BR><B>to others about their own experiences, but now that i found this
website, i</B>
<BR><B>feel normal in what happened to me. i only wish i would have encountered
a</B>
<BR><B>nice spirit and not the evil i felt there at that house. thanks
for</B>
<BR><B>listening to my story!</B>

<BR><B>The Lady in The Black Hat</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: shyonememow@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I wrote previously about the place I work, and all of the ghostly
happenings</B>
<BR><B>there. Up until now I have not seen a full aparition,only shadowy
figures,</B>
<BR><B>and strange sounds.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The other night Myself, my assistant (I will call her</B>
<BR><B>Amy) and a maintenance guy (Robert) were working in the area where
most of</B>
<BR><B>the activity occurs. it was 11:30 pm and we decided to take a smoke
break. I</B>
<BR><B>need to explain the layout of the building for this to make sense.
Our</B>
<BR><B>building is smoke free so we have to go outside to a smokehouse.
inorder to</B>
<BR><B>get there, there is a long tiled corridor about 50ft long leading
to the</B>
<BR><B>door. There are no offices or areas along the corridor. The three
of us</B>
<BR><B>headed to the smokehouse and exited the heavy safety door, Amy was
first, I</B>
<BR><B>was second, and Robert was last. Just as Robert came through the
door, Amy</B>
<BR><B>turned and gave a startled scream, I turned, and right behind us
was a</B>
<BR><B>woman. (what made her appearance so shocking was we had not seen
anyone</B>
<BR><B>walking behind us down the corridor, and there was no place for
her to have</B>
<BR><B>come out of. Also, as she walked on the blacktop, there was a loud
sharp</B>
<BR><B>clicking of her high heels. When we were walking on the tile floor
we heard</B>
<BR><B>nothing) I fell back against the wall of the building and was speechless
as</B>
<BR><B>she walked by. What scared me the most was one, her clothing. She
was</B>
<BR><B>dressed all in black. Black skirt,shoes,coat,gloves, and a large
1940's</B>
<BR><B>style hat with a veil covering half her face. And two, where did
she come</B>
<BR><B>from, and why did she not acknowledge us? Amy had screamed, and
yet she did</B>
<BR><B>not turn her head, look at us, or acknowledge us at all. After she
had</B>
<BR><B>walked by us to the parking lot I told Robert to see if she got
into a car.</B>
<BR><B>He ran after her but within 10 seconds of us seeing her she was
gone.</B>
<BR><B>Needless to&nbsp; say we were all pretty shooken up that night.
The next day we</B>
<BR><B>scoured the building for a woman who matched that build, and asked
people if</B>
<BR><B>they knew of someone who wore that style of hat, everyone said no.
This is</B>
<BR><B>not the first supernatural occurance in this building, but it is
the most</B>
<BR><B>intense to date. I should add that one of the old employees said
our</B>
<BR><B>description of this woman sounds like the founders wife, she died
in 1957.</B>

<P><B>Who Needs&nbsp; Graveyard When you have My Backyard</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Saluki248@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My backyard is not a normal backyard, I believe it to be haunted,
this thought is also shared by my family.</B>
<BR><B>My parents a long time ago used to raise salukis (the oldest breed
of dog, think of a greyhound, and add normal dog ears with long hair on
them and thier tail) and used to have quite a number of them.&nbsp; As
they died we buried them in our backyard.&nbsp; My parents stopped breeding
after I was born.&nbsp; Well as I got older I started taking care of the
dogs, and would do it at dusk.. they were in an extension of the basement
which has since been torn down.&nbsp; Well more than once I would look
out the door to this extension, feeling uncomfortable, and see the form
of a dog, or several dogs, standing on the edge of the grass, different
colors, and see throughable, I would blink and they would dissapear.&nbsp;
This happened more than once.&nbsp; So far they've been benign and have
posed no threat to us.</B>
<BR><B>Another ghost is one of my great grandmother.&nbsp; My mother, as
usual, was staying up late at night, she had to go to the bathroom, so
she got up and out of bed, and went to the bathroom, passing my door on
the way, she opened it just to check on me, and at the time I was four,
and I was using a nightlight. She looked in and saw her mother's mother,
sitting at the edge of my bed, leaning over looking at me, and then she
(my great-grandmother) turned and gave my mother a surly look, a look my
mom never recalls her grandmother giving her. She blinked and then her
grandmother was gone. Recently my mom was in the bathroom, and she looked
out into the hallway, and saw her grandmother, the same one, in front of
my door, and expressionless look on her face, that was the night before
the falling objects in the living room.</B>
<BR><B>And yet still is a strange occurance happened to me.&nbsp; I was
sitting alone in the living room, my mom in her bedroom, with the door
open and her able to see what was happening in the living room. I was typing
on the computer part of a movie Travis and I were writing, when suddenly
I heard something to my left, and I saw a box, nearly empty, fall to the
ground. There was a cloth object beneath it, and while the box had 'fallen'
a hand print had appeared on the cloth, and had vanished when it had landed.
I rubbed the incident off, not too spooked, and then a minute went by,
and the lamp, next to the fallen objects started to flicker, but nothing
else did in the house... so I continued typing, when suddenly the VCR,
next to the lamp, turns on by itself, and ejects the tape inside it by
itself.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was referred to your website by a friend who knew i would find
it</B>
<BR><B>interesting, and after reading a few of the stories i thought i
might as</B>
<BR><B>well submit my own in the hope of maybe getting feedback from others
who may</B>
<BR><B>have seen the same thing.&nbsp; I will relate the details after
this important</B>
<BR><B>background information.</B>
<BR><B>When i was perhaps six or so, in about 1988 or maybe a little later
i had an</B>
<BR><B>experience which was so fantastic that i was unsure if i had dreamt
it.</B>
<BR><B>However the memory is so clear and solid, it never really felt like
a dream.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; The morning after it occurred i told my mother and brother,
who don't get</B>
<BR><B>into this kind of thing and are not readily convinced by ghost stories
and</B>
<BR><B>such.&nbsp; They still remember me telling them this when i was
younger and Mum</B>
<BR><B>told me at the time that it must have been a dream.</B>
<BR><B>For years, in fact until late 2003, the memory barely resurfaced&nbsp;
and i</B>
<BR><B>beleive it to have been almost hidden in my mind, although now it
is as</B>
<BR><B>clear in my mind as if it happened last night.&nbsp; The only reason
i can guess</B>
<BR><B>my age during the incident is that i know my youngest brother was
not around</B>
<BR><B>and i remember my body being very small when i go back to the memory.</B>
<BR><B>In&nbsp; about September 2003 a friend of mine gave me a book to
read about mass</B>
<BR><B>alien sightings in the early to mid eighties called "The Hudson
Valley UFO</B>
<BR><B>Sightings".&nbsp; Before this book got me thinking, I never took
alien sightings</B>
<BR><B>seriously and i still don't really have an much of an opinion about
that</B>
<BR><B>stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp; Reading this book proved to me that what i remember
was reality and</B>
<BR><B>not a dream, without a doubt.&nbsp; You might be thinking, hang
on - this is not</B>
<BR><B>an alien/UFO related website!&nbsp; However what i saw gave me the
impression of</B>
<BR><B>some 'angel' or good spirit, maybe a dead relative that was fond
of me, who</B>
<BR><B>knows.&nbsp; I certainly did not think it was an alien.</B>
<BR><B>The Story:</B>
<BR><B>At the time I shared a bedroom with one of my brothers, we had a
single bed</B>
<BR><B>each that were set up parallel to each other.&nbsp; My bed was in
the middle of</B>
<BR><B>the room, with the head up against the middle of one wall, facing
a large</B>
<BR><B>window in the opposite wall.&nbsp; My brother's bed was to my right
along the</B>
<BR><B>side wall, which also had a large window.&nbsp; I remember waking
up late at</B>
<BR><B>night, it was very dark and i got the impression that it was between
about</B>
<BR><B>3.30 and 4.30 in the morning.&nbsp; When I woke up my brother remained
asleep.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>awoke with a feeling that something weird was going on but i was
not scared</B>
<BR><B>at all, it was an amazing feeling.&nbsp; Basically I just woke up
and sat bolt</B>
<BR><B>upright straight away, looking down the length of my bed, out the
window in</B>
<BR><B>the opposite wall.&nbsp; All of a sudden, with a constant and quick
pace an</B>
<BR><B>extremely bright ball of light the color of burning magnesium came
from the</B>
<BR><B>top left of my view out the window, from the night sky i guess,
bobbing up</B>
<BR><B>and down as it flew, like a wave-graph. My bedroom was at the corner
of the</B>
<BR><B>house and the light turned the corner of the house and continued
to fly</B>
<BR><B>through the garden outside.&nbsp; The path the light took through
the air burned</B>
<BR><B>into my sight like the sun will, so that you still see it when you
blink</B>
<BR><B>your eyes.</B>
<BR><B>The light left my field of vision after i watched it pass my brothers'</B>
<BR><B>window, however after a couple of seconds it re-appeared outside
the window</B>
<BR><B>at the end of my bed, lighting up the thin semi-transparent curtains
from</B>
<BR><B>the outside.&nbsp; The ball was so bright i could easily see it
through these</B>
<BR><B>embroidered white cotton curtains.&nbsp; This ball of light then
slowly began to</B>
<BR><B>come directly at me, floating right through the solid glass, the
wood frame</B>
<BR><B>of the window and the curtains also, as if it were on a different
plane of</B>
<BR><B>existence.&nbsp; I distinctly remember being surprised that the
curtains did not</B>
<BR><B>burn because the object was so bright.&nbsp; Strangely the light
only lit the</B>
<BR><B>room with a very dull glow, even though the object itself seemed
as bright</B>
<BR><B>as the sun.&nbsp; It kept moving towards me until it came to an
absolute</B>
<BR><B>standstill, hovering/floating about three feet above the end of
my bed.</B>
<BR><B>During this time I had a very pleasant and freindly feeling come
over me and</B>
<BR><B>I was totally unafraid, just amazed and thinking as a little kid
that magic</B>
<BR><B>stuff was real after all and feeling very happy about that.&nbsp;
When the light</B>
<BR><B>came to a standstill above my bed I stared at it, amazed.&nbsp;
It did not hurt</B>
<BR><B>my eyes to look at it but it was pure white light.&nbsp; I am unsure
about how</B>
<BR><B>long i stared into it but it was for a while.&nbsp; The memory of
the light</B>
<BR><B>leaving is not quite as clear as the rest of the story but I think
it just</B>
<BR><B>left the way it came in.&nbsp; I still get the same warm and peaceful
feeling</B>
<BR><B>when I&nbsp; run this memory through my head.&nbsp; It is so clear
that it is like</B>
<BR><B>watching a video in my mind.&nbsp; I also felt a very strong sense
of being</B>
<BR><B>watched, I could tell the thing was watching me and I knew that
it was</B>
<BR><B>intelligent even though it was a "ball of light".&nbsp; I felt like
it was</B>
<BR><B>smarter than me and that the light represented something else or
was just a</B>
<BR><B>means for something else to come and watch me.</B>
<BR><B>That pretty much sums up my experience.&nbsp; Until last year i
did not think</B>
<BR><B>about it much probably because it was impossible to really beleive
through</B>
<BR><B>scientific thinking.</B>
<BR><B>The UFO book I was given mostly concerned the eye-witness accounts
of</B>
<BR><B>regular citizens and cops who saw large triangular craft in the
sky with</B>
<BR><B>bright lights, all around this Hudson Valley area which i know nothing
about</B>
<BR><B>as I live in Australia.&nbsp; Towards the end of the book however
was a small</B>
<BR><B>chapter which detailed other paranormal events that happened around
the time</B>
<BR><B>of the craft sightings which had been included in the book for good
measure.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Here I read a story almost identical to the one I have just
told, down to</B>
<BR><B>every detail like the bobbing motion of the light, the amazement
of the</B>
<BR><B>witness as to the way the light floated through windows and walls
and the</B>
<BR><B>freindly feeling the lights exude, as well as the way it floated
a few feet</B>
<BR><B>from the ground and flew through the sky.&nbsp; The only discrepancy
was that the</B>
<BR><B>light in the American story was red.</B>
<BR><B>After reading this my own&nbsp; memory shot straight back into my
mind, even</B>
<BR><B>though i had not thought of it for at least 8 years or so.&nbsp;
The story I read</B>
<BR><B>was so much like my own experience that I straight-away asked my
brother and</B>
<BR><B>mother if they rememberred me telling them as a young kid, and they
did.</B>
<BR><B>This to me is undoubtable evidence that what i saw was real.&nbsp;
It is too much</B>
<BR><B>of a coincidence to not be real!&nbsp; How can two people on the
opposite sides</B>
<BR><B>of the planet have the same dream or imagination or trip or whatever?&nbsp;
Down</B>
<BR><B>to small details?&nbsp; This "coincidence"&nbsp; convinced me that
modern science does</B>
<BR><B>not describe or explain the whole of existance, and also gave me
an idea</B>
<BR><B>that maybe all the weird alien/ghost things people say they see
is just one</B>
<BR><B>and the same, existing on and around our planet but in another dimension.</B>
<BR><B>Who knows, but if anyone has feedback on this story please e-mail
me. Sorry</B>
<BR><B>it is so long!&nbsp; I would be interested even to hear people's
theories on the</B>
<BR><B>subject.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Freaky Occurances</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: daddysgirl780@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I wrote awhile back describing my life in the places I've lived throughout</B>
<BR><B>my life and how everything that deals with supernatural always seems
to jump</B>
<BR><B>up in my face. I have a few stories from a close friend that I knew
back in</B>
<BR><B>Georgia.</B>
<BR><B>One deals with an ex-boyfriend I had when I lived in Georgia. He
is an MP in</B>
<BR><B>the army and was stationed over in Germany for about 2 years shortly
after</B>
<BR><B>he joined. It so happens that me and him lived in the same city
about a year</B>
<BR><B>after one another. Anyways, him and a friend heard stories about
one of the</B>
<BR><B>castles in Idar-Oberstein, this city is way past old and seems to
take on a</B>
<BR><B>life of it's own after dark. They heard stories of the dead grounds
keeper</B>
<BR><B>walking around the castle about 11:00 at night. They being tough
army men</B>
<BR><B>decided they wanted to check this out for themselves. That night
they put on</B>
<BR><B>their army pants, black t-shirts(it was the middle of summer), and
put on</B>
<BR><B>some cammo paint. They wanted to make sure that if it was a real
person just</B>
<BR><B>pulling a prank that they wouldn't be able to spot them in the dark.
Well</B>
<BR><B>after much walking up the side of this "mountain" to get to the
old castle</B>
<BR><B>they sat down next to the path to take a breather. They checked
their</B>
<BR><B>watches every 5 minutes till 11:00 pm rolled around. When it did
and</B>
<BR><B>anything remotley freaky had yet to happen they decided to wait
another 30</B>
<BR><B>minutes, just incase the person was having a hard time getting their</B>
<BR><B>prankster butts up the hill that night. Not even 5 minutes rolled
by and</B>
<BR><B>they seen what looked like a latern coming down the path towards
them and</B>
<BR><B>the castle. They ducked behind some trees and decided to wait quietly
for</B>
<BR><B>the person to come close enough for them to jump out and scare whoever
it</B>
<BR><B>was.</B>
<BR><B>The lattern and it's carrier made their way slowly up to these two</B>
<BR><B>unsuspecting idiots hiding in the trees. Only when whoever it was
got close</B>
<BR><B>enough they couldn't see a body. They decided that instead of scaring
the</B>
<BR><B>person off they would just wait till they were far enough away to
hike back</B>
<BR><B>down the trail to their car. When they didn't see the light anymore
they</B>
<BR><B>came out from the trees and started down the trail, they instantly
got this</B>
<BR><B>errie feeling that someone was following them, on cue with one another
they</B>
<BR><B>turned around expecting to see the man who was going around scaring
people</B>
<BR><B>at night. What they saw was pretty much enough to make the toughest
man curl</B>
<BR><B>up and cry for his momma. They didn't see anything but the light
from a</B>
<BR><B>non-existant lattern. It's carrier and what what supposed to be
the source</B>
<BR><B>of the light in front of them wasn't there. They were starring at
a free</B>
<BR><B>floating light. Needless to say they hauled buns faster than ever
before</B>
<BR><B>down the path, looking behind them every few feet looking to see
if the</B>
<BR><B>light was still there. It kept up on their heals, not letting them
get too</B>
<BR><B>far ahead as to feel comforted by any distance. They eventually
ran off the</B>
<BR><B>path and into the street where their car was parked and got into
the car and</B>
<BR><B>started it up. Trying to calm down before they drove off for their
rooms</B>
<BR><B>they looked up at the path. They saw the light at the very top of
the hill,</B>
<BR><B>there would be no way any human could make it up there that fast.
They never</B>
<BR><B>went back after that, too afraid that the lattern carrier and his
light</B>
<BR><B>would actually catch them the next time they tried.</B>
<BR><B>Another occurance was from the same ex-boyfriend. This one about
a nightly</B>
<BR><B>patrol on post. There were plenty of ghost stories about this abandoned</B>
<BR><B>service building just off the military post. Even though it was
out of</B>
<BR><B>jurisdiction, the MP's were told to make sure no kids were fooling
around in</B>
<BR><B>there and getting themselves hurt by all the rusted nails and metal
support</B>
<BR><B>beams.</B>
<BR><B>That night him and his partner were assigned to different patrol
cars and</B>
<BR><B>patroling different areas of post. His partner was out by the old
abandoned</B>
<BR><B>military service station while he was patroling the commisary parking
lot.</B>
<BR><B>He got a call over his radio from his partner saying he saw movement
in the</B>
<BR><B>building and was going to check it out. Story has is that if you're
alone</B>
<BR><B>inside the building that there are the ghosts of kids and they will
run up</B>
<BR><B>to you and dance around in a circle chanting something almost inaudible
to</B>
<BR><B>the human ear. Some say alot of MPs have disappeared after going
in, some</B>
<BR><B>have been found dead inside the building and other times the person
gets so</B>
<BR><B>scared that they are found not able to talk or even come back to
reality and</B>
<BR><B>placed in the mental ward. This night his partner went against all
the</B>
<BR><B>"fairy tales" of the building and went in hoping to catch some kids
in the</B>
<BR><B>act of under age drinking or some kind of drug bust. About 15 minutes
after</B>
<BR><B>going in my ex didn't hear anything over the radio confirming or
denying any</B>
<BR><B>kids messing around in the building and became concerned. He called
over the</B>
<BR><B>radio for his partner but never got a reply. He showed up at the
building</B>
<BR><B>and heard laughing and taunting coming from one of the windows.
He looked in</B>
<BR><B>but didn't see anyone at first.</B>
<BR><B>He decided against better judgement to go in and look for his partner
even</B>
<BR><B>after searching the lot for his car which he couldn't find. He entered</B>
<BR><B>through the back door hoping to find his partner trying to calm
down some</B>
<BR><B>unruley kid in that back rooms and getting them to leave the area.
He walked</B>
<BR><B>in not seeing anyone, kids or his partner, within the back rooms.
He made</B>
<BR><B>his way up to the front of building and spotted someone, fetal postion
and</B>
<BR><B>crying inaudibly. He ran over seeing that it was his partner. He
had</B>
<BR><B>scratches all over his face, on his arms and even his neck, back
and</B>
<BR><B>stomach. He eventually pulled him out of the building and on the
way to his</B>
<BR><B>patrol car spotted his partners car that wasn't in the lot before
he went</B>
<BR><B>in. He finally got his partner calmed down and he told him what
happened.</B>
<BR><B>He went in because he heard alot of laughing and things being broken.
When</B>
<BR><B>he went in the building he didn't see anyone and decided to walk
around in</B>
<BR><B>attempts to find whoever was in there. He walked to the front of
the</B>
<BR><B>building and there was over a dozen children running around, laughing
and</B>
<BR><B>playing. He yelled for them to stop and get out of there, asked
where their</B>
<BR><B>parents were and how they got into the building and so on. When
the kids</B>
<BR><B>stopped, they all looked in his direction and their eyes were a
funny shade</B>
<BR><B>of red, almost glowing like cat eyes, but not. They started walking
towards</B>
<BR><B>him and they began to grin such evel grins.Their nails grew out
and looked</B>
<BR><B>almost like someone had taped knives to the ends of their fingers
and their</B>
<BR><B>teeth were rotten and covered with blood. He fell to the floor and
backed</B>
<BR><B>into a corner trying to get away from them all the while yelling
for them to</B>
<BR><B>stop and go away. He said eventually he blacked out and when he
woke up all</B>
<BR><B>he could smell was the scent of rotting flesh and that he was covered
with</B>
<BR><B>flies.</B>
<BR><B>That's all I can remember for now, but hopefully I can get in contact
with</B>
<BR><B>my ex and he can tell me exactly what building it was in. It was
interesting</B>
<BR><B>hearing all of the encounters he had, I just wish I could remember
them all.</B>
<BR><B>If you decide to post these I would recommend that if anyone does
decide to</B>
<BR><B>go ghost hunting don't go it alone, you don't know what you might
encounter</B>
<BR><B>and what might happen when you do encounter something.</B>
<BR><B>This next one is from my mom. When she was about 12-14 she and couple
of her</B>
<BR><B>school friends decided they wanted to mess around with the ouija
board. They</B>
<BR><B>contacted something and it was darn eager to make its presence known
to</B>
<BR><B>everyone around. It started knocking things over and she said that
it made</B>
<BR><B>the most horrendous howl, not even a dog could make. She told me
the next</B>
<BR><B>day circles appeared in her back yard, not crop circles, almost
like a pool</B>
<BR><B>had been sitting in the spot the circle was. The grass was dead
and all</B>
<BR><B>that, when the previous day there was no circle and the grass was
full of</B>
<BR><B>life. She decided that her and her friends needed to get rid of
the board.</B>
<BR><B>She gave it to one of her friends, and one of the circles disappeared,
her</B>
<BR><B>friend gave it to next and another one disappeared and when the
third one</B>
<BR><B>got rid of it all the circles in the yard had disappeared.</B>
<BR><B>She told me of another time when she was around the same age as
the above</B>
<BR><B>story. There was a middle aged woman that lived down the road in
a house she</B>
<BR><B>passed going to a from school. This lady always gave her dirty looks
and</B>
<BR><B>constantly told my mom how she was going to kill her one day. One
night my</B>
<BR><B>mom was really upset by this lady and decided that she would sleep
in the</B>
<BR><B>living room close my grandparents' room. She woke up in the middle
of the</B>
<BR><B>night being choaked by someone she couldn't see and when she tried
to pull</B>
<BR><B>their hands from her neck she couldn't feel them. It was like having
an</B>
<BR><B>invisible person choaking you. She started to pray and whatever
it was let</B>
<BR><B>go and made&nbsp; horrific scream leaving the house. The next day
she walked by</B>
<BR><B>the woman's house going to school and there were police cars out
front. She</B>
<BR><B>asked an officer what happened and they told her the lady died last
night</B>
<BR><B>and it looked like someone had burnt a cross into her hand and the
words to</B>
<BR><B>the Lord's prayer on her chest. Needless to say my mom always wore
a cross</B>
<BR><B>around her neck and the prayer she prayed to make the invisible
person</B>
<BR><B>choaking her go away, was the Lord's prayer....</B>
<BR><B>Well that's all for now, thank you for listening to these. I hope
you enjoy.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Haunting Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ssjtash@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is probably not a very noteworthy story, but I feel that it
requires some kind of mention.</B>
<BR><B>About five years ago my family moved into a rather large house.
It is situated on five acres, though most of that was wooded, and is a
two-story building. It was twenty years old, and we were the third inhabitants.
There were no known deaths at the house or surrounding property. We lived
there happily for a few months. Then one night I was brushing my teeth
and something seemed to touch my neck. It felt like an icepack, except
that it wasn't wet, just exceptionally cold. When I looked into the mirror
there was no one behind me, and certainly no one with an icepack. I ran
out of that room as soon as possible and henceforth only went into the
downstairs bathroom at night. But whenever I'd go into that room, it felt
like something was watching me, no matter what time of day.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Not long afterwards, I happened to be in the bathroom with
the lights off when I heard a sound distinctly like a camera whirring when
it runs out of film. The blinds were closed, so it couldn't possibly have
been a peeping tom. And besides that, it sounded as if it was very close
to me.</B>
<BR><B>For a good while, nothing happened. Then, about two years after
we moved in, I was up late reading and listening to music. A few dogs barked
outside, which I found odd at about one A.M.. Then a whispering voice said
my name, right into my ear. I calmed down about five minutes later, telling
myself that I should get some sleep soon. Then the doorknob shook. Only
a few minutes later, I heard a scream that seemed to come from my radio.
I had heard that song countless times before, and never had there been
a scream.</B>
<BR><B>The 'occurences' were never again so bad, but I would still find
myself scared out of my room at night. Sometimes it would sound like light
switches were being flipped on and off, but the lights wouldn't once flicker.
Once I had a dream in which a ghost 'spoke' to me by writing on a wall.
It 'told' me that its name was Chris, and it had been there before the
land was made into a subdivision. I'm pretty sure this wasn't just some
random dream. After that the only strange things were noises like scratching
and footsteps in the attic above my room, and occasionally the area would
smell like burnt rubber. We had people check the attic and air conditioning
system, but no problems were found. There was also a mark above my bed
that resembled three perfect claw marks. I checked it multiple times and
found there was no ridge around it that would account for the mark being
a shadow, nor did there seem to be any evidence that it had been a painting
mistake or a patch over some other marking. We moved out barely six months
ago, and I havn't heard a single strange thing since.</B>
<BR><B>We never had the house blessed, nor did anyone come in to see if
it was really haunted. Everyone just said that there were probably raccoons
or opossoms making noises on the roof.</B>
<BR><B>Thank you very much for taking your time to read this.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Night Visitor</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: zandor_8@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I love the stories on your website and have decided to offer one
of my own.</B>
<BR><B>This experience happened a number of years ago, I had managed to
get caught</B>
<BR><B>up in a bit of a 'bad' crowd as such, most of the people in the
group were</B>
<BR><B>into drugs (marijuana/mushrooms/pills etc) and alcohol.&nbsp; I,
however was</B>
<BR><B>quite 'straight'.&nbsp; I didn't experiment with drugs, and only
consumed the</B>
<BR><B>occasional drink.</B>
<BR><B>I got on well with everyone and my decision to not touch drugs or
drink much</B>
<BR><B>was respected.&nbsp; I was living in a motel unit in the sunny Bay
of Plenty, New</B>
<BR><B>Zealand.&nbsp; A few friends had comfortably ensconsed themselves
in my living</B>
<BR><B>room and we were all happily watching videos, we had decided that
they would</B>
<BR><B>stay over-sleeping on the couches in the living room. An older guy</B>
<BR><B>(thirties) that my friend had met a few days earlier and taken a
shine to,</B>
<BR><B>was with us.&nbsp; He was a Maori guy, longish hair and tattoo's
on his face (I</B>
<BR><B>took an instant dislike to him, as I got a bad feeling when he was
around).</B>
<BR><B>When he slept he would talk/argue away and punch out at the air.&nbsp;
Anyway, I</B>
<BR><B>had decided to go to bed early as I was fairly tired, the others
stayed up</B>
<BR><B>talking.&nbsp; I shut the door to my bedroom (it lead straight into
the living</B>
<BR><B>room), and turned the light off.&nbsp; There was quite a bit of
light shining</B>
<BR><B>into the room through my thin curtains, though.</B>
<BR><B>Sometime later, during the twilight stage (between sleeping and
waking) I</B>
<BR><B>realised that a form lay next to me and that I was having quite
a</B>
<BR><B>conversation with him, I have absolutely no idea what the conversation
was</B>
<BR><B>about, only that I felt quite comfortable and that it felt like
the most</B>
<BR><B>natural thing in the world! However, on full awareness of the situation,
I</B>
<BR><B>leapt out of bed and rushed across the room and turned the light
on.&nbsp; There</B>
<BR><B>was nobody there, however a slight body indentation remained on
the other</B>
<BR><B>side of the bed.</B>
<BR><B>Well, I left the light on and went back to bed.&nbsp; As I lay staring
at the</B>
<BR><B>wall in front of me, I saw a huge spider (tarantula-size), descend
from the</B>
<BR><B>corner of the ceiling and scuttle across the door frame, across
part of the</B>
<BR><B>wall and then disappear.&nbsp; I leapt out of bed and threw open
the door to the</B>
<BR><B>living-room.&nbsp; Everyone looked at me like I had flipped my lid
after hearing</B>
<BR><B>my story!.&nbsp; I sheepishly returned to bed.</B>
<BR><B>Back to sleep with the light on and door shut.&nbsp; I was woken
later on with a</B>
<BR><B>feeling of panic, as I opened my eyes I could see quite clearly
(as the</B>
<BR><B>bedroom light was still on) the black shape of a head and torso
descending</B>
<BR><B>down towards me (I had a feeling that this thing was a male).&nbsp;
I leapt out</B>
<BR><B>of bed as fast as I could, as I moved, the shape just seemed to
dissolve</B>
<BR><B>very quickly!&nbsp; I had the feeling it was looking for a way in
to me, maybe</B>
<BR><B>through a tear or hole in the aura (magnetic energy field surrounding
a</B>
<BR><B>body).&nbsp; I believe having my aura being disturbed woke me up.</B>
<BR><B>On reflection I believe that what I saw, was somehow connected to
my</B>
<BR><B>friend's new male friend (mentioned earlier) a spirit that may have
attached</B>
<BR><B>itself to him maybe, and was consequently drawn to me .</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I find it hard to make the assumption that the thing I was
talking to and</B>
<BR><B>the thing descending down on me are one and the same, It would be
logical I</B>
<BR><B>know.&nbsp; But it was the feeling I got about each one-comfortable
(almost a</B>
<BR><B>familiar feeling) with the first one (lying next to me) and sheer
panic from</B>
<BR><B>the one descending down on me!&nbsp; The spider was just strange,
I don't have</B>
<BR><B>any fear connected with spiders and actually quite admire them (I
am always</B>
<BR><B>the one saving them from the shower and putting them safely outside
at</B>
<BR><B>friends' houses), I quite happily pick them up.</B>

<P><B>The Face in the Picture of Pacific University</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: WynterRoseAngel@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi my name is crystal and here is my story: In 1999, 2 friends and
I went out 'ghost hunting' around Forest Grove, Oregon. We stopped our
car in front of Pacific University to take some snap shots of the school
with our digital camera. My friend seemed to feel fine but I started to
get this sense that we should leave, that we were not wanted there. I kept
saying, "come on lets go, please. We shouldn't be here". My friends started
calling me names and then pretended they didn't hear me. I heard a sound
behind me, saw what it was, and said, "See, I told you we needed to leave."
My friends turned toward the sound and saw our car, parked where we had
left it, seemed to have started its own ignition for it sat there running.
slowly my friend Ryan raised the camera and took a shot of the car, then
after putting the camera away, he reached in his coat pocket and brought
out the only set of car keys. By this time we were all freaking out. we
got in the car, drove as quickly as we could to the apartment we were renting,
andloaded the digital pictures onto the computer. everyone of the pictures
had a very distinct face that seemed to be starring directly at me (where
i had been standing when the picture was taken ). the picture of the car
revealed a woman sitting in the drivers seat and a blood red glow surrounding
the car. the woman seemed to be smiling in a creepy way and beckoning with
her finger. the next day my friend was driving our car near the area and
got in a wreck, he was in Th. hospital for awhile, but the police found
a Pict in the car, it was of the same woman standing beside Ryan with her
hand on his shoulder, laughing, and beckoning toward the camera with her
other hand. Since then my other friend and I both have gotten into car
wrecks and both barely survived. I looked at the picture of myself taken
at pacific university and whereas the picture had been clear before, the
woman was now there...</B>

<BR><B>The Ringing Telephone</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: MadameDana@netscape.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I had recently sent you a letter describing my one experience at
age 17</B>
<BR><B>yrs&nbsp; with my grandmother and how she came to visit as a floating
white</B>
<BR><B>orb and a peaceful presence once it disappeared..</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How ever when I was younger about 13 yrs of age,
I experienced</B>
<BR><B>another happening this one I will never forget aswell. I was home
from</B>
<BR><B>school downstairs watching t.v with my younger brother ( as my mother</B>
<BR><B>was the only provider of the household she had to work, my father
had</B>
<BR><B>deceased at an early age leaving my mother with 2 young babies )
The</B>
<BR><B>phone started to ring I answered the phone thinking it was my mother</B>
<BR><B>calling making sure everything was okay. As I answered the phone
it</B>
<BR><B>sounded weird there was alot of static and then I heard a voice..
It was</B>
<BR><B>not my mothers The lady on the other end was talking in a faint
Scottish</B>
<BR><B>accent and asking for my mother by her first&nbsp; name. I stated
she wasn't</B>
<BR><B>home and then the phone went dead no dial tone no nothing I got
thinking</B>
<BR><B>that voice sounded familiar but I couldn't place it I told mom when
she</B>
<BR><B>came home and never minded about the call after that , until about
3</B>
<BR><B>days later . The phone again rings and the same thing on the other
end</B>
<BR><B>static faint Scottish voice and asking for my mom ,but then it clicked</B>
<BR><B>it sounded alot like Cathy I asked who it was and then again dead
air</B>
<BR><B>(I know this doesn't sound weird but I must tell you Cathy had died
a</B>
<BR><B>month before the calls.). I then quickly called my mom this time</B>
<BR><B>freaking telling my mom Cathy called&nbsp; my mom said Dana it was
not Cathy</B>
<BR><B>and there is probably something wrong with the phone or you had
a bad</B>
<BR><B>connection I swore it was Cathy ... Then 2 days later my mom receives
a</B>
<BR><B>phone call at work&nbsp; and it was the same scenario and then my
knew.. She</B>
<BR><B>came home and told me I asked her if it was Cathy and she said&nbsp;
it</B>
<BR><B>sounded like her but with alot of static and then the phone went
dead .</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Exactly 1 week later my whole family was watching t.v&nbsp;
a show called</B>
<BR><B>"That's Incredible" and on came the program about ghosts contacting
this</B>
<BR><B>family through the phone with the same incidents My mom and I looked
at</B>
<BR><B>one another and we really knew we had been contacted by Cathy.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;My mom use to say that when I was younger I would always hide
under the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen table and say there was a ghost in the house especially
in the</B>
<BR><B>hallway near my room&nbsp; . Now keep in mind this is the house
myself,</B>
<BR><B>mother, brother and my father had lived before he passed away. My
father</B>
<BR><B>was 27 passing and leaving my mom with a 22 mth old and a 4 mth
old . So</B>
<BR><B>now I am thinking he probably was there watching and seeing how
we were</B>
<BR><B>since he couldn't spend much time with us during his natural&nbsp;
life .</B>

<P><B>By: CoyoteDances6803@webtv.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have been visiting your site for quite some time now and I really</B>
<BR><B>enjoy it! I remember when the only stories posted were your own.
I never</B>
<BR><B>imagined that it would grow to such proportion but I am glad that
it</B>
<BR><B>did. Now the time has come for me to share. To begin I have to go
back</B>
<BR><B>to a time before it all began. So bear with me for a few lines.
In the</B>
<BR><B>early 70's my family was living in an apartment complex in south
Florida</B>
<BR><B>and my mother soon grew tired of living so close to the neighbors.
One</B>
<BR><B>day she was discussing this with our letter carrier and he informed
her</B>
<BR><B>that his mother had recently passed away ( in the hospital -- not
the</B>
<BR><B>house ) leaving him a house and he was looking for renters. Since
the</B>
<BR><B>rent would be the same as what she was paying for the apartment
my</B>
<BR><B>mother jumped at the chance and we soon moved in. Nothing happened
at</B>
<BR><B>that time. We lived there for about 5 years and then my father (
who was</B>
<BR><B>in the Air Force ) got stationed to an air base in New Mexico. We
lived</B>
<BR><B>there for 4 years and then moved back to Florida. For awhile we
lived</B>
<BR><B>with my mothers mother in a 2 bedroom apartment but there were 6
people</B>
<BR><B>living there so soon my mother had to look to find a place of our
own to</B>
<BR><B>rent. She saw that the house we lived in prior to moving to New
Mexico</B>
<BR><B>was once again free so she called up her old friend and we moved
back</B>
<BR><B>in. This is when it all began. Shortly after moving in my younger</B>
<BR><B>brother refused to sleep in his room. When asked why he simply would
not</B>
<BR><B>answer. He slept in the living room on the couch. My sister and
I shared</B>
<BR><B>a room at the time and I was very unhappy about it. She is very
messy</B>
<BR><B>and I am very neat. So I told my brother that if he did not start</B>
<BR><B>sleeping in his room within a week that I was going to make it mine.
A</B>
<BR><B>week later I was in my new room. And then I found out why my brother</B>
<BR><B>would not sleep in there. Several nights I would wake up to find
the</B>
<BR><B>sheets being slowly pulled off of me. I never saw anyone nor anything</B>
<BR><B>and I never told anyone anything about it. Then one night I awoke
to see</B>
<BR><B>3 amber colored orbs next to my bed. They were all in a line and
one by</B>
<BR><B>one they would slowly move towards my face --- back away --- excitedly</B>
<BR><B>circle the other 2 --- and then continue on down the line. Each
orb</B>
<BR><B>taking its' turn several times each. I was not afraid just merely</B>
<BR><B>curious as to what they were and why the found me so exciting. I
did</B>
<BR><B>however quit sleeping in there. My sisters sloppiness was easier
to</B>
<BR><B>handle than the orbs disturbance of my sleep. There were always
noises</B>
<BR><B>which could not be explained. We always heard things crashing only
to</B>
<BR><B>check the entire house out and find nothing out of order. In 86
my</B>
<BR><B>parents got divorced and we moved from the home. My mother remarried
and</B>
<BR><B>she and my step father bought a home together. I had my son in 88
and</B>
<BR><B>tried living on my own for some time but for financial reasons my
son</B>
<BR><B>and I ended up moving in with my mother and step father. The night
we</B>
<BR><B>moved in my son started seeing people. More specifically people
dressed</B>
<BR><B>in pre civil war garb. My family and I just accepted this we did
not</B>
<BR><B>even bother trying to explain it and never doubted my son. Although
--</B>
<BR><B>we never saw those people. However, nearly everyone in the house
has</B>
<BR><B>seen a little blond boy in what used to be the living room. I always</B>
<BR><B>just assumed that I was seeing my son in passing and would call
out a</B>
<BR><B>greeting to him --- when I got no reply I would double back to inquire</B>
<BR><B>as to why -- only to discover that it was not my son because he
would be</B>
<BR><B>found outside. There are only 2 doors exiting the house and he would</B>
<BR><B>have had to pass by me in order for it to have been him. And after</B>
<BR><B>thinking about it I would realize the boy I saw had much lighter
hair</B>
<BR><B>than my son and was a few inches shorter. Also something will get
into</B>
<BR><B>bed with me and just silently sit next to me. Even when I am not
alone.</B>
<BR><B>I assume it is male because it has a strong aura and I dubbed him</B>
<BR><B>'Mick,' after Mick Jagger because once during a 'visit' from him
a block</B>
<BR><B>of Stones songs were being played on the radio. My parents added
on a</B>
<BR><B>wing to the house so that my son and I could have an apartment of
our</B>
<BR><B>own. We no longer see the boy since we no longer live in the main
house</B>
<BR><B>but 'Mick' decided to move in with us. Thank you for providing a
place</B>
<BR><B>for me to share my story.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Since 12</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: crazy_avery69@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>It all started when I was 12 years old.&nbsp; I lived with my mom.&nbsp;
There had</B>
<BR><B>been many encounters of spirtual things happening all around me.&nbsp;
They</B>
<BR><B>scared me alot, like anyone else would be.&nbsp; I would always
have a hard time</B>
<BR><B>getting to sleep at night or being at the house by myself.&nbsp;
I always felt as</B>
<BR><B>if something was watching me, a very intense feeling.</B>
<BR><B>One night when I was playing solitare in the kitchen and had my
sterio on</B>
<BR><B>from my bedroom I heard my window in my room shut.&nbsp; I didn't
think anything</B>
<BR><B>of it, until I heard things moving around in my room.&nbsp; I got
up and went</B>
<BR><B>into my room and looked around...my window was locked, and I did
not see</B>
<BR><B>anything.&nbsp; So I went back out into the kitchen.&nbsp; Then
a few moments later my</B>
<BR><B>sterio got louder and then it turned off, I went in my room to see
what was</B>
<BR><B>going on, and I had this Stone Cold Steve Austin stand-up poster
that stood</B>
<BR><B>up like 6ft tall.&nbsp; As I walked into my room that poster was
standing</B>
<BR><B>up!!!!!! It freaked me out I just stood there and I remember looking
at the</B>
<BR><B>eyes on the poster and it was the most horrible feeling ever.&nbsp;
Noone was in</B>
<BR><B>my house besides me so I know that no human figure put that up.&nbsp;
I ran out</B>
<BR><B>of my house and stayed at a friends house that night.</B>
<BR><B>There was another time when I was on my computer in my room and
I was</B>
<BR><B>hearing noises in my living room, where my room was I could see
the living</B>
<BR><B>room.&nbsp; I looked out there and saw black shadows all around
my living</B>
<BR><B>room...floating from the side walls and then through my ceiling,
I shut my</B>
<BR><B>door and jumped on my bed and didn't move until my mom came home
about 5</B>
<BR><B>hours later.</B>
<BR><B>Another time something unusual happend when I was sleeping I was
faced</B>
<BR><B>towards my wall.&nbsp; I got this intense feeling of something looking
at me</B>
<BR><B>while i was sleeping, so i turned around on my bed now faced towards
my</B>
<BR><B>computer.&nbsp; I saw someone sitting in my computer chair faced
towards me.&nbsp; It</B>
<BR><B>had long black hair and everything it was wearing was black.&nbsp;
All I remember</B>
<BR><B>seeing was red eyes looking into mine.&nbsp; I couldnt move I sat
there looking</B>
<BR><B>at the figured for about a long 5mins.&nbsp; I yelled out to my
mom and when she</B>
<BR><B>turned on my light nothing was there but the chair was still faced
towards</B>
<BR><B>me, when the chair had been put under the table before I went to
bed.</B>
<BR><B>The next night I was sleeping and I woke up to the feeling of someone</B>
<BR><B>watching me.&nbsp; I looked at the end of my bed and there it was!&nbsp;
That same</B>
<BR><B>person that was sitting in the chair the night before.&nbsp; It
was very tall and</B>
<BR><B>again everything it was wearing was black, black trench coat with
black</B>
<BR><B>gloves and long black hair.&nbsp; It was just scaring at me.&nbsp;
I coudnt move or</B>
<BR><B>even yell out to my mom, I was so scared.&nbsp; I just put the covers
over my</B>
<BR><B>head and curled up, ever since that night I curl up, I can never
lay</B>
<BR><B>straight out, because I always have the feeling of that figure at
the end of</B>
<BR><B>my bed trying to get my feet and pull me off the bed or something.</B>
<BR><B>Ever since that incounter I have had numerous times of that tall
dark figure</B>
<BR><B>looking at me at night.&nbsp; I see it at least every other night.&nbsp;
I am now 16</B>
<BR><B>years old and it is still everywhere I go.&nbsp; Since I have lived
in that</B>
<BR><B>house, I have moved 4 times and every house I am at it is still
there with</B>
<BR><B>me.&nbsp; I am deathly scared of it because whatever it is, is very
evil.&nbsp; I have</B>
<BR><B>had spirtual encounters before but nothing like this.&nbsp; I dont
really</B>
<BR><B>understand why it follows me, I dont understand any of it.</B>
<BR><B>One time I heard a voice, it kept repeating my name over and over
again.</B>
<BR><B>Then I would look down my hallway and see that it was somthing standing</B>
<BR><B>outside my door.&nbsp; When I yelled for my mom it ran across the
hallway passed</B>
<BR><B>my room and into the washer and drier room.&nbsp; My mom beleived
me when I told</B>
<BR><B>her what was happening.&nbsp; Which was good, because I had someone
to talk to</B>
<BR><B>about it.&nbsp; I would sleep with my bible everynight and have
a cross that hung</B>
<BR><B>above my bed.&nbsp; Ever since I did that about a year I didnt see
anything else.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; When I moved in with my dad, is when it came back.&nbsp;
I still sleep with my</B>
<BR><B>bible everynight but it just seems to get stronger.&nbsp; I really
don't know</B>
<BR><B>what this being is..or what it wants..i just thought i would share
my story</B>
<BR><B>with you and see what you think is happening. thanks please get
back with</B>

<P><B>Veal Station Cemetery</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bboyce@hot.rr.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>There is a cemetery on a back road near the town that I grew up in.&nbsp;
The cemetery had all the stories it could about it, it used to be a site
for the KKK and/or devil worshipers.&nbsp; There is also a tombstone that
"glows" near the back.&nbsp; I know that the tombstone glows because of
the type of stone it is made out of.&nbsp; I forgot what type of stone
or mineral it is that causes it to do so.&nbsp; Anyway, one evening an
friend and I went to go look at it.&nbsp; We wanted to get a close up look,
just because we had nothing better to do I guess.&nbsp; When we got there,
everything was fine.&nbsp; There is a street light there at the cemetery,
so it is not pitch black, there is plenty of light.&nbsp; As we entered
the gate, I was fine.&nbsp; After we got about 10 steps inside, I had the
overwhelming sense that we should leave, and we should leave now.&nbsp;
We ran back to his car and got in and locked the doors.</B>
<BR><B>Now his car was a very old car, even then.&nbsp; It was a 76 Datsun
and fuses were always blowing and that sort of thing.&nbsp; Well we got
in the car and he started it no problem.&nbsp; When he went to turn on
the headlight, they wouldn't come on.&nbsp; So he asked me to reach into
the back and get the pliers, so he could fix it.&nbsp; As I am reaching
into the back seat to get them, something started pounding on the roof
of the car.&nbsp; I turned around and looked at him and it was still happening
and he wasn't doing it.&nbsp; I quickly sat down as he laid on the gas
and we got out of there.&nbsp; As soon as we hit the edge of the cemetery,
where the fence line is, his headlights turned on by themselves.&nbsp;
It was very odd that it happened and I almost peed in his seat.&nbsp; There
are no trees that overhang the road where we were at, so no animal could
have fallen out and landed on the car.&nbsp; That was the scariest night
of my life and I know it doesn't compare to some other people's stories
here but it sure meant something to me!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Scariest Thing</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Blueidstarr@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>hello, my story's kinda weird. you see my freinds(they were sisters)
and i were staying at their house. They had told me before i went over
to their house that they were on the computer and a strange file of a picture
of a strange little boy was on their computer. they had no idea where it
came from. Their dad had said that the people that used to live there had
a son who commited suicide in that house, the discription of the guy who
killed him self was just like the boy in the picture. we tried not to let
it bother us. Later that day my friend's mother went out to get us somthing
to eat while my friend and i were staying in the kitchen. i had just got
finished saying "at one time or another we should try contacting the spirit
of the little boy" just&nbsp; then we both looked up and saw a black shadow
like running across the back door window and we took one look at eachother
and ran out the front door. then we decided to got check out the backyard
and we ran there just to make sure there was no burglers. there was nothing
in the back yard so we ran back to the front yard and the front door was
wide open, and hen we ran out we closed it tight and then the stereo started
playing full blast, it was the scariest thing of my life we didnt go back
inside untill after her mom and sister came home. we still dont know if
it was a person or just&nbsp; a soul of a person.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Cat Came Back</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Kerris.Horner@astrazeneca.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>This happened to me an awfully long time ago. When I was small, about
three, my Dad bought home a little black kitten, with a perfect white diamond
under his chin.</B>
<BR><B>For me it was love at first sight.</B>
<BR><B>The kitten grew up into quite the biggest Tomcat I have ever seen,
a loveable rogue, we were very close, he would follow me to school etc.
Then my sister appeared on the seen, the cat hated her, and the feeling
was mutual.</B>
<BR><B>As she grew, she, like many babies tortured the poor creature; in
the end he bit her. My dad is a little highly stung and one of my clearest
memories from my childhood is of him chasing the cat with an axe!!!</B>
<BR><B>Anyway one day the cat just ran away, I was devastated and just
couldn’t believe that my beloved pet had gone. I decided with childish
dedication not to give up hope, and looked for my cat everyday. But months
turned into years and still no cat, I never gave up and would always look
expectantly back up the road from school to home.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway one day quite a few years later, in the growing dusk, I was
sat looking out of the floor to ceiling window at the twilight street dreaming
of nothing in particular. My dad was asleep on the sofa, and no lights
were on in the room.</B>
<BR><B>My cat came back, he walked around the corner of the house as large
as life, stepped daintily through the glass window, and proceeded to rub
himself round my legs purring happily.</B>
<BR><B>I was overjoyed, so overjoyed in fact that I never thought it strange
that the cat had just stepped through a non-opening window, I shouted to
wake my dad that my cat had come back.</B>
<BR><B>The effect on my dad was electric he shot out of the sofa and jumped
up and down like a maniac, obviously terrified. In the pandemonium my cat
just disappeared, I was devastated all over again.</B>
<BR><B>I couldn’t understand why everyone was so upset at what I had seen,
I even managed to convince myself that the cat must have been in the room
and the low light just made it look like he stepped through the window.
All I knew was my cat had come back to me and now he had been frightened
away again.</B>
<BR><B>Many, many years later, (I’m grown up with my own family now), we
were all at a family party, a little too much wine had been drunk and we
were laughing about the things we used to believe as children. Suddenly
my dad laughed and said, that I was the daftest of all for believing the
cat had run away; when really my grandma had taken him to be put down that
same weekend, talk about a tumbleweed moment.</B>
<BR><B>At least it explained the window trick; the poor animal had been
dead at least seven years by then, but I believe that he at least knew
that I had nothing to do with it, and even now thirty years after I lost
him I still have a very good look at every black cat I see.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Personal Ongoing Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jill@elkoradio.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>my ex and i lived at the hwy department in contact nevada for a couple
of years which is about 15 miles south of jackpot nv. he was the supervisor
for ndot and stationed there, our residence lay not even off of the hwy
but more so right next to it... sorrounded by an 8 ft. chain link fence
contact hwy maitanance station slowly became our home.&nbsp; there had
been random stories of a murder 20 someodd years before of the wife of
a hwy supervisor who had come home one night from the usually all night
job out on his highway of plowing the snow from the road a bit early and
caught his wife in bed with another man... the story (of course varies
.. drifts,, through out the mid section .. but never the less always seems
to end on the very same note no matter the story teller.. the husband had
gone outside in a fit of rage and she had followed him, crying, begging,
but as he returned to her at the porch 5 steps high his loaded riffle let
out a thunderous echoing roar.&nbsp; shot in the abdomen she bellyed over
layed there and died .. no one quites certain as to her lovers fate but
story goes 2 weeks or so later her sister to her own life in the back room
of the house leaving the bullet hole in the wall as a reminder which is
very much still easily seen.&nbsp; the man is still in prison for the murder
of his wife but her soul is definitely resting.</B>
<BR><B>i remember waking now and then with not just scratches but deep
claw like gashes running either directly up my legs , inner thighs, or
fore arms,&nbsp; bruises which i hadnt layed down with would grow more
appearant as the haunting progressed. finally she became so fueled by what
i can only explain as pure confusion and simply jealousy that she started
screaming, throwing things, making herself and sudden movements in the
room more easily and more often seen by both myself and my ex but even
passing company as well.&nbsp; the ceiling door shaft to the attic was
directly in the center of our hall and one day as i stood beneath it blow
drying my hair and doing my makeup in the mirror it began beating up and
down rapidly as if someone or something was pulling or sucking it into
the attic and the quickly releasing it with rapping bangs.</B>
<BR><B>the one time that sticks out more than others is one when i myself
was not even there... i had decided to stay in elko that night and around
2 in the morning mike as he slept alone on the couch as often he did when
i wasnt there heard me come in just as i would have done normally in my
ways so it was far from unsettleing to hear the footsteps and the screen
door to him</B>
<BR><B>he said that he could even smell me .. in the middle of groggy awareness
newly woken by the door he fell to the reflex of holding out the blanket
with a smile for me to join him and snuggle in.. happy im home.&nbsp; after
moments of laying there he said that she began to stroke his head and hair
the EXACT way in which i do ... now that may not seem weird to you but
to he and i cuz we know the uniqueness of this manner, it was freakishly

<P><B>By: drmwlker2000@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>hi, I'm a USAF airman living in japan, and i want to tell you some
of my experiences.&nbsp; these stories take place in between 1981 and 1983.&nbsp;
I'm now 27yrs old.</B><B></B>

<P><B>when i was 7 yrs old, my family(mom,dad,sister and me)were living
in this post civil war house in Greensboro, AL.&nbsp; we were kinda poor
and the place my dad worked for let us live there rent free.&nbsp; i never
liked this house.&nbsp; we lived there from the time i was 4 till i was
7.&nbsp; anyway, this house had a foreboding feeling to it.&nbsp; always
scared me.&nbsp; my room was all the way in back of the house.&nbsp; each
room had a fireplace that was never used and all the rooms were pretty
big.&nbsp; off of my room was my sisters, then a bathroom, then my parents
room.&nbsp; late one night before i started kindergarten, i awoke one night
and thought i saw my dad at the end of my bed.&nbsp; he told me everything
was okay and to go back to sleep.&nbsp; and for years i would see him when
i would awake in the night, sometimes at the foot of my bed others in the
coroner of the room propped on the wall.&nbsp; it wasn't until i was at
least 6 that i realized it was my grandfather(dad's dad).&nbsp; wasn't
until school started that the bad things started to happen to me. in ever
other room in the house i was terrorized except in my own room.&nbsp; these
would range from me being pushed to the floor, things flying across the
room at me when i was the only one there, to literally being PUSHED out
the door by an unseen force and distinctly hearing GET OUT NOW! right in
font of me.&nbsp; could even feel the breath on my face!&nbsp; i would
not stay there alone.&nbsp; one night i had to sleep in my sisters oom
cause my room had a leaky roof.&nbsp; i remember clear as day being rolled
over onto my stomach.&nbsp; before i could move i felt hands on the back
of my head forcing my head into my pillow.&nbsp; i know it wasn't my sister
cause the hands felt like a man's hands.&nbsp; that, and i could still
hear her snoring.&nbsp; i started to struggle, and it got harder.&nbsp;
my sister finally woke up and grab me and pulled me up.&nbsp; i remember
taking a deep breath and screaming for my mother.&nbsp; mom came in and
i told her what happened. she said it was a bad dream and go back to bed.&nbsp;
i always told her what had happened to me, and she said a bad dream of
my imagination.&nbsp; so, after about an 1hr i go back to sleep, on my
left side.&nbsp; don't know how long it had been but when i rolled over
onto my back there was what we always called a "sticker bush" leaves in
the bed under the covers!!!!!&nbsp; they had not been there earlier.&nbsp;
i don't know if the thing was evil or just didn't like me, but the back
porch was about 10feet off the ground.&nbsp; had some really steep steps
going down to the back yard.&nbsp; we were finally moving cause my mom
was expecting my little brother.&nbsp; as i opened the door to the steps,
right by my ear i hear "finally" really loud and i felt a push.&nbsp; i
went down all the stairs to the ground and i heard laughing.&nbsp; didn't
get anything more than scrapes and bruises thank god.&nbsp; when i found
my mom she said that she too had been pushed down the back steps and heard
the laughing.&nbsp; we packed our stuff and moved.&nbsp; thats about the
extent of the experiences i've had personally.&nbsp; other than refusing
to live certain places cause i saw someone in the house before we got there
or going inside and refused to be there.&nbsp; my mom died in 1991 and
i smell her perfume from time to time but thats it.&nbsp; i know she's
with me and proud of her son for serving in the USAF.</B>
<BR><B>if you have any comments please feel free to email me.&nbsp; thank
you r your time and have a "good Air Force day!"</B><B></B>

<P><B>unclassified insights into my future</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Gemma.Cox@defence.gov.au</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>How or where do I start,</B>
<BR><B>I was born in a small town Caerphilly, South Wales U.K,</B>
<BR><B>from the moment I was born my parents knew I was special, however
in a way</B>
<BR><B>not even they had expected. My Great Grandmother lost her husband
during</B>
<BR><B>the II world war and her eight year old daughter not long after.
I myself</B>
<BR><B>never knew of this until I was 13 and was confronted with this dark
story</B>
<BR><B>to my family history.</B>
<BR><B>My family migrated to Australia when I was Seven and as the years
went on</B>
<BR><B>I found myself fascinated with the supernatural. I have never been</B>
<BR><B>sceptical and pity those out there that are ( you have no idea how
much</B>
<BR><B>knowledge your missing out on) When I was in my first year of high
school</B>
<BR><B>my English teacher gave us an assignment to do by the following
week, the</B>
<BR><B>subject was whether we had any stories of family members that had
died</B>
<BR><B>unexpectedly.</B>
<BR><B>The next few days were really weird that's the only explanation
for it,</B>
<BR><B>my parents informed me that when I was born I was the spitting image
of my</B>
<BR><B>Nanna's daughter, my Great Aunt. My Nanna was so convinced I was
a re-</B>
<BR><B>incarnation of her daughter, I can only guess that would explain
her</B>
<BR><B>favouritism towards me.</B>
<BR><B>When I found out by my parents that she disappeared and her remains
were</B>
<BR><B>later found in the British channel only to be identified by her
dental</B>
<BR><B>records, I felt saddened in a way I couldn't explain it was like
I knew</B>
<BR><B>what happened to her.</B>
<BR><B>The next few days I can't even explain what happened except that
I was</B>
<BR><B>guided by the spirit of my Great Aunt.</B>
<BR><B>For days I would feel the presence of a small girl watching me I
would</B>
<BR><B>walk down the hallway to my bedroom and the smoke alarms would go
off (</B>
<BR><B>with no batteries I might add) I would awaken early hours in the
morning</B>
<BR><B>unable to sleep and the TV would have television shows about the</B>
<BR><B>unexplained on. By now I realised something was trying to communicate
with</B>
<BR><B>me and wouldn't stop until I would listen. I sat down at the computer
to</B>
<BR><B>type my assignment and I can't remember writing anything I was being</B>
<BR><B>channelled, I know now that my Great Aunt told her story through
me and is</B>
<BR><B>now resting in peace. I showed my mum and dad what I wrote and my
dad</B>
<BR><B>couldn't believe that I gave a detailed explanation of where and
how she</B>
<BR><B>was abducted, how she was raped, murdered and dumped. He started
to cry</B>
<BR><B>and told me that one day his father was really upset and told him
that he</B>
<BR><B>would never forgive himself for losing his little sister. He told
my dad</B>
<BR><B>that they were playing hide and seek he turned away from her to
count and</B>
<BR><B>when he turned back he never found her. In my description of her
abduction</B>
<BR><B>I wrote that she hid in a tunnel that was at the end of a little
alley way</B>
<BR><B>that they were playing in and that's when two men kidnapped her.</B>
<BR><B>When my father read that, he asked me how I knew that the alley
even</B>
<BR><B>existed, I myself had never seen it and he never told me about it
earlier.</B>
<BR><B>It really freaked him out because they never knew any details because</B>
<BR><B>no-one was ever caught. My dad can remember growing up and the street
next</B>
<BR><B>to his there was an alley way with a tunnel at the end that used
to lead</B>
<BR><B>to a clearing and a field.</B>
<BR><B>after that I never had any supernatural experiences again until
I was 17</B>
<BR><B>and that's when I started&nbsp; to get really scared.</B>
<BR><B>This is my longest story because I had to give you a brief history
for you</B>
<BR><B>to be able to grasp the full picture.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Creepy House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sweet__strawberrie@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I remember when I was young, we always used to visit my Grandparents
home, on Sunnydale road, about 15 minutes from our own house. I had never
liked visiting. The house was only a few yards from an old cemetary and
as much as I loved my Nana and Gramps, things about the house scared me.
My Grampa had lived in that house, from what I heard, his whole life. His
wife had died and he had remarried my Nana, and my Nana's husband had died,
and so she had remarried to my Gramps. The two families had become one,
much like...well, the Brady Bunch. Anyways, back to my story. Not every
room scared me. It was certain rooms that made me want to start crying
and run. My mom had told me the reason I feared some of these rooms was
because of all the old things. If I learned something about them, they
wouldn't scare me. Perhaps she was right about some of the rooms, they
all had old things cluttering the shelves. But it was more than that. The
feeling I got when I entered certain areas of the house frightened me more
then I know how to describe. It was a feeling one might get when sitting
alone in pitch black. I was almost expecting a ghost or dead body to fall
in front of me. The first thing that frightened me were the mirrors in
every room. I had never liked large mirrors at night. During the day, they
were a sorce of beautification, but even the old antique mirrors frightened
me during the day. I had had bad experiences with the house itself, which
was another reason that it scared me. I remember falling asleep there when
my parents were visiting, and waking up at midnight, my parents gone. They
had left me over night for fear of walking me up as they carried me to
the car. Now, I was only 5, and so walking up in what I thought was my
bed and turning out to be the old dusty guest room made my heart stop and
I began to scream. I remeber that night so well. There were more things
about the house that made me feel uneasy. The bath room was huge, bigger
then my own room at home. Two big mirrors were placed on either side of
the wall, and many old antique glass sculptures adorned the counter top.
A curtained shower was across from the toilet. The curtain was heavy and
white, and so being inside the shower felt like being locked in a pure
white room. But the thing that scared me most about that room was the laundry
chute. It was built into the floor, and opened like an ordinary cupboard.
I remember once, I had my toy doll with me when I opened the laundry chute
to look down. Suddenly, as though someone had knocked it from my hand,
the doll flew down the chute and hit the basement floor beside the washing
machine. I began to cry, as my plastic doll had lost a leg in the terrible
accident. I told my mom, and she sent me down to get it. Only, upon searching
the whole laundry room, I found my doll was gone and only a cracked plastic
leg remained. Out of all the rooms in the house that frightened me; the
Guest room, the Study, my father's old room, the master bedroom, the bathroom
and Dining hall, it was the basement that gave me awful nightmares, dreams
and feelings. My dad had told me once his sister had locked him down there
when he was three, and ever since the basement had scared him. I remember
my sister and I would go down there looking at my Gramp's collection of
birds. He not only had tiny china birds, but fish, boats, aeroplanes and
a cat skull that made us quiver. The main room in the basement had a large
TV and two comfy chairs to sit in. But looking down the long tiled hall,
one could see the Bar and pool hall. The bar was an ordinary white counter
with an assorment of old dusty wine and liquor bottles that had not been
open in quite a long time. A huge mirror was behind the bar, which reflected
the back of the counter and whoever walked past it. I had remembered seeing
the reflection of a pale old lady, quivering&nbsp; in the glass as I walked
past. She smiled at me...and I had run so fast I thought I could never
stop. I remembered trying to climb the narrow and steep stair case and
almost tumbling back down. The pool hall was a large room with a pool table
in the center. I deer head was mounted on the wall and beside a bunch of
hanging ducks. Both frightened me, as I was sure I saw them move once,
as though the things were alive begging for freedom. Off the pool room
was my Gramp's "Memory Room" It had pictures and tools from the war in
which he had taught young pilots how to fly. An axe hung from the wall,
which too scared me, as it often was caught swinging back and forth as
though someone had touched it. This room then connected to the bathroom
where a stuffed alligator sat and many dead spiders covered the floor.
This then connected back the laundry room which inturn was a pathway to
the main TV room and stairs, thus ending the terrifying circle. Out of
all I have explained to you, the worst was in the Laundry room. I'm sure
something awful had happened there, as I was loading the laundry when the
light suddenly went out. Groping clumsily through the darkness, I saw a
white form only inches from me. It took form as a horrible grinning skull-like
face, with many sharp teeth. Then the light went on, and I found my self
standing near the wall, almost touching it. Nothing was around me, and
with a sob and ran up the stairs, and only once went down after that with
my sister and friend, where upon, we made it half way into the pool room
and suddenly all three of us bolted up the stairs for a reason we can't
explain. I never went back down and only a couple years later, the house
was sold and my Grandparents moved out.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:madsit@rsihq.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was spending the night with some childhood friends when I was living
in</B>
<BR><B>Ohio.&nbsp; These friends of mine had an exceptionally large house
(compared to</B>
<BR><B>what I was used to) complete with one of those sitting rooms that
has really</B>
<BR><B>nice furniture but no one ever goes in there.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, I was a shy girl growing up and adults I didn't know always</B>
<BR><B>intimidated me, I never wanted to be confronted by any of them and
my</B>
<BR><B>friend's parents were no exception.&nbsp; As the night wore on I
grew more and</B>
<BR><B>more hungry and asked my friend Jennifer if we could grab a snack.&nbsp;
Her</B>
<BR><B>mother was a health nut and didn't allow such things so Jennifer
promised we</B>
<BR><B>would get some food after her parents went to sleep.&nbsp; So later
that night</B>
<BR><B>Jennifer, her sister Julie and I all hung out in their finished
basement</B>
<BR><B>watching movies and doing that weird girlie-communicating (you know</B>
<BR><B>everything's super fast and high-pitched).&nbsp; It must have been
going on</B>
<BR><B>midnight when I reminded Jennifer how hungry I was so could we PLEASE
get</B>
<BR><B>something to eat.</B>
<BR><B>We snuck up the stairs, and as soon as you open their basement door
you're</B>
<BR><B>in the kitchen.&nbsp; JACKPOT!&nbsp; I thought.&nbsp; I quickly
grabbed a bag of chips and</B>
<BR><B>was on my way downstairs when Jennifer mentioned that we needed
some drinks.</B>
<BR><B>I started to walk towards her to give her a hand when the hall light
came</B>
<BR><B>on, letting us know that we were busted and one of her parents were
on their</B>
<BR><B>way to crack some skulls.&nbsp; So instead of doing the smart thing
and running</B>
<BR><B>back down to the basement where we would fake sleeping, we did a
little</B>
<BR><B>Three Stooges dance and ended up in the dining room.&nbsp; Shortly
thereafter the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen light came on and Jennifer walked out telling her father
that it was</B>
<BR><B>just her, she was getting something to drink, and she's going back
to bed.</B>
<BR><B>So there I was, scared of getting in trouble and worried that her
father was</B>
<BR><B>going to walk into the dining room to see if anyone else was hiding
out.&nbsp; So</B>
<BR><B>like a stealth lizard I crawled into their formal sitting room where
I</B>
<BR><B>proceded to hide behind a chair that was up against the corner of
one of the</B>
<BR><B>walls.&nbsp; As I sat there scared out of my mind a dark figure
approached me.</B>
<BR><B>Now the direction in which I was facing was towards these huge windows
where</B>
<BR><B>light was coming in from the street so a black figure would have
been all</B>
<BR><B>that anyone could see no matter what.&nbsp; Anyway, this black figure
approached</B>
<BR><B>me that looked like a small girl, and told me that everything was
ok and I</B>
<BR><B>could go back downstairs now.</B>
<BR><B>This figure didn't frighten me, in fact I was glad that I wasn't
so alone in</B>
<BR><B>that big house.&nbsp; It allowed me to walk back down to the basement
where I saw</B>
<BR><B>Jennifer waiting for me, wondering what took me so long and denying
any</B>
<BR><B>knowledge of me being in her sitting room, and Julie, passed out
on the</B>
<BR><B>sofa.</B>
<BR><B>I never mentioned this to anyone that lived there and even though
I spent</B>
<BR><B>many more nights in that house (always with a prepacked snack) I
never saw</B>
<BR><B>that figure again.</B>
<BR><B>I just thought this was an interesting story and one that I will
never</B>
<BR><B>forget. Thanks for reading!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Child's Voice</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tay_tay3639@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>this happened a few years ago, but i still remember most of what
happened that night. it was around 2 a.m.. my friend and i were sitting
on the bottom bunk of my bed talking about something that we were thinking
about. my younger sister was in the other bedroorm. my mom was a sleep
in the livingroom on the couch. as we were talking we heard a child's voice
scream "mommy! mommy! help me! help me! my friend and i ran out of the
room and to the livingroom. we woke my mom up to see if she had the t.v.
on, because it was on the other side of the bedroom's wall in the corner.
she asured us that she had been asleep and the t.v. kept off. we slowly
made our way back to my room. we went to the corner that the voice came
from and saw a small, plastic doll with blond, curly hair in a blue dress
that we had never seen before laying there.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Enough Already!</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>Most of my experiences have been centered around my home that I have</B>
<BR><B>lived in for the past 20 or so years.&nbsp; I've always had a fascination</B>
<BR><B>with the supernatural in general, but starting around the age of
13, I</B>
<BR><B>believe that fascination was what drew the following things to happen
to</B>
<BR><B>me.</B>
<BR><B>In my bedroom:</B>
<BR><B>Two specific situations come to mind.&nbsp; I was lying in bed one
night when</B>
<BR><B>all of a sudden, something made me wake up.&nbsp; I remember the
room feeling</B>
<BR><B>very still.&nbsp; Out of the shadows, I saw the dark figure of what
appeared</B>
<BR><B>to be a man who then proceeded to walk to the side of my bed.&nbsp;
I tried</B>
<BR><B>to get up and run out of my room, cause let's face it, that's pretty</B>
<BR><B>scary, but my body was like lead...I could not move.&nbsp; I then
asked "is</B>
<BR><B>there someone in my room?"...the reply that I got was what freaked
me</B>
<BR><B>out the most.&nbsp; The dark figure answered "Yessssssssssss".&nbsp;
I know that</B>
<BR><B>sounds really dumb, but I will never ever forget that experience...the</B>
<BR><B>dark figure reached down and put it's hand on my arm...and then,
my body</B>
<BR><B>and my brain connected and I jumped out of my bed, crying in fear
and</B>
<BR><B>after that night, it took me 3 months before I would even go back
in my</B>
<BR><B>room.</B>
<BR><B>Another occurence, which only took place about 2 months ago, was
also in</B>
<BR><B>my bedroom.&nbsp; I was sleeping again when all of a sudden, I felt
someone</B>
<BR><B>pushing my bed to the left...then I felt my sheets being pulled
down.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>tried to rationalize it by telling myself it was a minor earthquake
or</B>
<BR><B>something or a big truck just drove by, anything but what I was
hoping</B>
<BR><B>it wasn't.&nbsp; After listening to the news the next day...no</B>
<BR><B>earthquake...and my family confirmed not feeling the house shake
at</B>
<BR><B>all.</B>
<BR><B>It always seems to be in that part of the house...one day I was
home</B>
<BR><B>alone, getting brushing my teeth in the washroom.&nbsp; My parents
door on</B>
<BR><B>their bedroom is the kind that will not slam shut unless wind blows
it</B>
<BR><B>shut, otherwise, you have to pull it closed.&nbsp; Well....out of
the blue,</B>
<BR><B>their door slammed shut.&nbsp; Being summer, I assumed their bedroom
window</B>
<BR><B>was open...but when I went to close it before leaving, i was shocked
to</B>
<BR><B>find out it was not.&nbsp; I BOLTED out of there really quick after
that.</B>
<BR><B>Although I have had many,&nbsp; many experiences, I'll share one
last one.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>was driving with a friend along this beautiful, historical parkway
about</B>
<BR><B>an hour away from where I live.&nbsp; On the side of the road, just
out of</B>
<BR><B>nowhere, there was a little fenced off area that had a family cemetary</B>
<BR><B>with four headstones in it.&nbsp; It looked so odd situated where
it was and</B>
<BR><B>I was intrigued.&nbsp; We pulled over and I got out and walked into
the</B>
<BR><B>cemetary entrance.&nbsp; At that moment, I was overcome with nausea
like I</B>
<BR><B>had never had before.&nbsp; I couldn't help myself and threw up
right there</B>
<BR><B>(sorry for that colorful description)!&nbsp; As I got up to walk
out,</B>
<BR><B>something in me knew it had something to do with this cemetary.&nbsp;
My</B>
<BR><B>curiosity got the better of me, so we drove to the town hall and</B>
<BR><B>researched these graves, who turned out to be a local famous family
from</B>
<BR><B>long ago.&nbsp; The grave that I fell in front of where I felt sick
was that</B>
<BR><B>of a woman, about my age when she passed, who was sick with influenza</B>
<BR><B>and died in her sleep when she choked on her own vomit.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, those are my experiences...I have lots more I can tell too.</B>
<BR><B>Great website...it's nice to have a place to tell people this stuff
who</B>
<BR><B>don't think you're crazy!</B>
