several other couples thru out our younger years used to go to. Sort of the
make out spot in Branch Brook Park. My boyfriend and I were making out when
something or someone about 7 to 8 feet tall wearing a lumber jack shirt it
looked like came at us. His eyes are evil and his hands are huge. Beware for if
you ever encounter this creature, wild man or whatever that was that night that
I saw may attack you as well. As we were kissing in the car this deranged
animal attacked the car. My boyfriend instructed me to start the car while he
distracted him away from it. I gave him a baseball bat and I was so terrified I
swore it would kill my boyfriend. As it ran into the wooded are of the park it
shreeked so intensely that my hair stood on end and my tears came down. True
story. Beware. Other people I know had it happen to them as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>We
lived in an old farmhouse next to the cemetery. Before moving in we were doing
some remodeling and each nite when we would leave we would make sure all lights
were off. The next evening the light on the second level would be on again. We
would hear footsteps upstairs when only the two of us were there alone. After
renovation the empty bedroom that my two girls used as a playroom would have
toys strewn around and they would deny doing it. They would hear voices as if
we were outside their door whispering. And I would hear &quot;Mommy&quot;
thinking it was one of my girls but they would be in the backyard playing &amp;
had not called me. One night, my husband woke up abruptly sat straight up and
looked in the mirror above the dresser. In the mirror you could look into the
livingroom and he saw a woman walking toward the bedroom in white, thinking it
was me he felt to see if I was in bed. I was so looked back and she was gone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>We
were told that the old farmer who had built the house was distraught that they
were going to build a road through his property he hung himself in the barn
across the street.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Strange
thing happened to people who were owners after us. That playroom was occupied
by their teenage son and his TV would come on by itself. The TV required a pair
of pliers for him to operate it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>times
and he eventually went away. Second encounter was my <o:p></o:p></span></p>

gentelman who use to live accrosst he street from my <o:p></o:p></span></p>

They took trips, went to events together, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>etc.
The gentelman passed away some time ago. My aunt had <o:p></o:p></span></p>

older man in a flannel shirt &amp; jeans looking in the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>window.
Thinking it was a prowler she investigated to find <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>no
one there. Thinking nothing of it she mentioned it to <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>no
one. Later her daughter was at the house doing the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>find

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>few
days before), if she had died. When he was told yes, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>he
said he figured as much as he had seen her in the house <o:p></o:p></span></p>

1989, at that time we had a septic tank installed. My daughters went out to go
to school one morning and at the corner of the property I had planted a Juniper
tree and there was a young boy in suspender jeans picking the berries off of
the tree. As the girls approached him asking him what he was doing, the boy
disipated right in front of their eyes. They screamed and I came out and they
told me what happened. The whole day I was at the home alone and the dogs just
kept barking at the tree all day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

day I was in my room reading. All of the sudden I start hearing laughing and

might be some people outside. I look out my window, i look up and down the
street carefully, I see nothing unusual. The next week it happend again, I do
the same as I did last time. The week following that again it happens, it was
the same exact sound as the times before. I start to wonder so i go outside on
the sidewalk the sound is still continuing, I take a good look and I still see
nothing. Heres the even more freaky part, This happens evey saturday around the

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'> with my dad and step
mom. Alright, down to business. We've lived in our current house for almost two
full years now and up until recently everything was normal. About a month ago
my step mom tells me that she saw a ghost in the dining room (she's not afraid
of them, she's seen a few others before this one, and she's even said good
morning to this one), but I thought she was joking. She told me what he did and
described his looks too. I still thought she was pulling my chain. UNTIL a few
hours ago. I was in the laundry room when I looked out the window and saw a man
walk right past the window. Now mind you, we're a gun toting family. So I went
to the closet with the guns (in laundry room) and grabbed an unloaded rifle to
scare the intruder off. When I went into the dining room he was standing right
outside the sliding glass door to the deck outside. He was a stalky, but not
fat man with a regular hat and a flannel jacket and jeans. He had dark brown
hair with a good amount of facial hair. Picture a construction/rail/trucker
worker from maybe the 70's or 80's. With him was a medium sized black lab. Then
he made a motion of opening a door, but he wasn't grabbing anything at all. He
was grabbing more toward the center of the class door. We do know this house
was remodled before we moved in. Then he walks through the closed sliding door
and into the dining room. During all of this I am frozen with disbelief and
stunned and he's not even looking at me (I don't think he could see me at all).
As soon as he got into the house he started to fade. He made it about 7 feet
before totally disappearing. I described it to my step mom when she got home,
and she said it was the same man, and that what he did is the same thing every
time. She thinks the man was killed in a car wreck while he was on his way home
and thats why he keeps returning here and vanishing when inside. We haven't dug
up any info yet, but we think this used to be his house. After it was over, I
went to the couch, sat down and just spaced out. I was pretty freaked out. When
I turned to look at the clock, I saw that I'd been thinking about what had
happened for over 2 1/2 hours<o:p></o:p></span></p>

used to live in a old pub, where a great murderer lived. He murdered many
people and when the police went looking for him he would hide in a tunnel under
the house that used to be a path where slaves would escape like the underground
railroad. He kept supposedly hearing the voices of his victims. He went crazy
and hung himself. So I was taping a documentary for my college on how old the
house was when my camera (which was brand new and with full batteries) shut
off. My friend had her digital camera and took a picture of me. She got out her
tape recorder and asked &quot;What do you want?&quot; Later we looked at the
pictures and a bloody face was peering at me with a astonished face. It was
probably one of his mutilated victims. When she played back the tape recorder
after she asked what he wanted it said &quot;Get out!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>1.
I had this dream early May of 1992. In it I was standing outside at my
Grandparent's house and it was almost dark. The sky was gray as if it was about
to storm and the wind was warm and blowing. Suddenly, a coroner wagon pulled
into the neighbor's yard and the coroner got out and asked my Grandfather to
help in removal of the body, to which he did. I thought that the husband of my
Grandfather's double first cousin had died and they removed him on a gurney
under a white sheet. Well, when they walked past me...his hand fell out from
under the sheet. Next, it was later and dark outside. I thought I was in my
Grandparent's house and I was sitting at the table and looking out the sliding
glass door. Then, I saw the man who had died earlier walk slowly up the
driveway with his wife behind him. They came inside and his wife was so happy
to have him back that she kept saying, &quot;Oh look! He is back!&quot; Then,
she touched his forehead and looked around in fear...and ran out the door. Then
my family said, &quot;Oh dear Lord, no!&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>However, the man paid them no heed...he looked at me and walked towards
me. Then I noticed that it wasn't really who I thought it was but a different
man. He wore black rimmed glasses and a brown flannel shirt with pants. I woke
up freaked out over the dream. Later that same month the man who I thought was
dead...actually died in real life! Next, in Sept. that year, my Aunt's Dad died
and when I we to look at him in the casket...he had black rimmed glasses and a
brown flannel shirt with pants!!!! I left the funeral home white as a sheet. I
instantly thought of the dream.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>2.My
Grandmother (who is a very level headed and sensible person) had a very strange
thing happen to her three nights in a <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>row.
In 1996, in June, she had to be put into the hospital for her leg. Well, that
night we all got a an urgent phone call from the nurse and we rushed to be by
my grandmother's side.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
had never seen her so afraid in my life! It frightened me. So, I knew that she
had to have seen something strange...I sat down by her bedside and asked her to
talk about it. She told me that in the next room there had been a lady walking
around like she was busy cleaning or something. No one seemed to notice this
woman except my Grandmother. So, she asked the nurse who she was...the nurse
assured her that no one was there!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Second
night-the same thing happened. Only this time the lady slowly turned to face
her......<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>third
night-the lady turned around and my Grandmother swore that<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>her face was blurred out! But the woman
physically turned a fan off! Where her face should've been was a blur!! So, My
Grandmother was scared. However, she got up the nerve to wave to the
woman.....but she said the lady did not wave back -and she got the distinct
impression that the lady was sad. This scared the crap out of me!! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>3.In
May of 1991, I was sitting on my porch in bright sunshine....<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>When
out of the corner of my eye I saw a big black reaper figure. It was over six
feet tall and it just stood there. I could see the folds in it's robes! So, I
looked again and it was gone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Later
that day a woman who lived up the road from us shot and killed her husband!! I
was creeped out pretty badly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>4.This
is about an object I saw. My Brother had just introduced me to his friend in
July 1992. (This is the same friend who heard the growl in his hallway) Well,
the 3 of us were walking towards my brother's and my house, talking, as it was
getting late.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>We
had to walk thru an alley which had a train track on a hill (not too big of a
hill) Across the track on our left, there was a house with a hedge there. I
looked at the hedge and saw the creepiest<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>thing!! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>It
was a big round globe-like thing (looked like the planet saturn) on a long
black robe! As we passed this house it turned and watched us go!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
brother looked but saw a black robed figure sitting on the train tracks(nothing
in on the hedge!) Our friend saw a flash of white light in the tree tops. All
of us were looking athe same place and NONE of us saw the exact same thing!!
This scares me to this day!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We still
don't know what it was or why we saw what we did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>It
woke him up! He drew a picture of a coffin <o:p></o:p></span></p>

tried to make us understand what he was shown.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>was
deep in conversation with someone. I watched him <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>talking
to nothing! So, I went out there to ask him <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Mother has dreams of death and they usually come true. If she dreams of
caskets, someone dies. In 1986, she dreamt of attending a funeral and crying
what seemed like buckets of tears. She saw her Father in a brown suit and saw
her Sister.in.law bring in a plate of fried chicken on a blue willow plate. In
the blue casket was her uncle who looked much younger. In 1987, Mom lost her
husband to a Heart attack....he was put in a blue casket. Her Dad wore a brown
suit...and she watched her Sister.in.law bring in fried chicken on a blue
willow plate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the only resident per-se of the house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Right away I noticed shadows that moved when they shouldnt and things
being moved to where I hadnt placed them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>While moving in, I had a heavy box move from the center of the living
room floor to just behind the front door in the two seconds I was outside
getting another box out of the car.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
was not married at the time and therefor was moving in without help, so that
narrowed down the list of potential box movers to either my fifteen- pound Jack
Russell Terrier or an unknown party.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
also noticed immediately that my dog was extremely apprehensive about going
into the bedroom or study (once used as a nursery) without me being in tow and
he refused to go into the basemen-- ever.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Even when I carried him down the stairs to show him it was okay, he
whimpered and bolted back to the top the second I released him.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This wasnt really that surprising to me
though, being<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>sensitive to these
things for most my life, I-- like my pup-- sensed that the basement was a little
overwhelming, claustrophobic even, although it was probably 500 square feet of
empty space.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, I was never really
scared of the basement, I just felt like it was a sad place.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This feeling of sadness seemed to mainly
concentrate around an old woodworking table that was bolted to the wall on the
south side of the basement (another identical table was placed and bolted to
the outside of the house directly under the bedroom window).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>About
a month after moving in, I found out from a neighbor who had lived in his
next-door residence since it was built (also in the 1930s) that the original
owner of my house had been an avid woodworker-- and had in fact done most of
the woodwork in the house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Im not sure
if he died in the house, but the neighbor also told me the old owner had died
in a pretty sad way.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I believe he told
me it was cancer, or some kind of blood disease and that it had been really
hard for him to come to terms with his impending death.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Once I found this information out, it was
like the proverbial door was opened to this ghosts presence.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Within days of talking to the neighbor, I
began hearing banging, and what could only be described as sawing and chiseling
noises coming from both the basement and outside the bedroom window.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The noises seemed to center, like the sad
feeling in the basement, around the proximity of the tables (there were no
tools on, or near the tables, incidentally), and happened mainly between the
hours of </span><st1:time Minute="0" Hour="22"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 font-family:Arial;color:white'>10 p.m.</span></st1:time><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'> and </span><st1:time
Minute="0" Hour="2"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>2
 a.m.</span></st1:time><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:white'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I can only guess the guy
had been a bit of a night owl and like to spend it working.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>There
was also another spirit, or presence, in the house that I never got any
background on, but was obviously that of a little girl, probably 9 or 10 years
of age, who liked to skip through the living room and hum unrecognizable
tunes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This, like the old owners
presence, was an auditory occurrence and was never visualized, but the opposite
of the old owners ghostliked to make herself heard in the daylight hours.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>What
was odd about these happenings was that it wasnt something that happened to
only me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A lot of times in the past (and
present), when I became aware of various paranormal happenings, I was (am) the
only one who saw, heard, felt, or smelled the presence (at least the only one
who would fess up to it).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, these
particular occurrences seemed to happen just as often when there was an
audience, or not.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My mother (a born
skeptic) heard the banging outside my bedroom window over the phone.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My nephew heard and was frightened by the
little girl regularly and an old boyfriend (which the ghosts wisely disliked)
was chased out of the house more than once by both the old owners presence and
the girl-- who apparently liked to giggle behind him for added spookies.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As a matter of fact, one of the spirits also
liked to set smoke/ c.o. detectors off whenever this particular ex-boyfriend
was aroundonce when the c.o. detector was unplugged, battery-less and tucked
away in a drawer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>There
were other physical manifestations as well.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>An old skeleton key that fit the back door was constantly winding up in
the freezer or toilet tank and both the basement door and the front door were
very difficult to keep locked.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I would
lock them, go to bed and wake up with both doors either unlocked, or wide
open-- not real funny in that part of town.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Personal items would disappear for a few days, but would reappear right
in the middle of whatever room they had been taken from about five seconds
after I would give up looking.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There
were also, occasional temperature fluctuations, when a rooms temp would
suddenly drop a good 10 or 12 degrees in a matter of seconds for no reason.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>All
in all, it was a pretty strange place to live, it didnt really bother me
though, because like I said, these things seem to happen to me a lot (I grew up
in a house that was a lot worse).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A few
months after moving out, my Grandmother got a call from the man who moved into
the house after me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He wanted to know if
I had any problems with the house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>When my Grandmother asked him what kind of problems, he got real
flustered and said something about his dog running away over and over again,
then he changed the subject and got off the phone with her.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I figured the house was still making itself
known as previously inhabited even after I left.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

when I see something out of place I notice it. As I got closer I noticed <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>it
was a girl standing in the ditch, with a sweater tied around her <o:p></o:p></span></p>

with those clothes on a very secluded road. The closer I got I began to <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>notice
that she was turned away from me with her head<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>to

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>the

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>passed
her maybe ten feet I back up and she was gone. I got my flashlight <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>and
got out of the truck to see where she went and to see if she needed <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>help.
She was gone nowhere to be found I looked in the ditch where she was <o:p></o:p></span></p>

there were no footprints and no scuff marks on the ditch bank to <o:p></o:p></span></p>

door, a distant yelling, glass candle holder shattering on my kitchen floor
without me hearing a thing, my cat wigging out growling at nothing,hearing
footsteps in the kitchen when nobody was in there, smelling smoke like our
house was on fire type smoke. my husband and I freaked out we looked everywhere
for the smoke we even went out side to see if someone was burning garbage...nothing.My
lights in my kitchen will flicker off and on. and I've only seen something
once. It was a ball of light.about the size of a baseball. I watched it,but it
did not move..it just kind of faded away.these things happen right around
october-janurary then they tend to stop. My babysitter doesn't like to come
over here this time of year..I'm not even joking..I tried calling her last
weekend..no call back. She experienced banging on the walls and could not
explain where it was coming from. She got mad at me for not telling her the

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>When
I was 16 years old a bunch of friends and I went to the green lady
cemetary.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were only there for a few
minutes and everyone started feeling really uneasy, I dont know exactly why,
but we all decided it was time to leave.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As we were leaving I was told that I should kiss the grave of the green
lady to show my respect.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I of course
refused &quot;to put my lips on that thing&quot; So we all left.I believe there
was 5 of us that night, We had taken 2 cars, I was driving one of them.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had 2 people in the car with me, 1 in the
front and one in the back, well as we were headed down the dirt road, I kid you
not, it felt like something pulled the car I was driving way off to the left
and we hit a tree head on.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now keep in
mind I was the ONLY one who did not kiss the supposed grave of the green lady, I
was also the only one who DID wear a seatbelt, I was also the only one hurt at
all.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No one else even had a bump or
scratch on them, I however got my front teeth smashed to the back of my mouth,
and was bleeding profusley.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I ended up
having emergency surgury on my upper jaw(while I was awake) So I have to say I
am a firm believer, in ghosts and there ability to harm the living if they feel
like it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
am 31 now, but this experience happend to me when I was about 21.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My boyfriend ( now husband) lived in a really
old house that he shared with two other bachelor buddies.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My husband's parents had helped them fix it
up pretty nice &amp; it became quite the &quot;cool hangout&quot; for the
college crowd.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This house is located in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Indiana</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'> by the way.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have no way of knowing if it is still
standing because everyone involved in this story has since moved away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Anyway,
the guys lived there for about two years &amp; during that time period, very
strange things happend.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When everyone
was &quot;remodeling&quot; the place after it had just been purchased, we found
strange writings in the basement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Very
profane and nasty, that I am not sure I can print on this site. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>You
get the idea.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>animal bones were also
found.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>very strange.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>No
one ever really went into the basement and the door stayed locked all of the
time, same as the attic.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The attic was
the old fashioned kind in which you can actually walk up stairs and go
into.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No one ever went up there.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One of the reasons was because we could hear
VERY loud noises, like furniture being moved and dragged around up there. That
was very strange because there was absolutely nothing up there.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were also loud pounding and banging
noises late at night.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I heard then when
me &amp; my boyfriend (husband) were the only ones home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Also,
the guys had converted one of the rooms into a &quot;game&quot; room with dart
board, pool table, etc.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Late at night,
you could hear balls being rolled around on the pool table.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now, this is nothing unusual, considering
several college guys lived there, however, when one of the men got up to tell
everyone to be quite, he had to work early the next a.m., there was no one in
there, balls in pockets, lights out, absolutely no activitiy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When he discussed this with the other
roommates, they admitted the same had happend to them at one time or another.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Another
freaky occurance was after a party and everyone had gone home or gone to
bed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A party guest who had had too much
to drink and spent the night got up early in the a.m. to get some water &amp;
walked passed a strange looking man sitting in a chair ( in the game room).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The party guest said a quick cheerful &quot;hey,
man,how's it goin&quot; and the man just looked at him with a hollow
stare.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The party guest went on about
business and when he was on his way through the game room back to go to sleep,
the strange man was gone!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>There
was this one particular bedroom that no one liked.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Everyone kept switching it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I think everyone traded and had it at least
once.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No one could really put their
finger on why they didn't like sleeping there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But one of the roommates swore that one night he awoke to a swift, hard
kick to the side of his bed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He said it
shook his entire bed and startled him so bad, he stayed awake for hours after
that, afraid to move.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Weird.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Anyway,
this is my story.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hope it was enjoyed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
have a real experience I just thought I would add. This really happened to my
aunt, my best friend and my self.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
grandmother was having difficulties and was in this hospital so my aunt Gail
came down to visit. So she was just staying at my grandmothers house. Well my
aunt was telling me some neat experiences she has had with the ouija board,
seances, and meditations. I like to think my aunt has some sort of ...well
something that attracts these sort of experiences.. whatever it may be. I
thought it was all facinating and wanted to get in on the experiences...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>So
she offered to have me and one of my best friends, Jess stay the night with her
- Keep in mind it was only us three in the house that night - So we all ate
supper and got ready to do my first meditation of the night. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>We
all had this weird feeling about my grandma's room so we made sure we shut that
door. Which the hall can be seen from the dining room/kitchen. Also down the
hall is a TV room, and another bedroom next to my grandmothers, and a bathroom.
(just to give you an idea of the surroundings) My aunt had me and Jess go all
around the house and shutting cabinets, drawers, ect. Making sure nothing is
out of place, so that way we will know if something is moved or rearranged. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>So
that night we all sat around in the living room, all the lights were off except
one in the kitchen...which gave off a little light to the living room. We had
also lit one candle because my aunt told us that our 'spiritual guides' like
the natural lighting. We all sat either with our legs crossed, with our hands
palms up relaxing on our knees, and our eyes closed. And we are all totally
relaxed and calm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Now
there are many different ways to meditate..but my aunt thinks the easiest is
the emerald one. This is where you picture an emerald light all around you and
then you will feel it enter through your abdomen and throughout your body.
after that you will picture yourself on a boat, and you will be in some rough
water, this is said to be your stress. And you will then come to calm waters.
But you cannot force yourself, you will just enter the calm waters...then you
can talk to your spiritual guide, talk to the dead (which my grandpa is dead)
and so on. I guess it's kinda like a half dream sort of place. ...and again
this is to give you an idea of what we were doing that night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Well,
as we were meditating... we heard all kinds of movement in the basement. Items
clinging together, footsteps, and heartbeats. I can remember my grandpa always
being down stairs messing with his tools and working on his old cars. When we
woke up my aunt had said she was trying to talk to my grandpa.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and almost right after that we got a phone
call saying my grandma almost had a heart attack. Weird, huh?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Well
a little while later my aunt went to sleep on the living room couch. Jess and I
decided to stay up and try this meditation stuff some more. So we sat in the tv
room. This time with no lighting. We shut the door and sat on the couch. Well
not even five minutes into it. Jess just says, &quot;what?&quot; At that point
I immediately told her to turn the light on. She said someone or something had
placed their hand firmly on her arm that I was sitting by. We were both spooked
but we wanted to see more - I guess we're a little gutsy now huh?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Before
we had done it a second time we figured we needed to take a break and watch a
little tv. Well we heard movement in the kitchen. Like silverware hitting glass
with force. We immediately went straight to the kitchen..To find my aunt still
asleep on the couch in the next room. And in the sink was a glass with a spoon
in side of it. We then woke my aunt up and told her about the experience with
the hand and the spoon hitting the glass.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She then told us that she heard a mans voice say her name and woke her
half way up til we woke her up the rest of the way. She stayed up with us for a
while. And we decided to meditate once more before she went back to bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>This
time we were getting cold breezes blow past us and it would be cool in just
certain spots.. Then we started hearing this old time door stops that make a
noise if you flip it back.. Sort of makes a long dong sound. We would hear this
coming from all around the house. We would even stop meditating and we would
hear the dong. I even checked the doorstop, flicked, and it made the EXACT same
sound. And if it was just us three in the house...who else could it have been.
Well my aunt thought she needed to go back to bed so she did so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
friend Jess and I dared to meditate once again.. So the lights were off and we
started in. At this point my aunt was thought to be asleep in the living room.
And about 10 minutes in the this meditation we heard foot steps coming toward
the door and then just sort of shuffling right in front of it. We called for my
aunt Gail and the foot steps stopped.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
immediately turned on the lights. But still stayed in the TV room. we were both
just sitting on the couch when we heard and seen the door shaking like
crazy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(the investigator I am, the next
day of course, shut the door, and tried shaking the door from the outside to
see if it made the same noise. Nothing at all.. I then shook it from the inside
and it made the exact same noise. That was a bit frightening to me.) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Then
before we went to bed we were going to try meditating once more. I guess we
were wanting to get scared who knows lol! But once we got into it we heard something
crash against the wall and just kind of slide back and forth on it. Now my
grandma has all kinds of family pictures hanging on the wall behind the couch.
Well the next day I was testing everything out to see what could have made the
noise...and the one picture that stood out made the most alike sounding noise
was my aunt gail's photo. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>And
still yet all that night we heard the dongs.. Cabinets were opened, drawers
were opened, closet doors were opened, items were moved...There was a lot more
that happened that night but this is long already. If you would like to know
more you may contact me. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Another
thing that was strange is that all the noises and happenings quit after my aunt
gail left. What ever it was, I don't think it was trying to hurt us, just give
us a scare.. AND THAT IT DID!!!!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

my name is Aubry, and me and my family beilive this house is haunted. Everyone
in our house except my brother had seen something or experienced something.
First of all my mom was home alone all by herself one day and she kept telling
herself i need to do laundry, and after a few minutes the washing machin
started up all my itself. then one night when i was lying in my bed i was half
awake and helf asleep and i looked up and thought i saw someone sitting on my
bed, i thought it was my sisters boyfriend or something, then i just bilinked
my eyes and it was gone, i also saw it one day from my room, i saw something
walk into my brothers room, and when i went in there he was asleep. My dad also
saw it when he was in the living room<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>watching tv, he saw somthing walk in the back room, but he was home
alone, and there have been many more little experiences. Just last night, my
family was carving pumpkins and my mom took a picture of my dad and my cousin,
and we actually got a picture of what we have been seeing, we can see her face,
and her arm reaching out towards my cousin, it looks like she is wearing a long
white dress or something, it is what we have all been describing, there are
also circles of light in the background, i believe they are called orbs? We
believe she is a good spirit, so we are happy with her.<span

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'> on lake Huron, about 10
miles south of Alpena, in 1955. I am 33 and have gone up for the summer almost
every year of my life so far. My friend Donnie, who was a month older than me,
lived two doors down from us and was a year round resident. His Grandpa,
Charlie, died when we were around seven. His parents divorced colse to a year
later. When his Dad, who Charlie never liked, moved out of the house, he fell
down the stairs from the 2nd floor to the 1st floor landing. He wasn't hurt,
but swore he was pushed from behind, although nobody was upstairs at the time.
Over the next few years, Donnie and his Mom, Janet, became convinced that not
only did they have a spirit living with them, but it was Charlie. Charlie
smoked a pipe that he lit with matches, and Janet would sometimes wake up to
the smell of a burnt match in her room. The washer and dryer would turn on by
themselves and repairmen could never find any problems with the machines. One
week their fireplace lit up by itself several times and they called out the gas
company to investigate. When the serviceman stuck his head in the fireplace, he
found a gas leak coming from under the house stated flatly that if they had lit
a fire, it would have blown the house to toothpicks. Soon, Charlie began to
manifest as a visible shadowy form of a man. Donnie could sometimes feel
someone sitting at the end of his bed and could see a shadowy figure there.
This didn't bother him arter a few instances because he figured it was his
Grandpa watching over him. He became so common place to them that they hardly paid
attention to him, even though he would often cross the living room and
disappear into the kitchen. Although I wouldn't go into the house at night, I
was still a little skeptical, having never seen anything unusual myself. But
one afternoon, when I was about 13, Donnie, my brother, myself and a neighbor
girl from next door came up from the beach to get some snacks at Donnie's
house. I had no fear of the house in the daytime, and actually hadn't even
given a thought to Charlie. The neighbor girl was cute and my age and while my
brother and Don got some pop from the refrigerator, I talked to her at the
bottow of the stairs. I began to hear footsteps walking around upstairs, but
was more interested in the girl than the source of the steps.Then the steps reached
the top of the stair, and began to come down. I casually turned to see who was
coming and I saw him. The form of a man was walking down towards us. It was
like a 3D shadow, that looked kind of sparkly, like the snow on channel 3 with
the contrast turned down very low. It continued to descend and the realization
of what I was seeing kicked in. I screamed at the top of my lungs and ran
through the storm door without stopping to open it, and didn't stop running
until I reached lake Huron ( around 150 yards )<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I turned around half expecting to see Charlie behind me, but instead saw
the neighbor girl coming right behind me. Then she asked me &quot; did you see
that &quot;? I couldn't respond and slowly walked back to my cottage. When I
walked in the door, my Mom looked at me and said &quot; what's wrong with you?
You look like you've seen a ghost&quot;. I broke down, locked myself in a
bedroom and cried for half an hour before I could even talk about it. It took
several years before I had the courage to go back into the house. When Donnie
was in his twentys he left home to join the Coast Guard and Charlie's
appearances became few and far between. Janet sold the house about ten years
ago, and the new occupants have never had any out of the ordinary experiances.
I haven't seen anything else since then, but if I read anything about real
ghost sightings or see ghostly footage on T.V., my eyes will uncontrollably
water to the point of tearing over.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'> a few years ago, and
one night my traveling companion and I thought it woud be fun to stay in a real
medieval castle. I had done a little research prior to the trip and came across
Charleville castle on accident while browsing websites. Apparently it is the
most haunted castle in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Ireland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>, built on a druid
burial ground and the former home of the Earl of Charleville (the head of a
masonic satanic cult, a slavetrader, and an Englishman who tortured and killed
hundreds of Irishmen in his dungeons).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
honestly don't remember what I was thinking when i first read about the castle,
but it was more along the lines of excitement than fear. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>When
we got there we first discovered that it wasn't a hotel or even very fit to
live in, althought a few people who were involved in a renovation project
stayed every now and then to help. Most of the time they left at nightfall to
go back and stay in town. I was met by a very nice Australian women who had
come there a month ago and ended up falling in love with the place (it is very
beautiful to observe during the day). She did howeer mention a few rules for
staying there over night: never light candles because the ghosts like to tip
them over. Close your door at night (she didn't say why), and ster clear of the
dungeons. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>On
our tour (just at the beginning of sundown), we went up to the towers where our
lantern mysteriously disappeared, only to be found in a totally different part
of the castle later on. Our guide shruged it off as normal and added that a
litle girl died there from a fall off a staircase and she sometimes liked to
tease guests by misplacing their things. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Upon
entering the dungeons (very briefly), which were essentially holes in the
ground, I immediately began to feel like something was pressing down on my
chest. It was a terribly sad place and vey hard to breath in. The most unusual
thing was the inky blackness that our flashlights couldn't penetrate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>That
night I couldn't sleep. I was irritated that my friend just hit the pillow and
collapsed into snores, but I had this horribly terrified feeling like I was
waiting for something that I didn't want to have happen. Te room we were in was
called the red room, by the way, because of the many infant deaths that had
occured there...our guide said children's laughing and crying was often heard
there in the night. However,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Iheard
nothing at first save for a few doors creaking. Around 4 in the morning I began
to hear whispering, laughing, running up and down the stairways (which was
impossible due to the delapitation of many of them, and the fact that they were
so narrow). But the scariest thing happened around </span><st1:time Minute="30"
Hour="16"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>4:30</span></st1:time><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'> when it sounded like
someone took a tray of dishes and smashed them against our door. My friend
continued snoring but I jumped and burried my head in my pillow. Somehow I got
hte courage to get up though, and when i opened my door I discovered there was
nothing there, not one broken dish. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
next morning we left and I felt like a piece of me was missing. I can't explain
it really. Even though my experience was really spooky and emotional at times,
I still felt like I was being torn from something. Mark my words, someday Ihave
to go back there and find out what that castle is really all about.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
was so proud of my new home we had just purchased in October of 2000. This was
our first home and our 3 year old daughter was so excited to finally get a big
bedroom. We spent the first few weeks just emptying boxes and hanging up
pictures. Then it started to happen. About three weeks after we moved in, I
started hearing foot steps walking up and down our long hall that leads to our
bedroom. The first few times I would jump out of bed thinking that my daughter
had gotten out of bed to use the bathroom, but no one was ever there. I had
mentioned it to my husband a few times and he just said that I was just not
used to the old house noises. I grew up in a home with a spirit of a young girl
that had died from falling off of a horse in the apple orchard, where our house
was built and I knew the difference between old house noises and foot steps.
Since I was familiar to things not being what they seemed, it didn't bother me.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Until
one night, when my stepdaughter was visiting, she and I had fallen asleep on my
bed watching a movie. Sometime in the middle of the night, I was awoken by a
pressured feeling on my shoulder. I opened my eyes thinking it was my husband
needing something and the next thing I knew I was up on both of my feet, as if
I was picked up by the pit of my arms and thrown into the large wall mirror
which is mounted about 6 feet away from the bottom right corner of the bed. My
right hand hit to frame of the mirror so hard that it sliced right through the
skin and started to bleed. I cleaned up the cut and shook it off as a bad dream
and went back to bed. The next morning we all just laughed about the it at
breakfast.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>For
a few months after that, I would still hear the foot steps up and down the
hall. I would occasionally mention it to my husband and he would just smile at
me until the night came that my husband and I were lying in bed talking and the
foot steps started up shortly after </span><st1:time Minute="0" Hour="11"><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>11:00</span></st1:time><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>. At first he wasn't
sure what he was hearing. He muted the television and tried to listen and
figure out what the sound was. I just sat there and smiled at him. Then I
finally said &quot;are you hearing the footsteps now&quot;? He gave me this
puzzled look and leapt out of bed running down the hall looking for an
intruder. I just sat there waiting for him to come back into the bedroom. When
he finally did, he said that there was no one there and he couldn't figure out
where on earth that noise was coming from. I smiled. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>About
six months into our new/old home, the foot steps either became less and less or
I was just getting used to them, until I got the scare of my life. I had been
asleep on my stomach and was woken up to this very heavy feeling on my body. As
if a grown man was lying on me, not letting me move or get up. I had tried to
gasp for breath, but I couldn't move. Finally, after what seemed to be hours
but was probably only seconds, the weight was lifted and I could move. Out of
pure fear, I rolled out from under the covers on to the floor, on my hands and
knees gasping for air. It took a minute my breath to catch up to me, from the
pressure or just pure fear, I don't know. When I did get air back in to my
lungs I let out a slight scream for my husband, waking him up just in time for
the heavy pressure to come over me again, pushing me to the floor. My husband,
slowly waking up out of a sound sleep noticed I was not next to him, but
wondering where the sound was coming from, leaned over my side of the bed,
seeing me on the floor. With a light outside the window shining on to my face,
he could see the look of horror. At that point, he leapt off the bed over to my
side and pulled me up off of the floor as if I had just fallen out of bed
during a dream. We sat in bed for a few moments talking about what I thought
just happened to me. I told my husband that what he said was probably right and
that I must have just had a bad dream. At that point, he fell back to sleep but
I stayed up the rest of the night trying to figure out what exactly did happen
and what I could do about it. At this point I was so angry about this
&quot;thing&quot; that I was determined not to let anything like that happen
again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Some
time had passed and I was over the events of that night. I had noticed though
that small things were beginning to happen. Like my toothbrush being in the
hairbrush drawer and the rug in the hall being rolled up at one end when no one
was home except me. I finally started to get smart. I started talking to it. I
started talking to it on a daily basis. I told it that no matter what, this is
my house now and that if it thinks it is going to do something to me or my
daughter, that I would make what ever life it thought it had here so miserable
that it would be sorry and would pay. When I heard the steps in the hall, I
would get out of bed and walk down the hall practically picketing the foot
steps. I threatened it everyday. If anything it made me feel better and
stronger. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Then
one morning while I was giving my daughter breakfast, she mentioned that she
had seen a man in her doorway the night before. That was it. That was the last
straw. After I dropped my daughter off a daycare, I came back to the house and
started yelling at it and threatening it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>For
some strange reason, it seemed to work. Months went by and then years and other
than a few occasional foot steps in the hall, I have not heard from our past
tenant in years. I know that this is not much of an ending to the story, but
this is pretty much how it happened. I guess some of us just have a little more
power than we think we do. Especially a protective Mom of a young child! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>What
brings me to this website to tell my story is...<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not too long ago I found out through
neighbors that the man that built this home in the 40's had passed away about
20 days after we purchased it. Now that is just too coincidental, isn't it!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a good look at what a neglected and vandalized condition the place<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>found
the front door of the house lying wide open, with a huge pipe<o:p></o:p></span></p>

(it was a windless, hot fall day), *MUCH* too cool, in fact --<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>but
at that time neither of us were yet aware of the possible<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>significance
of that sensation, so we kept on exploring.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Every room<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>in
the house had its door flung wide open, or ripped out all together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>And
the interior of the house was a very &quot;open&quot; space, in that you<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>could
essentially see all the way through the house by standing at<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>either

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>only
closed door in the house, and we approached it cautiously, since<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>we
were still kids, after all, and given the wrecked condition of the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>place
we didn't know what to expect, or who.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As I opened the door<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>slowly,

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>also

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>that
the bathroom was empty.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So I began to
open the bathroom door all<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>the
way.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And that's when it happened.
Something pushed back against<o:p></o:p></span></p>

door, from the other side -- and HARD.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So hard, in fact, that the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

there, scared out of our wits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>After
a few days, we calmed down enough to try to logically sort out<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>what
we saw (or rather, *didn't* see) in that bathroom.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>was

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
would swear that the large cracked mirrors on the walls in there<o:p></o:p></span></p>

me a complete view of the bathroom, including behind its<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was no one (alive, that is) in that
bathroom when the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

slammed in our faces, and there was no wind that day, to account<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>for
the door's behavior.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only other
explanations we could think<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>of
was that either the door had one of those automatic door-closing<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>mechanisms
like those on screen porch doors, or some heavy, already<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>loose

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>courage
to go back in that house to try to figure it out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>As
before, we jumped the fence in the back, and entered the house<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the bathroom from the reflections cast on its cracked mirrors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

said he would show me, although he seemed reluctant.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
pool's about half a mile back into a bamboo forest in between my friend's house
and River Farm (George Washington's Estate on the </span><st1:place><span

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When we got there it was extremely silent. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>I could see the pool through the fence.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The shallow end was closest, the bathrooms on
the right, and a shed and diving board platform on the other side (the diving
board had been taken off.)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My friend
crouched down and crawled through a hole in the fence about 2 feet high.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As soon as he entered the wind picked up
slightly and when i entered it was howling.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The temperature immediately dropped at least degrees.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It had been a warm summer day, but now my
arms were covered in goosebumps and the hairs on the back of my neck stood on
end.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was a fallen tree on top of
the boys bathroom.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I touched it and it
was ice cold.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I climbed up on the roof
and looked through a broken window down into the bathroom.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My friend went in.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I heard a howling, it was definitely not the
wind, nor a dog in the distance, it was an eerie whistling coming faintly form
inside the bathroom.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I heard my friend
run out.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I climbed down quickly not
feeling comfortable above the bathroom.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We then both entered the girls bathroom.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As soon as we set foot, we heard the bushes outside rustle one by one
and then die off, as if a warning.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
continued inside and to a cracked mirror.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He looked in first.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He got
goosebumps all over.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He didn't tell me
what happened.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I looked in.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My face was bone white and
semi-transparent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I asked my friend if I
was pale.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He said &quot;Am I?&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I told him no, his face was normal, although
he was getting slightly pale in the cheeks, though nowhere near as pale as I
had seen myself.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He confirmed that I was
normal as well, though slightly pale in the cheeks.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We quickly left the bathroom.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We headed toward the deep end wanting to
quickly check out the shed before leaving.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>My friend looked inside and immediately became petrified, his face turn
extremely pale.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He then suddenly stood
up and bolted to the side of the pool opposite the bathrooms and hid in a patch
of bamboo.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I quickly followed and asked
what was wrong.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Before I finished he
shushed me then whispered that he had seen two glowing red globes, as he described
them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were about to make a break for
the hole in the fence through the bamboo hanging through the fence as
cover.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But we heard a thumping.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>First we thought it was the supposed
&quot;caretaker&quot; of the pool who lived alone in the forest in an old house.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then it got louder.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It sounded at first like steps of a giant
coming toward the pool.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the thumping
took the rhythym of a heartbeat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At this
point, the wind was much too loud for me to be hearing my own heartbeat.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I checked it to make sure.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was beating intensely.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The thumping was loud and slow.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It got faster and louder.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The second it stopped my friend and I bolted
for the hole and dove through.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We heard
the beating again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My friend was running
slow as movement was limited by the thick bamboo.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I rushed him as I was in the back and
terrified of what might be following us (the beat was louder and faster, and
only increasing).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I looked back,
nothing, then to my left and in a clearing was an extremely thick tree, I did a
double-take and when I looked back, aI thought I saw a face, and pushed my
friend up the rock he was stumbling up.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I took one hop and landed on a wet spot.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>When I slipped my leg was sliced open by an extremely jagged point of a
piece of broken bamboo, it didnt bleed at all.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was the cleanest cut I have ever seen. From there it was easy ground
and we sprinted back to the house and rushed inside and locked the door.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Peeking out the windows every few minutes
toward the forest.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Just as the warmth
inside hit me, my leg started bleeding heavily.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The cut was about 2-3 inches long, and the cleanest cut I have ever
seen.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have the scar till this
day.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have not had any more experiences
other than an urge to return to the pool, and my friends stories of the same
occurences when he went back with another friend.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Same red globes, same beating, and howling,
but then bamboo falling right behind them as they entered a clearing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

HOUSE I LIVED IN IN MONTGOMERY ALABAMA SEEMED TO BE BLESSED WITH SOME KIND OF
SPIRITS. I USED TO WAKE UP WITH someone SAYING MY NAME. I AM A VERY LIGHT
SLEEPER. NO ONE WOULD BE THERE, BUT IT WOULD BE EXACTLY TIME FOR ME TO GET UP
AND GET READY FOR WORK. THIS HAPPENED SO MANY TIMES I cannot COUNT, IF NOT MY
NAME BEING CALLED THEN A KNOCK ON A WALL OR DOOR? WOULD WAKE ME. I NEVER NEEDED
AN ALARM CLOCK. ONE DAY I WAS STANDING IN THE KITCHEN AND I HEARD someone
BEHIND ME SAY MY NAME, I TURNED TO SEE WHOM LET THEMSELVES INTO THE HOUSE TO
GREET ME, AND NO ONE WAS THERE. I WALKED ALL THROUGH THE HOUSE LOOKING FOR THIS
PERSON I HEARD DISTINCTLY AND ON ONE THERE. I NEVER SAW GHOSTS, BUT JUST MY
NAME AND KNOCKS ON THE WALL. ONE TIME MY SONS 9VOLT BATTERY CHARGED CAR STARTED
JUTTING FORWARD BY ITSELF. IT WAS OFF. NOT PLUGGED IN EITHER. THAT HAPPENED A
FEW TIMES. WE FIGURE THE BATTERY MIGHT BE LOW? WHICH CAUSED IT TO MOVE
SPORADICALLY. ONE NIGHT, I COULD NOT SLEEP FOR NOTHING, I LAID IN BED FOR AN
HOUR NEEDING TO FALL ASLEEP BUT COULD NOT. I EVEN TRIED PRAYING FOR THE LORD TO
HELP ME TO GO TO SLEEP. I JUST HAD THIS WEIRD FEELING ALL OVER ME, THEN THESE
THOUGHTS CAME TO ME TO PRAY FOR A FAMILY MEMBER. I STARTED PRAYING FOR THIS
PERSON AND PRAYED FOR A LONG TIME. FEELING I HAD NO CHOICE, ALSO WANTING TO SO
BADLY. THESE WORDS CAME TO ME AND WOULD NOT STOP COMING. SO I GOT UP AND
STARTED WRITING THE WORDS DOWN ON PAPER, IT WAS A POEM FOR THE FAMILY MEMBER I
WAS PRAYING FOR.( AUNT BUNT) I HAD STAYED AWAKE ALL NIGHT WRITING AND PRAYING.
EARLY LIGHT CAME AND THERE WAS A KNOCK ON THE FRONT DOOR, MY HUSBAND HEARD IT
AND WENT TO ANSWER THE DOOR, IT WAS HIS DAD, BEFORE HIS DAD SAID I HAVE SOME
NEWS, I BUTTED IN AND SAID IS IT ABOUT AUNT BUNT? HE LOOKED AT ME WEIRD AND
ASKED HOW DID I KNOW, I SAID I JUST HAD A FEELING. (SHE PASSED AWAY THAT NIGHT
FROM CANCER. ) I READ THE POEM AT HER FUNERAL.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

may not seem to be a scary story but one I would like to share to say not all
Ghost and Spirits are out to scare or hurt anyone, so my<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>story begins like this....When I was about 6
or 7 years old I obtained a POW/MIA Bracelet from someone that was in Vietnam
(I honestly can not remember how I came to own this) but it has rested on my
wrist for many years (I am almost 35 now) I have always felt protected, loved
and warm thru out my life.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>During my
childhood and teenage years there were times when I would cry, but would feel a
sudden warmth and felt as if someone put their arms around me to shield me from
saddness.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I entered High School it
was a whole new ball game for me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Going
from a school of 250 to a school over 3,000 was a major step especially since I
was a shy person to begin with.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So to
engage in coming out of my shell I joined clubs and such to try to blend in
with everyone else.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One day after school
I had missed the last bus heading for my town.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I had to call my Parents to come get me and that made me have to stay
alone in the school until one of them arrived to pick me up.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I mean don't get me wrong there were people
in the school, but not anywhere I was (This school was HUGE) So I went to my
locker (In the older part of the school) and got my book that I had intially
forgotten while trying to catch the bus home.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As I was opening my locker I felt a sudden &quot;cool&quot; breeze pass
by me and the hair on my neck and arms stood straight up.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Once again after that happened it was
followed by a hugging sensation and warmth.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Over the years I had gotten use to that and very much appreciated it
when I felt down or sad about anything.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It always gave me a feeling of being protected.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Over the years I have had many weird things
happen that I do not have explainations for.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Things disappearing from where I put them and then the next day would be
right where I had left it to begin with. The TV coming on by itself, the radio
coming on and turning the volume way up to 60's &amp; 70's music.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Stuff like that,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I lived alone at the time and I know I was
not crazy and not to mention somewhat of a organized person.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>At the age of 29 I had a stroke (Yes, I know
it's a young age to have that happen, but it did) I lost my speech and use of
my right side.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As I laid in that
hospital (after my family went home) The nurse on duty had cut my lights out so
I could try to rest.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I laid in that bed,
not being able to talk or anything when all of a sudden a bright white light
appeared at the foot of my bed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Next
thing I knew a blonde male with blue eyes( I remember clearly that they were
blue because they reminded me of my own Fathers eyes) was standing beside me
brushing the bangs off my forehead and telling me everything was going to be
ok.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ok, let's think about this.....I am
laying there after having a stroke, not being able to talk, move or
communicate; however I was not scared in the least.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I still had use of my left side and once
again I felt the warmth and hugging happening all over again.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Well I recovered fully from that stroke, I do
have slight general weakness on my right side and from what Doctors told me it
will never be 100% again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Moving
on with the story, after my stroke I had to retire at a young age, yes
retire.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Seems that I was born with a
genetic blood disorder that was never detected when I was younger and that is
what caused the stroke.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I now have to
take medications everyday and I am forever tired.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Depression took me over and I went into a
major slump for awhile.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I moved in with
my Sister who did not want me living alone anymore and she felt safer knowing
that someone would be around in case I got sick again.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After moving in with her I was sitting in her
family room one day crying my eyes out.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>For some weird reason I felt arms around me and a slight compression on
my cheek as if someone had kissed me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
immediately felt secure and I swear I heard the words &quot;I have always been
with you&quot; Ok, Im thinking by this point I am going crazy from staring at 4
walls for several months, but then I heard &quot;You need to know me&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At that point I looked down at that POW/MIA
bracelet and felt the sudden urge to find out who this person was.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So that very day I began my search and after
several weeks found his living siblings.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>After talking to them verbally on the phone you can not believe in a
million years the pieces to the puzzle were put together finally.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Marine whos name I have worn most of my
life was born and raised in the same area that I was born and raised (Our town
was only 12 streets long) We even attended the same Jr. and Senior High Schools
even though decades apart.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>I was very
curious to know what he looked like and let me tell you I almost passed out
when his Sister told me he had strawberry blonde hair and gorgeous piercing
blue eyes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She offered to send me a
picture of him and I broke out in a sweat when I fixed my eyes upon the
photograph.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was the same person I
had seen that night in the Hospital.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>His
picture now hangs in my Family room and every so often that picture will come
flying off the wall.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No matter how many
times I reposition it or fasten it, it still comes off.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have told his Sister about this happening
and she said &quot;Don't worry, he does it to mine all the time too, he is just
letting us know that he is around us all the time&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>His Sister told me he was a sweet kid growing
up and was very much a prankster. He loved his family and somehow because I
have worn his bracelet all these years he is connected to me and me to
him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I know I am very much protected by
him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My home is warm and peaceful, with
a very calm atomosphere.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I still feel
his hugs when I go thru my bouts with depression and they always help so
much.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He is the most sweetest, kindest
spirit I have ever come across in my life time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I have come across many others, but those stories are for another
time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I am sorry this was somewhat long,
but I needed to tell this story<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
parents rented a house in Wesley, east in Washington County, Arkansas, when
they first moved to the Fayetteville area. They<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>went into the house and cleaned it before moving in. They found a
photograph of a girl which was lying on the banister of the stairs heading to
the 2nd floor. The picture was put in the trash, and it re-appeared there all
the time, through out the time they lived there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The rocking chair was always rocking in the
living room. At strange times there was the sound of pots and pans rattling in
the kitchen like someone was cooking, when no one was there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Things
were quite often moved from where they were left.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>One
night my dad had to work late. Mom left his dinner in the refrigerator to heat
up. He got home put his dinner in the microwave. He went into the living room
and turned on the tv. Went back and got his dinner and brought it into the
living room. He sat in his chair, and sat the bowl of stew on the end table
next to the chair while using the TV remote to select a station to watch.
Something picked up the bowl and tossed it across the room and smashed it
against the wall over the tv.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
brother was in the room directly over the living room. He had told me of many
times where he felt that whatever was there was going to harm him. He was
always finding things misplaced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>There
were continually unexplained goings on in the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
parents wanted me and my family to come for Christmas in 1986. (I had
experience helping a lost soul, find his way to the astral world, which is
another story in itself!) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
brother wanted my husband and I to use his room, as that was where most of the
activity took place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
first night there I just observed the goings on in the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
2nd night I started the process that would guide the spirit to the astral
world. It basically consists of a certain prayer said night and morning. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
men in the house got up early to go fishing. I stayed in the bed. I woke up
about 8:45 am. I Said the prayer.I lay there listening for any activity from
downstairs. Then A man in a civil war Confederate uniform came into the room.
He just walked through the closed door. I could see through him, but everything
was clear as to his appearance. He was tall, and thin, he had a scraggly
beard<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>about 4 iches long and mustache.
His hair was streaked with gray. He had the full dress of the soldier including
a bayonette. He looked tired and worn out. I started shivering. He came to the
bed and pulled me out of the bed, slammed me against the wall, punched me,
tossed me against the wall seveal times. I was really scared. I am not sure how
long this took. I tried fighting back. He finally threw me back on the bed and
gabbed a pillow and held it over my face trying to smother me. I was struggling
trying to get free. Finally when I thought I was going to die, I screamed help
me Jesus into the pillow, and the soldier was gone. I got out of bed and ran
downstairs. My mother was sitting at the dinning room table drinking coffee. I
asked her if she heard me screaming for help, or heard the thuds and sounds
from upstairs. She said no. A couple hours later there were bruises on my body,
and I was in some pain from the attack.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
photographs from Christmas day had what appeared to be a puff of smoke the
shape of a person, in the family pictures. I didn't try to say that prayer
again, I figured that whomever was haunting that house was a lot stronger than
I was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
am not sure where those photographs are or if they still exist. I know they
were Polaroids. My youngest brother may have them, or they may be in the box of
photos, that my sister has as my parents are now both deceased.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Sincerely<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Hi my name is Leona and I had a frightening
experience. I am now 25 yrs old but I was 16 yrs when this happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>It
was a warm summers day and I was off for the summer holidays, but my mother was
working. So I was to mind my younger sister Lynda who was 14 at the time. My
best friend Carol called me to go swimming with her to the Iron bridge (this
is a railway track bridge that runs over a river) I had never been there swimming
before and I really wanted to go. So I left Lynda home on her own (making a
deal she wouldnt tell Mam if I did a favor for her again). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>When
Carol and myself arrived instantly I didnt feel comfortable, I couldnt put my
finger on it, but I couldnt take my eye off of the opposite side of the bridge
even though there was nothing there. Carol jumped into the water but I couldnt
go in. After being persuaded I eventually did. The current was strong so we
held onto the middle pole holding up the bridge. As the current pulled I felt
dragged towards the opposite side and absolutely panicked. I called for Carol
to pull me back and we got out of the water.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>She
asked me what was all that about, and I could only tell her that I wasnt
comfortable there and that I kept looking over, why I didnt know. Then friends
of ours arrived and it was soon forgotten about. Later I realised the time that
Mama would be home shortly, so we all headed off separate directions home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
took a shortcut home because I had to get home faster than the others so I
headed off alone. While I was walking I couldnt shake the feeling that
something was behind me. I kept stopping to look behind. It was an open field
and only 5pm in the day, really bright and sunny. The feeling was so strong
that I was convinced that Carol and the other had followed me and playing a
Joke. So I shouted that I knew they were there. When I got no reaction, I
shouted Not funny come on out, still nothing. I was confused. The looking at
the time I knew I was going to be late and I had to be home before Mam came
home. So I shouted again that I couldnt wait I had to run. And thats what I
did exactly run.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>While
I was running I had a bad feeling in me that something wasnt right. So I put
it down to that Mam had gotten home to discover that I wasnt there and now was
extremely angry. But when I got home to my major relief she hadnt arrived home
at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>That
evening came so I rang Carol to sleep over at my house. (It was normal; if she
wasnt at my house I was at hers).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Things
were great, we were cuddled up in bed and chatting about her boy friend when
the most frightening thing that scared the **** of out us happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>We
were talking and the radio was blaring away when this presence (I just dont
know how to describe it came into the room) Carol and me simultaneously froze
in the bed (no light pitch dark but the moon was bright so there was light in
the room) the radio went static. It was so overwhelming that my head started to
spinand all the time my eyes were fixed to the far opposite corner of the
room. I could see nothing through vision but I knew that it was a MAN and a not
happy oneI got feelings of rage, extreme anger, confusion, murderous
feelings.my heart was threatening through my chest and I couldnt move.Carol
beside me never uttered a word, never moved an inchI was so terrified, but I
couldnt take my eyes away. (my stomach and inside are jumping from just
writing this and Im shaking)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>It
felt like it lasted an eternity, while lying frozen flat on my back I managed
to grad Carols hand and she squeesed my hand so hard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>When
it passed or left without realizing it my whole body relaxedI didnt even
realise that every part of me was tensed upand at the same time I felt Carols
hand relax and then the radio came back on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>We
both said What the **** was that, we were freaked out..<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>But
what happened after that I dont know whether it was shock or what but was even
more weird.in a nice way<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
headed started spinning.I felt like I was drunk (but I didnt even know what
the sensation of being drunk was at the time) I felt a real relieving presence
beside me comforting me and another two at the bottom (but these presences I
knew well I feel them all the time around me ( later I was told my a fortune
teller that I have three guardian angles  one my Grand Uncle and two Saints St
Michael and St Gabriel).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Then
Carol and my started talking absolute nonsense.we still never moved from lying
back down on the bed even though we were not experiencing the extreme opposite feeling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
described seeing a ladder above up surrounded by clouds and continuing up to
which I couldnt see where it ended. Carol also could see it.It was so
peaceful so tranquil sooo relaxing I felt like I was going to dose offI said
Carol I feel like Ive been drugged or something and she just came out will
silly little giggles like a little child would do..<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>And
then again it passed, and thats when we sat up on the bed and looked at each
other we were totally back to normal<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
think that that something followed me home, it was the same feeling I got down
at the bridge but no where near intenseand the after effect was my Uncle Jimmy
coming to our rescue and the peaceful dreamy feeling we experienced was him
trying to counteract and calm us down<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Carol
and me were never really able take about what happened after thatI have
questioned myself like she hasdid it really happen, but that I think is us in
denial I know deep inside that it did and Carol has admitted that same, she
knows but we try not to think about. Even to this day nearly 10 years after I
go week inside and get shivers..<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
felt so uneasy in my house for weeks after that and slept the remainder of the
summer nights at Carols house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
would like to that My angles that came to our rescue that night and that I know
protected me throughout my entire childhood. I always felt them with me. I am
eternally indebted to them, as I know that they prevented that night from
worsening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>We
later learn that there has been suicides committed on that bridge, the most
recent being that a year prior a man had shot himself through the head with a
shot gun and even a year later another guy hung himself off the bridge<o:p></o:p></span></p>

.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The home<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>was built around 1817 in Western New York
State. 1st built was the &quot;wooden&quot; small part of the house, that's
where my apt. is, &amp; no one elses. The &quot;brick&quot; part of the home
was started around 1820 and continued untill the early 1900's.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In 1847 the home the place was called
&quot;DROVERS INN&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>as it was a
place to stop on a cattle drive from NY City to Chicago.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

had at one time, eight(8) wine cellars in the basement.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
basement, has been &quot;sealed&quot; up, there is no access to it at all, Only
the bathroom pipes comming thru the wall can be seen, and are located at the

&quot;basement&quot; , under the WOODEN part of house is sealed, MOST of brick

was late, around 12:30am, I was sitting on my Living room couch reading. My

&quot;FOOTSTEPS&quot; comming up the cellar stairs, as the door is located in

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I'm
now 27 years old, and what happened to me was when I was 15. At the time, I
wasn't visiting internet sites such as this one. I did what I did because it
seemed like the rational thing to do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
first girlfriend and I had broken one year ago when she gave me a call, crying
and begging for help. Even though I wasn't a close friend of hers at the time,
she chose to tell me her strange problem. She first made me promise that whatever
she'd say to me, I wouldn't say that she was crazy. I swore and she went on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>She
told me that at the end of her life, her grand mother started to need help and
was not able to live by herself. She then started living in my ex-girlfriend's
house, sharing her room. One day, her grandma had a heart attack and was
brought to the hospital where the doctors were unable to bring her back to her
normal state. She was kept alive artificially by machines and her family
finally took the decision to &quot;pull the plug&quot; since there was no come
back to normal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
ex then told me that weeks later, funny things started to happen. Her grandma's
perfume would be floating around her room, she would feel her presence
around...<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She eventually was scared to
go to sleep there. On one occasion, she thought it would be fun to put a little
tent in her room and sleep in it rather than in her bed. She said she woke up
in the middle of the night, feeling something was wrong. She looked around and
found the cause of her bad feeling. The entrance of her tent was giving on her
grandma's rocking chair and she saw her grandma's sitting on it, rocking back
and forth. She was so scared that she couldn't breath well and she closed her
eyes hoping it wouldn't be there still once she opened them again. When she
did, she felt a relief since the chair was empty. She then got on her back and
looked up towards the ventilation hole on top of the tent and there she saw her
grandma peeking through it. She told me that her grandmother went from the chair
to the hole, then back to the chair and so on during a long period of time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Once
she was too scared to sleep alone in her room and she asked her younger brother
to sleep with her in her bed. Of course, she told him nothing about a ghost in
the room. She felt reassured enough to sleep tight that night, but the brother
couldn't. He was scared as hell as he saw a shadow walking around in the room,
making noises. He saw it walk towards the closet, heard it moving different
things in it and he even heard pens fall onto the floor. At one point, he says
he even saw the shadow come right at him and he felt a cold finger touching his
belly for a few seconds, then it left. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
ex told her parents about her misfortunes but they told her she was imagining
things, and that she was crazy. That's when she thought of my phone number. So
I told her that I didn't think she was what her parents had said, although I
was not convinced with her conclusions. I told her I would come tomorrow to
sleep at her place. I asked her if she had a recording machine and she did so I
told her not to sleep in her room that night, but to go in her brother's and to
let a virgin tape record any noise that could be heard in the room while she
wouldn't be in it. She agreed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
next day, right after school, I took the bus that led me to her house. She
brought me to her room. Once there, I asked her if she had taped the noises of
her room the last night as I had told her to. She had, but admitted she hadn't
dared to listen to it alone before I came. She also told me that she couldn't
be with me for the first 20 minutes since her mom wanted her to wash the dishes
first. I stayed in the room the whole time, waiting for something to impress
me. And something did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Ten
minutes after she was gone to her duties, I saw her small garbage can jump at
least 5 feet away from where it was first placed, near the wall. It looked as
if someone had kicked it from the wall, although it landed standing straight. I
got up to see it from a closer range so I could find a logical explanation but
there was none. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Then
she came back and asked me if everything was alright. I told her that I really
felt like listening to the tape. And we did. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Something
most be told about the rocking chair that was in her room. The grandma's cane
was hooked onto it, so if we'd be rocking the chair with our hands, the cane
would knock the chair with both ends, making a repetitive &quot;knock, knock...
knock, knock...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>On
the tape, we clearly hear my ex pressing the play-record buttons and then
leaving the room and closing the door. Then we start to hear the knocks on the
rocking chair. I first said that it must have been the wind of the closing door
that pushed the chair a bit, though the rocking goes on and on and on for at
least an hour. Eventually, that irregular rocking seems to give way to another
muffled sound, something we couldn't quite make out. Then the rocking
restarted, then the other unidentified sound. Rarely were those two noises
happening at the same time. In the last 5 minutes, we stopped hearing the
rocking, but the other sound became more present, more definite. Though it's
only during the last seconds of the tape that we finally could hear what that
weird sound was. Apparently coming closer and closer to the recording
microphone was a beating heart. &quot;pum PUM pum, pum PUM pum...&quot; The
intensity was growing at each cycle and then the tape ran out of time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Although
that brought my curiosity to a much higher level, I didn't convince myself to
pass the night in my ex-girlfriend's room, especially since she wouldn't
herself. I was brave, but I had my limits and I slept in the guest room.
Nothing unusual happened after that. My ex gave me the tape for a while and I
played it to all the people that wouldn't believe my tale. It was always kind
of funny to see their face passing from white to green as the tape played on.
Then I gave the tape back to my ex and they both disappeared from my life
again. I've no clue about what happened after this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Hi!
My name is Tania.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I live in St. Paul,
Minnesota. I believe my house is haunted.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Both of my grandparents died close to my house. First, of all both
grandparents use to live in Duluth, Minnesota. They would come down to help my
parents by babysitting my brother and I when we were younger. I bought the
house from my parents. When my grandfather died in April of 1990 or 1991 which
I was a freshmen in highschool. I remember it was a cold, rainly, windy and
bleak day. My grandfather wanted to walk to the store. My grandmother started
to get kind of worried about him and told me to go find him. I went to the
store to go look for him. I even asked a guy there. They said an old man was
taken to the hospital because he fell to the pavement and had a heart attack. Crying
and shocked I ran back home and told my grandma and called my mother at work.
They went to the hospital and find out that he was brian dead and suffered some
kind of stroke. The doctor said he was a bomb ready to go off any time. They
decided to take him off of life support. He died that day. The next morning I
got up to get ready for school. I walked into my kitchen to start a pot of
coffee and turn the television on. I usually turn it to the cartoon channel and
the TV turned to the news. My grandfather was a news buff.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I knew it was him. Then my light over the
counter in the kitchen was flickering. I guess he was telling me in his own way
that he was doing well, that he was going to stick around for a while and don't
worry. Between that time to 1995 until my grandma passed away he was around. At
times he would give us a sign that he was still there. There was one incident
that my cat would stare in midair at the<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>end of the couch that my grandfather use to sit. He use to put her on a
leash and take her outside. I think she saw him. When my grandma died in May of
1995 and got a call from the hospital that she died that morning our male cats
were acting really weird. The room that my grandmother use to sleep in the cats
were in there. One cat was arching his back. I think my grandmother came back
to say good-bye and pack up her belongs and going on a trip with my
grandfather. To this day, on occasion I still feel their presents. Once in
along my light in the kitchen would flicker or my rottweiler would either bark
at something in midair or play with it. I am not scared because I know its
them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Another
incident that is not related is my husband's father has an old house in
Wabasha, Minnesota that is quite old. I believe it was built in 1862. We were
doing some changes in the house. I just started doing some reasearch on the
house and on my husband's side of the family. We were down there around Labor
Day for a week and another time in the middle of September. Each morning we
would hear a knocking on the window were we slept. My husband and I would look
out the window and nobody was there. My husband said it probably was his
grandma or aunt haunting me because I was doing research on the family. I
figure it probably was a rodent in between the walls. But this has happened
already twice since I was doing the reaseach and when we were down there.
Another incident was when I was putting new curtains on the windows and I was
having problems with them staying on the rod. My husband, I and my
brother-in-law are going down to Wabasha to close up the house for the winter.
I will let you know if I hear any more knockings on the window or wall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

YOUNGER.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>THE FIRST TIME THAT I SAW THE
WOMEN GHOST (THAT I REMEMBER) WAS WHEN I WAS SLEEPING AND I HEARD THE FLOOR
CREEK NEAR THE ENTRANCE TO MY ROOM, SO I WOKE UP TO SEE WHAT THE NOISE
WAS......THAT IS WHEN I SAW A PROFILE OF A WOMAN FLOATING ACROSS THE ROOM AT
THE FRONT OF MY BED.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>SHE WAS WEARING AN
OLD VICTORIAN DRESS THAT LOOKED TO BE SHREDDING OR FLOWY AT THE BOTTOM.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>NOW BY THIS TIME I THOUGHT THAT I WAS SEEING
THINGS UNTIL MY CAT WENT TO CHASE AFTER HER....ONCE SHE FLOATED BY SHE
DISAPPEARED INTO MY VANITY MIRROR AND MY BED STARTED TO VIBRATE (JUST A LITTLE
BIT).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I HAVE SEEN HER A FEW TIMES.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>SHE CAN ALSO BE HEARD HUMMING AND BEAUTIFUL
TUNE, WE HAVE ALSO HEARD HER SAY OUR NAMES.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>THE
NEXT GHOST THAT I HAVE SEEN WAS THE MAN.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>THERE ACTUALLY ARE 2 MEN.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I HAVE
SEEN ONE OF THE MEN ONLY A COUPLE OF TIMES.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>HE IS THE ONE THAT I HAVE SEEN ON SUNDAY MORNINGS WHEN THE CHURCH BELLS
ARE HEARD IN THE BACKGROUND (THERE IS A CHURCH A FEW BLOCKS AWAY FROM MY
HOUSE).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I ONLY SAW FROM THE NECK TO THE
WAIST ON THIS GUY.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>HE WAS WEARING AN OLD
FASHIONED TUX.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>THE SECOND MAN HAS A VERY
DARK OUTFIT.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I SAW HIM FULLY.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>HIS FACE LOOKED LIKE THE MOONLIGHT WAS
SHINING ON HIM.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>HIS CHEEK BONES WERE
VERY DEFINED. HE WAS TALL TOO.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>WE HAVE
HEARD HIM TALK.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>WE HAVE ALSO HAVE HAD
SOMEONE DOING HEAVY BREATHING ON THE BACK OF OUR NECKS. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>THE
THIRD GHOST IS A BABY.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I HAVE SEEN THIS
LITTLE GUY ONLY ONCE.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>HE WAS SLEEPING
IN THE FETAL POSITION WITH BLUE SNEAKERS WITH GREEN LACES AND RED SOLES.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>HE ALSO HAD BLUE PANTS ON AND LOOKED TO BE
ABOUT 7 MONTHS.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
AM THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS SEEN THESE GHOSTS, EXCEPT FOR ONE TIME MY FIANCÉ SAW
IT IN THE BASEMENT. THE COME AND GO, BUT WHEN THEY ARE AROUND WE KNOW IT.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>SOME MORNINGS AND NIGHTS WE HEAR THE KITCHEN
CABINETS OPEN AND CLOSE AND THE CHAIRS MOVING AROUND WHEN NO ONE IS THERE.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>THEY ARE VERY PLAYING....THEY HIDE THINGS A
LOT AND YOU DON'T FIND THEM UNTIL MONTHS LATER, IF YOU FIND THEM.....THEY ARE
HAPPY GHOSTS.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>THEY USUALLY COME AROUND
EITHER EARLY MORNING OR BETWEEN 1:00-3:30 AT NIGHT.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>IT VARIES.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>WHEN MY FATHER WAS PUTTING WALLPAPER UP IN THE LIVING ROOM ONE NIGHT
LATE, HE HEARD A WOMEN HUMMING AND HE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS ONE OF US, BUT WE
WERE SLEEPING.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>THESE GHOSTS HAVE CHANGED
THE RADIO CHANNELS, AND THERE ARE TIMES THAT THE RADIO WOULD COME ON AS SOON AS
I ENTERED MY BEDROOM ON A STATION THAT I OR ANYONE ELSE WOULD LISTEN TO.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>WE ALSO THINK THAT WE SEE CATS WALKING BY
THAT LOOK LIKE THE 2 OF CATS OUT OF 4 THAT PASSED AWAY LAST YEAR, BUT WHEN GO
TO SEE WHERE THEY WENT THERE WOULDN'T BE ONE THERE.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>WE ALSO TOOK A PICTURE OF ONE OF OUR FERRETS
AND THEY WAS A HUGE SHOOTING ORB NEXT TO HER IN THE PICTURE AND I BELIEVE THIS
TO BE OUR FIRST FERRET THAT PASSED AWAY 4 YEARS AGO. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>WE
HAVE TAKEN PICTURES IN MY HOUSE TO SEE IF THERE IS ANYTHING....WE HAVE CAUGHT A

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>In
March 2004, I purchased my first home.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was Great-Grandmother's home - who passed away in Jan. 2004.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was the original owner of the home, &amp;
it was built in 1952.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I live alone

Great-Grandfather, who also lived in the home, passed away in 1978 - a year
before I was born.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He passed away from
cancer, IN THE HOME, in one of the bedrooms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>A
few months ago, while in the kitchen of my home, my daughter states,
&quot;Mommy. . . . What is that man doing in my house?&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I turned around, thinking someone was in our
backyard.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No one.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I said, &quot;What man?&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She then pointed as if someone were standing
in our kitchen, &quot;That man right there.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had hair standing on the back of my neck
and goosebumps like you wouldn't believe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
have a VERY close, tight-nit family.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And
after telling a few family members about it, one of my Mother's cousin's chimes
in, in tears.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She told me that when she
was about 12 or 13, she was staying with my Great-Grandmother one night, and
saw &quot;Pap's&quot; ghost at the foot of her bed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She said she was so terrified - she was
unable to sleep the rest of the night, and kept the sighting to herself for
fear other family members would think she was crazy or making things up..<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Since
my daughter's &quot;sighting&quot;, I've heard (but not witnessed) doors in my

go into a bedroom alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

really sure what to do - or if there is anything to do about it.<span

really nothing to be afraid of.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Ever
since I was a young girl I felt that I had an interest in the spiritual
world.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I would always jump at the chance
to read ghost stories and hear scarey tales.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I had never actually seen any solid evidence of a haunting in our house.
But I had always had fealings, heard things<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>and had many dreams.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My mother
had experienced things in the house when she was young though.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She grew up in the same house.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But on to my actual story...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>When
I was about 21, I shared a small apartment with a friend.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This apartment was an old one story building.
My bedroom was ground level and a my window faced an old black iron fence.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And on the other side of this fence was an old
cemetary.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>a cat at the time who was a very sweet and
calm cat....<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Until I moved to that
apartment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I could just have been the
change of her surroundings, but she became very timid and rarely ventured out
of my room. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>She
loved to sit in the window and I usually kept it open in the summer.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One early morning, about 5am, I was startled
awake but what I think was a loud noise and my cat hissing and growling. I
immediately jumped up and went to reach for my cat to see what was wrong.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She literally attacted me, bit my arm and
scratched at my face.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I dropped her and
she ran out of the room. I followed and ended up in the kitchen with her.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She saw me and jumped off the table and had
me cornered.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I never had seen her act
this way, just crazy!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She slowly started
walking toward me, growling and hissing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I jumped up on the counter and said &quot;what's wrong yoshi?&quot; in a
loving voice.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I swear she shook her head
and looked at me like she was a bit confused and gave me a soft little meow and
was completely normal after that!!!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now
dog lovers would chalk it up to this being just another crazy cat story, but I
have never experienced such a thing from any animal!!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thanks for letting me share<o:p></o:p></span></p>

so when I tell other people they look at me like I'm off my rocker but both my

flu and died<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>of complications.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Before anyone had the chance to call me and
let me know of his passing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Grandpa &quot;visited&quot;me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I woke up from my sleep early in the morning
and Grandpa was at the foot of my bed, smoking a cigar.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He loved his cigars.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He smiled at me and said &quot;Goodby&quot;
and blinked out.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, there was a small
cloud of smoke and the comforting smell of his cigars.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I immediately called home to discover that
Grandpa had just died apparrantly at the same time that he had
&quot;visited&quot; me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Years
later my father passed away.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He died
suddenly and at home<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>we were all started
by his sudden death. Since I lived about an hour dirve from my parents.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had stayed at the family home for the funeral.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My children slept in what had been my
sisters' room and I made myself comfortable on the hideabed in my dad's
office.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sometime in the night.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>His computer came on, glowed green at me and
then slowly faded out. I should mention that when I say his computer came on I
mean that his monitor &quot;glowed&quot; there was no power actually going into
the computer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The surge protector, and
PC were off.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Just the green screen which
was unusual since that computer's on status was a blue screen I never saw it
glow green before or after that night. It had come on bright enough and long
enough to wake me up and for me to realize the computer was on and sit up in my
bed before slowly fading back into darkness.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Although different from Grandpa's visit I felt as if Dad had said
goodbye and I felt better about his passing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>In
the late seventies, I bought an old house on </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>West Nesquehoning
  Street</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;color:white'> located on the South Side of Easton. I
purchased it from a seventy - two year old man who was born in the house. He
told me that the property was in his family from the very early days of </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Easton</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>At
first, the old man said, it was only a one room cabin. Later as the family got
larger, the cabin was razed and a two and a half story house was built. Again,
as the house passed on through the family, an addition was added to the rear or
the house. I just wanted to give you a little history of the property.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>After
the purchase, I was in the back yard clearing out the over grown vegetation. Under
the old back porch I found an old round-topped tombstone. It was half covered
with dirt. The tombstone was 12-14 inches high and 8-10 inches wide. Looked
like a child's headstone. The printing was in German. I don't remember what the
date was, it's been twenty-four years. I wanted to ask the old man what it was
but he died shortly after I bought the house. I kinda just pushed the thought
off.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>All
this time I was in the Army and stationed at Arlington Hall Station In
Arlington, Virginia. On Fridays, I would make the four hour drive back to </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Easton</span></st1:place></st1:City><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>One
Sunday night as I was sleeping in the rear bedroom, I woke up. I opened my eyes
and there about six inches from my face was on old man staring at me. His face
was so wrinkled and cracked. He looked like he was five hundred years old.
Scared the hell out of me. I opened my eyes and he was gone. It was that quick.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>This
same thing happened several months later. Same sequences of events. The old man
appeared only twice to me. I still see his face like it was twenty years ago.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Several
years later, my time was up with the Army and I returned home, back to </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Easton</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'> as a civilian. Got a
real job and worked around the house on weekends. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>One
night in May of 1982, My wife and little girl fell asleep on the couch while we
were watching television. I was sitting on the floor leaning against the couch.
The lights were out with only the light of the tv on. The tv was in the right
corner of the room just to the right of an eight foot wide archway going into
the sitting room. The lights were off in there also<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The sitting room lights were off, the shades
pulled. My little daughter had friends over earlier that evening. I sent them
all home about 7 that evening. All except one. She walked from the right side
of the archway in the sitting room to the left. She was about thirty inches
tall, dressed all in white. Long hair, Mid calf white ruffeled dress and white
shoes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>It was getting late and none of the parents
called me looking for any missing kids. I called out to the little girl but no
answer. I got up and went into the sitting room. She probably fell asleep and
just woke up. Being in a strange place she was afraid. I turned on the lights
but no little girl. I pulled the furniture away from the wall, no little girl.
Wow, what did see? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Two weeks later, I was in the third floor
craw space rolling out some fiberglass batting for insulation. I had to pull up
the two by twelve by eighteen foot floorboards to put the insulation down. When
I got to the back corner of the crawspace, I pulled up the last floorboard.
Under the floorboard was an old shoe box filled with letters from the 1884 thru
1889. Also a child's white pair of shoes and a black belt with a scalloped tin
buckle. I never saw the little girl again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

coming up the steps but no one ever entered the hall from the steps. Strange
house. The house was sold in 1985. Sorry for such a long letter, but I wanted
to write about these encounters for years. Thank You for your time.<b
