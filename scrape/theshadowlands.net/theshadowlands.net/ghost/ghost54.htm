<H3><A NAME=iowa>The House in Iowa</A>
</H3><P><B>by Tarianna21@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>We moved into another house in the same town in Iowa, I would grow
up in this</B>
<P><B>house and live there until I got married and moved away. I was 7 at
the time.</B>
<P><B>My family had many experiences in this house. A little background,
There was 2</B>
<P><B>rooms that were built before electricity, none had bothered putting
it into</B>
<P><B>the 2 rooms they just ran dropcords to them. It was 1 room upstairs
and 1</B>
<P><B>directly below it, the rest of the house was built around the 2 rooms.

The</B>
<P><B>upstairs room was sunkenabout 1 foot compared to the rest of the bedrooms

and</B>
<P><B>the bathroom.  You went up a flight of stairs form the 1st floor turned

right</B>
<P><B>opened the bedroom door stoop down and walk down 2 steps to get into

the</B>
<P><B>bedroom. Although the rest of the house had it's moments, this room
was the</B>
<P><B>most active.</B>
<P><B>My parents used this room as their bedroom until I was about 12 then
it became</B>
<P><B>mine.(but I am getting ahead of myself ).  My parents had many experiences

in</B>
<P><B>this room, and I will list a few of them that I remember the most.</B>
<P><B>My parents woke up in the middle of the night about a year after we
moved in.</B>
<P><B>Their room had 2 closets in it, one was open to the room and the other
had a</B>
<P><B>door.  The closet with the door had a mini-closet in it with it's own

door.</B>
<P><B>Anyway the closet with the door was making creaking noises that woke

my</B>
<P><B>parents up.  My father turned on the lamp,and opened the closet door.

 My</B>
<P><B>mother let out a scream which woke us kids up (age 8 and 9), and we

came</B>
<P><B>running. The clothes that they had in the closet on hangers on a pole

were</B>
<P><B>flying out piece by piece.  This lasted about 2 minutes.  It was then
that we</B>
<P><B>realized we were not alone in the house.  Several times they were in
bed and</B>
<P><B>had the covers ripped off and thrown in a pile on the floor at the
foot of the</B>
<P><B>bed.  There were shadows and noises that we all seemed to notice most

at</B>
<P><B>night, but looking back it was probably because noone spent alot of

time</B>
<P><B>upstairs during the day. These kind of things went on the whole time
we lived</B>
<P><B>in the house and I will tell more of them later.</B>
<P><B>Thank you for your time and the space to tell my experiences:)</B>

</H3><P><B>by  CJericoWin@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My name is Marc Cooper.  I am twenty one years of age, and have never</B>
<P><B>experienced an unexplained phenomena before.  Except for three months

ago.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was lying in my bed around two in the morning, when I heard screaming

coming</B>
<P><B>from upstairs (I live in an apartment).  It was the voice of a male,

and</B>
<P><B>screaming from a female.  I heard the female crying, and the male

yelling.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I sat up on my bed, and listened to the crying.  I then heard a thump,

then</B>
<P><B>another, followed by another four slams on the ceiling above me.  I
turned off</B>
<P><B>the lamp, way to afraid to go upstairs and investegate.  I stayed up

all</B>
<P><B>night, but heard nothing from upstairs.  I left for work around two
thirty the</B>
<P><B>next day.  I was tired, but I had to go.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Out of curiosity, I went and knocked on the tenant's door above me.
 There was</B>
<P><B>no answer.  I walked downstairs and left for work.</B>
<P>
<P><B>About the same time the next night, I awoken to the thumping upstairs.

 I</B>
<P><B>disregarded it again, until I heard the thumping and screaming the
next night.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I went upstairs and knocked on the door.  There was no answer, so,
in anger I</B>
<P><B>opened the door and peered inside.  "People are trying to sleep in

this</B>
<P><B>building."  I yelled into the apartment.  As my eyes adjusted to the

darkness,</B>
<P><B>I realize something that terrified me.  There was no furniture, and
the whole</B>
<P><B>apartment had been abandoned.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I closed the door and hurried back to my room.  I awoke once again
to the</B>
<P><B>banging.  I stormed up stairs, and flinged open the door.  "Stop it!"

I</B>
<P><B>yelled.  I then a orbish type light float in to the wall and dissapear.
 I ran</B>
<P><B>back to my room and once again stayed up all night.</B>
<P>
<P><B>After sleeping all day, I stayed up to listen to the banging.  Only
this time,</B>
<P><B>I heard laughing...cool, easy laughing.  Then, silence.  I haven't

heard</B>
<P><B>anything since.</B>

<H3><A NAME=corps>Ambulance Corps.</A>
</H3><P><B>by Phil_Keller@mail.sel.sony.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am twenty eight years old and am currently an honorary member of
</B>
<P><B>     a volunteer ambulance corps. in New Jersey. Honorary, because
</B>
<P><B>     after ten years of active service, I resigned to pursue training
in </B>
<P><B>     advanced life support as a paramedic. After four years as a paramedic,

</B>
<P><B>     I left EMS to focus on what has always been my full time career,
a </B>
<P><B>     credit rep for a major electronics company.</B>
<P><B>        These stories have taken place over years and are not daily
</B>
<P><B>     occurrences and while other members have similar stories, I will
not </B>
<P><B>     speak for them. Fortunately, I have had witnesses to some of these

</B>
<P><B>     happenings.        </B>
<P><B>         Most of the occurrences seem to focus around the garage area
of </B>
<P><B>     the building, where the ambulance is parked. I happen to believe
a man </B>
<P><B>     and a woman "occupy" this building. I believe this because of
the </B>
<P><B>     following:</B>
<P><B>        - While watching Tv alone one night I had a strange feeling
that </B>
<P><B>     someone was watching me. Out of the corner of my eye, standing
by the </B>
<P><B>     door leading from the meeting room to the garage, I saw someone.
Just </B>
<P><B>     standing there. When I looked, no-one was there. This happened
a </B>
<P><B>     couple of times over about forty five minutes and upon glancing
a </B>
<P><B>     third time, I made out some features. It was a man in his late
</B>
<P><B>     thirties maybe, standing about 5'10" with full dark hair and a
</B>
<P><B>     mustache. I left for the night at this point. This was fall of
1992 if </B>
<P><B>     not mistaken.</B>
<P><B>        -In 1991, I was sitting on the couch with my girlfriend at
the time </B>
<P><B>     watching Tv again. We distinctly heard the door from the garage
to the </B>
<P><B>     outside slam shut. It was a wooden door at the time and unmistakable

</B>
<P><B>     with it's sound. When no-one entered the meeting room, we wondered

what </B>
<P><B>     member may have come down. When no-one came inside, I went into
the </B>
<P><B>     garage to look. There wasn't anyone there, but heard the door
slam </B>
<P><B>     again once back inside the meeting room. This continued about
five </B>
<P><B>     times, the last time when my back was turned and standing about
twelve </B>
<P><B>     feet away. There wasn't anyone in the garage or outside. Nicole
wanted </B>
<P><B>     to leave pretty quickly.</B>
<P><B>        -In the spring of 1994, I think, I was again on the couch with
yet </B>
<P><B>     a different girlfriend. The door to the garage was propped open
when </B>
<P><B>     we both heard the sound of footsteps coming from the garage. It
</B>
<P><B>     sounded a little odd in the sense that it almost sounded like
someone </B>
<P><B>     walking on leaves. Lisa had me go check and of course, I found
nothing </B>
<P><B>     but this continued for about 1/2 hour. Whenever I would reach
the </B>
<P><B>     threshold of the garage, it would stop. When I dragged Lisa into
the </B>
<P><B>     garage to show her nothing/no-one was there, the sound started
again. </B>
<P><B>     We were looking directly at the spot where the sound seemed to
</B>
<P><B>     originate. About twenty feet in front of us, we heard the footsteps

</B>
<P><B>     walking toward us. We both left right away.</B>
<P><B>        -In March of 1996, I was dating yet a different girl. (yeah
I got </B>
<P><B>     around a bit) We had thrown a surprise party for my father. Jen
was </B>
<P><B>     really tired after working a double shift the night before. She's
a </B>
<P><B>     nurse as well as Lisa. After the party, I was finishing cleaning
up </B>
<P><B>     when I jokingly said, "welcome to the haunted building". She freaked
a </B>
<P><B>     little, and wanted to leave immediately. This surprised me a bit

</B>
<P><B>     because I didn't relay any of these stories to her. When we got
</B>
<P><B>     outside, she told me that while 'zoning out', she noticed a man
and a </B>
<P><B>     woman standing near the door to the garage. She said the man was
in </B>
<P><B>     his early forties with dark hair and a mustache. She couldn't
make out </B>
<P><B>     the woman because her back was turned. She noticed them because
they </B>
<P><B>     seemed out of place to her. My cousin 'snapped her out' of the
'zone' </B>
<P><B>     and the couple disappeared. She didn't see them again and nobody
at </B>
<P><B>     the party fit this man's description.</B>
<P><B>        - As I walked into the building through the back door one evening,

</B>
<P><B>     I heard as plain as day, a woman speaking. I simply thought someone

</B>
<P><B>     left the Tv on. When I stepped over the threshold, the voice stopped

</B>
<P><B>     and the Tv wasn't on nor was anyone in the room. There was no
remote </B>
<P><B>     to the Tv so nobody could have turned it off from afar. I walked

</B>
<P><B>     across the room to the garage. When I walked through the door,
I </B>
<P><B>     noticed two friends, Patty and Alison standing outside near the
door, </B>
<P><B>     looking rather shaken. I asked them what was wrong. They said
they </B>
<P><B>     both heard a man's voice distinctly say "Alison"; twice only moments

</B>
<P><B>     before. They accused me of playing trick on them although I did
not. </B>
<P><B>     This was the summer of 1996.</B>
<P><B>        - I have heard conversations take place in the garage a couple
of </B>
<P><B>     times when no-one was around. I could never make out what was
being </B>
<P><B>     said, but it did sound like a male and female. Whenever I would
walk </B>
<P><B>     into the garage, it would stop. Additionally, there have been
</B>
<P><B>     instances when the lights on the phone would blink on and off
as if </B>
<P><B>     someone was picking up and hanging up the receiver in another
room. </B>
<P><B>     This happened when either nobody was present or anyone present
was in </B>
<P><B>     the meeting room together. This of course could be an electrical

</B>
<P><B>     problem, but who knows.</B>

<H3><A NAME=rodger>Uncle Rodger</A>
</H3><P><B>by zbazz@mail.teleport.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I've written before and after the last time I didn't think I would</B>
<P><B>again.  Not because of anything bad happening afterward.  But simply</B>
<P><B>because I think I spooked myself.  Also though, even though my story</B>
<P><B>(Shadow Man) was absolutely true, I am some what of a perfectionist

when</B>
<P><B>it comes to my writing and I wasn't pleased with how it turned out.</B>
<P><B>     The decision to write once again came about by something that</B>
<P><B>happened to me on October 30th of this year.  For once I am happy to

say</B>
<P><B>it was nothing frightening.  It was however something to remember.</B>
<P><B>    For as long as I can remember I have had the ability to sense</B>
<P><B>supernatural entities.  How ever crazy that sounds to anyone reading</B>
<P><B>this, you must believe that it sounds even crazier to me.  Until a

few</B>
<P><B>years ago I didn't understand exactly what I was feeling.  All I knew</B>
<P><B>was that I would get uncomfortable and feel like I had to turn around

to</B>
<P><B>see if someone was watching me.  There was always this pressure, like</B>
<P><B>someone sitting on my chest.  This pressure would just come out of
no</B>
<P><B>where.  Also my eyes would occasionally water uncontrollably .  My

eyes</B>
<P><B>watering seems to happen more if what I'm dealing with seems</B>
<P><B>unfriendly.   I don't know why.</B>
<P><B>     October 30 started off normal enough.  My husband was off at work.

</B>
<P><B>My son and I had been home together.  When he had finally fallen

asleep</B>
<P><B>for his nap I took advantage of the time to clean up his toys.  When</B>
<P><B>everything was put away in his toy box I sat down to just rest for
a few</B>
<P><B>minutes myself.  It was about 1 p.m. .  All of a sudden I had this</B>
<P><B>really strange feeling of pressure on my chest.   I wasn't afraid as</B>
<P><B>over the past couple of years I have really been trying to develop
my</B>
<P><B>ability to sense things.  I was just taken by surprise.  I sat for
a few</B>
<P><B>minutes and just concentrated on what it was I was feeling.   I

honestly</B>
<P><B>don't know how to explain this but it just felt like a man's presence.

</B>
<P><B>My great grandmother came to "visit" me once when I was messing with</B>
<P><B>things I shouldn't have been messing with.  I remember that feeling

as</B>
<P><B>strong but gentle...like a woman.  This was much more over powering

and</B>
<P><B>almost frantic.  For me it was very annoying and uncomfortable.  I

sat</B>
<P><B>and thought about who it could be.  All of the men I thought of were</B>
<P><B>family but I couldn't understand why they would come to me. </B>
<P><B>Traditionally the belief is that since Halloween was coming the

spirit</B>
<P><B>world and the the living world can communicate.  At this point I was</B>
<P><B>pretty intrigued.  This went on and on.  About an hour later my son

woke</B>
<P><B>up and we went to his bedroom to change his diaper.  I remember</B>
<P><B>distinctly scanning the living room as we walked from his playpen to</B>
<P><B>make sure that ALL of his toys were picked up.  As Duncan and I

entered</B>
<P><B>the living room a few minutes later,  I looked over at in the

direction</B>
<P><B>of the front door.  Sitting right in the way of the front door was
a toy</B>
<P><B>that never gets played with.  A little crawling Mickey Mouse that had</B>
<P><B>been in the middle to the bottom part of the toy box simply for the</B>
<P><B>reason I stated. He never plays with it.  Mickey was facing me and
it</B>
<P><B>hit me that someone was trying to play with Duncan.</B>
<P><B>     No more than 10 minutes later my husbands mother called me.  She</B>
<P><B>was on her way up to her mother's apartment.  Her brother Rodger, had</B>
<P><B>passed away early that morning in his sleep at her mother's apartment.

</B>
<P><B>She lives in a retirement community and a nurse making early morning</B>
<P><B>rounds had come in and found Rodger on the floor in the living room.

 I</B>
<P><B>automatically knew who it was.  It was a knowledge like I know that

the</B>
<P><B>sun will set and the sun will rise.  I also knew why Rodger had come

to</B>
<P><B>me.  In the past couple of years he and my mother-in-law had "locked</B>
<P><B>horns" numerous times.  There had been hard feelings.  There are a

few</B>
<P><B>reasons that Rodger came here.  He really thought that Duncan was</B>
<P><B>great.  My husband and I (especially me) had no ill feelings for him

at</B>
<P><B>all.  He also didn't understand what was happening to him.  He didn't</B>
<P><B>know where to go.</B>
<P><B>     I lit a white candle.  The candle has no power at all but

spirits</B>
<P><B>can see heat as heat is energy.  I explained to him that everything

was</B>
<P><B>okay and that he needed to go into the light.  No one was mad at him</B>
<P><B>anymore and he  was loved.  It took a little while (about an hour I</B>
<P><B>think) for him to make up his mind.  Every time I thought he was gone

I</B>
<P><B>would get that feeling again.  By this time I was getting irritated.
</B>
<P><B>Finally he went.</B>
<P><B>     This experience left no fear in me at all.  In fact when things</B>
<P><B>like this happen it's always a little reassuring .  We really do go

on.</B>
<P><B>     I haven't told my mother-in-law about this.  We don't always get</B>
<P><B>along and I'm not sure how she would react.  Maybe someday I will.</B>

<H3><A NAME=my>My Childhood Haunted House</A>
</H3><P><B>by ck12306@navix.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I had sent you a story awhile back, around the end of October, or the</B>
<P><B>first of November, I don't know if you did not get it, or just did

not</B>
<P><B>believe me, trust me it is very true.</B>
<P><B>I will tell you again.  I grew up in an old farm house, my maternal</B>
<P><B>grandfather had bought it, and my mom, and biological father lived
in</B>
<P><B>it.  At the time that they moved in, my oldest sister was a baby, and</B>
<P><B>the oldest part of the house was around 100 years old, and the newest</B>
<P><B>part wich was added on was about 60 years old.</B>
<P><B>Things were always going on, including right after they moved in, but

no</B>
<P><B>one really talked about them, until years later, after all of us</B>
<P><B>children had moved out, and a new house was under construction, near

to</B>
<P><B>it, and my father had died, and my mom remarried.  I am sorry if it</B>
<P><B>sounds like I am rambling on, but it is important, that you know the</B>
<P><B>history behind this.</B>
<P><B>I am the sixth living child, from a seventh pregnancy,I have one

younger</B>
<P><B>sister too, my mother, and one brother, and myself, have a tendency

to</B>
<P><B>have premonitions, but I am the only one that can see things from the</B>
<P><B>past.</B>
<P><B>The house was a 2 story one, most of the ghostly activity took place

on</B>
<P><B>the second floor.  You could be home by yourself, with the doors

locked,</B>
<P><B>and hear someone walking across the upstairs hallway, and the stairs,</B>
<P><B>you would hear voices, but noone was there.  Not only my family, and</B>
<P><B>myself felt it, but visitors to our house also felt like there was</B>
<P><B>someone standing at the top of the stairs, you felt like someone was</B>
<P><B>going to reach out and touch you, noone ever walked down those

stairs,</B>
<P><B>we ran.</B>
<P><B>When I was a child, and my bedroom was on the second floor, I remember

a</B>
<P><B>few times a kind of foggy figure passing by my door, to the point I</B>
<P><B>would look out to see who was in the hall, and would find noone

there.</B>
<P><B>One Christmas, when I was 5 years old, we were all packing up, to take

a</B>
<P><B>holiday vacation in Florida to visit relatives down there for the</B>
<P><B>holiday.  My older sister, went to pack her swimsuit, and could not

find</B>
<P><B>it, we all looked all over for it, and could not find it, (her

bedroom,</B>
<P><B>was on the second floor, and was to later be my bedroom).  My parents</B>
<P><B>gave up, and wound up buying her a new one.  The odd part is, when
we</B>
<P><B>got back, and she was putting her things away, she opened up her

dresser</B>
<P><B>drawer, and right there on top in plain sight, where everyone had</B>
<P><B>looked, and there was no way it could of been missed, sat her

swimsuit,</B>
<P><B>nicely folded.</B>
<P><B>My mom, had a doll blanket, that my great grandmother, had made her

when</B>
<P><B>she was a little girl, she kept it in the attic, in an old trunk.

 That</B>
<P><B>too disappeared never to be seen again, and none of us children ever</B>
<P><B>remembered seeing it, let alone taking it.</B>
<P><B>One day, an old man stopped by, it turns out, that he grew up in the</B>
<P><B>area, he told my parents, that the two old cedar trees in the front

yard</B>
<P><B>were either two grave markers, or marked the entrance to the

cemetary,</B>
<P><B>but they were definitely connected to a cemetary.</B>
<P><B>Well my biological father who was an abusive man died when I was</B>
<P><B>seventeen years old, my mom had filed for a divorce, he was living
in</B>
<P><B>the house, and my mom was staying with her parents, but my father had</B>
<P><B>been ordered to evacuate the premises, since the land belonged to my</B>
<P><B>mom's dad, and he had given it to her, and was in her name only.  My</B>
<P><B>father left the house reluctantly the day before the divorce, was to

go</B>
<P><B>to court, and was in the process of moving in with his mother, he was</B>
<P><B>angry with my mother, and had on more than one occasion had

threatened</B>
<P><B>to kill my mother.</B>
<P><B>Well in the process of the moving, he died of a massive heart attack.

 I</B>
<P><B>and my oldest sister think he killed himself, not purposely, but none</B>
<P><B>the less killed himself.  For one it was kind of ironic that he died

the</B>
<P><B>day before the divorce.  My father was a diabetic, and loved to play

a</B>
<P><B>kind of Russian Roullette with his insulin, he would purposely not

take</B>
<P><B>his insulin, and wind up going into diabetic shock, just to make

people</B>
<P><B>feel sorry for him.  If my mom was gone somewhere, when it was time

for</B>
<P><B>his insulin, he would refuse to give it to himself.</B>
<P><B>My father always accused my mom of fooling around on him, even though

my</B>
<P><B>mom was truthful to the him, until the day he died.  So I guess it</B>
<P><B>didn't take anyone by surprise that he would be mad, when my mom</B>
<P><B>remarried, exactly one year to the day of his death.  Espescially

after</B>
<P><B>all of us kids were grown and moved out.  Mom and Chet (my step-dad)

had</B>
<P><B>closed off the second floor, and noone went up there anymore, at

least</B>
<P><B>no earthly being.</B>
<P><B>My mom, and Chet would lock the doors, and turn off the lights, and</B>
<P><B>would leave for a while, and would return, to find all of the lights

on</B>
<P><B>upstairs, and the doors were all still locked.  They also would have

a</B>
<P><B>smell of cigarrette smoke waif down from upstairs, and noone ever

smoked</B>
<P><B>in that house after my dad died, and he was a heavy chain smoker.

 Also</B>
<P><B>mom would cook meals, and Chet would be outside, so mom would turn

the</B>
<P><B>burners down to warm, and leave the kitchen, to await my step dad</B>
<P><B>comming in, a few minutes later she would smell something burning,

and</B>
<P><B>would return to the kitchen to find the burners on high, and the food</B>
<P><B>burning.</B>
<P><B>My mom and Chet had just built a new house, a short distance from the</B>
<P><B>old one, and were in the process of moving in.  The last night they</B>
<P><B>spent in the old house, things went really wrong.  My mom, and Chet

had</B>
<P><B>gone to bed, and were awakened to noises comming from the kitchen,

when</B>
<P><B>they got up and went to check it out, they found the cupboard doors,

and</B>
<P><B>drawers opening and shutting, pots, pans, and lids flying around. 

The</B>
<P><B>next day they moved out completely, and the house shortly there after</B>
<P><B>the house was torn down, and the hauntings for them ended, but not

for</B>
<P><B>me.</B>
<P><B>I startes having strange dreams.  In one of the dreams, I am standing

in</B>
<P><B>my brothers old room, which was part of the orriginal house.  In this</B>
<P><B>room, there is old wooden furniture, including a wooden bed, there

was</B>
<P><B>no plaster or paint on the walls, you could see the eaves, there was

no</B>
<P><B>carpet on the floor, just a plain wooden floor, and sitting on the</B>
<P><B>floor, where there should of been an attic door, sat a little girl,</B>
<P><B>dressed in 1800's clothes, she did not say anything to me, but Igot

the</B>
<P><B>distinct impression, that her name was Sarah, but there was also the</B>
<P><B>name Amanda, I am not sure of the connection between those two names,</B>
<P><B>but I am sure her name is Sarah.</B>
<P><B>Well shortly thereafter, I told my mom, about this dream, at first

she</B>
<P><B>thought I was remembering me, and something I did in this room, until

I</B>
<P><B>described the room, and then she told me that, that was the orriginal</B>
<P><B>lay out of this room, something that I had never seen, because it was</B>
<P><B>redone, long before I was born, and my parents had not talked about

it,</B>
<P><B>so there was no way, I would know this.</B>
<P><B>That was not the end of my dreams, I had another dream, where I was

in</B>
<P><B>that room, and it looked like I remembered it, but there was no</B>
<P><B>furniture in it.  This time, unlike the last dream, I was frightened,</B>
<P><B>and there was this ominous voice saying Sarah, Sarah, everyone loves</B>
<P><B>Sarah, but the tone they were using was frightening.  I did not see</B>
<P><B>anyone this time, but I began running, and the voice was calling

after</B>
<P><B>me, and being frightened, I remember calling to Sarah, to help me,
I</B>
<P><B>don't know why, but I felt she could protect me from that voice

somehow,</B>
<P><B>and as I am running, it is like the floor was like jello, and it was</B>
<P><B>collapsing.  When I finally got outside in the yard, and turned

around</B>
<P><B>to look, the windows, looked like someone had heavily coated them

with</B>
<P><B>black paint.  That was the last dream I had about that old house, but</B>
<P><B>after that when I would go to visit, at the new house, when I would

go</B>
<P><B>to leave I got the distinct impression I was not in my car alone. 
I</B>
<P><B>felt like my dad was in the car, and if I would turn around, and look

in</B>
<P><B>the backseat, I would find him there.  Finally I told him he was</B>
<P><B>frightening me, and though I loved him, he needed to go, and leave
me in</B>
<P><B>peace.</B>
<P><B>Now I only feel his presence, and the eery presence of another, when

I</B>
<P><B>stand on the location of that old house.  I am not the only one, that</B>
<P><B>feels his presence there, so does my oldest sister.</B>
<P><B>I also have the nack of touching a picture, even one I am unfamiliar</B>
<P><B>with, one of people I don't know, and places I have never been, and

tell</B>
<P><B>you more than what's in the picture, things, that I would not have

any</B>
<P><B>way of knowing.  I tell you this, because, there is something about

my</B>
<P><B>father's picture that I need to tell you about.  My maternal</B>
<P><B>grandparents died within a few short years, after my fathers death.</B>
<P><B>When I touch a picture of a good person, I can sense they are in

peace,</B>
<P><B>and sometimes I can converse with them, but if it is a picture of a

bad</B>
<P><B>person, or something evil, I see a cold black, to the point goose

bumps</B>
<P><B>rise up, and I cannot look at those pictures long.</B>
<P><B>Well my fathers favorite part of the old house was in the living

room,</B>
<P><B>just inside the archway, thst seperates the living room from the</B>
<P><B>diningroom.  Well when I touch a picture of the living room, I find</B>
<P><B>myself standing on the dining room side of the archway, but I cannot

see</B>
<P><B>in the living room, all yousee is a real heavy blackness, one you

cannot</B>
<P><B>peer through, and in that archway stand my maternal grandparents, and</B>
<P><B>they will not let me past them into that living room.  it is almost

like</B>
<P><B>they are protecting me from what is on the other side, and I get the</B>
<P><B>distinct feeling it has to do with my father.  When I touch pictures

of</B>
<P><B>my father, I see only a cold black darkness, to the point I cannot

stand</B>
<P><B>to touch his picture.</B>
<P><B>Also one of the apartments I lived in, before I moved where I live

now,</B>
<P><B>was also haunted.  Noone knows why, we just all started regarding him

as</B>
<P><B>Herman.  it was an old house built in the 1940's, and them turned into

5</B>
<P><B>apartments.  At first I thought it was my imagination, until an

incident</B>
<P><B>happened, with witnesses in my apartment.</B>
<P><B>One of the witnesses, was a previous tenant of my apartment, her and

her</B>
<P><B>toddler were there, and another adult friend, and her 4 year old, and

7</B>
<P><B>year old were all sitting in the living room, in full view of the</B>
<P><B>kitchen where I was facing the west wall peeling potatos, over a

trash</B>
<P><B>can, along that wall.  Well directly behind me, about 8 feet away,

sat</B>
<P><B>my microwave, with a can of peas on it. They sat on the counter. 

Well</B>
<P><B>we were talking back and forth.  My visitors told me, they watched

the</B>
<P><B>can of peas lift up off of the microwave, be carried across the room,</B>
<P><B>and put on the floor nice and neatly on the floor behind me.  I

turned</B>
<P><B>around just as it sat on the floor.</B>
<P><B>I looked at my friends, and asked them if they saw that.  They had</B>
<P><B>watched it in wide open disbelief, they confirmed they saw it, and
it</B>
<P><B>was not my imagination. I asked my friend, who used to be a tenant

there</B>
<P><B>if she had any strange things go on, when they lived here, and she

said</B>
<P><B>yes.  it was the same things, that I had witnessed in my apartment,</B>
<P><B>lights switching themselves on, large vents being turned on, t.v.</B>
<P><B>turning on and off, and changing chanels, doors opening and closing

on</B>
<P><B>their own, cold spots, espescially in the bedroom, and the closet in

the</B>
<P><B>bedroom.</B>
<P><B>The whole time I lived there I could never sleep in that bedroom, and</B>
<P><B>when other people would stay there, they too, felt uncomfortable in

that</B>
<P><B>room.  Espescially children, they would not sleep the whole night

there.</B>
<P><B>I would soon find them out in the living room.  I have two cats, that</B>
<P><B>would go in that bedroom very reluctantly.  The closet there was used</B>
<P><B>for storage only.  The ghosts never seemed to bother anyone in the</B>
<P><B>livingroom, or kitchen, just the bedroom, and yes things went on in

the</B>
<P><B>other rooms, it just never scared us, like the bedroom did.</B>
<P><B>The other tenants in the other apartments, had similar encounters.</B>
<P><B>There were times you could hear footsteps, and voices going upstairs,</B>
<P><B>and look out, but not find anyone out there.  My friend who was one

of</B>
<P><B>the previous tenants of my apartment said, her, and her husband found</B>
<P><B>out, that some man had killed himself in my bedroom.</B>
<P><B>Ironically, I think he, or another spirit, moved with me.  i now live

in</B>
<P><B>a apartment, that was just built 2 years ago, and nooneever died

here,</B>
<P><B>but things go on here, the doors will open all by themselves, you

will</B>
<P><B>hear noises in the other room, and go to look and noone is there.</B>
<P><B>Whoever it is, or whatever it is, seems to be friendly, and mean no</B>
<P><B>harm, and it does not bother the cats.</B>

<H3><A NAME=mary>The Queen Mary</A>
</H3><P><B>by klarick@san.rr.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I've been trying to find a description of my experience </B>
<P><B>aboard the Queen Mary, but so far have been unable to do so. I thought
I would </B>
<P><B>send it along to you in the hopes of hearing that others have seen
the same </B>
<P><B>thing. &nbsp;This happened about five years ago when my husband </B>
<P><B>and I were on one of the "behind-the-scenes" tours. The "Ghost </B>
<P><B>Tour" is specifically designed to point out the sites of the many </B>
<P><B>paranormal experiences reported by passengers, crew and visitors.

Throughout </B>
<P><B>most of the tour, which seemed a bit stagey; or theatrical to me, I
</B>
<P><B>was interested but felt no strong presence of anything unusual. This

changed </B>
<P><B>dramatically in two spots; the engine room spaces and the pool room.
I </B>
<P><B>definitely felt the presence of the men described by our tour guide
and by </B>
<P><B>several other accounts that I've read on the Internet, including your

</B>
<P><B>site.&amp;nbsp; It is my experience in the Pool area that remains unique.

My husband </B>
<P><B>and I were the last two to enter the area, due primarily to my reluctance.

As </B>
<P><B>soon as the tour guide opened the doors, I was struck by a very powerful

feeling </B>
<P><B>of shock and dismay. In fact, it was so strong a sensation that I was

stopped in </B>
<P><B>my tracks. My husband took my arm and walked into the area with me
and other </B>
<P><B>than an intense feeling of discomfort, everything looked normal. We

listened to </B>
<P><B>the guide describe the sightings experienced there, i.e. the laughter
of </B>
<P><B>children, the old woman in the 1930's bathing costume, etc. The stories

were </B>
<P><B>compelling, but I experienced nothing, that is until our group was
leaving. As </B>
<P><B>we walked out of there area, I was gripped by the same powerful feeling

that I </B>
<P><B>had experienced upon entering. I turned around to look behind me. The
pool was </B>
<P><B>full of water and there were almost two dozen people milling around
both in and </B>
<P><B>out of the pool. I could very clearly see the figure of a young girl,

perhaps </B>
<P><B>12-14 years of age, floating face down in the water. It was clear from
the </B>
<P><B>expression of terror on the faces looking on that she had drowned.
When I was </B>
<P><B>finally able to call out to my husband, the vision had disappeared.
I </B>
<P><B>experienced nothing else on the rest of the tour. &nbsp;I would be
greatly interested in knowing whether </B>
<P><B>anyone else has had this experience. Thank you.</B>

</H3><P><B>by eva0879@hotmail.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is going back a while and it may sound dodgy but I used to always

</B>
<P><B>see a man dressed in black wearing a black hat. I used to see him really

</B>
<P><B>as a sillouette. It has been present in 3 different houses but always
as </B>
<P><B>the same person. The time I would like to refer too though is a time
</B>
<P><B>when I was downs stairs at night making myself a drink and the lights

</B>
<P><B>wern't on because I just couldn't be arsed to put them on. Any how
as I </B>
<P><B>made my drink I walked in to the living room and as I did so I bumped
in </B>
<P><B>to a man who I thought was my step dad' I apoligised and turned around.

</B>
<P><B>Then I realised I was the only one up so I turned back and no one was

</B>
<P><B>there. I shouted up stairs to my step dad to see if he was there and
he </B>
<P><B>was up stairs in his bedroom. I Had one more quick look in the living

</B>
<P><B>room but it was empty. That was one of the strangest encounters with
him </B>
<P><B>i've had.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have met him properly once more (I assume) but this was in a dream.

</B>
<P><B>The dream revolved around a spider being brought back to life) Points
I </B>
<P><B>have noticed about him was he moves irratically (almost as if like
there </B>
<P><B>were a few frames missing from a cartoon),at a distance he looks </B>
<P><B>shapeless and when I try to draw him people say that i've drawn

myself.</B>
<P><B>This is NOT bs and I was wondering if you have heard anything like
</B>
<P><B>it before. If so let me know.</B>

</H3><P><B>by VEtter1691@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Enterprise, AL, 1982, my husband committed suicide.  He was a mean,

spiteful</B>
<P><B>alcoholic.  The marriage only lasted 2 years.  I was on my way out,
and I</B>
<P><B>think he knew it.	</B>
<P><B>About a year later, small unexplained things started happening:  A
couple of</B>
<P><B>things (at different times) would disappear and though I would search
high and</B>
<P><B>low, they were nowhere to be found.  After a few days, they would end
up right</B>
<P><B>where they had always been.  (Everyone thought it was a joke)  Not

me.</B>
<P><B>Christmas Eve 1984, I was sound asleep, when something made me wake
up.  (NO,</B>
<P><B>I WAS NOT DREAMING)  I froze in position.  A man was standing beside
my bed</B>
<P><B>staring down at me.  I was afraid that if I moved he would know I was

awake.</B>
<P><B>I was hoping that if I stayed still he would take what he wanted and
leave me</B>
<P><B>alone.  I was so scared.  My heart was racing, I broke out in a sweat,
but all</B>
<P><B>I could do was lie perfectly still.  While I was still watching him,
he faded</B>
<P><B>away.  Just like that.  One minute there, the next gone.</B>
<P><B>The very next night, the same thing.  In the middle of the night I
woke up to</B>
<P><B>see a man leaning over my dresser. It appeared he was writing something

and</B>
<P><B>kept looking up at me.  This lasted for maybe a minute also.  I never
saw him</B>
<P><B>again after that night.</B>
<P><B>Small things continued over the years.  Nothing bad, just weird.  Toilet

paper</B>
<P><B>would unroll all the way by itself, hanging plants would swing back
and forth,</B>
<P><B>no air, wind, etc....., the bed would feel as if someone sat on it.
 Oh well,</B>
<P><B>no one else believes me, maybe you will.  I don't live there anymore,
but I've</B>
<P><B>often wanted to talk to the people who do to see if they've ever had

anything</B>
<P><B>happen to them.</B>

<P>
<P><B>My wife and I lived in a very old house in a small southern Michigan
town .</B>
<P><B>We had a small dog. I must tell, you first of all, that the town is
very,</B>
<P><B>very old.  The home we had was also very old.  Well, needless to say,
one</B>
<P><B>night my wife and I were getting ready to go to bed. Just before we
decided</B>
<P><B>to go to bed, my wife put out a blanket on the floor just outside our</B>
<P><B>bedroom for the dog to lay down on (this was a nightly ritual).  I
then</B>
<P><B>retired to the bedroom and my wife went to brush her teeth. I closed
the</B>
<P><B>door lightly behind me and sat laid down on the bed to read. </B>
<P>
<P><B>I was 5-mins in to a really good book when my wife called me out into
the</B>
<P><B>hallway.  Our little dog was looking confused at both of us and as
we looked</B>
<P><B>into another room, we could see the blanket, folded in thirds on the
end of</B>
<P><B>one of the guests bed. We both could not but laugh - we suggested that
the</B>
<P><B>ghost do the dishes in the sink.</B>
<P>
<P><B>A few days later, the landlord was sharing memories of his late wife,
and</B>
<P><B>what a neat house she happened to keep.  He further stated that she
hated it</B>
<P><B>when the kids left coats or anything else laying around on the floor.</B>

</H3><P><B>by angel2969@webtv.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>I still don't know if what I experienced is a haunting or what.  I
have</B>
<P><B>never mentioned it to anyone. I didn't want them to think I was
crazy,</B>
<P><B>but I know what happened and it was real.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My son had just left for school and I had taken the day off from work</B>
<P><B>because I wasn't feeling very well.  It was just a cold, but the
sinus</B>
<P><B>pain was giving me a horrible headache.  I didn't take anything for
the</B>
<P><B>headache though. I will suffer with all kinds of pain for hours
before</B>
<P><B>finally taking something.  I just wanted to tell you that so you
would</B>
<P><B>know I wasn't on medication when this incident happened.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I decided to lay down for awhile thinking that it would help with the</B>
<P><B>pain. I need to explain how I was lying in bed, so you will get an
idea</B>
<P><B>why what happened  scared me so bad.  I covered up with a blanket and
my</B>
<P><B>right hand was on my chest and my left hand was on my stomach.  I was</B>
<P><B>lying on my back and the sunlight was across my face, but it wasn't</B>
<P><B>annoying or anything.  What happened next is something I will never</B>
<P><B>forget.</B>
<P><B>I was lying there with my eyes closed, when I felt something walk by
me.</B>
<P><B>It went black in front of my closed eyes.  You know how when your
eyes</B>
<P><B>are closed but the sun is shining across them and you can still see
the</B>
<P><B>light a little but if someone walks in front of it, it blacks out?
 Well</B>
<P><B>that is what happened and when I tried to open my eyes to see why,
I</B>
<P><B>discovered that I couldn't move.  It was like I was paralyzed.  I
felt</B>
<P><B>as though I couldn't breathe and my hands felt as though they were</B>
<P><B>pinned at my sides and it felt as though the blanket was pulled over
my</B>
<P><B>face.  I tried to scream and found I had no voice at all.  I couldn't</B>
<P><B>move a muscle.  It felt like hours but I think it was just a few
seconds</B>
<P><B>and then I could move and breathe.  When I started to sit up in the
bed,</B>
<P><B>I realized that my hands were where they had been when I first laid</B>
<P><B>down, not pinned at the side like it felt when I couldn't move and
the</B>
<P><B>blanket was still down near my chest area where it had been when I
first</B>
<P><B>laid down.  Needless to say, I bolted from the room.</B>
<P><B>That was just one incident.  I have also heard what sounds like</B>
<P><B>footsteps walking up and down my hallway when I am in the basement.</B>
<P><B>Sometimes when I am in the living room or bedrooms, I can hear
footsteps</B>
<P><B>and doors being opened and closed.  One day when I was in the
basement</B>
<P><B>doing laundry it sounded like someone was upstairs, so I went up and</B>
<P><B>checked, but no one was in the house.  I latched the screen door and</B>
<P><B>went back downstairs, the next thing I know it sounded like every
door</B>
<P><B>in the house slammed shut at the same time.  I came running upstairs
but</B>
<P><B>all the doors down the hall were still opened like they had been when
I</B>
<P><B>went downstairs.  It totally freaked me out.   One other day when my
son</B>
<P><B>was at school, I thought I heard a little kid yell "Mommy" I went</B>
<P><B>looking for the source but I didn't find anything and I only heard
it</B>
<P><B>that one time.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I just want to know it was that I experienced when I was lying on the</B>
<P><B>bed.  It only happened that one time, but it still made it very hard
for</B>
<P><B>me to feel comfortable in my bedroom.  I sleep on the couch now
because</B>

<H3><A NAME=get>Get Out</A>
</H3><P><B>by JGisler596@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I live in a old apartment building in St. Cloud Minnesota. </B>
<P><B>I live on the second floor of the building. The floor plan of the building
is different than most. There are 4 front entry ways to the building ( the
building has wings) and there are also private back entryways to each apartment.
There are also 2 doors the lead into the basement of the building. I do not
know the approximate age of the building, but each apartment has the old
ice box containers. The containers are like the kinds that you would put
huge blockes of ice in. </B>
<P><B>Well where do I begin? First I do feel safe in MY apartment, I have
seen out of the corner of my eye a black/gray fuzzy cloud like mass that
leaps out of my sons bedroom and into the hallway that leads into the kitchen.
Also the closet in my sons bedroom is quite cold along with the hallway closet.
Now for the basement. Each front entry way has a staircase that leads to
each door on each floor. (only one apartment per floor) The basement os very
old and dark and cold. When I go into the basement I get frozen with fear.
The whole building is very long, and in the basement there is an old huge
iron sliding door(about halfway across through the basement)&gt; Upon entering
the basement the fear hits right when you cross through the door. When you
descend the stairs you can go north or south. When I cross the huge doorway(the
iron door) on the south side of the building I freeze in fear. I have seen
(almost every time I go to that side of the building ) A large opaque black
thing in a particular corner. You can feel the way it is watching. The last
time I saw it I was glued to looking at the top of it, almost as if I was
looking into someones eyes. Well I usually run up the stairs all the way
into my apartment, the whole time it feels like there is someone after me
and that they are just about to grab my leg or shoulder. I do know that there
is an apartment in the basement that has been sealed up for many yaers but
that it all I know. I rarely go into the basement, and when I do I never
go alone. But my problem is that the washer and dryers are down there, and
i need to do my laundry. But i will tell you this I am too terrified to go
down there. I feel in danger, and usually i have nightmares after being in
the basement for a long period of time. I would like help in finding the
history of this building, and how I can make myself feel better because I
do live here and need to wash my clothes. The feeling that you get when you
enter the basement is not like a victim or a nice person or even a "demon",
but it is like a really really really bad person is there waiting for you.</B>

<H3><A NAME=others>Ghost Truck and Others</A>
</H3><P><B>by rgak@vfr.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>The first experience I had with a spirit, indirectly, took place when
I</B>
<P><B>was sixteen.  I was attending a wedding at the Seventh Day Adventist
Church</B>
<P><B>in Loma Linda, California, sitting next to my mother, when she
suddenly</B>
<P><B>seemed startled.  I asked her what was wrong.  She said she had just
seen</B>
<P><B>her mother, who lived in Florida, standing next to her, and was sure
she</B>
<P><B>had died.  About two hours later we received a call that my grandmother
had</B>
<P><B>died.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	About ten years later a good friend of my committed suicide in Toronto.
 I</B>
<P><B>was living in Napa County at the time, and the night she died I awoke
to</B>
<P><B>see her standing beside my bed with blood on both wrists.  She said
"I'm</B>
<P><B>sorry," and then slowly faded away.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	About two years later I was going to night school.  My wife and I
lived in</B>
<P><B>a small house with a living-dining room, a kitchen, bedroom, and bath,
on</B>
<P><B>the east side, and a larger room we called the "studio" where we kept</B>
<P><B>everything that didn't go somewhere else on the south side.  There
was a</B>
<P><B>short flight of four stairs up to the studio, and a small landing at
the</B>
<P><B>top.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	I came home from school one night to find my wife a little shacken.
 She</B>
<P><B>said she had seen a young Spanish-looking women with light skin, long
black</B>
<P><B>hair, and a red dress, come out of the studio, stand on the landing
and</B>
<P><B>look at her, and say "Tell them, tell them."  She didn't say what she</B>
<P><B>wanted told, or who.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	I went up to the studio - there was only one door, and no way in from
the</B>
<P><B>outside except through a window.  All the windows were closed and the</B>
<P><B>screens in place (it was winter).  There was a place about 4 or 5 feet
in</B>
<P><B>diameter in front of one window that fell ice-cold to me, although
the rest</B>
<P><B>of the room was only cool.  We talked about it, and I asked a local</B>
<P><B>policeman if there were any records that someone might have died out
there</B>
<P><B>sometime in the past.  He did some research, told me there were rumors
in</B>
<P><B>some old files but nothing definite.  About a week later my wife saw
the</B>
<P><B>ghost again, who stood at the top of the stairs and said "Tell them,
tell</B>
<P><B>them," and then faded away.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	I didn't see her, and my wife never saw her again.  We stayed in
that</B>
<P><B>house another year, and that place in the south-east corner of the
studio</B>
<P><B>was also ice cold, even in mid-summer with 90 and 100 degree
temperatures.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	Now I lived in the Sierra foothills about ten miles east of Lincoln,</B>
<P><B>California, at the time of a steep driveway.  Each morning when I go
to</B>
<P><B>work I stop at the bottom of the driveway and lock the gate.  I can
see</B>
<P><B>down the road about 300 yards until it turns behind a hill.  One
morning</B>
<P><B>this summer I saw a white Dodge 1-ton pickup comming up the road with
its</B>
<P><B>lights on as I got out to lock the gate, maybe 150-200 yards away.
 It was</B>
<P><B>light, although the sun wasn't over the hill yet.  This wasn't
unusual,</B>
<P><B>since I'm in ranch country and pickups go up and down the road all
the</B>
<P><B>time.  When I turned around, expecting the truck to be just about up
to</B>
<P><B>where I was, it had disappeared.  There are two other driveways in
between</B>
<P><B>where I first saw it and mine, but I can see both from my gate, and
it</B>
<P><B>wasn't on either.  It was just gone.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	About three weeks ago, we had a pregnant cow in trouble with a calf
that</B>
<P><B>it couldn't birth.  The calf was stuck, and we couldn't pull it, so
we</B>
<P><B>called the vet.  My girlfriend and I drove down to the gate to waive
down</B>
<P><B>the vet so she wouldn't miss the drive in the dark.  After awhile we
saw</B>
<P><B>her truck coming up the road, with another about 50 yards behind. 
I waived</B>
<P><B>her down and she turned into our driveway, and the truck behind her
just</B>
<P><B>vanished.  My girlfiriend saw it too. &nbsp;	We call it the "ghost
truck."</B>

<H3><A NAME=effie>Effie</A>
</H3><P><B>by GRGammon@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>When thinking of paranormal hot-spots, Oklahoma seems to be the last
on</B>
<P><B>peoples' minds.  As a native all of my like I can swear to you that
this</B>
<P><B>prejudice is completley wrong.  Oklahoma has a wide range of
paranormal</B>
<P><B>phenomena.  One of our more famous haunts is the the Scurvin Hotel
located in</B>
<P><B>down town Oklahoma city.  The Scurvin Hotel was built in the early
1900's and</B>
<P><B>has had many a controversial reputation, from being a speak-easy durring
the</B>
<P><B>"roaring-twenties" to a rumoured place of satanic worship in the 80's.
 It is</B>
<P><B>primarily known, however, for it's reputed hauntings.  As one approaches
the</B>
<P><B>hotel one is taken in by it's gothic appeal.  Huge gargoyles converge
on the</B>
<P><B>rooftops and ledges and Austrian chandeliers sway at the slightest
breeze.</B>
<P><B>After befriending a guard and former hotel staff employee I was told
the</B>
<P><B>"story" which I will now share with the reader.  Apparantly the owner
of the</B>
<P><B>building, whose name I will keep secret for obvious reasons, had an
ilicit</B>
<P><B>affair with a maid under his employement.  No one remembers her name
but many</B>
<P><B>refer to her as "Effie".  Effie concieved, and in order to prevent
a scandal,</B>
<P><B>was kept in an out of the way room on a top floor.  As the days passed
Effie</B>
<P><B>gew more and more depressed.  After the baby was born it becam obvious
to her</B>
<P><B>that she would remain a prisoner in her room until the child was of
a decent</B>
<P><B>age.  Growing ever more despondant, Effie took her baby in her arms
and</B>
<P><B>escaped the only way she knew how by leaping out of the window.  Guest
staying</B>
<P><B>there have reported being unable to sleep due to the consistant crying
of an</B>
<P><B>infant.  When records were checked there were never any sighns that
a couple</B>
<P><B>with a child had rented a room.  Tales stranger than this abound.
 Apparntly</B>
<P><B>Effie was a woman of loose morals in life and kept this trait in death,
also.</B>
<P><B>Male guests have reported being "propositioned" by a female voice while
alone</B>
<P><B>in their rooms.  Many men have also reported seeing the figure of a
naked</B>
<P><B>woman while showering.  One man even claimed that he was sexualy assaulted
by</B>
<P><B>an invisible entity.  In the 80's a team of parapsychologists from
the</B>
<P><B>University of Oklahoma came to investigate the site.  I am personaly
not aware</B>
<P><B>of their findings but have been told that many strange events occured.
One</B>
<P><B>event involved the moving of a maid's cart by an unseen force.  The
team</B>
<P><B>concluded that the phenomena seems to be only associated with men.
 No female</B>
<P><B>guest has reported seeing the appartion of Effie.  The alleged ghost
of the</B>
<P><B>infant is another matter.  All of the guests who reported being unable
to</B>
<P><B>sleep because of an infant crying were female.  Many women have also
reported</B>
<P><B>the sudden smell of talcum powder in the air while no supplies were
kept by</B>
<P><B>the hotel.  The phenomena for the most part remained neutral or at
best</B>
<P><B>mischievious.  Durring the mid-80's, however, the phenomena took a
more</B>
<P><B>sinester twist.  While being renivated several construction workers
reported</B>
<P><B>accidents that couldn't have been mere coincidences.  Many of these
accidents</B>
<P><B>involved power tools that the men swore that had been unplugged or
turned off.</B>
<P><B>The foreman refused to believe in the rumours of the hotel being haunted
until</B>
<P><B>he had his own encounter.  Stopping to use the bathroom in a facility
that</B>
<P><B>hadn't been used by the guest or employees in years, he heard her</B>
<P><B>unmistakeable voice.  He had just zipped his fly when a female voice
whispered</B>
<P><B>"I can see your - - - - "!   Stories such as these abound.  Unfortunately
the</B>
<P><B>hotel was closed in the late 80's.  The building lies abondend today
and the</B>
<P><B>city is still debating it's future. Many prospective buyers have wanted
to</B>
<P><B>turn the hotel into a cassino but with Oklahoma's anti-gambling laws
this is</B>
<P><B>merely a pipe dream.  The hotel itself is still quite popular, espicialy
with</B>
<P><B>the teenage crowd who have turned it into a local hang-out.  The
haunting</B>
<P><B>activity has not diminished in the least.  Many people have reported
seeing</B>
<P><B>the image of woman stairing out one of the windows or sitting on a
ledge.</B>
<P><B>These sightings become even more believable when one realizes that
a lot of</B>
<P><B>these witnesses have no prior knowledge of the haunting.  In one instance
the</B>
<P><B>police were called to the site.  Knowing the history, they claimed
that it was</B>
<P><B>probably a homeless person rather than admiting that it might have
a basis in</B>
<P><B>the paranormal.  If you are ever in the area I personaly invite you
to check</B>
<P><B>out one of Oklahoma's more "spooky" sites.  If you have knowledge of
other</B>
<P><B>paranormal acitivity in the state of Oklahoma or would like to share
your own</B>
<P><B>experiences feel free to e-mail me at GRGammon@AOL.com.  I am looking
forward</B>
<P><B>to all corespondence. Sorry I am adding this to the end, but I just
remembered</B>
<P><B>that recently a destraught teenage couple killed themselves by jumping
off of</B>
<P><B>the roof of the hotel parking garage.  It seems that the hotel has
gained some</B>
<P><B>new residences. </B>

<H3><A NAME=snowy>Snowy</A>
</H3><P><B>by PANTERANED@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I've recently moved into a house that we beliee is haunted. i had
heard</B>
<P><B>the stories before i moved in  (and please note that this does not
seem</B>
<P><B>to be a hostile entity) and with no fear, moved in. we affectionatly</B>
<P><B>refer to this spirit as "Snowy"  because he makes his presence known</B>
<P><B>mostly in the wintertime.  my boyfriends experiances outnumber mine
but</B>
<P><B>he has lived here longer. so, without further ado i will tell the
tales.</B>
<P><B>brian's first experiance was in the basment. he and his former
roomate,</B>
<P><B>bud, were checking out the possibility of putting a weight bench
there</B>
<P><B>when they  found a room with an electric organ and a lit light in it.
No</B>
<P><B>matter what they tried the light would not shut off. Finally, Bud got</B>
<P><B>pissed and kicked the light repeatedly until it went out. that is
when</B>
<P><B>the strange things started to happen. the first oddity was the sound
of</B>
<P><B>footsteps in the upstairs apartment, though nobody lived there or had</B>
<P><B>acess to it at those times. the next, very strange thig was in there</B>
<P><B>apt. Bud hadhis two kids here and they were asleep in there room. but</B>
<P><B>bud and brian both heard the sound of feetsie pajamas running in the</B>
<P><B>kitchen. bud even remarked about "the brats being out of bed" but
when</B>
<P><B>he went to yell at them, they were sound asleep and not even wearing</B>
<P><B>feetsie jammies that night.also there  are frequently sounds like</B>
<P><B>sombody walking up to the front door on the porch when nobody is
there.</B>
<P><B>one time, when brian and i went out to investigate we even heard</B>
<P><B>footsteps in the snow, but saw no footprints. also a distinct sound
of</B>
<P><B>glass breaking in the living room has interrupted many games of pool
in</B>
<P><B>the next room, and have been heard by as many as 6 people in the same</B>
<P><B>room at the same time. whenwe got a new dog, her first day here was</B>
<P><B>spent barking at a wall. even aggresively jumping at the nothing..
my</B>
<P><B>sister now lives in the upstairs apt. and has had many things happen
to</B>
<P><B>her as well. she was wok up 3 mornings in a row to her daughters
 clock</B>
<P><B>radio on the religios station.the clock was not set, nor did she
haveit</B>
<P><B>tuned to religios station, EVER. and being that her dughter isn't even
2</B>
<P><B>yet and the radio is out of her reach, that is not areasonable answer</B>
<P><B>either. afriend suggested replacing the light in the celler room, and</B>
<P><B>maybe then snowy would go back down cellar. but right now we are
content</B>
<P><B>to live with snowy, until it proves to be a hotie or angry ghost.</B>

<H3><A NAME=house>The House Of Many Ghosts</A>
</H3><P><B>by gulls5@iinet.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Since my family and I have moved in to our Temecula, California house,
we have had many encounters with ghosts or spirits who reside with us.  I
will tell you of several encounters we have had here since moving in on July
27, 1994.  I am married and have two sons and one daughter.</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>The first time was when my oldest son Joseph and I were home alone
on the computor.  We were having a great time playing games when suddenly
we heard people, unfamiliar voices to us, talking.  We looked over at the
table in the kitchen and a pocket tape recorder had suddenly been turned
on and the voices on it were not ours.  My son got up and turned it off,
accusing me of playing some trick on him.  I accused him of the same.  There
was no possibility of a prank as we were both glued to the computor game
and the recorder was on a table about 20 feet away.</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>Another day my son Joseph and I were on the computor, and we had the
t.v. turned up so we could hear a show as we played.  Suddenly the t.v. was
turned down real low.  I said "Curt are you home?"  (Curt is my husband).
 I got no answer, so my son and I got up and walked around to the livingroom.
 Noone else was home.  My son swore then that our house was haunted.</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>One day I was home alone, and I heard talking upstairs.  I got scared
and wasn't sure if I should call the police first or check it out.  So I
grabbed a knife out of the kitchen, and headed upstairs.  I first checked
Christophers room, (my second son), and I heard talking coming from behind
me out of the room, I proceeded to Joseph's room, then Kristen's room (my
daughter), at each room I heard the talking from behind me, still not
understanding them.  I went to my room.  I heard nothing.  I went into my
bathroom, heard the sound behind me. Shaking and very scared, I went to look
under my bed, .  Nothing under it.  I went to open my closet door and I hear
a males voice say "turn me off."  I freaked and looked at the t.v. and vcr.
 They were already off.  I looked behind the t.v. stand and there was an
old childs computor that hadn't been used or plugged in, in atleast 8 months.
 Somehow it had gotten plugged in and turned on and it was saying "turn me
off." </B>
<P><B>I turned it off and unplugged it and had a floaty feeling about my
body.</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>After playing ball with my kids and a couple neighborhood kids, we
took a break, as I am disabled and my legs were hurting me, we all sat in
the garage with the door open to relax.  The garage door started to shut.
 We have a garage door opener.  We all looked over to see who was shutting
it and the button was pressed in with noone around it.  Again I felt airy
as I pressed upon the button that was already pressed in.</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>My son one night, as we were all watching t.v. said "did you guys see
that?"  (Which we hadn't), but he swore he saw a midget run from our t.v.
 It scared him, but to this day, he swears he saw it.</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>We all remember Buzz Lightyear right?  We woke up at about 2 or 3 a.m
to here my daughters Buzz Lightyear Bank "protecting the galaxy from the
threat of invasion."  And "Buzz Lightyear To The Rescue."  Since then, Buzz
has gone off to protect the galaxy several times on his own.  It sounds funny
I know, but never the less, I feel that one of the spirits in my home is
that of a child.</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>Throughout these years I have heard footsteps running up and down the
hall.  Seen shadows.  I was on the phone with my sister and said hold on,
I just saw something, again I felt floaty, as she was on the other end saying
you're crazy, I felt that presence right with me.</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>My children and I have heard doors open and shut.  Doors shake.  The
phone rings often with noone on the other end.  I have gotten taps put on
my phone, as star 69 showed that they could not get a number.  Surprisingly,
I recieved no other calls until the day after the phone tap was taken off.
 I had them put it on again, and I got no phone calls until the tap was taken
off.  When we want to get a hold of a family member upstairs, we dial ourselves,
and I am truly starting to believe that a spirit in our home has learned
how to do this from us.</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>The Scariest One Sept. 3rd, 98</B>
<P><B>My husband and I were home and I was studying college algebra, I kept
hearing screaming.  It was really bothering me and I asked my husband, who
is screaming?  He said "I don't hear it."  I had said someone keeps screaming
and I can't concentrate.  I didn't know if it was at the school behind us,
or a neighborhood person, or what.  A while later my daughter came home from
school and said, "Mom, there's noises coming from upstairs."  So I went up
to go into my room.  She said "no mom, in Chris's room."  So I went into
Chris's room and went to the closet.  She followed me, and said "No Mom,
it's this."  And pointed to part of a kickboxing toy.  The boxer wasn't with
it or anything, just one piece.  I said to her "Honey, this doesn't go off
on it's own," and went to grab it.  It screamed right before I picked it
up.  I told my daughter someone is trying to contact me.  I took the toy
down and showed my husband and said "Curt this is what was screaming all
day that bothered me.  Someone is trying to contact me."  He said "you're
probably right, you've been right before."  About 2 to 3 hours later I got
a call from a sister I had recently just met on a talk show telling me that
they found my brother Gerry dead that day.  What's wierd besides, is that
the sister that was adopted out was the 11th child that we were told had
died at birth.  We met in July 1998.  Her adoptive parents named her Jeralyn.
 My brother Gerry hadn't met or talked to her yet.  But less than 2 months
later, Gerry died and left the family.  So a Jeralyn came into the family
that was supposedly dead, and Gerry died and went out of the family at age
39 with a collapsed artery, heart attack.</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>My son Joseph saw what he explained to be a white head shaped sphere
about 6 feet off the ground, bobbing like a head would bob, moving about
the kitchen to the family room.  My son was looking at your site just last
night, 11/24/98, and he feels it was an orb moving about.</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>My daughter saw a reflection in glass of a white adult being behind
her, and turned around to see not an adult, but a white child being walking
up the stairs.  </B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>Our cat and dogs stare at nothing sometimes, or bark or whine, and
I now wonder if they are seeing things that we just don't see.</B>

<H3><A NAME=michael>Michael's House</A>
</H3><P><B>by SamKincaid@webtv.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>In 1987 my brother James bought his first house.  Built in the early</B>
<P><B>1950's, it had been owned by several families over the years but had</B>
<P><B>spent the last few years as a rental property in an otherwise</B>
<P><B>residential neighborhood.</B>
<P>
<P><B>He was very excited and began several renovations in order to make
the</B>
<P><B>house more his own as well as modernize it.  In order to help
expediate</B>
<P><B>the process he invited me to help him in his work during the summer
of</B>
<P><B>1988.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I arrived we immediately began work on the kitchen by tearing
out</B>
<P><B>some linoleum that</B>
<P><B>for some reason had been put down just before James bought the house.</B>
<P><B>After the task was finished, I placed the old flooring in the
basement</B>
<P><B>until it could be carried away. We then broke for lunch to return an</B>
<P><B>hour later.</B>
<P>
<P><B>After lunch we started in on some old kitchen cabinets and I went</B>
<P><B>downstairs to retrieve some tools.  Once in the basement,  I was</B>
<P><B>suprised to see the linoleum I had laid into one pile placed neatly
on</B>
<P><B>the floor nearly in the same configuration it had been before we
pulled</B>
<P><B>it from the kitchen.  There it was placed back together like some
sort</B>
<P><B>of puzzle.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I asked my brother why he had done this and he replied that he hadn't</B>
<P><B>and that I didn't have enough to do with my time.  I put the incident</B>
<P><B>out of my mind and within a few days we finished the work I had come
to</B>
<P><B>town to help him with.</B>
<P>
<P><B>About 3 weeks after I left, my mother mentioned to me that that James</B>
<P><B>was having trouble going on with the rennovations because of severe</B>
<P><B>headaches he had begun to suffer.  It was probably allergies I told
her,</B>
<P><B>but she said the pain was accompanied by severe mood swings and
feelings</B>
<P><B>of paranoia.  I promised her that I would check on him the next
weekend</B>
<P><B>at which time I was to visit him.</B>
<P>
<P><B>That next weekend James was not himself and didn't seem very happy
to</B>
<P><B>have me for a houseguest.  The fact that I had been his only company
n</B>
<P><B>the house since he bought it was brought to my attention by my mother
in</B>
<P><B>our last phone conversation, but with all the work my brother had
been</B>
<P><B>doing, that didn't seem  unusual to me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The first night of that last visit there, I was awakened around 1:00
am</B>
<P><B>by the sound of footsteps going down to the basement.  They were loud</B>
<P><B>and heavy so I  assumed that James was headed to the basement with
some</B>
<P><B>urgent purpose in mind.  I got up to investigate, fearing maybe that</B>
<P><B>there was some leak in the basement or something.  But just as I
stepped</B>
<P><B>out of the guest room, I met James coming out of his room thinking
that</B>
<P><B>I was in the basement.</B>
<P><B>Ofcourse, we both thought that there was a burglar in the house, but
the</B>
<P><B>basement door was latched from the outside (a chld-proofing measure
from</B>
<P><B>an earlier tennent) and all doors and windows in the house were
securely</B>
<P><B>locked.  This couldn't be conclusive proof that there was no one else
in</B>
<P><B>the house, so we were forced to check out the basement.  As soon as
we</B>
<P><B>opened the door to the steps leading down, the sound of heavy-booted</B>
<P><B>clomping began, this time moving down the stairs and into the
basement</B>
<P><B>itself.  The sound of it got louder and louder until  we realized the</B>
<P><B>reason for it was that they were heading back up the steps again.
With</B>
<P><B>all his might my brother slammed the basement door and reaplaced the</B>
<P><B>latch.  But to our terror, the force then began pounding on the door
as</B>
<P><B>though someone very angry was desperately trying to get out of the</B>
<P><B>basement.</B>
<P><B>That was it, we both bolted out the back door and ran to a neighbor's</B>
<P><B>house because we had no keys to either of our cars to get away.</B>
<P>
<P><B>With out even consulting me, James automatically made up a story
about</B>
<P><B>the water pipes making a racket to explain our sudden appearance to
his</B>
<P><B>neighbor.  His neighbor was sympathetic and offered us his spare room</B>
<P><B>and couch for the night. Although  I was relieved James' friend
didn't</B>
<P><B>think we were both insane, I was still highly upset and didn't sleep
at</B>
<P><B>all that night.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>The next day we ventured back into the house in broad day light.</B>
<P><B>Stangely there was no sign of the previous night's disturbance
anywhere.</B>
<P><B>Just when I was beginning to doubt the whole experience, James told
me</B>
<P><B>that there had  been several disturbances in the house in the weeks</B>
<P><B>following his moving in.  But he had written them off as the house</B>
<P><B>"settling" .  It wasn't until </B>
<P><B>the previous night that he remembered what he thought  at first had
been</B>
<P><B>a dream:  One very warm night he awoke from a fitful sleep to see the</B>
<P><B>figure of a man in flannel shirt and ballcap </B>
<P><B>standing at the foot of his bed.  Frozen in terror, James didn't move
or</B>
<P><B>speak.  The spectre said nothing, and my brother could not see its
face</B>
<P><B>and the only feature he could make out was shaggy hair sticking out
from</B>
<P><B>under the cap.</B>
<P><B>It just shook its head in a disapproving way, turned and walked out
the</B>
<P><B>door where it disapeared a few feet later.</B>
<P>
<P><B>After the story, James' voice began to quiver as he told me about the</B>
<P><B>first time he had been shown the house.  While the real estate agent
was</B>
<P><B>showing it to him, the current owners were not home but he did notice
a</B>
<P><B>wedding picture on the wall with some other family shots.  The
wedding</B>
<P><B>picture showed a bearded man  with shaggy hair next to a  smiling
young</B>
<P><B>woman.  The agent told my brother that the couple in the picture were</B>
<P><B>the owners and that tragically the husband, Michael, had been killed
a</B>
<P><B>few moths earlier in an accident. The car he was driving had flipped</B>
<P><B>during a rain storm and landed in a rushing creek. Michael drowned.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When he bought the house, James didn't think anything about Michael's</B>
<P><B>death. Infact he thought he was doing the widow a favor by taking the</B>
<P><B>house and letting her get away from some painful memories. 
Apparently</B>
<P><B>Michael didn't share James' opinion.</B>
<P>
<P><B>James moved out of the house that weekend and didn't return even once</B>
<P><B>until the day some friends and I helped him move his things out.</B>
<P><B>After about 90 minutes, our brother Scott finally showed up with the</B>
<P><B>moving van we had rented.</B>
<P><B>James was mildly irritated with Scott for being so late.  Scott</B>
<P><B>explained he had come with the truck about 30 minutes before James,</B>
<P><B>myself and the friends had arrived to start work. What Scott wanted
to</B>
<P><B>know is why James' friend with the beard didn't let him in when he
first</B>
<P><B>got there. " What friend? ",we asked. (none of us there that day had
a</B>
<P><B>beard.)  "Your smart alleck friend who was watching me from the attic</B>
<P><B>window when I first pulled up before you guys got here this morning.
He</B>
<P><B>had a beard and a ball-cap and just stood up there watching me while
I</B>
<P><B>waved my hands.  I finally rang the door bell but got no response.
 When</B>
<P><B>I returned to the truck , he was gone".</B>
<P>
<P><B>This story is true, and it happened as it is written.  My brother
would</B>
<P><B>be angry if he knew I was sending it to you, but it was my experience</B>
<P><B>too and I couldn't keep it in any longer.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Since this experience I have read many accounts of people who are</B>
<P><B>haunted by the previous owners of things they bought whether they 
be</B>
<P><B>homes, cars, clothing or other objects.</B>
<P><B>It's good to know I'm not alone but I hope it never happens to me
again.</B>
<P>
<P><B>So far as I know, James was the only occupant of the house to be</B>
<P><B>bothered by Michael.  Prehaps he was only truly angry at the first
new</B>
<P><B>owner of his home trying to change it and then left.  Maybe he left
the</B>
<P><B>house insearch of his new bride. Maybe he's still there waiting for</B>
<P><B>something to trigger his anger again.  I don't know and I don't care.</B>

<H3><A NAME=home>My Grandparent's Home</A>
</H3><P><B>by Mespot@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>     My grandparents lived in a house near Memorial High School on
the West</B>
<P><B>side of town. It was a happy place to visit because there was a strong
sense</B>
<P><B>of family there. When I was about 13 years old, my grandmother passed
away</B>
<P><B>from a heart attack/stroke while on vacation. About 6 months after,
my</B>
<P><B>grandfather passed on. Most of us in the family believe that it was
due to a</B>
<P><B>broken heart.</B>
<P><B>     Shortly after my grandfather's funeral, things started happening
in the</B>
<P><B>house. By this time, my aunt, uncle, and 3 cousins had moved into the
old</B>
<P><B>house. I'm very close to my cousins, so I would spend a lot of time
there. My</B>
<P><B>grandfather had been a mason for most of his life. We would always
remember</B>
<P><B>him in his heavy workboots and cowboy work hat. One of the first
strange</B>
<P><B>instances were the footsteps. The house has old style wood floors.
While I</B>
<P><B>would be spending the night with my cousins in the back room, all 4
of us</B>
<P><B>could hear the heavy footsteps up and down the hallway, as if someone
was</B>
<P><B>wearing heavy shoes. The steps would go from the bathroom to my
grandfather's</B>
<P><B>old room and back.</B>
<P><B>     I don't have to tell you that we were spooked. We told family
members,</B>
<P><B>but no one would believe us. My grandparents had an old black rotary
style</B>
<P><B>phone in the hallway. As you may know, if you lift one of those phones
and set</B>
<P><B>it down hard on the cradle, the bell will ring. At night, my cousins
and I</B>
<P><B>would hear the phone being picked up and set down. This happened well
over a</B>
<P><B>dozen times for several nights.</B>
<P><B>     Shortly after, we were talking in the back room and heard a rapping
on</B>
<P><B>the window. At first we thought it was some friends screwing around.
When we</B>
<P><B>opened the blinds to look out, there was the family dog staring back
at us</B>
<P><B>with a puzzled look listening to the rapping continue. We needed help.
We</B>
<P><B>spoke to one of our relatives who is very spiritual. She said that
if it is</B>
<P><B>the spirits of my grandmother and grandfather we had nothing to worry
about.</B>
<P><B>They loved us while they were alive and they are probably just watching
over.</B>
<P><B>But, if it was something else pretending to be them, ...</B>
<P><B>     There were only a few more instances, but they were enough to
make sure</B>
<P><B>that I didn't spend the night there again. One was that my older cousin,
who</B>
<P><B>was watching us for a while after my aunt and uncle had left town,
had</B>
<P><B>something open the locked bathroom door and enter the room when she
was taking</B>
<P><B>a shower. She thought that it was one of us, but we were out of the
house</B>
<P><B>playing at the time. Needless to say, she believes now. My last straw
was when</B>
<P><B>I spent the night in my grandfather's room. I was saying my prayers
to myself,</B>
<P><B>and when I got to my grandfather's blessing, the door to his room began
to</B>
<P><B>sway back and forth. At first it was slow. Then it violently sped up!
I took</B>
<P><B>off into my cousin's room, jumped in bed with him, and told him what
happened.</B>
<P><B>The only thing he said in his slumber was "Go to sleep, it happens
all the</B>
<P><B>time."</B>
<P><B>     That was it for me. I wouldn't stay there again. Eventually, the
house</B>
<P><B>was sold and my relatives moved out. But it's still standing and I'll
drive by</B>
<P><B>it sometimes to remember the good and the bad. If you want to write
me about</B>
<P><B>similar experiences, my e-mail address should be at the top of the
story.</B>
