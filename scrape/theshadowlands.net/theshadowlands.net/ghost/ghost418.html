OLLIE&#8217;S CANE<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp; Rich Peacock<br>
<br>
<br>
Do you believe in ghosts? Angels, maybe? Well, I never did. Until my buddy Ollie died about fifteen years ago. <br>
At the time, I was working in public relations at a medium-size airport
in the West. My friend Ollie was the airport police chief. Our other
best friend, Floyd, was the airport operations manager. Several times a
week for lunch, the three of us would get in one of the airport
vehicles and drive out to a spot&nbsp; near the main runway. We&#8217;d watch
planes land and take off while listening to country-western music on
the radio. We&#8217;d sit there and eat our brown-bag lunches, exchanging
good-natured ribbing and trading away lunch items we didn&#8217;t want. This
lunch-time routine at Chez Runway continued several times a week for
more than ten years. Ollie, Floyd, and I were inseparable, especially
between the hours of twelve and one (OK, maybe more like 11:45 to 1:15).<br>
One day in 1990, Ollie called me into his office and closed the door. <br>
&#8220;Richie,&#8221; he said, &#8220;The doctor told me today I&#8217;ve got cancer. I&#8217;m gonna
die&#8221;. Tears welled up in my eyes. We hugged and said we loved each
other. Then, as we regained our composures, we discussed Ollie&#8217;s
medical condition. It was pancreatic cancer, one of the most difficult
forms of cancer to treat. Ollie&#8217;s doctor gave him about six to eight
months to live. <br>
Ollie seemed determined to get the most out of his remaining months. He
kept his sense of humor. One day Ollie, Floyd and I were having coffee
in the airport coffee shop. Ollie had just gotten back from a routine
visit to his general practitioner, who apparently hadn&#8217;t heard from the
oncologist about Ollie&#8217;s cancer. Ollie related how the general
practitioner had said, &#8220;Well, Ollie, you&#8217;ve got a clean bill of
health!&#8221; Ollie found it hilarious that a doctor could find him in
perfect health while he was suffering from terminal cancer. <br>
And then there was the time over coffee when Ollie was putting
saccharin in his coffee (he was diabetic). While he poured the pink
packet&#8217;s contents into his coffee, he said that he had read recently
that new studies showed saccharin might cause cancer. Saying this in
grave tones, a grin suddenly flashed across his broad Irishman&#8217;s face,
and he blurted, &#8220;But, hey, who cares&#8212;I&#8217;ve already got cancer!&#8221; When he
laughed his whole body shook, just like the proverbial St. Nicholas.<br>
Summer came and Ollie was still coming to work, sometimes with the help
of a cane. I was his chauffeur and personal attendant, driving him
around to his errands and taking him to local points of interest.
Sometimes we talked and sometimes we were silent, just enjoying each
other&#8217;s company.<br>
Summer turned to fall and Ollie began putting his personal affairs in
order. He came to work less and less. Sometimes I&#8217;d visit him at his
house and fill him in on all the latest airport gossip. Ollie was
getting weaker and weaker. We tried to pretend Ollie wasn&#8217;t sick, but
the cane was an ever-present reminder of his illness.<br>
Sometime in mid-December, Ollie got a second wind and came to work for
a day to join Floyd and me for the traditional runway lunch. I drove,
as always, and I opened the back door for Ollie. He gingerly got into
the car, dragging his cane with him. Floyd sat in the passenger seat in
front. <br>
It was to be our last lunch with Ollie at the airport. It was just like
always with the three of us. Ollie horsed around as usual, yanking my
shoulder belt back around my neck in an attempt to strangle me. He knew
I startled easily and delighted in tapping the back of my head with his
cane. Occasionally, he&#8217;d doze off for a few minutes.<br>
After lunch, I drove Ollie home from work for the last time.<br>
Ollie started going downhill fast. On December 15, Ollie&#8217;s wife, Paula,
called me and suggested I come over to the house. When I got there,
Paula asked me to call the priest for the last rites. After doing that,
I went to Ollie&#8217;s bedside. &#8220;Well, Richie, this is it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Doctor
says I&#8217;ve got some bleeders down there. It won&#8217;t be long now.&#8221; We said
we loved each other, and I went outside to wait for the priest.<br>
The priest came and we all gathered around Ollie&#8217;s bed for the last rites. I kissed Ollie on the forehead and went home.<br>
The phone rang at about 5 in the morning. It was Paula, Ollie&#8217;s wife.
Ollie had passed away just moments ago. Paula told me that Ollie had
not wanted to die on the 15th, because it was Floyd&#8217;s birthday. So he
willed himself to live until the 16th.<br>
&nbsp;********<br>
On the day after the funeral, I met Floyd outside his office at lunch
hour. In a way, we dreaded going out by the runway to eat lunch, but
somehow we both knew we had to do it. Our hearts full of sorrow, we got
in Floyd&#8217;s car and drove out to the usual spot and parked.<br>
We ate our lunches in silence. We couldn&#8217;t seem to find much to say.
Suddenly, we heard two loud, distinct raps on the trunk lid of the car.
Floyd and I glanced quizically at each other. There it was again&#8212;rap,
RAP!<br>
Well, Floyd and I needed to see for ourselves what was going on. We
both got out of the car, and looked all around it and under it. We
didn&#8217;t see anything out of the ordinary. It couldn&#8217;t have been the wind
blowing something into the car, because there was no wind. There was
nothing in the trunk except for some road flares and a fire
extinguisher. <br>
We got back into the car. There it was again&#8212;RAP RAP RAP!!!<br>
Now, you have to understand that Floyd and I are technical people.
After all, we were working in operations at an airport, not in some New
Age candle shop. Floyd was ex-Air Force and trained to believe in
scientific causes and effects. But to this day, Floyd and I are
convinced that those raps on the trunk were Ollie&#8217;s cane&#8212;Ollie&#8217;s way of
telling us from the other side that he was still with us in spirit.
Knowing Ollie, he&#8217;d be grinning, too, knowing he&#8217;d scared the living
daylights out of us. <br>
Floyd and I went back to our desks with an odd mix of feelings&#8212;sad at
missing our dear friend, but buoyed by the new knowledge that
friendship lives on after death.<br>

The Woman in Green<br>
<br>
<br>
By: Cissydk@aol.com<br>
<br>
I have had 2 experiences with what I think were Ghosts.&nbsp; The first
happened when I was 20 years old.&nbsp; I had My first Nursing job, and
I was getting ready for work at 5:30 AM.&nbsp; I was in the bathroom
brushing My teeth, when I saw a Woman go by the bathroom door into the
Living Room.&nbsp; I thought it was My Mom, and I remembered that I had
to tell Her I needed Her car that day, so I walked out of the&nbsp;
bathroom and started to tell Her, but the Living room was empty.&nbsp;
My cat was sitting on a chair under the Living Room window, and She
suddenly stood up, was looking at a point behind Me into the Hall.. All
Her hair and her tail stood on-end, and She was making a really wierd
sound.&nbsp; I got scared, and&nbsp; sat in My Mom's Rocker and was
afraid to look behind Me into the hall.&nbsp; After a few minutes,
Nickie (the cat), turned around a couple of times, Her hair went down,
and She laid down and went to sleep.&nbsp; I then felt all was OK, and
I continued getting ready for Work.&nbsp; PS. I told My Mom and My
Sister what happened and they laughed at Me.. HOWEVER, I went out with
My friends that night, and when I got home, My Mom and Sister were
piled in the same bed!.. Do You think I saw a Ghost? I call Her "The
Woman in Green," because She was wearing what looked like a Green
nightgown... I have NO idea who She could have been...<br>

An Unsettling Visitor<br>
<br>
By: c59442@bellsouth.net <br>
<br>
I was traveling cross country with a group of activists.&nbsp; We were
all about eighteen.&nbsp; We stopped in St. Louis, MO to spend the
night in the gym of a high school, because we were having car trouble.
I was one of the last ones out of the shower, so when I went to spread
out my sleeping bag, I had trouble finding room on the floor.&nbsp; One
kid offered to share his space, so I did.&nbsp; It was uncomfortable,
being wedged in with so many people on the hard floor, and I couldn't
sleep.&nbsp; I was just about to doze off, when I spotted a little dark
haired girl across the room, propped on her side, her head resting on
her hand.&nbsp; I was surprised to see her, because there were no kids
traveling with us.&nbsp; I poked the guy next to me, and started to ask
him who the kid was. And then I realized that I could see through her,
and that she sort of glowed.&nbsp; She was sort of superimposed over
one of the people who was sleeping on the floor.&nbsp; The next to me
took one look, and then buried his head under his pillow.&nbsp; I
squeezed my eyes shut and tried not to look again.&nbsp; But of course
I did.&nbsp; And there she still was, a mischievous grin on her face,
as if our fear delighted her no end.&nbsp; Her form wavered slightly,
as if she were an image being projected from some ghostly movie
projector.&nbsp; I wonder who that little girl was, and if she met her
end in that school gymnasium.&nbsp; I coulnd't sleep a wink, after that.<br>

Deja Vu<br>
<br>
By: speedy9747@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
Deja Vu, as defined by Meriam-Webster, means 1 a: the illusion of
remembering scenes and events when experienced for the first time b: a
feeling that one has seen or heard something before2: something overly
or unpleasantly familiar.&nbsp; <br>
I have experienced this phenomena in spurts for most of my life but
have never experienced it quite the way I did the weekend of the Cinco
De Mayo this year.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Thursday prior to May 5th, I had
a strange dream about a lovely old farm house out in the country.&nbsp;
It was very realistic and filled with vivid details.&nbsp; It was a
farm that I had never seen before and one that elicited a feeling of
belonging and home.&nbsp; <br>
On the Saturday of Cinco De Mayo I found myself in the mountains of
Tennessee lost&nbsp; A local gas station owner had given me directions,
but somehow, I missed a turn and found myself alone in a very rural
area.&nbsp; As I searched for a safe place to turn around, I had that
swimming-in-the head feeling that usually accompanies my Deja Vu.&nbsp;
As I pulled in to a small field, across the clearing I saw the very
same farm that I had dreamt of two nights prior.&nbsp; My jaw dropped
when I remembered how accurate and detailed my dream was.&nbsp; <br>
I sat in stunned silence for a moment; staring at this house and
actually enjoying the peaceful vibe that had engulfed me.&nbsp; I heard
a slight tapping on the car window and almost jumped out of my skin
when I realized that an elderly man was standing there.&nbsp; He knew
immediately that I was lost and provided me clear directions. Before I
left, he made a comment about how I reminded him of his sister who had
passed away more than 15 years ago due to cancer and how he had
inherited the farm from her.&nbsp; I am still not sure what to make of
this incident but it was a very interesting feeling.&nbsp; Thanks!<br>

Haunted Land<br>
<br>
<br>
By: GreenAjah21@aol.com<br>
<br>
Let me start by saying I never believed in ghosts and even now&nbsp; I
still have a hard time with the idea. Although I do admit that now I am
not as fond of where I live as I once was three months ago and do not
like to be home alone. I should start by saying I live in Dalzell S.C.
which is a tiny suburb of Sumter S.C. My husband and I live on a large
piece of land that his parents own and have lived on for years. My
husband has lived on this land all of his 33 years and instead of
leaving he was so attached he built a house here and I have lived here
only a few months. This first started over a year ago now when we were
first dating. I was at his house alone sitting on the couch, when a
white cat shot past my vision down the hallway. I am positive it was a
cat not only then but now because I saw it more than once. I was so
excited to see he had a cat I jumped up and went to find it. Well, I
didn't and when he came home and I asked him about it he said he didn't
have a cat. Well, I saw that white streak of fur about four more times
right after we started dating, I was freaked but I never saw it again
so I kinda forgot about it until recently. I just put it up to my
imagination. Well, it wasn't until right before we got married that the
subject of the white cat came up again but how it came up is what
really freaked me the most. <br>
Our house is just a short walk from my husbands parents and we eat
lunch on Sundays and spend a great deal of time at his parents house.
Well after lunch one Sunday my father-in-law told us he had to tell us
his latest, "haunting story". Well, I was shocked to hear that he was
watching T.V. and was facing the hallway when the bathroom light came
on. Well, no one else was in the house except my mother-in-law and she
was in the bed asleep. Not only did the light come on but someone
walked into the bathroom and closed the door! Being the commando he is
he jumped up and ran to the bathroom opened to the door and the light
was on and no one was there. Well, everyone at the dinner table got
completely serious after the story but they also looked a little guilty
when they saw the horror on my face. I was then informed that this
isn't the first time stuff like this has happened.<br>
It started with my husbands parents first night in the house. They went
to bed and when they were both almost to the point of sleeping a person
screamed right underneath their bedroom window. They said it was the
scream of a woman who was not just letting out a yell but screaming
like she was getting beat or attacked. No words were spoken just
screaming. So, my father-in-law jumped out of bed and went to run out
the door but was stopped by my mother-in-law and just a few seconds
later it quit. Well, he wasn't brave enough to go searching that night
but they didn't get any sleep at all that night. <br>
Nothing else happened until my husband was a child and then there were
three things he and his brother say happened. The first is that my
brother-in-law when he was a teenager was sitting up late at night in
the kitchen eating when a man who looked Latino in origin walked down
the hallway. He was wearing a large hat and one of those things that
wrap around your shoulder that you use to hold bullets. The man
stopped, looked at Jimmy, nodded his head as if to say HI then turned
and walked into the refrigerator. The next thing that happened was to
my husband. He was playing cards with his sister when she got up to
take a shower. He started reading a comic book when someone entered the
room. Thinking his sister had finished her shower he looked up and it
was a little boy older than him with blond hair.&nbsp; He said he just
stared when the boy just disappeared in thin air. Ummm, of course he
ran into his parents room and had to be talked into sleeping in his own
bed for about a week later. The third thing that happened was when my
husband was older and a friend was over to spend the night. They were
almost asleep when a large bang was heard in the kitchen and everyone
came running in the house not just my husband and his friend. They got
to the kitchen and every drawer and cabinet was opened not just open
but all drawers were open the same amount of length and every door was
opened the same degree. <br>
So now to what happened to me recently, well we have a cat now. So I
haven't seen any ghost cats but about three days ago, I was sitting on
the couch with the cat in my lap. She was asleep but for some reason
looked over my head and her eyes opened wide. Well this shouldn't have
suprised me except that the lights were out in the living room and were
on in the hallway behind me. So I looked into her eyes which are huge
and I saw movement above my head in her eyes. I jumped up because I was
the only one home and ran as hard as I could for the door, but looked
behind me on the way out and nothing was there. Maybe it was
overreaction. That is what I keep saying and my husband says. I still
do not like being home alone now because I swear what I saw in her eyes
was the figure of a man leaning over to pick something up off the floor
in our hallway and straighten back up again. <br>
So I do not think our house is haunted but I will bet our land is by something.<br>

I delivered Newspapers with my Dad at an old army barracks, in Sackets
Harbor ,NY. The old barrack's are called Madison Barracks. They are all
apartments now. Well I delivered to this one buliding. Everytime I went
in, I got the feeling someone was watching me. This all happened about
2:30-3:00 in the morning.&nbsp; It was never a bad feeling. One morning
I didn't take my flashlight with me, as I was heading up the stair's, I
looked over my shoulder and saw what looked like a flashlight beam.
There were no light's on in the building. The next morning I saw the
figure of a man, dressed in Army cloths. I know more than once I felt
someone touch my hand as I went up the stair's. This solider I believe
kept from falling down the stair's one morning. As I started to fall,I
felt someone grab me, and it was just me in the building. Now I beileve
it was my ghost solider.<br>

Strange Mist<br>

<br>
I work in the telecommunications business and spend a lot of time in
houses that have been remodeled into doctor&#8217;s and law offices. I supply
our customers with phone systems and computer networking equipment. In
most of these houses everything has to be put in the basement b/c the
houses were built before data networks and phone systems were around
and that is the best centralized location for them. Anyway, I was had a
work order to remove a system from a real estate agency in a nearby
town b/c they were going to base their operations out of their home
branch.. This seemed odd to me b/c this was a reputable and successful
agency. This town was also experiencing a lot of growth. I met on of
the agents there late one afternoon and she let me in. It was strange
that they had moved and not taken any of the furniture. I went to the
basement and removed the equipment from the wall. I then went back
upstairs to round up the phones. The agent that let me in was still
there and asked me how much longer I was going to be. I thought she was
just pushy and had somewhere to be. I told her I had about 10 minutes
left. After I rounded up all the equipment and boxed it up, I went back
to the basement check if I had turned off the light. As I stuck my head
in the basement door, the light was off but there was enough natural
light in the basement to make things out. I then saw at the base of the
stairs, what I can only describe a solid cloud of smoke or mist float
from on side of the basement to the other. It was floating about 3 feet
from the ground in a straight line but was not moving at a very fast
pace. I do not typically believe these type things, but I do believe my
own 2 eyes. This did not scare me as much I thought it was cool to see.
As I was leaving, I told the agent that I was leaving and she told me
to wait and that she was coming with me. Come to find out when I got
back to the office, my head tech knew that it was haunted and that&#8217;s
why they moved. The agents had seen objects moving around their office
since the moved in 2 years ago.<br>

Ghost Story at my House<br>
<br>
By: chaney64@msn.com<br>
<br>
at my home, from 3 am to 4 am, when you look out into the back yard,
you can see our animals buried back there and the animal killed in the
back yard behind ours roaming around in our back yard. I'm sure they
come out anytime but this seems to be the best time to clearly see
them. one night when my cousins and myself were having a sleep over we
stayed up all night. its hard but can be done. any way we were in my
room when we heard something outside so we looked out the window and
saw white figures about the sizes of dogs and cats. they are in the
trees and walking around in the back yard but when one of us screamed
they disappeared. I say that the neighbors animals must roam too
because there were Mexicans who lived back there and would buy lots of
farm animals like goats, chickens, and pigs and would kill them.&nbsp;
they would sometimes eat them and cook them in a large fire in the
middle of the back yard. they would also bury them. they were forced to
move when someone called the cops on them. one week after they were
gone my grandmother and I walked out to the very back shed which is
next to the back yard of the neighbors and she went in the shed and I
swear I saw a goat walking in the corner of their yard and It sounded
like a goat too. I screamed and it disappeared. after 10:00pm I will
not go into the back yard. I won't even sleep with my window facing the
backyard open when its hot.<br>

Haunted house in McKenzie, TN<br>
<br>
<br>
By: Christy@deltafaucet.com <br>
<br>
There is a house in McKenzie, TN that I know for a fact is haunted. My
best friend and her family rented the house about twelve years ago and
lived in the home for a short while until they had their own home built
and moved into it. The house is located on Cherry Street just down from
Bethel College in McKenzie. The house was built over a hundred years
ago by a man who was affiliated with Bethel College. He had moved to
the area because of the college and built the house for his family. The
man and his wife had a daughter (don't know how many other children
they had) who grew up in the house and went on to marry and raise her
own family in the same home. The woman lived there until she was
elderly and her health was failing. She eventually died in a hospital
or nursing home and the house was turned over to Bethel College and
then sat empty for a short while. When my friend and her family moved
into the house, they were the first ones other than the family who had
built it, to ever live in the home. My friend immediately did not like
the house; it was a two story brick five bedroom home that had very old
dark rooms. When she would find herself alone in a room she always felt
like someone was watching her or that someone else was in the room. The
family dog acted strange in the house too; it would act as if someone
was in the room and as if it was watching something or someone walking
around the room even though no one was there. The dog would also growl
during these times it would "see" something. After living in the house
for a little while more unsettling things started to occur. My friend's
elderly grandfather came to live with them and stayed in a bedroom on
the first floor since he was unable to use the stairs. Soon after he
moved in he began telling the family that while they were away at
work/school that an old woman was in the house. Her father would search
the home and find no one. Her grandfather would tell them that he had
saw the old woman come in the front door, she would not say anything to
him and would go up the stairs and go into the bedroom on the left at
the top of the stairs, which coincidentally was the elderly woman's
bedroom when she was alive and living in the home. My friend and her
family didn't think much of the grandfather's story until more
sightings and unexplained things happened. They would her loud bangs
and such in the house, thinking there might be an intruder her father
would always check all the rooms and not find anything or anyone. One
evening though when they were all down stairs and heard one of these
loud bangs, and her father went to investigate he found a baseball bat
laying in the floor in the same bedroom upstairs as the old woman was
seen entering. The bat had been pulled out of a basket that had several
other bats crammed into it and the bat appeared to have been thrown
across to the opposite side of the room and was lying in the floor. No
one was upstairs when this happened and it could not be explained!
Another incident happened in the middle of the night. My friend's older
brother (the old woman's bedroom was his bedroom!) had left to go stay
the night at his girlfriend's so he wasn't going to be back until the
next day. My friend was asleep in her room with the door open as it
always was when she all of a sudden woke up. She turned and looked and
there in her bedroom doorway she could see a man standing there looking
at her. She thought it was her brother so she started calling his name
in a whisper as not to wake her parents. She called his name a couple
of times but he would not answer her. The man turned from her doorway
and started down the hall. Just then my friend remembered that her
brother was not there and immediately began to scream for her mom and
dad. After telling them what happened her father searched the house.
All doors and windows were locked, nothing had been disturbed and there
was no one in their home!! The last major incident that took place
before they moved out happed to my friend's mother. She was home alone
in the living room one day watching TV when she heard the back door to
the house come open and shut. She then heard foot steps walking through
the kitchen, into the dining room, then turning and walking down the
hall toward the front of the house. The foot steps stopped at the
basement door in the hall and she heard the door open, the light switch
click on and she then heard the foot steps bound down the stairs as if
the person was skipping every other step on he way down. She thought it
was her oldest son but didn't remember hearing his loud car pull in to
the drive. Wondering why he was in the basement she got up and went to
go see what he was looking for. When she got to the basement door it
was open and the light was on but there wasn't any one down there
(there was no other way in or out of the basement other than the door
in the hall). She turned the light off and shut the door and went back
to the living room and sat back down. Not long after she sat down the
whole thing happened all over again. She heard the same foot steps,
following the same path through the house, again the door to the
basement opened and the light clicked on and she heard the same
footsteps bounding down the stair. She got back up and went to the
basement doorway to find yet again the door was standing open and the
light was on but no one was down there. This time she went outside and
sat on the porch until someone finally come home. She did not tell the
rest of their family what had happened to her until they moved out
because she knew that they would have refused to stay in the house. <br>
After they moved out and into their newly built home, I spent the night
and had my own experience in the new house the next morning. My friend,
one of her brother's and I were watching TV in their new living room
and I heard a swoosh noise and at the same time saw out of the corner
of my eye a black figure of a person moving very fast out of my friends
bedroom around a corner into the bathroom. Her brother didn't see the
figure but he heard the swoosh sound. My friend had her back to her
room so she didn't see the dark figure nor did she hear the sound we
heard. It freaked me out and for a while my friend was worried that the
ghosts had followed them to their new home but fortunately there were
no other incidents (that I know of).<br>

My Dad<br>

I've always been interested in ghosts and have lived in several houses
where there have been more than a few strange occurences, but this one
definitely stands out.&nbsp; My dad died in January of 2001 very
unexpectedly and at the age of only 45.&nbsp; It was very hard on my
family and me, but we're doing ok.&nbsp; Anyways, it last year in April
of 2006 and the day before I was going into surgery (nothing serious,
but I'd never had surgery before and I was scared.)&nbsp; The morning
before surgery I was praying that everything would turn out alright,
and I (in my head) asked my dad to give me some sort of audible sign
that he was watching over me and that everything would be
alright.&nbsp; No one else knew about my request.&nbsp; That night at
around 11 pm I heard a loud pounding noise, as if someone was pounding
with their fists on our big glass bay window at the front of the
house.&nbsp; The dogs started barking and I assumed that it was my mom
locked out of the house, so I laughed and told my sister to let my mom
in.&nbsp; I walked to the top of the stairs which led down to the foyer
as did my sister, who wanted to know where the noise was coming
from.&nbsp; Just then my mom walked into the foyer from the kitchen and
asked what that pounding noise was and thought it was me or my sister
trying to scare each other.&nbsp; Once we figured out it was none of us
pounding we looked out the windows but no one was around or
outside.&nbsp; My neighborhood is very quiet; all of the kids are under
10 and it was pretty late on a (cold) Sunday night, so I highly doubt
it was some kid trying to play a prank.&nbsp; I'd like to think it was
my dad giving me a sign that things were going to be ok, which they
were in the end.&nbsp; <br>

My Grandpa and Jake<br>

Hi, my name is Carie and I have three stories to tell. The first one is
about my grampa. I am 25 years old now, but I remember it like it was
yesterday. Many years ago my grandpa died, and he had this huge
funeral. He had so many friends and family, and I remember waiting in
line to say goodbye to him at the funeral home. When I finally got
there, I saw his face and this feeling of sadness so bad I had to run
away. I still dont know what it was that made me go, but I never
properly got the chance to say goodbye. That night I had a dream that I
was flying over this lake that we all loved to go to,&nbsp; it was
fall, the leaves were changing color, and it was cold but it was
beautiful, and I looked to see whos hand I was holding, and it was my
grandpa. I felt so safe and he told me how much he loved me. I woke up
and felt much better. The next day, my family and I went to breakfast,
and my brother and I sat in one booth and my mom and dad were in
another. I went over to mom and dad to tell them grandpa came to visit
me and about the dream, and I dad put his head down and tried to fight
back the tears. He looked up at me dead serious and said he had the
exact same dream. I believe to this day it was my granpy saying he was
ok. <br>
It was a few years later, I moved to a different town with my then
boyfriend, and I was walking home from work one night, it was around
Halloween. It was very dark and I had this bad feeling like someone was
watching me, so I turned around and I saw this man following me about
10 feet behind me. Then all of a sudden I smelled this strong smell of
tabacco smoke from a pipe. Not even a minute after that a lady I worked
with pulled into the driveway in front of me and asked me if I needed a
ride. I quickly jumped into the car and looked for the man, and saw him
jump behind this huge tree to hide. The only person I ever knew that
smoked a pipe was my grandpa. I know he was watching over me,
protecting me. There was no houses or any reason for the smoke to be
right infront of me, exept my grampa. I could just feel him. I knew he
was there. A few weeks later, there was a guy that got arrested for
stalking and raping girls on the exact same street.<br>
The next story I have is about my favorite dog Jake. He was my best
friend when I was growing up, and I loved him so much. My brother and I
used to go and ride our bikes up and down the road alot, and one day,
we were doing just that when we heard my mom scream. Jake got hit by a
car right down the street. We rushed him to the vet. I sat in the back,
he was in my arms, bleeding all over and shaking, it was horrible. I
just kept telling him how much I loved him and we were gonna save him.
He died in my arms. It was so scary, I was only about 12 or 13. So,
time went on, and my brother and I were riding our bikes on the same
street, and we rode past the spot Jake got hit and in the ditch right
next to spot was a hundred dollar bill. As we stood there in disbelief,
not knowing whether to pick it up or not, we heard very faint barking,
and there was no other dogs around.&nbsp; My brother and I split it and
to this day we believe it was a gift from Jake. I have many more
stories, but I will write them another time. All the stories are true.
They have definetly made me a believer.&nbsp; <br>

Ollie Hancock(Ghost of my House)<br>

(This isn't particularly about me, it's more about my parents.) I was
only two years old when my mom, dad, and I moved out of the trailer
park we lived in into a two-story house. It was one of our first weeks
in the house when my parents noticed some weird stuff going on in the
house. One night, while I was asleep upstairs, my parents were sitting
on the couch in the living room watching television. All was OK for a
while until around 2 in the morning when they heard a big crash and the
french doors all of a sudden drew open (the french doors are double
glass doors leading from the living room to the soon-to-be toyroom for
me). Then the doors automatically shut. They of course got up to see
who had broken in or what happened to cause the crash. They ran into
the toy room to see only nothing- nothing on the floor from where
something had fallen to make the crash, no person, nothing. As scared
as they were we all still live in the house today along with my sister
Staci, who had not been born when this had happened. Occasionally, we
hear noises and things are misplaced but that's about it. We had also
found out that the person who had lived in our house before us had died
in her bedroom of the house. Her bedroom was our toy room.<br>

<br>
The story is when i was little i'd always put my hands up to the roof
as if it was like i was being huged.and mum told me that i'd always
talk to joan. (joan is my grandma and dad told me she died before i was
born) funny thing is that i remeber all of this i remeber once i said
"i miss you" but mum said that i'd always be happy after i spoke to her.<br>
now i'm not saying that this is a ghost but i think that it was my grandma's spirit contacting me.<br>
ever since then i've been so interested in spirit's.<br>

Things that have Happened to me<br>
<br>
By: RDJarrett@coosahs.net<br>
<br>
I have a few stories of the things that have happened to me all my life and would like to share them with everyone.<br>
For as long as I can remember back I have had these dreams of a old
women rocking a baby and saying to this child " It's alright Zora" now
this in it's self is wierd because this is my sisters name and I had
never meet this women. My grandmother was also named Zora and she died
way before I was born so I never got the chance to meet her either.
When I was around 6 I had this dream all the time and would always wake
my sister up just to make sure she was there thinking this lady had
taken her. But on one night when I was waling my sister up this women
was right beside my bed rocking and saying the same thing as in my
dream. I had to shut my eyes just to make sure this was only another
dream. When I looked the lady was still there and I was sooo scared
before I got the chance to wake up my sister she was sitting up in bed
and asking me why this women was in our room and wanted to know who she
was. I was amazed that my sister was seeing the same things that I was
seeing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm the youngest of 4 and was always told that I
was having nightmares and with my sister seeing the same thing I felt
so much better. After about 5 minutes the lady disappeared and I
couldn't sleep in the room anymore. We lived with our aunt and all 5 of
us shared a room so that was impossible. About 3 days after that happen
my family got out photo albums and were looking through them when I was
looking at the lady from my bedroom. I just started crying and telling
my mom about what had happened only night before. I asked her who it
was and she told me that it was my great-grandmother and that the baby
she was holding was my dad.&nbsp; WIERD becasue after that day I never
had that happen to me again.<br>
Second story: When we moved out of my aunts house we moved into a
apartment not to far away. It was Halloween and one of my brothers were
grounded and couldn't go trick-or-treating so we decided to watch the
Friday the 13th Series ont he Sci-Fi channel. We got into watching the
show when we heard someone in our kitchen and got freaked out becasue
no one else was home with us. So together we went to investigate, as we
were heading toward the kitchen we heard the noise again it was like
someone was in there cutting something so we turned all the lights on
and no one was there. We turned to go back in the Frontroom to watch
our show when we see something fly across the Dining room. As we were
turning around there was a man who started to run after us with a
knife. I think my brother screamed louder than I did. The knife went
flying toward my brothers head and barely missed and hit the wall. We
ran outside and across the street to wait for our parents to get home.
When we turned around and looked at the doorway to our apartment there
was the figure of a man standing there. Later on we founds out the
apartment we lived in had used to be bigger and had a basement
apartment that was condemed because a guy was killed there. <br>
Thank you all for reading this a I appriciate being able to share this with soemone.<br>

Who Scared My Dog<br>
<br>
By:currell@rocketmail.com?<br>
<br>
I've always had an interest in the paranormal but maintain that I could
be standing right on top of a ghost and never notice. I'm about as
sensitive as a brick with these things, but there have been some
unusual incidents that might be paranormal - or they might not. It's
always wise to keep an open mind with a dose of skepticism.<br>
I used to live in Indonesia and had a dog. We bought him to guard our
property but his temparement was more suited to a spoiled companion
animal, since he was more playful than fierce. One night, for no
apparent reason, he howled. I had never heard our dog howl, not before
nor since, but that night he howled his heart out. At the time I
assumed he must be hearing another dog howling somewhere, inaudible to
my human ears and <br>
thought little of it. It might not even be linked to the following event.<br>
My husband and I worked full time and the dog was home alone for most
of the day. One evening, I came home and could not find the dog (who
would normally be doing full-body-wags at the gate to greet me) I
searched the front garden and the entire house and finally found him
behind the bathroom door, trembling.<br>
It was two hours before my husband came home and the dog was still
trembling. I thought he might be ill but aside from the trembling he
also behaved very strangely. He categorically refused to go into the
front garden and would not even enter the hallway leading to it. When
my husband came home there was no enthusiastic running to the gate, he
refused to go near event the front door.&nbsp; If I carried him into
the front garden, he'd stay there but stick by me so closely as to have
me falling over him. If one of us (I or my husband) went into the
house, the dog would rush into the house, too. Basically he would only
be in the garden or hallway if BOTH of us were there with him, but
given the choice, he'd rather hide inside the house.<br>
I had no idea what the matter was and figured that something had scared
him outside. Kids can be cruel so I wondered if children had thrown
stones at him through the fence (he had a habit of barking at
children). I put this to one side and over the next day he seemed to
have gotsome of his old courage back.<br>
Three days later the street was alive with cars and people dressed up,
carrying food, visiting a neighbour opposite. My husband (nosey)
dropped by to ask what the event was - turns out our neighbour's son
had died suddenly and in Indonesia people come to visit the grieving
family a specific number of days after the event (3, 7, 40)&nbsp; and
this was the third day. I realised then that the son had died the same
day my dog had his little 'episode'. Could he have seen the deceased
returning home? The bathroom door (behind which the dog had been
trembling) is the furthest point from this neighbour's house and the
dog used to while away his hours in the front garden (barking at kids)
and get in and out via a dogflap and was never found inside the house
when I got home. (more interesting things in the garden). I'll never
know but we've not seen him behave like that since.<br>
I converted to Islam while in Indonesia and this requires daily
prayers. Now, for these prayers NOTHING interrupts you. If you are
called or your baby is crying or someone knocks at the door, you finish
your prayers and then go see what the matter is. The prayer is the
priority and nothing interrupts you (except emergencies like the house
is on fire, obviously).<br>
Well I noticed that at my mother's house, whenever I started to pray I
would feel heat on my back, like someone had a heatlamp on right behind
me. It was quite bizarre, particularly for someone who always feels
cold. It would start the moment I opened my mouth to begin and would
last the entire prayer. When I'd stopped, it stopped.&nbsp; I had never
felt this in my home in Indonesia, only in this house. Again I didn't
think a great deal of it (could be imagination, right?) and it was
rather pleasant (although sometimes did feel a little TOO hot). I even
joked that if I started to feel the cold (The UK is not exactly
tropical) I could just start my prayers and warm up.&nbsp; I was
certainly never threatened by it. Well one evening, I was home alone
and as I began to pray,&nbsp; I didn;t have the heat but I had an
overhwelming feeling that someone was behind me, watching me. RIGHT
behind me. I turned and saw no one but couldn't shake that feeling. I
had begun my prayers and couldn't inerrupt but this feeling of someone
behind me was too strong and was too distracting and started to
frighten me that I moved my prayer mat so I could stand right in front
of a wall so NO one could be standing behind me.&nbsp; Some say that
when a Muslim prays, there are two angels behind you. In fact, when you
finish you greet them by saying&nbsp; "peace be upon you" over each
shoulder. I had put this down to some superstition but now wasn't so
sure,&nbsp; but that doesn't explain why I only felt this at my
mother's house.<br>
On my last day at this house, I was getting my things together, ready
to go to the airport. I had everything except my watch. We hunted high
and low for it. I checked my room and even lifted the mattress off the
bed to see if it was underneath or had slipped between bed and wall. No
sign of this watch anywhere, so I decided to leave without it. I made a
visit to the bathroom and then went back to the room for one last check
before flying 7000 miles and there, on the edge of the bed, the one
whose mattress I had lifted up,&nbsp; was my watch - how could it have
got there if I'd lifted the mattress only 5 minutes earlier?<br>
So nothing spectacular, no sightings and no conclusive proof but odd
nonetheless. I do believe I may never see a ghost since I don't think
I'm capable of it. I'm envious of those who have seen the benign sort,
although evil ones can just get lost - want nothing to do with&nbsp;
evil.<br>

The Imp<br>
<br>
By: aeseeke@yahoo.com <br>
This event happened to me many years ago. I can't remember much as most
of my childhood memories are clouded in fog but I was younger than 11.
Anyways, I was either asleep or just about to be asleep when all of a
sudden I became alert. I knew I wasn't alone. I looked up and I could
vagely see something that looked like a small person in my room. He was
looking at me and smiling. I was a bit of a whimp back then (and when
it comes to paranormal, sometimes I still am) and I was scared out of
my mind. He was talking to me, I can't remeber what but it&nbsp; was
gloating I think. He was just having some fun either at my expense or
he was just wierd. lol. So anyways I finally got up the nerve and
yelled for my mother who eventually came in and turned on the light.
The second the lights were on I couldn't see him any more. I still knew
he was there. My mother said I was dreaming or some such nonesense and
she left turning the light off. And once again in darkness this guy was
visible again. He laughed how he could only be seen in darkness.
Eventually he left. <br>
Maybe a year later he came back for a short visit, and I noticed that
in semi light he was transluscent. He pretty much acted the same as
before, a chatty fellow and left shortly.<br>
I have always wondered about this guy, I've read about Brownies and
stuff and he kind of resembles one but I doubt he was one. If any one's
had a similar experience or knows what the heck happened please get
back to me.<br>

Riverside Inn in Cambridge Springs, PA<br>
<br>
By: annrozsi@cablespeed.com Riverside Inn in Cambridge Springs, PA<br>
<br>
My family and I spent every Thanksgiving, for about 10 years, at the
Riverside Inn, in Cambridge Springs, PA.&nbsp; During the last year I
visited there (2001), only my daughter and I went to meet family from
Connecticut at the Inn; my son and husband remained behind at
home.&nbsp; During our visit my aunt and I asked the owner about
ghosts.&nbsp; She related that they once had a wedding party book a
suite on the third floor.&nbsp; Within a half hour or so of checking
in, the mother of the bride came to the front desk and informed them
that she wanted another suite.&nbsp; She stated that whatever was in
that room was "unhappy" with them being there.&nbsp; They had a psychic
visit after and she indicated a particular area of the Inn was haunted.<br>
When we returned home I immediately told my husband and son that they
weren't going to believe it, but the Inn was haunted.&nbsp; My son
interrupted me to tell me that he knew exactly which area was
haunted..........and then pinpointed the exact same area that the owner
had identified!!!<br>
Flabbergasted, I asked my son how he knew that was the correct
spot.&nbsp; He replied that when he and his sister would explore the
Inn, they always got the "willies" whenever they approached that area,
so they avoided that suite.&nbsp; He said those particular rooms never
felt quite right, and he just got a very uncomfortable feeling as he
approached them!!!<br>

The Sandra Wooding-Limon Story: A Story of a Haunting in Bakersfield.<br>
<br>
By: JazmaPika@cs.com<br>
<br>
The Sandra Wooding-Limon Story: A Story of a Haunting in Bakersfield. <br>
As told to Paul Dale Roberts <br>
As I sit here pondering is there life after death.&nbsp; I can only
assume, there must be an afterlife.&nbsp; Einstein came up with the
sound theory that E = MC2.&nbsp; Energy can be converted into matter
and matter can be converted into energy.&nbsp; Energy is a substance
that cannot be destroyed.&nbsp; All information from energy is
sustained for eternity.&nbsp; On one website, called "Ask a Rocket
Scientist", I asked if Earth were to be sucked up into a blackhole,
would that mean that all information on the existence of mankind would
be destroyed?&nbsp; The history of Earth would be gone?&nbsp; The
answer from the rocket scientist was 'no'.&nbsp; Due to the fact that
energy cannot be destroyed, it can be altered, but not destroyed.&nbsp;
So all of the tidbits of a scathing email that you wanted to send to
your boss, you deleted it from your computer, but it still exists in
the vastness of cyberspace.&nbsp; On the quantum level we are all
energy creatures.&nbsp; Break us down to atoms and on the quantum level
I would be able to place my hand right through your body and out
again.&nbsp; Henceforth, in Star Trek we see the scattering of our
atoms through a teleporter and reappear again intact with Capt. Kirk
ready for battle.&nbsp; So, if our matter bodies have intelligence,
then why can't a pure energy being have intelligence?&nbsp; Why
couldn't the aura that surrounds our body consume the intelligence that
our physical corporal body has?&nbsp; When we die, the aura leaves our
body.&nbsp; The aura is our soul.&nbsp; A soul that may decide to
follow the light into the next realm.&nbsp; An energy realm, we may
call it heaven, we may call it hell.&nbsp; Or a soul that refuses to go
into the light and remains on Earth, with unfinished business to attend
to.&nbsp; We call this a haunting. <br>
As a writer, I am a conduit for people to tell their stories.&nbsp; I
listen, I make the decision that a story will become immortalized
through my writings.&nbsp; On a particular night at Cache Creek Casino,
at Club 88, a woman by the name of Sandra Wooding-Limon asked for me to
write a story of a haunting that happened to her.&nbsp; A haunting that
she can't get out of her mind.&nbsp; As we talked during the music that
the band Masterpiece was playing, songs like "Body Talk by The Deele",
"Chase Me by Confunkshun" and "Good Times by Chic."&nbsp; She was
familiar with my paranormal investigations via H.P.I. (Haunted and
Paranormal Investigations) of Northern California.&nbsp; This is the
story she relates to me: <br>
At the age of 7, she lived in a home in Bakersfield, California, off a
street called Bel Torres.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her home was situated across the
street from the neighborhood park.&nbsp; The home was not elaborate
like the Amityville Horror home, it was a simple 3 bedroom house.&nbsp;
There she lived with her brothers and sisters, her mother and
stepfather.&nbsp; When she first moved into this home, she was
automatically scared of this house.&nbsp; When she moved in, she felt
this eerie feeling.&nbsp; Night after night, she felt a presence as she
tried to sleep in her bed.&nbsp; She felt someone was standing over her
bedside.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the hauntings continued, her bed covers would
be thrown off of her.&nbsp; This was too much for a little Sandra, she
insisted to have a night light on.&nbsp; She had a harder time falling
asleep.&nbsp; She would be afraid to sleep.&nbsp; She would see shadows
walking near the hallway and across her bedroom.&nbsp; The entity or
entities seemed focus on her.&nbsp; While she felt the hauntings, her
sister, age 6 was not disturbed and would sleep soundly, while all the
while she was being terrified by this unseen force.&nbsp; When the TV
was on, the walking shadows seemed to make their presence known even
more.&nbsp; The doors would move on their own accord and the cabinets
would open and close on their own.&nbsp; One night, she turned around
and the rocking chair kept rocking on its own.&nbsp; This was too much
for Sandra.&nbsp; Her family knew that Sandra was going through these
traumatic disturbances and after one year, the family decided to move
away.&nbsp; Sandra was absolutely terrified and it didn't help when she
also heard on the news that the Zodiac was at large.&nbsp; At this
young tender age, she was terrified of a hooded serial killer that was
stalking his prey, that prey was 'people' and the ghosts that were in
this Bakersfield home.&nbsp; Sandra is now an adult woman, but thoughts
and memories of this home still haunt her to this very day.&nbsp; She
will never forget a particular storm that came into Bakersfield and
during that night the hauntings came on very strong, her bed covers
were taken off of her, the shadows on the walls were everywhere and the
cabinets kept slamming open and shut during the storm.&nbsp; Not too
long after the storm is when her family decided enough was
enough.&nbsp; It was time to move.&nbsp; After having this experience
and moving away from the house in Bakersfield, she was terrified to go
to her grandfather's house.&nbsp; She didn't know if the house was
haunted, but it seemed to be haunted.&nbsp; Her grandmother died in the
house and her grandfather would have a shrine that included lit candles
and many patron Catholic saints near and around the lit candles.&nbsp;
This in itself was spooky.&nbsp; She related to me that her grandfather
always kept the house dark, she would hear things move around in the
house, when there was no one there.&nbsp; Her aunt lived in her
grandfather's house.&nbsp; Her aunt was strange, she was into the
gothic lifestyle and had black lights, psychedelic paraphernalia in her
dark bedroom.&nbsp; Sandra now strives to seek out the positive, she
likes a lot of lights, she avoids the darkness.&nbsp; This childhood
experience has effected her life to this very day. <br>
Sandra due to the nightmares of her childhood experiences once
consulted with a now defunct paranormal group called S.P.I.T. (Stockton
Paranormal Investigation Team), but didn't feel satisfied with their
counseling.&nbsp; She feels if her story is told, it may eliminate the
inner demons of her traumatic childhood experience.&nbsp; Good luck
Sandra, your story is now told. <br>
As I close this story, I only wonder if spirits may use the writings of
others as their conduit to tell their story.&nbsp; Once in Rolling
Stone Magazine, there was an article on the fact that Jim Morrison of
the Doors had appeared to many people after his death.&nbsp; Well, this
story wouldn't have phased me, except for the fact that my first wife
Karen Jean Walker/Caruso had related to me that she sat on a couch with
Jim Morrison.&nbsp; Jim told her to accept life and embrace it. Of
course this was the spirit of Jim Morrison, because Jim Morrison had
died years ago.&nbsp; When Karen told me this story I laughed.&nbsp;
When I read the Rolling Stone article, I almost fell out of my
chair.&nbsp; Could Karen be telling the truth?&nbsp; In 1999, I had a
dream that I saw my mother, who died in 1987.&nbsp; In this dream, my
mother had a strange looking man sitting behind her with glasses and a
brief case.&nbsp; My mother told me to tell the story of my father's
connection to Mickey Cohen, a well known gangster with ties to Bugsy
Siegel.&nbsp; Behind her the man standing behind her said: "Please tell
the story."&nbsp; I never told the story, until now.&nbsp; My father a
former tax investigator opened up a case that was pending since the
1950s.&nbsp; The reason it was pending is that the government
accountant investigating the case was killed by the mob for trying to
collect on State taxes.&nbsp; My father who just handled a case in
collecting State taxes from the Church of Scientology, that also owed
federal taxes to the IRS, took the challenge of reopening this
case.&nbsp; When meeting the mob in Los Angeles via a corporation that
they owned, the mobsters took my father out to dinner and wrote him a
check.&nbsp; It was an easy collection of State taxes owed, but a
government accountant in the 50s lost his life over this matter.&nbsp;
Perhaps the deceased accountant didn't want his life to be forgotten
and consulted my mother to tell his story?&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; I
don't know if my over active mind created this appearance of my mother
and the strange man behind her.&nbsp; Was that strange man behind her
the accountant?&nbsp; Then why didn't he tell me his name?&nbsp; Or
does he feel confident that anyone looking into this story, will
discover his name and complete the history of his encounter with the
mob.&nbsp; Perhaps I am the conduit for living people and deceased
people to tell their unfinished stories.&nbsp; I am here.&nbsp; I am
listening.<br>

Pet Spirit Story<br>
<br>
By: rannabear@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I love your website, and check in often, but never got around to
sharing my own story until now. I've never seen a ghost, but
occasionally feel them. Considering it freaks me out, I'm glad I only
occasionally feel them! <br>
My strongest story involves a favorite family cat. I grew up in a very
animal-friendly house in MA, with cats, dogs, birds - you name it. One
cat we had, named Joshua, made sure he gave me attention whenever I was
home from college. He'd sleep in my lap, play with papers in the trash
basket in my room - little things the other two cats didn't bother
with. My last year of school Joshua threw an embolism which paralyzed
his rear-end, and the decision had to be made to put him down. For
several trips home afterwards, I would think I heard someone playing in
my wastebasket, only to turn around and find myself alone. I'd shrug it
off and go back to whatever I was doing. One trip home, I was in my
room, door closed (anyone who is not used to sleeping under a cat pile
doesn't sleep, so I'd closed them out), light out, trying to sleep (but
not asleep yet). All of a sudden I felt a cat jump on the bed and take
two steps towards me - and then disappear.<br>
Figuring I'd missed somebody and closed them in with me, I got up and
turned on the light. Then searched the room - no cat. I think Joshua
was saying goodbye - I never heard anyone playing in my basket, and no
more jumps onto the bed. But there was no mistaking the jump or steps I
felt that night! He was a good cat.<br>
Thanks for letting me share - feel free to post this, if you want. Any
story which helps someone feel less alone and/or afraid is a good
thing! I would appreciate leaving my name out, though.<br>
Cheers! You are doing a good thing, helping people.<br>

just said "mommy" once !!! <br>

My Tale<br>

hi i have a story for you...<br>
Ok, me and my family believe in the pharanormal very much. Well one
afternoon I was home with few of my friends while my mom was at work, I
was sitting on the couch watching tv and talkin to my big brother. Well
i looked away for a minute to see if someone pulled in the drive, cause
it looked like someone did. Well i just sat there and looked out my
window to see if someone did. Well there was no one there. After a
minute i saw a black figure walk by my driveway into the shed. So i
told my brother to look out there and tell me if he could see the same
thing and he did. Well later on when it got a little darker out we kept
on see the figure walk by the window or just stand there and look at
us. Well one of my friends thought we were messing around to freak him
out. Well he say in front of the window and didnt see anything. He
doesnt believe in the things we do....But later that night my mom came
home and i told her about what we saw and everthing...And then i
remembered i lost my little brother ealier that year. Well after a
little bit my friend saw the same figure me and my older brother did.
And he started freaking out. Well ever since my brother passed away we
have saw that figure on nice summer days or on cold winter nights......<br>

I've had a few ghostly occurances happen to me, but two really stand out.<br>
The Lady With The Long Black Hair.<br>
When I was a little girl growing up in Somerville Ma., I was around
three I think. I would wake up every night because of a bad dream. I
would then make my way to my parents room to sleep for the remainder of
the night. I would have to pass through the kitchen to get there. The
lights were out, but there was some light coming in the windows from
the street lights. I would see "her" sitting on the kitchen counter, up
against the wall by one of the windows "the lady with the long black
hair" which is how I always referred to her. She was dressed in a long
black dress, pale face but shadowy, with illuminated green eyes. She
would just be sitting there and looking right at me, it always took my
breath away I was so afraid of her. I would inch my way toward my
mothers room with my back against the wall, never taking my eyes off
her. Her eyes followed my progress across the room, I always thought
"she's going to jump off the counter and get me" but that never
happened. Years later my Mom told me she had had strange things happen
to her in that house too but that's another story.<br>
A Visit From Nana<br>
Years later living as an adult in Hampton Va.<br>
One night I was awakened by something. When I opened my eyes and looked
around I was startled to see my nana sitting in bed with me ( nana had
died 6 months earlier ) it was kind of scary because she was grey and
just slightly transparent, also she had a shocked look on her face
almost like she was the scared one. Then in my head I heard her voice
saying "sshhhh sshhhh go back to sleep." Which I did. The next day I
remembered it all quite clearly, and thinking on it I feel like she had
been surprised that I had woken up and was looking right at her, I
don't think she'd bargained on that when she'd come to visit me.<br>

In Caldwell, Idaho<br>
<br>
By: Contessa212@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
we built our home in a new subdivision NW od Homedale rd, between
Midway Rd and Lake Ave, in Nov 2005.Caldwell,Idaho..... We had been
here 3 days , and during the night I heard footsteps&nbsp; and water
running in the kitchen..about a week after that,I asked my daughter
what she had cooked, because there was a dirty skillet on the
stove..Daughter claimed nothing. Many times in the months to come, I
had found things moved around the kitchen, in their proper place, also
water running in the night...Once a teapot whistle, and I didn't have a
teapot...Another time, I was home alone with my two Dashounds.I was
laying in bed about 1am, reading a book, I heard the frig open, then
water running..The dogs perked their ears up, but didn't bark, like
they were afraid themselves, then the noise went away...I haven't
followed the history of the subdivision, but my guess is , it was
farmland, and a older woman had passed away on this properity. The
spirit isn't harmful, so I go about my business and respect their
presence..<br>

Haunted Family - (pt.1)<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
First of all I really haven't experienced&nbsp; what "I thought" was a whole lot <br>
of "strange or"paranormal" activities than the average person might admit to<br>
(strange noises, glimpse's of shadows or something from the corner of your eye ,some times hearing my name called out <br>
when there's no one else around, that sort of thing)<br>
Although when I was a kid around the age of 5 to maybe about 10 years old, <br>
at bedtime in that "almost asleep" phase <br>
I would sometimes hear like these whispering voices, <br>
usually sounding&nbsp; like several overlapping but sometimes I could hear what sounded like my name.<br>
Naturally this scared me at first, but in time I could just kinda' tune it out.<br>
Then there's this one time when I was around 17yrs. old <br>
I&nbsp; think I saw the ghost of my then future wife's<br>
mother, in the house she and her family lived in.<br>
(my wife's mother passed away when she(my wife) was around 14,<br>
A few years Later when we were married, when our son was just an infant we lived in that same house for just over a year,<br>
some strange things happened, but like i said earlier probably no more then normal(?)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
anyway ,That's most of my personal experiences,<br>
The real paranormal or " Hunting's "&nbsp; was/is&nbsp; on my mother's side of the family.<br>
I'll try to tell these as they were told to me in the order <br>
that they may have happened in.<br>
My aunt Zella who was really religious and had no reason to make this
up, told of this time when she was just a little girl of about 6-10
years old,<br>
they were a poor coal miner family living in the hills of Ky. <br>
in a small home with a "Outhouse" in the backyard ( this was in the mid 1930's )<br>
There was this one time late at night/early morning she woke up needing
to "potty" she had to walk through the living room to get to the
kitchen back door,<br>
in the living room in front of the fireplace, lye what she thought was
a 'dog, that watched her as she hurried across the room to go out.<br>
This only startled her at first because&nbsp; they didn't have a house
dog,&nbsp; thinking she just imagined it in the dim light. She finished
her potty and this time slowly walked through so she might see it
better, well she then wished she didn't.<br>
It was still there,&nbsp; in front of the fire place ( that wasn't lit)
she said "its body looked like a hound dog or something like that but
its face was almost human like and it had what she thought&nbsp; might
be small horns on its forehead above its eyes".(or maybe the tips of
dog-like ears?)<br>
It did have a long dog-like snout that she swears was grinning at her
with its long fangs showing while its Devil like tail was slowly
wagging. <br>
She was paralyzed with fear until she let out a scream and was finally
able to run back to bed witch she had to share with her brother and
sister, <br>
she tried to wake them but they wouldn't wake up.<br>
She stayed under the covers between the two and finally fell&nbsp; back to sleep.<br>
That morning she told them about it ,of course they laughed and said
she just had a bad dream, after all she was only about 6 or 7 yrs
old&nbsp; and it was hard for her to explain it with that much detail
at that age But she swore that it was real and she could never forget
what she saw that night,<br>
and it was a long time before she would go to the "outhouse" at night
by herself again. This was just the first of many terrifying incidents
her family would experience <br>
(end pt.1)<br>
Haunted Family (pt.2)<br>
Sometime around the late "1960's thru the 70's" my aunt Zella, now living in Indianapolis, In. <br>
(many years after "Haunted Family pt.1)&nbsp; <br>
She lived in a "half-double" (I think it was on Keystone av.) that one of her&nbsp; daughters&nbsp; <br>
(I'll call her "Carol" ,my cousin who was about18-20&nbsp; years older
than me) and her family lived on the other-side of this double,&nbsp;
It was&nbsp; normal looking house, <br>
My mother visited her sister Zella and her family often&nbsp; Sometimes
I would stay overnight at my aunts when my parents would&nbsp; go out
on a Friday Or Saturday night.&nbsp; (Through out her home and
especially in the living-room, she had many crucifix's and pictures of
Jesus, angels &amp; other&nbsp; christian/religious pictures &amp;
items.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;She was really the first person that talked &amp; taught me about
Christianity,&nbsp; she didn't "preach" to me,&nbsp; she just told me
about God, Jesus &amp; how Satan could use his Evil
)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Anyway these events take place during the early to mid 70's,&nbsp; I
guess there first&nbsp; ghostly experience was when my cousin Carol was
up late one evening watching&nbsp; t.v.&nbsp; by herself&nbsp; while
her kids ( Wilson Jr. about 9 or 10 &amp;&nbsp; his younger sister
Deb&nbsp; who is 2 or 3 yrs. younger &amp; they are my 2nd
cousins)&nbsp; were in their beds, as well as her husband (although he
may have worked at nights I don't remember)&nbsp; Late this one night
she kept hearing loud noises that sounded&nbsp; like it was coming from
the kitchen or back porch from next door&nbsp; (where her mother Zella
lived) She went into her kitchen to hear&nbsp; to what sounded like
fighting with shouting &amp; screaming &amp;&nbsp; glass breaking &amp;
several people yelling &amp; screaming,&nbsp; she pounded on the
walls&nbsp; shouting " knock it off" .&nbsp; It was quiet for a few
minutes then it started up again,finally having enough of the
noise&nbsp; she went next door &amp; knocked on the front door where
her mother let her in ,and she excitedly ask what are her brothers
fighting about?!&nbsp;&nbsp; Zella (her mom) replies " what are you
talking about? the only ones here are me &amp; your&nbsp; daddy &amp;
he's asleep!&nbsp; Not really&nbsp; believing her,&nbsp; she go's&nbsp;
into the kitchen&nbsp; and finds nothing, she looks out on&nbsp; the
back porch and&nbsp;&nbsp; no ones there, confused she says "I know I
heard yelling &amp; fighting over here!"&nbsp;&nbsp; Again her&nbsp;
mother&nbsp; says no one else is here,&nbsp; you must have "dreamed"
it&nbsp;&nbsp; or something,&nbsp; Carol agrees&nbsp; maybe it was
the&nbsp; t.v&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp; heard in my sleep. <br>
Now,&nbsp; sometime later they learn from their landlord that many
years earlier,&nbsp; a couple of people were killed over a poker game
that fight broke out and two people were stabbed to
death!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Carol thinks&nbsp; its their ghost she heard , but her husband (who's a
preacher in a small church ) of course says nonsense to this (for now)<br>
