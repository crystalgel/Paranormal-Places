<BR><B>Apartment Dweller</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: spiritualist@tds.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Back in 1985 I was living in a one bedroom apartment in Norcross,
Georgia.</B>
<BR><B>I was going about my daily cleaning and was in the bedroom when
I heard a</B>
<BR><B>noise come from the living room.&nbsp; I went in to see what it
was and saw that</B>
<BR><B>my speaker had apparently lept off the table beside the entertainment
center</B>
<BR><B>and onto the floor.&nbsp; I thought it odd but shrugged it off,
picked up the</B>
<BR><B>speaker and placed it back on the table.&nbsp; A little while later
I heard</B>
<BR><B>another noise and went to see what it was.&nbsp; This time the lampshade
on the</B>
<BR><B>lamp that was on the same table had fallen straight down around
the lamp.</B>
<BR><B>The little screwcap that holds the shade in place had been missing
so it</B>
<BR><B>didn't seem like a big deal at the time.&nbsp; I lifted it back
up and placed it</B>
<BR><B>back on the upright screw at the top of the lamp and went back to
whatever</B>
<BR><B>it was I was doing at the time.&nbsp; A few more minutes and another
crashing</B>
<BR><B>sound.&nbsp; Only this time it was the sound of breaking glass.&nbsp;
I ran towards</B>
<BR><B>the sound which this time came from the dining area.&nbsp; In the
dining area</B>
<BR><B>against the wall that led into the kitchen I had a bookcase which
contained</B>
<BR><B>mostly knick-knacks, picture frames, vases, etc.&nbsp; On the bottom
shelf was a</B>
<BR><B>mirror that had rock-and-roll stickers on it (a sentimental item).&nbsp;
It had</B>
<BR><B>been slid in upright as one would place a book on a shelf, with
the top of</B>
<BR><B>the mirror leaning against the left wall of the bookcase.&nbsp;
To the right of</B>
<BR><B>that was a large clear glass shapely vase with a decal of a rose
on it.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>crash I had heard was the mirror falling over to the right and crashing
into</B>
<BR><B>the vase.&nbsp; I found it strange that the top of the mirror was
leaning to the</B>
<BR><B>right and on top of the now broken vase.&nbsp; It would have made
sense had the</B>
<BR><B>bottom of the mirror slid out to the right hitting the bottom of
the vase</B>
<BR><B>and knocking it over.&nbsp; Well this being the third item to fall
within what</B>
<BR><B>seemed like under an hour (I assure you at this point I had absolutely
no</B>
<BR><B>sense of time)&nbsp; I ran out of the apartment and waited outside
for my</B>
<BR><B>significant other to arrive home from work.&nbsp; When he finally
arrived I told</B>
<BR><B>him what happened and asked him to take me down to the rental office.&nbsp;
When</B>
<BR><B>I walked in I must have looked like I had seen a ghost (sorry folks
but I'm</B>
<BR><B>glad I didn't actually see a ghost, although years earlier I did,
but that's</B>
<BR><B>a whole other story).&nbsp; When I got to the rental office I asked
the lady at</B>
<BR><B>the front desk if anything had happened in my apartment.&nbsp; She
looked puzzled</B>
<BR><B>and asked me why I would ask such a thing.&nbsp; Without going into
details I</B>
<BR><B>told her I wasn't going back into that apartment.&nbsp; She asked
me to wait</B>
<BR><B>there and went into one of the back offices.&nbsp; When she came
back she looked</B>
<BR><B>like she had just seen a ghost and proceded to tell me that the
previous</B>
<BR><B>tenant had hung himself in the shower.&nbsp; She gave me his name
which I</B>
<BR><B>immediately recognized as I was still getting his mail.&nbsp; Needless
to say</B>
<BR><B>they gave me another apartment immediately.&nbsp; I honestly don't
remember</B>
<BR><B>packing up and moving out, but almost twenty years later and I still</B>
<BR><B>remember his name.&nbsp; I guess some things you just never forget.</B>
<BR><B>On the lighter side:&nbsp; Knowing what "WE" know about the other
plane of</B>
<BR><B>existance, do you ever feel funny about who might be watching when
you get</B>
<BR><B>naked?&nbsp; ...lol</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was six years old when I began seeing spirits...I was in school
one rainy afternoon waiting for my school bus, but it was already 5:00
pm and the bus doesn't arrive. So as a grade one student and because Im
bored, I went on classroom to classroom and play with the things that I
found there. I went to the third floor, the rooms of the High School students
were there. And when I passed by the music room, I heard the piano playing
all by itself, because of innocense I decided to take a look at it but
it keeps on playing. I wasn't scared that time but i felt that something
is going wrong. Then an old guy with a weird outfit(because of his hat
and gloves) and began to talk to me, I didn't ungderstand what he was saying
because he's saying it in English...a weird English....like in the Romeo
and Juliet dialogue....He played the paino and so do I. I told him that
i was getting tired and we stopped playing, I just yawned for seconds but
when I look at my back he disappeared. I kept on looking for him til my
grade five, hoping that he will play the piano with me, but he didn't.
At my grade six, our room was tranferred beside the music room, and i found
out to my classmates that the old man playing the piano, died so many years
ago...I got scared because i never thought that the old guy playing with
me is a ghost.</B>

<BR><B>Devil</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: fredromero72@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>On April 16,1997 12:00 midnight my most horrible experience happened
to me. . Although most people will not believe me it happened . I worked
at a meatpacker in Logensport,Indiana and had been working there for a
couple of months . I had second shift which was from 3:pm till 11:30 at
night on that 16th of april a couple of friends and I where on our way
home we rode a company van which droped us three blocks away from our home
. My friends lived closer to the van drop off than I did so I said my farewells
and took off for home .As I walked home I destnctley rememberd that I look
down at my watch to see what time it was only a couple of minutes till
midnight . As I walked I knew my wife would be waiting for me as she always
did . I was nearing my house only two houses down when a man dressed in
black called to me&nbsp; . he was behind a tree and asked if I had a cigerette
and me being a smoker I said , sure and handed him one as I brushed against
his hand I felt the most nullifying chill run down my spine then he asked
for a light as I pulled my lighter out&nbsp; and lit his cigerette but
as I did I could see that all the light that came from the lighter was
engulfed by total darkness . That was it for me I felt very frigtened all
of the sudden and bid him a good night .He than asked me what I was doing
a night such as that I quickly told him I was just going home from work&nbsp;
ahh he said, that is good for you would not like to be doing anything else
on this night for you never know whats out here waiting for you . Alright
sir thankyou for the advise I told him but I must relly be going . I turned
around to leave hastingly when he called after me by my real name which
is Fernando I turned around to see him knowing well I had not given him
my name and he said, Truely these are some sad times when man does not
fear Devil and laughed a most horrendous laughter that I had ever heard
and ran as quickly as my legs could move as I did I could'nt help turning
to see if he was behind me he just melted into thin air . When I got home
my wife asked if there was anything I felt alright she said I was very
pale I could,nt answer at that moment.. Later on without me telling her
anything she asked why was I standing there talking to the tree&nbsp; she
said she looked out the window to see if I was almost home when she saw
me talking to myself . I told her about the man and what he said,to me
and she went pale also for she had heard that same laughter but thougt
it was my drunk niegbors. I'll never forget that frightful night when I
think I had words with the Prince of Darkness himself . Believe me or not
it happened . I just wanted to share one of my many expiriences with you
all</B>

<P><B>Weird Stuff</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: lastmanstand1ng@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi my name is Gil and I live in VA moved here bout 3 years ago from
CA. Well I have a few stories for you guys which are all true they are
mostly about these shadow type things I saw since I was a child . First
when I was around 8 or so I was a my godmother's house and my cousin at
the time was bout 13&nbsp; or 14 he wasnt home so I helped myself to his
Atari so im playing and I see this shadow on my right&nbsp; thru the corner
of my eye so I turn quickly I thought I saw my cousin so I turned back
and kept playing Atari I turned back to tell him something, but he wasnt
there anymore&nbsp; so I went out to the living room where everyone was
at and i asked my godmother I belive it was , I asked here where my cousin
went when he left the room, she told me he had not gotten there yet. The
second time was here in this house we live in now, we moved in this house
bout 6 or 7 months ago. I was alone one day with my son and daughter which
are 6 and 4 im 22 now, and it was my day off so&nbsp; we where alone and
I told them play upstairs in the livingroom while I make you guys something
to eat downstairs. So im gettin everything ready when I see i small shadow
child size figure run down the stairs and into the laundry room. So im
thinking its my daughter&nbsp; her being the smallest, so I go in the laundry
room and say " I told you kids to stay upstairs " walk in the door and
no one was there so I yeall to my daughter "karina where are you at " and
she responds tp me from upstairs "im up here daddy "&nbsp; didnt realy
freak me out but I thought it was kinda wierd. Third time , and Ill try
and make this as quick as i can. was in the this same house bout 2 months
ago my wife and I a in bed getting ready to sleep so I turned the light
off , its now pitch black and im laying on my back with my eyes open ,
andI see this long blanket shaped thing above us waving around like a flag
when its windy like that kinda I thought it was my eyes getting used to
the night , then I saw it get up close to my face and back away in a wavey
motion, I didnt make much of it. So the next morning I wake up&nbsp; and
my wife says to me&nbsp; that she was a little scared last night and I
tell her "why is it because , so I explained to her what I felt and saw.
She said she didnt see anything but she felt a presence of something floating
over us and getting close to her also, That was wierd. Last one im ganna
tell yall was today . Today I actually saw your web site for the first
it rocks.but anyways i was at work looking at your website when I looked
thru this little window we have in my dept you can see the cashiers desk
thru there, so I looked and i saw a black shadowish figure standing in
front of the cashiers file cabinet, I looked quickly at it but I thought
it was the other cashier , there are only 2 cashiers and I hadf saw one
of them from where I was sittin , so I walked over just to chat with both
of them thinking they where both there , when I walked around here desk
she was the only one there. I didnt tell here anything&nbsp; they prolly
think im a nut case , they do already , so I didnt say anything. Well thats
it for today I have more stories to share with yall. I read somewhere about
these shadow people or shadow beings of some sort , that they do exsist
and are far more advanced than we are , or something like that, and that
they move too fast for us too see, thats why youll see them thru the corner
of your eyes sometimes. Let me know what you think of these stories.you&nbsp;
can contact me if you wish at lastmanstand1ng@yahoo.com&nbsp; with a 1
not an I&nbsp; for the stand1ng part . Thank you for reading about my experiences.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Upset Ghost?</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Keywizard@comcast.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>When I was in high school I would go around my town and the surrounding
towns and look for hauntings.&nbsp; I have found a lot of places that are
inhabited with ghosts, but one experience happened in my own room.&nbsp;
It was about 9 p.m. and I was finishing my homework for the weekend.&nbsp;
It was a friday night and I was supposed to go to a friends house to spend
the night.&nbsp; She called a few minutes later saying that I couldn't
come over because she had to leave for Salt Lake City because her sister
went into labor.&nbsp; I decided to read a chapter from my book and then
go to bed.&nbsp; While I was reading my book I kept getting weird feelings
like someone was sitting on the bed next to me and when I turned to look
there was no one there so I continued to read.&nbsp; I half-way through
my chapter when the feeling got so strong it made me feel really uncomfortable
and irritated so I closed my book and turned off the light.&nbsp; I told
whatever was in my room the I just wanted to read my book and whatever
it was was bothering me and that I'd just go to bed.&nbsp; I leaned over,
put my book down on the floor and laid on my bed for a couple of seconds
( and I'm not tired at all) when I heard someone say have look down here.&nbsp;
The sound was coming from where I put my book down so I leaned back over
to see what "it" wanted and a crumbled up piece of paper flew and hit me
right in the face.&nbsp; It really starled me because I wasn't expecting
it.&nbsp; I turned on the light and looked around and I saw the wad of
paper on the floor not to far from the bed.&nbsp; I grabbed the paper and
opened it up and it had been a piece of paper that I had thrown away from
my homework. I've seen ghosts and heard disturbances at one of my friends
house, but that was the first and only time one had thrown something at
me.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Native Battle Ground</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: princeoftorture@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ok well I don't know if I'm going crazy or something but here's my
story.</B>
<BR><B>Me and my family moved into a place. Near the outskirts of town.
It was a</B>
<BR><B>nice place because my father bought the land. Well first few nights
it was</B>
<BR><B>ordinary, We spent awhile unpacking our stuff. We were halfway done
after</B>
<BR><B>our 3rd or 4th day, and we decided to call it a night and continue
unpacking</B>
<BR><B>the next day. Well we woke up the next morning and almost half our
things</B>
<BR><B>were packed up again. My parents of course thought it was a sick
joke that I</B>
<BR><B>did, and I had no proof to convince them I was innocent. But it
just started</B>
<BR><B>to get weirder and weirder, at night I would hear drums outside.
The drums</B>
<BR><B>would get louder then sounds of males singing. Well chanting or
something I</B>
<BR><B>never could tell what they were saying, it sounded like it was a
different</B>
<BR><B>language. Then I would hear wolves howl while dogs barked. I found
it weird</B>
<BR><B>cause I didn't have a dog, so I thought it was a neighbors or something.</B>
<BR><B>Then one night I woke up hearing that song again. But this time
it seemed</B>
<BR><B>different, There were no drums no wolves nor dogs. But it wasn't
the same</B>
<BR><B>voices who sang it. It was a single female voice and I knew instantly
as</B>
<BR><B>well. The voice was inside the house. Me being stupid I went to
check it out</B>
<BR><B>I saw a young girl. I couldn't tell the age but I remember seeing
her back</B>
<BR><B>turned to me in a brown dress with beads and long black hair in
braids. I</B>
<BR><B>was terrified at first then she looked at me and suddenly her voice
turned</B>
<BR><B>to a hard screech and I screamed with her. My parents found me unable
to</B>
<BR><B>stop shaking, and I barely slept after. I only remembered that face
it was</B>
<BR><B>weird. A childs body, but not a childs face it was like... older
I guess</B>
<BR><B>decaying features pain etched in her ugly features. I can't really
explain</B>
<BR><B>it. But not long after our neighbors told us, our house and land
was build</B>
<BR><B>under a native battle ground and many men, women and children were
buried on</B>
<BR><B>that spot. We moved from there after and I look at natives with
a new high</B>
<BR><B>respect. But never forgeting that's child face of sorrow</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Uncle Vern's Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: lil_katie_xoxo@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I love the stories on this site, and hopefully you'll all like these
stories! The first thing that happened was to my grandparents.&nbsp; They
were living in a house, across the street from where they live now (and
where I lived for about 13 years), and my grandmother's brother Vern used
to visit my grandfather all the time. My grandfather had a woodworking
shop in the basement, and Vern would come over pretty much everyday, for
most of the day.&nbsp; My family started building the house they live in
now, probably about 17 or more years ago. One day my great-uncle Vern had
a heartattack, and passed away.&nbsp; The rest of my family finished building
the house, and my grandparents moved in not long after it was done. It
was a duplex, and a few years later, we (my mom and i) lived in, but that's
for later in the story.&nbsp; Once the old house was purchased from my
grandparents, the people who bought it started to complain about strange
things happening..&nbsp; There was a woman who was really sick one winter
(we live in northern ontario so we get a lot of snow) and she had the sofa
couch pulled out and she was looking out of the huge window in the living
room.&nbsp; Then she noticed a man with brown curly hair looking at her
through the window. She got scared, so she went to the door to see what
he wanted, and when she opened the front door he was gone and there were
no footprints in the snow (they never used this door, so footprints would
be very obvious).&nbsp; There was another incident with Vern in this house
(that we know about) and it involved the homeowner's son, whose bedroom
was in the basement (where the woodworking shop used to be). The son was
sleeping one night with the basement door closed when he heard the doorknob
rattling loudly and banging on the door, Vern trying to get in. We figure&nbsp;
rn was looking for my grandfather. When we heard all of this, we knew it
was him because he had brown curly hair, and was always in the basement
working with my grandfather.&nbsp; Now I'll talk about what happened to
me, when we were living in the duplex with my grandparents, I was probably
about 11 or 12 at the time. We lived in the upstairs portion of the duplex,
and my grandparents in the bottom.&nbsp; I was asleep one night and something
woke me up and I felt a presence in my room that bothered me, it almost
felt angry.&nbsp; So i went to my mom's room, and got into bed with her.
When I was laying there, just staring at the ceiling, I heard the sound
of someone walking on the carpet in my mom's room, right near my side of
the bed. It startled me because my mom was still in bed, we dont have any
pets, and there was no one else in the house with us.&nbsp; That was the
only thing that really happened to me, except for seeing shadows out of
the corner of my eye.&nbsp; Now this is what happened to me recently, I
was asleep in our new house (we've only lived here for about 3-4 years)
and i woke up and saw a shadow that i assume was a man, standing at the
foot of my bed. It scared me, and i was just lying in bed staring in horror
when it started walking around my side of the bed, and when it got about
3 feet away from me it disappeared.&nbsp; I was terrified, and i told myself
it was nothing and went back to bed.&nbsp; I woke up again to hear a man's
voice say something, i dont remember what exactly, but he had a really
deep voice. By this time i was scared out of my mind, so i didnt really
get much sleep after that. But since then I've been hearing someone walking
around my house when no one else is home, mostly on the main floor, in
the kitchen. I'll write again if anything else happens, but feel free to
email me!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Scary Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: paulheron453@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>The following two stories I tell here happened in the</B>
<BR><B>house where I have lived all of my life thus far.&nbsp; I live in</B>
<BR><B>Scotland just a few miles outside the centre of Glasgow.</B>
<BR><B>The house I live in was built around 1947, I was born in</B>
<BR><B>1977, so this house is only about 30 years older than me.</B>
<BR><B>It also has to be said that the area isn't the spookiest in</B>
<BR><B>the world.&nbsp; I mean if you hear any spooky stories from this</B>
<BR><B>part of the world, you tend to think of very old stately</B>
<BR><B>homes etc.&nbsp; My house isn't very old and is certainly not</B>
<BR><B>what could be described as stately.&nbsp; There is a mention of</B>
<BR><B>accents in these stories although that shouldn't worry</B>
<BR><B>anyone.&nbsp; Although it is kindof strange that a country with</B>
<BR><B>a population of only five million people should have so</B>
<BR><B>many variations in the way people speak.&nbsp; I'd like to offer</B>
<BR><B>my heartfelt thanks for giving me the oppourtunity to</B>
<BR><B>post my stories through this website.&nbsp; I feel it is great</B>
<BR><B>that we can share our experiences with a much wider</B>
<BR><B>audiance that was previously possible.&nbsp; Anyway on with</B>
<BR><B>the stories.</B>
<BR><B>Around 3 years ago, I was lying in bed one Sunday morning,</B>
<BR><B>after having a few pints the previous evening.&nbsp; The time</B>
<BR><B>was between about 10:30 and 11:30 and if I remember</B>
<BR><B>correctly I was in that state where you're fully awake but</B>
<BR><B>not quite full of energy.&nbsp; As I mentioned I'd had a drink the</B>
<BR><B>previuos evening.&nbsp; Feeling not quite hungover but still a</B>
<BR><B>little weary, I sat up in bed and considered whether or not</B>
<BR><B>to get up and do something such as get a coffee or a cup of</B>
<BR><B>tea, perhaps something to eat.&nbsp; I then sat on the side of</B>
<BR><B>my bed and had a cigarette, in order to try and focus a bit</B>
<BR><B>more.&nbsp; By this point my eyes where feeling a bit sensitive</B>
<BR><B>(I've got naturally sensitive eyes and they're not at their</B>
<BR><B>best in the mornings), so I decided to lie down for a bit.</B>
<BR><B>After a few moments lying on my front I decided against</B>
<BR><B>more sleep and ascertained that the best idea would be to</B>
<BR><B>get up and do something.&nbsp; I didn't have anywhere to go</B>
<BR><B>that day but I knew that if I went back to sleep, I'd</B>
<BR><B>probably not get up until well into the afternoon.</B>
<BR><B>As I was about to start moving from a position where I</B>
<BR><B>was lying face-down but awake, to a postion where I would</B>
<BR><B>be out of bed and standing upright; I heared a voice</B>
<BR><B>muttering something in my ear.&nbsp; The voice only lasted for</B>
<BR><B>a couple of seconds and I couldn't work out one word that</B>
<BR><B>was said.&nbsp; The voice was not masculine enough to be</B>
<BR><B>definately male nor feminine enough to be definately</B>
<BR><B>female.&nbsp; All I could work out was that the voice was adult</B>
<BR><B>and had an accent that could be vaguely described as</B>
<BR><B>belonging to somewhere in the west of Scotland.&nbsp; It was</B>
<BR><B>impossible to work out anything more specific than that.</B>
<BR><B>Of course I thought this was weird but decided that</B>
<BR><B>dwelling on it wouldn't be good for my sanity and that the</B>
<BR><B>best idea would be to get out of bed and forget about it.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>was still lying on my front at this point and started to</B>
<BR><B>move so that I could get out of bed.&nbsp; Suddenly I felt as if</B>
<BR><B>something was holding me down!&nbsp; I could only manage to</B>
<BR><B>move about an inch or two before it felt impossible for me</B>
<BR><B>to move any further.&nbsp; To be honest I didn't put up much of</B>
<BR><B>a struggle after the first couple of attempts to move.</B>
<BR><B>This was mainly due to the fact that I was scared shitless</B>
<BR><B>and simply couldn't work out what the hell was going on. I</B>
<BR><B>was fully awakened at this point so there is absolutley no</B>
<BR><B>way I could've been dreaming any of this.&nbsp; The sensation of</B>
<BR><B>being held down by some unknown force seemed to last for</B>
<BR><B>about two minutes (which in a situation like that seems</B>
<BR><B>ages), before I was finally able to move.&nbsp; This was an</B>
<BR><B>extremely scary experience for me and not one I wish to</B>
<BR><B>ever repeat.</B>
<BR><B>Of course having said that I never wish to repeat the</B>
<BR><B>above mentioned experience, something similar happened to</B>
<BR><B>me only a few days ago, (this is written on 09 February</B>
<BR><B>2004), although this was at night as opposed to the</B>
<BR><B>morning.&nbsp; If my memory is accurate enough I would say the</B>
<BR><B>time was around the early hours of wednesday morning,</B>
<BR><B>circa 2 or 3 am.</B>
<BR><B>I was trying to get into a comfortable position so that I</B>
<BR><B>could fall asleep (it takes me a good while to dose off),</B>
<BR><B>when suddenly I felt what can only described as a WEIRD</B>
<BR><B>feeling.&nbsp; I was lying on my front, when I suddenly noticed
a</B>
<BR><B>sensation of being held down by what felt like some sort of</B>
<BR><B>shadowy force.&nbsp; The air around me seemed to change in</B>
<BR><B>quality, if that makes any sense?&nbsp; By this point I was</B>
<BR><B>feeling very scared and somewhat bemused as to what the</B>
<BR><B>hell was happening.&nbsp; I made an attempt to scream at the</B>
<BR><B>top of my voice but could only make a pathetic little</B>
<BR><B>wheeze of noise, so low in fact that even I could hardly</B>
<BR><B>hear it.&nbsp; I tried to shout again and this time the results
of</B>
<BR><B>my previous effort was replicated, i.e. a pathetic little</B>
<BR><B>wheeze.&nbsp; I still had the feeling of being held down but I had</B>
<BR><B>somehow managed to free my right arm.&nbsp; I decided that I</B>
<BR><B>would thump the wall to my right hand side as hard as I</B>
<BR><B>could.&nbsp; This is quite a soft wall so in theory I should have</B>
<BR><B>made a fairly loud noise without any risk of hurting myself.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;With every ounce of stregnth I could manage, I clenched</B>
<BR><B>my fist and with a feeling mixed with fear, rage, confusion</B>
<BR><B>and even a little bit of curiosity, I WHACKED my hand</B>
<BR><B>off the wall.&nbsp; THe sound that followed can only be</B>
<BR><B>decribed as feeble.&nbsp; Think of hitting a paper tissue with a</B>
<BR><B>feather and that should give you a good idea.&nbsp; By this point</B>
<BR><B>I felt like what seemed like an arm om my back.&nbsp; Out of a</B>
<BR><B>mixture of curiosity, a sense of wanting to fight back</B>
<BR><B>(probably stupid I know), I attempted to grab hold of this</B>
<BR><B>arm.&nbsp; What I would've done if I had managed to grab this</B>
<BR><B>arm I'll never be able to fully ascertain.&nbsp; However, all I
can</B>
<BR><B>say is that when I look back, I glad that my efforts were in</B>
<BR><B>vain.&nbsp; The arm seemed to have quickly moved out of the</B>
<BR><B>way and I was no longer within reach of it.&nbsp; By this point
I</B>
<BR><B>could feel the pressure on me begining to diminish and I'm</B>
<BR><B>absolutely positive that I heared a voice in my ear saying in</B>
<BR><B>a west of Scotland accent:&nbsp; "Therr eh is." (that is: "There</B>
<BR><B>he is." for anyone unfamiliar with the vernaculer).&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>managed to work out that the voice was adult, male, and</B>
<BR><B>probably belonged to Glasgow or somewhere fairly close.</B>
<BR><B>Ater that the feeling of being held down stoopped entirely</B>
<BR><B>and I was left in a cold sweat wondering what on earth</B>
<BR><B>had happened.&nbsp; I sat up in bed and smoked heavilly while</B>
<BR><B>trying calm myself down and didn't manage to get into a</B>
<BR><B>sleep until around 5:30 am.&nbsp; All I can say is that this</B>
<BR><B>wasn't the most welcome experience of my life and not the</B>
<BR><B>sort of fate that I would ever wish on anyone else.</B>
<BR><B>Thanks.</B>

<P><B>My Haunted House</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: Tigger1454@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Hello. When I was little I lived in a town called Fenton just outside
of the city of St. Louis. My brother always told me that the house we lived
in was haunted but thought he was just trying to scare me. Boy was I wrong.
The happenings started happening when I was around the age of 7 this was
the time I had moved in to my brothers room. Every night I would get scared
and go in to my mom's room, when my brother lived in the room he also sleeped
in my mom's room. The first time I got really scared was when I was sleeping
in my room, I was woke up by this pounding on the closet doors I was so
scared I didn't want any body to think that I was crazy I didn't tell anyone.
Do you want to hear something funny? When my brother lived in the room
he used to hide in his dolls so what ever it was that was in the room couldn't
find him. The down stairs of the house was also haunted. After my brother
moved out of his room he moved down stairs. One night when he was slepping
he awoke to a sound like someone banging the airvent with a hammer. He
thought it was me. So he came up stairs and woke me up and yelled at me
for wakeing him up. I told him it was not me and he told me the story.
He was so scared he sleeped on the foor beside my bed. The ghost wasn't
always scary or maybe there was another ghost in the house. When I got
really mad I would hide in my closet. It what ever it was that was there
kind of held me in it's arms and when I can out I would be so happy. Well
that is the end of my ture life story.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Aunt Visited</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Jn2Harr@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was 15, my parents decided that they were going to retire
in Newport News, VA.&nbsp; My father was in the Army.&nbsp; In 1989 they
found the "perfect" house.&nbsp; It was in a new subdivision that was being
built up.&nbsp; In fact, the house they chose hadn't even been finished
being built.&nbsp; Well, towards the end of 1989, the house was finally
finished, after going through 5 different builders, as each one went bankrupt.&nbsp;
I was told that the subdivision was built on consecrated ground, I am unsure
of this fact.&nbsp; We moved in and all was fairly quiet for a few months.&nbsp;
My Aunt wanted to visit but she had been diagnosed with leukemia early
in 1990 and was unable to visit.&nbsp; She would call my mom every weekend
for updates on the house and what color we were painting this bedroom and
what border was going into that dining room.&nbsp; She was extremely upset
that she couldn't visit and see the house, we had lived in Europe for 10
years prior to my parents decision to retire, she would cry and get upset
and soon came a time that my Uncle refused to let her call my mom.&nbsp;
My mother was extremely upset and never forgot that her best friend promised
to visit and prayed for a quick and speedy recovery.&nbsp; The time came
to pass that my Aunt finally passed away.&nbsp; We didn't receive a phone
call that day, as it was too late in the evening, my Uncle explained.&nbsp;
We never told him that the phone call was unnecessary, my Aunt had already
told us in so many words that she was gone.&nbsp; The night that she died,
my mom and I were up and watching old Abbott and Costello movies, hers
and my Aunts favorites. She just felt like watching them that night.&nbsp;
Anyways, halfway through one of the movies, my mom turned torward the kitchen
and told me to wave to my Godmother.&nbsp; And standing outside the kitchen
door, outside, was my Aunt.&nbsp; She was waving to both my mom and I.
She had a smile and you could clearly see her, she had tears running down
her face.&nbsp; My mother was so thrilled to know that her best friend
kept her promise, even in death.&nbsp; There is a water mark in the room
on the ceiling in the room I used to sleep in when I lived there, it showed
up the night my Aunt visited, and it hadn't rained for a few weeks.&nbsp;
There are other water marks there that showed up in the time that I lived
there as family passed away.&nbsp; When my grandfather passed away a water
mark appeared the length of my bed.&nbsp; All the watermarks were investigated
by the builders then because of the home warrenty and no leaks were detected
and my mother has tried to paint over them and they reappear.&nbsp; None
of my siblings will sleep in the room when they visit.&nbsp; I gladly stay
in that room, I feel protected.&nbsp; I just wish that my Aunt had been
able to visit in real life, but am happy that she kept her promise to my
mom.&nbsp; I have just recently, myself, bought my first house and eagerly
await my first experiences in this house.&nbsp; Thank you.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Was It a Dream?</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: DustC2@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>When I was four years old I had recieved a barbie doll for my birthday.&nbsp;
That night I went to bed as usual and I placed the doll at the side of
my bed so I wouldnt break her in my sleep.&nbsp; I locked my door from
the inside so my little baby sister couldnt get in and I went to bed.&nbsp;
In the middle of the night I saw a lady dressed all in white come in and
kiss my forehead, tuck me in, and then she took my doll and left without
a word.&nbsp; I woke up, thinking that this was just a dream until I looked
down and my doll was gone.&nbsp; I asked my mother why she came into my
room (thinking that it was her) and she said that she didnt.&nbsp; I told
her that she was wearing a white night gown and that she kissed me and
tucked me in.&nbsp; My mother then pulled out every night gown that she
owned and the closest she had to a white was a green one.&nbsp; She told
me that maybe I dreamed it all up.&nbsp; I told her that my doll was missing
and that the lady took it.&nbsp; But she never believed me......until now.</B>
<BR><B>We had moved out of that apartment in Sioux City, Iowa and into
a house where I remember growing up until I was eighteen.&nbsp; I moved
back into that very same apartment thinking that it was just my imagination
when I was younger.&nbsp; That was until the third night after I moved
in.&nbsp; I lived on the top floor and yet I could hear something on the
roof.&nbsp; I found an attic door and inside I found a chest with a painting
in it.&nbsp; The painting was of a woman that looked exactly like my little
sister who was now 16.&nbsp; The only difference was the style of clothing.&nbsp;
The woman in the painting was dressed like she was from the 1700-1800's.&nbsp;
I couldnt understand it so I took the painting to my mother.&nbsp; She
had asked where I got it.&nbsp; I told her where I had found it and she
said that was impossible.&nbsp; She said that the painting was hung up
in my grandmothers house when they lived in Adams, Tennessee.&nbsp; But
the house burnt down in the 70's.&nbsp; The painting burnt up for all they
knew.&nbsp; She had no clue on how it had come to be in the attic of my
top story apartment.&nbsp; Then she told me about all the wierd things
that had happened to our family in the past 40 years.&nbsp; My mother is
convinced that a ghost had "piggy-backed" with her all the way from Tennessee.</B>
<BR><B>I see ghosts sometimes to this day.&nbsp; I am 24 now and I am living
in Bellingham, Washington.&nbsp; I now share my apartment with my husband
Jeff and ghost I call Emily.&nbsp; She is a little girl about six years
old and she is very playful.&nbsp; She doesnt scare me but she loves to
mess with me.&nbsp; My husband hasnt seen her yet but my neighbors have.&nbsp;
She likes to turn off the tv and surround sound system while I am using
them.&nbsp; She also loves to misplace my remotes that I leave on the end
tables.&nbsp; If I move them to the entertainment stand she doesnt touch
them.&nbsp; She never talks but always laughs.&nbsp; I have gone out and
bought some toys and a toybox to put them in.&nbsp; When I go out she plays
with them but leaves them on the floor.&nbsp; I just gently say "Emily,
I am going to the bathroom now and when I get back I expect all of the
toys to be back in the box"&nbsp; and by the time I get back, they are
all in the box.&nbsp; I treat her just like she was my own child.&nbsp;
Sure, I cant feed her or hug her or anything but even at Christmas, I get
her a gift.&nbsp; I think she likes that.</B>
<BR><B>This is my "partial" story of my experiences with ghosts.&nbsp;
If you would like to hear the rest of my story (when I was growing up -between
the ages of 4 and 18) please, feel free to contact me at this email address.&nbsp;
Thank you for your time.</B>

<P><B>Haunted Hotel in the Rockies</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: cordiggity007@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>All my life I've believed in ghosts, but I've never had any strange
experiences until I started working at the Banff Springs Hotel a few years
ago. The hotel was built in 1888 and has a long history of paranormal activity
that the management will not confirm. I worked the graveyard shift for
almost two years though, and I've seen and heard some strange things.</B>
<BR><B>Its not unusual to hear someone say the hotel creeps them out. In
the dead of night its like being in an old castle, and when you're alone,
you're imagination can run away with you. These, however, are not stories
of imagination.</B>
<BR><B>Most of the things are trival. I would be working alone, waxing
or buffing a hall and perhaps I'd hear voices or echos coming from the
next room. Upon investigation I'd find nothing amiss. Sometimes when I'd
buff the Mt. Stephan hall I'd see the lights of a room that overlooked
it (the Strathcona Room). I'd be buffing, looking around because I'm bored
and I'd note that the lights would be off. Minutes later I'd look up and
see that they were on. Perhaps security doing their rounds? Minutes later
they'd be flickering on and off. This unnerved me, but not enough to simply
quit a well paying job. Besides, I was always within at least fifty yards
of another custodian or security employee.</B>
<BR><B>After a few months we got a new security guy. After a few days he
voiced his discomfort with the Strathcona Room. Many agreed(myself included)
that there was definity a "bad vibe" in that room. Later that week I was
in a playful mood and with the help of a few co-workers, we unlocked the
room and proceeded to rearrange it to look scary. We put chairs on the
floor in the shape of an up-side down cross and hung some crimson graduation
robes conveniently found the closet off the light fixture. After we surveyed
our work, we agreed that it looked truly scary, especially to one who was
already afraid of the room. My buddies went off to lunch, and I called
security pretending to be a guest and reported strange sounds coming from
the room. Then I ran down the hall to a vantage point that gave me full
view of the doorway. I knew that the new guy would be sent alone, having
already let his friends in on the joke, and I was looking forward to watching
him open the door and freak out.</B>
<BR><B>The minutes ticked by, and finally I heard footstep approaching.
The new guy was certainly taking his time and in no hurry to investigate
the "strange sounds" that were reported from the room. I watched as he
slid his key card in the lock and open the door. I couldn't see inside
the room, but I saw him standing in the doorway. I watched him look around
for a few moments and calmly close the door and walk away. Now I was confused.
There's no way this guy could've seen that room and not have lost it. When
he was gone down the hall, I left my hiding spot and unlocked the Strathcona
Room. I hit the lights and found the room to be in the exact condition
it was in prior to my redecorating. As if nothing was moved in the first
place. The chairs were neatly arranged against the wall, and the robes
were back in the closet. I suddenly became aware that I was very alone
in the terrifying room and got out with little delay. I know that no one
entered that room between the time I left and the time the new guy stepped
in because I never got out of sight of the door. After that I never stepped
in there alone again. Many other strange things happened in that area of
the hotel. Doors opening in front of me, strange odours. Perhaps I'll share
them with you another time, but right now the chills in my spine are too
much to dwell on the disturbing events.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Fremont N.C The Tracks</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jennifer_1986@ripline.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Well, the first night me and a friend went at about 11:30&nbsp; and
we parked the car in front of the tracks and got out. We were going to
walk the tracks but as soon we step on the tracks the light turned on and
it started moving toward us very fast. But, when we stepped off the light
stopped. We had a flash light and we shined it down there and it went away.
Then we went back the next night we went back, with two more friends.Three
of us walked the tracks and one was in the car. The person in the car saw
the light the whole time. We never saw it walking, the people walking along
with myself saw shadows crossing the tracks but only from the waist down.
We all turn around&nbsp; and the air smelt stale and it was ice cold. The
person in the car call me on my cell phone and said the light was ten feet
behind us so, we turn back around and it was behind us again. Then we heard
the train and something like footsteps walking about five feet behind us
so we stopped and it walked in front of us.</B>

<P><B>Florida Ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B>
<BR><B>For several years dating back to my childhood in Pensacola, Fl I
knew that ghosts existed. There were haunted forts and lighthouses and
cliffs named for "warlocks". There were far too many weird experiences
there that led me to believe otherwise.</B>
<BR><B>The first memorable sighting&nbsp; of a ghost occurred as a young
boy of 7 . As I sat in the living room of our tiny 3 bedroom block house
I looked back into my parents' bedroom only to see a man in a dark suit
of about 25-28 years old staring at me with a piercing glare. He was non
exisitent moments later. Pictures later revealed that he was the ghost
of my mother's first husband who had several years died years before of
leukemia. He had suffered terribly before his death and had been seen by
my older half sister several times outside her window after his death ,
waving her to come with him.</B>
<BR><B>Several years later as I was visiting that same home from college
in Gainesville, I was lying in bed fully awake in my tiny bedroom and heard
what I thought was my mother walking in the room on terrazzo floors. It
was pitch black and I heard the person/ghost walk right to the edge of
my top bunk bed lean over and whisper jibberish right into my ear.I yelled
and my mother came in but no one was there.That was very vivid and still
sends chills up my spine.</B>
<BR><B>Several years later I moved to Boca Raton, Fl and bought an older
home in west Boca that came complete with regular weird happenings. Once
I awoke to see an elderly man in a suit leaning over my wife. Another time
I saw a green mist as I awoke that hovered over my abdominal area. As I
moved my hand past it the mist fled like a trail of smoke quickly out the
bedroom. Another time we arrived home to find several snakes in my little
daughter's bedroom.</B>
<BR><B>The thing that capped it all off in that house was predicted by
a psychic who told me several months before that the house would suffer
a fire in 2 rooms.Well, that happened, and happened right before my eyes
as a wall outlet shorted and the&nbsp; wall curtains went up in seconds
to create a total destruction of the wicked bedroom. I have often wondered
why these ghosts were there and why there was such an evil end to that
bedroom and the adjacent room.</B>
<BR><B>Bottom line here is that there are definitely ghosts out there and
the things I have seen were not the by-product of hallucinogens or depression.
Ghosts exist and perhaps some mortals are better conduits than others for
their communication.I suppose I am one of those.</B>

<P><B>Sheperd My Dog</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Edamarsall@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I had a few weirdo things happen to me in my life that I could not
explain. The one thing that happen was when I was about 12 yrs old. I lived
on Stevenson&nbsp; Ave in Louisville, Ky. It was early summer and an old
lady across the street was building a house and she kept a dog chained
up to perfect her house during the week. The only thing was that in a few
days the dog did not have enough water to last the week. I was a dog lover
so I started to bring water to her so she would not go thirsty. The dog
broke her chain an began to come to my House and no matter how many times
I tried to bring her back she would return to me. I loved her much and
she loved me. About a year later she dugged up my dads flower garden and
my step dad got so mad that he made me take her to the dog pound. I cried
but I thought that I would see her soon. I went there ever day to feed
her my lunch until the 3 day when they tool me that a farmer had taken
her home to live with them. I was happy about that. About 2 months later
when I came home from school I started to hear sounds like shepherd walking
on the sidewalk like she always did after school to meet me but right when
I thought I would she her she.,was not there. I thought It was my imagination.
One night as I was going to bed I was looking down at the floor when I
heard shepherds feet clicking on the floor and when I looked up I saw Shepherd
wagging her tail at me and then she disappeared before my eyes. I think
she came back to tell me good-bye because I realized that she was dead.&nbsp;
I had some other strange things happen to me over the years but I miss
Shepherd the most.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Restless Summers</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Hurleygurlie0227@wmconnect.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This all takes place at my aunts old house in Atlanta, GA.</B>
<BR><B>When my aunt and uncle first got the house they thought it was a
dream come true they had just had a baby and later would have two more
while living there. The previous owner was an older woman in her late forties
she took off in a hurry leaving alot of her stuff alot of it my aunt and
uncle sold off later but it was just odd how she just took off.</B>
<BR><B>Well shortly after my aunt and uncle moved in&nbsp; they noticed
strange things start to happen. The Basement extra room later transformed
into a guest room , never felt quite felt right there was just something
there.</B>
<BR><B>When me and my sister would come for the summer we would have to
sleep in the basement bedroom. Well one night there was this huge mickey
mouse doll that was sitting in the rocking chair in the room well the next
morning when me and my sister woke up ( we were always the first awake
) the mickey mouse doll was sitting in the bed. The t.v. downstairs would
turn on and off by itself we just thought it was a shortage but my aunt
said it would only happen when someone stayed downstairs.They had it checked
for shortages and it was fine. Lights would always turn on and off by themselves
it scared me so bad.</B>
<BR><B>My aunt never had problems with her first child but with the other
two after moving into the house she had tons of problems with their births.
Myself and my sister would always see shadows moving on the walls and stuff.
Then this had me convinced , after my aunt had her third child my uncle
said one night that he was sort of out of it but he knew what was going
on . He told me that do you know when someone sits on the edge of your
bed they're weight holds the bed so your body rolls toward them then he
said his body rolled but later back into his original place like the person
got off the bed. The next day my uncle asked my aunt why she had gotten
up with the baby and sat on his side of the bed she said i don't know what
your talking about the baby slept all night so i never got up. He told
me later that what was ever on the bed was too heavy to be one of the little
girls.</B>
<BR><B>They later moved to another house and im glad becuase now me and
my sister have no more restless summers.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Cemetery Footsteps</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ryanpam2000@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>About three years ago, my friend Mike and I decided to go to Old
Sheldon Church(the same one listed in your haunted index). We went in the
summer around 5 oclock, so it was still very bright outside. We were the
only ones there at the time. We were walking around for about a half an
hour looking at all the old tombstones. The church is in the middle of
the cemetery, mostly burnt down. When we walked through the church, on
our way to the right corner of the cemetery, we both suddenly got very
cold. Once we got to the right corner we both immediately stopped about
five feet from each other. At first, I heard steps coming from my left,
and Mike heard them from his right. We could tell it was steps and not
pine cones or twigs falling from trees because you could hear twigs cracking
on the ground. At the same time we looked at each other and we heard the
steps coming from both sides of us. The steps were corning us. We took
off in a mad dash for my car and left with a quickness.</B>

<P><B>Old Friends Trying to Help?</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mambocatz@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My husband and I had two very dear friends, Simon and David, who
died from AIDS in the mid-1990s, a year or so apart from one another.&nbsp;
They were partners.</B>
<BR><B>One night in the spring of 2002, just before bedtime, I was standing
at the kitchen sink, drinking a cup of water, looking out the window and
thinking about nothing in particular when I saw something yellow reflected
in the window, as though someone were standing behind me.</B>
<BR><B>When I turned around,&nbsp; there was my dear friend David, with
a happy expression on his face, leaning slightly forward, with his arms
stretched out as though he wanted to embrace me.&nbsp; He was wearing a
light yellow polo shirt and khaki pants.&nbsp; He looked solid at the top,
but was very indistinct below the knees.</B>
<BR><B>Although this apparition was not fearsome -- after all, it was my
friend -- it startled me terribly, causing me to yelp loudly.&nbsp; As
soon as I made a sound, David vanished, and I found that I had somehow
landed on the floor on my butt.&nbsp; My eyeglasses and the cup landed
on the other side of the room.</B>
<BR><B>Realizing what I had seen, I immediately felt terrible for scaring
off the ghost of my friend.</B>
<BR><B>I felt tears come to my eyes, and I called out, "Come back, David,
you just scared me, don't go away!"&nbsp; But of course he did not return.</B>
<BR><B>My husband raced into the room when he heard all this, and I told
him what happened.</B>
<BR><B>Just a few days later, my husband had a stroke at the age of only
48.&nbsp; He was hospitalized for a month, then recovered enough to drive
a car and go about a fairly normal routine within a few months.&nbsp; Our
lives returned pretty much to normal.</B>
<BR><B>That December, I came home from work after dark one day.&nbsp; When
I got out of my car, I saw something out of the corner of my eye.&nbsp;
This time it was Simon, standing behind a small bush against the wall of
our house, wearing a blue shirt, and smiling.&nbsp; He was in the circle
of light cast by the porchlight and I definitely recognized that it was
Simon.&nbsp; I looked at him for a couple of seconds, not believing what
I was seeing.&nbsp; I said, softly, "Simon?"&nbsp; He vanished.</B>
<BR><B>After I gathered my wits,&nbsp; I looked behind the bush, and no
one was there.&nbsp; It had been drizzling all day, so the soil was wet
but it was smooth and undisturbed.&nbsp; No living person had stood there.</B>
<BR><B>A few days later, my husband had a second stroke, worse than the
first one, and he is still recovering.</B>
<BR><B>I often think our dead friends were trying to communicate with me
prior to these events.&nbsp; Perhaps they wanted to warn me that a health
danger was imminent.&nbsp; Or perhaps they just appeared to say, "you'll
be going through a tough time, and we are here if you need us."</B>
<BR><B>I don't know, and I can't explain it.</B>

<BR><B>My Mothers Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Sublime042056@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>Hello, I am a big fan of your site....I always read the stories
posted on your web site and find them very interesting. Well any ways I
never really could say that I've experianced a ghost first hand (that i
know of), but my mother on the other hand has. Today after I got home from
school (I am 16 and a sophmore in high school) I was talking to my mother
and she told me that she had the weirdest dream, that she had "found" her
parents in Sprindfield Ma. that is 2 towns away from Ware (where we live,
and mind you that my gramma had been dead since before i was born and my
grampa died when I was about 3 or 4) . She said that she went in the house
and he was sitting in a chair just talking to her like he did on any given
day (well when he was alive) and she noticed that his body was in rough
shape like his arms were boney and long and just looked really frail and
skinney, not like he used to be, and he looked as if he was all withered
like that of an old man, but his face looked young like in his middle 20s.
Then after "visiting" with her father she "found" her mother and saw her
sillowet in the window. She went in and told her that she looked great
(she said she looked young and in good health). After talking to her for
a while my mom said that she found her dad across town and that she wanted
to bring him over but my gramma said no, i dont want to see him right now.
My mother said it was just like when they were alive when she was mad at
him she would say that. Well now to the freakey part. When I got home from
my boyfriends house like an hour ago(I got home at 7:30pm) my mother came
up to me and said that when she was sitting here on the computer my uncle
came up stairs (my mom and uncle inhearted the house we live in from their
parents and they divided it so my uncle and aunt live downstairs and my
family lives up stairs) and my mom started to tell him about her dream
then all the sudden the take out menues that are ontop of my fathers gun
cabinet were whipped across the room and scattered every where, then my
mom heard a crash in the living room and the computer rebooted by itself.
When my mom went into the living room to see what fell, it was an old portrate
of 2 children in a field with a black cat that my grampa bought her before
he passed away. Sorry this was so long and thank you for your time.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Experiences at the Family Farm</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: dragynnblayde@yahoo.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>This is an expereince that happened to me about 5 years ago.&nbsp;
I'm what some people would call a " sensor" you know that people who can
either feel or sense presences.&nbsp; I have I have been like this since
I was young.&nbsp; Well I never felt or sensed anything like this before
so here is my true account of a hostile presence............</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was about 5 years ago in Durbin, WVa which
is in Pocahontas County.&nbsp; Me and my mom were going to a farm (which
has been in our family for about 100 years) to pack up some furnishings
and such for storage back home.&nbsp; Well anyway when we pulled up to
the side of the road to park as soon as I got out of my car I "felt" something
was very strange but I couldn't quite put my finger on it.&nbsp; So I told
my mom and she told me not to worry about it that nothings wrong.&nbsp;
So we made out way to the front porch area and I could feel yet again that
someone or something was watching us from inside and whatever it was making
me uneasy.&nbsp; So we went into the house and the first room as you go
in is the living room and to the right is a bedroom.&nbsp; So my mom had
me start pack some things up and stack them up in the living room area
as she was going to go through the dining area ( which is off the living
room area) and into the kitchen to pack some things up also.&nbsp; As I
was packing and ll I thought she passed right behind me and into the other
bedroom that is off the dining room area.&nbsp; I then went into that room
and she was not there but still in the kitchen.&nbsp; So I went back to
my businees of packing blankets and the like up in the living room is when
I "felt" eyes upon me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't quite figure out where though
it was like all around the room and then it just stopped.&nbsp; But what
I felt was hostile.&nbsp; So I went back doing my thing minding my business
and then it came back but made itself more known to me and how it did was
when I was bent down to pick up a box I felt this presence circuling around
me like it was walking circles around watching me menacingly.&nbsp; I looked
up but couldnt see anything but I knew it was there and I asked " who are
you what do you want" as soon as I said that it vanished yet again.&nbsp;
I knew at this point whatever this presence was or who it was toying with
me.&nbsp; So yet again I went back to doing my thing and this is when it
got a little scary as I was doing my thing I stood back up and as soon
as I done that the presence made itself known again but this time it was
more intense and right behind me like it was breathing down my neck.&nbsp;
Something in my mind told me not to turn and look what was there so I didn't
but whatever it was I remember to this day I felt it scream out in my mind
" GET OUT AND GET OUT NOW!!".&nbsp; I dropped everything right then and
there and went out the door literally running.&nbsp; The feeling was so
intense that it actually gave me a extremely bad migraine headache.&nbsp;
My mom heard the commotion&nbsp; and came out to see what happened and
I told her what went on so she locked up and she ended up driving home
because I was unable too because I fell ill.&nbsp; I have not been back
inside the farmhouse since that day.&nbsp; Yes I have went over with either
my mom or dad but I will not step foot in the house because I can still
sense that presence there and well quite personally I dont thin it likes
me a whole lot either and to this day I feel that it made me fall ill that
day whatever it was or is.</B>
<BR><B>If any questions about my account feel free to email me at dragynnblayde@yahoo.com
. I have other experiences I can tell but this one sticks out the most.</B>

<BR><B>Grandpa's House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jmhredzak@alltel.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>When i was visiting my grandpa's house,&nbsp; we were watching tv
after we had supper.My dad was telling facts&nbsp; bout his brother and
how "smart" he was. When in the back room we heard a big BOOM! We all jumped.My
dad asked wat that was.No one knew. So my grandpa when to the back room
where the boom was and there was his wife sitting on the bed with the broken
tv.My grandpa's wife died 2 years ago in a car accident. My grandpa rubbed
his eyes but then she was gone and the tv was broken. My grandpa told us
about what he saw i didnt believe him cuz he sometimes makes things up.
Well anyway 1 year later that vision happened but this time it was outside.
My grandpa paused for a moment then she vanished. I knew thsi couldn't
be true. But it was on my 10 b-day {march 2nd} my mom made a cake for us.We
only have 5 people in my family my brother was in college.When my mom cut
the first piece for me i saw my grandma outside on the back porch smiling
at me on my b-day for the first time.I was surprised to see her i didnt
scream or point i just stood staring straight back at her. She dissapeared.
And that was the last time i ever saw her since. This may sound fake and
un realible but it was true.</B><B></B>

<P><B>White Thing</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Shafer740@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello i am writing you in concerns to something i seen when i was
around 11or 12 im not positive on my age actually this story begins long
before this with my sister and as recently as last summer.Let me start
at the beginning and see if i can tell this to where it makes some kind
of sense.</B>
<BR><B>We live in ohio (Lawrence County) we grew up in the country up a
hollow ,now that we are grown we still live in this hollow.most of our
family on both sides live in this hollow,my dads family has lived in this
hollow for years and years back,and he was born and raised in the hollow
the same as me &amp; my sister.so needless to say there have been many
ghost and haunted tales past down through the years.</B>
<BR><B>As kids my dad and hes brother and sister played in the woods constantly.</B>
<BR><B>As kids my dad would take me and my sister and mom for walks in
the woods and show us things and stories that went with them,He showed
us several times the old cemetary thats back on the hill it was hard to
even tell that that was what it used to be its so old there only about
maybe 5 graves and most of the stones are missing there is maybe one left
and it is cracked and fell over on the ground any how that was always something
we as kids would discusss this old graveyard,wich by the way there were
stories that we all had heard that one of the graves had been dug up a
long long time ago no one knows who done it but it was told the man that
was buried there had money and it was rumored that back in those days sometimes
they buried there jewels or money with them .</B>
<BR><B>any how a long time ago i was maybe 4 or 5 then not sure and my
sister who is 4 years older went with 2 of our aunts for a walk it was
a bright summer day,and we ended up close to the old cemetary ,my aunts
asked my sister if she knew where it was cause they had always heard of
it and wanted to see it. She said sure we are close to it ,she explained
dad had took us there several times ,shed then said stay right here and
ill find it ,So she walked away not far just had barely got out of sight
and then she came back running and screaming get out of here get done to
the road</B>
<BR><B>my aunts start&nbsp; yelling whats wrong with you, what happened
shes still screaming get of the hill get to the road i saw something up
by the cemetary on the rocks its white looks like it can hardly get around
like its old but it took of over the rocks almost like its floating its
horrible how it moves and i dont know where its at it like it has disapeared
it could still be here somewhere,shes explaining all this while we are
all running as fast as we can of the hill to the road,mind you the road
is in the hollow it dirt and no houses around .</B>
<BR><B>alright so years go by everyone pretty well had forgot about the
incident,i was young when it happened so i pretty much went on with playing
and forgot about it mostly i guess and then everyone else just figured
my sister had saw some kind of an animal or something i guess cause she
was a kid when she saw it.So it was just kinda forgotten about</B>
<BR><B>But then about 5 to 6 years later when i was about 11 12 13 like
i said not for sure on&nbsp; my age but it was close to my sisters age
when she saw it ,me and my cousin where walking in the woods aproximatly
the same place my sister was on a bright sunny day in the summer just talking
and getting closer to the old cemetary when i happend to glance up on the
hill,and there it was standing there watching us,i have no idea how long
this thing had been there or if it had just appeared,it was white looked
kinda like matted long white ,silver hair every where it seemed to stand
almost upright like a person,it then looked like it was moving away from
us its movement was almost as horrible as its sight it moved like and old
bent over person almost like it couldnt get around like hobbled or and
old shaky person bent over using a can ofcourse there was no can but it
moved horrible,but it was gone quick or it just disapeared.all of this
happened within seconds ,just a glance but it was so frightening that i
turned pale white and just about passed out i went totally blank heres
the crazy part my cousing walking beside me never saw this thing but she
remembers this walk to this day ,she says she well never forget the way
i just stopped dead in my tracks stopped talking to her and went white
and blank she swears i about passed out ,she had to shake me to get me
to come to my senses ,and ofcourse she had no idea what was going on and
that scared her ,when i finally came out of it with her shaking me i told
her i saw something get off of this hill now we ran all the way home ,and
when we busted in the house out of breath i started telling mom and dad
and my sister what had just happend and to my suprise my sister started
finishing&nbsp; my sentences before i did,and then she said do you rememeber
a long time ago when we took a walk and i came back running that is exactly
what&nbsp; i saw.</B>
<BR><B>So thats when we named it the white thing.</B>
<BR><B>Ok so years go by no other siteings nothing,untill last summer my
mom calls and puts my nephew on the phone and says let him tell you what
he says happened to him and my neice his sister the other day so i ask
him what happened to them and he starts by saying&nbsp; me and sissy took
the dog for a walk back on the hill keep in mind they live in the hollow
still to.he sayed they had stopped to take a rest when they saw somthing
standing watching them white matted hair kinda like a person but kinda
not they said the dog was laying on the ground and this thing seem to walk
right over the dog the dog never moved or barked like it didnt even know
it was there.they said the way it moved was weird and it took of up the
hill&nbsp; fast and seemed to dissapear,then for some un godly reason my
neice decides to scream at it and tell it to come back? then they say they
never saw it again but they could hear it and see and hear trees branches
snapping coming back down the hill after them they say they took of running
home my nephew swears he thought he could feel something breathing down
hes neck,they told this story they had never heard the story of me and
their mothers and they were never told anything untill they told their
story ,they hit a lot of facts perfectly so now me and my sister are convinced
they have seen the same thing they where about the same ages we were it
was summer also but they were not in the spot where we saw it but they
were in the hollow in the woods.</B>
<BR><B>After the kids encounter it got us all talking and stirred up about
this white thing again.</B>
<BR><B>one day one of my freinds was here and i had been telling her this
whole story how my sister had seen this years ago and then i to had seen
it years later and now her kids have seen it years later,and she says wait
till my husband gets here i want him</B>
<BR><B>to tell you a story of what he says he saw when he was a kid in
the woods,So when he shows up she says tell her the story of the old wild
women ,he acted embarassed and asked why and she said just tell her ,now
keep in mind once again like with the kids i just let him tell the story
before i ever mentioned anything.now he was not raised up in this hollow
but not far away just over the hill where all the woods run together.He
starts of by saying when we were kids we played in the woods all the time
and we could play in the same spot for hours and never see a thing and
then the next thing we would know their it would stand ,as if it had been
watching us the whole time im not sure what it was we didnt stick around
long after we seen it but it appeared to be standing upright like a person
maybe a little slumped over it was white matted hair looked like an old
woman with ratty hair about down to her but,and and old mangled dress in
shreds white,he says they were not the only kids to see this in the woods
they named it wild women like we had named it the white thing&nbsp; he
also went on to tell that he sister who at the time was a teenager saw
it once,he says he and his borthers who were little was out&nbsp; playing
in the yard their was hill behind them woods and a big rock cliff his teenage
sister was out on the porch sweeping it and starting screaming at the kids
and mad them get in the house and she locked them in the house and said
she had seen the most horrible thing beent over the rock cliff looking
down at the kinds watching them play</B>
<BR><B>i LOOked at him in disbeleif it seems they had seen it to when they
were kids</B>
<BR><B>So know im wondering what is it ,why does it seem to like to watch
kids,at first i thought it had something to do with the cemetary because
thats where me and my sister saw it then after the kids saw it but not
in that spot i thought maybe it has something to do with our family being
it was my sister me and her kids that had seen it .but then with my friends
story im thinking maybe it has something to with kids i just dont know.My
dad played in this woods alot more then we did and he never saw</B>
<BR><B>anything? one more fact everyone that has seen this does not remember
a face,but we seem to be in agreement that it is not an animal of anykind
more like a person or something maybe a ghost the only thing that we do
know is the instant you see it it there is something so wrong and no right
about it that it chills you to the bone and scares the hell out of&nbsp;
you and cant be explained ,if it wanted to hurt any of us im sure it could
of&nbsp; but that doesnt seem to be the deal.</B>
<BR><B>there are so many old story of things that went on in this hollow&nbsp;
that it make you wonder .we know indians lived in this hollow there are
old idian wash basins ,that carved out still in the woods ,there are stories
of hangings ,and a story of a man shooting himself years ago at the head
of the hollow not to mention and old cemetary that the grave has been dug
up so i just dont know</B>
<BR><B>so if you have heard of any similar stories like this or have any
ideas pleas let me know</B><B></B>

<P><B>What Happened to Me</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ghlbeyerlein@verizon.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>the house I grew up in was ~130 years old and was on the Gettysburg
march line for the Union Forces. Many-a wounded were treated around the
old Grist Mill that "our" farm house was built near. Some of the things
I've heard at night, the shimmering that I've seen at night &amp; daylight,
the piles of dead flies in the window sill, and the scampering noises in
the attic. Some can be attributed to natural noises: birds, squirrels,
sun / cloud / tree and the lighting change effect on the house, etc.</B>
<BR><B>Used to have a little boy in a white "sun suit" who would look out
our attic window at us when we were playing. I'd see him looking in on
my room and my sister's room every now and again. His sister would also
visit, especially whenever my parents had a really big fight.</B>
<BR><B>My mom saw the original farmer and his wife outside the window one
day. Confirmed it with photos on file - "yep, that's them".</B>
<BR><B>One day when I was at College, my stereo turned on by itself. I
had it set so that it was not on stand-by and none of the input selectors
were selected - if it would have turned on, it would not have played anything.
It turned on and was playing on of the CDs that I had left in the CD player.</B>
<BR><B>On of my mom's friends from the local College was very much into
the Occult (think Voodoo, but not evil). She swore that she saw Death standing
by my window one day - middle of summer; the rest of the day, my room felt
like a Refrigerator.</B>
<BR><B>Chairs and tables and pictures would always be in slightly different
places. Doors would slam shut every once in a while.</B>
<BR><B>In the farm house that my mom grew up in (back in Indiana), there
was a room that no one (4 kids nor her parents) would go into. It was always
locked. According to her parents, someone was killed in that room - never
"felt" right afterward - always cold by that door.</B>
<BR><B>If ever you've seen the movie "The Haunting" based on a true story
during the 1970s (I think in PA). There is a scene where the ghost follows
the family on their "picnic" to get away from their haunted house. In that
scene, there is a black "blob" hovering in the air in front of the daughter
and then the rest of the family. Something similar to that would come out
of the attic into our rooms - talk about cold and tingly and scary as F***!</B>
<BR><B>One day we found 5 dead mice in the one trash can by the garage
- probably put there by someone playing a joke - but freaked my mom out
something fierce. They were put down in the five points of a star and circle
- pentagram (not a Pentacle).</B>
<BR><B>Most of my friends were a bit spooked to come out for long, especially
after dark. They heard things, didn't see things very often. One of my
friends did though, she welcomed the experience - wanted the chance to
connect with her dead grandfather.</B>
<BR><B>One of the weirdest things to ever happen to me though was when
my girl friend (now wife) and I were in college. We were watching American
Gothic in her room. I was holding her hand and all of a sudden her hand
felt much bigger and rougher - just like I remembered my grandfather's
hand feeling when I was kid before he passed away (I was ~4 or 5 when he
died; used to ride his farm tractor with him and "help" him with chores).
Freaked me out a bit - still get tingles from that one.</B>
<BR><B>There was a "town-house" on campus that was supposedly haunted.
The doors would open on their own. Things would fall off shelves. It was
an end unit, yet you could hear people stomping up and down the stairs
(no one was on the stairs and no one was on the stairs on the other side
of the town house).</B>
<BR><B>There was also a path down by the "log cabin" on campus that no
one would walk down at night. Granted, the campus is on a mountain w/~650
acres of mountain woods and associated wildlife, but there weren't many
of us who handed heard wildlife rummaging around at night - this didn't
sound like that. You could almost feel "it" - you ever get the feeling
like there's a blanket or towel about to be thrown on you or someone watching
you - that's how it felt down that path - twuz always colder and windier
on that path than the others, even those that connected with it or ran
parallel.</B>
<BR><B>One thing I won't forget, I had just turned 16 and had a hellaciously
bad staph infection in my left leg (still have the scar). Had a 105+ degree
fever. Granted, the Doctors were 100% sure that I was delirious - @ 260+
and 105+ degree fever, they were wondering how I lived. However, I saw
Death sitting by my bed. Pointed at me and said "not yet", got up and left.</B>
<BR><B>Those are my ghost stories. Think of you what you will, but as best
I know they are real. "Any recordings or pictures?" No. No proof as such.
Just what I saw and heard and felt - could be that I dreamed all of it;
could be that it was a really bad trip, bender or relapse. Could be a lot
of things, but at the time they all seemed real - still do seem real when
I think back on them.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Try and Forget It</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:MEL@corporatedirtbag.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>i don't know how to explain everything i ever see, i don't even bother
to question it..simply because the thought gives me the chills.. one moment
in time i remember in relation to actually seeing something unexplainable
was the figure on my boat.. my family and i used to take these boat trips
out to conneticuit, my dad loved my boat, and before he bought his new
car, the boat was his favorite toy.. after a while money problems arose,
as well as marital problems, and my father didn't have the heart or the
money to renew our slip, so he set our boat on bricks in the backyard,
and left it there.. a summer or two ago we held a couple sleep overs..
one in particular we decided to hold on the boat since that was the only
sleepover spot in convenience.. it was a little chilly outside, but nice..
after a night of movies, reminiscing, story telling and games everyone
completely passed out, except for me, of course.. maybe around 3 or 4 o'clock
i began to fall into slumber..a couple hours before that my sister who
slept beside me left to go sleep inside, she was uncomfortable..now, as
i was beginning to fall asleep i turn on my side to the spot that is supposed
to be vacant, under the blanket i saw a curled up sleeping body..only a
couple inches apart from mine.. at first i thought nothing of it, then
i realized my sister went inside and i had been awake so i know nobody
crept beside me to take my sisters spot in the first place, the room was
too cramped as it was, i would have seen or heard them..staring at this
figure thoughts were flying through my head, who this could be, how they
just appeared beside me, i anybody was really there..i was too afraid to
touch it though if i had moved my arm just ever so slightly my hand would
have brushed up right against it.. i was too scared to move, to afraid
to make a sound, i didn't even want to breathe.. i closed my eyes and forced
myself to find a way to fall asleep, convincing myself that my sister had
come back and i just didn't notice..i awoke in the morning, the only one
awake.. it was only about 6 or 7 am.. but reasonably light out, i looked
to my side and there was no blanket and no person..later on i asked everyone
if anyone slept beside me that night, and they all said no..they all told
me they were out cold all night..i still don't know what to make of it,
it's just one of those things you have to let go and try to forget..</B><B></B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;The Picture</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:Jhredzak@alltel.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Well this may sound weird but it happened. One day we were at my
friends house in her basment {jordan's} we were all talking about things
that we like at school. Well after a while jordan's cat came down to join
us. Chloe {my other friend} said she was going to go play pool {jordan
has tons of cool things in her basement} Well anyway my other friend {alexa}
said she was going to play pool with chloe also.So they both left Jordan
said she was going to go online i went with her to the room. Its seperate
from the other rooms.&nbsp; Now in the main room in her basment where the
couches and the tv is my other 2 friends {Sammy and Becky} were still talking
bout school and other stuff.&nbsp; Well sammy was going to the bathroom
when all of a sudden the cat hissed not at her not at becky at nothing.well
Alexa told us that when cats hiss at nothing there are spirits in here
that you can't see but the cat can. We all didn't belive her thinking she
was trieng to scare us. But my one friend, Sammy started turing pale really
pale almost white when she sawl a ghost standing behind me staring at my
head. I asked her whats wrong? she said there was a tall red ghost standing
right behind me. I didn't turn around i belived her because i sawl the
shadow of the ghost from the light. I SCARED MY BUTT OFF!!!! it was so
scary jordan was in the other room still online. Alexa told me not to move
and dang i was even going to breath.&nbsp; this sounds fake but if this
happened to you you would know this was true. The man had dark brown eyes
with black circles around them like he was tired. And his was filled with
blood we all screamed and ran upstaris to her mom's room. we told her so
she got up and when we turned around he was there staring at Jordan the
me then sammy then Jordan's mom then alexia then Chloe but he didn't stare
at Becky. So the next morning we went to the local library and looked up
car accidents on the internet or murdering. We looked mostly all over the
place to find out what this guy's name was. Then under 1934 September 5
a guy named Charles Nelson was killed in a plane crash on the way to Idaho
to see his parents. They showed the list of all the people who died that
day and we clicked on Charles Nelson and they showed his picture and it
looked exactly like the ghost we sawl at jordan's house.we printed the
picture and showed her mom. She believed us since we went through all this
just to find one person. So that night we didn't have a sleep-over. We
decided we would keep the picture at my house. So i went to bed before
i was just bout to fall asleep i heard tearing paper i opened my eyes turned
on the lights and sawl that picture torn up into tons of pieces. Then with
no one in my room something opened my door and slammed it shut. I have
two dogs and they started barking in the kitchen. I was terrified so i
went back to sleep. In the morning when i went to get breakfeast my mom
holded up the picture and asked "is this yours?" i said yes i couldn't
believe it. It wasn't torn or anything. It was exactly the same before.
now this may sound fake once but im telling you this is true.&nbsp; Ever
since i didnt see anything else ever since neither did my friends</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Confederate Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: blue_angels9188@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was younger my family and I lived in a small house in Artemus,
Ky. There was an old lady who lived beside us named Opal Miracle. She was
a friend of the family and often came by to visit and bring us things.
One day, not long before we moved out of the house, she brought my mother
a jar of old buttons. She said that the buttons had came from her grandfathers
uniform. She told us he had been a soldier in the Confederate Army during
the civil war and the buttons had been keep as a family heirloom.</B>
<BR><B>So when we moved we took the buttons with us. Not long after the
move though strange things began happening in our new house. We began seeing
a man dressed in a gray uniform walking up and down the halls at night.
Gun shots and screams could also be heard coming from outside of the house.
Then one night, the most awful noise was coming from the upstairs attic.
Clothing, books, papers were all scattered around the room. The window
of the attic had been opened, as had many boxes and trunks that had been
sealed and locked only months before.</B>
<BR><B>At first we believed it to be the house, but everywhere we moved,
the story was the same. One day when we were cleaning out the closet, my
mother came across the jar of buttons. That's when it hit us that the buttons
were the cause of the hauntings, not the houses themselves. The next day,
we dropped the jar along with the buttons into the nearby river. We haven't
heard or seen a thing from the Confederate ghost since.</B>

<BR><B>Spirit Dwarfs</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: cprado@email.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Im from Sydney, Australia. I have a couple of weird stories but
I only have time for one.</B>
<BR><B>When I was around 1 years old (1985ish, Im 19 now), my parents
bought a new house in one of Sydneys brand new housing estates. The house
was located in a circuit-like street and on an up-hill incline with no
other houses in the back except for a swamp but there were houses infront
and on its left side. Anyway, when the house was being built my dad and
mum visited it one time at night and brought my brother and I along. Apparently,
my mum said dad placed me on top of some rocks on the houses land and
said this is your very first steps on our new home. A couple of days
later on a hot day in our apartment before moving into the new house, I
started having convulsions but the doctors and my parents could not find
a cause. The convulsions got worse when we moved into the new house.</B>
<BR><B>In the new house strange things started happening with my brother.
At night during the same time hed wake up and stand up on the bed pointing
down at the ground. Hed do this nearly every night my parents said. The
neighbourhood kids were also strange towards my brother. Theyd bully him
and vandalise things in our front yard. My parents didnt know why.</B>
<BR><B>After telling our relatives what was going on, my aunty referred
us to her mother who was a renowned spiritualist/faith healer/future-reader
back in the Philippines. After a couple of years later when I was 3 or
4 years old, we went to visit the Philippines and also went to see my auntys
mum about my excessive convulsions and my brothers strange dreams. She
said that the land the house was built on&nbsp; was Sacred Aboriginal land
and that there were spirits present. She also said that I had struck 3
small dwarf-like spirits with rocks when I was playing one time with my
brother in the yard and that had upset them so they made me sick. My brothers
dreams were also caused by those dwarf-like spirits which he was pointing
out at in the night. She gave my mum a remedy to do when we get back to
the house, which included some prayers and chicken offerings. Everyone
thought the remedy was weird and laughed about it, but my mum did it anyway.
Freakishly and luckily, I stopped having m</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;y convulsions and my brother didnt have his weird wake-up
calls at night anymore.</B>
<BR><B>We dont live in that house anymore, we moved out when I was about
5 years old, and weve never been back, not even to look at it.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: fms2001@earthlink.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Back around '92 or '93 in Sarasota, Fl., a young blonde womans</B>
<BR><B>decomposing body was found in a backyard pool. What was interesting
was</B>
<BR><B>that she was found stuffed inside a rubbermaid trash can in pieces.
The</B>
<BR><B>pool had been abandoned months earlier and was in the condition
of a</B>
<BR><B>pond with frogs and tree branches in it. The girl was found to have
two</B>
<BR><B>different caliber bullet holes and a fetus in her and had previously</B>
<BR><B>been buried for a while before being moved to the pool. The property</B>
<BR><B>owner was in prison when body discovered and nothing was ever proved</B>
<BR><B>although he knew victim. To this day in the summer you can hear
frogs in</B>
<BR><B>the pool although there are none. Next to last house on right, Gallup</B>

<BR><B>of a subsequent abduction/ murder near Sarasota Square Mall.</B>

<BR><B>THE OLD MAN OF THE SEA</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: sundog_279@optusnet.com.au</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>It was about the year 2000, in the midsummer.</B>
<BR><B>I was using drugs during this period, amphetamines and Heroin. I
was actually addicted to the heroin, I had been using it to cope with massive
pain as I tried to cope with three part time jobs and it had bitten me
(just some background)</B>
<BR><B>It was about 2am and I had decided to go fishing. I was planning
classes for a disabled art class as well as a program for the local neighbourhood
centre, working on a cartoon for a magazine and trying to plan the next
day so I could be in place to shoot their front cover when they were ready.
I needed a break from work.</B>
<BR><B>I drove to a beach near where I live now. North Entrance Peninsula.
The spot is on a spit of land that faces the sea on one side and a lake
on the other with the third side being the lakes inlet.</B>
<BR><B>It is virtually a sand dune with a small town down the middle. On
this night I was about 200 yards from the houses, on the beach, facing
a boiling storm swept ocean. The waves would come in and rip the beach
away taking about a yard wide by a few feet deep of the sand each time.</B>
<BR><B>There is a mighty fish called the mulloway that love these conditions
(so Im told) and grow up to sixty pounds and more. I wanted one or something
like it.</B>
<BR><B>It was a moonless night and that spot on the beach was hit by gusting
20 knot wind (speed?). Had one static rod about ten feet away and was holding
one. The beach deterioration was driving me back about ten yards every
few minutes so I was constantly shifting my gear and trying to keep ahead
of the waves.</B>
<BR><B>They were unforgiving waves that would not have let you go if you
were caught.</B>
<BR><B>In the middle of this I saw a man approaching, he walked along the
windswept beach towards my static rod so I shone the light of my tiny torch
onto the rod and let him see it. He walked up and stood about two yards
from me so I just kept fishing.</B>
<BR><B>He looked out to sea with his arms crossed for half an hour or so
and moved back as I did each time.</B>
<BR><B>Eventually I got tired and the wind was cutting into my clothes
so I pulled my little thermos, poured coffee into my only cup (the lid)
and offered it to him. He leant in towards me and asked, are you offering
me your drink in your only cup? I answered yes. And before you yourself
have had any? I said sure, that was only being polite. He smiled and leant
in closer, the good jewies(this is what those fish are called locally)
are out there. he said and pointed to the boiling ocean. I laughed and
nodded, yup, right out there.</B>
<BR><B>He said, No, you have to stand on that sandbank and cast outwards
he pointed to a faint silvery streak in the boiling ocean. Right about
there. he said. I smiled and looked at him to see if he was joking.</B>
<BR><B>It was his face that first made me think, but not till later. His
face looked like parchment and seemed to be stretched across his teeth
so each one was clearly outlined, his eyes seemed to disappear into the
shadows (remember this bit) and I never saw them at all. The colour of
his skin was yellowish and almost see through. Did he have hair or a hat?
It is in the file doc but no idea now.</B>
<BR><B>He wore breaches or pants that seemed badly made and were rimed
with salt. His old gumboots reminded me of the rubber over string type
we used to get when I was a kid as they were turned down at the top. There
was some reddish colour in his shirt so maybe it was flannelette. He seemed
about my height, (511) and was very thin and of upright stiff carriage.
He walked slowly and stiffly.</B>
<BR><B>He looked back and said, you have to be careful of who you talk
to on this beach son</B>
<BR><B>I looked to see if he was smiling but his face hadnt changed since
I met him.</B>
<BR><B>Yes, son, he said, there is at least one man on this beach who
is best avoided, he is very strange and dangerous one (unsure of exact
wording but close)</B>
<BR><B>I didnt worry about that, there are many oddballs in the world
and I have made a bit of a hobby of meeting them, they are after all, the
salt of life.</B>
<BR><B>I remember he had not drunk any of the coffee before he tossed it
to the sand. Imagine the wind is ripping into us and we had to get close
to talk. His voice was a creaky whisper. That was the second thing I later
noticed.</B>
<BR><B>He handed me back the little cup and&nbsp; said  you are all right
though, you have naught to fear, yare a good man and hell pass you bye</B>
<BR><B>I remember wondering how this person would know I was a good man.
And why I should worry if he passed me bye or not.</B>
<BR><B>He said he had to go before the tide changed and walked off up the
beach. And I went back to fishing for maybe ten minutes before my brain
suddenly worked and I yelled. shit!</B>
<BR><B>Here is why.</B>
<BR><B>It was absolute darkness, the sea spray and clouds even cancelled
the stars . I saw him from about twenty yards before I even had my torch
turned on. As soon as he passed the static rod, I turned the torch off.
And yet I could see him clearly. I had to turn the torch on each time we
moved and also when I reached for the thermos. The thermos wasnt even
visible as a blob of blackness.</B>
<BR><B>Each time he turned to talk, I could see his face clearly and even
the colour and fine detail of the skin.</B>
<BR><B>His voice was whispering and yet I heard him over crashing waves
and blustery wind. I had had to yell just to make sense in my own head
because it was so loud. His eyes were in deep shadow and yet no light.</B>
<BR><B>As I though about this I turned my little torch to a part of the
sand not yet destroyed by the gouging surf and where he had stepped as
he left. Instead of footprints it was empty. I thought maybe the wind but
it was moist sand. Something should have been there</B>
<BR><B>I was too chilled to stay any way, I really didnt have warm enough
clothes so I left.</B>
<BR><B>Later I remembered him pointing into that killing surf and telling
me that was where I should stand to get the best cast to the fish. He pointed
twenty yards or so into the surf and yet a few feet out into that water
and it would suck you out to sea with no hope of survival.</B>
<BR><B>His skin, yellowish, almost transparent and tight across his teeth
but most of all I saw him coming and going in total darkness. And by the
way, he had been standing by the static rod and when I went to move it
away, no marks. Nothing but bare wet sand.</B>
<BR><B>Ive got cold chills just talking about it but it was his fucking
eyes. I never even saw a glint of one and yet I saw his skin so clearly
in total darkness.</B>
<BR><B>Final analysis. He said a bit more than I have written. For instance
he was facing away from me and was a few feet away when he first said about
who was to be avoided on the beach, he said it a couple of times when I
did not seem to be impressed and there were more words to his attempt to
get me onto the sand bar. Many more. But this is the essence and as much
as I can be reasonably sure of.</B>
<BR><B>I have always felt guarded from really bad things (psychic) and
one of the things that came into my head at the time he spoke of avoiding
on the beach was that it was also OK because I had that kind of protection.
I dont know why that would come into my head before I recognised him but
I wont analyse anything here.</B>
<BR><B>That is all of that encounter and I make no analysis and say I have
no evidence of any other event linked to it. It was not drug-induced psychosis,
I have had enough experience to recognise when the mind starts running
its own reality to know that.</B>
<BR><B>So this is story two. Old Man of the Sea</B>

<P><B>Hi, my name is Nicole and I live right by Odd Fellows in Liberty,MO.
The rumor about Odd Fellows being an insane asylum is false. But is was
an orphanage which I find just as creepy, since some of children are buried
in the graveyard on the property. ive yet to experience any sightings but
I will contact you as soon as I do. I have heard so many rumors about Odd
Fellows, the insane asylum one is really common. I'm curious to know, when
did you go into Odd Fellows?&nbsp; Some of my neibors have told me stories
of&nbsp; hearing little girls talking late at night in their homes and
have experienced toys moving and floating during the night, probley the
orphans. I have heard stories of some of the cruel things that were done
to the orphans when they misbehaved such a tounge cutting and many other
weird things. There was an article in the KC star recently that talked
about the orphanage and the orphans who lived there. Liberty is a haunted
town all togeather it may seem all clean cut and nice on the outside but
the people who live here know, its any thing but that. there is probley
at least 16 haunted houses,buildings,ponds and land places that i can think
of off the top of my head. Liberty has many haunted areas, there is alot
of history behind this small town.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Mysterious Footsteps and a Shadow Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:Anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>Please put "anonymous" instead of using my e-mail address.&nbsp;
Thanks.</B>
<BR><B>I've had a few stories on your website so far (I forget what pages
they're</B>
<BR><B>on), and here are a couple more.</B>
<BR><B>The first one happened back around 91 or 92; I was visiting a friend
who, at</B>
<BR><B>the time, lived in Burtonsville, Maryland.&nbsp; One afternoon we
took her 3 kids</B>
<BR><B>to a park, which I believe was called Wheaton Park.&nbsp; We were
walking on a</B>
<BR><B>trail through the woods, when all of a sudden we heard footsteps
like</B>
<BR><B>someone crashing through the leaves towards us.&nbsp; We looked
around but</B>
<BR><B>couldn't see a thing.&nbsp; We kept on hearing it, and were wondering
what it</B>
<BR><B>was, maybe a deer or a large dog or something, but we still couldn't
see</B>
<BR><B>anything.&nbsp; One of the kids said, "Maybe it's a BEAR!" and we
all took off</B>
<BR><B>running, still hearing the crashing footsteps behind us.&nbsp; We
never did find</B>
<BR><B>out what it was.</B>
<BR><B>The other story I have happened just a few months ago.&nbsp; It
started out with</B>
<BR><B>a strange dream I was having; the only details I remember now is
getting</B>
<BR><B>some sort of ominous e-mail that said something about being "killed
by an</B>
<BR><B>accidental hurricane" and there was a picture of a guy who looked
somewhat</B>
<BR><B>like Kelsey Grammar, only he was dressed as a terrorist!&nbsp; The
next thing I</B>
<BR><B>know I was in my parents' kitchen dressed in this beautiful gown
that in</B>
<BR><B>real life I'd just bought for my 25th anniversary renewal of vows
ceremony.</B>
<BR><B>In the dream, I'm standing there and this scary looking guy comes
out of the</B>
<BR><B>living room holding a lit cigarette in front of him like he's going
to burn</B>
<BR><B>me with it.&nbsp; All of a sudden, he threw it at me, and it went
down the front</B>
<BR><B>of my dress!&nbsp; I got all frantic and was trying to get it out
and keep it</B>
<BR><B>from burning me and the dress, then I woke up.&nbsp; I saw a shadowy
form</B>
<BR><B>standing over me, which I thought was my husband, but then I heard
him</B>
<BR><B>snoring and realized he was asleep.&nbsp; This shadowy form straightened
up,</B>
<BR><B>backed away from me, looking straight at me, and then kind of faded
away.</B>
<BR><B>The wierd thing was he looked somewhat like the Kelsey Grammer guy
from my</B>
<BR><B>dream.</B>
<BR><B>I felt spooked, so I turned on the light, grabbed my bible, and
read Psalm</B>
<BR><B>121, and then didn't feel scared any more, just kind of fascinated.&nbsp;
I was</B>
<BR><B>wondering, was it just a hallucination (I sometimes see "things"
after</B>
<BR><B>waking up suddenly from a dream), or had I seen some sort of spirit?</B>
<BR><B>Whatever he was, I haven't seen him since!</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Uncles House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: JRBall@stewireless.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>First, let me give you the back story. I always wanted my uncle Bob
to be at my wedding. For some reason he seemed to be the most important
person I wanted there. I never had a day in mind until I started dreaming
about my wedding day. I just woke up one morning with the date in my mind.(I
have a habit of asking for help before I fall asleep. Thinking the answer
will come in my dreams.) The day came and Bob did show up. Exactly one
year later on the same day, the same time as my wedding my uncle Bob was
pronounced dead. That started it. My mom had bought her house from him.
And my husband and I eventually moved into it with her. My husband, John,
worked the midnight shift at work, and everynight after he would leave
for work I would wake up with the sound of a mans voice yelling HEY.&nbsp;
That happened for about a week, then it stopped. One night, it was a weekend,
we all got started talking about strange experiences that we have had in
the house. I dont know how the subject came to be but thats what we were
talking about. Getting bored with the subject we decided to take our kids
and go to bed. Shortly after falling asleep we both got woke up by what
felt like someone kicking the bed. We put it off as one of the kids crawling
in bed with us and rolled over and went back to sleep. I slept the restr
of the night. However, John got woke 2 more times in the middle of the
night by some one yelling his name. I should mention that when he told
me this he also said that he got up and searched the house and there was
no other man in the house much less awake. This happened several times
before we eventually moved back out.&nbsp; My mother moved out last year
and told me of some of her experiences, along with my 2 younger brothers.
Mind you, this is not first hand. As they were moving things out of the
house they had everything out expect what was left in the room my husband
and I used. They went up the stairs to get the bed and the door closed
behind them. That wasn't so bad the door had closed several times before,
but when they went to open it, it was stuck it would not budge. They went
to the window and yelled down at my mom to come help them but all she saw
or heard was them waving. They tried the door again and it opened without
any problems. As they were walking down the stairs they felt like some
one was shoveing them the entire way. They heard loud banging footsteps
on the stairs, even the bathroom light came on and the toilet flushed then
they saw the sink water running.. What turned my mom around from not believeing
to believeing in what we said was she was home alone one night sitting
at her computer in her bedroom and the lights went completely out she turned
around to see if anyone was there and all she told me was she saw a large
shadow standing in her bedroom door. As soon as she saw it the lights came
back on.&nbsp; I should mention she says she has also seen people with
knives running thru the house, eyes following her and the smell of smoke
when there is noone in the house that smokes.&nbsp; On a final note the
house is old and we don't know much about it. Bob only sold it to my mom
if she promised not to move out or to resale it. There was always an uneasy
feeling and that someone was watching you all the time. Since then we have
moved into different homes, and she says that still at times she feels
like someone is watching her but doesn't feel so uneasy about it. I however
moved completely out of state and sometimes feel like someone is watching
me but I also feel uneasy too. My uncle and I were close. He said he would
always watch out for me and be there for me when I needed help. I like
to think that he is the one I feel watching me. Please let me know what
you think. Even if you think it's all in my head. But I should say that
I am a healthy, happy person.</B>

<P><B>By: angeleyes20usus@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have a story that happened to me last year. My mom</B>
<BR><B>died from cancer. At the time she died, my son was</B>
<BR><B>almost 2 years old. Now, my mom really loved my baby.</B>
<BR><B>I think he was her favorite grandchild. A couple</B>
<BR><B>months after she died, my son was playing around in my</B>
<BR><B>room. I had a full lenghth mirror with a big picture</B>
<BR><B>hanging over it. And I had a nightstand over to the</B>
<BR><B>side. we were the only 2 people home and I was trying</B>
<BR><B>to cook supper. My son kept playing with the mirror</B>
<BR><B>and everytime he messed with it, he would knock that</B>
<BR><B>picture. I kept telling him to stop. But anyways, his</B>
<BR><B>dad came home and we all ate supper. Afterwards I went</B>
<BR><B>in my room. I noticed that the picture was gone off</B>
<BR><B>the wall. So I looked and it was sitting neatly behind</B>
<BR><B>the nightstand. Now if it would have fell, there's no</B>
<BR><B>possible way it could've landed behind that</B>
<BR><B>nightstand. ESPECIALLY not as neatly as it was</B>
<BR><B>sitting. At that moment, I knew my mom was still</B>
<BR><B>around watching after my baby. The weird thing about</B>
<BR><B>it is that the night of my mom's funeral, I was really</B>
<BR><B>upset and I kept asking God to please send me a sign</B>
<BR><B>that my mom was still around. I guess that was my sign!</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Dad's Demons</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: abernathy541@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I have written before about the same house, but I wanted to write
about some stuff that happened while my dad was dying.</B>
<BR><B>My dad was an alcoholic and for the last 6 months of his life was
very out of it. His liver stopped functioning and so the toxins (he continued
to drink until a couple of days before he died) in his body were basically
pickling his brain. Now I believe that my dad had a lot of demons and all
through this time period he was dealing with them. He would sit in bed
for hours and talk to "a little boy" who sat in the corner of the room.
Now we just thought my dad was hallucinating so we got creeped out but
tried to remember what was happening. Well, that all changed one morning
when my sister and I were getting around for school. The bathroom was right
next to my parents bedroom, and we were standing in the bathroom getting
around for school, my mom was gone at work, and we were fixing our hair.
My dad called out and said" What time is it?"&nbsp; I called back and "
7:30 dad". Well, a few moments my sister and I heard my dad say" What time
did she say it was?" well we knew he was just talking to "whoever" and
ignored it, then as clear as day we heard a small rather soft voice say"
they said 7:30". My sister and I looked at each other and almost screamed,
it was such an eerie feeling and then we heard my dad reply "oh." WE went
running out of the house telling my dad bye that we were leaving early
for school.</B>
<BR><B>A lot of other stuff happened too. My dad had several people he
talked to, there was an old man who sat on the dresser and he also said
he would see shadowy black figures running around the bed. In fact one
night he slept on the couch because he said they bothered him so bad. He
would also sit in bed and scream and yell at people and tell them to stop
talking to him.</B>
<BR><B>My bedroom was right across from theirs and some nights I would
go sleep in my sisters room because my dad was so scary and loud. One night
my friend spent the night and she woke me up at like am because my dad
was just yelling and telling everyone to leave, well I got mad and told
my friend that I had had enough and asked her if she would start praying
with me, so we did. We prayed and asked God to protect us and keep us safe
while we dealt with whatever. So after we had prayed we stared saying "Go
away Satan and leave my dad alone, he might have demons but that they were
not allowed in this home. We did this for over an hour when suddenly we
realized that all was quite. now this had not happened since my dad had
become really sick. He usually screamed all night and then slept during
the day. I got the courage to go in and make sure he was still alive. He
was sound asleep and he looked so peaceful. He said the next day that he
felt really good because everyone in his room finally left.</B>
<BR><B>Well, a few weeks later it all stared back up and he said the little
boy would hide under the bed and shake it and that he was seeing more and
more things and that some people would come and show him scary images and
he was starting to get scared. Well, it was during this time that one night
I was asleep in my room, now I always kept the door shut and so it was
very dark but I did keep one a night lite (I know but when things like
that happen you can get scared) for when some nights were really bad. Well,
it was one of these nights that I had a night light on and I woke up sometime
around am or so looked toward my door and next to my dresser I saw I dark
shadowy figure and I felt so much hate and evil. I stared to get scared
but I continued to stare at it, it didn't move but I felt it there in my
room. I was scared, but then that turned into anger and I yelled out loud
"GO AWAY" YOU have no power here." I told it that I was protected by Jesus
and that it had to go away. I suddenly felt no fear and felt as though
everything was very peaceful. The figure went away and I went back to sleep
and didn't have a problem again.</B>
<BR><B>It was after all this that my dad was taken to the hospital, my
mom stayed with him the whole time and finally my dad came to know God,
he finally was at peace and didn't have anymore visits from any more "people".
Now while my dad was gone we went through our house and prayed and we spent
a lot of time in the bed room. When my dad came back he was sent with a
hospice nurse and we were basically just getting him comfy and getting
him ready to die. He didn't have any more hallucinations after that, and
a couple hours before he died I went into his bedroom to be with him, at
this point he was basically comatose, to say good bye to him, and he was
kind of leaning up in bed staring up at the ceiling and smiling he had
a look of pure joy on his face. Now he had not moved in days and he had
not opened his eyes for days so this was a real shock, he didn't respond
when I said "Dad" so I went and got my mom. Well, he was back to be basically
comatose when everyone got there. It made my feel better because I feel
like he was looking at heaven or something. I told him I loved him and
then my sister who had been away for a few weeks for a school trip called
and said she would be home later that evening and that she loved him. Well,
my dad never made it and he died an hour after she called.</B>
<BR><B>It was sad but I know he is in a better place now. After all this
my mom lived in the house for another three years some weird stuff happened
every once in a while but not like before but then it was sold and now
we are all sharing an apartment, well the other day something happened
that made me feel really good, I was giving my son a bath and he was like
12 or 13 months and he looked up at the ceiling and was smiling and laughing
and then he said as clear as a bell "Michael" that was my dad's name.</B>
<BR><B>He has never said it again and there is no one else we know named
Michael. It gave me a good feeling to think that maybe God was letting
my dad catch a glimpse of the grandson he missed out on.</B>
<BR><B>THankyou for letting me tell you this story, I know it is not about
ghosts but what happened was really weird. I know lots of people ask how
they can deal with these entities this is how we dealt with it and it seems
to be pretty effective</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mellswor@sfwmd.gov</B><B></B>

<P><B>One year ago today, February 13, 2003, my fiance passed away from
a</B>
<BR><B>brain tumor. Although he is not here in a physical sense, he remains
in</B>
<BR><B>the spritual sense. Caressing me as I sleep, making the children
feel</B>
<BR><B>safe when alone, speaking to us "mentally" when we are worried or
trying</B>
<BR><B>to make difficult decisions. At first it was eerie, the feeling
that I</B>
<BR><B>could turn around and he would be standing there, but I have gotten
used</B>
<BR><B>to it and although I wish he would move on to his rightful place,
Heaven</B>
<BR><B>I am sure, I like having him here. I guess this e-mail is really
for</B>
<BR><B>those of you who are frightened and don't understand why you are
being</B>
<BR><B>"haunted". In the case of my children and myself we do not see it
that</B>
<BR><B>way at all, we see it as being guarded and protected. A responsibility</B>
<BR><B>my fiance took on gladly in life and, considering the fact that
hes</B>

<P><B>Little Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp; julie_scott@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi.. my name is scott. I just want to tell a story about an experience
my uncle,grandmother,and my mother ended up having at my grandparents current
house.</B>
<BR><B>I was just one at the time and my brother (ken) was about three.
My uncle,grandmother, and my mom were in the den of my grandparents place
when they heard my brother comming down the stairs. My brother was crying,
and started to call out, "Mommy I'm sick." So my mom told ken to go up
the stairs and she'll follow. Then he said it again,</B>
<BR><B>"Mommy I'm sick," and again my mom said ok, and started to get out
of her chair when he said "I'm going to throw up." and then he ran up the
stairs to the bathroom and slammed the door.</B>
<BR><B>My mom ran up the stairs to take care of him, and when she got to
the bathroom he wasn't there. She looked at all the rooms and noticed that
they were all locked.She then realized that there was no way for ken to
unlock the doors since all five doors had hooks as locks, and being three
he could't reach them.</B>
<BR><B>There was no way ken could of ran down the stairs since there was
only one set to up and down.My uncel searched all the rooms including the
attic and there was no sign of him.</B>
<BR><B>So as my mom, grandmother and uncel returned to the den to understand
what had happen about ten minutes later my grandfarther comes in the house
from a mile walk with me and ken.</B>
<BR><B>They realized that there was no way ken could of been in the house...since
he was with my grandfater.</B>
<BR><B>The reason why I belive this story is becaue, my grandmother, uncle
and mother told me about this haunting at different times of my life and
all three matched word for word...</B>
<BR><B>Hope you like my little story..</B><B></B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My mother, two of my brothers and I have always had experiences with
the supernatural. The most recent being last night.</B>
<BR><B>When I went to visit my mothre today my son nugded her to tell me
what happened last night and even though it's nothing new for her, it gave
me chills.</B>
<BR><B>My mom is 69 years old. She is a devout catholic. She was lying
in bed when she felt someone settle in the bed beside her. since my 9 year
old nephew sometimes crawls into bed with her, she thought it was him and
moved her hand in order to feel him, the body she felt was much bigger
and feminine so she turned to see who it was since no one like that lives
with her, it's only her my brother and his son(my nephew).</B>
<BR><B>She said it was a girl about 17 or 18&nbsp; of light complexion.
She asked the girl what she wanted and my mom got very heavy and the girl
answered but in a strage language (my mom said it was in tounges). She
then began to pray and admonished the girl and she disappeared and my mom
felt like herself again.</B>

<BR><B>Knock Knock</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: cprado@email.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This was back when I was 6 years old. My had grandfather passed away
and after the burial the family had a gathering at my auntys house where
my grandfather and grandmother lived for about a year. During that gathering
there was a loud banging on the front door, so naturally my parents and
relatives went to see who it was through the front window, but no one was
there. Everyone just dismissed it for the wind and went back to talking
and eating. But then there it was again, the loud banging as if someone
wanted be inside the house. Everyone in the house got really scared and
my auntys and uncles began scaring my grandmother saying that ooo, dads
come back for you already ma, but I remember my mum being really skeptical
so we just kept sitting in the lounge room near the front door. But again
the knocking became even more apparent and then everyone even my mum ran
to the kitchen where everyone else was. I cant remember but I think the
door knocking only happened on that d</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;ay.</B>
<BR><B>One year later, my healthy grandmother died so suddenly after strangely
having an anuerism. The weird thing was that before she died she apparently
heard noises and people, coming from upstairs of her and her sons TOP
floor unit. I dont know what it meant, maybe it was a sign that she was
going to pass or something.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;Grandmother's Haunted House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: vols919@earthlink.net</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>I just wanted to tell some stories that have happened in my mammaw's
house.There are many different ones so i'll start at the beginning.Once
my sisters were spending the night there and it was just them and my grandmother
there.My grandmother was in her bedroom and my sisters were on the couch
in the living room which is right below the most haunted place of the house.My
oldest sister kim woke up first hearing something walking back and forth
in the above room.So she woke up Jessi(My other sister) and asked if she
heard it and she did. That was just the beginning.</B>
<BR><B>Most of the time in my family when someone gets married like a cousin
or my aunts the couple would stay upstairs at my mammaw's house until they
could get their own place. I have heard many stories like once my aunt
was upstairs with her husband and she said something sat on her legs.My
uncle told about an alarm clock that kept going off even after he threw
it outside breaking it.That same uncle told me about a time when he was
sitting in the living room reading the newspaper and he put it down getting
ready to get up but it was like something was sitting on top of him not
allowing him to move. Then my cousin Lori was asleep with her husband upstairs
and she woke up and saw a very tall figure in the doorway which disappeared
after she had seen it. My step grandfather was actually asleep once and
he swears that something pulled him out of bed giving him a wedgie which
i actually think is hilarious. Then as i said before my oldest sister kim
was now 23 and she married and she and her husband were living upstairs
in my mammaw's house and she said that she was the only one there and she
heard the screen door slam shut. Then she heard someone call her name right
afterwards. She yelled downstairs cause she thought it was one of us and
asked what we wanted. Well no one answered so she finally went downstairs
and checked it out but no one was down there so she immediately got her
keys and ran to her car riding up the road to our house but mom told her
that she hadnt been up there...scary! my mom has been there countless times
alone usually sewing or something and she said that she hears things walk
up and down the stairs and the doors slam open and shut. But she says if
you just leave it alone and carry on with what you were doing it will stop.So
thats most of it...i just hope that whatevers up there is something friendly.</B>

<BR><B>Girl in the Sleeping Bag</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: e.rogers@adm.leeds.ac.uk</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello here's my encounter</B>
<BR><B>About four years ago (autumn 2000). I was living in a shared student
house, there was four of us in the house three being original housemates
and I moved in when one of our friends dropped out of Uni. It became apparent
that my room was the focus for some spirit as my housemates reported that
the saw strange lights in my room, very creepy feeling when they walked
past etc. My room was on the first floor, next to my room was the bathroom
and directly across from that room was Caroline's (My Housemate).</B>
<BR><B>When in my room alone at night I often felt a presence of something
quite sad, the presence was often felt more strongly&nbsp; around the window
area, but I never saw or heard anything peculiar until the night in question.
On the night the two housemates who had the rooms above mine and Caroline's
had gone out clubbing and both me and Caroline had decided to have early
nights. I'd got into bed and turned the lights out but kept the radio on.
When I heard a strange rustling noise which I couldn't pinpoint. I got
out of bed and turned the radio off to investigate. The noise sounded to
me at the time, like a long dress, one which had been made out of a heavy
material being dragged along the floor. As I put my ear to the door I could
hear that there was someone outside my room passing back and forth as if
they maybe were waiting to go to the bathroom. But as there was only me
and Caroline in the house, there shouldn't been any need to wait.</B>
<BR><B>I stood back and opened the door quickly but there was nobody on
the landing or in the bathroom. When I closed the door a few minutes later
the noises came back. I left light on and switched the TV on and fell asleep
eventually. The next morning when I got up my housemates had just come
back from an all night session were sat up in the living room being quizzed
by Caroline. During the night Caroline had got up to the toilet and was
quite shocked to find someone lying in the doorway of the bathroom,&nbsp;
in the dark, after her initial surprise she concluded that it must have
been Sarah or Becky, our clubbing housemates, who had come home because
she was ill.</B>
<BR><B>The figure had pyjamas on and was inside a brown sleeping bag, Caroline
got the impression that is was a young girl, maybe late teens. It was making
a lots of groans and moans, She described her making vomiting sounds. When
she asked if 'it' was ok, assuming it was Sarah or Becky, it just nodded
it's head. Though the strange thing was that none of my housemates had
come back to the house that night. Quiet spooky. The sleeping bag may account
for the noises I heard.</B>
<BR><B>I didn't hear anything or see anything for the next few days, whether
Caroline did or not I cant say, I think she would have been very tight
lipped about it if she had, as the whole episode had spooked everybody
out. But around four nights after the meeting. A strange wet patch began
to develop on the floor of our bathroom. It was an L shaped and quiet large,
to the eye it immediately looked like an out line of a body. Trying to
stay rational, we called our landlord, told him about the wet patch. The
plumber duly turned up and pulled back the carpet and floor boards to search
for the leaking pipe, though there was no leaking pipe. He concluded that
it was only wet from people getting out of the bath and dripping on the
carpet!</B>
<BR><B>This was ridiculous, the wet patch had been there for days, and
was absolutely soaking the whole carpet through. We took matters into our
own hands. We pulled the carpet and left it to dry outside on the washing
line. Then refitted it in the bathroom, but over the course of the afternoon
the wet L shaped patch was back. It eventually faded and dried up about
two weeks later. But there really was something strange about that house
and first floor.</B>

<BR><B>Ghosts in my Trailer</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bryancastille@cox.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Here is another experience I am sharing. When I lived in my grandparents
trailer I had some odd experiences like feeling an arm drape over me before
I fell asleep in bed one night, it only lasted for a few seconds. And sometimes
you could feel someone sit on the side or end of the bed but of course
no one was there. I never had a bad feeling or felt scared with these situations
either.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Nobody There!</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: 2002.bc@sympatico.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; I'm fascinated with ghost stories and enjoy a good scare from
reading other people's experiences yet I remain skeptical (or cynical,
not quite sure right now) with regard to the spiritual.&nbsp; Anyways,
I have had my own experiences that at one point or another I have deemed
to be supernatural and involving spirits that have passed away.&nbsp; At
this point in my life I even doubt whether my own experiences are real
in the sense that I saw a ghost.&nbsp; I will not deny that I saw something,
or felt something however what exactly happened I cannot say for sure.&nbsp;
I grew up hearing a story from my mother about a visit she had from her
father, so even at an early age I already had an interest in ghost stories
and ghostly experiences.&nbsp; The first experience I had was when I was
about 8 years old.&nbsp; I was playing alone by the side of the house I
grew up in.&nbsp; There were three small trees nearby that had a small
gap in between each.&nbsp; I was facing the house and I got the feeling
that I should turn around.&nbsp; Of course I did, and to my surprise I
saw my grandmother sitting on an old sofa of ours with a cat that we had
recently had euthenised.&nbsp; I got scared seeing her and in a split second
I ran to the other side of the house.&nbsp; I told my family immediately
and they assured me that it was probably just my grandmother visiting me
to tell me that the cat, which I had been very dear to me, was alright
and with her.&nbsp; I wonder now what would have happened if I didn't run
away as quickly as I did.&nbsp; Anyways, shortly after that experience
I had another visitation from my grandmother.&nbsp; This time I was sleeping
in my bed when I woke up and looked down at the foot of my bed.&nbsp; It
was dark and the blanket obstructed part of my view and I saw what looked
like my grandmother's head floating at the end of my bed looking at me.&nbsp;
I closed my eyes because I was scared and feel back asleep shortly after.&nbsp;
She didn't say anything to me or even make any movements.&nbsp; I should
mention that my experiences with my grandmother were with her in a younger
state than I had ever known her to be.&nbsp; She looked quite different
than I remember her while she was living yet I knew instantly when seeing
her exactly who she was.&nbsp; It was later, after talking to my mother
about seeing her mother, that she brought out an older picture of my grandmother
and I realized that they looked almost identical.&nbsp; I knew my grandmother
as a 70 year old woman but she visited me as if she were in her late 30's
or early 40's.&nbsp;&nbsp; This fascinated me because I wondered what determined
the age she would look when she died and what I would look like when I
died.&nbsp; Anyways, several years later we moved and I hadn't received
any more visitations from my grandmother or any other spirits in that time.&nbsp;
Our new house seemed to be haunted.&nbsp; I don't know the history of the
house we moved into but I had several odd experiences there.&nbsp; I shared
the basement with my brother as a room and at night it got quite dark down
there.&nbsp; One night, I had a dream that a spirit, an evil one, had enter
the house through the basement wall and actually had passed through my
body.&nbsp; I awoke immediately after that dream to find my entire body
had the pins and needles feeling of a limb falling asleep.&nbsp; The feeling
passed but the dream suddenly seemed very real to me and I couldn't help
but think that an evil spirit had entered our house at that moment.&nbsp;
Later, once again in the dark basement, I was having a hard time falling
asleep.&nbsp; In a dark place the eyes have a tendency to search out light
so mine were focussed on the small window on the other side of the room.&nbsp;
As I watched the window, I noticed shadow start to develop at the window
and move inside the basement.&nbsp; It flowed as if a wind was blowing
it and moved along the ceiling.&nbsp; The basement had already been nearly
pitchblack but where this object was it became even darker.&nbsp; It moved
closer to me and got really close, to the point where the darkness had
enveloped me and it felt thick.&nbsp; Suffocating me with the darkness
and then suddenly it vanished.&nbsp; The basement was also where we had
our computer, which meant that I was down there a lot on my own as well
as other members of our family.&nbsp; Occasionally we would come up out
of the basement and ask my mom was she had wanted, thinking that she had
called our names.&nbsp; This happened to my sister, dad and myself on several
occasions.&nbsp; It seemed odd to my mother that we kept responding to
her like she wanted us to do something.&nbsp; My sister concluded that
there was a ghost that mimicked my mothers voice and was calling our names.&nbsp;
Finally, my last experience was while I was alone in the house with the
haunted basement.&nbsp; I was busy doing dishes while my parents and siblings
were out somewhere.&nbsp; The house got hot in the summer and we often
opened the front door to let in a breeze.&nbsp; The kitchen window was
directly opposite the front door and you could see the reflection of the
front door in the window.&nbsp; As I was doing dishes I noticed was looked
like a small boy enter the house and run into the living room.&nbsp; I
was sure that there was going to be a boy in our house and I went to confront
him in our living room.&nbsp; There was nobody there!&nbsp; I thought it
odd and just went back to washing the dishes.&nbsp; I'm still not sure
what happened that night with the boy and had never seen him before or
since.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ghost of employee at Holiday Inn</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: rperez3@swfla.rr.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I used to work as a security officer at a Holiday Inn in Fort Myers,</B>
<BR><B>Florida. One night, I went up to the 5th floor to do a routine</B>
<BR><B>patrolling. When I got out of the elevator , there was a window
panel in</B>
<BR><B>front of the elevator, and on the far left of the window, I could
see</B>
<BR><B>the reflection of a woman walking towards the hallway. I did not
see her</B>
<BR><B>face, since I saw only her backside, but she was wearing a white
robe</B>
<BR><B>and had short gray hair. I immediately rushed towards the spot where
she</B>
<BR><B>was supposed to be and found nobody around. I know every inch of
that</B>
<BR><B>floor, and I can assure you there was no way someone could dissappear</B>
<BR><B>that fast from where she was standing. The next day, I was talking
to</B>
<BR><B>one of the employees that make breakfast in the morning for the
5th</B>
<BR><B>Floor concierge area, I told him about what I saw and described
the</B>
<BR><B>woman. He told me that not too long ago, before he started to work,</B>
<BR><B>there was a previous employee who worked on the 5th Floor Concierge,</B>
<BR><B>who&nbsp; in this story, shall be referred as "Cathy". Cathy worked
on the</B>
<BR><B>concierge for years, until one morning, she did not report for work.</B>
<BR><B>After 2 days of "No show", her manager called her home and no one</B>
<BR><B>answered. The manager then called the police to check her apartment.
The</B>
<BR><B>police checked her place and found her body lying on the floor.
She died</B>
<BR><B>of a heart attack at the age of 67. One curious thing is that she
was</B>
<BR><B>wearing a white robe and had short white hair.</B>
