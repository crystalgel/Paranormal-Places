SPENDING CHRISTMAS DAY WITH HIS PARENTS IN SWANSBORO.&nbsp; IT WAS 10:30
P.M. AND ROUTE 26 HAD LIGHT TRAFFIC.&nbsp; AS WE APPROACHED THE AREA AROUND

FROM BEIND US.&nbsp; WE ASSUMED IT WAS A MOTORCYCLE.&nbsp; I LOOKED IN
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR AND SAW NO HEADLIGHT FOR A CYCLE BEHIND ME.</b>
<br><b>THE BUZZ OF THE TWO STROKE ENGINE BECAME LOUDER AND LOUDER AND SEEMED
TO BE OVERHEAD.&nbsp; WE BOTH LOOKED AND SAW NOTHING.SOON THE BUZZ SEEMED
TO BE ON TOP OF THE CAB OF THE TRUCK CAUSING IT TO VIBRATE FIERCELY.&nbsp;
WE WERE BOTH SURE SOMETHING WAS GOING TO CRASH DOWN ON THE CAB OF THE TRUCK.&nbsp;
THE ROAR OF THE MYSTERY ENGINE WAS DEAFENING.SUDDENLY THE SOUND SEEMED
TO PASS IN FRONT OF THE TRUCK AND VANISH.&nbsp; WE SAW NOTHING AT ALL.&nbsp;
THE SOUND WAS FROM OUTSIDE THE TRUCK AND NOT INSIDE THE TRUCK OR FROM THE
ENGINE AREA.&nbsp; ANOTHER STRANGE ENCOUNTER ON ROUTE 26 IN THE VICINITY
OF HUBERT HAPPENED IN JULY OF 1998.&nbsp; ROGER AND I WERE UP FOR A VISIT
TO HIS PARENT'S HOUSE AND WERE RETURNING TO OUR MOTEL ROOM IN JACKSONVILLE

<p><b>The following events happened to me and my battle buddy while we
were pulling barracks guard duty during basic training. We were at Ft.
Benning, GA for Infantry training. Our battalion, nicknamed the Devil's
Playground, has a kind of gruesome history. Legend has it that a couple
of years ago, its nickname was the House of Pain.(It should be said, that
at the time, all of the infantry went through "High Stress"training. This
battalion was, and still is, the toughest battalion on The Hill. Hence:
only nicknames are used.)&nbsp; The name had to be changed, because of
the fact that they had 3 Pvts commit suicide during one training cycle.
While i was there, I managed to land in the toughest company in Devil's
Playground, which is still the toughest batt. on The Hill. At night some
guys said they'd hear noises coming from the platoon bay below us. Usually,
it sounded like the Platoon was recieving remedial training,</b>
<br><b>which was not out of the ordinary. Heck, we even got it sometimes
at night. However, the night I heard it, I was pulling barracks guard in
the farthest (and darkest) end of the bay. It was around 0115 hrs and the
platoon below us started doing mule kicks in the bay. Only, this was impossible
since the rest of the company was off post on Mid-Cycle pass, and our bay
was the only one occupied in the entire battalion! This went on for about
10 minutes, then stopped. I spent the rest of the hour up by the door with
my partner. Most of the guys had different</b>
<br><b>reasons as to why they did it, but almost the entire evening found
both guards up front. In the light.</b>
<br><b>The other event is usually just a feeling of uneasiness in the latrine
supply room. Most stories were from the middle-shift barracks guards(2400-0230
hrs or so). Nothing is known about the exact history of this building.
But, being part of the Infantry Training Brigade, I can imagine that quite
alot of negative energy has been left in those hallowed halls.One of the
more popular mottos is: "Pain is weakness leaving the body.(and we're gonna'
lose a whole lotta' weakness)."</b>

<p><b>By: gogl@iinet.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>It all started when my friend and I met.&nbsp; I had her over for
the night and she was telling me of the hauntings that have happened at
her dads house.&nbsp; We were out in the living room playing a video game&nbsp;
I turned around to give her the control when in the corner of my eye i
saw a head watching us through the sliding glass door.&nbsp; i turned to
look again but it moved quickly into the darkness.&nbsp; i told my friend
and we got scared.&nbsp; We went to go tell me mom but we didn't know if
it was my imagination or not.&nbsp; So we ran into my room got under the
covers and turned on the brady bunch to get our mind set on happy thoughts
so we could forget this whole incedent. All of a sudden a noise</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;came from the closet and the door opened slightly.&nbsp; My
canapy bed shook harshly for a few minutes (while we were on it.)&nbsp;
We immediatly jumped out of the bed and took the blanket and pillows with
us into my moms room.&nbsp; A few days later me and my friend were on the
computer doing a project for school and we heard my garage door that led
into my house open and then close.&nbsp; We both turned our heads in the
same direction without saying a word.&nbsp; We then asked if anyone was
here.&nbsp; There was no answer.&nbsp; We went and checked the sounds of
the doors and</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;the garage door into the house was the only sound that matched.&nbsp;
A year after that we had that same expierence again but louder and more
scary.&nbsp; We heard two doors.&nbsp; We didn't know which door so we
went through the house checking the sounds of the doors again.&nbsp; This
time it was the garage door and the laundry door leading into the house.&nbsp;
We thought a person had broken in to the house so we checked ever room
including closets and bathrooms but there was no sign of anything in here.&nbsp;
We sat down to think and we heard a loud sneeze coming from</b>
<br><b>somewhere in the house.&nbsp; We got so scared that we ran down
to my friends house.&nbsp; A few weeks later i was all by myself in my
room with my blinds shut doing my makeup.&nbsp; my vanity where i do my
makeup and it is in front of my window.&nbsp; For some reason i had a feeling
something was wrong (window wise)&nbsp; so i was scared so i was gonna
leave down to my friends house but all of a sudden something ran into my
window and i for some reason i could picture a man but the blinds were
shut&nbsp; i just knew it was a man in all black with dark hair and dark
skin etc.&nbsp; A few days after that my friend was over again and i went
it my room for some reason to get somehthing and my friend was out in the
family room walking into the kitchen and before you get to the kitchen
there is a hallway.&nbsp; As she walked passed the hallway she saw me wearing
that same clothes as i was a few minutes ago.&nbsp; My Friend called out
something to me but i was still in my room so when i answered from my room
my friend looked back in the hallway and the figure was gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;
also&nbsp; a month or two later i was rummaging through my closet as my
friend talked endlessly to me.&nbsp; I turned to reply and my eyes where
taken to the doorway of my room.&nbsp; I saw a person standing there&nbsp;
leaning on my door area in all black cape thing like the grim reeper.&nbsp;
He had a hood and no face i could see him for a while which was unusual
to me.&nbsp; i stared at the opening of his hood&nbsp; where should have
been a face but there wasn't i turned to look at my friend and then back
at him.&nbsp; he was gone.&nbsp; There were many other little events but
nothing like the terror we felt in these.&nbsp; We have now gotten used
to hearing unusual sounds because we do everyday.&nbsp; thanks for letting
us tell you these events.</b>

<p><b>The Columbian house Resturant in Waterville Ohio. My mom used to
work there when I was about 10 or so. I sometimes would go to work with
her. The place used to be a jail house also a stagecoach stop and a local
inn before it was a resturant. The place is historical. When you go upstairs
you can't go into any of the rooms because they are set up as excibites.
Down stairs is where the resturant is. The women who died upstairs was
never really a probelm she did sometimes pinch people or move furniture
around but it was an old man who haunted the</b>
<br><b>resturant itself. He would sometimes lock himself in the employees
bathroom which locked from the inside with a latch and hook. Sometimes
the door would remain locked for hours. So the employees would have to
use the customer bathrooms. He also liked to hide things from the wait
staff. When they would go to get drinks for a customer if they walked away
they would come back and their drinks would be missing so they would have
to get new ones. But after they would deliver the drinks they would come
back and the drinks would be there agian. He also liked to sit in front
of the fireplace in the dining room. My mom saw him there on several occasions.
He also used to follw her home from work. He would go into the bathroom
of our house and flush the toilet and then walk directly out our front
door. She finally had to remember everyday after her shift to tell him
that he could not come home with her or he thought it was okay to come
home with her and flush the toilet all night and open and shut the front
door. I once saw him on the stairs. He was never any harm he just was interesting.</b>

<p><b>I was about 14 at the time, and my parents had been divorced for
about 5</b>
<br><b>years, my father had remarried and had moved from WI to FL, I was
living</b>
<br><b>with my mother at the time, but the deal was that I had to spend
vacation</b>
<br><b>time with him and his new wife.</b>
<br><b>This time around, they had just moved in to a new house, which had
been</b>
<br><b>built on a sort of swamp land, since it`s on a river bank, (Alfia
River) and</b>
<br><b>it`s a lot of land.</b>
<br><b>Well I never really liked the house, but all the while I thought
it was</b>
<br><b>because of dislike at my family situation, and I`ve never had any
problems</b>
<br><b>being alone in any house, school or building to that matter, but
one night I</b>
<br><b>was alone in that house, my older brother was still at school, my
father</b>
<br><b>hadn`t returned from his office and my stepmother and my younger
brother</b>
<br><b>were at football practice. So I`m sitting on a snack-bar counter
which</b>
<br><b>dubbed as a kitchen table, positioned in front of the small double
french</b>
<br><b>windows above the kitchen sink which led to the wet bar that was
in the</b>
<br><b>family room.</b>
<br><b>This family room has glass panes from the ceiling to about 3 feet
above the</b>
<br><b>floor and then it stone.</b>
<br><b>In sitting there I was looking out across the river to where the
lights off</b>
<br><b>a fishing camp`s dock is. Since we had just moved in, the house
was standing</b>
<br><b>on a made hill, and the whole property was still sand. Anyway to
get back to</b>
<br><b>the story, I`m looking out and all of a sudden a small black rubber
looking</b>
<br><b>ball rises from nowhere and satys suspended in mid air about 100
ft from the</b>
<br><b>glass pane, it looked like a squash ball or something and in front
of my</b>
<br><b>eyes it starts spinning in mid air! And it hurles itslef towards
me, I`m</b>
<br><b>petrified and all i can think is that with the speed it flying towards
me,</b>
<br><b>it woul break throuhg the glass fly through the french windows,
which were</b>
<br><b>open, and hit me smack straight in the forehead and I woul die.</b>
<br><b>It did hot against the glass, but it didn`t break it, but fell to
the</b>
<br><b>ground, I know it wasn`t my imagination because a certain persian

last night</b>
<br><b>I was over my aunts house and my uncle had gone into the hospital.
I had to</b>
<br><b>leave for a little while and I told my aunt I would be right back
but I</b>
<br><b>thought she was sleeping so she didn't hear me. Although she did
she said she</b>
<br><b>heard me leave the house and not 2 seconds as I left she heard someone</b>
<br><b>walking around her living room. Now I didn't find this out until
tonight.</b>
<br><b>When I returned I I was hearing all different kinds of sounds I
heard</b>
<br><b>knocking ( now noone else is in the house) and movement but I didn't
really</b>
<br><b>think much of it. The dog in the meantime was going absolutely crazy
running</b>
<br><b>around and barking at my aunts bedroom door ( she was sleeping on
the couch)</b>
<br><b>I couldn't sleep so I decided to watch TV After that I finally after
hours</b>
<br><b>fell asleep. I suddenly woke up seeing who I though was my aunt
Janice</b>
<br><b>standing in the archway of her living room Just staring at me I
asked her if</b>
<br><b>she was OK but no answer and I just fell back to sleep... When I
asked her</b>
<br><b>about it she told me she didn't remember getting up. OK that was
last night</b>
<br><b>But... This Morning I came home around 6:50 am and I had to get
ready for</b>

<p><b><font size=+2>Spiritual Camp</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jari@csinet.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>In the 60's my mother and aunt took a tour of Indiana and decided
on a lark to check out the spiritualist camp they had heard about.&nbsp;
They arrived in Chesterfield in late afternoon and started looking.&nbsp;
Because dusk was approaching and they were nervous they said one more run
through town and forget it.&nbsp; Upon coming to a corner they had been
at before, they looked up and saw a wrought iron archway over a gate, and
it read, "Spiritualist Camp" Feeling silly at having missed such a large
sign, they drove in and around the circle with neat little cottages</b>
<br><b>on both sides of the road.&nbsp; There were no books left out on
the porches for people to sign up for a reading.&nbsp; They decided to
stop at one house and check.&nbsp; Nobody answered and there was no book
out.&nbsp; They started to feel real creepy, as it was dusk, so they drove
the rest of the way around the circle to the two story cafeteria where
they could see ladies in long dress moving around through the windows upstairs.
Thinking they were having a function that that was the reason there were
no readings going on.&nbsp; They came home later and described the</b>
<br><b>whole camp to us fully.&nbsp; A couple of years later they went
back with a group, had a great time and didn't feel creepy at all.&nbsp;
Just before leaving Mom commented to an elderly lady out by the gate about
all the changes in camp in the last couple of years.&nbsp; The lady asked
her to explain,and she said that the wrought iron gate arachway was gone
and now there was a cathedral buile at the end of the circle so you cannot
drive all the way around anymore, and the two story cafeteria had been
replaced by a one story one.&nbsp; The lady said she had been coming to
camp for 15 years and had never seen an archway and the cathedral had always
been there as had the cafeteria.&nbsp; They went to the museum and found
old pictures of camp with the archway and two story cafeteria, and of course,
the ladies were in long dress.&nbsp; They had had an experience and didn't
even know it for two years.</b>

<p><b><font size=+2>The Grave</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kstark@capital.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This all took place in Upstate NY.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>In the summer of 1993 my then fiance took me up to where he grew
up. He then decided to take me to a place called the Witch's Grave(I have
no found much information on the actual story or truth of this, but I believe
its true). From what I found out from the Town Clerks Office, it is a grave
of a 13yr old girl who was murdered back in 1839 for being a witch.When
we arrived up there he would not let me out of the car, nor would he turn
the car off. He said that many things had happened in the past up there
and he basically said no. I was ok fine, at the time. I was pregnant and
if what he said was true, I didn't want anything to happen.</b>
<br><b>It took me a bit, but I finally made it up there alone. And of course
I brought a camera with me. When I got out of the car, nothing really happened.
I then started to walk towards the grave, the wind picked up and i felt
cold. I asked if there was anyone around me, if so to show themselves.
My car (which was off) turned back on all my itself. I was able to walk
right over to the grave with no problems. I spent a few more minutes there
and turned to leave. The wind was still blowing and suddenly a name came
to me, Sarah. When I got back in the car, my</b>
<br><b>radio stations where switching all by themselves.All and all I left
feeling more energized and happy. It was a good trip none the less. A few
days later I had this feeling of being summonded back there. It scared
me, it was like I was being called there. It took me a long time to find
the courage to go back up.I had the pictures developed that day, and when
I got them home, I put them on the kitchen counter. I turned around to
do something, and</b>
<br><b>when I went back to look at the pictures they were gone. I haven't
seen them since.The second time I went back up there it was a little different.
It was summer time once again (I can't go up there in the other seasons</b>
<br><b>unless on a good day, its way up in the middle of no where on a
dirt road) I went to a house that has some association with the grave(whatI
am not sure - I couldn't find any information out about it) I took some
pictures of the house. I got this erie feeling, so I left and went to the
grave again. Again nothing much happened that didn't happen in the eariler
time I went there. I took more&nbsp; pictures. After I left I had the pictures
developed, in every single grave picture there was a distinct oval shape.
it is clear in every picture. I believe its Sarah or another</b>
<br><b>entity there. I showed my friend these pictures, and she was immediatly
interested in the site. She asked me to take her. So a bit later I decided
to take her. This is when things get really different. We went up on a
summer day(in July - about 90 degrees out - I will never forget this day)
I was wearing a tank top and pants (field, I was afraid of ticks and things)
We went to the house first. As soon as i got out of my car I felt heavy,
like something was holding me in place. We managed to walk to the house,
when i walked up along side of it I felt like i was</b>
<br><b>falling, as i looked up at the house, it was illuminated with a
white light. My friend walked inside the house(which burned down) and didn't
feel anything, she found burned papers that were dated October 1973 (which
is my birth month and year). As i stood in the back yard(or what would
of been at that time) I felt rooted to different spots, where I physically
could not move. When I was able to move, around, I would see skeltons buried
in the ground. Actually it got so bad, that I started to dig in spots to
find them. (Background on the house from my now husband - He said that
the house burned down after a group of kids held a seance. The 'leader'
of the</b>
<br><b>seance was then killed after it was over.)We then made it to the
grave site. I parked my car and we got out. We walked immediatly to the
grave and put flowers on it. All of a sudden I felt heavy and extremly
cold. So cold where my fingers where actually turning white and blue. I
walked over towards the back left corner and I felt a distinct presance
there, we were not wanted there. I got to a spot again and was 'rooted'
to the ground, I was near tears at</b>
<br><b>this point, I knew we were not wanted there and I wanted to go home,
but I couldn't move. I was soo cold, it was not funny. As I looked around
I saw all these Y figures sticking up out of the ground, I was told that
that is not a good sign, it is a sign from Pagan religion of a evil or
bad presence is there.</b>
<br><b>We were finally able to get out of there, when we tired to leave
a sheriff stoped and towed my car. Mind you this is about 45 south of albany,
in the middle of absloutly no where. Its on a dirt road that is only limited
seasonal access. There isnt a house in sign for miles. So all in all it
was not a good trip, it scared the daylights out of me. I will never go
back, and I have not felt any feelings of being called there since. Everytime
I do talk about it though I get extremly cold and little things happen.</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;I've experienced some rather strange things over the past couple
years</b>
<br><b>in my house. one of the weirdest things happened a year ago, when
I was</b>
<br><b>15. I was making myself some cereal&nbsp; out in my kitchen, when
something</b>
<br><b>caught the corner of my eye, I looked quickly and saw a fuzzy, sort
of</b>
<br><b>faded figure standing&nbsp; about 5 feet away from me. I was extremely</b>
<br><b>startled, I couldn't even move. I said out loud,"what do you want?!",</b>
<br><b>but it didn't respond, it just kept standing there. I finally got
angry</b>
<br><b>enough&nbsp; and said,"why don't you just piss off!", and with that,
it</b>
<br><b>vanished.</b>
<br><b>i had thought about what had just happened, and started laughing,

<br><b>We lived in a haunted house in Merced Ca. in a sub division, next
to Bear Creek on Rambler Road.&nbsp; My bedroom was the cold spot. None
of our animals would go in my room, my door handle constantly turned at
night, the carpet in my room would come up by the hand fulls.&nbsp; I had
a huge board that I worked large jig saw puzzles on every night and every
morning all my work was strewn underneath by bed.&nbsp; We had an shadow
of a man on our hallway wall.&nbsp; Our dogs would bark at it and never
look away. Our TV glowed all night and my grandmothers rocker was in constant
motion. Voices could be heard when you were alone, my grandmother was patted
on her rearend and you could see her nightgown move.&nbsp; Things began
happening right at the begining of the construction.There were rumors that
other homes were having "strange" things happening.&nbsp; Have you received
any information on this?&nbsp; I would love to talk with others who have
had these experiences in that sub division.&nbsp; Thank you</b>

<p><b><font size=+2>The Voice in the Old House</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: mw12352@navix.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My experience took place some 16 years ago. It was early spring and
I</b>
<br><b>had my two best friends staying with me for the weekend. My parents
home</b>
<br><b>is located about a mile outside of town, a small farm of about 25
acres.</b>
<br><b>On the property stood an old house that my family lived in before</b>
<br><b>building the home they live in today. On the weekend of my experience</b>
<br><b>the house was uninhabitable, and in the beginning stages of severe</b>
<br><b>deterioration. Of course, an old, crumbling house is pretty much
a</b>
<br><b>magnet for three 10 year old boys, so naturally, we decided to explore.</b>
<br><b>As we entered the house, we walked carefully, heading the warnings
from</b>
<br><b>my parents about rusty nails a tetnus shots. We slowly crept into
the</b>
<br><b>bathroom, pretty much dead center in the house. At that moment,
a swarm</b>
<br><b>of flies came down from the ceiling, and in our recoil a voice sounded.</b>
<br><b>The voice carried a simple but effective message, "Get out of this</b>
<br><b>house".&nbsp; For a split second our frightened eyes met in both
disbelief</b>
<br><b>and shock. Simultaneously we ran for the door, and didn't stop running</b>
<br><b>for several minutes. Years later, upon questioning my Mother about
the</b>
<br><b>previous owners of the property, I discovered that a man died in
the</b>
<br><b>house, a victim of a heart attack. I often walk by the old house,
and up</b>
<br><b>until about a year ago, I would often go inside (The house has</b>
<br><b>practically fallen into a heap of lumber). But I never heard the
voice</b>
<br><b>again. The strange thing about it is that I often dream about the
old</b>
<br><b>house. Dreams of being chased from it, although I can never see
who is</b>
<br><b>chasing me. I often have dreams that the house is strong, almost
human</b>
<br><b>in the energy it gives off. I will often stand and look as I&nbsp;
walk by</b>
<br><b>it. Staring and looking for a sign of who's voice we heard 16 years
ago.</b>
<br><b>But I have received no signs. Only those in my dreams.</b>

<p><b><font size=+2>The Demon of Desoto</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By:amurray@ucla.edu</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I was hanging out with four friends on a Friday night by an open
area at the end of a street called DeSoto (out in the San Fernando Valley
in Los Angeles). It is a huge open space with hills which include hiking
trails and a miniature waterfall. It is very lonely, albeit for the freeway
bridge that runs nearby, and pretty dark. Anyways, we had climbed down
to the area and had spent about an hour exploring the waterfall, but all
the while, I kept feeling that someone was watching us. When we became
bored (...or maybe scared) we began to climb back to the hill where the
car was parked. Since the hill was pretty steep we decided to sit and rest
at the top...BIG MISTAKE. We rested for about a minute or so and something
bid me to look right in front of me, at the next hill over (which was about
15-20 feet away and a bit higher in elevation than our hill), and I see
a black misty-like figure (kind of like black smoke or black fire but with
fluid-like motion)hovering next to a bush. It was shaped like a human being
and looked as if it was walking (or floating...it wasn't touching the ground)
one way and then turning around and walking the other way, then stopping
and staring straight in our direction (though it didn't have a discernible
face, you could tell it was focusing on you). It took me a couple of seconds
to realize what I was seeing (I had never before</b>
<br><b>seen a ghost), and I turned around without a single word, staggered
a couple of times and started running towards the car...to my surprise,
everyone else had done the same thing! Someone in the group was screaming
expletives and I think I managed a sqeak. As we all neared the car we turned
around and lo and behold it was still there. The way back home, no one
uttered a word, but we all knew what we had seen. We were all as white
as a sheet. Days later we managed to speak about it and we had all seen
exactly the same thing. The two times we have tried to</b>
<br><b>hang out there again (to investigate), we have been spookily blocked
by fire-engines&nbsp; (the first time I think there was a fire) and police/
ambulances (the second time... not sure what had happened). We all took
this as a sign and vowed never to return.</b>

<p><b><font size=+2>The Apartment's Dead Man</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Dreamslave78@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My boyfriend and I have been together for a few months now, and there
has</b>
<br><b>been a few disturbing experiences in his apartment. First of all,
let me tell</b>
<br><b>you where he lives. He resides in a basement apartment of his sister's
home</b>
<br><b>in a quite little corner of a town named Stickney, Illinois.(We
actually call</b>
<br><b>it Stinky, because of the water reclaimation plant). It has been
told to us</b>
<br><b>that the original owner of the home built the downstirs apartment
for</b>
<br><b>himself, as he was aging in years and wanted a place to stay when
his son</b>
<br><b>took over the upstairs home. Not long after the old man built and
moved into</b>
<br><b>the apartment, he had a heart attack in his bed. His bedroom is
now my</b>
<br><b>boyfriend's bedroom. Every night for the past five months since
he has lived</b>
<br><b>down there, there have been strange things happening, the kind that
make you</b>
<br><b>pull the sheets over your head and shiver like a little kid, and
believe me,</b>
<br><b>we're not children! He has two cats, but we have ruled out the cats
as the</b>
<br><b>culprits, as they have been on the bed with us at the time of each
occurence.</b>
<br><b>The cabinets in the kitchen have a habit of opening and closing
themselves,</b>
<br><b>the dresser in his bedroom(it has glass doors) have a habit of making
a</b>
<br><b>tapping noise.....like someone tapping on a mirror's surface, and
the</b>
<br><b>strangest of all so far was my pager going berserk....it set itself
to</b>
<br><b>midnight every night and turned itself on and off.....as if it were
trying to</b>
<br><b>make up it's mind! I admit I was slightly terrified by these happenings,
but</b>
<br><b>time has made it sort of a mild annoyance. But the cats still act
as if they</b>
<br><b>are staring at something that neither my boyfriend can see. It seems
like a</b>
<br><b>minor haunting to me, but please respond to me if you get the chance.</b>

<p><b><font size=+2>The Headless Dress</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: dspe@sequent.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I lived in Petaluma California in an old Victorian house built on
about</b>
<br><b>3 acres of land.&nbsp; The house was constructed around 1810 and
was occupied</b>
<br><b>by me and two other roommates.&nbsp; I lived there for about 2 years.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>other roommates both having jobs that required traveling were never</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; One night I went outside in the garden to have a cigarette.&nbsp;
It</b>
<br><b>was a cloudy night and there were not many stars to be seen.&nbsp;
We didnt</b>
<br><b>have a porch light so I stumbled and felt my way over to a chair
we had</b>
<br><b>set next to the old well in the garden.&nbsp; I lit up my cigarette
and</b>
<br><b>something caught my eye.&nbsp; As I looked to my right I saw something
that I</b>
<br><b>will never forget.&nbsp; Coming towards me, very slowly, gliding
along across</b>
<br><b>the bricks was an old dress. It was one of those dresses you see
wemon</b>
<br><b>wear in those old photographs.&nbsp; It was white and was bright
enough in</b>
<br><b>the pitch dark for me to see everything.&nbsp; There was no head,
no arms, no</b>
<br><b>feet.&nbsp; Just the dress, filled out as if there was a person
in it.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>glided towards me then vered off going behind the house.&nbsp; This
whole</b>
<br><b>incident took about 10 seconds from beginning to where she disappeared</b>
<br><b>behind the house.&nbsp; I threw my cigarette and ran into the house
where I</b>
<br><b>grabbed my keys and headed out the opposite door hoping to make
it out</b>
<br><b>of there alive.&nbsp; Looking back on this I dont know why I was
so scared at</b>
<br><b>the time.&nbsp; I should have gone looking behind the house.&nbsp;
I told my</b>
<br><b>roommates later about this and they didnt look surprised.&nbsp;
They have</b>
<br><b>both lived there for about 5 years and have had similar experiences.</b><b></b>
