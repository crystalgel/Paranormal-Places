<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
&nbsp;<br>
When I was little, about 5/6, we lived in a big house which was
originally two cottages, later joined together. Although myself and my
sister were young at the time and had no personal experiences, my
parents told us stories about what had happened there when we moved
house some years later.<br>
As well as the familiar cold spots, creaks, and groans, some other
stuff went on too. One day my Mum was in the downstairs bathroom when
she heard a man's cough coming from outside the door. Thinking it was
my Dad going into the study room (which was opposite the bathroom), she
thought nothing of it. When she came out of the bathroom, however, the
study was empty and no-one was outside. She went back to the kitchen
and found my Dad where she'd left him, sitting at the table. She asked
him if he'd come outside the bathroom and coughed, but he said he
hadn't moved the whole time. <br>
Another time my Mum, Dad, and one of their friends were sitting at the
kitchen table when they all heard a massive crash come directly from
upstairs, where my bedroom was. My Mum described it as the sound of a
wardrobe falling over, or a full grown adult being thrown to the floor.
They rushed upstairs to find me fast asleep and nothing out of place in
my room. We even had the fireplace in my room checked, in case a stone
had fallen down the chimney. Nothing was found and there was no
explanation. Everyone in the house was accounted for.<br>
One night my parents were in bed when they heard the sound of a woman
gently humming/singing. The sound came from the end of the corridor and
continued downstairs, then eventually, stopped. Again, this could not
be explained. Myself and my sister were asleep and even if we did get
up, we certainly wouldn't walk down the corridor singing!<br>
My second story is based in my grandmother's house, a manor house which
is around 200 years old. My grandmother has a story which even to this
day she swears was true. She was walking upstairs when in front of her
she saw a pair of woman's shoes on the step above. She looked up to see
a skirt, blouse, and before she could see the woman's face, she
vanished. My Dad's family all grew up in the house, and my Uncle
mentioned that from his bedroom he used to hear the sound of gravel
crunching outside, like someone walking towards the house. On several
occassions he even recounts seeing two big black dogs sitting by his
bed. Although I like the house, I always get that feeling of 'being
watched' whenever I go over. If I'm sat in the kitchen I always want to
look into the parlour (which is next to the kitchen, with the door
always open so you can see in), and I always feel like someone's
sitting in there. Even to this day I refuse to go upstairs by myself.<br>
As well as seeing a key moving in a locked door (from the inside, when
no-one was in there), myself and my sister had a weird experience. We
were sat outside. The garden is kind of placed on a hill, very sloped,
that you reach by climbing some steps. From where we were sitting we
could just see into my grandmother's bedroom. She'd gone out shopping
and had left her two dogs on her bed. We were just watching them,
talking, when suddenly one of the dogs started barking at the corner of
the room, at something we could not see. She (the dog) then jumped on
to the bed and started barking directly at us. Then at the exact same
time we both saw a white mist, sort of in the form of a hand, move
gently over the dogs head. She then stopped barking. My sister and I
both looked at each other in surprise. We'd both seen it, but could not
understand it. It was daylight, but not sunny, quite cloudless. There
were no reflections on the glass or anything like that because there
was nothing to reflect, no trees or anything behind us. And we'd quite
clearly seen the mist from the INSIDE of the window.<br>

Unbelievable experience - The Bytowne Museum<br>
<br>
By: gianna.brown@yahoo.ca <br>
I was on your website and I saw the section encouraging people to share
their stories about paranormal experiences.&nbsp; I was on a haunted
walk tour last night in my hometown of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada and had
more than one experience at The Bytowne Museum - a known, haunted
building in the city and all over the world I think too.&nbsp;
Anyway...here is my story...please don't publish my name!<br>
Last night, my sister in law, my friend and I went on a haunted walking
tour with a local company in our city (Ottawa, Ontario, Canada).&nbsp;
One of the places we visited is the oldest stone building in the city,
The Bytowne Museum.&nbsp; It was built sometime in the 1800's and sits
alongside the Rideau Canal, which spills right into the Ottawa
River.&nbsp; The Rideau Canal is man made and many of the workers who
built it, died from different diseases, some in that museum, which I
believe used to house some of the workers and their families.&nbsp; <br>
The story begins...I was talking to our guide and telling her that I
had been there before and that the last time I was there, the door on
the floor we were on (the third floor - known to be the most haunted),
had closed on it's own.&nbsp; Just as I said this to her, the same door
SLAMMED shut.&nbsp; I think everyone jumped out of their skin.&nbsp;
One of the guys on our tour immediately went over to investigate and
there was nobody there.&nbsp; <br>
Perhaps the eeriest part of the eveving is this next part.&nbsp; We had
just exited the children's museum, which has clothing that children
wore back then and other artifacts.&nbsp; Once again, our guide is
speaking and I am standing at the back of the crowd.&nbsp; All of a
sudden, out of nowhere, I heard a child's voice, as clear as a bell,
right beside me, say "Is that you mommy?".&nbsp; Five other people
standing at the back of the crowd all whipped around, because they
heard the exact same thing I did.&nbsp; My sister in law is kind of a
skeptic...she had heard it too, but still said "well if that was real,
it will happen again".&nbsp; Not 30 seconds after she said that...the
child's voice again.&nbsp; Nobody was able to make out what it said
this time.&nbsp; We were wracking our brains trying to figure out where
this could have come from.&nbsp; We eventually found out that we were
the only tour and people in the building, except for the volunteers and
that the only audio equipment in the building is on the first floor...a
video about loggers.&nbsp; That was enough for me!!<br>
Finally...as we were making our way out of the building, our guide had
us stop on this set of stairs, where we sat down to listen to one last
story.&nbsp; My nerves were on edge at this point and of course, I was
the last person again!!&nbsp; I'm sitting at the top of the stairs and
behind me, I hear barking.&nbsp; I'm listening really intently, trying
to figure out where this is coming from.&nbsp; You have to
understand...this museum is very secluded and in a place where people
don't just stroll by with their dogs...it's kind of out of the
way.&nbsp; So, I'm listening very hard to see if the barking is in the
distance or where it is coming from.&nbsp; I hear it again...and there
is no mistaking...it is right in the room.&nbsp; I hadn't heard any
stories about dogs, but when I read up on it, apparently there have
been reports of people hearing a dog running in the museum.<br>
If you ever have a chance to visit Ottawa, you have to check this place
out.&nbsp; Not only is the history fascinating, but the paranormal
experiences are very common and you just may find out for yourself!<br>

The Unexpected<br>
<br>
By: Rodila@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
Recently, an old friend of mine got married and I was his best man.
Part of my duties as such was to help with the planning and rehearsal.
One evening, I stopped by the priest's home to ask him some questions
about the service. I was greeted at the door by the butler who escorted
me into the living room and told me that he would tell the priest that
I was here to see him. After the better part of an hour, the priest
finally came down into the room wearing his night clothes and a very
surprised look on his face. He greeted me and asked, "How long have you
been here?" I replied, "About an hour." Then I asked, "Did the butler
not tell you I was here?" With a puzzled look on his face he replied,
"We haven't had a butler here in over a hundred years or more." <br>

The Little Old Lady and the Ghost Cat<br>
<br>
By: sirrahnivek@bigpond.com<br>
<br>
I've already posted a story up here about my Toowong Boneyard
experience so I thought: well, I've another strange (dunno about the
wonderful bit) story I wanna share with the readers. I'm from Australia
and live in a small Aussie country town in NSW. Back in the mid 80s
(1986) I got my first job in town. I used to live on a hippie commune
in what I call self imposed exile. Anyway I had enough of being a
hippie, smoking dope, doing the usual s**t the hippies like to do
(bludging on the dole) so I pulled my finger out and got a job. I moved
into town, got a hair cut and moved into a nice, reasonable house that
was built in the 1920's in a nice, middle class leafy street. Yeah,
sounds nice and what-have-yah but that was soon to change.<br>
I moved in with a nice family and so far so good every thing was hokey
dorey until one night I went to a party. Okay, I'll admit that I was
drunker than a judge. It was 2am when I came staggering home and
decided to go around the back so I won't wake anyone. I stumbled around
the back (probably muttering or singing) when, suddenly, I see this
little old lady standing looking at me. Now, I thought, where the f**k
did she appear from? There was a nursing home just down the road from
us so maybe she escaped from there. This bit got blurry because I
remember trying to find the keys and when I turned around, hey she was
gone! I threw up. My housemate was not impressed, let me add that in.<br>
Fast forward three months later. I went to a dinner party and this time
came home SOBER. It was 2am and I walked around the back, thinking
about the girl I was chatting up at the dinner party, thinking what a
gentleman I was (sure I didn't swear that night) and walked around the
back when, there she was (the little old lady, not the girl) standing
there in the exact same spot as the last time, glaring at me as if she
was really peeved off about something. I studied her: she wore a white
gown, long grey hair and very angry eyes. REALLY angry eyes. I asked
her if she was okay but got no answer. So I shrugged and let myself in.<br>
The next day I told Yvonne (my housemate) about the old woman. As I was
explaining to her, her eldest son suddenly turned around and said:
Yeah, I saw her. She's always standing at the bottom of my bed...then
it dawned on me. The kids would wake up around 2am, screaming something
about an old woman. That was it. I was very concerned but things came
to head soon after. Now, as this was going on, something else weird
happened.<br>
Yvonne and her three brats left me alone one weekend (yippee, party
time but I had no money) with their poofy poodle. Man, I hated that
poodle. Anyway I watching a Video (yes, children, this was before
DVDs-prehistoric times) when the poofy poodle ran by me with something
white and fluffy chasing it. I was stunned. There's a flaming cat in
the house. So I found the poodle but couldn't find the 'cat'. Anyway,
after giving the poodle the dirty look (pity I didn't give it a kick,
awell) I sat down to finish the movie off when, again this white thing
came running by me this time chased by the poofy poodle. This happened
most of the day that I got used to the ghost cat, which I presumed it
was.<br>
Now, for the finale. A few weeks past and had a great mate over one
night some beer and a Video. Me mate sat down as I was setting up the
VCR when, suddenly, all the doors started slamming, the windows went up
and down, the Video was spat out and my mate was out that door quicker
than Flipper the dolphin (faster than lightning). He was shaken. That
was the final straw for me. I left, went to Sydney and ended up working
in a haunted department store, which I promise I will write that one
down for you's and my spooky adventure in Ireland.<br>
POSTSCRIPT: I was on holidays about two years later and went back to my
hometown to visit my family and have a look at a block of land we were
considering of buying, which I did. I happened to find myself in my old
street. I bumped into a street kid who was living in a halfway house at
the time. We ended up having a talk over a beer and she told me she
left the house.<br>
"Why?' I asked.<br>
"Because of the old woman."<br>
I frowned. "Old woman?"<br>
"Yeah, she would stand at the bottom of my bed, glaring at me. She looked to be very pissed at someone."<br>
I laughed and said: "Ah, the old bat is still hanging around," and told
the girl my story. There you go, my experience with a very pissed off
ghost and a playful dead cat.<br>

The Hanging Girl in my Closet<br>
<br>
By: Moonlitfairy91@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
so here's my story, its a little short but very strange. I was about 12
and I was on the phone with my best friend Holly, I was sitting on the
floor with my back turned toward the closet. when I got off the phone I
went to get up and I happened to see in my closet a young girl
hanging...it scared the stars out of me! She was glowing white with a
blue aura .I ran out and could never go back in my room for a while .I
don't know who she was or anything but she looked as real as you and
me. I have never forgotten the look on her face or anything...its like
my mind took a picture of it, I don't think I will ever forget. As
crazy as this story sounds I still have trouble convincing myself that
it was real.<br>

Rainbow Bridge Lake City<br>
<br>
By: jasonjamesb@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
I grew up in Lake City and Ive been there (rainbow bridge) many nights
with my friends in highschool trying to "provoke" the spirits to show
us something bone chilling. we did the candy bar trick and it did not
work. but one night in october there was 4 of us, out on the bridge
just hanging out and the car's head lights just shut off. we were using
the headlights to light up the bridge. we were on the south side of the
bridge when this happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; Freaked out, we all ran north
across the bridge only to find that the automatic doors were locked and
the car still running. we walked to lake city, about 4 miles, got a
spare set of keys and brought a couple more people with us so we could
show them what had happened (nobody believed us). when we got there,
the car was still running, doors unlocked, and lights on! but the thing
that was really freaky that we noticed was that the car was moved about
8 feet away from the bridge! and there was no tracks in front of or
behind the tires. it was like it was just picked up and sat there! on
the drive home, we also noticed that every raido station pre-set button
was programed to 99.9! all 6 buttons. either someone really knew what
they were doing and wanted to scare the hell out of us or we finally
got what we were asking for!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the entire rainbow bend park south of lake city just gives you an eerie
feeling if you go there at night and walk around.&nbsp;&nbsp; pull the
keys from the ignition if you go, its a long walk to lake city!<br>
&nbsp;the glowing tombstone in coon rapids, that works! tales of the
glowing tombstone easily made the 30 mile trip from coon rapids to lake
city. so of course... we had to check it out. the cemetary is out in
the middle of nowhere, directley south of coon rapids on a level b,
winding, hilly gravel road. if anyone goes there do not go drunk and go
when the gravel roads are in good shape, not sloppy wet. you drive and
drive and drive, then you'll get to a huge curvey hill. at the top of
the hill the road curves to the west and the cemetary is on your left.
if you stay on the road and drive a little bit past the cemetary's main
entrance, shut your car and lights off and look to the south southeast.
there is a little head stone in the southern most row of the cemetary
that glows. you have to be at just the right angle or it wont work. if
you walk up to it, it quits glowing. it was as freaky as rainbow
bridge. we went to the cemetary on a moonless night, no farm places
around, and all of our car lights were off and the head stone had a
very noticable dullish red glow from the road! thats all I got!<br>

The Running Man<br>
<br>
By: fcnapier@yahoo.com<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
This is a personal experience that happened to me 2 years ago in
Charleston, SC.&nbsp; I am in the Navy, and had just got off the swing
shift on base, leaving at approximately 11:45 pm from the base.&nbsp;
The base I was at is on an old plantation's land, but I never thought
anything of it.&nbsp; <br>
The part where I worked at was on the water of the nearby river, and
the road back passed along the river for about a half mile before
turning inland.&nbsp; Fog had a tendency to build up on the river in
the fall and winter months, and the fog had rolled across the road on
this particular night.&nbsp; <br>
As I was driving along the road coming back from work, I saw a man
running on the side of the road.&nbsp; This was nothing special on a
military base, people run all the time to keep up physical condition,
but this was at almost midnight, which I found strange, and he was
wearing nothing reflective at all, seemingly wearing all dark
clothing.&nbsp; As my car came up on him, he immediately darted out in
front of the car at a speed I had never seen before.&nbsp; I slammed on
the breaks, but it was too late.&nbsp; I expected to hear and feel a
massive thud as I hit this poor fellow, but as the car passed through
him he vanished without a trace.&nbsp; I got out of the car, brights
on, searching with my flashlight for a person anywhere around my car,
but I was the only one as far as I could see on this road.&nbsp; It
scared the living daylights out of me to the point I started searching
the inside of the car to ensure I did not have a hitch-hiker with me
now.&nbsp; After getting back into the car, I drove as fast as I could,
with interior lights on in the car, to the nearest well lit area,
locked the doors, left the lights on, and called my father to relate
the incident.&nbsp; After some 20 minutes of consoling me, I finally
got my wits about me to drive home.&nbsp; However, it did not end here.<br>
From this night on, something was different about my apartment.&nbsp;
There was a presence in the place that I hadn't felt the months before
the incident.&nbsp; I began to refuse sitting in the living room alone
altogether because of a feeling like someone was watching me.&nbsp; Out
of the corner of my eye I would see the bathroom light on, clear as
day, but when I looked over it would be off again.&nbsp; It would feel
like someone would sit down next to me on the couch, but I was the only
one in the apartment.&nbsp; Finally, one weekend my father came out to
visit.&nbsp; Growing up with numerous ghostly and at some times demonic
experiences, most of which he never talks about, he has become highly
sensitive to the paranormal.&nbsp; The first day he arrived, he used a
key I left him to get in while I was at work.&nbsp; When I got home,
having said nothing of my experiences in the apartment to him, the
first thing he asked me was if I ever got the feeling someone was in
the kitchen area, peeking over the half-wall at the television.&nbsp; I
froze in my tracks at this.&nbsp; Over the course of his week-long
visit, he said he also thought he saw the bathroom light turning itself
on and off, and felt someone else sit down on the couch next to him, as
well as seeing a shadow of a man mainly around the kitchen area, who
would periodically lean over the half-wall like he was looking at what
was on the television.&nbsp; But he said he never saw or felt anything
or anyone in the bedrooms.&nbsp; I now had a reason for my seemingly
unfounded paranoia of being in the living room alone.&nbsp; <br>
I continued living with this feeling from the night of the incident
driving home through the following few months until I received orders
to leave Charleston, and have not felt the presence of the "Running
Man" since then. <br>

Personal Experience<br>
<br>
By: esment1012@aol.com<br>
<br>
At the end of this quiet road, before the gate posted "private
property-no trespassing", is an old abandoned house on the water. I'm
not exaclty too sure what the story behind this house is but there are
too many odd occurences that have happened in the home and even along
the road itself. When we first visited the house, in 2003, we had a
group of people and a dog. Upon walking up to the house, the dog
started barking uncontrollably. One of the group members stayed by the
road with the dog, as the rest of us started towards the house. As we
walked up, we heard very unusual screeching that after a few minutes
turned into growling. (which may have been an animal) We then entered
the house and saw all kinds of sadistic drawings on the walls. Above
us, on the second floor, glass started to break, along with loud short
thumps. We started to head up the steps towards a closed door. As one
of the members started to open the door, it slammed back in their face
and the growling started again. At that point everyone took off down
the steps and back out to the road. I've yet to go back to that place.
There have also been rumors of a little boy standing in the vacant
field along the road at night. And if you happen to park on that road
at night, you'll hear taps and knocks coming from the outside of your
car.<br>

My Personal Experience<br>
<br>
By: PPNOSHOW@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I used to live in Omaha, Nebraska, but since moved.&nbsp; My husband
and me bought our house back in 1980.&nbsp; After doing some research
on the house, we found out it used to be a brothel back in the early
1900's.&nbsp; A young boy (about 15) was murdered in the house.&nbsp;
His name was Brian.&nbsp; He has never bothered us except for the
normal pranks he used to pull.<br>
My grandson was 2 when he first saw him.&nbsp; He was playing on the
floor...all of a sudden he stopped...looked-up...and started to nod
yes.&nbsp; We asked who he was looking at, and he said
"Superman".&nbsp; Another time we were all sitting down, watching TV,
when we heard someone whistling "Amazing Grace".&nbsp; We all looked at
each other to see who was doing it...no-one was.&nbsp; Then there was
the time that he answered my "French Provincial" phone.&nbsp; Now the
handset is very heavy, but it jumped right off the base.&nbsp; Another
time my grandson was asleep.&nbsp; All of a sudden he started
crying.&nbsp; We went in there and asked him what was wrong.&nbsp; He
said " There was a man sitting in his chair".&nbsp; My daughter has
also seen him.&nbsp; He actually has followed her outside the
house.&nbsp; Later we found out he was her protector.<br>
The best one was, one night I fell asleep on the couch watching
TV.&nbsp; I heard the kitchen door open and I heard someone coming down
the stairs.&nbsp; It was loud enough to wake me up.&nbsp; Anyway, I
heard a woman say "Oh...you're home".&nbsp; No-one was home except me
and my husband...go figure.&nbsp; So I had my head covered and I just
listened.&nbsp; The kitchen chairs started moving (they were on rollers
on a wood floor), the cupboard doors would open and close, like they
were looking for something.&nbsp; I had about enough...uncovered my
head...there was nothing there.&nbsp; It wasn't the TV, because the
show that was on was a war movie...in the jungle.&nbsp; Hmmm, no
cupboards, chairs or wood floor in that movie.<br>
I felt very sad when we sold the house.&nbsp; I stood in the kitchen
talking to Brian...telling him we will miss him, and to take care of
the new owners, and not to scare them...much.<br>
I did have a psychic come in, and she told us all about him.&nbsp; He
was standing next to my daughter while she was talking about him.&nbsp;
We did notice a chill at the same time.&nbsp; He told her he was
murdered and was buried in a potters grave...location unknown.&nbsp; I
still drive by the house and wave and say hi to him.&nbsp; <br>
Thanks for letting me tell my story.<br>

way ) by the front door looking towards me so i kept on walking to my
room to change i stopped before our room doorway thought to myself when
did my uncle come here and i didnt know he was coming here so i walked
back to the doorway that goes to the livingroom and i didnt see a thing
in the livingroom at all. A Few hours later my mom calls and tells me
that my uncle passed away and i go on to tell her that he was here a
few hours ago in Costa Mesa, Ca a few hours ago and she tells me that
he has been in the hospital for a week and passed away in the morning a
hour just before she had called me my family and uncle was living in

My Most Scariest Moment<br>
<br>
By: corazon43@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I was sitting in the living room in front of the hallway where the door
way is at, i wasn't there longer than maybe less than a minute when I
saw on my door way an image if an guilootine those things they use to
chop peoples head off and I was terrified and tried to run but
something pushed me towards it and my head was in between it and felt
my head getting chopped off next thing I know I woke up in front of my
door but I wasn't asleep I was wide awake when that happened. I have
more true stories. My last experiance was when I was 19 I heard
something say my name clearly like you and me and I was alone in my
room and when I heard it I said what!&nbsp; I didnt show any fear and I
havent heard it again.<br>

My Hunting Haunting<br>
<br>
By: v-rodjohnny@sbcglobal.net<br>
<br>
<br>
I was hunting in this place ran by the Conservation in Missouri.&nbsp;
Every time I get to this Cliff overlooking rail tracks and the river I
would get cold and I felt so depressed.&nbsp; I would sit there trying
to understand why.&nbsp; As I would walk away I felt better and better
and I felt warmer.&nbsp; I did this several times, this feeling
consumed me.&nbsp; I wanted to try to help, it felt as if someone or
something was trying to tell me something.&nbsp; In October of 2007 I
was walking along a familiar path, on the way to this site it was 06:30
am.&nbsp; I had bow in hand and I knew this area very well.&nbsp; I was
approaching this time feeling nothing, no coldness, no worries, or
anxiety.&nbsp; The next thing I knew I was laying in a unfamiliar
place.&nbsp; I woke and looked around and had no ideal where I
was.&nbsp; Everything was enhanced and if felt as if something was on
me, watching me.&nbsp; I sat there for a second, I was very thirsty, I
took a drink lit up a cigarette and just felt so alone and depressed I
looked at my watch and it was 10:00am.&nbsp; I heard a train in the
distance North of where I was, and I knew that the sound of a train was
my way home.&nbsp; I walked toward the sound, when I didn't here it
anymore I stopped and waited for another to go by.&nbsp; Almost
immediately there was another and I would walk.&nbsp; I marked my exit
with flags so I wouldn't get turned around and later I could see how I
got there.&nbsp; After two hours I arrived at my car.&nbsp; This really
didn't scare me but another hunter asked me if I was OK. I said yes and
he told me I was pale white and sweating a lot.&nbsp; I looked in my
car mirror and I was really white.&nbsp; Honestly I felt as if someone
died there it felt like it needed my help.&nbsp; I smoked another
cigarette called my wife to tell her I was going to be late and walked
in that direction again where my flags were.&nbsp; I flagged all the
way back 50feet from my car.&nbsp; I walked in that direction and no
flags.&nbsp; I spent another hour there looking and no results, I knew
where I put the last flag it was by a old tree stand.&nbsp; Nothing, I
got in my car seen a doctor the next day, I wanted a EKG, a brain scan
and my heart looked at.&nbsp; I was thinking I got sick and passed out
or something, although that didn't explain why I ended up where I
did.&nbsp; My bill of health came back perfect. My heart good, no head
trauma, EKG was perfect and my stress test turned out to be fine as
well.&nbsp; This year 2008 deer season again in September.&nbsp; I took
my brother-n-law to this area after telling him so much about it.&nbsp;
I was walking and for the life of me could not find the spot and he
thinks I am crazy and mentioned Aliens while laughing.&nbsp; Its not
like I didn't come here before I had a beaten path.&nbsp; A week later
I went back and took off again this time I went right back to it, like
nothing.&nbsp; Again I felt cold and depressed.&nbsp; I sat there for a
second and asked if someone needs my help let me know make a
sound.&nbsp; Nothing but I felt sick and sorry to gross you out but
vomited.&nbsp; I looked off in the distance and seen something looking
at me over this log.&nbsp; I don't know what it was, but it wasn't a
animal.&nbsp; I felt more scared then than I ever have felt in my life
the woods felt Evil like just like before.&nbsp; I ran into a life long
friend about a week later I was still feeling bad, you know sick and
worried.&nbsp; While talking to him I asked about a couple of our
friends all of us very tight in life.&nbsp; He looked upset a bit, and
then he just broke down and told me that a year ago he was hunting in
another part of Missouri and seen and felt pretty much like I
was.&nbsp; One of our buddies spent all of his time at the library,
lost this job and now is in therapy.&nbsp; My friend telling me this
got divorced turned to drugs and is not very stable.&nbsp; The other
turned to&nbsp; Christianity and is still troubled by what he felt and
seen.&nbsp; Makes me think growing up did we unleash something, do
something that could of caused this feeling.&nbsp; I can be outside
anywhere in the woods and feel this still today. I can look at clouds
and see faces angry faces, I can sit in the bathroom and look at the
tile and see the same thing.&nbsp; Maybe its in my mind but I really do
think that growing up we disturbed something what it is I don't know
but somehow someway I will find out.&nbsp; I am going back to this
place Tuesday November the 11th and I guess I will ask questions I have
written down.&nbsp; I am also going to bring a tape recorder and a
Movie camera.&nbsp; I just wanted to share this with you guys, and for
anyone else that feels like me, your not alone.<br>

My Haunting<br>
<br>
By: Jonathan.Hungerford@Colorado.EDU<br>
<br>
I was on a road trip back in 2007 and was driving through Rapid City
South Dakota and read on your site that the Alex Johnson hotel was
haunted. We decided to stay there and here is what happened. <br>
We were in the Alex Johnson hotel in Rapid City South Dakota and i
guess its the oldest hotel in the area. Its about 70 years old and 10
stories tall. This hotel is the definition of all the creepy hotels you
see in the movies. I had heard that a woman jumped out the window and
killed herself on her wedding night at this hotel and room 812 where
she stayed that night is supposed to be haunted. So this night at
around 1:30am in the morning my friends Jon, William and I decide to go
do some ghost hunting. We take the elevator to the basement which was
creepy because there was all these random tables with the stereotypical
white sheets over them shadowed by dark rooms. We decide to go to floor
2 and on floor 2 there are all these old ballrooms and dining halls.
William opened the door to the "Lincoln dining hall" and all of a
sudden the elevator door opens.....theres no one in it, all of us go in
it probably thinking that one of us pressed the button. On the way up
we realized&nbsp; t!<br>
hat no body pressed a button and it just opened on its own, not to
mention once we got in the elevator, it just started going up without
us even choosing a floor. The elevator stops on floor 6 and the doors
open...we have no idea what to do so we just look around the sixth
floor and everything was kinda creepy but nothing out of the
ordinary...there wasn't much going on but the only thing making noise
was a pepsi machine. Then we walk down the hall and look around and see
this creepy red chair in the hallway. Jon started to sit down when i
heard the elevator about to open....we all kinda paused and then we
hear HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA this really deep man's laugh coming from inside
the elevator. The odd thing was that we were only on the floor for 30
seconds or so and the elevator door that opened was the one we took
down. There was no way anyone could be in it and there was no way it
could have been opened by anyone on the floor because we were the only
one's on that floor. I kno&nbsp; w!<br>
the deep laugh sounds corny but it sounded different than anything I've heard and I have never ran away so fast in my life. <br>
Thanks for the site I love it. I definitely check it to see where all the haunted places are around me.<br>

My Grandfather <br>
<br>
By: Freedomusa08@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This event occurred on a sunny afternoon in July of 1978. I'll
try&nbsp; my best to explain it. After my grandfathers death in April
of 78 I was staying with my grandmother in their home. I was 23 at the
time and walking from my bedroom into the dining room and for some
reason I looked in to the living room which was illuminated by the Sun
coming through the window. At first i thought i was imagining my
grandfathers presence in the living room. I walked in to the edge of
the room and there he was kind of floating in the air above me and
seemed somewhat transparent. He appeared to be in very robust health
and dressed in his favorite flannel shirt(even though it was a hot
summer day) and was smiling at me. To be perfectly honest i don't
believe he actually talked to me,but he did somehow communicate with
me. He told me he was proud of me for staying with my grandmother and
that he always knew he could count on me. He said Robert don't ever
fear death. It's great. I didn't see anyone else with him,but i sensed
he was not alone. This whole meeting probably only lasted 15 to 20
seconds and then he was gone. I did possibly have some other
experiences with him and then years later after my Dad passed away i
think he made contact with me a few times as well. But nothing like the
experience that day in my grandparents living room. I give everyone
reading this my word that this event happened to me. Thanks for reading
this ! <br>

My Ghost Stories<br>
<br>
<br>
By: marian_sobke@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
<br>
I first started seeing and hearing ghosts when I was about 8 yrs
old.&nbsp; We lived in London for a short period of time when my dad
was in the Air Force, before we got into base housing.&nbsp; The place
looked like a castle to an 8 yr old.&nbsp; It was huge.&nbsp; This was
where I first started hearing things.<br>
Several years later my parents split up and we were back in the
States.&nbsp; We were living in an older house in Afton,
Missouri.&nbsp; That's when I started seeing people.&nbsp; There was a
tall black man that would come and stand at the end of my bed.&nbsp; I
wasn't scared of him.&nbsp; He was a nice man.&nbsp; {By the way----I
am NOT prejudiced!}&nbsp; <br>
I've seen and heard many ghosts in the many homes I've lived in over
the years, but the one that gets me most is when we moved to Florida.<br>
This is our 3rd and last home here (I hope).&nbsp; It started with our
1st one here.&nbsp; We were renters and smoking was prohibited inside
the house so I would go out to the lanai to have a cigarette.&nbsp; I
would see all these people EVERYWHERE&nbsp; (100's of people!).&nbsp;
At first I thought I was just crazy but later realized they needed my
help.&nbsp; I had seen a couple of them walk through the house and into
my bedroom.&nbsp; I really felt they needed my help as they couldn't
find the way out.&nbsp; These were all dark complected people (not that
it makes a difference).&nbsp; They asked me where they were supposed to
go.&nbsp; I said to follow the light, which was apparently in my
bedroom.&nbsp; Most of them eventually did go through.&nbsp; I did ask
what had happened and was told that there was a lot of shaking and
rumbling.&nbsp; {I've tried to research this and found 2 earthquakes in
Florida way back in the 1800's, I think---but they were a long ways
away from here.}&nbsp; {I&#8217;ve also tried to research&nbsp; Flooding&#8212;to
no avail.}<br>
One evening I was sitting on the lanai with my husband and saw a man
and a woman on opposite sides of the lanai, dressed in the older
clothes---remember Little House on the Prairie?---dressed like
that.&nbsp; My husband was with me and didn't see them, but I saw them
plain as day!&nbsp;&nbsp; I should point out that these 2 were light
complected.&nbsp; I wonder if the others were slaves??? <br>
A few months later, I was visiting my kids in Kansas and hubby was on
the lanai by himself---alone in the house too.&nbsp; He called me
telling me that he finally believed me because the lanai sliding doors
started rattling for absolutely no reason.&nbsp; No sonic boom, no
earthquake, no wind.&nbsp; No explanation.<br>
There was also a little girl dressed in the old attire that would stand
outside the lanai and watch us.&nbsp; I got her name, but for the life
of me can&#8217;t remember it right now.&nbsp; Madeline something, I think.<br>
When we moved to the second house in Florida I had the urge to go back
to the first house.&nbsp; This was a half a block away.&nbsp; I'm not
sure why I just HAD to go talk to someone.&nbsp; There was the little
girl from the first house (maybe the daughter of the couple I
saw?).&nbsp; She wanted help.&nbsp; She followed me home and
disappeared the next day.&nbsp; To this day, I don't know if I helped
or not.&nbsp; I do go back to that house a couple of times a week (I
work for the new tenants) and haven't seen her since.&nbsp; I had seen
people at that second house but not near as many as from the first one!<br>
Now, we are in our final house---I HOPE.&nbsp; I've seen a tall man
here, usually in the laundry room but I've seen him in my kitchen as
well.&nbsp; I hear both him and the woman that I haven't seen yet,
calling my name.&nbsp; I also hear growling occasionally.&nbsp; I think
it's my dogs or cats and check on them, but it's not them.&nbsp; By the
way, this house is about 8 miles from the previous 2.<br>
I really think this all has to do with something that happened in Punta
Gorda MANY years ago.&nbsp; Since I moved to Florida, this has been the
most activity I've seen in my whole life (I'm 46).&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;m
still trying to do research on this, but am coming up empty handed so
far.<br>

MALTBY CEMETARY "THE 13 STEPSTO HELL"<br>
<br>
By: nicolehambrecht@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
I GREW UP IN MONROE AND WAS 14 YEARS OLD AND A FRESHMAN IN HIGH SCHOOL
IN 1994. I HUNG OUT WITH THE GROUP OF KIDS CONSIDERED THE "STONERS" WE
WERE THE COOL/ POPULAR KIDS THAT SKIPPED SCHOOL AND PARTIED ALL THE
TIME. MOST OF THE KIDS I HUNG OUT WITH WERE OLDER, IS THE POINTING THAT
I'M TRYING TO GET TOO. WE PARTIED IN ALLOT OF DIFFERENT PUBLIC PLACES
SUCH AS 'PIPELINE' OUTSIDE OF MONROE OR 'THE MALTBY TRACKS' (AN AREA OF
RAILROAD TRACKS ALONG A CERTAIN STRETCH IN MALTBY). I HAVE ONLY BEEN TO
THE MALT BY CEMETERY ONCE AND DO NOT CARE TO GO BACK. I WAS TOLD THE
STORY BY TWO OF MY FRIENDS WHO WERE SENIORS AND ABOUT 17 OR 18 AT THE
TIME. THERE WAS A SET OF 13 CEMENT STAIRS THAT WENT ALMOST STRAIT DOWN
INTO THE GROUND AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS THERE WAS A FLAT CEMENT
AREA ABOUT 5' BY 5' FEET . THIS FLAT AREA WAS ACTUALLY THE 13TH STEP.
SO IF YOU WERE TO COUNT THEM THERE WERE ACTUALLY 12 STEPS AND THE
"LANDING" AT THE BOTTOM WAS THE 13TH "STEP" . YOU COULD GO THERE DURING
THE DAY AND GO DOWN THE STEPS, STANDING AT THE BOTTOM ALL THERE WAS WAS
THE THREE SIDES OF THE CEMENT WALLS ONE IN THE FRONT OF YOU AND ONE ON
EACH SIDE AND THEN THE FLOOR, THE STAIRS BEHIND YOU AND LOOKING UP I
GUESS IT WAS ABOUT 12 OR 15 FEET DEEP? BUT IF YOU WENT THERE AT NIGHT
ON A CERTAIN NIGHT OF THE YEAR ( DID NOT SAY WHEN,&nbsp; MAYBE ANY
RANDOM NIGHT OR MAYBE SOMETHING CHEESY LIKE HALLOWEEN ? ) YOU COULD
WALK DOWN THE 12 STEPS BUT THERE WAS&nbsp;&nbsp; - NO - 13TH STEP. THIS
THEY SWORE TO ME THAT THEY HAD BOTH EXPERIENCED TOGETHER. THEY SAID YOU
COULD KNEEL DOWN ON THE 12TH STEP AND REACH AS FAR DOWN AS YOU COULD
AND FEEL NOTHING. THEY SAID THE WALLS WERE ALL STILL THERE,&nbsp; BUT
THE BOTTOM '13TH STEP' WAS GONE . NOW I ASKED THEM WHAT HAPPENED IF YOU
THREW A ROCK DOWN IN THERE?&nbsp; AND THAT'S WHEN THEY SAID THAT THEY
DID NOT TRY IT. THEY SAID THEY HAD BEEN THERE AT THE '13 STEPS' FOR
MAYBE A TOTAL OF FIVE MINUTES , AMAZED BY THE FACT THAT THE BOTTOM STEP
WAS GONE!&nbsp; WHEN ALL OF THE SUDDEN&nbsp; THEY BOTH FELT THE MOST
OVERWHELMING FEELING OF DREAD AND FEAR THAT THEY HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED
IN THERE LIVES. ONE OF THEM WAS AT THE BOTTOM STEP AND THE OTHER ONE AT
THE TOP STANDING OUT SIDE WHEN THEY BOTH WERE OVERCOME BY IT!&nbsp; MY
FRIEND AT THE BOTTOM FLEW UP AND OUT OF THE STEPS RUNNING AWAY, MY
OTHER FRIEND WAS ABOUT 20 FEET AHEAD OF HIM. THE BOY AT THE BOTTOM SAID
HE FELT THE OVERWHELMING FEAR AND HAD HAD THE DISTINCT FEELING ALL THAT
SOMETHING WAS ABOUT TO GRAB HIM AND PULL HIM IN. "IN" I ASKED
him?&nbsp; NOT "DOWN", HE SAID PULL HIM "IN" WAS THE ONLY WAY TO
DESCRIBE THE FEELING. THEY RUSHED TO THE CAR AND TOOK OFF. WELL I
THOUGHT THEY WERE FULL OF IT!&nbsp; AND THEY SAID THEY SWORE ON THERE
SOULS IT WAS NOT MADE UP. THESE WERE BOTH BIG STRONG GUYS. THE WHOLE
REASON THE STORY CAME UP IS BECAUSE A RUMOR WAS GOING AROUND MONROE
HIGH SCHOOL. THE RUMOR WAS THAT THEY HAD FILLED IN THE STEPS . WELL MY
FRIENDS SAID THEY HAD NEVER BEEN BACK THERE SINCE&nbsp; AND NEVER WOULD
GO THERE AGAIN. A COUPLE WEEKS LATER WE ALL DROVE THERE ON A SUNNY DAY.
(THEY WOULD NOT GO AT NIGHT AND NEITHER WOULD I)&nbsp; AND SURE ENOUGH
THE STEPS WERE FILLED IN WITH DIRT. THROUGHOUT HIGH SCHOOL AND EVEN
AFTER SINCE IVE MOVED INTO SEATTLE I STILL HAVE HEARD OF THE STEPS FROM
OTHER PEOPLE. NOW PEOPLE SAY THAT SOMETIMES AT NIGHT YOU CAN GO THERE
AND THE STEPS ARE THE SAME AS THEY WERE , EMPTY OF DIRT AND BOTTOMLESS.
OTHER NIGHTS THEY ARE FILLED IN. EVERYONE AT MY SCHOOL BACK THEN CALLED
THEM "THE 13 STEPS TO HELL". NICOLE H.&nbsp; <br>

Haunting ,Ghost Story<br>
<br>
By: wkdfire53@yahoo.com <br>
This story is quite recent. I lived, until about 3 weeks ago, in a good
sized house in Antioch, Ca. It was me and a few roommates who decided
to share rent. This was the first time I had moved out on my own so I
was just excited to be out. I didn't bother questioning about prior
occupants or history. My room was the first room in the hallway of
rooms if you enter from the front door. From the first night I stayed
there it was always cold near the closet and I never liked sleeping
with the closet door open. Many nights it would seem to open itself
despite my placing things against it. I thought it was maybe the house
was built on a slant but none of my roommates had reported their doors
opening at weird times in the night. I would be the only one home but
distinctly hear footsteps and doors closing when there were no breezes.
I would hear tv's on and then when I looked, there were no tv's on.
When my now fiance started staying there with me, I started having
weird dreams as well. I'd dream there was someone watching me, with no
face, just staring. Then I'd wake and my closet would again be open. So
I'd close it and go back to sleep.&nbsp; One night, I had just laid
down to sleep and turned off my television for the night. I had been
lying there, maybe an hour or so, before I remember it getting harder
to breathe. I attempted to sit up but found that I could not move. The
harder I struggled, the more it was difficult to breathe. During this
time, I saw no dark figures, no ominous eyes, no hazy shadows. Just the
feeling of dread, of complete dread. And what seemed to be the sound of
the closet door opening and closing. I stayed ther for another 3 months
before moving out. And glad to say away from whatever it was that tried
to smother me that night.<br>

Haunted House<br>
<br>
By: john.p.morse@us.army.mil<br>
<br>
My son and his new bride moved into a small house in Wetumpka, Al.
Started out hearing footsteps going from the living room to the
kitchen. There was a loud noise like someone throwing a big book on the
floor. The lamp in the living came on by itself. We had the house
blessed and things quieted down for a couple of weeks. Then it came
back with a vengeance. My dauhter-in-law was in the bathroom and saw a
dark mist at the ceiling. It quickly went into the attic.<br>
My son was at the computer and felt like someone was behind him. He
turned to see the figure of a man looking at him and it quickly
disappeared. The final sighting that drove them from the house, my
daughter-in-law saw the figure of a man on his hands and knees and in a
black mist crawling from the closet. It made eye contact with her and
quickly went under the kitchen table and disappeared. As they were
leaving the house that night there was a very loud noise like someone
ran into the wall. Some co-workers and myself went to the house and my
friend saw the black mist in the closet and it spoke to him. It said
"leave me alone".<br>

Haunted<br>
<br>

&nbsp;<br>
The First Christian Church that is often used for rehersals for ACMT.
It is said that the owners of the church, an old married couple, had to
rent the church out because they needed the money. The only problem is
that the wife didn't want to do this so she kept trying to scare the
people away from the church. During Peter Pan rehersals people looked
through the window of the little room that was inbetween the rec. room
and the church hall to see something white flying around the room. No
one ever went into the small room untill someone noticed that it was
only a white T shirt that was suspended from the fan. Also, when I was
in Into the Woods, she would be caught lurking around. It was break
when we went into the small room and heard the Organ playing. There was
no one in the hall that we could see. Then, all of a sudden, she is
right up close to the window, smiling a waving. Then a few weeks later
when everyone were sure that she wasn't there, a few of the cast
members were in the room. It was almost 10:00 PM and the only light in
the hall was what was coming from the window in the little room. And
then someone noticed that all of a sudden there was one of the Bibles
missing and we were sure that it was there before.<br>

My First Experience<br>
<br>
By: corazon43@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
My first experiance when I was 5 years old and I remember it vividly.
My grandmother was catholic and she had those statues of jesus and the
virgin Mary and a few other statues on top of the dresser in my room
they were about 2 inches tall;&nbsp; when i would wake up in the middle
of the night because I heard people talking I saw the statues moving
and talking I was so scared that I burried myself under the covers
until it stopped. One time I woke up in the middle of the night with a
white rat at the edge of my bed board and we never had rodents the rat
just looked at me for a few minutes and disapeared. I went to the
bathroom one time early morning so everyone was still asleep I went to
go urinate and left the bathroom door open when I looked to my right a
huge black entity was looking at me it was daylight this entity was
pure black and vivid no face at all and I shut the door so fast and
screamed so hard but no one heard me until a few minutes later I&nbsp;
tried turning on the light and it wouldnt turn on. There was time I
fell asleep in the living room I heard an eerie laughter and saw images
of 4 entities behind the sofa and I was pushed off the sofa I felt them
pushing me as if was you or me doing it. I have more stories but its
more scary.<br>

Balloon Message<br>
<br>
<br>
By: alkavariel@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
Our son was ripped from our lives 5 years ago by the local police. He
was not comitting a crime, he was holding 2 short sticks up to form a
cross and the police killed him because "they feared for their lives".
My husband and I stopped in our local grocery store the January
following his death in November. Chris would go to this store all the
time to buy his snacks for the day. He also tried applying for a job
there because he liked one of the cashiers. <br>
When we first walked in, my eyes were drawn to a ballon at the florist
section that was floating floor level. I thought, "Oh, that balloon is
losing its lift". Later when I was standing in line next to the florist
section, my husband ran to get some batteries. I noticed "someone" out
of the corner of my eye, approaching me. I glanced over and it was the
balloon slowly floating over to me. I thought, now that's funny. Why is
it floating to me? The balloon said "I Love You" because it was January
and all the Valentine balloons were out. I took the balloon and tied it
to a display of about 7 balloons. My husband and I continued to look at
the balloons wondering is this Chris sending us a sign. They were
jostling around because of air currents, when suddenly each and every
balloon turned towards us and held for a few seconds. Now imagine
looking at 7 balloons all facing you and all saying "I Love You". I
thought, "Is that you, Chris?" "I can't see that little balloon behind
the big balloon." And, when I thought the last, the little balloon
moved from behind the big balloon and also faced us. I think of death
now as when I was little girl standing on the high dive - scared, but
anticipating the thrill of jumping into the water. <br>
