<b>Our Ghost Bill</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: smann@achala.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Bill was a very tall and husky black man who wore overalls and a
straw hat.&nbsp; This is what my ten-year-old daughter says anyway.&nbsp;
I have never actually saw Bill even though I would speak to him every once
in a while when I thought he was trying to scare me.&nbsp; One night my
mother, my children, and I were sitting in the living room watching television.&nbsp;
There are stairs with a door that is usually closed in the summertime to
keep the cool air from the window air conditioner downstairs.&nbsp; The
stairs lead to the upstairs bedrooms where myself and my two children each
have our own rooms.&nbsp; Too many visits from Bill keeps my daughter in
bed with me usually every night.&nbsp; Knowing his sister is in bed with
me keeps my five-year-old son there too.&nbsp; It's just not fair you know.&nbsp;
Bill doesn't visit my son for some reason.&nbsp; Or, my son doesn't tell
me about it if he does.&nbsp; Anyway, back to watching television.&nbsp;
My mother and I were sure that there wasn't anyone else in the house.&nbsp;
We both looked over at the stairs at the same time and looked directly
back at each other to reassure ourselves that we were both hearing the
same thing.&nbsp; The door was open just a hair and we could swear it was
about to blast open at any second.&nbsp; The footsteps were louder than
if it were myself or my mother coming down the stairs.&nbsp; They obviously
belonged to someone much bigger than us.&nbsp; Holding our breath we waited
but the noise stopped when it reached the bottom.&nbsp; The door did not
open, but we did not hear a retreat.&nbsp; I asked my mom if she was going
to get up, or was I going to have to do it.&nbsp; She said she wasn't going
anywhere near that door.&nbsp; I went over to the door and opened it quickly
and took several running steps backward expecting to find someone standing
there.&nbsp; No one--my mom and I laughed at each other and she said I
wonder who the heck that was.&nbsp; My daughter calmly and casually said
that was just Bill.&nbsp; Of course we asked Danielle (my daughter) many
questions regarding Bill.&nbsp; She told us what he looked like and that
he would just appear sometimes, usually in her bedroom, but didn't say
anything.&nbsp; She didn't feel threatened by him.&nbsp; I would have written
it off completely thinking she saw a movie or something if I had not heard
someone on the steps so often.&nbsp; When I decided to "face reality" and
came to the conclusion that we did have a ghost, was after this next experience.</b>
<br><b>The house we live in is pretty old and we do not have a shower so
we have to run baths.&nbsp; One morning, before the kids were awake, I
was running my bath.&nbsp; I had just turned off the water and was going
into the kitchen to make coffee.&nbsp; I thought I heard a splashing sound
come from the bathroom.&nbsp; On my way to the bathroom I noticed large
wet footprints in the carpet.&nbsp; I reached the bathroom and the water
in the tub was moving back and forth like someone just got out of it.&nbsp;
At first I thought it must have been one of my kids.&nbsp; Why one of my
kids would want to get in bath water at 5:00 in the morning was a total
shock to me.&nbsp; I went upstairs to my bed (where they were both sleeping)
and pulled the covers back.&nbsp; I was really shocked because they were
both sound asleep.&nbsp; There was no one else in the house so it had to
be Bill.&nbsp; It freaked me out having to get in that tub knowing someone
or something else was just in it.</b>
<br><b>One more thing.&nbsp; I have a fear of dying naked.&nbsp; I am telling
you I would rather be torn to pieces by wild animals than be found by firemen
or cops or someone dead and naked.&nbsp; I think Bill knows this.&nbsp;
Above the tub is a large cupboard that fell off when I was taking a bath
one day.&nbsp; I was laying down in the tub washing my hair.&nbsp; With
my eyes closed and my hearing impaired, due to being under water, I somehow
knew the cupboard was falling.&nbsp; I put my arms up and barely was able
to keep this thing from drowning me.&nbsp; It was extremely heavy and I
managed to somehow push it over the side of the tub to let it land on the
floor.&nbsp; My mother showed up later and couldn't believe I was able
to get it off of myself while I was laying down in such an awkward position.&nbsp;
I told her I must have developed super human strength when I was being
faced with my worst fear.&nbsp; We both laughed it off again and later
I told Bill thanks for helping me out.</b>
<br><b>I can handle ghosts like Bill.&nbsp; What I can't handle, or even
tell you about, is other stories from my childhood that I must keep to
myself.&nbsp; I've been told if you have too much of an open mind you might
let things in that you don't want to know about.&nbsp; I choose to pretend
the visions I've had as a child and the things I witnessed are just a figment
of my over-active imagination.&nbsp; Either way I don't want anything coming
back to haunt me.</b>

<p><b>Mysterious Foul Odor....</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By:artwins@thegrid.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Here is my story in which I am very interested in getting to the
bottom</b>
<br><b>of.&nbsp; It started shortly after my family and I moved into our
new home.</b>
<br><b>It's a large ranch style home built in '81, so not that old, and
it's in</b>
<br><b>town at the end of a cult-a-sac.&nbsp; We moved in at the end of
March 2000,</b>
<br><b>and first noticed the odor the end of April 2000.</b>
<br><b>The smell always stays in our living room around the fireplace,
which we</b>
<br><b>do have an antique mantel, or on the stair case, from bottom to
top but</b>
<br><b>never any further.</b>
<br><b>I'll try to get the highlights... when I along with some friends
and</b>
<br><b>family were in our living room; we had just had a birthday party
for our</b>
<br><b>kids so a lot was going on, we first smelt the odor.&nbsp; We simply
thought</b>
<br><b>that something like a dead animal was trapped in the fireplace,
or</b>
<br><b>perhaps under the house.&nbsp; We sprayed some airfreshener, and
basically</b>
<br><b>forgot about it.&nbsp; Then about a month later my husband and I
smelled it</b>
<br><b>again, we were sniffing around trying to pin point the source, but
never</b>
<br><b>could, at that point I was starting to think how strange that was...how</b>
<br><b>sometimes it was there then not.&nbsp; However still I basically
forgot about</b>
<br><b>it, then one day our cousin and my husband were installing a whole
house</b>
<br><b>fan which is directly above the stairs leading towards the second
floor.</b>
<br><b>This is when it really hit us that we have some sort of porterguiest</b>
<br><b>dwelling in our house.&nbsp; The guys were working on some electrical
stuff,</b>
<br><b>they were focused at the light switch at the bottom of the stairs
and</b>
<br><b>things weren't going their way...I made the comment "oh it probably
has</b>
<br><b>something to do with that odor we've been smelling we probably have
a</b>
<br><b>ghost", right after I said that our cousin said you mean the odor
I'm</b>
<br><b>smelling right now?&nbsp; I swore he was pulling my leg, I thought
no way</b>
<br><b>could it be their now, but it was. It totally freaked me out.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>communicated to it, I said ok we got that your here, why don't you
move</b>
<br><b>on etc. find the nearest hospital and pick up a new body, move</b>
<br><b>on.....etc.etc. later that evening we were down stairs, I was trying
to</b>
<br><b>gather myself, and be calm, for I had never experienced anything
like</b>
<br><b>that before so I was a bit tripped out.&nbsp; The house shook a
bit, and it</b>
<br><b>sounded like footsteps above where my sons room is, yet he was sleeping</b>
<br><b>in our room.&nbsp; The light flickered, and then didn't work right.&nbsp;
At one</b>
<br><b>point that night I did feel a warm feeling like I felt that it meant
no</b>
<br><b>harm, and I honestly felt love.</b>
<br><b>It took about two weeks for me to come to grips with our household</b>
<br><b>friend.&nbsp; Nothing has happened like that one night since, I
think that it</b>
<br><b>was just really making sure that we got that it was here.&nbsp;
Now we still</b>
<br><b>get the odor, it comes and goes.&nbsp; I have no emotional ties
any longer</b>
<br><b>and am not even afraid. Basically I've talked to it and have made
it</b>
<br><b>clear that we are happy and the house is fine etc. you may move
on etc.</b>
<br><b>Just when I think it's got, like maybe 3 weeks have past, boom it
shows</b>
<br><b>up again, I have taken some pictures but haven't got them developed</b>
<br><b>yet.</b>
<br><b>The other night two of my neices were here, my 3yr old some, and
twins,</b>
<br><b>boy &amp; girl, and they were all in the living room playing around
when it</b>
<br><b>shows up.&nbsp; My neices think its cool they were totally playing
around,</b>
<br><b>and it seemed to be playing as well.&nbsp; It's strange my 1&amp;1/2
yr. old son</b>
<br><b>kept pointing to it, and he would be right on the smell would just
move</b>
<br><b>around.</b>
<br><b>Have you heard of similar strange phenomenom?</b>

<p><b>House Builder</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: TingTingSista@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello. I'm Kyli and I'm fourteen years old. I'm
going to try my best to tell you my entire story without making it too
long to read. In the winter of 1980, my mom and her husband (at the time)
moved into a house on a friendly, pleasant street. The first day they moved
in there, numerous things happened wrong. First off, my sister Cindy ended
up finding out that she had the measles. Secondly, my brother Todd had
a very high fever and had to be taken to the hospital that night. The electricity
in the house would not work</b>
<br><b>and this made my whole family rather upset.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mom began to resent the house,
for no particular reason. She'd complaint to her husband about it so much
that they'd end up violently arguing. He had an emotional attachment to
the house in less than a week, while my mom was the exact opposite and
felt she needed to leave. Regardless of my mom's feelings, she ended up
staying there for another twelve years. There are a few incidents that
I'd like to focus on particularily.</b>
<br><b>Incident #1- When my mom and her husband first purchased the house,
my brother was just a baby. One night, after hearing sounds coming from
the attic, my mom got up from bed to check everything out. Although she
did not spot anybody or anything in the attic, she did find a man (who
she can describes rather specifically (Blonde hair, brown eyes, and work
clothing), he was entering my brother's room. My mom was so shocked to
see him that she started to scream and blocked the door to my brother's
room. Her husband</b>
<br><b>heard the yelling and came downstairs to see what was the matter,
and all he saw was my mom blocking my brother's door. My mom says that
as soon as her husband came downstairs, the ghost disappeared. The police
came but did not find any evidence of anybody being there.Incident #2-
My brother (at 5 years old) began complaining that there was a man living
in his wall. When my mom calmly asked him why he thought this, he replied
"You know..you saw him when I was a baby...the man who lives in my</b>
<br><b>wall. He eats in there, sleeps in there, everything."My mom was
very frightened, but after consulting the child physician about the matter,
she was told that he probably had 'imaginery friends'. Incident #3- I was
born in 1985, to my mother's third husband, Howard. My mom tells me that
I was a horrible baby, who would never stop crying. When I was three years
old, I became rather curious by the attic (since my parents told</b>
<br><b>me not to go in there), disobeying them, I went up there instead.
An unknown forced pushed me into a car seat (that my mom had recently stored
up there), it locked me in there. For an hour straight, I screamed for
my mother to unlock me, but she had been outside. When she came inside,
she hurridly ran upstairs and unlocked the seat.&nbsp; I had never been
able to use the lock on that carseat, and it would have been impossible
for me to lock myself in there.</b>
<br><b>Incident #4- My cousin Heather and I go outside to look at the clouds.
In these clouds, we spot two figures that barely resemble clouds, but instead..drawn
images. One of a baby...the other of a small dog. We saw them so clearly
that we ran inside crying, only to see that our parents were watching the
news. That same day, a baby and a dog died together...we had seen the images
at the exact time that the deaths were announced.</b>
<br><b>Incident #5- Heather and I always could see the ghost. He was always
around.</b>
<br><b>He enjoyed watching us play with our barbie dolls. He'd stand right
by us as we played, we tried to get him to leave..but he never would. Eventually
we got used to him being there, and were not frightened by it. We never
told our parents about him because we both felt that he wanted us to keep
him a secret.</b>
<br><b>Incident #6-&nbsp; One night my family came running upstairs because
they heard me screaming, my sister says that my screams were so violent,
as if I was being murdered. When they asked me what was wrong, I told them
that someone was in trouble. I told them that a ghost on the wall told
me that someone was dying. I also told them that I kept seeing images of
babies on my ceiling. My family was very frightened. I slept with my parents
that night. The next day, I found out that my teacher (at the time) had
been in a major car accident. She was pregnant at the time, which explains
the images of the babies.</b>
<br><b>Incident #7- My older cousin and I dared my cousin Heather to come
into the attic with us. She would not come up there and so my older cousin
pulled her into the attic with me..and once she was in there, she seemed
fine. My older cousin headed downstairs, leaving me and Heather to search
the attic for my missing doll. We looked everywhere until we heard a LOUD
scream that sounded as if it was coming from a human. We ran downstairs.
Our parents, trying to keep us calm, told us it was probably something
we stepped on. We all knew it wasn't.</b>
<br><b>Incident #7- I continued to look for that doll in the weeks to come..only
to find it outside, torn to shreds.</b>
<br><b>Incident #8- One night, while my sister was watching a late movie.
The rest of us heard her screaming and ran down to see if she was okay.
There was a bat in the house and it was attacking her. She had a towel
over her head and was running from it, shaking and crying. My dad ran after
it with a fishing net, and luckilly was able to get it trapped in our porch.
My sister later told us that it appeared from out of nowhere.</b>
<br><b>Incident #9- A few days after the bat incident, my parents found
a huge nest of wasps in our den. After trying to get away from they, they
were each stung 15-20 times. My brother hid me in the bathroom, because
I'm allergic to bees. Incident #10- My brother became extremely afraid
of insects after the bee incident. My mom was constantly trying to calm
him down about it, but everyday for a week..a nest of gnats gathered in
the corner of his room and would not move.</b>
<br><b>Incident #11- When my mom told me we were moving, I became nautious
and told her that 'a man told me not to leave'. I threatened that if she
followed through with the move, I would hold onto the tree in our yard
and refuse to let go. The day we moved, my parents had to battle with me
to loosen my grip from the tree.</b>
<br><b>Incident #12- People moved in and out of that house forever. The
first couple that moved in, moved out in just a week later.</b>
<br><b>Incident #13- My mom runs into the lady who sold us the house. As
soon as the lady sees my mother, tears fill her eyes. She begins to cry
and tells my mom how sorry she is for letting her buy that house. She too
knew it was haunted and had many bad experiences with it. My mom and she
had a big conversation concerning the whole thing, and the lady told my
mother that, she too, had seen a man with blonde hair, brown eyes, and
work clothing.</b>
<br><b>Incident #14- We find out from my mom's second husband that the
man who built the house died by falling from a ladder. He was not finished
the house, which is obvious..now that we think back to the unfinished stairway.Workclothes.
I wonder if he had blonde hair..and brown eyes.</b>

<p><b>MIMI</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sweet_dreams_1999@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;When I was little, I used to be able to see spirits. I was
never scared of them though.&nbsp; I remember one spirit in particular,
her name was Mimi.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mimi always</b>
<br><b>showed up at nighttime, when I was supposed to be asleep. I had
a habit of having very bad nightmares of people dying, especially my parents.&nbsp;
One night, I woke up sweating and in tears when I thought I saw someone
standing in my doorway.&nbsp; At first I just saw a mist, that then turned
into an old lady.&nbsp; I was able to see through her.&nbsp; At the moment
I didn’t realize it, but it was Mimi who came to check up on me and she
had her little dog with her.&nbsp; I watched as she came near my bed.&nbsp;
When she was standing right next to me (petting her dog), I felt calmness
come over me and I felt so safe with her there. As she sat down on the
corner of my bed, she told me not to fear, that my parents were sound asleep,
safe and sound in their bed. I remember how I still didn’t calm down right
away, I was still crying when she put her dog up on my bed with me.&nbsp;
At the time, I used to call the dog, Pinkie, since you could see the pink
of her skin under her white fur. I remember feeling her pulling the covers
up over me, and telling me that she will let pinkie stay with me to keep
me company until I fell asleep.&nbsp; I watched Mimi as she went into the
hallwayand then fade away.&nbsp; I had my arm around the dog, or where
the dog was supposed to be. Then I dozed off right to sleep.&nbsp; I heard
from Mimi almost every single night since then, until my 10th or 11th birthday.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I had been playing games with my cousins when we decided to have a race
to see who would get outside the fastest.&nbsp; They let me have a head
start since it was my birthday. As I headed up the stairs, I heard them
right behind me.&nbsp; All the grown ups were outside at the time.&nbsp;
I ran through the kitchen and went to hit the door handle to go outside,
but I missed it.&nbsp; Instead of opening the door, I went right through
the glass back door.&nbsp; Glass was every where; I had cuts all over the
place and bleeding.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone told me to hold still, I had family
members running around the house, to get to the front door so they can
help me.&nbsp; They were all barefoot, but walked on the glass anyway.&nbsp;
My father had a bat in his hands, as he told me to stay very still and
not move.&nbsp; I just kept looking straight ahead at my mom when I heard
Mimi in front of me.&nbsp; I was unable to see her though but all I did
was cry as I heard and felt my dad breaking the glass that surrounded my
neck. After I was free from the door, my mother rushed me to the bathroom
to make sure I wasn’t seriously hurt and to clean me up.&nbsp; The whole
time, I knew that I had “my Mimi” with me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a piece of
glass in my forehead, which my mom had to take out.&nbsp; Ever since that
day, I haven’t been able to see spirits.&nbsp; I was told that since that
piece of glass was in the middle of my forehead, that my third eye was
damaged.&nbsp; Even though I can’t see&nbsp; them anymore, I wish I could
but at least I can still hear them.&nbsp; I haven’t heard from Mimi in
a long time, but I am certain that she is watching over me just like when
I was little.</b>

<p><b>My Nana</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: digitalrich@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Now, the story I'm about to relate is unnerving to me, However, to
you it may not be. In fact it may not have been real at all, But it sure
seemed real to me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; My Mom's mother ( Nanny ) lived with us for as long as I
can remember, So naturally my brother and I were very close to her. She
past away from bone cancer in October of 1993, it was very disconcerting
because the woman she was at the end was not the woman she was in life.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; In December of 1996, I was home for the Christmas Holiday
from college. I was staying in my old room. My parents were being transferred
to Texas shortly, so alot of things were packed up. My room was completely
bare except for my desk and my bunk beds. My bunks were set up in an L
shape. Normally I would sleep on the bottom bunk but I had the materess
at school. So I was sleeping on the top bunk, it was about 11, 11:30 in
the am and I was somewhere between awake and sleep. When somebody leaned
over me and kissed me on the side of my head and said "be my angel tonight".
It woke me wide awake. I sat up looked around and said "Nanny"? I knew
it was her. I swear that that woman was in the room with me. And its a
dead certain feeling not even something that I can explain. I went downstairs
and had breakfast. While having breakfast I chatted with my mother about
what happened, we both chalked it up to a very vivid dream.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Well, this happened the monday before New Years. That Wednesday
I took my Dad's car and went to hang out with my then girlfreind. We were
driving around and had gotten into an arguement. I was on an unfamiliar
road and with the combo of not paying attention, I ran a stop sign. We
were hit by a car going about 50 miles an hour. The car hit us so hard
that it sent our car about 65-70 feet and split the radiator in half. The
car had hit on my side, The police said that if the car had hit 3 inches
closer I would have been killed instantly. I walked out with a minor cut
on my arm and a brise on my hip, My girlfreind bruised her collar bone.
And the other weird thing was that there was other traffic in the opposite
lane and our car did not get hit.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; How this all ties together? Well, my mom, the night before
I got into the wreck had a dream about my Nanny. So she believes that the
experience I had was her protecting me. A little background, My Great Nana
( my mom's Nana) was a very strong Maternal presence. She had 8 children,
raised them pretty much by herself. My mom and my Nana lived with her for
a long time, so they were very close. My great Nana passed away the day
before I was born. So my mom and nana believed that she died to let me
come into this world. Well, anytime my mom or nana dreamt of my great nana
something bad would follow within a few days. So based on all this my mom
thinks that my nana protected me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I'm not sure what I think, I just know that she was in the
room with me that day...</b>

<p><b>&nbsp; My Life Long Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Penny126934@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Hello there, my name is Penny and I am 31 yrs. old.&nbsp;
I am married and have a five yr. old son.&nbsp; However since about the
age of three I have been doing what ( I like to call ) communicating with
the dead.&nbsp; The first time that I ever saw a ghost I was right around
the age of 3.&nbsp; I was sound asleep in my room when for no apparent
reason I awoke.&nbsp; I rolled over and looked at the doorway to my room
and there was a young woman standing there dressed all in white in what
I thought to be a nightgown.&nbsp; Being three I thought that this woman
looked like my mom, so I asked her what are you doing mom.&nbsp; Well needless
to say she just smiled at me and didn't answer.&nbsp; I asked a couple
of more times and when I didn't get a reply I got mad, so I rolled over
to go back to sleep.&nbsp; I did however look back at the door to see if
( who I thought was my mom) was still standing there.&nbsp; Well she wasn't.&nbsp;
I got up the next morning and was mad at my mom for not talking to me the
night before.&nbsp; When she asked me what was going on I told her, well
she then told me that she had not been to my room the night before and
asked me to describe exactly what I had seen, so I did.&nbsp; By the time
the conversation was over she ended up pulling out a picture of a woman
and asking me if that was who I had seen.</b>
<br><b>When I said why yes mommy it it she began to cry.&nbsp; For you
see the picture was of my greatgrandmother as a young woman.&nbsp; She
died when I was only 3 weeks old!!!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Anyway that is the first experience that I remember as if
it were yesterday and I thought you might find it interesting.&nbsp; I
have many many others.&nbsp; So many that they have lasted my entire life.&nbsp;
I am like I said 31 years old and to this day on a daily basis I do see
the dead.&nbsp; There are even times that believe it or not we talk.&nbsp;
I do not always know these people, sometimes, many times infact they were
strangers to me in life and are the same in death.&nbsp; Yet they still
come to me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; The other point that makes this story interesting is the
fact that my 5</b>
<br><b>year old son also sees the dead.&nbsp; He sees children that have
past on he calls</b>
<br><b>them his little play friends.</b>

<p><b>My Hunting</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I am sending this in for my husband.&nbsp; He has told his story
to so many people and they never believe him.&nbsp; I must say I didn't
believe him till His mother and sister told me the same story.&nbsp; He
was a young boy still living at home with his mother and sister.&nbsp;
His sisters room and his were right next to each other when one night he
heard his sister screaming he ran to her room and saw her bed floating
in the air and then it just fell and broke.&nbsp; Must tell you his sister
was in the bed at the time but didn't get hurt.&nbsp; His mother and him
tells me about a time when she was cleaning the bathroom and started to
clean the tub she had to remove his toys and one was a small Nerff ball
she laid it on the tub and went to spray the tub when the ball fell back
in the tub not thinking about it she picked it up and put it back.&nbsp;
Once again she went to spray the tub the ball fell and this time started
to circle the tub she yelled for my husband and when he entered the bathroom
it stooped.&nbsp; This time she wet the ball down and made it heavy My
husband waited out side the bathroom.&nbsp; She went to spray the tub down
again and again the ball fell into the tub and started to circle it.&nbsp;
At that time my husband walked in and saw it for him self.&nbsp; This was
not the only encounters they had with this.&nbsp; There was slamming doors
with doors that were hard to shut.&nbsp; My husband summer clothes came
up missing.&nbsp; There was flaying glasses.&nbsp; My husband even saw
this guy, He said he is a dark black or grayish smoky figure of a man in
the early 20's wearing a long over coat and a top hat.&nbsp; He saw him
a few times when he was younger and then about 5 years ago after we were
married.&nbsp; We do have a lot of strand this happen to us and we are
not sure if it cane be the</b>

<p><b>My Ghostly Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: thepikes35950@juno.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I had just started working as a nursing assistant at our county hospital.
My head nurse had given me some paperwork to fill out and return, and I
had forgotten it in the break room the day before. My husband and I returned
to the hospital about five in the evening so I could get the papers I needed.
As we entered the hospital, we noticed a small elderly lady walking a short
distance in front of us. She had&nbsp; on a red shawl, and she had very
white hair and rounded shoulders. We were walking around the corner to
the elevator, and she was ahead of us, and she got to the elevator first.
The door started to close, and I said "Excuse me, could you hold the elevator
for us please?". The door closed, but just as I was about to press the
up button, the doors opened. The little woman was nowhere in sight. My
husband and I had BOTH seen her get on the elevator, and the elevator didn't
go anywhere. Well, I went up to the nurse's break room to get my paperwork,
and I stopped and asked a nurse about what I had seen. I told her I had
seen a small woman who had just disappeared. She said "Did she have a shawl,
and was she a really tiny woman with humpback?" I about had a heart attack.
She perfectly described this ghost</b>
<br><b>I had seen! The nurse told me not to worry about her, that she was
nice, and that she was often seen in dying patient's rooms, rocking in
a rocking chair.</b>

<p><b>My Ghost of Gettysburg</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: KyTaurus36@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>My story is true and can be verified by my room mate. In August
of 1996, my room mate my son and my Niece went to New York for my room
mates grandmothers 90th birthday. On the way back we had planned to stop
and camp for a few days at Gettysburg Battlefield.&nbsp; We were actually
camping on the battlefield itself, and i thought this was so cool.To lay
at night where soldiers of 131 years before had slept or worse even died.
We did the sightseeing tour ealy in the day and were pretty tired by the
time night came. We had a group of scouts camping&nbsp; about 200 feet
from us so we were not totally alone, First and 2nd nights all was calm
nothing out of the ordinary.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; On our 3rd day there we went to Devil's Den an area where
some of the worst fighting to place.Also there was where photographers
posed a dead soldier with a rifle, so that they could take his picture
and send it to his family to let them know he never gave up his post while
fighting for the South.&nbsp; I had an uneasy feeling that night when i
went to bed but thought it was because I was tired.Around 3 am I had woke
up to go to the bathroom, {of course the bathroom was at the top of the
hill} Since no one was up i decided to relieve myself by the back of the
van. I was just getting ready to use the bathroom when I heard drums beating.
They sounded like the drum beat that the young boys would play as soldiers
started thier march into battle.&nbsp; Needless to say I DID NOT use the
bathroom willingly :). I looked at the direction that the drum sound was
coming from and it was the&nbsp; Devils Den area.Now I know what you are
thinking that someone was up playing drums over there. Un uh. That area
as most that have been there knows that the roads are blocked off and no
one can get there by car at night. And no one in their right minds would
go to that area at night.I jumped up pants around my ankles and beat it
to our tent my room mate was awake and asked me why i was playing drums....by
the look on my face she knew it wasnt me. We packed up in less that 20
minutes and were on our way home back to Ky ..........in record time.</b>

<p><b>My Friend's Dad's Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: TUVXY57@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I enjoy all the stories on your site and thought I'd share my encounter
with everyone.&nbsp; Shortly before I graduated college, my friend Mike's
dad became very sick.&nbsp; Mike was in the military and stationed in Germany
at the time (we live in eastern PA).&nbsp; While he was cutting through
the red tape to come home, his dad died.&nbsp; He got back just in time
for the funeral but I had to stay at school for finals.</b>
<br><b>When Mike went back to Germany, his sister (he was one of 9 children)
would tell him stories of unusual happenings in their house since his father
died.&nbsp; Things like coffee cups stirring themselves, strange noises,
lights going on and off and so on.&nbsp; They would also hear someone walking
around when no one else was home.&nbsp; Mike and I dismissed the stories
as active imaginations.When Mike returned from Germany and I got out of
school, we went out to dinner with our girlfriends to celebrate.&nbsp;
It was after midnight and the girlfriends got tired, so we dropped them
off and went back to Mike's for a while.&nbsp; That's when we encountered
the spirit of Mike's dad.&nbsp; We lived around the corner from eachother
and had the same model house.&nbsp; We both grew up in those houses and
we know what it sounds like when someone walks down the stairs.</b>
<br><b>Mike and I were at the kitchen table talking when we heard someone
walking down the stairs.&nbsp; You would hear a hand sliding on the rail
and the steps would creak.&nbsp; All the houses were the same and we had
both heard that noise countless times before.&nbsp; We thought his cousin
or his sister were coming downstairs.&nbsp; From where I was, I could lean
back in my chair and see the stairs.&nbsp; I leaned back, looked, but saw
no one coming down the stairs, but...the sound went on as if someone was!!&nbsp;
The sound continued until the</b>
<br><b>"person" or whatever it was would've reached the bottom.&nbsp; Mike
and I looked at eachother in disbelief (definitely not fear).&nbsp; Mike
said almost jokingly, "That must be my dad."&nbsp; I got up and went to
run up the stairs to see if it was another member of his family.&nbsp;
When I got halfway up the stairs, I became very cold, although it was a
June evening.&nbsp; I went all the way to the top and there was no one.&nbsp;
I went right back to the table and Mike said "That was my dad."&nbsp; We
continued talking early into the morning about his dad and sisters and
growing up in the neighborhood.&nbsp; His dad was probably there listening.&nbsp;
It had to be a spirit because our ears were not playing tricks on us.&nbsp;
Whatever it was walked all the way down the stairs.&nbsp; It couldn't have
been a person because we would have seen whoever it was.&nbsp; Besides,
everyone else was asleep with their doors closed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after
this, the events stopped.&nbsp; Although for a couple years, at the anniversary
of his death, little things would happen, but they eventually stopped altogether.&nbsp;
I think Mike's dad wanted to spend some time with him since Mike was stuck
overseas and he didn't see him before his death.</b>

<p><b>The Unseen Living</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: eiWMLssp@win.bright.net</b>
<br><b>I am a firm believer in things we don't always see. Unseen living
things or beings. My first experience was when I was a child of about 8
years old. As a child I lived in a foster home. One evening I was asleep
on the couch in our living room. There was a chair up against the couch
so I couldn't fall and get hurt. At the foot of the couch was an old oil
burner type stove...and to the left of that was a bedroom which was partially
lite by a dim red night light. The main part of the living room was off
on my right. Anyhow, during the course of the night I woke up. I remember
I was totally awake because I was looking around trying to figure out where
I was. As I become aware of my surrounding(I could see pretty good in the
dark as the night light helped) I saw something standing between the couch
and the stove. It was some type of being about the height of four feet.
Due to the glow of the night light I could see it was a solid object. If
I didn't know any better I swear it was a person under a blanket...only
thing different was it had hair or fur growing all over it. As I watched
it...it slowly vanished from my view, like it evaporated. By this time
I was so terrified by what I had seen and by how close it had been to me(it
was less than 2 feet from my feet) that I cover my head with blankets thinking
to myself that if I hide whatever it was may not see me and would go away.
Now, I never found out what this thing was nor have I ever seen it before.
In my mind I think this was some sort of spirit or demon.</b>
<br><b>Recently, I had another experience.First I must explain that I lost
one of my sisters in a car accident little over a year ago. She was fond
of singing and playing the guitar. After she was killed, I visited the
spot where she died and gathered some sage from the area.(Sage is a type
of leaves we burn as a cleansing incense) Anyhow, one evening I was lying
in my bed sleeping with the televion on. Prior to falling asleep I had
been watching a 6 hour tape of a Gomer Pyle marathon. Somewhere before
the tape ended I fell asleep.</b>
<br><b>In the dream I was having,&nbsp; I was walking through an apartment
I once rented. In one of the doorways there was an old folk guitar I recognized
as being the one my sister always played. It began to play by itself and
I began to get frightened. Somehow...from somewhere...I heard my sister
pleading with me...."Baby bro', baby bro', you gotta get up quick...quick
it's trying to get your body, wake up!!!" Oddly enough, I could feel myself
waking up and as I was doing so, again I could hear my sister's voice telling
me this over and over, "Jesus Christ is the Son of God the Father almighty".
And I began to say it along with her. As I got closer to waking up I could
actually feel something very cold weighing down on my body. It was like
I was paralyzed. But as I repeated that sentence along with my sister again
and again...I could feel that thing lift up off me. As soon as it got off
I began to hear Sergeant Carter yelling at Gomer pyle.</b>
<br><b>Again I do not know what this was&nbsp; nor do I want to ever experience
this again. I have one other&nbsp; experience that has come into the public
light but that will be shared at another time. Thank you for listening
and reading.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Christmas at Wal-Mart</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dracoa@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I live in Virginia. Last year for the Christmas season I worked at
the Walmart that we have here, that is where I had my first unpleasant
encounter. I don't know what it was, but I doubt it was human. What I experienced
was an intense heat and physical pain in my body as though I was being
attacked.</b>
<br><b>I was a cashier at the Walmart so I was near the front of the store,
but when the heat was there not even when a customer came in or left cooled
me, only when I left the store and went home was I left alone. Everyday
for atleast a week I went through these attacks. I was takeing pain killers
and that only lessened the pain slightly.If I'm not mistaken, Stafford
is a Civil War sight, I know it's a historical sight, just not sure of
from when. I am fairly certain that there are spirits wandering around
here.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Grandmother Connection</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lissela@home.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi :) My name is Melissa. I live in Toronto, Ontario. My experiences
are more personal than related to a house.&nbsp; My grandmother (Rose)
lives in a house that she and my grandfather bought of my grandfathers
parents about 41 years ago.&nbsp; Before that my Great grandfather and
his wife lived there until my Great grandfather (Israel) died of a brain
tumor.&nbsp; None of this occurred to me until this passes sunday (Oct.
1 2000) I was sitting in my house (which is only 10 years old and we are
the first owners) in front of my boyfriend on the floor when I felt a distinct
tap on my left shoulder. Usually one would assume it was him touching me
but&nbsp; I felt the need to ask him. He swore up and down that he didn't
touch me. This isn't the first time I have felt little taps and pokes.</b>
<br><b>Even when I'm driving I feel as though there is someone is with
me. Anyway, back to my grandmothers house. I will not go into her basement
under any circumstances. Maybe I would go with company but only into one
room. The bedroom.&nbsp; My mother said that it used to be rented out to
"lowlifes" when she lived there about 35 years ago.&nbsp; But my grandmother
says they were a nice couple who never bothered anyone.&nbsp; Every time
I sleep over there I sleep in the master bedroom which is on the main floor
towards the back of the house.&nbsp; There is a wall length mirror at the
foot of the bed and a smaller mirror about the head board.&nbsp; No matter
at what age (I'm 20 now) I always feel that there is something at the foot
of the bed or that something is going to come out of the mirror. My sister
(who was about 6 or 7 at the time) once told me she had a nightmare about
something scary coming out of that mirror. I asked my grandmother about
my great grandparents and she told me she can't remember if my great grandfather
had died in the house or not. She does remember them bringing him home
from the hospital before he died. I was adopted and so was my sister and
brother. None of us are blood related nor have met my great grandparent.
My sister doesn't believe in spirits or ghost and my brother is still to
young to talk about it. My grandmother thinks I'm crazy and so does my
mom. But I think that thereis something looking out for me or connected
to me personally and not the houses (maybe my grandmothers) But I guess
I'll never know who or what it is.</b>

<p><b>Maytag Mansion</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:Lessa1@email.msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>hello there, my name is nick . my family pusrchased the abandoned
mansion of fred maytag in 1992. the 8.200 sq ft mansion was in terrible
shape at the time and it needed alot of work done to it. after about a
year or so of work it was time to do the interior painting. the man who
painted the walls had stayed in the house at night to get the work done
quicker. one morning after going for cofee, he returned to the house to
do some painting. when he entered the house there was a woman in the sunroom
sitting in a rocking chair looking at him. he thought she was just a family
member so he went about his work. when sybil (my brothers mom) came to
check on him later that day, he told her how her mother had been by earlier
that morning and was relaxing in the sunroom. she told him that it was
impossible because her mother had been in des moines all day and that was
a 45 minute drive. they checked the sunroom and the rest of the empty mansion
and found no lady and no rocking chair.. i have been alone in the house
quite a few times and i can feel some sort of presence there. it feels
like someone is with me at all times in the house and even when i am just
on the grounds. sometimes i think i hear voices in the other rooms but
try to convince myself that its all in my mind</b><b></b>

<p><b>Last Night...</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: a.mckean@cvr-uk.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Have written before about an experience at my parent's house, but
last night I experienced something else at my boyfriend Glenn's house.
He and his family live on a farm some way out in the country. The house
used to be one big building, but about&nbsp; 50 years ago it got converted
into 2 houses when his Grandfather got married. When the house was first
converted it had a connecting door at the top of the stairs so that if
necessary you could walk straight through into the other side of the house,
but at some pint it was blocked up and decorated over. Glenn has always
tried to scare me by saying that occasionally you can hear the door opening
and closing in the night and someone walking through it, but I put that
down to him taking the mickey a little as he knows I believe in things
like that, until last night. At about 2.30 in the morning I heard a door
slam loudly directly opposite Glenn's room and someone running downstairs
- there is no door opposite his room except the one that has been closed
up. It couldn't have been his parents as they are both quite elderly and
this was the footsteps of a young person. The living room door slammed
shut and I heard the dog whimpering slightly, then nothing. At the same
time, Glenn rolled over in bed (he was fast asleep) and started talking
to someone as though he were having a normal conversation. He's not really
one for talking in his sleep, and this was a proper conversation although
I could only hear his side of it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Suddenly, he just said "night then", and that was it - nothing
else. This morning, he said he did hear someone going downstairs I have
occasionally felt something in both houses (his brother lives next door)
and in one of the barns, usually like I'm being watched in someway, although
it isn't as bad now as it was when I first started seeing him. I'm not
really spooked by this as it's not a 'bad' feeling.. maybe it's members
of his family wanting to check I'm good enough for him....</b>

wrong and i said steve's dead he had a car accident.she tried to pass it
off as a dream untill about 5 minites later when the phone rang.it was
one of steve's other brothers saying he died in a car accident very early
in the morning.another incident is i was driving my mother to and from
the store,when i just new to take a different way home i don't know how
i knew i just knew something bad would happen if i stayed on that road.i

after we got home i turned on the news to discover a fatal accident occered
two miles past where i made my decision to turn at the time me and my mom

say my husband has learned to trust my bad feelings.we've had quite a few
close calls.now to the present,about two weeks ago i was standing at the
sink skinning an apple for my littlest daughter,when i heard a female sigh
right behind me.thinking it was one of my daughters i started to turn around
to see what she wanted when i noticed both my children in front of the
t.v..i called my husband at work to make sure he was ok.i'm glad to say
he's fine.my 5 year old broke her coller bone 2 days ago and for three

to get ready to go.about 15 mins. later my husband was at the door saying

<p><b>Joe and His Favorite Horse</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: foxsong@earthlink.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was a kid, I took
horseback riding lessons at a farm that had been run for about thirty years
by the same man who had founded it. The farm was his and his family's pride
and joy.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Joe' had been quite
a horseman when young, and had won many competitions on horses he had trained
himself. Some of these old horses were now used in the summer camp and
the riding lesson program. One very elderly horse, which was nearly past
work, was kept as a pet. It had been one of Joe's best horses, and was
a particular favorite of his.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually this horse's
health failed and it had to be put to sleep. After this, the farm's caretaker,
who lived in a house at the top of the main driveway, began to hear what
he thought was a horse that had gotten out of the barn during the night.
He was a very sensible man, and not given to superstition. He said that
about once a week, during the night, he would hear hoofs going up and down
the paved driveway, and would go outside to look, but all the horses were
always in their stalls.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few months after the
old horse had died, Joe also suddenly collapsed and died. For a few weeks,
many of the people at the farm, myself included, saw -- always from a distance
-- a man walking around the farm, wearing white pants and a yellow shirt.
Much later I learned that these were the kind of clothes Joe had been wearing
when he died.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The caretaker said that
he began hearing the horse in the driveway almost every night after Joe
died, and about a month later both the sightings of the man and the sounds
of the horse ceased and never recurred. We could only assume that the two
old friends had found each other and gone on to where they were supposed
to go.</b>

<p><b>Poltergeist Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ValorinXxXx@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hey, I think I just recently got through what we like to call a 'Poltergeist-like'
experience. It all began when I was around 12-13 tears of&nbsp; age. Me
and my family are all across the street at my granny's house. There was
a bad storm going through and the power was out. My granny told me to go
get a flashlight and some candles. I went for the candles first. After
I had them I went for the flashlight that was in her room. I got it and
as I started to close the door I shut it on my pinkie finger. As I began
to pull away it got pulled in a 'jerk' type way back in. This made me pull
away faster and harder. I kept that event to myself. Only a few days later
did I get the second actual disturbance. I was at my granny's house once
more, I was in her room getting a blanket for me. As I passed the mirror
that was on her wall as I left I saw a person standing still out the corner
of my eye. It was not me because I was in motion and this form was inanimate.
Somewhat similar instances took place in her living/dining room area. She
has a huge mirror on the dining portion of the room. Under it is the table
where I did my home school work. Every so often I would see a blonde girl
run back and forth out the corner of my eye. This was the most common of
them all. And I was not the only one to see this girl. My brother,mother,and
grandma also claimed they saw the girl.</b>
<br><b>One day I was at MY house and in bed. I was asleep but I can hear
in my sleep. So I was asleep and I heard my dresser drawers opening and
closing. This awoke me. I looked around the room to see no one. So I figured
that it was my Mom putting up some clothes. So I got up and went down the
hall to the dining room to see if she did indeed do so. She said no. This
went on all night. Each time I would go and ask her and "No" was what I
got. Then it went from my dresser to my closet door which is a sliding
door design. I also asked about that. Same answer.</b>
<br><b>Then later that same night when all seemed calm I was awoke by the
bed shifting its position. I looked to the end of my bed to see what looked
like someone was sitting there. I saw no one but my bed had the imprints
of a butt (pardon the term) at the end. I slowly got up. I was scared as
h*ll.I waved my hand over the area where there should be a body to go with
the prints. Suddenly the imprints jumped up and the bed bounced as if whatever
it was got up fast.&nbsp; Not to long after that I was sent across the
street to my granny's house while they all did one of those girl parties.
Most of the lights weir off. I went to the bathroom to (you know) and as
I (you know) I heard the coffee mug that I remember passing up in the kitchen
move across the table. When I finished my 'business' I saw that it was
not at all where it was at first. This freaked me out. I slowly walked
out of the kitchen to the living room</b>
<br><b>making my way to the door. I then got this feeling like I should
move over somewhat as if to make way for a companion. So I did so and as
I did all my hair on the left side of my body stood out. I walked to the
door with something. I left in a hurry and also kept the event to myself.</b>
<br><b>My Mom then said that when I went to school that the TV in the living
room would go off or would turn on or the volume would go to it's fullest.
She said that my sisters door would close on occasion by itself. Of course
by this time I told them of the events that took place upon me. They did
not believe me at first but soon all the above stuff started to happen
to them. Eventually my Mom told it off. Nothing has really happened since
then. A voice here and there but not much. I say 'poltergeist-like' experience
because I seemed to be the center of it's attention.</b>

<br><b>&nbsp;Few Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Kat17Lover@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>About two years ago my cousin told me a story that I would like to
share.</b>
<br><b>This is a true story.About 9 or 10 years ago when my cousin Stephanie
was about 18 years old my aunt went to Grandveiw Medical Center in Dayton
Ohio for surgery. While in recovery the nurse came out to where Stephanie
was sitting and told her that my aunts mom had called. She told the nurse
that it was impossible and asked if she was sure that it was our grandmother
who telephoned. The nurse told her that, " The woman on the phone was very
clear and said she was you mother's mother." My cousin said to her " This
is very strange for the simplefact that my grandmother has been dead for
8 years."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This next story actually happened to me. About
a month ago my boyfriend and I had broken up and I moved in with&nbsp;
another man and two other couples. From the first step I took into the
house I felt a sad angry evil presance. After two or three hours of being
there I got an overweliming sense that something didn't want me there.
I looked down for some strange unknow reason and saw a rather large bruise
starting to form just below the knee. I hadn't done anything but sit on
the couch so I knew that I hadn't hurt myself.</b>
<br><b>I only lived there a week but strange things happened likelights
turning off and on, Strange noises at night when no body was awake, Things
came up missing when know one was even there. By the time I had left I
had gotten terribly ill. When I asked them if the house may be haunted,
they told me that yes it was by a man who had drowned in the bathtub while
he was drunk. I never found out why he didn't want me there but my guess
is I reminded the ghost of a lost love.</b>

<p><b>I am Alone</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: meanyleopardshoes@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; My name is Shannon, I'll be 18 11 days, I live in Georgia,
and I'm writing to you because I feel alone. For as long as I can remember
I've delt with "ghosts." I dont know what they are or what they want with
me, but they seem to follow me.&nbsp; For the first five years of my life
I lived in a trailor in Mississippi. I can only recall one incident from
then because I was so young. I remember it was a beautiful day in spring
and I was sitting on the picnic table in our back yard making mud pies
when suddenly I heard what I thought to be my mother's voice calling me
from the woods. I started to follow it. The closer I got, the further out
into the deep woods the voice seemed to go. I almost followed it all the
way into the woods thinking my mother was calling me, but suddenly I heard
my mother's real voice calling me from the trailor. I turned and saw her
waiting for me next the to picnic table so I ran back and told her what
had happened. She, or course, said that it was my imagination.&nbsp;&nbsp;
About 12 years ago our family moved here to Hiram. Every single night for
years I was terrified to sleep because I saw "shadow people." they were
like three dimensional shadows that looked like people. I saw them in my
room at night after my parents would put me to bed. when Id call my parents
into the room they would turn on the light and the shadow people would
be gone. They said it was my imagination.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lots of other things
have happened and there have been witnesses to some of the events. The
house will shake at times, the doors will open and close on their own,
Ive seen dolls move on their own,a glass has exploded in my hand for no
reason ( i no glases will explode from temperature changes, but there was
no change in temperature at all),&nbsp; there was a music box that’s music
would play in other rooms of the house when the music box wasnt wound,
Ive heard footsteps when no one was home or awake, I've heard voices..
the list goes on. I thought that maybe there was something wrong with me
so I went to a psychiatrist. She said that theres nothing wrong with me.
I've leraned to verify that im really hearing something my looking at my
cats and</b>
<br><b>see if they respond to the noise. if they hear it too their ears
perk up.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've tried talking to people about it before and they
either dont believe me and think im making it up, or they think im crazy.
I really feel alone, and it would be nice if you could give me some sort
of guidance. What should I do? Should I do anything?? well.. i appologize
for the long e-mail, Im sure that you get a lot of mail every day and I
hate to add to the pile.</b>
<br><b>Thank you for your time.</b>

<p><b>Hospital Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: thepikes35950@juno.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>While I was working at a hospital in town, I had the opportunity
to come in contact with many ghosts. I worked on the geriatric floor, and
elderly people died every single day. If the power suddenly went out and
immediately came back on, a person had just died. This happened EVERY TIME.
Another popular ghost at the hospital was the "Grim Reaper". The Reaper
was a dark figure that would come through the window at the end of the
hallway. He would shut doors, touch you on the shoulder, etc. Late at night
you could feel that someone was there, and you would see a dark figure
out of the corner of your eye. As soon as you looked up, he was gone. My
favorite story to tell is this: I was helping a woman get her bath early
one morning. I was asking how she slept, how she felt, etc. She told me
that she did not get a wink of sleep because of the man's face she saw
in the window. She said that she thought it was tree branches, but she
got up in the middle of the night and saw that it was a man's face staring
at her through the window. This woman was just in the hospital for a kidney
infection, she wasn't on any drugs that would make her hallucinate. On
third shift, you can hear children's giggling and hear them running up
and down the halls, but there are no children on the floor. If you went
past the operating room at night, it would be locked, but inside you could
hear instruments clanging and things being thrown around.</b>

<p><b>Hit And Run</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: purplebee@metallica.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I don't know if you're interested in stories from around the globe
but I thought that I may as well give it a go.&nbsp; I live in Northern
Ireland and have done all my life.&nbsp; I come from Co Tyrone which is
right in the centre of NI.&nbsp; This is where my story comes from.&nbsp;
After a night spent out, one friend was leaving another friend home to
Beneburb and travelling the road from Dungannon, through Moy and out another
few miles to Benburb where he lived.&nbsp; It was late and the road was
windy, very rural and old houses scattered around.&nbsp; The roads are
bendy and prone to fog patches and when wet can be treacherous.&nbsp; The
bloke who was driving the car suddenly swerved and screamed.&nbsp; They
somehow got to Benburb to my friends house and they set him down and tried
to get him calm enough to get him talking.&nbsp; He was shaking and sweating
even though it was a winter's night and we aren't that warm overhere in
the summer!&nbsp; He eventulally said that he was driving on when someone
ran out infront of the car and he swerved to try and avoid them but when
this figure finally reached the middle of the road it simply disappeared,
into thin air.&nbsp; The friend travelling home with them hadn't seen a
thing and neither of them drink, so it wasn't that.&nbsp; There wasn't
any fog on that particular bend and it We haven't heard any more about
this and we haven't heard of any accident&nbsp; or such taken place there.&nbsp;
We aren't sure if it was just his imagination, but he never really had
much of an imagination.&nbsp; We just still aren't sure.</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Computer Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: celeri@videotron.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>Just fell on your page by accident.</b>
<br><b>I read your personnal story and it did confirm something I felt
all along: Emotions are triggers. In the sense that emotions are an antenna
(at least for me).</b>
<br><b>Now please forgive me if the rest of this letter is slightly fragmented;
the whole topic of ghosts had (and has) me thinking a lot. And while I
still don't quite understand the different links between my own observations,
I feel as though the links are there. (and on a completly different plane,
english is not my mother tongue so you'll forgive me some mis-spellings
and the bad selection of words)</b>
<br><b>First of all, let me present myself. My name is Louis. I am a computer
technician. I really want to be a writer (want to? I guess I am by my own
desire to communicate). Anyways I've alyways been interested in the paranormal
while wanting to be cold and rationnal. So my life has been divided in
two seperate parts, much like the rest of me (err not physically although
:) ). Sometimes believing and sometimes not. Very much like the couple
in the X-Files except this is one single individual.</b>
<br><b>Well this being said, deep down inside i'm Intensly emotionnal.
This is how I write and it's some sort of catalystic event. From emotion
to paper. I can't say many of my own apparitions have been happening during
periods of great emotion, however I have this strong feeling that time
is not nearly as linear as we think. So it doesn't really matter when we
have emotions; it only matters if we do/did/will. When we are in a state
of emotionnal intensity, we become (this is not documented, just felt)
like beacons, not of light but of energy. We litterally impregnate our
surroundings. If you could imagine throwing a rock in the middle of a pond
... knowing you are at the middle of this pond, and waves in front go to
the future and waves in the back ... go to the past.&nbsp; Left and right
and up and down are other parameters that we don't know (they might indicate/influence
the dispersion of this energy). Suffice to say emotions are never lost.
We just loose touch because of our mindset and our limited capacity to
observe. In more practical terms, we do send "messages" backward in time,
or at least surges of energy. I have often wondered if some of the "sightings"
in my life were the result of such ripples backward in time. It might be
hard to prove but it's a theory that I feel for.</b>
<br><b>As far as hauntings because of someone else's bad intentions or
bad luck are concerned, I have a tough time believing it (not that it does
not exist). It's my impression that wherever someone goes he/she continues
to send "emotionnal signals" thru time. Furthermore I think much of hollywood's
scenarios have turned hauntings into "this must necessarily be evil" stories.
Good for the checkbook but hmmm... Mind you one of my personnal experiences
is kinda weird (the one about cats, to be read further down).</b>
<br><b>Ok, in your story you were talking of how you had a feeling of coldness
when you were having your apparitions. Well for me it's slightly different.
When something strange is happening, my senses of sight and hearing are
all of a sudden amplified. My mind is focused. I feel kinda sick as though
I'm going outside of myself. My emotions, obviously take control. But this
hasn't happened for such a long time now.</b>
<br><b>One thing I can say, and you will probably agree with me is : DON'T
WISH IT!!!! I know this seems really incredible, but if you ask for it,
you will probably get it. Mind you, the funny thing is that people who
just don't get emotionnally worked up try and try and try and never succeed
(many researchers fall into this category). In my opinion it has a lot
to do with that beacon I was taking to you about earlier. You need to amplify
this so it can be heard. I guess some people are "lucky" and don't need
to put too much effort into it.</b>
<br><b>AN EXPERIENCE: Is Windows ghost-proof?</b>
<br><b>Sometimes you wish you had a camera. While not necessarily sensationnal,
this is the story of what happens when you wish something stupid. This
happened four or five years ago. So happens I've been playing solitaire
on my PC. I was using Window's built-in card game. All of a sudden I have
this flash. The type of flash that generally arrives when you just KNOW
something. It comes out of the blue and is not the result of some rationnal
thinking. What if ... I should ask to win all the time in exchange for
let's say ... my soul? I started laughing. There's no such thing as selling
your soul! So I play my cards, putting that idea aside. All of a sudden,
I feel uneasy. What if? I just don't want to be bothered. Then the tought
comes to me again. What if? Now this is just getting too much for confort.
So I figure, let me finish my game and then I'll just go to bed. All of
a sudden, there's some garbage on my deck !?!? what the h*ll! Some cards
I can move some I can't. Some decks are jammed and some are still functionnal.
I think to myself, this is weird... Windows should have crashed after something
like this happens. But it didn't. What do you know, I just said "Forget
about it!!!" out loud ... just in case, and I went to bed a smarter man.
In retrospect I do feel as though this was a "friendly" message. Someone
out there cares and told me to be careful. Why, thank you. Oh by the way,
I don't have a screenshot. I just wanted to turn off that computer and
go away! ... And furthermore my computers rarely crash - computers actually
STOP crashing when I get there; call it luck but it works when I'm at the
keyboard and sometimes doesn't as soon as I leave the room.</b>
<br><b>Oh, a few of my experiences have happened in front of my computer.
This might not be a factor though because I'm glued to the damn thing :)</b>
<br><b>Now this is the story I was refering to earlier.</b>
<br><b>AN EXPERIENCE: Is there cats in the house?</b>
<br><b>I'm allergic. I generally can't handle animals very well although
I've recently started having a cat in the house and my body is handling
it better than I tought. Anyways my story happened three years ago. Sometimes
when I am consumed by my work I stay on my computer all night. That morning
I had just done that and I still wasn't sleepy. I had a lot of things to
do, namely writing. So I had breakfast and instead of going to bed as my
mother suggested, I went back to the computer. I typed away. All of a sudden,
I felt my right ankle getting really hot. Weird. I just rubbed it through
my jeans and tought nothing of it (in retrospect I'm really stupid, I miss
all of these weird experiences by a mile). But the burning feeling was
really bad (and getting worse). So I took a break, rolled up the leg of
my pants (hard because they were tight at the bottom) and ... what do you
know? Three beautiful scratches about 1 1/2 inches long. They were bleeding
slightly. So I investigated. Is it the socks? Why would this happen now,
when I wore them many times before without incident? Can it be something
under my desk that I've rubbed on? With jeans? Surely I would have noticed!!!
So finally I decided to go the other way. What else could have done this
kind of scratches? Well to the best of my knowledge, this was a cat's scratch.
And it does make some sense; when a cat scratches me, it burns like hell.
Other scratches I usually don't mind. So I just laughed it off. And again
I didn't have a camera with me ... DAMN! :)&nbsp; After thinking about
it for a while I did remember that my father killed a cat by accident (quite
gruesome so I'll omit the details) right beside our house a few years earlier.
Added to this the fact that my mother and my girlfriend say they have recently
seen a "ghost cat" walking around the house both inside and outside. I
didn't fear anything so it is indicative to me that this was not something
"really" dangerous. It did hurt a bit however :) On a last and final note,
if this is indeed a cat but it isn't that cat that my father killed, I
can't help but think that this could be a wave from the future ... of something
yet to happen ...</b>

<p><b>Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tango@tango93.freeserve.co.uk</b><b></b>
<p><b>My family and myself moved into a top floor flat in the area where
we now live. I to&nbsp; wasn't the ideal place that we wanted for ourselves
but&nbsp; it was bright and breezy and had an easy atmosphere . So we moved
in.</b>
<br><b>In the beginning&nbsp; it&nbsp; was&nbsp; fine but after awhile
of living there&nbsp; odd little things would occur&nbsp; at various times.&nbsp;
Ornaments would fall from the mantle shelf over the fire place. When items
were put down they would get miss placed&nbsp; of only to turn up somewhere
quite different.</b>
<br><b>Although me and my wife got a bit uneasy about what was happening
we always managed to come up with some explanation as to what was going
on around us.</b>
<br><b>One particular morning getting up to go to work and going into the
living room. I was amazed to find that the wall pictures&nbsp; had been
messed with and were all&nbsp; crooked. It was a strange feeling because
you see it but you don't believe it. After that moment things speeded up
at home and got a little nasty.</b>
<br><b>I was working has a butcher&nbsp; in a shop and&nbsp; because of
sataday working I had a day off in the week. On this particular Tuesday&nbsp;
I had a lie in in bed. My wife got up about&nbsp; 7:30am to get herself
ready for work and my young daughter ready for school. I listened to&nbsp;
their clatter and banging&nbsp; about until they went out of the door at&nbsp;
8:30am.</b>
<br><b>I must of dozed off to sleep because I was awoken by a weight&nbsp;
on the bed and has I thought&nbsp; my wife climbing&nbsp; back into it.</b>
<br><b>I had my back to her and looked at the clock&nbsp; on the side table&nbsp;
it read 8:49. I said to her" your back early" .Also&nbsp; I was a bit delighted
because I thought she'd come back to bed to make love.</b>
<br><b>She slipped her arm through&nbsp; and around my neck.( It was cold
and thin and definitely female.) "Christ love your freezing" I remember
saying&nbsp; and with that she put a violent&nbsp; choke hold on me attacking
my&nbsp; Adams&nbsp; apple and strangling me</b>
<br><b>The pain from this and there was pain believe me put me straight
onto the defensive. I grabbed the arm from around my neck and released
myself&nbsp; in a matter of seconds scrambling out of bed in sheer fright.
I looked around back on to the bed and it was empty.</b>
<br><b>We stayed on in that flat for a few years and although I was never
attacked again the haunting continued with various apparitions. Smells
that we couldn't explain , scratching in the walls and I think the most
unnerving, the shaking of the beds .</b>
<br><b>I expect you're wondering why we just didn't up and leave ? Well&nbsp;
accommodation at that time&nbsp; was hard to come by.&nbsp; So we had to
really just live with what was going on.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunting of Our House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Kissee295@cs.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, my name is Diane, we have ( we being myself, husband &amp; daughter)
had ghosts in our house since we moved into it, 13 years ago.&nbsp; The
house was brand new when we bought it.&nbsp; We think there are 3 different
ghosts, a little boy, an older girl (which we think are related), and an
adult female.&nbsp; The little boy is seen the most by my husband.&nbsp;
We all have heard a woman voice say, "come here", at the same time.&nbsp;
There is sometimes a cold spot near the chair in the livingroom.&nbsp;
My husband is usually the main person who hears</b>
<br><b>And sees the ghosts.&nbsp; We did have 2 dogs that sometimes would
growl and stare down the hall.&nbsp; The 2 dogs we have now like children
and they haven't seem to notice the ghosts.&nbsp; Sometimes when my husband
is alone in the house, he will hear children laughing back in our daughter's
room.&nbsp; When he has gone to check on the noise, our daughter's&nbsp;
hamster was up (during the day).&nbsp; We also have heard a loud thump
type noise underneath the diningroom floor. One of our previous dogs dug
a hole in the tile right where the sound comes from.</b>

<p><b>Haunted House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Kreko31@cs.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My family and I live in Texas in a house that
is about 40 years old.&nbsp; It was built in 1960.&nbsp; After first moving
here, when cleaning up to get ready to move in, I saw a woman of about
60 running towards me smiling with a long blue gown with her arms held
out to me. I couldnt see her feet, but I could see my mother and my son
through her in the next room.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My son has had a
book thrown at him, he has seen a little girl about 10, walking through
the kitchen and through the table. The trashcan in the bathroom moves when
he is taking a bath.&nbsp; My mother, stepfather, son and myself keep seeing
a black shadow of a large male figure.&nbsp; Different smells run through
one section of the house, and you can only smell them in that one line
of the room.&nbsp; Puddles of water form on the floor, and when they are
wiped up they come back again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this activity our animals act very strange.&nbsp;
My two year old daughter came out of the front room, (which is empty) scared
to death.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have heard a woman calling&nbsp; through
the house, but I can't make out what she is saying.&nbsp; The doorbell
rings and no one is there, I hear knocking in the walls and at the front
door.&nbsp; We once had a guest who was staying with my son while I was
running an errand, and he heard the front door unlock, open, and heard
someone's footsteps come into the kitchen and stop.&nbsp; When he got</b>
<br><b>Up to see if it was me returning, no one was here and the door was
bolt locked.</b>
<br><b>I was the only one with a key.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few days
after my cousin died, I saw her standing behind the toilet in the bathroom
looking at me like she was wondering if I could see her.&nbsp; She looked
kind of anxious.&nbsp; There was a lot of activity here a few days after
she died.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sold a babybed to a friend of mine, and her
boyfriend unhinged my daughters door to get the bed out.&nbsp; When he
went to put the door back on, we couldn't find the hinge anywhere.&nbsp;
He was on his hands and knees looking. We looked on the floor, in the door,
everywhere.&nbsp; After they left me and my friend decided to look for
it some more and it was in the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Little things
happen that I've stopped really noticing anymore, the TV</b>
<br><b>changes channels by itself, lights come on and off.&nbsp; It seems
to happen all at once out of the blue, or nothing will happen for months.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I don't think whatever it or they are are dangerous, except for the book
being thrown at my son.</b>
