<P>
<P><B>My own mental picture is still as vivid as though I had just lived
it. The</B>
<P><B>last faint beams of the November sun shown through my bedroom window</B>
<P><B>illuminating the dust in the air and giving it the image of lightly
falling</B>
<P><B>snow. The prisms on my windows refracted the dim rays and turned them
into</B>
<P><B>bright kaleidoscopic ornaments of colour splashed upon my wall. Usually
in</B>
<P><B>the pristine hour of twilight the house was full of the aroma of my
mothers</B>
<P><B>cooking and stories of the day's events, but that night I was the only
one</B>
<P><B>home. The golden hour of twilight had slipped away into the void of</B>
<P><B>darkness, replacing the beauty of the prisms with the silver distortion
of</B>
<P><B>moonbeams through the twisted bare branches outside my bedroom
window.</B>
<P><B>Sleep was beginning to drug the air about me and I was rhythmically</B>
<P><B>drifting in and out of slumber. The sound of my father's footsteps</B>
<P><B>resounding hollowly through the stairwell woke me from my repose. I
heard</B>
<P><B>him light on the top of the stairs and awaited the familiar creak of
the</B>
<P><B>stairwell door, but the door remained closed and a gentle constant
tapping</B>
<P><B>began. I assumed the door must be locked and this was my dad's attempt
to</B>
<P><B>wake me so I stood up to unlock the door. Up to the instant I unlocked
the</B>
<P><B>door the rapping continued gradually rising in intensity until I could
see</B>
<P><B>the reverberations shaking the oil-stained wood. "Just a second!" I
yelled</B>
<P><B>over the violent knocking. Finally I unlocked the door and it flew
open to</B>
<P><B>reveal a rush of cold air and the emptiness of a dark stairwell.
Terrified</B>
<P><B>I shouted for my dad but was answered by a harsh silence.</B>

<H3><A NAME=midnight>Midnight</A>
</H3><P><B>by 	kindy@mulberry.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>We live in a house built in 1836. Since the day we moved in we have</B>
<P><B>experinced strange things. We have often heard foot steps coming up
our</B>
<P><B>stairs at the stroke of midnight. </B>
<P><B>so much so that a babysitter heard them to and remarked that we had
come in</B>
<P><B>early that night, right at the stroke of  midnight. We informed her
that we</B>
<P><B>had not arrived until two am. A large dish placed in the middle of
our</B>
<P><B>kitchen table was smashed on our floor one night with  no one in the
 room.</B>
<P><B>My brother came to our backdoor one night to see no one in the room
but a</B>
<P><B>large rocking chair rocking away. No one had been in the room for over
an</B>
<P><B>hour.Shortly after that we bought a dog who would bound off the bed
after</B>
<P><B>we heard the foot steps and grawel at the landing.Our cleaning lady
would</B>
<P><B>often get the feeling some one was watching her while working in an
up</B>
<P><B>stairs bedroom. My last story will make me sound really off the wall,
but I</B>
<P><B>am going to yell you anyway. One day my husband brought home fresh
liver</B>
<P><B>and rye bread. He put the bread in the cupbord and the liver in the
fridge.</B>
<P><B>The next morning  both the liver and bread were gone. Years later we
spoke</B>
<P><B>to a women who was born in this house, she told us she thought our
ghost</B>
<P><B>was her father who always came in at midnight and his best meal was
liver</B>
<P><B>and rye bread</B>

<H3>	<A NAME=basement>The Spirit in the Basement</A>
</H3><P><B>by rjdurha@ibm.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was a senior in high school my mother remarried.  We had </B>
<P><B>to move to another town and I was not very happy.  During the first
</B>
<P><B>months of the summer I met a girl and fell in love.  Now I have never
</B>
<P><B>believed in the supernatural until something happened to me that would
</B>
<P><B>change my aspect for the supernatural for the rest of my life.  </B>
<P><B>	One evening I was Home alone talking on the phone to my girl </B>
<P><B>friend.  A freak thunder storm occurred (considering it was cold and
</B>
<P><B>late in the fall) and there was a power outage.  At the time of the
</B>
<P><B>outage I was in the kitchen on a phone, suddenly I heard the door to
the </B>
<P><B>basement,also my new bedroom, open an somebody walked through the house
</B>
<P><B>into my parents room.  I told my girlfriend to hold on because my mother
</B>
<P><B>was home and I wanted to ask her a quesion.  The power came back on
and </B>
<P><B>when I entered the room noone was there.  I could not explain this
and I </B>
<P><B>am 100% positive that I heard the door open then I heard footsteps
</B>
<P><B>walking into my parents room.</B>
<P><B>	The story does not stop here.  The next day my parents left and </B>
<P><B>I was in the house alone again.  While sitting in our living room </B>
<P><B>watching, I heard movement in my parents room.  Suddenly the door burst
</B>
<P><B>open and a black circular ball came rolling across the floor and burst
</B>
<P><B>into the door going outside. to  let you have an idea of what the ball
</B>
<P><B>looked like, try looking into a light for a second and close your eyes.
</B>
<P><B> When you do this you will see a ball, and this is what the ball looked
</B>
<P><B>like.  After I saw the black ball my life became a living hell!  I
woke </B>
<P><B>up one morning to a bright light.  I thouhgt the light was coming from
</B>
<P><B>the window and I kept staring at it.  It was odd because the time was
</B>
<P><B>5:00 a.m., and noone was awake in the house.  The window was located
int </B>
<P><B>the basement underneath the steps leading inside of the house.  I </B>
<P><B>continued to stare at the light in the window until i realized I was
not </B>
<P><B>looking at the window because the window was located 20 feet to my
left!</B>
<P><B>Every night something would tap on the walls,and one night I was awakend
</B>
<P><B>to something hitting the brick wall beside my bed.  This was odd </B>
<P><B>considering I live in a basement that is 15 feet underground. Every
</B>
<P><B>night when I would start to doze off the tapping would occurr and keep
</B>
<P><B>me awake all night.  My friends started to worry about my sleeplesness,
</B>
<P><B>but I would never dare tell them why.  One evening my family was home,
</B>
<P><B>my mother was down in the basement(my room) exercising and my stepfather
</B>
<P><B>was in his bedroom and I was in the living room, when all of the sudden
</B>
<P><B>a something started to growl and snarl at me.  I could hear the thing,
</B>
<P><B>but I could see nothing.  The sound was only 5 feet away from me and
I </B>
<P><B>was scared to death.  Finally I got my courage up and proceeded to
get </B>
<P><B>my stepfather hoping he would hear it.  When I reached his bedroom
door, </B>
<P><B>the sound quit and I never heard it again.  I was really getting fed
up </B>
<P><B>with my little problem.  I had not had a decent night sleep in months
</B>
<P><B>and started to get angry.  I found that I would stay out late drinking
</B>
<P><B>because I was scared to go home, and I was to ashamed to tell anybody.
 </B>
<P><B>One night I came home intoxicated.  I was not so drunk that I could
not </B>
<P><B>comprehend, but I was drunk enough to where I was not afraid.  I layed
</B>
<P><B>in bed when the tapping sound started, I jumped up cussing mad and
</B>
<P><B>started to yell and challenge whatever it was.  This was not a good
idea </B>
<P><B>because I dont know if I fell or was pushed but I found myself on my
</B>
<P><B>waterbed.  Suddenly a light flew slowy across my chest and the light
</B>
<P><B>bulb began to flicker, next I blacked out and did not wake up until
the </B>
<P><B>next morning.</B>
<P><B>	My senior year was almost to an end and my life was a living </B>
<P><B>hell.  While I was at school I had a carpentry class. One day the </B>
<P><B>teacher sent me and my friends down to the baseball field to work on
a </B>
<P><B>two story building that they used for storage.  We started to work
</B>
<P><B>upstairs and then proceeded down stairs.  There is only one entrance
</B>
<P><B>into the building and I was standing in front of It.  We then started
to </B>
<P><B>hear someone tapping on the outside of the building.  My friends and
I </B>
<P><B>thought that it was one of our classmates, but the sound started to
</B>
<P><B>sound familiar to me.  I turned white as a ghost because I knew what
it </B>
<P><B>was.  the thing had followed me to school.  I told my friends while
we </B>
<P><B>were still in the building everything.  I told them about the first
time </B>
<P><B>my hauntings started and some other things to.  The did not believe
me </B>
<P><B>until we heard somebody walking up stairs beating on the floor and
the </B>
<P><B>walls.  THe ran up the stairs and I followed, but noone was to be found.
</B>
<P><B> When I looked at them I knew that they believed me now and we fled
the </B>
<P><B>building only to keep our experience to ourselves.  The teacher was
mad </B>
<P><B>because we did not finish our job, but we did not care.  That was the
</B>
<P><B>last time I was ever bothered by it,and I like to think that I left
it </B>
<P><B>back at my old highschool in the baseball building.  I am now 25 and
I </B>
<P><B>live in another town.  If anybody could give me input on what they
think </B>
<P><B>was pestering me I would appreciate it...</B>

<H3>	<A NAME=family>Family Ghostly Experiences</A>
</H3><P><B>by spau@netcom.ca</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am a 30 years old technical professional and like many technical</B>
<P><B>people, I prefer to explain thing logically, but what I am going to
tell</B>
<P><B>you is beyond any logical explanation. These are my family
experience,</B>
<P><B>not mine.These are the real things.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My family, especially on my father side, has been encountering
ghostly</B>
<P><B>experience over the years and I was told these stories that make me</B>
<P><B>scared but at the same time I would like to be the one who
experienced</B>
<P><B>them. The descriptions are very short because I don't remember the</B>
<P><B>details, just the jest of the stories.</B>
<P>
<P><B>1 st encounter (according to my memory)</B>
<P>
<P><B>My grandparents used to live in an old building in Hong Kong, it was</B>
<P><B>built before the second world war. They moved into this unit in this</B>
<P><B>building a few years after the war ended (after the japanese invasion
of</B>
<P><B>the land). Like many old building built around the war time, it had
long</B>
<P><B>hallway and dark corners. My aunt (my father's younger sister) told
me</B>
<P><B>they always got this old chill in their bathroom which was very small</B>
<P><B>compared with western standard. They always felt there was a presence</B>
<P><B>there, and they never spent more than a few minutes there (even for
a</B>
<P><B>shower). </B>
<P>
<P><B>Second encounter:</B>
<P>
<P><B>Another encounter was thi bright light suddenly appeared in the
kitchen,</B>
<P><B>like an explosion. According to what I was told, the light was seen
from</B>
<P><B>one end of the long hallway and the kitchen is on another hallway.
It</B>
<P><B>lasted a second or so, but it was observable. When my grandparents
went</B>
<P><B>inside the kitchen and checked, there was nothing and nobody. The</B>
<P><B>location of the kitchen was not at a place where bright sunlight
would</B>
<P><B>shine through. The light was certainly not a reflection and more than
a</B>
<P><B>bright light similar to a nuclear explosion, there was no sound.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Third encounter:</B>
<P>
<P><B>But the more scary one would be this crying sound coming out from the</B>
<P><B>wall at one of the dark corners. At around 12am most nights, the
sound</B>
<P><B>came out from the wall. I forgot whether it was a male or female
sound</B>
<P><B>but it was definitely a human crying sound. My uncle's bed was
opposite</B>
<P><B>to this wall. Surprisingly ,my uncle got angry instead of being
scared,</B>
<P><B>he used to shout at the wall or threw one of his slippers at it,
saying</B>
<P><B>"Shut up" (in Chinese of course), then the sound would stop.</B>
<P><B>But he got very frustrated doing this almost every night.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Several years after, they moved to another building and again built</B>
<P><B>around the war time. On one of this Chinese halloween nights, when</B>
<P><B>families are burning stuff (for-the-dead-money, paper cars and house,
it</B>
<P><B>is a tradition for the deads, hoping the dead ones get them on the
other</B>
<P><B>side) for their love ones on the street, there was one such ceremony</B>
<P><B>right at the entrance to the building where my grandparents lived.</B>
<P><B>Around 12am, everyone was retired in their rooms and suddenly, all
of</B>
<P><B>them heard this crying noise of a man running across the long hallway</B>
<P><B>which ran through the length of the unit , there was windows in the</B>
<P><B>living room which was one end of the hallway and the other end would
be</B>
<P><B>the balcony. The dog was barking very loudly as this noise was
running</B>
<P><B>from one end to another end. Everyone came out from their rooms which</B>
<P><B>ran along the length of the hallway.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Fourth Encounter:</B>
<P>
<P><B>This happened to my aunt (my father eldest sister). When she was</B>
<P><B>preparing dinner in the small kitchen, she suddenly felt a cold chill</B>
<P><B>coming from her back, she turned and then saw this woman watching
her,</B>
<P><B>like many chinese ghosts (my impression with all stories that I
heard),</B>
<P><B>you can see the face, not fog or just shape, chinese ghosts usually
have</B>
<P><B>very well defined shape, almost like a real person. As an experience</B>
<P><B>person with this sort of thing, my aunt did not care or respond and</B>
<P><B>pretended she was not there, it was believed that if you communicate</B>
<P><B>with the ghost, it will grow attach to you and never leave you alone.</B>
<P>
<P><B>But on one occasion, she got very angry as her cabinet in the kitchen</B>
<P><B>were opening and closing like crazy, she slammed on the kitchen bench
in</B>
<P><B>frustration and said that she had had enough, the whole thing stopped</B>
<P><B>immediately.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I guess my family had a way with ghosts.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Fifth encounter:</B>
<P>
<P><B>In the same place as in encounter four above. While watching TV
behind</B>
<P><B>which was the balcony and where my aunt's dog was, my cousin suddenly</B>
<P><B>jumped and asked my aunt who the person head was, flying around near
the</B>
<P><B>balcony, the dog was barking at the same time. My cousin was very
scared</B>
<P><B>as he could clearly see the blood was dripping from the neck. The
head</B>
<P><B>was floating around. My aunt did not see it this time but believe my</B>
<P><B>cousin right away as her family had been encountering ghostly
experience</B>
<P><B>for years. She tried to calm my cousin, but it was a very scary</B>
<P><B>experience for him.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Sixth encounter:</B>
<P>
<P><B>(Same place as above)</B>
<P>
<P><B>My eldest cousin was sick (he was just a kid at the time)and had been</B>
<P><B>sleeping in the bed. One day (during the day)when my aunt brought in</B>
<P><B>some lunch for him, he asked who this boy was and said he was
drowning,</B>
<P><B>he could see this image near the ceiling. The boy was drowning in
water</B>
<P><B>and seemed to be screaming. Without any disbelieving, my aunt asked
her</B>
<P><B>neighbour who was in the apartment building for a long time, about
any</B>
<P><B>prior incident in the neighbourhood. The building was at a very</B>
<P><B>residential area, not downtown apartment building. </B>
<P>
<P><B>The answer she got was , there was a boy drowned a few year back in
the</B>
<P><B>buiding swimming pool. Well, what else....</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was a kid at this time and spent time in their apartment a lot, but</B>
<P><B>never once I saw anything, I would say now it is a disappointment for</B>
<P><B>me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Seventh Encounter:</B>
<P>
<P><B>My aunt (as above) moved to another buiding with larger living area.
I</B>
<P><B>had been there many times and I did not like it as it was dark even
with</B>
<P><B>a lot of sunlight outside.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One day, as she was doing some dusting around the apartment and was
in</B>
<P><B>her bedroom, she suddenly saw all this fog around the whole apartment,
I</B>
<P><B>would say it was like the Victorian London type of foggy. She smelt
this</B>
<P><B>rodden meat smell,(this was new to her), as she turned back, she saw</B>
<P><B>this giant pair of hairy feet(just the feet, no upper body or head
or</B>
<P><B>anything), walking across the fog which was very close to the floor.</B>
<P><B>then suddenly the feet disappeared. </B>
<P>
<P><B>As the smell thing was new to her, she asked my granddad what would
that</B>
<P><B>be as my granddad was the most experienced with this type of thing.
His</B>
<P><B>reply was "Oh, it was just dead people smell", meaning her apartment
was</B>
<P><B>visited.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Once again, with all the time I spent there, I saw nothing.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Eighth Encounter:</B>
<P>
<P><B>My mum was visiting Taiwan. She was sleeping soundly in her bedroom
in a</B>
<P><B>hotel, until she was awaken suddenly. She then saw this figure in the</B>
<P><B>dark with a giant pair of eyes approaching her, she could not
identify</B>
<P><B>whether it was a man or a woman, as she screamed, my dad got up and</B>
<P><B>turned on the light, nothing there in the room.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Nineth encounter:</B>
<P>
<P><B>At the same place as above. Around 1am, my mum was still up but my
dad</B>
<P><B>was asleep. My mum heard this noise coming from outside the hotel</B>
<P><B>building, she looked out down from her window, she saw a group of
people</B>
<P><B>outside seemed to be having a party, the noise was so loud, it could</B>
<P><B>easily be heard even inside the hotel room. My mum, however, could
not</B>
<P><B>figure out whether it was a group of men or women or both, the image
was</B>
<P><B>so VAGUED,even at this short distance.She did not take any notice and</B>
<P><B>went to bed.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next morning , she asked the management whether there was a party</B>
<P><B>outside last night. The management replied there was no party and</B>
<P><B>certainly not at 1am at night. But the noise was also heard by
several</B>
<P><B>people in the group. Ghosts ?????</B>
<P>
<P><B>Tenth Encounter:</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was visting England with my brother and was staying in one of my</B>
<P><B>families house, it was a modern house. One night, when I was out and
my</B>
<P><B>brother was alone in the house and was sleeping in his room with the</B>
<P><B>door completely closed. He suddenly heard footsteps on the stairs.
They</B>
<P><B>were spiral-shaped stairs running all three floors. The footsteps
were</B>
<P><B>clearly heard and were coming from bottom to top floor and was</B>
<P><B>approching his room on the third floor. My brother thought it was me</B>
<P><B>(the owner was gone for a trip), so he did not care, suddenly he
heard</B>
<P><B>someone was talking outside his room (the foot steps stopped at the
same</B>
<P><B>time, what he heard was someone speaking in Victorian English, it was</B>
<P><B>certainly not modern English. my brother recognised that it was not
my</B>
<P><B>voice, he got a little bit scared. He did not open the door to find
out.</B>
<P>
<P><B>By the time I came back, I asked him what was wrong as his face was</B>
<P><B>white. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Once again, I was there for a year on my own, I never heard or</B>
<P><B>encountered anything.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Finally, Eleven encounter</B>
<P>
<P><B>My brother used to study in a boarding school in the UK. One night,
he</B>
<P><B>was the only one in his domitory (room), suddenly he heard this
female</B>
<P><B>crying noise, it was like she was in pain, a very ugly sound. It
sounded</B>
<P><B>very distance at the beginning but eventually it sounded from
somewhere</B>
<P><B>next to him,like someone whispering at your ear, he got very
frightened</B>
<P><B>and ran.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Thank you for reading this long description of my family encounters.</B>

<H3><A NAME=gray>The Rider in Gray</A>
</H3><P><B>by 	Alden_Woodside@hp.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was a child I grew up in Chesterfield Va. It is a small
southern</B>
<P><B>town south of Richmond. During the War between the States the</B>
<P><B>Confederate defenses ran all the way down from Richmond through</B>
<P><B>Chesterfield and on to Petersburg. Some of those earthworks are still</B>
<P><B>there today and were right in my backyard. There were woods behind
the</B>
<P><B>house I grew up in and my Dad built a tree house for me and my
brothers</B>
<P><B>to play in.</B>
<P><B>	One summer evening around 6 or 7 when the sun was going down my
brother</B>
<P><B>and I were up in the tree house goofing around. When my brother told
me</B>
<P><B>to be quiet that he thought he heard something. When I sat still I
heard</B>
<P><B>what he was hearing. It sounded like a galloping horse and it was</B>
<P><B>getting nearer and nearer. We both looked at each other and jumped
up to</B>
<P><B>the tree house window and looked down toward the dircetion of the
sound.</B>
<P><B>That is when we saw him, it was a large man on a horse galloping
really</B>
<P><B>fast and he kept looking behind him like someone was chasing him. He</B>
<P><B>wore the Confederate Gray and had a large brown beard with a long
saber</B>
<P><B>at his side. His hosre was white with gray around the hooves. He
sudenly</B>
<P><B>came to a stop and reared the horse around in circles like he did not</B>
<P><B>know what way to go. Then he turned back and rode in the direction
he</B>
<P><B>had just came and then disapeared as he rode into the trees. This is</B>
<P><B>when my brother and I took off towards our house more excited then</B>
<P><B>scared. My father told us that many people have seen the ghost and
that</B>
<P><B>it always appeared at dusk. They called him the Rider in Gray. </B>
<P><B>	The woods where we saw the ghost has since been developed with
houses</B>
<P><B>and from what I understand nobody sees the ghost any more. But I'm
sure</B>
<P><B>if you talk to a local they can tell you a story about the Rider in</B>
<P><B>Gray!!!</B>

<P><B>For my last spring break, a group of friends and I decided to take
a</B>
<P><B>road trip.  Our first overnight stop was in Delta, Colorado which was
</B>
<P><B>the home town of one of my friends.</B>
<P><B>	My friend told us about a nearby cemetary that was supposed to</B>
<P><B>be haunted by evil spirits.  Apparently a black cloud could be seen</B>
<P><B>moving around the cemetary by people who believed they were
psychically</B>
<P><B>aware of such things.  Feeling brave and wanting to see some </B>
<P><B>ghosts, we took a Polaroid camera and headed to the cemetary around</B>
<P><B>10:00 PM on a night with a new moon.</B>
<P><B>	The cemetary was on the top of a steep hill with a rickety old </B>
<P><B>fence around it.  The path to the gate was steep but easy to climb.
 We</B>
<P><B>entered the cemetary and started snapping pictures.  It was a small</B>
<P><B>cemetary with small headstones at the heads of mounds of rocks which</B>
<P><B>were over the graves.  There were three very large cast iron
headstones</B>
<P><B>at the back of the cemetary.  One of the headstones had some eerie</B>
<P><B>scratches on it.  They looked like they were gouged into the iron but</B>
<P><B>the iron was smooth.  We all started getting scared so we decided to
</B>
<P><B>leave.  I was the first one to the gate.</B>
<P><B>	As I started down the path, I felt something pushing me in the lower</B>
<P><B>back.  It felt like someone with their hand on my back but my closest</B>
<P><B>friends were five feet back.  Then the pressure increased and
something</B>
<P><B>scratched my back.  I fell down the path and hurried to the car.  My</B>
<P><B>friends practically ran to catch up with me.</B>
<P><B>	Later, after my more squeamish friends had gone to bed, I told my</B>
<P><B>friend who had suggested going to the cemetary what had happened. 
He</B>
<P><B>asked to see my back.  There were scratchs exactly where I had felt
them</B>
<P><B>form while falling down the path.  The scratches exactly matched the</B>
<P><B>scratches on the headstone in the cemetary.</B>
<P><B>	I've got pictures of the scratches on my back and the scratches on
the</B>
<P><B>headstone.  I intend to go back to the cemetary during the day to get
a</B>
<P><B>better look at the headstone.</B>
<P><B>	Also, we had some really strange things show up in the Polaroid</B>
<P><B>pictures we took in the cemetary that night.  I definitely want to
take</B>
<P><B>more pictures in that cemetary.</B>

<H3><A NAME=mall>Century III Mall Ghost Story</A>
</H3><P><B>by 	bcoffey@bu.edu</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is a true account of my experiences at Century III Mall in </B>
<P><B>West Mifflin, Pa.  My friend Stacy and I worked in a bakery that her
</B>
<P><B>parents owned.  One Friday the mixer broke and the part needed to fix
</B>
<P><B>the mixer could not be shipped to us until Monday.  With a busy weekend
</B>
<P><B>coming up and barely any product to sell, my friend and I decided to
stay </B>
<P><B>overnight handmixing dough.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	Everything started happening around midnight.  We were sitting in
</B>
<P><B>front of the store drinking coke and smoking cigarettes.  I was facing
</B>
<P><B>the railing where I could see down to the first floor and Stacy was
</B>
<P><B>facing toward the rest of the food court area.  Near the stairs going
to </B>
<P><B>the first floor I saw a 2 foot tall, black, cylindrically shaped object
</B>
<P><B>with legs.  It would appear on one side of Stacy, disappear, and then
</B>
<P><B>appear on her other side.  This happened for about fifteen minutes
before </B>
<P><B>Stacy asked what I was staring at.  After I explained, she mentioned
that </B>
<P><B>she had been seeing the same object behind me except that what she
saw </B>
<P><B>was running into the wall, appearing behind me on my other side, and
so on.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	We began feeling hot and then cold to the point where we could </B>
<P><B>see gooseflesh on our arms.  A rush of noise like a crowd in a football
</B>
<P><B>stadium was heard coming through the food court.  I noticed a glint
of </B>
<P><B>light on the metal of the railing and I watched as it rose and fell.
 </B>
<P><B>Considering that I could see no moving light source that would enable
</B>
<P><B>this glint to achieve its varying degrees of height, I was quite </B>
<P><B>disturbed when eventually an impossibly bright ray of light shot up
from </B>
<P><B>the glint of light to the ceiling.  I gestured for Stacy to quickly
look </B>
<P><B>behind her but, as soon as she turned, the ray shot back down with
an </B>
<P><B>audible whoosh, which we both heard. </B>
<P>
<P><B>	Next, we were treated to a light show in the air above the first </B>
<P><B>floor.  Pastel colored lights launched through the air as if a couple
of </B>
<P><B>monkeys had gotten hold of some flashlights and were partying on the
</B>
<P><B>first floor.  We we quite delighted with the light show and although
it </B>
<P><B>was unexplainable, it was not unpleasant.</B>
<P>
<P><B>        	I happened to glance down at Horne's, a department store on
the </B>
<P><B>first floor which was closed for the night.  There was a clear glass
</B>
<P><B>partition over the entrance, no lights were on, and there should have
</B>
<P><B>been no one inside, no one alive that is.  An old man was kneeling
on the </B>
<P><B>floor near the lower right corner of the store entrance.  Inside the
pet </B>
<P><B>shop, which is right next door to Horne's, dogs began barking.  ( I
guess </B>
<P><B>animals can sense apparitions )</B>
<P>
<P><B>	Anyway, I asked Stacy to look down at Horne's and to tell me what
</B>
<P><B>she saw.  She immediately described the old man.  I wondered if he
were a </B>
<P><B>night watchman but after checking out the man from differing angles,
</B>
<P><B>I noticed that, unless you were facing him from a direct angle, he
could </B>
<P><B>not be seen, except for a white light where his head would have been.
</B>
<P><B>Stacy and I decided to retreat into the back of the store to get our
work </B>
<P><B>done and to try to clear our heads of what we considered too much </B>
<P><B>bullshit going on.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	In the back of the store we had our tape deck playing very </B>
<P><B>loudly as we wanted to drown out the sounds of scratching and growling
we </B>
<P><B>heard at the door.  Over the loud music, I could hear the ching of
an old </B>
<P><B>fashioned cash register opening.  Considering that we had an electronic
</B>
<P><B>cash register that was locked up for the night which did not make the
</B>
<P><B>same type of noise, we knew that something unseen was playing with
us, </B>
<P><B>trying to lure us to the front of the store.  Being the curious person
</B>
<P><B>that I am, I opened the front door and said, "All right, what's going
on </B>
<P><B>out here?"  Of course there was no answer and we could no longer hear
the </B>
<P><B>noise so we went back inside.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	After about an hour of mixing, we needed a break and, chronic </B>
<P><B>smokers that we were, a cigarette.  We went back out front and sat
at our </B>
<P><B>little table determined to ignore everything that was going on around
</B>
<P><B>us.  Of course, I could not help but to glance again at Horne's where
I </B>
<P><B>noted that the old man had disappeared and in his place was an old
woman </B>
<P><B>who was rotating as if she were on a potter's wheel.  I, </B>
<P><B>once again asked Stacy to turn and describe what she saw at Horne's.
 The </B>
<P><B>old woman appeared to be aware of us because she stopped her spinning
and </B>
<P><B>stared right back up at us.  Our hearts immediately dropped into our
</B>
<P><B>stomachs and we felt frozen with fear.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	There was a mall employee who was on a riding carpet cleaner.  He
</B>
<P><B>was cleaning all the red carpeted ramps that led up to the major </B>
<P><B>department stores.  We noted that he completely bypassed Horne's and
</B>
<P><B>watched as he continued on to the rest of the mall.  Once he was gone,
we </B>
<P><B>walked down to the front of Horne's.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	We stood in front of the glass partition looking for some </B>
<P><B>evidence of the old man and woman.  We neither saw, nor heard anything.
 </B>
<P><B>As we turned to go back to the store, I noticed white powdery footprints
</B>
<P><B>on the red carpeting.  I sampled a bit of the white powder and it tasted
</B>
<P><B>like the flour we had been using in the back of the store to mix
dough.</B>
<P>
<P><B>  The footprints were of a man's dress shoe with the </B>
<P><B>chuck heels and they were going in the direction from which we had
just </B>
<P><B>come.  Almost as if the thing was trying to get away from us.  Anyhow,
</B>
<P><B>the footprints went all the way up the stairs and they stopped at the
</B>
<P><B>entrance to our store.  They did not continue on further into or away
</B>
<P><B>from the store, they just stopped as if whatever made them had </B>
<P><B>disappeared into thin air, which no doubt, it had.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	All through the night until 8:30 the next morning, we were </B>
<P><B>bombarded by scenes shown on the glass partition of Horne's.  We saw
a </B>
<P><B>couple sitting in a park and a small ballarina doll which was 6 feet
off </B>
<P><B>the ground and spinning a pirrouette.  There was also a bright red
light </B>
<P><B>above the doll's head.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	If anyone has heard of anything similar happening at this mall, </B>
<P><B>please let me know.  Thank you.</B>

<H3><A NAME=die>I Didn't want to Die</A>
</H3><P><B>by jrnm91c@prodigy.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My mother's father was an alcoholic who drank himself to death.  He</B>
<P><B>wouldn't drink in big quantities, but he would take a glass of wine
and</B>
<P><B>sip it all day, he did this for years.  He died and left my mother,
her</B>
<P><B>brother and her mother.  One night, my grandmother (my mother's mom)
was</B>
<P><B>laying in bed reading a book.  She tells us to this day that she was</B>
<P><B>wide awake and not dreaming.  She felt a strange feeling.  She looked
up</B>
<P><B>to her right and his head was floating in the air, but she could see</B>
<P><B>right through it.  He began to speak to her: "Dolores, I didn't want
to</B>
<P><B>die, I'm sorry and I love you", he said.  That's basically it.</B>
