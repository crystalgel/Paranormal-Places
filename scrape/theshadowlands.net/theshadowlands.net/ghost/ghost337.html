<br>
<br>

<br>
Ghost is the most popular problem for us to talk about. Some one
believe in ghost but some one doesn't. I believe in that. And here is
the true story of my cousin. He didn't see it but he felt and he
thought that's it. <br>
My cousin is a doctor. He lives in USA. A few years ago, he went out of
USA to Vietnam for his business. He went to Hanoi ( Vietnam 's
capital). He stayed in a hotel with his partner. When they came in,
they saw the lady who ran so fast out of her room and screamed.
Everyone's so suprise. They didn't know what happend to her. She looked
really sick. Her face looked like that she has just seen the horrible
things. She breathe so hard like a person who ran a long way. My cousin
came to front of her and asked: " What happend?". He gave her some
medicine that make her can control herself. When she a little calm, she
said: " When I was lying in my bed, reading newspapers. Sudently, the
bed was made straight up. I didn't fall down but I heard some sound
that terrible. That's why I ran out there." <br>
My cousin doubted about that. Because he never believe in ghost or
something which not real. His friends dare him to come to that room and
stayed there 3 days. He accepted. That night, before he went to that
room, he asked the waiter for help. Like next morning, just come wake
him up 'cause he must has go to the hospital. The waiter accept. My
cousin came to the room. He tooke a bath. He locked the door, put the
key in. Then, he went to bed.........Suddently, he heard the voice of
the waiter call him. He covered himself in the blanket. The voice
stopped. But the hands put on my cousin body and pushed him. He heard
the voice again. He woke up, took the clock and felt angry. "This was
just 5:15. Why did he wake me this time? It's too early." he wondered.
And he felt asleep soon. But, when he turned aroud his face to the
wall), he fell down on the floor ' cause he just realized that the door
was still locked. The key was still in. He stood up, and went to the
restroom to prepare for go to work today. The second day, nothing
happened. But he still woke up at 5:15. Third day is Saturday, he was
not going to work tomorrow. So, before went to bed, he decided that he
would use some medicine which make u feel asleep. He used 3 tablets.
But, like the days before, he still woke up at 5:15. That day, when he
came out of the room, many eyes of everyone looked at him. His friends
came closer and asked him : " So, what happened in 3 days?". He told
them all about what happened. They were scared of that. He asked the
manager who was standing behind the table and listening to all the
story. " You know something, don't you?", he asked. The manager replied
:" No, I don't. I was really suprised that what I heard.". He looked at
her by the eyes with a little anger. Finally, she said : " Yes, you
right. Something's wrong with that room. We had a customer who want to
rent that room. One day, when we came to that room for clean up. We
discovered that she died, pretty dead. The doctor said she killed
herself&nbsp; and she really stopped breathe at 5:15..........<br>

In My Lifetime<br>
<br>
By: wandabug42@earthlink.net<br>
<br>
Hello, my name is wanda, I have experienced a few things in my
lifetime, this one recently, not scary or anything but strange. I lost
a pet two years ago when he was still a puppy, Bernie got hit by a car
and died all alone in the road while in my mothers care, I came home
from work and we buried him, my brother and I. I loved him so much I
put a painted stone on his grave that I had done one year. well like I
said that was two years ago, and twice recently I have experienced the
oddest sensations. both times I was lying in my bed trying to fall
asleep when I felt something like little feet walking up my leg and
settling in down around my knee area like a cat curling up or a small
dog.It felt so real, but i tried to explain it away thinking maybe my
circulation was doing something wierd in my leg, then a couple weeks
later it happened again, it walked up my leg and curled up on my knee
area, this time I had no delusions I was sure it was bernie come back
to lay down and be with me. since then I shared my experience with a
girlfriend and she claims thast when she spent the night here on my
couch she felt the same thing. we even got a ghost picture, my sisters
dog was here and my friend geri took a picture with her disc camera of
the dog and there is a big white circular mass over the dog with what
looks to be a foot appearing or taking shape rather. I have no doubt
its bernie and hes playing with that dog even as spirit. I have another
experience i can share with you if you're interested, and if you like
can send you the ghost pictureof the dog. sign me a believer, yours
truly <br>

Ghost in my Little Sisters Room<br>
<br>
By: Lauren1602@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I have two sisters, both younger than me, When one of my sisters was
younger she would tell me she could hear someones voice calling her
sometimes and so she would go downstairs to find that no one had called
her. A few years afterwards my youngest sister moved in to her room
instead, she was only a baby at the time. One night my mum woke up to
the sound of her shouting "no, go away, dont shoot at me". so my mum
went to see what was wrong an my sister pointed to the corner of the
room. my mum looked but there was nothing, so she asked her what was
there and my sister replied "little boy.". My mum told her she couldnt
see any little boy and my sister told her "little boy hiding now...".
Also i once did the vacuuming in that room, and when i went to switch
off the vacuum i found that it was already off at the plug, and i had
just done the entire vacuuming somehow with the vacuum switched off!<br>

An Unusual sighting in New Brighton<br>
<br>
By: colin.underhill@ntlworld.com <br>
<br>
Some 8 years ago I was on the beach in New Brighton (with an old
boyfriend) and we both noticd strange fast flickering lights in the
sky, but could not explain what they were.<br>
They appeared to be like the light on a torch when it is moved quickly but thousands of feet up in the sky .<br>
After a few moments I noticed that there was an illuminous cloud
directly over the water.&nbsp; There were no lights around us except
for this cloud that appeared from nowhere and these bright disc shaped
lights seemed to be falling into the top of the cloud and settling at
the bottom of the cloud.<br>
A few disc shapes lights would appear together then only a single
one.&nbsp; My ex saw exactly the same as I did and there were other
around us that witnessed it too but none of us spoke to each other.<br>
We got a bit scared after about 30 minutes and decided to drive off and
as we did so I looked back and saw the cloud seemed to be sitting above
a large piece of rock that looked like wet coal - I saw wet because it
was glimmering against the light from the cloud.<br>
The disc shaped lights were still flurrying into the cloud and the people were still watching it when we left.<br>
We didn't know what it was or how it got there but a few months later there was a write up in the newspaper about it.<br>
Also....<br>
My parents used to live in a 6 bedroomed house in Liverpool. It was my
Aunts house and we moved into it when I was 12.&nbsp; I always said
there were eyes watching me all over the house except for the bathroom
and I never felt comfortable in it.<br>
When I was old enough I left home and thought nothing more about
it.&nbsp; My parents decided after 26 years as my brother and I had
grown up and left home that the house was too much for them and decided
to sell.<br>
My old boyfriend and I went over to the hosue to help my parents with the move and stayed in the living room/bedroom/ensuite.<br>
It was quite early in the morning and we were talking about the move
etc and all of a sudden what seemed to be like a large bubble appeared
in front of the bed right by the window it was about 2 foot wide and 2
ft high and in the middle of the bubble was a large brown eyeball - it
had a black pupil with a glimmer of light in the middle and white all
around the eye like a normal eyeball.&nbsp; It looked as if it was
encased in a bubble and it shimmered like a bubble and it moved slowly
at first in a diagonal up the wall and as it did so it got smaller and
smaller.&nbsp; My old boyfriend spoke to it and asked it what it wanted
I was too scared to speak but it disappeared into the wall leaving a
tiny white spark as it disappeared.&nbsp; Still cannot explain it to
this day.<br>

Bourbon Orleans Hotel, New Orleans<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I've seen references to the Bourbon Orleans Hotel in New Orleans on your<br>
website.&nbsp; I'm not a big believer in the paranormal, but I thought it was<br>
interesting to learn about a supposedly haunted site that I was going to<br>
visit.&nbsp; I was a guest at the Bourbon Orleans during the 2001 Christmas<br>
holidays.&nbsp; My family and I occupied a "townhouse suite", which was located<br>
on the fourth and fifth floors.&nbsp; The suite had a large living area on the<br>
lower level, with a sleeper sofa, dining area, and french doors to the<br>
balcony.&nbsp; The upper level had a bedroom and bathroom.&nbsp; There was a door to<br>
the fifth floor hallway in the bedroom.<br>
During the first night, I got up to go to the bathroom.&nbsp; As I was sitting<br>
there, I remember wishing that I had put my robe on, as the bathroom was<br>
marble and rather chilly.&nbsp; Just at that moment, a towel, that had been<br>
neatly folded on the brass rack above the toilet, fell onto my shoulders.<br>
Needless to say, I finished my business very quickly.<br>
As you may know, for many years the hotel was a convent and orphanage, run<br>
by the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament, an order of African American nuns.<br>
The second night of our stay, I awoke just before 1:00 to the sensation that<br>
I was being stared at intently by a black nun, wearing the distinctive habit<br>
of the order.&nbsp; The sensation didn't feel malevolent; instead it just felt as<br>
if she was trying to figure out who I was and why I was there.&nbsp; At that<br>
instant, the clock radio in the bedroom came on full blast.<br>
The final incident happened the last night of our stay.&nbsp; At about 3:00 in<br>
the morning, I heard the sounds of children running past the door of the<br>
bedroom.&nbsp; That may not sound too unusual, but how many parents let their<br>
children (and it sounded like 5 or 6 of them) run laughing down a hotel<br>
hallway at 3 am?<br>

True Stories<br>
<br>
By: RoCkinxShaWtii@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I grew up in the Ypsilanti/Belleville area of Michigan, and I heard the
stories about Denton Rd. Bridge and other so-called "haunted" places in
our town and in the nearby Canton. I came from a religious background,
and never really believed any of the things that I was told. When I was
around 15 or so my disbelief about the stories I heard changed. The
summer before I turned 16 I was living great, a lot of my friends had
gotten their licenses and one of our FIRST trips was to Denton Rd.
Bridge in Canton. We all laughed about the things we had heard and
jokingly questioned if any of the things would happen to us. Following
the tradition we stopped and parked the car on the bridge and got out.
Walking slowly back and forth across the bridge, we started hearing the
faint cries of what sounded like a baby. Never thinking much about it,
thinking it could be from a house down the road, we kept pacing back
and forth across the bridge. The cries got louder and then were
followed by the sound of a woman. Nothing audible, you could just make
out the sounds of a woman's voice. Some of us started getting a little
spooked - but there was no reason to "abort" the mission - - yet. Not
too long after we heard the baby and the woman, we noticed car lights
coming towards us, thinking it could be the cops we ran and jumped back
into the car where my friend proceeded to act like the car had stalled
in case it was the cops and they wanted to know why we were stopped,
though as soon as the lights got almost to us, they were gone. Just
like that. Now I was definatly spooked...What would cause car lights to
just vanish? Nothing that I could think of. My friends and I were all
looking at each other and talking loudly about what had just happened,
when one of the girls sitting in the backseat started screaming and
pointing to the windows on the passenger side of the car - all of which
had tiny handprints all over them. We took off out of there fast. Only
later did I learn that supposedly a group of kids (?) died on that
bridge as well and now they attempt to push you over the bridge. The
scariest part of the handprints being there - was none of us knew this
legend.<br>
That wasn't the only scary place in town I visited...I had to been to
the Denton Bridge in Belleville as well, and although nothing OVERLY
scary happened there, the group of people I was with there once noticed
a guy dressed all in black coming towards us, we all got back in the
car and started to drive away (towards the direction he was) and he was
gone, just like that. Nowhere to be found. <br>
The scariest place I think I have ever been though, is Soop Cemetary,
located on Old Denton Rd (on the S.Service Dr.) So many things happened
there that I witnessed over the years. Plus there is just a fear there,
as soon as you pass through the gates that just cant be described. Even
people who know nothing about the cemetary (theres various witches
buried for example.) feel a terror that they cant describe. One
instance I'll never forget is two male friends along with my best
friend and I were walking through there late one night with walkie
talkies. My girlfriend and I used the walkie talkies to determine where
the two guys were in the cemetary - making sure they didn't try to
scare us. Out of nowhere a deep voice came over on our walking talkie,
and we couldn't make out what it was saying. I two-wayed back yelling
at the guys to "stop fucking" around. Just then the guys walked up
behind us wanting to know what we were talking about, I started yelling
at them for trying to scare us, and the whole time they acted like they
didn't know what was going on. Thinking they were still just messing
with us, my friend took the other walkie talkie and we continued
walking farther back. The whole time the walkie talkie going off and
that deep voice saying things we couldn't make out. We tried talking
back, and it seemed like it was responding to us, so thinking that
possibly it was a CB radio or maybe even another walkie talkie we were
picking up on we disregarded it and turned down a path that lead
through the headstones. Just then a fear came over me, worse than any I
had - had since we'd been in there. I suddenly decided we needed to
leave, something didn't want us there and I no longer wanted to be
there either. So I annonced "Alright guys, we're leaving..NOW" just
then, the voice came back over the walkie talkie in my hand answering
"Good Idea."<br>
I have many more stories about Soop, which I would be happy to share. I
wouldn't call the experiences I've had there due to "ghosts", since I
was raised differently, but I do know one thing, After all those things
happening, you won't catch me NEAR that cemetary..EVER. <br>

Ivy Drive Elementary school<br>
<br>
<br>
By: jjelsner@sbcglobal.net <br>
<br>
<br>
Ok well, my story isnt horribly long as other's ive been but here it is. <br>
One night me and my friend Crystal decide we wanted to go for a walk
and of course had our cigarettes with us but we decided maybe we could
go walk through the school just for a walk. <br>
But I don't like this school because five or more years ago, a kid who
was 17 or 18 at the time decided he would kill himself in those very
woods we had to pass. the only seperation between us and the woods was
a feeble fence. Well I'm sitting there freaked by going by because i
dont like going in there at night. There are two openings. One where we
stood, a small metal fence and a white house on the other side with a
picket fence. The other was on the other end of the street which wasn't
as wooded and it had a brown house too, both paths led into the school,
the back of the school next to their baseball diamond. So after a few
long moments of debating, I gave in and let her drag me into the
school. Now the path into the school that we took, (the woods with the
hanging boy) its always dark until you get to the smoothed pavement
with lots of light and a playground and swings, etc. So we got to the
light but before hand i kept my eyes down t the ground and i clenched
to Crystal's jacket. We walked slowly through and came to the
playground area, kept walking, came to the small storage building which
was across the janitor's parking (its some weird little area by the
playground). So Crystal thought she could freak me out more so she
paused and smiled at me. "Wouldn't it be freaky if something happened
right now?" After she said this we instantly heard, and i kid you not,
a little girl crying or creaming along with scratching on some kind of
metal. So we ran, i really mean, we ran. Me, i was swearing head to
foot with every vulgar loanguage imaginable. it scared me half to death
more than half. SO i was panting, f aking out, crying. But I know i
will NEVER go there anymore at night. But the weird thing is, my
parents walked up there about half an hour after we left because i
called them crying, so my dad came to find us. He too, heard the same
thing and thought it was me, of course it wasn't me, hello, i was 100%
out of there.<br>
Two days later or maybe one i dont remember it was alittle later than
before and we invited a couple guys to go with us but since i was soo
incredably resistant, i stayed behind with one of the guys and Crystal
and the other guy went in, ten minutes later they came out where we sat
which was at the other entrance and she was pale as ever. The guy
explained we gotta leave so we got up and left the area only until a
street away, crystal was shaking and said. " Ray covered my eyes and
told me to be calm and keep walking, so we did and i didnt know what he
was hidng so he told me, a little child like figure came walking
towards us as we were walking slowly then quickly through," With that
she shut up and remained pale. Her complextion, ive never seen befiore,
that way made me feel uneasy about the area and told myself never again
am i going in at night.<br>

Ghost in the Basement<br>
<br>
By:emmaw77@go.com<br>
<br>
hello there, my name is emily and i would like to share with you a story from my old house.<br>
see i believe our old house was haunted. there were several instances,
among them is the one i am about to share with you. this one happened
in the basement. me and my slightly older sister went to the basement
to get a ball so we could play. well as we were looking for this ball,
i saw a spider on the wall. back then i was interested in spiders, so i
couldnt help it but go and look. well, i put my hand over it and a few
seconds later i felt a tickling on my hand so i picked my hand up. i
looked at the wall first, it was empty. then i looked at my hand and
could see nothing. it didnt bother me much, i thought i may have
dropped it then.<br>
well we looked for the ball, and found it. then i looked at the wall
once more, and saw the same spider. so needless to say, i put my hand
over it once more. a few moments later i felt that same tickle on my
hand, i did the same steps as before and could not find the spider.<br>
my sister got bored of being in the basement, and i must say we were
both a little scared. well, she and i were walking up the steps when
she turned back. she swears that she saw a shady, mist-like figure
standing at the bottom step dropping a washrag. i looked back and didnt
see anything, but that washrag was not there before when we came down.
we ran upstairs screaming, and i dropped the ball.<br>
although i didnt want to, i had to go back and get that stupid ball. as
i went down, i felt a presence. it scared me, it felt like something
was looking at me, as if it wanted to eat me. i didnt feel safe at all.
i ran back up the steps, and slipped three from the top. it scared me
so bad! i tried to get up, but fell again because something had my
foot. i kicked blindly and got up again. i turned just before i shut
the door and saw the misty figure.<br>
he was huge with short dark hair, his teeth were pointy and sharp, he
had a white shirt and blue jeans on. none of my family got me to go
down there again.<br>
also among other things that happened in that house, we had a few more
things happen. there were footsteps heard, even when no one else was
home. there was toys moved, and beds made, when no one had touched
them. there was even a spider that i swear i had killed once and when i
came back with a tissue to throw it away, it was alive and walking
around once more.<br>
i'm happy that we finally moved, but now i'm wondering if that presance
moved with us. there is now sounds coming from the basement at odd
hours of the night and creaking windows. my mother is a firm believer
that its just the house setteling. but i think there is someone there.<br>

Corrections on Haunting Site<br>
<br>
By: rocker_chick0688@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
Georgetown - Annie Pearl Elementary School - Everyone<br>
called her the nine o'clock ghost. A little girl was<br>
killed on the play ground by her own mother because<br>
she could not take care of her. Now every night if you<br>
drive by with your lights off and windows down you can<br>
see one of the swings moving back and fourth and you<br>
can hear a small sweet voice sing "ring around the<br>
rosy pockets full of poses ashes ashes will you come<br>
and play with me please!" <br>
I am a resident of Georgetown, Texas, and found your<br>
website through a search engine. I decide to see<br>
whether or not the statement above was true. First of<br>
all, you can't witness it from the road, you have to<br>
park in the parking lot, and actually walk on to the<br>
playground itself. This site is trully real, and even<br>
though I didn't see the swing swinging back and forth,<br>
as soon as I got near the swing, I heard a girl laugh.<br>
It was weird, because we got there after nine, but as<br>
soon as we stepped foot on the playground, the church<br>
bell started to ring. Yeah, but my friend heard this<br>
little girl crying, and calling momma, and she said<br>
that she heard music (like a jewerly box). Then we<br>
decide to walk towards where the sound was coming<br>
from, and I couldn't hear anything, so I decided to<br>
start singing ring around the roses, and when I did my<br>
friends hit me, and we went to sit down. Then all of a<br>
sudden I heard a little girl singing ring around the<br>
roses, and my friend and I were like did you hear<br>
that? Then she said that she heard it again, but it<br>
was like demonic. We freaked out and started to run,<br>
and my shoe came off, and my friend said oh my god,<br>
and I later found out that she saw a child like shape<br>
standing in the distance, and that it turned around,<br>
and that when she looked back, it was gone. Also when<br>
we left, a light that wasn't on before, was on when we<br>
left. I hope I helped, a little.<br>
Thanx for the site<br>

Middleport NY<br>
<br>
By: txmtb2000@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
It is a large house made into four apts. I had weird experiences of the
enighbors avoiding contact with me at the house but when they would see
me in town, they would be very freindly - as if nothing was wrong yet
these same people, when they would see me at the house would avoid me
like the plague. And on Halloween, we couldnt get anyone to come and
get the candy, trick-or-treaters would walk right past us and look at
us and keep going. Later we found out that house has the legendary-like
status of being the haunted house of Middleport. We experienced a few
things in the house but never considered the idea until someone came
over and walked in the house and suddenly realized where he was. he was
emphatic and didnt stay long. He got spooked and after telling us it
was haunted- he left abruptly.<br>

The Traveling Ghost<br>
<br>
By: PurplePlaidPunk7@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
First of all, this is one of the coolest sites ever =)!!!&nbsp; But
anyway, I'll get to my story. I don't remember the year that it
happened nor the age that I was. I still remember it, though, as if it
were yesterday.<br>
So, my aunt just got a new computer. She was never a technology ace or
anything, so she had no idea how to get it started. When all else
fails, call my mother! My mom was a whiz at computers, so my aunt asked
her to come over and hook up the darn thing. My mother, being the
lovely lady that she is, agreed to do it within the week. It was
actually that weekend that she decided to do it. So, mom decides she
wants to go over my aunt's house kinda late for some reason. I was very
young and could not stay by myself so she took me along, since calling
a baby-sitter at the last minute would be rude. We finally get there. I
look up at the house, admiring its large size. I did think it looked
kinda scary though. We struggled getting inside because my mom could
not see the keys. As soon as we did get inside, I was frightened. All
of the lights were off and nobody was there. Or so I thought...<br>
My mom wanted to get started with her work since it was maybe 9:00
already. She told me to stay upstairs and watch T.V while she was in
the basement hooking up the computer. After a while of whining about
staying upstairs all alone in the large house, I finally agreed. My
mother stayed with me for bout 5 minutes showing me how to work the
T.V. I begged and pleaded for her not to go, but it was her duty as a
sister to fix the computer. She finally went downstairs and I was left
all alone in the huge living room. I decided to turn on cartoons,
thinking it would cheer me up a little. I finally started to calm down
and even laughed at the silliness of the cartoons. Then all of the
sudden I heard this loud noise in the kitchen. Apparently, my mom
hadn't heard it and to me she was God so anything she said went. After
she said nothing, I proceeded to ignore the noise. But then it happened
again. I ignored it. It happened again. I ignored it. It happened
again. By that time I was so annoyed at the noise because it was
disturbing my cartoons. I was so mad I forgot my rule about my mom and
I jumped up from the couch turned around and almost yelled "SHUT
UP!!!!!" when I saw this mist in the kitchen. It seemed like it was in
the shape of an elderly woman with a long white dress and long white
hair. I was so shocked I couldn't scream. But I could still move so I
ran as fast as my little legs could carry me downstairs into the
basement and into my precious mother's arms. I didn't tell her quite
what happened, as I was still in shock, awe, and amazement at the
creature that had stood before me. I only explained about the noises.
She said she was hearing little noises, not loud noises, around where
she was. I stayed down there with her because she said I could,
especially when she saw my little white face. As I was sitting on the
couch, playing with numerous toys that were scattered about, I heard a
soft bark. Then I heard a whimper and then another soft bark. I knew it
was coming from the room that held the water tank and such. I thought
about the dog, Oreo. it must have been him. But then I remembered he
died about a couple months before. My aunt and uncle at the time owned
no animals, not even a bird. And it was way too late for someone to let
their dog out. Besides, I don't think I would have heard a dog, as I
don't believe anyone in the community owned one. What frightened me the
most was that poor little Oreo, a dog that had been banished to live
outside for no reason and was never fed, died on the ground right above
where I had heard the noise. I told my mom about this. She said that
she heard nothing. I told her to hurry up with the computer, which she
did because she was hearing things, too. We both ran up the steps and
out the door. After we locked it, we ran to the car and got in. I was
scared because the car was not starting up. Then all of a sudden it
did! I was so happy to be out of there. <br>
My cousin had heard noises such as the ones I heard in the kitchen,
except they were outside of his room. Also, my other cousin claims that
he heard a noise int the oven like something was in it. He opened the
oven and saw a heavyset man in a white, bloodstained shirt.<br>
Now I mentioned in the title that this was a traveling ghost. I say
this because most, if not all, of that family's houses have had some
sort of scariness to them. My cousin's current residence is just as
haunted. Doors will open and close by themselves. One time, we were
watching a movie. It was over and I went to turn the lights on. When I
turned them on, I heard a strange buzzing sound in the laundry room. It
sounded like when the dryer is done drying clothes, only it was a
steady, non-pausing sound. I walked over to the doors and started to
put my ear up to it to make sure the sound was coming from that room.
As I did so, all of the lights went off and the DVD player suddenly
turned on much louder than we had it on. But the thing was, the DVD
player had been off the whole time! When the everything came on, I
jumped 5 feet in the air onto my poor cousin where I proceeded to
scratch her neck, holding on for dear life. I don't remember ever
watching a movie down there again! Later, we asked his mom if she was
doing laundry. She asked why and we told her about the sound. She said
she didn't even think about doing a load of laundry. To this day, I am
still scared to stay over my cousin's house.<br>

The Kids<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp; star0731@comcast.net<br>
<br>
this is 2 stories jammed into one so thats why it might seem long! my
first one, i refer to it as " the 'kids' down the street" well for some
odd reason it only occurs in the summer. but usualy on summer nights i
would be in my room which is on the front of the house. I hear the
yelling and laughter of kids about my age ( i am only 11!) so i would
look out my window and no one was there, where the noise was comming
from. the street that i live on is a dead-end street and the noise was
comming from the side more twoards the dead-end. the next night the
same thing happened and this time i went downstairs and looked out the
front door. still nothing. the next night it happened again, this time
i was a little concernerd so i went outsige on my driveway and the
noise kept going and no one was there to make it. the second story i
refer to as " my closet" well the firts months while we were here there
would asways be this dark shadow in my closet. i didnt notice it until
about now, but it has been getting darker until recently. about two
days ago the blury shadow had changed to a clear light purple figure.
it takes the figure of a women. but i need to add this in....... the at
night it is just the women and in the morining when the sun is out when
i just wake up, it is 2 people a man and a women and it looks like they
r getting maried! but that is also just a blur and it is only there
half the time now when it always used to be there! thax 4 reading my
stories. and feel free to email me if u have anything to say&nbsp; <br>

&nbsp;California Duplex<br>
<br>
By: aimee.walker@sbcglobal.net<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When my sister and were young, we lived in a newer duplex in
california.&nbsp; It was a small place with only two bedrooms so my
sister and I had to share a room. We had our beds on opposite walls,
but they both faced the hall. On one side of the hall was my parents
bed room on the other was the bathroom, and in the middle of the
ceiling was a big square florecent light, I think thats where it lived.
I can't exactly remember when it started, all I remember is waking in
the middle of the night and seeing what I remember as the electricity
man. It seemed to come out of the light (which my parents left on to
help us sleep) It looked like a person, but seemed made from the light.
This happened several times over the few years we lived in the duplex.
I never told anyone about what had happened until about 15 years later.
My sister and I had come to visit my parents, we were all sitting in
the living room talking about our childhhood, when my sister had asked
if I remembered anything strange about the duplex. I asked what she
meant by strange, she asked if I had ever seen anyone in the hall. I
then told her about my expierience with the electric man, turns out dhe
saw the same thing.&nbsp; <br>

Haunting<br>
<br>
By: ksass@advantagefoods.com<br>
<br>
I worked at 14A Madison Road in Fairfield, New Jersey for about eight
years.&nbsp; Most of our hauntings occurred after 9:00 p.m..&nbsp; We
had a wooden walkway that was used to transport literature to a room
above the offices.&nbsp; Late at night we would hear footsteps on the
walkway.&nbsp; My monitor in my cubicle was shut off - and I saw the
reflection of a face (not mine) on the monitor, when I turned around
no-one was there.&nbsp; I was personally dragged across the warehouse
floor while my co-worker Judy looked on in horror.&nbsp; Judy also
heard food steps behind her on her electro-static mat - when she turned
around no-one was there!<br>

Weird Experiences<br>
<br>
By: colin.underhill@ntlworld.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I worked in a record shop quite a number of years ago now nothing
special about that.... but after the owner sacked the manageress I got
given the job but the owner did not get me any other help so when I
needed to go to the loo I had to close the shop.<br>
The loo was upstairs and one morning just before opening I popped into the loo and experienced an OOBE.<br>
I was sitting on the toilet and the next minute I was walking towards the door but about 5 or 6 inches off the ground.<br>
I walked over to the door and then looked back and my body was still sitting on the loo but not moving.<br>
I heard a noise downstairs and realised that someone was trying the
door and I panicked and the feeling I got was like drowning but in air.<br>
I was grasping at the air to get back inside my own body and after what
seemed like an age I was sucked back into it with a jolt.<br>
I was really shocked by the whole ordeal and it was some years later
when I was talking to a nurse and we were speaking of weird things and
I mentioned the OOBE and she said lots of people mainly elderly people
could get an OOBE if they were (excuse me but this is exactly what she
said) straining on the loo as their heart could stop and thus starting
an OOBE.<br>
I had a heart murmer when I was 15 and Palpitations when I was 40. So could I have died and then come back somehow?<br>
It was a strange experience none the less.<br>
My other experience was when a friend and I decided to visit a
spiritualist church.&nbsp; Neither of us had been before and so we were
both naturally nervous.&nbsp; First of all she said as we were walking
down the road.<br>
"Let's not go I don't want to go through with this!"&nbsp; I talked her
round and ten minutes later I said the same thing to her and she talked
me round we did this all the way down the road and as we were
approaching the church decided we were going for a drink instead and
were just about to go into the pub when we saw someone get out a car
and go into the church.<br>
My friend decided that we should go in with someone else and started
walking nearer the church a man got out of a taxi and started towards
the church we followed him but he disappeared into thin air - now we
were at the door.&nbsp; We both walked into the church and I felt
compelled to get into the hall - it was a packed hall and yet there
were only two chairs second row from the front.<br>
We were late and normally at 7.45 the doors are shut to stop the talk
being interupted but the door wasn't shut and we walked in freely.<br>
We sat in the only two chairs left in the hall (people were standing)
the atmosphere was freezing and when the medium came in i got a message
immediately from my Grandfather.<br>
I was told "You are going to be offered a bowl of rosy red apples you
will take one and it will be rotten to the core stick with what you
have got!"<br>
I was unsure what this meant until a few months later and I hooked up
with an old flame and ended up leaving my family, job, and flat it
lasted just six weeks and I came back to my hometown with nothing.<br>
My Grandfathers words ringing in my ears "Stick with what you have got!"<br>
I wish I had listened to him.<br>

Everyday Occurances for Me?<br>
<br>
By: jonadam@bellsouth.net<br>
<br>
<br>
My name is Adam and I am from Georgia. This will be the first time that
I have ever told my ghost story on the net and even then, I've only
told my ghost story to only a select few, as i feel that if I tell too
many people, they will run away screaming " A witch!! A witch!!!
Elmer!! Billy Bob!! ya'll fetch ya'lls fire, we got us a witch!!"<br>
With all joking aside, My experience started on my 13th birthday. I
remember that, because I had a couple of friends over, spending the
night with me. Now before I go completely into the story, You should
know that my house was (at the time)only 8 years old. The house was
completed in 1979. The house resides on 52 acres of land, but the land
and the surrounding land, has its own history. The property was a apart
of a major Indian trail. This was before Georgia was settled. My uncle
(a history buff)has also told me stories of remnants of an old civil
war rail road track that resided on our property, but I have yet to
ever find it.<br>
Now to begin with the story.<br>
It was 1988 and I had just turned 13. My parents had gone to bed, which
left me and my 2 friends. (I'll call them Jim and William) We were
upstairs in my room, when we heard footsteps coming up the stairs. I
thought maybe it was my father, coming to tell us to be a little bit
more quiet.(my parents bedroom was directly below me.) Well, the
footsteps came all the way up, but no one came into the room. I yelled
out "Hello?" but got no reply. Ignoring my friends, I walked out into
the hallway but saw no one.<br>
I remember being confused, I honestly don't remember being scared, I
guess maybe I should have been, because at that moment something
started walking up the steps, starting from the bottom, going to the
top. I remember thinking "what in the world?" Curiosity had gotten Jim
and William and they had come to see what was going on. They were there
with me when the phantom sounds of footsteps started approaching us. I
remember we all stood there, spellbound and anxious. Anxious because
the footsteps were getting closer. And then, to the last step it
came..... And that was it. No gentle cold breeze, no cold spots. It
just stopped at the last step, before entering the hallway. The rest of
the night was uneventful, but that's all we talked about the rest of
the night, until my parents woke and we regaled them of our story.<br>
That was the beginning of an unseen entity.<br>
The entity wouldn't perform any daily tricks. It wasn't obnoxious,
annoying or a hindrance. As the years went by, it was as if the entity
had no personality. It never identified itself, there was never any
glow nor any shadows. Besides the doors opening and shutting
themselves, there was never any furniture or objects ever moved. But
there was plenty of sounds and they always came from upstairs. The
entity never roamed downstairs.<br>
Almost like it was a boring ghost, dull and plain. Now I can say this
though, It seems like it alway revolved around me, the entity that is.
My brother always thought lightly of it until he had an encounter with
it one night. <br>
I can't remember how long it had been since the entity first appeared
on my 13th birthday, but at the time, my brother was maybe around 10,
possibly younger, when he had his first and last encounter (that I know
of)with the entity.<br>
My brother and I used to share the upstairs bedroom. My bed was to the
opposite side of the wall from my brothers. My brothers bed was closer
to the bedroom door that led to the small hallway which was the exit
for the stairs that led downstairs. At night, while sleeping, we had
all lights out. The only light we used was form the hallway at the
bottom of the stairs. At one point in the middle of the night, my
brother was awoken. I can't remember what had stirred his slumber , but
I remember him telling me, that as soon as he awoke, he had heard
breathing, it had come from the bedroom door, I remember him telling
me, that the breathing came over to his bed and then, he felt something
at the lower edge of the bed, down by the base, as if something was
sitting on the bed. Now, he wasn't able to see anything, only hear
things. Whatever or whomever it was, didn't stay there long and got up,
walked towards the bedroom door, opened the door, and walked out. He
thought maybe it was me, since I have a history of sleep walking. My
brother got up out of bed, turned on the lights, and found me in bed.<br>
He knew of the ghost stories that I had told him previously to this
incident, but had never encountered anything strange. He always thought
that maybe..you know?...that i was just pulling his leg. He had tried
to wake me up, but I wouldn't budge. ( I sleep so hard, that if the
Swedish bikini team came in and molested me, I would have never known.
Not that I would have minded, of course.) Well, this incident kind of
frightened my brother enough for him to spend the rest of the night
downstairs. The next morning (after I had come out of my coma-like
sleep) he told his story, not only to me but to the whole family. The
four of us new nothing of it, which is to say, that my parents nor my
sister had gone upstairs, and of course i was sleeping. <br>
Within the the week, I had the upstairs bedroom by myself. My brother moved downstairs.<br>
Well, as "they" say, time marches on. Years would go by and odd sounds
would emanate from upstairs. One night, my mother was in her bed and
heard heavy footsteps on the floor above her.(remember me saying that
my parents room was directly below my bedroom) she had said that it
sounded like the footsteps were dragging something behind it. Of
course, when she asked me in the morning, I would know nothing of it. <br>
During the summer of 1991, I was 16 and had befriended several younger
guys that all had a sense of exploration and adventure. We had heard of
Satanic houses that existed in several counties, these counties were
close together. Now these Satanic houses were nothing more than old
abandoned houses, that these dark worshipers trespassed on to divulge
their satanic religion. Since I was the only one old enough to drive, I
took us to these old houses. One house we came to, was actually owned
by one of my friends father. Located in the middle of nowhere,
surrounded by fields and a lonely paved highway. At one point, in the
past, this house was very stately and beautiful, now neglect had
wrapped it arms around it. As soon as we walked onto the property, the
warmth of the Georgia humidity and heat escaped us. I kid you not. It
became chilly as soon we walked on that property. <br>
That should have been a sign to us. <br>
As we walked into the house, there was a hallway with 2 doorways to 2
rooms on each side. I still remember looking inside the doorway and
looking down the hall and seeing ceiling boards lying on the floor, I
remember feeling a sense of dread. I don't remember many of the rooms
except for one room that would leave a deep impact into my imagination.
As we walked into the room on the right hand side, we saw on the wall 3
scary images. They weren't painted by an artist but their meaning was
clear enough. They were simple stick figures, painted in black, there
was one other color used....red. On the right side of the macabre
mural, was what looked like to be an Indian with an ax in his hand, red
paint was used to symbolize blood coming from the ax. One leg was
raised, maybe to symbolize dancing. On the left side of the mural was a
werewolf, it also looked like it was dancing. Its mouth open, with
blood coming from the teeth. In the middle of the 2 figures was what
looked like a woman dressed in a black shroud, kneeling before these 2
creatures. This mural left us all feeling a little disturbed. Also in
the room, we found chicken claws minus the chicken it used to be
attached too. We also found an upside down cross made from egg crates.
We left the house vowing to never go back, what we had seen had been
just too much for our young minds to deal with. One of the guys worried
about being cursed for going in there. After we left the house, we
stayed in the area, and ventured to another abandoned house to sit and
talk about our experience. One of my friends and myself had walked out
into the woods, that was when we saw it, about 10 or 15 feet away,
Whatever it was looked like the woman in the black shroud that was on
the mural in the house. It walked slowly, as if injured, then stopped,
looked at us and disappeared. We couldn't see anything, as it was
dressed all in black. My friend and I ran back to base camp and regaled
our story to the rest of the group. The guy who thought we were cursed
from going in the house, went just about into hysterics. <br>
That day was a day that we believed that darkness truly existed. <br>
That day, led to a series of unfortunate events. <br>
One of my friends cut his hand pretty deeply, I wrecked my car 2 times
and on that same highway not 2 miles away, a young teenaged couple,
still in high school lost control of their car and landed in a
rain~swelled creek and drowned. <br>
This all happened on the same day that we ventured into the house.<br>
As I got older, I started having a strong sense of deja vu then I
started having premonitions. At this time, i was in college, I was 22.
I was sitting in the cafeteria, early in the morning having breakfast,
when my sister came into the cafeteria.(she attended the same college.)
as soon as she came in, it felt like this invisible hand, went right
through my chest and touched something inside me, it wasn't a violent
reaction, it was actually pleasant, but as soon as this happened, I
KNEW something was going to happen that morning. I knew this without a
shadow of a doubt. I had no idea what was going to happen, I didn't
know if it was good or bad, but something inside me told me to be
prepared. I remember thinking, "YOU HAVE TO BE READY" but I didn't know
what to be ready for. Well After the episode, I went into class and was
talking with a friend about a certain math problem, (we were sitting in
the very back of the class) when this girl in the front, started
shaking violently, I was calm and I knew what exactly what to do and
what was happening. I got out of my desk, Ran to her, took her out of
her desk and laid her on her side. My teacher asked me what was
happening, I told her she was having a seizure and to call 911. I took
control of the situation and remained completely calm. Since i had
taken and E.M.T training program a year earlier, i knew what needed to
be done. I just kept her on her side and held her until the seizure
passed. My teacher had complimented me on taking control of the
situation and had said, if i hadn't been there, she didn't know what
she would have done. My teacher always highly respected me after that
situation.<br>
In 1998 I dropped out of college due to major depression. I went back
home and hid away from the world inside my room upstairs. I spent most
days in that bedroom, consumed in darkness, sleeping every chance I
got. Strangely enough, the slamming of doors, the footsteps had all
ceased when I left home. They started back up when I came back home.<br>
Dad used to have his study, by the foot of the stairs, he said that one
day, (when he was home by himself.)the doors upstairs began opening and
closing, one by one. Dad made a snide comment, something to the effect
of "Adam must be in a bad mood today" I didn't question my father when
he made that comment.<br>
One time, in the middle of the day, I was taking a nap when i had a
dream. I dreamt of a young woman with long black hair, parted in the
middle. Her skin was pale, I don't know what color her eyes were. In
the dream, a white light surrounded her. She then spoke, saying, "Adam,
it's time to get up, Your father is worrying about you Adam, He's going
to come up here and wake you up." the dream passed and I awoke. I went
downstairs, at the time, my dad has his study near the stairs. As I
walked downstairs, my father said. "How about that! I was just about to
come up their and wake u up!" all I said was "How about that." <br>
Every now and then the young girl with black hair will come to me in
dreams. Matter of fact, in a dream she told me that my sisters second
child was going to be a little girl. She said that the child was going
to have a head full of black hair. The next time I saw my sister, I
told her to find a decent girl name and not to worry with boys names.
She asked why, and I told her "A little birdie told me that you were
going to have a little girl with a head full of black hair" A week
later my sister had her sonogram and sure enough, it was a a little
girl, when my niece was born, she had a head full of black hair.<br>
On December 30, 2004, I had to say goodbye to one of my poodle's. While
I was at the vet with Niko, the assistant had given me a few minutes to
say goodbye to Niko. I held her face in my hands with tears streaming
down my face and I said "Niko, I love you with all my heart baby, if
there's a way, I want you to let me know you are all right . 20 minutes
later, Niko went into an eternal sleep in my arms. I wouldn't have had
it any other way. <br>
A couple of weeks later, I had a dream. Inside the dream, I was holding
Niko's face in my hands and looking in her eyes. Then a disembodied
man's voice said, "She's in good hands Adam, She's being taken care of"
I woke up crying and my heart hurting...maybe hurting isn't such a good
word...maybe a better word would be "aching" My heart ached for an
absolution, but with death, there is never truly an absolution. I was;
however, happy that she came from beyond to let me know she was in good
hands.<br>
The strange happenings that used to occur at my parents house have
stopped. They seemed to have stopped when I left. I have my own place
now, but I've never had anymore paranormal experiences. The deja vu and
premonitions aren't as strong as they used to be. Although from time to
time things do happen, like knowing my niece was going to be a little
girl and the voice in my dream reassuring me that Niko was being taken
care of.<br>
As my brother grew older, he eventually moved upstairs to claim the
room as his. My brother recently moved out without ever having anything
bother him.(that I know of.)<br>
I have no idea what any of it was about.<br>
If you'd like to email me, please feel free.<br>
I apologize for such a lengthy story, but I hope it gives something to you.<br>

Ghost Experiences<br>
<br>
By: super_star652003@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
When I lived in Siegelbach, Germany, in the haus Finkenstrasse 20, my
family and I have witnessed a lot of supernatural experiences. One time
I saw a figure of a kid with black hairsitting on my table in my room.
Another time, i saw my cat as a ghost cat about 3 times even though my
cat was standing right behind me. Once I was home alone and I thought
my mom was here, because I saw her bag. I heard footsteps that sounded
like high-heels, so I called out "MOM!", but no one answered and the
footsteps stopped. The only pet we had then was a cat and he was
sitting right next to me<br>

Shadow Spirit Encounter<br>
<br>
By: marigold33@earthlink.net<br>
<br>
This is an old old story, pushed out of my mind for years and years.&nbsp; It was<br>
1964 or '65, I was four or five years old.&nbsp; Our family, because of my<br>
mother's recurrent mental illness, bounced around from apartment to<br>
apartment, from shelter to shelter, with or without one or both of our<br>
parents in tow.&nbsp; There were four of us, and I do not recall if any of my<br>
siblings were with me when this happened - it might have been at a foster<br>
parent's house, I just don't know.<br>
I remember sitting on the side of a small cot in the waning light of a<br>
Chicago winter.&nbsp; There was an odd, really dark shadow on the wall to the<br>
left of me.&nbsp; It was the size of a small man, and I stared and stared in<br>
disbelief, because it had a hat on, and was in profile.&nbsp; The outline of the<br>
lips, the nose, the forehead was perfect.&nbsp; I was a pro at discerning what<br>
was real and what was not real even at that age, because of my mother's<br>
problem, and I tell you I knew that was I was seeing was real, that I was<br>
not asleep, and that no shadow could have occured that so accidently<br>
duplicated the perfection of the human figure that I saw before my eyes.&nbsp; We<br>
stared at each other for a very long time, the figure never moving.&nbsp; I never<br>
told a soul, as I didn't want to be thrown in the loony bin too.<br>
This is the first of many encounters over the years.&nbsp; My mother had the<br>
gift, my sister really has it, much more than I.<br>

Bambi<br>
<br>
By:nottingham1@alltel.net<br>
<br>
I have lived in my house for 16 years. Because I am a spiritualist
medium I picked up right away that the house and property were
inhabited.&nbsp; But it seems that most of the time that spirits get a
bad rap. Being pranksters, or having no intelligence. Of all the
stories I could tell, I chose this one to show that at least some types
of spirits do have intelligence, and can interact with the living.<br>
My Shetland Sheepdog Bambi was ready and minute to give birth to her
first litter.I have been breeding Collies and Shelties for many years
and know that I have to be there for the first timers in case they run
into problems.<br>
Well Bambi was really nervous. She wasn't the only one. I'm in a
wheelchair, and I knew I was going to have get down on the floor with
her. Her whelping box was in my bedroom, so I thought I could lean
against the bed with my arms behind me and lift.<br>
Bambi waited until my son and my husband were gone, then she went into labor. Great timing.<br>
So I got down on the floor with her and we were both busy. About 4
hours latter and three pups down and more to come. I really needed to
use the bathroom. I was praying that my son would come home soon, real
soon. But my prayers went unanswered.<br>
I tried repeatedly to get onto the bed, but just couldn't do it. It was
to high for me to lift myself high enough to get my butt on it. <br>
Then my senses told me that that I wasn't alone. I asked the spirit,
Mr. Hill if he could please help get on the bed. I told him why. So I
turned around with my back against the bed, with my arms behind me.
Suddenly I could feel an arm under my knees, I was gently lifted onto
the bed. <br>
I was a bit shocked, but I said thank you, I told him how grateful I was for the help.<br>
I used the bathroom and hurried back to Bambi just in time for another
pup to be born. Four hours latter Bambi was finally finished. Her and
her little family of seven pups were settled and my job was done. <br>
But still my son hadn't come home, and my husband wasn't due home for
another two hours. I again asked Mr. Hill if he would be so kind to
help me one more time.<br>
Again he lifted me gently on the bed. <br>
Since that time the spirits have helped me in little ways, like when I
stand up to get into my van, I have felt hands on me supporting me. I
am always grateful for their help. I've joked with them that anytime
they want to do the vacuuming for me, I would really appreciate
that.&nbsp; As of yet, they haven't helped with the house work!<br>

Smith Hall Ghost - Drury College, Springfield, MO<br>
<br>
By: rme80@hotmail.com <br>
<br>
I lived in Smith Hall while attending college at Drury and the stories about <br>
this young girl are absolutely true. She seems to like the eastern hall on <br>
the second floor. I was lucky enough to be on the 3rd floor east but had <br>
several friends that lived on the 2nd floor. A friend of mine had several <br>
encounters in her room. Many involved the little girl hiding the teddy bear <br>
that my friend slept with every night. My friend also was drinking coffee <br>
one morning with her roomate and mentioned that she wished she'd made <br>
another pot of coffee. The pot began brewing coffee even though it was <br>
unplugged. The little girl also liked to hide homework. After missing a <br>
paper that was due to be turned in that day, my friend directly addressed <br>
the girl and asked nicely for her paper back. She turned around and the <br>
paper was laying in the middle of her bed.<br>
&gt;From a former resident of Smith Hall, this ghost is very friendly. She isn't <br>
out to scare people, mostly she just likes to play around and help you when <br>
she can<br>

Odd Things<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
<br>
I have enjoyed reading your website for months now and through reading
your stories I realized that I was never imagining and that the house I
had lived in when I was a teenager in fact had some kind of
presence.&nbsp; From the time I was 13 until I was 18, my family and I
lived in San Antonio in a nice neighborhood that was perhaps 20 years
old at the most.&nbsp; From the moment we first entered the house prior
to buying it, I never felt comfortable in it.&nbsp; The house itself
was unusually warm&#8230;except for my room which was always extremely
cold.&nbsp; No matter what season of the year it was, upon entering my
room, there was just an extreme cold&#8230;like it was constantly 40 degrees
in there(my room was in the middle of the other bedrooms, right next to
the thermostat and the water heater so I found it rather odd to be so
cold).&nbsp; I had to keep a space heater in my room all year round for
it to stay warm and even then some parts of it would remain cold.&nbsp;
My parents don&#8217;t remember much of anything happening but my brother,
friends, and I remember odd things happening.&nbsp; A friend of mine,
who has lived in haunted houses and can sense things, confirmed that
she too always felt as if someone or something was watching you
throughout the house.&nbsp; I always would have to light every room I
walked through to get to where I needed to go because I was so
scared.&nbsp; Little things would happen like the volume on the stereo
going up by itself in our living room and when we would light candles,
one would flicker like crazy and then stop, but then the other would do
the same, back and forth.&nbsp; Once I was in the living room by myself
when the backdoor burst opened after I had just watched a segment from
Unsolved Mysteries, of course I ran upstairs into my parent&#8217;s room like
a kid and refused to go back down by myself.&nbsp; Sometimes from
upstairs I would think I would hear someone doing something in the
kitchen downstairs when I knew nobody else was home.&nbsp; One day I
came home from school to find my mom&#8217;s car gone-- meaning nobody was
home because my dad worked and my brother was in school, but when I
entered it felt as if somebody was there.&nbsp; So I searched
throughout the house starting upstairs and working down.&nbsp; I went
into every room and made sure all the doors(closets, bathrooms,
bedrooms) were completely shut(I made sure I heard each door click) and
then I went downstairs to do the same thing.&nbsp; After I made my
round I was walking upstairs and distinctly heard a door shut!&nbsp; I
flipped out.&nbsp; So I went back downstairs towards my living room(the
same room with the stereo knob that goes up by itself) and I heard a
low murmuring conversation between 2 men right by that stereo.&nbsp;
So, I was going to check to see if my neighbor was outside in his
backyard when my mom came home and the voices just stopped.&nbsp; So I
told my mom what happened and she, being a devout Christian, said that
I was probably imagining things&#8230;.Yeah right!&nbsp; Other encounters
include both my brother and I waking up paralyzed.&nbsp; The first time
it happened was in my bedroom while I was awake, my bedroom by the way,
is right above the living room with the stereo and the voices(and it&#8217;s
the coldest room in the house).&nbsp; I was lying on the bed reading
when all of the sudden I felt a heavy weight plop itself down over my
entire body and I couldn&#8217;t move anything.&nbsp; I started to feel the
weight move on me and I prayed for it to go away and it did a little
bit later.&nbsp; At that point, I thought my imagination was getting
the better of me but then, this one particular afternoon really
frightened me.&nbsp; I was watching TV in my parent&#8217;s room and fell
asleep on my stomach.&nbsp; I awoke and opened my eyes around 5pm and I
saw a shadow quickly move to my right out of my view.&nbsp; Now, I
thought it was my mother going to the closets that were right behind
me, out of my view, but after waiting awhile she hadn&#8217;t come out.&nbsp;
I tried calling her name but nothing would come out, not even a
whisper.&nbsp; I tried to move my head to see her but I couldn&#8217;t move,
then I started to panic because I knew nobody was there but I felt
somebody watching me from the other side, I think where my parent&#8217;s
bedroom window was.&nbsp; I remembered thinking that I needed to close
my eyes and will it away and a few minutes later I was free.&nbsp; I
went downstairs to ask my mom if she had been up there and of course
she said no so then I really knew something was wrong.&nbsp; I&#8217;m slowly
remembering little things that I tried to pass off as my imagination as
I hated thinking that there was something else in the house besides my
family, but I do remember hearing taps on my parents window which was
on the second floor overlooking our driveway.&nbsp; I remember hearing
this because I would look outside the window to see if somebody was
throwing pebbles at it and nobody would be there.&nbsp; Also, my
brother and I both remember finding random dead birds in our backyard
from time to time which I don&#8217;t think was a good sign&#8230;gives me the
creeps.&nbsp; <br>

As An Adult<br>
<br>
By: nchrck@direcway.com<br>
<br>
I have one other story from when I was a teenager but this one happened
as an adult. I lived in Murfreesboro Tennessee with my husband and two
kids. We found out that the house we lived in was around 50 yrs old at
the time. The attic was changed into a bedroom, we put our son in that
room. The stairs to his room came down into our bedroom, it had two
doors. One leading into the living room and one leading into the
hallway. It was a small hall with the bathroom to the right, our
daughters room across from it and to the left the hall continued with a
doorway into the kitchen with linoleum floors.(This is improtant to
know). It was a big kitchen with a door that lead to the small
backporch. Okay, when we moved in, we would hear voices. Couldn't make
out words, just like a conversation in the distance. I would always
look outside because 2 blocks away was a bad neighborhood. No one would
ever be there. I would hear footsteps upstairs when no one but me was
home, so I knew it wasn't my son. I took a nap with my daughter(1 1/2
at the time) on our bed, I left the tv on and when I woke up it was
off. I called my husband at work to see if he had come home for lunch
and he said he hadn't. Then one night everyone but me was in bed and I
finally decided to turn in. Our bed was right next to the door to the
hall. The door was closed. As I was moving a laundry basket so I could
get into bed, I was thinking that I should open the door so I could
hear her if she got up. As I was thinking it something hard hit the
door. I about jumped out of my skin. I jumped in bed and laid there
until I went to sleep. A couple of hours later, my husband got up to
pee, and I wathced him open the door and was waiting to hear him trip
over something. He never did. I asked him if anything was in the hall
and he said no. A while after that , again everyone was asleep but me.
I had just climbed into bed, the door open this time. As I laid there I
heard someone run from teh backporch door, across the linoleum and
across the carpet. At which point I slammed the door shut without
getting out of bed. I actually heard the footfalls on the linoleum and
carpet. I was really freaked out by that. I felt like I would have been
hurt if I wouldn't have shut the door. The next morning, I had my
husband&nbsp; check the back door and it was still locked, from inside,
and didn't look like anyone had broke in. I would love to go back and
investigate but it probably won't happen. That's my scary story. The
other one isn't scary, just a little freaky, but nice. When dead
friends still hang around their old house and watch over their family
and friends, it's pretty neat!<br>

My Sisters Friend<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
<br>
Hi. i'm the eldest child in my family. I'm 16, i've got a little
brother whos 7 and a sister called Millie whos 4.&nbsp; There has
always been something strange about Millie - i dont think shes ever
really got on well with me! <br>
One night my parents took my brother into hospital so i was left to
take care of millie it was 9pm and i heard noises coming from upstairs.
I rushed up the stairs and i heard millie talking to herself. I stopped
and listened for a while. she was saying&nbsp; "Are you my freind? why
wont you play with me anymore? you're being mean!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
I peered my hed around the door. Millie threw her favourite pink bunny
and shouted "go away"&nbsp; Suddenly she started to scream. i ran in
the room and shook her and she just lay back down to sleep i watched
her for 10mins then i went downstairs to watch tv.&nbsp; About an hour
later the radio turned on full blast i ran over to turn it off.&nbsp;
before i turned it off a weird voice came on saying "Millie...millie go
check on the darling" I turned the radio off and ran as fast as i could
upstairs my heart was racing and i was sweating i was so scared.&nbsp; <br>
I looked about her room...the window was open i ran to it and looked
out. (There is a type of&nbsp; big ledge outside millie's window.) she
was pearing over the edge i shouted her name she turned to look at me
and she screamed and pointed to behind me i looked - there wasn't
anything there. i climbed out the window and joined her on the ledge.<br>
she started to panick and slipped i caught her but she was hanging off
the edge like they do in films! She was screaming and was shouting
"Elle HELP HELP!"&nbsp; I managed to pull her to safety. <br>
i took her downstairs and got her some of her favourite chocolate and some juice. I asked her what was wrong and who is elle. <br>
she said "my friend but nobody else can see her - i made her up!"<br>
I said "why did you scream and point"<br>
She went quiet and nervously said "the bad guy, he stopped me from playing with elle he frightens me"<br>
I took her upstairs and made her sleep in my room.<br>
That night i had a really creepy dream about millie and elle and the
bad guy! I dreamt the whole of what had happened earlier on that night
but this time i could see the "made up" people!<br>
I never know if the people millie were talking about were actually real or just made up!?<br>

First Experience with a Friend<br>
<br>
By: Love4TaeKwonDo@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
hello my name is Kristyn and i'm 17 years old from Algonquin, Illinois.
There is this one church (St. John's Lutheran) and one youth house next
to it that was bulit in the late 1800's... and I had some very scary
incidents occur at each. first the youth house incident...<br>
this house is very old and very creepy and it is used for youth group.
It was around 10:30 p.m. when my first incident at the house occured. I
told my friend Jessica I wasn't feeling right there at all like there
was somebody walking around. The bathroom was to me a threat like
everytime I went in there I felt like I was being threatened and like
someone was tapping me on the shoulder saying don't look in the
bathroom mirror or else. so for my health I didn't... okay.. first real
Incident 10:30 p.m.- Theres this one old door but its not a heavy old
door like some are... something was telling me to close it.. it was
like its kinda hard to explain it wasn't wide open.. it has one of
those old, old sliding door locks so it was still attached to the lock
but it was open but not all the way. in the kitchen I was feeling very
cold and my friend felt find she was relaxed while me i felt
endangered. So i went up to the door and tried closing it and it
wouldn't budge it felt like there was a force or something behind it
and before I tried closing it there was like claw scratches and
footsteps coming from behind that door cuz theres stairs behind the
door. So i was struggling with it. I let go off it and my friend was in
aww and asked wuts going on? and I said were not welcomed here.. the
door instantly slammed shut on its own. i'm like just calm down maybe
its just me? but it wasn't we weren't alone. heres the second part
after that we sat on the couch in the living room area and there sits a
brand new t.v. and we were just talking ya know girl talk and before we
know it we hear a click from somewhere and my friend is looking around
and my head turns just in time to see the t.v. button go in and turn
on.. all my friend saw was the t.v. go on. not the button but i later
told her. I then told her to get the hell out of the house cuz hell I
knew we were not welcomed at all there not one bit. She ran out of
there following me and I knew my feelings of coldness there and sensing
things there were right. Jessica has told me before about that house
when shes been there in the past. shes heard moaning, clawing,
clicking, voices.. and feeling not alone. where the whole youth group
was at the time was in the church's school's gym.. we just stayed up
there to talk but I didn't wanna be up there cuz I knew we weren't
welcome. Moving on to my Jesus spirit incident that happened yesterday
1/22/05...<br>
This Jesus spirit incident was my favorite incident out of all. The
first time i felt at peace and not scared or threatened like with my
other incidents. Alright heres the story.. Jessica and I were both in
the church's kitchen sitting on the counter talking. I was talking to
her about The Passion Of The Christ and I was really getting into major
Details. I was about to explain to her about the scene about him going
up onto the cross and before both of us knew it are heads like turned
towards were there sink is located and was a flash and in figure was a
man with a white robe like in passion what jesus is wearing and was
turned to the side had long brown hair and the face was a blur. it was
for like a second but enough to get a full view of it and I knew i saw
it and I looked over at jessica and her eyes were like amazed and in
shock. At first I didn't say anything and then I said you saw it didn't
u? and she said yes! and she described the same thing that I saw. Our
hearts were both saying Jesus and we both didn't feel in fear we felt
being loved! At first yes we ran like 2 bats out of hell when it
happened. But then we just felt in love. We told Lori and Rachel who is
Jessica's sister who is the youth leader. They both believed us and we
both wondered why The face was a blur and we read it in the bible to
find the answer and it said something on this line " He who sees my
face shall not live". Something like that. That totally explained why
we didn't see his face so it must of been him! and with me and
believing god.. I do but i always and everyday doubted him cuz I
thought he hated me and constantly ignored me and I would say if god
loved me he'd show me. I felt so in love after that incident and I
cried. I can tell you something Jessica has believed me before on me
seeing these things but now after she experienced it with me shes just
moved at wut I see and i'm glad she saw something good with me compared
to seeing the ghost behind that door or the ghost with the t.v. I was
moved by this and will always will be. This is one of my many haunting
experiences.. but this is my first experience with a friend seeing a
peaceful spirit.<br>

Kept My Experiences Quiet<br>
<br>
By: marcilkids@wanadoo.nl<br>
<br>
First of all, I'd like to say that your site has taught me a great
deal. For a long time I have kept my experience to myself and to the
people I did tell, I put it of as if it were a dream, although I know
that it couldn't have been.<br>
I'm now 23 years old, and I live in a relatively small town in The
Netherlands. When I was about fifteen years old, I went to stay with my
aunt and uncle in an even smaller town. At the time, they lived in a
house in the woods, really beautiful. It wasn't a big house, like many
houses in America are, but it was very nice. I stayed their many times,
just because I enjoyed the peaceful surroundings. Once at night, in the
summer, I lay in bed, reading a book or something, I don't really
remember. What I do remember very vividly, is that all of a sudden, I
heard music, laughter and voices coming from, what I presumed,
downstairs. I remember being scared, because it really came out of
nowhere; it was silent just before. I thought it might be my aunt and
uncle's tv, but they were sound asleep (I had trouble falling asleep in
a strange bed back then, so it took me quite some time to fall asleep).
It couln't have been neighbours, because there weren't any! I decided
to go downstairs, but as I went down the stairs, the music just died
off. I could hear it getting less and less loud, until it was gone. I
didn't see anything. But when I was back in my room, I heard it again.
I woke up my uncle, but ofcourse the sounds were gone when he listened.
The week I was there, I heard the sounds every night, but as soon as my
aunt or uncle came, it was gone. <br>
I didn't have an opportunity back then to tape what I heard, since I
didn't have a taperecorder there. In the autumn, I went for the last
time, but never heard it again. I never saw anything else out of the
ordinary either. My aunt and uncle did move out quite suddenly about
seven months later, but they claimed to be tired of the silence there.
They also don't remember me waking them up so often back then. Or don't
they want to remember? I don't know. What I do know is that I was
definitely awake; I couldn't have had the same dream five times in a
row? As far as I know, there isn't any known "ghost history" about that
house, but I haven't really looked in to it.<br>
The years after, I really didn't have any special experiences, although
I do often see "people" walking through our living room in the corner
of my eye, but when I look closely, I don't see a thing. I do have one
picture with an orb on it, but that's all. What I wonder about is why I
only heard those sounds that week and never again!?<br>

Ghost Lamp<br>
<br>
By: aphroditie23@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I have submitted stories before with things that have happened to me.
This story, however, is a favorite of my dad's. It's amusing, and I'd
like to share it with you all.<br>
My father worked Summer Stock (theatre) down in the Carolinas during
the summers he was in college in the early 70's. The small thearte they
worked in was supposedly haunted. None of them really believed, but
they still couldn't explain why things disappeared and reappeared all
the time. Nothing really big happened till one night they all left the
theatre late, well after dark. As they left, the head stage manager
remembered he forgot to light the Ghost Lamp. A Ghost Lamp is a single
bulb that all theatres leave burining center stage when the house is
dark. Firstly, it provides low cost visibility for those coming and
going after hours. Secondly, it's tradition and considered good luck to
always have the stage lit. Those who work in theatre know it's not a
good idea to break traditions, being the supersticious lot we are. So,
the manager goes back into the theatre alone leaving my dad and the
rest of the group outside. A few minutes pass, and they wonder what's
taking so long. Not a second later, the manager comes tearing out the
the theatre screaming. It took several oments to get him to calm enough
to tell what happened. He said he entered the theatre and saw that the
stage was lit with and errie glow. Now, there is an effect that will
produce what he saw. It is done by filling a wide shallow pan with
water, making it move with a fan, and bouncing a light off the water.
The effect is errie. They happened to be using this special effect
eariler in the day, so he simply thought someone had forgot to shut the
equipment off. Clearly impossible as they would have noticed before
they left the theatre, but it was all he had to go on. Backstage, he
saw the light and fan were off, and the water pan was empty. He walked
back out into the house, and noticed the errie light was gone.
Remembering what he came for, he turned his back on the stage for a
second to fetch the lamp, when he got the distinct feeling he was not
alone. He wheeled back around. The glow was back, and there, center
stage was a girl. Her clothing was a shabby 19ct dress, and she looked
a mess. He couldn't believe his eyes...where had she come from? All the
doors were locked, and my dad and his friends surely would have seen he
enter thru the front. He opend his mouth to say something, and she
looked directly at him. He said he was instantly freezing. She winked
at him, and evaporated on the spot, plunging him into darkness. He
didn't hang around. He never worked past dusk after that, and those who
saw the terror on his face ALWAYS made sure the Ghost Lamp was lit when
the house was dark.<br>
If you haven't got LOVE, then you haven't got anything at all. :)<br>

Events that Took Place<br>
<br>
By: goodfaithmortgage@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
Hello my name is Tiffany I am 21 years old and had an experience quit a
few times the first experience I had was when I was around 13 years old
I was asleep in my room and we slept with the window opened because our
room would get so hot. Well I had woke up to go to the restroom I had
got a cup of water and returned back to bed I was laying there trying
to fall asleep when I heard a noise I lifted my head and there was
nothing there so once again tried to go back to bed right when I was
about to fall asleep I felt something go on my bed like if someone sat
down. I lifted my head and again nothing. So I prayed because I was
scared and my grandma always told if I feel scared to pray and that
feeling would go away. But it didn&#8217;t go away I felt something touch my
feet so I pulled my feet up and once again I felt the feeling again so
I turned around pretending I was asleep thinking it was someone who got
in through the window I felt if I acted if I was asleep then he would
leave me alone because I didn&#8217;t see his face. But I was wrong this
thing kept touching my feet and finally I came to the conclusion that
it was not a human I don&#8217;t know what it was but the blanket was over my
whole body so the mystery remains what was touching my feet?<br>
I had another experience at my aunts house her house definitely had
some kind of spirits not just one but a few. I would always spend the
night me and my best cousin of course were close and loved to tell
scary stories since our family always told us stories that happened to
them when they where small believe me they have some scary things that
happened to them but back to my story so me and my cuz where getting
ready for bed we where sleeping in the living room on a couch that
turned into a bed I heard a noise coming from the kitchen so my cousin
said to look because she was scared you got to understand that the
couch-bed was directly lined up with the door way and the entrance into
the kitchen so I got up and was leaning over the couch it was dark so I
had to stare for a lil. Bit until my eyes adjusted to the darkness when
they did I seen a manly figure standing by my cousins room so I
told&nbsp; Sophia there someone standing by your brothers room she said
I was pry seeing things so I said no I&#8217;m not let me look again so I did
and it was still there I couldn&#8217;t see any facial features but just like
a shadow with a derby hat he then pulled his head back hiding behind
the wall and then showed his head&nbsp; once again I knew what I was
seeing and was so frightened I started to cry my cousin reassured me
that nothing was going to happen and I made her turn the living room
lights on and tried my best to fall asleep. I told my aunt the next day
and she said oh I always see that man.<br>
There was another time at my aunts house that me and my cousin Gina
where in the kitchen and she loved to eat ice I went into the den and
she was in the kitchen part eating some ice I felt some cold fingers
run across my back and I said hey don&#8217;t do that its cold and then my
cousin comes out of the restroom by that time I got my hands cold to do
the same thing to Gina thinking she did it but she said what are you
doing I told her and she said that wasn&#8217;t me I was in the restroom and
now that I think of it the fingers where going right and my cousin was
going left and was in the restroom. We both got freaked out and walked
to my grandmas house who lived up the street.<br>
When I was living at my boyfriend&#8217;s house our room would always get
cold we would sleep with 3 blankets and the door would be opened
because the heat from the wall heater would come in and make a lil.
Warm. Now my boyfriends mom didn&#8217;t like me because of some stupid
reason she would always tell me she&#8217;s going to put a curse on me so I
would not love her son anymore but anyways the reason I&#8217;m telling you
this is because I think she had something to do with this happening so
about the story me and my boyfriend where asleep and the door was
opened we slept hugging all the time. Now I&#8217;m a&nbsp; prayer since my
grandma told us no ghost or spirits can do anything to us if we believe
in God so I prayed that night before going to sleep and in the middle
of the night I heard 2 women&#8217;s voices and one mans voice they kept
calling my name &#8220;Tiffany&#8221; so I pinched my boyfriends side hoping he
would wake up and he didn&#8217;t so I stood up real quick and nothing was
there so I went back to bed hugging my boyfriend and yes I prayed. It
was hard for me to fall back asleep I was jus thinking what was that
who was that and heard my name for&nbsp; the second time but this time
the voices where so close they where coming from the door way but for
some reason wouldn&#8217;t come in the room they kept saying &#8220; oh, look at
her isn&#8217;t she pretty oh look at them sleep&#8221; and they would start to
laugh I remember it like if it was last night. I continued to pinch my
boyfriends side hoping and praying they would go away finally I got my
boyfriend up and the voices stopped he asked me why I was pinching him
and I told him he asked if I seen who it was I said NO I was too scared
and plus my head was under the blankets. After that I woke my boyfriend
up to go with me to the restroom every time I had to go and slept with
the door shut and locked.<br>
Another thing happened to me in that house it was when my boyfriend
would go to work at 5 am and I would wake up and get his cloths ready
and make breakfast for him. Well this one morning he woke me up and we
where going through the same routine he left and I couldn&#8217;t go back to
sleep so I put the T.V. on. I was lying in bed with the covers over my
head and my hair hanging off the bed just listening to the television
trying to go to bed I heard a mans voice call my name I just ignored it
and then the most scariest thing happened I felt hands running their
fingers through my hair. I opened my eyes still under the blanket and
pinched myself thinking I was asleep but nope I sure was awake. I
continued to feel the fingers in my hair and the voice saying &#8220;Tiffany&#8221;
at that point I was terrified and said to myself just pray and jump up
what ever it is it will go away so as scared as I was I did jump up and
nothing was there. So I prayed got up took a shower and went to my moms
house.<br>
There are more things that happened but they weren&#8217;t as intense as the events above. Thank you for your time.<br>

Can't Stand the Room<br>
<br>
By: brandymycandy@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
Hey i just recently found your website and decided to share my experience...<br>
My mom recently moved into this house that was built in the 1950's. I
came to visit her for a weekend because i dont live with her, and i
stayed in the guest bedroom, AKA my bedroom. Anyways, i had just gotten
off the phone, and blew out the candle and i started hearing noises
right next to the bed. so i got up, turned on the light, looked around
and didnt see anything. I opened my door and my brother was on the
computer so i just shut the door, the light off and got back into bed.
Not less than a minute later i heard the same noise, and did the same
routine, turning on the light and looking around. I was so annoyed and
just wanted to go to bed. Finally i thought it might just be a mouse or
something, and so when the noise came again i grabbed a book off the
headboard (theres a lot of books there) and started throwing them at
the air.&nbsp; After about the third book i felt something grab at my
wrist, i froze and dropped the book. I started screaming for my mom,
and i didnt get a reply, so i screamed for my brother to come help me.
He rushed in and turned on the light, i was crying and there was a
handprint on my wrist. He saw the books scattered on the floor and i
ran out of the room. I told my mom what had happ ed and she said there
were no such things as ghosts. I refused to sleep in that room again,
and slept on the couch for the rest of the weekend. And after i moved
in with my mom this past summer, i decided i'd take over my brothers
room, because i cant stand to go in the other one.<br>

Now my name is Laura and I have lived in Cincinnati my entire

of Buffalo Ridge. One night when i got my license a few friends and i
decided to try one of them out it was the legend of the glowing pond.
It is said that if you go down to Buffalo Ridge on Halloween night at
midnight the pond will glow green and then a white van will pull up
next to you and try to run you off the road. (which the road is very
narrow and hardly big enough for two cars anyways.) So my friends and i
who are really not to big of believers did this and let me tell you it
really works. We were scared out of our minds. The next night we
decided to try another one out which again worked. If you go down to
the gate which is closed off to the public (no one knows what is back
there) and turn off your car and flash your lights three times four
ghosts will appear, a mother and father and two children that come up
to opposite sides of your car. I kid you not it worked. So if your ever
looking for a scary thing to do come to Cincinnati and witness the
tales of Buffalo Ridge you just get an eerie feeling passing the
street.&nbsp; There is a castle and an old crematoriom and a haunted
house at the end of the last hill with a sign that says we will return
at this time....... but yet there is nothing in it and no one has lived
in that house for god knows who long.. It is definitly creepy....<br>

Father and Son and Others<br>
<br>

Here is a story of my grandfather that I think you might find interesting.<br>
The Bond Between Father and Son<br>
Even since I was little I've believed in ghosts and the supernatural.&nbsp; It all began when I saw my first ghost.<br>
When I was 4 1/2 my little brother was born and because my sick
grandfather (my dad's father) wasn't expected to live to see another
year, a few months later we flew to Florida so he could see his new
grandson before he ran out of time.&nbsp; Well, either he was waiting
to see my brother before he left or we just had REALLY good time
because we had only been there for two days before my grandfather died
peacefully in the night, lovingly stroking my grandmother's hair.&nbsp;
I, at the time, was too young to understand what the full meaning of
death was.&nbsp; All I knew was that my twenty-something cousins and
many aunts and uncles would be driving and flying to Florida as well to
go to the funeral and spend Easter with us.<br>
A few months later...<br>
Okay, first some background information.&nbsp; As a small child I slept
with my parents because something that was in our house frightened me
enough that I couldn't stand the thought of being alone with whatever I
was sensing.&nbsp; Further, I slept up against the wall the bed was
pushed against and made my parents sleep on the side that was open to
the room so nothing could get me.&nbsp; It went me, my mom, then my dad
on the outside "to defend us".&nbsp; That's how we always slept and
this night was no exception.<br>
I don't remember what woke me.&nbsp; I just remember it being the
middle of the night and suddenly my eyes popped open.&nbsp; Feeling a
strange sensation coming from the far side of the bed, I sat up, wide
awake, and looked over to see a tall, male figure leaning over my
father, stroking his face.&nbsp; Immediately I knew he wasn't
living.&nbsp; I could see my parent's dresser through him and he was
letting off a faint blue glow that, had it not been on a ghost, would
have been soothing.&nbsp; As I was opening my mouth to scream for my
parents to wake up, suddenly the figure looked at me and my mouth shut
in recognition.&nbsp; It was my grandfather.&nbsp; He didn't say
anything, just looked at me and softly presses his index finger to his
lips, and I knew he hadn't meant for me to see him and to be scared,
that he had just stopped by to say good-bye to his son.&nbsp; Nodding
my head I laid back down but kept my eyes locked on my
grandfather.&nbsp; He stooped down one last time to caress my father
then slowing disappeared.&nbsp; Soon after he left I went back to sleep
with one last thought in my head that I knew was from my
grandfather:&nbsp; Not to tell my parents what I saw.<br>
For years I kept my promise to my grandfather but continued to wonder
in my head:&nbsp; Why had he come to see my dad?&nbsp; From what I
knew, he hadn't visited any of his other 6 children and, knowing my
family, they would have mentioned something as meaningful as that.<br>
Over time I saw weird reactions from my dad when it came to the topic
of his father.&nbsp; I once saw him sobbing in my mother's arms and
when I, being a curious little 6-year-old, asked my mom what was wrong
with him got the answer:&nbsp; "He just misses his daddy."&nbsp; My
father also liked to tell me stories about my grandfather but, I
noticed, none of them ever involved him.&nbsp; They were always about
my grandfather and his other sons.<br>
As I got older I got more curious about the grandfather who I had
barely known and began grilling my mother about him and my dad.&nbsp;
What I found out was not was what I was expecting to hear.&nbsp; I
guess when my father was young he was... well, he wasn't like my
grandfather.&nbsp; My grandfather was the classic Catholic man of the
time.&nbsp; He was completely straightedge, was "the man of the house",
expected complete obedience from his kids, was a model citizen, had
served for his country... you get the picture.&nbsp; Anyway, my father
wasn't these things.&nbsp; He wasn't a bad person, mind you, he just
wasn't his father.&nbsp; He had a wild side that came out.&nbsp; So all
through my grandfather's life my father was disapproved of by the man
he most wanted to impress.&nbsp; Even to his dying day my grandfather
hadn't warmed to my father and my father was still deeply hurt from the
years of disapproval.<br>
At first this story confused me.&nbsp; The ghost I had seen, that was
beyond doubt my grandfather, showed nothing but a quiet love for my
father.&nbsp; He had looked sad... but then again, would you be happy
if you were leaving your wife and large family behind?&nbsp; Then I
thought about it longer.&nbsp; I now think that my grandfather had come
to my father to give himself some peace- to show the son he had always
misjudged that he did care for him.<br>
Finally, after years of keeping my story to myself, I decided that it
was time my father knew what only I had witnessed.&nbsp; First I told
my mom because I was scared they would think I was crazy, but then that
night she called me out into the kitchen with my father and told me:
"Tell him what you told me earlier."&nbsp; Quietly, while looking down
at the floor I told him everything and when I was done I looked up at
him and... and he had tears in his eyes.&nbsp; He whispered "Thank you"
and then hugged me tightly.&nbsp; I noticed a change in my father after
that.&nbsp; He no longer seems bitter when it comes to my grandfather
and I haven't seen my grandfather's ghost again.&nbsp; I think the two
of them were finally able to move on.<br>

History Buff<br>
<br>
By: mailand5@nvbell.net<br>
<br>
I am a senior in high school and an amateur ghost hunter, who gets a
lot of skepticism and disbelief from most people.&nbsp; I'm very glad I
found your page, because I have a very interesting story - something
that happened to me in the Franklin Roosevelt Manor during a visit back
east.<br>
My entire family had traveled to the east coast (we live out west) to
check out some prospective colleges for my sisters and I.&nbsp; Being a
fan of American history, I insisted we visit as many historical places
as we could.&nbsp; One of the colleges I was looking at was only about
30 minutes from FDR's house, so we decided to go pay a visit to the
Roosevelt Mansion.<br>
Inside the entrance hall, I wandered away from the tour guide to have
my own look at things.&nbsp; The day was cloudy, so the house was
rather dark and cold.&nbsp; I approached a hallway that ran parallel to
a staircase and had been blocked off by a waist-high plastic gate to
prevent anyone from entering.&nbsp; A few old photographs and what
looked like a door chime with two wooden pendulums hung on the wall.<br>
As I peered down the hallway, wondering to myself "gee, wouldn't it be
cool if this place was haunted - " one of the pendulums hanging from
the doorchime lifted into the air, as if pulled by an invisible hand,
then was dropped back down, where it remained swinging for a little
while.&nbsp; I got a sufficient shock, and was just trying to compose
myself when a soft gust of very cold air swept over me.<br>
I'm certain the gust of air wasn't what moved the pendulum, and I
checked afterwards to see if there were any vents in the floor that
could have jostled it, or if it perhaps was attached to a motor.&nbsp;
My search yielded nothing, and I was too elated over what had just
happened to ask the tourguide if any visitors had reported strange
happenings.<br>
I'm very glad I was able to share this story with you!&nbsp; Thank you for your time.<br>

Overwhelming Power<br>
<br>

It was about 3 maybe 4 years ago when me and my friend tommy started
seeing dark tall shadowy figures in both of our houses. Just like
turning around and seeing it standing in a corner or getting a feeling
like he's there just watching but not doing anything. or hearing our
names being called out but they were verry faint like maybe 20 hertz
mine sounded like a little girl and so did his. But back to the story
well we were in 5th grade and around 6th grade before he moved to
nevada the sightings got less and less frequent until we barely saw it
again. But we both thought of a guy when he was around just this
overwelming feeling of hidden power so we thought that maybe it was
death but i don't know. So if you've had an expeireance like this
please tell me I need to know.<br>

My Grandma<br>
<br>
By: Rapture102161@aol.com<br>

My grandma was a wonderful lady; the perfect grandma. She died June 10,
1995 at the age of 85 of leukemia. I did not want to go to her funeral
and see her that way so I stayed home in Pa. I had been having alot of
anxiety attacks and nothing seemed to relieve them.<br>
One night I had a dream that I was walking down a long hall and a voice
told me' " Remember, you can't stay". A door opened and there stood my
grandma. We did not speak but hugged one another. I can still feel how
soft her skin was. I woke up and from that day forth I have never had
another attack. But the story doesn't end there.<br>
I had an enlarged lymph node in my neck and it interfered with
swallowing and it affected my voice sometime. I was scared it could be
cancer. After all it is one of the symptoms of leukemia. I had a dream
about her again 10 years later. But this time we passed each other on
the sidewalk and she just smiled at me. My daughter told me that she
thinks she came to me to tell me I was gonna be ok . I had it removed
in January 05 and it was benign.<br>

Jacksonville Cemetery:<br>
<br>

<br>
About 18 years ago I was in the Jacksonville Cemetery with my husband &amp; 3 year old son.<br>
We were reading headstones.&nbsp; I believe it was in June or July. The
sun was out &amp; there was not a cloud in the sky.&nbsp;&nbsp; As we
were walking through the headstones we saw a woman walking through the
trees.&nbsp; Both my husband &amp; I saw her.&nbsp; We thought there
was something odd about her but, couldn't figure out exactly
what.&nbsp; We were walking toward her &amp; she was probably
about&nbsp; 80 yards away.&nbsp; She was walking away from us &amp;
stepped behind a tree.&nbsp; Then we didn't see her again.&nbsp; I said
to my husband, "Where did that woman go?"&nbsp; He said, "She stepped
behind the tree."&nbsp; We continued to walk toward the spot where we
saw her.&nbsp; All of the sudden rain poured down on our heads.&nbsp;
We both looked up into the blue sky &amp; water continued to drench
us.&nbsp; We ran back toward the car &amp; it was like the rain just
disapeared.&nbsp; We got back to our car &amp; we were all soaking
wet.&nbsp; The sky was still blue.&nbsp; We left right away.<br>

Grandma's House<br>
By: Vlilangel190@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
My grandma has a house next to a cementary in a little town. I never
thought that&nbsp; the saying "never step on a gravestone" was true. So
one day i went to go visit my grandma and she thought it would be nice
to have a walkway so we decided to use some grave stones that they have
put in my grandma's backyard as a walkway.that same night i was up to
get something to drink and i thought i saw a little boy run to the
other side of the counter so i went to chase after it&nbsp;&nbsp;
thinking it was my little cousin and&nbsp; there was noone there.i just
ignored what had happened but that same night my grandma, my aunt ,my
mom and i All had the same dream wich was two little boys asking for
their gravestone as well as a lady that looked like she was in her late
fiftys..we all got kinda freaked out and that night i heard voices of
little bboys playing after I went for a walk to the cemetery to prove I
wasn't scared and on my way back I saw a glare pass right next to me.
While I was running to the steps I was reading the gravestones and took
a picture of it with my cell phone when I went inside I had noticed
that their were two little boys that had died at an early age I showed
my grandma and she wasn't very shocked. I was begging her to return the
stones where she found them but she refused not to.she said"I think
they look beautiful as a walkway,and i am not scared of no ghosts they
cant harm people so i don't know why you get so scared"I left early in
the morning and was to scared to walk to walk on the walkway. this is a
true story and i hope that my grandma has taken them off. I will go
visit again and will tell you all about my experience.<br>

Spirit Attachment<br>
<br>
By: daemented@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My name is Seth, I'm twenty years old, and I live in East Tennessee. I
was raised in a Christian home, but when I turned nineteen, I began to
study modern day Odinism. Around that same time I started working at
West Knox News (an adult book store) in early September 2004. I worked
what they call first shift, midnight to eight a.m. It was an easy job,
basically sitting behind a counter using the cash register. One of my
co-workers had a movie rental account there, and as I was working with
him one night, I decided to rent a flick. I drove home as I always did,
and when I arrived, I threw the movie down and went to sleep. I was
only asleep for an hour or two when I found myself awake, staring down
at my own body. I've never practiced astral projection, but here I was,
hovering above myself. It seemed like I would jerk, and then I would be
back in my own body, staring up at the ceiling. Needless to say, I
freaked and tried to move, but I couldn't, I was completely paralyzed.
I remembered what I had read about it, and tried to move my pinky, and
finally I did, and I sat up sharply, trying to catch my breath. I began
to get tired again, and I laid back down, only to have the same thing
happen again. This went on the entire morning, every one to two hours,
until finally it stopped. When I awoke that evening, I didn't think
anything of it, until I went to sleep the next morning, my day off, and
the ame thing happened.&nbsp; Let me go off topic here for one second
to explain a few things. Most of what I know about the spiritual realm
I learned from my father. Their home in Gary, Indiana was haunted for
years. They would hear a marble rolling down the hallway and then turn
sharply and bounce down the stairs, among other things. He and my other
relatives on that side of the family attended a spiritualist church for
years, and as he grew older he also dabbled in conjuring up spirits,
and after his own bad experiences, became a Christian.&nbsp; But
anyway, before I had even said anything about it, he looked at me and
told me that he had awoke out of a sound sleep and looked out in the
hallway to see a robed figure standing at the edge of the doorway
leading to my room, staring in at me. I told him that I had rented a
movie from work, and he said that it might have something attached to
it, so without much hesitation I took the movie and put it in my car,
where it would sit until I returned to work. On my last day off, I was
a little tired and went to sleep around midnight. Again, every couple
hours I would wake up first staring down at my body, then I after a
jerk I would be looking up at the ceiling completely paralyzed until I
used the same pinky trick. However, at four in the morning I awoke
again to see a black cloud hovering right above my head, and I saw the
outline of a figure kneeling on my legs, pinning me down. The pinky
trick failed to work, and after much struggling, I managed a moan and a
slight scream. My parents came in, and both the figure and the cloud
disappeared. After a long discussion, my parents and I returned to my
room, which was freezing, despite the rest of the house being around
seventy four degrees. My father put up the same cross his father put up
in their home to ward off the evil spirits, and after prayer, he used
annointing oil around my room and above the doorway. Instantly the room
warmed back up, and the fig e or cloud never came back, and I've slept
soundly ever since<br>

Home in Pittsburgh<br>
<br>
By: chuck420@highvision.net<br>
<br>
Back in the late 1970's I lived in a house in Pittsburgh, <br>
in the Oakland section of the city.&nbsp; We researched the house &amp; discovered it <br>
was built in the mid 1850's and was originally owned by a river-boat <br>
captain.&nbsp; The house sits on top of the bluff overlooking the Mon-River and <br>
supposedly the captain had stairs that ran down the hill-side to where he <br>
kept several paddle-wheel boats.<br>
The house is a large 3-story wooden structure with a basement which contains <br>
a large water-well which is covered by a large slab of stone (which we never <br>
tried to move or look down in to).&nbsp; Also there were 6 working fire-places in <br>
the house, 3 on the 1st floor and 3 on the 2nd floor.<br>
Upon researching the history of the house we discovered the captain had <br>
killed his wife &amp; two daughters in the house and then had hung himself, also <br>
in the house.<br>
I lived there for a little over a year &amp; the hauntings got to be too much so <br>
I moved out.&nbsp; I'll number them below briefly:<br>
1.&nbsp; We could often hear foot-steps coming from the front room on the 2nd <br>
floor while we'd be seated in the room below.<br>
2.&nbsp; Fires would start in fireplaces we weren't using but kept logs in for <br>
decoration.<br>
3.&nbsp; The hanging light fixture in the kitchen would swing back-n-forth.<br>
4.&nbsp; My bedroom was the only room on the 3rd floor &amp; on the 3rd step going up <br>
that staircase was an extremely cold spot.&nbsp; Either end of the stairs could <br>
be very hot during the summertime, but on that 3rd step you could see your <br>
breath.<br>
5.&nbsp; Every night at mid-night my bed would start to vibrate, sometimes rather <br>
violently (whether I was lying in it or not...)<br>
6.&nbsp; My brother was sleeping on the sofa in the family room one night and saw <br>
the captain standing over him.&nbsp; The captain turned and walked into the <br>
bar-room and vanished.<br>
7.&nbsp; I often saw a black shadow standing at the top of the stairs leading to <br>
my 3rd floor bedroom.<br>
8.&nbsp; We had a large dog which we could never get down into the basement, and <br>
we tried.<br>
9.&nbsp; One winter morning I discovered the water in the toilet froze-solid. <br>
Odd, considering the heat in the house was on and the rooms weren't even <br>
cold.<br>
10.&nbsp; Our stereo would somehow turn on by itsself.<br>
11.&nbsp; An antique clock (which didn't work) started chiming one night, and <br>
chimed over 20 times, which wouldn't be possible since they are designed to <br>
chime no more then 12 times.<br>
12.&nbsp; Many items would turn up missing, only to re-appear in a different spot <br>
a few days later.<br>
13.&nbsp; In the 2nd floor library there were 2 porch-swings suspended from the <br>
ceiling facing each other and as you would pass that room one of the swings <br>
would be swinging back-n-forth when no one else was in the room.<br>
14.&nbsp; The antique pump-organ in the library would sometimes syphen on it's <br>
own (a noise made when it is pumped-up with air-pressure) but no one would <br>
be near it.<br>
15.&nbsp; Many people visiting with us would mention the feeling that they were <br>
being watched.<br>
I'm sure if I sat and really thought about the year or so I lived at this <br>
address many more memories would come flooding back, but it's been a while <br>
since I lived there.&nbsp; <br>
