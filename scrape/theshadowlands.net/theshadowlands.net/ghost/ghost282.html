<P><B>The House in Tustin, Ca.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp; linda@timeclocksales.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; When I was about thirteen years old I moved into a house in
Tustin, California The house was built in 1912; one of those Victoria style
homes.&nbsp; It had a basement even though houses in Southern California
don't usually have them, which I thought was very weird.&nbsp; My room
was above the basement.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; My cousin Dave lived in the house before us, and moved to
Pennsylvania where he eventually died of heart problems at the young age
of 23.&nbsp; When I was about sixteen years old, my best friend was spending
the night.&nbsp; As teenagers we were up very late talking girl-talk.&nbsp;
In the corner of my room I saw a shadow which looked like my cousin Dave.&nbsp;
I asked my best friend if she saw the same thing I saw.&nbsp; She said
did.&nbsp; He had curly brown hair and was in a light blue shirt and dark
blue pants.&nbsp; My cousin was an auto mechanic.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; I didn’t tell anyone in my family until years later.&nbsp;
My brother and I were talking about our cousin Dave and I told him about
seeing him in the corner of my room that night long ago.&nbsp; My brother
said he saw Dave in the corner of his room too.&nbsp; I though it was weird
because my cousin Dave died in Pennsylvania, but I guess he came all the
way to California to see us.&nbsp; I think he had the best times of his
life in that house, and that is why I think he came back. To this day when
I drive by the house in Tustin, Ca. I think about my cousin Dave.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; I also have other ghost experiences.&nbsp; When I was 27 years
old, I was renting a room in a house in Costa Mesa, CA.&nbsp; One night
my roommate had a party and some of the people there were talking about
"the ghost".&nbsp; I asked them, "What ghost you guys are talking about?"
and they said "The room next to yours has a ghost in it."&nbsp; I just
said, "O.K.".</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; A few weeks later I was home alone, cleaning my room.&nbsp;
I went out to the kitchen to go through the door that leads to the garage.&nbsp;
I opened the garage door to take out the trash and was about to close the
garage door, when all of the sudden the garage door opened and closed about
five times all by it's self!&nbsp; I freaked out and went into my room.&nbsp;
When my roommate got home I told him what happened and he said, "I guess
you met the ghost."</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; That night he told that a man killed himself in the room next
to mine back in the early eighty’s.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; One night as I was sleeping in my bed, the bottom of the bed
started shaking.&nbsp; I woke up and went to the end of my bed, but no
one was there.&nbsp; I woke up the next morning and asked my roommate if
his drunk friends were playing games with me.&nbsp; He said that no one
was over last night.&nbsp; Not being sure if I believed him, I asked him
to put a lock on my door.&nbsp; That night the bed shook again..</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; One night I finally got so upset that I yelled at the ghost
to leave me alone.&nbsp; Well, he didn't leave me alone, and he would violently
shake my bed every night after that.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; The next weekend I moved out the house - clear across the
other side of town.&nbsp; I got my own apartment, with no one above me
or below me, or on the sides.&nbsp; I got myself a kitty named Rodney to
keep me company.&nbsp; One night I was sleeping in my bed at the new apartment
and the bed started shaking again! I though to myself that the ghost was
back! Eventually the ghost went away after about a month. To this day I
think about it and wonder if the ghost will come back to me.</B>

<BR><B>Real life experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp; camp0711lc@ACCESS-K12.org</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi Im am a 15 year old babysitter from Ohio. Just recently I was
babysitting 2 girls ages 7 and 8 (Meghan and Demi) and heard a little girl
calling the puppy. She just kept calling out "Here puppy come on puppy"
and the dog (Monolo) started to go crazy barking and growling and he usually
doesnt do that thats how I know I wasnt the only one that heard it. I went
upstairs thinking it was Demi or Meghan but they were both sound asleep.</B>
<BR><B>Then, I just ignored the whole thing and thats when I heard someone
in the kitchen moving things around. I went to bed after that thinking
it was just my imagination. The next morning I made Meghan go take a bath
since she had markers all over her hands, she was only up there for a few
minutes when I heard a loud bang and a scream from Meghan, I ran up there
not knowing what to think and&nbsp; found the attic door open and wood
all over the floor. Meghan told me that someone threw the wood at the door
so it would open, I didnt believe her so later I told her aunt that lives
there also. That is when she told me that her house had ghost and some
old man died up in the attic (I think he killed himself) and does alot
of stuff like that. That night I had to babysit again and called EV to
tell her to come home since I was scared, she asked me if anything happened
yet and I told her not yet as soon as I hung up the phone I put the phone
on my lap and than the phone started turning off and on for about five
min. that is when I decided it was time for bed.</B>

<P><B>Haunted Beach House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp; Gogglespyzon@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>It was about 10yrs ago during the Thanksgiving weekend, My cousin
and I were on Thanksgiving break from college, after we celebrated Thanksgiving
our families decided to take a trip to Atlantic City for the weekend me
and my cousin both being in the same college and taking the same economics
course did not go cause we had a paper due the following Monday so we both
stayed home.</B><B></B>

<P><B>It was around 3 O'clock on Friday afternoon when I got the call from
my cousin to drive out to Northport Long Island.his family had a beach
house there. he told me that the alarm was going off, it was picking up
motion from inside the house. the police had gone and drove by the house
but everything looked good from the outside so my cousin had to go out
there&nbsp; and see what the problem was and he wanted me to go along for
company. I did not think nothing of it at the time so I figured working
hard on the paper I could use a break so I went along.</B><B></B>

<P><B>We got there around 4:30 we pulled into the drive way of the house,
everything looked fine, I always remembered the weather that day it had
become overcast and it looked like we were going to get rain but it never
rained it was just windy, I remember standing on the porch facing the beach
and watching these huge waves crash on the shore line. It was Erie the
beach looked deserted most of the homes had been boarded up I had never
been there during the off season I was so used to visiting during the summer
when it was busy with people, I decided to walk along the shore line it
was strange but at the same time I thought it was cool, anyway getting
back to the house.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My cousin had done a walk through the house and everything looked
fine. he found nothing wrong, he called the alarm company and told them
that, so we reset the alarm and were about to had back to the city when
something triggered the alarm again the motion detector picked something
up, we reset the alarm and it would happen again. my cousin called the
alarm company and it was concluded that there was a mal function and they
would send a man out in the morning to inspect in the mean time my cousin
did not feel comfortable leaving the house and suggested we spend the night
since the alarm repair man was coming in the morning it made sense to him
that we stay so I agreed.</B><B></B>

<P><B>It was not until later that evening that I started to sense a strange
feeling in the house it had become dark and we could not see much outside
we turned on a few lamps in the house we had finished eating Chinese food
that my cousin and I picked up all we had was a radio the television set
was not working so we were just hanging around listening to the radio I
can't tell you how weird that was we called our families at Atlantic City
to let them know where we were and as my cousin was on the phone we heard
a door slam from one of the upstairs bedrooms we both looked at each other
then went upstairs, the house had 4 bedrooms upstairs and 2 down stairs
when we got to the 2nd floor the door to the bedroom facing the north east
part of the house had closed.</B><B></B>

<P><B>we inspected the room all the windows were closed my cousin explained
that the entrance to the attic was in the closet of that bedroom and he
explained that a rush of wind must have got in slamming the door closed
and also what might cause the motion sensor to trigger the alarm it made
no sense to me cause the door to the closet was closed and I failed to
understand his logic on how a rush of wind penetrated a closed door to
close another door, I did not argue I went along with it.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I don't know what was wrong with me that evening I don't know if
the Chinese food I had disagreed with me but I had a weird feeling like
someone was in the house. I always had the sense that someone was watching
me I told my cousin this and he just dismissed me as paranoid, so I decided
to call it a night he went to his bedroom and I went to mine which was
upstairs on the 2nd floor. I made sure the night light in the hall way
was on in case I needed to make a dash for the bathroom I did not want
to crash into anything, and I did not feel comfortable with my door closed
so I left it open.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I had trouble getting comfortable but I remember it being 11:18 on
the clock radio in my room when I believe I fell asleep, Then I had this
bizarre dream I was sitting in a house with people I did not know I wasn't
frightened until I had seen the face of someone I knew who had passed away
this jolted me from my sleep and as I opened my eyes to focus I could see
standing at my door way the silhouette a black fog of a person I wanted
to yell but I could not I know I was seeing something cause I was awake
and there was light coming from the night light in the hall way so I did
see something well I do not have to tell you I never went back to sleep
that night and no one believed my story, I believe there was a ghost in
that house and that was what was causing the motion detectors to go off.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The next day the alarm repair man came to the house and nothing was
found wrong. I told people my story and of course no one believed me except
my uncle who had the house blessed and for as long as they owned the house
nothing unusual happened after the blessing. So I don't know what to think!</B>

<BR><B>Salem Room</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp; littledemonoidinabottle@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>While in Salem Massachusetts, I was staying in a&nbsp; motel just
out of Salem and little ways.&nbsp; Well, when I had checked into a room
the lady at the desk said to me "oh, you have the "haunted room"." and
Im like "the haunted room?" and shes like " oh yea that room has a ghost
that sleeps in the bed every night, I had lots of poeple say they thought
they felt someone come a lay down next to them during the night".&nbsp;
Soo... since I had already paid for the room I kept it, that night after
I got home from wondering around Salem, I went to my room and laid down.
during the night at about 2:00 I slightly woke up and flet someone sit
down next to me on the bed I look over and I saw nothing but that the bed
was indented like someone sitting next to me, I quickly got up and turned
on all the lights. I coulndt belive it happened. then in the morming when
I woke up I found a note that was lightly writen with a pencil that said
"thanks for sharing the bed with me, JH." I quickly got dressed and packed
up.&nbsp; I took the note out to the desk lady and showed it to her and
ask what the intials JH meant, but she didnt know and told me that other
people have had similar notes with the intials JH, I try to research who
used to live around the Salem area with the intials JH but never found
anything.&nbsp; i've never stayed at that motel again ice I was just viviting
friends, I had asked them if they had heard anything about that room and
they hadnt heard of it before.&nbsp; Whitney Gindt</B>

<BR><B>Some interesting encounters</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp; Mavric7652@hotmail.com.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Dan and I have a few stories to share with you and your
readers. One night my friend Paul and I were up at my town's communtiy
center. We've believed for a while that something wasn't right with the
place. So we went up to go take some pictures and stuff at about 1:00 in
the morning. After a 20 min photo session we were about to give up.....until
I went to the back doors of the complex. I took my digital camera and placed
it up against the window and snaped a picture. I took a few steps back
and looked at my friend....we waited for the picture to come up on the
L.C.D. screen. Once it came up we saw what seemed to be the head of a young
girl. The head was cocked to the side and what looked like blood was running
from the side of her mouth. After that we ran....really fast.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Another time Paul and I were up at the same place with my other friend,
Jason. We wanted to take some pictures inside the building. We were able
to open one of the windows. Jason slipped through and opened the door for
us to get in. We noticed a light behind one of the doors, but no cars were
parked outside. Jason, who was wearing sandals at the time, told us to
feel what was coming out of the cracks in the door. We put our faces down
near the floor and a burst of freezing cold air washed over us (now this
was in the middle of july and it was at least 70 degrees in the building).
We tried opening the door. The handle turned but it wouldn't open. We then
noticed the door was unlocked but something was stopping us from entering.
Paul and I went back out side and took a picture of the room the door led
to. We aimed the camera at the door and snapped a picture. When the picture
came up on the L.C.D. screen, we were scared s**tless. There was a large
white figure standing on the other side of the door that Jason was pushing
on. We told Jason to get out of there asap. After we showed Jason the picture,
we ran back to my house.</B><B></B>

<P><B>We have several more stories like this, but I thought two stories
would be enough for now. Tell me what you think of these experiences.</B>

<BR><B>Something Weird</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp; michelehammond@charter.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have had a couple of different experiences. I have no idea why
they have happened or what they're connected to.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my first experience that I can remember
was when I was about 9. I was living in the house that my dad now lives
in by himself but at that time my parents were still together. I was watching
tv at night in my living room&nbsp; and I had a perfect view of the hallway
I just happened to look down the hallway and I saw a figure standing in
the hallway. He looked like a red coat from the revolutionary war but his
face was faded I was really scared but for some reason I couldn't move
I was scared stiff. but he just turned away and walked into my dads room
but I never saw him again.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my next story was at my moms house when I was
about 12 . we lived in a two story house and my room was upstairs, well
I was doing some homework on my bed and my door was open. I saw something
move past my door and I assumed it was my little sister her room was also
upstairs and pats my room , so I called out her name but when she4 answered
her call came from down stairs so I went to investigate but no one was
there!!!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my next came about 1 month later in the same
house I was sleeping down stairs and me and my mom suddenly woke up because
we herd a fire alarm. We ran up stairs&nbsp; and me and my sisters fire
alarms were going off and they wouldn't turn off so my mom ripped them
off the celing!! I have no idea if this is supernatural or not but it was
wierd this happened again about 3 years later in a new house also&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
but my last stoy is when I was about 14 and I was up at about midnight
and my stepdad ran upstairs and nocked on my door and asked if I was screaming
and if I had been running back and forth upsairs . I said no and he tod
me that he had heard a girl screaming and heard someone running upstairs
I was so scared that I slept down stairs. I am now 16 and nothing weird
has happened since . YET!!!!</B>

<BR><B>Sorry here is more!</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp; BlueEyez@kc.rr.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I wanted to update a story and add yet another two. They are short
though.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I wrote recently about how my old house was haunted by the previous
owner who died there. He died next to the telephone in the family room.
I told my neighbor this all the time when I lived there. Well I was hanging
out with my neighbor when she told me this little story.&nbsp; She was
babysitting the new inhabitants daughter. She was putting the little girl
to bed when they both heard a large thud. She thought someone had broken
in when the dog ran in suddenly. The dog is a tiny poodle. So she went
into the family room, and stopped dead in her tracks. A picture on the
wall had fallen and knocked the answering machine off of the table. It
could not have been the dog because the picture was too high. My owner
got someone to join her as quickly as possible.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I also have recently said that my new house is haunted my by late
uncle. Well I have been waking up recently in the middle of the night for
no reason with an eerie feeling.I was talking to my mom today and she had
told me that she was too, and then this morning when she woke up she saw
my uncle walking around her room. She was scared, but cant wait to see
him again because she misses&nbsp; him so much.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My friend also told me that she was at a friends house and for some
reason felt like an old lady was staring at her from the corner of the
room. She later found out that the house was a museum for an old lady.
At her old house a friend was waiting for her to come back home and for
her dad too. She went to the bathroom and while she was there she heard
footsteps down the hall and then the radio turn on. She called out to my
friends dad, but no one was there.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Finally my last and longest story:</B>
<BR><B>My friends and I went into a graveyard one night and one of my friends
told us how her mom and her had a bad feeling about a certain mosaleum.
We decided to drive past it. Whatever was in there seemed to have attached
to us. We could feel a presense while driving. We got out of the car and
sat down at some swings and started swinging slowly while talking. I felt
a weird presence behind me like someone was staring at me. Suddenly I saw
a picture in my head of a teenager with blonde butch cut hair in a red
lettermans jacket with white sleaves, bleached jeans, and tennis shoes,
standing right behind me staring at me. I told my friends that whatever
it was wanted us to leave. My other friend felt it too even though no one
else really believed me. So we went to my car and looked back. Only one
swing was still swinging, and it never stopped until it was out of sight.</B>

<BR><B>Story submission</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp; lo4us_p@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi.&nbsp; I enjoyed looking through your website and thought I would
submit my own story for others to read....</B>
<BR><B>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</B>
<BR><B>I live in Illinois, and in 2002 my fiance and I moved into our first
apartment together.&nbsp; He had always been pretty skeptical of the paranormal,
but I have always been a full believer in the supernatural, having had
many experiences myself.&nbsp; Most of my experiences have been harmless
- there were random times when I felt presences, but none that really scared
me.&nbsp; We had been living in our apartment for several months, and throughout
that entire time I really didn't like going to sleep there by myself.&nbsp;
Whenever my fiance wasn't home and I was getting ready to go to bed, I
would dread the whole process of turning off all the lights, and going
from room to room in the dark, because I always felt like someone was watching
me, or following closely behind me, and it made me nervous.&nbsp; One night,
on a weekend, my fiance was out, and I was home alone.&nbsp; I had finished
watching TV and then figured I should go to bed.&nbsp; I went into the
bedroom, put on my pajamas, then proceeded to the bathroom to do the regular
"getting to bed" stuff(brushing my teeth, washing my face, etc.).&nbsp;
I did all of this BEFORE I turned out all the lights, because it had gotten
to a point where I was too scared to do anything with the lights off, or
even walk into the next room.&nbsp; Once I turned all of the lights off
and was ready to get into bed, I immediately started having those nervous
feelings again, but being normal, and me assuming they were unnecessary
and paranoid fears, I ignored them as I always tried to do.&nbsp; All I
remember is laying in bed, and my fear slowly subsiding as I eventually
started to fall asleep.&nbsp; I'm not sure why I wasn't completely asleep,
but I know I was in that state where I was half asleep and half ake, where
you can sometimes hear the TV but can sleep through it.&nbsp; At that point
I had a thin cotton blanket covering me, and my feet were sticking out
at the bottom.&nbsp; All of&nbsp; sudden I felt something grab my left
big toe and pull on it, hard, which such force that my entire leg shook.&nbsp;
That woke me up in an instant, and although I had been almost asleep and
wasn't perfectly aware of what was going on, I knew what had happened,
and the fear in that completely woke me up.&nbsp; I remember being so startled
that I kicked&nbsp; my legs wildly, in turn kicking the blanket off the
bed.&nbsp; I sat up quickly, and immediately turned on the lamp on the
nightstand.&nbsp; I sat in bed for several seconds looking at the foot
of the bed, at the place where "something"&nbsp; had grabbed my toe and
yanked on it.&nbsp; I half expected to see something, but not seeing anything
at all made it even more frightening, because I could only imagine what
it had been.&nbsp; Needless to say, I ran out of the bedroom so fast it
was almost funny, considering I had been almost asleep not even one minute
before that.&nbsp; I called my fiance and asked him when he would be home,
and I ended up turning on all the lights, turning on the TV, and sitting
on the couch until he got home.&nbsp; I didn't tell him what had happened
that night, I just told him I was scared to be there by myself.&nbsp; The
really eerie thing is, though, I told him about my experience months later,
when we were living in another apartment, and he looked at me incredulously
and said he had experienced the same thing.&nbsp; I was shocked, and I
started asking him questions, so he explained his whole experience to me,
and it was similar to mine.&nbsp; He had been home by himself this time
- I was out for the night.&nbsp; He said he had almost fallen asleep when
something pulled hard on his toe, and jerked on his foot.&nbsp; He said
he also freaked out, but obviously his fear wasn't as great as mine, because
he was able to go back to sleep.&nbsp; I asked him which foot it had been,
and he said his left, just like mine.&nbsp; I don't know if there was bad
energy in that apartment or not, but that was not the only experience I've
had there.&nbsp; I have also woken up in the middle of the night with an
uncomfortable feeling.&nbsp; I have felt as though someone has restrained
me in some way, like I can't move when I want to, and I have even sensed
that someone was standing right next to my side of the bed, staring down
at me from only a few inches away.&nbsp; I'm glad we don't live there anymore.&nbsp;
Thank you for listening to my story. I have more I am not able to explain,
and if you would like to hear those I would be happy to submit them.&nbsp;
Thank you!</B>

<BR><B>South Carolina Hauntings</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp; SAABIN63@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My grandparents leased and ran a motel in Bamberg, SC in the 60's
and 70's.&nbsp; The Pioneer Motel, located on Highway 301, was apparently
built over an Indian burial ground.&nbsp; As a child, I often saw things
that others didn't: a woman in a wispy white gown walking behind the motel,
a man in a hat from what looked like the 50's in a room where no one was
registered, several nuns getting into an abandoned car and disappearing,
a man going into the attic and never returning (my brother saw this one,
too, though.)&nbsp; Odd sounds, moaning in the coffee pot, and the blinds
tinkling when the widows were sealed shut, doors without handles "locking'
closed, pots and pans flying around in the kitchen, were occurrences that
my grandmother, grandfather and mother also experienced.&nbsp; I felt handprints
on my back as I was pushed off the kitchen table with such force that I
landed several feet from the table.&nbsp; I also saw a cow in the field
that no one else saw and had two 'imaginary' friends, Keet-keet and Pikon,
that were good and mischievous, respectively.&nbsp; One day, I reported
that the cow had been run over in the busy highway and Keet-keet and Pikon
were never heard from again.&nbsp; Apparently, an exorcist was brought
in to evaluate the apparitions and occurrences prior to my grandparents'
acquisition of the place.&nbsp; The spirits were determined to be mischievous
in nature and not harmful.&nbsp; There was an article about it in a paper
that was shown to my grandmother, but my recent research into that has
turned up nothing yet.&nbsp; The building was converted into a nursing
home in the early eighties I believe.&nbsp; The employees and elderly residents
were still reporting strange happenings about ten years ago when I last
asked about the place.&nbsp; Just thought you might like to hear about
it.&nbsp; Let me know if you turn up any more information on the place.&nbsp;
I am a Christian now, and thankfully have been relieved of my ability to
'see' these things. However, occasionally, I still sense things around
me and feelings of despair I don't always understand.&nbsp; Weird, huh?&nbsp;
Anyway, hope this was of interest.&nbsp; Lynn M.</B>

God I finally found a website in which I could share some ghost experiences!!
Ok here goes....</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had moved from
Brooklyn, New York to Boca Raton, Florida in 1989.&nbsp;&nbsp; After a
long time of searching for a house, we&nbsp; found one up for rent.&nbsp;
We quickly moved in any furniture that we had left (we sold most of our
furniture before moving). and settled in.&nbsp; Then, it started.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My room was located&nbsp;
in the front of the house and my bathroom was right across. IN between
my bathroom and bedroom was a wall.&nbsp; When we had moved in, I was always
afraid of sleeping in my room. I would play, get dressed, etc... in the
room but never sleep in there.&nbsp; It was just something about that room
that I didn't like.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then one night,
my mom was watching tv and she had the urge to look in my room.&nbsp; When
u sit in the living room, you could look right into my room.&nbsp; When
she looked in, she saw the shadow of a little boy running and then dissipating
along the wall of my room.&nbsp; My mom wasnt really freaked out by it,
but thought it was her eyes playing tricks on her.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, in 1990,
the real stuff happened.&nbsp; One night, my mom had gotten up to use my
bathroom around 3:00 in the morning. It was one of those half awake- half
asleep things.&nbsp; My mom has the habit of leaving the bathroom door
open.&nbsp; Then, all of&nbsp; a sudden, this man, he must of been about
seven feet tall, walked by the door and disappeared through the&nbsp; wall.&nbsp;
He was dressed in all black and had a big top hat on. Now my mom was really
AWAKE!!!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another time, my
mom was sleeping in my room one afternoon.&nbsp; She was in one of those
sound sleeps, where nothing could wake her.&nbsp; Suddenly, someone slapped
the back of her ankles.&nbsp; It felt like a man's hand. Now, let me get
something straight.&nbsp; Nobody was in the house at the time.&nbsp; Now,
the weird thing was that everything that happened in the house was in my
room.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We finally brought
a priest in to bless the house and after that, nothing happened.&nbsp;
We lived in that house for ten years and moved out.&nbsp; I never really
went into the history of the house.&nbsp; Now that I think of it, I should
of.&nbsp; Well, Thanks for listening.</B>

<BR><B>The Voice on The Line</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp; svennist@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; Hi there,</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I'm guess this probably isn't a ghost experience as such,
but it's a couple of pretty interesting occurrences which happened to my
family.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; In the early nineties, my brother was in the British army,
serving in the gulf. On night, as my mum was watching the news, we saw
that his unit was involved in some heavy fighting near the border. Obviously
she was really worried, but around 10pm she had a phone call. She didn't
recognize the voice, but the person said not to worry, your son is fine.
He'll call soon.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; Ordinarily, a call like that would be pretty scary, but for
some reason my mum found it really calming. She slept really well for the
first time in ages, and sure enough, a few days later we got a call, and
my brother was indeed fine. Shortly after that, the fighting ended, and
he came home unhurt.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; Later, I joined the Police, and after a number of years, was
involved in what turned out to be a very serious riot, lasting several
days. My mum, again, was at home, watching it all on the news, and worrying.
Sure enough though, the night of the worst violence when a lot of officers
were badly injured, the phone rang. The same voice she had heard almost
ten years before told her, don't worry, your son is fine, he'll call soon.
Again, the voice was completely calming and she was able to sleep well
again. And I did get through it all pretty much unhurt.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; I'm glad to say that neither of us have been in a position
to cause my mum so much worry since, as we've both left our respective
services, and my mum still can't think who the voice could have been.</B>

<BR><B>The visitor at the door</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp; lovenest12001@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>One night when my husband and I had a break from our three kids,
and we had a chance to go out for the evening. we were partying and didn't
get to bed until about 5:00am..</B>
<BR><B>when we finally did get to bed we fell right to sleep. I think maybe
about a half an hour or so all of a sudden a loud beating at the door,
BOOM BOOM BOOM, I woke up and my husband was already at the door asking
who was there but no answer!!!!!</B>
<BR><B>i asked my husband who was there and he had said he opened the door
and no one was there, but we both heard it and we were both wide awake
after we had just woke from a dead sleep....after we knew no one was there,
but we knew what we heard, we fell back to sleep... When just to be woken
again to a presence in the room that made my husband very aware for us
to never party again or death would come to one of us.</B>
<BR><B>My husband has a lot of strange things happen to him like the sort..
but this time I was there to witness it. Now every now and then when I
tell someone about this something weird happens.. Like one time the tv
flashed on and off.. Or me and a friend were standing by the lake and when
I told her about it all of a sudden a couple of fish jumped....</B>
<BR><B>Now that could be just a coincidence or something of the supernatural
but whatever it is it is not normal everyday occurrences... My mother died
and my husbands father also has passed and this is not the first strange
thing to happen to us and I’m sure it won't be the last.....</B>

<BR><B>THE HOUSE ON WILSON STREET, AUGUSTA,GA</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp; Steltona@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Name is Adam. I used to live on Wilson St. in Augusta, for about
a year and a half, anway, here is my story.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I moved in that house 'round 90 and left about&nbsp; '91.</B>
<BR><B>It all started about two weeks after my sister, my mom and I moved
in.</B>
<BR><B>I had just gotten home from middle school and I was by myself, my
mom was at work and so was my sister.</B>
<BR><B>Well, I was extremely tired from the long day-so I decided to just
chill on the couch and call my girlfriend who was supposed to come by and
see me, anyway-I had just sat down to watch TV when all of a sudden I heard
my name being called from my sister's room.</B>
<BR><B>i got up to investigate but found nothing ,so I go back to sit down
when I heard it again-</B>
<BR><B>ADAM=ADAM COME HEEEERE, Didn't know what to make of it, so I ignored
it.</B>
<BR><B>Wait, it gets worse.</B>
<BR><B>I hear the voice again thinking it was my girlfriend at the time-but
she was at the store,</B>
<BR><B>Then I heard the refrigerator door open and slam shut, went into
the kitchen -- nothing.</B>
<BR><B>then I walk through the whole house -not a thing, two hours went
by-</B>
<BR><B>around five o'clock my girl showed up-we decided to watch a movie
that she had rented</B><B></B>

<P><B>that's when things started up again-all of a sudden the air conditioning
kicked on by itself-</B>
<BR><B>then too my girlfriend heard her name being called ever so softly-Dawn-Dawn
where are you</B>
<BR><B>she thought it was me but I was outside getting the mail. she had
asked if I was trying to call her for something I said no. coming back
into the house I entered the front door and walked by the fireplace and
I noticed something eerie on the rug by the fireplace in the black soot</B>
<BR><B>There were words -- help me please! And all the candles that were
in candle holders were out of the holders -- on the mantle. then we could
both hear footsteps walking through the kitchen and through the front room
and suddenly stopped. I tried to call to whatever or whomever it was but
got no response until an hour later -Dawn, who had some problems at home
got kicked out of her house- had asked my mom if it was OK with her to
stay there</B>
<BR><B>for a while-of course she agreed, anyway Dawn had fallen asleep
with her head on my lap</B>
<BR><B>then I decided to ask again if there was anyone in the house and
if there was if I could help in some way which I knew I could not. then
a face appeared on the TV I asked her if she shut the TV off and she said
that she had-I told her well, there is the face of a woman on the screen,
of course she woke up and saw it too, we both froze. Just staring back
at this thing.</B>
<BR><B>The hair on the back of our necks stood straight up. And in the
kitchen the fan started by itself.</B><B></B>

<P><B>this is a long story -can't tell it all. a few days later I called&nbsp;
friend of mine that used to own</B>
<BR><B>The house and asked him id he knew the history of the house -- he
said that he did.</B>
<BR><B>he told me that about three years ago-a family that lived in the
house had passed away suddenly and their spirits were trapped. the husband
was very abusive and drank just about every day ,well, the wife couldn't
stand his behavior and started having an affair -</B>
<BR><B>He found out and one day shot and killed her -- the children too-reason
unknown.</B>
<BR><B>he died of heart failure. anyway-the face I saw on the TV was that
of the young lady who was shot-and the footsteps were that of the Husband
- the two children were the ones calling</B>
<BR><B>our names the two shared the bedroom that was currently my sister's.
same thing happened to my sister. my mom said that on one occasion she
could see two children playing in the backyard. especially on Halloween
things really get into an uproar-if you have enough guts to walk past the
house&nbsp; in the dark&nbsp;&nbsp; you can see a man and&nbsp; a woman
fighting in the front room and every night 'round midnight you can also
hear gunshots coming from the shotgun and hear blood curdling screams.</B>

<BR><B>The White Thing</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp; midD2332@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi Shadowlands staff!!!! My name is Derek and me and my friends have
been experiencing some weird things lately. I'm fairly new in my neighborhood
and my friends and I got interested in ghosts just over the summer. We
got into this conversation one day about some stuff we saw and when we
were talkin we both brought up somethin about seeing a "white thing". We
have seen it many times and we dont kno wut 2 think. I remember one day
that he had to go inside his house and get something and he told me to
wait on his deck. So I just stood there and took a glance at the woods.
I saw something COMPLETELY white just walk bye and it was about as tall
as a human. The odd thing is that we only see it when we're alone. We forgot
about it for a while and his friend had mentioned some time later about
a haunted house that was ironically almost right next to me. We investigated
and found lots of paranormal activity. There were no cars at the house
except for the one in the backyard that had vines growing on its wheels.
Each day we saw the the shades would be up or down, different from the
day before. My friend Zach had been in the friend yard while his brother
and I were in the back and he said something weird had happened when he
said bad things to the house. (dont ask) So I tried it while they were
in the backyard at night. When I said, "You're worthless" to the house
(I didn't mean it) the lights just suddenly turned on. It scared the s**t
out of me! I then saw the white thing glaring at me from the attic. I ran
to the backyard and told my friends. Well, the neighbors caught us snooping
around so we stopped going there. To this day, we still talk about the
many weird things that have happened to us.</B>

<BR><B>Tiny Footsteps</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp; tulips2425@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I truly believe that there are ghost amongst us, although I don’t
think I would be able to handle seeing one directly, here is my story;
My boyfriend, now fiance, and I have been living in the same apartment
in South Eastern Pennsylvania for about 2 years now.&nbsp; He, being the
fearless sort, on more than one occasion asked me if I saw something strange…I
never did.&nbsp; He has said to me over and over that he has seen things
out of the corner of his eye, or when he enters a room, he gets the feeling
that someone/thing has just left.&nbsp; Just recently, around 3 am, we
were sleeping and I heard our 3 year old come into our room.&nbsp; Whenever
she comes in at night there is the unmistakeable sound of her little feet
shuffling across the carpet.&nbsp; I did hear that shuffling sound, and
it came into our room and then stopped.&nbsp; I thought that maybe she
came in to use the bathroom, so I did not pay it any mind (and it was 3
am so I was exhausted).&nbsp; Then I heard my fiance say, come over here
and lay with me babe, I heard the shuffling go from next to my head around
the bottom of the bed and up the other side to where my fiance lay.&nbsp;
This is where is got strange, I felt him lift up the blanket to let ‘her’
lay with him.&nbsp; At this point, I woke up and asked him if she was all
right.&nbsp; He did not answer, so I reached around to feel her forehead
(thinking maybe she didn’t feel well), and she was not there!&nbsp; I got
out of bed, went into her room…. she was lying there sound asleep.&nbsp;
I came back into our room, lay back down, and noticed a dark shadow on
the wall.&nbsp; Now, there was no lights on, so I wasn’t sure what was
making the shadow cast against this wall, but was too tired to really think
about it until I started to get comfortable again and opened my eyes for
a second and saw the ‘shadow’ stride across the room and into my closet.&nbsp;
I told my fiance about it in the morning, he did not remember our daughter
coming in or me trying to wake him up.&nbsp; I asked my daughter if she
got up in the night, she said that she did, but “I” told her to go back
to bed…</B>

<BR><B>Tormented Spirit</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp; gabrielledouglas@excite.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to add a few stories to
your archive. I have several known experiences and a few that may have
been possible experiences (not sure, happened many years ago as a small
child). I grew up always feeling like I was being watched in my parents'
home that had been built back in 1911. I dismissed it as paranoia because
I believed these things didn't exist. The experience that rudely awakened
me happened in 1999. I was 19 years old and had moved into my first apartment.
It was an old house in Seward, NE that had been divided up into 4 tiny
apartments and I was in the upper floor. After a few weeks I began to feel
eerie whenever I walked up the staircase at night. I bought those flashlights
that hook onto your keychain to feel safe, thinking I must be losing it.
After a while, it must have followed me into my apartment because I began
to feel these strange feelings as I walked into my door at night. After
a month, things started happening. At night while I slept, I would be awakened
by what seemed like someone punching me in the shoulder. On some nights
this would happen whenever I was on the verge of sleep so that I wouldn't
sleep all night long. I would show up at my college classes the next day
looking very drained. I started getting worried looks from my professors
in several classes because this was unusual for me. Also, on more than
s eral occasions, I would hear and feel a person crawling into bed next
to me. I saw the blankets move around me, could feel the movements in my
mattress like someone was crawling in bed. By this time I was terrified.
I was terrified from the moment I entered the house every night after coming
home from my part time job at the grocery store. On some occasions I could
swear that I felt like I was several inches in the air above my mattress
and would fall back down just as I fully awakened from my sleep. I was
so scared (because I knew it could grasp objects if it could touch me)
that I would move all sharp objects from my room and lock my bedroom door
at night. Finally, I bolted upright in bed one night, I was fed up. I screamed
at whatever was torturing me that I was no longer afraid and to show itself
if it dared. I threw open a Bible in front of me and screamed that I was
a child of God and that it couldn't hurt me. Every night after that I would
go to sleep with my bible clutched against my chest and chanting the Lords
Prayer in my mind as I drifted off. From that night onward, all I heard
was low pitched growling noises, nothing else.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another experience that I had was
in an apartment in Lincoln, NE, about a year later. It was a basement of
a house that was converted into an apartment. For a while I felt a presence
there. Things would up and disappear on me and I would find them in a different
place later. One day I had a friend over and out of the blue she said that
there was a presence that had been following me around for a while, that
she knew about, and it was in the room with us. It was communicating with
her. She vividly described scenes from a house where I cleaned for an older
lady for extra money, a house she had never been in. She described the
pictures on the walls and the three dogs that kept the lady company. Apparently
that is where the presence followed me from. He told her he was a 19-year-old
boy who had died in the 1980's while driving past a target shooting range
a stray bullet hit him in the head. He was wearing blue jeans and a white
shirt the day he died. He told her that he followed me because he knew
that I knew he existed. That I sensed he was there, even though I didn't
know what I was sensing. He apparently liked me. He told me, through her,
that I had certain psychic abilities. That I could feel the presence of
spirits, but could only actually see them in my dreams, because of a certain
level of psyche that was only present while I was in a state of deep sleep.
He told me the people who don't believe in spirits are the people who don't
have these abilities and don't have experiences. Not long later, I began
to feel a very hostile presence in my apartment. I invited my friend back
and she told me there was a second presence there and the first one was
trying to drive it away but was unsuccessful because he wasn't as strong
as this second presence. She said she could sense that it was a young person,
a female child, who died from some sort of physical abuse and was very
angry. Another friend gave me a syringe filled with rosemary and instructed
me to put a drop on every wall and under every doorway of the apartment
and chant a blessing as I did so, and to fall asleep with a white candle
lit, so that the bad would be driven away without driving away the good
presence. It seemed to work. I no longer felt the hostile presence. Then
one night not long after this I experienced a dream that I somehow felt
wasn't just a dream. I was in a white room with no walls or ceilings or
floors, just white. A young man approached me wearing blue jeans and a
very white shirt, pale features, sharp European facial features. He told
me his name was Michael and we had a conversation about something I can't
remember. I felt positive upon waking that I had met the 19-year-old entity
that kept me company.</B><B></B>

I hope you enjoyed these stories!</B>

<BR><B>Uncle Russell</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp; DicheleL@Thomas-Mack.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I ran into your site and would like to share my ghost story with
you.. We had moved into my gramma's house when I was like 16years old.&nbsp;
My sister was</B>
<BR><B>13.&nbsp; We were in the house a few months and my sister was talking
to my mother about seeing a man in her bedroom and I said DONT tell me
or talk about it in front of me because I wont sleep upstairs, I will be
too afraid.</B>
<BR><B>Weeks went by and I was laying in my bed on the outside of the bed
and I opened my eyes and I was facing like up at the ceiling and I cant
quite exactly say what it was but it looked like a blackness in the room
like a black cloud up on the ceiling and I closed my eyes, I must if been
half awake and half asleep.. A little bit went by and I opened my eyes
and I was facing now towards the inside of the bed more and there was a
man laying on my bed, like with his feet at my head of the bed and he was
just leaning back on his elbow watching me.&nbsp; He was in a light blue
button down shirt, sandy brown hair, very good looking around 20-25 years
old maybe.&nbsp; He started to lean forward off his elbow towards me and
I heard this like buzzing in my head, I was petrified and started shaking
trying to wake myself up and in a blink, he was gone.&nbsp; I hd forgotten
all about what I saw until the next day when I got home from school and
my mom got home from work and my mom said to me she got no sleep last night
because I crawled in bed with her and between me and the dog, my mom was
sleeping against the wall all night, no room, lol.. I said OH MY GOD, mom
I saw a man in my room.. She asked me what he looked like and it was the
same man my sister had seen in her room.. My sister then said one night
she woke up from a nightmare to that man standing at the bottom of her
bed holding her leg as almost to be comforting her.&nbsp; One night she
woke up to him having one knee on the bed crawling over her.&nbsp; Now
that would of freaked me out, oh my god.&nbsp; So we called my Aunt who
knew a woman that was into this kind of stuff and she said to try the automatic
writing, but to make sure we bless ourselves before we do it.. She also
said the spirits are there to hurt you unless you have a restless/mean
one so when I feel scared just say leave me alone, your scaring me.. SO
that night we slept my mom, sister and myself with the dog and cat, lol,
in my moms bed and all that night the room would get real cold and then
back to normal and then real cold.. Well the next day we sat in the kitchen
and started the automatic writing, my mom tried it and nothing, my sister
tried it and nothing.&nbsp; I tried it and the pen started moving, the
first picture it drew was of what it looked like to us 2 people in a bedlike
with cirlces for their heads and the covers up their neck and then perfectly
drawn was the front view of a dogs legs, totally bowed like a pitbull,
in which our pitbull Babe always slept with my mom and then there was like
an arrow going down in which really looked like a devils tail with the
point at the end curving around the dog pointing down SO we didnt know
what to make of that and we did it again, this time it wrote</B>
<BR><B>RUSSELLLOVESYOUEVERYONE... Russell Loves You Everyone.. My Uncles
Russell, my moms only brother, died when he was 48 of a heart attack, I
was very young, but I remember him.&nbsp; Weird thing was the guy in my
bed wasnt him, someone said if someone is gone a long time, they arent
strong enough to</B>
<BR><B>come back themselves so they send someone else for them, is this
true, have you ever heard of that?&nbsp; Then my mom said my uncle when
he was in his 20'sworked at a local factory and wore light blue button
down shirts all the time, so maybe that was him younger, can they change
age once gone to appear to you in?&nbsp; Funny hing is when my gramma was
alive, my aunt and cousin lived with her to help her and my aunt said my
gramma used to say every night GOODNIGHT RUSSELL and we all thought she
was just getting old and she made no mistake of letting us know how much
she missed her only son.&nbsp; Maybe he was with her the whole time?&nbsp;
Well thank you for taking the time to read my story.. We moved from NY
to NV about 2.5years ago and I asked my mom to leave the auto writings
back home, just incase anything was attached to them.&nbsp; I didnt want
to bring anything into my new home out here.. She buried them back home
at the grave of&nbsp; my Uncle Russell.&nbsp; Well thank you again and
any input you have will be nice to hear..</B>

<BR><B>The vanishing cat</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp; RudyBM111743@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I just had to send you this story. I couldn't believe it happened
let alone keep it to myself.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I had been invited for a Thanks giving lunch in the retirement home
where I used to work at. It was a buffet and there was a variety of food
to select from. I chose a roasted whole chicken leg together with other
food stuff and turkey, of course. Having finished, I went into the kitchen
to dispose of my trash. The place for this was a small closet in a corner
with a little folding leaf table which was immaculate with deep reddish
brown shiny finish. I was walking towards this closet when I was met by
a large cat with black and white fur. It got in my way, almost getting
stepped on, rubbing and wrapping its black tail on my legs, looking up
at the plate of trash and meowing as it walked with me just like a pet
cat would do. It looked like it was very hungry. I understood what it wanted
so I picked the chicken leg bone out of the plate and not having the proper
cat dish on which to put it I laid it on the table. In a flash the cat
jumped on the table and began attacking the chicken bone. To get a good
grip on the bone, it had to lay its right ear on the surface of the table
as it grabbed on the hip joint. It chewed on it for a little bit and then
began shoving the whole piece into its mouth. It made a mess on the immaculate
table and I was already thinking how to clean it up when the cat stood
up, leg bone in its mouth. Then it jumped down from the table. Now this
was when the unbelievable occurred.</B><B></B>

<P><B>On jumping down, the cat vanished just before landing on the floor.
Just as the cat was vanishing, I saw the hazy figure of the chicken leg
bone for may be a couple of seconds in the same space where the cat had
vanished then it too vanished into thin air! Not expecting anything ghostly
or paranormal at a time and place like this, I was just so puzzled I even
tried to look for the possible places where the cat could have run into.
From where I was standing I could have seen the cat run away in any direction.
But it didn't run away. It just vanished in its space just before hitting
the floor and the chicken leg bone with it!</B><B></B>

<P><B>All hair raised, I did not forget to clean up the mess left by the
vanishing cat.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I asked one of the helps who was busy filling up some glasses with
juices if she had seen a cat. She said yes, black and white tom sitting
right by the closet door early that morning. I just thought, my gosh, that
was even before I had come to lunch! I asked if the cat was a pet here.
She said she has never seen the cat before. I couldn't say anything more.
I already knew I had a secret to keep.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I went back to the gathering and never said a word about what I had
just witnessed. I did not want to cause a scare neither be looked at as
one of those possessed with a dented brain.</B><B></B>

<P><B>If anyone has any credible explanation to or knows what this occurrence
is, please email me right away.</B>

<BR><B>Walk By</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp; Chobbs186@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was about six at the time, living in Dallas, Texas, but I remember
it clearly.&nbsp; I was using the hallway bathroom when a man that was
all white, clothing and all walked by the doorway.&nbsp; Needless to say
I finished my business and went to ask my mother and her friend if they
had just walked by or had seen anyone walk by.&nbsp; They both looked at
me like I was crazy.&nbsp; I saw him on more than one occasion.&nbsp; He
never bothered anyone or anything but it always freaked me out to see him.&nbsp;
He was always solid, all white, and never stopped to look at me, just walked
right by.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Another experience at that house that has never happened in the other
two places of residency was that time would seem to speed up or slow down.&nbsp;
It was really weird because I didn't skip ahead or black out, but I would
realize that things were moving in literally a fast forward motion, even
talking.&nbsp; It only happened when I was really upset or getting punished.&nbsp;
Time would speed up while my mother was yelling at me or I was furious.&nbsp;
I don't know if I was imagining it or if it is some psychological thing
or really was a spirit but I know I was conscious and fully knew that time
was going faster than normal and thought it was strange but nothing more.&nbsp;
If you have had any experiences like that please write to me.&nbsp; I want
to know what really happened there.</B>

<BR><B>Why they crawl</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp; hot_monkeylips@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am an avid believer in the paranormal, always have been, I am not
a psychic and I can't talk to the dead like so&nbsp; any claim they can....
but what I hear in my room at night is all too real. I always keep my closet
doors closed because I believe that they are a passage between the world
of the living and the world of the deceased, I feel a little safer knowing
nothing can get in. We moved into this house 4 years ago, and for 3 years
my bedroom has been in the basement, this year it was moved up to the old
master room. I make sure the closet doors are closed everynight before
I go to bed, but some mornings I awake to find them open. Also, the crawling.
A sound on both the left and right side of my bed that sounds like people
crawling on thier hands and knees, as if they are playing a game, I get
a very femenine feeling when I hear it, which is almost everynight.All
my freinds are hardcore skeptics.... so this is the first time I have told
the story. I never try and get a look, or try and talk to whom ever it
is.... fear always gets the better of me. I can tell one is a grown up
and one is a small child about 5... the feeling I get anyway, they crawl
in circles around the bed, sometimes even giggling softly. Once I even
watched as my closet door first twitched a bit, then slowly creaked open,
two seconds later the crawling began. I spose they are harmless (never
hurt me in anyway yet) and I just leave them to thier games, they seem
happy in thier own way. It will happen tonight, and tomorrow night... just
as always. Thankyou for listening to my story, glad to know I have people
in which I can put my trust to believe.</B>

<BR><B>Why I didn't want to leave</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp; BlueEyez@kc.rr.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was little I had a ghost. It was my ghost,
and only mine. I knew this because no one else in my family saw it. There
were two ghosts in my house, but the one of the man who owned it before
us was the nice one. I saw him all the time. Always out of the corner of
my eye. He would wear a yellow shirt and khackis with a black belt. He
was an old man with gray and white hair and he had a beer belly that looked
a lot like my dad's. He used to watch me play barbies. I always used to
play in front of my closet because thats where my barbies were. Sometimes
he would get mad and yell at me. He would shake his finger, but I could
never hear anything just see him talking. He would slam the door shut in
a specific way to. He would wrap his hand around the wooden door like some
people do their car doors. I was always scared he would get his hand caught.
Often I would see him walk past my door. I always thought it was my dad,
so I would call for him. My dad, however, would be at the other end of
the house. I always felt that he was protecting me. He was like a friend
and a grandpa. At night I felt that my closet was haunted too. I once saw
slaves in their. I could describe their clothing to the day. The man had
brown overalls and a white shirt, and he was standing right next to the
woman, facing her. She had on a white apron and brown dress with tiny white
flowers on it. She was holding a broom. I was terrified, but I am now intrigued
as to why these were centered around my door and closet.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second thing, or third rather, in my house,
was a very bad feeling down the hall near my sisters room and&nbsp; bathroom.
I never really saw anything in there. It was just a feeling as if I was
NOT welcome their. I would vacuum backing out of her room and standing
in the the bathroom bc I refused to have my back to that room. I wouldn't
go into the bathroom alone other than this.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, my uncle died recently. I moved into
another house. He has knocked over our Christmas tree when my mom was mocking
him and thrown things at me. Once, after we moved here, I was walking upstairs.
I stepped on the last step and the tv in my room snapped on. The screen
hadn't even lit up yet so I knew it was not my imagination! I ran really
fast to my mothers room. She took me up to my room, and the next day she
told me that she had seen my uncle in the mirror in my bathroom. Then after
that the light in my room made a shape of man. He was always kinda a jokester,
and I'm sure he still loves teasing me.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, I don't understand why only I see these
things. My mom has only seen it once, I dunno. At least she believes me!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Two that Happened to Me</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: alicia.glasl@iinet.net.au</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My first experience was when I was very little. I was living at my
house in the country at the time and there was a small old cottage out
the front. I never really thought of it as much. One night I was about
to go to bed and I couldnt reach up to close my curtains so mum said she
will do it later. During the night I woke up and saw a lady with short
brown hair dressed in a white gown closeing my windows so at the time I
thought of it as mum so I said "MUM" and it turned around and walked towards
me with its hands out like it was going to stungle me so I quickly covered
my face with my blanket and waited till morning. In the morning my mum
said she had never closed my curtains she forgot and dad never did. So
it was unexplained untill my grandfather said about 100 years ago a lady
was murdered in that cottage by her husband.</B>
<BR><B>Another experience was when I was in grade 6 I decided to stay up
on Chrismas Eve wanting to see who would put the presents under the tree
and close to midnight I saw a headless turkey as big as me walking up the
stars towards my room. I closed my eyes and pretended I was asleep and
the next thing I know I could feel it go into me. Till this day I have
no itention of staying up on Christmas eve and have no idea what it was.</B>

<P><B>My Grandfathers Visit</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:aycole25@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am in love with this site!&nbsp; I am writing to tell you</B>
<BR><B>of one of the experiences that I have had with the paranormal.</B>
<BR><B>Alittle back-ground first.&nbsp; My Grandfather was a very good
man.&nbsp; He loved</B>
<BR><B>to supervise everything that you were doing, even if he had no idea</B>
<BR><B>about it.&nbsp; About a year after his passing my grandmother decided
to do</B>
<BR><B>a little cosmetic work a few of the rooms in her house.&nbsp; Me
being a good</B>
<BR><B>grand-daughter I went over to help with the job.&nbsp; It</B>
<BR><B>was early in the day (before lunch time) and I was on a ladder with
a</B>
<BR><B>spatula scraping old wallpaper from the corners of the room.&nbsp;
All of</B>
<BR><B>the sudden my hair stood on end and a cold rush of wind came into
the</B>
<BR><B>room.&nbsp; Immediately following that rush of wind was the overpowering
smell</B>
<BR><B>of Old Spice aftershave.&nbsp; It was the only scent that he ever
wore.</B>
<BR><B>I could understand if we were using steam to lift the wallpaper
and</B>
<BR><B>residual scent was coming out that way but I was not!&nbsp; My Gram
was there</B>
<BR><B>too.&nbsp; She said "He's just here to check on you. He's supervising
just</B>
<BR><B>like always."She says that he comes to her in dreams sometimes and</B>
<BR><B>he does things like chang the channell and close windows at night.</B>
<BR><B>But there have been a few times where she dances with him and wakes</B>
<BR><B>up when he touches her face.&nbsp; We all miss him but these things</B>
<BR><B>make going on every day a little easier.&nbsp; Thanks for letting
me</B>
<BR><B>share my story.</B><B></B>

<P><B>New Home</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>I've submitted stories to this site before, but they were always
things that</B>
<BR><B>happened to me when I was younger.&nbsp; I haven't had any experiences
for a</B>
<BR><B>while.&nbsp; In August I moved into a new home with my mom.&nbsp;
I am 27 years old,</B>
<BR><B>educated, with a good career.&nbsp; My father recently passed away
and I moved in</B>
<BR><B>with my mom to help her out with some things until she was ready
to live on</B>
<BR><B>her own.&nbsp; So we got this little house, and I lived there for
a week alone</B>
<BR><B>without any furniture.&nbsp; The place had such an intense, odd
feeling.&nbsp; And</B>
<BR><B>even though it has only been 4 months since we have lived there,
so many</B>
<BR><B>strange things have been happened.&nbsp; My first night there I
fell asleep on</B>
<BR><B>the floor, only to wake up because I felt the floor shake as someone
walked</B>
<BR><B>up to me and stood over me.&nbsp; My eyes flew open and sat up -
no one was</B>
<BR><B>there.&nbsp; Figured I was dreaming.&nbsp; But I felt an intense....I
don't know how</B>
<BR><B>to explain it.&nbsp; Just that someone was invading my space.&nbsp;
I had goodbumps</B>
<BR><B>everywhere.&nbsp; The next day was Saturday, as I got ready for
the day I felt</B>
<BR><B>like someone was watching me.&nbsp; And not just watching me, but
watching</B>
<BR><B>intensely and I felt uncomfortable.&nbsp; So I left.&nbsp; And as
soon as I was gone I</B>
<BR><B>forgot about it and enjoyed my day.&nbsp; Until I came home that
afternoon and</B>
<BR><B>the door opened for me...weirdness!&nbsp; I "heard" in my mind "Where
were you?</B>
<BR><B>I've been so lonely without you..."&nbsp; Now THAT was STRANGE.&nbsp;
Like I said, I</B>
<BR><B>fancy myself to be rational and sane.&nbsp; I don't usually hear
"voices" in my</B>
<BR><B>head.&nbsp; Finally the feeling of having my space invaded, and
someone with me</B>
<BR><B>so close all day to the point where I couldn't breathe....I just
said "Look,</B>
<BR><B>you're welcome here if you want to stay or whatever.&nbsp; But please
oh please</B>
<BR><B>just give me my space!"&nbsp; Nothing happened for a while.</B>
<BR><B>After my mom moved in I told her everything that I experienced.&nbsp;
She of</B>
<BR><B>course is a skeptic to the core and didn't believe me.&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp;
Then one</B>
<BR><B>week she was fidgety and nervous all week.&nbsp; I finally asked
her what was</B>
<BR><B>wrong...she told me that she had been hearing voices...a man and
a woman in</B>
<BR><B>deep conversations and she was picking up&nbsp; phrases such as
"she thinks..."</B>
<BR><B>and "this one here...." and she often heard a woman weeping but
could never</B>
<BR><B>find the source.&nbsp; Sometimes when in her homeoffice at the computer
she would</B>
<BR><B>feel someone rush up at her from behind and breathe down her neck...only
to</B>
<BR><B>turn around and no one is there.</B>
<BR><B>One night I couldn't sleep.&nbsp; I was up watching television when
I got a</B>
<BR><B>chill.&nbsp; The stereo turned on, switched to cd mode, and started
playing a cd.</B>
<BR><B>The next night the tv in my mom's room turned on and started flipping</B>
<BR><B>channels.</B>
<BR><B>Sometimes I smell odd smells in that house.&nbsp; Sweat is the one
I smell the</B>
<BR><B>most.&nbsp; I smell a sweaty man often.&nbsp; Especially in the
hall from the living</B>
<BR><B>room to my mom's room.&nbsp; Very strange.&nbsp; One night I was
lying in bed.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>couldn't sleep again.&nbsp; I was awake, just staring at the ceiling
when I heard</B>
<BR><B>a commotion outside, followed by our front door opening.&nbsp; I
thought "Oh Mom</B>
<BR><B>must be checking to see what that noise was..." no sooner had I
thought that</B>
<BR><B>when I heard someone running up the stairs toward my room.&nbsp;
Then it sounded</B>
<BR><B>like they fell down the stairs...I thought Mom was hurrying trying
to get to</B>
<BR><B>me for some reason and then tripped and fell down the stairs.&nbsp;
I jumped out</B>
<BR><B>of bed so fast - that's when I heard a man's voice right outside
my bedroom</B>
<BR><B>door - he sounded upset.&nbsp; I jerked that door open not sure
what I was going</B>
<BR><B>to find - nothing.&nbsp; I stepped out into the hall and stood at
the top of the</B>
<BR><B>stairs.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; Not a sound.&nbsp; Not a shadow.&nbsp;
Nothing.&nbsp; The nightlight was</B>
<BR><B>on, it's bright enough to see...&nbsp; everything was TOO quiet.&nbsp;
I crept down</B>
<BR><B>the stairs to my mom's room.&nbsp; She was sound asleep.&nbsp; Everything
was so still</B>
<BR><B>and quiet.</B>
<BR><B>There was nothing and no one there and yet I couldn't explain what
had</B>
<BR><B>happened.&nbsp; So I just went back to bed and had the best sleep
I've had in a</B>
<BR><B>long time!</B>
<BR><B>I finally saw something recently.&nbsp; I was on the phone when
I heard my mom</B>
<BR><B>frantically moving around in the living room.&nbsp; I went out and
said "What's</B>
<BR><B>up?&nbsp; What are you doing?"&nbsp; She said "Did you hear that
loud crashing noise?</B>
<BR><B>Did you hear that?"&nbsp; She was looking everywhere for the source
of the noise.</B>
<BR><B>I never heard a thing.&nbsp; So I went to the front door, she said
"I looked out</B>
<BR><B>the peep hole but it was all foggy and I couldn't see anything."&nbsp;
When I</B>
<BR><B>opened the door I had the oddest feeling.&nbsp; Something was obstructing
my</B>
<BR><B>view, it was just misty white and before I even had time to really
process</B>
<BR><B>it - *pop* - it was gone.&nbsp; Weird.&nbsp; I shut the door and
said "Oh don't worry</B>
<BR><B>Mom.&nbsp; It's just the ghost."&nbsp; I was half teasing, figured
I was seeing</B>
<BR><B>things.&nbsp; Until later that night when I went out to run an errand....I</B>
<BR><B>stepped out and headed for my car, when "something" stepped out
from the</B>
<BR><B>bushes.&nbsp; It was that white misty "something" again - just standing
there.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>got the impression it was leaning up against the wall between the
wall and</B>
<BR><B>the bushes, just waiting for me to come out.&nbsp; And when I did
- it stepped</B>
<BR><B>out and I saw it and *pop* it was gone again.&nbsp; All very strange.</B>
<BR><B>I've woken up in the night to see two faces smiling at me and floating</B>
<BR><B>around - a man and a woman.&nbsp; The man is bearded and the woman
has her hair</B>
<BR><B>piled up on top of her head.&nbsp; I am not afraid of them, but
I don't know what</B>
<BR><B>they want.&nbsp; So I just let them do their thing.&nbsp; They come
and go and we'll</B>
<BR><B>go a couple of weeks with no activity, and then all of the sudden
something</B>
<BR><B>will happen out of the blue.&nbsp; I think they are harmless.&nbsp;
In fact, they've</B>
<BR><B>even warned me when my dinner was burning....&nbsp; I kind of like
having them</B>
<BR><B>around.</B>

<BR><B>Australia Haunt</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tassierose@iprimus.com.au</B><B></B>

<P><B>We lived in an old farm house outside the town of Bordertown in South
Australia.&nbsp; At the time my husband and I only had two children then&nbsp;
they were aged about 9 and 6 at the time.</B>
<BR><B>The farm house was probably about 80 years old and we rented it
from the farmer on the property.&nbsp; As soon as we moved in strange things
started to happen in the middle of the night my husband and I would both
hear a baby crying and sometimes we would wake up to the sound of two people
in the kitchen and it sounded as if one of them was pounding bread dough
and you could hear a muffled discussion.&nbsp; We had an outside toilet
in the backyard and sometimes when we went in the middle of the night both
my husband and I at times heard the sound of coaches coming up the drive.</B>
<BR><B>What was interesting was that we spoke to the owner we found out
he had a baby brother that died not long after birth and was buried in
the local cemetery in an unmarked grave.&nbsp; My husband and I investigated
and went to the council and they gave us a map of the cemetery plus old
records so we were able to locate the grave so we both went there and put
flowers on the grave and the babies crying stopped.&nbsp; I truly believe
the baby just want recognition that it was once alive.</B>
<BR><B>Other things happened during our stay sometimes I could hear old
fashion music at night and one day I came home after shopping a felt a
warm breeze on my face like someone blowing on it no windows were open
and it was in the middle of winter.&nbsp; All in all eventhough it was
an unusual experience we never felt threatened.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Comfort even in Death</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: j_litke@iwantyou2.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>The following story is not so much an actual ghost encounter, but
more of an encounter with the spiritual realm.&nbsp; About seven years
ago, two very dear members of my husband's family became very ill, and
within a week of each other passed away.&nbsp; Great Grandma and Karen,
her grand-daughter, were very dear to everyone in the family and were very
dear to each other.</B>
<BR><B>Karen had become very ill from her diabetes that had plagued her
all of her life.&nbsp; One night as she lay sleeping, a blood clot in her
head ruptured and left her in a coma.&nbsp; She was rushed to hospital
where she was treated in intensive care.&nbsp; She was visited by many
people that week, and it was only days of her being admitted to hospital
that she passed away.&nbsp; Great Grandma was in the same hospital, and
she too was close to death.&nbsp; Because no one wanted to upset her in
her final few days no one told her about Karen's death.&nbsp; Everyone
attended Karen's funeral, and then the family continued to visit Great
Grandma until finally the day came when she took a turn to for the worst.&nbsp;
She looked over to the one side of the room and was apparently talking
to Karen.&nbsp; She had made mention of how good she looked and that she
was so happy.&nbsp; It was that day that Great Grandma passed.</B>
<BR><B>That same year was the year that my husband and I got married.&nbsp;
In an effort to help us out, my husband's grandfather renovated Great Grandma's
house so that we could live there after we were married.&nbsp; While we
were moving in, I was taking boxes up the stairs and out of the corner
of my eye I saw an older woman walking through the halls.&nbsp; (Everyone
laughed at me).</B>
<BR><B>Just two years ago, a psychic was invited into Great Grandma's house.&nbsp;
She was a stranger who knew nothing of the history of our family.&nbsp;
She sensed the presence of two women, who were very close to each other
livng in the house.</B>
<BR><B>Finally, just this past year, another dear member of my husbands
family passed away.&nbsp; This time it was Great Grandma's youngest daughter.&nbsp;
She was young still and what we remember was that no one expected her to
pass when she did.&nbsp; She had been ill for a very long time, but she
had been getting better and stronger and her death had come as quite a
shock.&nbsp; The days before she passed, she communicated with Grandma
(Karen's mother) that she had dreamed about Karen and that she looked good
and happy.&nbsp; And then suddenly, she died.</B>
<BR><B>It is of great comfort to us to know that Great Grandma and Karen
are close to us and living peacefully in the house that carried so much
joy for this whole big family of ours.&nbsp; I know that they are at peace
and I know that when my time comes, Karen will be there to guide me on
to the next life.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Dad Survived</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>This story is about an amazing event that happened to my Dad several
years ago.&nbsp; He was working in a chemical manufacturing plant early
on a cold December morning, when a large explosion occurred.&nbsp; Several
men were killed and many more were wounded, including my Dad.&nbsp; He
had been on a 2nd story catwalk when the explosion happened but was knocked
down to the first level.&nbsp; The explosion ruptured an ammonia storage
tank which caused the fumes to flood the entire area.&nbsp; Imagine taking
a whiff of household cleaning liquid. You know how that takes your breath
away, and that is watered down product.&nbsp; The ammonia in this tank
is full strength and will kill you by burning your airways. This stuff
would drop most people to their knees gagging at the first whiff. My Dad
had worked at the plant for 30 years and was accustomed to breathing this
ammonia.&nbsp; This actually made it possible for him to survive longer
than most people.&nbsp; He tried to find his way out of the plant but due
to the darkness, the debris in the air, and lack of oxygen, he was disoriented
and didn't know which way to go. He tried crawling, but kept running into
dead ends.&nbsp; He told me later that he was on the verge of giving up
when he called out," God, you brought me through the explosion for a reason,
don't let me die now."&nbsp;&nbsp; At that point, he saw a bright light
about the size of a small flashlight coming towards him out of the darkness.&nbsp;
A voice spoke to him and he immediately recognized it as his Father, who
had died 14 years earlier.&nbsp; His Father said to him" Son, you have
to keep moving, you can't stop as it isn't your time yet."&nbsp; Dad said"
I'm trying but I can't see."&nbsp; His Father told him" follow me, I'll
lead you out.&nbsp; Now get off your butt and keep moving!&nbsp;&nbsp;
The light started moving slowly and Dad crawled on his belly trying to
follow.&nbsp; Many times he would stop from lack of oxygen and exhaustion
but his Father would keep him moving by yelling at him.&nbsp; After 54
minutes of breathing in fumes that should have killed him in 5 minutes,
Dad made it to the front gate and help from the Rescue teams.&nbsp; Dad
said that right as he saw the lights of the rescue vehicles, the small
light he had been following disappeared.&nbsp; He was rushed to the hospital
where he spent several days on a respirator and his lungs have been permanently
scarred by the ammonia.&nbsp; This forced him to retire.&nbsp; Everyone
told Dad what a miracle it was for him to have survived, but he was reluctant
to tell anyone how he got out of there as he didn't think anyone would
believe him.&nbsp; Even now he keeps this a secret except for his family.&nbsp;
That is why I have requested this to be anonymous.</B>
<BR><B>For those skeptics out there that say this was a delusion caused
from oxygen deprivation, I submit the following:</B>
<BR><B>My uncle worked at the chemical plant as well.&nbsp; When he arrived
on the scene shortly after daylight, he went in to help search.&nbsp; He
found my Dad's tracks in the snow from where he had crawled.&nbsp; He followed
his tracks from start to finish and couldn't believe what he saw.&nbsp;
It was not a straight path.&nbsp; In fact, it was just about as crooked
as could be.&nbsp; But it was the only path for him to have crawled out
with and survived.&nbsp; Remember I said this was a chemical plant.&nbsp;
The tanks had been ruptured and there were pools of acid all over the ground.&nbsp;
Dad's trail skirted around all of these pools, coming within inches on
both sides of him.&nbsp; In fact, my Uncle said he had trouble navigating
the trail in broad daylight and staying out of the pools.&nbsp; Later in
the hospital, my Uncle asked him how he was able to see these pools of
acid in the darkness.&nbsp; Dad's reply was, "What pools?"</B><B></B>

<P><B>End of their Journey</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi There! I would like to share a rather strange tale that happened
to and my friend...back in the early 1980's. We loved to hike at the Harriman
State Park... which is located in Upper New York State near the New Jersey
border. The tale happened during one of our hikes. We hiked up to one of
our favorite sites...which was located on top of a hill. It was late autumn
and all of the leaves had fallen. This allowed us a clear view of the surrounding
hilly area. We were sitting around and talking. I was looking across the
hill...enjoying the view. Suddenly, I noticed movement across and I tried
to look more carefully...I couldn't believe what I saw....It seem to look
like there were several people on horseback moving down a trail....They
looked like Indians...about three men and a woman...I remember that the
woman was wearing some kind of shawl...They were moving very slowly and
carefully....It just seemed to go on forever...I&nbsp; turned around and
noticed that my friend was looking at the same senerio...We sat there with
our mouths open....The people didn't look to be solid...wispy and sepia
colored....like they were faded looking...The funny thing was that we weren't
scared...we just sat there in awe....Maybe because they were some distance
from us...We watched them as they traveled down the hill.We watched until
the whole thing faded out. What can I say? Noone was in the park near us.....and
certainly noone with horses....and the clothes that they were wearing came
from some other era....We were happy and excited that we were shown an
extaordinary sight. The only emotion that we felt emanated from them was
one of sadness and longing.....Our only hope at the time was that those
weary ghostly travelers found some peace and rest....at the end of their
journey....Thank you for listening to my tale....</B><B></B>

<P><B>Freaked Out</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: PunkAsh17@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I wrote the story about the abandoned house in Evansville, IN. Where
my boyfriend and his friends explored and got scared to death. Well, me
and 3 of my friends decided to go check it out and see if anything happened.
We get there and all the windows were busted and the doors were completely
off. We walked around the house first and looked at the condition of the
house. The house is in bad shape and looks like it would fall apart anytime.
Well, we went inside and saw all the dishes and stuff that was left behind.
We checked out the main floor first. Nothing happened there. But we could
tell that people had been there lately cause there were beer bottles and
medicine bottles everywhere. Then we went upstairs and started checking
out every room. The first room we looked at had a bunch of stuff in it.
We wanted to find out the year that they left. We found a magazine that
had the year 1979. We looked around the room and there was old pictures
and suitcases, a shelf and a lot of stuff. We went into the room next to
it and there wasn't anything in there. We went to the room down the hall
where my boyfriend checked out first. Really nothing in there but old pictures.
While we were in there it got really cold. Colder than it was outside.
We went into the room where my boyfriend checked out where he freaked out.
The door was still shut and still wouldn't open. We had to kick the door
in just so we could get in. I started to freak out cause of what he told
me. I had someone stand by the door so it wouldn't slam shut. At that point
I wanted to leave. They wanted to keep exploring the house cause they wanted
to get it all on video tape. We started to walk down the stairs when I
look up and saw someone had wrote get out. Then we all went downstairs
and saw the busted light bulb and the hole in the ground. I saw the cellar
door start to move and I was outta there. I ran to my car and was out there
for a little bit when one of my friends came out to see if I was okay.
Well, we went and checked out the barn. Nothing really to see cause it
was caving in. We started to walk around and we saw an old tractor under
a fallen tree. Well, being stupid idiots that we are we decided it would
be fun to stay the night. We stayed in the living room where the matresses
were. I didn't want to fall asleep cause I was scared something would happen.
Eventually I started to doze off. That was a big mistake. I woke up cause
one of my friends shook me. I looked at her and she told me to be quiet
and listen. I started to hear footsteps comin down the stairs. I grabbed
a hold of her arm and would NOT let go. Next we heard a loud bang on one
of the walls. My other 2 friends woke up really quick. We heard more footsteps
and more banging on the walls. We all looked at each other and ran out
of there. I refuse to go back in that house. I wont even drive by it that's
how freaked out I was.</B>

<BR><B>Ghost In The Cellar (The Old Hospital)</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: andrew.howell@whsmithnet.co.uk</B>
<BR><B>This story isn't really about me. My friend's sister's flat (apartment)
is in an old hospital. As she is on the ground floor she has a cellar underneath
her flat. I dont know what the cellars were used for. Anyway, my friend's
sister has a 3 year old daughter who liked to play with her dolls in the
cellar. One day while I was there we were all in the living room just talking
when we heard Alisha (her daughter) running as fast as she could up the
steep cellar steps. We all got up and went to see what was wrong, thinking
she had seen a huge spider or something. She was as white as a sheet and
when her mom picked her up she started to cry softly. When she'd calmed
down a bit she managed to say in her little 3 year old language that a
police lady was sitting there watching her play!!! (She knows the uniform
from a UK TV series called "Balamory"). We all rushed down there wondering
why a police woman would be down there watching her. It's not usually cold
down there as there is a large boiler that heats her flat and the next,
but as we got to the third step a wave of freezing cold air hit us and
we started to shiver. As we searched around we found Alisha's dolls had
been put away neatly (she usually leaves them strewn across the room) and
we could see our breath in the air. There was a distinct smell of perfume.
Alisha refused bluntly to go down there again and wouldn't touch her dolls
for weeks!!! We couldnt see anything but it freaked us all out and we all
got the feeling that someone was watching us.</B>
<BR><B>After this we all got talking and on a previous occasion my friend's
sister was asleep when she heard Alisha crying and when she went into her
room Alisha was fast asleep. When she turned to go out of the door the
crying started again and when she turned back to Alisha she was sat bolt
upright looking at a corner in her room. My friend's sister just grabbed
her and ran out of the room. Nothing like that has happened again. It's
already scary because it's an old hospital, but after that previous incident
they never used that room again.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Grim Reaper</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Ancientwarrior04@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>On May 7, 2002, I was working as a graphic designer for TNT Fireworks.
My computer sat in the curve of the desk where one side of the desk faced
the wall and the other side faced the copy machine. I was making copies,
my back to my desk, which was nothing unusual. For some reason I turned
toward my desk and saw the grim reaper (without sickle) sitting in my chair.
He was looking at me and smiling. Chills ran through my body and I was
terrified. I am used to ghost sightings and things like that, but I had
never experienced anything like this. I walked outside to regain my composure.
After work, I called everyone to see if they were okay. Turns out, nothing
out of the ordinary had happened to anyone else and everyone seemed to
be in good health. I just could not shake the vision of the reaper. Three
days after the sighting (May 10, 2002) my cousin's two best friends died
in a one car wreck. My cousin was supposed to have been with them, but
was delayed and told them he would meet them at a party later that night.
I will never forget the day I saw the grim reaper, and I hope never to
see anything like that again. Since then, I have survived many people who
were close to me, including my son dying. I have yet to see the grim reaper
again.</B>

<P><B>Godfather's Pizza, Story City.</B>
<BR><B>1625 E. Broad</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: du_hast_mich13@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have heard this story many times, living in Story City for 13 years
I guess these stories just circulate.&nbsp; This was how it was told to
me by a man named Alan, who used to be a manager there.</B>
<BR><B>These occurances took place at Godfathers Pizza in Story City. I
worked there 1993 to 1995. I was the daytime kitchen manager. Strange happenings:
Lights being turned off and on in the restroom when nobody was in there.
Mops and brooms being knocked over. I would set them up again, and the
second I turned around they would go down again. I would even prop them
back up so they couldn't fall over on their own. At least once furniture
got moved. And in the kitchen I found cold spots. These would show up near
the pizza oven as it was going full blast. There weren't any drafts in
the kitchen. And for me the biggest occurance was when I saw the ghost.
I was putting pizzas in a holding cooler when I saw the reflection of a
man in the glass door. I watched it for about 10 to 15 seconds. When I
turned around he was gone. He looked to be in his early to mid 40's. We
was wearing a short sleeved dress type shirt and tie. I noticed that from
the waist down he was a foggy blur. There were only two of us in the store
at the time. I turned around to see if the gentleman needed any help, when
I realized that both doors to the resturant were locked. This location
used to be a truck stop and cafe. After this sighting I was talking to
a lady who used to be a waitress there in the 1970's. She told me that
a salesman came in off the interstate and went into the restroom. He didn't
come out. He had a heartattack and died."</B>
<BR><B>Also when you were there, mostly when you were in the reservation-only
party room, you felt like you were being watched.&nbsp; There was also
a couple of cold spots in the dining area.</B>

<BR><B>Lewis &amp; Clark Community College Ghost - Godfrey, IL</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: lckystr81@hotmail.co</B><B></B>

<P><B>Godfrey, IL - Lewis &amp; Clark Community College</B>
<BR><B>A few years back I was attending Lewis &amp; Clark and was an employee
of the school newspaper. One evening a friend and I were staying over trying
to get the issue done before the next days print date. We were sitting
in the newspaper office, which at that time was on the 3rd floor of the
Main building, when my friend decided to go downstairs and get us a couple
of sodas. While she was gone I heard something in the connecting office
and felt a breeze come through the cubby hole between the two offices,
so I decided to check and make sure the window was closed. When I opened
the door the window was closed and everything looked to be in the same
place as it was earlier that day. So I just figured I was hearing things
as usual. When my friend came back I told her what had happened and she
just laughed at me. Later on that same night we decided to go down to the
second floor and use the restroom next to the Library since there isn't
a restroom on the 3rd floor by our office. When I finished I went out in
the hall and got a drink of water from the fountain then leaned up against
the wall while waiting for her. When she came out of the bathroom she kept
staring passed me towards the library. When I looked there was a white
figure moving in the library and then the automatic doors (which get turned
off every night when they close the library) opened. We both took off running
upstairs grabbed our stuff and ran all the way down to the parking lot
and left. After that night we never worked at night unless there was a
large group of people with us.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Margaret</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mtetford@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Hello. My name is Marlene and I am 32 years old. I live in a part
of Montreal, Quebec., Canada called Lasalle. I live in an apartment with
my husband, my son Mark, my daughter Hannah, and our cat Wimzie. We moved
to this apartment when my daughter was 6 months old. My daughter was born
December 31st, 1997. I had my son February 11th, 2000 and we have had our
cat since October 3rd, 1999. Anyway, the building we live in has 3 floors
and an elevator. We live on the 3rd floor.</B>
<BR><B>Margaret didn't make herself known until around 2001. I should probaby
mention how I know her name is Margaret,etc. Well, I am friends with a
woman named Ang who goes to shadowlands.net(that's how we started chatting)and
Ang is what is called a sensitive. She told me our apartment is haunted
and that the ghost's name is Margaret and that Margaret died here in a
fire. Margaret is thankfully a good ghost, not an evil one.</B>
<BR><B>When Margaret first made herself known, she did it by causing my
leg to feel cold and wet. I was lieing in bed reading and all of a sudden
my leg felt cold and wet. It was not cold in the bedroom nor anywhere else
in the house. As for wet, I was not sweating or anything like that.</B>
<BR><B>The next time something happened, we were all sitting in the kitchen
eating lunch when all of a sudden, an empty container that was on the counter,
fell on the floor all by itself, it was as if it had been pushed off the
counter. Neither I or anyone else was anywhere near the container nor that
part of the kitchen, and our cat was nowhere near there.</B>
<BR><B>Other things have happened since then, which I will tell you about.
I don't remember in what order the events occured, except for the last
one. As is typical for some ghosts, Margaret likes to take things and hide
them. She always gives back whatever she takes though. So far, she has
taken the carrot peeler, and my daughter's white slippers.</B>
<BR><B>One thing happened that was really creepy. It was the middle of
the night and I heard my son calling to me saying he wanted water. So I
went to the kitchen and got him water and then went to give it to him.
Well, while he was drinking the water, it was as if he was in a trance
or something. He kept looking in my direction but not at me. His demeanor,
etc., never changed the whole time he was drinking. Then, when he finished
drinking, it was if he had been daydreaming or something, he just snapped
out of it, just like that. That really creeped me out.</B>
<BR><B>Something else that happened is that one day I was home alone and
I was in the bathroom and all of a sudden the light in the living room
went on and off. Just like that. Just once. As if someone turned it on
and off.</B>
<BR><B>I saw Margaret once. I was in the bedroom (my husband's and mine)and
I was doing something(I think I was looking for something, I don't remember
now) and I was standing near my side of the bed and all of a sudden out
of the corner of my eye, I saw something white go by really fast. I saw
it go by where the wall is. I instantly knew it was Margaret.</B>
<BR><B>There is one other thing that happened. One day, I was in the living
room and I heard a noise, like something falling on the floor, coming from
the bedroom. So, I went to look, and the globe that we keep on the dresser
was on the floor. The cat was with me when I heard the noise and so were
the kids and my husband.</B>
<BR><B>That is all that has happened so far. Oh, one more thing...Ang thinks
there maybe a vortex in the bedroom that ang uses to come here and go whereever
it is that she goes when she is not here. The reason Ang thinks this is
because of something that happened to me not that long ago. I was asleep
and I went to change positions and all of a sudden I was awake(but still
sleepy) and I happened to look at the wall where the window is and I saw
what appeared to be a hole. It was shaped like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle
sort of and it was as big as about 4 or 5 times the size of a fist. It
wasn't too deep. Anyway, I thought to myself, I should tell Saeed(that's
my husband) about the hole so he can fix it. I was going to go and tell
him, but for some reason I could move and I couldn't stop looking at the
hole in the wall. It was as if I was in a trance or something. Finally,
after about maybe 1 or 2 minutes, I just went back to sleep. Weird huh?</B>
<BR><B>Well, that is my story. I wish I could find out the history of the
building I live in and also the land it is on, but I have no idea where
to start.</B>
<BR><B>P.S. According to Ang, the building we live in is haunted as well.</B>
<BR><B>P.S.S. I love the shadowlands. Keep up the great work! :)</B><B></B>

<P><B>Never Again</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: PunkAsh17@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>This didn't happen to me but it happened to my boyfriend and 2 of
his friends. There is this abandoned house out in the country that is supposed
to be haunted.&nbsp; All windows were busted out, the doors were taken
off the hinges. The family that lived there left everything behind. There
were broken dishes in the sink, an old shower curtain in the bathroom,
matresses everywhere, chairs, everything you can think of. The way they
had to get into the house was to swing on this rope into a window, cause
at the time all the doors were boarded up. They get in and Joe (one of
my boyfriends friend) decided they all should split up and check out the
house. Chris (my boyfriend) was to take the upstairs, Zach (their other
friend) was to take the basement, and Joe was to take the main floor. Chris
got to the top of the stairs and there were 4 rooms. He went to the last
room down the hall first. While he was in there he started to hear noises
in the next room. Being curious as he is, he went in there. There was a
closet shut, a rocking chair, and a matress. Well, all of a sudden the
door to the room slammed shut. He started to freak out cause the closet
door started to open and the rocking chair started to move. He ran to the
door and it wouldn't even open. The door didn't have a lock so there was
no reason why it wouldn't open. While he was pullin on the door knob to
open the door, he heard scratching noises outside the door. He got so freaked
out that he jumped out of the window which was a 12 ft drop to the ground.
He ran to his car and yelled for his friends to get out of there. All of
a sudden he saw the cellar doors fly open and Zach came running out. He
was covered in dirt. Then Joe came out and didn't look afraid at all. They
got in the car and took off. Joe asked them what happened but they wouldn't
say anything till they got down the road. Zach asked Chris what happened
to him and he told him. Then Joe told him that when he got downstairs he
turned on a light and half of the light bulb shattered. After that he heard
someone talking and he thought it was either Joe or Chris. When he asked
if it was them no one answered. He started walking around again and fell
through a 2 ft hole which caused him to get dirt all over him. After that
he heard someone yell to get out and that's when he ran out. Nothing happened
to Joe and didn't believe them. They said they would take him back and
make him go in alone. He said it was fine and he believed them. They never
stepped foot in that house again.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Quinton</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ftwangel1962@sbcglobal.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I lived in a house in Quinton from 1976 - 79 where from time to time,
especially if it were raining, you would hear voices, laughing, and music,
as if a dinner party or something going on.&nbsp; My mother would often
think someone had left the television on, think to go to turn it off when
she had finished the breakfast dishes and then a few minutes later, there
would be no noise.&nbsp; We also heard this same type of noise when we
coming home from shopping or whatever, then when we approached the front
door, there would suddenly be silence.&nbsp; There were two ghosts actually
seen one of an older man, always wearing a black suit and derby type hat.&nbsp;
We later found out that the owner of the house back in the '20's was a
banker and had been found dead outside of town near railroad tracks...Cause
of death listed as suicide, but most thought that was not really the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The other was that of a woman.&nbsp; as i came in from school one day I
approached the door, and looked into the window and there she was, wearing
a long orange dress, talking on the phone....The next day at school, my
friend said she tried to call me about 20 minutes after school was out,
but the line was busy.&nbsp; (there was no one home!)</B>

<P><B>Several Personal Hauntings</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:basketball43@wononline.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Thank you for writing back to me. I really appreciate you taking
the time to read my message and respond to it. I would love for my stories
to be included on your website, but I'm not sure how much they all really
tie in with each other and I'm not sure if some of it is just possibly
my imagination. So I'll type out the different stories that I have and
let you decide what you think of them and if you think that they could
be something, feel free to include them on your website! I'll apologize
now if this email is quite long in length.</B>
<BR><B>My first story: When I was younger, about four or five years old,
I used to sit on our kitchen floor playing with little Matchbox cars while
my mom was talking on the phone. I remember quite a few times I would be
very content, sitting there playing with my cars, then all of a sudden
something would feel...wrong and out of place. My mom's voice would sound
kind of far away, like I was sleeping in my room and just hearing her voice
come back the hallway to my room from the kitchen. I would slightly glance
up from my spot on the floor and look out to the little entrance way from
our kitchen to the living room and stairs to the basement to see a dark
gray, hazy blob zip past me. I never felt physically threatened by this
thing, but I always felt as if it shouldn't be there and that something
was very wrong by its presence. I stopped seeing it when I was about six
years old and I never saw it since then, so I never thought much of it.
Then a few days ago I mentioned it to a friend of mine during a lengthy
talk about ghosts and haunted places, and she got somewhat concerned and
said that she's heard stories of things called "Shadowmen." I remember
vaguely hearing about "Shadowmen" before, but I don't recall anything about
them. What do you think it was that I was seeing, if anything?</B>
<BR><B>My second story: I'm not sure if there's anything to this story
I'm about to tell you, but I'd like to have your opinion on it. Rumor has
it that there are many Indian burial grounds near the area I live in; my
neighbor thinks that her house is haunted and many of my friends have also
had strange and unusual things happen in their homes. Ever since I was
about twelve or thirteen, I have thought that there's something a little
unusual about the land I live on; the reason I say about the land is because
my parents built our house about twenty years ago, and we're the first
family to live in it, so I think that if it's haunted around here, it's
most likely the area and not my home. I don't notice things all that much
while one of both of my parents are here or if I have a friend over; I
notice them more when I'm by myself, probably because I have no one else
to pay attention to, so I'm more alert to things that seem a bit odd. When
I'm home alone, I sometimes (not all the time, but pretty frequently- I'd
say about 45-50% of the time when I'm home alone) hear noises that make
me sit up and think, "What in the world was that?!" Most of the time after
I hear them, I realize that it was just something normal, like the wind
blowing against our house or the water conditioner starting to run. However,
there have been some noises that I just can't find an answer for. I remember
one time a few years ago when I was home alone that I heard footsteps in
our attic. Since I was home alone, I knew that there was nobody up there.
Even if someone would have been home with me, I would have known that nobody
was up there; there is no way to get up to our attic, no stairs or anything,
and even if you could get to our attic, there's no way that you could stand
up and walk around because it's very close to the roof. Then I heard something
walking down a set of stairs, which doesn't sound all that odd. However,
I was on the top floor of our house, so whatever I was hearing was walking
down a set of stairs that just didn't exist. Also, a lot of the time when
I'm home alone and not really paying attention to the television, the radio,
or talking on the phone, I get that creepy feeling that something or someone
is staring at me and is in the room with me. I've never ever felt physically
threatened and I've never felt any violence or anger towards myself, but
I just feel uneasy because I can't see anything. I also remember a few
weeks ago, I was home alone and downstairs in our basement (it's half finished
and I have my radio and a book shelf and some furniture down there) talking
on the phone, and it sounded like someone was walking around upstairs.
There's a spot on our floor that creaks every time someone steps on it
and I heard that exact spot creak while I was downstairs. I thought that
it was probably my cat running around, but when I stood up to go see, I
found my cat sleeping by the stairs. I'm not sure if I was just overreacting
to things, but I seriously felt like I wasn't alone.</B>
<BR><B>My third story: Over the summer I had something extremely weird
happen to me. I don't remember any exact dates, but I do remember that
this happened over about a two week period in late June/early July. One
night I was laying in my room watching TV and I heard a car go by and start
beeping the horn like crazy. I didn't think anything of it, just for the
fact that people go by and beep at our house all the time; my uncle does
on his way home from closing his store that's down the road, my friends
all beep at my house, and sometimes people will beep at any deer that decide
to walk across the road. So I just shrugged it off and went back to watching
my program. Then, the next night, I was laying in my bed watching the same
program on TV, when the same thing happened again. This time I thought
it was a little weird, and when I looked at my clock, the time said 2:45
AM. I raised my eyebrows and once again went back to watching my program.
Guess what? Yup, the same thing happened the next night as well. This time
I looked at my clock right away, and the time again said 2:45. I thought
things were definitely getting weird at this point. The next morning I
called my mom at work, and I asked her if she'd heard a car go by beeping
around three in the morning, but she said she didn't hear anything. So
I just shrugged it off and didn't think any more of it. Then...the next
night I was in bed once again, this time reading, and a car goes by beeping
at 2:45 yet again. This time, I heard the car slam on the brakes and I
heard two car doors open. About thirty seconds later, both car doors shut
and the car sped off. I was definitely starting to get a little creeped
out by this time. I started to think that maybe it was some of my friends
playing a prank on me, but I knew that any of my friends would have told
me by that time. The next night I decided to do something. I sat in my
room at about 2:30, turned all of the lights off, and decided to watch
out my window to see if I could see anything. (My room faces the road.)
At 2:45 nothing happened, and I soon decided to lay down and go to sleep.
I was just about ready to fall asleep when the car drove by and beeped
again. This time I sat up in my bed and noticed something rather strange;
I didn't see any reflections of headlights coming into my room. When a
car drives by, you can see some of the lights from their headlights coming
into my room, but this time I didn't see any. I was extremely creeped out
by that time. However, nothing happened for the next few nights, so I just
tried to forget about it and finally get a good night's sleep. Then, at
about the end of the following week, the car returned. At 2:45 I heard
a car slam on the brakes outside of my house, and I heard three car doors
open and shut. Then I heard what sounded to be a pretty violent struggle
between a girl and someone else. The girl was repeatedly yelling, "No,
stop! Don't hurt me! Stop, please stop! Leave me alone!" I thought that
something bad was really happening, but I was too scared to get up and
look out the window. Then something else very strange happened. One second
the voice sounded like it was coming from out on the road, the next second
it sounded like it was right under my window, and seconds later it sounded
like it was coming from across the road, kind of far away from my house.
This went on for about five minutes, and I finally sat up and whispered,
"Please just stop this nonsense!" and I heard three car doors open and
shut, and I heard a car speed off into the night. Nothing happened after
that. I told my one friend about it, and he said that possibly some girl
really was being attacked, and I agreed; but nothing was ever on the news
about it and deep in the back of my mind, I really didn't think that's
what happened. I asked my parents if they heard anything going on at all,
but they both said they'd heard nothing. Around Halloween at cheerleading
practice, we were sitting there talking about haunted houses, the fake
ones and actual ones. My neighbor brought up the fact that she thinks the
land around here is haunted, and I told her what I just wrote to you. She
said that she never heard anything, and that she would have called us right
then and there that night if she thought something had happened. Til this
day, I honestly don't know what went on for those two weeks this past summer.</B>
<BR><B>I do have another story that I'd like to share, but I'm pressed
for time at the moment. If you'd like to hear that one, I'd be more than
happy to send it to you</B>

<BR><B>The Devils Backbone Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:ibanez1974@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was born and raised in the Gas City area. If you leave Gas City,
headed to the east on Hwy.22, you will run directly into a cross road.
This is 500.Turning right will take you south to another cross road named,
Wheeling Pike. If you continue south, in aprox.4/ 10, of a mile, on your
right hand side, covered by trees and plant growth, you will see a large
pond.The name of this pond is, Galatia Lake. This is where many old box
cars were thrown in, in the attempt to construct a foundation for a railroad
crossing. The box cars could not be found. Divers were sent down to acess
the situation. To their amazment, there appeared to be no "true" bottom.
Silt so dense that the divers could not see. Samples where taken of the
lakes silt matter. Years later in about 1957, a skeleton was found by the
farmer who owned the lakes property. This skeleton was quite unusual, in
that it was an almost perfectly preserved skeleton of a mastodon. The farmer,
being a simple man and not understanding the value of this find, sold the
mastadon to the Smithsonien Instatute for $1000. There were in earlier
years, mounds that were found in this area. These mounds were built as
ceremony spots by a prehistoric tribe of indians known as, the mound builders.
In one of these mounds near Upland, there was a human skeleton that measured
OVER 9 ft. tall. One other intresting tid- bit you might be interested
in, is that the court house in Marion is sitting on what was a very large
mound. The mound was excavated to plant the court house, and many other
skeletons of grand highth were found. But, back to the lake. The Lake Galatia,
according to geologists, had a 99 mile shoreline, and was left here from
the the glaciers melting from the ice age. As you could see today the lake
is no more than a medium- sized pond. But there is much history to the
area. Now, the other place of intrest, Devils Backbone. This is one place
I know all too well. Devils Backbone, as it's named, is actually called
Reade Road, and extends out of Upland. I have not personnaly ran into any
ghostly appearences, but, it would not suprise me if someone has, or soon
will. This road has claimed many lives. Due to two large dips in the road.
Dips don't do it any justice, you would have to experience it yourself.
But I can tell you from my experience when I was riding shot- gun in my
friends 74 Scottsdale. We hit a speed of 115 mph, launching ourselves into
the air, and landing at the T in the road in one hell of a crash! We had
4 other friends of ours in the back, and we all lived through it. That
was AMAZING! It was as if the old road was tired of the blood. This has
been a common spot for years for this sort of racing down the Devils Backbone.
Most never as lucky as us. But there has been stories of people walking
along the road and dissappearing. I guess they may be looking for lost
articles from their crash. Most who had died were young cats, much like
myself at the time. I was 17 then. But Upland would be the actual location
of the infamous Backbone.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;Cross house ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: kittyclou@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>On mothers day 2003, I went to the cross house which is in Calgary,
Alberta, Canada. There where people who had died inside. There was a mom,dad
and a 4 year old girl named Amelia and a baby boy named Edward. All this
occured about 200 years ago.</B>
<BR><B>The mother had died giving birth to her son only to be followed
soon after by the death of her loving husband.</B>
<BR><B>A year later, Edward and his sister both received diptheria and
both passed away aswell.</B>
<BR><B>All there bodies are now burried behind the Cross House.</B>
<BR><B>The Cross house is now a family restaurant.</B>
<BR><B>When I was looking for the bathroom I came across a picture of the
family and like any other 8-year-old, was curious.</B>
<BR><B>My mom informed me that Amelia adored daning infront of the fireplace
which was situated down the hall from the eating area.</B>
<BR><B>Still trying to find the bathroom, I heard a startling noise. Tracing
the noice, I found the room which I guessed the noise was comming from.
The room which was once apon a time Edwards. Reluctantly, I looked inside.</B>
<BR><B>There, in the corner of the room, I saw an empty cradle rocking.</B>
<BR><B>I approached the fireplace to see if the was a picture of his beloved
sister there. Instead, in the deserted room, I felt a sift movement rub
against my shoulder.</B>
<BR><B>I tured around but no one was there.</B>
<BR><B>Concerned, I went to my parents who didnt believe me so as any concerned
coustomer would, I went to the manager to see if the had been any previous
complaints.</B>
<BR><B>Infact, there had been over five preceding this encounter.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Christmas Tree</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: kaylajs@comcast.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>This happened to me about four years ago, and yet the thought of
it</B>
<BR><B>still scares me.</B>
<BR><B>I was sitting on my recliner, which faces the spot we always put
our</B>
<BR><B>Christmas tree.&nbsp; It was the night we had first bought and decorated
it.</B>
<BR><B>I was staring at the lights and ornaments, thinking how pretty they</B>
<BR><B>were, when I saw something move at the top of the tree.&nbsp; When
I looked</B>
<BR><B>up, it didn't seem like anything was wrong, but then I realized
that the</B>
<BR><B>angel was facing the wrong way.&nbsp; Because I was skeptical about
ghosts, I</B>
<BR><B>returned it to its proper position facing forward, then went to
fetch a</B>
<BR><B>book to read upstairs.&nbsp; When I came back down, to my horror,
the angel</B>
<BR><B>was facing backwards again.</B>
<BR><B>I fixed it, then began reading my book at the computer desk.&nbsp;
Suddenly,</B>
<BR><B>ten minutes later, there was a loud "CRASH!" from the tree.&nbsp;
Running to</B>
<BR><B>it, I saw the angel had fallen, and the lights were out.&nbsp; No
one else</B>
<BR><B>was in the living room at any time the angel moved!</B><B></B>

my stepdad and i didnt get along at all.&nbsp; we were always fighting.
any way my mother was the only person who could calm me down after an argument
with my stepdad.&nbsp; well my mother died in 1996. i moved out of the
house and i didnt go back to visit for about six months.&nbsp; when i did
go back of course my step dad and i got into a big argument and i left
the house crying and hysterical.&nbsp; well on my way home i was just so
upset i was all over the road and all of a sudden i felt a sensation in
the car with me.&nbsp; it was as if a calming mist had filled my car. i
stopped crying and was very calm after that.&nbsp; i kept sensing someone
saying calm down... everything will be alright.&nbsp; almost as if my mother
was there giving me a hug and telling me not to cry.&nbsp; the feeling
was undescribable.&nbsp; i dont know if i had an experience with my dead

<P><B>My Stories of Haunts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: GBueckendorf@magellanhealth.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I just found this site this pm and read some of the stories and looked
at some of the photos and found them very interesting.&nbsp; Here are three
stories I would like to share.&nbsp; First, this one would have happened
in 1986 when I was living in the downstairs apartment of a two family flat
that was about 100 yrs old in St. Louis, and my grandmother lived upstairs.&nbsp;
My uncle had died a year of so before in the exact bed in which I slept.&nbsp;
He also died in the apartment in which I was now not living.&nbsp; I lived
with my dog and 2 cats.&nbsp; The evening in question I came into the apartment
to gather my animals and pack an overnight bag b/c I was supposed to stay
at my parents to watch their house.&nbsp; I packed the overnight bag got
the animals, put them in the car and then noticed that I couldn't find
my keys.&nbsp; I had just used my keys minutes before to open the door,
so I knew they had to be in the room where I was staying (the rest of the
apartment was being restored so I was living in the spacious kitchen w/the
bathroom off the room and my bed in the corner), or they were on the walkway
to the car or in the car. I didn't panic and knew that I would find the
keys b/c they had to be somewhere, right?&nbsp; Wrong.&nbsp; I looked everywhere,
including (I got this desperate) the litter box, in case the fell in and
the cat scratched over them, I felt my dogs stomach in case he ate them,
and opened and repacked my overnight bag 3 times.&nbsp; I stubbornly was
refusing to give up but eventually I fell on my bed exhausted and fell
asleep crying w/frustration.&nbsp; The next morning I woke up early and
to my surprise, the keys were laying on top of the overnight bag that I
packed and unpacked 3 times which was sitting right next to where I was
sleeping.&nbsp; I am a very light sleeper and did not hear a sound.&nbsp;
My grandma is old and elderly and would have no reason to pull a stunt
like that and besides, she goes to bed very early and this all was taking
place b/w 11pm and 2:30pm when I finally fell off to sleep.&nbsp; I felt
it was either my the spirit of my Uncle Larry (a real prankster) or some
other spirit.&nbsp; I promised myself I would never selectively forget
this story b/c I couldn't explain it away.&nbsp; Thanks for giving the
opportunity for sharing it.&nbsp; The second story happened in 1990 when
I was in the Peace Corps in West Africa.&nbsp; I saw a blue glow over the
room of a friend of mine who laid in her sick bed with a high fever.&nbsp;
I was sitting up in the other room, it was very late and I was drinking
(need to add that) with her boyfriend who also saw the blue wavering light.&nbsp;
We were sitting vigil with our friend and tending to her with wet rags
and fluids.&nbsp; The next day her fever had broke.&nbsp; We told her about
the blue light over her doorway and she nonchalantly said, "Oh yeah, that
was the blue lady"...she went on to describe how that blue lady has been
with her since she was a child.&nbsp; She said she doesn't see it as often
as she used to, but she will see her from time to time when she gets really
ill.&nbsp; Interesting, hugh?&nbsp; Lastly, I had a very uncomfortable
tangible experience in another very old house in St. Louis, about 100 yrs
old.&nbsp; It would have been 1993 and I was living in an apartment w/another
woman and one night I was asleep on my bed and then a man (I felt) came
in, with a very heavy and strong, malevolent presence, and sat on my bed.&nbsp;
I become highly aware and wide awake, terrified, but could not open my
eyes, I felt myself drugged, I couldn't seem to force a&nbsp; scream, or
force myself awake, and in fact, I felt like I was being seduced asleep.&nbsp;
The man had his had on my right breast holding me down and I felt the bones
of his fingers through my clothes.&nbsp; Even though my body wanted to
fall asleep I forced myself to scream out and as soom as I heard myself
murmur my roommates name, who I was calling out for, the spell was broken.&nbsp;
I was wide awake and the spirit was gone completely.&nbsp; I didn't feel
his presence at all any more and I felt safe.&nbsp; I felt strong.&nbsp;
The next day I told my roommate and she was very quiet at first, then said
that she had had the same experience in this same apartment.&nbsp; She
didn't want to talk much about it and neither she nor I had the experience
again after that night.&nbsp; Those are my ghosts stories.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Boots</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: virtual_joe_180@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was recently at a friend's house in Jay, Florida late
one night in room</B>
<BR><B>that was deemed a 'computer room'.&nbsp; My friend and I were talking
back and</B>
<BR><B>forth about normal adolescent things.&nbsp; I had to go to the bathroom
so I</B>
<BR><B>decided to step out through the back door of the room to go to the
bathroom.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Then I heard an odd tapping noise and told my friend to be
quiet.&nbsp; When we</B>
<BR><B>were both silent we heard the distinct sound of a person with boots
on</B>
<BR><B>walking through the kitchen, which has a tile floor.&nbsp; We both
froze and</B>
<BR><B>decided to go through the other door to investigate what had happened
in the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp; We both though in the back of our mind's that
perhaps it was his</B>
<BR><B>cat or his sister.&nbsp; But upon turning on the kitchen light we
saw that their</B>
<BR><B>was nothing in the kitchen and both his sister and the cat were
sound</B>
<BR><B>asleep.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Later that same night we went into the kitchen to get something
to drink</B>
<BR><B>and I observed a nail sticking out of the wall and asked my friend
why their</B>
<BR><B>was a nail in the wall for no apparent reason.&nbsp; My friend then
told me that</B>
<BR><B>something was hanging there but we couldn't place what it was so
we assumed</B>
<BR><B>that his sister might have moved it earlier.&nbsp; He asked his
sister the next</B>
<BR><B>day if she'd moved what had been hanging there and she said that
she hadn't</B>
<BR><B>and when they began to look for the object they found it neetly
tucked away</B>
<BR><B>beside the breadbox.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been other strange reports from my friend
such as one night he</B>
<BR><B>was trying to sleep and had the covers pulled up over his head and
he kept</B>
<BR><B>hearing someone clearly say his name.&nbsp; He then pulled down
the covers and</B>
<BR><B>looked around and no one was in the house.&nbsp; He then tried to
sleep again</B>
<BR><B>with the covers over his head and the same thing happened.&nbsp;
This happened 3</B>
<BR><B>time and my friend became un-nerved by this and left the house.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My friend, Mandy, Lives with two men in and old house in Melbourne,

house when no one in the area has a cat. The cat, Carla they named it,
is black with white around her eyes. Then one day Sam (other house mate.
He's all cocky and believes there's logical answer to every thing.) Woke
up with scratches all over his face. Carla still hangs around their house
but now they're used to seeing her. One thing that's weird is the fact
that Aaron pointed Carla out to Sam but he couldn't see her! I've seen
Carla 3 times and she's very beautiful.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Cave Springs, Benton Co. Arkansas Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: pittsdebi46@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I gotta tell this; I went to&nbsp; Ark. and stayed with relatives,
the upstairs</B>
<BR><B>was rented to a couple family friends but&nbsp; it was all one house.
They told</B>
<BR><B>me about a ghost that walked around the house at night. I believed
in ghosts</B>
<BR><B>I just didn't believe the people that was telling the story, three
of the</B>
<BR><B>men said they talked to the ghost. Everyone was working 2nd or 3rd
shift.</B>
<BR><B>One day in the spring of 1994 we had a minor wreck going to work
so we went</B>
<BR><B>back home. I lay on the bed in the middle of the stairs, and at
the head of</B>
<BR><B>the bed was the stairs to the 2nd floors. I went to sleep and didn't
know</B>
<BR><B>everyone had left. I heard a truck with loud motor pull up to the
front</B>
<BR><B>porch and thought one of the men upstairs was home. I heard him
walk pass</B>
<BR><B>me, pause for a minute, so I said "Hi Bryan" He said, "I'm not Bryan."
then</B>
<BR><B>he went up stairs, went thru drawers and I heard a couple of thumps
so I</B>
<BR><B>thought he was changeing shoes. He came back down and I looked and
the house</B>
<BR><B>was dark but no one was there. So I screamed and run to turn on
lights, I</B>
<BR><B>heard the truck start and run to the door. There was no one around
on that</B>
<BR><B>country road, no truck no nothing. So I waited for someone to come
home and</B>
<BR><B>told them&nbsp; what happened, they said they already told me the
place was</B>
<BR><B>haunted by the old man that owned it. The old man bought or built
a house</B>
<BR><B>about a 2 miles away and a friend was liveing there.&nbsp; About
3 years later I</B>
<BR><B>went to the friend and said I want to sleep on the couch that I
wanted to be</B>
<BR><B>country for awhile. He said OK but you're going to hear footsteps.
All night</B>
<BR><B>I could hear footsteps in the kitchen like a woman walking around.
So I</B>
<BR><B>stopped by there one day and saw a old lady with a blanket over
her</B>
<BR><B>shoulders sitting in the upstairs window.&nbsp; I went in and said"
I see you</B>
<BR><B>have company did they rent the upstairs?" He said no so we went
up there and</B>
<BR><B>it was empty. Come to find out the old man and woman that owned
both houses</B>
<BR><B>were husband and wife, the husband ghost stayed in the first house
and the</B>
<BR><B>wife ghost stayed in the second house.</B><B></B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I just came across your web site, and had an interesting story to
tell myself.</B>
<BR><B>about two years ago my uncle died, so his daughter, (my cousin)
came to live with the family. she brought along her personal belongings
as well as her cat and her dads ashes. One day we were in her room and
my dog, whom very seldomely growls or barks, started snarling and growling,
and her cat was hissing, both of the animals hairs were standing on end,
and they were staring off as if following something. They followed this
thing or what ever it was, staring as if something was moving around the
room. My cousin and I were freaking out, we have never seen the animals
act like that, and they followed what ever it was and stopped, staring
right at the closet, where my uncles ashes were. but there have been no
such problems since my cousin moved out and took her uncle with her, but
just talking about it puts shivers down my spine.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Dream House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: en_busca_de49@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am 49 now, but back about 30 years ago I used to have this recurring
dream. I dreamed a house, it had a staircase on the left as you walked
into the foyer. On the back was a screened in porch, coming in from the
screened porch was a big kitchen. I would have bits and peices of this
house come to me each time I dreamed it. A dog in the fenced in yard. Or
big bushes in the yard. A hugh living room area. It had high ceilings and
a big front porch. In 1976 I was married and my husband and I started looking
for our first house. We looked at maybe five houses around Carroll and
Haralson county Ga. We found this big two story frame house in Tallapoosa
on Kiker street in about 1980. I fell in love with the house right away,
and my husband and I almost divorced, partly because I had to have this
house. I didn't realize until a little later that I no longer ever dreamed
about the house. I was living in it. I lived there for about two years.
A short time. I met a friend while living in this house and she and her
family lived with us with their six children while they buildt thier house.
I have always thought the only reason I dreamed the house was so I could
meet my new freind and help her family when they needed a place to live.
I later moved across the road from my friend on the property she gifted
to me and my family. I have never dreamed about the house again since I
lived in the one on Kiker st.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Encounters or not?</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Modestorene@cs.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>Well I am not gonna say ive had encounters for sure cuz im still
yet not</B>
<BR><B>positive but hopefully after you read this you can be the judje
and see if they</B>
<BR><B>were encounters or not.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It all started when I
was 9 years old (im 10 right now), that was</B>
<BR><B>ayear ago i guess and i remmember clearly that one night i was lying
in bed</B>
<BR><B>facing my sister who (i share a bed with her)was sound asleep, and
i also remember</B>
<BR><B>that i had afeeling some one was watching me/us and one part of
my mind was</B>
<BR><B>telling me to turn around and see who it was and another was telling
me to not</B>
<BR><B>even dare to turn and look. I was so scared cuz then I heard someone
breathing</B>
<BR><B>and trust me im sure it was not my sister cuz she does not breath
like that!</B>
<BR><B>So then i decided to pack up some courage and turn around but when
i turned ,</B>
<BR><B>jumped out of bed and turned on the light as fast as i could there
was noone</B>
<BR><B>there!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ok now this was not an expierince i had but 2 stories i have</B>
<BR><B>heard my aunt and my parents tell me.This is my aunts story:One
time she, my</B>
<BR><B>uncle, and my 3 year old cousin(she was 1 back then)used to live
in this really old</B>
<BR><B>one story house who would really creep me out. Any way, one night
my uncle</B>
<BR><B>had to work on a night shift so theonly ones who were int the house
at the</B>
<BR><B>time(quick note:my aunts house was in elkton, kentucky and where
they lived they</B>
<BR><B>only had about 2 or 3 neighbors so that was aplace you could see
many</B>
<BR><B>apparations.)was my aunt and my cousin so first my aunt watched
tv with my cousin</B>
<BR><B>sprawled on the floor drinking her bottle and for some reason it
turned off by</B>
<BR><B>itself and sure the house had many electrical problems but she sure
knew it was not</B>
<BR><B>an electrical problem, not when she saw right before her eyes that
the power</B>
<BR><B>switch had been pushed!!! And also when they went to bed my cousin(Ana)</B>
<BR><B>crawled to the window looked out side and started saying "man!"
"man!".It wasa lady</B>
<BR><B>she saw its just that she confused man with woman when she was 1.So
my aunt</B>
<BR><B>said "what?!" and she looked out the window and she saw nothing.
She didnt get a</B>
<BR><B>chance too locate information about that hause because they moved
over here</B>
<BR><B>with us in bowling green,kentucky. WEll i guess thats all. Thanx,</B><B></B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>Hello---I would like to start by saying that I came upon your site
after reading the news article of the recent "ghost" capture on security
film at the Hampton Court palace in the UK Dec 19. My eldest daughter and
I were searching websites. I thought I'd share this with your website.
I have been having paranormal experiences since I can remember and that's
at least back to very early childhood. I'm almost 50yrs old now and have
adult and young children and I'm married. I come from a family that's had
lost of paranormal experiences on both sides of the family. My husband
thinks I'm kind of looney when I tell him of my and my familys' experiences.
Even some of my children have had this. I've experience premonitions, dreams,
ghosts, whatever and to tell you the truth most times I wish I couldn't.
But this experience unnerved me the most to the point where I almost had
a nervous breakdown. This happened in 1994. It was a difficult year as
my eldest brother died when I was moving into a new home. And, at my job
there were several employee death in that year alone more than any other
year since I've been there---23yrs. There was a woman I worked with several
times--we would leave work at the same time mostly, and leaving out the
same exit. Her son would some and pick her up from work--at times she had
to wait. Well, I noticed this particular year that she ahd been losing
quite a lot of weight--I was thinking--boy am I jealous!&nbsp; I also noticed
that she had a look of attitude on her face--I wondered what was the problem.
When I left the building, I'd turn around and look at her---she'd be looking
right at me like she was angry or something. Well this went on for about
2 weeks or so but I had been seeing her all that year up to that point.
After I had returned to work on funeral leave, Some co-workers and I were
discussing all the employees that died---I work in a hospital and these
were nurses--and another one I knew quiet well had just died as well. Well
when they were naming these people, the one I had been seeing was mentioned.
I didnt catch that at first but then a chill when over me. I asked when
she had died and they said in March of that year---this was Sept already!.
I couldn't say another word! I became very nervous, shaky--and I mentioned
privately to my friend and co-worker I&nbsp; had been seeing that woman
all year!! Being a nurse I started recalling looking at the surgery schedules
as we commonly have to do---I then remembered seeing her name on it! She
had very extensive surgey for breast cancer---and she died at that very
same hospital where she and I worked! I really became sick after hearing
that. I told my husband, family or whoever what happened. They said to
me it must have been someone who looked like her---but i knew her well,
what she looked like, etc. And--after finding out what happened to her
I never saw her again! I've had my share of aparitions but, boy this REALLY
got to me!&nbsp; Thank you for letting me share this!!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Gabby</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sue-allyson-doggies@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Well if you have read my stories, most called Gabby, I have just
one last story for everyone.</B>
<BR><B>Just yesterday, me friends and I were looking in a baby names book
for "Gabby". (Gabby was the spirit's name.) Well, what we found is that
(in 1999 version) Gabby meant God's heroine, God's messenger. Well, about
maybe a year earlier, I had found a pin that I had never seen before, sitting
on my kitchen table. It was an Angel with a heart on it that said I (Heart)
u. Now, knowing that Gabby most likely put it there, (because my mom hadn't
even seen it.) and Gabby's name meant God's Messenger or Heroine, I know
Gabby is my guardian Angel. I still haven't talked to Gabby yet, but maybe
someday I will be lucky enough to.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Ghost animals and people</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: shelob242003@yahoo.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>Hello,</B>
<BR><B>I am a 13 year old that is very interested in 'ghost'. I have a
few experiances i'd like to share with you.</B>
<BR><B>1) I was sleeping over at a friends (Betty). We went to bed ,but
at like 11:00pm I opened my eyes and found Betty by the window. She looked
scared and suprised. I stood beside her and looked out the same window
she was staring at. When I saw was outside, my jaw nearly hit the ground.
I saw three men come out from the woods that were behimd bettys house.
They were pale and looked dead.</B>
<BR><B>2) Betty spent the night at my house and we were sleeping in the
front yard. I woke up from a strange noise outside, When I stood up I saw
the most buetiful white coyote ever. I woke up betty and she got so scared
she ran in the house.</B>
<BR><B>3) I read a story about Berry Sharrocks grave to my cousin. It says
that if you visit his grave late at night dogs would growl and bark warnings.
My cousin (Bob) didn,t believe it and decided to check it out himself.
Him and a friend went to the town where it is,got a hotel room,ate, then
waited till midnight to visit his grave. They found it and snuck over the
fence. and only got a few yards when they heard dogs barking. They went
closer the dogs got louder. Once they got close enough to touch the grave
stone dogs came from the woods snarling acting like they wanted to eat
them. They ran for their lives, they left in such a hurry they forgot to
pay the hotel bill. LOL</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ghost of Japanese soldiers in the Power Plant.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:lefritz@info.com.ph</B><B></B>

<P><B>1) The old Meralco power plant in Isla Provisor in Ermita (Now owned
by NAPOCOR) was a scene of fierce WWII battle. Thousands died in that battle
when the American forces tried to recapture it from the Japanese. In the
post-war years, a new power plant was constructed there. During the construction
stage, remains of Japanese soldiers, their weapons and other battle gears
were uncovered.</B>
<BR><B>There, in the deaerator section of the power plant, Napocor employees
often see the ghosts of the Japanese soldiers in the errand and preparing
for battle then will disappear suddenly. One employee even claimed that
he met face to face one of the ghosts (an officer) when he was in the washroom.</B>
<BR><B>2) In another power plant formerly owned by Meralco in Sucat Muntinlupa,&nbsp;
A figure of a soldier in full battle gear was reported in many occasions.
A witness's first indication of the ghost presence is a drop in temperature
followed by hearing of heavy boots steps.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I experienced that signs and saw that ghost too when I worked
as a material controller in that power plant during its rehabilitation
project in 1990. It was 2 A.M. while we were resting in our field office
there. (We were two officemates doing a night shift and we were certain
that we locked all the doors.) Suddenly, in the dark corridor, a black
figure appeared, and started to walk heavily like a marching soldier toward
us. It continued&nbsp; marching for 10 full minutes with a loud sound every
time the ghost's feet hit the wooden floor until it vanished like a bubble.
Its caricature was a WWII Japanese soldier. I can not say that I met the
ghost face to face because it (he) had no face.</B>

<BR><B>Grandma, and the ghost car</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Jcamp35354@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I have two encounters that I will tell you about.&nbsp; The first
happened when I was thirteen and involved my grandma.&nbsp; My maternal
grandma, (my mother's mom), died a few days before my thirteenth birthday
and was buried on my birthday.&nbsp; Needless to say, this did not make
for a good birthday to celebrate my becoming a teenager.&nbsp; Anyway,
a couple of weeks after my grandma passed, the family had finished sorting
out her belongings and we ended up with several items, the most prominent
being my grandma's favorite rocking chair.</B>
<BR><B>A couple of days after my mom had placed the rocking chair next
to my dad's recliner in the front room, I was up late on a Saturday night
(about one a.m.) watching t.v. when the chair started rocking back and
forth.&nbsp; I didn't have a fan going, and no windows were open so there
wasn't a draft or any wind sufficient to make the chair move.&nbsp; I was
a bit frightened and I scrunched myself into the couch and pulled the cover
I had up to my chin while telling myself I was either seeing things or
that there was a breeze from somewhere that caused the chair to move.</B>
<BR><B>A few days later I told my mom about seeing the chair rocking, (this
had happened a couple of times by then), and she said in an offhand manner,
"oh, that's just gramma visiting us."&nbsp; She then told me that she had
witnessed the chair moving herself and that she just knew that it was her
mother coming to visit us.&nbsp; She also told me at that time that after
her dad had died seven years before and her mom was living by herself that
grandma would see grampa's favorite recliner kicked back and the t.v. turned
to football games on Sundays.&nbsp; Grandma would put set the recliner
up and turn off the t.v., only to have it back on and the chair reclined
a few minutes later.</B>
<BR><B>The second experience I will tell you about involves a ghost car
and happened when I was eighteen.&nbsp; I was with several friends hanging
out around midnite on a Friday on a bridge in our hometown.&nbsp; I had
drove and we managed to cram six people into my cutlass.&nbsp; Well, we
were doing things that teenagers aren't supposed to do, but do anyway.&nbsp;
In this case, we were shooting off fireworks that are considered illegal
in our state, Indiana.&nbsp; The bridge that we were on is in the middle
of nowhere, about six miles outside of town so we figured that nobody would
be around to hear the small explosions.</B>
<BR><B>After we had been there about twenty minutes, one of our friends
saw some headlights about a mile down the road and coming fast.&nbsp; Thinking
it was the police, we crammed into my car and I bolted out of there.&nbsp;
At this point I should give a description of where we were at.&nbsp; The
road we were on is a dirt road and goes for about two miles south from
where it comes off a main road to the bridge.&nbsp; About twenty yards
south of the bridge, the road makes a 90 degree turn to the right and runs
in a straight line another two miles to a paved road so the dirt road makes
half of a square.</B>
<BR><B>I hit the curve doing forty and my car fish-tails around the curve.&nbsp;
You definately do not want to be going too fast when you hit that turn.&nbsp;
Anyway, two of our friends are looking out the back window and keeping
a running commentary on the headlights.&nbsp; Saying things like "still
going fast", "coming up on the curve", "they just hit the curve."&nbsp;
All of a sudden, Frank (not his real name) says "oh no, they just went
off the road, and they were going fast."&nbsp; We are about half a mile
from the curve at this point and I turn around and go back.&nbsp; When
we get there, no car off the road, no trees bent or knocked over.&nbsp;
I go over the bridge and turn around in the road so my headlights can shine
on where the car went off.&nbsp; There are tire marks in the grass that
lead to a big tree and that's it, nothing else.&nbsp; By now we are all
thinking that maybe Frank was mistaken, but Jeff, the other friend who
was looking out the window, confirmed that the car went off the road.&nbsp;
About five minutes later, as we were still puzzling over this, Frank shouts
that more headlights are coming down the road.&nbsp; Again we take off,
only to have the same thing happen.&nbsp; We have finally had enough and
head home.&nbsp; Later we ask around and find out that in the late fiftes
or early sixties, two cars were racing on that road late at night and one
of the cars went off the road and hit a tree, at the exact spot where we
saw it, and the crash killed the driver.&nbsp; Several people told us that
they have had similar experiences on that road.&nbsp; Sorry for this being
so long, but I thought they were interesting stories and I have studied
ghost phenomena for quite some time because of these encounters and learned
a great deal about different types of hauntings so if anybody has questions,
feel free to email me at jcamp35354@aol.com.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Grandma Visits Again</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:chrism@acton.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My first encounter with my dead Grandmother occurred the morning
of her</B>
<BR><B>funeral, I was 10 years old.&nbsp; The details of that are recorded
in "The</B>
<BR><B>Beginning".&nbsp; My dead Grandmother visited again when I was 16,
this time at</B>
<BR><B>our house in Lincoln, Nebraska.&nbsp; My parents built this house
on a lot that</B>
<BR><B>used to be part of a City park.&nbsp; There had at one time been
an ice skating</B>
<BR><B>rink where the house sits.&nbsp; We'd lived there about 4 years
when this</B>
<BR><B>happened, but the details of that night would not be truthfully
discussed</B>
<BR><B>with me until I was 33 years old!&nbsp; What I recall of that night
was being</B>
<BR><B>very snug and sound asleep on a dark winter night.&nbsp; It was
one of those deep</B>
<BR><B>sleeps that feel like you've been wrapped in the best comforter
in the</B>
<BR><B>world.&nbsp; Therefore, I was not happy when I was pulled awake.&nbsp;
When I pryed my</B>
<BR><B>eyes open, I couldn't see anything unusual and couldn't figure out
what made</B>
<BR><B>me wake up.&nbsp; Then it dawned on me there was this deep golden
glow of light</B>
<BR><B>in the hallway, like a hundred candles were burning out there.&nbsp;
Since I'd</B>
<BR><B>long ago given up a nighlight, it puzzled me.&nbsp; While I was
noodling away on</B>
<BR><B>the light dilemma, I was shocked to my very being when my Mother
screamed in</B>
<BR><B>the most harsh, gutteral tones I'd ever heard, I almost didn't believe
it</B>
<BR><B>was her voice.&nbsp; What she screamed was, "Get out of here and
NEVER return!"</B>
<BR><B>Seconds later the light disappeared, the house became extremely
dark, and at</B>
<BR><B>the other end of the house the garage door slammed shut hard against
the</B>
<BR><B>pavement.&nbsp; I yelled for my Mom, asking if she was OK and what
was this all</B>
<BR><B>about.&nbsp; She told me nothing was happening, did I have a dream?&nbsp;
The next</B>
<BR><B>morning over breakfast I asked her again, it just seemed too real
to have</B>
<BR><B>been a dream.&nbsp; She became fairly stern with me, and said absolutely
nothing</B>
<BR><B>had happened, so let's just drop it.&nbsp; The topic was dropped
for 17 years.</B>
<BR><B>I don't even recall the conversation we were having, but for some
reason my</B>
<BR><B>Mom decided it was a good time to finally come clean with me about
what had</B>
<BR><B>happed in our house those many winter nights ago.&nbsp; Apparently,
she had</B>
<BR><B>gotten up to use the bathroom, and when she returned and closed
her eyes to</B>
<BR><B>go back to sleep she thought she heard something rustling at the
foot of her</B>
<BR><B>bed.&nbsp; As she opened her eyes, she too saw the deep golden light
in the hall,</B>
<BR><B>and was shocked because she'd turned off all lights when she returned
to her</B>
<BR><B>bed.&nbsp; As her eyes adjusted more, she realized there was a figure
of a woman</B>
<BR><B>standing at the foot of her bed, and that woman was her Mother.&nbsp;
My</B>
<BR><B>Grandmother was crying and finally said to my Mother, "Elsie, I
am so, so</B>
<BR><B>lonely.&nbsp; I need to take Chrissy with me."&nbsp; As soon as
she said that, she was</B>
<BR><B>suddenly not at the foot of the bed, but my Mother could hear her
in my room</B>
<BR><B>and she was telling me, "Chrissy, wake up, it's time to go."&nbsp;
That is when I</B>
<BR><B>must have pulled out of my deep sleep, and when my Mother was screaming
to</B>
<BR><B>have her leave.&nbsp; My Grandmother has never returned.</B>
<BR><B>Interestingly enough, years after my parents had sold the house,
moved out</B>
<BR><B>of state and later moved back, we have learned more activity has
occurred in</B>
<BR><B>the house.&nbsp;&nbsp; The house was sold to a cousin of one of
my high school</B>
<BR><B>girlfriends.&nbsp; They'd lived in the house for about 7 years.&nbsp;
They had 2 young</B>
<BR><B>boys.&nbsp; The husband was a bank officer, and while out on bank
business was</B>
<BR><B>killed in an auto accident on the interstate.&nbsp; The young widow
remained in</B>
<BR><B>the house, and about 3 years after her husband's death was remarried.&nbsp;
She</B>
<BR><B>married the brother of my dentist's wife.&nbsp; Almost immediately
after</B>
<BR><B>returning from their honeymoon things started to happen.&nbsp; Doors
would slam,</B>
<BR><B>things that belonged to the new husband would disappear only to
be found in</B>
<BR><B>the trash.&nbsp; Actually, they tolerated the activity for quite
some time, but</B>
<BR><B>finally found another house they liked, so they moved.&nbsp; The
new house does</B>
<BR><B>not apparently have any activity.&nbsp; They sold the house to the
new husband's</B>
<BR><B>mother, who is a very well-known realtor.&nbsp; The house continues
to have</B>
<BR><B>issues with doors slamming, but no other activities.&nbsp; We'd
not been aware of</B>
<BR><B>these activities until the dentist began to tell me during a visit
that the</B>
<BR><B>holiday had been very interesting due to the stories provided by
his</B>
<BR><B>mother-in-law about our old house.&nbsp; He was laughing it off,
right up until I</B>
<BR><B>told him to sit down and hear what happened with my Grandmother!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hanson Ma Plymouth County Hospital</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: EFeterowski@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>Good Evening,</B>
<BR><B>I have a few stories to tell about the Plymouth County Hospital,
the old turberculosis hospital in Hanson, Ma.&nbsp; I have been there with
friends on a few occations.</B>
<BR><B>The first time we went there, my friend Debbie and I went.&nbsp;
It was about 12 in the morning.&nbsp; As building is boarded up, we needed
to use questionably illegal means of getting in.&nbsp; I do not recommend
this at all.&nbsp; My brother and his friends recently tried to get in
and got caught, recieving a $250 ticket for their efforts.&nbsp; Debbie
and I went around the building several times looking for a way in;&nbsp;
a loose window, an open door, anything.&nbsp; Several hours passed and
we could not find a way in.&nbsp; We spent the time going around and aaround
the building searching.&nbsp; We were just about to leave when I spotted
a window that was completely unsecure and wide open!&nbsp; This is a window
we had passed several times before.&nbsp; We got in and explored the building,
searching through various files and paper work, exploring room upon room
until the sun started peeking through the clouds.</B>
<BR><B>I found many files on patients that had been in the hospital dating
back as far as the 1960's.&nbsp; They were not medical records, they were
lists of perscription orders that the nurses were given by doctors.&nbsp;
Many included drugs such as Halcion, Valuim, and other psycotropic meds.&nbsp;
I took these files home and kept them in my bedroom where I would look
at them more closley.&nbsp; The following night, my television began to
turn off randomly when I was watching it.&nbsp; It had never done this
before.&nbsp; Honestly, I began to get the creeps and began to become paranoid
that someone was always in the room with me.&nbsp; A few nights later as
I was walking downstairs into my bedroom, I heard someone say, "Go Away"
very quietly.&nbsp; I became panicked and ran upstairs.&nbsp; I was so
afraid to go back downstairs that I couldn't sleep in my bedroom for weeks.&nbsp;
I eventually returned the stack of files to the hospital. I put them on
a stair way outside because I couldn't get back into the hospital upon
returning.</B>
<BR><B>Another occation that I visited the hospital, with 2 friends, Heidi
and Debbie, something more frightening occured.&nbsp; We entered the building
through a small window in the basment.&nbsp; We had to crawl through the
window, and drop down into a small staff bathroom; using the sink as a
ladder, and then stepping down onto the floor.&nbsp; From there we found
our way to the top floor where we had never been before.&nbsp; While in
the hallway, I looked quickly and saw a young man standing in a doorway.&nbsp;
Then, he was gone when I looked again.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't say anything
to my friends, instead, I just kept walking.&nbsp; The hallway was freezing
cold.&nbsp; A few minutes later, I felt extremely sick to my stomach.&nbsp;
I couldn't walk anymore, instead I got sick in one of the bathrooms, and
so did my friend Deb.&nbsp; We were all feeling extremely uncomfortable,
but I still hadn't said anything about the image I saw just a few minutes
earlier.&nbsp; As we continued down the hallway, I thought I saw the same
man again.&nbsp; Immediately after telling my friends, we all looked at
each other and ran.&nbsp; We ran, and ran until we found ourselves back
at the window we entered; feeling as if someone was chasing us.&nbsp; We
did not feel ok again until we were half way down the street.</B>
<BR><B>I have not entered that building since, but I have been on the grounds
recently with my fiance, my brother and his girlfriend.&nbsp; We walked
around the grounds and were taking pictures.&nbsp; My brothers camera would
not work.&nbsp; He went back again, and took pictures, and none of them
came out.&nbsp; I have attached 3 pictures that were taken inside and outside
the hospital, you can see orbs everywhere.&nbsp; These particular pics.
were taken with a digital camera.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ERIC82BORNE@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>hello my name is eric , i have seen something that appeared to be
a ghost and i remember it like yesterday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
i was around 7 or 8 years old, me and my brother michael slept in the same
room, my oldest brother jamison had his own room, jamison had spent the
night with a friend, so michael my other brother went to sleep in jamisons
room for that night. michael and i had a school desk in the middle of our
room that my mom had got when she was a teacher,&nbsp; well i woke up about
2 in the morning from not being able to sleep well, and i opened my eyes
looking into my room and i saw it running around my desk in circles( a
man that was transparent and with white flames glowing around him and following
him wherever he ran), i was so afraid i couldnt scream, all i could do
was hide my head under my pillows and rub my eyes thinking it was a dream,
so i pulled my head out from under the pillow slowly to peak out and prove
to myself&nbsp; it was a dream, and then i saw him standing over my bed
looking over me so i just covered my head and eventully fell asleep again.
now im 23 years old and i still remember it like yesterday, and after all
the people that have laughed at me for believing that, i still know its
true and not afraid to tell anyone.</B><B></B>

<P><B>He Took My Mom Home</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Rosieoj1@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>In 1990, my mother was dying of cancer.&nbsp; The night before she
died, there was a man standing on my back porch, tall and thin, waving
at me.&nbsp; Being scared since it was 2:30 in the morning, and living
next to a mental health institution (thinking one had escaped) I called
the city police.&nbsp; They came by and said they saw nobody there. While
talking to them St. Mary's Hospital called and said my mother was dying
and they couldn't get ahold of my dad.&nbsp; I hung up and went, and she
later died that day.&nbsp; Two months after the funeral, my sister had
went to mom's childhood homestead and gotten picture of the family years
ago.&nbsp; I looked at one picture and screamed.&nbsp; That man on the
back porch was my mothers father, who had died in 1937 when my&nbsp; mother
was 18 years old. Since I was born in 1951 I had never seen the man or
seen pictures of him.&nbsp; THE MAN OF MY BACK PORCH WAS MY GRANDFATHER
WHO DIED IN 1937, COMING TO TAKE MY MOTHER (HIS DAUGHTER) HOME!!!!</B><B></B>

<P><B>My partner and I went to visit the Idaho City cemetary.</B>
<BR><B>It was not my first visit as I was raised in Boise, but it was his.&nbsp;
I had not wanted to go as I am a sensitive and had previous experiences
there, but because of the history, he wanted to see it.&nbsp; We found
a horrible poem that had been written and covered in plastic (weathered)
and left on a baby's grave.&nbsp; As usual, unseen eyes watched and followed
us.&nbsp; We could not stay but took the poem and destroyed it. There is
dark energy there..and a lot of it.&nbsp; There is more to the story, but
it suffices to say that it is not a place to go and hang out.&nbsp; THe
cemetary is located on a hill high above the town and is an unpopulated
area.&nbsp; Many of the graves are in bad condition, and it is very, very
old. It would be interesting to have paranormal testing done there..I can
guarantee that there is a lot going on there</B><B></B>

<P><B>Kristen's guardian angel</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Kellylucas3@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>One night I was working out of town, my wife was at home pregnant.
The guys I was staying with were all asleep, I got down at the foot of
my bed in praying position. I asked my sister Kristen, deceased for two
years, to look after my unborn child Kristen. Later that night I was awakened
by the feeling of someone sitting on the bed beside me. I quickly turned
over and grabbed at that spot, nobody was there. I began to weep, not because
I was scared but because I knew my sister Kristen was there. I like to
think that it was her giving me the sign that she would be glad to look
after my unborn child.</B>

<BR><B>Mischievous Spirit</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: geidell@stpaulsnewarkde.org</B><B></B>

<P><B>About 5 years ago, my husband and I were living in Charleston, West
Virginia.&nbsp; We lived in a hundred-year old townhouse on the west side
of town for two years.&nbsp; During this time, we experienced several unusual
ghostly incidents.&nbsp; Certain objects, most notably keys, would mysteriously
disappear.&nbsp; We kept our keys in the same place:&nbsp; the coffee table.&nbsp;
But somehow they would vanish, only to reappear on the coffee table after
an extensive search throughout the house.&nbsp; My husband had several
antique pocket watches, all of which he kept in the office upstairs.&nbsp;
One day he pulled out one of the boxes containing a watch, left it on his
desk while he went downstairs to give music lessons to a student, and returned
afterwards to find it missing.&nbsp; At first, he suspected his student
of theft, but I assured him that I was alone in our bedroom (studying)
and didn't see or hear anyone come upstairs.&nbsp; One late evening as
I was brushing my teeth and getting ready for bed, I felt the fur of my
dog, an australian terrier named T-bone, as it brushed against my leg.&nbsp;
I turned and reached down to pet him--and found nothing there. Shaken,&nbsp;
I walked into the office where my husband was working, and I saw T-Bone
curled up under the desk, next to his foot.&nbsp; I told my husband what
happened in the bathroom, and he confirmed T-Bone was with him all night
with the door closed.&nbsp; The last incident occurred as my husband and
I were getting ready for bed another evening.&nbsp; We were chatting and
cleaning up, when suddenly we heard a loud crash from our bedroom.&nbsp;
We ran to the bedroom and found our professionally framed picture of "The
Lady of Shalott"&nbsp; on the floor, the glass shattered, the frame broken.&nbsp;
It had been mounted on a hook above the mantle of our fireplace--the only
way to remove it would be to lift the picture off the hook.&nbsp; It would
have been impossible for the picture to "fall off".&nbsp; Plus, the hook
was still in the wall.&nbsp; The early incidents were fun and harmless--almost
as if a child were teasing you.&nbsp; My husband remained something of
a skeptic until the picture crashed on our bedroom floor.&nbsp; He was
very puzzled and came to the conclusion that our teasing child was becoming
more like a mischievous brat.&nbsp; We moved to a new city soon afterwards,
but every now and then, we remember our little "imp" and have a good laugh.</B>

<BR><B>Mommy My Bed Shook!</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Sincerebliss2003@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>Hello, my name is Alicia and i am 15 yr.s old. I am currently living
in Indiana and i am willing to share my story with you. It all began at
the ripe age of 5-6. I was in my bedroom sleeping and my mom was also sleeping
in the same room because at the time there were two beds. Well, this incident
took place probably late afternoon because i remember it was light outside
and my mother probably got home from work and she was talking her daily
nap with me. Well, i was in the middle of a good sleep when suddenly my
bed started shaking! I looked up and saw nothing, but i was certain i had
heard a voice trying to scare me. I remember i was just laying there and
did not know what to do. By instinct i got up as fast as i could and ran
to my mother waking her up saying&nbsp; mom a ghost shook my bed...a ghost
shook my bed!!!! She was half asleep and she was saying go back to bed..and
she was practically ignoring what i had just told her.&nbsp; Later that
day i had approached my dad and he actually thought i was making it up!
My mother did not believe me and my father did not believe and i was just
a kid wanting to be heard. Nothing really happened after that, but since
then up to about the age of 12 it was really hard for me to get to sleep...i
mean like really hard. Like 4-5 hrs it would take me to fall asleep. Also,
sometimes in the morning i always do the same daily routine and i left
the bathroom door open and i look and it was practically shut..i heard
the crack in the door when it had shut and that really freaked me out.Not
to mention my cat always smacks at the air! I always learn from my experiences
and i believe there is something out there..something unexplainable. This
is the conclusion to my story..and if someone has had similar experiences
would you please send me an e-mail ..at sincerebliss@yahoo.com. Thank you.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Dad's Place</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi! I don't wanna give my name, but im a girl from alberta. Ok, Ever
since my dad bought his house, I knew something besides us,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( My dad my brother and I) lived in the house. The "thing" wasn't evil,
but i consider it to be my pal. One time, I was down stairs playing pool
with my best friend brittany. Something scared her, so she kept her back
to the wall on the far side of the pool table. I told her not to be afraid.
I was leaning over to shoot, and a shadow apeared on the green pool table.
It was a tall man, and I thought it was my Dad, but I turned around and
nobody was there. My Brother, Reece was at the skateboard park, and I was
freaked. My friend Brittany said she saw the shadow too, but her face&nbsp;
went pale&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and she knew my dad wasn't
there.</B>
<BR><B>On the far side of the room, there is a rocking chair that rocks
a little without touhing it or anything. I decided to name my "ghost" Geroge,
because when my Dad was renovating he found a picture of a man dressed
old fashioned clothes that said Geroge on the back. A few weeks later,
my friend Britt slept over again. My blinds on my window slightly rocked
in the morning, wi the window shut completely.</B>
<BR><B>My Dad kept this old gate in the basement that was from his old
house when he was a boy. It it was rusty, and looked like belonged in a
jail cellar. I once walked by it, and the swich opening thingy on it opened,
I was Freaked, so I went upstairs. I do believe this house is haunted,
because a girl named Chrissy in my neighborhood has weird things happeningto
her. she hears footsteps, taps turn on when no one is home, and we hear
partying up in the attic when her mom isn't home. (She lives with her mom).
Any way I hope you understand, And I know george treats me nice, almost
like I'm His daughter, and I wanted to share this with you ! thanks.&nbsp;
P.S: yesterday I found a old fashioned wedding dress in my attic that fitts
perfect and when I wore it, the rocking chair rocked liked crazy!</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Encounter</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Panzermick@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I've always been interested in the paranormal.&nbsp; I grew up reading
ghost stories where I found them -- usually in very short paperbacks.&nbsp;
I'm not really sure what attracted me to the stories.&nbsp; Maybe just
the whole mystery of it.&nbsp; Maybe it was the adventure into an unknown
realm.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, the story I am about to relate is true.&nbsp; It's not your
average one-on-one ghost story that most people don't believe because it
can't be corroborated.&nbsp; This "encounter" was witnessed not only by
myself but also two other people.</B>
<BR><B>I live near Harpers Ferry, WV.&nbsp; During my younger, wilder years
some friends and myself would go to the railroad bridge, cross over the
Potomac River to the tunnel on the other side and wait for the eleven o'clock
train -- reason being: to try and launch rocks up in the air to hit the
cars in the automobile carriers of the railroad.&nbsp; Of course, we'd
also get something to drink before going.&nbsp; I suppose it was to boost
our courage.&nbsp; I know this must sound like general hoodlum stuff, but
believe it or not, there isn't that much to do in WV unless you're of age
(that's a joke).</B>
<BR><B>One Saturday night, three of us shared a six-pack.&nbsp; No one
was by any means drunk.&nbsp; We sneaked onto the bridge in typical commando
fashion and were waiting by the entrance to the tunnel.&nbsp; For some
reason, either we were early or the train was late.&nbsp; At the other
end of the tunnel were two red RR signal lights.&nbsp; One of my friends
got this burr up his butt to go "get" one of these lights.&nbsp; Ever the
realist, I pointed out that all we had was a little keychain squeeze flashlight
and a multi-tool leatherman; neither of which were strong enough to dismantle
a RR signal light.&nbsp; But then "the dare" happened.&nbsp; We all eventually
dared each other to walk through the tunnel.</B>
<BR><B>The lights from the town behind us shown through into the tunnel
about halfway.&nbsp; Basically, we all got behind the guy with the mini-flashlight
and slowly walked through the tunnel.&nbsp; The shadows inside the tunnel
were incredible.&nbsp; Even stopping to let your eyes adjust couldn't penetrate
the gloom.&nbsp; Water dripping from the ceiling of the tunnel was hitting
the large gravel rocks underneath and between the tracks and it sounded
just like the sound we made as we walked on the rocks.&nbsp; Finally we
got to the other end and to our objective of the light.&nbsp; Relaxed that
we had made our way through, I stood lookout to watch back through the
tunnel.&nbsp; The lights from the town lit up the tracks but made some
serious shadows along the sides of the tunnel.&nbsp; I kept hearing sounds
as if someone was walking towards us in the gravel, but couldn't see anything.&nbsp;
I was actually worried that maybe there was a RR person on duty who had
followed us.</B>
<BR><B>As I went to see the lack of progress on the light, the sound of
footsteps on the gravel close to us caught my hears.&nbsp; I turned quickly
and saw an elderly man in a checkered shirt coming towards us in a stumbling
sort of walk.&nbsp; His right hand was stretched out as if he was reaching
out for help.&nbsp; The immediate and most weird thing was that he was
almost luminescent.&nbsp; I mean it was as if the lights from the town
were giving him shape, but shining through him as he moved from the shadows.</B>
<BR><B>I yelled, "RUN!" to my friends who both turned to look at what I
had seen.&nbsp; I know this because I ran in front of them to the small
bank leading up to the road and remember seeing them looking at what I
saw.&nbsp; As I made it to the surface of the road and ran across to the
other side, I realized that if I didn't turn to stop my friends we'd all
fall a considerable way into the old C&amp;O canal that ran parallel to
the road.&nbsp; I turned and could tell even in the dark that my friends
were as afraid as I was.&nbsp; I think I yelled something about the canal
and we ran down the road toward the other entrance of the tunnel where
we had initially started.</B>
<BR><B>When we got to the other entrance, we had gotten over our fear from
the run and were looking to figure out what it was we had seen.&nbsp; After
some discussion, we all agreed that we had seen a guy in white coming towards
us.&nbsp; We waited at the tunnel for him to come back and figured we could
ambush whoever it was either on the road or at the entrance to the tunnel.&nbsp;
No one came after us.&nbsp; Another discussion and it was agreed that we
get out of dodge.&nbsp; The rest of the night is a blur but I do remember
that we all went home early (early for us at that age).&nbsp; No one mentioned
the word ghost, but we couldn't figure out how this person seemed to look
transparent.</B>
<BR><B>The next day, Sunday, my family always went to my grandmothers house
for lunch and to spend the afternoon.&nbsp; After the dinner, my mother,
aunt and grandmother would stay in the kitchen reading the Sunday paper,
listening to the radio and talking.&nbsp; I walked out into the kitchen
to get something to drink and an announcement came on the radio.&nbsp;
Seems that the authorities had been searching the river at Harper's Ferry
for an elderly man with altzheimers.&nbsp; He had left his home in the
town when his nurse left for groceries.&nbsp; A train had come through
and had hit him.&nbsp; The engineer had reported it and the rescue people
had spent most of the afternoon looking for him in the river.&nbsp; Turns
out that his body was discovered in the tunnel early that Sunday morning!!!&nbsp;
We had walked right by his body!!&nbsp; I never saw a picture of the man,
but I know what I saw that night was most likely his ghost.</B>
<BR><B>One of my friends who witnessed this has since died in a plane crash.&nbsp;
My other friend and I always see each other at least once or twice a year
now.&nbsp; Invariably, one of us brings up the story.&nbsp; What we saw
really happened.&nbsp; I only relate this story if someone ever asks me
if I ever saw a ghost before.&nbsp; I figured it would make for an interesting
note to you guys.&nbsp; Let me know what you think.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Ghost Experiences: Family Visits</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: rose_petal_forever@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is my spirit experience.</B>
<BR><B>My mom had always said that I would dream of meeting my Grandfather
from her side of the family because he died before I was even born.&nbsp;
She always talked about him to.&nbsp; He was Veteran.&nbsp; Although according
to her, he was always drunk and everything.&nbsp; But to her he was still
a hero.&nbsp; She said that when I was three or four I would come out of
my room and say that 'I had a visit from Grandpa' or I would point at a
picture of him and say 'He came to visit me last night.'&nbsp; I remember
it.&nbsp; And I thought it was just a dream because that's what my mom
told me it was.</B>
<BR><B>When I started getting older I had these strange feelings.&nbsp;
They were bad feelings.&nbsp; Like something bad was going to happen.&nbsp;
I wasn't feeling these feeling's.&nbsp; It felt like someone was actually
whispering them in my ear.&nbsp; Telling me what was going to happen.&nbsp;
That I needed to get away or something.&nbsp; It was really strange.&nbsp;
One day I listened to what they were telling me and I got out of my room.&nbsp;
I ran to my mom and she brought me back to my room to go back to sleep
because it happened to be around 2 in the morning.&nbsp; We wen't back
in and the bookshelf that was connected to my bed had fallen down. But
then I woke up.&nbsp; It was a dream.&nbsp; I didn't even have a bookshelf.
My friend did.&nbsp; And it had fallen onto her bed when I was playing
over at her house.&nbsp; It would of hit me if I didn't get up in time.&nbsp;
I didn't tell my mom about that one.&nbsp; It was just too weird.</B>
<BR><B>My mom was making me stay in my brothers room because he was afraid
to sleep alone.&nbsp; He didn't say why but I guess it would be fun.&nbsp;
He actually had a TV that worked.&nbsp; Mine was broke.&nbsp; I was sleeping
when I saw ,what I just learned after reading about them, was a Ghost Light.&nbsp;
I heard a strange noise coming from the bottom of my bed.&nbsp; I looked
down to see this strange floating white light.&nbsp; I screamed as loud
as I could and it disappeared.&nbsp; My mom came running into the room.&nbsp;
She believed me, I could tell, but she said that it was just my imagination.&nbsp;
She was hiding something from me.</B>
<BR><B>About 2 years later I learned that from my mom's side of the family
we have strange supernatural experiences.&nbsp; Ever since she told me
I have been having small things happening.&nbsp; And every once in awhile
something big will happen.&nbsp; Like sometimes I would see indention's
in my bed, or a human shadow on the wall.&nbsp; And then some seriously
scary things started happening.</B>
<BR><B>I don't really want to say but it scared me so bad that my mom told
me to pray to god and ask him to stop my dead family from visiting me.&nbsp;
That's what a few people in my family have done.&nbsp; I did and everything
stopped.&nbsp; No more indention's or human shadows or even Ghost Lights.&nbsp;
It all finally stopped.</B>
<BR><B>But I actually miss the visits that I was getting from my Grandpa.&nbsp;
My Grandmother and Aunt Diane had just died.&nbsp; And we are going through
some family matters dealing with Aunt Diane's son.&nbsp; My mom said that
she could feel both my Grandmother and Aunts spirits with us.&nbsp; My
dad who never even spoke of any ghostly experiences said that he could
smell my Grandmother. She would always wear the same perfume everyday we
saw her.</B>
<BR><B>And now I am really starting to miss them all.&nbsp; But I'm afraid
if I do pray to God to let me see them one more time everything will start
up again.&nbsp; And I mean everything.&nbsp; Even the things I did not
mention in this e-mail.&nbsp; Terrible things.&nbsp; And I am also afraid
that I will not be able to deal with their loss.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Honeymoon Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: joie_77@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi Dave and Tina</B>
<BR><B>I would love to share this experience of a&nbsp; haunting I</B>
<BR><B>had with you during my honeymoon in 1982.Its endings</B>
<BR><B>will ,scare and suprise you.</B>
<BR><B>I had always loved Lousiana and wanted to visit</B>
<BR><B>someday when I grew up. My husband knew of my love and</B>
<BR><B>unbeknowst to me had purchased tickets for us to visit</B>
<BR><B>in May of 1982. We were only a young couple and I had</B>
<BR><B>originally thought we would not be able to afford a</B>
<BR><B>honeymoon. It was a different and unique vacation for</B>
<BR><B>me and would be packed with many surprises.</B>
<BR><B>I vividly remember the date of my experience as such</B>
<BR><B>things become engrainned in ones mind and seem to</B>
<BR><B>become more pronounced with time. It was May 28, 1982</B>
<BR><B>and a&nbsp; beautiful balmy Lousiana day with the sun</B>
<BR><B>shining and the heat in the nineties.There was a</B>
<BR><B>parade in the early morning in New Orleans which we</B>
<BR><B>attended , then my husband packed me up and told me we</B>
<BR><B>were going to a beautiful picknicking paradise that he</B>
<BR><B>had heard of from other toursits-a place called</B>
<BR><B>Frickies cave. This place was just outside of New</B>
<BR><B>orleans and was suppossed to be a beautiful oasis&nbsp; of</B>
<BR><B>nature and birds. It was. It was the most beautiful</B>
<BR><B>sight I have ever seen.</B>
<BR><B>We picknicked there unitl dusk when my husband decided</B>
<BR><B>to go for a&nbsp; walk.I followed him and began to feel</B>
<BR><B>uneasy as we walked along the banks.At that time I</B>
<BR><B>chalked it up to uneasiness of not knowing my</B>
<BR><B>environment.I began to feel an incredible sense of</B>
<BR><B>evil, desperate fear. He laughed and told me I&nbsp; was</B>
<BR><B>being silly. I begged him to go back and began packing</B>
<BR><B>up, he relented and headed back to the&nbsp; main</B>
<BR><B>picknicking area&nbsp; where we packed up and headed to the</B>
<BR><B>car.</B>
<BR><B>Whe we got to the car we realised we had spent the</B>
<BR><B>entire day there and that it was already 10:00pm !!!.</B>
<BR><B>We had tickets for a dinner and dance that evening at</B>
<BR><B>a hall in New Orleasn and did not want to miss it. My</B>
<BR><B>husband looked on our map and decided the best route</B>
<BR><B>to take to get to New Orleands the fastest wuld be</B>
<BR><B>along the banks of the Pontchartrin River which is</B>
<BR><B>only 30 minutes from the central Square in New Orleans</B>
<BR><B>where Mardi Gras is held each year.</B>
<BR><B>I was only to happy to get out of there becasue the</B>
<BR><B>feeling of fear I felt seemed to follow me right out</B>
<BR><B>to the truck.I had a feeling something bad had</B>
<BR><B>happened there,very bad.</B>
<BR><B>On the ride into New orleans I dismissed the fear and</B>
<BR><B>seemed to temporarily forget about it. As we entered</B>
<BR><B>one of the Parishes of Lousiana which hosted the</B>
<BR><B>Pontchatrin River&nbsp; I suddenly began feeling an</B>
<BR><B>incredible sense of fear again . I dont remember</B>
<BR><B>looking at the clock perse but it was most likely</B>
<BR><B>around 10:45 or so. Suddenly I felt someting or rather</B>
<BR><B>someone looking at me. Gliding along the side of our</B>
<BR><B>truck with her hands held open was the figure of this</B>
<BR><B>incrediby frightened women,she had terrible wounds it</B>
<BR><B>seemed and her face was etched with fear .My husband</B>
<BR><B>screamed and&nbsp; stepped on the gas. I dont remember</B>
<BR><B>hearing her say&nbsp; anything but feeling as though she</B>
<BR><B>was crying out for help, begging and pleading for</B>
<BR><B>help. She wasnt walking or running rather gliding and</B>
<BR><B>following us at an&nbsp; incredible pace, not humanly</B>
<BR><B>possible.</B>
<BR><B>I prayed to god to please help us please make her go</B>
<BR><B>away. I looked away not wanting to look at her</B>
<BR><B>terrible disfigurement. Suddenly I looked back&nbsp; and</B>
<BR><B>she was gone. I ddi a quick hail mary (being devout</B>
<BR><B>catholic) and breathed a sigh of relief. Needless to</B>
<BR><B>say we did not go to the dinner and dance that night.</B>
<BR><B>It took all my effort to convince my husband to not</B>
<BR><B>get on the next plane home.</B>
<BR><B>I have always been a curious person Tina so after my</B>
<BR><B>inital fear passed curiousity&nbsp; and the&nbsp; need to know</B>
<BR><B>what happend at Frickies cave, if anything happened-</B>
<BR><B>took over my fear. Iam a doctoral research fellow at</B>
<BR><B>my university so research is my expertise. I got up</B>
<BR><B>early th next day and headed out to the main library</B>
<BR><B>in the town. I asked for information on Frickies cave,</B>
<BR><B>history of the place and if any happenings had occured</B>
<BR><B>there in the last 100 years. The librarian looked at</B>
<BR><B>me and asked if I had heard of the Hathaway Murder. I</B>
<BR><B>said I&nbsp; had no idea. She told me that yesterday (May</B>
<BR><B>28_th) was the two year anniverary of the brutal</B>
<BR><B>slaying of an eigtheen year old woman found with her</B>
<BR><B>throat slit in Frickies cave. She found the archived</B>
<BR><B>article about the young girls murder. The next few</B>
<BR><B>things I will tell you are bound to freak you out.</B>
<BR><B>Faith Hathaway was an 18 year old girl who had just</B>
<BR><B>graduated from highschool days before. She had said</B>
<BR><B>good night to her mother before she left to say</B>
<BR><B>goodbye to some friends at a Disco&nbsp; as she was leaving</B>
<BR><B>to join the army. At around&nbsp; 9:30 she headed out and</B>
<BR><B>was kidnapped by two men along the Pontchatrin river</B>
<BR><B>and taken to Frickies cave where she was raped</B>
<BR><B>sodomized and murdered. The date? May 28 1980. A mere</B>
<BR><B>two years before my husband and I went pickniocking at</B>
<BR><B>Frickies cave. Coinicidence?I dont know but I can only</B>
<BR><B>explain the terrible negativity i felt that night and</B>
<BR><B>her frightened face. I have never forgotten this .It</B>
<BR><B>has stayed in my mind forever. I have no idea if her</B>
<BR><B>killer was ever brought to justice. If it hasnt</B>
<BR><B>perhaps she is still haunting Frickies cave? If anyone</B>
<BR><B>knows of this case please let me know.This has haunted</B>
<BR><B>me for 20 years you have no idea.I ask that you please</B>
<BR><B>put this on your website so anyone with any</B>
<BR><B>information could perhaps contact me.</B>
<BR><B>I truly hope her soul is at peace!!.</B>
<BR><B>Thankyou for letting me share Tina and Dave.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Personal Weird Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: taxmun@maltanet.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am Timothy . Once, during summer, quite a while ago, I had a very
strange experience. Truly, I thought it was one of the strangest things
that happened to me. Probably, (like everyone but myself) you will think
it had some explanation. It might have, but I can see none. Here is my
story:</B>
<BR><B>I was at my great aunt’s apartment, and my age was around 10at that
time (I’m 12 now). My great aunt lives next to a broken down, abandoned
house, with a courtyard filled with weeds. From the floor where my aunt
lived, you had a very good view of the place. My cousin Niki Caruana, my
sister Alexandra Alden, and me myself were talking about ghosts and, of
course, making it all sound weird, with talk of old floating ladies. That
was all rubbish of course. Now comes the real thing.</B>
<BR><B>Nik and I closed the curtains of my aunt’s room, overlooking the
broken down house, and we made sure that there was NO light.</B>
<BR><B>We waited for the unexpected. The unexpected really did come. Believe
it or not, in the lightless room, I thought I saw a purple light, slightly
shaped like a skeleton without legs, or a proper shape. I do not really
know what it looked like, because I could not describe it. In the corner
of the room, near the shut door it hovered. Somehow I was not exactly scared,
just mystified. Seriously, I had no idea what was going on. Then I got
up, and it vanished. If my cousin had not said he saw the same thing, I
would have said it was my imagination. To make sure he was not lying, I
got paper, and told him to draw it if he really saw it. So if the drawing
did not resemble what I saw, it would mean he was lying. Surprisingly,
his drawing of a floating purple light, shaped like a disabled skeleton
was what I saw. So we both had seen the thing. Alight, maybe it was just
something explainable, but I cannot think of anything. How could I have
imagined it if my cousin saw it and drew it?</B>
<BR><B>Just because I was quite young when I saw the light, does not mean
I am a liar. I was born at midnight…</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; My Shadow-</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: thanh_lili@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I came over to the US in 1990, when i was 7 years old. we were lucky
to have some friends over here that we used to know in Vietnam. one of
my parents friend let us rent thier house. the house was on a corner of
a busy street and in the "projects" area, but the house looks very decent
and clean. after a year of living there i start to see a shadow (to be
exact, 6ft tall shadow) on the corner of my eyes. it appear everywhere
in the house. i was so afraid that i told my parents, they didnt believe
me of course. on and on i would see the shadow unexpectedly and everytime
i have a glimps of it, my heart would stop for about 2 seconds. we live
there for four years, i've complained about the shadow so much that my
parents brought me to a psychaitrist. of course that didnt help me very
much.</B>
<BR><B>we later moved to another house. i never saw the shadow again. after
living at the second house for a year or so, my parents divorced, me and
my siblings live with our mom. again, we move to a different house, this
time i saw the shadow again. the same 6ft tall shadow. but i didnt tell
anyone. there's something special about this house, it's just a block away
from a cemetery that dates back to the 1700s. in this house, the shadow
makes itself noticable to every member of my family, even to guests. our
house is a bit small, from the living room you can overlook the hallway
that leads to three bedrooms. my bedroom was in the middle. likewise i
was the first to see the shadow. it would appear at my mom's bedroom, and
would make a quick dash over to my room. in this ho e, it's the only place
that i saw it. by now i'm so used to seeing it that it didnt bother me.
sometimes i would feel safe just to know that it's there. so i keep quite
about the shadows for some months, until my little brother and sister saw
it too. reminder that i didnt tell anyone about seeing the shadow over
at this house. i caught thier reaction when we were watching tv in the
living, they turn thier head towards the hallway with "what was THAT?!"
look. later my boyfriend would come over and same scenario. but he wasn't
sure what he saw, so he told me "your little sisters are entering your
room again" (knowing that i HATE my siblings going in my room) so i march
into my room and yelled out "get outta my room!" to realize that they were
playing video games in my mom's room. more and more the shadow would make
itself visible. it was then that my mom realize that i was telling the
truth, there was a shadow that was following me!</B>
<BR><B>and so it followed me until i'm 20 years old (present) it only appeard
when i least expected it too, and never did any harm. for the past year
it surprise me by answering my prayers. instead of praying to god, i ask
the shadow for help, told the shadow my feelings and asking for guidance.
i later called the shadow My Shadow. my heart doesn't stop or skip anymore
when i see it. but there are times when my heart does, and everytime that
it does, it's telling me that something bad is about to happen.....</B>
<BR><B>recently my mom told us about our grandma (dad's side), it's awkward
to hear about her until now, because we dont have any picture of her, nor
hear my dad talks about her when we were little, we dont even know her
name! overall she's a mystery for me and my siblings. my mom told us that
she's very tall and slim, in ALL of her grandchildren I was her favorite
because i LOOK like her. my mom also told us of an incident, a few months
before we were to left for the states my grandma stop by to visit us (she
live five hours away from us) what she said startled my mom, she id she
will be joining ME over to the US. a month later my grandma dies.</B>
<BR><B>my little brother ask my mom what she looks like, my mom looks at
me and says, 'exactly like your sister'</B>
<BR><B>we all think the shadow that had followed me throughout these years
is my grandma. and oh, i know her name now, i had her name....</B>

<P><B>Prominent Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: NotToFallVictim@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Reading through these stories have brought back a lot of memories
for me that I've tried to supress for years.&nbsp; It hasn't been easy,
and I've become more comfortable with talking about them as time goes on.&nbsp;
I've had strange things happen every since I was very little, I believe
starting around the age of 2 or 3.&nbsp; I used to have awkward nightmares
for a child that age, one where the devil was chasing after me and every
time I woke up and went back to sleep (no matter how long I stayed up for)
the dream would start right back up.&nbsp; I had tried to dispell a lot
of my experiences as a result of over-active imagination or physiological/scientific
explanations.</B>
<BR><B>As a young child, my bestfriend and I would play with the ouija
board relentlessly.&nbsp; We often went into my closet if it was day out
and light candles for light to play.&nbsp; We had some awkward moments
in there.&nbsp; One time, just as the indicator began to move, all 3 or
4 of the candles blew out at once and it became cold in the closet.&nbsp;
She was easily scared, but for some reason she found that episode humorous.
We often "spoke" with my brother who had died in a car accident 8 years
prior to my birth.&nbsp; I had always felt some strange connection to him.</B>
<BR><B>I've been surrounded by a large number of deaths, starting at age
4, when a best friend of my sister and mine died.&nbsp; That has spiraled
into 25+ deaths (I'm only 22).&nbsp; I've always seemed to know when someone
was about to die.&nbsp; I begin having these thoughts about people I know
dying.&nbsp; They usually consist of how this person dies, how I'm told,
and how I feel about it.&nbsp; The catch is, they're never the people that
actually die, I just have these thoughts and then someone always seems
to die.&nbsp; My grandmother was in the hospital and deathly ill.&nbsp;
My father and I visited every day for her last several days.&nbsp; My sister
was uneasy about going, and one day I knew she had to go.&nbsp; That it
was going to be her last chance.&nbsp; It wasn't until that day that I
finally say "good bye".&nbsp; We got a call that morning and she had passed
away.&nbsp; I had thoughts of my father having a serious heart attack.&nbsp;
A couple of weeks later, his only sister had a heart attack.</B>
<BR><B>I was an awkward child and teenager.&nbsp; I used to sleep in my
closet for a period of time with tons of blankets and pillows (it was a
walk in closet).&nbsp; I was on the phone with a friend.&nbsp; Suddenly
I heard a male voice from behind me (where only a wall was) tell me to
get out.&nbsp; My friend on the other line asked who that was.&nbsp; That
confirmed it wasn't my imagination, as she had heard it too without my
mentioning it.&nbsp; Of course, I never slept in there again.</B>
<BR><B>There was always a dark figure at the bottom of our stairwell.&nbsp;
I never spoke of it, until two friends of mine mentioned it.&nbsp; They
came forward one night and mentioned how scared they were of my house.&nbsp;
I'd always feel like I was being chased up my stairs, but believed it was
only my fear that mad me run.&nbsp; Then again I remember always feeling
a presence at my back.&nbsp; Our TV would turn off and on.&nbsp; I was
making coffee in the kitchen and a friend was at my side, we were alone.&nbsp;
Spontaneously a cap flew off a medicine bottle and landed all the way at
the other side of the counter (about 3 feet).&nbsp; We sat there stunned,
confirmed the other had seen it, and ran to my room.&nbsp; We had a few
dogs over my 13 1/2 years living there (my parents still live there).&nbsp;
They all would flip out and bark and growl at unseen things.&nbsp; Sometimes
for a few minutes, sometimes for half an hour or so, and we could never
find the source to their discontent.&nbsp; I've had episodes of my bed
shaking.&nbsp; I've also experienced the paralysis several times and once
recently.&nbsp; It's so terrifying, you feel your mind is perfectly awake,
but you feel weighted down, you fight to move or scream but can't do anything.&nbsp;
It's like your body has become a lead weight.&nbsp; I believe that is why
I have a terrible phobia of being held down.&nbsp; Lastly, in regard to
the house.&nbsp; Our dog at the time was flipping out, barking at something
around the dining/kitchen area.&nbsp; He must have gone off for over half
an hour.&nbsp; My mother and I attempted to move everything in the area
to try to come to the source of his displeasure and nothing helped.&nbsp;
I finally tried to sleep, then began these voices overhead.&nbsp; It was
almost like a good vs. evil fight over me.&nbsp; The word that comes to
mind here is 'thunderous,' that's the best description of it.&nbsp; Finally,
it was like the good won and all became quiet and things started to calm
down around our house, though they haven't completely quit.&nbsp; As a
side note, this is a relatively new house.&nbsp; We are the first owners
who've ever lived in it.</B>
<BR><B>I will tie this down with mentioning a few more inexplicable experiences.&nbsp;
At my grandmother's, who lived in an old house, built in the early 1900s,
I was having trouble sleeping.&nbsp; My sister and I shared a bed.&nbsp;
I turned over and looked up and right next to my sister at the side of
the bed was a ghost of an older woman in old fashioned (earlier frontier
style) clothing with her hair loosely tied into a bun.&nbsp; I was momentarily
frozen by fear and then quickly turned over and closed my eyes and refused
to open them again and finally fell asleep.&nbsp; I was at a movies theatre
watching a movie with my bestfriend in a nearly empty theatre.&nbsp; I
saw a young boy, short, medium brown hair, clothes fashioning the 50's.&nbsp;
He was 'standing' on a seat in the middle row (we were towards the back)
and he was facing us.&nbsp; I then saw him again outside the movie theatre
in the empty building next to it.&nbsp; She didn't see it though.&nbsp;
Maybe I was seeing things that night, but it was so real and still burnt
into my memory.&nbsp; My heart races as I recall this one.</B>
<BR><B>Those are some of my most prominent experiences.&nbsp; I am not
a person who believes in a god or anything religious.&nbsp; I feel I am
a very grounded, realistic person.&nbsp; I've fought for a reasonable scientific
or psychological reasoning to all of this.&nbsp; But, ultimately, I haven't
found any feasible explanation.&nbsp; I'm beginning to have experiences
at my apartment, and I live 2000 miles away from where I grew up and that
house.&nbsp; I've been in this apartment for two years now and it's all
seeming to just be starting.&nbsp; Am I sensitive to these sort of things?&nbsp;
Are these real?&nbsp; Do any of you know what all these means?&nbsp; Do
I have a psychological problem?&nbsp; All I know is I don't want this to
continue. I don't want to deal with sleepless nights as I did as a child
(they drove me to become an insomniac).</B><B></B>

<BR><B>When I was Young</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: hummadufferblue@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I don't remember this, since I was only four years old, but my mother
tells</B>
<BR><B>me this story all the time.</B>
<BR><B>My great-grandfather died on Hallowe'en in 1988.&nbsp; He lived
in Scotland, and</B>
<BR><B>although there was a great distance between them, he and my mother
had a</B>
<BR><B>really strong bond between them.&nbsp; I can vividly remember my
mother getting</B>
<BR><B>the call about his death, because I was so excited about going out
trick or</B>
<BR><B>treating, and seeing my mom crying on the phone really upset me.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, according to my mom, about a week after she got back from
Scotland</B>
<BR><B>for his funeral, she was cleaning the house and was walking past
my room</B>
<BR><B>when she heard me talking.&nbsp; She found it odd that I would be
playing with my</B>
<BR><B>door closed since having it that way frightened me, so she opened
it up and</B>
<BR><B>looked in.&nbsp;&nbsp; From her description, I was sitting on the
edge of my bed</B>
<BR><B>facing my dresser and talking to thin air.&nbsp; She thought this
was weird, so</B>
<BR><B>she asked me: "Katie, who are you talking to?".&nbsp; She says that
I was</B>
<BR><B>startled, but I promptly and simply (like it was obvious) answered
"Great</B>
<BR><B>Papa" and pointed at the dresser.&nbsp; This took my mother back
for a second,</B>
<BR><B>but she finally said "I see, well, what is Great Papa saying?"&nbsp;
She says I</B>
<BR><B>looked her in the eye and with a straight face answered "He says
that he</B>
<BR><B>loves me, and that he loves you too."&nbsp; My mom says she cryed
in her room for</B>
<BR><B>hours that night.</B>
<BR><B>What I find special about this story is that my first memory is
of a visit</B>
<BR><B>with my Great Grandparents in Scotland when I was two, and what
I distinctly</B>
<BR><B>remember is playing with my Great Papa.&nbsp; I find it touching
that he would</B>
<BR><B>have chosen me to give my mother this message.</B>

<P><B>Over and Over</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: AmberE1012@yahoo.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Well, this is just one of the encounters I have come accross in my
life.&nbsp; Not so much of a story as things that happened when I was a
child.&nbsp; Now they are a little less foward with contactingme.</B>
<BR><B>When I was from ages 10 until 13 or so, the same thing happened
to me over and over.&nbsp; I go to sleep at night, and I would keep on
waking up in the middle of the night.&nbsp; You know how you can feel someone
looking at you, well I always had that feeling.&nbsp; When I would wake
up there would be a man standing over the foot of my bed just watchingme.&nbsp;
I am getting chills just thinking about it.&nbsp; he was wearing a top
hat and a long london fog type coat.&nbsp; I never made out a face, I just
always knew he was kind,&nbsp; and wasnt scared.&nbsp; I would just go
back to sleep.&nbsp; Only to be woken up by someone smaking me on the top
of my head or grabbing my toes.&nbsp; This terrified me, and to this day,
I will not go to sleep unless my feet are tucked in and my head is against
the wall.&nbsp; I never could see anyone there but I would still feel the
presence and feel thenm tugging on me.&nbsp; Very scary things for a child
to encounter.</B>
<BR><B>I have lots of stories to tell.&nbsp; However I am at work and will
have to write more later.&nbsp; Also, I have strong preminitions.&nbsp;
I am not sure what they mean, along with extreemly colorful dreams that
have places in it that I dream about over and over and then one day I meet
the person. Or see them on the street.&nbsp; I have a lot to talk about
on this subject, and hope to hear from you guys soon.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Nursing Home Haunting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: k_hayati@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>At the nursing home for the elderly I work at, it always seemed odd
to me that we can go several months without any deaths, then, without warning,
we will be hit with several losses within a short period of time. (Sometimes
having five deaths in the space of a few weeks).</B>
<BR><B>I always believed that this was just due to an illness being spread
among the residents that the weaker cannot survive. However, I found it
quite odd when having lost a couple of residents ina&nbsp; short period
of time, one of the staff members I worked with said "looks like death
is back again."</B>
<BR><B>When I asked her to explain, she said that according to rumors,
there was a ghost that would come and take the lives of the residents in
groups of 4 or 5.&nbsp; I dismissed this as nonsense. Afterall, there were
far more logical explanations for the deaths of the residents.</B>
<BR><B>A couple of weeks later, I overheard a friend's mum (who works at
the nursing home) sharing an experience she had had a couple of nights
before. Now, I never saw this for myself, so I'm in no place to judge whether
what happened or not was real, but I will tell you what I heard:</B>
<BR><B>During the night shift at the home, things can be slow. The residents
are asleep, so there is often little to do. In the lounge area, my friends
mum, Mary, was talking to another carer to pass the time. They were sharing
a joke over a cup of tea when Mary noticed the lights go out in the corridor.
Assuming that the cause of this was just a resident wandering the corridors
and playing with the switch.</B>
<BR><B>She headed into the corridor and switched the lights on. There was
no body to be seen. She took a look around the area to make sure that there
was no resident wandering the corridors lost. After confirming the coast
was clear, she headed back to the lounge area and continued to talk to
her friend.</B>
<BR><B>About five minutes later, the same thing happened. The lights went
out in the corridor, and then when they were switched on, there was no-one
to be seen. Again, Mary sat down and chatted to her friends dismissing
the incidents as someone having a joke.</B>
<BR><B>When it happened for the third time, Mary was understandably beginning
to get annoyed. As soon as the lights went off, she ran through and switched
the lights on. However, this time, she was not faced with an empty room.
Down the corridor, she swears she saw a shadow slipping into the room of
one of the residents.</B>
<BR><B>Mary knew that whoever was doing it, it couldn't have been the person
in that room, because she had a wheelchair and therefore could not have
possibly gotten back to her room that quickly. She ran to the lady's room
to get whoever went into her room out.</B>
<BR><B>When she entered the room, there was nothing to be seen. Just to
old lady, sleeping peacefully in her room. Mary said she didn't feel right
just leaving it at that, because she saw the shadow enter her room, clear
as day. She turned on the lights and searched the room only to find nothing.
By this point, the resident had awoken. Mary asked her if she was feeling
alright. The woman said she felt fine, and so Mary let her get back to
sleep.</B>
<BR><B>The shift continued as normal, until it was time to get the residents
up. Mary says she was getting the tables set for breakfast when her colleage
came through and told her what had happened. The woman who'd had the shadow
Mary saw go into her room had died in her sleep.</B>
<BR><B>Now, I don't know whether to believe this or whether it was just
a coincidence, but if there's one thing that's for sure, Mary is certain
of what she saw...</B><B></B>

<P><B>Pounding in my House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: WFDmonson@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Me and my friend were alone at my house just hanging out and he stayed
over night.&nbsp; We were playing with my cat.&nbsp; I have heard that
animals can see or sense paranormal stuff.&nbsp; We heard a loud pound
downstairs, so we went down to check it out.&nbsp; We did not find anything
but while we were looking my friend heard a newspaper slap against the
table.&nbsp; We went upstairs to find to newspaper spread all over the
table.&nbsp; My cat was freaking out staring in different places like there
was someone walking around supstairs.&nbsp; We walked to the entry way
to go back downstairs to my room and lound, violent pounding started happeneding
upstairs like there was someone running around and knocking on the walls,
or 2 people fighting.&nbsp; We were too scared to leave the kitchen so
we slept in the kitchen til my parents got home and everything stopped
after that.&nbsp; That is not the first time something like that has happened,
to this day things still happen to me like that, like doors opening or
hearing people walking around.&nbsp; I was even chased once.&nbsp; But
that is my story about the pounding in my house</B><B></B>

<P><B>Kingston, NY Experiences</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: berkut69@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Kingston, NY</B>
<BR><B>1982-1984</B><B></B>

<P><B>Although the local historical society had no records on this, I am
almost certain that the house I moved into in 1982 had or has a marker
indicating that it was a historical landmark.&nbsp; I was under the impression
that it was part of the original stockade during the Revolutionary War
but I was not able to substantiate this. My search in January of 1984 for
some background information on the house was prompted by a series of unusual
events in 1982-1984.</B>
<BR><B>When I moved into the house in late 1982, I immediately felt at
home although the apartment was perpetually dark. The darkness was due
to the geography of the house in that the only windows faced north and
the bedroom’s southern exposure was limited because of trees. No matter
the time of day, a light would need to be on in the downstairs but there
was nothing ominous or scary about this.&nbsp; As I said, I felt very comfortable
there.</B>
<BR><B>In contrast, the upstairs was well lit but was the most intimidating,
spookiest place and I dreaded going there. It was only used for storage
since there was no heat or electric although it appeared to have been living
quarters at some point. I think what made it eerie was the faded wallpaper
and old style linoleum and you would get the sense that it had been children’s
bedrooms because of the size and decor. It consisted of one long room and
two smaller rooms to your left as you reached the top of the stairs. My
memory of the upstairs was that if I needed something from storage, it
would have to wait until daylight. No way would I go up there at night.
Also, in the two years that I lived there, I never set foot into either
small room and never even looked into the second room. I was a man in my
mid-twenties and not given to fantasies but upstairs I would get the sense
that someone was waiting to jump out at me.</B>
<BR><B>The description of the upstairs has nothing to do with my experiences
in the apartment but is necessary to get the feel for the house and my
mindset. I should stress that my discomfort about the upstairs did not
carry over into my daily living and I never put any thought into upstairs
unless I had to go up there. Basically, I loved living there since I was
two blocks from work, shopping and bars that I frequented. Life was good.</B>
<BR><B>On those rare occasions that I would spend the evening at home,
I would be ready to sleep about 11:00 and go to bed. From my first night
there, I would lay in bed wide-awake and be unable to drop off. The only
thoughts or feelings I had at the time was that I just wasn’t tired anymore
and went back to the living room which usually resulted in my falling asleep
in front of the TV soon afterwards. There was not a feeling of insomnia
just that I was awake and alert. It became routine that unless my girlfriend
spent the night or I had been out partying and could fall asleep easily,
I would just sleep on the couch since sleep in my bed was hard to come
by.</B>
<BR><B>On one of those evenings that I fell asleep in front of the TV,
I awoke in the middle of the night to static/snow on the TV channel I had
been watching. I didn’t find this unusual since any little interference
affects cable reception whether it’s the weather or equipment failure or
whatever. I got up to turn off the TV and found that the coaxial cable
to the back of the TV had been unscrewed and was lying in the middle of
the living room. I had been living there for several months and if it had
been improperly connected I probably would have lost reception before I
did. In addition, the cable was in the middle of the living room. It didn’t
just fall behind the TV. I reinserted the cable and reception returned.</B>
<BR><B>Several weeks later, I woke in the morning to get ready for work.
After showering and shaving, I dressed and reached into my closet to get
my dress shoes. I picked them up only to find that they had been filled
with water. I was shocked and tried to apply some logic as to how this
could happen. A roof leak? No, I remembered there was a second story plus
there was no splashing around the shoes as there should be if water dripped
into them. Was it something other than water? Uh Oh. But no, I poured the
liquid into the bathroom sink and it was definitely water. To this day
I don’t know how this happened.</B>
<BR><B>Sometime later, weeks or months, I’m not sure, I was awakened by
the phone ringing about 5:00 A.M. It was my landlord who lived next door
asking me if I had water running because the gutter in the street was filled
with flowing water. I checked the bathroom and sure enough, I found that
the cold water was on full blast. I avoided telling my landlord the truth
and explained it as the toilet running. How long the water was on, who
knows except that it was long enough to be running in the street. Could
I have left it on accidentally the night before? Unlikely. This would be
another unsolved mystery.</B>
<BR><B>When I moved in I had two 10 gallon aquariums with a variety of
tropical fish mostly of the cheaper and sturdier type. There were even
2 fish that a friend had given me two years prior when he moved away. They
were all well and thriving. My routine was to walk in the front door after
work and turn on the aquarium lights and feed the fish since the tanks
were right next to the door. I did this because they were in the living
room which was dark during the day as I have mentioned. The last thing
I did at night was to turn the aquarium lights off. One morning on my way
to work, I went to the door to leave when I noticed a horrible odor and
it appeared to be coming from the fish tanks. I turned on the lights and
saw that all the fish were dead and the water was very cloudy. I was flabbergasted.
It had only been about seven hours since I turned the lights off and the
fish were fine. What could have caused this? I had fish for a few years
and of course some die but I had never seen an aquarium of fish die overnight
especially since there were different kinds and size of fish. The smell
was so bad that I didn’t dare leave it until that night and I had to take
the day off to clean the odor and mess.</B>
<BR><B>Some time later, again I’m not sure how long, I found out that I
would be relocating to Rochester, NY and was preparing to move going through
clothes, utensils, etc. All day long I was going from the living room through
the kitchen into the bedroom and back making many trips. On one of these
trips I stepped into a small puddle of water in the kitchen. How could
this be since the kitchen was about 8’ X 8’ and I was on my umpteenth trip
through the kitchen. The room was so small that the refrigerator was outside
the kitchen near the back door. Here though was a puddle of water about
5 inches in diameter and again I tried to explain it like the other things
and came up empty. I wasn’t drinking water to spill it, no roof leak etc.</B>
<BR><B>The only other thing I found strange was the coldness of the linen
closet. From the time I moved in until I moved out, the closet was noticeably
colder than the bedroom which I found very strange since the other side
of the closet was my landlord’s apartment. Because he was in his eighties,
he always kept both our places warm. It always stayed cold in the closet
even though I kept the door open to warm it. The alternative was to dry
off after a shower with an ice cold towel.</B>
<BR><B>It wasn’t until the end of my residency that all these incidents
came together and out of curiosity I tried to do some research on the building.
Some people may wonder how I could live there with all the things that
went on and the only explanation I have is that at the time they were separate
incidents and I never dwelt on any of them and never made any connection.
It never occurred to me that all the things (except the TV cable) were
water related and I don’t recall tying any of these events together to
indicate a general trend.</B>
<BR><B>Believe me, I am not the bravest person and if I had seen anything
supernatural I would have left immediately never to return. Even now, I
have to almost think that there must be rational explanation because I
am not convinced by any measure that there are really such things as ghosts.
I loved living there and if I hadn’t had a job transfer, I might still
be there.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I once saw a ghost or a supernatural being. I was walking to my room,
and I heard a strange sound. It was my cat meowing furiously. I checked
to see where he was. He was in my closet. I didn't know what it was meowing
at, I figured it was a mouse. When I opened the door, there was a Native-American
man, with glowing red eyes, and a glowing red bow and arrow. I was scared
so I ran. I've never seen it again. –</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Finally an answer</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Margmcdo@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was around six years old, I took a shortcut through some woods
with a friend of mine.&nbsp; I had never been through those woods before
that time, but I knew they ended.&nbsp; In the middle of the woods, for
some reason, I looked back to see a small house and a man dressed almost
like a pirate wearing a mask, and holding some kind of a sword or blade
of some kind.&nbsp; He started chasing me and I yelled to my friend to
run because someone was chasing us.&nbsp; She ran, but she didn't see anyone
chasing us.&nbsp; When we got out of the woods, I looked back and saw nothing
but those beautiful woods, not looking fearful in the least.&nbsp; My father
laughed when I told him about that scary experience, that only I had seen.&nbsp;
He was sure it was due to my vivid imagination.&nbsp; Over the years when
I think of it, I have wondered what it could have been.&nbsp; After reading
the "Shadowlands Haunted Places", the Clinton - George Hill example, I'm
sure I must have seen a ghost!&nbsp; But my ghost appeared&nbsp; in Canonsburg,
in western Pennsylvania, not in Connecticut.&nbsp; It only took 76 years

<P><B>The Beautiful Woman</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: whiteelk12@charter.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I work noc shift as an RN in a hospital.&nbsp; One noc I was sitting
by the desk and I saw a beautiful woman walk past the desk.&nbsp; I realized
that we only had male pts. on the floor and we are on a locked unit.&nbsp;
I immediately jumped up to follow the woman when she went "thru the wall."&nbsp;
I recognized her as a pt. I took care of many years before.&nbsp; What
she wanted I don't know.&nbsp; She had a white night gown on</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Beginning</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: chrism@acton.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My first experience with a ghost occurred when I was 10 years old.&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>event occurred the day of my Grandmother's funeral.&nbsp; It was
about 5:00 a.m.,</B>
<BR><B>and I was sleeping in the bedroom I usually occupied when visiting
my</B>
<BR><B>Grandparent's home in Windsor, CO.&nbsp; I remember coming out of
a deep sleep,</B>
<BR><B>because I felt something gently touching my right forearm (the side
away</B>
<BR><B>from the wall in the bedroom).&nbsp; I felt like I had to pry my
eyes open, but</B>
<BR><B>when I opened them no one was with me.&nbsp; What I did notice was
a very strange</B>
<BR><B>light coming, I thought, from the bathroom next door to my room.&nbsp;
I tried to</B>
<BR><B>remember if I'd gotten up in the middle of the night and had forgotten
to</B>
<BR><B>turn the light off.&nbsp; I sat up in bed and started to get up
to go turn that</B>
<BR><B>light off, when I heard someone in the hallway crying.&nbsp; I expected
it to be</B>
<BR><B>my Mother, but the more I focused in I realized that the person
I was</B>
<BR><B>looking at was my Grandmother, and I could see the wallpaper design
on the</B>
<BR><B>opposite wall through her.&nbsp; She was wearing one of her favorite
dresses, not</B>
<BR><B>the one I knew my Grandfather had taken to the funeral home.&nbsp;
She then spoke</B>
<BR><B>to me, saying, "Chrissy, I am so lonely.&nbsp; I am just so lonely.&nbsp;
I don't want</B>
<BR><B>to be away from you."&nbsp; Then, she started to cry again.&nbsp;
My brain finally</B>
<BR><B>clicked, and I was horrified.&nbsp; I remember pounding the wall
that separated</B>
<BR><B>my bedroom from the room my parents were sleeping in.&nbsp; As I
did that, I</B>
<BR><B>finally was able to regain use of my vocal chords and started to
scream for</B>
<BR><B>my Mother.&nbsp; Of course, the household rushed into my room and
everyone was</B>
<BR><B>very alarmed.&nbsp; I was crying by then, and while my Mom was trying
to comfort</B>
<BR><B>me, my Grandfather was furious with me, feeling like I'd blasphemed
my</B>
<BR><B>Grandmother with all this uproar.&nbsp; I cried harder, and tried
to tell him,</B>
<BR><B>tell them all, I was not making this up, and it wasn't a bad dream.</B>
<BR><B>Nevertheless, being adults they were convinced it was a dream and
that I was</B>
<BR><B>upset because Grandma's funeral would be in a few hours.&nbsp; Everyone
left the</B>
<BR><B>room, and after sitting there crying for a few minutes, I finally
layed down</B>
<BR><B>and closed my eyes.&nbsp; I felt my Grandmother move past me, touching
my arm as</B>
<BR><B>she left the room through the window over my right shoulder.&nbsp;
I had no idea</B>
<BR><B>that this would not be the last time I would encounter her.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Book</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:MAXandALEX09@webtv.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>About two years ago I was haunted by my granddaddy Kent's ghost....In</B>
<BR><B>2001 my grandad died I was his favorite grandkid...well one night
a book</B>
<BR><B>of mine that my grandad used to read to me fell&nbsp; off the shelf
in the</B>
<BR><B>hall and my room was in beside the shelf so when I heard the thud
come</B>
<BR><B>from the antique bookshelf I got up out of bed to see what had happened</B>
<BR><B>thinking that a robber was in the house and so trying to be brave
like i</B>
<BR><B>brought my sleeping bag down from yhe hall closet wit a flash-light
and</B>
<BR><B>a Edgar Allen Poe book but before I had got the chance to open the
cover</B>
<BR><B>of my sleeping bag a noticed a quick movement from the corner of
my eye</B>
<BR><B>and quickly grabbed my flash-light ready to swing at random and
all of a</B>
<BR><B>sudden looking toward the hall noticed the page of the fallen book
flip</B>
<BR><B>ten pages ahead now you might think the reason for the page flipping
was</B>
<BR><B>of the air conditioner or something ,but five minutes later I realized</B>
<BR><B>it could be a paranormal force so not long after it stopped I</B>
<BR><B>said"GRANDADDY IF YOU LOVE ME THEN FLIP TWO PAGES",and it did then
I</B>
<BR><B>said "GRANDADDY IF THATS YOU THEN MAKE THE BOOK CLOSE",and it did
then</B>
<BR><B>half freaked out half realived it wasn't a robber put my things
away</B>
<BR><B>ready to get back in my bed and on my way back from the closet&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>stopped dead in my tracks there on the floor was a picture of him
and my</B>
<BR><B>sister and I on the floor and the next morning I was going to readthe</B>
<BR><B>book when I looked up I screamed My mum came rushing in and asked
what</B>
<BR><B>had happened so I lied and said I had stepped on a sewing needle
my mum</B>
<BR><B>bought it but my sister knew the difference in my screams,so that
night</B>
<BR><B>after the lights went out my sister snuck in my room begged to find
out</B>
<BR><B>why so I had made her swear not to tell and told her exactly what
had</B>
<BR><B>happened that night and she said but why on earth did you scream
and I</B>
<BR><B>said when I reached up for the book it wasn't there so I stood on
my</B>
<BR><B>pile of school books and looked over it and saw that the booked
was</B>
<BR><B>missing</B>

<BR><B>"The Dude"</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: GryDragon6@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>whats up shadowlands.&nbsp; my name is Tony and i just sent an email
stating a previous experience of mine, which reminded me of another.&nbsp;
i am loaded with stories.&nbsp; this one is a bit more personal, as it
involves my apartment.&nbsp; i moved into the second floor of this building,
not knowing why it is the only 2 decker on a street of 3 deckers.&nbsp;
there is a 3rd doorway on my floor that i thought was just a closet.&nbsp;
my landlord informed me it is the stairway leading to what used to be the
3rd floor.&nbsp; a few years ago someone fell asleep with a lit cigarette,
thus igniting the building.&nbsp; only the 3rd floor burned, and killed
the occupant.&nbsp; when i first moved in, i noticed an overwhelming sense
of dread in my kitchen.&nbsp; being a paranormal buff i was ecstatic to
learn i moved into a haunted place.&nbsp; i spent a lot of time talking
to it and making it feel comfortable that i was willing to except it.&nbsp;
since i have done so, the malevolent feeling is gone.&nbsp; he is more
or less a roommate, dubbed "The Dude".&nbsp; he just makes his presence
known.&nbsp; my faucet turns on and off, the refrigerator door is always
opening, the tv turns off, packs of cigarettes end up missing, things like
that.&nbsp; a while ago i ran into some money issues and was in peril of
being evicted.&nbsp; i worked it out and walked into my kitchen telling
"The Dude" that i wasnt being evicted so he wouldnt have to worry about
some new person moving in.&nbsp; my statement was replied with a whispered
"awesome".&nbsp; my friend Clayton was sitting watching tv and someone
was blowing on his ear, and just last night i was sitting at the computer
and i looked into the living room and saw a big wisp of what looked like
cigarette smoke.&nbsp; all of my friends call me crazy because i speak
to him like he is part of my crew.</B><B></B>

<P><B>In my old house, before my mom and room mate and I moved in, and
old man and his wife lived there He was out one day and the old woman had
a heart attack and died, right there in the house. he called the emergency
room when he got home, but it was too late...now sometimes when youre in
the house, you'll turn and see an old woman, in a house dress and bare
feet, with short hair.. she'll disappear after a few seconds.&nbsp; when
I would have friends stay over at the house, and we watched movies, when
we were done we would trun off everything in the living room, move stuff
around, then go back to my room and wait. after about 15 minutes we would
go back out into the living room and the tv would be on, the vcr going,
and the movie playing.. the coffee table would be messed up, like some
one was sitting at it; stuff like that..thing is, we DIDNT rewind the movie,
we left it sitting in the Vcr slot but not&nbsp; going, and we had moved
the coffee table!&nbsp; It was such an awesome experience, I'll never forget
it!</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Voice</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: dot.hacksign456@sbcglobal.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Here is my story of a ghost that came for a whisper to a lond shout
that could be heard next door! My mom and I were getting the table ready
for dinner when we both heard a man's voice say very softly "That is wrong".
I was so scared. But my mom calmed me down and we went back to putting
the plates,forks,and knifes on the table. The next day was even worse.
The whole family was sitting just minding their own bussness until we all
heard "Stop it! You are hurting me" just as plain as the nose on your face.
We went into the room that the sound was coming from and found it to be
so cold ( This is in early August). The next day was the last day and the
worst. My brother and I were playing Candy Land when I heard a loud yell
as if someone had taken our house and kept shaking it! I was crying and
my brother would not let go of me. My mom and dad told us all to get downstairs
to try to run from whatever was in our house. It was cold all over and
I crabbed all of my fuzziest blankets. Finally it stopped and we came unstairs
to find everything in bits and pieces.-</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;Haunted Church and Others</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: WENDYEDWIN@webtv.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>HAUNTED CHURCH</B>
<BR><B>I work for a Senior Center located in a very old church. The church
is</B>
<BR><B>like a castle with many hidden places. One day while I was alone,
late</B>
<BR><B>afternoon, I was sitting at my computer and looked up to see a man</B>
<BR><B>standing in front of me. I told him I would be "right with him in
a</B>
<BR><B>minute" and when I looked up from my computer again---he slowly
vanished</B>
<BR><B>right before my eyes.</B>
<BR><B>I told this story to several seniors and co-workers, etc...no takers,
so</B>
<BR><B>to speak. Although everyone who really knows me is aware that I
have an</B>
<BR><B>affinity for ghosts and premonitons.</B>
<BR><B>So, several days ago I was calling Bingo for a group of seniors.
They</B>
<BR><B>were playing for a "full card"---the entire cards must be covered
with</B>
<BR><B>bingo chips to win.</B>
<BR><B>I excused myself to go get a cup of coffee from the kitchen. I was</B>
<BR><B>absent for about 4 or 5 minutes.</B>
<BR><B>I returned and began calling again--saying "I only have a few numbers</B>
<BR><B>left to call....isn't anyone close to winning?" The whole group
was in</B>
<BR><B>disbelief. In my abence ----about 10 bingo balls had been placed
on the</B>
<BR><B>calling board. The caller's table and baord are up on a stage in
clear</B>
<BR><B>view. So if any person had climbed up on the stage to play a</B>
<BR><B>prank---they would have been seen.</B>
<BR><B>I seem to attract "prankster" spirits. Thankfully---</B><B></B>

<P><B>GHOSTLY SEA CAPTAIN</B>
<BR><B>Many years ago (about 30 to be more exact) I lived in my family's
old</B>
<BR><B>Victorian homestead...built by my ancestors.</B>
<BR><B>One afternoon I saw a tall man standing next to me in a navy blue</B>
<BR><B>uniform with gold colored buttons on it. He was wearing a sort of</B>
<BR><B>cap....but I could not see any features in his face. I heard him
say, as</B>
<BR><B>he reached out a large hand to MY face.."I just want to touch your</B>
<BR><B>blonde hair"...then he vanished.</B>
<BR><B>I was paralized in fear and could not move or speak. After he</B>
<BR><B>disappeared---I found my voice again..and SCREAMED! My mother, who'd</B>
<BR><B>been downstairs watching TV, came running upstairs. When I told
her this</B>
<BR><B>experience, she said that many of her ancestors had been Sea Captains</B>
<BR><B>and that they would not hurt me if their ghosts were there.</B><B></B>

<P><B>THE ROCKING CHAIR</B>
<BR><B>When I was 15 I had a friend staying overnight. We were listening
to the</B>
<BR><B>new album from the Doors. We heard this painfully sorrowful crying
above</B>
<BR><B>the music and it continued as my rocking chair began rocking all
by</B>
<BR><B>itself a few feet away from us.</B>
<BR><B>We turned off the record player (gee-remember THOSE?) and the rocking</B>
<BR><B>and crying continued. So we called my parents who w ere downstairs
and</B>
<BR><B>asked the if there was someone crying on the TV. They yelled at
us and</B>
<BR><B>told us to "knock it off"...</B>
<BR><B>Later, my mother told us that her great-great-grandmother had lost
many</B>
<BR><B>babies in the 1800's to childhood diseases. That was her rocking
chair</B>
<BR><B>and she rocked her babies to their death in it.</B>

<BR><B>TV Experience, true story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Rollover15@gbronline.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When i was a little girl and in eigth grade, there was a big house
across the street from mine. People were costantly moving from this house.
Well a family moved into it, and had a daughter my age, i went to her house
to stay the night one evening because her family went out. We was watching
Dimention 6 together, and all of a suden the TV went off. Then the rocking
chair by the fireplace started rocking by itself, rocking really hard.
Then the TV came back on and all that was on was a picture of Satan, or
a demon. The scariest thing i have ever seen. We tried to change the channel,
and the picture was on every station, same picture and everything. The
family moved and a week later, the house burnt down</B>

<P><B>My Great Grandfather</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Gillian.Eyre@amec.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have been reading true ghost stories on the Net and I now feel
it's only</B>
<BR><B>fair that I post one of my own.</B>
<BR><B>Here goes.....................</B>
<BR><B>On the night before my fourth birthday I was very excited (as most
children</B>
<BR><B>are before Birthdays or Christmas!) I think my Mum, June tried to
put me to</B>
<BR><B>bed at least three times but I kept getting up to see if it was
my Birthday</B>
<BR><B>yet.</B>
<BR><B>I had a Bagpuss alarm clock at the side of my bed and I remember
waking up,</B>
<BR><B>looking at the clock and seeing that it was just after 5am.</B>
<BR><B>I looked over to the other side of my bed and saw the shape of a
man. I say</B>
<BR><B>shape because that is the only way I can describe it. It was like
the</B>
<BR><B>outline of a man. It was dark and I remember thinking that it was
my Dad</B>
<BR><B>just making sure that I was still in bed.</B>
<BR><B>I didn't feel scared at all.</B>
<BR><B>I lay back down in bed and as I closed my eyes I became aware of
the</B>
<BR><B>'outline' moving. It felt like it came to stand beside my bed to
just look</B>
<BR><B>at me. Again I must state that I felt no fear at all even after
realising</B>
<BR><B>that it was not my Dad. The 'outline' felt comfortable if that makes
any</B>
<BR><B>sense.</B>
<BR><B>I felt what I imagined to be a warm hand on my head and I heard
a voice in</B>
<BR><B>my head say "Now Summer, get yourself to sleep and I'll see you
on your</B>
<BR><B>Birthday". I say I heard this in my head because I did not hear
the voice</B>
<BR><B>through my ears, It just went straight into my head.</B>
<BR><B>I got out of my bed and went up the stairs to tell my Mum about
the man that</B>
<BR><B>was in my room. At first she thought that I had just had a nightmare
so she</B>
<BR><B>took me back downstairs to put me back to bed.</B>
<BR><B>When I was in bed I told her about the voice I had heard in my head.
She</B>
<BR><B>started to cry.</B>
<BR><B>She told me that her Grandfather used to call her Summer because
she was</B>
<BR><B>born on the day after Summer Solstice (hence she was called June).
Her</B>
<BR><B>Grandfather had died in a car accident on the morning of her fourth
Birthday</B>
<BR><B>on his way over to see her. He doted on her because she was his
only</B>
<BR><B>Grandaughter.</B>
<BR><B>Thanks for taking the time to read this. To this day, twenty-two
years on my</B>
<BR><B>Mum still talks about the night that my Great Grandfather came to
wish me a</B>
<BR><B>Happy Birthday.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Firm Believer</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: leanne@cedarbureau.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I've been reviewing your website for a few hours now, and not until
I started reading others stories, did I feel compelled to share mine.&nbsp;
Even though I am a firm believer in ghosts, I am also skeptical.&nbsp;
I always question my story when I share it with others, however with the
first two, I can't exactly put an explination to them.</B>
<BR><B>About two years ago, my grandmother passed away.&nbsp; We never
had the best of relationships.&nbsp; I remember hearing a story of her
talking to one of her friends who was going to visit her grandchildren,
and my grandmother questioned why she would want to use her time in that
way.&nbsp; So, I am not surprised that she doesn't come to visit my brother,
sister or myself.&nbsp; However, I do believe she was there one day.</B>
<BR><B>I had just recently moved into a basement suite by myself, and this
was after a breakup with a very serious boyfriend.&nbsp; I was feeling
sad, and alone, and lying in bed.&nbsp; The whole suite was dark, no windows
were open, and it was in the summer.&nbsp; I always kept the door to my
bedroom open.&nbsp; I was laying with my hands on my stomach, and suddenly,
I felt a gust of cold wind come through the door, and someone holding my
hand.&nbsp; It scared me.&nbsp; I remember breathing funny, and then it
went away.&nbsp; I sat up in bed, and looked to my window, but it is across
the room from the door, and there would be no way the gust of cold wind
could come from that direction.</B>
<BR><B>The next time, I was alone again, and was cooking dinner for myself.&nbsp;
The refridgerator was next to the oven, where I was standing, and the fridge
just started to shake, like there was two people on each side of it pushing.&nbsp;
I jumped back startled, and went to the fridge doors, and flew them open,
and nothing was moved inside.&nbsp; It was all where I had left it, like
the fridge hadn't been moved at all.</B>
<BR><B>The last experience I had, is the one I question the most.&nbsp;
I was coming home, and had my sister with me.&nbsp; About a few days to
a week prior, my hair dryer had stopped working.&nbsp; I had left it plugged
into the wall, but it was in the off position.&nbsp; I had been meaning
to throw it away, but just hadn't yet.&nbsp; As we walked through the front
door, I could hear a noise.&nbsp; We both agreed that it was my landlords
vaccuming, however I wasn't convinced.&nbsp; We sat down to eat dinner
in the living room (the farthest room away from the bathroom) and I could
still hear it.&nbsp; I got up, and went looking for the source, and when
I walked into the bathroom, the hair dryer was on, and set to low, a setting
I never use.&nbsp; It was slowly heating up the rubber duck that was sitting
next to it, and I'm thankful there was no tissues, or hand towels on the
marble counter because it was hot to the touch.&nbsp; I turned off the
hair dryer, called my sister, and told her.&nbsp; My landlords called me
shortly after, asking what that noise was, and thanked me for locating
it.&nbsp; They said that it had been coming from my suite for a few hours,
and that they could never pin point where exactly it was coming from.&nbsp;
My hair dryer has been working fine ever since.</B>
<BR><B>I have grown up in a family of believers.&nbsp; My mother had grown
up in a home where an old man used to live in the closet and read books.&nbsp;
He would never show his face, and was fond of my aunt.&nbsp; My aunt says
that if I was to go to the now apartments, he would be good to me too,
and take a liking to me, because we both can sense things, and she knew
this from the second I was born.</B>
<BR><B>I have experienced other things as well, such as knowing when my
uncles father had passed on, when he lived quite a distance from us, and
I was away from a phone the whole day, and didn't hear about the death
until about 30 minute after I returned home.</B>
<BR><B>I thank you for your website, and for your time in reading this
e-mail.&nbsp; I have passed the link onto a co-worker who has shared some
extremely chilling experiences with me.</B>

<P><B>The Figure</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: JADEEGIRL4@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hey i am 14 years old my name is Sophia and i would like to share
a story about when i saw a ghost. I was eight years old. one night i couldn't
fall asleep. It was a quiet night, with no wind so i was alarmed when the
door to my room suddenly flew open. it wasnt the kind of force the wind
or a draft would do...in fact, the door was flung open so fast it hit against
the wal and bounced back and forth a few times. when the door finally stopped,
i saw a white, tall figure standing in the doorway. i stared at it for
about thirty seconds before i hid under the covers.&nbsp; after that i
loked up and it went away. a couple of months later i saw the same figure
leaning against the stairs loking at me. for years afterward, i was scared
of my own room so u can imagine the relief it brought when we moved!</B>

around. About 7 of us thought it would be funny to go over to the "haunted"
house. We were all really scared, but my pal moses got dared to go up to
it and knock on the door. He knocked, and took off like lightning. I got
a picture right after he knocked and If you look on the 2nd floor you can
see a white body with hands on it's hips and it's wearing an old preist
outfit. I&nbsp; was freaking scared beacause No tour guides were in the
house, it was locked, and and you can see a cross on the outfit! I don't
have a scanner but I will try to send it! My name is steph I am 12 and
live in Edmonton, Alberta and I swear Im a ghost magnet!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The Indians were still there</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: eaddress@pacbell.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Bug-eyed and scared-stiff, she watched the squaw walk straight down
the main hallway,</B>
<BR><B>turn right, step through the solid wall and dissapear. After regaining
her composure</B>
<BR><B>somewhat, the office employee then cleaned out her desk and took
an early leave of</B>
<BR><B>absence - a permanent one.</B>
<BR><B>That's just one of the many ghostly incidents I was informed of
by my new co-workers</B>
<BR><B>soon after starting my job at the southern California clothing outlet.
Their stories also</B>
<BR><B>included phantom footsteps and mysterious rappings.</B>
<BR><B>But my own experiences with the paranormal in and around that place
were still to</B>
<BR><B>come. And they would top any and all of the others.</B>
<BR><B>To begin with, constructing buildings on top of old Indian burial
grounds, as you might</B>
<BR><B>expect, is never a good idea. My new place of employment, however,
just happened to</B>
<BR><B>be in one such building.</B>
<BR><B>My first of four separate incidents occurred in the store's warehouse
section. At</B>
<BR><B>approximately 10 P.M. I was walking across the loading dock when
I heard what</B>
<BR><B>appeared to be someone's knuckles rapping on one of the metal roll-up
delivery doors.</B>
<BR><B>Although we didn't have late night deliveries, I assumed it was
and that the driver was</B>
<BR><B>announcing his or her arrival. Upon opening the door I saw that
no one was outside.</B>
<BR><B>No truck, no driver, just the cool night air and the deserted dock.
I shrugged it off</B>
<BR><B>and put it out of my mind.</B>
<BR><B>Sitting at my desk later that week, my train of thought was suddenly
interrupted by</B>
<BR><B>the "ping-ping-ping" sound that would be made if you were to strike
something on</B>
<BR><B>the metal railing of the cement steps just outside the door.</B>
<BR><B>After a minute or so of this racket I went to investigate. As I
approached the door</B>
<BR><B>the noise stopped. Just as before, I saw no one.</B>
<BR><B>My third experience took place just before dawn one morning after
propping a door</B>
<BR><B>open with a heavy piece of metal. As I stepped outside for some
fresh air the door</B>
<BR><B>slammed shut behind me with incredible force locking me out.</B>
<BR><B>Fortunately, I was able to let myself back in through another entrance.
The other</B>
<BR><B>employees wouldn't arrive until 7 A.M.</B>
<BR><B>I had been alone in the building.</B>
<BR><B>Not long before my departure to a better paying job, I was walking
outside near the</B>
<BR><B>loading dock area one morning when completely without warning the
hoofbeats of</B>
<BR><B>an approaching horse along with Indian war-whoops broke the dead
silence.</B>
<BR><B>I saw nothing at all, not even a shadow. But I heard it, plain as
day, clear as a bell.</B>
<BR><B>It only lasted for a few seconds, but like my earlier experiences,
it was enough to</B>
<BR><B>convince me that the Indians were still there.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>i looked there was no one there i told my wife again and she started
getting angry thinking i was just saying that because i didnt want to get
the baby any ways she got out of bed and walked across the floor to turn
on the lights the whole time saying she knew what she heard and she heard
footsteeps walk up to my side of the bed and it has to be the baby ?</B>
<BR><B>the light went on and the room was empty no one else in the room

the living room where i was when we heard&nbsp; something explode i thought
we had a gas explosion but the whole house would of went up we ran into
the kitchen and there was broken glass everywhere it looked like car glass
my wife looked at her brand new stove and the oven glass had blew out all
over the kitchen when the guy came out to fix it he told me he had never
heard of any stove ever doing that before the was no reason for it ?</B>
<BR><B>the next thing that had happen was that the bread that my wife had
just put up on the refrigerator in the kitchen we were both cutting stuff
up for dinner and had are backs turned when the bread some how flew off

<P><B>Ghost(s) experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: RagingSeaStorm@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Once, on a 6th grade field trip to a place called Nature's Classroom,
up in the Adirondacks.. Half of the girls had to stay in practically the
oldest building there was there. I think it was the first or second night
there... I was laying in this cruddy bed, looking around because I wasn't
anywhere near being sleepy.. And suddenly I spotted these two skeleton
figures. One was sitting in the chair just opposite me, by the window.
The other was sitting on the edge of my friend's bed. They were pulling
this red and white striped cloth back and forth, looked at me, and then
grinned with these purple glowing eyes and mouths. Next, I spotted, just
perched on top of the pipe above my bed... What appeared to be as a demon-like
creature. I only saw the back end of it, it was small, and almost looked
bat-like. It's tail was like the devil's, long and thin, with a point at
the end. If it moved at all, I think it was the swishing of its tail. The
next thing I saw, was I guess a spirit sent to protect us by my friend's
aunt. It looked like the Grim Reaper, though without the reaper. It was
floating above the tub in the bathroom, which was right across from me.
Needless to say, I finally fell asleep, wide-eyed, shocked to death, and
sitting up still in that crummy bed.</B>
<BR><B>...Turns out, I'm not the only one who saw/heard things that night.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Shadow</B>
<BR><B>By:&nbsp; Sirlok1@netzero.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>On Friday Dec.19th my mother spent the night at my apartment. In
the morning she told me she felt a presence and saw what appeared to be
a shadow by my front door. She said she saw this thing twice.</B>
<BR><B>Well my mother and I have felt and seen things for years so as usual
I made nothing of it.</B>
<BR><B>Then two days later I was sitting in my living room looking at a
movie at about 10pm when a very black shadow the size of an adult head
stuck its head out of my dining room window. Now my apartment is pretty
small so I didnt have to turn my head. I just glanced at it and it jumped
back behind the curtain causing it to move. I dont like black shadow people!
and yes I have read the article "Black or Dark Apparitions"&nbsp; by Dave
Juliano.</B>
<BR><B>In my thirty years of life and in the many places I have lived I
have been beat up visited or left alone yet allowed to see and witness
ghost or whatever they were. But the only one that scared me was the one
that jumped on me in 1994.</B>
<BR><B>Around the time of the Northridge Earthquake I was healing up from
a head on collision I got forced into by some other driver. So I was pretty
much bed ridden for a couple of months.</B>
<BR><B>Well one day a Shadow Man stuck half its body into my bedroom window.
It looked down at me with some wicked smile and then up to the door to
see if anybody was coming and then back at me.</B>
<BR><B>He suddenly pushed himself in and on top of me. (And I was not on
any heavy medication!) Well this thing then sat on my stomach and held
me down with its left hand. I just laid there confused thinking "I never
knew these things could do something so physical!"</B>
<BR><B>At this point the thing with the most wicked smile began to slap
me really hard and really fast and he continually looked behind him toward
the door to see if anybody was coming.</B>
<BR><B>Well my mother must have heard or felt something cause about 10
to 20 seconds into this slapping this thing jumped off me and out the window.
It stood there a few seconds until my mother and step-father ran into my
room. My mom jumped on top of me screaming for the thing to leave.</B>
<BR><B>Freaked out of my mind I asked how she knew and she said she could
feel something demonic was attacking me.</B>
<BR><B>Well this was only two of my stories. Im glad I can come here and
lay my story down because most people I know would consider me crazy for
what Ive seen.&nbsp; There was also the time 3 to 5 ghost came to me and
beat me pretty bad....all I got was a swollen face but my goodness.....</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Andrea</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:babydol1@tampabay.rr.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I've always been able to communicate with spirits, speak to them,
see them, hear them.&nbsp; Etc.&nbsp; It's a gift my mother was told I'd
always have.&nbsp; I've sent in a few stories,I love the site, but as I
am trying to read all of them, have yet to get to any of mine.&nbsp; This
is my newest experience.</B>
<BR><B>A few years ago when I was 17, I am now 19.&nbsp; I would fill in
for a teacher at the local dance school.&nbsp; Not everyone agreed due
to my age, especially the older students.&nbsp; I guess they didn't like
the fact of having to learn from someone younger than them.&nbsp; But,
I kept going, no matter what was said about me.&nbsp; I was friends with
most of the girls and we would hang out together and just do teenage things.&nbsp;
There was one girl that I became close with, named Andrea.&nbsp; We had
a lot in common, the same dreams, the same goals.&nbsp; Everything in our
friendship was great.&nbsp; We were both at the top of our class, special
honors mentioned, special awards, we won all of our competitions.</B>
<BR><B>A few months after meeting Andrea, she was in a car accident where
the other driver had been drinking and fell asleep at the wheel, she was
thrown out of her seat belt and through the windshield of the car.&nbsp;
I of course, was very upset and decided to do a solo memorandum dance in
her honor.&nbsp; I danced my heart out to *I Will Remember You* by Sarah
McLauchlin.&nbsp; I remember balling my eyes out the entire time I was
onstage.&nbsp; But, none the less had to finish my dance, so she could
be happy, even though, I knew she was right there onstage with me.&nbsp;
For the past year and half, I always thought that her spirit was at rest,
but I guess I was wrong.&nbsp; Just the other night, she decided to visit
me while I was dancing in my room.&nbsp; I no longer take the classes and
I dance at home in my room late at night when my fiance is at work.</B>
<BR><B>I remember having my light off as I always do and turning on the
version of *All That Jazz* Catherine Zeta-Jones does in Chicago...remarkable
I may add, and I felt a warmth around the room all of a sudden and a slight
bit of weight on my shoulder.&nbsp; I thought in my mind who it could be,
but when I felt the sudden urge to dance, I knew it had to be Andrea, no
one else would ever give me such a beckon to dance.&nbsp; So, as I began
to dance, I could feel her dance with me.&nbsp; I just hope her soul can
rest easy now.&nbsp; And, hopefully she'll come back to dance with me every
so often.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The year was 1968.I was in the Air Force stationed at Little Rock
Air Force Base in Jacksonville,Ark.Amongst our group of friends was a guy
named Ben,who lived off base with his wife Terri in a rented mobile home.Larry,another
of our friends was leaving soon,so Ben invited him to spend his last week
staying in his spare bedroom.After Larry left it was my turn to leave.Ben
invited me to spend my last days staying at his mobile home.One night I
woke to see a woman standing in the door.It wasn't Terri,Ben's wife.I just
laid there,a little scared,and confused about this figure.Slowly she just
faded into the dark.That in itself was strange enough,but whenI told Ben
the next morning what I had seen ,he justed stared for a minute,then ran
and woke his wife.As I related to her what had happened,they both just
gaped.It seems when Larry had stayed in the spare bedroom,he told them
the same thing happened to him.Haunted mobile home???</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Lights</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: LadyGoat@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This isn't incredibely scary, but kind of interesting. Three years
ago we moved to a very rural area in southwestern Missouri. As the realtor
showed us around, she told us how a man was in the back field farming on
an extremely hot day, and died of heat stroke and wasn't found for a few
days. Not long after that, my father went scouting for good places to hunt
deer at, and me and my brother followed out of boredom. We were sitting
on the pond bank in the semi-darkness. I was trying to do my homework in
the dim light, and looked up to see two bright lights coming at us through
the woods. They were the right distance apart to look like a car coming
at us, but there was no sound, and a car could not get through the trees.
They went off, and no one was there. We were both quiet, listening for
foot steps. It was deer season, and trsspassers were not uncommon, but
we neither heard nor saw no one. I looked at my brother, not sure if he
had seen it too. He was the first to ask me if I had seen the lights. We
got up immediately and went looking for my dad, who we found a long way
away from where we saw the lights. The rest of the time we were in the
woods, I kept feeling like someone was watching me. I frequently take walks
in the dark around our place, but unfortunately have not seen anything
since</B><B></B>

<P><B>In&nbsp; AL is an old house that has been refurbished. There is a
face in the smallest bedroom in this house. We have wallpapered and paneled
to try to get rid of this face, but so far it stays. It is a very protective
face. It is a mans' face. It is a very old haunting. It got mad at me one
time. I do not feel comfortable in my parents' house. If I have to go back
to that room, it is ice cold always and I had my teen years in that room.

<BR><B>Lincoln Street Hauntings</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: rebbie67@citlink.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>When I was younger my older brother, mother and I shared a house
with my mother's best friend &amp; her son. We live in a little town called
Gloversville, NY.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This house was a very large house with
all of our kids bedrooms upstairs.&nbsp; My mother &amp; her friends bedrooms
were downstairs.</B>
<BR><B>From the time we moved in I did not like the house.&nbsp; It was
just a feeling that I would get and I hated being upstairs alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There were a total of 3 bedrooms upstairs, a closet &amp; one very large
storage room that also led up to the attic.</B>
<BR><B>I would always hear strange noises at night, mostly from the attic.&nbsp;
When I told my mom she said it was probably squirrels.&nbsp; I'm thinking
"not".&nbsp; The sounds were more like someone moving furniture &amp; walking
around.&nbsp; I wasn't a stupid kid &amp; knew the difference.</B>
<BR><B>For awhile we had Mickey living with us.&nbsp; She was the older
daughter of my mom's friend.&nbsp; She was really cool &amp; I was glad
to not be the only "girl" in the house for awhile.&nbsp; During this time
I shared a bedroom with my brother, however, Mickey would often let me
come to her room &amp; we'd have slumber parties.</B>
<BR><B>That particular bedroom was the worst room in the house as far as
eerie &amp; scary feelings.&nbsp; There was a fairly large closet in that
room that had no door.&nbsp; At night if I rolled over &amp; looked at
that closet door I would always see a creepy evil looking face sneering
back at me.&nbsp; It didn't matter if there were other people around &amp;
the lights were on or not.&nbsp; To a 10 year old it scared my half to
death.&nbsp; To this day (and I'm 36 now) I can not sleep in a room that
has no closet door &amp; every night I make sure not only my closet door
is shut tight but that my daughters is as well.&nbsp; My boyfriend thinks
I'm a bit of a freak about it but I don't care.</B>
<BR><B>There would also be tapping outside that bedroom window.&nbsp; Almost
as if a tree was scraping against that side of the house.&nbsp; However,
that was in the front of the house &amp; faced the street.&nbsp; There
wasn't any trees in the front of the house either.</B>
<BR><B>We moved out a year or so later &amp; I was ecstatic about getting
out of there.&nbsp; I often have to drive over in that neighborhood &amp;
as an adult still get the feeling that something is just not right with
that house.&nbsp; I don't know if the people that live there now have had
any experiences &amp; I certainly have no intentions of stopping by there
to find out.</B>
<BR><B>One thing I did find out some years later was that a man had hung
himself outside of that bedroom window.&nbsp; I'm not sure if it's true
or not &amp; have never done any research on the home.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe
I should.....or not.</B>
<BR><B>This is just a couple of the stories about this house.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was very frightening.</B>
<BR><B>I do have a couple about the house we live in now, however, this
is a good spirit &amp; someday I'll write them down too.</B>
<BR><B>Thanks for listening &amp; I hope you post this on your website
for others to read.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: A True Believer</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have been a believer in spirits since I was young, although I never
has seen one before.&nbsp; I have had the experience of&nbsp; being wakened
up on night when I was around 12 with someone pulling the covers around
me as if they were tucking me in.&nbsp; I believe it was my Grandma.&nbsp;
This is were my son comes in, he has seen her.&nbsp; When he was around
the age of 4 he asked me one morning why his Auntie Alice was in his room.&nbsp;
Auntie Alice lived in Texas and we are in Ontario, Canada, and she was
still alive.&nbsp; She had visited us many times however, and my son knew
who she was.&nbsp; What the strange thing is, she resembled my Grandma.&nbsp;
They both were short and stout and had grey short curly hair.&nbsp; We
obviously know it wasn't Auntie.&nbsp; We all believe it was my Grandma.&nbsp;
My son's room was the only room in the house or in any place that I have
ever livedthat I had the feeling that someone was in the room with me.&nbsp;

<P><B>Haunted House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Tigergrl443@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it all happened when i was at my stepdads
grandmas house. i was there with my grandma and step aunt. my mom had gone
back to our house to get my swimming suit so it was just us three left
. i felt safe at first but then again something didnt feel right about
the house. we had been house sitting fer my stepdads grandma and we werethe
only ones there and all of us were outside by the pool. i was swimming
and i lifted my head from the water and looked at the front yard . i saw
two figures of people , they looked like a mother and a daugher holding
hads and they didnt look bad at all , i can still remember every feature&nbsp;
of them. they both had long curly red hair and their outfits matched. they
smiled at me and then at eachother then back at me . i didnt think anything
of it at first , so i just dunked my head under the water and back up to
get a better look at them but they were gone when i came back up . i had
only had my head under the water for less than a second . i couldent belive
what i had just saw. i asked the others if it was just me or had they seen
the two people in the yard. none of them had seeen a thing.just then my
experience must have started a chain reaction , because right after they
told me they hadnt seen any thing my grandma said she had just heard the&nbsp;
large dinner bell at the side of the house&nbsp; ringing. we went to go
check it out but there was no way the bell could have rung because it was
rusted stiff and we tried pushing it to see if the wind had lown it but&nbsp;
all together we couldent move it then we noticed something that made it
even more impossible , the stick thing&nbsp; that you needed to ring the
bell was tied tightly to the side of the bell with a large heavy rope that
was connected to it. i was getting freaked out cause after we checked out
the bell my step aunt tina said she had heard people talking inside the
house but e were the only people at teh house and we were all outside&nbsp;
we went in the house and found no sine of anyone in the houseit was compleatly
silent. we got out of there as fast as we could . i have never gone to
that house ever again.</B>

<P><B>Hi my name is gemma and i am a carer in a mental health residential
home. I have been working there for 1 year and 3 months and before it opned
as a mental health home it used to be and old peoples home. And there is
one corridor and the nurses office which i think has a sprit in. Many people
have asked me if i thought the corridor was haunted and my answer was "yes"
because on a day i was at work i was walking down that same corridor and
i constantly felt someone tap me on the shoulder and i knew that there
was'nt anyone there because i was on my own. The same has happned to a
few of my worf coleuges and they allways happen down the corridor or near
the nurses office. A few people have gone upstairs to sleep on a sleep
in and heard footsteps coming up the stairs. I know sprits or ghosts cant
hurt you but its weird how they seem to hang around one place.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Fire Station Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: gmboy_7000@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>i have been a explorer with a ambulance compony in colorado for about
2 years now, there&nbsp; are many ghost stories i could tell but ill just
say a few. In one of the districts we cover we have the quarters in the
old fire stations in the area. in one of the stations roams the spirt of
a old fireman or fire chief. the basic sounds of walking, talking in the
bay, and the occassional door closeing are all present. one time i was
watcdhing TV in the liveing area and i started hearing talking comeing
from behind the ladder truck, when i went to investagate there was nothing
there. Another time i was refilling the oxygen bottles after we had ran
a call (note the station i am refering to is the restock station for the
ambulances in the area) the unit at that station just left on a call and
my crew was outside in our unit cleaning some things off. I had just finished
refilling the bottle when i heard a man call out my name, i turned around
and saw a shadow run behind the ladder truck, upon investagation there
was no one there.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have to say that 4th St. Elem. is in deed haunted. I have lived
within a</B>
<BR><B>one mile radius of the school my entire life and have been told
countless</B>
<BR><B>times by diffrent people that the restroom that is on your web site
has</B>
<BR><B>some scary crap going on inside. I went to 4th St. from 1988-1994
(K-5th</B>
<BR><B>grade) and that restroom was only open 2 times that I know of. I
went in</B>
<BR><B>one time and had the ugliest feeling in the world. I ran out because
I was</B>
<BR><B>scared to turn around. Peers have told me that they too get a sick
gut</B>
<BR><B>feeling in that restroom. I personally have seen what looks like
someone</B>
<BR><B>walking in the restroom only to grab the knob and the door be locked.
This</B>
<BR><B>is in broad daylight. In the later evening hours the restroom windows
get</B>
<BR><B>illumenated by the setting sun and red shines under the door. Even
when the</B>
<BR><B>sun turns everything orange. I used to think that I had all this
in my</B>
<BR><B>head, but once I read about it on your site I knew that it was true.
My</B>
<BR><B>younger brother is going to that school currently and his peers
speak of</B>
<BR><B>the haunted restroom. And no one goes into it at all now.</B><B></B>

<P><B>A House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: chaslam76@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>A house Kerrville, Texas, is reputed to be haunted. A young blind
girl once lived there, but died on the front steps after being assaulted,
sometime in the 1940's. The family that moved in afterwards claimed that
her hand prints were still on the inside walls of the house, and that the
shadow of a hanging man was seen in the garage (a suicide took place there).
There are feelings of being watched, a sense of dread, and the sound of
the front door opening while footsteps run down the hallway.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am sending another story that happened just recently.</B>
<BR><B>Now the problem is I don't know under which category this story
would fall under, but--here goes:</B>
<BR><B>Just this past summer I had a very scarey experience (at least it
was to me).&nbsp; I was in bed late one night and I had awaken just long
enough to turn over onto my right side.&nbsp; I was adjusting the pillow
when I happen to glance at the retangular-shaped, orange light that the
outside swimming pool light casts into my room (I had also just glanced
at the time, it was 2:58am).&nbsp; There, within the left-side of this
light was a shadow.&nbsp; The shadow was of a "person's" bust but this
bust was disproportionately thin.&nbsp; As I stared at it, it moved slowly
to the left and out of sight.&nbsp; I jumped up out of bed and at the same
moment, had a very, very, VERY, strong feeling like someone was in the
room with me.&nbsp; I gathered my strength and walked out of my room (determined
not to let this get to me, I am a 45-year-old woman, ok?), to give the
apartment the once-over, checking to see if anything was out of place,
so to speak.&nbsp; As I walked back into my room, I saw, through the window
blinds, a yellow light dancing in front of my window.&nbsp; It was there
for only a few seconds then shot immediately to the right.</B>
<BR><B>I have always had 'encounters' throughout my growing-up years and
I feel this encounter was just another in a long line of them.&nbsp; I
guess that is why I now feel the need to remain calm, but each one is still
scarey just the same!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Plantation house</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: SStRaHaNs4103@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>hello, i am&nbsp; 15 yrs&nbsp; old and&nbsp; from the Southern part
of the U.S. My parents got married and moved to a plantation house in the
middle of the countrybefore they had me. The house was in a town b/w both
of their jobs. They rented this old plantation house out but it was very
strange because the 2nd story of the plantation house was closed off. Anyways
my parents had a few friends over one night eating supper, my mother was
using the restroom when suddenly she looks out the window and sees a face.
My mother i guess could u say is a ba++ss and is not scared of hardly anything
but she freaked out and ran out of the bathroom! So my dad and his buds
go outside and look for someone but cant find a thing. But the thing is
like most plantation houses they r built up, so someone would have to be
on a ladder or could possibly be in the tree close to the window and would
not have time to run and my dad or anyone miss them. So my dad goes to
work the next day and tells his co workers about the incident, come to
find out the horse trainer of the farm way back when had a heart attack
and died at the tree by the bathroom.....Kinda freaky ehhh!!! My parentals
also would tell me stories about how they would put the&nbsp; fireplace
stopper(used to keep the cold air from getting in)in the fireplace before
they went to sleep and when they would awake it would be on the other side
of the room, they also said they couches and table would move all the time!
So my parentals got the HELL OUT of there lol!</B>
<BR><B>I myself have only(thought 2 have)had one experience. I was 12 years
old and my close cousin was in a very bad car accident, he was in a hit
and run with and 18 wheeler. He was kept in the hospital for about a week,
still thinking he would come to. My family didnt want to give up on him,
he had been on his death bed many times before but always pulled through.
Anyways i was a week with out my parentals, and a week with babysitters.
My parents failed to tell me my cousin had passed until my babysitter let
it slipped that they wouldnt be at the hospital b/c he died. That night
after i found out my cousin died i was pretty restless, i would close my
eyes but couldnt go 2 bed, i opened my eyes and i swore i saw my cousin
just standing there with his rocker look(he always dreamed of being a rocker
on mtv, he was in the big hair band era). I have failed to tell anyone
this, mainly because i dont want 2 upset anyone, but everytime i see those
homemade videos with my cousin in there i just get the chills. So i dunno
if it what kind of state i was in but i know he was there with me.</B>
<BR><B>Please fill free to email me&nbsp; your stories or questions about
mine.......Thnx</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;No One There</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: reneesblues1167@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am a believer in ghosts but, with one exception, have never had
an unusual experience. (I know how cliche this sounds...lol) a girl was
killed on my senior prom night of 1987. She and her boyfriend were driving
around a bend in the road and a car coming from the opposite direction
came across into their lane and hit them head on. She was killed instantly.
This I think can be verified. I went to high school at Widefield High school
in Security Colorado. Security is a small town maybe 10 miles outside of
Colorado Springs. Anyway, the prom theme was "Tender Love." It was also
a song that was out that year. A month or so after this happened I was
at home in our rec room which was an addition on the back of the house,
watching MTV and the video for the song came on. Our house was a typical
one story ranch style. The old kitchen had been turned into the dining
room but still had the window opening so I had a clear view of the front
door. Suddenly I heard the doorbell ring. I naturally got up and looked
through that window as I was going to the door. I didn't see anyone there
nor did I see anyone running away. I went to the door anyway thinking that
maybe they were standing close to the door and I just couldn't see them
through the front window at first glance. When I finally got there, there
was no one there! Furthermore, I went outside to look around to see if
maybe it was one of my friends or one of the kids in the neighborhood playing
a prank and didn't see anyone. This happened in the afternoon, daylight.
The strange thing was this; the "latch" on our gate was broken so we secured
the gate closed with a piece of wire that went over the top posts of the
gate and the fence itself. It was a typical chain link fence with a typical
gate except for the latch being broken. The coat hanger was still on the
top of the gate. If someone had rung the bell and ran away they would have
had to lift that wire/coat hanger piece up and put it back on in maybe
20 seconds AND run someplace that I couldn't see i.e; the side of the house
or something. That is the only thing that ever happened to me personally.</B>
<BR><B>I've been to cemeteries many times and I even went to Gettysburg
a few years ago and took pictures. Nothing showed up much to my dismay.
For a believer like me it was irritating..lol. One of the most haunted
places in America and I couldn't get a ghost on film! That still makes
me nuts. I've looked through the pictures quite a few times hoping that
I would "see" something in one of them but I never do. Besides, if you
look long enough at a picture you can trick your mind into seeing things
that are really not there.</B>
<BR><B>I realize that it's a possibility that someone may have rung the
doorbell and ran away but I don't see how they had enough time to run completely
out of site. So, that is my story. I know it's not much but it's still
creepy. That's all that's ever happened to me. Thanks for your time,</B><B></B>

<P><B>Care Facility</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Brose71470@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>About 14 years ago, I used to work the second shift at the Wheatridge
Regional Center, the state home for the developmentally disabled, in Colorado.&nbsp;
The facility was going through a downsizing of it's residents by moving
them out of the facility and into the community, with hopes of eventually
closing the entire facility down.</B>
<BR><B>I worked in a building that contained 4 different areas or halls,
that housed residents.&nbsp; As time went on, these halls began closing
down one by one, as the residents were moved to different areas of the
state home, or to different facilities.</B>
<BR><B>I worked in one of the last halls remaining open in that building,
and whenever another hall would be closed, our supervisor would send us
over to the newly closed hall, in order to bring over any left over items,
such as furniture, for use in our area.&nbsp; We (the employees) would
always hate it when we were chosen to do these tasks, and would refuse
to do them alone, we insisted that another employee be appointed go with
us and for good reason.</B>
<BR><B>Whenever you went into one of the abandoned living areas of the
state home, you would hear and feel the strangest things. You would always
feel like someone was watching, and/or following you as you walked through
the area.&nbsp; There were noises that could not be explained, such as
footsteps or doors being heard as they opened and closed, the occasional
sound of rattling keys, and you could even hear the faint sound of voices
sometimes, but usually no one had enough courage to stay in the area long
enough to listen to them.&nbsp; You knew that the person chosen to accompany
you on these trips to the abandoned halls, wasn't responsible for the sounds,
because you were always sure to remain close together while you were there,
and you knew that it couldn't be another employee playing tricks on you
because they were all busy working in another area of the building at the
time.&nbsp; Some people even claimed to have felt someone put a hand on
their shoulder, or hear the sound of someone breathing in their ear, while
they were in certain areas of the building by themselves.</B>
<BR><B>I can assure you that there was very little left over items brought
back to the active residential halls in a single trip, from these newly
emptied residential halls, since we would normally just grab up one item
from the area and then run back to our work area as fast as we could, then
refuse to go back for anything more.</B>
<BR><B>There were also some very old buildings left standing on the lower
end of the state home campus, that had been out of use for several years.&nbsp;
There was one building in particular that had a set of curtains hanging
in a second floor window, sometimes you would notice the curtains being
wide open, then other times you would pass by and notice the curtains being
pulled tightly closed.&nbsp; It became a game of sorts for me and some
of my coworkers to drive past the building and note the position of the
curtains each day.</B>

<BR><B>A TRUE Story About A House I Used To Live In</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: BabyFace2003Baby@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>When I was younger, I lived in a house that everyone knew was haunted.
There were very strange and paranormal things that had happened to support
this theory.</B>
<BR><B>The ones I can remember were the most scariest of all the things
that happened. Here they are:</B>
<BR><B>This is an experience I will never forget! Anyway, there was a phone
in the basement and in the upstairs of my old house. Well, one night, I
was home alone and I was talking to my friend on the phone. I was in my
room (Which was in the basement at the time). And while I was talking to
my friend, I heard someone pick up the phone upstairs. I was sure that
no one in my family was home, but I had to go up to check just to make
sure. As I knew, they weren't home. And so I went back to talking to my
friend. Pretty soon, I heard it again. So I asked my friend if she had
heard what I had just heard. She said "No." Then I asked her if anyone
was home at her house. And again, she said "No." At this point, I was getting
scared. I never thought at the time that my house was haunted, so I thought
that maybe someone had broken in. I told my friend that I had to go, and
that I would call her back the next day. As soon as we hung up, I went
upstairs to see what was going on. I went straight to the phone that was
up there. I was terrified to see that the phone was off of the receiver,
when NO ONE was even home! My heart started to beat really fast. I was
just about to call the police when finally, my parents got home. I was
relieved! But still to this day, I wonder who it was that picked up the
phone that was upstairs.............</B>
<BR><B>One night, I was watching a movie with my mom and sister on out
hide-a-bed. We were watching the horror movie "Jeepers Creepers." Well,
anyway, we were just watching the movie, when all of a sudden, we heard
a switch turn on and off in the basement. If it wasn't for the switch sticking,
we probably woundn't have heard it. At this time, we KNEW it was a ghost.............</B>
<BR><B>Well, luckily, we have moved into a knew "un-haunted" house. LOL!
But still, I will never forget what had happened!!!</B>
