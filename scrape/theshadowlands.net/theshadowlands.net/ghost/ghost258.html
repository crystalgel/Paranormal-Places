<P><B>Pond Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mindym@wicomico.org</B><B></B>

<P><B>This morning, (Sept. 11, 2001) I was out running near my home. I
have to</B>
<BR><B>start before daylight if I want a long run and then to get to work
on time.</B>
<BR><B>I passed by a place that I've passed many times before, but this
time there</B>
<BR><B>was someone standing there. Actually not a someone, just a pale
figure. It</B>
<BR><B>was near a little pond or water filled hollow with trees growing
thickly on</B>
<BR><B>the far side. It was standing in front of these trees. I went by
it kind of</B>
<BR><B>fast, right away it left me with a chilly feeling. Some rational
part of my</B>
<BR><B>mind starts in telling me that I didn't see anything, or that if
I did see</B>
<BR><B>anything it was only a plank or something, laid against those trees.
I've</B>
<BR><B>never seen anything there before though, and the location that it
was in</B>
<BR><B>would be hard to get to, only reachable by swimming or wading the
pond or</B>
<BR><B>beating a way through those trees. Next time I think I'll approach
it</B>
<BR><B>coming from the other direction. There will be more light then and
if there</B>
<BR><B>is a physical object there I'll see it better. This isn't the first
time</B>
<BR><B>I've seen something though, I'm beginning to think I'm touched or
whatever.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Possible Haunting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: crai1614@speakeasy.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I had a possible haunting experience during the late fall of 1993.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>was a student at San Jose State University.&nbsp; I was living in
the</B>
<BR><B>dormitories.&nbsp; I wanted to switch from sharing a room with a
roommate to</B>
<BR><B>having a room all to myself.&nbsp; There were single rooms available
in the</B>
<BR><B>dormitory building called Royce hall.&nbsp; Royce hall was a kept
empty of</B>
<BR><B>students and used for visitors of the university here for conventions
or</B>
<BR><B>programs.&nbsp; This achedemic year was the first time it was being
open for</B>
<BR><B>students for a while.&nbsp; The building was more than half empty.&nbsp;
I had an</B>
<BR><B>acquaintance (a friend of a friend) that moved to Royce a month
before I</B>
<BR><B>did (let's call him Joe).&nbsp; Before I moved to Royce he moved
out to live</B>
<BR><B>in another dorm building.&nbsp; First he told me that he got out
of Royce</B>
<BR><B>because it was so empty and boring.&nbsp; He kept recommending that
I do not</B>
<BR><B>move to Royce, but I moved in anyway because I find peace and quiet</B>
<BR><B>appealing.</B>
<BR><B>The day after I moved into Royce, my friend and I help our Joe move
his</B>
<BR><B>stuff out.&nbsp; When we are finishing up my friend made a joking
comment,</B>
<BR><B>"Okay let's get out of here before 'it' gets angry."&nbsp; I asked
him what</B>
<BR><B>was he talking about.&nbsp; Joe told my friend to shut up and let's
not talk</B>
<BR><B>about it in the room.&nbsp; We went outside of Royce and I asked
again what</B>
<BR><B>this was all about.&nbsp; Joe told me I probably don't want to hear
it.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>persisted and asked him to tell me.&nbsp; Joe finally agreed and
said that he</B>
<BR><B>feels bad telling this because I just moved in but the place is</B>
<BR><B>haunted.&nbsp; He said one night, when he was sleeping, his alarm
clock kept</B>
<BR><B>going off even though it wasn't set to go off until morning.&nbsp;
Later when</B>
<BR><B>we got back to bed he said he felt something push down on him hard</B>
<BR><B>against the bed.&nbsp; He looked but couldn't see anyone there.&nbsp;
He said he</B>
<BR><B>couldn't move and couldn't breath.&nbsp; He said the force pushing
on him</B>
<BR><B>finally let go and terrified he screamed like he never screamed
before.</B>
<BR><B>He told me that he never stayed at Royce at night again and didn't
want</B>
<BR><B>to be in there for too long during the day, that is the real reason
he</B>
<BR><B>moved.&nbsp; I don't think Joe was lying to me, he and my friends
weren't the</B>
<BR><B>type to play this kind of joke one someone.&nbsp; However, I doubted
that he</B>
<BR><B>had an encounter with a supernatural force.&nbsp; I thought he most
likely</B>
<BR><B>had a terrifying dream that seemed real to him or he could have
been</B>
<BR><B>taking drugs or over stressed from classes.</B>
<BR><B>Even though I doubt Joe's story, it was a little spooky at Royce
hall.</B>
<BR><B>I told myself if there are ghosts, encounters with them will probably</B>
<BR><B>freighting but no physical harm will come to you.&nbsp; Joe's room
was on the</B>
<BR><B>same floor I was on, about 6 doors down from my room.&nbsp; My floor,
the top</B>
<BR><B>floor was the most empty of the building.&nbsp; Their were only
about 7</B>
<BR><B>people on my floor.&nbsp; One thing that was really spooking me
is that I</B>
<BR><B>heard sounds.&nbsp; A room next to me had bed creaking and wall
tapping</B>
<BR><B>sounds, but no one lived in that room.&nbsp; Every night I would
hear foot</B>
<BR><B>steps walking down the hall but I would hear any doors open or close.</B>
<BR><B>This was unusual because the hallway had doors on each end and I
can</B>
<BR><B>hear my neighbors close there doors at night.&nbsp; After a few
weeks, I</B>
<BR><B>started to peek through the peep hole of my door when I heard foot</B>
<BR><B>steps.&nbsp; There were times when I heard the foot steps go past
my door but</B>
<BR><B>I did not see anyone.</B>
<BR><B>One night when I was in bed getting ready to sleep I heard the foot</B>
<BR><B>steps again with out any sounds of doors opening again.&nbsp; This
time the</B>
<BR><B>foots step sounds sounded like they entered my room.&nbsp; The foot
steps</B>
<BR><B>went from my door and then to the empty bed on the other side of
the</B>
<BR><B>room (The dorm rooms had two beds, even for students that sign up
for</B>
<BR><B>single rooms) and then I heard a loud crashing sound on the empty
bed in</B>
<BR><B>my room as if someone jumped on it.&nbsp; I yelled. "Holy f**cking
sh*t!!!"</B>
<BR><B>jumped out of my bed ran to the light switch next to my door and
faced</B>
<BR><B>the empty bed with my fists out ready for a fight.&nbsp; I didn't
hear any</B>
<BR><B>more foot step sounds or sound coming from my bed.&nbsp; I slept
with the</B>
<BR><B>lights on that night.&nbsp; I would continue to hear the foot steps
sounds</B>
<BR><B>(with the absences of door sounds) and I continued to hear sounds
from</B>
<BR><B>the empty room next to me.</B>
<BR><B>During the next semester, Royce hall began to have more residents.&nbsp;
A</B>
<BR><B>girl moved into the room where I heard sounds from.&nbsp; The girl
stayed</B>
<BR><B>their the whole semester so I assumed that she did not have any</B>
<BR><B>freighting experiences (she had a boyfriend that spent the nights
with</B>
<BR><B>her).&nbsp; I did still hear the strange foot steps but I never
heard and</B>
<BR><B>sounds come into my room again.&nbsp; Joe's former room remained
empty for</B>
<BR><B>the entire school year.</B>
<BR><B>I don't know what to make of my experience at Royce hall.&nbsp;
I thought</B>
<BR><B>mbar the ghost story from Joe had made my sense of hearing hyper</B>
<BR><B>sensitive and made me a little jumpy.&nbsp; But the crashing sound
on my bed</B>
<BR><B>sounded so real and sounded like it came from the bed.&nbsp; I heard
the</B>
<BR><B>distinct sound of the bed's springs creaking when it happened.&nbsp;
I never</B>
<BR><B>heard sounds from the floor below me so I doubt the sound could
have</B>
<BR><B>been someone jumping on their bed bellow me.&nbsp; When I found
the</B>
<BR><B>ShadowLands website I checked to see any listings about Royce hall
being</B>
<BR><B>haunted but the only thing I could find was a mention that the old
gym</B>
<BR><B>being haunted.&nbsp; Royce isn't close to the old gym so I doubt
there was a</B>
<BR><B>connection there.</B>

<BR><B>Screaming Bridge</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Peeps2711@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Five of my friends and I took a trip down to the screaming bridge
in Arlington, Texas.&nbsp; We got there at about 10:00 and walked around
on some trails after the bridge until about 11:50 when we ended up on the
bridge.&nbsp; My friend and I just walked straight across the bridge because
I got a really bad feeling about it.&nbsp; Four of my other friends stayed
on the bridge until 12:00 when they said they saw something.&nbsp; This
is what one of them wrote when we got back to my place.</B>
<BR><B>I was on the bridge, waiting for my friends.&nbsp; The Brians kept
going but I was getting dizzy and looking through a white haze.&nbsp; Jason
asked if I was alright, but I felt great.&nbsp; I HAD to stay on the bridge.&nbsp;
I HAD to wait for what came.&nbsp; It was 11:50pm.&nbsp; Alex and the Jasons
were there with me.&nbsp; We started to hear footsteps run around.&nbsp;
Looking off the bridge, I saw the shore of the creek and heard the footsteps.&nbsp;
I'm not even sure if they were footsteps.&nbsp; It was like rocks crushing.&nbsp;
I kept hearing it on one side of the bridge.&nbsp; Then, I heard it on
the other side of the bridge so I ran over.&nbsp; All I saw was the otherside
of the bridge.&nbsp; At some point, we commented on the light filtering
through the trees.&nbsp; I started to hear whispering and tried to concentrate
on that.&nbsp; To my left, I noticed my three friends were in a line, staring
at one end of the bridge.&nbsp; I turned around and didn't see anything.&nbsp;
Then I did.&nbsp; An inky blackness was coming out of the ground.&nbsp;
It seemed to pulse then grow, covering the ligh</B>
<BR><B>t.&nbsp; At that moment, I stopped hearing the whispering.&nbsp;
I stopped seeing in a white haze.&nbsp; I ran.&nbsp; My friends started
running and they made it over the bridge's bar before me.&nbsp; One started
yelling at me to stop running but I ran.&nbsp; They eventually slowed to
a walk and I turned around.&nbsp; I saw the black again and ran again.&nbsp;
The others began running as well and we made it to the light where the
Brians were waiting with their car.&nbsp; We went across the street to
our car.&nbsp; It was 12:02.</B>
<BR><B>The other three guys on the bridge said they saw it come out of
a tree</B>

<BR><B>Our Ghostly Presence</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: anonymous</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>This is about my flat in Nottingham, United Kingdom of Great Britain.
(Home of Robin Hood)</B>
<BR><B>In February 2000, my brother and I moved temporarily into a flat
(apartment).&nbsp; The main door to the flat was at the bottom of the concrete
staircase.&nbsp; You could hear anyone come in, because the door was kinda
stiff to open and close.&nbsp; Although it only had one bedroom, we turned
the lounge into another one.&nbsp; My brother shared the main bedroom with
his girlfriend and I shared the lounge/bedroom with my partner and our
2 girls (we partitioned off half of the room as it was really big).&nbsp;
I always felt that there was something odd about the place.&nbsp; It wasn't
an old building and there was nothing spooky about it.&nbsp; My brother
and his girlfriend both worked at a nightclub and didn't get home until
early hours in the morning usually around 3.30am.</B>
<BR><B>It all started one weekend.&nbsp; It was about 3.30am - 4.00am and
my partner and I thought we heard them come home from work.&nbsp; Normally
they would tell us they were in.&nbsp; We could hear some muffled voices
in their room, but that was all.&nbsp; It was a really hot night and my
partner decided to run a bath.&nbsp; As the bath was running, we heard
someone go into the bathroom, go to the toilet and flush it, they then
turned off the bath water and the light and went back into the bedroom
and shut the door.</B>
<BR><B>We didn't really think anything of it at the time, but usually they
would have spoken to us by now.</B>
<BR><B>So we shrugged it off and both jumped into the bath for a while.&nbsp;
About half and hour later, we heard the front door being opened and laughter
coming up the stairs.&nbsp; I shouted 'who is that' and I heard my brother
shout 'it's me and Annie'.&nbsp; I shouted to him 'well who is in your
bedroom then?' and he shouted back 'no one is!'.&nbsp; I said to him 'stop
messing me about and tell me who is in there.'&nbsp; He popped his head
around the bathroom door and said to me 'there isn't anybody in there,
we have only just finished work, we stayed back for a lock in/party.&nbsp;
You can always ring up my work place and ask them if you don't believe
me!'</B>
<BR><B>Well, my partner and I just sat there in the bath and went as white
as a sheet.&nbsp; I told him what had happened and he couldn't believe
it.&nbsp; I know it wasn't him because he too went as white as a sheet.</B>
<BR><B>There had been a couple of strange things happen before the bath
incident.&nbsp; My partner thought I had tapped him on his back whilst
he was in bed.&nbsp; When he looked round there was no one there. He even
looked under the bed to see if I was hiding. But I was in the bathroom.&nbsp;
Another time whilst I was on my pc talking to a friend on the internet,
I swear I saw this little man walking out of my bedroom.</B>
<BR><B>My brother moved out shortly after that and my two daughters aged
4 and 10 at the time moved into the bedroom.&nbsp; They had a small portable
black and white television in their room which could only be controlled
by hand.&nbsp; Most mornings at around 4am we heard the television switch
on, no channel had been selected, just that damn crackly noise.&nbsp; We
would go into the bedroom and they would both be sound asleep.&nbsp; This
happened quite alot until the day we moved out.</B>
<BR><B>I said to my partner that I felt someone had died in the flat.&nbsp;
It wasn't until a day or two before we moved out, that I found out from
my neighbour downstairs, (an old gentleman whom had lived there for years)
that a small old man had actually died from old age in the small bedroom.</B>
<BR><B>Whether or not he didn't like the lights left on or the bath running
I don't know.&nbsp; But to this day I still don't know who or what went
in the bathroom to the toilet, flushed it, turned off the bath tap and
turned off the light went into the bedroom and shut the door.&nbsp; It
still puzzles me now.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Unforgetable Experience:</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Celiona_81@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It might seem hard to believe but it is a true
and unforgettable experience I’ve never met. No one believes me when I
told them about this, but I hope you do! It happened in my University.
First let me introduce myself. I'm an undergraduate student and am staying
in the University's hostel now. One night, around 3 to 5 am when everybody
is sleeping I was awoken by a loud 'bang' noise from outside the room.
I thought it might be someone slamming the door. So, I went back to sleep
without checking what exactly it was. After about 5 to 10 minutes, I heard
the noise again. And this time the noise was getting louder and faster!
I was so frighten that i dare not move a bit. I was hiding inside my blanket
hoping that someone will check it out. The time passed very slowly and
I can feel that something or someone was beside me, standing and starring
still at me.&nbsp; I was sweating, as I know something was there! I felt
so helpless and hopeless and I know I have to do something. So, I opened
my eyes slowly and peep through from my blanket. I can hear the fast pulsating
movement of my heart as if it was screaming for help. At that moment, I
saw a big fierce eyes looking into my eyes. 'NO!!!' I screamed loudly but
no sound came out from my mouth and it grabbed me and pulled me down from
the bed. I cried, screamed and tried to run away but it seemed like it
had controlled me! I could not make any sound or move as I wished. Then,
it bite me so hard on the right of my shoulder but I remember I did not
move at all when it bites me as I know nothing can be done anymore. My
tears rolled down my cheek as I was in great pain. I felt hopeless and
the only thing I can do is to pray! Then the next thing I can remember
was that I was lying on my bed with tears in my eyes and was surrounded
by my friends. They told me my door was wide open and so they came in and
saw me lying and crying on the bed. I thought everything was just a dream
but it was not! Till now, I still cannot forget it as the scar on my right
shoulder is still there with me......</B><B></B>

<P><B>House on Islay</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: callahang@armassoc.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>HI, Years ago my girlfriend (I'll call her Beth) and her husband
were moving</B>
<BR><B>from Calif. to Arizona.Beth's husband went along first to get the
new house</B>
<BR><B>ready and she stayed behind to sell the old one. Beth didn't want
to stay</B>
<BR><B>alone so I moved in till she sold the house.The house was very old,when
they</B>
<BR><B>bought it some years before it was a wreck. An old woman had lived
there</B>
<BR><B>until her death.Vines grew atop the whole house, all the windows
were</B>
<BR><B>boarded up and nailed shut from the inside, and the yards were terribly</B>
<BR><B>overgrown.They did a major over haul of the old house and yards
it turned</B>
<BR><B>out quite charming.The old woman's family left a lot of her belongings
in</B>
<BR><B>the house.</B>
<BR><B>Well the house turned out to be not so charming as I found out later.
I</B>
<BR><B>worked during the day and Beth worked at night, so I was alone at
night. I</B>
<BR><B>got home from work at around 4pm, Beth was at work already. Upon
walking in</B>
<BR><B>the front door I had full view of the dining room, all of the chairs
at the</B>
<BR><B>table were all pulled out about 2 to 3 feet, almost every day.This
puzzeled</B>
<BR><B>me so I asked Beth why she did this,Beth said she never moved the
chairs....</B>
<BR><B>There was a wall between the kitchen and the dining room, in this
wall was a</B>
<BR><B>cut out about 2 feet by 2 feet square, a window /shelf of sorts
on witch you</B>
<BR><B>could see through. There on this shelf was a hideous statue carved
out of</B>
<BR><B>some sort of snow white, very crumbly material. It was of a rearing
horse,a</B>
<BR><B>man and a dog, all of witch had the eyes grossly gouged out. Beth
told me</B>
<BR><B>never to touch the statue witch faced toward the kitchen this is
how the</B>
<BR><B>statue had been when they moved in (left by the old woman) or to
move it as</B>
<BR><B>it would surly fall to dust. I noticed one day the statue had been
turned to</B>
<BR><B>face the dining room, I NEVER touched the thing I hated it, Beth
said the</B>
<BR><B>same thing she had never bothered it.We were both very shaken at
this</B>
<BR><B>occurrence, we never found out how it was turned or the chairs got
pulled</B>
<BR><B>out as it was the two of us in the house.</B>
<BR><B>Then there was the doll....................This doll was also left
in the</B>
<BR><B>house,it was creepy and very, very old. The flesh of the doll was
made out</B>
<BR><B>of some sort of animal hide,it had human hair, and even some kind
of</B>
<BR><B>fingernails embedded in the hands, it had small protruding individual</B>
<BR><B>glass-like teeth set into the face!!! Well with age the skin had
turned a</B>
<BR><B>brownish color and had shriveled up grossly and knarled the hands.Elizabeth,</B>
<BR><B>Beth named her sat in a small wooden high chair in the spare bedroom,
she</B>
<BR><B>too had changed positions often without being physically touched.
Needless</B>
<BR><B>to say I was thourghly freaked and so was Beth, I had had enough
so as soon</B>
<BR><B>as that creepy house sold we were GONE.... Never have I even driven
by it in</B>
<BR><B>all these years. Many other HI, Years ago my girlfriend (I'll call

<BR><B>There was a wall between the kitchen and the dining room, in this
wall was a</B>
<BR><B>cut out about 2 feet by 2 feet square, a window /shelf of sorts
on witch you</B>
<BR><B>could see through. There on this shelf was a hideous statue carved
out of</B>
<BR><B>some sort of snow white, very crumbly material. It was of a rearing
horse,a</B>
<BR><B>man and a dog, all of witch had the eyes grossly gouged out. Beth
told me</B>
<BR><B>never to touch the statue witch faced toward the kitchen this is
how the</B>
<BR><B>statue had been when they moved in (left by the old woman) or to
move it as</B>
<BR><B>it would surly fall to dust. I noticed one day the statue had been
turned to</B>
<BR><B>face the dining room, I NEVER touched the thing I hated it, Beth
said the</B>
<BR><B>same thing she had never bothered it.We were both very shaken at
this</B>
<BR><B>occurrence, we never found out how it was turned or the chairs got
pulled</B>
<BR><B>out as it was the two of us in the house.</B>
<BR><B>Then there was the doll....................This doll was also left
in the</B>
<BR><B>house,it was creepy and very, very old. The flesh of the doll was
made out</B>
<BR><B>of some sort of animal hide,it had human hair, and even some kind
of</B>
<BR><B>fingernails embedded in the hands, it had small protruding individual</B>
<BR><B>glass-like teeth set into the face!!! Well with age the skin had
turned a</B>
<BR><B>brownish color and had shriveled up grossly and knarled the hands.Elizabeth,</B>
<BR><B>Beth named her sat in a small wooden high chair in the spare bedroom,
she</B>
<BR><B>too had changed positions often without being physically touched.
Needless</B>
<BR><B>to say I was thourghly freaked and so was Beth, I had had enough
so as soon</B>
<BR><B>as that creepy house sold we were GONE.... Never have I even driven
by it in</B>
<BR><B>all these years. Many other HI, Years ago my girlfriend (I'll call
her Beth)</B>
<BR><B>and her husband were moving from Calif. to Arizona.Beth's husband
went along</B>
<BR><B>first to get the new house ready and she stayed behind to sell the
old one.</B>
<BR><B>Beth didn't want to stay alone so I moved in till she sold the house.The</B>
<BR><B>house was very old,when they bought it some years before it was
a wreck. An</B>
<BR><B>old woman had lived there until her death.Vines grew atop the whole
house,</B>
<BR><B>all the windows were boarded up and nailed shut from the inside,
and the</B>
<BR><B>yards were terribly overgrown.They did a major over haul of the
old house</B>
<BR><B>and yards it turned out quite charming.The old woman's family left
a lot of</B>
<BR><B>her belongings in the house.</B>
<BR><B>Well the house turned out to be not so charming as I found out later.
I</B>
<BR><B>worked during the day and Beth worked at night, so I was alone at
night. I</B>
<BR><B>got home from work at around 4pm, Beth was at work already. Upon
walking in</B>
<BR><B>the front door I had full view of the dining room, all of the chairs
at the</B>
<BR><B>table were all pulled out about 2 to 3 feet, almost every day.This
puzzeled</B>
<BR><B>me so I asked Beth why she did this,Beth said she never moved the
chairs....</B>

<BR><B>The Neighbor</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: echosky16@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>When I lived at my old house, there was a neighbor that had passed
away</B>
<BR><B>across the street. He was an old man that had died alone in the
house and</B>
<BR><B>was not found for a couple days prior his death. A couple months
had passed</B>
<BR><B>and a new couple moved in the house. The wife was expecting a baby
and when</B>
<BR><B>that baby was born I beacme the babysitter. When I used to babysit
I would</B>
<BR><B>always go across the street to the neighbors house when watching
the little</B>
<BR><B>girl. The one night I had my Friend come over to help me watch the
little</B>
<BR><B>girl. Shortly after we put the baby down to sleep my friend had
gotten a</B>
<BR><B>page from her boyfriend. When I went to pick up the phone in the
kitchen for</B>
<BR><B>her to use I listened to hear the dial tone but there was non to
be</B>
<BR><B>heard...I only heard the sound of the baby crying upstairs. I thought
it</B>
<BR><B>might have been the phone interfering with the baby monitor, but
when I went</B>
<BR><B>upstairs to check on the baby, she was fast asleep. There was no
sign of her</B>
<BR><B>crying.</B>
<BR><B>The next experience in the house happened later. It was a Thursday
night and</B>
<BR><B>I was about to give the baby a bath. She was really not a baby anymore
at</B>
<BR><B>that time because she was about 1 1/2 yrs old and was able to walk
and run</B>
<BR><B>all over the house. I had taken all the toys out of her crib so
that it</B>
<BR><B>would be easier for me to change her after the bath. I went to check
the</B>
<BR><B>water and let her run around alittle before I put her in the tub.
When I had</B>
<BR><B>finished giving her a bath i went to put her in her crib not thinking</B>
<BR><B>anything of it for about a minute. I finally noticed that all of
the toys</B>
<BR><B>that I threw on the floor previous to the bath were now back inside
the</B>
<BR><B>crib. I first though that she had thrown them back in, but there
was no</B>
<BR><B>possible way because the toys were put back exactly the way they
were before</B>
<BR><B>I had taken them out. They were not thrown in like how a little
1 1/2 yr old</B>
<BR><B>would do if they just threw them in the air into the crib....which
as a</B>
<BR><B>matter of fact was pretty high with the bar up so it would have
been very</B>
<BR><B>difficult for her to throw the toys back into the crib. Someone
placed them</B>
<BR><B>in there the way they were before and it sure was not me. I think
maybe it</B>
<BR><B>might have been the man that had died previously...he had died all
alone,</B>
<BR><B>and maybe he just wanted to have a little fun while he got the chance.</B>

<P><B>"Red Brick House"</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: LuvedThemSo@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I am 80 plus years old at the present time. But when I was in my
early 20's I married a very loving, handsome man and we moved into our
first home, which was a Big Red Brick house in a small town. The house
was separated into two half's, an upstairs and a downstairs..We lived in
the bottom half. Soon after moving into the house we gave birth to a beautiful
daughter. Our life was fulfilled. My husband and I still as much in love
as the day I set eyes upon him and he was ever so proud of his little Joy
Lynn (Our Daughter).. Our life couldn't be better at this point. Until
one day during a hot summer the family above us had to move due to work
and I was asked if I could clean and paint the upper half and try to find
a new family to move in. I cleaned a little one day and then decided to
start again early morning when the sun wasn't beating through the windows
so. And so I did, I started at 5 a.m and decided to take a break and do
of my own chores that needed tended too.. I left the door open that led
to the upper half of the home and began to wash some clothes and when I
went out in the yard to hang them I thought nothing about my very curious
5 year old daughter being alone in the house, I was only right out the
side door. I went back in the house to make lunch for her before I began
to clean again and called for her and got no answer, I began searching
for her and she was nowhere to be found. After searching the streets I
called my husband home and then contacted the authorities. They found our
daughter, she had explored through the door that went to the upper half
of the house and climbed up into the attic and when they had found her
she was dead. I was in shock, I was only outside for a short time, and
she had no marks on her body to show cause, and the medical people couldn't
even explain what the cause of death was. This was the hardest thing I
even had to endure. One night while lying in bed trying to re enact the
day out in my head and figure out what could have happen, my husband made
a strange noise and yelled "Do you see her?!" I sat up and asked what he
was seeing and he swore my daughter had entered the room. I assured him
no one was there and his mind was playing tricks on him because he missed
her so much. that was one of many long tearful nights and it happened several
times a week, until exactly 8 months to the day that our daughter died,
when i was leaving to go to the mill i found my husband's lifeless body
lying on the basement stairs that led to the outside and in his hands tightly
clutched was the doll my daughter lost the before she died. The doctors
say it was a heart attack, but at the young age of 30? . I think he had
to much strain on his heart over the loss of our daughter. I began to blame
the house, it had took my only happiness from me. I moved out shortly after,
but rumors have it that the family's that lived there soon after swore
to see and man and little girl walking the house in search of each other..
This is my true but sad story and someday we will be together again. As
for the house, it still stands and every so often I drive to see if I can
get a glimpse of my family it took from me....</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Regis fan</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: pvicenti@salud.unm.edu</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have had three paranormal experiences in my 53 years.&nbsp; The
first I</B>
<BR><B>told in "the house on tenth street", the second in "It had red eyes".</B>
<BR><B>This is the latest.&nbsp; We bought a new house south of Albuquerque,
NM</B>
<BR><B>three years ago.&nbsp; It was perfect.&nbsp; It, had covered stalls
with turnouts</B>
<BR><B>for our four horses, two pastures, two outbuildings, and large old</B>
<BR><B>cottonwood trees.&nbsp; We bought it.&nbsp; It was light, and felt
very friendly.</B>
<BR><B>It only had one, well make that two, problems.&nbsp; The TV in the
master</B>
<BR><B>bedroom would blast on in the middle of the night at top volume.&nbsp;
We</B>
<BR><B>changed TV's.&nbsp; After that, the TV in the Sun room would blast
on in the</B>
<BR><B>middle of the night at full volume.&nbsp; We changed TV's there,
and</B>
<BR><B>installed surge protectors.&nbsp; No more problems.&nbsp; However,
the door to the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen which is by the carport would not stay closed even though
it had</B>
<BR><B>a deadbolt and lock in the doorknob.&nbsp; I would lock them, push
to make</B>
<BR><B>sure the door was closed and the locks engaged, and when we would
get</B>
<BR><B>home from work, the door would be wide open.&nbsp; My husband would
blame me,</B>
<BR><B>then he locked the door the next morning.&nbsp; When we got home,
the door</B>
<BR><B>was wide open.&nbsp; The next day I stayed home because I was sick.&nbsp;
I was</B>
<BR><B>sitting on the couch at 9:00 a.m. waiting for Martha Stewart to
come on.</B>
<BR><B>The TV suddenly switched channels to Regis and Kathy Lee.&nbsp;
I didn't like</B>
<BR><B>Regis and Kathy Lee.&nbsp; I changed it back to Martha Stewart.&nbsp;
The next day</B>
<BR><B>I was still sick.&nbsp; I am lying in bed when I hear the TV turn
on.&nbsp; I got</B>
<BR><B>up went in to the living room, and it is on Regis and Kathy Lee.&nbsp;
We</B>
<BR><B>have a TV that automatically comes on with the program guide showing.</B>
<BR><B>You cannot change channels until the program guide is switched off.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>was mystified, but thought nothing of it.&nbsp; This house felt
warm and</B>
<BR><B>welcoming and EMPTY!&nbsp; (Well except for my first night in the
shower,</B>
<BR><B>which I put down to jitters in an unfamiliar house).&nbsp; Two weeks
later I</B>
<BR><B>was home again because it was a holiday.&nbsp; I was in the kitchen
pouring a</B>
<BR><B>cup of coffee before Martha came on.&nbsp; Suddenly I look into
the living</B>
<BR><B>room and see the set switch to Regis and Kathy Lee.&nbsp; Well,
I go in and</B>
<BR><B>switch it back.&nbsp; It stayed there, but I was to be sorry.&nbsp;
I set the VCR</B>
<BR><B>that night for my favorite show.&nbsp; The next morning.&nbsp; I
had an hour of</B>
<BR><B>blank tape when I rewound it.&nbsp; I thought it was the machine.&nbsp;
It was</B>
<BR><B>not.&nbsp; The program I taped the&nbsp; next night after I got
home from work was</B>
<BR><B>fine. A month later, I was home, the set switched on to Regis and
Kathy</B>
<BR><B>Lee and I switched it to Martha.&nbsp; That night I taped another
hour of</B>
<BR><B>blank tape instead of the program I was aiming for.&nbsp; Yes, I
know I was</B>
<BR><B>slow, especially in light of having had previous experience with
unseen</B>
<BR><B>residents in former dwellings.&nbsp; We were still having occasional
problems</B>
<BR><B>with keeping the door closed after we locked it and left the house.</B>
<BR><B>After the second experience with the VCR, I stopped changing the</B>
<BR><B>channel.&nbsp; I would go into another room and watch Martha and
leave Regis</B>
<BR><B>and Kathy Lee to whatever.&nbsp; I also announced to no one in particular</B>
<BR><B>that it would be a shame to come home one day and find the TV's
stolen.</B>
<BR><B>We have not had a problem with an open door since.&nbsp; One thing
to note.</B>
<BR><B>Only the living room television is involved, and only for Regis.&nbsp;
It is</B>
<BR><B>Regis that is the attraction.&nbsp; It still comes on for Regis
and Kelley.</B>
<BR><B>Whoever it is is polite.&nbsp; If the set is on they switch the
channel and</B>
<BR><B>it is up to me to switch it back after the program is over, or turn
it</B>
<BR><B>off.&nbsp; However, if the set is off and has to be turned on, it
is turned</B>
<BR><B>off when Regis is over.&nbsp; I have been home and witnessed this.&nbsp;
Also, I</B>
<BR><B>had surgery last summer and the first morning I was home from the</B>
<BR><B>hospital, the TV came on at 9 for Regis.&nbsp; I was not well, and
I was</B>
<BR><B>cranky and announced I was sick and the TV was too loud.&nbsp; The
set</B>
<BR><B>immediately switched off.&nbsp; I felt bad (after all, that is the
only show</B>
<BR><B>it seems to care about),so I got up, went into the living room,
switched</B>
<BR><B>the set back on, turned the volume down and went back to bed.&nbsp;
When I</B>
<BR><B>woke up, the set was off. So far we seem to share the house well.&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>only problem is that for the past year both my husband and I have
been</B>
<BR><B>having nightmares.&nbsp; Not all the time, but neither of us was
prone to</B>
<BR><B>them before.&nbsp; I don't know if there is a connection, but I
sure hope</B>
<BR><B>not. We really like this house and so do our six cats.</B>

<P><B>GHOSTLY MIST</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jessedan@rocketmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Let me start off by saying that I must be the most</B>
<BR><B>UN-phsychic person around. I have never seen, heard,</B>
<BR><B>smelled, or felt anything wierd, and for this reason I</B>
<BR><B>tend to be a little suspicious when someone tells me</B>
<BR><B>about any strange experience they've had. I always try</B>
<BR><B>to look for a logical and scientific explanation. What</B>
<BR><B>I'm about to relate to you happened to my son Jesse</B>
<BR><B>about 6 months ago, and terrified him so much that he</B>
<BR><B>still sleeps in my mom's room at the foot of her bed.</B>
<BR><B>My two sons Jesse and Nicky (they're 24 and 18</B>
<BR><B>respectively) live with my mother in Huntington Beach</B>
<BR><B>because they both attend college in California. They</B>
<BR><B>both share a room in my mom's two story house. On</B>
<BR><B>occasion, my grandfather will come to stay with my</B>
<BR><B>mother, and my sons always give him their bedroom so</B>
<BR><B>he'll be more comfortable, and they sleep downstairs</B>
<BR><B>in the family room in sleeping bags. On this</B>
<BR><B>particular night, everyone else had gone to bed and my</B>
<BR><B>sons had set out their sleeping bags on the family</B>
<BR><B>room floor and had just settled down to watch some</B>
<BR><B>television.&nbsp; Nicky fell asleep almost immediately, but</B>
<BR><B>Jesse (who had taken the position next to the wall)</B>
<BR><B>stayed awake watching a program that he liked. Just</B>
<BR><B>then a commercial came on and he closed his eyes for a</B>
<BR><B>second to rest them until the program started again.</B>
<BR><B>Suddenly, just out of the blue, he heard whispering in</B>
<BR><B>his right ear. It was a masculine voice and it started</B>
<BR><B>out whispering softly but quickly got louder and</B>
<BR><B>louder although he couldn't make out the words. The</B>
<BR><B>first thing he thought was "how did Nicky get over on</B>
<BR><B>the other side of me without my noticing him? And how</B>
<BR><B>did he wedge himself into the space between me and the</B>
<BR><B>wall?"&nbsp; This all happened in a split second, and he</B>
<BR><B>immediately opened his eyes, but to his horror he saw</B>
<BR><B>that Nicky was still sound asleep and hadn't moved</B>
<BR><B>from his position. Just then something caught his eye</B>
<BR><B>on the ceiling on top of him, and when he looked up,</B>
<BR><B>he saw a grey mist floating above him close to the</B>
<BR><B>ceiling. At first the mist was up high, but it slowly</B>
<BR><B>began to descend towards his face. By this time he was</B>
<BR><B>really scared and tried to wake his brother up, but</B>
<BR><B>found he was frozen and couldn't move a muscle. So all</B>
<BR><B>he could do was lay there while the mist came down,</B>
<BR><B>first over his face, then lower on his torso, and then</B>
<BR><B>down towards his feet. It just hovered a few inches</B>
<BR><B>above him, and he says that wherever it moved, he felt</B>
<BR><B>an extremely hot, burning sensation. (I find this odd,</B>
<BR><B>since everyone else always says they experience an icy</B>
<BR><B>cold feeling) When it got to his feet, the mist</B>
<BR><B>started to move again towards his face. It continued</B>
<BR><B>to do this several more times, all the while Jesse was</B>
<BR><B>unable to move. He was concious of the t.v. program</B>
<BR><B>he had been watching, the commercial was over, and the</B>
<BR><B>show had started again, he could see the t.v. through</B>
<BR><B>the mist. He kept hoping it would go away, but it</B>
<BR><B>didn't. It just hovered there, moving back and forth.</B>
<BR><B>Finally, it occurred to him to pray. He remembers that</B>
<BR><B>he silently repeated the Lord's Prayer 3 or 4 times,</B>
<BR><B>and then he just began begging God in earnest to</B>
<BR><B>protect him. Suddenly the mist just faded away. As</B>
<BR><B>soon as that happened, he was able to move again and</B>
<BR><B>immediately screamed out his brother's name. Nicky</B>
<BR><B>woke up and when he heard what had happened he refused</B>
<BR><B>to sleep in the family room any longer. They were both</B>
<BR><B>now thoroughly spooked and decided to take their</B>
<BR><B>blankets into the living room, and sleep together on</B>
<BR><B>the couch. They tried to get to sleep, but they began</B>
<BR><B>to hear strange noises in the kitchen, as if someone</B>
<BR><B>were rummaging through the cabinets. They both heard</B>
<BR><B>the noises. By this time they had had just about</B>
<BR><B>enough, and they made a run for it, up the stairs to</B>
<BR><B>my mom's bedroom and dove into her bed, to sleep with</B>
<BR><B>her. These are both college students who have never</B>
<BR><B>used drugs, who don't drink, who aren't proned to</B>
<BR><B>imagining things, and who are both active, healthy,</B>
<BR><B>athletic soccer players. When they told me about this</B>
<BR><B>experience (skeptic that I am) I immediately began</B>
<BR><B>searching on the internet for some sort of information</B>
<BR><B>on night terrors or extremely vivid dreams, (the fact</B>
<BR><B>that most people seem to see these things at night</B>
<BR><B>when they've been sleeping makes me highly</B>
<BR><B>suspicious), and I did find a very interesting page on</B>
<BR><B>sleep disorders, and what is called the "Hag</B>
<BR><B>Phenomena". I said as much to Jesse, and he read the</B>
<BR><B>information, but he was adamant, that what he</B>
<BR><B>experienced was real. He says that he had not been</B>
<BR><B>asleep, and during the entire episode he was fully</B>
<BR><B>aware of the program that was on t.v. since he could</B>
<BR><B>actually see it through the mist. And he had enough</B>
<BR><B>time to say several silent prayers before it</B>
<BR><B>dissapeared. This doesn't seem to be consistent with</B>
<BR><B>Hag Phenomena. So, the bottom line is, I don't know</B>
<BR><B>what he saw. As a side note, my brother who also lives</B>
<BR><B>there, and who is about as UN-phsychic as I am, has</B>
<BR><B>tried desperately to see the "ghost", and has been</B>
<BR><B>sleeping in the same exact spot Jesse was in for the</B>
<BR><B>last six months, in hopes of catching a glimpse of it,</B>
<BR><B>but much to his dissapointment, he hasn't seen a</B>
<BR><B>thing.</B>

<P><B>My dad always said that THEY we attracted to me. once when I was
very small my family went to MO. to visit some realitives. while we were
there my family stayed in a shanty shack just across a small bridge over
some water on a small island on the property of my relitives. one day my
sisters and I were out side playing by the water when a little black boy
came to play with us I don;t know how he got there but any way after a
while mom called us in to get cleaned up to go over to our aunts to have
supper. I told my uncle about the little boy, my uncle said there was no
little boy here. well later&nbsp; after we ate my uncle began to tell a
story of a family that lived in the shanty&nbsp; and during the war some
soliders came and they drowned their two children a boy and a girl. my
mother then said in a startled voice that just the night before when she
and my dad were in bed she had a dream of just that and when she woke up
a pair of feet were dangling in her face. my uncle says that was the male
slave that the soliders killed. the slaves wife was never found but the
children have been known to play there. I know because I played with them</B>

<BR><B>Saying Goodbye</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jjsmith61@triton.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Before my husband and I got married, we moved into a home that had
been in his family for a very long time. Before it was made into a home,
it was an original one room school house that his grandfather attended.
Eventually it was given additions and an extra floor.</B>
<BR><B>It was in one of the bedrooms of the second floor, that I hated
being in. Before we even moved in, I would stand outside and stare at the
windows and feel like something was watching me. My husband hated me bringing
it up because it frightened him. When we moved in, I could never go upstairs
by myself and even if I went up there with him, I didn't stay long. I was
flat out scared to be there.</B>
<BR><B>About four months after we moved in, my husband had to move away
for a few months for school. Well, I wasn't happy about that because then
I was alone with this thing that i'd never even seen, but I knew it was
there. One night after he'd been gone for a while, I woke up in the middle
of the night. I was laying on my side and could see someone standing in
the doorway of our bedroom. It was a dark figure, like a shadow, but I
couldn't make out any features. It just stood there staring at me, and
I wasn't scared of it. I watched it, and laid back down and fell asleep.</B>
<BR><B>After that, I was never afraid to go upstairs, and I never felt
that creepy, crawly feeling again. I guess he just wanted to say goodbye.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Scary New Years Day</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Mystic317@cs.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>We moved into our home , trick or treat night! Getting back to New
Year,s Eve, Let me first tell you, we stayed home, watched tv and we don,t
drink, I am physic and have a little esp, since I was 15, I don,t&nbsp;
know if that means anything. We, were all in bed sleeping, about 7 in the
morning, I was the only one-- heard this weird,load bang. I got up, not
knowing what I was looking for-went down to the kitchen, I could not believe
what I saw! The leg of the table, did not fall off, no screws were loose,
it was broken in the middle. It, looked like a strong man had just torn
it apart. To make a very long story a little shorter, my hisbund took the
leg off,&nbsp; laid it carefully on the back seat of his car- to take to
my friend,s to see if he could fix it. They live 5 minute,s away--when
he got there, his leather seat was all torn up, like someone took a knife
and slashed it. You won,t believe this. I went to make breakfast, I took
out the eggs, and they floated in the air. All day, everyone was bumping
into walls and dropping things and really miserable to each other. I felt
the air was heavy and something wasn,t right, This went on all day, I also,
cut myself quite bad, carving the meat. At exactly 7pm that night, I felt
as though someone had given me oxogen. I felt lighter, I felt something
was gone, I don,t know what. Everybody, was back to normal. Except, to
this da, I wonder about the table, it was done by something-- and the eggs.
That is my true story. I am probably crazy right? But 4 other people saw
it to.</B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sisters Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Last year my sister had been sitting in her rocker feeding her infant
and</B>
<BR><B>talking to her girlfriend on the phone. It was early October at
about 11 pm.</B>
<BR><B>She saw a blurriness down the hall (the rocker faces the hall) and
thought</B>
<BR><B>that her contacts were acting up. She blinked a few times and the
blurriness</B>
<BR><B>became more solid and formed a human shape. My sister states that
the image</B>
<BR><B>appeared to be floating a foot or two off of the floor and she could
not see</B>
<BR><B>the details of the person. She began yelling oh my god oh my god
and her</B>
<BR><B>girlfriend thought that someone was breaking in her home and was
going to</B>
<BR><B>call the police. She then said that the image formed into a ball
and "flew"</B>
<BR><B>out towards the window. She did not see anything again until this
year on</B>
<BR><B>oct 3rd (aprox the same date we did not note the date last year
but it was</B>
<BR><B>the first week of oct) This year she woke up at 5 am to get the
baby and</B>
<BR><B>thought she saw someone in her living room. She turned but it had</B>
<BR><B>disappeared so she thought she was just tired and seeing things.
She took</B>
<BR><B>care of the baby and went back to bed. She woke up at 7 30 to get
her older</B>
<BR><B>children (7 and 8) up for school. She then went downstairs to get
breakfast</B>
<BR><B>ready while they dressed. She walked into her kitchen and there
was a women</B>
<BR><B>sitting at her kitchen table. She let out a startled yell and the
women</B>
<BR><B>disappeared. It was at that moment that my sister realized it was
a ghost.</B>
<BR><B>She ran upstairs and got her husband up they looked around but could
not</B>
<BR><B>find anything. She then proceeded to make breakfast. She has a habit
of</B>
<BR><B>drinking Pepsi in the morning and realized there were none left
in the</B>
<BR><B>refrigerator. She walked to the door of the attached garage to get
more</B>
<BR><B>Pepsi and as she passed the basement (which is the children's playroom)
she</B>
<BR><B>saw the woman standing there again. This time my sister just looked
at her</B>
<BR><B>and the woman looked back a moment then disappeared. My sister states
that</B>
<BR><B>this ghost appeared as a solid woman and if she did not disappear
she would</B>
<BR><B>not have realized that she was a ghost. My sister said that the
woman was</B>
<BR><B>wearing a red and burnt orange dress with flowers on it (70s style
she</B>
<BR><B>thinks)(my sister is 28 so the 70s were before her time). The woman
appeared</B>
<BR><B>to be about forty years old with black curly hair. The woman appeared
to</B>
<BR><B>notice my sister but did not move towards her or appear to try to
speak.</B>
<BR><B>Other notables are that directly behind my sisters house is an old
cemetery</B>
<BR><B>and to the back left is a church where the do have an occasional
funeral.</B>
<BR><B>Also, my brother in law states that the previous owner told him
that the</B>
<BR><B>owner before him was a woman who dropped dead on the front lawn
of an</B>
<BR><B>aneurysm. (we are looking into the house history on this) My sister
is</B>
<BR><B>pretty sure that the women across the street knew the woman who
died at that</B>
<BR><B>time but is afraid to approach her about it. She did not want to
tell me</B>
<BR><B>about this because she thought people would think she was losing
it. She and</B>
<BR><B>I are sane and educated people who did not believe in the paranormal
prior</B>

<P><B>Sleep Lab Hauntings</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sazama@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Dave:&nbsp; I've been reading this stories for a long time...in fact...I
found</B>
<BR><B>this site when researching hauntings after my haunting experiences
in the</B>
<BR><B>sleep lab.&nbsp; I work nights, but I'm never tired during my shift,
so I'm</B>
<BR><B>positive I'm not hallucinating or just "seeing things."</B>
<BR><B>I am 25 years old and living in Salt Lake City.&nbsp; I work in
a hospital's</B>
<BR><B>sleep lab doing all night sleep studies.&nbsp; During a one month
period I was</B>
<BR><B>rotated to one of our company's other sleep labs for training on
different</B>
<BR><B>sleep equipment and different software.&nbsp; This is where my experiences
began.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; The sleep lab is set up with five rooms in a row.&nbsp; The
first room is the</B>
<BR><B>"tech room."&nbsp; This is where we have monitors that allow us
to see into our</B>
<BR><B>patients rooms and hear what is going one in the rooms.&nbsp; The
other four</B>
<BR><B>rooms are for the patients.&nbsp; There is a long hall runs outside
that is</B>
<BR><B>approximately 35-40 yards long.&nbsp; I've never been one to believe
or</B>
<BR><B>disbelieve in ghosts up until this point.&nbsp; I suppose you could
call me open</B>
<BR><B>minded. Anyway, I was walking up the hall (I'm getting chills thinking
about</B>
<BR><B>it right now) to put some electrodes and equipment into the rooms
before the</B>
<BR><B>patients arrived.&nbsp; Out of nowhere, the hair on my arms and
neck stood up,</B>
<BR><B>and the air around me got VERY cold.&nbsp; I felt like there was
someone watching</B>
<BR><B>me.&nbsp; I quickly threw the electrodes onto the beds and got back
into the Tech</B>
<BR><B>room and just tried to forgot about the incident.&nbsp; After about
five minutes</B>
<BR><B>of filling out paperwork, I saw a black figure rush by the door
to the tech</B>
<BR><B>room.&nbsp; I checked to see if a patient had arrived, but nobody
was there.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>went back to my work.&nbsp; Again...a black shadowy rush by the
door in a blur</B>
<BR><B>going the opposite direction.&nbsp; I checked again.&nbsp; My co-worker
was chuckling.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; He said something like, "don't tell me you're seeing things
by the door."</B>
<BR><B>I was FLOORED.&nbsp; I asked my co-worker if he'd ever "felt" anything
weird</B>
<BR><B>going on in the lab.&nbsp; He said that he hadn't, but most of the
other techs</B>
<BR><B>thought the lab was haunted.</B>
<BR><B>The next night I was working with another Technician.&nbsp; I was
telling her</B>
<BR><B>about my "feelings" and "seeing" something by the door.&nbsp; She
said she thinks</B>
<BR><B>she sees that shadowy figure too, but is never quite fast enough
to actually</B>
<BR><B>see what it is.&nbsp; The way we were sitting, she was facing me
with her back to</B>
<BR><B>the monitors.&nbsp; I just happened to be looking at the monitor
for room #3 when</B>
<BR><B>I saw something brush across the camera.&nbsp; The patients image
on the monitor</B>
<BR><B>was swaying side to side in a way that would imply the camera in
the room</B>
<BR><B>was moving.&nbsp; I starred in awe at what I just saw trying to
decide if I was</B>
<BR><B>imagining it.&nbsp; Once I snapped out of it, I said, "look at room
#3."&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>second she turned around, the picture was motionless again.&nbsp;
"I swear...it</B>
<BR><B>moved back and forth about five times."&nbsp; We kept talking about
the "ghost"</B>
<BR><B>and other stories, but her eyes never left the monitor for room
#3.&nbsp; After</B>
<BR><B>about five minutes of her starring at it, I said, "I don't think
it's going</B>
<BR><B>to do it again.&nbsp; It was probably just equipment malfunction."&nbsp;
Right then</B>
<BR><B>the shadow brushed across it and the image moved again the exact
same way.</B>
<BR><B>My co-worker shrieked loud enough to wake up the patient in room
#1.&nbsp; I was</B>
<BR><B>just satisfied that she wouldn't think I was crazy.&nbsp; After
a night of trying</B>
<BR><B>to see what it was walking by the Tech room and listening to the
sounds of</B>
<BR><B>soft footsteps on the short carpet, I checked the camera in room
#3.&nbsp; I got</B>
<BR><B>the chills again...BIG TIME...but I was determined to see if the
camera</B>
<BR><B>mounting was loose.&nbsp; IT WASN'T.&nbsp; I pushed pretty hard
trying to move it and</B>
<BR><B>it wouldn't budge.&nbsp; My co-worker said that the image barely
moved while I</B>
<BR><B>was pushing on it.&nbsp; This happened at a Geriatric Hospital.&nbsp;
Who knows what</B>
<BR><B>all has happened in there.</B>
<BR><B>The other thing happened at my main lab.&nbsp; A patient came in,
was hooked up,</B>
<BR><B>and fell asleep before we even started the test.&nbsp; This was
my very first day</B>
<BR><B>on the job.&nbsp; I was looking at the monitor and asked what the
football shaped</B>
<BR><B>orb was floating around the room.&nbsp; It was swirling over the
body of the</B>
<BR><B>sleeping patient.&nbsp; My supervisor said that it was probably
just lighting</B>
<BR><B>from outside getting in.&nbsp; Another Tech went into the room to
check what</B>
<BR><B>could be causing it.&nbsp; Everyone else kept watching the dancing
orb.&nbsp; As he</B>
<BR><B>entered the room, the orb starting circling him and swirling around
his</B>
<BR><B>outstretched arms.&nbsp; As he walked closer to the window (and
camera) it</B>
<BR><B>increased in size suggesting that it was also getting closer to
the window.</B>
<BR><B>He came out and said that there was no way light was getting in,
and that he</B>
<BR><B>couldn't see anything while he was in there.&nbsp; He and I went
into the room</B>
<BR><B>this time.&nbsp; According to my supervisor, the "orb" swirled around
me and my</B>
<BR><B>arms too.&nbsp; It is now a year and a half after that happened
and it hasn't</B>
<BR><B>happened since.&nbsp; I think this was a case of a haunted person.&nbsp;
Or maybe it</B>
<BR><B>was their guardian angel...who know.</B>
<BR><B>All I know is that the other lab still has freaky things happening
in it.</B>
<BR><B>Just a couple weeks ago, one of my friends (another Tech) was working
there.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; He was in the Tech room on the computer with his back to
the door (about</B>
<BR><B>10 feet from it).&nbsp; The other tech wento to respond to one of
the patients</B>
<BR><B>who needed to use the bathroom.&nbsp; My friend felt a hard tapping
on his</B>
<BR><B>shoulder.&nbsp; He turned around because he thought the other tech
had returned</B>
<BR><B>and was trying to get his attention.&nbsp; THERE WAS NOBODY THERE.&nbsp;
I was</B>
<BR><B>laughing so hard when he told me this.&nbsp; (he called me right
after it</B>
<BR><B>happened since I was working at this lab that night)&nbsp; It made
a believer out</B>
<BR><B>of him.&nbsp; There's other strange things going on in that hospital,
but I've</B>
<BR><B>never experienced any of it, so I won't comment on it second hand.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: voss@uwccc.wisc.edu</B><B></B>

<P><B>This particular event took place a week before xmas, over 13 years
ago.</B>
<BR><B>Some family members and friends were gathered to celebrate my</B>
<BR><B>father-in-laws birthday at his 120yr. old farmhouse. Everyone that
was</B>
<BR><B>invited, was there, in the house. My mother-in-law, a lady friend
and</B>
<BR><B>myself were seated in the back living room, chatting. In the same
room</B>
<BR><B>there was a door with a glass-curtained window pane that exited
to an</B>
<BR><B>unused, neglected porch. As we were talking, someone, or something
knocked</B>
<BR><B>as clear as a bell on the glass. A five rapped knock. My husband
was</B>
<BR><B>sitting out in the dining room and also heard the knock. We all
looked at</B>
<BR><B>each other and grinned, thinking, "Who's playing Saint Nick?" Years
ago</B>
<BR><B>when I was a child, an adult would dress like Saint Nick and go
around the</B>
<BR><B>outside of the house rapping on the windows to let us children know
that he</B>
<BR><B>was 'watching us'. So we assumed one of my husband's brother's did</B>
<BR><B>this....but a quick check proved that all were present.....inside.&nbsp;
We</B>
<BR><B>looked outside the door and there were no footprints. There was
no wind</B>
<BR><B>blowing. There was no traffic. We checked the bedroom above the
living room</B>
<BR><B>and looked at the windows to make sure nothing fell or slammed shut.
All</B>
<BR><B>logical explanations were ruled out. I just shrugged and said to
my</B>
<BR><B>father-in-law, "Maybe it was Louis (his father) coming back to wish
you a</B>
<BR><B>happy birthday!"</B><B></B>

room a clock fell right off of the wall.&nbsp; No one else was around.&nbsp;
It's not like the thing was barely hanging there.&nbsp; It was fairly secure.&nbsp;
And all of&nbsp; sudden it fell right down.&nbsp; Another case...I was
taking care of some business in the restroom, which shares a door to the
embalming room.&nbsp; Things were quiet and I heard a woman's voice "I'm
very cold."&nbsp; The only woman in that room was deceased.&nbsp; I asked
the two women on duty if they were in the preparation room and they both
said no.&nbsp; There have also been happenings of jingling keys and knocking

<BR><B>Navy Boot Camp</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ninnerz316@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>While in boot camp just a few months ago for the Navy,</B>
<BR><B>a group of us were in the bathroom, or "The head" as</B>
<BR><B>they were called. While cleaning the bathroom, all of</B>
<BR><B>a sudden, we heard this scream. It was the type of</B>
<BR><B>scream that is loud and fades. Like someone was being</B>
<BR><B>pushed off of a building or jumped to their death.</B>
<BR><B>Keep in mind, this is boot camp so death and suicides</B>
<BR><B>can happend. It just so happened that the level we</B>
<BR><B>were on, was the 3rd level, and is the highest level</B>
<BR><B>there was. That freaked us all out. Nobody outside the</B>
<BR><B>bathroom heard the scream.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Well..... During basic training, I had injured my</B>
<BR><B>back and they had put me into a convalescent unit with</B>
<BR><B>the other hurt recruits. The barracks was the most</B>
<BR><B>isolated from the other barracks. Rumor has it, it was</B>
<BR><B>a looney bin and a fire wiped out the 3rd level of the</B>
<BR><B>barracks killing some people. By the looks of the</B>
<BR><B>building, it did appear to be some type of mental</B>
<BR><B>institution. One night while standing watch, I was in</B>
<BR><B>the back of the barracks looking at the door. There is</B>
<BR><B>a see through window on the door when all of a sudden,</B>
<BR><B>this black image came from the wall outside of the</B>
<BR><B>door and went straight. However, there was no where</B>
<BR><B>for the image to go. The door it looked like he was</B>
<BR><B>heading too, is secured so nobody can go through the</B>
<BR><B>door. It wasn't the figure of a living person either.</B>
<BR><B>It was obvious it was that of a human, but not a</B>
<BR><B>living one. The figure came right from the wall. I</B>
<BR><B>wasn't scared really. Just more of a shock.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; A friend of mine in RCU was standing watch one</B>
<BR><B>night. I was restless and didnt want to sleep so I</B>
<BR><B>went to the back of the room to talk to her even</B>
<BR><B>though I wasnt supposed to. I was going to head back</B>
<BR><B>to my rack when all of a sudden I heard a loud noise.</B>
<BR><B>I looked back to my friend and she was in pure shock.</B>
<BR><B>She wouldn't speak and was holding her head. What had</B>
<BR><B>happened was the coat rack literally flew off the wall</B>
<BR><B>and over the fan that was standing there and hit her</B>
<BR><B>in the head. She was so freaked out by it she wouldnt</B>
<BR><B>stand watch in the area no more.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Another night a couple hours before we went to</B>
<BR><B>sleep, one of the RDC's went to the 3rd level. All of</B>
<BR><B>a sudden, he ran back down and was freaking out. He</B>
<BR><B>told us that while he was up there, a ghostly figure</B>
<BR><B>dressed in dress blues had saluted him and suddenly</B>
<BR><B>disappeared. While doing watch, I'd see figures and</B>
<BR><B>shadows. There is a spirt we'd called the Reveille</B>
<BR><B>ghost. During the night sometimes, people would wake</B>
<BR><B>up during the night because they heard the words</B>
<BR><B>"reveille reveille" being whispered in their ears.</B>
<BR><B>After spending 3 weeks in RCU it was determined my</B>
<BR><B>back injury wasn't going to get better so they went me</B>

<P><B>Strange Bumps in the Night</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mrjustice83@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Very interesting page, I enjoy the stories greatly.&nbsp; Here are
some of my run</B>
<BR><B>ends with ghosts.&nbsp; My parents house is haunted it would seem.&nbsp;
The house was</B>
<BR><B>built in the early 1980's in a new sub-division, an old farm used
to occupy</B>
<BR><B>the land it was built on.&nbsp; I was a senior in high school when
we moved in</B>
<BR><B>and I first noticed the extra house guests in a month or so.&nbsp;
I would awaken</B>
<BR><B>to my bed being gently shaken back and forth.&nbsp; I told my Mom
of the</B>
<BR><B>incidents and she dismissed them as me dreaming.&nbsp; I decided
to make sure, so</B>
<BR><B>the next time it happened I awakened and sure enough the bed was
gently</B>
<BR><B>shaking.&nbsp; I was laying on my side with my arms folded. I pinched
my forearm</B>
<BR><B>confirming, I WAS awake.&nbsp; After about what seemed forever but
in reality was</B>
<BR><B>5 mins. I decided I wanted to try and see what was doing it since
from my</B>
<BR><B>current angle I could see nothing.&nbsp; So I turned quickly and
jumped out of</B>
<BR><B>bed to find nothing.&nbsp; As time went on other events started
happening to</B>
<BR><B>other members of the house and they were noticed.&nbsp; We had security
system in</B>
<BR><B>the house with a laser detector in the main hallway which was probably
50ft</B>
<BR><B>in length.&nbsp; When you pass in front of it the unit in the kitchen
makes a</B>
<BR><B>clicking sound.&nbsp; On many occasions you would be in the kitchen
which is one</B>
<BR><B>end of the hallway and where the laser unit is located and it would
click</B>
<BR><B>indicating the beam had been broken and you would be the only person
there</B>
<BR><B>and on the other side of the kitchen.</B>
<BR><B>Strangely the events seem to occur in spurts, it might be active
for months</B>
<BR><B>and then little of nothing for months.&nbsp; My parents would often
wake me and</B>
<BR><B>my brothers and sister in the middle of the night asking if we had
fallen</B>
<BR><B>down going to the kitchen or bathroom, only to find us fast asleep.&nbsp;
They</B>
<BR><B>would here terrible crashing sounds from the kitchen area.&nbsp;
Their toy poodle</B>
<BR><B>would hear it as well and go crazy barking.&nbsp; One night after
all the kids</B>
<BR><B>had married and moved out around 4:00a.m. the dog started growling
and woke</B>
<BR><B>my parents up.&nbsp; They both heard the back door near the kitchen
open and</B>
<BR><B>close and someone walking down the hallway.&nbsp; My Dad grabbed
his .45 caliber</B>
<BR><B>handgun and waited just inside the bedroom door for the would be
goblin</B>
<BR><B>thinking someone had managed to pick the lock or got a key.&nbsp;
The steps</B>
<BR><B>stopped outside the bedroom door and he waited, gun at the ready
and the dog</B>
<BR><B>going crazy.&nbsp; After about 5 mins. and nothing happening and
no more sounds</B>
<BR><B>he opened the door ready to engage a would be goblin and nothing
was there.</B>
<BR><B>He searched the house room to room, all the way to the back door
which he</B>
<BR><B>found shut and locked securely.</B>
<BR><B>Personal items disappear especially my Mom and sisters jewelry and
they find</B>
<BR><B>it in the strangest places.&nbsp; My Mom's engagement ring vanished
from the</B>
<BR><B>drawer in her chest where she stored her jewelry.&nbsp; She tore
the hosue apart</B>
<BR><B>looking for it and gave up thinking that maybe the exterminator
or some</B>
<BR><B>other service person had taken it but why just that item, there
were other</B>
<BR><B>piecs worth more in the drawer.&nbsp; Finally after giving up on
it and some 7</B>
<BR><B>yrs. later it re-appeared in a very strange place.&nbsp; I had an
old writing</B>
<BR><B>desk in my room I had used through college.&nbsp; I was getting
married and my</B>
<BR><B>bride and I would be living with my parents for a few months until
we could</B>
<BR><B>find a place of our own.&nbsp; I needed the space and was out of
college except</B>
<BR><B>for a few grad. classes I was taking on the side, so I cleaned the
desk out,</B>
<BR><B>and I mean everything.&nbsp; There was NOTHING in it when I moved
it to the foyer</B>
<BR><B>of the house.&nbsp; Two weeks later my sister came in from college
and was</B>
<BR><B>cleaning and decided to clean the inside of the desk, not knowing
it had</B>
<BR><B>just been cleaned.&nbsp; She started and found it empty except for
one drawer</B>
<BR><B>which contained my Mom's engagement ring.&nbsp; It was empty two
weeks earlier...</B>
<BR><B>On several occasions the back door has opened by itself sometimes
gently and</B>
<BR><B>sometimes violently like its about to be torn off, in all cases
the house</B>
<BR><B>was sealed tightly, so there was no vacum effect.&nbsp; One brother
had a couple</B>
<BR><B>of weeks of intense activity in his room.&nbsp; One night he sat
watching ESPN</B>
<BR><B>and heard a noise looked over at the wall where it was coming from
and</B>
<BR><B>watched a nail holding a poster in work its way out of the wall
and then the</B>
<BR><B>poster fall to the floor.&nbsp; A night or two later he was tired
and had just</B>
<BR><B>turned the tv off for the night in his room and heard what sounded
to be</B>
<BR><B>sometime tapping one finger at a time starting at the end of his
chest,</B>
<BR><B>across the tv and back down to the chest.&nbsp; He raised up and
said I am pretty</B>
<BR><B>tired, I don't want to be bothered tonight and it left him alone
for the</B>
<BR><B>night.&nbsp; The next week, he heard what he thought was something
rummaging</B>
<BR><B>around in his closet.&nbsp; He was laying on his side facing away
from it and</B>
<BR><B>turned over to see what it was because he did have a cat and at
times he</B>
<BR><B>would sneak into the house.&nbsp; When he looked he saw nothing
but experienced</B>
<BR><B>what I beleive the Old Hag effect of something evil on his chest.&nbsp;
He tried</B>
<BR><B>to call out for anyone in the house but couldn't say anything.&nbsp;
After he</B>
<BR><B>said what seemed to be 5-10 mins, he managed to softly say Jesus
and it</B>
<BR><B>stopped.</B>
<BR><B>Neighbors have noticed the events as well.&nbsp; On one occassion
my brother was</B>
<BR><B>playing nintendo with a neighbor who was around 17 at the time and
both were</B>
<BR><B>in the den on the couch when the light switch in the den turned
off.&nbsp; He</B>
<BR><B>looks and the neighbor and said did you do that?&nbsp; No I am over
here I can't</B>
<BR><B>reach it, did you?&nbsp; No I can't reach it from here either.&nbsp;
They were the</B>
<BR><B>only people in the house at the time.&nbsp; My aunt and uncle who
before claimed</B>
<BR><B>they had lived in a haunted house visited one night and stayed in
my old</B>
<BR><B>bedroom(shaking bed) we told them nothing about the incidents when
they</B>
<BR><B>arrived.&nbsp; The next morning they said something happened but
would not</B>
<BR><B>elaborate about it.&nbsp; Then we told them, still they said nothing
and haven't</B>
<BR><B>stayed since in the house. My wife came out of the bathroom into
the long</B>
<BR><B>hallway one night and looked toward the kitchen, there was a dim
light on</B>
<BR><B>somewhere in the kitchen, usually a night light.&nbsp; She saw the
outline of a</B>
<BR><B>male figure from the waist up, standing there looking into the dining
room</B>
<BR><B>like he was trying to look out the window.&nbsp; She could see through
him.&nbsp; She</B>
<BR><B>tore down the hall, slammed and locked our bedroom door and tore
into the</B>
<BR><B>bed next to me scared to death.&nbsp; There are many many more stories
about this</B>
<BR><B>house I could tell.&nbsp; My parents still live there and things
still happen.</B>

<P><B>Stranger Walking</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Amy_Staniewicz@es.adp.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;I haven't&nbsp; told anyone this story who is outside of my
circle of</B>
<BR><B>friends, but I thought I would share it after reading some the stories
on</B>
<BR><B>your site.&nbsp; This happened probably back in 1986 when I was
still in grammer</B>
<BR><B>school and life seemed so much easier back then.&nbsp; Well one
night my best</B>
<BR><B>friend and I were playing on her front porch right across the street
from my</B>
<BR><B>house, and right next door to a funeral home.&nbsp; Anyway it was
the first day</B>
<BR><B>of spring and we were playing with our dolls, when we heard someone
scream</B>
<BR><B>and then saw a hockey stick thrown up in the air.&nbsp; I have to
say from her</B>
<BR><B>porch we can not see the street that runs paraell to our&nbsp; street.because
of</B>
<BR><B>the ivy on a small hill belonging to the funeral home. Distracted
by the</B>
<BR><B>scream we waited looking at the conner for some to walk out from
behind the</B>
<BR><B>ivy, but no one did.&nbsp; We could shrug it off being children
and curious so we</B>
<BR><B>walked down to the conner to take a look and maybe see what was
going on.</B>
<BR><B>Well we saw something, but I am not sure what it was.&nbsp; It looked
like a man</B>
<BR><B>walking, but for a warm day he was wearing a black hat, black trench
coat,</B>
<BR><B>black pants (sounds pretty normal), but it wasn't his cloths that
caught our</B>
<BR><B>eyes was the color of his skin that was such a pale white it looked
like the</B>
<BR><B>color of fresh snow.&nbsp; He was walking down the street, well
I should say</B>
<BR><B>walking because he was walking in place.&nbsp; My friend and I ran
back to her</B>
<BR><B>house, not a minute late I ran back down to the conner to see and
he was</B>
<BR><B>gone....</B>

<P><B>Talk About Weird</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: EastonXL16@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this encounter happened when i was 16, about
2 years ago. i was sleeping in my bed and it was a very chilly night so
i was bundled up pretty well with blankets and a comforter.&nbsp; i would
have to say the time was early in the morning and i was dead asleep.&nbsp;
i woke up and i felt something moving the covers down to about my waist.
at first i thought i did it myself so i didnt think anything of it.&nbsp;
and i knew i was awake because i felt the cold air hit me. so i started
pulling the covers back up.&nbsp; as i pulled the covers up then i felt
a hand sort of pet my arm and i stopped frozen.&nbsp; i heard a young ladies
voice said specifically, "It will be ok. It will be ok."&nbsp; i was still
frozen. i couldnt even open my eyes. i didnt want to.&nbsp; after a few
seconds after the lady stopped talking i pulled the cover up over my arms,
almost completely over my head.&nbsp; you could say i was scared shitless.&nbsp;
i peeked over the covers and saw nothing, just an empty room.&nbsp; i know
it was not a real person that did it because i always close my door completely
when i go to bed. also if someone opens it it makes a squeaking sound.
and i did not hear a thing and the door was still closed. also, obvioulsy
the windows were closed because it was freezing outside.&nbsp; thats the
first and hopefully the last time that happens to me. peace.</B>

<P><B>Real Stories in my Life</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: courtneycomputer@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I have experienced paranormal,sighting's,feeling's and smells as
well as all of the other people who are on your site.First of all I would
like to thank you and your staff and organizations for talking about all
this stuff. I for one have always believed in ghost's and such,and now
I have other's to chat with about it.</B>
<BR><B>The first thing that ever happened to me was the winter in 1994
my grandmother died. My brother and I were distraught beyond belief.One
night we were both sleeping(our rooms were upstairs across from each other)
and for no reason I woke up and glanced out in the hallway.I heard my brother
crying and he said "look there is something moving in the hall". I watched
this cloud of sorts come into my room and stand at the end of my bed.The
cloud wrapped around my bed post and what looked like my grandmother's
fingers began to appear clearer and clearer.I knew it was her.I could feel
the room get warm and fuzzy, and I started crying.Then I sat up quickly
to grab "her" and the cloud was gone. My brother and I still remember that
night.</B>
<BR><B>The second story was me driving home from night college. I was driving
down Sheridan south with the Fort Logan War Cemetery on my left. It was
about 10:45 PM and no one was on the road up near the cemetery. I looked
away from the road for 2 seconds and when I raised my head up again there
was as&nbsp; plan as day,a man pulling a cart with a body on it&nbsp; over
into the cemetery. He was dressed in either Civil war clothing or some
type of older(maybe even&nbsp;&nbsp; Vietnam)clothing,from a war not recent,it
could have even been WW1 or WW1 . He stopped and I slowed way down, then
he looked at me for a second and disappeared.I felt very nervous and afraid
after that the whole way home.And for about three or four months after
that.Now whenever I drive by that cemetery I do not look over towards it.</B>
<BR><B>One day recently we had to go in it for memorial day,and I felt
so weird the whole time.</B>
<BR><B>The third story happened at my home in Littleton,Colorado.About
one year ago.</B>
<BR><B>I have seen so many odd thing 's in my house but this was the weirdest.
I was home alone and it was about 3:00 P.M. in the afternoon.I was in our
basement shower,when all of a sudden I heard glass break.So I went up stairs
and sure enough there was glass all over the foyer floor. No one was home
but me.We did not have any cats or dogs or any animals either.</B>
<BR><B>So I got back in the shower and about three minutes later, I heard
children laughing as though they were right outside the bathroom door.Also
I heard what was my bed bumping against the floor above me where my room
is.As if something was jumping on it. When I turned off the water I could
still faintly hear them. So I turned the water on as low as I could and
started walking upstairs to hear the kids laughing louder. When I got right
to the top it ceased almost automatically. I walked into my room and I
am not even joking, my blankets on my bed were dented in like if a child
was jumping on them. I always make my bed tightly tucked in and smooth.
I haven't heard the laughter since then.But while this was going on I was
not scared at all. I thought it was great.</B>
<BR><B>OK this is my last one that I can remember enough to write to you
about.</B>
<BR><B>Sometimes when I am by myself,extreme temperatures engulf me.Cold
or Hot.</B>
<BR><B>We have this lake across from our house and one day I was sitting
outside on our porch and the sensation of extreme hot came over me and
it was pretty cool out so I thought to myself, wait this is odd.So I decided
to play a game with the sensation and it started moving towards the street
so I eventually followed it down by the lake, were mist was rising off
of the lake because of the chilly weather.When I got down there I was stopped
it was like I could not move. Then I threw up out of no where. And the
hot sensation was gone.Weird weird.....</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The Blue Lady's Door</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Jealousy580@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was 9 years old I was spending the night over at my friend
Megan's house for the first time. There was no one there but Megan and
I, until her 14 year old sister got home.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; It was around 10:30 when her sister got home and when she
did we were in Christine's room watching T. V and&nbsp; they have never
had any problems with ghosts or anything. but we kept on hearing a bumping
noise in the hallway by her door. so we went out there and in the clothes
basket there was a blue figure about 3 feet tall and it had a woman's face
in it. she looked at us and shot down the hall and disappeared</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; we shut the door and called her Mom&nbsp; and she just told
us to go 2 sleep because she thought we were just seeing things.</B>
<BR><B>so we got off the phone with her and 5 minutes later we heard it
again&nbsp; but we didn't open the door we just went up to the door. a
she had a poster of a basketball player on the door that she got from little
Caesar's and the poster started to change colors.the basket ball turned
gray and an eagle head arpeared on the shorts of the basketball player.and
there was a shadow on the poster and it looked like it was getting bigger
so i got a pin and marked it and the shadow went over the mark i had put
on there. and&nbsp; when i kept doing that the bumping&nbsp; sound got
louder. so we opened the door and she came in and we ran to the corner
and she pushed us down and floated to the top of the ceiling and started
screaming and going around in circles. so we ran out and went into the
bathroom. and we opened the door and looked at her door and the door knob
started to move up and down the door then her door flew wide open and there
she was floating there staring at us. Megan screamed and she came floating
to the bathroom and she looked at Megan and Megan's hair started to change
into a blue color so we ran out of the house. that night we stayed over
at her cousins house but didn't tell anyone what had happened. the next
day we went back over there and got her poster and burned it. they didn't
have anymore problems until about 2 months later when her little brother
had switched rooms with Christine and put a poster on the door. and that
night when he was about to go to sleep he heard something calling his name
so he got up and went to the door and sure enough there she was in the
clothes basket and she looked at him and shot down the hall and disappeared
so we ran and got Megan and Megan knew what it was but didn't tell anyone
but Christine and me. so Bryan stayed in there with Megan and the next
day Christine went in there and took the poster off the door. and they
haven't had anymore problems ever since</B>

<P><B>The Breakfast Ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: keko@rcn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Until I was seven years old my family lived in a small farmhouse
on Church Road in Mt. Laurel, NJ&nbsp; (the exact location is now the back
parking lot of Denny's on Route 73).&nbsp; When I was four I woke up one
night to the smell of coffee brewing and bacon sizzling in the pan.&nbsp;
Turning over, I could see light at the top of the stairs as though someone
was downstairs.&nbsp; Naturally I thought it was my mother making breakfast
and I wondered why she was up making breakfast when it was still dark outside.&nbsp;
I got out of bed and tiptoed out into the hallway and looked down the stairs.&nbsp;
The stairs seemed to disappear and at the bottom of the stairwell where
you'd turn left to go into the living room was a round table covered with
a cloth.&nbsp; A man and a woman in funny looking clothes were seated at
the table eating and a third woman was cooking something at a big black
stove.&nbsp; The three of them were dressed in black clothes (except the
man was wearing a white shirt) and the women's dresses had sleeves that
were puffed at the top (leg-of-mutton?) and touched the floor.&nbsp; Never
in a million years did I think they were ghosts because I knew ghosts looked
like white sheets floating in the air, right?&nbsp; I stood there watching
them and wondering how they got into the house ... because they were as
real looking as my own parents.&nbsp; The woman seated at the table looked
up at me and asked me to come down and join them (I couldn't understand
her words, but I understood their meaning).&nbsp; "I can't come down,"
I answered, "I'm not allowed to go downstairs at night by myself."&nbsp;
My mother, hearing my voice came out into the hall and put me back to bed.&nbsp;
I asked her why those people were having breakfast in our house and gained
the label as being the "one with the imagination"!&nbsp; From that time
(1954) until we moved out (1957) I'd smell that coffee and bacon and see
those people having breakfast two or three times a year.&nbsp; I was never
afraid because I never realized they were 'ghosts'.&nbsp; Years later,
my grandmother told me that that house had been bought by my great-grandparents
right after WWI as a summer home.&nbsp; They bought it from an Italian
family who spoke very little English.&nbsp; And the original kitchen had
been where the stairwell was.&nbsp; Just a coincidence?</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The Cat Came Back</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: beckoncall3@home.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was a nurse, working the 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. shift in a hospital,
when I got my cat Rowdy. He was a typical young cat--nutsy--and would punish
me for being away from him all night. He got into the trash, broke things,
and was generally a naughty boy. I decided he needed a companion, so I
got him a young kitten named Pyewacket. Immediately things settled down,
mainly because becoming a new mother wore him out! Pyesie wouldn't let
Rowdy out of his sight!&nbsp; Rowdy and Pyesie had many happy years together
until Rowdy died of cancer at the age of twelve. Although Pyesie was in
attendance at Rowdy's death, he still spent a couple of days looking for
him, meowing piteously and ceaselessly searching the house. Two days after
Rowdy's death, I was sitting on the floor, changing my young son's diaper.
Pyesie, being interested in all the baby's affairs, was sitting a few feet
away, watching the proceedings. Suddenly, from the stairway nearby, Rowdy
meowed his usual greeting, loud and clear. Pyesie immediately looked at
the stairs and walked over, staring intently at the stairs. The hairs on
my neck stood up and goosebumps covered my arms. After a few seconds Pyesie
came back and sat down. Rowdy had said "goodbye" and Pyesie knew it and
never searched for him again.</B>
<BR><B>Pyesie slept at the foot of my husband's and my bed at night. After
he died at the age of 17, for several years, I often felt him jump onto
the bed by my side and walk down to my feet where he would lie down. Even
now, ten years after his death, I will occasionally feel him jump on the
bed and settle down to sleep.</B>

<P><B>The Devil?</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: No1Shadowgirl@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I've been an advid lurker on this site for quit sometime now. I have
a few things to tell, but never really had the gumption to tell. But, last
night at work, a co-worker told me something that chilled me to the bone.
A bit of history first: I work in a prison that has been here for approx.
30 years.&nbsp; No one knows the ground that it was built on. It's state
owned. But, yes, there have been a few deaths there. Inmates as well as
correctional officers. Okay, enough history. I'll try my best to make sense
of this tale. I'll tell it in first person format, although it was told
by someone else. I did, however, get permission from this person to do
this. I do not claim this story to be my own.&nbsp; Heregoes:</B>
<BR><B>One night while I was putting inmates up from the dayroom, I had
an inmate become unruly. As he went to his room, he started cussing and
just trying to show off, saying I couldn't make him go. To discipline,
I packed all of his property, took his chair and placed it in the hallway.&nbsp;
He was laughing and saying that that didn't bother him, I could take all
his stuff, he was still going to "wile out". I said, ok. But as soon as
I took his chair out of his room, he became hysterical. I told him as long
as he was like that, I wouldn't stand there and talk to him. I always tell
the inmates if they want to talk about it, we can. But if they want to
yell and show they're butts, I won't talk to them. Anyway, I walked off
the hall. Apparently, one of the other inmates told him to try things my
way. That I would come and talk about it with him, and maybe we could work
something out. Well, the inmate got quiet, and about 20 mins. later, I
went to check on him. I asked him if he felt he could talk now instead
of crying. He said yes. He said that all he wanted was his chair. Now,
keep in mind, I had the rest of his property, i.e letters,clothes,his bed
mattress, his covers , and all he wanted was his chair. I thought to myself,
ok I'll play along. I said, "Ok.....why do you want your chair?" He then
told me that the Devil comes to see him every night, and if he doesn't
set the chair in a certain corner, the Devil will sit on his bed and ****
with his mind(his words) Part of me was thinkin, yeah, right. But, this
kid was sincere. He was crying real tears. He was visibly upset. He continues,
and says that one night he'd thought he'd be smart and turn the chair around
so the Devil wouldn't be staring at him. But he woke up during the night,
and the Devil had turned the chair around so that he was facing him and
told him not to do that again. The whole time, this kid is pointing to
the corner where he puts the chair, and I'm steadly backing away from this
corner. So i said"Ok get your chair." The look on his face was pure relief.
He came out to the hall, got his chair, and put it in the corner.&nbsp;
The whole time, saying "Thank you, I promise I'll never show out again.
I'll behave. You won't have anymore trouble from me"&nbsp; I said"Ok, go
to bed now. You'll get the rest back in a little bit."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Later that night, I went back to the boys room to give him his stuff, but
I couldn't bring myself to open his door. I was afraid I'd see the Devil.
This is how much this kid believed. He made me believe.&nbsp; And everytime
I made my rounds, I made sure not to shine my flashlight in the corner
where the chair was.&nbsp; That morning when I woke the inmates up, his
chair was where he had put it the night before.&nbsp; A couple of days
later, I moved him to another room.&nbsp; He said the Devil didn't come
see him there.&nbsp; Was it the room or the inmate? Although, other inmates
that have been moved to that room have complained of seeing floating green
eyes.</B>
<BR><B>Sorry this was so long, but you should have been there to hear it.
I have other tales, but will save them for another time. God bless, and
Happy Haunting!!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The Flowered Lady</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: msheldon12@home.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>This story I am about to tell is going to stay with me forever! It's
a really strange and mysterious story, and it all happened to my mom.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Here I go. One day when I was down at the lake with my grandma
and my dad was in Texas, my mom was home alone and decided to take a nap
on her bed. She was just about to doze off when she saw a young lady walk
in. The lady was wearing a blue summer dress and a blue flower in her hair.
And somehow her dress was blowing. She was reaching her arms out to mom
and telling her to come with her. That's when mom swung at her and she
disappeared! Then just last Christmas when I was 10, my mom found a box
of her old stuff in her closet. I asked if I could go through it, and she
said yes. As me and my mom were going through the box, I pulled out a picture
of someone. I asked mom who it was and she just stared in horror. Then
finally she said it was my great-grandma. She was freaked out because my
great-grandma was wearing the exact same dress as she saw in her bedroom!
It's kind of freaky but kind of cool.</B>

<P><B>The Footprints</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: johnsonville@moneymanagers.co.nz</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi, there this experience happened to me when i was about 19 years
of age iam now 26. I was staying at my best friends house for the night.i
woke up about 2 in the morning for some unknown reason. and was very cold.
which was weird considering it was the middle of summer. i just felt very
uneasy for some reason,.. luckily nothing happened, then, and i eventually
fell back to sleep.</B>
<BR><B>we both woke up the next morning early ready to go to work, when
we both saw them, there were 8 footprints in the carpet, not in dirt but
with water. you could tell they were footprints as the were the normal
shape . but in that area and the footprint area alone the carpet was soaked
through. the trail lead from the head of the bed i was sleeping in, just
to the wardrobe door. no where else...We still to this day try to come
up with a logical explanation for this but still haventt been able too.</B>
<BR><B>Story no 2... This happened to me when i was 12. My friend and i
had heard of the game called bloody mary... i suppose everyone has heard
of it at sometime in there lives. you are meant to look into a mirror in
a darikened room&nbsp; and chant the name Bloody Mary , Bloody Mary...
and you are supposed to see something horrible in the mirror. welll we
never had the guts to do it alone. so we though we would sit on the ground
and look at each other. After a few giggling attempts we finally got serious...
(my friend does not belive in anything like this and i am pretty sure she
though nothing would ever happen to us). i unfortunitly saw nothing, but
my friend jumped up all of a sudden screaming and ran off. (very unlike
her at all). I finally managed to catch up to her, in between sobs she
told me that me entire face had changed. i had long blond hair. not my
normal black short hair, and the worse part she told me was i had blood
coming out of my eyes........ this really freaked me, as juliane was not
the type to get upset at all. and she truely saw the blood on my face....
it was a very frightiening experience, one i would be v ery relutant to

<BR><B>The Ghost of Dean Street</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mcons@optonline.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I had always loved ghost stories as a kid. I guess, if asked,
I'd have said that, yes, I did indeed believe in them. I didn't however,
have a desire for any first-hand experience in that area, nor did I think
it would ever become an issue.&nbsp; I never really gave it much thought
since stuff like that didn't happen to "regular" people.</B>
<BR><B>I certainly wasn't thinking about ghosts the day my boyfriend moved
into his first apartment.&nbsp; It was actually quite convenient.&nbsp;
The house was right down the street from mine.&nbsp; It belonged to my
girl friend's grandmother. Her grandfather had died many years ago when
she was a little girl and her grandmother had taken ill and gone to live
with relatives 3000 miles away, taking very little with her. After leaving
the house unoccupied for some years, her family finally decided to rent
the house out, fully furnished, complete with everything, right down to
Grandma's salt and pepper shakers.&nbsp; Enter my boyfriend, who coincidently
had nothing, and boom, a perfect match.</B>
<BR><B>The house was an old colonial farmhouse that, to my knowledge, had
always been a two family. The grandmother lived downstairs, and the upstairs
tenants would vary from year to year.&nbsp; My girlfriend lived across
the street and, as a child, often visited her grandmother.&nbsp; Having
been friends for some 30 years, I can remember her telling me stories years
ago, about that house.&nbsp; The word "haunted" however, was never used
or even hinted at. Somehow, when you're a kid, chalking an unexplained
incident up to simply being "weird", sufficed.</B>
<BR><B>Looking back, I can't believe I didn't see the signs earlier.&nbsp;
The first dead give away, should have been my boyfriend's old cat.&nbsp;
At fifteen, all this cat wanted out of life was a little food, an occasional
tummy rub, and a couch to sleep on, preferably in the sun.&nbsp; (Not unlike
my boyfriend).</B>
<BR><B>It was hard to get old "Kitch" excited about anything, until he
brought her to his new apartment. From the very first day, that cat hated
that place. She would never enter the house of her own volition. When you
called her, she would sit across the street at the curb and stare at you,
and you would have go over, pick her up and carry her in, where upon entering
she would promptly dig her claws into your arm and struggle to get away.</B>
<BR><B>After a few days of "forced imprisonment", and a quick realization
that that's where the food was, Kitch settled down a bit but was never
truly comfortable or at ease. When she ate, she would nervously keep looking
back over her shoulder, and when she slept, she always kept "one eye open".
Sometimes she would jump up out of a sound sleep and stare into one corner
of the room at something unseen. Back arched, growling and hissing, she
would make a beeline for the door and scratch at it wildly until we let
her out. Oh, and did I mention that the cat was deaf? Stone deaf.</B>
<BR><B>Ofcourse being little more than teenagers and not of the "haunted"
mind-set at the time, we just chalked it up to senility. That is until
the walking started. Seated in the living room, you would clearly hear
some one walking around on the linoleum floor in the kitchen. (This is
where the deaf cat would freak and run for the door). If you paid very
close attention, you could actually follow their path as they walked from
the table to the stove to the sink and back. "Drafty, old houses creak"
my boyfriend said. Then there were the cold spots, which could usually
be found in front of the refrigerator. "Faulty gasket" he reasoned.&nbsp;
The stove that turned itself on wasn't quite so easy to explain since the
knobs were at the back of the appliance and could not have been accidentally
brushed by. I believe at the time, each of us thought the other one had
done it and wouldn't admit to it.</B>
<BR><B>Gradually we noticed that our friends were not as eager to come
over to his house anymore, though no one could (or would) say why. Perhaps
it was the ringing from that heavy, old, black dinosaur of a telephone,(which
was actually outside the apartment in the common hallway,) that un-nerved
them. Though hard-wired into the wall, it had been disconnected 10 years
prior. "Power surges", my boyfriend said.&nbsp; Interestingly enough, when
it rang, no one ever made a move to pick it up.</B>
<BR><B>I went along with all of his reasoning until the night after Christmas.
That night, my boyfriend, myself, and another good friend were watching
TV. The cat did another one of her jump-up-out-of-a-sound-sleep acts, stared
at the Christmas tree, hissed, and promptly threw herself at the front
door. My friend got up to let her out. Upon her return the phone rang,
just once, true to form. We resumed watching TV as if somehow this were
all normal, then the first ornament dropped off the tree.&nbsp; I bent
down to pick it up and noticed that the top prong was missing. Having no
way to re-hang it, I placed it in an ashtray on the table. I returned to
the couch when the second ball dropped.</B>
<BR><B>I knew I was very careful to pinch the hooks closed when I hung
the balls on the tree. We had cut down our own tree that year, and when
it finally "unfolded" in the house, it was quite a bit fuller than anticipated.
Figuring that it might get bumped into alot, I made sure that all the hooks
were secured to the branch and pinched tightly closed. How could two balls
just fall off? I picked up the second ball. It too was missing the prong.
Looking at the branch, I found the hook, and prong, still securely fastened
to the tree. It was as if it had been pulled off. We all looked at each
other uneasily. I again returned to my seat. No one said a word. Until
minutes later when a 3rd, 4th, and 5th balls dropped from the tree and
rolled across the room.</B>
<BR><B>My friend made a weak excuse about it being late, and practically
ran out of the house. I tried to remain calm as we decided it was time
to take down the tree. This effort was quickly abandoned however, when
I found the balls were dropping faster than I could remove them.</B>
<BR><B>Wanting no more at that moment than to get that tree out of the
house, we decided to sacrifice the few ornaments that were left. We picked
up the tree and tried to take it out the front door, but having tripled
in size since it's arrival, it wasn't budging.&nbsp; My boyfriend had to
go out the back door and run around the house to the front porch leaving
me alone inside.</B>
<BR><B>My boyfriend pulled from the outside and I pushed from the inside.
After a few more unsuccessful minutes, I yelled for him to stop. My hands
were scraped and sticky from the rough bark and pine needles. Suddenly,
that damn phone rang, practically stopping my heart in mid-beat. I could
hear behind me that the walking had started in the kitchen. The sound seemed
magnified in my ears. With my heartbeat pounding in my ears, I listened
intently, not daring to turn around. The walking sound stopped at the kitchen
doorway.&nbsp; With a chill winding it's way up my spine, I tried to shake
off the feeling that I was being watched.&nbsp; It didn't work, I was trapped
between whatever was watching me from that doorway and the damn tree that
stood between me and the safety of the outside</B>
<BR><B>With a renewed sense of urgency, forgetting all about my sore hands,&nbsp;
I screamed for my boyfriend to pull as hard as he could and I threw my
self into the tree with everything I had. Suddenly with a loud "thwump"
tree popped out of the doorway, with me flying out right behind it.&nbsp;
We took it over to the side of the house and threw it down the driveway,
ornaments, garland and all. Then we stood in the driveway for a few moments,
staring at the tree wondering what the hell had just happened. Realizing
only at this point that it had begun to snow, I turned to go back inside
when I noticed Kitch watching us from the porch of the house across the
street. I called to her but she ran away, leaving only her footprints behind.
We never saw her again after that.</B>
<BR><B>Coincidently, that was also the last time I went into that house
for many years to come. Neither of us ever spoke of the events of that
night. Somehow instinctively, we both new that verbalizing our fears over
the events of that evening would force us to come to terms with what had
really taken place. It was a deliberate, conscience choice on both our
parts, to remain blissfully ignorant.</B>
<BR><B>My boyfriend only lived there a few short months after that. While
he was still there, the walking sounds continued, forcing him to sleep
with stereo headphones every night. We eventually went our separate ways.</B>
<BR><B>The next time I set foot in that house was 17 years later. My girlfriend,
now in her 30's, was moving into the house and taking the upstairs apartment.
She asked for my help with the move. I was understandably hesitant, but
she assured me that the house was now "fine".&nbsp; Her grandmother had
passed on some time ago and the place had been cleaned out of all her belongings
and freshly painted. Even that old phone was gone.</B>
<BR><B>It had been rented to several different people in years since, and
no "problems" were ever reported. When I think back, I'm not sure that
she ever really believed me when I told her what went on in that house.&nbsp;
She said she did, but I always got the impression she was humoring me.</B>
<BR><B>Could she be right? Was all that just the over-blown imaginations
of a couple of teenagers? I wasn't prepared to say. After all, I was there.
Time would tell.</B>
<BR><B>The first day I crossed back over that threshold, I stared at the
door to the downstairs apartment. Almost instantly, I was 17 again and
had to fight the urge to turn tail and run. I took a deep breath and marched
upstairs armed with brooms, mops, and assorted cleaning products. After
a while we were sweeping, cleaning, and having a good laugh. The upstairs
apartment was bright and cheerful and I felt silly for my initial reaction.
I was now, after all, a grown-up. Thirty-something, married 12+ years with
2 kids.</B>
<BR><B>My first day back, I left with a new perspective on the old place.
Even the outside somehow looked friendlier. I helped my friend move in
and had even spent a couple of evenings there with her. Months went by
without incident. With her upstairs and a new family living downstairs,
the place seemed to have a new life and I had almost forgotten about its
history. Almost.</B>
<BR><B>One night, my friend and I had gone for coffee. As we were driving
home, we came across a lost dog, which we both manage to do almost regularly
and, of course, never at an hour when there's anywhere to take it. So here
we are at midnight on a Sunday with this dog. A huge black Lab, friendly
as can be, got right into the front seat with us wagging his muddy tail
all over the ceiling of her car. The dog pound doesn't open 'til 8am so
we decide to take him to my house for the night.</B>
<BR><B>He went bounding up my backstairs and into my house like he lived
there and was promptly greeted by my dog who wasn't nearly as thrilled
to see him.</B>
<BR><B>Back to her house with the dog we went. As we got out of the car
in her driveway, the dog became agitated and started to whine. We had to
pull him up her porch stairs. As she fumbled for her keys to the door,
the dog tried to bolt twice. She finally opened the door and we pulled
him into the hallway.&nbsp; It took the two of us to get him up her stairs
into her apartment. He clearly did not want to go, digging his feet into
the carpet the whole way. It wasn't until she wondered aloud, why he was
so eager to go into my house and not hers, that the past came rushing back
to the first night my boyfriend brought Kitch home. This house was not
fine, not by a long shot.</B>
<BR><B>I decided it was best not to voice my feelings to her that night.
I called her the next day to see how the night went.&nbsp; She said that
the dog whimpered all night and that she had to keep the leash on him to
keep him from scratching the door to get out.</B>
<BR><B>For the next few weeks, I made excuses not to go over there, sick
kids, etc. One night she confronted me on the phone and I told her the
truth. She confessed that she had had some subtle experiences here and
there herself. Missing keys that suddenly turn up in a bizarre place. An
unexplained glass in the sink. Small things that one notices when one lives
alone. Nothing concrete or glaring, just little things that she just couldn't
quite put her finger on. She went on about her business, ignoring the small
unexplainable incidents for several more weeks. Then the walking started.</B>
<BR><B>Once again only in the kitchen, only this time it was upstairs instead
of downstairs. Remembering the experiences I related to her so many years
ago, she thought that perhaps it could be her grandfather. She reasoned
that it couldn't be her grandmother because she was still alive back at
the time that this was happening to my boyfriend in the downstairs apartment
, and that it was most likely the same spirit. She said that if it was
indeed her grandfather, she could live with that. Why should she be afraid?
She did, after all, love her grandfather dearly. I went along with her
but remained unconvinced. I did notice however, that as time went by, she
was sleeping back at her mother's house more and&nbsp; more often.</B>
<BR><B>The clincher would come the night she saw what she calls the ‘shadow’.
The following event is as she relayed it to me: She had gone home to her
apartment after work intending to pick up some clothing before going to
her mother's. Having a terrible headache, she decided just to lie down
on the bed for a few minutes.&nbsp; The way the apartment is laid out,
the kitchen is the hub with all other rooms leading directly off of it.&nbsp;
It also happens to have an obnoxiously bright, fluorescent ceiling light
that sends blinding light out into every room around it. She had always
complained about this light pouring into her bedroom at night. The way
her bed was situated, it hit her right in the eyes. It was this same light
that was hitting her in the eyes this night as she lay down with a headache.&nbsp;
Lying there with her eyes shut tight against the light, too tired to move,
she thought to herself, "God, would someone turn that awful light out",
and just for an instant, she thought someone had.</B>
<BR><B>Her eyes flew open to find the light still on. "Now what the heck
was that?" she thought. With her head pounding she closed her eyes once
again. This time she, with her eyes closed, once again saw the light go
out, but waver a bit as if someone had come and stood at the foot of her
bed, temporarily blocking out the kitchen light. Her eyes flew open in
terror fully expecting to find someone had broken into her apartment and
was standing in the doorway to her room. Even more terrifying was to find
that indeed, there was no one there. Grabbing her coat she left, returning
several months later only to retrieve some belongings before the house
was to be sold.</B>
<BR><B>To date, some 10 years later, this house has been almost totally
remodeled, with two more apartments being added on. The new owners, speaking
very little English,&nbsp; have never been questioned on any mysterious
events.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Invisible Cat</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Gwa828@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;My apartment is haunted. I think I might have started this
haunting by trying to rescue a cat who was alone and frightened during
a thunderstorm.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I tried to coax him or her into my apartment -- even though
we aren't allowed to have pets. I figured I'd get him in from the storm,
and let him be a little more comfortable, and a little less frightened,
then let him out after the storm had passed.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Anyway, I couldn't get the poor thing to come into my apartment;
but shortly after this, strange things have happened on several occasions
to me.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I am on dialysis, and sometimes when I come home I am very
tired, and take a nap on my couch.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Sometimes, I feel the distinct sensation of two paws pressing
down on the edge of the cushions, then all fours jumping up, and walking
around me, looking for a place to settle down.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;The strange thing is there's no cat to be seen!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;My friend, Mike has felt him too. Mike swears up and down
it's the spirit of his cat, Khan, who died several years ago. It might
well be. The cat that I've seen was big, and white, with a gray patch on
the top of his head, and on the tips of his ears.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I will be moving some time next month, and I wish the cat
would come with me. I want to stress that at no time have I been frightened
by the presence of the invisible cat; but rather comforted. I'll even leave
the empty tuna cans on the floor in case he's hungry.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>THE LADY IN BROWN</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sueknauff@eriecoast.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>My husband and I were in charge of a cub scout den.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The two of us had recently visited an old museum in a town south of where
we live, and while we were admiring the historic articles inside, we decided
it would be a nice place to take the cub scouts.&nbsp; We are civil war
reenactors and love to look at bits and pieces of history.&nbsp; Inside
were many items of the civil war, etc.&nbsp; We wrote down the weekend
hours and headed home.</B>
<BR><B>A few weekends later, we arranged for all of the scouts to meet
at our home Saturday morning to go on a tour of the museum.&nbsp; My husband
took one car full of boys and I took the other.</B>
<BR><B>We arrived and parked our vehicles and went up to proceed inside.&nbsp;
The doors of the museum were locked.&nbsp; You could see inside the windows
on the door, and the lights were all out.&nbsp; I was so frustrated that
all of the mothers had brought the boys to our home and the place was locked
up.&nbsp; I checked our watches and noted the times on the door hadn't
changed.&nbsp; We were there 30 minutes past opening time.&nbsp; Yet no
one was around.</B>
<BR><B>Here I was with all of the scouts standing there in their uniforms...&nbsp;
I was determined to knock and bang on the door, until someone let us in.&nbsp;
I began knocking and yelling, "Hello?&nbsp; Hello!"&nbsp;&nbsp; No answer.&nbsp;
My husband and I turned away and saw a restaurant across the street.&nbsp;
He said he'd go over and ask them over there about the museum.&nbsp; He
came back and said they didn't know why they weren't open.&nbsp; They were
always open on the weekends.</B>
<BR><B>I turned back to peek inside the doorway once more and pressed my
face up to the glass.&nbsp; There, standing next to the front desk, was
a woman.&nbsp; She was looking at me rather apprehensively.&nbsp; Almost
shy like.&nbsp; I began to bang on the door, saying, "hello?&nbsp; Won't
you let us in?&nbsp; I have cub scouts here!"&nbsp; My husband said "who
are you talking to?"&nbsp; I said, "Right there!&nbsp; Can't you see that
woman?&nbsp; Why won't she answer me?"&nbsp; He peeked inside and said
he saw no one.&nbsp; I said, "Right there she is, by the desk!"&nbsp; I
said, "Hello!&nbsp; Could you please come to the door?"&nbsp; She only
stood there staring at me.&nbsp; She was dressed in a brown dress buttoned
up to her neck and her hair was black and pulled back in a bun.&nbsp; I
turned to my husband and said, "Well, for heavens sake!&nbsp; She won't
move.&nbsp; Why won't she answer me?"</B>
<BR><B>The scouts all looked in the glass and no one saw her.&nbsp; My
husband peeked in once more and said "There is no one in there.&nbsp; I'm
looking in and there is no one there!&nbsp; Come on, lets go."&nbsp;&nbsp;
We left and I have always wanted to return and ask them about the mysterious
woman in the brown dress.&nbsp; It only occurred to me later, that I had
seen a ghost.</B>

<P><B>The Little Girl</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: dardar-nursing99@home.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>One night just a couple of years back, I was asleep in my bed, my
oldest</B>
<BR><B>child was asleep beside me since she had woke up in the middle of
the</B>
<BR><B>night and wanted in my bed. Anyway, I was asleep but for whatever
reason</B>
<BR><B>sort of woke up and turned on my right side facing my daughter.
As I did</B>
<BR><B>this I opened my eyes just slightly since I was kind of awake. As
I did</B>
<BR><B>this I saw a dark shadowy figure of what appeared to be a girl wearing
a</B>
<BR><B>nightgown standing on the bed. I was half asleep and tapped my hand
on</B>
<BR><B>it assuming my daughter had woke up, and I said "come on honey lay</B>
<BR><B>down". As I did that my hand went through nothing but air. I opened
my</B>
<BR><B>eyes to see if maybe my daughter had gotten off the bed, but she
was</B>
<BR><B>sound asleep beside me on her back. But above her at her feet area</B>
<BR><B>standing on the bed was a image/outline of a girl wearing a long;
what I</B>
<BR><B>thought appeared to be a nightgown. No it wasn't my eyes playing
tricks,</B>
<BR><B>I had only a scarf valance on the top of my window and no blinds
or</B>
<BR><B>anything to darken the room, the room was quite illuminated at night</B>
<BR><B>from the outside light. I opened my eyes real wide and as I did
this the</B>
<BR><B>image just sort of...faded. I turned over placed my arm around my</B>
<BR><B>daughter, thinking "weird"; and went back to sleep. The next day
I woke</B>
<BR><B>up to my daughter rubbing my arm. The first thing she asked was
"mommy,</B>
<BR><B>who was that kid standing on the bed last night?"</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The Purest Evil</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: msbarebackrider@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I'm not sure my story will be much different than any other, but
I'd like to share. It's not my only experience with ghosts, but certainly
the most profound.</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I was 15, and my Mom had rented an old rock house at the edge of
town. My Dad was in Viet Nam, and it seemed that we were just getting by
til he returned. I'm not sure how long it was before I realized that there
was someone else in the house, but it wasn't long. It was more of a "knowing"
than anything else, and I'm not sure how I knew, but I was very sure. The
knowing was very intense and I began telling my Mom. She listened patiently,
but didn't say much. I told her that there was a man in the house, and
a little girl, and a woman. I told her that the man was the father of the
little girl, but the woman was not her mother. I felt that the woman was
more likely to be the Aunt of the man. The man was in his early thirties,
the little girl was about nine, and the woman was in her early fifties.
It struck me as very odd that I should have so much detail about something
I could not see. There was a basement in this house. Like most kids, I
wanted to explore all of the house. It was two stories with a half basement.
I was not physically able to go into the basement. The door worked just
fine and during the day, I tried again, and again. I just couldn't go down
there. I remember laying down on my stomach and looking into the bright
sunny basement. It wasn't like most basements. There were high windows
that let the sunlight in, and everything was painted white. I was surprised
at how clean and bright everything was. There were jars of food on the
shelves, lots of them. Just like someone had just finished canning. I stood
up and closed the door. There was more than food down there, and it wasn't
the three I came to refer to as "the family". We had our share of ghostly
things like stairs and doors creaking, lights turning on and off by themselves,
and things going bump in the night. Those things were minor and I didn't
pay much attention to them. There was one thing that was very irritating.
While I was taking my bath, "everytime", the creaking would begin. I can
only describe the sound as what an old wooden rocking chair might sound
like. Creaking forward and backwards, creak, creak... creak, creak. I would
try to ignore it, but it would really get on my nerves. I would yell very
loud, "knock it off!!" and it would stop.&nbsp; My bed room was upstairs
and there were two staircases. One front staircase, and a back staircase,
that was very near the door to the basement. The back staircase is the
one we used the most as it came down into a short hall that lead to the
kitchen. The back staircase is where I first encountered the Evil thing.
I was running up the stairs when I was stopped dead in my tracks. I couldn't
see anything, but the feeling was enough! I felt that what ever was there
was the purest form of evil I could ever imagine. There was such a pressure
in my chest that I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that if I went one more
step, I would surely die. I had to go back down and use the other stairs
to get to my room. I thought about this for a long time, and tried to tell
myself I was just being silly. The next time I met this thing, and I refer
to it that way because I never "knew" it to have form, I tried to take
the next step. I tried to calm myself, reason with myself, and take one
more step. I used my eyes, I could see nothing, I lifted my leg to take
the next step and felt like someone was beating my chest with a hammer.
I said it just wasn't worth it and went around again. What I mean by going
around is that I took another part of the house to get where I was going.
From that time on, I never tried to get past it. When I felt it in my path,
I just went around, or waited til it left.&nbsp; One night I was having
a lot of trouble with my bedroom light going on and off. I had just moved
into this bedroom, and it was the last one to try. There just wasn't any
peace in the others. I was still trying to be logical about everything
and chalked it up to old wireing. This bedroom was at the front of the
house and the bedroom door was at the top of the front staircase. There
was a light in the hallway just outside the bedroom door. One that hung
low and you could see it from the bedroom. I kept it on all night. It was
funny, that light stayed on, but my bedroom light wouldn't do much more
than flicker on and off. I gave up on the light, and went to bed. My bed
faced the open door, and the light was comforting. A few minutes later,
I knew someone was there. I opened my eyes to find the man standing in
the doorway. I sat up in bed stunned. This was the first time I'd actually
seen him. He looked just as I had known he would. He was tall enough to
block the light in the hallway. It was then that I realized that he was
solid. I couldn't speak, I was terrified. I just stared at him, long enough
to notice that he was wearing a black suit. It was of the era of the mid
to late 1800's. He was wearing a white shirt, a black gambler type tie,
and a black hat. I knew he wanted something, but I didn't know what. I
was so scared that I didn't care. I fell back against my pillows and covered
my head. I never saw him again. I knew I was supposed to do something,
but I never knew what. Several weeks later, I woke to noise in the kitchen.
This was different than the normal noises I had become used to. I listened
long enough to be sure that there was someone really down there. I ran
to wake up my Mom. I told here that there was someone in the kitchen. We
must have been a funny sight creeping down the stairs with a wooden coat
hanger as the only weapon we could find. When we got to the bottom of the
back stairs, we could see a strange man. An indian, with buckskin pants
and a breech cloth over them, and no shirt. His hair was long, just past
his sholders, and he had something in one hand. He turned and ran out the
east door of the kitchen, across the screened in porch and disappeared
into the night. I think we believed until the next morning that it had
been a real person in the house. The next morning my Mom pointed out a
little detail that I hadn't thought of the night before. We never used
that door. There was no door knob and the dead bolt had been painted shut
years before. I walked over to the door that we had seen the indian man
run out of. The deadbolt was still locked, there was still no doorknob,
and the door was still painted shut. When my Dad returned from Viet Nam,
he too experienced some of the same things. We moved shortly after my Dad
came back. I'm 46 now and I still worry about just what it was that I was
supposed to do. I can still see these people like it was yesterday. I tried
to find some history on the house, thinking I might discover what horrible
thing happened there. I was unsuccessful. What ever it was, it was unspeakably
evil.</B><B></B>
