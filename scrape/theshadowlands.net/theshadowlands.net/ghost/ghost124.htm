<font size=+2>Haunted House in Beverly
MA</font>
<p>By: tridee1@email.msn.com
<p>I lived in&nbsp; what I believe to be a haunted apartment for about
a year.&nbsp; I
<br>cannot disclose the exact location due to the fact that the apartment
is
<br>still rented to tenants.&nbsp; When I first moved in, everything seemed
normal
<br>until I began doing some small renovations.&nbsp; My husband Eric began
to pull
<br>up the carpet and we noticed odd gouges in the floorboards in what
would be
<br>our bedroom.&nbsp; At the time, we thought that maybe some previous
tenants had
<br>damaged the floor while moving their furniture, so we proceeded to
paint the
<br>floor and lay down an area rug.&nbsp; After two months or so, my husband
walked
<br>into the bedroom after taking a shower.&nbsp; I was on the bed reading
when
<br>suddenly Eric slipped on the area rug that covered the gouges.
<p>After assuring that he was O.K. and passing it off as having wet feet,
we
<br>turned in for the night.&nbsp; The next morning we noticed what appeared
to be
<br>stains seeping through the area rug.&nbsp; They appeared to be the
same pattern
<br>as the gouges.&nbsp; I picked up the carpet and noticed a slick substance
<br>sticking to the back of the carpet.&nbsp; After much arguing as to
what exactly
<br>the substance was we decided to just throw it away.&nbsp; We never
gave it a
<br>second thought.&nbsp; About three or four days later, I was in the
kitchen having
<br>a cup of coffee with my friend Alec when suddenly the room temperature
<br>dropped considerably.&nbsp; I asked him to make sure all the windows
were shut.
<br>As he walked into the living room, he glanced into my bedroom on the
right
<br>and noticed the curtains were blowing.&nbsp; He went in to make sure
the window
<br>was closed, which it was.&nbsp; About five minutes later we both heard
a loud
<br>bang coming from the bathroom, which was on the other side of the living
<br>room.
<p>It took Alec and I a good fifteen minutes to get the courage up to check
the
<br>bathroom.&nbsp; The first thing you see when entering the bathroom
is the tub.&nbsp; I
<br>opened the curtain and noticed four tiles on the back wall that appeared
to
<br>be pushed out.&nbsp; You have to understand the layout of my apartment
to fully
<br>understand our fright.&nbsp; The apartment was a third floor attic
in an old
<br>Victorian style house that was renovated into a small loft type apartment.
<br>When entering the apartment, you go up three flights of stairs, into
the
<br>doorway and up another two small sets of stairs into the living room.&nbsp;
To
<br>the right is the bathroom and little beyond that is a crawl space in
the
<br>wall that runs under the eaves of the house and behind the bathroom
and
<br>bathtub.
<p>Alec and I bickered about who was going to go into the crawl space.
<br>Needless to say, we waited until Eric came home about two hours later.&nbsp;
We
<br>told him what had happened and insisted that he go into the crawl space
to
<br>investigate.&nbsp; When he got to the space behind the bathtub he discovered
alot
<br>of debris which included old dark stained ropes and large J hooks.&nbsp;
I
<br>insisted that he just leave them alone and figured where the house
was so
<br>old, they must have been left behind during renovation or construction.&nbsp;
We
<br>had our landlord fix the tiles and continued with our daily lives even
<br>though I was permanently left with a feeling of unease.
<p>For about six or seven months nothing happened.&nbsp; On Christmas Eve
of 1975 we
<br>had our tree set up in front of the crawl space door which was approximately
<br>2' wide by 3 1/2' high.&nbsp; The door fell open, knocking over the
tree and
<br>smashing all of my Christmas ornaments.&nbsp; Eric jumped out of bed
and stopped
<br>suddenly.&nbsp; We both heard a strange sound coming from the living
room.&nbsp; It
<br>seemed to be coming from the crawlspace.&nbsp; At the same time I saw
a strange
<br>mist or fog hovering close to the ceiling in the living room.&nbsp;
It was very
<br>faint, almost like thin smoke.&nbsp; I pointed it out to Eric, but
it vanished
<br>before he could see it.&nbsp; I still can't believe how calm I stayed
throughout
<br>this whole episode.&nbsp; When Alec and his new wife Vanessa came by
on Christmas
<br>morning we told them the whole story.
<p>Vanessa was a very spiritual person and became instantly spooked before
we
<br>even told her the story.&nbsp; Alec commented on how strange she was
acting
<br>before she entered the apartment.&nbsp; She lost all the color in her
face and
<br>seemed aloof.&nbsp; She mentioned that something didn't feel right
about my
<br>apartment.&nbsp; I really started to feel like it was time to start
looking for a
<br>new place to live.
<p>Eric had to leave the following week for a business trip to California.&nbsp;
He
<br>would be gone for almost three months.&nbsp; I asked my girlfriend
Samantha to
<br>stay with me for awhile.&nbsp; I did not want to be alone.&nbsp; Samantha
knew what
<br>had been happening and agreed reluctantly to stay on the sofa in the
living
<br>room.&nbsp; The first month and a half was pretty much uneventful,
so Sam and I
<br>began to look at new apartments.&nbsp; I started feeling confident
that nothing
<br>was going to happen again.&nbsp; I was wrong.
<p>Samantha had to go back home for a few days so I was alone.&nbsp; I
had gone out
<br>with Alec and Vanessa on a Saturday night and came home at about 1:00
a.m.
<br>I climbed into bed with a book.&nbsp; I must have fallen asleep while
reading.
<br>(Did you ever get the feeling that someone is near you?)&nbsp; I woke
up on my
<br>stomach and I could sense someone walking around my bed.&nbsp; I laid
still and
<br>waited for it to pass.&nbsp; I heard the floorboards creaking and I
felt a cool
<br>breeze pass over me.&nbsp; I finally turned over and looked into the
living room
<br>and saw the mist moving towards the crawl space door.&nbsp; The absolute
fear
<br>that I felt paralyzed me.&nbsp; I could do nothing but stare and hope
that
<br>nothing bad would happen.&nbsp; The strange noises started again.&nbsp;
I can only
<br>describe the noise as a clang or knives being sharpened.
<p>I lost all of my composure.&nbsp; I ran out of my apartment wearing
only my
<br>nightshirt and grabbed my car keys on the way out the door.&nbsp; I
drove to
<br>Alec's and spent the night.&nbsp; I called Eric in LA and explained
what happened
<br>and that I would not go back until he came home.&nbsp; I paid the rent,
there was
<br>no way I was going to stay there alone.&nbsp; Eric came home on April
7th.&nbsp; I
<br>told him Alec and I would pick him up from the airport and then we
would go
<br>to the apartment and get our belongings.
<p>I will never forget what we saw when we went back.&nbsp; It&nbsp; made
me a true
<br>believer in the paranormal.&nbsp; I still don't know to this day what
was
<br>haunting that apartment, but I believe it was truly evil.&nbsp; We
walked into
<br>the apartment to discover the rug torn up, almost gouged in the living
room.
<br>All of the tiles in the bathtub enclosure were punched out into the
tub.
<br>The bedroom truly horrified the three of us. It appeared that something
<br>mauled the bed linens.&nbsp; The armoire mirror was smashed as well
as my lamps.
<br>We grabbed what we could salvage and started to leave when we noticed
the
<br>rope and J hook through the kitchen table.
<p>I don't know if a person came in and did all the damage, but nothing
<br>explains the J hook and the rope.&nbsp; My landlord insisted that no
one had
<br>access to the apartment since we had moved in.&nbsp; We left that day
and never
<br>looked back.&nbsp; I did some research on the house but found nothing
significant
<br>that would explain any of the occurrences while we had lived there.
<p>Eric and I now live in Vermont with our three kids.&nbsp; The house
was renovated
<br>and turned into a retail store.&nbsp; We have not told them the story
and I don't
<br>think we ever will.&nbsp; Not too many people know about this, but
I wanted to
<br>submit it to people who truly believe.

<br><font size=+2>Following Spirits</font>
<p>By: shadowfromnc@webtv.net
<p>&nbsp; I have a question for you,is it possibe for a ghost or spirit
to
<br>travel from dwelling to dwelling?&nbsp; When I was a teenager(38 now),
I
<br>became very interested in ghosts.&nbsp; I had a poltergist living with
me in
<br>my room.&nbsp; I named him Fred he did harmless things,drawers would
open
<br>during the night,my keys and wallet would be found some place other
than
<br>where I had left them.&nbsp; This went on for years and even some of
my
<br>visiting friends had some small encounters with Fred. I got married
and
<br>moved out of my parents house and had no other contact at all.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My wife,that I met here in North Carolina,were
talking one night
<br>about eight years ago,about ghost nd our beliefs.&nbsp; I told her
of the
<br>story of Fred and a few other things that I can't explain,and she told
<br>me of "polly" who she claims is the spirit of her dad.&nbsp; Polly
watches
<br>over Leisa and her house.&nbsp; I did believe what she had to say and
took it
<br>at that.&nbsp; We both lived in seperate apartments,in the same complex(two
<br>different buildings),after a few months or so we deciced to move in
<br>together Leisa,Tara(leisa's 12 yr old at the time) and myself.&nbsp;
Tara was
<br>also well aware of Polly and was quite accepted.&nbsp; I had no dealings
with
<br>Polly for at least two months and nobody else had either.&nbsp; One
day I
<br>came home from work and went to fix myself a drink,I went to the freezer
<br>and paced some ice in a glass(not a tumbler a regular 8oz glass) I
left
<br>the glass on the kitchen bar and went to the living room to the liquor
<br>cabinet.&nbsp; I was returning to the kitchen when the ice cubes just
jumped
<br>out of the glass and bounced all along the counter,never falling to
the
<br>floor,this is a breakfast bar all of 24inches wide.&nbsp; I went and
got the
<br>telephone and called my wife she said it was Polly letting me know
she
<br>was there,as we spoke ad I greed with her the ice cubes slowly stopped
<br>moving.&nbsp; I said goodbye to my wife and decided to let Polly know
I was
<br>no threat to her,Leisa or Tara.&nbsp; I went about making my drink(
a good
<br>one by now)as was totally amazed that fr all the time the ice was on
the
<br>counter the counter was absolutley dry,free of any moisture.&nbsp;
I have
<br>since had other events and this leads to my question as a family we
have
<br>moved since that apartment to two other apartments and now into the
<br>house we have been here two and a half years.&nbsp; I always ,to no
one elses
<br>knowledge, invited Polly to come along and every place we have gone
she
<br>is there,it takes a while for her to adjust I guess because it is
<br>usually months after the move,though she will show her presence to
both
<br>my wife and I at differnt times and ways we both know she is here.
<br>I have read that some animales can pick things out that we can"t see.&nbsp;
I
<br>have two black labs (male 120lbs Shadow) (female 65lbs Sadie) both
are
<br>extremely alert dgs the male was trained for protection the female
is my
<br>wife's pet and is as sweet as a dog could be,however she can stand
in
<br>the hose could be any room and all of a sudden she gets up stares drops
<br>her tail between her legs pins her ears and hides.&nbsp; I have witnessed
<br>this aswellas my wife on many many occasions bth in andoutside the
<br>house(back yard only).&nbsp; I know she is seeing something but my
male
<br>does'nt move.&nbsp; The male could be laying next to her and never
even open
<br>his eyes.&nbsp; This has happened while both are awake as well.&nbsp;
I know it is
<br>not a medicial problem as they are taken care off better than I do
<br>myself they are are family as our daughter is now 20 years old,besides
<br>that it is the male with the epilepsy.

<br><font size=+2>My apparent encounter with the supernatural</font>
<p>By: alvrom@bellatlantic.net
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>May I relate an incident that happened to me in the late
<br>1960's? It would be interesting to know if it has any typical
<br>features or fits a standard pattern. Since I had been drinking
<br>earlier in the evening of the night in question, I've often won-
<br>dered if the whole thing wasn't the product of inebriated
<br>imagination, and that the comments of my friend which
<br>seemed to confirm the supernatural origin of the experience
<br>merely a gentle teasing.
<p>I lived and worked in Nashville for 6 years in the mid to late
<br>'60s. Among my business associates was Camilla Caldwell,
<br>director of the Metropolitan Welfare Commission, the city's
<br>general assistance program for the poor. She and her hus-
<br>band Nat, himself a Pulizer prize winning investigative re-
<br>porter for the Nashville Tennesseean, owned a home on
<br>a hill overlooking Gallatin Lake: Pilot Knob House. The
<br>oldest part of the home (at that time Camilla's kitchen),
<br>had, if I remember correctly, been built in the 1830s or 40s,
<br>originally a one room log cabin. The bulk of the home was
<br>built just before the Civil War and consisted of a large two
<br>storey building with stereotypical neoclassical columns
<br>at the front door, large livingroom and diningroom, suites
<br>of bedrooms upstairs, large sweeping staircase curving
<br>back on itself. The scene fairly begged for Scarlet O'Hara.
<br>There was an addition (single storey?) off the lvingroom ,
<br>where the master bedroom had been placed. I bellieve
<br>Nat told me that the addition had been built in the '20s
<br>when the bandleader Paul Whiteman owned the place.
<p>I was a young social worker recently separated from my
<br>wife and eagerly accepted Camilla's invitation to spend a
<br>weekend at Pilot Knob House with her and Nat. The couple
<br>frequently had young people out as guests, some of whom
<br>I knew professionally.
<p>Nat, Camilla, and I had a pleasant dinner in the kitchen and
<br>spent the evening in the parlor in conversation. Nat and I
<br>drank heavily of whiskey, I remember. When I retired I
<br>went to the Red Suite, one of two complete bedroom/
<br>sittingroom/bathroom suites on either side of the stairway
<br>and dividing hallway on the second floor.
<p>I went to my bed leaving lights on, since it has always been
<br>my custom to read something at bedtime. Usually I get
<br>drowsy to the point when the sentences no longer make
<br>sense,&nbsp; then turn out the light with the last remnants of
<br>vitality and fall quickly off to sleep. This night, in new
<br>surroundings, I fell asleep with the book on my chest,
<br>lights still on.
<p>Some time later, still lying supine with the book on my chest
<br>or abdomen, I awoke in the lighted room, and as I came
<br>awake I had the most definite feeling that someone was
<br>outside the door in the hallway. I recall being more or less
<br>sober at this point.
<p>Upon perceiving that someone was standing in the hall at
<br>my door, I had the gut level feeling that the "someone" was
<br>passing through the door and into the room, passing along
<br>the side of my bed, and standing in the center of the room
<br>looking at me. There was no sense of&nbsp; malevolent presence, rather
<br>only the feeling that I was being watched, inspected,
<br>even. There was no visual or auditory presence whatever,
<br>yet I "knew,"&nbsp; emphatically, that someone was there in
<br>front of my bed. And though the emotion may have been
<br>mixed with fear, I recall that my predominant reaction was
<br>one of anger at the intrusion. How dare you!!!&nbsp; And I told
<br>the presence in unambiguous terms to go away and leave
<br>me alone! Now!!!
<p>Whereupon, I perceived, that It, whatever It was, made its
<br>retreat out of the room through the door, and proceeded down the stairs,
<br>and then out of my having any sense of where it was. Just gone.
<p>I don't recall when I fell asleep again, but I did have a defin-
<br>ite feeling that as a result of my scolding I needn't worry
<br>about Its coming back. (It never did on any of several
<br>subsequent visits).
<p>The following morning at breakfast I started to tell Camilla
<br>about my experience, and as I recall she interrupted me
<br>to tell be that I'd been visited by "The Ghost."&nbsp; I seem to
<br>remember that she confirmed aspects of the visitation that
<br>I had not told her, but after all these years I cannot recall
<br>which.&nbsp; I've told this story so many times to friends that
<br>I even doubt the parts of the story that I seem to clearly
<br>recall, half expecting that in the repetition I've burned the
<br>now formalized story into my long term memory,&nbsp; so that
<br>a partially fictionalized account is now remembered
<br>in its entirety as truth. Perhaps in the early retellings I
<br>unconsciously embroidered the account of a much
<br>simpler episode, and have told the tale so often that it
<br>is the embroidered version I rember as my "factual
<br>account" of an unusual experience at Pilot Knob House.
<br>Something did happen, roughly along the lines I have
<br>sketched here, but the years have taken their toll. Since
<br>I made no notes, I can only conjecture as to the accuracy
<br>of my story in its present form.
<p>Camilla related the story of a young women living in the
<br>house at the time of the Civil War, whose fiance went
<br>off to war. During the course of the war or just after, she
<br>received a letter from her sweetheart telling her he had
<br>decided to break the engagement, that he had met a
<br>woman in Atlanta during the war, and that he was going
<br>to marry his new love and settle in Atlanta. She then
<br>committed suicide by throwing herself in a well on the
<br>property, and it is the spirit of the troubled young lady
<br>who haunts Pilot Knob. (I do not recalling asking to see
<br>the well.)
<p>Thanks for the opportunity to raise a few questions that
<br>have bounced around in my head for some time. If any
<br>of this fits known patterns of ghostly or other encounters,
<br>I would appreciate hearing from you. I imagine Camilla and
<br>Nat are in their graves by now, as they were in their mid
<br>60s thirty years ago.

<p><font size=+2>John Is that you?</font>
<p>By: Lucky7131@aol.com
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I had a good friend, John that was diagnosed with a terminal illness.&nbsp;
We
<br>were very close like brother and sister for many years.&nbsp; Both
he and his
<br>sister were adopted as newborn babies.&nbsp;&nbsp; We leaned on each
other through
<br>life's good times and bad.&nbsp;&nbsp; When i found out that he was
ill and going to
<br>die we spent much time discussing that and many other things.&nbsp;
My life was
<br>very busy at the time as i was a new mother and we made most of our
<br>communications by phone.&nbsp; We both also were avoiding&nbsp; seeing
each other.&nbsp; He
<br>had lost a lot of weight and looked real bad.&nbsp; He did want me
to see him like
<br>that.&nbsp; I on the other hand was afraid to see him, afraid to face
his
<br>inevitable death.&nbsp; So we carried on by phone to our mutual satisfaction.&nbsp;
I
<br>asked him how long he had and he said maybe a year or so at best.&nbsp;
He called
<br>me everyday 2 or 3 times just to talk.&nbsp; He did manage to make
one last trip
<br>out of state and even managed to call me everyday then.&nbsp; He used
to tell me
<br>his hope and fears and would even thow in an occasional joke about
his
<br>impending demise.&nbsp; One day we got into a discussion about the
other side and
<br>he jokingly told me that he guessed "he would be the first one to find
out".
<br>I told him that if there was any way to let me know if there was "another
<br>side" to let me know.&nbsp; We didn't agree on anything specific but
told him to
<br>just let me know.&nbsp; He said if he could he would.&nbsp; I also
told him not to be
<br>making any appearences to me because he would scare the heck out of
me.&nbsp; As
<br>you would expect time marched on and one day he called and told me
about this
<br>dream he had the night before.&nbsp; He said he was sleeping and he
was dreaming
<br>that there were tiny cherbus like angels floating around his head.&nbsp;
He said
<br>he woke up and looked at the clock and it was midnight.&nbsp; He went
back to
<br>sleep and began another dream that his grandfather was there with him.&nbsp;
He
<br>awoke and looked at the clock and it was one am on the dot.&nbsp; This
continued a
<br>few more times and each time he would wake up on the hour.&nbsp; The
revelation of
<br>his dream was frightning to me because all of the people he spoke of
were
<br>deceased.&nbsp; He had a twin brother that died at the age of 3 months
and i
<br>related that to the tiny angels.&nbsp; His grandfather had died at
a ripe old age
<br>a few years before.&nbsp; I was pushing the thought out of my mind
that his time
<br>was coming near and his loved ones were there to comfort him.&nbsp;
It had only
<br>been about 5 months since i found out he was ill, he couldn't be going
so
<br>soon I thought.&nbsp; A few more months passed and the calls went on
as usual.&nbsp; In
<br>October I got a call from him on a Monday and the first thing he said
was
<br>guess where I am.&nbsp; I said the hospital.&nbsp; He told me I was
right and then we
<br>talked.&nbsp; I talked to him thoughout the week sent him a card and
picture of my
<br>son and then I got a call from him on Thursday.&nbsp; We had a long
conversation
<br>about our friendship over the years how unlikley it was that it lasted
so
<br>long, how we met, our families, our friends, funny stunts we pulled
like dine
<br>and dash and after the conversation was over and I thought about it
I knew he
<br>was saying goodbye.&nbsp; I felt a rush of anxiousness.&nbsp; My mind
was spinning I
<br>was think no not yet I'm not ready for this he can't go yet.&nbsp;
I felt alarmed
<br>and uneasy.&nbsp; I went to a gift shop and picked out and angel for
him.&nbsp; I gave
<br>it to my husband the next day to give to my friend's father (my husband
<br>worked with his father) to take to he hospital.&nbsp; The next day
I called him at
<br>the hospital and I got a prerecorded message that said this patient
did not
<br>want any phone calls at this time.&nbsp; My heart was sinking and so
was my
<br>stomach.&nbsp; I continued to try to call all day and kept getting
the same
<br>message.
<br>While I was trying to call my friend was dying.&nbsp; It was October
14th.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
<br>next day his father called and gave me news i so dreaded.&nbsp; The
next day I was
<br>at home alone in the house and i just felt his presence very stong.&nbsp;
I was in
<br>the kitchen and I went to walk by bedroom and I saw a presence standing
<br>there.&nbsp; I was so shocked that i actually jumped back and drew
a quick deep
<br>breath.&nbsp; I started shaking and I yelled out in fear "John if that
is you stop
<br>doing that because&nbsp; you are scaring me".&nbsp; After that I felt
calm and the erie
<br>presence was gone.&nbsp; I attended his memorial service and life was
moving on.
<br>My husband went to help his father clean out his apartment.&nbsp; My
husband made
<br>a funny observation.&nbsp; He said that when they were done there was
just a small
<br>pile of things left but he said it was all the things my friend and
I shared
<br>and enjoyed.&nbsp; My husband said it was like that little pile of
stuff was left
<br>for me.&nbsp; I asked my hudband what happened to it and he said he
didn't know
<br>but that he did not want to ask for it and i understood.&nbsp; We were
given his
<br>watch and infamous sunglasses and that was good enough for me.&nbsp;
A week later
<br>I was sleeping and the phone rang.&nbsp; I got out of bed wondering
who would be
<br>calling that early(6:00 am) and if anything was wrong.&nbsp; I answered
the phone
<br>and much to my surprise it was my friend's father Frank.&nbsp; He said
what's
<br>wrong honey?&nbsp; And I said what are you talking about?&nbsp; He
said you just paged
<br>me.&nbsp; I said no I didn't I was sleeping.&nbsp; We had some discussion
back and
<br>forth about the call he asked me if my husband paged him and i said
no he was
<br>still in bed sleeping too.&nbsp; We were perplexed and finally agreed
that it was
<br>John sending us a message and that gave us some comfort and we laughed.&nbsp;
The
<br>funny thing was that it was Halloween morning.&nbsp; Time marched on
and I got
<br>back to my regular life and i kept in touch with my friend John's parents.
<br>One thing that always bothered me was that we never got to see each
other to
<br>say goodbye. A year or two later I called his mother to wish her a
Merry
<br>Christmas and we got to taking about John&nbsp; and i told her that
I had a dream
<br>about him about seven months ago.&nbsp; I told her that I dreamed that
we were in
<br>this big white house on a hill and this house was just illuminated
in white,
<br>everything there was perfect and clean and as white as white could
be.
<br>Outside sun was shining everywhere brightly and i was sitting down
talking to
<br>John there were green trees leaves rustling ever so gently and there
was just
<br>this very very calm peaceful feeling.&nbsp; I was crying that i was
sorry i never
<br>got to see him before he died and he was comforting me.&nbsp; He looking
so
<br>healthy and vibrant and happy.&nbsp; He kept telling me that he was
very happy and
<br>that he was o.k.&nbsp; He told me he was very happy and at peace in
the white
<br>house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I woke up i was actually crying.&nbsp;
His mother was taken back by
<br>this a bit.&nbsp; She told me that when he was a little boy she was
trying to
<br>explain to him about being adopted.&nbsp; Before she could finish her
explanation
<br>he told her Mommy I know where I came from.&nbsp; I came from the big
white house
<br>on the hill.&nbsp; That abouts ends my events surrounding my friend
John.&nbsp; He has
<br>been dead almost 6 years and i do miss him.&nbsp; I like to think that
he is
<br>around here and there.&nbsp; A few years ago i was heart broken to
find the
<br>diamond in my engagement ring gone.&nbsp; About a month later i found
it perfectly
<br>placed for me to find after it was missing for over a month.&nbsp;
I really feel
<br>John was progressive in life and is so in death.&nbsp; He never stayed
in one
<br>place long when he was alive and i wouldn't expect him to do so now.&nbsp;
But, as
<br>he was in life he is always there when you need him.

<br><font size=+2>Perceptive to the Paranormal</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>By: Amanda D.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>My story is actually a few experiences I've had I don't know if I'm
<br>perceptive to paranormal activity or not however I do believe some
people
<br>attract strange phenomenon. The earliest incident that I can remember
<br>happened to me when I was about 6 or 7 we moved to a new state and
strange
<br>things began to happen. One of which happened every night at about
8:30 a
<br>strange puff of white would pop up at the end of my bed then slowly
make its
<br>way down the right edge of my bed about half way down it would stop
then wait
<br>about a few seconds then go back down to the edge of my bed and disappear.
I
<br>must admit that at this time my family had a little and puffy haired
poodle,
<br>however I ruled him out because of three things. One our dog was VERY
short
<br>and wouldn't be able to reach the edge of my bed, two he was very old
and his
<br>fur had taken on a yellowish tint and the puff I saw reflected the
light from
<br>the hallway and was pure white, thirdly I watched my doorway until
8:30 when
<br>it would appear and nothing would go in or come out. The next thing
to happen
<br>to me scared me beyond belief. I had I tree in my backyard that I would
spend
<br>A LOT of my free time in even at night. One night I was in the tree
when I
<br>felt something watching me when I looked around at first I saw nothing
then I
<br>saw near my fence two little red glowing dots. I totally freaked and
ran into
<br>my house. Fortunately for me we were only renting that house until
we found a
<br>permanent home (where I reside now). The next experience I can remember
<br>happened years later after we moved. I was at my friend's house when
my
<br>parents and her parents went out to dinner. I was about 13 now and
we decided
<br>to go up on the roof and watch the stars. We (me, my friend and her
little
<br>brother) started up I climbed up first. I climbed up the tree and sat
on the
<br>roof. Then I said something (I don't remember what) that made my friend
<br>really mad so she went inside. Her little brother stayed out with me.
As he
<br>headed up I heard something behind me I turned to see three people
headed
<br>towards me. At first I thought they were intruders coming to attack
me. I
<br>jumped up to prepare to run when I noticed that I could see the stars
though
<br>their bodies. I froze and they stopped. I shouted down to my friends
brother
<br>what was going on and I told him to get his sister. She told him she
didn't
<br>believe me but I was stuck I couldn't get down and needed help. Apparently
<br>she heard voices inside the house which clinched it and she came for
me.
<br>However in the mean time Ii decided to make a jump for the closest
branch. I
<br>made it down and we all ran into the house. She has told me that other
<br>strange things have happened there too. The last incident I'll share
happened
<br>about a year or two ago. Earlier I had a friend who had the exact same
<br>birthday (and time) as me. We were good friends but her dad kinda creeped
me
<br>out he wasn't mean as a matter of fact I hardly ever saw him. He just
gave me
<br>chills when I did see him. Her family eventually moved to a different
state.
<br>A while after she moved I had a dream with her in it she didn't do
anything
<br>just stood there. I didn't give it any further thought. Until I saw
on t.v. a
<br>few years later that a man had murdered his wife and hidden the body.
The man
<br>was my friends father and the murder took place around the same week
that I
<br>saw her in my dream. I have had a few other strange things happen but
not
<br>many fortunately those are the biggest. I haven't had many sightings
for
<br>quite some time and I'm enjoying the silence . Sorry for this being
so
<br>long. Thanx for listining.

<p><font size=+2>Something in my Sisters House</font>
<p>By: ireland@byelectric.com
<p>I have a sister who lives in New Jersey and i have visited her many
times in the past and always felt like
<br>there was something strange in her house. However, in the past two
years or so, after her father-in-law died, i have
<br>experienced some strange things. My sister`s father-in-law ,&nbsp;
who lived in the house with her and my brother-in-law for
<br>many years, passed away in 1997. I flew out there to visit for a week
and during the daytime, no one was in the house
<br>except me. One afternoon, i was sitting in a chair watching TV, and
i heard footsteps behind me and felt a rush of air
<br>brush against the back of my neck as if someone was walking up to me
, i thought my nephew was home, and turned around to
<br>greet him but no one was there! when i am downstairs in that house
i hear doors slam upstairs and footsteps walking around,
<br>&nbsp;i always think someone is home, but whenever i check, there isn`t
anyone in the house but me. I smoke, and my sister`s
<br>family doesn`t , so when i need to have a cigarette, i go out to the
garage through a door by the bar and on a few occasions,
<br>&nbsp;after having my smoke, i will try to come back in through that
door and it will be locked, so i have to enter through the
<br>front door outside and i know for a fact that the door is not locked
when i go to the garage.......wierd...........I have
<br>also heard voices in that house. just a couple weeks ago i was visiting
and someone called me by my name. It was a female
<br>voice i was not familiar with. i have told my sister about these wierd
occurences and she laughs and says she hears things,
<br>&nbsp;too. she told me the street behind her house was once an indian
trail in the old days. please note that these happenings
<br>are never frightening, just perplexing to say the least.

<p>at my elementary school in MI, There were stories about a janitor
<br>acidently being barried in under it. we ca;;ed him Mr. Central. For
the
<br>longest time I wouldn't believe it. Until our teacher made us sleep
over at
<br>school. At about midnight I had to go to the restroom,that's where
I really
<br>got freaked! When I frist went into the rest room it felt like the
temp.
<br>dropped about 60 degrees,then I herd a scream,a terrifying scream.This
is
<br>what bassicly made me piss my pants. The mirror got fogged up and a
giant
<br>hand print was in the miror . When I was running back to my sleepingbag,
the
<br>janitors door was&nbsp; moving,then I herd footsteps behind me. but
there was
<br>nobody there. I had only told a few people about my story. Some believed
<br>me,some didn't. This is entierly true.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Happy

<br><font size=+2>I See Them!</font>
<p>By: yeh@blackstone.com
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The story I wish to tell begins in New York, but I will begin with some
<br>earlier background about myself and possible pertinent information
for the
<br>events that which occured later.
<br>I am a firm believer of ghosts having seen my first apparition at my
home in
<br>New Jersey (faceless/bodiless figure floating parallel to my bed wearing
a
<br>white tophat, white monacle and white gloves).&nbsp; Prior to this
experience as
<br>a child I remember talking to the wind and asking it to ring the doorbell
<br>(which it would); laying pillows and blankets and all sorts of stuffed
<br>animals next to me in bed so I wouldn't wake up next to anything; feeling
<br>something tickle my feet before I slept every night...and throughout
my life
<br>being plagued with ghosts/hauntings/unseen entities/demons (later in
life)
<p>I moved to New York City for college and was fortunate to get a 5th
Avenue
<br>address in the heart of Greenwich Village.&nbsp; I lived in a landmark
building
<br>(once the Fifth Avenue Hotel) blocks away from Washington Sq Park.&nbsp;
The bad
<br>dreams did not follow me to New York, besides byt his point I was able
to
<br>control lucid dreaming so everything was under control.
<br>Stories about weird occurences amused me my first year.&nbsp; Many
students had
<br>died, and I'm certain many people had died here as well.&nbsp; During
my first
<br>week there was a strange occurence.&nbsp; On the 10th Floor a student
found his
<br>roommate above him trying to strangle him in the middle of the night.&nbsp;
This
<br>was strange since later on I was to hear people tell me about the strange
<br>strangulation dreams they've had and even an account of a girl waking
up in
<br>the middle of the night to find the cord to her venetian blinds wrapped
<br>around her neck.&nbsp; Anyhow, I passed all of this off as nothing.
<br>The semester wore on.&nbsp; I had the "nods" in film class...perhaps
due to
<br>fatigue...my windowless film classroom was located in a building close
to
<br>the Triangle Fires and was a garment factory at one point.&nbsp; I
woke with a
<br>start in the middle of the film to see my friend sitting on the stairs
near
<br>the front of the lecture room.&nbsp; Oddly he wasn't watching the movie...he
was
<br>staring at me with a cheshire cat (Alice in Wonderland) grin.&nbsp;
I assumed
<br>that he knew someone else inthe class, but he wasn't facing the screen.&nbsp;
I
<br>turned to the my immediate right and left to find my friends focused
on the
<br>movie and looked to my friend again whose expression had not changed.&nbsp;
The
<br>grin is almost eerie, but did not scare me.&nbsp; Then, I stared at
his
<br>pants...they were coveralls...this struck me as odd...no one wears
coveralls
<br>even if this is NYC.&nbsp; I focused on the cuffs of his pants and
how they were
<br>so white...then something clicked in my head and I realized that I
was
<br>looking at a ghost.&nbsp; I turned to my female friend and grabbed
her arm...I
<br>looked back at the spirit in coveralls and it was gone.&nbsp; I began
to get
<br>excited, but my friend begged me to keep quiet until intermission.&nbsp;
No one
<br>else had seen anyone sitting on the stairs.&nbsp; I told the story
to my
<br>friends...they were in disbelief.&nbsp; I cast the event aside.&nbsp;
The year wore
<br>on.&nbsp; At one point due to parties and noise my group of friends
and I were
<br>sent to live in separate dorms.&nbsp; As punishment I was given a double
room
<br>with a fireplace on the south side of Washington Sq Park in what was
the
<br>dorm connected to Judson Church.&nbsp; The dorm was not popular due
to shared
<br>bathrooms, but it was odd to be given such a large room for myself.&nbsp;
I was
<br>so scared of the room, I never spent longer than 1 hour there.&nbsp;
It ended up
<br>being a storage place for my belongings.&nbsp; By the summer the dorm
was
<br>permanently closed, which was strange due to the many petitions to
keep it
<br>open and the housing shortage the university was facing.&nbsp; Anyhow...someone
<br>mentioned that it was due to ghosts...it wouldn't surprise me since
the park
<br>was a mass burial ground when typhoid hit NY and the "hanging tree"
of
<br>centuries ago stood nearby.
<br>These events did not phase me as I entered my 2nd year.
<br>Sophomore year - During winter recess, a close friend decided to move
in
<br>with her boyfriend and I was in between roommates.&nbsp; Few people
spent
<br>holidays in the city, but Mark and I were some of the few.&nbsp; Mark
(a close
<br>friend of mine) and I had shared ghost stories of the past.&nbsp; It
happens that
<br>as a child he had lived in a haunted house...with skeletal figures
rattling
<br>game boxes, ooze from the walls, cold spots, noises, scratching at
the
<br>walls, and a figure of a man in a tophat with a cane standing in his
living
<br>room.&nbsp; He grew up in LI, but I was certain that we may have seen
the same
<br>apparition for it appeared faceless to us both.
<p>Anyhow.&nbsp; One nights after our long walk through Soho and Gramercy...we
<br>returned to my room (onthe 14th fl) to find a mutual friend who was
excited
<br>about a Ouija board she had made out of cardboard (a skill she had
learned
<br>in high school).&nbsp; She invited us downstairs to join in.&nbsp;
I myself have
<br>"played" with them as a party game, but at this point I had no interest
not
<br>to mention I've heard many urban tales about circumstances gone wrong.&nbsp;
Marc
<br>left to join them and I remained alone until another friend Forest
<br>arrived...my hall light flashed 7-8 times went out and came on again.&nbsp;
It
<br>repeated this pattern 3 times as my friend Forest and I were talking.&nbsp;
We
<br>joked about ghosts and he too left for the "Ouija Board Party" on the
5th
<br>floor.&nbsp; I laughed to myself remembering all of those room
<br>haunting/possession nightmares...
<br>The next day I wasn't laughing anymore.&nbsp; My friends overwhelmed
me one by
<br>one with these outrageous tales.&nbsp; They must have been drinking,
but no.
<br>Apparently, they were fooling around with the board which of course
spelled
<br>out it was the devil...spelled out the initials of the person each
of them
<br>was in love with...convinced them to go to room 903 and try to break
in to
<br>free the spirit and the other spirits living in there.&nbsp; Told them
to turn
<br>the tv onto static where a 903 formed onscreen.&nbsp; Told them to
plug the tv
<br>into the hallway electric socket and place a glass of water with sugar
above
<br>the tv.&nbsp; A heart formed in the sediments and hardened in that
pattern.&nbsp; This
<br>was their proof to me.&nbsp; I didn't know what to believe, but the
girl Jean was
<br>fairly scared.&nbsp; These are not your witch/spiritual/occult types.&nbsp;
I didn't
<br>know what to think.&nbsp; Apparently they made many trips up to the
room at the
<br>urging of the board to break in with a hammer, etc.&nbsp; During one
of their
<br>trips they had left my friend Forest who had passed out in the room
with a
<br>board that they had not "said goodbye".&nbsp; I mention this only because
of all
<br>the horror movies I've seen in the past (as a pre-teen commercials
for
<br>Poltergeist had me cover the tv).
<br>This was all too weird.&nbsp; The light in the hallways started messing
with me.
<br>Changing the bulbs, getting an electrician in, prankers were all ruled
out.
<br>The main switch for all the lights cannot turn off one set of lights
in a
<br>room.&nbsp; Flashing in that same pattern as if it were signalling
me.&nbsp; I warned
<br>my new roommate (a med student) about this phenomenon...she didn't
listen
<br>and turned on the light.&nbsp; She was pale as a ghost as I emerged
from the
<br>bathroom "I doubted it and it signalled."&nbsp; Every night it had
gotten
<br>worse..I would come home at 3-4 am and she'd wake up or wouldn't be
asleep
<br>and tell me that something was touching her or she heard voices...I
thought
<br>she was acting strange from this wild look in her eyes (but let me
remind
<br>you that she was a disbeliever)...I put an angel and a gargoyle statue
near
<br>the window when I noticed this shadow on the other side of the venetial
<br>blinds covering the 6 foot courtyard window.&nbsp; I would check the
courtyard
<br>and there would be no lights.&nbsp; There was no moonlight/streetlight
or
<br>anything from this angle...The light never scared me (the hall light
that
<br>would not be turned on) the figure who's shoulders and head filled
the 6 ft
<br>wide window gave me the chills.
<br>903 was the haunted empty room which I'd mentionned previously.&nbsp;
The room
<br>has not been touched since the 1960's when the university had purchased
the
<br>building from each of its tenants.&nbsp; The man in 903 refused to
sell, died in
<br>the 70's and left the apt to his children who had mysteriously disappeared.
<br>There are magazines from 1960 on his coffeetable.&nbsp; Once every
year a
<br>cleaning crew goes into clean, but others stay clear of it.&nbsp; The
front desk
<br>men, security guards and cleaning staff all mentioned strange feelings
they
<br>get when in that room.&nbsp; 903 is where the Ouija board said all
the spirits
<br>were living and evidently the spirits of the deceased and some darker
things
<br>that "wished not to be seen".&nbsp; 903 was below the room 1003 where
that guy
<br>tried to strangle his roommate during my freshman year.
<br>Well, I took this hysterical girl (I think she had felt a presence
in her
<br>bedroom where they had been using the board) to a psychic I had visited
<br>once...(what else was I supposed to do).&nbsp; The psychic was upset
that they
<br>were fooling around with Ouija Boards.&nbsp; A friend who was very
much into the
<br>occult who was unpresent that evening and disapproved of the events
told me
<br>to stay away from the group of people involved because since I was
sensitive
<br>it would follow me.&nbsp; I didn't heed his warning.&nbsp; My friend
Forest's behavior
<br>odd (he seemed to make very little sense), so I stayed away from him.
<br>The psychic did not charge for advice but told that everyone who had
touched
<br>the board must be present to get rid of it...and something that I don't
<br>remember clearly about crossing the street diagonally then straight
to throw
<br>it away.&nbsp; So I suggested the garbage receptable in front of the
Church.
<br>They wanted to play one last time...I was hesitant.&nbsp; One last
time we played
<br>in the stairwell on the 5th floor.&nbsp; My friend Marc and I waited
in my
<br>bedroom to be called by the others downstairs.&nbsp; Mark joked about
turning on
<br>the light and did so against my wishes.&nbsp; The light went on flickered
6-7
<br>times went out and repeated the pattern.&nbsp; For some strange reason
I said
<br>"It's time." which really scared my friend, but anyhow...It flashed
and I
<br>immediately called downstairs to check and see if they pulled the board
out
<br>(out of curiosity).&nbsp; They did.
<br>I told them later that the ghost in my room had signalled me.
<br>Once downstairs I refused to touch the board/participate.&nbsp; A girl
"contacted
<br>her grandmother" and became quite emotional; a male friend fell into
a
<br>trance and had a private conversation with something which almost sounded
<br>sexual...he was to meet this spirit on a rooftop on the night of a
full moon
<br>or something of that sort.&nbsp; Everytime I would tell my friends
to ask the
<br>board something it would respond to my questions.&nbsp; Then the board
called
<br>me/spelled out my initials...I thought they were pushing it toward
my
<br>initial out of spite.&nbsp; I reluctantly agreed.&nbsp; So It was Chris
and I on the
<br>board...it was amazing how quickly the pointer (a glass ashtray upside
down)
<br>moved across the cardboard.&nbsp; You can tell when someone is pushing
because
<br>there is a certain pressure...there was a light airy gliding feeling
and I
<br>know that Chris wouldn't push the pointer.&nbsp; And we asked it some
questions.
<br>The ghost in the room was a female it said...yes it was the girl who
<br>committed suicide by jumping out the window and yes she would stop
scaring
<br>my roommate.&nbsp; Everyone was at ease.&nbsp; We signed out and threw
the board away.
<br>The shadow still appeared in the window.&nbsp; My roommate blamed the
wind for
<br>breaking the gargoyle statue I had placed facing outward onthe window
sill.
<br>I had heard a voice returning home late one night...I know it was not
my
<br>roommate because I saw her face while I entered.&nbsp; A sweet femal
voice said
<br>to me (almost telepathically)&nbsp; "Hi, I didn't think you were coming
home
<br>tonight."&nbsp; My roommate lay fast asleep...the bathroom light shining
on her
<br>still face.&nbsp; I turned onthe lamp near my bed and my&nbsp; roommate
woke.&nbsp; I had
<br>asked her if she was just talking to me.&nbsp; She said no.&nbsp; I
did not pursue any
<br>further since I still wanted to go to sleep.
<br>The next day I told her.&nbsp; As I had aforementionned, my roommate
was more
<br>scared than I for weeks...but eventually she befriended what lived
in that
<br>dorm room with us.&nbsp; It would put the toilet seat down and up for
her and her
<br>boyfriend.&nbsp; Not much happened with the others after that incident,
except
<br>they made a new board months later.
<br>When I moved out...I packed the last of my stuff and dared to turn
on the
<br>hallway light.&nbsp; It was daytime.&nbsp; The light flashed as I'd
expected and I
<br>said aloud, "Well, I'm moving.&nbsp; I'll see you later."&nbsp; Then,
I left.
<p>I moved into an apartment.&nbsp; Now, you meet many weird people in
the dorms.
<br>Many who had similar experiences in the dorms or in another of the
<br>university's dorms (because I have heard voices in the dorm on 10th
street
<br>and with a room full of 8 witnesses wide awake heard the mini refrigerator,
<br>which has a door that sticks, door open and saw no one only to find
the door
<br>wide open the next day.)&nbsp; I had this girl whose mother was a Santarian
High
<br>Priestess bless my room.&nbsp; It was holy water..and what I sensed
outside my
<br>window in the dorms was bad.&nbsp; I don't know what she did but she
messed up.
<br>I lived in an apartment with many people and had a friend staying with
me
<br>for a few months.&nbsp; Soon after the "blessing" was done I noticed
a cross of
<br>light formed by my blinds that fell in the center of my room...I also
<br>noticed the grain of wood on the door to my closet take on this sinister
<br>horned beast formation which I traced later...I have witnesses to these
<br>things (people who disbelieve in ghosts and the like.)&nbsp; Anyhow...since
we
<br>had many guests in my large apartment I tended to lock my door inthe
nights.
<br>One night I forgot and my friend Daniel saw me standing at the door
with a
<br>somber expression...he called out to me and I did not answer.&nbsp;
He looked
<br>next to him and saw me sleeping in my bed.&nbsp; A month later I had
woken up
<br>about 6 am...there was the blue/gray light of daylight - I saw my friend
<br>lying in bed with me with his arm propped up staring right at me lying
<br>halfway on Daniel who slept awkwardly onthe edge of the bed.&nbsp;
Face to face
<br>with this pale translucent figure I couldn't believe my eyes...but
I won't
<br>forget the Cheshire Cat grin, similar to the one I'd seen on an apparition
<br>I'd seen in class...To this day I don't know whether I'd seen a
<br>ghost/spirit/somoething more serious...but after I moved to Brooklyn
I
<br>haven't had any experiences like that since...

<p><font size=+2>Not Exactly a Ghost Story</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>By: jbelisl@banet.net
<br>&nbsp;
<p>This story isn't exactly a ghost story. I can't identify what happened
<br>or what they were as typical ghost experiences. Both of the experiences
<br>below are true to the best of my perception. And BTW I had other similar
<br>experiences that I just can't remember right now.&nbsp; Anyway here
they are.
<p>About two years ago during the summertime I came awake in the early
a.m.
<br>hours. I woke up in a slow way that is like being drawn out of sleep.
As
<br>I was waking and realizing that I was waking up I sensed something
<br>approaching my house. It was a feeling like you just know it is there.
<br>It was approaching my house from due west in a perfect line at a pretty
<br>good rate of speed. I have no idea what it was, I just could feel its
<br>movement and trajectory. In about a second or two it reached my house
<br>and slammed into the siding like a 50 pound sack of potatoes. It was
<br>loud. The house shook. Now my bedroom is on the third floor in a room
<br>converted from an attic. My windows are a good thirty feet above the
<br>ground. Nothing heavy&nbsp; could possibly reach the section of outside
wall
<br>that this thing hit without the aid of heavy equipment. I got up and
<br>checked the siding to see if something did hit it. Nothing. The vinyl
<br>siding looked unaltered in anyway. I questioned my roommates at the
time
<br>to see if they heard or felt anything. They were both asleep and
<br>experienced nothing.
<br>As soon as it hit the house the sense of it being there disappeared.
<br>Like it just traveled a great distance in a perfect line, hit my house
<br>and then just vaporized. I don't have any impression of what it was.
I
<br>only felt something moving through the ether.
<p>The second instance was a little more up close and was visual. This
<br>happened last fall if I remember correctly. This time it was in the
<br>middle of the night. I don't remember checking the time. About 1 or
2
<br>am.&nbsp; Again like last time I awoke from sleep in a slow drawing
kind of
<br>way. Like your mind making you wake up due to some outside stimulus
<br>needing&nbsp; your attention. This time as I was first coming to waking
<br>awareness I sensed something on the ceiling. Just as I realized this
I
<br>looked up with sleep ladened eyes and say a small dark shape about
the
<br>size of a mouse drop from the ceiling. I have a textured sprayed
<br>ceiling. The kind that crumbles to dust if you touch it with anything.
<br>Anything larger than a insect has no hope of maintaining a grip on
it.
<br>And besides why would a mouse want to travel on my ceiling? This thing
<br>fell from the ceiling in a straight line just like the law of gravity
<br>imposes on everything. It hit my bed and bounced off it onto the floor
<br>and then scrambled behind my two panel, folding door that goes to my
<br>bathroom. The proof that I wasn't imagining it comes from one of my
cats
<br>who sleeps on my bed every night. He tore off after whatever it was.
But
<br>as soon as it went behind the door it dissappeared. There is a large
<br>bookcase right next to where that door folds up. The only exit from
<br>behind that door is to continue into the bathroom throught the crack
<br>created by the door when it is folded or back out the way it went in.
I
<br>watched it go behind the door but I didn't see it go into the bathroom.
<br>>From my bed I have a perfect view of that part of the door. If it
went
<br>in there I would have saw it. My cat was right behind it when it went
<br>behind the door.&nbsp; But as soon as he reached the door he suddenly
<br>stopped. And he stared for a second at where the thing went and then
he
<br>started looking around. Like he followed it and he suddenly lost it
and
<br>couldn't find it. This thing just dissappeared.
<p>I have no clue as to what either of these things were. Nor any sort
of
<br>proof other than witnessing them.
<p>If anyone has any info. as to what these things could possibly be,
<br>please e-mail me. Thanks.

<br><font size=+2>Personal Experiences 2</font>
<p>By:Steven_Harrison@pancanadian.ca
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Further to my last letter, on that same vacation in the summer of 1972,
<br>we travelled across Canada to Ontario, then returned through the
<br>northern states, ending up on the west coast of Canada before returning
<br>to our home in the British Columbia Southern Interior.&nbsp; The next
strange
<br>event that happened after the Ontario incident was at a historic site
in
<br>the western U.S.&nbsp; It was either Wall, South Dakota or Little Bighorn,
<br>Montana, the site of Custer's Last Stand.&nbsp; The location sticks
in my
<br>mind as being the latter.&nbsp; The interpretive centre had a display
of a
<br>telegraph office, complete with a figure seated at the telegraph key.
<br>Being kids (14and 12) my sister and I just had to play with the exhibit
<br>and began tapping out a message on the telegraph key, pretending we
knew
<br>morse code.&nbsp; When we stopped and started to go on to other amusements,
<br>the telegraph key tapped out a message in return.&nbsp; We thought
that was
<br>pretty cool, so we went to find the caretaker and asked him what the
<br>telegraph was hooked up to.&nbsp; He told us it wasn't hooked up to
anything;
<br>it was just an exhibit.&nbsp; When we told him it tapped out a message,
he
<br>said that was impossible and showed us telegraph display as it looked
on
<br>the side we couldn't reach.&nbsp; There was nowhere a person could
have
<br>hidden and not been seen.&nbsp; The telegraph wasn't hooked up to anything
at
<br>all.&nbsp; There were no wires connected to key and there was certainly
no
<br>way a message could have been received let alone sent.&nbsp; To this
day I
<br>wonder what the message was and who was trying to contact us.

<br><font size=+2>Two Stories and Advice on how to smudge</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>By: jgodinez@aracnet.com
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp; Hello!&nbsp; I noticed that several people wanted to know how
to do the sage smudging to cleanse their houses but were unsure
<br>how to do it.&nbsp; I have two stories to submit and will give directions
for the cleansing at the end.&nbsp; First Story:&nbsp; My father
<br>&nbsp;had a being that was attached to him that was not very nice.&nbsp;
My sisters and I called it "The Aztec ___hole."&nbsp; I don't know
<br>why we called it that, but that was the feeling we got from it. Although
my father was devoutly religious he was not
<br>sensitive in any sense of the word.&nbsp; This being thrived on grief
and fear and would try to terrorize us when ever he could.
<br>&nbsp; (the Aztec, not my Dad.) and never entered the church when my
Dad would go. I never actually saw this thing but I knew it
<br>&nbsp;was there and it was male and it was a jerk.&nbsp; One night
after my sisters had gone on to college, I was sleeping in the
<br>living room because we had other family over.&nbsp; In the middle of
the night I heard footsteps and assumed that it was someone
<br>&nbsp;in the family up and getting water or going to the bathroom or
whatever.&nbsp; I didn't think much about it until the footsteps
<br>&nbsp;came closer and circled where I was.&nbsp; I looked up and there
was no one there. I turned on the lamp near the couch and I
<br>could see foot prints in the carpet... being made.&nbsp; I knew immediately
that it was the Aztec ___hole!&nbsp; It proceeded to walk
<br>&nbsp;to the piano and kick it so it made a noise.&nbsp; I was really
scared and knew it was standing there smiling that I was so
<br>afraid. I tried to calm myself and started to pray and when I did that
it left.&nbsp; Years later my Dad died and I knew when he
<br>&nbsp;died that he had gone to that great clearing house in the sky
to figure out what he had done this lifetime and what to do
<br>the next.&nbsp; I had no sense of him hanging around which was really
good and comforting.&nbsp; However, a few nights after his death
<br>I was sitting at the table late at night and lo and behold the atmosphere
changed and a very humble Aztec ___hole entered
<br>&nbsp;the room.&nbsp; Since my Dad had moved on he had no one to attach
to.&nbsp; He actually had the nerve to ask if he could attach to
<br>&nbsp;me!&nbsp; I prayed and basically said out loud."In the name of
Christ you are not welcome here. You may not attach to me, this
<br>&nbsp;house, my family, our animals nothing that has anything to do
with us.&nbsp; In the name of Christ, be gone!" Then I said&nbsp; "Lord,
<br>&nbsp;bless this house and remove any disincarnated being that is not
suppose to be here.&nbsp; Thank You!&nbsp; Amen."&nbsp; I have never felt
<br>it since.&nbsp; Thank God!&nbsp; Since then mom has remodeled the house
and it is much lighter and happier!&nbsp; O.K. Second story:&nbsp; This
<br>one is a nice one not scary.&nbsp; I had a Great Uncle Wayne and he
was a great uncle in more ways than one! I and my whole
<br>family just adored him!&nbsp; When I was sixteen my Mom and I decided
to go see the U.K.&nbsp; While we were there we both saw a man
<br>at our first stop in Ireland that looked just like Uncle Wayne, I guess
that's called a doppelganger.&nbsp; Anyway we both
<br>commented to each other how much he looked like Uncle Wayne.&nbsp;
The man was smoking a cigar (Just like Uncle Wayne.&nbsp; Uncle
<br>Wayne loved cigars!) and drinking and laughing and having a great time.&nbsp;
We didn't speak to him, but he could have passed
<br>&nbsp;for his twin.&nbsp; We were gone for a month on our trip.(Had
a fabulous time!)&nbsp; When we returned we learned that Uncle Wayne
<br>had died, around the week we were in Ireland!&nbsp; We had missed his
funeral and I hadn't gotten the chance to say goodbye.&nbsp; A
<br>&nbsp;few days after we got back.&nbsp; I was sitting on the couch
reading the newspaper, my grandmother was sitting five feet away
<br>and my mom was maybe 15 feet away sitting at the table.&nbsp; All of
a sudden I smelled, very strongly, his cigar smoke! I asked
<br>&nbsp;mom and Grandma if they smelled it and they both said no. I said
"I love you Uncle Wayne, goodbye!"&nbsp; Mom thought I was
<br>being silly, but I'm glad I said it!&nbsp; O.K. Now onto how to cleanse
your house with sage:&nbsp; First get a bundle of sage sticks
<br>&nbsp;from any healthfood store put them in a dish or pot that can
withstand open flame and can be easily carried.&nbsp; Disconnect
<br>any smoke alarms and remember to reconnect them when done.&nbsp; Light
the sage and allow it to smoke. It shouldn't burn rapidly,
<br>&nbsp;if it does blow it out and relight as smoke runs out. Go to every
corner of each room in your house and bless each corner.&nbsp; I don't
care what religion you are If you are Christian, invoke the name of Christ,
if you are Wicca invoke the name of the Goddess, Buddhist, Buddha, ect...
It doesn't matter. What matters is that you have faith and that your religion
is for good and light not evil and darkness.&nbsp; I happen to be Christian
so this is how I did it but you can modify it to your particular religion.&nbsp;
Blessing each corner I made the sign of the cross with the smoke from the
sage&nbsp; and said "In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit I command
and demand let the light of the Lord Jesus Christ shine through and any
and all spirits not of the Lord be driven from this house forever!&nbsp;
Amen!"&nbsp; I repeated this in every corner of every room (as I said modify
as needed!)&nbsp; Once every corner has been blessed.&nbsp; Go to the center
of each room and claim it in the name of your personal Deity as in "In
the name of The Heavenly Father, this room is the Lord's room in which
I will dwell in light and peace.&nbsp; Thank you Lord.&nbsp; Amen." (modify
as
<br>needed)&nbsp; Once you are done make sure you reconnect your smoke
alarms and that the sage is extinguished then discard of the
<br>&nbsp;sage.&nbsp; Also, any room that was particularly creepy before,
be sure to fill that room with life.&nbsp; Put plants in there, play
<br>&nbsp;happy music, make an effort to be in that room more and I can
pretty much guarantee that the creepiness will lift the more
<br>&nbsp;life, and the more happy energy you put in there.&nbsp; Also
NEVER, EVER play with an Ouija board!&nbsp; They ARE DANGEROUS!!!&nbsp;
They
<br>tend to attract low vibrational spirits such as elementals and demons!&nbsp;
If you wish to contact a dearly departed.&nbsp; Go to a
<br>reputable psychic such as one affiliated with the Church of Divine
Man.&nbsp; O.K. lecture over.&nbsp; Hope this last bit on the
<br>smudging is helpful!&nbsp; Peace and Light be with you.

<br>&nbsp;
<p>While working one evening to Finnish the remodel before school
<br>would resume the September of 1998. My partner was down towards the
North end
<br>of the corridor. He told me he felt uneasy, and wanted to call it a
night.
<br>Naturally I was curious, and wanted to know why. He said he felt someone
<br>following him from room to room, and at times actually felt surrounded.
I
<br>laughed, told him he was just over worked. As we walked down the hall
closing
<br>all of the windows and doors, I heckled him the whole way about ghosts,
and
<br>just made fun. We were just finishing up and waiting for the elevator,
when
<br>we heard a tool box fall over. We ran down the corridor expecting to
catch a
<br>kid up there fooling around. When we opened the door there was know
one
<br>there, but the window was open. It was on my side of the corridor,
and I know
<br>I shut it. But my partner pocking fun at me insisted we check the room
next
<br>it, since I can't be trusted. Of course it was his turn give me grief.
So we
<br>looked into the room, and that window was also open. We laughed, and
shut it.
<br>As we proceeded down the hall every window on my side was open. We
checked
<br>his side, and of course found the same. I accused him of fooling with
me, but
<br>when he answered he almost cried. Uncomfortable we shut every window,
and
<br>didn't bother to double check. We left. Not much of a story but weird.

<p>Hi my name is Emily&nbsp; im only 9 years old but i've had my shere
of expiriencie's I have a funny feeling that my school
<br>&nbsp;is hunted it is about 200 years old (or more). I did some reserch
at school with my friends and we have seen a few .me and
<br>my Grandma have had a experince and they are more or less the same.
I have got some notes.But i'm shure you would be more
<br>intersted in my experince. I'll start with my Grandma's expirince.&nbsp;
Grandma was setterling down to sleep and when she was
<br>asleep she felt the bed go down and something&nbsp; rubbed her shodler
and the something said don't worry every thing will be o.k
<br>.Thean bed went up again and then nothing. Mine was exalctley the same
only with out the speeking and the bed thing. At
<br>school we've seen 5 or 6 of them we have played with us and spoken
to us and now most of us have sort of forgotten but we
<br>know that we will never be alone.

<br><font size=+2>Things Happening</font>
<p>By: twokool4u@mindspring.com
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Hi, my name is Meagen, and I want to tell you that I'm so glad that
I've finally found someone to talk to about my ghost
<br>problem who knows what they're doing and, most importantly, won't think
I'm crazy! Boy, where do I start?&nbsp; There's so much
<br>to say.&nbsp; Well, my family had lived in my father's house for almost
my entire life, and as long as I can remember being there,
<br>weird little things would happen every once and a while that are still
unexplained.&nbsp; Our garage door would roll up and down
<br>sproadically for minutes without anyone touching the button, and the
plants in our kitchen would fall off the shelves in
<br>plain view, even though my dad had put raised wood around the edges
to prevent it from happening.&nbsp; Once we came home and all the wallpaper
in our bathroom was lying on the floor.&nbsp; Another time I'd been lying
down in my room with my mom and we heard a distinct sound like someone
was pushing a box across the attic floor above us, right in the area of
the house where the
<br>insulation prevented anyone from walking there without falling through
the ceiling.&nbsp; But what distrubed me the most was an
<br>occasion where the bathtub faucet had gone on full blast, in the middle
of the night, by itself.&nbsp; My dad had accused one of
<br>us of sleep-walking, but soon after, my sister and I had come in from
playing outside and discovered it'd been turned on
<br>again, this time in the middle of the day.&nbsp; Little things like
that, but the fact that our house was older, right around the
<br>&nbsp;corner from a small cemetary, and one of the previous owners
had died there, added to my suspicions.
<br>About four or five years ago, my parents got divorced and everyone
but my dad had moved out.&nbsp; The physical aspects of the
<br>haunting seemed to stop then, but since and still I feel this kind-of
unavoidable presence, I guess you could call it,
<br>whenever I'm there, and it continues to scare me.&nbsp; I don't see,
hear, or feel anything in the physical sense, but I have
<br>this intuition that something is THERE.&nbsp; It's gotten to the point
where I actually refuse to stay there by myself, especially
<br>at night.&nbsp; (I don't understand how you could have possibly lived
in a haunted house for 29 years and not have been bothered
<br>by it!) My mom and I have always believed that something is in that
house.&nbsp; For the past few years, I have, (and she much
<br>longer) been visited by numerous different ghosts and spirits in dreams
that seem so real we actually wake up too scared to
<br>&nbsp;get out of bed.&nbsp; Often, they're concurrent in time and in
message.&nbsp; That is what disturbs me the most.
<br>My mom mainly has them about ghosts hurting her new little daughter
and herself.&nbsp; We've been trying to find a new house now
<br>&nbsp;for about two years, and after each time we go to look at one,
she has a dream about her or my half-sister getting hurt in
<br>&nbsp;it.&nbsp; I recently had a violent one in which a woman spirit
in my dad's house kept telling me to kill little children, but
<br>usually the ghosts I dream are only THERE or have something to show
me.&nbsp; Once I dreamt that one had written some kind of
<br>weird phrase all over the walls of my dad's house and kept repeating
a date over and over.&nbsp; (It didn't know the significance
<br>&nbsp;of the date because it came and went without anything happening.)&nbsp;
The most memorable, however, was the one where I was
<br>guided through my dad's yard to the hedges where a list of names of
people that haunted his house was hung in a frame right
<br>&nbsp;above it.&nbsp; The ghost then took me inside and introduced
me to the spirits of the people and told me that Rembrandt was my
<br>step-father's guardian angel. I know that all this may sound a little
far-fetched to you, (it sounds that way to ME as I'm
<br>writing it) but it's the truth, and if you could please make any sense
out of it for me (and my mom), I would greatly
<br>appreciate it.&nbsp; You can e-mail me at twokool4u@mindspring.com.
