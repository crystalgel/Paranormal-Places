<P><B>Attacked by a Male Figure</B>

<P><B>By: WaifKat@aol.com</B>

<P><B>I have had several experiences in the house I grew up in.&nbsp; It
was a very old farm house much like the one I live in now and do still
have contact experiences with "ghosts".&nbsp; Frequently the bed will shake
and tremor which is usually followed by a sighting or some sort of breif
physical contact.</B>
<BR><B>One night as I lay in my sister's bed alone, with my friend in the
room next door, I was attacked by a tall, dark male figure.&nbsp; I had
not yet fallen asleep. All of a sudden there was someone else on the bed.&nbsp;
This was a queen size water bed.&nbsp; He was straddling my stomach area
and holding his hands over my mouth while plugging my nose as well.&nbsp;
I could not breathe.&nbsp; I tried to scream but the force was too great.&nbsp;
I tried to struggle, to knock something over to get the attention of my
friend in the next room, but he was too heavy.&nbsp; I now realize there
were probably more than one of them there that night because it would take
more than two hands to hold my mouth, my nose, and both of my arms down.&nbsp;
This struggle lasted about a minute until finally I somehow broke free
and ran into the next room, crying and shaking to tell my friend about
the entire event.&nbsp; But, before that happened I looked up at the foot
of the bed and saw a figure, about 6 feet tall or more, completely dark
- I mean opaque black against the light wall - standing there.&nbsp; He
appeared to be wearing a hat similar to a cowboy hat.&nbsp; Something large
and unlike a baseball hat.</B>
<BR><B>Since this happened I have had several occurances in my old house
and the one I live in now involving the bed shaking, but never again have
I been attacked or harmed.&nbsp; Before I had ever even told my fiance'
about my experiences he came to me, embarrassed to tell me out of fear
I would laugh at him or think he was stupid, and told me that the night
before while he was alone up in our room, the bed shook.&nbsp; It made
me tear up because I was so happy that it had happened to someone else
and not just me, some sort of proof.</B>
<BR><B>To this day I constantly feel them touching me in various places
on my body but these are "pleasant" touches, just to say hello. (tickling
of my feet, poking, stroking my hair, etc.)&nbsp; My sister has felt it
too, as well as pretty much anyone who has ever stayed the night or lived
in our house.&nbsp; A lot of things disappear, too.&nbsp; And then reappear
a few days later.&nbsp; I have several friends on the other side and a
grandmother who I believe is watching out for me so I just trust that it
is them, and hope that they are keeping that evil man away from me.&nbsp;
Though I can't even sleep upstairs in this house alone because even when
someone is with me I see a dark blob traveling the walls and ceiling and
hope it isn't him.</B>
<BR><B>I hope this was not too long and boring for you, but I stumbled
upon the site and thought I would contribute my two cents.&nbsp; Thanks.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;Artists House</B>

<P><B>By: sales@cloudninegraphics.com</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;Back in 1989 my partner and I were commissioned to manage and
take care of the Artist House. A Victorian home built around 1900. Currently
run as</B>
<BR><B>a profible guest house and continues too till this day. Sure I had
heard of its strange past but never gave it much thought and was really
more excited</B>
<BR><B>of the prospect of living in such a stylish home than to worry about
its past owners and history. Probably my first mistake.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, so here you are in beautiful sunny Key West
Floriday and you have been offered the job to take care of this bed and
breakfast. You recieve a small salary and get to live virtually free in
the luxury of paradise. Too good to be true.&nbsp; As you enter the front
doorway of the Victorian you immediatly feel the tempeture drop about 15
degrees. You think to yourself well that nice that they have such great
air conditioning, when it also occures to you that there is no central
air system but only a few window units descreetly positioned in the rooms.
You let this notion pass because you are taken in by the heavy moldingsand
beautifuly wallpapered hall ways which guild you to the check in area.
Wow this house is a knock out!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't wait to get started on my job which is
to greet the guests and make sure thier rooms are manicured to perfection.
Two, Three, Four weeks go by</B>
<BR><B>with out much insident. I do notice from time to time, usually when
Im alone in the house depending which room Im working on that I get a feeling
of</B>
<BR><B>nausea or a feeling that " your in someone elses" home when your
not suppose to be there. Why did I feel this way, I don't know. Some days
the feeling&nbsp; would be very strong to the point that I didn't really
want to go home period. Definatly the unexplainable.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day a guest said to me " you didn't tell
me the house was haunted." My partner jokeingly advised her " yes, but
we have made so much head way with the improvments on the old place I think
they appriciate us more than they haunt us." I thougt to myself, well I'm
glad I'm not the only one feeling&nbsp; this way. My partner never gave
much credence to the possiblility of gohsts and parranormal.&nbsp; That
same morning after everyone had departed from breakfast, I proceded to
start cleaning the rooms.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting with the turrett room at the front of
the house I would work my way to the back, usually an all day project.
This particular morning I had just finished&nbsp; making up the bed in
the turrett room and was going to start cleaning the bathroom. The whole
time I had to go in and out for supplies and whatever else I needed to
clean the room the feeling of dred or discord was really heavy for some
reason. I thought whats wrong with me. Maybe Im getting the flew or&nbsp;
somthing. As Im cleaning the tub area of the bath room I can see the bed
area just across the threshold. The bed which I had just made was being
sat on or laid on by some entity who very much wanted to be seen. All which
was physically seen was a depression in the bed. That was enough for me.
I turned off the vaccume cleaner and walked right out of the room. Saying
somthing to the effect " Whenever your ready to leave, I'll finish cleaning
the room"&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't tell too many people that story for obvious
reasons but it trully made a believer out of me. Several other incidents
occoured as well but that one was the iceing on the cake. I never told
my partner that story either. I think certain spirits make themselves noticable
to certain people for certain reasons of their own. I purchased a house
of my own shortly after that and took the Artist House experience as a
learning one which I will never forget! If anyone out there does not belive
me they are free to stay there its still open for buisness, I on the other
hand will pass.</B>

<BR><B>A Pet Guide over the Bridge</B>

<P><B>By: rossiwrites@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>During my last year of college I was living in a huge</B>
<BR><B>attic aparment with my kitty. It was a house divided</B>
<BR><B>into three apartments and the other tenants had moved</B>
<BR><B>out. The landlord wanted to sell the property and it</B>
<BR><B>started to fall into disrepair.</B>
<BR><B>To set the scene....my front door opened onto a</B>
<BR><B>staircase that led up to my loft-like apartment. The</B>
<BR><B>landing had tile outside the door and inside as well,</B>
<BR><B>so nothing to catch on. I was the only tenant who</B>
<BR><B>still had access to the bldg.</B>
<BR><B>My cat was expecting a litter of Himalayan kittens in</B>
<BR><B>a couple days. One night, (a couple days before her</B>
<BR><B>due date) I came home from work and she came running</B>
<BR><B>down the stairs meowing....I saw that her water had</B>
<BR><B>broke and knew she either had her kittens or was in</B>
<BR><B>labor.</B>
<BR><B>As I was closing my front door, it stopped hard in</B>
<BR><B>mid-swing as if it hit a brick wall. I tried to pull</B>
<BR><B>it again and it wouldn't budge at all, as if an</B>
<BR><B>extremely strong force was holding it. Normally I</B>
<BR><B>would have been so frightened I would have run out of</B>
<BR><B>the house, but I had to take care of my cat and make</B>
<BR><B>sure her kittens were ok. Besides, I didn't feel</B>
<BR><B>anything pass by me and for some reason I was</B>
<BR><B>unafraid.&nbsp; Finally, I reached out to close the door</B>
<BR><B>and it closed fine.</B>
<BR><B>Three of her kittens had been born and I saw the 4th</B>
<BR><B>one be born. My cat seemed to know that something was</B>
<BR><B>wrong... she kept meowing and seemed anxious and</B>
<BR><B>concerned about the litter, although they nursed, she</B>
<BR><B>ate the after-births, and was washing them.</B>
<BR><B>I was in an out of town wedding the next day and a</B>
<BR><B>friend of mine came to look after them. When I</B>
<BR><B>returned, two days later, one of the kittens was dead</B>
<BR><B>and over the course of eight days, all four died. The</B>
<BR><B>last one died in my hand as I was rushing it to the</B>
<BR><B>vet and oddly, it seemed to get just a wee bit lighter</B>
<BR><B>at the moment of death...as if it's little soul left</B>
<BR><B>it's body. I buried all of the kittens in the</B>
<BR><B>backyard, the last one in a Legg Egg as I ran out of</B>
<BR><B>shoeboxes.</B>
<BR><B>I believe the litter just was not meant to be and that</B>
<BR><B>whatever entity came into my house that night was</B>
<BR><B>there to guide them back over the bridge.</B>

<BR><B>A Grandmothers Ghost</B>

<P><B>By: selia21_sw@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>Strange things have happened to me all my life and I am only 20.
I am not</B>
<BR><B>sure why I feel the need to write this for your website but I’ve
been</B>
<BR><B>thinking about it all day and now 2:30 am I made up my mind. Also
I am sorry for any spellings English is not my native language.</B>
<BR><B>It all started when I was born and my parents moved to this old
house. They</B>
<BR><B>would wake up in the middle of the night by the sounds of foot steps
coming</B>
<BR><B>from my room and running down the hall way. Some times it would
be someone knocking on our door and every time my father would run to see
who it was and every time no one was there. So far my parents ignored all
this saying that the house was old and old houses make strange noises.
The really strange things started to happed when I was 3-4 years old I
remember parts of this my mother told me that parts I don’t remember.</B>
<BR><B>I was the kind of child that was not afraid of being left alone
or sleeping</B>
<BR><B>in my own room with all the lights off. I think the reason for this
is</B>
<BR><B>because I had a ghost-grandmother (note both my grandmothers are
alive). My mother would hear me laughing and talking to someone in my room
but she though all children do that; what got her thinking that I was really
not</B>
<BR><B>alone was this police car toy I had that was broken for 2 years
and one day</B>
<BR><B>decided to turn on (without battery) and drive in circles around
me. I guess</B>
<BR><B>I though it was fun because I was giggling but my mother grabbed
me and run to out next door neighbor an old lady I remember well to this
day. Anyway my mother told her what happen and the old lady told her “I
was not going to tell you anything because I didn’t want to scar you. An
old lady used to live in your house, she had no children and she was all
alone her greatest sorrow was not having children around her. She died
(her heart stopped) one day in the bathroom”. After that my mother really
got scared and called a priest to bless the house since then nothing happen
until I was 10 and this is the things that I myself remember happenin.
My grandmother came to visit us and we put a bed for her in my room. I
had this toy that I was really attached to from when I was really young,
the kind of toy you pull a string and it walks playing music only I had
broken the sting and it didn’t work anymore. Well when my grand mother
and I went to sleep this toy worked! We woke up by its music and saw the
toy going under my grandmother’s bed, my grand mother got scared and called
my dad to take the toy and said she would not sleep in my room anymore.
I believe it was my grandmother-ghost being jealous of my real grandmother;
I still have that toy to remind me of her because for some reason I feel
like she was part of my family. A year later we moved and the house was
destroyed to build a new one, I remember my grandmother ghost was very
angry about this because the last week before we moved she would do strange
things like move the washing-machine from one end of the room to the other
(only my father could move that). I still wonder what happen to her after
we moved. Does anyone know what happens to a spirit</B>
<BR><B>when its home is taken away from it?</B>

<P><B>1730 House</B>

<P><B>By: Baileykd99@aol.com</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have a ghost story to tell you! And it's true! We live in Massachusetts
in a town that has a lot of history. The houses date back before the Revolutionary
War, and some people in town has had experiences with ghost. Well, while
my families house was being built we lived in a rental house that was built
around 1730. It had two floors on the first floor they have the kitchen,
living room, dining room, and the family room which was always damp and
cold. The second floor only had two rooms, and in the room I shared with
my brother they had two closets. Well, one night my mother changed our
room around so my brothers bed was against my closet, and my bed was next
to his, my brother and I heard footsteps in the closet, these footsteps
or tapping in the closet continued for another hour. After a half an hour
of this I told my father of course he didn't believe me and said it could
be a number of things like the dog or maybe a tree branch. Then I went
downstairs and I saw my Mom and the dog in the living room, and there was
no trees near our end of the house. That was only thing that happened to
me, but nine months later when we moved out my parents told some friends
of ours that they heard someone in the attic walking and rolling something.
My father checked and nothing was there, and when my mother was home alone
one day she heard my dog bark and growl. She saw my dog in the entrance
of the family room just sitting their barking at something in the room
my mother checked and nothing was there. My mother then saw my dogs fur
standing up. Trust me if I knew something was in the house I wouldn't have
been down in the living room at 12am by myself. Thanks for reading my experience.
It's not as bad as some , but for those who's had experiences like this
they will tell you even the littlest things can give you the chills.</B>

<BR><B>A Few Stories</B>

<P><B>By: TEMPTRESS69877@aol.com</B>

<P><B>I just wanted to share a few stories with you that I have experinced.</B>
<BR><B>The first one happened not too long after my son was born. I was
living in Holyoke Ma. and I had just brought my son home from the hospital
a few months earlier. I had put my son to bed for the night and I went
downstairs to get something I can't remember what it was but when i came
back upstairs the room was dark and I saw a shadow next to my sons bed.
It wasn't his father cuz he wasn't home at the time that this happened.
I just stood there watching it for a few minutes and then I heard my son
start to cry I asked what ever it was to leave him alone and told it that
if it wanted to play with the baby it had to wait till the morning cuz
he was sleeping and he needed to get his sleep. What ever it was respected
my wishes and left him alone it went into the closet and I didnt see it
again after that but I could feel that it was still there and playing with
my son from time to time.</B>
<BR><B>the second time I encountered some thing was when I was at my moms
house alone during the day I heard some people talking in her basement
and I smelled cigars and no one in the house smokes cigars. So I called
my mom who told me that it's ok she heard it too some times and then she
told me what I had thought all these years. She told me that I had a gift
and it has been with my family for generations. Everyone in my family has
it but only a few accknowledge it and that it was ok for me to talk to
them. But I have gone through a whole lot of other things in my life but
those are the few that have happened in the past 4 years but I have many
more to share and if you waould like to know them just let me know and
I will be happy to share them with you in the future.</B>
<BR><B>One more thing my son is now 4 years old and he sees them too and
always has the one that was in his room when he first came home forom the
hospital is still with him and i think his name is Shawn.</B>

<BR><B>Dove at Window</B>

<P><B>By: nrbachp@mail.dnr.state.mo.us</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>This may not be a ghost story, but it is close.&nbsp; On my 21st
birthday (April 27), at 4a.m. my best friends younger brother, Jason, died
while driving drunk.&nbsp; He was like a younger brother to me.&nbsp; It
still saddens me at the thought of his untimely death.&nbsp; Anyway, on
that morning and the next two mornings until Jason was buried, a mourning
dove flew up to my window at 7a.m. while I was looking out and it landed
in the proximal tree.&nbsp; Of the 5 years in that dorm room, a dove had/has
never flown up to the window since.&nbsp; I think it might have been Jason
saying goodbye.&nbsp; Jason's funeral was held at 10a.m. the third morning
and my mother attended.&nbsp; It was a 4 hour drive from my dorms and I
had class, so I did not attend the funeral.&nbsp; However, my mother, and
a few others, said they saw me in the gathering at the funeral site.&nbsp;
I have never been to Jason's grave or even know where it is.&nbsp; Strange
isn't it.</B>

<P><B>Experience with the Paranormal</B>

<P><B>By: skkloki@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>I just recently began viewing your website and the stories there
in. I have</B>
<BR><B>had very few encounters with them paranormal, of which there is
one incedent</B>
<BR><B>enperticular that will forever rest in my memories. Im 18 now but
at the</B>
<BR><B>time I was about 7 or 8. My family and I lived in the small town
of</B>
<BR><B>Springwater, N.Y. I would also like to state that the occourence
was not</B>
<BR><B>related to or happened in the trailor we lived in, but more like
on the</B>
<BR><B>property itself. I cant remember the exact date that it happened
but I do</B>
<BR><B>remember in great detail the phenomanon. My sister and I shared
a room</B>
<BR><B>together since the trailor had only two bedrooms. It was late at
night when</B>
<BR><B>my sister was frightened by something so my mother came into the
room to</B>
<BR><B>stay with her. I then had to go sleep in wiht my dad. Not much later
after I</B>
<BR><B>had gotten to sleep I awoke with a strange feeling that something
was not</B>
<BR><B>right. I put it off and went to get myself a glass of water. Upon
return to</B>
<BR><B>my parents bedroom a strange erge overcame me to look out the windows.</B>
<BR><B>Before I continue I should state how the room was arranged. To the
left was</B>
<BR><B>the door which led to the halway and the rest of the trailor. On
the back</B>
<BR><B>wall was the head board of the bed which pointed to the front of
the</B>
<BR><B>trailor. The room was the last room on the left end of the trailor.
And over</B>
<BR><B>on the left wall was two windows, each only about a few feet from
each</B>
<BR><B>other. And at the corner where the left wall met the front wall
was another</B>
<BR><B>window that faced the front yard. Also to the left of the of the
left wall</B>
<BR><B>if you can imagin it was the driveway.&nbsp; I proceeded to go to
the last window</B>
<BR><B>on the left wall.&nbsp; I slowly pulled back the curtins to reveal
I sight I was</B>
<BR><B>not expecting.&nbsp; Its hard to explaine exactly what I saw but
I will try my</B>
<BR><B>best.&nbsp; At a rate of about one every second a large oval shaped
light,</B>
<BR><B>messuring about a eight inches in height and about a foot in length,
would</B>
<BR><B>flypast the window. I wasnt frightened by this but more like confused.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>continued onto the next window and pulled back the curtins and yet
again the</B>
<BR><B>fly ovals of light were still zooming past the window. Now I was
getting</B>
<BR><B>creeped out. So thats when I went to the front window and pulled
back the</B>
<BR><B>curtins. To my surprise the lights were still there. Now it wasnt
just one</B>
<BR><B>or two lights rotateing but a line of of them that didnt stop. As
they flew</B>
<BR><B>down the driveway they crossed the road over to the field on the
other side</B>
<BR><B>and continued on threw the field and as soon as they hit the forest
on the</B>
<BR><B>edge of the feild they would dissapear.&nbsp; I watched this for
a little bit</B>
<BR><B>then I just closed the curtins and went to bed. I had disided not
to wake</B>
<BR><B>anyone for the fear they might not see it and would think I was
crazy. Now</B>
<BR><B>this isnt the end. A few years later my father died from a terrible
accident</B>
<BR><B>but with the money she recieved fromhis life insurence my mother
bought a</B>
<BR><B>double wide trailor on put it on the same property. Not much later
I was out</B>
<BR><B>digging in the front yard when I came across a large rusted iron
peice of</B>
<BR><B>metal shaped into the form of a L. I gave it to my mother who decieded
to</B>
<BR><B>use it as a door stop. I went back out to the yard and continued
digging.&nbsp; A</B>
<BR><B>few feet away from where I had dug up the iron peice I found a railroad</B>
<BR><B>spike, rusted but in otherwise good condition. Not much later some
kids down</B>
<BR><B>the road also found a railroad spike.&nbsp; So after that the explination
I made</B>
<BR><B>for the lights could have been that of a ghost train. I did later
tell my</B>
<BR><B>mom about what I had seen but she didnt believe me. I still think
that what</B>
<BR><B>I saw was real. I know I wasnt dreaming because I could feel the
water I</B>
<BR><B>drank and I had stubed my toe on the bed and it hurt. Thats about
it for my</B>
<BR><B>story. Thank you for taking the time to read my experince with the</B>

<P><B>Yes this a true story . It sounds dumb what i put for subject but
i have a sick sense of humor.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Any who.... Me &amp; my friend were up late at my house and
all of a sudden we both got chills and heard whispers . As we sat there
in fear i finally got the courage to say " HELLO, is any one there?" then
the chair in the kitchen moved about a foot.After that we heard a guy laughing
and thummping up the stairs so of course us being curious teens we followed.
When we got to the top we walked to my room and looked around and as i
turned there was a black shadow going back down so i ran after it but it
dissapeared.A nd yes we were the only ones in the house</B>

<P><B>I Heard a Ghost Voice</B>

<P><B>By: crazychica21210@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>My name is Shelby and i am turning 13 in oct .Well for some strange
reason ever since i was small i could sense bad things in house we used
to live in. I can't really remeber wat i saw when i was four ,but my mom
said that i was walking down the hall way and i thought she was in the
kitchen and when i went inside the kitchen i ran from there screaming my
head off saying some ones in the kitchen. She would always look but nothing
was there ,but when i went in with her i only can remeber a face tht was
near the frig. So we moved from that the house.When i lived in an apt with
my dad and grandma i would feel some ones presence and at night i couldn't
sleep well .they would tell me to put a blanket over the mirror in my room
and it would have all gone away. So it went away ,weird right.Well now
i live in a house that was built like 7 to 8 yrs ago. We are the first
people to live here but it doesn't seem like my family is the only 1 here.
I mean i was the first to hear things. Well i live in houston and it was
near the time of the alicen horricane and i had got a puppy during easter.
(we have been having bad luck with animals since we moved here) Well the
puppy and i wer sitting in the living room and it was raining and there
was a little thunder outside as well.(i was around ten) Well the puppy
was wimpering and her hair was sticking up and then we heard foot steps
going up and down the stairs (it was stomping) i got scared so i tried
to ignore it. My mom had got home and she heard it to. The next time the
ghost was heard a(my mom heard it)Well mom was sitting on the couch and
from upstairs she heard her name in a whisper.She ignored it and turned
up the tv. (Welli had moved with my dad after the walking up and down the
stairs incident.)I had barely moved back in this house during 2002.</B>
<BR><B>I had just got back 4rm school and i was sitting on the computer
doing my homework and there was a sudden chill. Then something had jerked
my arm back and i was creeped out already .Then it sounded like the same
stomping down the stairs but it was slower and i heard my name in a whisper
i was really freaked out. I screamed my brothers name and he was in my
moms room so he ran past the stairs on his way. I was feeling kind of sick
after but it had stopped for a while. Then some rescent stuff have been
happening. Like when i sit in a room full a people i get a sudden chill
and i get goosebumps all on my legs and arms ,but the weird thing is nobody
else can feel what i am feeling they think i am making up stuff to scare
them :( My friends are the only 1's that believe me becuz they witnessed
most of the stuff at my sleep overs. We would be here alone and in my room
upstairs and my room is the closest 1 to the stairs and we would sort of
hear a whisper of are names and a sum1 walking slowly.(We are always home
alone when these things happen at my sleepovers) A couple of weeks ago
my closet door swung open andand the stuff on the top shelf feel out. My
friend bianca witnessed 1 time that the closet door opened and an iron
came out slowly. The other night my dog sausage and i were sitting in the
living room and i was tlk'n to her.(the kitchen is the next room) Well
the pantry door swung open and there was banging in the laundry room .My
dogs hair was standing up and she was barking + growling at the kitchen.
i wasn't scared i went to shut the pantry door.i couple days ago my 2 friends
came to spend the nite and we wer in the living room .Bianca was on the
com i was on the couch and shauni was asleep .i feel asleep and was awoken
by barking and growling at the kitchen and my friend bianca was pale she
was looking as well. and when i turned my head i saw this figure. It was
a male i couldn't see his face just his back and he was like a smoky blue
colorkind of blurry. i wasn't tht scared just curious. (and sum strange
reasonit feels like at this very moment sumthing is grabing my right ancle.)
well there r more things that happen and i still live here.if anything
else happens i will tell.</B>
<BR><B>Are bad luck with animals. all my mice ate each other. The fish
ate each other. My dog blackie the border collie ran away. My dog Ms.Tickles
(the dog in the beginning of my experiences) she disappeared with out a
trace. My dog malaysia wouldn't get out there canal and she would use the
rest room on herself.My dog sausage my dog at the moment ,she always wants
to be near me like if she is my body guard. My kitten meowy didn't want
me in the house she is an outside cat. Well tht is all i kno abt now .I
red other stories and i saw pictures.</B>
<BR><B>I think this is a great website as well .It is very interesting.Most
ppl in my family don't believe in ghost and think i am lieing so if u think
my story is untrue think what u wanna.</B>

<BR><B>Little Victorian Girl</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>By: John.Muggridge@herbertsmith.com</B>

<P><B>I only have a couple of things to mention.&nbsp; We live in Kent,
England and the</B>
<BR><B>house that we live in is only about 40 years old.&nbsp; Before our
housing estate</B>
<BR><B>was built, it was just woodland.</B>
<BR><B>One night I walked my girlfriend home and when I got back to the
house,</B>
<BR><B>everyone was in bed.&nbsp; As I walked upstairs to go to bed, a
black shadow-like</B>
<BR><B>figure came out of my brothers room, went right across in front
of me and</B>
<BR><B>went into my sisters room directly opposite.&nbsp; At the time every
door was</B>
<BR><B>closed. After that I mentioned this to my sister and she said that
a couple of years ago she woke up during the night and standing facing
her bedroom door, with her back to my sister was a little girl in old fasioned
Victorian clothing.</B>
<BR><B>She just hid her head under the covers and when she plucked up the
courage</B>
<BR><B>to look again, the girl was gone!!&nbsp; She was told by her friends
mother (who</B>
<BR><B>has a sort of sixth sense apparently) that there was a little girl
who looks</B>
<BR><B>over my brother at night.&nbsp; Then my brother started smoking
and shortly after</B>
<BR><B>this, the ashtrays in his room just disappeared.&nbsp; He asked
everyone in the</B>
<BR><B>family what had happened to them, but no one knew.&nbsp; Then some
months later, a perfectly cut quarter of one of the ashtrays turned up
behind one of the radiators when my mum was spring cleaning!!&nbsp; Could
this have been the little girl telling my brother to stop smoking..?</B>
<BR><B>There have been other things, like the dog barking at nothing, especially
in</B>
<BR><B>my brothers and sisters room and strangely in the dining room.&nbsp;
Also my Mum swears she has seen a shadowy figure come down the stairs and
walk past the living room door.&nbsp; Haven't heard or seen anything else
in the house for years though, and all of these incidents happened a good
8 years ago!!!</B>
<BR><B>Hope you enjoyed my little account.</B>

<P><B>Meme's Ghost</B>

<P><B>By: goddessgrl07@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>I don't know if this can be counted as a haunting, but my Grandmother
(meme) died this past November, 4 days before Thanksgiving.&nbsp; The day
after she died, one of her friends "Sherri" volunteered to stuff the turkey
for us because my Grandpa couldn't do it.&nbsp; He agreed and she went
to the refridgerator to get it,&nbsp; She opened up the fridge and it wasn't
there.&nbsp; Now, my grandpa had just put it there a few hours ago, so
we found this a little strange.&nbsp; Everyone searched for the turkey
in the most odd places, like under beds, and under the couch cushins (you
never know what you'll find in there) and we still couldn't find it.&nbsp;
I don't know if it was just a joke somebody pulled, or if Meme really did
take it, but just as Sherri was about to leave, she decidd to check the
fridge again, and there it was, in plain sight on the top shelf.&nbsp;
To this day, everyone still says that she was playing a trick on us.</B>

<BR><B>Middle Eastern haunting</B>

<P><B>By: phoffman@alltech.com</B>

<P><B>Let me begin by saying that I am very sceptical by nature, and have
not had</B>
<BR><B>any other occurences but the one I am about to relate.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;In the fall of 1993 the band I was performing with accepted
a 12 week</B>
<BR><B>house gig in Dubai, U.A.E.</B>
<BR><B>After travelling 2 days with virtually no sleep we arrived to check
into</B>
<BR><B>our band accomodations.&nbsp; Having never been to the Middle East
we were all</B>
<BR><B>struck by the strangeness of our surroundings. We were staying in
a small</B>
<BR><B>flat in an older apartment building about 2 miles from the club
we were to</B>
<BR><B>perform at. I was sharing a room with the guitar player and directly
across</B>
<BR><B>the hall were 2 other members of the band. My bed was situated in
the far</B>
<BR><B>corner of the room, kitty corner from the door, with an air conditioner</B>
<BR><B>built into the wall above where my head would rest. (this becomes
important</B>
<BR><B>later) The first 2 nights I was plagued by very restless sleep and
I felt</B>
<BR><B>very uneasy.The strange environment, smells, humidity, as well as
extreme</B>
<BR><B>jet lag and the&nbsp; regular "call to prayer" that would broadcast
through the</B>
<BR><B>city over speakers from the mosques, all added to the bizarre environment.</B>
<BR><B>After being troubled by very disturbing dreams and restless sleep
for two</B>
<BR><B>nights, on the third, I awoke terrified, covered in sweat with a
vision of</B>
<BR><B>a strange Arab man standing over my bed plunging a large hunting
knife into</B>
<BR><B>my chest over and over, he was holding the knife with two hands
and was</B>
<BR><B>brutally stabbing over and over. I couldn't feel any pain but I
was</B>
<BR><B>terrified. Let me add that this was like no "dream" I have ever</B>
<BR><B>experienced. It was so vivid and real that I&nbsp; am convinced
someone was</B>
<BR><B>standing over me. I ran terrified from the room screaming about
being</B>
<BR><B>stabbed. I barged into the room across the hall being followed by
the</B>
<BR><B>guitar player asking what the heck was going on.&nbsp; I was stammering
about</B>
<BR><B>being stabbed to death and the other three guys all had a good laugh
about</B>
<BR><B>my "nightmare" and eventually we all went back to bed, but I was
very</B>
<BR><B>shaken up.</B>
<BR><B>The next day we went to the club to rehearse and locked the apartment</B>
<BR><B>behind us. No one else had access to the apartment and we were all</B>
<BR><B>together. The main topic of conversation was my eventful night and
I could</B>
<BR><B>not stress enough how realistic this man with the knife was.</B>
<BR><B>After rehearsing I went back to the building to change and let myself
in</B>
<BR><B>with the only key. I made my way to the bedroom and upon entering,</B>
<BR><B>discovered that the face plate from the air conditioner from above
my bed,</B>
<BR><B>was lying on the floor about 15 feet from my bed. There was no way
it could</B>
<BR><B>have fallen and gone that far. It looked like the whole front of
the unit</B>
<BR><B>had been "blown" across the room. Very perplexed I picked it up
and walked</B>
<BR><B>over to examine the air conditioner.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;As I was trying to fit it back on, I noticed a round metal
object slightly</B>
<BR><B>protruding from under the air conditioner. I started to work at
it to see</B>
<BR><B>what it was, and to my horror discovered it was a ten inch hunting
knife</B>
<BR><B>exactly the same as the one from the night before. Somone had clearly</B>
<BR><B>stashed it under the air conditioner, there was no reason for it
to be</B>
<BR><B>there, and I never would have found it, had the face plate stayed
on the</B>
<BR><B>unit. As the other members of the band came in I showed them what
I had</B>
<BR><B>found and they were all speechless.</B>
<BR><B>There is no reasonable explanation for me to have found that knife,
or to</B>
<BR><B>have had that vision, or for the front grill of the air conditioner
to be</B>
<BR><B>across the room.Paul Hoffman, Guelph, Ontario, Canada. We are convinced</B>
<BR><B>that someone was killed violently in that room and wanted the knife
found.</B>
<BR><B>Later we found out that there was a history of problems for people
who had</B>
<BR><B>stayed in that bed. Including the guy who was the singer in the
band that</B>
<BR><B>stayed there before us. He tragically killed himself by jumping
off the</B>
<BR><B>roof of another building in Dubai less than a year later.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Later that afternoon I was very freaked out and&nbsp; I shouted
out to whatever</B>
<BR><B>was there, "Leave me alone,I have nothing to do with this!"&nbsp;
There seemed</B>
<BR><B>to be a noticeable calm come through the room, and that night, and
every</B>
<BR><B>night after, I slept like a baby.</B>

<P><B>Emory and Henry College in Emory, Virginia</B>

<P><B>By: arioz83@yahoo.com</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>This college is extremely haunted. You can t walk</B>
<BR><B>outside without hearing someone speak of an</B>
<BR><B>experience. They even give you a ghost lesson and tour</B>
<BR><B>of the college and nearby city Abingdon because they</B>
<BR><B>are so haunted.</B>
<BR><B>I was so fascinated after I went on a tour that I</B>
<BR><B>needed to find out it my floor and room was haunted.</B>
<BR><B>It was told that my dormitory Wiley Jackson (MaWa) was</B>
<BR><B>one of the most haunted spots on campus and that my</B>
<BR><B>floor (4th) was the most haunted of them all. This is</B>
<BR><B>because it was used as a hospital during one of the</B>
<BR><B>earlier wars (Civil I believe) and that the 4th floor</B>
<BR><B>was known as the&nbsp; crazy people ward .</B>
<BR><B>So I start to do some research and I discover that a</B>
<BR><B>few people had killed themselves though the school</B>
<BR><B>history in MaWa. I get curious and start asking</B>
<BR><B>upperclassmen about stories. One told me a story about</B>
<BR><B>how on the old number side on the 3rd floor there is a</B>
<BR><B>ghost who likes to walks the halls. She has heels on</B>
<BR><B>and usually does it at night. Another story is the</B>
<BR><B>ghost who likes to rearrange rooms. They think she was</B>
<BR><B>a neat freak and hates seeing things unorganized (like</B>
<BR><B>most college students are). Another ghost has been</B>
<BR><B>known to bang on walls at night. There is a old man</B>
<BR><B>janitor on the even sides of the 3rd and 4th floors</B>
<BR><B>who watches girls shower. Or they at least think he is</B>
<BR><B>watching them. I have even had that feeling of being</B>
<BR><B>watched in there.</B>
<BR><B>There is also the Lady in White who we only know was</B>
<BR><B>part of one of the more popular sororities and that</B>
<BR><B>she is sad. She is one of the only ghost you wont hear</B>
<BR><B>about. I am starting to think she is sacred or</B>
<BR><B>something because you know she is there but people</B>
<BR><B>leave her be.</B>
<BR><B>Then you have my very own ghost. I was excited to have</B>
<BR><B>one, but freaked out at the same time. I lived in MaWa</B>
<BR><B>#405. I liked the room, but I knew something was odd</B>
<BR><B>about it. Nothing really happened the first weeks, but</B>
<BR><B>them at night my roommate and I would hear noises and</B>
<BR><B>be a little freaked out. I remember one night where we</B>
<BR><B>were in out beds and we heard the sound of someone</B>
<BR><B>walking around in our room. I remember she calling out</B>
<BR><B>to me wondering if she was hearing things. She wasn t.</B>
<BR><B>It sounded like boots or something. I thought it was a</B>
<BR><B>man. Very heavy footed. I found that odd because it</B>
<BR><B>was a female dorm.</B>
<BR><B>We talked about it a little the&nbsp; next day, but them</B>
<BR><B>just dropped the subject. Over the next weeks we would</B>
<BR><B>hear the same thing. After awhile we just got used to</B>
<BR><B>it. Then I had this picture hanging up and it would</B>
<BR><B>randomly shake. I didn t think much of it, but I mean</B>
<BR><B>it would just start shaking and nothing was the cause.</B>
<BR><B>I figured it was just the ghost.</B>
<BR><B>So a few months passed and the usual happened. A few</B>
<BR><B>things were moved around. We started to smell a strong</B>
<BR><B>perform in the room from time to time. But nothing</B>
<BR><B>big. Then my roommate moved out. Nothing really</B>
<BR><B>happened for the few days I lived alone. I mean</B>
<BR><B>nothing. It was strange. Then I got a new roommate and</B>
<BR><B>that is when the weird stuff began. I moved her in and</B>
<BR><B>I didn t even tell her about the ghost because nothing</B>
<BR><B>had happened and I felt no need. Then one day while in</B>
<BR><B>the room the picture began to shake again. I realized</B>
<BR><B>she was back and I informed her. Weird thing was that</B>
<BR><B>she said she already knew. She could feel her.</B>
<BR><B>Apparently she came from a family who studied ghost</B>
<BR><B>and whatnot.</B>
<BR><B>Then the day she made her presence known came. I had</B>
<BR><B>left to go out of town with some friends. My roommate</B>
<BR><B>had never been in the room alone overnight before and</B>
<BR><B>I guess the ghost wanted to know who this new person</B>
<BR><B>was. So while I was gone, she toyed with my roommate.</B>
<BR><B>We have loft beds and while she was sleeping, the</B>
<BR><B>ghost was in my bed moving around and banging against</B>
<BR><B>her headboard. She it freaked her out a lot, but she</B>
<BR><B>remained calm. Then she said that the ghost was always</B>
<BR><B>in her closet roaming around. And under her side of</B>
<BR><B>the loft looking. I guess she was trying to understand</B>
<BR><B>her or something.</B>
<BR><B>So I come back and she explains to me what happened. I</B>
<BR><B>am really shocked because nothing had happened to that</B>
<BR><B>extent before. Then a few days passed and nothing</B>
<BR><B>happened again. Then one day while I was at my</B>
<BR><B>computer and she was on the floor painting, we started</B>
<BR><B>to smell a sweet perfume. It was the same smell from</B>
<BR><B>earlier and I explained that to my roommate. Then the</B>
<BR><B>sent got really strong and it was starting to make me</B>
<BR><B>a little ill. I remember my roommate was going to</B>
<BR><B>leave the room to smoke and her shoe was missing. It</B>
<BR><B>was odd because she just taken them off to paint. It</B>
<BR><B>was up on the dresser. The ghost was playing jokes.</B>
<BR><B>Over the next couple of weeks she moved a lot of</B>
<BR><B>things around. It was like she was trying to make her</B>
<BR><B>presence known to us. But the biggest surprised was</B>
<BR><B>the night we had a room draw. This is when you go and</B>
<BR><B>be in a room for a few hours to decide where you will</B>
<BR><B>live the next year. So we did that and by the time we</B>
<BR><B>got back it was really late and we where tired. My</B>
<BR><B>roomie got in her loft and I finished changing and hit</B>
<BR><B>the lights to go to bed. When I got I in my bed I</B>
<BR><B>turned around to face the closets and I saw on out</B>
<BR><B>closets two glowing names. I shrieked and jumped out</B>
<BR><B>the loft. My roomie didn t know what was wrong with me</B>
<BR><B>and as I walked up to the closets I realized that on</B>
<BR><B>my closet it had my roommate for next year s name and</B>
<BR><B>on her closet it had hers .</B>
<BR><B>You wouldn t imagine the fear I experienced. I mean I</B>
<BR><B>knew she was harmless, but that scared me like crazy.</B>
<BR><B>It was like she was saying&nbsp; I know what is happening.</B>
<BR><B>And I know who they are.&nbsp; So a little freaked out, we</B>
<BR><B>went and found friends and showed them their names. Of</B>
<BR><B>course they freaked out as well. So after a few hours</B>
<BR><B>we calmed down and went to sleep. The next day we</B>
<BR><B>examined it better. We had no idea what the substance</B>
<BR><B>was. It looked old, like it had been there forever.</B>
<BR><B>But it hadn t. It started to fade after a few days,</B>
<BR><B>but you could still see the names. It just didn t glow</B>
<BR><B>as much. Then eventually it stopped glowing. The names</B>
<BR><B>never went away though.</B>
<BR><B>Then we discovered who she was. One day I kept</B>
<BR><B>thinking of the name Katie. I didn t know why but I</B>
<BR><B>just had been. Then my roommate was like&nbsp; What do you</B>
<BR><B>think of the name Katie?&nbsp; and I looked at her like she</B>
<BR><B>was crazy because&nbsp; I had been thinking of it. I</B>
<BR><B>explained it to her and we got a bit weirded out.&nbsp; So</B>
<BR><B>we came to the conclusion her name was Katie. Then the</B>
<BR><B>roomie s sister called and while on the phone she</B>
<BR><B>asked her why someone was yelling the name&nbsp; Katie&nbsp; in</B>
<BR><B>the background? All I remember was her eyes and how</B>
<BR><B>she gestured for me to come to her. She then told me</B>
<BR><B>that her sister was one of those people who could</B>
<BR><B>communicate with the dead or whatever they were and</B>
<BR><B>that she said the name Katie. That was all the proof</B>
<BR><B>we needed. She then explained to her sister what we</B>
<BR><B>were feeling and she said she would come and view the</B>
<BR><B>room.</B>
<BR><B>Meanwhile we wrote Katie a note asking her if that was</B>
<BR><B>her name. We knew it was a long shot, but if she could</B>
<BR><B>write on the wall, why not paper? There was no answer</B>
<BR><B>of course though. But we knew anyways. So began to</B>
<BR><B>always include her in conversation. In the morning we</B>
<BR><B>would wish her a good day and at night we would say</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Night Katie . Things really calmed down after that.</B>
<BR><B>The only time things would happen was if we had a</B>
<BR><B>party in the room and even them only the names on the</B>
<BR><B>door would glow. And when we look up and see them all</B>
<BR><B>green everyone who tell her hi.</B>
<BR><B>Then her sister came and talked to Katie. My roommate</B>
<BR><B>said it was an interesting experience watching it take</B>
<BR><B>place. She explained to me that her name was in fact</B>
<BR><B>Katie. She was a freshman and lived in this room. She</B>
<BR><B>was a theater person (probably why she liked me and</B>
<BR><B>roomie because I worked with the theater majors and</B>
<BR><B>roomie was a theater major). She was a smoker like my</B>
<BR><B>roommate. She was big on fashion (why she looked</B>
<BR><B>through closets). She didn t care for my old roommate.</B>
<BR><B>She really liked me and my roommate. She wasn t happy</B>
<BR><B>when she was alive and she had died in my closet. And</B>
<BR><B>she flashed what seemed like a hanging, but her sister</B>
<BR><B>said that doesn t necessarily mean she killed herself.</B>
<BR><B>I personally think it had something to do with that</B>
<BR><B>manly figure that sometimes is in the room, but that</B>
<BR><B>is just me. And the glowing names? Her way of telling</B>
<BR><B>us she improves the new girls. And she knew. She was</B>
<BR><B>also sad we were leaving her.</B>
<BR><B>Things didn t happen much after that though. The green</B>
<BR><B>names lit up brightly the night before we left the</B>
<BR><B>dorm and we both wrote her a letter and my roommate</B>
<BR><B>left her one of her favorite toys (because she seemed</B>
<BR><B>to always play with it by moving it around or</B>
<BR><B>something) with a note to the school to not remove it.</B>
<BR><B>It was not a part of the room. We both plan to visit</B>
<BR><B>the new girls next semester to explain to them about</B>
<BR><B>Katie and too see if the names are still there. Well</B>
<BR><B>that was my experience with Katie and the other ghost</B>
<BR><B>from Emory &amp; Henry College.</B>

<P><B>I have two experiences to relate.&nbsp; The first is from roughly
19 years ago.&nbsp; The other from nearly 5 years ago.</B>
<BR><B>Experience 1, age ~10 yrs old:&nbsp; My father, brother, and uncles
used to play hiden-go-seek in abandoned farmhouses in northwest Missouri
at night.&nbsp; I suppose my father wanted his sons to not be afraid of
anything as adults.&nbsp; One house close to Brickyard Hill, in the remnants
of the town of Linden, was a favorite spot.&nbsp; The house had been large
for its era, two-storied, two sets of stairs, and the original owners were
the county judge, his wife, and 8? children (circa 1880s).</B>
<BR><B>All houses in the middle of nowhere are a little spooky.&nbsp; This
one was too, at first.&nbsp; After the initial exploration, without flashlights,
it was determined that there were no holes in the floors to fall through,
therefore it was safe to play hiden-go-seek.&nbsp; We had played in the
house a few times before my experience.&nbsp; One night (fall, between
8 and 10), I chose to hide in a bedroom closet up stairs.&nbsp; I heard
voices in the bedroom, so I was extra quiet.&nbsp; Normally, nobody spoke
during the game anyway, but I thought someone was caught and talking.&nbsp;
I listened very intently.&nbsp; I could hear indistinct voices of at least
a dozen people chatting, men and women, clothing rustling, mirth in the
voices.&nbsp; It sounded as though there was a social party happening.&nbsp;
I could tell the voices were coming from the room, so I looked into the
room.&nbsp; Nobody, no movement, nothing.&nbsp; The voices stopped as soon
as I looked out of the closet.&nbsp; I first thought that I had strained
so hard to listen for the seeker that I started to have a delusion.&nbsp;
Then, goosebumps raised, I high-tailed out if the closet and found my father
and related the story.&nbsp; He said that everybody else (five people)
heard the same thing while hiding in that closet.&nbsp; We continued a
few more games that night, but I avoided that closet.</B>
<BR><B>I returned to the house 8 years later during the day with my best
friend.&nbsp; Cattle had left inches on manure on the first floor and the
house was deteriorating fast.&nbsp; The house felt as empty as it had been
for the past decades.&nbsp; When I inspected the nearby chicken coop, I
found the skeletons of three chicken still in the roosts.&nbsp; In a land
where racoons, foxes, and coyotes are everywhere, no animal remains are
left untouched.&nbsp; These were.&nbsp; Very odd.&nbsp; The house was torn
down sometime within 5 years after that.&nbsp; End of experience 1.</B>
<BR><B>Experience 2, age 24:&nbsp; I live in Rolla, Missouri.&nbsp; An
abandoned house, now next to Lowe's, had piqued my interest to explore.&nbsp;
I walked to it one Sunday afternoon and explored the out buildings first,
then the house itself.&nbsp; The house is a one-storied, boarded over,
wood frame house.&nbsp; I was determined not to be stopped in my exploration
by plywood covered doors.&nbsp; I managed to peel the back door cover open
like a door, crawl under the broken lower panel on the back door and enter
the back of the house.&nbsp; The small entryway was spray painted blue,
royal blue.&nbsp; I unlocked the door and opened it to let more light in.&nbsp;
The back door was blue too.&nbsp; Strange.&nbsp; I have explored several
dozen abandoned houses in my life and none had blue entryways.&nbsp; The
entire house was pitch black even though it was bright outside.&nbsp; The
kitchen was to the right, so I let my eyes adjust and stepped into the
kitchen.&nbsp; That is when it came at me.&nbsp; As I stared into the blackness,
some of the light around the boarded windows trickled through.&nbsp; It
was still very dark, but something menacing was exerting itself towards
me.&nbsp; My vision rippled, like heat waves, so, hair standing on end
I quickly stepped back to the blue entryway.&nbsp; It didn't follow.&nbsp;
I was determined not to be chased away.&nbsp; I strapped on my belt of
faith (figuratively) and stepped into the kitchen again.&nbsp; It was waiting
for me.&nbsp; In the name of Jesus Christ, I bound it from harming me and
told it that Jesus had forgiven its sins and that God would have mercy
on It.&nbsp; It left.&nbsp; The house suddenly became brighter.&nbsp; I
could see the trash strewn on the floor, the peeling wall paper, I could
even read the pages from torn books.&nbsp; I explored the entire house.&nbsp;
Not much to see, except the 6 foot by 6 foot hole torn in the bedroom floor.&nbsp;
It looked like a hiding area or something.&nbsp; Strange.&nbsp; I left.&nbsp;
I returned a month later.&nbsp; The bad presence was definitely gone for
good.&nbsp; The house still stands behind the Autos of Yester Year museum.</B>

<P><B>Sara and her little girl</B>

<P><B>By: obstinatehottie8706@msn.com</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Well... what I'm about to tell you... isn't really like a story...
just a few things that have happened to me... Well... I'm 15 and I live
in Florida... and me, my mom, and my little sister have lived in the house
we are in right now for almost 2 years (December will be 2 years) nothing
really major has happened... just a couple encounters here and there...
mostly by me and my mom... I don’t think my sister has really seen or heard
anything like that... anyways... Well... the first time anything really
happened to me... I was in my room... and I was on the phone talking to
an old friend... reciting a song to her... well.. prior to that... I would
walk out of my room... and I left my TV on... and when I would walk back
in... my TV would be off... I thought nothing of it... I just brushed it
off... like if the cord came out of the outlet... well... I walked out
of my room again... with my TV on, again... and when I walked back in...
it was off again... now, it was a little bit freaky... well, when I was
reciting the song to my friend... my TV was turned off... I got up off
of my bed... and looked at the outlet and it was still plugged in... I
yelled to my mom and I told her what had happened... and I told her that
I was gonna be sleeping with her that night... of course... she laughed
at me... the good thing is... she believed me... because she sees "Sara"
and her little girl often... I have only seen the little girl once, but
I have never seen Sara... the only reason we know her name, is because
my mom is like a medium person... I guess that’s what its called... my
mom was on the love seat and I was sitting on a coffee table in the living
room and my mom was talking to Sara... it was freaky... Well... the other
encounter I have had with our ghostly friends... I was in our laundry room...
and I was folding some clothes that were in the dryer... well... I glanced
out of my laundry room... and when I did... I saw Sara's little girl standing
there... It didn’t really scare me all that much... I just looked at her
and I didn’t move or anything... she looked at me... and it looked to me
like she had her hands behind her back... and she was kind of leaned over
and she was smiling at me... she had long stringy blonde hair, that went
down to her stomach and she had a white shirt on that had flowers on it...
and like some type of lace on the bottom if it... then she just liked vanished
or something... the funny thing is... she looks like the little girl that
lives next door to me... and my sister plays with her all the time... At
first we weren't too sure why they were here... and I don’t know how my
mom found out... but she told me that Sara and her little girl lived here
like 20-30 years ago... and Sara's boyfriend at the time was abusive...
and I guess he was gonna kill her little girl... and something to the effect...
that Sara "killed" her little girl before her boyfriend could get to her...
and afterwards, Sara hung her self in my laundry room.</B>
<BR><B>Now, what I'm about to tell you... I don’t exactly know what they
are... anyways... on another site... they call them "orbs" they have pictures
of them... and they are little flashes of light... or something... they
look like little balls of light... like fire flies or something... Well...
I see them around my house like ALL the time... I have seen them in my
living room, down my hall way, in my mom's room, and like once in my room,
oh and the bathroom... 90% of the time they are normally really close to
my ceiling... anyways... if anyone knows anything about them... like what
they are... some one told me that its like an energy source, but I want
a second opinion... If anyone knows anything about them... please e-mail
me at ObstinateHottie8706@msn.com...</B>

<BR><B>ghost stories. Sandy and I got to looking at some of</B>
<BR><B>my old Christmas pictures from last year and figured</B>
<BR><B>out that it just wasn't family there that early</B>
<BR><B>Christmas morning. That we had about 3 unexpected</B>
<BR><B>guests. We see more of Elizabeth than we see of the</B>
<BR><B>others. She loves to mess around and hid things.</B>
<BR><B>1.A few instances: my dad was leaving for work and</B>
<BR><B>could not find his keys, he countinued to work with</B>
<BR><B>the spare and we were still looking. Dad comes home</B>
<BR><B>for dinner and we still can't find them. Next thing we</B>
<BR><B>know they are hanging on the hook swinging back in</B>
<BR><B>forth no one in the kitchen but mom, dad, and me.</B>
<BR><B>2. My dad's cell phone started to ring in the middle</B>
<BR><B>of the night he reaches for it and doesnt get it in</B>
<BR><B>time. So we go back to sleep and then about 20-25</B>
<BR><B>minutes later it rings again this time answering it no</B>
<BR><B>one was there. Then he had hit the miss calls button</B>
<BR><B>and it was my mothers cell phone calling, that was in</B>

<P><B>Teenage Suicide</B>

<P><B>By: ronweasley@hellokitty.com</B>

<P><B>Nothing weird ever happened to me but a friend's sister who lived
in Dublin, Ireland had a really creepy experience.&nbsp; Her name was Megan
and she lived in an apartment in Dublin city. Strange things began to occur
shortly after she moved in. One night, she left a large pile of books on
her bedside table. When she woke up, the whole pile of books was all over
her bed covering her. On another day, she was watching T.V. in her room
when suddenly the living room door began banging repeatedly for at least
a minute. The creepiest happening at the house was the crying she heard
at night. She described it as a male voice. And it was always in her room.
Then one evening she was walking home with a new friend who had lived in
the area for many years. When her neighbour asked her which house she lived
in and Megan told her, she seemed very nervous. She told Megan that ten
years ago, a teenage boy had committed suicide in that house and since
that everyone thinks that house is strange. Curious, Megan asked what room
the boy was found dead in. Her neighbour pointed to the second window to
the right which, to Megans surprise, was Megans room, the room where all
the strange things occured...</B>

<BR><B>The Candystore Man</B>

<P><B>By: Carlo.Schoeters@pandora.be</B>

<P><B>Hi I'm Sven I'm from Belgium, so don't expect to much from my English,
but I just wanted to share my story with you people at the Shadowlands.</B>
<BR><B>The story I'm about to tell was only confirmed by me and my Dad.</B>
<BR><B>It was a long time ago, let's say about 12 years and I'm 20 right
now.</B>
<BR><B>12 years ago me and my family moved from a nice modern house to
a much older place situated in the centre of Turnhout wich is the capital
city of Antwerp-Kempen.</B>
<BR><B>It was a large house with 4 floors.On the first floor we had a Candystore
and behind that there was our livingroom,kitchen,garden etc....</B>
<BR><B>My brother and I had a room on the 3th floor and my sister had her
own room on the 4th floor.On the second floor there was my Mom and Dads
room and the TV-Room.The entire staircase was made out of wood,realy old
wood.</B>
<BR><B>I'l just start now with my dad's first ghostly experi&euml;nce.</B>
<BR><B>We had a litle brown puppy-dog called 'itte',it was a very calm
and shy dog.But after a few days when we moved in the house Itte became
more like a very nervous dog and she wouldn't sit still for just one minute.</B>
<BR><B>One night while we were in bed I could here our dog bark and run
around our house, I didn't go downstairs to see what's goin on cause I
was just a kid and was very scared in such a big house.Even when I heard
the backdoor from the garden goin' open I didn't moved a muscle.Itte was
still barking and runnin' around, and then a noticed she was outside and
it became awfully quiet.But I still didn't move a muscle and eventualy
I fell asleep.The morning after my dad found our dog floathing in our swimming
pool,she drowned.I told my story to my dad and he said he believed me.</B>
<BR><B>A few months after our dog died we bought a cat,we called her PIXIE.Same
thing happened to Pixie,she became very agresive etc....but she didn't
die.</B>
<BR><B>After a wile it all cooled down and nothing happened for like 3
months.Till one day I was playing on the 3th floor with some He-Man dolls
and He-Man accidently fell down to the first floor, I could see him fall
down and smack down to the ground.</B>
<BR><B>I ran downstairs to get him back but the only thing I could find
was his head.We never found He-Mans body ever again for as long as we lived
there.</B>
<BR><B>A few weeks after that,again while we were in bed,I could here my
father woke up and ran up the stairs and he yelled:"Get back in bed!!!!"
" Who came out of his bed!!!" I know I didn't cause he woke me up and my
brother was snoring.The morning after everyone was asking my father why
he was yelling up the stairs? Nobody came out of his bed that night, but
my father could here someone up the stairs.</B>
<BR><B>My father was right,after the story my father told to me, I stayed
up late on purpose.There were nights I never heard a thing but some night
I did hear footsteps.And as a litle kid...that is very scary.</B>
<BR><B>Nobody heard those footsteps,only my father and I.Maybe the rest
of the family heard those footsteps too but they never talked about it.</B>
<BR><B>And than the last thing that happened was when I was holding our
new cat,I was just walking throught the house holding the cat while she
was sleeping and suddenly she woke up and became very agressive.She jumped
out of my arms leaving me some scares on my chest and my face.We didn't
saw Pixie for like two days till she finaly came back.</B>
<BR><B>That's my story,we never saw any shades or somthing like that but
my dad and I knew there was somthing not right about that house so after
2 years we moved out.</B>

<BR><B>The House on Barham !</B>

<P><B>By: newdawndream@webtv.net</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>&nbsp; When my family and i were moving in the house on Barham in
Santa Rosa,</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Ca.The first day we&nbsp; started painting the house inside
and my brother</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; had a flash light that plugged in a outlit. He put it on
his truck and</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; later that night around 8 P.M. he went to get it. And it
was gone, we</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; looked all over the house and couldn't find it. The next
morning we</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; still couldn't find it so he said it might show up later.
The 4th night</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; my family moved in the house and next moring i found it in
the kitchen.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Now no one put it on the counter and then things started
dissappering.A</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; hair brush and a glass and other little things. And always
a week or</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; later we will find these things again in the same place that
we put</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; them. Then one day my daughter was taping some tapes in the
room in the</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; back that was builded on the house and when she got through
she ask me</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; to listen to the tape. On it was "Dolly Parton" singing "Rocking
Chairs</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Rocking Babys" but there was another voice on it saying "Linda"
but like</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; a whisper.Linda was the lady that moved out of the house
before we moved</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; in it.My daughter got frighten a little, she was 16 yrs.
at this time.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; And moved out of the room , so i gave it to my youngest son
whch was 9</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; yrs. at the time.The weeks went by and one night i heard
him whimper in</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; his sleep. I was in the bedroom in the front of the house
and you had to</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; walk through the front room and through the kitchen and the
little hall</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; way pass the bath room to get to his room.This is where the
room was</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; bulded on to the house.When i got to the little hall way
i froze and my</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; hair stood up as a tingle ran up my neck. There on his bed
was a man in</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; a&nbsp; black suit,a split long jacket and a top hat on his
head, a beard and</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; mustache. He was patting my son on the back sitting on the
edge of the</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; bed.When he looked at me he got up and just walked away toward
the back</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; door.I finally got nerve enough to go into the room and there
was no</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; one. The doors where still locked from the inside of the
house.After</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; this we got used of seeing the ghost walking around the house
but didn't</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; see him all the time. Some one wanted me to smoke the house
with sage</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; but i didn't what to do it.&nbsp; We stayed in the house
for 5 yrs. and then</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; we moved. When i found out the house was being rented again
the people</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; stayed on 5 months then moved then the house was up for sale
and some</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; one bought it but they to didn't stay long and now its empty
again and i</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; wished i was back there because i missed the ghost and my
kids does</B>

<P><B>On Sunday July 6th, 2003 at 4:00 a.m. I noticed that we</B>
<BR><B>had no power.&nbsp; I got out of bed and went to the front</B>
<BR><B>door to look out to window to see if anyone else had</B>
<BR><B>power.&nbsp; No one did.&nbsp; I looked over to the left and</B>
<BR><B>noticed what appeared to be an old woman walking down</B>
<BR><B>the sidewalk.&nbsp; As she got closer to me I noticed that I</B>
<BR><B>could not see a face or distinguish arms from the rest</B>
<BR><B>of her body.&nbsp; As she walked down the sidewalk I noticed</B>
<BR><B>that she would fade slightly and then re-appear.&nbsp; She</B>
<BR><B>continued walking to the driveway that is 2 houses away</B>
<BR><B>from mine.&nbsp; From my front door I can see more than half</B>
<BR><B>way up the drive way.&nbsp; The woman turned and walked up</B>
<BR><B>that driveway but disappeared before she got to the</B>
<BR><B>tree that blocks my vision from the rest of the</B>
<BR><B>driveway.&nbsp; I was entirely creeped out.&nbsp; When I told my</B>
<BR><B>mom at 6 a.m. of my sighting she became creeped out too</B>
<BR><B>and had chills.&nbsp; Everyone I have told so far has</B>

<P><B>By: an_dariel@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>Shadowlands is one of the best ghost story sites I have ever come
across. Thank you for being here.</B>
<BR><B>The Story: This happened just a few days ago. I had come home and
decided to get on my computer to type some letters up when I remembered
that I had been listening to music on my PC earlier in the day and that
the volume was set to high.&nbsp; I have a start-up sound that plays so
I disconnected my speakers from the PC so that this loud sound would not
disturb anyone else in my home.&nbsp; I was on my PC for about 20 minutes
then I got a phone call and went to lie down on my bed while I talked.&nbsp;
About ten minutes into my conversation a loud moaning/breathing sound came
from my computer speakers. I jumped out of bed and rushed over to my PC
to find out what was going on.&nbsp; I tried to lower to the volume on
the PC but that did not work so I forced shut down the PC and that stopped
the sound.&nbsp; At this point I had completely forgotten that I had unplugged
the speakers from my PC.&nbsp; I got off the phone and resumed my typing.
A short while I decided to listen to some music but I could not hear any
sound coming form the speakers. After playing with the settings on my PC
I checked the cord from the speakers to the PC and discovered it was unplugged.&nbsp;
At this point I freaked out a little bit.&nbsp; I can t find any explanation
for what I heard.&nbsp; If anyone has experienced anything similar please
contact me.</B>

<BR><B>Witches Circle</B>

<P><B>By: mscole@nps.navy.mil</B>

<P><B>Me and my best friend sarah were having a night on the town. We were
skate boarding around Monterey, (CA). We eventually ran into our friend
Adam. We began to wonder around having a fun time. He told us about this
place that was located up in the woods. Where we live is in a bay, its
reallly buitiful and it is surrounded with trees and woods that cover many
giant hills. We started walking to these woods and he began to tell us
of what we were about to encounter. Its called.. The whitches circle. Adam
told us of how he went there with his friends and found old ladies dressed
in black hiding around in the trees. After all the old women randomly dissapeared
they went deeper in the woods towards the circle. When they got there they
saw a tarp that looked like it had a body under it. They began throwing
rocks at it and poking it with sticks. The "thing" jumped up and scared
the ---- outa them. They said it looked like a pink creature. Anyways,
back to our adventure. It was a long walk from where we were. It look like
2 hours to get to the woods. When u enter you willl have to hop into the
woods that are beside this road. When u get in, u feel totally lost. You
will eventually see a small path. We walked on it clinging to eachother
but joking freely. We still had our skate boards with us. It was a hassle
to bring them. After walking a long time u will see a dusty road. On the
road you have a veiw of the entire monterey bay. It was brightly lit, (it
was night time about 12:something). THis is where the "fun begins". The
road was swerving and was getting steap. From where we were at this point,
we could see a HUGE house with balconies all over it. Sarah and Adam were
clingy to eachother so i just stuck alone for a while. Sarah Suddenly started
running and grabbed onto adam and they sped away from me. I didnt think
much of it, i thought it was a cute way to flirt. I looked up at this house
and on one of the balconies was this dancing person that looked like it
was covered in a white sheet. I didnt think much of it but i knew i saw
something so i ran to catch up with them. The road came to an end and we
started going down hill. On this path, to your right was a steap canyon.
Looking straight to your right, you can see another wall kind of caging
you in. It had a face inprint on it. We all noticed, but for some reason
sarah did want to take notice to anything, she was just looking at her
feet. Adam and i clearly saw the face and thought it was amusing. After
a long walk down, we finally reach the bottom of the canyon. Right when
u get to the bottom you will turn right around and walk the same distance
u jsut walked only now ur at the bottom of the canyon near the rock that
has a face on it. We began to notice stacks of small rocks placed every
where. We would continue to see these throught our walk. By this time we
were in almost pitch black and the light barely came through the trees.&nbsp;
kept looking back to see this Black beam following us as we walked. We
walked further and sarah was getting more and more tense as we went. Adam
was in good spirits and so was i. I was looking off into the trees like
an idiot trying to notice if anything was hiding in them. I glanced through
this hole in the trees and saw the face of a silvery girl. I quickly looked
away and told them i just saw something and i wasnt gonna say what it was
till we were out. We then made an agreement to do that so we wouldnt scare
eachother. We were close, i could see the enterance. As we came to it Adam
said he just saw some thing as well. We were scared and there was no turning
back, we had to go all the way. When u enter its like a little path connected
to this giant circle opening of the trees and the canyon. Basically its
like the end of a block of houses with a circle turn around area. Its huge
and u felt trapped with the massive stone walls around u. In the witches
circle, its a giant swirl, i was expecting a pentagram but i guess thats
just sterio type. In the center where the swirl ended was a giant stack
of rocks. To your right was an alter that was a block made of rock it had
melted wax and crushed leaves all over it. We felt a little safe in there,
but then again we were trapped. We felt the urge to go. On the way back
I continued to see the black beam still following us. To make the story
shorter we exited that hellish place and fell down a hill and landed on
the street we started on. We hopped on the skateboards and skated down
a hill. We stopped and began to tell what we had seen. I went first. I
told them that on the way I saw a girls face. Right when I said that, Sarah
looked at me with the weirdest look on her face. He told us that this girl
who was dressed with cave woman looking clothes had been following us the
whole way. Adam said that at the entrance to the witches circle he saw
a goat headed man standing atop part of the canyon wall. It wasn't until
I got to sarahs house that I realized that I saw something else. I told
sarah about the sheet looking man, she was in shock. I told her that's
why I thought she ran away with adam, she said nope, that girl was right
next to me. We took out pieces of paper and we both drew the girl we saw.
It was exact resemblance. I told her that when I saw the girl she was a
silverfish blue. She said that the girl was a silver except for one time
when she saw the girl with a really angry face. So I got freaked out because
I thought the girl didn't like me.</B>
<BR><B>About a week later we decided to take our friend Tia to experience
it again. When we began to walk there we went through the same obstacles.
On the path that descends to the bottom of the canyon, me and Tia knew
we saw something. WE KNEW IT. I saw a woman sitting on the branch of a
tree with a flowing dress dangling from it. Tia stopped in her tracks.
I said "Does it have a dress?" and she immediately replied "Ohhhhh.. yes"
and we turned right around in our tracks , that's when we knew we saw a
ghost. On the way back. I saw this cat woman looking figure running through
the trees. Right then we ran all the way back.</B>
<BR><B>There was one other time we went and the circle had been destroyed.
It made us feel sadness for some reason. That was not my first or last
encounter. Contact me if you feel you need to please.</B>

<P><B>13 Steps</B>

<P><B>By: conniem@cedar-rapids.net</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have always had a facination with ghosts and the paranormal
but it was only in watching movies,surfing websites, and hearing experiences
from others and that was about it until recently when I had my own experience
this was 3 nights ago.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have often heard and read stories about Pleasent
Ridge cemetary (A.K.A. 13 steps), just outside of Palo, Iowa.To Sum up
the bulk of what I've heard the nickname 13 steps comes from people saying
that there are 13 steps leading up into the cemetary at night but if you
go in the daytime there are only 12. The bulk of the rest of the stories
involve shadows, Strange sounds, and the occasional alleged "ghost" sightings.
The are all alot of heresay; I'm not saying they are true, yet I'm not
saying they're false where the people would be lieing. My only point on
this is: I've heard alot,read alot, but until the other night I had never
been there so I could not personally substantiate any imformation...Until
now!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend Nic, his girlfriend Tammy,and I decided to
pay a visit to 13 Steps on the premise that I had never been there. When
We got there it was about 11 pm. I admit it, it was after the 10:30PM Cutoff,and
nobody was supposed to up there.We got out under a bright full moon with
only a couple of clouds in sky. I found it kind of strange that the clouds
were almost centered over the cemetary and that the moon was so bright
it was almost like daytime with a few clouds&nbsp; over the sun. We walked
up the steps into the cemetary. I counted them quite easily that night
there were 13 no question. After getting into the cemetary we began to
look around at the different years on the tombstones. The oldest ones that
I found were middle 1850's, so I could&nbsp; tell this was a very old place.It
was actually a very relaxing serene experience walking around there that
night. It wasn't spooky in the slightest in fact quite peaceful. That was
until the mosquitoes started biting. We've had quite a problem with them
in Iowa this year they'll eat you alive around here, figuratively speeking.
Nic then made a comment that he must be tasting pretty good to them and
he was ready to go back down to the car. Tammy and I followed him back
to the car where we diced to sit for a little while and enjoy the breeze
along with the peace and quiet.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A short while later two cars pulled in. We could
tell right away they weren't anbody to</B>
<BR><B>worry about. They parked about 35 40 feet away from us parked in
the same way we were.They were 4 teenagers, two couples, Probably here
to find a makeout spot. They got out of their cars with flashlights and
headed down a path along the side of the hill that the cemetary is perched
on and proceeded up the side the hill into the cemetary. They almost seemed
to be avoiding climbing the stairs.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as they were getting into the cemetary a truck
pulls up the hill, into the parking lot,</B>
<BR><B>and in front of our car blocking us in. Our hearts sank when we
saw the DNR logo on the side.&nbsp; This was his territory and he could
ticket us or if he wanted to be a jerk have us ran off to jail. The DNR
puts his truck into the park and gets out letting the door hang open so
his dome light can put a little light on us. We were backed into our parking
spot so i had a perfect view in the passenger seat with Nic in the drivers
seat. The DNR walks upto Nic's and begins to play&nbsp; 20 questions: Are
we up here drinking doing dope LA DE DA...So, finally he asks us just what
we were doing up here. Tammy responds that we were looking for the ghost.
"Ghosts, huh",he asks, "seen anything?" Just then I watched in amazement
as his trucks automatic shifter on the steering collumn goes down into
drive and the truck pulls forward as well as starts turning toward the
other two cars. The DNR ran after his truck jumps in and puts it back in
park. Missing the other two cars by only a few feet.Then he told us to
just go and not let him catch us up there again after hours. We gladly
left grateful for not being in any trouble&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let met clarify
some things: Automatic transmissions do not just fall out of gear, manuals&nbsp;
possibly but not an automatic.I know I saw him put the truck in park,so
The shifter had to come&nbsp; down 3 clicks to get to drive from park.
Reverse would cause the truck to go backwards as well as nuetral since
he was parked going slightly uphill. So,I know the truck was in park and
it ended&nbsp; up in drive.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; My only explanation is something paranormal maybe a
friendly ghost that saw us in trouble that knew we were in the cemetary
being respectful. If it was a ghost I know it didn't mean anyone harm do
to the fact that nobody was in any of the vehicle that could have collided.
As far as any other explanations go they escape me you whomever is reading
this must draw your own conclusions. I on the other hand now believe in
ghosts.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; And finally I swear to you the reader that what you just
read is absolutely true and I have many witnesses to back it up including
a DNR.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;Auschwitz</B>

<P><B>By: g.bromfield@ntlworld.com</B>

<P><B>I visited this notorious place last year 2002. It is kept so intact
it is uncanny - as though the German guards have just left the place!</B>
<BR><B>With our English speaking guide we traipsed around the various barracks
and into the yard where the prisoners had been shot. The wooden posts to
which the hapless prisoners were tied still stand.As the guide finished
her talk on this site the group moved off, I held back and touched one
of these posts. I remember saying "God Bless" for the unfortunates who
had met their deaths at this particular spot. Immediatetly a cold wind
rushed up and surrounded me, I stress that it was a gloriously&nbsp; still&nbsp;
Polish summers day at the time. No one else seemed to notice this wind
and no dust from the site was disturbed!</B>
<BR><B>I called to the friend I was holidaying with and broke out of this
area of coldness.I asked him if he witnessed this odd event but he hadn"t.</B>
<BR><B>I could not believe what had happened and can only put it down to
possibly trapped souls at that murder post.</B>
<BR><B>It would be interesting if any other visitors to that place have
had similar experiences.</B>

<P><B>By: woodchuk@bledsoe.net</B>

<P><B>I was at my grandmas house and me and my cousin were up late watching
t.v.&nbsp; My grandpa was sleeping.&nbsp; We heard a sound from the backroom
like something hit the washing machine.&nbsp; At the time there was no
animals in the house to make this noise.&nbsp; Also a woman staying a the
house said she saw a woman come from the backroom and go to the living
room and then down the hallway to my grandma and grandpas room.&nbsp; This
room where she went happened to be where my grandma died about 13 years
ago.&nbsp; My cousin has said covers have been pulled over him when he
was sleeping.&nbsp; My cousin also seen a black dog in the kitchen.&nbsp;
My grandpa doesn't own a black dog.&nbsp; He used to but it died, it is

<P><B>Ghost Movie</B>

<P><B>By: LCstealth77@aol.com</B>

<P><B>My friends and I went on a ghost trail. For fun, we made a scary
movie.&nbsp; When we got to our house we weren't going to watch it because
it was very short, but we stuck the wrong movie in and we ended up watching
it anyway.&nbsp; When the movie started, it was boring, (as we thought
it&nbsp; was going to be)&nbsp; but after a few moments, we heard a voice
on the movie and couldnt figure out which one of us it was talking.&nbsp;
It was a low scratchy male voice that kept sayin, "Help me, I am laying
on the rock over here."&nbsp; Continuously it kept on saying it.&nbsp;
When we were making the movie at the ghost walk, we didnt hear any voice,
it only was heard on the movie that was made. We all jumped out of our
seats when we heard the ghostly male voice.</B>

<BR><B>Guardian Angel</B>

<P><B>By: heather.cooper.jwu2@statefarm.com</B>

<P><B>I am a 27-year-old female.&nbsp; This is one of my earliest memories.&nbsp;
I was 4 years old at the time of the occurrence.&nbsp; My cousin, who was
5, and I were arguing over whether I could actually swim or not.&nbsp;
We were at a park with a little marina.&nbsp; She kept pushing me, pretending
to throw me in to see if I could really swim or not.</B>
<BR><B>One time, she pushed a little to hard and I lost my footing and
fell off the dock into the water.&nbsp; I could not swim.&nbsp; The water
was probably a good 6 feet or so.&nbsp; I kept going under, I could hear
my cousin screaming for help.&nbsp; The more I struggled the more tired
I became.&nbsp; Somehow I drifted close enough to the dock to grab onto
one of the slimy boards underneath.&nbsp; I felt two strong hands grab
me under the arms and pull me out of the water.&nbsp; I remember a young
man, clean-shaven, with a baseball cap on.</B>
<BR><B>When I looked away from him, I saw my frantic mother running about
a foot or two away.&nbsp; When I pointed to the man who pulled me out,
he had vanished.&nbsp; Only my cousin and I saw the kind person who helped
me that day.&nbsp; We still discuss it sometimes.&nbsp; My mother never
saw him, but believes it was divine intervention.</B>

<BR><B>Haunted House</B>

<P><B>By: cldpenny@earthlink.net</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>I lived in a small one bedroom home in Thompsonville, IL with my
husband who lived there for about a year before I moved in with him.&nbsp;
A man hung himself in the basement.&nbsp; When I moved in strange things
began to happen.&nbsp; I would have horrible nightmares in that house all
the time mostly about someone chasing me with a knife.&nbsp; My husband
had a dream one night that someone shot him with a shotgun and it woke
him up and me..&nbsp; One night while we were sleeping we heard a loud
crashing noise that sounded like someone had dropped a big picture window.&nbsp;
My husband went outside and looked around the entire house there was no
glass to be found anywhere.&nbsp; My sister, husband and children came
and stayed with us for the weekend.&nbsp; My sister had dreams that someone
was trying to take her children and my brother-in law had such horrible
dreams which he would not talk about said he would never stay in our house
again.&nbsp; My mom came and stayed with us and she seen a tall man standing
in the kitchen, she said our dog looked right at him and growled and the
man disappeared.&nbsp; My little brother-in law is a diabetic and I made
sugarless chocolate cookies for him and wrapped them in plastic wrap on
a plate to bring to him the next day.&nbsp; When we got up the next day
all the cookies were gone and the plastic wrap was still on the plate but
had looked like someone had scooped the cookies from underneath the wrap.
When we had our first baby we moved out into a bigger house, and rented
the house.&nbsp; The girl that lived there after us moved out because of
the bad dreams and strange things that would happen while she lived there.&nbsp;
When she would leave for work she would make sure everything was off, when
she would come home at night her TV, radio all the lights in the house
would be on.&nbsp; When we moved out I quit having bad dreams.&nbsp; I
believe that the man that hung himself was haunting that house.&nbsp; The
house has been knocked down and someone has put a modular home on the property.</B>

<P><B>Haunted Shoney's of Gainesville Ga.</B>

<P><B>By: le-2428@charter.net</B>

<P><B>Dave I've been visiting your website for some years,I usually click
on every link you have on your website,well one night as I was looking
at the listing of haunted places index I noticed that you have Gainesville
Ga. right where I live! I couldn't believe it, of coarse you have Brenau
in Gainesville Ga. which is this town,let me tell you I had the fortune
to work with a Brenau student which she confirmed the stories about the
hauntings that go around in the theatre and in the dorm rooms,well that's
not why I'm writing to you about, it's about the Gainesville Shoney's restaurant
that you have in your index,that's right here in Georgia.</B>
<BR><B>Well let me continue with my testimony,it was 10 years ago while
I was working for 2.13+ tips as a waiter,during those years that Shoney's
was one of the dominant restaurants here In Gainesville every weekend and
holidays the restaurant would be packed with customers and we would be
busy all the time making allot of tips it was amazing,I also became good
friends with our supervisor I'm not going to mention her name because I
haven't asked for her permission to use her name in this true life paranormal
event, it came one weekend night when I was working late into the morning
hour when Shoney would closed it's doors at 1 a.m. when I met this 5'9
husky African-American man&nbsp; walking very fast around the back bar
of the restaurant pouring bleach onto the floor as to break away the coffee,carbonated
water, tea and so on that spilled on the floor during the working hours
of the restaurant, as he was going about his business with his cleaning
duties I noticed that he was doing it in a bad mood,I thought : I wonder
what's he's problem? I never bother to ask him if he was o.k. well one
night I think I asked my friend the supervisor what was bothering Baker(that
was what we used to call him but his full name was James Baker) she mention
that Baker was having marital problems,the only thing that I thought was
: poor guy.</B>
<BR><B>It came a couple of years later that I had found my self another
job so I left shoney's restaurant,I hade found out that Shoney's was not
doing so well that they were going to close it's restaurant's doors for
good it tried to stay afloat but with no avail,so the day came when Shoney's
restaurant was no more,an Asian business man had bought the building and
it turned it into a Chinese buffet restaurant which it still stands and
it still open,well one day I bumped into my friend the one that used to
be my supervisor in Shoney's , I asked her how she was and we started to
talk about those years working in Shoney's when the subject about Baker
came up : so what happened to Baker( I asked) well he's dead ( my friend
replied)oh man that's sad( I said).my friend continued onto telling me
that during those years that Baker was working with us in Shoney's it wasn't
that he had marital problems well not exactly,it was because his wife had
passed away and Baker was finding it hard to deal with the death of his
wife,I tell you Dave I was there I used to work with him you could see
it in his eyes that something was wrong although I didn't bother to talk
to him directly you could even feel it,my friend the supervisor finally
told me that Baker had committed suicide in the Shoney's men's bathroom,I
asked my friend how did she knew this, she said :I was there,I was the
one who found his body lying in a pool of blood,my god I have never seen
so much blood,he shot himself in the chest on his wife's death anniversary.</B>
<BR><B>My friend added after his death one night while Shoney's was still
open they were preparing to close that while she was still working in Shoney's
in her office,one of the dish washer guys swore to my friend the supervisor
that he saw Baker standing right next to my friend,she ended the conversation
by telling me Baker while still being alive every night after closing the
restaurant Baker would stand right next to my friend in her office every
night to see if she needed anything so he could go about his bussiness
in clean the backbar and now it seems that Baker has made his residency
there where Shoney's used to be and now is a Chinese buffett restaurant
with paranormal activity.</B>
<BR><B>This last weekend July the 10 of 2003 I whent to pay a visit, to
eat at the new Chinese restaurant and to take pictures with my camera and
came out with one interesting picture I will post it to your photo section
and see what you thing it seems that they are two orbs passing by on top
of one of my kids head.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp; James G. Wallace</B>

<P><B>By: Stephenpkelly@att.net</B>

<P><B>I guess I will start at the beginning, that' always a good place.
I was taking a short cut through the cemetery in Queens, New York this
one stormy day. New York was having one of it's ice storms and everything
was covered with ice. I came around a turn and headed down hill when I
saw a black dog covered with ice and shaking. I felt sorry for him and
headed out to the nearest store to buy him a couple of cans of dog food.
I came back the next day to see how he was doing and I met some of the
grave diggers. I knew some of them from the area and they told me that
they feed the dog ( His name was Apple I learned that day ) and he is always
looking for a hand out. Because I live near by I would go over and see
Apple on the weekends and feed him. This became a thing because I can't
have dogs. Well as the weeks pasted I found that all I had to do was call
his name and he would come running. I would sit outside this crypt and
brush Apple. One day I had this feeling to look inside the tomb and there
was a surprise. One of the people inside had died on my birthday April
13, 1944. This started me on a mission that still goes on to this day.
You see, this all happened over 25 years ago.</B>
<BR><B>The name on the crypt was Wallace. The man as I learned after many
years was James Wallace. His father is also with him as is his mother Sarah.
But it was James Jr. who died on my birthday. I did a search of the grave
which was the first of many things strange. As I was reading the report
sent by the cemetery I noticed that the original grave where he was buried
was in section 2 and was purchased on the very day I requested the search.
October 24, 1862. The crypt was built in 1890. I should mention that James
was born on December 12, 1859 and Died on April 13, 1887.</B>
<BR><B>I wanted to know the cause of death.</B>
<BR><B>I next when to the New York Pubic library in Manhattan were I knew
the old papers are on file. I found the obituary for James in the New York
Times. I said that he had died in Jacksonville, Fl.&nbsp; There was no
cause of death. I tried St. Patrick on 5th Avenue were the funeral was
held to no avail.</B>
<BR><B>Let's remember, I did this over a period of years always keeping
my eyes open for any lead concerning James. It became a ritual on the weekends
even after Apple pasted. I still go there, it may seem strange to other
people put I know James watches over me. I never hear voices or see apparitions.
This is one of the reasons only a very few special friends know this story.</B>
<BR><B>There are times when things don't seem to be going right, and I
go to the hill ( where the crypt is located ) and say a couple of prays
and things seem to work out.</B>
<BR><B>There are other times when my hair stands on end.</B>
<BR><B>One time I was sitting out side and I had this over whelming feeling
that James was trying to tell me something. I actually said, James I know
you want something but I don't know what it is. As I looked inside I noticed
that his father was born on April 6, and it was the end of March. I said,
I guess you want me to light a candle for your father. And I left it at
that.</B>
<BR><B>On April 6, I somehow remembered about the promise I made. At lunch
time I when to the local church where I worked. If you were ever in New
York you know how big the churches are. This one has three sets of large
oak doors. I when in and a mass was going on. I didn't want to walk down
to the candles so I asked a clerk to light the candle for&nbsp; me. I gave
him the money and left.</B>
<BR><B>As I was on my way to the subway to go home I looked across the
street and there was all three sets of doors to the church wide open. Something
I never saw. I could almost hear James saying " You have to light the candle
yourself ". So I when in the church and there was a statue of Saint Patrick,
was my fathers favorite saint. I light the candle and said a pray. I said
I hope this is what you wanted James and headed downtown to meet my wife.</B>
<BR><B>As I came up the stairs from the subway my wife was waiting. She
looked at me and said," Steve, I have to tell you something.". As she said
that I felt James presence.</B>
<BR><B>I still get a chill when ever I think of this day. I told her not
to tell me until we got home. She again said, it's important. Unknow to
her I already knew. Without anyone calling me on the job. Or any other
contact, James was telling me that my father had past away.</B>
<BR><B>James died on my brithday and my father died on his fathers brithday.</B>
<BR><B>This is a true story, though not complete because I still go to
the hill</B>
<BR><B>I did find the cause of death, James died in Duval county and was
taken to Jacksonville were he died from fever contacted during a hunting
trip in the Everglades.</B>
<BR><B>There are other events but I don't think James wants to share them
right now.</B>

<P><B>Lockwolde</B>

<P><B>By: Dannyattaway@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>Back when I was a teenager(around 1985)me and a friend of mine got
off work from a fast food restaurant we were both working at.We were on
our way home when we decided to ride around a little.It was about 2am and
we decided to ride through a new subdivision road that had just been cut.The
name of the subdivision was to be called Lockwolde and went in between
two old lakes that had been there a long time.We entered the new cut road
and started up and over the hill which led to the lakes.As we were almost
to the bottom of the hill the headlights started illuminating a figure
standing in between the lakes.It did not look ghostly at all.It was a heavyset
man wearing a white shirt and black dress pants,he was looking down and
kicking at the newly spread gravel.as our lights shined on him more I remarked
to my friend "who would be walking around out here at this time of night"before
I could finish he looked up at us in a startled way and took off running
towards the smaller lake.when he reached the edge of the lake he seemed
to vanish .Our headlights were directly on him and he had nowhere to go
but into the lake yet there was no splash.He seemed to fade away before
he went into the lake,no ripples in the water,no sound.I have never felt
cold chill's like that before.My friend wasted no time in turning his truck
around and getting out of there in a frenzy.I could'nt say anything but
"Did you see that".When we got to my house I asked him what he had just
seen to make sure he saw the same thing I had.His reply was "where the
hell did he go".he described the same thing I had witnessed.A week later
my cousin wanted to ride back down there to see where this had happened.When
we arrived at the same spot his headlights went out,he tried to wiggle
his headlight switch to make them come on again but it did not work.I told
him we needed to get out of there so he turned around and we made our way
out .as we started back up the hill the lights came back on.I don't know
any explanation for what happened at lockwolde but I have never went back.This
happened in the town of centerville georgia</B>

<P><B>I live close to Moody Lane in Francesville, IN.&nbsp; One night after
coming home from Indiana Beach my friends and I went to Moody Lane.&nbsp;
We all piled in my car and headed to Moody Lane when you get close to Moody
Lane you will see a graveyard on the left hand side of the road before
for you turn on Moody Lane slow down at the graveyard and look at the gate
it will be open.&nbsp; We turned onto Moody Lane and drove halfway down
the lane and flashed the car lights 3 times. All of the sudden the strange
light comes toward us, afterward we turned to car around and headed back
the way we had came slowing down at the graveyard only to see that the
graveyard gate that was open was know closed.&nbsp; There is nothing that
can explain what happened that night, but I do believe in ghost stories
now.</B>

<P><B>By: RhineridgeCollie@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>My Mother's house was built in 1830 and is approximately one block
from Lake Michigan. When we lived there we had all kinds of activity.</B>
<BR><B>A lot of poltergeist activity, plus floating mists, plus cold spots,
and voices.</B>
<BR><B>An Indian appeared to me at the bottom the steps to the front hallway.
He told me, that they meant no harm to me, but my father and ex-husband
were constantly bothered by cold spots, slaps in the face, and other physical
attacks. (Both my father and my ex were abusive to me.)</B>
<BR><B>One day I came to see my Mother, and I called out and she didn't
answer, so I thought she was in the basement doing wash. I started toward
the steps, and was literally stopped in my tracks. Then every hair on my
body stood at attention, and I was told to leave. I ran. I was never so
terrified. Even after all the other things that happened in the house I
had never been that afraid. The basement always was a haunted place. No
one liked to go down there alone.</B>
<BR><B>I have lots of other stories, but they would make a book. If you
would like to know about them you can email me and get my cell phone number.</B>

<BR><B>I Still Live with this</B>

<P><B>By: Lhkoch@aol.com</B>

<P><B>I was about 5 to 6 years old.&nbsp; I lived in Madison WI.&nbsp;
Where we lived on Temkin Ave, at the end of the road, there was a tree
line. A path took you through it, to an open feild of tall grass. In the
middle of the field was a large group of trees.&nbsp; My brother and our
friend Peter used to play there all the time.</B>
<BR><B>One Sunday afternoon, the three of us went there, as always.&nbsp;
There were a bunch of beer bottles lying around.&nbsp; (the teens used
to party there, too)&nbsp; We were all taking turns smashing them on the
rocks, laughing and taking, the usual things kids do.&nbsp; The day was
warm, and the sky was clear blue.</B>
<BR><B>I picked up a bottle, and threw it at a nearby rock. As soon as
it hit, it immediately got dark.&nbsp; They way it does when a storm cloud
passes over.&nbsp; There was a wind that blew, and in the next instant,
we all heard a scream, almost like a roar.&nbsp; It was inhuman.&nbsp;
It resonated threee times in sucession.&nbsp; We all screamed and ran back
to our homes, a few blocks down the road.</B>
<BR><B>For years, I thought i had imagined it. But not&nbsp; a day goes
buy when I don't think of it, even now at the age of 29.&nbsp; If I had
imagined it, why did we all lok at eachother right after it happened with
the same look.&nbsp; The look only a terrifying, supernatural event can
invoke? Why did we all run screaming bloody murder for our lives?</B>
<BR><B>My brother denys it, and I have lost contact with Peter.&nbsp; I
went back to that place about 10 years later,&nbsp; visting my grandfather
who also lived in Madison.&nbsp; When we got close to that place, my blood
literally ran cold.&nbsp; I could hear the scream in the back of my mind,
and we had to leave.</B>
<BR><B>Some-"thing" was there, and it scared the crud out of us.&nbsp;
It still gives me the schivers to think of it today, because I KNOW it
was real.</B>

<BR><B>Not Quite a Ghost</B>

<P><B>By: rowdy_langsted@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>This is a true story as told to me by my mother when I was just a
little girl . She told me that she and her sister and a few of their friends
got together and were trying to think of things they could do on a saturday
night that didn't cost money. One of their favorite things to do was to
go to the local cemetary and hang out . So they did . When they got to
the cemetary and parked in the middle so they wouldn't be seen from the
road , my mom's sister and her date and another couple that was with them
got out of the car and began strolling along the head stones . My mom had
decided to stay in the car cause she was a little nervous about being in
a cemetary at night . This was the first time she had gone with the group
to the cemetary .</B>
<BR><B>My mom sat in the car working cross word puzzles and listening to
the radio . All of a sudden she heard foot steps walking up towards the
car . Thinking it was just the other kids coming back to try to sneak up
on her to scare her she ignored it . She had sat there for about 3 or 4
minutes , when she felt hot breath on her neck ,. When she looked up there
was a huge white mass leaning in the window of the car . She started screaming
at the top of her lungs cause she thought a ghost was trying to get into
the car with her . When the rest of the group heard my mom's screams they
all ran back to the car as fast as they could . When they got to the car
, there they saw the biggest white horse they had ever seen poking it's
head into the window of the car . My mom was hysterical and afraid to look
up as if she did the ghost might get her . But when she finally looked
up at everyones urging she too saw that the huge white mass of ghost was
just a very huge , pure white horse . To this day when ever we go past
the cemetary or attend a funeral there my mom never fails to say ," I wonder
what ever happened to that darn horse . I hope you enjoy this story . I
know it isn't the typical true ghost story with a real ghost , but I have
always thought it was funny and cute . I hope you will put it on your site
. Thank you , Rowdy</B>

<BR><B>Plenty to keep me Awake</B>

<P><B>By: Satansreeper666@aol.com</B>

<P><B>hi my name is rich when i was around 5 i lived in a duplex house
on a main street when my family moved in nobody noticed anything except
for you guessed it me every night for two years i would have the same nightmare
night after night about a witch reaching from the wall next to my bed and
try to pull me through.&nbsp; when my house was first bought my father
found a pentagram painted on the attic floor, but he never mentioned anything
until i was 10.&nbsp; the next case is in the present i moved into the
house i live in when i was 17 i am now 19 almost 20.</B>
<BR><B>like the oldest usually would i chose my room first or else.&nbsp;
so typically i picked the biggest one which happened to be the finished
basement</B>
<BR><B>(lucky me) everything was fine for about 3 months until i started
to notice the door between the finished and unfinished sections of the
basement was always open in the morning. now take to mind that i always
secured it shut with a padlock and rest assured everymorning for 2 weeks
the door would be open and the locked still locked up in the spot on the
wall.</B>
<BR><B>but that's nothing compared to what started to happen recently after
that i got into an odd habit of waking up at 3:10 on the dot every morning.&nbsp;
for the first month i would wake up to the sound of someone at the padlocked
door. i could hear it open and it was not a creak it was a big thud because
a piece of the door frame is 2 inches to long so it makes a loud thud when
it clears the piece. the door would open then close and someone would walk
from the door to my room up the stairs back down and then through the door
again.&nbsp; It stopped for a week and then I woke up on a Sunday night
a 3:10 one week later to the same familiar sound only this time when it
got to my door it opened it and came in.&nbsp; IM not gonna say I saw a
ghost or an orb or apparition cause I didn't I just heard a faint shuffle
of feet come over to my back then something sat on my back and started
to push my face into the pillows and kept applying pressure to my neck.
Now theres those of you that will pass this off as a mere dream but let
me ask you this..... when you get hit in a dream does it hurt? i can even
answer for you.. no it does not hurt. but that night when it was pushing
on my neck it was one of the worst pains i ever felt.. after the fact i
jumped up ran to the living room and slept or watched TV there the rest
of the night i have not stepped foot back in that room again but you can
hear it or sense it theres foot steps moving chairs things being switched
around and shrieks.. sorry about the length but i hope you enjoyed my nightmare</B>

<P><B>Rochester, Indiana, Centerville, Indiana, and Katy, Texas</B>

<P><B>By: dapeent@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>I have lived in 5 different houses and in 3 of them I have seen ghosts.
I'll</B>
<BR><B>start from the first one. I used to live in a stone house. I</B>
<BR><B>moved there when I was about 4. We no longer live there. But there
is so</B>
<BR><B>many things that went on in that house. When we first lived there,
there was</B>
<BR><B>a lot that happened. My sister, "Hanna" reported seeing a hand reaching
in</B>
<BR><B>her door and move things on her dresser around, one night a girl
of about 15</B>
<BR><B>in white walked into “Hanna’s” bedroom, sat on her bed and started
to rub</B>
<BR><B>her leg, early one morning “Hanna” woke up and she could not move,
her hand</B>
<BR><B>and legs were pinned down, she screamed, my mother and sister, "Rachelle"</B>
<BR><B>came and didn’t believe that she was stuck so they just left the
room and a</B>
<BR><B>min. later it let go and “Hanna” was free.. My brother "Ian" said
that one</B>
<BR><B>night he got up for a drink of water, got one, went through the
living room</B>
<BR><B>and saw our old rocking chair rocking by itself. In one of the pens
for our</B>
<BR><B>horse it will grow high with weeds in the summer so he had to go
and clear</B>
<BR><B>some of the weeds out, he started to cut some of the weeds by the
woods with</B>
<BR><B>one of those hand weed whackers that are like a shovel and he heard</B>
<BR><B>footsteps behind him so he turned around and nothing was there so
he turned</B>
<BR><B>back around and then a bush started to shake behind him, and on
another</B>
<BR><B>occasion him and my other brother "Joe" woke to hear their door
handle</B>
<BR><B>rattling. Their is a small furnace in the living room and my mother
and</B>
<BR><B>father would take turns stoking the furnace once a night, my mother
one</B>
<BR><B>night went down to put wood in it and out of the corner of her eye
she saw</B>
<BR><B>the girl in white sitting on the stairs, she ignored it by just
going about</B>
<BR><B>her business and when she was done it was gone( that is the only
ghost she</B>
<BR><B>ever saw and she denies it now). When we first moved in I didn’t
have a bed</B>
<BR><B>to sleep in for one reason or another so I slept on a couch upstairs.
At the</B>
<BR><B>time there was a door from that room into the master bedroom, and
at nights</B>
<BR><B>I would hear footsteps going from the bathroom, through the room
I was in</B>
<BR><B>and into the M. bedroom. After that nothing much happened for about
5-6 yrs</B>
<BR><B>when I was around 10yrs old and the only ones who witnessed them
were me and</B>
<BR><B>my little sister "Lilly."&nbsp; We would go feed the chickens during
the day and</B>
<BR><B>we would hear children in the woods, we would hear laughing, singing,
crying</B>
<BR><B>and screaming, we would then go into the woods looking for the kids
that</B>
<BR><B>snuck onto our property and there would be no signs of any kids,
but heard</B>
<BR><B>only sounds of footsteps. The weirdest thing that happened during
that time</B>
<BR><B>was is the hammering at nights. We took turns locking the chicken
coop so</B>
<BR><B>that no animal would get them and one night I heard a sound of someone</B>
<BR><B>hammering which come from every direction, at first we didn’t mind,
we just</B>
<BR><B>though it was a neighbor working late on something, but it continued
every</B>
<BR><B>night and it would freak us out, so us being young we would go run
inside to</B>
<BR><B>mommy. She would come out and the sound would be gone of course
so she would</B>
<BR><B>go inside and as soon as she left it would start up again. When
I was young</B>
<BR><B>I had a habit of waking up pretty early, even on the weekends, just
when the</B>
<BR><B>sun would just start to come up and one morning I awoke to see the
girl in</B>
<BR><B>white floating a few feet off the floor in the corner of my downstairs</B>
<BR><B>bedroom so I just shoved my head under the covers until she was
gone. The</B>
<BR><B>one last thing is that every time I went upstairs by myself I get
this</B>
<BR><B>terrifying feeling inside and I could not stand being up there for
one more</B>
<BR><B>second, so I would run down stairs as fast as possible. I never
really got</B>
<BR><B>that feeling when I was downstairs, just up. The creepy thing is
that the</B>
<BR><B>man that built our house dyed while building it, so that would explain
the</B>
<BR><B>hammering. And my friend's Dad, who had lived there all his life,
told me</B>
<BR><B>that the guy who built the house, got into trouble for using old
broken</B>
<BR><B>tombstone on the house. I don't know if this is true, I never saw
any</B>
<BR><B>engravings in the stones, however, that might explain the children
in the</B>
<BR><B>woods and the girl in white. Yep, those are the strange events that
happened</B>
<BR><B>when my family lived West.</B>
<BR><B>The next place I moved to was a small town called Centerville, Indiana.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It</B>
<BR><B>was a small little house, but nice and it was surrounded by trees.
I was</B>
<BR><B>11yrs old when we moved here. We only lived in that house for 1
yr. so not</B>
<BR><B>too much happened. Well, one of the first things that</B>
<BR><B>happened was when I has in the shower. I was just taking a shower,
and I</B>
<BR><B>heard a bunch of noises, shaking and banging, it would stop, and
then it</B>
<BR><B>would start again. I was like the heck is going on, so I finished
washing up</B>
<BR><B>and I went out of the bathroom and asked, who was making all the
noise and</B>
<BR><B>everyone was like, what are you talking about. I got a little suspicious
and</B>
<BR><B>the next</B>
<BR><B>time I took a shower it happened again so I jumped out of the shower,
waited</B>
<BR><B>and saw the closet door shaking and banging coming from inside the
closet. I</B>
<BR><B>opened the closet thinking that the cat was stuck in there. I open
it up,</B>
<BR><B>found not cat, but the closet was a complete mess. Things from in
the closet</B>
<BR><B>was all over. I got dressed as fast as I ever did in my life and
got out of</B>
<BR><B>there. After that I wouldn’t take showers at night anymore. One
time my</B>
<BR><B>parents were going out for the day, so they left at about 8 in the
morning</B>
<BR><B>and didn’t get back until 11:30 at night. So, it was just me and
two of&nbsp; my</B>
<BR><B>sisters, "Lilly" and "Hanna." We decided to just have a movie day;
we</B>
<BR><B>watched movies the whole day. From the living room you could see
my parent’s</B>
<BR><B>room. The door was open and the lights were off the entire day cause
they</B>
<BR><B>were gone. It was around 10 and it was just commercials on TV. So,
we all</B>
<BR><B>took a break. I went to the bathroom, "Hanna" to the fridge and
"Lilly" to</B>
<BR><B>change into PJs. I don’t take that long in the bathroom so I was
the first</B>
<BR><B>one back and as I enter the living room I see that all the lights
in my</B>
<BR><B>parents room had turned on all by themselves. My mother likes wind
chimes</B>
<BR><B>and she had one hanging from her ceiling fan in her room. And one
day we all</B>
<BR><B>hear this loud crash. My mother and me run into her room to check
it out, to</B>
<BR><B>find that her wind chime had fallen off the ceiling fan. My mom
doesn’t real</B>
<BR><B>believe in ghost so she says, o the stupid cat must have done it,
and she</B>
<BR><B>then left. But I stayed to investigate. I search the whole room
and did not</B>
<BR><B>find the cat in that room. Then, I started to think, even if the
cat did do</B>
<BR><B>it, it would be pretty hard for a cat to get that down, especially
if the</B>
<BR><B>chime was tied to the pull chain of the ceiling fan. I was in my
room one</B>
<BR><B>night, looking in the bookshelf at the end of my room. There was
a small</B>
<BR><B>hand held fan on my dresser, on the other side of the room and it
just</B>
<BR><B>turned on by itself. It took me a while but I slowly went over and
turned it</B>
<BR><B>off. After that we had another incident with a fan. My mom, "Lilly"
and me</B>
<BR><B>were sitting in the living room, watching TV, with a big box fan
turned on,</B>
<BR><B>and sitting on the floor. My mom said she felt chilly (very strange
because,</B>
<BR><B>everyone else was hot) so she told me to go turn off the fan. So,
I went</B>
<BR><B>over there and turned it completely off and sat down, and few minutes
later</B>
<BR><B>it just turned on high all by itself. We all just stared at the
fan for a</B>
<BR><B>while, then I went over and turn it off and then unplugged it, just
to make</B>
<BR><B>sure. My mother had no explanation for that one.&nbsp; One night
I was sleeping</B>
<BR><B>and was woken up by a loud thumping noise, like someone was jumping
on the</B>
<BR><B>floor. The sound just kept going and going and going, I tried to
sleep, but</B>
<BR><B>I was too freaked out to sleep. At this time I shared had to share
a room</B>
<BR><B>with “Lilly.” So, the sound stopped long enough for me to gain courage
to</B>
<BR><B>get up and nudge “Lilly”. I asked her if she heard the thumping,
she said no</B>
<BR><B>and went back to sleep. I got back into my bed, and tried to go
back to</B>
<BR><B>sleep scared and then it started again. I got up, nudged “Lilly,”
she woke</B>
<BR><B>up, and by that time it had stopped. I asked her again if she heard
it, but</B>
<BR><B>no she didn’t. I was not gonna be able to sleep in that room, so
I got my</B>
<BR><B>blanket and pillow, built up enough courage (it took a while), and
went out</B>
<BR><B>into the living room to sleep. The living room was just down the
hall. I</B>
<BR><B>laid on the couch and tried to sleep.&nbsp; Then it started again,
but it was not</B>
<BR><B>as loud cause I was farther away from it. I tried as best as I could
to</B>
<BR><B>ignore it and finally I fell asleep. The last thing to have happened
that I</B>
<BR><B>can remember was at 11:30 at night. My mother, “Lilly” and me had
come back</B>
<BR><B>from a long day at the county fair. My two brothers and my oldest
sister,</B>
<BR><B>”Rachelle” had come to visit. My whole family was there and we were
all</B>
<BR><B>talking in the living room and the doorbell rang. So my brother,
“Joe” and</B>
<BR><B>me opened the door. The door was right in the living room so it
took us</B>
<BR><B>about 4 sec to be outside to find no one there. We turned on the
outside</B>
<BR><B>light, looked under the porch, around the cars, and found no one
and heard</B>
<BR><B>nothing. We came back inside, I was freaked out cause I knew what
had</B>
<BR><B>happened, it was another ghostly visit, but my mother being the
non-believer</B>
<BR><B>says the doorbell is probably low on batteries. I knew it wasn’t
the</B>
<BR><B>batteries because I have heard the doorbell when it is low on batteries,
it</B>
<BR><B>makes this nasty slow ring, WHEN it has been rung, it had never
rang by</B>
<BR><B>itself before. Although I never saw the ghost face to face, I think
one of</B>
<BR><B>the ghosts from my last house followed us . I think this because,
one of my</B>
<BR><B>friends happened to live in that house before my family and he said
he had</B>
<BR><B>not seen or heard anything weird when he lived there.&nbsp; That
is it. I know it</B>
<BR><B>is a little longer than the last but that is because I witness all
of them.</B>
<BR><B>It was pretty weird they all happened when I was around. No one
else had a</B>
<BR><B>personal experience with them but me while we lived there. The only
thing</B>
<BR><B>that I got was from “Hanna,” she said that she got a bad feeling
that</B>
<BR><B>something strange was there. Those are the occurrences when I lived
on</B>
<BR><B>Lammott Road.</B>
<BR><B>The last place I lived at that was haunted was Katy, Texas in a
sub-division</B>
<BR><B>. I moved there when I was 12yrs old. The first year I</B>
<BR><B>lived there some things happened. My sister "Lilly" said that she
heard</B>
<BR><B>someone banging on her walls of her room at night, items that hung
would</B>
<BR><B>start to sway, like chandeliers, and some other little things. My
mother was</B>
<BR><B>actually the one who reported the things swaying, I guess she had
to admit</B>
<BR><B>that when I asked her if she noticed anything strange. She said
that there</B>
<BR><B>was no draft to make it move, it would just start to swing for a
little</B>
<BR><B>while and stop. Then a year later is when a few major things happened.
Me</B>
<BR><B>and my friend, "Gram" were outside just walking around the sub-division</B>
<BR><B>talking at around 2 in the morning. We were just hanging out and
I suggested</B>
<BR><B>that we go sit on the benches at the park across from my house,
but "Gram"</B>
<BR><B>said that he had a bad feeling and didn’t want to. I said okay.
Then little</B>
<BR><B>while later I suggested it again and he said fine, I'll go. So,
we headed up</B>
<BR><B>there. I was looking and talking to him as we walked; he was looking</B>
<BR><B>forward. We got half way there and "Gram" just took off running
in the</B>
<BR><B>opposite direction. I turned to watch him run, saying, "Gram" what
are you</B>
<BR><B>doing? I turned back around to see a short ghost wearing purple
right beside</B>
<BR><B>the bench where we were going to sit. I ran across the street to
where</B>
<BR><B>"Gram" was. We stood there trying to calm down, while trying not
to look at</B>
<BR><B>the park. We both calm down some, look back at the park, and the
ghost was</B>
<BR><B>gone. We didn’t want to be outside any longer, so we head for the
back door</B>
<BR><B>of my house. We go though the gate, close it, and enter into the
backyard.</B>
<BR><B>Just before we reach the door, the gate began to shake furiously.
This</B>
<BR><B>almost made us wet ourselves, being that we were scared to begin
with. That</B>
<BR><B>back door opened faster than a speeding bullet and we were inside.
Then a</B>
<BR><B>few weeks to a month later, I was getting ready to go to school.
It was</B>
<BR><B>early; it was still dark outside. I was getting into the fridge
to get some</B>
<BR><B>breakfast. Our refrigerator was directly beside the doorway into
the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen. As I was looking in the fridge, I see an arm pass by the
doorway</B>
<BR><B>out of the corner of my eye. I close the fridge. Me, thinking it
was</B>
<BR><B>"Lilly," called for her. "Lilly" is that you? No answer, and as
I exit the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen, and into the hallway, I looked around and nothing was there.
After</B>
<BR><B>that nothing else happened from then on.</B>
