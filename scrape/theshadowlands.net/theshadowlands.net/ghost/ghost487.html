<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I have had a
personnel
experience with this location. When we went we turned off our
headlights except
parking lights as we were told to by locals. And they were sure to tell
us to
not exit the vehicle. As we drove down the road we saw the light
walking across
the road and it vanished. But as we got further down we realized it was
following us down the road. Well me and a buddy got out of the car and
our
other friend continued to drive we sat on the hood of the car. And
noticed the
light was gone well the next thing we know it was walking towards us
but this
time it was red. And as it got closer to the car it got brighter like a
fire in
an old-timey lantern. We stopped and it continued towards us and it
seemed to
pass straight through the car, stalling it out and when it hit the
other side
the light turned back to a normal yellowish glow and the car started
right back
up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I submitted a story
here a
while ago and figured i'd share more of my experiences. My best friend
posted a
story on here about a crazy experience we both had regarding a possible
werewolf near where I lived. Sounds crazy I know but it actually
happened. One
night since it was nice and warm out I figured i'd use my spirit seeing
talent
and check out the road next to mine which is in the country. It was
close to
sunset and I figured i'd go check it out. On my way there I passed a
few
neighbors walking by me one by one who gave me a weird look cause I was
going
down that road at night. When I walked onto the road I saw a guy
running down
onto my street looking like he didn't want to be on that road either
when night
fell. As I walked down the road a little bit I noticed shadow people
running in
the distant across the road and disappearing. I kept going and noticed
in the
field I was gonna soon pass a shadow figure appeared looking at me
zipping off
really fast. As I hit the field I saw the presence of a white wolf
spirit
walking in the field and quickly disappeared. It was weird cause my
friend told
me earlier that day he saw one in his moms apartment. I hit some guard
rails
and had a bad feeling come over me like I should turn around. So I did
and
walked home. Before I hit my street I passed a dirt road when all of a
sudden a
shadow figure which looked male a little taller than me ran next to me
looking
down at me seeming hyper like "hey what you doing?" and disappeared.
I laughed a little and continued home. Then at 1 in the morning I was
heading
to bed and before I fell asleep I heard what sounded like kids laughing
outside
my window. I found out a couple days later that my best friend heard
the same
exact thing I did at that same time in the morning as i did. Close to
where I
live there's some train tracks that are unused but my mom told me when
she was
growing up a lot of people were hit on those tracks by trains. I opened
my
window and it stopped so I went back to bed. My mom woke me up an hour
later
saying she could hear what sounded like wolves not the regular coyotes
nearby.
By the time I got up it stopped. Strange things always happen outside
between 1
and 2 in the morning for some reason. Like when the barn light goes out
I hear
something banging on the metal gate keeping our horse in his area then
when the
light comes back on it disappears. Another thing that happened was I
was coming
back from a friends place and it was dark. I stupidly took the road
where I saw
the crazy shadow person and white wolf spirit. Everything was going
well as I
was listening to my music. I then hit the guard rails and had a really
bad
feeling something was gonna happen. I took my headphones off and heard
a blood
curdling, bone chilling, evil, growl from where the deep ditch was
leading into
the woods next to the guard rails. The guard rails looked like they
were a mile
long at that point. I knew it had to be me and my best friends werewolf
friend
cause I had the same paralyzing chill I got that night when we heard
it. I
started walking slowly holding onto my cross around my neck for
protection and
the thing got louder and more scarier. It lasted a couple minutes then
I heard "In
the Arms of an Angel" come on my MP3 player and it slowly calmed down
after a while. I looked behind me to see the shadow figure of a medium
sized
dog following me 10 feet away moving as I moved. I sensed no threat and
walked
as fast as I could passed the guard rails. I finally passed the guard
rails and
started walking slowly when I heard the dog bark at the end of the
guard rails.
I turned and looked at it and it barked again then turned around
walking off
disappearing. I didn't know it then but it hit me later that it was our
family
dog Lady who we put down a couple years ago. After we put her down "In
the
Arms of an Angel" played on both the radio and my MP3 player at the
same
time. I think she knew that was her song and showed up to protect me.
That was
exactly the way she was when she was alive. An angel. One of the most
sweetest
nicest dogs we ever had. I still miss her these days and will never go
down
that road at night ever again. Thanks again for letting me share my
stories.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Clarksville, AR
University of
the Ozarks There are actually quite a few places here that are haunted
and some
from personal experiences. Smith Hall: Late night/Early morning, people
walking
down the middle stairwell will experience pressure on their backs as if
someone
is pushing them down. People have tripped on those stairs saying they
have felt
someone pushing them. The showers here have actually gone on their own.
<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In one case, I went in to shower late
at
night on the second floor. Next to me, a shower had been running since
before I
went in and continued long after I finished. I checked in because I
didn't
notice any feet and when I pushed the curtains aside, the water was not
running
and the entire area was dry. Maclean Hall: Eerie singing can be heard
at night
coming from the showers in the basement, this is especially true in the
summer
when there are rarely any, if at all, people in the building. Vorhees
Hall
(International Building): Lights turn on and off on their own. I was
working
houskeeping and my coworker and I went down to the bottom level. She
asked
where the lights where and they suddenly turned on. It's happened quite
frequently. Ravens like to gather in the back area at night and the
building
has been switched from night shift to day shift cleaning for safety
reasons.
Walton Fine Arts Center: The ghost of a young girl is said to reside
here. She
has been dubbed "the Walton ghost." She hangs around the theatre
department and the theatre majors say she is a form of good luck. If
she is not
seen around the time of a big event, the performance goes bad. That's
why they
all cross their fingers they see the girl at least once. In one
incident, I was
walking into the building late at night to meet my friend in the
ceramics
building. I saw a girl dressed in an old white frilly dress. She looked
at me
and disappeared into the theatre. Another guy who worked in that
department
came by and I asked what play they were working on. He looked at me
confused
and said there weren't any recent ones and that he was the only one
back there.
I ran out of there and told my friends some time later. Turns out, the
girl
that I saw fit the description of a a painting in the drawing room
upstairs. No
telling if she is the Walton ghost or related to the painting they
showed me.
Walker Hall: A young girl has been spotted in the window late at night
when the
building is locked up. The lights blink sometimes to match the
footsteps of
people coming up and the atomic clocks begin to beep for no reason at
all at
random intervals. The elevators will sometimes shut abruptly and can be
hard to
open. Robson Library: People have been seen walking around the
bookshelves late
at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Munger Chapel: The bottom
level sometimes has floating light orbs in the air at night and early
morning.
The temperature suddenly decreases drastically near Angel Hall.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Seay Student Center (Dining Hall Second
Floor): A ghost by the nickname "Ed" resides there. He has been known
to do both good and bad things depending on the people he encounters.
He has
helped people find lost objects in the catering room and has thrown
projectiles
at people he doesn't like. In one instance, he threw an ice cream scoop
at one
of two employees that was working that night. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Hello, I wrote to
you awhile
ago about the house I grew up in but I had somethings happen to me back
in 2005
that I could never explain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband
and I were going through the immigration process back in 2005 and while
our case
was being reviewed by the INS my husband had to stay in Mexico.This was
a very
stressful time and we were facing a lot of uncertainties. So we packed
up and
moved to his family's home down in Zamora, Michaocan. At the time my
oldest son
was only 2 years old and my mom had driven down with us to help with
the INS
appointments and to help us get settled in our new home. Well, so when
we
finally arrived to my husbands family's home we got unpacked and
settled in to
await our verdict ( we would hear from the INS 6 months later). The
house is
basically two homes together. The building is L shaped it has the
original
house and then you have to go outside into the courtyard to access the
second
house. This area had a bathroom and a store and a supply room for the
store.
And above this was our apartment. This area had not had anyone stay in
it for
maybe 10 years. This area was like a duplex attached by a door through
the
living rooms so we took the left side and closed up the right side. Now
the
side we took had an unusual feature. It had a huge bedroom that was
divided by
a wall and had a open doorway so it was two bedrooms in one. We slept
in one
bedroom and my mom slept on the other side. Now, this is a huge home
especially
by Mexico standards but we only shared it with two other people, my
brother and
sister in law because the other family members moved about ten years
before.
Nothing about this home seemed scary or creepy but I did learn that
between the
two houses, two of my husbands toddler sisters were buried. I didn't
know this
until months later. So a few day after we arrived we were cleaning and
unpacking. My husband was down in the store covering for his brother
and my mom
and I were upstairs cleaning the bedroom. She got tired and decided to
go out
on the balcony and sit. She took my son with her so I could continue
cleaning.
Well, I decided to sit down on the bed and I was faced toward the
window
looking out. Well, I could see the door leading to the living room out
of the
corner of my eye. It was half way open. While I was sitting there the
door
opened up and someone walked into the little bedroom. I heard the door
move
across the carpet and I saw out of the corner of my eye someone in a
white
shirt. I figured it was my mom and thought nothing of it but then<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>wondered where my son was and I started to
worry wondering why she had left him on the balcony alone. So I called
out and
no one answered,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>so I got up and walked
across the room and into the the little bedroom. I was certain someone
would be
in there cause I had seen someone go in there, Well I was completely
surprised
when I walked in there and no one was in the room. This really startled
me. So
I walked out onto the balcony and there were my mom and son, I'd asked<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>if she had went into the room and mom just
looked at me and said no. And no one but us and my husband were there
that day.
Another time I was walking up the stairs to our apartment and I had a
vision
flash in front of my face that completely terrified me. I still don't
know what
is was or why it happened but it was at night and I looked to my right
at the
wall and there was this horrible face like a gargoyle, just for a
second and
then it was gone. The only place I felt really uncomfortable at was the
downstairs
store/storage area. I would run past this place. It had a weird feeling
to it.
Nothing ever happened around there other then that feeling. The other
times
involved my son. During this time he developed a imaginary friend. He
would
call it the baby or babies sometimes. He would be in the hallway of the
kitchen
playing and say oh, come see the babies. Or he would be talking and I'd
ask him
who he was talking to and he would say the babies. I didn't think
anything of
it until my husband told me about his sisters, then I felt kind of
uncomfortable with it. One day we were sitting in the living room and
he comes
in crying and tells me that the babies are hiding under the bed, well I
didn't
want to look under the bed but I did anyways and of course there wasn't
anything there. But it still made the hair on the back of my neck rise
up. The
only other thing was one day my husband and I were sitting on the couch
and my
son was playing on the rug and were just talking and my son looks over
into the
corner and says look at that man with the cowboy hat on. Well we didn't
see
anything so we just say oh is there, and he continues playing with his
truck
and we keep talking well about ten minutes later my son looks up and
says oh,
he's gone. I don't know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, we left
six months later and were able to come back to the U.S and and have
been just
put these stories in with all our other strange things that have
happened. It
was weird that awhile later I was talking to my sister in law, a
different one,
who had grown up there and I told her about our experiences and she got
really
defensive and didn't want to talk about it any more. So who knows
thanks for
letting me share.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

California:
Redlands- Redlands High School Theater<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>cmgill@live.com <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I
am sure you get several e-mails about people
wanting to comment on stories posted on your website. However I still
wanted to
share what I know about the Redlands High School Theater. My first
reason is
that I have spent probably the last ten years fascinated by this this
building
when my sister was here and am currently a senior at the high school
and have
spent the past four years putting on shows in the building, so I overly
familiar with the stories and have researched them and I wish the
stories of
the building to be told correctly,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let
me first off start by saying, no one has ever died in the building. I
wish it
were true, because honestly that would make some of our stories a
little more
explainable,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The teenage presence that
was mentioned in the current post, is named David. This is the name
that has
been passed down from theater kid to theater kid, however the spirit
here seems
to respond to that name, so I have no reason to believe it is
incorrect. He
also goes by the nickname of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The
Clock Ghost" (the auditorium is called Clock auditorium) While the
stories
of a teenage boy writing poetry in the ventilation ducts is true, they
are no
longer in the building thanks to the California School Modernization
act, they
were removed and replaced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>David did
however not die in the theater, I have poured over obituaries and
newspaper
archives from the early 1990's, and nothing has even eluded to someone
dying in
the building. ( when the female student was killed in the car
accident.) This
lead me to believe that David may just have an strong connection to the
building, because he is indefinitely there.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I personally have had several run ins with David, from working
long
nights at the theater. One night when there were only two of us in the
building
I was asked to get something from the green room, and given the
specific keys
to unlock one of the offices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
fidling around with the keys trying to get the door open to the office,
with
the right key I could not get it open. I tried turning the handle both
ways and
putting the key back in but the door wouldn't open. I then very
politely told
David to stop screwing around, and the door opened by itself. The locks
made
the opening sound and everything. My second experience with David
during a
rehearsal I was alone in one of the wings and there was the distinct
sound of
someone breathing over my shoulder, but when I looked no one was there.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other students have reported
seeing a
shadowy figure in the control booth at the top of the balcony area that
is no
longer used, the door is locked and our technical director is adamant
about
keeping it locked, the shadowy figure has also been seen at the top of
the
stairs leading to the balcony area. In the basement area of the theater
people
have also felt a looming presence, coincidentally this is where the
majority of
the ventilation is, and claimed that they were touched. There have been
other
spirits reported in the building as well. During the summer the
building is
often rented out for other theater companies to use, and before the
school
budgets were cut significantly, the building was suppose to be
regularly
maintained by the school janitorial staff. However when classes resumed
at the
beginning of the school year, the house of the theater was a mess. When
the
janitors were confronted they said they refused to clean it when there
was no
one else around (as in a whole production of people or a class) because
of the
children. When we said that no children were in the building during the
summer
the janitors told us that they heard little kids voices and light
footsteps
running through the house, even across the stage. At first they weren't
afraid
enough to stop but then apparently things started to move into
unexplained
places. We have a set of heavier metal chairs that are sometimes kept
in the
wings, the janitors claimed that they went missing one day, so they
searched
all over the building for them. The eventually found them but they were
in the
proscenium arch above the stage, the only access to the arch is from
the stairs
leading to the catwalk, which have very narrow openings in the space
between
landings. They tried to get the chairs down but they wouldn't even fit
through
the opening, To get the chairs down we had to set up a makeshift pulley
system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of the spirits in the
building have ever been mean or violent but more mischievous and
helpful. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of Our Old
Apartment<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Izzatyutu@aol.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I had recently
moved from our
old apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were
"visited" there by an unknown presence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
couple of years ago I had won some haunted
dolls I had bidded on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One was a doll
owned by a murdered teenager, the obituary and article about her murder
was
included with the doll.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the one
I think may have brought on much of the phenomena.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My sister heard knocking on my bedroom door
from the inside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We live in the same
apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't tell her that I had
the haunted dolls until she told me that.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Gave more credibility to it that way.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I tried to debunk it by saying that I may have knocked on the
door while
I slept, but she said no, she heard me up, getting ready for work,
getting my
clothes out of the drawers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't
hear it from the inside, though.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
happened one more time the next morning, but she asked the spirit to
leave and
it then stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But other things
started to happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our music box
mysteriously came to life with a full wind, even though it was wound
all the
way down and wasn't played for over a year.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then again two hours later again at full music without being
wound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Kept playing for several minutes.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Also our kitchen faucet moved from the right
to the left overnight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is hard to
move it by hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If that weren't enough,
we had a plug unplug out of the power strip and neither her or I
unplugged
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It isn't easy to unplug.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was kept plugged in for the pump for the
inflatable bed, which had a leak in it and had to be pumped up every
couple of
hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we never unplugged it.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Our "visitor" made sure to make
itself known.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also another plug
unplugged half way out of the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is a three pronged one and very hard to unplug.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And then our space heater power button was turned on by our
visitor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was awesome.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I wasn't afraid, as I investigate places now
and then for people and I am very used to much activity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My meter readings some nights were very high
in the areas that are usually in the green area on the meter.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Many times I would ask for a sign that it was
there and then it would spike into the red zone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
sort of miss that activity after moving
out, but perhaps some day it will return in the new place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

room was filled with people looking objects...like sparklersburning,
but in the
form of heads and shoulders of people....I live by myself sincemy wife
died, so
I had no one to holler for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I yelled
at the people sparkler objects.I did recognize one of the people...it
was my
sister who died last year and I wasnot speaking to her when she died
because of
a family argument I had with her several years ago between her and me
and her
son and my son..I tried to get out of bed, but I was so weak for some
reason or
other, I could not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally the objects
disappeared and I was alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I talked
with my son today and told him about what had happened.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He said..."Dad, the same thing happened
to me...exactly the same thing!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
son said he has a friend who is a SPIRITUALIST and said objects of this
nature
are considered ORBS!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His friend told him
always to be nice to the Orbs because they can be GOOD Orbs, not evil
ones.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If they are good Orbs, by talking
nice to them, you can communicate with them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They are only paying you a visit to carry good news.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Evil Orbs are of course the opposite. She
said to pray to the Lord to always keep the evil Orbs away from
you....A prayer
asking the Lord to protect you with his ring of light from these evil
Orbs and
evil spirits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Since i was young
there has
always been a few places that i don't feel comfortable in. I can walk
into my
friends basements and feel fine while my own if alone makes me very
uncomfortable. After i had moved out of my mothers house and in with my
father
my mom had many mediums from the world renowned LilyDale in Western NY
come to
the house and apparently there are 3 ghosts that live there, a grand
daughter
and her grand parents. My story actually takes places in Rhode Island.
I was in
a dead sleep when it felt like someone had sat on my bed. i awoke and
when i
did it looked like a dark figure jumped off my bed and out my door, i
was going
to think nothing of it until my dog started barking and going crazy
from my
parents room on the other side of the house, he tore around the house
until my
dad let him out and then he continued to run around the yard going
crazy for
another 5 minutes. When i woke up i distinctly remember looking at the
clock
and it was 12:11. The very next night i was awoken at 12:11 and again
my dog
started going crazy! Besides this one instance it has always been just
an
uncomfortable feeling that i was being watched, My bedroom used to be
in the
basement of my Mom's house. I was told i was crazy when i couldn't
sleep down
there because i felt like i was watched but both my mom and siblings
have tried
sleeping down there and they couldn't make it through the night. thanks
for
reading ENJOY!=<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Experiences<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>foxelade88@yahoo.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">My very first
paranormal
experience I had was at my first home in Des Moines, IA where I lived
with my
parents and my very close uncle who rented our upstairs. One night I
awoke to
the sound of rushing water around the age of 7. I decided to get up and
go
check it out since it sounded like something was really the matter. The
noise was
coming from our garage...normally I was scared to walk around my house
at night
in the dark but this was an emergency so I didn't think twice about it!
I flung
open the door to garage and to my astonishment, water was gushing in
through
the other door in the garage that led to the outside. I couldn't
believe my
eyes! I quickly ran to my parents room yelling at them to wake up and
hurry! I
scurried behind as my Dad went to investigate but when he got there,
not a
trace of water could be found! Of course they left it to my
imagination, but I
knew better! There was indeed a story that went along with that house I
found
out a couple years later. Before we moved in there was another little
girl who
had lived in the house and passed away. Story goes that she was playing
outside
when she was killed by a car right in front of the house and died
before she
could reach the hospital and the parents ended up selling the home.
Anyway, one
evening my Dad had a visitor from out of town who stayed in our garage
(part of
it was a den). My Dad said his friend woke up in the middle of the
night and
thought he saw me standing there staring at him. When he asked what I
was doing
up, he turned to look at the clock and when he turned back I had
vanished. Only
thing is, it wasn't me! After these incidents nothing happened for
quite a few
years until one night when I was 16. My friend and I were standing
outside
having a cigarette at my parents house and it was a very hard time in
my life.
Going down the wrong path, abusing drugs, and taking anti-depressants.
Anyway,
we were talking when out of the corner of my eye about 15 feet behind
my friend
I saw a little girl standing in our driveway by the free!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was around 6-8 years of age with medium
length brown hair and slightly transparent. She was staring right at me
and
then she vanished just as quickly as she had appeared. That is the
first time I
ever saw an apparation and that's when my perspective on the paranormal
started
to change. I still have a lot of 'odd occurences' that happen to this
day. For
example, my cousin who was in my wedding 6 1/2 months prior, passed
away
suddenly 2 weeks ago at age 20. Very sad and tragic. They declared him
brain
dead at the hosptial and my aunt decided to turn off life support and
donate
his organs. That Monday night I sat up thinking of him and grieving and
wondering if they had harvested his organs yet or pulled the plug. I
couldn't
get him off my mind. Around 11pm I was standing in my kitchen when all
of a
sudden my kitchen lights went completely dim and I heard a strange
buzzing that
sounded like electricity, the lights flickered for about 3 seconds and
then
came back on strong with a loud pop! I've lived in my house for 3 years
and
nothing like that has ever happened before with my kitchen lights. I
have no
idea what time they took him off life support but I know in my heart it
was him
coming to say goodbye. We had discussed the paranormal before and had
similar
beliefs so it's no wonder he chose me. Last but not least, this one
happened only
last night around 3:30am. I was lying awake in in bed. It was really
hot so I
couldn't sleep. Then out of nowhere, I hear my back door slam!<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband works the late shift so I usually
wake up when he gets home, greet him, and return to bed. He always
comes in the
back door but I totally would of heard him open the metal gate to come
into the
yard and the screen door, especially since our bedroom window is right
by both.
I was completely shocked when I came to my back door to find no one
there and
the dead bolt still locked! I'm not real sure why stuff like this
happens to me
but one of my good friends who is Catholic told me it's because I
believe in
ghosts. She said the spirits can sense people who are open and
suggested I tune
it out. Anyways, thanks for listening. Maybe I will share some more
another
time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Real Experience<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">This is an account
of events
experienced by a close friend of mine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
have changed the names to protect the identities of the people
involved. These
events took place in Manchester, England.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I met Charlotte some 2 &frac12; years ago when we both signed up
for a course
of ice skating lessons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We got on well
from the start and stayed in touch afterwards.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Charlotte&#8217;s father had started to suffer from dementia and her
mother
was taking care of him at home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, her mother suffered a stroke in November 2008 and
was
unable to return home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, it
fell on Charlotte to look after her father. Sadly, Charlotte&#8217;s father
died in
his sleep in February 2010.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was a
big shock as, although 89 years of age, he was very sprightly and in
good
health.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As you can imagine, Charlotte
was devastated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of Charlotte&#8217;s
sisters came up from down south to stay with her in the days afterwards
and
while they were arranging the funeral.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They both slept in their father&#8217;s bed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A couple of days after he died, Charlotte had a very vivid dream.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>In it, she saw her father as a young man in
rolled up shirt sleeves and a tank top.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was running down a hill and hot on his heels was a dog, like
they
were having a race.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said her father
looked very happy and full of life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
has never experienced anything like this before and felt it was her
father&#8217;s
way of showing her where he was now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
asked her if she recognised the dog.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
said her father used to talk about a dog he had when he was young but
she had
never seen a picture of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
obviously a very profound experience because it eased her grief in that
she
felt he had gone to a better place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is now March 2010.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I saw Charlotte over
the weekend and she told me what else has been happening.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Charlotte, her sister and her brother-in-law
have been in their father&#8217;s house clearing it out and decorating.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Charlotte was in one of the bedrooms and came
across an organ her father bought her when she was 16 (she plays the
piano).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, she sat down and started
playing it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The moment she did this, the
phone started ringing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bear in mind the
phone was disconnected some weeks ago.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her sister answered it but there was no-one there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While the three of them were upstairs in
separate areas, Charlotte&#8217;s brother-in-law asked who was making a drink.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Her sister replied that they were all busy
and that he should make his own drink.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her brother-in-law said that was not what he meant and asked who
was
boiling the kettle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Charlotte&#8217;s
sister went downstairs the kettle had just boiled and switched itself
off &#8211;
no-one had put it on to boil.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A day or
so later, Charlotte began playing the organ and, once again, as soon as
she
did, the phone rang just like before (still disconnected of course).<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Charlotte said that one night they were sat
around talking about their father and the lights in the room started
flickering.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This has never happened
before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as they stopped talking,
the flickering stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told Charlotte
that experiences like this are very common and it is her father letting
her
know that he is still around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last
time I saw her she was in pieces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
these experiences, although still very upset, she seems much calmer and
accepting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is wonderful when things
like this happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If only it could be
that way for everyone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Log Home<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My wife and I live in Ringgold, Ga. and have
lived here for 25 years in a log home that we built ourselves with a
lot of
help from friends and family, this was about 1983. About 3 or 4 years
after we
moved into our log home some strange things began to happen.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would be watching T.V. when all of a
sudden the T.V. would go off and when we found the problem, it was
unplugged
from the back of the T.V. You have to turn the plug on the power cord
to unplug
the T.V. and it was laying on the floor behind the T.V.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After this happened we started to hear Indian
music and some very low volume chanting. At times it would get very
chilly in
the house even when it was warm outside, but only in one bedroom. We
have a big
wall clock hanging on the great room wall and it has 3 chimes hanging
down from
it for the doorbells. When you push the doorbell button the chimes play
a short
tune.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At times for no reason at all the
chimes would start to move and ring like someone had pushed the
doorbell button
but there would be no one there. Our commodes would flush and there
would not
be any one there to flush them. We have found human bones and Indian
pottery,
arrow heads, and lead bullets about 50 cal.in size, and we do know that
a Civil
War battle was fought on our land and we checked with a University in
Alabama
and they told us that this was an area that had a Cherokee Indian
village back
in the 1700-1800 hundreds. We re-buried the bones and the pottery
shards and
the strange happenings have not been as frequent as they were.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We still live here and intend to stay
and
the strange happenings has not ever been a threat or harmed anyone in
any way.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">The Thing in the
Hallways<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">By: Anonymous<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">In 1957, my family
moved to
an old farmhouse in Mt. Laurel, New Jersey.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was 7 years old at the time and as I went upstairs to my new
bedroom
with an armload of things, a terrible wave of fear swept over me when I
reached
the top of the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From then on, I
disliked that small area at the top of the stairs where it met the
hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unhappily, there was no way to
avoid it: I had to walk through it to get into my bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Other than that, nothing else happened (that
I know of) until 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From my bed, I
could see out into the hallway to that small area at the top of the
stairs that
had always frightened me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night
towards the end of August, I woke up very, very slowly only to realize
that
there was a terrible stench in the bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was like a mix of rotten garlic, human waste and rotting
flesh.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I noticed the room was icy
cold
(remember: it was August -- usually the hottest time of the year in New
Jersey).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was lying on my side, facing
the doorway, and when I opened my eyes I saw that the bedroom door was
wide
open and a figure stood in the doorway (very close to the spot that had
always
spooked me).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since no lights were on,
all I could make out was the silhouette of a tall, dark figure that
seemed to
be wearing some kind of long robe with a hood.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What truly petrified me was seeing this creature's eyes: they
glowed red
and stared straight at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But before I
could scream, somehow the knowledge came to me from somewhere (my
guardian
angel?) that if I acknowledged this creature's existence I would be
haunted for
the rest of my life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I pretended to
be asleep -- which was not easy -- and after awhile I felt the cold
room become
warm again, the dreadful smell disappear, and the figure fade away.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We moved out in 1967 and the house was torn
down in 1972.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I, for one, was not the
least bit sorry to see it go.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">My Own Experiences<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">By: anonymous <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<span style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">As
a child living in our old cotton mill house,
raised by my grandmother, great aunt and her daughter (my cousin),<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I had many frightening, paranormal
experiences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I will elaborate on some of
them as time goes on, but this story is a recap of many of the things I
experienced living in that house a young child.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I heard the classic footsteps, sounds of
paper being crumpled, sounds of books falling when nothing was out of
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everybody in the family,
including myself, heard our names called,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Once I woke up and heard an soft, echoey female voice whisper,
&#8220;Deep
Magic.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(By way of explanation, Deep
Magic was a facial moisturizer).<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
once woke up to see a tiny pinpoint of light in my room which expanded
until
the entire room was a bright as day and then faded quickly back to
darkness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once I crawled under my
grandmother&#8217;s bed while everybody was outside, something I was not
allowed to
do, and heard a gruff voice beside my ear say one word...&#8221;gray.&#8221;<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I had then and still have no idea what that
could have meant, but I got the heck out from under that bed and never
went
back under there again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had an
encounter and long conversation in the house with a strange,<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>unknown, elderly woman who called herself,
&#8220;Granny Grunt.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I saw a little black
imp, the shadow of a skeleton and a handless arm which came up from
between the
bars in my iron bedspread, and saw blood drip from the ceiling.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When I was about four I saw a shadowy
figure
that at the time, I thought was the Easter Bunny, walk through the
livingroom
and disappear into the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I now
suspect there might have been some sort of gateway in my cousin&#8217;s room
because
much of the activity seems to come from or disappear in that direction.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>One night I had gone to bed early and had a
dream that a being (who looked like what UFOlogists nowadays call an
alien
&#8220;gray&#8221;) was trying to force a full sized apple down my throat.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I awoke gasping for breath, crying and
choking with that feeling still lingering in my throat of something big
being
forced down it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My grandmother had an
old rocking chair with a woven cane bottom which creaked loudly
whenever you
would sit down in it or get up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When my
Great Aunt broke her hip and later died of cancer, for two nights in a
row I
heard something sit down in that chair, squirm around a little bit and
then get
up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I once heard the sound of the chair
rocking in the night.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Additionally,
while<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my Great Aunt was in the hospital
dying of cancer, I was awakened three nights in a row by something
banging on
the front door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, nobody was
there but my Great Aunt died three days later.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later on, when I was in my 20&#8217;s still living in that house, I
awoke to
see a short woman with her hair in a bun and a white apron over an old
fashioned dress standing by my bed who quickly vanished.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had many experiences of being in that half
awake and unable to move state, while hearing voices talking and people
moving
around in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once while I was in
that state I felt and heard something leap quickly into bed beside me
and lie
there growling menacingly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It vanished,
of course when I was able to fully wake up.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I finally got married when I was 28 and moved away.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After my cousin passed away, I inherited the
house and my husband and I moved back into it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Strangely enough, I never heard or saw anything in those days we
lived
there together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house was totally
quiet and peaceful. </span><br>
