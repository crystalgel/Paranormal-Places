<BR><B>Phantom Dog</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: queen_of_fanelia@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was about two years old, I would see a dog in our house that
no one else would see. My mom and I were playing on the living room floor
once and I glanced over towards the doorway between the living room and
the kitchen. Suddenly, I started panicking and pointing near the doorway,
saying that there was a huge dog over there. Of course, my mom saw nothing
and she tried to calm me down but for almost an hour after first seeing
the dog, I was very nervous while we played and kept glancing in the direction
of the doorway to the kitchen. After a while, I forgot about what I had
seen and went on playing like normal. My mom thought that I had just seen
something out of the corner of my eye and had thought I saw a dog. She
thought nothing more of it until a few weeks later when the same thing
happened again, I claimed I saw a huge dog near the doorway to the kitchen.
Once again my mom tried to convince me that there was nothing there and
even went and stood in the spot where I told her the dog was to prove her
point. I kept insisting that this dog was there and wouldn't go near the
spot where I thought it was. As before, after about an hour I forgot about
it and went back to playing. This happened several times over the next
six months and each time my mother got more and more worried. Finall she
asked me to describe the dog, thinking that I was seeing my aunt's dog.
A few months before the first sighting, I had been running around in my
aunt's house. She had a Great Dane that was usually kept outside. One night
I was running around the house and my aunt had brought the dog in. I ran
into a room and the dog was there. It scared me because I hadn't expected
it to be there and my mom thought that maybe this experience was causing
me to see a dog in our living room. When she had me describe the dog, it
looked nothing like my aunt's dog. I saw the dog a few more times and then
just abruptly as the sightings had begun, they stopped. The house we live
in had been previously owned but I don't know by who or if they had a dog.
I don't remember these experiences first hand because I was only two, but
I don't know what reason my mom would have to make them up. If anyone has
any idea what could've caused the sightings, I'd love to get feedback.
Thanks!</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Spiritual Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: gregreid@roadrunner.nf.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi. my name is Greg and I have had a strange experience not too long
ago. I use to meditate for relief and relaxation until this one afternoon.</B>
<BR><B>My girlfriend was working and I had just finished running some Aarons.
I got into my apartment took off my shoes and walked into my bedroom to
check for messages.</B>
<BR><B>I felt a need to meditate this one day so I went into the living
room put down the blinds so it was a little dark, lit some candles after
putting them on the floor. I sat in front of them and started to slow down
my breathing. I fell into my meditation with in a few minutes feeling ultimate
relaxation, until I felt this really slight cold breeze across my shoulder.
It felt as if someone was there in the room staring at me from behind.</B>
<BR><B>This feeling was cold and started feeling like it was trying to
consume me. I tried to open my eyes and but couldn't. My heart rate started
racing my breathing started getting faster and more shallow. I began to
panic thinking something had a possession of me. In one final attempt I
awoke out of my trance and sprang up on my feet. What the hell just happened
to me. I asked my sister who studies these sorts of things which people
can not explain. She had no idea. She is also a mediator as well and she
has had the same thing happen to her. Plus a few of her friends as well.
We are all fairly close and feel that there may be something that comes
to visit us from time to time. Which this thing is supernatural. I wanted
to share this with others in hopes that someone else has something they
can relate to this.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Childhood Imaginary Friend</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: babyangelwings@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was reading the page about children and ghosts and it brought to
mind my own experience.</B><B></B>

<P><B>As my mother tells me from the ages of about 3 to 5 I had an imaginary
friend that I called George . I would sit in my room for hours on end playing
and talking aloud to this friend. My mother saw no harm in this and thought
my imagination was working overtime as most childrens do. But after about
a year things started to happen. I would come running out of my room bawling
that george had pulled my hair , or hit me or pichedme or even bit me .
At first she thought that I had either fell or bumped myself or even gotten
my hip length hair stuck on something , but after a while she began noticing
bruises and when I would come to her she would actually look at where I
had said I was hurt. She began finding raw red spots on my head , bite
marks on areas of my body that would be impossible for me to bite as well
as bruises and cuts.</B>
<BR><B>The year that my mother was expecting my sister my mother and I
moved into my grandparents home so as to have help from my grandmother
and aunt with the new baby.</B>
<BR><B>One night while I was in the basement sleeping and everyone else
was upstairs they heard a loud crash and screaming sound. Figuring that
I had fallen out of bed and hurt myself really badly my aunt and mother
flew downstairs to see what had happened . To their amazment I was fast
asleep in the middle of my bed. They checked to see if anything had fallen
anywhere in&nbsp; the basement and found everything safe and secure in
their places.</B>
<BR><B>Dumbfounded they decided to wake me and asked what had happened
and I answered that I was tired of being hurt and teased and had told Gerge
to go away and never come back.</B>
<BR><B>To this day my mother is convinced that there was an evil spirit
guised as a friend whom was following me around for those few years.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Marsh Road</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ashleigh@moriah.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have experienced many paranormal happenings in my lifetime, this
one</B>
<BR><B>however was witnessed by many others, therefore its credibility
is</B>
<BR><B>increased.&nbsp; While visiting cousins in San Jose, CA one summer
and</B>
<BR><B>complaining of boredom, a group of friends and myself decided to
go ghost</B>
<BR><B>hunting knowing that my cousin Stanley and I both had a history
of being</B>
<BR><B>"sensitive" to the spirit world. We did it just for fun, in search
of an</B>
<BR><B>adrenaline rush. We got online in search of haunted places in the
area.&nbsp; We</B>
<BR><B>searched the city night after night, getting creeped out, but experiencing</B>
<BR><B>nothing that couldn't be explained without a logical explanation.&nbsp;
Rumor had</B>
<BR><B>it that Marsh Road was haunted by a teenage girl who had been raped
and</B>
<BR><B>murdered by her boyfriend on Prom night, her body being disposed
of under</B>
<BR><B>the bridge at near the end of the road.&nbsp; It was said that if
you drive over</B>
<BR><B>the bridge at night one will experience electrical problems(such
as the car</B>
<BR><B>radio increasing with static, ect.), a foul odor will fill the car,
and if</B>
<BR><B>you look in your rearview mirror an image of the girl's beaten face
will be</B>
<BR><B>staring back.&nbsp; It is also said that her murderer grew so paranoid
that he</B>
<BR><B>would be caught for the murder that after he died, he returned to
haunt the</B>
<BR><B>road as well, only to scare off anyone coming near the bridge in
hopes that</B>
<BR><B>her body would never be found.&nbsp; His ghost is said to be driving
a white pick</B>
<BR><B>up truck.&nbsp; This truck is said to come of the embankment and
try chasing you</B>
<BR><B>off of the road.&nbsp; We thought it would be interesting to go
check it out.</B>
<BR><B>Marsh Road was actually quite a ways out.&nbsp; Up a long windy
road somewhere</B>
<BR><B>in the rural country side.&nbsp; Stanley was driving, and the 3
other's and</B>
<BR><B>myself encouraged him to drive safely, anticipating to see a white
truck</B>
<BR><B>that was trying to get us into an accident.&nbsp; As we approached
the bridge we</B>
<BR><B>all increasingly became scared. The road was dark and wooded.&nbsp;
We hadn't</B>
<BR><B>seen another car for miles, and I began to think that if we did
get in an</B>
<BR><B>accident and were hurt that no would possibly find us for sometime
as the</B>
<BR><B>road wasn't often traveled. A friend thought maybe we should turn
around,</B>
<BR><B>and just go home because it seemed like a bad idea.&nbsp; Being
completely</B>
<BR><B>freaked out, but not wanting to admit that I didn't want to continue
because</B>
<BR><B>I was too scared, said that it was lame and we weren't seeing any
"white</B>
<BR><B>ghost truck" and that we should just call it quits.&nbsp; As Stanley
began to</B>
<BR><B>turn the truck around, our friend Kristen shouted, "look, headlights!"
as</B>
<BR><B>she pointed off into the woods a distance away.&nbsp; There was
no turning around</B>
<BR><B>now, Stanley and another friend were too excited that we might have
actually</B>
<BR><B>found something real, and began driving further down the road.&nbsp;
We reached</B>
<BR><B>the bridge without ever coming in contact with truck.&nbsp; We felt
extremely</B>
<BR><B>creeped out.&nbsp; I urged Stanley to turn around, due to the amount
of fear I</B>
<BR><B>was experiencing.&nbsp; To no avail though, they wanted to check
it out, despite</B>
<BR><B>my warnings.&nbsp; As we passed over the bridge we all gritted are
teeth</B>
<BR><B>anticipating the worst.&nbsp; I took a deep breath and smelled no
foul odor.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>radio came in clearly, I glanced at the mirror from the back seat
and saw</B>
<BR><B>nothing out of the ordinary.&nbsp; I asked if anyone else had experienced</B>
<BR><B>anything odd, they all said no.&nbsp; We kind of felt let down,
disappointed that</B>
<BR><B>once again nothing happened, yet somewhat relieved at the same time.&nbsp;
We all</B>
<BR><B>still felt uneasy, but dismissed it because we had gotten so worked
up over</B>
<BR><B>seeing headlights.&nbsp; We continued down the road to find a place
to turn</B>
<BR><B>around.</B>
<BR><B>No one said much, I was concentrating on not throwing up, I became</B>
<BR><B>increasing nervous and wanted to get as far away from Marsh Road
as</B>
<BR><B>possible.&nbsp; It was then that we turned the corner and all started
screaming.</B>
<BR><B>At the dead end, in the very center of the road there was a man,
on his</B>
<BR><B>knees with his chest and head facing the sky, with his arms out
to the side.</B>
<BR><B>It was almost as if he was praying. Animals of every kind, deer,
rabbits,</B>
<BR><B>squirrels, you name it, were flocking towards him from the surrounding</B>
<BR><B>fields.&nbsp; He did not respond to us, the approaching car, he
just continued to</B>
<BR><B>face the sky.&nbsp; My friends were all screaming, and yelling at
Stanley to the</B>
<BR><B>truck turned around and to leave.&nbsp; I couldn't help but look
at the man.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>strained my eyes and as hard as I tried I could not see a face,
it was if</B>
<BR><B>that part of his head was blurred out.&nbsp; We got the truck turned
around and</B>
<BR><B>passed the bridge and began driving really fast to get out of there.&nbsp;
One</B>
<BR><B>friend in the car was crying, the rest of us were to scared to talk.&nbsp;
As we</B>
<BR><B>approached an upcoming corner my heart began to race and I got a
terrible</B>
<BR><B>feeling that something awful was about to happen.&nbsp; I begged
Stanley to slow</B>
<BR><B>down, and announced how I was feeling.&nbsp; He slowed down.&nbsp;
As we rounded the</B>
<BR><B>corner Kristen again screamed out "Look!" as she pointed off the
embankment.</B>
<BR><B>There was a wrecked car, that looked as if it had went of the hillside</B>
<BR><B>backwards.&nbsp; Its headlights were still on, and it looked as
if the car was</B>
<BR><B>still running.&nbsp; Although it was a fresh accident, we didn't
stop to see if</B>
<BR><B>everyone was okay, due to how scared we all were.&nbsp; We saw no
one walking</B>
<BR><B>around, and decided we'd call 911 as soon our cell phones got service.&nbsp;
We</B>
<BR><B>all began talking, wondering if the white truck had possibly ran
them off of</B>
<BR><B>the road.</B>
<BR><B>We reached service, Kristen called to report an accident.&nbsp;
She left the</B>
<BR><B>report anonymous, fearing they would question why we didn't stop
and help.</B>
<BR><B>We initially decided not to report the man at the end of the road
either,</B>
<BR><B>reasoning that they would take the call as a prank.&nbsp; After
we had all calmed</B>
<BR><B>down, and sworn of ghost hunting, Stanley dropped everyone off at
their</B>
<BR><B>houses.&nbsp; We returned back to his house, and I called to check
up on the</B>
<BR><B>wreck.&nbsp; When I called the dispatcher gave me the number that
I could do the</B>
<BR><B>follow up with.&nbsp; I called and a woman notified me that officers
were sent</B>
<BR><B>out and have located the car, which still had keys in the ignition
and was</B>
<BR><B>still running when found, but could not locate and driver or passengers.</B>
<BR><B>They were currently searching the whereabouts for the car's occupants.
I</B>
<BR><B>told Stanley what she told me, and we decided we should tell them
about the</B>
<BR><B>man at the end of the road.&nbsp; I called again, and explained
the story.&nbsp; She</B>
<BR><B>questioned whether or not we were involved in the accident, and
took down</B>
<BR><B>our names and number.&nbsp; Stanley and I were still freaked out
and thought it</B>
<BR><B>would be a good idea if we just went to bed and tried to relax.&nbsp;
We agreed</B>
<BR><B>that we would call in the morning and follow up then.&nbsp; We I
woke up the</B>
<BR><B>first thing I did was reach for the phone.&nbsp; I called and another
woman</B>
<BR><B>answered the phone.&nbsp; I explained why I was calling as she began
to ask me</B>
<BR><B>where I had gotten the phone number.&nbsp; I told her, and she began
yelling at</B>
<BR><B>me.&nbsp; She told me it was a police line and civilians were not
to have access</B>
<BR><B>to it.&nbsp; I apologized and explained that the night prior a different
woman</B>
<BR><B>gave me updates on the accident that I reported.&nbsp; She told
me that this</B>
<BR><B>simply wasn't possible because they are not to give out police investigation</B>
<BR><B>information.&nbsp; She refused to give me any information, and I
got off the</B>
<BR><B>phone, without any further information.</B>
<BR><B>We all checked police reports, and watched the news, never learning</B>
<BR><B>anything else about that night on Marsh Road.&nbsp; It definitely
creeped us all</B>
<BR><B>out.&nbsp; Our ghost hunting days are over.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hauntings in Blue Mounds, Wisconsin</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: pridenlove_1984@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have lived in Blue Mounds for almost eight years now and throughout
those eight years I have experienced paranormal behavior and heard many
stories from others with similar experiences. Here are a few stories and
a little background on Blue Mounds itself.</B>
<BR><B>Back in the 1800's Blue Mounds was called Pokerville it was what
you could call a boom town. The railroad ran through it at one time but
pulled out quite some time ago (no exact dates known). There were several
general stores in town and I happen to live in one of them. Being as my
house is around a hundred years old and being the believer that I am, I
expected to encounter some sort of ghostly activity. I often do not feel
alone in my home even when there are no other living beings around. I believe
that there are two spirits residing in my home although why they are there
and what their stories are I do not know. There is a elderly male who simply
watches and is not noticeable in any other way than feeling a presence.
The other is a small child, a girl I believe, who, like most small children
is mischievious. I was at home alone one day (or so I thought), getting
ready to go out. I was upstairs getting ready and I heard I loud noise
downstairs as if a door had been slammed with great force. I went downstairs
to investigate, thinking that my father or one of my brothers had come
home, there was noone in the house although I checked everywhere. I continued
getting ready, downstairs this time and was in the living ro when a loud
thump came from above my head, which was my brothers room, I once again
investigated and once again there was noone in the home with me. I was
totally confused by this time, but I went back downstairs. I was standing
at the table in the dining room when the most disturbing thing of all happened,
I heard a noise, the laughter of a small child actually, and all of the
hairs on the back of my neck stood up and I was enveloped in coldness.
I immediatly left the house to wait outside for my ride. Noone else has
had a similar experience although my family has felt presences in the house.</B>
<BR><B>My next story revolves around another home in Blue Mounds that was
at the time of the story a Saloon. The home is next to the old opera house
and they were at one time adjoined by a tunnel. I myself have never experienced
this but I know several people who live in the home's now separate apartments
that have seen the same thing. There was a woman and her small son using
the tunnel to go from one building to the other when a fight broke out
in the saloon and somehow moved to the tunnel. Guns were drawn, shots fired
and the woman and her child were caught in the crossfire and killed. A
resident of one apartment was in the basement (where the beginning of the
tunnel is still evident) when they looked towards the stairs they saw a
small boy in overalls, a white button up shirt and a cap walk out of the
remaining piece of the tunnel and walk up the stairs. A person in another
aparment hada a similar experience as well. His clothes were not of this
time period.</B>

<P><B>Grandpa</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: candraa@bellsouth.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I really haven’t got to know my grandfather because he died when
I was real young.</B>
<BR><B>I began to hang around with the wrong crowd and begin to get on
a lot of trouble.</B>
<BR><B>This is also the time that I began to disrespect my mother.&nbsp;
He would always tell</B>
<BR><B>Me to obey her and respect he. One night while I was asleep I was
awaken by someone</B>
<BR><B>One standing over my bed. I awoke to be looking at my grandfather,
he just looked at me</B>
<BR><B>He tried to tell me something but I could not understand. I tried
to tell him that I miss him but he just faded away.</B>
<BR><B>I awoke and told the family what had happened. No one believed me
but I took it as a lesson and obeyed him after that</B>
<BR><B>That I never saw him again</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ghost Room</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Jsyzn@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first experience&nbsp;
with&nbsp; a ghost was&nbsp; when&nbsp; I&nbsp; first&nbsp; move&nbsp;
in&nbsp; my&nbsp; new</B>
<BR><B>house, which seems&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; really&nbsp; old. I&nbsp;
woke&nbsp; up&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; middle&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp;
night&nbsp; to&nbsp; go&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; bathroom. When&nbsp; I&nbsp;
came&nbsp; back&nbsp; to&nbsp; go&nbsp; to&nbsp; sleep&nbsp; something&nbsp;
enter&nbsp; my&nbsp; room. I&nbsp; was&nbsp; so&nbsp; scare&nbsp; I&nbsp;
could&nbsp; not&nbsp; move, think, or&nbsp; even&nbsp; talk. I felt&nbsp;
like&nbsp; something&nbsp; was&nbsp; wachting&nbsp; me.&nbsp; It&nbsp;
started&nbsp; singing&nbsp; and&nbsp; then&nbsp; it&nbsp; left. The&nbsp;
next&nbsp; morning&nbsp; I&nbsp; told&nbsp; a&nbsp; person&nbsp; that&nbsp;
lives&nbsp; with&nbsp; me, thinking&nbsp; it&nbsp; was&nbsp; a&nbsp; dream.
What&nbsp; is&nbsp; weird&nbsp; is&nbsp; that&nbsp; she&nbsp; told&nbsp;
me&nbsp; that&nbsp; someone&nbsp; had&nbsp; come&nbsp; in&nbsp; her&nbsp;
room&nbsp; at&nbsp; night&nbsp; and&nbsp; told&nbsp; her&nbsp; to&nbsp;
take&nbsp; his&nbsp; hand. She&nbsp; said&nbsp; that&nbsp; he&nbsp; was&nbsp;
wearing&nbsp; a&nbsp; red&nbsp; jacket&nbsp; and&nbsp; a hat. Five&nbsp;
days&nbsp; after&nbsp; I&nbsp; saw&nbsp;&nbsp; it&nbsp; came&nbsp; in&nbsp;
my&nbsp; room&nbsp; againg&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; exact&nbsp; description.
Now&nbsp; whe just&nbsp; try&nbsp; ignoring&nbsp; it&nbsp; and&nbsp; now
and then whe hear the&nbsp; stairs wreak and&nbsp; the&nbsp; doors&nbsp;
open and&nbsp; let&nbsp; me&nbsp; tell&nbsp; you&nbsp; is&nbsp; realy&nbsp;
scary.</B>

<P><B>The Whispering in my Room</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Crystal12780@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>One night i was laying in my bed fixing to go to sleep. The way i
was laying, i was facing my closet door. But my bed was on the other side
of the room. I had closed my eyes and heard this noise coming from over
there. Well, i made myself believe it was coming from a branch scracting
on my window. Even though i knew it wasn't coming from that direction.
It sounded like somebody whispering. Well, i opened my eyes and looked
around but didn't see a thing. So i turned my back towards my closet and
was about to go to sleep, when all of a sudden the noise was right in my
ear and it was so loud it made my ear jump. That really freaked me out
a lot. I through my covers over my head and prayed for it to go away and
not to touch me or anything. Then i got this really bad feeling that it
was laying right next to me in my bed. I just kept praying and finally
i didn't feel it there anymore. It was a really horrible feeling. It really
scared me . I don't know if it was trying to talk to me or not. But i couldn't
understand it. I'm glad it left though.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Man</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: iwantturkey@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; my grandfather always told me and my cozins about experiences
that he had</B>
<BR><B>had with ghosts. this first sparked my interest, and i became fascinated</B>
<BR><B>with ghosts and other paranormal activity. however i never really
wanted to</B>
<BR><B>see a ghost i just liked hearing other peoples stories about strange</B>
<BR><B>happenings.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; our family lived
in the city for most of my life and when the</B>
<BR><B>decision was made to move to the country i couldn't have been happier.
we</B>
<BR><B>quickly moved onto an old farm. there was a ranch house and a huge
barn.</B>
<BR><B>both the barn and the ranch house had been rebuilt just 10 years
earlier and</B>
<BR><B>were in great condition. the stalls in the barn were made of cedar
and oak</B>
<BR><B>and the isles of the barn were made of beautiful interlocked brick.
i loved</B>
<BR><B>it here and for the first time in my life i loved where i i lived.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it wasn't long before things started happenings
though. the first time</B>
<BR><B>that i felt something was when i&nbsp; was in the barn tacking up
my horse and</B>
<BR><B>getting ready for a hack with a boy that i had met from down the
road. well</B>
<BR><B>there was a cellar entrance just below the cross ties that had bee
bolted</B>
<BR><B>shut. the barn was built on the old foundation so this cellar was
from the</B>
<BR><B>original barn that had been built over 100 years ago. my horse started
to</B>
<BR><B>freak out, he was rearing and trying to break free. i tried every
thing i</B>
<BR><B>could think of to clam him down but he continued to rear. i finally
got him</B>
<BR><B>off the cross ties and into his stall which was at the other end
of the</B>
<BR><B>isle. he quickly calmed down. i decided to take out my moms horse
insted. i</B>
<BR><B>put him on the same cross ties and started to tack him up. after
about ten</B>
<BR><B>minutes he started to freak out like my horse had done before. i
was a</B>
<BR><B>little rattled and put him back into his stall. he quickly calmed
down. i</B>
<BR><B>decided to just wait for Brian, the boy that i was going riding
with and</B>
<BR><B>then he could help me tack up. he was much taller and stronger then
me so i</B>
<BR><B>figured it would be easier for him to handle the horses if the freaked
out</B>
<BR><B>again.</B>
<BR><B>i sat on a tack box and ate a candy bar while i was waiting for
him. i had</B>
<BR><B>been sitting there for about 5 mins. when i heard a loud moaning
coming from</B>
<BR><B>the cellar. i knew it couldn't be an animal that had become trapped
in the</B>
<BR><B>cellar because there was no way of opening it. i turned off the
radio and</B>
<BR><B>listened for it again. it started this time louder and the cellar
entrance</B>
<BR><B>started to move slightly up and down. next i did something stupid,
i began</B>
<BR><B>to ask if anyone was in there and needed my help. the voice just
kept</B>
<BR><B>moaning and sounded like it was in pain. i ran up to the house to
get my</B>
<BR><B>cousin who had been staying with us and she came down to listen.
by the time</B>
<BR><B>we got back to the cellar door the voice had stopped. Brian was
just</B>
<BR><B>arriving and asked what we were doing. i told him&nbsp; what i had
heard and he</B>
<BR><B>told me that that last owners had heard the same thing when they
were</B>
<BR><B>building the barn but it had stopped once the barn was finished.
we decided</B>
<BR><B>to cancel the ride and try to open the cellar. i was soon to find
out that</B>
<BR><B>this was not the brightest thing to do. we spent the better half
of our day</B>
<BR><B>getting the cellar door open and sent brian in to see what was in
there.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; the only thing that we found was an old book, and a table
with three</B>
<BR><B>chairs around it. the weirdest thing though was the table and chairs
had no</B>
<BR><B>dust on them and the book was opened like someone had been reading
it. there</B>
<BR><B>were also foot prints in the dirt and they seemed fresh. we decided
that it</B>
<BR><B>would be a good idea to bolt up the cellar again and leave it alone.</B>
<BR><B>whatever was down there was gone now.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; that night Brian and his friend stayed the night. we stayed
up until about</B>
<BR><B>2&nbsp; am, and i decided to go to bed. i woke up at about 6 am
to feed my rats</B>
<BR><B>and then go back to sleep. it was mid-summer so when i woke up it
was very</B>
<BR><B>bright in my room. i looked at my clock and then got up to feed
them . when</B>
<BR><B>i returned i went to bed and went to turn of my light. when i rolled
back</B>
<BR><B>over to go to sleep. i saw a face of a man looking straight at me.
he looked</B>
<BR><B>like he was upset about something. i screamed and pulled the covers
over my</B>
<BR><B>head. Brain and his friend had heard me and ran into my room. the
man wasn't</B>
<BR><B>there anymore and i mention anything about it because i didn't think
that</B>
<BR><B>they would believe me. i just went back to sleep and didn't see
anything for</B>
<BR><B>a couple of weeks.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in september the things started
happening again. it was always the</B>
<BR><B>same man that i had seen a couple of weeks before. i was lying one
the couch</B>
<BR><B>with Brian who was now my boyfriend. and we both heard a women's
voice when</B>
<BR><B>we looked back to see who was calling us something cold and clammy
pushed</B>
<BR><B>our heads down and i felt paralyzed.i couldn't</B>
<BR><B>'t move and it felt like something was sitting on my chest. i was
lying down</B>
<BR><B>and i felt something walk through me starting at my head and ending
at my</B>
<BR><B>feet. it felt like cold pins and needles as it went through me then
it just</B>
<BR><B>disappeared and i could move again. i talked to brian about it and
he felt</B>
<BR><B>the same thing.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; since that i have not felt the ghost that we have named
fred, but i see</B>
<BR><B>him every night. he wanders around the house and interacts with
it like it a</B>
<BR><B>different house. my parents have not seen him but brian and my cozin
have</B>
<BR><B>all seen him . we think that it may have something to do with the
cellar.</B>
<BR><B>and that that is why the horse freaked out when they were made to
stand over</B>
<BR><B>the cellar door. we are planning on having the house blessed and
hope that</B>
<BR><B>that will stop it. we have tried talking to him and asking what
he wants but</B>
<BR><B>he will not talk back, and h=if he does on the rare occasion we
can not</B>
<BR><B>understand him. he still scares me and i end up at Brian's house
scared out</B>
<BR><B>of my mind in the middle of the night at least once a week.</B><B></B>

<P><B>THE HAUNTED WOODS</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jason9820@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>The woods behind kiester elementary school are haunted I have always
suspected that they were haunted but until recently I was never quite sure
first off I will give you the legend of the haunting.&nbsp; Back in the
1960's a man went into the woods and was never seen again all that was
found was his coat and a bloody knife was also found but that was not believed
to be his.&nbsp; Now almost 45 years later the mystery is still unsolved.</B>
<BR><B>I have always believed that the woods are haunted but it really
wasn't until 2003 that I started getting really interested in finding out
if the woods are haunted in the in the winter of 2001 my friends and I
started searching the woods for clues as to whether the woods were in fact
haunted or just a load of crap but the first night we went into the woods
we really didn't see anything but we had a feeling that we were not the
only one's in there and two nights later we went back into the woods and
I was the one that was the most shaken in my mind In kept seeing a white
face with bright red eyes now I didn't see this in person but the thought
of it kept me from going any further and my friends were also afraid to
go any further as well.&nbsp; In early 2002 a friend and I went in to the
woods and he is one of those macho nothing can scare me type but when we
went into the woods we saw a white light much like a lantern being carried
by unseen hands and we followed the light to a point where the trail (that
is built into the woods) ends and then there was a bright flash of light
and a then we heard a demonic laugh needless to say we were out of those
woods before we really knew what had just happened and as we got in my
car and as I turned on the headlights they shined across an old baseball
field that is just below the woods and both of us saw what appeared to
be a hooded figure walking out of the woods. This is the only time that
I felt threatened in the woods and what made me really think that there
is an evil presense in there</B>
<BR><B>We pretty much left it go until early 2003 my friend and I went
in daylight and this is one place that is creepy no matter what time you
go in adn the whole time we were in there we felt like we were being watched
and there were times when I swore that heard foot steps following us.&nbsp;
In march of 2003 I went in to the woods alone and I took some photograghs
and it was just before sunset and I just ramdomly took pictures and wasn't
really expecting anything to show up on them and when I walked up to the
point where my friend and I saw the the bright flash and heard the laugh
I took a picture and then I just turn and before I knew anything I took
off running and to this day I still don't know why I ran out of the woods
and then two weeks later I got the pictures back and saw that many of the
shots had orbs in them and after closer examination I saw that some had
two or more in them and there are two pictures that had what appeared to
be faces and in the photo I took just before running out of the woods had
a vague form in a hood possibly the form my friend and I saw.</B>
<BR><B>Most recently my friend and I went into the woods in October of
2003 and we saw a mist like appperition at the dead end trail and then
the trail that we were on started to fill up with mist and my Friend started
to look at me perplexed and I said lets go and just as we turned to run
it got cold and I mead bone chilling cold and it was a rather warm day
about 70 degrees and on that trail it was about 30 degrees we could even
see our breaths it was scarywe didn't see anything and I am not sure if
we wanted to.&nbsp; That is my story about the haunted woods I hope you
enjoyed it</B>

<P><B>Spirit Bird</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: krosario@shiprightsolutions.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am 27 years old and remember this day vividly. It happen back in
Junior</B>
<BR><B>High, my best friend Marcia and myself were walking home from school
on a</B>
<BR><B>Friday in June (last few weeks of class) when we found a small hurt
bird.</B>
<BR><B>( I am not sure what kind of bird it was ), but we brought it to
my house</B>
<BR><B>and my mother told us it had to stay outside on the back porch,
so we put</B>
<BR><B>the bird in an old hamster cage and gave it food and water. That
night</B>
<BR><B>Marcia was sleeping over. The bird was still alive and we said goodnight.
My</B>
<BR><B>mom said that the bird had to stay outdoors, so Marcia and myself
put the</B>
<BR><B>bird (hamster) cage up against my bedroom window. This was possible
because</B>
<BR><B>the pouch railing connected to the house right under my bedroom
window. That</B>
<BR><B>night we were up late gossiping, like many young girls. Slowly we
got</B>
<BR><B>sleepy, and start drifting off. My bed is located in the corner,
I had my</B>
<BR><B>bedroom bureau on one side and a wall on the other, then at the
foot of the</B>
<BR><B>bed was my double wide closet with sliding doors, which I tended
to leave</B>
<BR><B>one side open. As we drift to sleep (it was well past midnight)
I heard an</B>
<BR><B>odd sound inside my bedroom ( I am a very light sleeper) and I sat
up in bed</B>
<BR><B>( so I am facing the closet) inside the closet was a yellow light
moving</B>
<BR><B>back and forth from one side of the closet to the other, in a very
rapid</B>
<BR><B>motion. I was startled and scared, but also was a little disorientated</B>
<BR><B>because I was sleeping, so I woke up Marcia and asked if she saw
what I saw</B>
<BR><B>( I whispered this) Marcia looked at the closet and said yes she
did, we</B>
<BR><B>both laid there and watched the yellow light for a few more minutes
before</B>
<BR><B>it made a jolt and shot straight up, through my ceiling and disappeared.
The</B>
<BR><B>next morning we both woke up to find the little bird dead in his
cage ( he</B>
<BR><B>died over night), this was sad, but we both knew the night before
he said</B>
<BR><B>thank you for taking care of him in his last hours. We buried the
bird later</B>
<BR><B>that day in my back yard, but I never saw his spirit again. Feel
free to</B>
<BR><B>email me with any questions or comments.</B>

<P><B>Hi. My name is Amy. I'm 12 years old. Once when I was nine it was
thunder-storming outside and I couldn't fall asleep. I heard the sliding
glass door open downstairs. At first I thought it was my brother , who
had moved out earlier that summer. But then I realized he would have told
my parents that he was coming. I heard a man's footsteps coming up the
stairs. Next, I heard rummiging in the kitchen. Then I heard footsteps
coming down the hall and I saw the shadow of a man. All of sudden he stopped
and turned around and walked back. I heard more rummiging in the kitchen
and the footsteps going downstairs then the sliding glass door shut. In
the morning the kitchen was missing some items and was a mess. I don't
know what or who it was but it was freaky.</B>

<P><B>My Mother's Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jennybeth032@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have only one potential ghost encounter and it wasn't a visual
one.&nbsp; I was living with an uncle in Richmond, VA in an older large
colonial style home.&nbsp; On Thanksgiving I was waiting on him to come
home because we were going to go see a movie.&nbsp; The entrance we use
was at the back of the house directly over the laundry room where I was
doing laundry.&nbsp; I heard the door open and close and I heard footsteps
which sounded like they were leading to the staircase going to the upper
floors of the house.&nbsp; I finished what I was doing and went up to my
own room which was on the third story of the house (3rd story not including
basement/laundry room.)&nbsp; I didn't hear anything coming from my uncle's
room so I went downstairs to look out the window overlooking the driveway
to make sure that he actually had come home.&nbsp; The driveway was empty
except my own car.&nbsp; No one had been there.&nbsp; Just after I noticed
this, I heard beeps from the alarm keypad and I heard it say "Alarm System
Off."&nbsp; Since I was only 1 level above the alarm system keypad I went
down to see who had operated it.&nbsp; Again, no one was there.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I still don't know what had happened.&nbsp; A week later a coworker of
mine came home with me and said she didn't like the feeling she got from
that house and she wondered aloud how I could feel safe sleeping there.&nbsp;
She thought she felt a distinct evil presence there.&nbsp; I don't know
what kind of justification that really is of my story, but that's the order
in which it happened.</B>
<BR><B>Now my mother has actually witnessed a few ghostly presences, visually.&nbsp;
When she was about 9 and her sister Tricia was 12 they lived in Massachusettes
somewhere outside of Boston though I can't remember the exact name of the
town.&nbsp; My grandparents had gone out because it was New Year's Eve.&nbsp;
Before they had come home my mom woke up to the sound of Tricia's muffled
screams.&nbsp; She looked over (they shared a bedroom) and there was something
white and floating over Tricia nearly suffocating her.&nbsp; My mom was
shocked of course and started screaming.&nbsp; As soon as she screamed
whatever it was disappeared.&nbsp; At some other time my mom believes she
saw someone wearing a Revolutionary Era soldier's uniform walk through
the kitchen of that same house.&nbsp; She couldn't say whether or not it
may have been the same presence.</B>
<BR><B>Another story my mom has told me is a little more recent.&nbsp;
She and my step dad moved into a new house in Oldfield, MO about 10 years
ago.&nbsp; She woke up because she thought she heard something like a plastic
bag rattling around the house.&nbsp; She turned over and opened her eyes
to see a blue eyed baby staring back at her.&nbsp; It was on level with
her because they had just slept with their mattresses on the floor since
it was their first night in the house..&nbsp; She decided to try to go
back to sleep and shake off what she had seen and decided to wait until
morning before she mentioned this to my step dad.&nbsp; My step dad woke
up the next morning and told her he had a dream about a baby with blue
eyes.&nbsp; They never saw it again as far as I know after their first
night in the house.</B>
<BR><B>There are many more stories that I have heard from other people
but these are the ones I know best.&nbsp; I hope they are useful to your
collection.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I Never see it Anymore</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: dbrink1@swfla.rr.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>HI, I am Abby. I used to live in this apartment complex that has
2 sections to it. Britt, Katie, Kathy, and I were all just sitting in a
breezeway talking about ya know girl stuff, this was 2 years ago, it’s
day time about 1 or 2 in the afternoon. Well, Britt just gets all quiet
and is staring at the ground right next to one of the buildings. We all
ask her what is wrong and she told us that she can see something walking
towards us in the breezeway. All of us turn and look and all I can see
is footprints in the grass. Brittany got up and told us we should go. Then
what ever it was just sat down in the grass and you could see it sit because
the grass went down like someone was sitting there. We all got up and run
up to the second floor of the building that we were sitting in and we looked
down and it was still there. Then it wasn’t there any more and then we
heard steps coming up the stairs behind all of us. Britt told us to run
because for some reason she could only see it but all of us knew it was
there. So we ran to Britt’s apartment and we told her mom about it and
she didn’t believe us. Well Britt has a cat named Patches and it was walking
down the hallway in here apartment and she&nbsp; stopped and stared at
the door, then her hair just got all puffed on her back and I just saw
it come through the door right after us. It scared me so badly. We all
grabbed our shoes and ran to my apartment and we all just were out of breath.
We stayed there for awhile and it never came over there. That same spirit
still follows Britt and Katie around but they are not as afraid of it as
we all were when it followed us for the first time. I moved away from there
so I never see it anymore.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Mountain Station Cemetery</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: roger@marinedev.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a cemetery out near Higgins,OK
called Mountain Station.&nbsp; It sits on a stretch of road that was once
said to be a passage on an old mail route back in the 1800's.&nbsp; Rumor
has it that a witch is buried there.&nbsp; supposedly there is a curse
written on her grave stone and bad things happen to anyone who reads it
and they will be cursed.&nbsp; I have been there several times and have
never seen it.&nbsp; However...there is a covered pavilion that sits in
the middle of the cemetery.&nbsp; Late at night if you park in the road
and turn your car off you can see strange pink, red, and white lights dancing
around in the grass by the pavilion.&nbsp; When we went my car wouldnt
start when the lites appeared.&nbsp; There is an old indian grave on the
lower front side of the hill.&nbsp; It is just a mound of earth surrounded
by a wall of stones.&nbsp; My friend tripped while standing inside this
wall and when she got up her wrists were covered in what appeared to be
claw marks.&nbsp; To get there head east on highway 270. go past hartshorne,ok
and keep driving.&nbsp; you will be in the middle of nowhere.&nbsp; probably
12-15 miles past hartshorne, or 35-45 minutes east of mcalester. you will
turn left on damon valley road.&nbsp; when the road forks, bear left.&nbsp;
you'll find it.&nbsp; you cant miss the huge white gates. it's in the middle
of the wilderness. happy hunting!!!!</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; My Fathers Tale</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ilakeram@sprint.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi my name is Ian and
i wrote here quite a few times before i have my latest story posted on
page 255 called&nbsp; My Experinces Continue</B>
<BR><B>I&nbsp; first have a story to tell that is not mine but my fathers.</B>
<BR><B>i heard this story when i was younger and remembered it but not
to all well so i was telling my sister about it then she told my mom and
dad when theyy were at the kitchen table and my mom made him tell us the
story because he was hesataint too it's not really a long story but it
kinda spooked me.</B>
<BR><B>when my mom's mother died. My parents went to go see her and stuff
you know, it was in Guyana a country in South America because that is where
they are from. Anyways The day my Grandmothers dead body was out on the
varanda that the house has probally waiting to be shipped off somewhere
else i don't really know.</B>
<BR><B>But anyways my mom said my dad was nowhere to be seen that day and
she needed help since i was over there too and was little and she had to
also take care of my little cousins and evrything , whiles he was out somewhere
drinking.</B>
<BR><B>Anyways he eventually came home it was night time and lots of people
were in the house my mom, my grandfather, my, aunts , my uncles , and myself
of course. i don't know how many people to be exact but my mom has 4 brothers
and 3 sisters i don't know if anyone besides who i metioned was there,</B>
<BR><B>Evryone was downstairs in the house, he decided to go upstairs and
sleep because he was drunk and it wasn't that noisy upstairs he went out
to the varanda to sleep , now the varanda doesn't have any rails or bars
to hold anything.</B>
<BR><B>He says as he was lying down something pushed him off the edge of
the varanda my mom said it was really high that he could of that he said
somehow he managed to grab on to the edge of it and letting himself fall
in a safer way. my mom said that he came trough the front door and evryone
was bewildered because they saw him go up to bed. i could just picture
the look on their faces when he told them what happend.</B>
<BR><B>He says he didn't get a view of the person because it was dark ,
evryone in the house was downstairs except for him my mom said and no one
would try to kill him that was in the house..</B>
<BR><B>My mom and him believe that it was my Grandmother , my mom said
becuase my dad and mom had an argument that day and my grandmother wanted
to kill him hoping that my mom would stay in Guyana and not come back to
Canada.</B>
<BR><B>Jokingly my mom was asking him you think maybe you were too drunk
and fell off yourself and he said No he felt someone push him off and he
isn't the type of person who believes in those kinda things (ghosts)&nbsp;
but i believe he knows what happened to him and will hold on to his story
because something or someone tried to take his life that night........</B>
<BR><B>Now for My recent stories it is now the 24th of Jan and the 25 of
last yr something came for me im really wondering if it will happen again
because lately i have been hearing frequent noises in my house .</B>
<BR><B>One morning i was alone in the house my parents work and my sister
was at skool i work with an agency so i don't have work evryday some days
im at home but anyways getting back to the story i was at home in bed just
about to drift off when i heard from the room im sitting in now which has
the comp a noise i knew what the noise was my my keyboard has a rest im
sure evryone knows what im talking about the thing the keyboard rests on
well mine is a sliding one , and if i were to push it back and forth it
would make a noise if i were to push it with force all the way back or
to the front it would make a louder distinctive noise,&nbsp; well as i
started drifting off i heard it like some one pushed it with force and
i know the exact sound my bed is right next to my window and it didn't
sound at all like the noise came from outside it sounded like that noise
came right from where i am typing right now.</B>
<BR><B>Anyways my first thought was that somebody broke in the house.&nbsp;
So i got up to check but no body had broken in the house and no one was
there to be seen. anyways at that point i started thinking maybe the noise
did come from somewhere else but part of me thought differently in the
sense of</B>
<BR><B>( i know what i heard )&nbsp; anyways im out of bed now i decide
to brush my theeth and eat and go watch some tv about 2 hours pass then
i feel tired and want to go back to bed so i do and believe it or not i
totally forgot about the noise i heard that got me out of bed in the first
place anyways this time im awake tired but awake i had my eyes closed and
then i heard the noise again. this time louder. at that point i knew it
was "something" but i was too tired to bother with it so i just went to
sleep.</B>
<BR><B>this one happened over the recent holidays it was night time i was
in bed my parents in their room and bed and my younger sister downstairs
watching tv now i had just waken up from a dream and was just lying their
then a heard a big huge bang sound like someone banged the wall in the
next room which was my sisters room so i got up to check and she wasn't
in their i checked she was downstairs watching tv and she isn't a person
who walks around in the dark so i know that couldn't of been her i still
asked her if she was there though and she said no and my parent were both
in their bed sleeping.</B>
<BR><B>it was about 4am .</B>
<BR><B>also recentley i have been seeing lots of stuff out the corners
of my eyes more than before not the regular stuff you sometimes see something
out the corner and be suprised by it but this happens alot so i know for
a fact something is once again trying to communicate with me but im just
wandering what or who it could be.</B>
<BR><B>Anyways thanx for listening to my stories i hope you guys post this
, thanx</B>
<BR><B>It's good to know there is a place where you can come and let it
all out.......</B><B></B>

<P><B>I HAVE A GHOST....I THINK</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: wokesmeed024@yahoo.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>My mother has a house that we moved into in 1998 when I was 14.
This is in Olathe, KS,&nbsp; When we moved in the real estate agent said
that the house was 97 years old, so now in 2004 it would be 103 years old.
My room was downstairs, the very first bedroom to the left when you walked
in the front door. Neither I nor anyone in my family had experienced anything
before I did.</B>
<BR><B>This happened the very first time in the summer of&nbsp; 1999 when&nbsp;
I was lying down in my room trying to fall asleep. All of the lights were
off except for a blacklight that i always kept on when in bed.&nbsp; I
dont know why I even decided to look, but my ceiling fan in my room had
a string on it to switch it on and off and it was swinging back and forth.
No windows or doors were open to let in any drafts at all. I closed my
eyes again trying to let myself believe it was only my imagination, but
i opened them again, and there was a boy standing at the foot of my bed,
leaning over the railings and trying to put something in my mouth. I got
scared and swiped my hand at him and he disappeared.&nbsp; He looked like
a regular teenage boy with blond hair, although he was transparent. He
was wearing a striped t shirt.</B>
<BR><B>After that incident i didnt see him again until the next summer
in my brothers room where i was sleeping at the time. i was on a couch
and he was standing at the foot of it just looking at me. i closed my eyes
and when i opened them he was gone.</B>
<BR><B>The third and last encounter with the boy wasnt until september
of 2001. i suppose i didnt see him during the summer of that year, like
the last two, because i had been moved out of my mothers house at that
time. I was just staying the nite when the last encounter occured.</B>
<BR><B>I was sleeping on the couch downstairs in the living room and woke
up to see him sitting on the foot of the couch just staring at me. this
time i didnt get scared, just rolled over and went back to sleep. i knew
that if he had wanted to hurt me (if he even can, i dunno) he would have
done so already.</B>
<BR><B>I dont know if this has anything to do with the ghost, but during
the summer of 2001 my boyfriend and i were at my mothers alone and i left
him downstairs by himself for a minute. i ran upstairs to grab something
and i heard him yelling up the stairs to me to stop messing with him. i
asked him what he was talking about and he said he heard some growling
coming from the kitchen and thought it was me playing a trick.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Weird, huh?</B><B></B>

<P><B>Harrisburg - The Fire Woman</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Brwayne513@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;.</B>
<BR><B>An older woman died in a fire during the 1950's and has been there
in spirit ever since. Her name remains a mystery but her actions tell the
story. An unknown cause of a fire caused extensive damage to most of the
building at 517 Briggs St. near the State Capital Building. In time, the
historic building roughly 100 years old was remodeled and others lived
in the place. A recent fire took place on the third floor which could be
attributed to The Fire Woman. It was said the tenant was cooking early
one morning and left the room for a moment. Flames soon engulfed the kitchen
and most of their apartment. Smoke damage affected most of the other building.
I was chatting with my neighbor in the first floor corner apartment while
wiping down the walls of smoke stain. He related the facts included in
this posting and told of many objects which had moved about the room untouched
since living there. One could research the name of the active spirit by
way of Harrisburg Fire Department Records dating back to that time.</B>

<BR><B>Hardware Store</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:michael.caylor@auab.aorcentaf.af.mil</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;Two years ago I received a call from my buddy from back home
in</B>
<BR><B>Oshkosh, Wisconsin; he had been employed by one of the large chain
hardware</B>
<BR><B>stores as a custodian working late at night.&nbsp; This particular
store was</B>
<BR><B>brand new barely open a few months when he got the job, well while
on the</B>
<BR><B>phone he proceeded to tell me that he had heard and seen unexplainable</B>
<BR><B>things late during the night and he began to believe that the store
was</B>
<BR><B>haunted.</B>
<BR><B>A couple months later I took leave to go home to visit my family
and</B>
<BR><B>friends, I later ran into my buddy and curiously asking how his
new job is</B>
<BR><B>going and if he's figured out what's going on ghost wise at his
job.&nbsp; Well</B>
<BR><B>he still had no explanation on what's going on only that things
have</B>
<BR><B>escalated, he began telling me stories of doors rattling and voices
being</B>
<BR><B>heard after store hours.&nbsp; Me being intrigued I could not pass
up such and</B>
<BR><B>opportunity, I asked him to allow me to accompany him to work, he
agreed but</B>
<BR><B>I had to make myself useful and help out.</B>
<BR><B>A couple nights later I had met him outside his apartment it was
about 08:30</B>
<BR><B>at night, we both jumped into his car and left, on the way there
we stopped</B>
<BR><B>by his parents house to pick up his dad, who also worked the same
job soon</B>
<BR><B>after that we pulled up into the parking lot.</B>
<BR><B>At 09:00 we were locked in the store alone and to save money the
store cut</B>
<BR><B>half of the usual lights so it appeared really dark.&nbsp; I, being
curious</B>
<BR><B>ventured off by myself with nothing more than a floor scrapper,
scrapping</B>
<BR><B>off stickers and any gum that found.&nbsp; As I walked around the
semi dark store</B>
<BR><B>nothing happened, I was quiet and I did not feel anything and I
was</B>
<BR><B>beginning to get bummed out.&nbsp; A few hours had passed and I
still hadn't seen</B>
<BR><B>or heard a thing, until we decided to take a break.&nbsp; I was
sitting in the</B>
<BR><B>customer/employee break area, which happened to be in the middle
of the</B>
<BR><B>store.&nbsp; My buddy and his father were reading the newspaper
and I was</B>
<BR><B>drinking coffee, when I looked over to see someone standing at the
window</B>
<BR><B>toward the back of the store.&nbsp; I said to my buddy, "Hay there's
someone at</B>
<BR><B>the window" he turned around and turned back saying "that's not
a window"</B>
<BR><B>only it was window but on display, sitting on a pallet and behind
it was the</B>
<BR><B>back of the store wall.&nbsp; Surprised I sat there staring at this
reflection as</B>
<BR><B>my buddy and his father went back to reading the paper.&nbsp; We
decided we sat</B>
<BR><B>around long enough and it was time to get back to work.</B>
<BR><B>I had finished up scrapping up all the gunk off the floor so I had
moved to</B>
<BR><B>sweeping with a dust mop, I started sweeping at the front of the
store and</B>
<BR><B>made my way back to the far back left corner, which happened to
be the</B>
<BR><B>darkest part of the store.&nbsp; Off in the distance I heard a commotion;
I just</B>
<BR><B>played it off thinking it was one of the two guys I was working
with until I</B>
<BR><B>saw them passing a couple isles to my right.&nbsp; I continued to
sweep until I</B>
<BR><B>got close enough to hear up in the rafters, which was a storage
area for</B>
<BR><B>boxes, it sounded like someone was kicking and pounding on the boxes.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>stopped to listen when the television sitting on one of the display
counters</B>
<BR><B>turned on, and the volume turned way up, I walked over to the display
to see</B>
<BR><B>if anyone was there but there was no one, so I turned the television
off by</B>
<BR><B>that time all the noise in the rafters stopped.&nbsp; I finally
finished sweeping</B>
<BR><B>the floor when we decided to take another break, hoping to see the</B>
<BR><B>reflection again I walked over to the break area and nothing was
there</B>
<BR><B>whatever it was gone, I asked my buddy what other things that had
happened</B>
<BR><B>to him, he went on saying he had heard a baby cry and a woman's
voice, and</B>
<BR><B>something in a certain isle of the wood department doesn't like
the sound of</B>
<BR><B>the floor buffer and when he goes by it chucks wood at the buffer
and also</B>
<BR><B>they go into a isle and there will be Tupperware covers piled roughly
six</B>
<BR><B>feet high and if they don't put them away whatever it is will come
around</B>
<BR><B>and knock the stack over .</B>
<BR><B>Later on during the night I started vacuuming the carpeted area
toward the</B>
<BR><B>front of the store when I had the eeriest feeling like someone was
watching</B>
<BR><B>me, and also in another area of the store I had the same feeling
only It was</B>
<BR><B>a really bad one.&nbsp; Couple hours before we left to go home my
buddy and I</B>
<BR><B>stopped at the men and women's restroom, we cleaned the woman's
first and</B>
<BR><B>before we left he pointed out that the lights were motion sensor.&nbsp;
We left</B>
<BR><B>the bathroom and saw the light turn off, thought the crack on the
bottom</B>
<BR><B>door.&nbsp; We started to clean the men's room and heard pounding
on the other</B>
<BR><B>side of the wall, I quickly ran out the bathroom and sure enough
the light</B>
<BR><B>was on shining through the bottom of the door, as I peeked in the
room</B>
<BR><B>nobody was there.&nbsp; After that the manager came and unlocked
the door from</B>
<BR><B>the outside and we all left.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a good experience
because nothing</B>
<BR><B>happened to me and I was really fun and I would do it again if I
get the</B>
<BR><B>chance.</B>

<P><B>I SWEAR TO GOD THIS IS TRUE</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: rohaninabout@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Let me begin by saying that this story is about my parents experience
when</B>
<BR><B>they were living together before they had me!</B>
<BR><B>They were renting a house at the top of a street, about 16 -18 years
ago.</B>
<BR><B>They said that the house wasn’t a friendly house, and something
was wrong</B>
<BR><B>about it, and it didn’t feel right. The atmosphere was uninviting
and they</B>
<BR><B>felt like they were being watched. It was never warm inside either.
The</B>
<BR><B>first few days went alright, but they had a strange feeling about
the house.</B>
<BR><B>They went to sleep on night, and they heard sounds, but thought
nothing of</B>
<BR><B>it, the house was rather run down, so it could have been birds in
the</B>
<BR><B>ceiling, or mice on the floor.</B>
<BR><B>Then footsteps started, little kids footsteps down the hallway.
They</B>
<BR><B>footsteps were short paced, and quick, so it had to be a Childs,
the</B>
<BR><B>footsteps got closer to their bedroom door, and then stopped. They
thought</B>
<BR><B>nothing of it, and thought they had imagined it. This carried on
for days,</B>
<BR><B>night after night. Until they decided to do something about it,
and find a</B>
<BR><B>logical explanation. He got the shovel from behind his bed, and
when he</B>
<BR><B>heard the footsteps close to his door, he jumped out and tried to
scare the</B>
<BR><B>intruder off, as you have probably guessed, there was no one there,
no</B>
<BR><B>animals, no anything, and it wasn’t from inside the walls, I mean
where can</B>
<BR><B>u move inside the walls, it would be strange hearing footsteps in
the walls.</B>
<BR><B>This carried on for more nights, and my parents went searching around
the</B>
<BR><B>house, looking for evidence. They found nothing whatsoever. So they
went</B>
<BR><B>back to bed. The footsteps always stopped outside their room that
they were</B>
<BR><B>sleeping in, and they felt as if the “thing” was observing them,
like a</B>
<BR><B>child does when it sees someone new. Dad tried to scare it away.
They had to</B>
<BR><B>shift later due to the land owner wanted to live there. So they
shifted to a</B>
<BR><B>nicer house, in a nicer location. When they moved, they asked the
land owner</B>
<BR><B>if he had experience anything unusual in that house, he said that
nothing</B>
<BR><B>had happened to him. Later a couple that mum and dad were friends
with, new</B>
<BR><B>the previous owners of the house, and they informed them that a
child had</B>
<BR><B>died.</B>
<BR><B>Now, We go past the house frequently, because our cousins live about
5</B>
<BR><B>houses down the road.</B>
<BR><B>The always looks deserted, and has the haunted look about it.</B>
<BR><B>The landlord moved out a long time ago, and never returned, he had
probably</B>
<BR><B>had the same experience.</B>
<BR><B>Even today, some people live in the house, but move out quickly.
My cousin</B>
<BR><B>lately informed me that the most recent owners of the house moved
in a month</B>
<BR><B>or two ago, and a couple of days ago they moved out due to a strange
feeling</B>
<BR><B>in the house.</B>
<BR><B>I think it’s obvious to say that that house is haunted…</B>
<BR><B>I have lots more stories from myself, and my parent’s trip to London
ALL</B>
<BR><B>TRUE. Ill add them in later.</B>

<P><B>Ghosts enjoy the Drums too</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: welivefiction@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I began playing drums around age 13. I played all the time and always</B>
<BR><B>thought I saw some thing, or some one out of the corner of my eye
for years</B>
<BR><B>upon end. My basement is large, it goes deep and long and then up
more</B>
<BR><B>towards the upper right of the room is a long walk way (washer /
dryer /</B>
<BR><B>dads work bench) and some other stuff. For years I knew I've seen
shadow's.</B>
<BR><B>I feared not, I told myself, 'hes just enjoying the music.' One
time when my</B>
<BR><B>parents were gone to a hockey game, my sister was out, I was home
alone, no</B>
<BR><B>biggie right ? So I was in the drumming mood, went down stairs and
began to</B>
<BR><B>jam hard. I was jammim very hard, the music was flowing that night.
I look</B>
<BR><B>up and saw a shadow walk directly across about 5 feet from my drums.
Top</B>
<BR><B>hat, long coat, all shadow. I was shaken but defyed the odds and
played</B>
<BR><B>louder, faster, and harder. Goosebumps erupted upon my skin. In
my head I</B>
<BR><B>said...'i saw that, i saw that, this time i saw it' That was years
on end</B>
<BR><B>ago; 3 to 4 years ago. Embedded in my mind. I've never seen the
figure</B>
<BR><B>again. He was only there when I played drums, thats it, never anyother
time.</B>
<BR><B>I believe he's a true lover of music, enjoying the brutal metal
double bass</B>
<BR><B>drumming sounds of an excellent drum kit. He has since left my basement,</B>
<BR><B>I've never seen him again. Shadows gone but not forgotten.....</B><B></B>

<P><B>Fulford Mansion : Brockville, Ont. Canada</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: devil_a_lullaby@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Back in my last year of high school I had to do a documentary on
hauntings in my hometown as my final study project. The first place I went
to film of course was the Fulford Home just off of Highway 29.</B>
<BR><B>I went with my best friend who was to do the filming while I spoke.
I had called the mansion a few days prior and was given permission by the
friendly employees of the mansion to film. Upon arrival everything was
a disaster from the beginning. The lady [who shall remain anonymous] that
led us through the tour gave us leeway to venture where we pleased but
informed us that we could not go to the third floor or past the velvet
ropes.</B>
<BR><B>As we started to film, our opening scene was to take place in the
front foyer. My friend commented that the battery light kept flashing during
our opening scene and the camera would flicker. This was strange as I fully
charged the battery for 24 hrs prior to filming. We ended up replacing
that battery with another we had with us and it did the same thing. In
the end I decided to keep going on and would just have to edit the film
later. When we moved to a different room the battery light didnt turn on
and we had no further problems with the battery.</B>
<BR><B>For our second scene we moved to the study room which contained
a bookcase that had a level without books. A few years prior an employee
was giving a tour of the mansion when suddenly the books from the shelf
flew off of it and onto the ground. It shocked everyone so much they decided
not to place books there ever again. The filming from this scene went along
fine until I got back to school and started to edit. The light fixture
in the study had small fringes that dangled from the light and appeared
to be moving back and forth in a slow and menancing way. I asked my camera
friend later if she had noticed it during filming and she commented that
she hadn't.</B>
<BR><B>In another shot I decided I wanted to take it from the stairs where
there were 2 seperate reports of orbs that floated from the stairs. Everything
went well and we moved on. But once again during editing when I got to
that scene the entire screen was blocked by a fuzzy white light. You could
hear me speak perfectly ok but you couldn't see me past the light. My friend
said that there was nothing wrong with the camera during that time and
she did not have it covered or her hand over the lens.</B>
<BR><B>Finally as we were going to film the last shot we moved to Mary
Fulfords bedroom and I was closing up the film when an item from the shelf
fell onto the floor. The employee entered and asked me if I stepped past
the velvet rope which I hadn't and the item happened to be at the opposite
end of the room. Needless to say we finished up the rest of the filming
at various cemetaries.</B>
<BR><B>I got an A+ on my assignment.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Feelings</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Gibsonsggurl@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi...Love ya site and cant stop reading the true stories. I am a
30 year old wife and mother of two sons from the UK. At the age of 10 I
had a dream that my grandfather had "fallen asleep" at the dinner table
and we were unable to wake him. My aunts black labrador was also there
(he had died about 2 years before). The dream was so real and it played
on my mind for the whole day. I went about my daily school routine but
the dream kept coming back to me. I told my best friend (she is still my
best friend today and remembers this). That night before bed I told my
parents because I could not get it off my mind (Mum always said if you
talk about a bad dream then it wont come back...and has always worked for
me even now) Although it hadn't been a scary dream and nothing bad happened,
I knew I didn't want it to return. We laughed about it and that was it.
I slept peacefully and the dream never returned. 3 days later I came in
from school and my Mum was sitting on the sofa crying, she hugged me and
told me that my Grandfather had died. Although he had previously had a
stroke this wasn't expected as he was getting better. It wasn't until later
on when my Aunt and Uncle came round that we found out that he died while
sitting at the dinner table and they thought he had fallen asleep. It was
spoken about and we all put it down to coincidence and forgot about it.It
turned out to be the start of many strange dreams, "feelings"&nbsp; and
unexplained experiences and have learned to follow my "intuition" rather
than my head (and there has been times when they have been in serious conflict)
When my sis was in hospital having her baby, I woke my husband at 2am to
tell him that my sis had had a little girl and they were both fine. 10
minutes later my mum called from the hospital to tell us..I just knew.
The night my father died, my son and I woke up at the same time and we
both knew what had happened about 5 minutes before we got the call from
my brother (I had even gone downstairs and started to get dressed). One
of my most recent experiences was at my Mum's house, she had taken me upstairs
to show me her newly decorated bedroom, we were laughing and joking . My
2 boys (7 and 11) were there and my niece(8) all of a sudden I felt like
someone was standing behind me with their arms around my shoulders. I didn't
see anything, just "felt" my Dad giving me a hug. For a couple of seconds
I could feel his presense. My logic kicked in and i became afraid because
my head told me that this was not right. I got out of the room as quick
as I could, the minute I did I was struck by an overwhelming feeling of
grief and loss and began to cry really hard. My mum and kids followed me
out and asked what was wrong. I dint want to tell them because i think
it sounded insane but my mum said that she knew something had happened
because of the look on my face(she said I had gone white) I was shaking
and no one was used to me bursting into tears like that(I couldn't seem
to stop sobbing!). I told her what I had felt and she believed me and then
went on to tell me about openeing and closing door in the same room.&nbsp;
I am lucky to have a very supportive family (althought they are not all
believers) they too have been puzzled by certain things(involving my "feelings")
and know me well enough to know that I am level headed and would not make
this up. There is more to this and I have had so many other unexplained
experiences. If you would like to know more then just email me. I didn't
add them all here cos I think this is long enough and I dont wanna bore
ya!! Thank You for Listening :o)</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jmhredzak@alltel.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi. My name is Amy. I'm 12 years old. When I was 10 I was at my friends
sleepover birthday party. One of my friends didn't feel well so she went
to the bedroom. She didn't come down for a while, so we all went up to
check on her except for my friend Hannah. Once we got upstairs Hannah came
running all pale and screaming "Oh my gosh, Oh my gosh." She told us she
had seen this big white blob run across the windowsil outside. My friend
Jenny ,the birthday girl, said "Oh my gosh that was Dread." She explained
to us that when she was little she would always see Dread running across
her lawn. We all got scared and went downstairs. Then we looked out the
window and he was on the driveway laughing at us. A couple of days later,
Hannah and I were having a sleepover and she has four sky windows in her
living room. We were watching "Fear Factor" and we got scared and looked
up and there he was in one of the sky windows, laughing. We got so scared
and ran upstairs to her Mom. The next day after I got home I was about
to tell my sister, Rachel and my friend Julie from up the street about
Dread. But, my sister wanted to look out the window (I have no idea why,
and she doesnt remember) and she says "OH MY GOSH WHY IS THERE A BIG WHITE
LOG RUNNING DOWN OUR STREET?" I got to a quick look of it and saw Dread.
No one that we know of has seen him since ,we don't know why he stopped
coming, but we are glad he isn't coming back.</B>

<BR><B>Old Man Rapp</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: a.kenlon@21computech.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Here’s the first of a series of hauntings that I’ve head to deal
with in my times. None of them were ‘bad’ experiences, just odd, unusual,
or damn silly.</B>
<BR><B>To start off I’m unsure what I had in the old house that my Grandmother
owned. Some say that the signs could either be a ghost or a poltergeist
by the things that have happened. Frankly since I’ve never bothered to
look into it in great detail I don’t know. All I know is that there is
something there. It’s nothing disturbing or creepy for that matter, but
Old Man Rapp does wander that house. Don’t know if that’s the entity’s
real name or not, but it’s what we’ve been calling him for the past thirty
years.</B>
<BR><B>Old Man Rapp made his first ‘appearance’ known to my Grandmother
the very day they moved in. The furniture was brought in, moved to where
she wanted them to go and then the carpets were vacuumed. Later that night
she heard the sounds of the furniture being dragged around. Not being the
kind of person that is bothered by much of anything Grandma just hollered
out that when whomever was screwing with the dressers was done that they
had better be back where she had put them and then she went back to sleep.
The sounds went on for a little while and then stopped. The next morning
everything was where she left it but there was fresh drag marks in the
carpet (remember the vacuum would have erased the previous set of marks).</B>
<BR><B>Since then he has made himself known by the usual tricks. Walking
up and down the stairs was a favorite of his. Even to the point where my
Mom and Dad were going to yell at me for wandering around late at night
until the remembered that I was at a sleepover 5 miles away. Smells were
also something we came across frequently. In a house of non-smokers we
would on occasion smell fine pipe tobacco (the good stuff and not the cheap
crap they sell at Dept. Stores). Later on in my time at that house we figured
that he found a girlfriend. The new smells were from a rather expensive
smelling perfume. Neither my Mom nor my Grandmother wore fragrances so
the source was a mystery unless you figured in the supernatural. Salt frequently
vanished from the shakers. The list goes on and on.</B>
<BR><B>Old Man Rapp was our resident house entity and we were fond of him.
>From the current theories concerning spirits we figure that if he was
a poltergeist he was tempered by the sense of love and affection that permeated
the house and if he was a ghost he was included and attracted by it. That
has been sold when my grandparents passed away and now I only hope that
he’s not being too hard on the new owners.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My second haunting is at the place where I live now. We have an
‘ethereal fuzzy’ living in our house. Yes, we have a ghost cat and he’s
a playful little jokester. We have since named him Elfis (being into fantasy
as we are in that house).</B>
<BR><B>Elfis made his first appearance to us the one day I was trying to
get a little afternoon nap. I felt the bed shake as if a cat had landed
on it. Since one of our cats has a bit of a hormonal imbalance and is prone
to lash out without any warning it is prudent to open one’s eyes and see
which of the four cats it is. So I open up and look at the spot that I
feel the moggie walking. Not a blessed thing there. I look around and there
is one of the cats looking at the spot where I felt the cat walking with
her eyes wide. Twink (our psycho cat) wasn’t in a defensive posture, just
keenly interested in the spot where I last felt the cat walking.</B>
<BR><B>We have a Florida Room (which is a porch completely walled in and
airtight so we can use it in the colder days. Since it gets too cold to
use the room in deep winter we close the door. The cats which don’t mind
the cold have learned how to use the balls we hand on either side of the
door to let us know when it’s time to go in or out. Elfis has learned this
as well. I’m at the computer and I, my mother and my father all hear the
bell on the outside ring. I’m the closest and so I get up and open the
door. No cat on the porch at all. I take stock and I see Rainbow crashed
out on the sofa, Chester is sprawled out on the entertainment center, Jen
is playing dead cat in the middle of the kitchen floor (lying on her back
looking like roadkill) and Twink is gorked on the bed. As I said, the porch
is airtight and so no wind would have moved the bell and there was none
outside anyway, no sonic booms or rumbling trucks that might have otherwise
explained it.</B>
<BR><B>As it is, we’re now used to the presence of Elfis. He/She/It is
our fifth cat</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hippy House Haunts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: PDL147852@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>My best friends in the world got a house about two years ago. It
was trashed when they got it and the last resisidents were drug dealers.
They aften have police coming to the door looking for the former owner.
Well we took this drug house and made it into our own hippy frat house.
If a house is haunted I usually pick up on it right away but here I felt
not a thing. However the girl living there at the time said the place was
haunted which is strange because she believes in nothing of the sort. Well
the girl moved out recently and I moved in, I didn't have a bed yet so
I had to sleep on the couch. The first thing that happend was that I was
awakend one night by somebody bumping around the living room in back of
the couch where I was. Someone was shuffling papers pushing keys on the
computer but the night light was on and I could clearly see there was nobody
there. then i saw those gleaming eyes, just eyes hovering there in the
darkness. Flash forward, I have a bed upstairs now but things just get
stranger. In this room I have terrible dreams even one about a recently
deceased friend who gave me a cryptic warning or two. I dreamed that I
got out of bed and walked past the bathroom, in the bathroom was a Mexican
guy sitting on the toilet lid talking on a cell phone and paying me no
mind. When I awoke I realized the man in the bathroom was the man in the
house. Could he have been killed by the drug dealers in this very house?
I would say mystery solved.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Lebanon, Missouri</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:krazykat0844@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I live in a small town in southwest Missouri.&nbsp; Not long after
moving here in the summer of 1995 I heard on the police scanner the following.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I don't remember the exact month, but I'm sure it was in the fall because
it was a Sunday night, around 8:30PM and was almost dark outside.&nbsp;
The police received more than one call about two small boys playing on
the railroad&nbsp; tracks which runs thru the town.&nbsp;&nbsp; The police
were told the boys were dressed in very old fashion clothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
By the time the police arrived, there was so sight of the boys.</B>
<BR><B>Again, I heard this on the police scanner.&nbsp;&nbsp; This took
place this last summer of 2003.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, it was a Sunday night,
but it was around&nbsp; 11pm at night.&nbsp;&nbsp; A lady walked in the
police station to tell them that she saw a small girl, around 5-6 years
old, blonde, carrying a paper bag and a teddybear walking toward the same
railroad tracks but further down the tracks from where the boys were spotted.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The lady said she stopped and ask the little girl if she needed help, and
all the little girl would say is "I'm trying to get home".&nbsp;&nbsp;
The little girl wouldn't even stop walking, just kept repeating that.&nbsp;
The police searched for this little girl for hours, knocking on every door
asking if they had a small child&nbsp; who was missing.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
lady who spotted this little girl even went back to the scene to help search.&nbsp;
The Missouri Highway Patrol was called in to search.&nbsp;&nbsp; They never
did find a child missing or find her.&nbsp; The Lebanon police called the
railroad company telling them to be on the lookout for a child when coming
thru Lebanon.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Unknown Discovery</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:diva20062@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Im gonna first start out by saying that this is happened to me and
my sister just so everyone knows. well we use to live in new hampshire
because thats where we were born. my moms family was really close then
until we moved away. but anyways bac to the story we were stayin at my
aunts house and her house was known to be haunted but she never thought
that it was cause she didnt want to believe it, she wasnt that kinda person
to believe sorts lik that. i was about 5 and my sister was about 6. We
were all havin a good time there that day then it became night time. my
mom put me and my sister to bed and turned out the light. we slept for
a few hours when my sister suddenly awoke she woke me up as well. and she
asked me if i hear the noise downstairs and i was little that i didnt think
it was anything cause i didnt think of much things but my sister was always
a superstitious person. she made me listen to what was a crying sound it
was a very loud sound that was just odd unlike no other cryin sound. we
decided to get up and go see what it was as we went downstairs we searched
around for the noise. the noise was comin from the living room so we went
into the living room and we saw this very distant figure it was a white
little see threw frigure. my sister looked at me and was very surprised
but instead of being scared and runni away she just sat there and of course
i was scared so i ran into my moms room.as i ran up there i woke my mom
up and told her about it but of course she thought that it was a dream
so i slept with her for the rest of the night. my sister of course told
me her encounters after i had ran in fright. but as of wut she remembers
of the whole thing well the rest of it is that she jsut stood there lookin
at the figure. it wasnt facing her but all she saw was its bac. but then
as my sister took a step bac it turned around and she remember that it
was white as a angel thats wut she calls it to this day. the ghost looked
at her and spoke very softly! "help me, help me." my sister just looked
at her and said help with wut? then the ghost spoke again, "help me im
cold" ur cold my sister said bac! "yes im cold" it said again. then my
sister remembers askin her if she wanted a coat, of course she didnt know
that it cant take hold on to a coat and stuff but she asked it and she
remembers goin upstairs and gettin one. after a few minutes she went downstairs
an the ghost vanished out of thin air. but she remember seein little wet
puddles in the livin room on the wood tiles but my sister couldnt understand
wut had happened. so she left the coat right next to where she was standing
in the living room and went upstairs. to this day she has dreams about
the girls face and the encounters that she had with her. in her dreams
she remembers wut had happened and shes told me many of times about the
story hopin that i remember but i do i remember bits and pieces but of
course i was younger then her. shes also tried to write stories about her
but something always stops her she would write the story half way to the
end then she would stop its lik something holds her bac. but after that
night we left the next mornin and then a few years later my aunt moved
out of the house and nothing has ever happened. but the coat that my sister
left where the girl was standin was gone. my sister knows that she was
good cause she never ried to hurt her or anything lik that but all we can
do now is to hope that shes at piece... if anyone has any similar storys
like this then email me...</B>

<P><B>Townhouse</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Hoebb8@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>in 1999 me and my boyfriend were 16 and 17 at the time and had our
own townhouse in bolingbrook, il. one day he punched a hole in the wall
underneath a set of stairs... i looked in there with a flashlight for some
reason and saw a womens wallet... so we fished it out. there was a student
id, paycheck stubs, and pictures that seemed to belong to a "judith elsner".
the checkstubs were from like 1976... the pictures appeared to be of friends
taken in our same house... so anyway we thought nothing of it....</B>
<BR><B>but since then strange things began. we would constantly hear footsteps
coming from an upstairs bedroom. so distinct, that a few times we armed
ourselves with baseball bats to check the upstairs, thinking someone had
broken in. they were always from the same room. and all the windows were
locked, there was no draft, no tree branch on the roof- nothing that could
possibly suggest ANY noise made from up there. but yeah, so there were
footsteps, and then weird creaking noises...</B>
<BR><B>one day me and my friend were sitting on the couch in the livingroom.[
it was chrismastime so we had decorations and lights up] i told him about
the footsteps and creaking and he said, "fine, if there's a ghost in here,
give us a sign. make something fall. knock something over make something
move..." so i lit a smoke and waited. 5 minutes and nothing. we were about
to stop holding our breaths and then a whole like 8 foot strand of christmas
lights fell. they were taped up horizontally across the ceiling separating
the liv from the din. rm. and they fell...-not fell because the tape came
loose somewhere and it pulled the whole thing down, but fell like they
were pulled down because the tape was still on the ceiling and it was just
ripped in the center... so that freaked me out, becasue i never seen anything,
only heard...</B>
<BR><B>this other day we were on our way in.[ the garage is on the far
side of the house]</B>
<BR><B>we pull in the driveway and as we drove by the front of the house
i notice the stairway light on... oh well no big deal. but my boyfriend
and i walk in and i had to go to the bathroom upstairs which was across
from "the room", and i was too scared to go alone so i would have him come
up there with me and stand outside the door... but anyway, we walk in and
i tell him, "come upstairs with me, i have to pee" so we turn to run upstairs
and stopped a step or two up,&nbsp; because i said, "oh wait, could you
get the light?" and&nbsp; right after i said that we looked at each other
and thought someone was in the house. so once again, we check everywhere
in the house. nothing. everything was locked, and there was no explanation.
the light was working fine. so in that 1 min or so it takes to walk from
the driveway to the door, the light was turned off... so after checking
the two bedrooms, we shut the door, just in case, so we would hear them
open if anyone or anything had to get out... but when he shut the door
of "the room", we just turned to walk down the steps located right next
to the bedroom door, and somehthing pushed on the door; he was shutting
it, then something pushed it shut harder. i just about jumped down the
stairs and we left. i didnt think twice. we stayed the night at my mothers
house... so after that, we kinda got used to it, and when i was home alone
i would kinda just "talk" to whoever was listening. and i even decorated
a poster for that room labeled " judy's room". and we still heard footsteps
and creaking and all, but it didnt bother us anymore.&nbsp; =)</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Marching Soldiers</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Mike@Barrowman28.freeserve.co.uk</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Here is a story about what happened to me and my freind just after
we were walking through a field. We were only 12 years old at the time
so it seemed quite weird cos we didn't know much about ghosts.</B>
<BR><B>We got to a path, and it was right near a church, we heard a thudding
sound but it was in rhythm like a beat. We then just ran because we didn't
have a clue what was going on.When we got to the end of the path we looked
back and the path seemed to be moving like swinging, back and forth, we
ran again.</B>
<BR><B>A while later I had to do homework about ghost, and I did it about
this story. I did a bit of research and I found out that near to where
it happened there used to be a church right next to where the sound was
coming from. In the English civil war that church was used by one of the
"rebels", I think he was called James but I can't remember what his surname
was. He and his army were killed in the church and the church was destroyed.
But he said before he died that he and his army would "never die because
they had to finish what needed to be done and end the royal family heretage."</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Doll</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: dazzelberry_babe@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Iv heard a lot of different ghosts stories, and they all seemed to
be about a bunch of phyco people just looking for attention. That is untill
I came to realize that there was potential spirital acitivity in my own
home.</B>
<BR><B>My house isn't relly all that old. It was built by my father and
my grandfather in 1987 aorund the time i was born. Well I didn't really
pay any attention to it but everytime anyone came down into my basement
with me (wither it be friends of family) they always wanted to be quick
to get back upstairs and they would complain about how cold it was down
stairs. This is a very true point no matter how high we have the fire place
turned up it's freezing. But I just thought that they were all whimps,
since i had gotton used to the cold.</B>
<BR><B>Around the time I was in grade eight I had my best friend over for
a sleep over. Since my bed wasn't all that big we decided that we would
spend our night down in the basement. This would also allow us some privacy,
to do....girl stuff.</B>
<BR><B>My mother has this doll it was very old and almost looks like Cinderella
after the fairygod mother gets her ready for the ball. When we went down
to set up our beds for the night it was laying in the middle of the floor.
This was nothing strange since My brother was very careless and just tossed
stuff wherever. Well being in a little bit of a hurry I picked up the doll
and threw it arcross the room. My friend laughed when it landed on it's
head. After the beds were set up we went up stairs for some supper. We
decided to go back down stairs and eat there so we could start our movie.
My little borther was leaving for the night and we would have to whole
basement to our selfs. When we got down there the doll that i had thrown
was sitting on top of my blanket. At first it freaked me out but like I
said I never really believed in ghosts. Than i thought that maybe my mom
had gone down there and seen what I had done to it. So we put it off and
began our girls night. After a few movies and a lot of pop couldn't hold
it in anymore and had to go relieve myself. My friend not wanting to stay
in the basement alone came with me. When we went back downstairs the doll
was again sitting on the blanket facing the stairs. My friend was the first
to notice it and this really freaked me out now because my mom was sleeping
upstairs and my little brother wasn't home. We ended up spending the night
upstairs in my room. Of course when I tried to tell my mom the next day
she didn't believe me. She said "It's just your imagination....overactive."</B>
<BR><B>Every time that I go down there I notice that the doll is always
in a different place. Most of the time im home alone and there is no explanation
to why the doll continues to move but everytime it does it is always facing
the staircase.</B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;A Brownie</B><B></B>

<P><B>by; polly234@tut.by</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Olga and I'm from Belarus/Europe</B>
<BR><B>I've never really experienced any contacts with ghosts and dead
spirits, and I cast doubts on their existence. So does my father. But I
do not presume to assert it.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, my father keeps ensuring me that he had this strange experiment
a year ago with what they call 'a brownie'.</B>
<BR><B>Most families here in Belarus live in blocks of flats. As my parents
are divorced, my father has to rent a flat of his own on the 4th floor
of an apartment building. The windows face the local avenue and a shopping
centre. One late evening when it was already dark outside he went out to
do some shopping. As he was walking back towards the building, he glanced
at the windows of his apartment mechanically and saw that strange dim yellow
light that was coming from inside the house. He was sure that it wasn't
the chandelier. It seemed like the spotlight was placed on the floor or
somewhere under the table, and the rooms were illuminated only partially.</B>
<BR><B>He rushed home, thinking that someone was robbing the house. When
he walked in, it was total darkness. There was no light, no presence of
people. All the things and treasures were in their places. No singns of
burglars. He lives alone and he swears that back then he had switched off
the lights before he went out.</B>
<BR><B>He still doesn't know what it was.</B>
<BR><B>By the way, it is common that little things vanish at his place
- it may be a book, a knife, a watch or even a pot. My father has never
been absent-minded, he always remembers where he had left certain things.
But things keep disappearing and a few days later he finds them in unusual
places. For example, he found his watch in a strange box which he had never
seen and opened before. He thought the box was left by the previous tenants
of the apartment, but how did his watch get into the box then? He has no
answer.</B>

<P><B>This house really is haunted. My aunt and uncle used to live in this
house and every time I would stay with them the room that my cousins and
I would sleep in always stayed cold no matter how hot the rest of the house
was. One day the ghost asked my cousin if she could come upstairs and play.
and on another day we were outside and we looked up to see a woman pulling
back the curtain of our room. And no one has lived in that house since.</B><B></B>

He laughed."</B>
<BR><B>They looked puzzled as he walked off.</B>
<BR><B>One of my sons turned his attention away to talk with his brother
and he quickly turned to look for where he'd went and he was nowhere in
sight. The way the intersection is made, there is no way that he could
have been out of sight so quickly.</B>

<P><B>Utica NY</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: reneeanddewey@adelphia.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Hello again, I have written previously regarding where I live and
have also submitted pics of the Willard Library Cam that are pretty freaky.&nbsp;
Now I would like to submit a story about a house i lived in briefly twice
in Utica NY.&nbsp; Both times I moved in there it was a no choice situation.&nbsp;
I knew the house anyway because my son's father had owned it a long time
and lived there with his first wife "D" when they were married.&nbsp; My
X had told me long before we had too move there that it was haunted.&nbsp;
Hearing this come from X was odd because he is a no nonsense type of guy.</B>
<BR><B>The house is large, consisting of a big upstairs/downstairs main
house with two apartments attached in the back.&nbsp; When they first got
the place they had to go in and clean and fix things.</B>
<BR><B>During the first visit in the giant attic of the whole place, they
found a trunk with religious items inside it.</B>
<BR><B>They believe along with the other weird items found it was used
for satanism type stuff.&nbsp; Ironically right in view of the home is
a big beautiful catholic church.&nbsp; One night as they were eating at
the dining room table, out of nowhere and for no reason, their wedding
glasses came FLYING of the shelf they were on and smashed all over.&nbsp;
When I lived in the main house, I also had the usual being watched and
a feeling of "get the hell out of dodge".&nbsp; At the time i did not know
if it was not just paranoia due to hearing peoples stories.&nbsp; The one
strange area though was where my washing machine was upstairs.&nbsp; i
was always freaking out.&nbsp; I'll bet I can load and unload a washing
machine in record time easy. The feeling in there was so intense but yet
so mixed, till this day I feel its the spirit of a teen age girl. Typing
this now 10 years later i can almost see what she looks like, and that
is very weird. I dont think I ever thought about that either until reading
stories here and having it dawn on me. (fianlly, duhh).&nbsp; It was always
a mix of utter fear and hate watching me.&nbsp; Another guy i know had
a experience in the upstairs apart</B>
<BR><B>nt.&nbsp; He was sitting on the couch when he felt and saw the indent
of someone sitting down and putting their hand on his leg.&nbsp; Needless
too say this 200 plus pound man wigged. I can't say as I blame him, I still
would not be over it.&nbsp; The final thing that happened that I know of
his with my son.&nbsp; He was only 4 and would lay in his bed in the mostly
dark room and swear up and down that "the purple guy keeps walking across
the wall".&nbsp; Now i was freaking too and the kid slept with me on the
sofa bed all of the time, both our choices.&nbsp; After reading stories
here, I know those faceless dark shadow people are just plain trouble.&nbsp;
My son still remembers that guy till this day.&nbsp; Needless to say, I
was happier than hell too get out of there.&nbsp; Where I live now can
be a little freaky too but never threatening.&nbsp; thanks.</B>

<BR><B>Here's a Ghost Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: rscott@scofamco.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I was surfing the web and found your web site.&nbsp; I began reading
some</B>
<BR><B>of your ghost occurances and it reminded me of an experience I had</B>
<BR><B>years ago.&nbsp; I moved into a house my friend had bought.&nbsp;
It was built</B>
<BR><B>around 1895.&nbsp; His intention was to rehab (fix it up) and sell
it for</B>
<BR><B>a tidy profit.&nbsp; The house was south of Minneapolis in what
is refered</B>
<BR><B>to as the PowderHorn Park area.&nbsp; The house was in pretty bad
shape,</B>
<BR><B>having been a rental property for a number of years.&nbsp; I moved
in</B>
<BR><B>because the rent was cheap and I could pay off part of the rent
by</B>
<BR><B>helping him work on the house.&nbsp; He torn everything out to the
studs.</B>
<BR><B>New insulation, sheet rock, the works.&nbsp; It was during this
time of</B>
<BR><B>demolition that most of the occurances took place.&nbsp; We would
hear</B>
<BR><B>footsteps pacing the second floor.&nbsp; The Shower in the second
floor</B>
<BR><B>bathroom would come on by itself.&nbsp; The Butler's door to the
kitchen</B>
<BR><B>would suddenly swing open and close by itself.&nbsp; One of my favorites</B>
<BR><B>was the kitchen.&nbsp; We vaulted the ceiling, and put a small stained</B>
<BR><B>glass window in one of the upstairs bedrooms.&nbsp; You could then
open</B>
<BR><B>the window from the bedroom and look out over the kitchen.&nbsp;
We also</B>
<BR><B>lined the kitchen with new kitchen cabinets that had spring loaded</B>
<BR><B>doors.&nbsp; When you opened them and let go they would close by</B>
<BR><B>themselves with a very distinctive -whump- sound.&nbsp; On several</B>
<BR><B>occasions I would be upstairs in my room reading when I would hear
-</B>
<BR><B>whump, whump, whump, like someone opening and closing all the</B>
<BR><B>cabinets in the kitchen.&nbsp; I would go to the window to peer
into the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen thinking my room mate was home from work, only to find the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen dark and empty.&nbsp; The funny thing was these things never</B>
<BR><B>frightened either of us.&nbsp; We always felt perfectly at home
in that</B>
<BR><B>house.&nbsp; One day we were up in the attic patching holes under
the</B>
<BR><B>eaves.&nbsp; We had developed a squirrel problem and the little
beggers</B>
<BR><B>were getting into the attic.&nbsp; While up there we found an old
picture</B>
<BR><B>of an elderly couple.&nbsp; I would say the picture was from the
late</B>
<BR><B>1940's era.&nbsp; The man in the picture appeared to be quite tall,
thin,</B>
<BR><B>balding with wire rim glasses.&nbsp; About six months later, I got
married</B>
<BR><B>and moved out into a new apartment with my new bride.&nbsp; After
the</B>
<BR><B>wedding reception, my room mate who was also my best man in the</B>
<BR><B>wedding went back to his house with a group of guys and girls from</B>
<BR><B>the wedding reception.&nbsp; They were all sitting around in the
living</B>
<BR><B>room later that night when everyone noticed one of the girls was</B>
<BR><B>staring intently at the top of the staircase which went from the</B>
<BR><B>livingroom to the second floor.&nbsp; She was asked what she was
staring</B>
<BR><B>at.&nbsp; She said she could see a tall old man standing at the
top of the</B>
<BR><B>stairs.&nbsp; He was bald with wire rimmed glasses and he was very</B>
<BR><B>unhappy.&nbsp; This was his house and he wanted everyone to leave.</B>
<BR><B>Everyone laughed about it, but my room mate, remembering the picture</B>
<BR><B>we had found, didn't think it was so funny.&nbsp; The last little
tidbit</B>
<BR><B>of information is the area the house was in was also known as 'Cobweb</B>
<BR><B>Corners'&nbsp; because the whole area was kind of run down and neglected.</B>
<BR><B>So how's that! The haunting from Cobweb Corners.</B>
<BR><B>My second experience happened a couple of years later.&nbsp; I was</B>
<BR><B>visiting a friend.&nbsp; There was a large and beautiful old house
across</B>
<BR><B>the street. The elderly couple that lived there had passed away
and</B>
<BR><B>there was an estate sale going on.&nbsp; I was told that there was
quite a</B>
<BR><B>collection of antique photographic equipment available.&nbsp; I
went to</B>
<BR><B>the sale with my buddy in tow, thinking I could possible make a
good</B>
<BR><B>deal on some nice old equipment there.&nbsp; We walked through the
first</B>
<BR><B>floor seeing the usual old clothes and kitchen items one see's at</B>
<BR><B>these sales.&nbsp; We then proceeded upstairs.&nbsp; The second
floor was much</B>
<BR><B>more interesting.&nbsp; It was half finished.&nbsp; It had two bedrooms
on one</B>
<BR><B>side and the other side was just bare attic space.&nbsp; I went
through</B>
<BR><B>the attic space first, as they had laid out all the photographic</B>
<BR><B>equipment on tables in this large open area.&nbsp; On the way back
to the</B>
<BR><B>stairs I stepped into one of the bedrooms to see what was availble.</B>
<BR><B>I could see a small twin bed with some costume jewelry laid out
on it</B>
<BR><B>and an old pine dresser against the wall.&nbsp; Started across the
floor</B>
<BR><B>toward the bed when several things happened at once.&nbsp; First,
and I</B>
<BR><B>don't know why I noticed this but, I immediatly noticed that the
room</B>
<BR><B>had no electricity.&nbsp; No lights, wall sockets, fixtures, anything.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>commented over my shoulder to my buddy who was standing in the</B>
<BR><B>doorway.&nbsp; He immediatly concurred but also recognized it was
kinda</B>
<BR><B>weird that I would pick up on this fact having been in the room
only</B>
<BR><B>1 second.&nbsp; Next I had an incredibly oppressive feeling descend
on</B>
<BR><B>me.&nbsp; It was like someone had thrown a blanket over me, or I
had</B>
<BR><B>suddenly found myself in 10 feet of water.&nbsp; I felt completely</B>
<BR><B>smothered.&nbsp; I couldn't move.&nbsp; I froze instantly in the
middle of the</B>
<BR><B>floor.&nbsp; I said to my friend, 'This is a bad room, I need to
get</B>
<BR><B>out.'&nbsp; Unblinking, he said, O&nbsp; K&nbsp; , the way you say
it to a small</B>
<BR><B>child.&nbsp; As I turned to leave the room he said 'Look at this'.&nbsp;
He had</B>
<BR><B>been standing in the doorway watching me, he noticed large holes
in</B>
<BR><B>the door and door frame where a very heavy lock and latch had been</B>
<BR><B>secured to the frame of the door at one point.&nbsp; He mentioned
that</B>
<BR><B>locks are usually on the inside to keep things out, not on the</B>
<BR><B>outside to keep things in.</B>
<BR><B>We both looked at the one small window and noticed very similiar</B>
<BR><B>holes where a large latch had at one time been attached to the window</B>
<BR><B>and frame.&nbsp; Funny to have such a large and secure lock on a
window 15</B>
<BR><B>feet off the ground.&nbsp; That was all we needed to see.&nbsp;
We left that</B>
<BR><B>house right away.</B>

<P><B>Experience with a Little Girl</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tamara@jitindy.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Okay, I used to live in a old house built into apartments.&nbsp;
The house was</B>
<BR><B>the third house built in Brownsburg Indiana, therefore making it
very old.</B>
<BR><B>I always had a weird feeling of not being alone in the apartment
when nobody</B>
<BR><B>else was there.&nbsp; One night while I was sleeping I "woke up,"
(don't know if</B>
<BR><B>I really woke up or not) to find a little girl at the end of my
bed.&nbsp; Her</B>
<BR><B>hair was dark brown and cut in a style you would never see today.&nbsp;
In fact,</B>
<BR><B>I am unsure if it was a little girl or boy, because I could not
see her</B>
<BR><B>face.&nbsp; There was a "shadow" covering her face.&nbsp; Anyways,
she was at the end</B>
<BR><B>of my bed on her knees with her hands together like she was praying.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>personally think she was praying for me and my babies.&nbsp; I was
pregnant with</B>
<BR><B>my twin boys at the time.&nbsp; They were born early and both 3.4lbs.&nbsp;
I never</B>
<BR><B>saw her again, but I could always feel her.&nbsp; Not a great story,
but I will</B>
<BR><B>never forget the experience.</B><B></B>

<P><B>A Little Ghost Experience I had</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: poetris@yahoo.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>I came across your site while I was surfing.&nbsp; I would like to
share an experience I had 2 years ago, about this time.</B>
<BR><B>I have to strat off before the experience.&nbsp; I had a long time
friend named Rich.&nbsp; Rich and I lived together for awhile (as roomates).&nbsp;
We would always have what we called "radio-wars".&nbsp; In this, one of
us would turn the volume way up (usually him-I'm not into loud noise) and
the other would turn the radio down.&nbsp; back and forth, you get the
idea.</B>
<BR><B>Two Chistmas's ago, Rich commited suicide on Christmas Morning.&nbsp;
He was supposed to have moved up North with me (I am in Canada) a week
later.&nbsp; I still moved of course - in fact, there was a lake across
the street.&nbsp; When I asked what the lake was called, I was informed
I lived across the street from "Richard Lake".</B>
<BR><B>Occasionally, I would hear him say my name - not only at home, but
work as well.&nbsp; I would feel someone touch my arm or back sometimes,
when no-one else was home.&nbsp; The usual.</B>
<BR><B>I was cleaning in the living room one day.&nbsp; I was listening
to music at the time, polishing the table.&nbsp; I had my back to the radio
- which, by the way, was a panasonic tower with digital screens.&nbsp;
The volume was shown in decibals.&nbsp; It sis my father's stereo and he
has owned it since I was about 13, and I was turning 20 when this happened,
and it never did this before.&nbsp; As I cleaned, I thought the music seemed
to get louder.&nbsp; I stopped what I was doing to pay more attention,
but the radio was increasing in volume.&nbsp; I figured it was in my head.&nbsp;
I went back to polishing, and seconds later, the music started to go up
again.&nbsp; This time I whirled around just in time to catch the decibals
change back to "CD" .&nbsp; I watched the radio for a minute.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp;
I went back to cleaning.</B>
<BR><B>The radio definatly started to go up this time.&nbsp; I turned around
and sure enough, the volume was going way up.&nbsp; I could see the decibals
in numbers changing, and also, the big knob that you turned to increase/decrease
volume was turning.&nbsp; I ran over and turned it back down, and didn;t
take my eyes off the screen for awhile.&nbsp; Nothing.</B>
<BR><B>I should note here that the remote was on top of the radio, and
nothing was touching it.</B>
<BR><B>I went back to cleaning.&nbsp; No sooner had I touched the rag to
the table, did the volume start to increase again.&nbsp; Faster this time.&nbsp;
I ran over and turned it down, starting to worry about blowing the speakers.&nbsp;
I watched the radio for at least 5 minutes.&nbsp; I didn;t want to move.&nbsp;
But eventually, I went back to cleaning.&nbsp; Same story again, except
this time, when I turned the knob down, the volume kept going up and p
and up - so fast I couldn;t make out the changing numbers.&nbsp; I have
no idea how high exactly it got, but I thought for sure I was replacing
my father's speakers.&nbsp; The house was shaking.&nbsp; In desperation
I hit the power button, and thankfully, it shut off.</B>
<BR><B>I didnt touch that radio for about a week, but not out of fear.&nbsp;
I know who was responsible.&nbsp; Who else ever played radio wars with
me? I dind;t turn it on because I couldn;t afford the speakers if they
blew.&nbsp; I freaked out the next time someone used it, telling them what
happened.&nbsp; But by that time, they had been using it a few hours, no
problem.&nbsp; I doubt they believed two words of my story.&nbsp; And you
know what? My father still has that stereo.&nbsp; It has never once done
anything out of the ordinary since then.&nbsp; I've had many ghost experiences,
but this is definatly my most memorable - because I knew then and there
he was ok.&nbsp; He was still playing around like he always did, and I
cherish that day.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Upstairs Apartment</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: anubis1776@earthlink.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Hi, my name is James&nbsp; about four years ago my wife and I was
going through a seperation, and I was living alone in my grandparents furnished
upstairs apartment above them. I only would go upstairs to take a bath,
or go to bed..Not that I was scared, but because all the sudden not having
my little boy and girl with me anymore just weighed to heavy on my mind
when I got alone! One night while sitting up in the bed reading a magazine,
I heard a woman's voice come from the kitchen..."Hello?" it said very clearly..I
Knew it couldn't be grandmother, because I would always lock the door coming
from downstairs every night before bed..I thought It might have been someone
next door, because I did have the kitchen window open (nights in St. Louis
get hot in&nbsp; the inner city during summer!) about a minute or two later,
the voice came again, but this time from the hallway leading from the kitchen
to the bedroom... It was closer.."Hello?" So I scooted to the edge of the
foot of the bed where I could see down the hall...nobody!&nbsp; All the
sudden while I'm sitting there listening intently for whoever was in my
apartment, the voice came again, but this time it was like it was inside
both of my ears..."help me" the voice said..Talk about scared...The next
morning grandmother asked me if everything was alright last night..I then
told her about the womans voice and what it said...She then told me that
that was the very reason she quit going up there was because she felt very
uncomfortable like someone was there !..My grandmother and grandfather
are both pentecostal ministers, and would never lie to anyone...Needless
to say, "I moved out!" ever since then you can't tell me there are not
ghosts!!!&nbsp; I've never seen one, and hope I never do, but I know for
a fact that hearing one will make the hairs stand up on the back of your
neck....Thanks...James...Zephyrhills Fl.</B>
<BR><B>Happy is the man who Loves only things Living, breathing, not made
by mortal hands!</B>
<BR><B>For all other things are just a passing fancy that will neither
satisfy nor stand the test of time!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Update on Vanishing Cat</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: RudyBM111743@msn.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I just had to send you this story. I couldn't believe it happened
let alone keep it to myself.</B>
<BR><B>The vanishing cat</B>
<BR><B>I had been invited for a Thanksgiving lunch at the retirement home
where I used to work. It was a buffet and there was a variety of food to
select from. I chose a roasted whole chicken leg together with other food
stuff and turkey, of course. Having finished, I went into the kitchen to
dispose of my trash. The place for this was a covered plastic can in a
small storage closet in a corner. Inside the closet facing the door was
a little immaculate folding leaf table in deep reddish brown shiny finish
I was walking towards this closet when I was met by a large cat with black
and white fur. It got in my way, almost getting stepped on, rubbing and
wrapping its black tail on my legs, looking up at the plate of trash and
meowing as it walked with me just like a pet cat would do. It looked like
it was very hungry. I understood what it wanted so I picked the chicken
leg bone out of the plate and not having the proper cat dish on which to
put it I laid it on the table. In a flash the cat jumped on the table and
began attacking the chicken bone. To get a good grip on the bone, it laid
low with its right ear on the surface of the table as it grabbed on the
hip joint. It chewed on it for a little bit and then began shoving the
whole piece into its mouth. It made a mess on the immaculate table and
I was already thinking how to clean it up when the cat stood up, leg bone
in its mouth. Then it jumped down from the table. Now this was when the
unbelievable occurred.</B>
<BR><B>On jumping down, the cat vanished in mid air and never landed on
the floor. I saw the chicken leg bone, hazy as if it were behind a sheet
of thin waxed paper for may be a couple of seconds in the same air space
where the cat had disappeared then it too vanished into thin air! Not expecting
anything ghostly or paranormal at a time and place like this, I was just
so puzzled I even tried to look for the possible places where the cat could
have run into. From where I was standing I would have seen the cat run
away in any direction. But it didn't run away. It just vanished in its
air space a little above the floor and the chicken leg bone with it!</B>
<BR><B>All hair raised, I did not forget to clean up the mess left by the
vanishing cat. On my way out the kitchen I asked one of the helps who was
busy filling up some glasses with juices if she had seen a cat. She said
she hasn't seen one now but yes, black and white tom sitting right by the
closet door early that morning. I thought, my gosh, that was even before
I had come to lunch! I asked if the cat was a pet here. She said she has
never seen the cat before and thought it belonged to one of the residents.
I couldn't say anything more. I already knew I had a secret to keep.</B>
<BR><B>I went back to the gathering and never said a word about what I
had just witnessed. I did not want to cause a scare neither be looked at
as one of those possessed with a dented brain.</B>
<BR><B>If anyone has any credible explanation to or knows what this occurrence
is, please email me right away.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Hair Strand</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: RudyBM111743@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>The hair strand</B>
<BR><B>This paranormal episode occurred in 2002.&nbsp; It is not a very
long story, but very extraordinary and challenges every sort of explanation.&nbsp;
I do not know of any reason for the occurrence except the circumstance
during the time frame that it happened.</B>
<BR><B>I had a favorite reference book which I occasionally would read
during spare time. I had pulled it out from the shelf one night and opened
it to the page that I wanted. To my surprise, a long strand of thin dark
brown, presumably woman's hair was on the page. I picked it up and held
it between my fingers, wondering whose hair it was. I was intently examining
it when it suddenly disintegrated slowly like hair being burned by a match
beginning from its tip.&nbsp; But unlike burning hair which produces smoke,
this hair strand disintegrated into extremely fine particles which formed
a thin streak in mid air.&nbsp; The very minute particles were lustrous
bluish black flakes or scales resembling very finely ground mica or graphite.&nbsp;
They reflected light while flipping and turning in mid air.&nbsp; The streak
that was formed diffused into and vanished in the atmosphere.&nbsp; The
closest thing similar to this streak is a thin line of smoke from a cigarette.&nbsp;
I laid the hair strand down on the page and saw it continue to disintegrate
all the way to the very end of the strand. No trace of it was left on the
page. It was also during these days that I had been on the internet, reading
the apparitions at Lourdes, the life of Saint Bernadette and looking at
her pictures.</B>
<BR><B>I submitted this true paranormal occurrence with the purpose of
describing a substance that was probably sent from a life beyond.&nbsp;
Your views, specifically on the purpose for sending the substance and the
occurrence itself, are certainly welcome.</B>

<BR><B>Ghostly Guardians</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: JAWOLLMAN@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>My grandmother lives on a farm and I visited every summer up until
about a year ago.&nbsp; When my mother was a little girl, they tore the
house down and rebuilt it.&nbsp; Animals come and go quiet frequently,
many die within two or three years.&nbsp; There has always been a rule,
prohibiting any animal from entering her house, except for my uncle's hunting
dog, none have stepped foot in the house.&nbsp; Not that this is strange
on a farm.</B>
<BR><B>But here's where the story gets really weird.&nbsp; When I was younger,
I used to sleep in the corner bedroom, with my younger sister.&nbsp; I
had this paranoia that anything could just jump out at me, so every night,
before going to bed, I'd check the closet, under the bed, and out the windows.&nbsp;
The bedroom would be clear.&nbsp; But out one window, a dog-shaped shadow
would go running out to stand by one entrance to the farm, while another
one would go running out to the other.&nbsp; Normally this wouldn't be
all that scary on a farm, but many of the times, my grandmother had one
to no dogs on the farm, much less two.&nbsp; Another thing that freaked
me, the "dogs" would bark every time some drove down the backroad or turn
around in the driveway, as if protecting us.&nbsp; I was terribly afraid
of dogs and woke up the second one would start barking.&nbsp; When I woke
there seemed to be something sleeping in the bed next to me, something
that was not my little sister.&nbsp; It would soon become solid, looking
very much like a cat my mother described having as a child.&nbsp; This
also scared me, but the cat would purr and snuggle against me, making me
feel safe like when I was around my own cat, since they were about the
same size.&nbsp; I'd hold the cat and pet it, falling asleep.&nbsp; In
the morning, it'd be gone.&nbsp; There was night's when no one would turn
or drive down the backroad and it was deadly silent.&nbsp; This scared
me the most.&nbsp; I'd wake, just before dawn, terrified.&nbsp; The "cat"
would be there, curled up on my pillow and the "dogs" would jump up through
the wall, which was two and a half stories up, and sit there, watching
me.</B>
<BR><B>No one else sleeping in that room has ever reported seeing anything
unusual, or any old pets, so I have marked them as my personal guardians.&nbsp;
To this day, I haven't yet identified the "dogs" but the cat was my aunt's
as a young girl, appropriately named "Fat Cat."</B>
