</H3><P><B>by journeyman@sprynet.com</B>
<P>
<P>  <B>I graduated from Mercer University in Macon, GA; a small liberal
arts</B>
<P><B>college in a sleepy southern town. I became aware of an inhabitant
of my frat</B>
<P><B>house the winter of my freshman year when an I experienced Alice for
the</B>
<P><B>first time. The Kappa Alpha house is a stately gray two story building
that</B>
<P><B>dominates the surrounding campus. I'd always had a funny feeling about
the</B>
<P><B>house but always joked that it was one of the brothers from the early
part of</B>
<P><B>the century coming back to get us. The inhabitant of the KA house is
not that</B>
<P><B>of a young man but that of a young woman. </B>
<P><B>the land destined to become Mercer was a one time a small farm in then
rural</B>
<P><B>middle Georgia. It was owned by a man with an explosive temper who
eventaully</B>
<P><B>murdered his wife</B>
<P><B>over an imagined affair. He disposed of her body by entombing her within
a</B>
<P><B>closet in an upstairs room. Later renovation by Mercer would lead to
the</B>
<P><B>discovery of human bones and the answer to the wife's disappearance.</B>
<P>
<P><B>   The house, which stands on a slight hill, can be an imposing building
at</B>
<P><B>night. The creepiest part of the house was the stairway which lead
to the</B>
<P><B>upstair room where the bones were found. I've always half expected
to walk</B>
<P><B>through the massive front door, look up on the landing and see someone
or</B>
<P><B>something standing there.</B>
<P><B>That dimly lit landing was the scariest part of  the frat house until
I spent</B>
<P><B>one night studying upstairs.</B>
<P><B>I had just finished cramming for an early exam and was the only person
left</B>
<P><B>in the house. Before I left, I closed all the windows in the upstairs
room</B>
<P><B>and turned off all the lights in the house. I locked the front door
( we</B>
<P><B>didn't live in the house ) and proceeded down the front walkway. I
don't know</B>
<P><B>what caused me to turn my head but when I did I was stunned. The
entire</B>
<P><B>upstairs was brightly lit from every light and all of the windows were
open</B>
<P><B>with the curtains hanging out.</B>
<P><B>Needless to say, I turned and walked quickly across the street to my
dorm</B>
<P><B>with every hair on the back of my neck standing straight up. Later</B>
<P><B>conversations with my buddies revealed experiences such as footsteps
on the</B>
<P><B>wooden floor; a door which would slam in the upstairs room; pool table
balls</B>
<P><B>which would disappear or roll across the floors; and lights that
would</B>
<P><B>inexplicably turn off only to turn back on minutes later.</B>
<P>
<P><B>   There were never physical manifestations; only a cold feeling on
the back</B>
<P><B>of ones neck which was often enough to cause one to bolt from the house
at</B>
<P><B>night. We came to know the spirit in our house as Alice and came to
enjoy her</B>
<P><B>pranks. Alice was always playful; I guess it's just how a "young"
woman</B>
<P><B>surrounded by young men would act. Perhaps she's living a life that
she never</B>
<P><B>got to experience. In any event, she's still there and is the
unofficial</B>
<P><B>house mother to many young KA pledges at Mercer.</B>

</H3><P><B>By dolphin@kiss.net.au</B>
<P>
<P><B>Here is a true story that just recently happened to both me and my
boyfriend.</B>
<P><B>I live with my boyfriend in a top story (3rd floor apartment).  He
has always</B>
<P><B>said how when he was younger he and his mates used to try and conjure
up evil</B>
<P><B>spirits and were all into the Occult.  He stopped trying to contact
devils </B>
<P><B>etc. after a few evil things happened to him and ever since then
Clairvoyants</B>
<P><B>and Mediums have always said that he has dark shadows that follow him
around.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I on the other hand have never ever ever had anything happen to me,
all my </B>
<P><B>friends have strange experiences to talk about but I have none.  I
am away </B>
<P><B>interstate alot and my boyfriend has to stay by himself in the apartment.
 He</B>
<P><B>said that he couldn't see the dark shadows anymore (he used to be able
to see</B>
<P><B>them out of the corner of his eye) and I believed that they had left
him.  </B>
<P><B>Occasionally when I was speaking to him on the phone he would suddenly
say </B>
<P><B>"oh my god, what was that" and tell me that he had just seen something
small </B>
<P><B>(the size of a large dog I guess) and black dart across the loungeroom
floor </B>
<P><B>from one wall to another then totally dissapear. To be honest I never
truly </B>
<P><B>believed in what he had seen and didn't worry about it too much until
one </B>
<P><B>night in the apartment I went to bed early and my boyfriend stayed
up </B>
<P><B>watching T.V. in the loungeroom.  Our bedroom is at the end of a long
hallway</B>
<P><B>and I've always been a bit scared of the hall as it's very long and
dark. </B>
<P><B>About 2 hours after I went to bed I could hear this faint buzzing noise
which</B>
<P><B>sounded like it came from the other end of the hall near the loungeroom.
 I </B>
<P><B>just thought that my boyfriend was using some kind of electrical gadget
to </B>
<P><B>fix one of the computers that we had and didn't worry about it.  It
was a </B>
<P><B>very strange sounding buzzing that was slowly getting louder.  It sounded
</B>
<P><B>like whatever it was was coming down the hall, I started thinking that
it was</B>
<P><B>my boyfriend walking down the hall in the dark with some strange thing
to </B>
<P><B>play a joke on me (he knows I get scared easily).  The noise started
getting </B>
<P><B>unbareably loud and closer to my room.  I didn't have a bedside light
next to</B>
<P><B>the bed so I sat up in the dark trying to see into the hallway.  As
it was </B>
<P><B>about to come through the bedroom door the noise got unbareably loud
and I </B>
<P><B>was trying to figure out what on earth the noise could be from.  I
was still </B>
<P><B>slightly unsure if it was my boyfriend playing a joke on me or not.
I then </B>
<P><B>decided that it was a good idea to start pannicking and consider making
a run</B>
<P><B>for it out of the bedroom (which would mean going into the noise) when
my </B>
<P><B>boyfriend suddenly turned the hall light on and came down the hall.
</B>
<P><B>Everything stopped instantly, I screamed for my boyfriend to come into
the </B>
<P><B>room and started babbling about the noise and asking him did he hear
it and </B>
<P><B>what was it?.  Well of course he hadn't heard or seen anything and
had never </B>
<P><B>had this sort of thing happen before.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Well I eventually got over it (sort of) and tried not to think about
what it </B>
<P><B>was.  A couple of weeks later my boyfriend was in the apartment once
again by</B>
<P><B>himself and he was in the bathroom in the hallway (with no lights on
in the </B>
<P><B>hall) he was happily brushing his teeth when he felt this coldness
wash over </B>
<P><B>him he got the mega creeps and felt something walk by in the hall.
 As he </B>
<P><B>looked out of the bathroom into the darkness he said he saw a huge
shadow (no</B>
<P><B>particular shape) walk/move past the bathroom.  He followed it into
the </B>
<P><B>hallway and watched this extremely black shadow move slowly down the
hall and</B>
<P><B>into the bedroom and then just melt away into the darkness.</B>
<P>
<P><B>This all happened a couple of weeks ago so we're not sure if anything
else is</B>
<P><B>going to happen or not (I hope not).  I know one thing for sure....I
won't be</B>
<P><B>staying in the apartment alone!!!!</B>

<H3><A NAME="hooded figure">The Hooded Figure</A>
</H3><P><B>by eyash@prolog.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>It was late summer or early fall of 1971. My friend and I were
traveling</B>
<P><B>on a stretch of road which leads to a local township. It was around
9:00p.m.</B>
<P><B>We had traveled this road often to just ride and get out of the bordom
of the </B>
<P><B>nearby city in which we lived. All we did around those times was hang
out in</B>
<P><B>the parking lot of a Burger King.</B>
<P>
<P><B>   As I stated we had traveled this road many times without incident.
We</B>
<P><B>rode until we decided to turn around and head back to town and the
Burger</B>
<P><B>King. Along the road was a cemetary. We must have passed this area
dozens</B>
<P><B>and dozens of times. Anyway, on this particular night I was driving
down the</B>
<P><B>road and noticed a figure who seemed to be hitchhiking about 100 or
so</B>
<P><B>yards ahead. I said to my friend,"look at that guy hitchhicking there
at this</B>
<P><B>time of night by the cemetary". He nodded. Upon getting closer the
figure</B>
<P><B>apeared to be in a hooded robe, and holding an old time lantern. When
we</B>
<P><B>reached the figure he turned his head but there was NO face. It was
all</B>
<P><B>black! After passing the figure we turned our heads but saw nothing!
We </B>
<P><B>were both speechless. I sped back to Burger King and neither a word
was</B>
<P><B>said by anyone of us. At Burger King I asked my friend what he saw,
if</B>
<P><B>anything,</B>
<P><B>and he stated exactly what I saw! At the time I didn't tell him what
I saw</B>
<P><B>until he told me what he saw. Let it be known that we were not drinking
or</B>
<P><B>anything during the incident. To this day I still get chills when I
pass that</B>
<P><B>area.</B>

<H3><A NAME=corner>Corner of My Eye</A>
</H3><P><B>by dale@kalama.doe.Hawaii.Edu</B>
<P>
<P><B>This happened to me about 10 years ago in Pearl City Hawaii.  I'm a
very</B>
<P><B>skeptical person by nature but I can't explain what I saw one night.
 While </B>
<P><B>grading papers one night I thought I saw my wife standing 10 feet away
from </B>
<P><B>me out of the corner of my eye.  She just stood there staring at me.
 It was </B>
<P><B>about 11:30 at night so I thought she was going to come up behind me
and </B>
<P><B>scare me but she just stood there.  I had other things to do so I ignored
her and forgot</B>
<P><B>about her being there really until about 10 minutes later I looked
out the</B>
<P><B>corner of my eye and she was still standing there.  I went back to
work </B>
<P><B>thinking that she must be crazy.  A few minutes later I again looked
out the</B>
<P><B>corner of my eye and she was still there.  A good 15-20 minutes had
passed</B>
<P><B>since I first saw her.  I decided to turn towards her and scare her
so I </B>
<P><B>quickly turned in my chair and here is what I saw . . .it was a short
three</B>
<P><B>dimensional shadow which had its hands up in front of it waving them
up and </B>
<P><B>down.  Its face was featureless with no eyes or mouth.  The best way
to</B>
<P><B>describe it is as a guy in a black suit with a flat board over its
face.  </B>
<P><B>It was only there for a few seconds when it turned sidewards and jumped
off </B>
<P><B>into an adjoining family room.  I sat stunned for a few seconds and
then realized</B>
<P><B>that someone may have broken into my house.  Upon looking for "it"
and not</B>
<P><B>finding it I awoke my wife and told her what I saw.  </B>
<P><B>We had the Bishop from my church over the next day.  He told us he
blessed</B>
<P><B>the house years earlier when my brother inlaw was seeing things
floating</B>
<P><B>around the ceiling.  The part I saw my ghost in was an addition to
the house</B>
<P><B>and had never been blessed.  It was almost as if it was trying to get
to me</B>
<P><B>but couldn't.  My wife and I discussed seeing "people" out of the
corner</B>
<P><B>of our eyes constantly in that part of the house.  We never mentioned
it</B>
<P><B>to each other before since we didn't want to be seen as crazy.  She
said</B>
<P><B>she even saw a very large man standing in the doorway to our bedroom
as</B>
<P><B>she was reading in bed one day.  She could see him standing there out
of the</B>
<P><B>corner of her eyes but when she looked up, he was gone.</B>
<P><B>     Again, I'm very skeptical about these things and have come up
with many</B>
<P><B>explanations over the years but none of them explain why it stood
there</B>
<P><B>for over 15 minutes.  We only had one other experience in that house
which</B>
<P><B>I won't get into now, but even the "people" out of the corners of our
eyes</B>
<P><B>went away after the blessing.</B>

<H3><A NAME="haunted cemetary">Haunted Cemetary</A>
</H3><P><B>by ritad@dialnet.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>While in high school a few people got together and started spending
</B>
<P><B>all their time visting haunted places in the area.  Two of us are now
</B>
<P><B>telling others about what we have seen.  </B>
<P><B>  There is a cemetary in a near-by town (for the safety of others,
we </B>
<P><B>will not tell names because the neighbors like to chase people out
with </B>
<P><B>guns).  It is the only place that all of us agree is truly haunted.
 To </B>
<P><B>clarify things, there were about 30 of our friends involved.  However,
</B>
<P><B>we will not discuss what they claim to have happened while we were
not </B>
<P><B>there because we do not know that it happened.  We will tell you a
few </B>
<P><B>of the things that have happened to us over the past 3 years. </B>
<P><B> The first time we went to this place was Halloween night (I know it's
</B>
<P><B>corney, but it's true).  Anyway, one of us went into the cemetary while
</B>
<P><B>the other one waited in the car with a friend.  While in the cemetary,
</B>
<P><B>she did not see anything.  However, she smelled an overpowering oder
</B>
<P><B>that smelled of, as she says, death.  She also felt the feeling of
death </B>
<P><B>in the air.  It does not seem out of the ordinary, true.  But never
</B>
<P><B>since has the smell or feeling been present.  While she was in the
</B>
<P><B>cemetary, the ones in the car saw a man.  He was in a cluster of trees
</B>
<P><B>and looked like a KKK member dressed in red.</B>
<P><B>  I was the one in the car, who is now typing this.  The other is </B>
<P><B>helping me recall the events as I type.</B>
<P><B> Nothing much happened to her after that.  However, I went back many
</B>
<P><B>more times.  I have witnessed a "ghost fog" that followed me and a
few </B>
<P><B>other friends, heard voices that came from nobody, seen the shadowy
</B>
<P><B>figures that followed us around, seen people take on a change of sorts
</B>
<P><B>in their personality, and once a change in their physical appearance
(A </B>
<P><B>friend suddenly either got a very bad case of dry eyes or his eyes
glow </B>
<P><B>red naturally sometimes).</B>
<P><B> I know it all sounds crazy or like a story, but there a too many of
us </B>
<P><B>that have witnessed strange things to not have the opinion that this
is </B>
<P><B>one truly haunted cemetary!</B>

<H3><A NAME="talking with">Talking with the Spirits</A>
</H3><P><B>by starbrat@kktv.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am a fourth generation daughter with the ability to see and speak</B>
<P><B>with spirits still attached to this world. It is my gift and
sometimes</B>
<P><B>my curse. Over the course of my life, I have encountered quite a few</B>
<P><B>spirits that have made a lasting impression on my life. Some good.</B>
<P><B>Others bad. Here are a few of the most memorable for me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The first time I remember seeing a ghost, I was only six or seven</B>
<P><B>years old. I was on vacation with my family in the western part of</B>
<P><B>Colorado. I wondered away from our camp sight and became lost. I</B>
<P><B>wandered for what seemed hours before  I heard a beautiful flute</B>
<P><B>playing down by a stream. I followed the sound to a kindly old man
who</B>
<P><B>was dressed in buckskins and beads. Feathers hung from his gray hair.</B>
<P><B>He was as real to me as anything I had ever seen before. It wasn't</B>
<P><B>like popular cinematic views of a ghost. I could no more look through</B>
<P><B>him than I can my own hand.</B>
<P><B>After a short time, he stopped playing and turned to face me. He had</B>
<P><B>sad eyes, I always remember his eyes. He smiled and asked me where
my</B>
<P><B>parents were. He said I should not be wandering away like that. He</B>
<P><B>offered to take me back to my parents.</B>
<P><B>	He sang to me in his language as we walked through the woods. </B>
<P><B>When we got back to camp, I called out to my parents, but as they</B>
<P><B>turned around, I felt his hand let go of mine and he was sort of
fading</B>
<P><B>away into just an outline. I knew then that the nice old man was a</B>
<P><B>ghost. I wasn't afraid though.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	The next memorable ghost that crossed into my life was not so</B>
<P><B>kindhearted.</B>
<P><B>	This spirit, (I will refrain from using his name, use of a spirits</B>
<P><B>name only gives them power.) I encountered through a OUIJA board.</B>
<P><B>I was enrolled at Catholic school at the time. The school itself had
a</B>
<P><B>harmless spirit of a little boy who had fallen in a well and died.
To</B>
<P><B>this day he still resides there, but that is another story of its
own.</B>
<P><B>My classmates and I decided that we were going to try to speak to the</B>
<P><B>little boy who haunted our school using a OUIJA board. It was not a</B>
<P><B>very smart idea. We encountered a spirit who CLAIMED he was the
little</B>
<P><B>boy. He lied. He was a destructive and very evil entity.	We took turns
taking the OUIJA home with us, as we had all chipped in</B>
<P><B>to buy it. When it was my turn to have it for the week, the trouble</B>
<P><B>really started. First my bedroom began to grow cold and have a funny</B>
<P><B>smell to it. Then objects would move around on my dresser. I started</B>
<P><B>using the OUIJA board more and more. I was falling into what is
called</B>
<P><B>"progressive entrapment." </B>
<P><B>	When you use a OUIJA board, you open a doorway within yourself and</B>
<P><B>invite spirits into your body. After awhile, the spirit can trick you</B>
<P><B>into full possession. Before you know it, you have willingly let a</B>
<P><B>spirit become part of you. This is what was happening with me. My</B>
<P><B>personality was becoming altered. I was more of an angry vengeful</B>
<P><B>person as I took the spirit into me.</B>
<P><B>Finally I realized what was happening and went to the priest for our</B>
<P><B>school. I told him what was going on. He demanded the OUIJA board.
I</B>
<P><B>gave it to him willingly. Then he set up a time with my mother to
come</B>
<P><B>and bless the apartment.</B>
<P><B>When he got there that night, we opened the door to my bedroom to
find</B>
<P><B>it in chaos. The mattress of my bed was hovering upside-down, yet</B>
<P><B>perfectly made with the sheets and blankets, the air was cold and
foul,</B>
<P><B>there was a strange mist drifting around the bed.</B>
<P><B>The priest sprinkled holy water and demanded that the entity leave.</B>
<P><B>There was a great shriek and shaking of the room and then everything</B>
<P><B>was normal. It was a very scary experience. One I should have learned</B>
<P><B>from.</B>
<P><B>	To this day, I can not touch a OUIJA board. Every time I do, I </B>
<P><B>connect with the same spirit. Only a few years ago did I have another
</B>
<P><B>occasion to have a OUIJA and found myself in the same situation, only
a </B>
<P><B>little more advanced. After riding myself of the spirit twice, I can
assure</B>
<P><B>you that it is not wise to reinvite a destructive spirit back into
your</B>
<P><B>life, it gives them more power.</B>
<P><B>	</B>
<P><B>	That was not my final or most serious contact with an evil spirit.
</B>
<P><B>The worst event happened about five years ago, and to this day I still
have</B>
<P><B>nightmares about it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	My mother and I had moved in to a house with one of her friends. We</B>
<P><B>were going though some financial problems and sharing rent was better</B>
<P><B>than paying full rent. My mom's friend Karen (not her real name...</B>
<P><B>She'd kill me for using it!) had a daughter my own age... Kay (not
her</B>
<P><B>real name either) and we had the basement to ourselves, while our</B>
<P><B>mothers had the upstairs.</B>
<P><B>One night, I was woke up from a deep sleep by a cold chill and the</B>
<P><B>fact that someone had their hand on my leg and was slowly moving it
to</B>
<P><B>my thigh. I opened my eyes and saw a black wavering mass over me.
There</B>
<P><B>was no real form to the entity. I started to scream, but a cold hand</B>
<P><B>gripped my throat after the first weak shout escaped. A deep voice
told</B>
<P><B>me not to scream, that I was going to die. It said it had come to
take</B>
<P><B>me to hell.</B>
<P><B>About this time, Kay had heard my weak cry and had come to see what</B>
<P><B>was wrong. She said that she saw me about six inches off the bed,</B>
<P><B>indentations on my neck like there was a hand there. She screamed and</B>
<P><B>the entity flung me across the room with brutal force.</B>
<P><B>The next day, my leg had deep scratches on it and my neck was badly</B>
<P><B>bruised. The entity never came back, and I never felt it in the house</B>
<P><B>again. I don't know what happened that night.</B>
<P><B>Finally, to end this on a good note, I will tell you about the spirit</B>
<P><B>I live with now. He is a very kind, protective spirit with a passion</B>
<P><B>for stealing keys.</B>
<P><B>	Shortly after the incident explained above, I was out at the </B>
<P><B>cemetery with a friend, I stumbled across this grave sight, it was
from the</B>
<P><B>early 1800's. The stone was broken and covered with weeds. The</B>
<P><B>inscription read "You shall not be forgotten." There was a deep
sadness</B>
<P><B>connected with the grave. I felt bad that there had been a promise
made</B>
<P><B>to this person and it had been broken.</B>
<P><B>I went out there almost every week, clearing the weeds and grass away</B>
<P><B>from the stone, bringing flowers or other little gifts. It took the</B>
<P><B>spirit six months to "say" something to me. It was afraid if I knew
he</B>
<P><B>was there, I would stop coming.</B>
<P><B>Before long, Eddie (the spirits name) was coming home with me. I took</B>
<P><B>a chance inviting this spirit into my home. I was lucky. I wouldn't</B>
<P><B>recommend anyone else doing it unless you are prepared for what could</B>
<P><B>happen.</B>
<P><B>	Eddie has been a constant companion for these last years. He has </B>
<P><B>saved my life on two occasions. One, I was supposed to be in a car
that</B>
<P><B>crashed and everyone died. He prevented me from going by hiding my
own</B>
<P><B>keys. For if I had been able to drive to my friends house to car-pool</B>
<P><B>over to a party, I would have been killed.</B>
<P><B>Second. I had a man break into my apartment when I was living alone.
I</B>
<P><B>was getting out of the shower and heard someone in the apartment.</B>
<P><B>Thinking it was my boyfriend, I continued to dry and dress not
worried.</B>
<P><B>As I heard the footsteps coming toward the bathroom, the door slammed</B>
<P><B>violently and the lock (that can only be operated from the inside)</B>
<P><B>turned.</B>
<P><B>	Next I heard things flying about the apartment, there was a  </B>
<P><B>shrieking like I would never forget. It wasn't quite human. </B>
<P><B>When the door unlocked, there was the would be criminal unconscious</B>
<P><B>and tied up with a phone cord. The apartment looked as clean and as</B>
<P><B>intact as it had been when I got in the shower, despite the sounds
of</B>
<P><B>breaking dishes and glass and other noises.</B>
<P><B>That was a fun one to explain to the police. I told them what</B>
<P><B>happened. They didn't believe me until Eddie made his presence known,</B>
<P><B>by stealing the policeman's keys and them moving his notebook across</B>
<P><B>the table. It was funny to see the look on their face when that</B>
<P><B>happened... And when the keys just appeared out of thin air and
dropped</B>
<P><B>on the table in front of them.</B>
<P><B>	Eddie likes to play little pranks on my current boyfriend... He </B>
<P><B>steals his keys often. Especially if he thinks i am upset with my
boyfriend.</B>
<P><B>He is also known to move things away from me, like now... As I sit
her</B>
<P><B>typing, my glass of tea has moved from next to my keyboard to over
by</B>
<P><B>our fish tank, half way across the room.</B>
<P><B>	Our animals and Eddie seem to get along fine. Sometimes you can see</B>
<P><B>invisible hands petting one of the cats, or a dog toy rolling across</B>
<P><B>the floor on its own.</B>
<P><B>	I think we all have spirits around us. It is just a matter of seeing</B>
<P><B>and hearing them. All in all, you can't be afraid of them; not even
the</B>
<P><B>evil ones. You have to stand up for your space, you can offer to
share</B>
<P><B>it with those who are still earthbound, or you can demand that they</B>
<P><B>leave. One way or the other, you have to understand, that you are the</B>
<P><B>dominant entity and fear only gives them the power they need to
control</B>
<P><B>you.</B>
<P><B>	I am always interested in sharing stories and support with others
</B>
<P><B>that have spirits in their life. If you would care to E-Mail me at
the above</B>
<P><B>address, that would be fine. Some times it is nice to talk with other</B>
<P><B>people about a subject that most people find insane.</B>
