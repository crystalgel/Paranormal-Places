<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My Experiences at a Civil War
Home</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seminoles1975@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>For many years, I lived in
the Atlanta, Georgia area. For some unknown reason, I always felt as
though I
belonged there. Almost like I'd come home. To this day, I really can't
explain
it.&nbsp; At one time, a former plantation
(Bushy Park) was a popular restaurant called The Planters and, later,
The 1848
House. I believe it is now closed (what a pity). I fell completely in
love with
this home which was saved from burning as it was used as a union
hospital
during the war. I always felt as though it had really good karma. Even
though -
or perhaps because of the fact - it had seen some tragedy, it had
endured.
Because of that, we got married there. Our ceremony was held outside
under a
huge, old tree that had withstood the war between the states and
another
hundred plus years. While I was upstairs in one of the former bedrooms
dressing
for the celebration, I saw a young woman out of the corner of my eye.
She just passed
by the room and looked in. I didn't think anything of it at first
glance
because there were several of the staff readying the downstairs for our
party.
It didn't occur to me until after she had passed that her dress seemed
a little
fancy and out of date. It then washed over me that this wasn't someone
from
this day and age. This was a remnant of a much earlier time. I walked
out into
the hallway to see if I could see her again, but to no avail. She had
vanished.
The feeling I was left with was one of a wistful sadness. I completely
felt as
though she was happy for me, but somehow sad. There was one other
occurrence at
"Bushy Park." One year on our anniversary, my husband and I went to
The Planters for dinner. We had our anniversary dinner there every year
until
we moved out of state. As we waited on the porch for the valet to bring
our
car, two of the rockers right next to us started to softly rock. We
both were a
little surprised as there was no one sitting there, there was no one
else
around, and the wind was still. It was the kind of easy rock that
people do
when they are sitting and relaxing on a porch. There was surely nothing
even
slightly frightening about it. It just felt to me that there were some
old
friends having a nice, friendly chat.&nbsp; Years
later, there was a program on "Haunted Georgia" on one of the
cable-type channels (may have been Travel Channel). They featured a
segment on
Bushy Park. I sat with my jaw hanging when they started discussing
sightings of
a young woman in an upstairs window and the rockers that rock by
themselves. I
guess I shouldn't have been surprised, but this was the first instance
of a
televised program actually discussing sightings that I had experienced.
I
maintain that all of the energy I encountered at Bushy Park was
completely
benevolent. I hope that, one day, the home will be reopened as a
restaurant or
at least as a location for special events. I can't explain why I know
this, but
I do know that the spirits there actually enjoy the company and sharing
their
home with those of us in this world.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>More Experiences</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp; mixmasterm2005@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I figured I would share some
of the stuff that has been going on the past month with me since I like
sharing
my stories here. It was late at night and I was looking through the
cupboards
for something to eat and was arguing with myself about what I wanted. I
then
told myself I shouldn't be arguing with myself since no one was
listening
anyway. As soon as I said that one of the cupboard doors 5 feet away
from me
opened by itself. I looked back and saw that it was wide open and I
knew I
closed it all the way. I looked to see if something had opened it from
the
inside and there was nothing there. I closed and figured it was my moms
dead
stepfather who likes to play jokes opened it to tell me he was
listening and
probably wanted to give me a good jump. He struck again when my mom was
vacuuming the floor in the room behind me. I was listening to some
music on my
computer having the mouse in one hand and a drink in the other. She
then said
something to me but I thought nothing of it. She said something to me
again and
I turned and gave her a confused look. It wasn't until the third time
when she
turned the vacuum off and walked up to me and took my headphones off
and told
me to stop tapping her on the back when it was turned towards me. I
told her I
couldn't of since my hands weren't free. She then knew it was her dead
stepfather who liked to do that sort of thing when he was alive. About
a week
ago I was watching a paranormal show and my mom out of nowhere said she
doesn't
believe in that stuff(which she does) and that it doesn't exist. As the
day
went on and night hit she was sitting watching some tv while I was in
my room.
She then called my name sounding all panic like and I ran down the hall
to see
what was up. She then told me she saw a white mist appear near the side
of her
face then disappear. I told her maybe next time she better not lie and
say she
doesn't believe in spirits otherwise one will visit to prove her wrong.
Wasn't
sure if it was her dead stepfather or not. Anyways something happened a
few
nights ago I couldn't explain. I was staying with my best friend who
had just
come back from his trip to England who had his own story to tell me
about a
haunted castle he visited but i'll leave that one for him to share. We
were
walking to the store about half an hour away from where he lived. We
got there
and saw my mom drive in and talked to her for a bit before going into
the
store. She had left while we were in there and got our stuff when we
saw it
start to rain. We figured we'd go outside and sit on one of the benches
until
it passed. Well it then started to thunderstorm causing a big downpour
so we
went back in the store and waited it out a little more. When we were in
there this
fowl stench hit some of the people waiting to leave which smelt like
someone
stepped in crap. We all checked our shoes and there was none to be
found. The
store was finally closed and we were stranded outside finding ourselves
walking
back to his place. We noticed something very odd and it was when we
were in the
store for about an hour we noticed the lightning was close to the store
and
when we left it started to follow us back to my friends place. The
lightning
also seemed to be surrounding us always hitting places not too far from
us. The
downpour turned to showers as soon as we hit my friends road. We were
still a
good mile away from where he actually lived and my best friend started
noticing
stuff going on around the field near us. He kept seeing figures
surrounding us
a good distance away in the field and woods. For some reason I wasn't
noticing
anything which seemed pretty weird to me. To my best friend it seemed
to be a
pack of six demons that would disappear whenever the lightning would
appear. It
wasn't until half a mile away when things started to get interesting.
We were
walking down the stretch of dirt road leading to his place passing the
houses
which were in fields themselves. My friend could still sense the demons
following us all around the place while I was still not sensing or
seeing
anything. We then hit his dads place that he had still been working on
and
noticed the trashcan pretty much in the middle of the road looking like
something knocked it over when there was no animal or footprints
showing
something was there. We passed the place and I all of a sudden got
dizzy and
started sensing the demons around us. We started walking really slowly
trying
not to be noticed by them and heard a snapping sound close to us like
something
stepped on a twig. I started looking on the left side as he watched the
right
as we continued walking getting a very strong uncomfortable feeling as
the rain
stopped and it was dead quiet. We eventually hit his dads smelt camps
getting
close to my friends place and could sense the demons hiding behind them
waiting
for us to drop our guard. We passed the camps and looked behind us
seeing they
were watching us waiting to turn back around so they could jump us. We
reached
our destination and talked about what went down still sensing the
demons
running around the place wanting us to come out. We knew better and
didn't do
it but we both talked about how fierce the thunderstorm was and how it
seemed
to be protecting us by keeping the demons away from us so they couldn't
do
anything to us. My friend was telling me they always seem to target him
even
when he's by himself but probably wouldn't bother me. The place where
he lives
always seems to have much stronger activity than where I live since he
lives in
a pretty wooded area. Since we've investigated there separately or
together
there's been a possesion of one of my friends dogs that's happened
twice, white
orbs surrounding the place, the front door opening by itself, a tree
trunk with
moths surrounding it out in the woods, and the moon(full or half) being
blood
red as it came up then suddenly setting which we've both seen where
we've
lived. We were surprised we didn't hear the hanging demon which resides
close
to their and both thought he might've been driven away by more stronger
demons
like the ones we experienced. We even surprisingly could smell the fowl
smell
of crap along with flies flying around us. The activity soon stopped
and my
friend decided to not go looking for this type of stuff anymore even
though we
weren't looking for them in the first place. I will still keep my
sights open
to anything that might wind up where I live causing crazier
experiences. Thanks
for letting me share another one of my stories.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Ghosts and Hauntings</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>&nbsp;</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; invershecky77@aol.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>&nbsp;</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I was adopted as a young teen
boy to a lady who had a son slightly older than me, and after moving in
with
them, I became aware of an Adult Female Ghost called "Gramma" and a
young Ghost boy dressed in 1900's style clothes.&nbsp; Turns out the
boy was her son (who seems to
have died at a young age) and they both died in the old family house
(but at
different times though), plus my adopted Mom showed me some old family
photo's,
and I correctly picked out their photo.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>&nbsp;</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Also, whenever I was upset or
crying, I would see her more, like she was checking on me out of
concern, (and
she also did this to Joey, my adopted Brother) plus whenever she would
Ghostly
visit us, she would leave a scent of her perfume that she wore when she
was
alive, and Mom called it "White Shoulders".&nbsp; Also if either Joey
or I kicked our covers
off, she would come and cover us back up, because we could see and feel
the
covers move then, also when Joey or I would be in the Bathroom, we
would
sometimes see only the Ghost Boy looking at us, like he was lonely and
wanted
to play, but it kind of made us feel weird when we were naked, but
gladly the
Ghostly Lady never peeked in on us when we were there!&nbsp; This
acceptance by the Ghosts helped me
through a very difficult time in my life, the deaths of my real
parents, and
also made me feel like I was part of their extended family.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Black Cloaked Figure</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp; kat051985@yahoo.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>We moved into a house in June
2004 off the highway down a long gravel driveway in Western Illinois.&nbsp;
I little history on the house.&nbsp; The original house that stood on
the ground
burned down in the late 50's early 60's.&nbsp;
It was caused by the dryer.&nbsp; The
new ranch style house that my parents still live in was built soon
after.&nbsp; So who knows what kind of happening happened
on this land prior to this.&nbsp; The first
night we stayed in the house was the first night we started to notice
something
strange.&nbsp; I was sleeping on the floor in
my room and my dad was asleep in my parents my mom was going to use the
bathroom before heading to bed but when she looked into the bathroom
she seen
standing between the tolit and tub a less than four foot cloaked black
figure
kinda leaning toward the tolit standing there she hurried and flicked
on the
light and it was gone.&nbsp; She said that the
bathroom wasn't completely dark because the moonlight was coming
through the
window so she knows that she saw what she saw.&nbsp;
She told me about it and I believed her of course but it was a new
house
and we were like lets just forget about it.&nbsp;
In December of '04 several months after moving in my mom got up in the
middle of the night to use the bathroom she said she felt like there
was
something walking in front of her down the hall and when she got back
into bed
she thought she seen something by the bedroom door.&nbsp; Also around
that time she saw a bright light
shine through the window.&nbsp; It shone
through the back window so she knew it wasn't a headlight of a car from
up on
the highway and theres nothing but woods and a field behind the house.&nbsp;
In April of '05 my mom and I were not home my
dad and brother were the only ones staying there that night.&nbsp; At 4
am my brother awoke and felt as if
something was looking at him from outside his bedroom window.&nbsp; He
was so scared because of the feeling but
two he didn't have any curtains on his windows.&nbsp;
He went to sleep on the couch in the livingroom which wasn't much
better
because at the time the windows in there had no coverings as well.&nbsp;
He still felt as if whatever was outside was
watching him but finally was able to fall asleep.&nbsp; He was awoken
by something walking through
the diningroom into the livingroom, then whatever it was sat on his
upper legs
and he felt like couldn't move he said he felt like it lasted several
minutes
but it probably was only seconds.&nbsp; He
also said during this he could move or breathe.&nbsp;
After whatever it was got up he was finally able to move and
breathe.&nbsp; He got up and went into the
kitchen and looked out the window which faces the driveway and a field
and he
saw what looked like a black cloaked figure standing near the field.&nbsp;
July 2006 It was morning probably before 8 am
my mom was on the computer and she thought my dad had pulled up in the
driveway
then she hears the screen door slam that leads into the garage seem
normal
until no one comes inside.&nbsp; Then she
hears a door slam shut in the house.&nbsp; All
the doors are open as shes doing this she hears another one slam and
decided
not to investigate any further.&nbsp; Hearing
phantom cars pull up in the driveway and either get out or don't
happens to
this day still it is really weird to experience.&nbsp; About a day or
so after this my brother was
in the kitchen and heard a woman's voice say my moms name but he said
she
didn't sound creepy or evil.&nbsp; In 2005 my
mom and I had just gotten back from town and as we're pulling up the
long
driveway I saw a black figure standing behind the lamp that sits in
front of
the livingroom window&nbsp; I didn't say
anything at first but then my mom said she just seen the samething!&nbsp;
We knew that it wasn't the lamp we were
seeing because this things was probably standing in the middle of the
room and
nothing stands right smack in the middle of the room.&nbsp; October
2007 My mom awoke one night to see
the Cloaked One as we had begun to call it standing by the reclyner it
had
yellow eyes and didn't stand very tall like when she first saw it.&nbsp;
There are more stories that are more recent
which I will tell later or if your interested and don't want to wait
you can
email me for them.&nbsp; Thanks for taking
your time and reading.</big><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
