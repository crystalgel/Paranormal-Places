<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">By:bjbales1979@alltel.net <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I met my first ghost when I
was four years old, in the bathroom of the first house I can clearly remember
living in, and ever since then, I&#8217;ve been &#8220;chased&#8221; by them. The first ghost was
a young boy in overalls and a button-down shirt and a straw hat. He looked to be
about six years old and didn&#8217;t do anything except stand there in the bathroom
watching as I brushed my teeth. He appeared there several times over the next
few months until my family moved to a house just up the road.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">In the new house, which was
on the same property, I never felt comfortable. Sometimes at night I woke up,
hearing someone calling my name, but the voice was unfamiliar. I was always too
afraid to get out of bed and assumed that if it was my mother or father calling
me, they would come to get me. The house was always cold, as I&#8217;m told
newly-built houses usually are for awhile, but even years after we moved in
there was always a chill in the air that neither the electric heat nor the
wood-buning stove could chase away, even in summer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The first time anything
appeared to me in that house, I was seven and my brother Josh was a few months
old. His crib was kept in my room and I was always the first to wake up when he
was crying. One night in March, when Josh was five months old, he was crying
and woke me. I sat up in bed and waited for Mom to come in and get him, and as
I looked out my bedroom window I saw something silvery and translucent standing
on the railing of the deck on the back of the house. As my eyes came into focus
I made out the vague figure of a heavyset woman with a little boy in her arms,
the same little boy who&#8217;d appeared to me in the bathroom of the old house three
years before. She extended her arms and held him, dangling from her hands, and
then let him go. I quickly closed my eyes, not wanting to see what happened. I
heard the sound of a child crying. I covered my head with my pillow and tried
to go back to sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Through the rest of my
childhood, there were many more appearances of this type. I saw a male ghost
that I presumed to be the father of the little boy ghost, a much younger little
girl ghost, and an older girl who had a distressed look about her, as if she&#8217;d
been through something horrible. Her clothes were ragged and torn up and
appeared to be stained with something dark; I speculated that it might have
been blood. And every year, on the night of August 1st, I lay awake at night
listening to the sounds of children screaming.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I gave up trying to explain
the sights and sounds to my parents, who just laughed at me. Their excuses for
not believing me went from inadequate to just ridiculous. At one point when I
was eleven or twelve years old, they told me ghosts don&#8217;t haunt new houses
because they can&#8217;t make enough noise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">All that changed when I was
fifteen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My mom and I were up late
watching a movie after she had come in from work. Around </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="2"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">2am</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, she drifted off to sleep and I
went to the kitchen for a glass of water. When I came back she was sitting bolt
upright on the couch where she&#8217;d been lying asleep. Her eyes were wide and fearful
and she was pointing at the front window. I followed her gaze and in the light
on the front porch, I saw the shadow of a man hanging from a rope. Together,
Mom and I opened the front door to investigate but nothing was there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Mom was proactive; she began
researching the farm we lived on, desperate to find any reason for the
hauntings we were experiencing. In the meantime, I experienced more and more
alarming sightings. I found old toys under my bed, rag dolls with button eyes
that were pulled loose and wooden pop-guns and handmade bears, all of them
dirty and obviously ancient. The two small children kept appearing wherever I
was, calling my name and tugging on my clothes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The most frightening thing
happened a few weeks before I left for college. I was packing up my books and
CDs and felt an unwelcome chill; it was early August again, about the same time
I always had the most intense experiences. I stood up and moved the box I was
packing, and when I turned around, I saw a large man in the corner of my room.
He was different from any of the other ghosts I&#8217;d seen, with a darker coloring
and sharper, more defined details. He was wearing dark clothes and had his back
turned to me. I looked closely and saw that there was someone with him, someone
he&#8217;d backed into the corner, the older girl from the family of ghosts I&#8217;d been
seeing for years. He was harming her, though I couldn&#8217;t tell if he was just
beating her or trying to rape her or what, but she was crying and screaming and
it was absolutely bone-chilling. As I stood there in the room watching, the
other male ghost came into the room holding an ax and approached the other two
in the corner. I couldn&#8217;t watch and ran out of the room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Over the next few years my
mother documented everything she&#8217;d seen and heard in the house, ranging from
the same sorts of things I had seen to some even more aggressive appearances.
One day in early August a couple of years after I left for college, she was in
the barn watering the horses and tripped over an ax with a blood-stained blade.
Neither my father nor my brothers could account for its appearance. Later that
same year she was cleaning out the basement and came across a noose that she
knows none of our family had put there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Her research on the farm
and the original house that stood on the land revealed that it had once
belonged to a wealthy family named Hawkins. The father, Thomas, was convicted
in 1893 of the murder of a young man named James Logan after discovering him in
his daughter Frances&#8217;s bedroom. Thomas was hanged later that year and his wife
Josephine and their two young children were killed during a tornado in March of
the next year and the property was sold at auction the following August, a year
after the murder of James Logan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">After our Juinor prom I was
walking with some of my friends we walked over to the blechers we were talking
about the guys we had been with at the prom when we stepped upon the blechers
one of my friends stopped talking and said "lets go guys" "why"
we all asked she told us that she suddenly felt a cold sensastion but we walked
on anyways we sat down on one of the benches on the bleachers but we herd
footsteps still walking we all stopped taking and everything went silent then
again we herd footsteps they grew louder louder soon after we herd screaming
and then soft slow crying. On graduation day later that night we went out for
some pizza and stopped by the bleachers to meet some friend but they never
showed so we left without them. As we went to the car we herd someone walking
on the bleachers but no one was there! Me and my friends went over to check it
out thinking it might be one of our friends as we were looking we suddenly felt
a cold sensastion as we had the year before. A moment after we herd crying
which turned into screaming!!! we saw a young girl running acrossed the
bleachers I reconized her face from school a few years ago she dissapeared into
thin air. I wondered what it was so I did some reseach and found out it was a
girl in my grade she had just broke up with her boyfriend and her grades were
very low after school she went to put her prom dress on after words she hung
herself under the bleacher at Copper Hills high school before she hung her she
wrote on the sand under the bleachers "I wll miss you" now I'am all
grown up with a beautiful baby girl I take her to see the high school girls
grave every year this year on October 6 will make it 3 years!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I have had 2 0r 3 very
personal experiences I would like to relate if I can kep this until I find the
time to write them,I lived in a haunted house once and visited another several
times, while i was growing up. these were all old double brick mansions built
during the slave days in Kentucky one was in masonville Ky the other was in
utica route south of red hill Ky.the one in Utica we spent sedveral weeks in
until one night things got so rough we moved out and into an old store
building. I dont have time to go into all the detailxs here but one night after
I had gone to church across the lil valle from where the old house was located.
I came home Bicycle of course,went upstairs got ready for bed put the front
door in front of where it used to hang (off the hinges)it was 2 in thick solid
wood dor I remember it was very heavy. I was staying with my sister and her
husbnd working for them,they had two small children at the time, that night I
had a strange visitor I heard a noise followed by something jumping up on my
bed well I was scard so I turned on the electric light which was accomplished
by pulling on a string overhead, well it took me several seconds to find the
string so I added a piece of string onto it ran it up to the head of the bed
where I coud reach up wave my arms till I hit it. then when I turned it on
everything got quiet so said to myself Ill try it again well the same thing
happened again I hear this strange noise like a mouse comming down the corner
from the attic. gthen her a plunk like it had jumped upon the bed by my pillow,
so I pulled the string again all was quiet. so I said well ill not be outdone
so I tucked allfour corners of the covers in under me took th string to bed
with me. turned out the light same sounds as before only this time the bed
started shaking up and down like someone was jumping up and down on a
trampoliene, well I wasnt going to go anywhere causeI knew my bro -in-law didnt
believe in such tings so I stayed on holding onto the sides of the bed so I
wouldnt fall off and eventually it got quiet and I got to sleep. well next
morning I came down for breakfast my bro in-law looked up and asked me did
anything strane happen last nite or did you hear anything I said yes but didnt
go no furthr cause he immediately said thats it we are moving today without me
telling him what happened well we had livestock on the place so when we went
down in the slave basement to get the calf feed which had outside entrance to
it there in the basementfloor was the floor where he had slept the night
before. now this floor had 2 X12 beams holding it up all looked sawed thru
exactly even like a hand saw had cut thru the ends of everyone no sawdust just
looked sawed thru. well we moved our livestock out that day and I never went
back again, but while wqe wqere getting ready to move in my older bro and me
got down in the old cistern cleaned it out with what water as was there then
restored the wooden trough to let rain re-fill it .as I remember we got 15.00
dollars each for cleaning it. we were there about a month or so. not sure now
it was before I went into the service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to visit my father's grave and was standing just looking around when I saw a
woman standing near a tree looking at me. It was about 50 ft. away. She was
wearing a peach or pink colored suit. I looked around for other cars as I
hadn't seen any when I approached. When I looked back to her just seconds
later, she was gone. I went to look to see if she was behind a tree, but she
was no where to be found.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I knelt in front of the
bath tub in my home giving my children a bath one afternoon on a hot summer day
in 1984.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had left the bathroom door
open because of the temperature that day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Before long I heard heavy, long striding, fast moving boot steps coming
down the hall way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I assumed it was my
husband coming home. The boot steps walked past the bathroom and continued down
the hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I finished bathing the
children who by now wanted to go see their Daddy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I walk down the hall, where the boot steps
went, I did not find my husband there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
looked around the house, but seen no one.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I called his work to find him still there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ask him if he had been home that day, and
he reply, "No, he had not".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'Someone' had marched right threw my house and kept on going.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">It was a brief, but strange
experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have to assume some
soldier boy is still on patrol out there somewhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have never since that time experienced
anything like that again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My husband and I were house
hunting over 15 years ago when our Realtor showed us a house that scared the
living daylights out of us. The house was large and had a courtyard in the
middle, with a neglected pond in the center of it. When we walked into the
house I felt uneasy, but decided that it was just strange looking at someone
else's house. As we worked our way to the back of the house I became more and
more nervous. I was checking out the half bath near the smaller bed rooms and
suddenly knew absolutely for certain that something nasty was waiting behind
the shower curtain. I actually had to work myself up to pulling the shower
curtain aside. Of course, nothing was there. I'm sure I came out of that
bathroom wide eyed and squirrely looking. As I exited my husband called to me
to come look at something. I found him in a small bedroom that had been painted
black and had unsavory symbols and designs on the walls. We quickly exited the
house and got into our car to leave that house far behind. I wasn't going to
say anything, except that I was not interested in acquiring that particular
house, when my husband exclaimed 'That house really gave me the willies!' I was
so surprised, because he is really not prone to that sort of thing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">That was the only house
that ever affected us that way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

converted to flats.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ghost of a man
in period costume stands at the window, on a full moon. He is aware that you
are watching him, and each night he gets closer to the bed.....The last night
he was peering into my face, and winked at me, before
disappearing.....(Apparently the house was owned by an artist who liked to
paint by the light of the moon, which may explain the haunting???) There are
cold spots downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, every June
on a certain night, everybody sleeping in the house has strange dreams....Also
the house was owned by an author called Henty...Several times I dreamed of
beautiful poems,and the titles of books for me to write...I dreamed that a
young nurse hanged herself because she failed her exams,then found out the
following week that the house was once a nursing home.....My daughter told me
she had a friend ( a child) who visited her at night and stood at the end of
the bed....The house is a Georgian mansion,and you can feel its history.A very
spiritual house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I often dream of the
house, perhaps my spirit is there, even in life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, that's all I can tell you, but I am
very psychic. I see into the future,which I don't always like, I do palm
readings and tarot too. I live in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Spain</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> now, and
once took a photograph of myneighbours area. When the photo was developed there
was a small child sitting there, which we could not see when we took the
picture. My Spanish neighbour went white when I showed it to her. She is
convinced it is the ghost of her stillborn child!!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I work really early in the
morning, so by the time I get off of work and head home, I'm really tired. I
was sneaking in a nap before my husband came home. I have seen some unexplained
things when I was younger, but I have never had this happen to me. This was in
my parents basement because at that time, my husband and I were building a
house. When I think about it, the dogs never came down in the room. They hated
it down there. Anyways....<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Like I said I was taking a
nap. I remember waking up in complete horror. I was being attacked. By this I
mean this "shadow figure" was trying to get at me while I was asleep.
It started at the foot of my bed and I was kicking my feet at it to get it away
from me. It then moved up right next to me. I can feel it trying to touch me
and that horrified me. Something about it thing was not right. I was still
kicking my legs at it. I remember thinking in my head, "no! no! no!"
I then sat up straight in bed and looked around...nothing was there. My heart
was pounding and I was sweating. I didn't know what to think. I still don't. I
wasn't fully awake during this fight ot keep this shadow away from me. I guess
I could have been dreaming, but it felt so real.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My first, and so far only,
experience with a ghost happened about four years ago, when I was eight or
nine. earlier that day, my youngeer brother and I had gotten kites and put them
together, later that same day, I heard this big cracking sound, I went to see
what happened. I thought the sound came from my room, so I looked in there,
and, there, right where I had placed my new kite, was a broken, mangled thing
that had once been a kite. My mom and I concluded that it had to have been a
ghost, for there was nobody in that part of the house at that time. Since that
day, my mom often has dreams that either slightly predict the future, or
contain ghostly figures.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

happened to me when I was in the third grade and haven't been able to forget
since then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am now 25.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember very distinctly that it was
Halloween night and my brother father and I had just returned from a night of
trick or treating, it was almost </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="0"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">midnight</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> when my
parents sent us to bed worried we wouldn't wake up in time for school the next
day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this time, being so young, and
so close to the border, I shared a room with my nanny, we slept on 2 twin beds.
Mine was situated right under a window to my left and my feet pointed towards
an adjoining room we called the laundry room that also doubled as a closet.
There was a window in there as well which illuminated to little room with light
from the moon in conjunction with the street lamps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this time, our house did not have central
air so we slept with the windows open and a floor oscillating fan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had been asleep for a while and I woke up
because I felt hot and looked at the fan as the blades had a tendency to
jam.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I had suspected, the fan wasn't
working and I stared at the ceiling contemplating going to the kitchen for a
glass of water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While doing so, I
happened to glance into the 'closet',and standing in front of the washer was
the figure of a man dressed all in black and wearing some type of hat,a fedora
maybe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also his face was not visible to
be and all I could see was black underneath his hat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was chuckling but at the time I thought it
was the most horrifying noise in the world.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He started to talk,very casually about how he was going to get me and my
family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I snapped,and finally realized
that this wasnt supposed to be happening,he wasnt supposed to be there, where
was his face???<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I jumped up from the bed
and sprinted to the door hopping at the same time not wanting anything to be
able to reach out and grab me,I could still hear him laughing and I felt him
getting closer. I noticed a faint banging that kept getting louder as I got
closer to the door.I then realized it was my brother banging on his wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was when I realized that I was screaming
at the top of my lungs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I reached the
door and no matter how hard I pulled on it,it would not open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also tried turning on the lights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a dimmer and I kept turning the knob
but it would not turn on.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Suddenly,my
nanny woke up and yelled at me to stop screaming and asking what was wrong was
i crazy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then,just as suddenly as it had
began,the laughing and whispering and everything else stopped,the door opened
and the light turned on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My parents had
no idea what was going on because their room was at the other side of the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My nanny still tells me that I
was white as a ghost and as soon as she touched me,I fainted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say,I was not able to go to
school the next day<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When I was about 7 years
old I can remember this very strange house in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">West
  Virginia</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> I use to live in. First it
started with my brothers and sisters and I. We all had one bedroom upstairs we
slept in and one night waking up I saw a strange figure of a little child by
our bed I recall turning the oppisite way and holding on to my older sister.
Being that age I never thought nothing of it until about 8 years later my
family and i moved out and we were talking about how nice it was to live there
and my mother and father were telling us if we only knew the strange things
they seen and heard. My father said he woke up one night seeing a little child
and thinking it was one of us and he said go back to bed and the figure never
moved so he set up from the bed relizing it was a shadowy figure and not one of
us and when we went to wake my mother up it was gone and other times he or my
mother would get up in the middle of the night and see that figure all the time
thinking it was ok nothing bad was really happening. A few months after that he
heard loud noises like a baby crying he said it sounded like it was coming from
the wall. My father would really have loved to know about the spirits but my
mother really wanted to move. Its funny how when your little you really dont
know whats going on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

would rock in the rocking chair and when my grandma and mom would come in the
room they would see the chair rocking and I would say that I am talking to the
lady. When doing laundry in the creepy basement, all the clothes were always
inside out when they came out of the dryer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My grandmother found underwear in her drawer for an obese woman, that
came out of nowhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were always
gusts of beautiful fragrant perfumes in the kitchen, I'd compliment my
grandmother on her perfume and everyone would say that is pretty, scary because
no perfume was allowed in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
grandfather was highly allergic to perfume.<span style="">&nbsp;

attending school there, I heard stories passed around by faculty that made
hairs stand up n my body and my eyes fill up with tears.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The story ws of a boy who was drafted into
the Vietnam War who died very soon after.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His ghost haunts the school and you can hear him running up and doen the
hall, his sneakers squeaking and nobody is there. The school is two stories so
if you hear this noise and you're at the end of a hall and run up or down the
stairs quick, you would see someone if they were not a ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many times I tried to see who was running but
there would never be anyone, down or up and the classes were full, no students
were in the hall when you would hear this.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I remember hearing the rubber soles squeaking and trying to see who it
was, it was never anybody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The school is
crapy and cold and doors slam out of nowhere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in my room and we sat down on the floor and took a breath and laughed and as
soon as we finished our last deep breath to hit eachother with pillows asgin
the light went out in my room and my sister and I screamed becasue none of the
other lights went out in the house and we came out screaming saying mom mom
there is a ghost in my room! And the lady on the line talking to my mother
about the cable she asked my mom if everything was ok? And she kept asking are
your kids ok? and My mom finally said yes they are. and then I looked in the
hallway toward my room and there was a white mist going different ways and the
light turned back on in my room and I was scared to say anything i said mom did

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Hi, when I was little I
used to play outside a lot. In my country, the weather is really, really hot
that if you stay under the sun for five minutes and then go back inside your
head hurts and you will see lights everywhere for a while. I always used to see
figures that those lights will make but I wasn&#8217;t scared at all because I knew
that the sun was making them. One day, I was outside playing with my brother but
it wasn&#8217;t as hot to make your head hurt or see figures and lights. I saw a
shape of a black dog walking or going somewhere and then it disappeared. Well,
the dog wasn&#8217;t walking, he was just going somewhere. The figure was not
perfectly clear to say that it was definitely a dog, but it really looked like
one and once I saw it I didn&#8217;t say anything because I was used to seeing things
because of the strong sun. But as soon as I saw it disappeared my brother said:
Hey!!! Did you see that figure of that black dog that went by and disappeared?
. I was shocked!! Because I thought I was the only one that saw that weird
thing, it was crazy! So that was a very strange experience. We both asked each
other what the heck that was. We were very confused. I&#8217;m sure that the figure
we saw was a ghost.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Ever since I was about 3
yrs old (I am now 28) I can remember distinct instances of paranormal activity
and spirit hauntings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The house I grew up in, my
mother's house, is haunted by an older lady who passed in mom's bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The very first instance I can recall was when
I was 3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I woke up in the middle of the
night to hear several "grown ups" in the living room, as if a party
were happening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got out of bed and
went into the living room to get some attention, and maybe sneak a snack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I opened the living room door, no one
was there, and the entire house was pitch black.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet I KNOW what I had heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, mom didn't believe me, and sent me
back to bed, terrified.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">A few years ago, when I was
pregnant with my son, my ex and I lived in a defunct ski resort rental condo. I
would be alone in the house and hear someone whispering my name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew it was a spirit, and tried to talk to
them, but never got an answer after the initial attention-getting call.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Things would often dissappear from the
condo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A big can of baby formula
vanished into thin air, never to be seen again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Once I put the stereo remote down on the coffee table, got up and went
into the kitchen, came back, and it was just gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After we had moved out of the condo, 6 mos
later, we found the remote in my son's diaper bag, right on top of his
onesies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had clearly not been there previously.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Last year I bought a
"haunted" item from ebay, an irish/celtic cross necklace found in a
cemetary in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Ireland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I made the mistake of leaving it on my
nightstand one night while I was asleep, and it was by far the worst night of
my life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I dreamt of a little girl named
"Sarah" or "Catherine" who had been murdered by her
mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At one point I woke up to see on
old, small, weathered rocking chair rocking alone next to my bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have never owned a rocking chair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I woke up again to find the necklace on me,
and I had not put it there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I gave it to
a friend the next day, and the following day she brought it back, saying she
had dreamt of an older lady killing both of her cats.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oddly enough, I had not told her anything
about the cross, and both of her her cats had gotten out of the apartment that
night (even thought all the doors were locked) and were later found cowering
behind a washing machine in the basement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My friend gave the necklace to her mother the following day (I surely
didn't want it back!) and her mother gave it away the next day as well, only
explaining "I just don't like it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
don't wanna get into it,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>just do not
want it."<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I now live in a rental
house that was built in 1775.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My son,
myself, and my sister have all seen a "shadow man" roaming around the
house and backyard at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other
night, my son came downstairs to complain about the shadow man pacing in his
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was a bit freaked myself, it
being 11:30ish, and I did the mom thing, telling him "There's nothing to
be afraid of, sweetie."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as
I'd said it, the kitchen light went out on us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I screamed and we ran into the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the kitchen light went back on by
itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it had been a fuse, I could
have dealt with it, but that would not explain the light turning itself back on
2 minutes later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I am not sure why the dead
seem to like me so much, but they've ben around me my whole life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have been able to predict the future
through my dreams, and communicate with deceased loved ones through dreams as
well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, that's just life as I know
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>C'est la vie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

HOUSE(this is a true story)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When I was a girl around
the age of eleven my mother and I went to clean this big farm house we were
getting ready to move into.We moved around alot so this was something I was use
to doing.I had always done everything my mom asked me to do.I was not the kind
of child who tells a little lie to get out of some chore. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My mother asked me to go
upstairs and clean the heat registers and windowsills.I hurried because the
whole time I felt as though someone was watching me.I had never felt this
sensation before.It was not just the feeling of being watched but the feeling I
was beeing watched by something very evil.When I finished my mom had me vacum
the upstairs and it was while i was vacuming that I heard someone humming right
behind me.I looked behind me but noone was there and the humming continued.I shut
the vacum off and the humming stopped.Thinking maybe it was the vacum I went
ahead and turned the vaccum back on.This time the humming didnt start right
when the vaccum did.I shut it off and lied telling my mother that I was
done.While she finished up what she was doing I went out to look around the
prperty. When I got back to the barn I had that feeling of being watched
again.I went back in the house and stuck with my mom until it was time to
go.When we moved in I didnt have any encounters for a long while.Then I started
to have dreams.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">In one dream there is a
girl with wavy long brown hair who is trying to eascape two hunters who want to
kill her.My parents hide the girl in our cellar and go to town as soon as they
leave the girl becomes evil.I also had a few other dreams about this same girl.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">One day I came home from
school to find the posters on my wall shredded in fine lines lying on my bed.I
asked my mom about it and she said it must have been the cats and didnt even
look at them.Another time I came in from school and grabbed the peanut butter a
pack of crackers and a butterknife and went to the living room before opening
anything.When I was done I went to put the lid back on the peanut butter but
couldnt find it anyplace.I eventually found it later in the trash. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">One night my parents went
to town to get some groceries and left me home alone so I could watch a movie
that was on Tv.During the movie I started to get cold.I got so cold I looked
into the kitchen which was where it was coming from and the side door and the
screen door were both standing wide open with the wind blowing leaves into the
kitchen.This struck me as odd #1 because we never use that door #2 the
screendoor has to be unlatched before it will even open #3 and lastly because I
had went through the house when my parents left and made sure every entrance
into the house was locked.Finally this girl appeared to me.I had been sleeping
with a night light since moving in.Well one night I woke up in the dark because
the bulb had blown.I went to my moms room and asked her if we had any more
bulbs and she said no to turn my tv on.I go and do as she said and again I wake
up in the dark.I go and ask my mom why she shut my tv off and she said she
didnt.My tv was an old black and white with knobs not buttons so whatever it
was had to touch my tv to turn it off.Again I turn the tv on and go back to
sleep.Again I wake up but this time there is a small light coming from about
the same area where my nightlight should have been.Beeing half asleep I had
forgotten everything and assumed it was my night light but the more I started
to wake up I noticed the light was getting bigger.Then I rememberd everything I
had been through and thats wen I saw the evil girl.I was so scared I pulled the
cover over my head.When I pulled the cover back down she was so close to the
bed the front of her touched the side of the bed.I looked at her face only to
see she didnt have one and she was dressed in an old fashioned nightgown with a
thin ribbon tied around the waist.She also had long wavy brown hair.She wasnt
real tall but she was not small enough to be a child. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When I got home from school
I told my parents what had happend and they didnt believe me but let me start
sleeping in the room across from theirs.I only had one thing happen to me in my
new room.I awoke one morning to find that I couldnt move it was as if someone
was sitting on top of me but the minute I prayed I was abloe to get up.One day
I had a friend over and we were sitting in the front yard when all of a sudden
she started to cry and said she wanted to go home.I asked her what was wrong
and she said she looked over at the house and up to the window to my old room
and saw red eyes watching her.We took her home and she never came to that house
again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My cusion also lived in
this house with us for a short while and he said that he would hear footsteps
in his room and in the hall and hear people talking when everyone was asleep. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">One time when I wasnt home
my aunt stayed the night with my mom because my dad was working thirdshift and
they made sure the house was all locked up before going to bed.They all got
waken up by a banging noise.It was the side door in the kitchen again.The door
was standing wide open and the screen door was blowing back and forth.Like I
said before this door latches it is a metal screen door.I have driven by that
house since but dont know if anyone has had a similar expierience there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Hello!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Was browsing through your
site (I currently live in CT, grew up in KS) and sure enough, Hottz House is
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've been there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I actually went up there
with about 6 other kids on my 18th birthday.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>2 girls, 4 boys.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the walk up
there, we saw moving lights inside the house and figured more kids were there
messing around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once we got to the
house, no one else was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There's a
huge pentagram on the floor upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Careful, the floorboards are rotted through.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a huge tunnel entrance next to the
baseent stairs, and one of the guys in our group went down into the tunnel that
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He didn't make it very far before
he came RUNNING out of the house and insisted we get the heck out of there
immediately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the (run) back to the
car, it was as if someone were following us, and more lights inside the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was 10 yrs ago.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Definitely a scary
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Bought the house that was
then 18<span style="">&nbsp; </span>months old from an older couple
with a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">daughter &amp; grandchild.
They later moved to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, when

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">returned to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">) It was
only the mother, daughter and grandchild.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Shortly after, strange
things happened at that house. You would hear the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">front door open and someone
walk through the living room and down the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">hall. I would see something
white go past the den. Lights would be shut<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">off in the kitchen, the
paper towel would unroll, always the noises of<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the doors opening and
closing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Once my husband &amp; I

sitting<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">having our lunch we heard
the car door open and slam shut. There were no<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">other people in the picnic
area. Jokingly my husband said that must have<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">been the ghost. Turned out
it was, because after we returned home, I no<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">longer sensed that he was
there - but one night a few months later, as I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">was washing dishes, I
sensed a presence, turned around and saw like a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">white fog. He was back. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Never was afraid of him, as
he seemed to be a friendly ghost.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We later moved and rented
the house, then moved to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Arizona</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> and
decided to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">sell the house. When we
went back to see what had to be done, I was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">amazed that the walls in
the livingroom and dining room had been splashed<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">with bluing (I had left a
bottle of bluing that I used on my wirehaired<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">terrior under the kitchen
sink.) Only the walls were splashed with<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">bluing, not a drop on the
carpets. A coincidence? I think not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Many more things happened,
but I think this is enough for now<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">This is a continuation of
my grandparent's house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Like I was saying earlier,
my grandmother shares a special bond with her cats. They are still around, too.
They even visit the house once and a while. I was walking through her house at
the time, and I saw a cat I had not ever seen before. It was a orange tabby
cat. I kneeled down and pat it on the head. Later, I asked my grandmother if
she had adopted a new cat from the shelter (again). She said no. I told her
about seeing an orange tabby cat in the house. She told me that it might have
been one of her old cats visiting. Now, by that time, I was scared out of my
wits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The next story, is about my
mother's grandmother, who I told you was the one who got hit by that car. This
true story was passed down to me from my mother when she first got married and
was visiting her parent's house (with her new husband before they had me). My
mother, father, Bert (one of my parent's and I's best friend), and my
grandparents were sitting in a room in which a clock that had belonged to my
mother's mother. They were all talking about my mother's mother and how she had
died. My grandmother, had said something about how she still visits the house.
My father, being as he is, didn't believe her. At that very second that my
father spoke those words, "Yeah right," the clock started chiming and
the hands started rotating out of control. After about twelve chimes, the clock
paused at the exact time and stopped working. I for one, KNOW that this is
true, due to the fact that I have seen this clock in action before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I was talking about my
uncle Tom earlier. There are many expiriences that I have had with him. Late at
night, when I was at my own house, somebody whispered in my ear. The
"thing", I believe, was my uncle. He only whispered my name. I ended
up bolting straight out of bed and grabbing the walking stickI kept in my room.
I looked around and checked that before I swung, there was at least someone
there I could knock out. It turns out that there was noone there. That sucked.
So, I ended up getting as scared as hell. Again, I will share another rather
"odd" happening with you. My grandparents were about their normal
daily activities at their home, when all of the sudden, the fire alarm started
to go off. They inspected the whole house, but there was, sure enough, nothing
to be found. It was my uncle, giving them a sign that he was still around. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">There are a lot more
expiriences that I have with these supernatural spirits, but then I would be
writing pages and pages of my writing if I included all of it, so that will be
all for now<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">my name is russ<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i had my first experience in 1991 when my
spouse was killed.it all started with bright lights in the night time and
seeing her with her arm extended out,well at first i thought i was going crazy
so i went to the hospitol and got some help as i thought i was losing it,i
later became a outpatient there and was seeking help during this time a
developed a sleep disorder until this very day,i became a workaholic ,trying to
make up for my time awake,anyways i moved onto a historic farm in markham
ontario.i hoped my past was left behind and my sleep disorder that i had
gotten,but to no avail it wasent .anyways this farm was a wonderful looking
spot and we started renovations emmediately on my very first night sleeping on
the farm i was very over tired from the lenghty move and rainy day that we
had,as lying in my bed and the house filled with boxes and furnishings all over
and not in place something started to touch my legs and it was definetely a
human hand,well,i was starting to become scared as i knew my new spouse and
duaghter was sleeping,,btw we all slept in this large round bed we had as the
home furnishings were more or less just tossed inside becuase of the serious
rainfall we had while moving in ,also i do not scare at all very easily but for
what ever reason this realy was the wierdest thing i experienced,atleast at thi
time,so i even had to go to the washroom and i didnt becuase something scared
me so naturaly i was not gona say anything to my new spouse and her duaghter
about what happin juring the night.but when she came downstairs into the
kitchen,it was a nice bright sunshinny day and says to me,you/ll never guess
what happin to me while i was sleeping.im like oh,,what was that,,,she said
someone was touching her legs while she was lying there and was so afraid to
sleep she said,i said omg,the very same happin to me but i wasent gona say
anything and didnt wanna wake yous,,,so about 1 hour later her duaghter elisa
comes down the stairs,comes in the kitchen,saying wow i didnt sleep a bit last
night you well never guess what happin ,,we both said let us guess something
was touching your legs,,she was like how did you know .anyways this was our
very first night not even basicly moved in and v extremely tired and very
excited at our new home so we just sorta let this incident go by for some
unknown reason.the property like i say was gorgeous and very large it is a 8
bedroom 5 kitchen famous even farm house,,it is a solid stone house with 8
bedrooms and 4 kitchens and a dumb waiter ,it has many out buildings and a
large barn,for the first 6 months aprox. my spouse and duaghter were
complaining of many things going on in the house ,at first i was so busy in
charge of the serious undertaking of the renovations on the property i didnt
pay much attention to this until i found my spouse at work and duaghter back in
school and the strang things started happining to me,and believe me very
strange things,,i honestly thought i was going crazy after awhile,well it got
to be so many things was happining we started keeping a diary on the further
eventsthat lead.then it got to the point what ever was going on in this
property was becoming ,i dont know,,maybe like stronger o the extent of
starting to see i guess what you call manifestations,so i figured i didnt wanna
move at first we jopked about this situation may have even thought it was
cool,,big mistake i learnt down the road about that tho,anyways,here we have
this serious situation,,where does one go,how does one deal with ppl that
supposely are deceased,oh ,i should say we have a small cemetary up on the hill
behind the barn we later learn and discovered also,so then we started a
investigation into the property and most ppl that had lived here and the
original homesteaders that came here in 1794. we hear there was a 12 year old
girl that may have been killed in a barn fire here with infant,,so oviously one
asks why is a 12 doing with a infant and now deceased,we also heard some
rumours later on something about a ranch hand that may have sexualy assualted the
young girl and was even hung here on our property but alot of decendants still
alive seem not to believe in our experiences or wanna talk about there
ancestors,i was also curious becuase there is a church across the hwy. from us
with a cemetary and why they may not had been buried there.anyways with out
going into more details about the 100s of events that transpired here we ha
professional ppl atleast this is what we thought at the time,one was a medium
,and when she first came inside the home she said things that had shocked us
,now first off plz understand she has been told absolutely nothing of our going
ons here except were having problems with ghosts.she said in less then 5
minutes you have 3 ghosts in this room rite now and she started coughing for some
reason and said theres a man and his aprox hieght and a girl and a women,later
on we went everywhere seeking help and talking to anyone and everyone not
caring what anyone would think of us,,we didnt care.the more we asked the more
we learned anout very similar stories in our area,we even had the church
involved and a priest,this priest says he travels<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and been all over the world dealing in these
matters and he said he new emmediately driving onto our property aprox 1/4 mile
driveway.anyways im going to stop here as i never have wrote to anyone b4 about
this situation and if theres anything that you can offer in knowledge of our
experience i would most definetely appreciate that,,and like i say,at this
point in my note to you i have only abbreviated our situation ,,plz believe me
it gos far beyond this and we experienced the wierdest events and things that
happined to many ppl while living on this property is just very lengthy and if
you wish to hear more please email me at russfenn58@hotmail.com and i would be
pleased to tell you more that transpired here and with the officail historian
for this area and museum have also documented some of the facts hereoh yes most
importantly the property ,well home is dated to over 206 yrs old here now!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Well, Let me begin by
saying that my mom lived in many haunted houses when she was young and the
ghosts seem to follow her. When I was younger, We lived in a house in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Goose
  Creek</span></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">South Carolina</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">.
Everything was fine until one night, While I was trying to fall asleep in my
room, I kept hearing banging. I could'nt tell what it was so I just ignored it.
Until it started to get louder and quicker. So I got up to go see what it was
when I noticed it was coming from the bathroom. As soon as I got to the door
the slamming stopped. I later described it as the toilet seat falling up and
down. We never really encountered anything other than that in that house. Until
the day we moved. We had everything out of the house but me and my mom had to
go back to lock it up and take out the trash. While we were there, I got into
some paint and my mom started to clean it off. When she was done we went into
the living room, getting ready to leave, when something had picked up one of my
moms dolls(a raggedy Anne doll, it was the only thing left there) and thrown it
clear across the room. Needless to say we said screw the trash and left. After
that house we moved into a house that was only two streets over. Nothing seemed
out of the ordinary until one night, while I was home alone, I kept hearing
children run up and down the hall. I never heard them laugh but I did hear them
banging on our computer keyboard. I didnt think anything of it until my brother
walked through the hallway and the light fixture fell to the floor just barely
missing his head. We thought it just came loose but soon figured out that the
screws holding the light fixture in were still there. How did it fall if the
screws were still in the ceiling? And last but not least,when my mom was a
teenager, She had finally gotten used to the sounds and the gh ts talking to
her. Until she told one of them to shut up. It got mad and all my could hear
was a scratching noise. She looked up and saw her doll that her grandma gave
her when she passed, slowly sliding off the desk. My mom ran to see if she
could catch it but it was too late, it crashed to the floor in a million
peices. She went to bed that night in her BED...but woke up hanging out of her
window. Now someone tell me how that happened if ghosts arent real and she
didnt sleep walk?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I worked at the Holiday Inn
Gatlinburg, as it was known then, in the mid 1980's as a desk clerk. Room 413
was still used as a guest room at that time. There were very few times that the
room could be occupied for the entire night. Most guests would check in, go to
the room and return to the front desk and request to be moved with in a few
minutes. This was usually because "the room had not been made up". We
had to put it on the newest housekeepers lists because the ones who had worked
there for a while would not clean it. If it were unoccupied, there were usually
complaints about the noise from that room. I can recall one guest's comments as
if it were today that the conversation took place. When he checked out he told
me,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I almost called the police
last night because the man next door was beating his wife. If I had had a gun,
I would have taken care of the problem myself." The room was unoccupied
the night before. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Part of my job was to fill
the cola machines in the Tower on Wednesday of each week in winter. We always
rented the Tower to groups on weekends during winter because most times the
groups consisted of teenagers and if we isolated them they wouldn't bother
other guests. One night, it was dark when I started filling the machines. None
of the rooms were occupied, all housekeeping and maintenance personnel were
gone for the day and the security guard had not come on duty yet. We kept the
entrance chained and padlocked. We were to unchain the doors and rechain and
lock them from the inside once we were in. This was the first time I had
started this late. Even though I had no knowledge of things to come, I usually
tried to finished prior to </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="17"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">5:00 pm</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">. The
first 4 floors were uneventful. I would complete one floor at a time then
return to the storeroom on the first floor to get more drinks. As the elevator
approached the 5th floor I could hear what sounded like one hugh party. I even
called the desk on my radio to make sure we hadn't overlooked rooms that may
have been occupied. When the doors opened, it was quiet as a tomb. Chills run
down my spine as I type this some 20 years after the fact. I heard no more
sounds on the 5th and continued with my task, hastily. The 6th floor was
uneventful. The 7th floor was the worst. As I left the elevator and started to
open the cola machine, I heard what sounded to me like a small dog whimpering.
The sound was coming form the end of the hallway. I worked in Gatlinburg for
many years at several different establishments and it wasn't uncommon for
people to leave many different items, including pets. As I approached the end
of the hallway, the sound seemed to be coming from the next to the last door on
the right. I could hear the sound until I got almost to the door. I am not sure
but I think the room number at that time was 768. The sound stopped and at this
point I knew that job didn't pay enough. The drink machines on both the 7th and
8th floors were left empty. It seemed as though I couldn't get out fast enough.
I never refilled the machines alone again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">There are other encounters
I experience in the 11 years I worked in the Burg. I have never seen a figure
but have heard things and felt things surrounding me. Gatlinburg is a beautiful
mountain town that is advertised as hosting over 10 million visitors each year.
I am sure this figure refers to living visitors only.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">First off, I want to
apologize in advance for the length of these stories. But, I have had a few
experience spread over my 24 years that I think would be worth writing down. I
will start with the house that I lived in for 9 month's when I was 16. This was
a old Victorian on a small and I mean small plot of land smack dab in a nice
little residential neighborhood. I who happen to love Victorians ( yellow the
most ) which this house was, was completely delighted. The very first night I
was there things changed. I was alone with just my younger sister who was about
14 at the time and are little brother almost 2 years old. It was late Nov or
early Dec and it was snowing out. My parents had gone back to the old house to
get more of are things and to pick up a pizza for dinner and My sister and I
sat on a mattress on the middle of the living room floor reading to our brother
with the radio on for some background noise. I noticed that my brother was
distracted and kept glancing at the stairs and I was hearing a pounding noise.
It wasn't all that loud and easily I could have ignored but I decided to reach
over and lower the radio and that is when we all heard it. It was footsteps. I
swear to god to this, that the sound they made were so stereotypical they could
have been used on any of those sound effects tapes people buy around Halloween.
It was a heavy work boot type of sound but hollow and it went down the stairs
which we had a good view of but on which nothing was there to the naked eye and
then back up to the hall upstairs were it completed this little trek again and
again. Well needless to say we were flipped out. My sister and I were about to
go outside and sit on the porch and wait for my parents but we had a little kid
with us and it was cold and snowing, So, even though we were completely
terrified we turned up the radio as loud as we could and just sat there. I
think my brother knew something was up cus he was unusually quiet and just
played by are feet with toy cars. Well, when are parents got home we all but
ambushed them and begged them to take us back to the old house. They who have
had there own experiences probably believed us but not wanting to frighten us
chalked it up to our imaginations. Other things happened in that house like the
upstairs attic light would be on all the time even though no-one really went up
there and there was the one time I firmly believed that what ever was in that
house touched me. I was in my bedroom and had just gotten out of the shower and
had on only a short robe and was bending over to pick up some clothes and felt
a tug on the back of my robe. Well, I spun around like a flash and tried to
rationalize it in my head, Maybe I caught in on something but I was in the
middle of the room and there was nothing around me. All my furniture was pushed
up against the walls. That really flipped me out. To this very day I have tried
and tried to relive that feeling and can't, it was so odd it's truly hard to
explain. But, anyway there were other things like things would disappear and
reappear and my sister hate her bedroom and would often sleep in mine on the
floor. My parents had there own experiences but it wasn't until we were moving
out that the footsteps returned. My mom was downstairs in the basement alone
doing laundry when she heard someone walking around upstairs and she went
upstairs thinking it was the realtor to find the swinging doors that separated
the hall from the kitchen swinging back and forth but there was no-one there.
My dad had a similar experience as well. The other experience has to do with
another place we lived in a apartment in a 3 family house. We were on the
second floor. This was when I was 18 or so. The first few years were relatively
quiet but it whatever it was got really started when I went away to college.
The beds and the couches would shake and vibrate for no reason that my family
could see and when I came back home I to had this happen to me and it was a
really odd sensation like someone had grabbed the sides of the bed and was
shaking it. It was not a nice feeling but lasted anywhere from 30 seconds to a
minute and a half. I was not around when other things happened like my brothers
toys would come on in the middle of the night even though they were off. It got
to the point that my dad would get up, grab the toy and fling it on the porch.
My sister also had a terrible nightmares and I had the creepy feeling of being
watched while I did dishes at the kitchen sink. I could literally feel someone
staring at me from the hallway. When I would get up the nerve to look no one was
ever there. I have a few other stories but this is the most recent. My sister,
partner and I were at a local cemetery that has a reputation for being haunted
and I wanted to get a couple of pictures. I had gone previously and have had no
luck but have been there when others have gotten orbs and the like. Well first
off, this cemetery always has toys on he graves. There were dolls and a plastic
horses. That is easily explained as there are many graves for small children
and people can either be playing jokes or be sympathetic to all the young
children who died so young and are leaving them presents. But,, last night in
addition to the usual toys there were other strange things including a dead
rabbit lying by a headstone and a few feet away the torso of a dress mannequin
just lying there. I don't jump to conclusions and that can all be explained
easily enough but they still had to the atmosphere and when you are strolling
about a notorious haunted cemetery at night on a back country road and spy dead
animals and what looks like a dead body, well you get freaked out. end of
story. But, I have done this before and from the above and other things that
have happened I got over it and my sister was snapping off pictures left and
right and then she and my partner are looking at one and my sister goes "
there is nothing there " and Rhonda goes " wait just turn it
around." well my sister flips and goes " I'm so out." and bolts
and I mean bolts across the cemetery , across the street and into the car with
Rhonda in hot pursuit. I mind you have been left in the dust so to speak since
I was not beside them when they looked at the photo that spooked them so bad. I
trudge after them and in the car ( mind you I am a little ticked off cus I was
having a ok time there) and when I saw the photo my heart stopped. It is of a
headstone but off to the side of it is man's face it is so clear in fact that
you can make out a white collar and a black shirt and what seems to be a short
black mustache, It is not a nice face and on closer inspection there is another
image in the headstone of a crying baby with hands over its mouth. Now, I am
not sure of the image on the headstone because I am quite aware that anything
can cause a image to appear ( the grain of the stone, moss on it etc) but the
face that is another matter entirely. I do not know how in the world to explain
that... it's unbelievable. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
