Mom Checking on Her Baby<br>
By: gary_r_mason@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Well, I was 17 at the time and living in South Jersey. I spend much of
my time in the evenings and weekends babysitting. At this time, I had
been babysitting a couple's 3 kids, and the youngest was still in a
crib.<br>
The Mom of the 3 suddently passed away of a cerebral hemmorhage,
leaving the Dad with much to do to say the least. The week after the
funeral, he called and asked me to watch the kids for him one 1970
Friday evening. <br>
I got the kids settled and proceeded downstairs, turned on the TV, and
was sitting on the sofa watching it when I heard a noise upstairs. So I
slipped up the stairs and peeked in the baby's room. There, I couldn't
believe what I saw. The Mom was standing next to the crib, looking in
on her baby girl. As clear as day, if I hadn't seen it with my own
eyes, I would not believe this story myself! She turned to me, with a
blank look on her face not frowning or smiling, turned around toward
the closet and walked right through the door!<br>
To say the least, my Mom had to spend the rest of the evening with me,
and she had to be the one to go up and open that closet door, I sure
wasn't going to!<br>
I continued to babysit those kids throughout the summer, but never had
another "visit" from their Mom, although I was finally able to share it
with her husband.<br>
Since I had that experience myself, I am a firm believer of those types
of "visits" that's for sure!<br>

Small Town Bar<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kdanielson29@gmail.com<br>
<br>
I work at a bar in a small town in Northwestern Pennsylvania going on 4
years now. There have <br>
been two owners in the time that I've worked there. There were some
strange things that <br>
happened while the old owner had the business, but nothing too out of
the ordinary that couldn't <br>
possibly be explained away. There was only one time that I was alone in
the bar and closing up at <br>
the end of the night. I was walking around putting chairs up and kept
seeing a shadow out of the <br>
corner of my eye, dismissing it because I have a tendency to flip
myself out sometimes. As I was <br>
putting the chairs&nbsp; up, I had this very strong feeling of someone
close to me, following me as I <br>
walked table to table. I was back in the kitchen area where the walk in
cooler is located and I got <br>
the strongest sense of someone standing in the door of the cooler. This
made me panic a little <br>
because I had no way out if that exit was blocked. The feeling didn't
go away until I was away <br>
from the building completely that night. Even in the parking lot I
could sense someone watching <br>
out of one of the windows. <br>
After the new owner took over in early January of 2011, strange things
really started occurring <br>
more often. It was happening to all the employees, which I found later
when I started telling <br>
coworkers about my experiences. There is a closet that held all the
excess cans of soda and other <br>
supplies. While in the closet, often cans of soda would fall off the
shelves hitting us. (I actually <br>
was left with bruises because they would fall from the top.) <br>
The scariest happening was in mid-afternoon while I was working in the
kitchen. I was boiling <br>
hot sauce, which took hours. I was stalking the freezers, cleaning,
etc. while the hot sauce <br>
cooked. The hot sauce is made on a hot plate that sat on the counter. I
had it pushed against the <br>
wall as I was using the counter space for other things. I was finishing
an order when the pot of <br>
hot sauce flew off the hot plate and across the counter nearly falling
off the edge of the counter <br>
before I stopped it. Hot sauce spilled everywhere, and the pot sat
hanging past the edge of the <br>
counter. I still cannot explain how this possibly happened, and nothing
of the same intensity has <br>
happened to anyone else that works there. <br>
I still get "feelings" when I work there, but thank goodness it is only
on a fill in basis now. <br>
Since things started happening in the bar, I have done some digging and
found out the bar used <br>
to be a home. The home caught on fire and some or all of the occupants
died in the fire. I have <br>
been unable to get any more information on that besides word of mouth. <br>

My Great Grandmother<br>
By:&nbsp; priscila.gouvea@ehl.ch&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
This happened ten years ago and I still get chills down my spine when I
think about it. I was ten years <br>
old and I was used to sleeping in my mom&#8217;s bed whenever my dad was away
on business. On one <br>
night, which was just like any other, my mother and I were sleeping
when I suddenly woke up. There <br>
was no thunderstorm, no noise, no nightmare, nothing. I just woke
up.&nbsp; <br>
When I looked over to my mom I saw a clear figure of a tall woman
dressed in white with dark hair tied <br>
in a bun. She was looking directly at my mother. She held her gaze at
her for a few seconds until she <br>
looked at me. My heart completely stopped. Suddenly, my mother just sat
up and as soon as she did, <br>
the ghost immediately disappeared. She asked me what was wrong, I said
nothing and lied back down. <br>
I was able to sleep but I would wake up every few hours but I never
opened my eyes until it was light <br>
outside. <br>
When I went down to breakfast I told my mom what I saw the night
before. She then goes on to tell <br>
me that my great grandmother, who I only met when I was a few months
old until she passed away, <br>
was a tall woman who always wore her dark hair in bun. Also, my mom was
her favorite grandchild.<br>

My Haunted Apartment<br>
By: Billegatz@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
I'll try to keep this as brief as possible but it's going to be a long
story. <br>
I lived in a basement apartment in Fair Lawn, NJ for over 8 years. The
first two plus years nothing <br>
happened. Then one night I was watching a movie about Harry Houdini.
Not the famous one with Tony <br>
Curtis but the lessor known one with Paul Michael Glazer. There was
more emphasis in this one about <br>
Houdini's passion to expose seance conductor's as frauds. At the
pinnacle of the movie (it's now almost <br>
midnight) my clothes dryer went on by itself. <br>
&nbsp;I would wake up in the middle of the night after falling asleep
on the couch with the tv on, to a cold <br>
breeze going through the apartment and finding the door that led from
my apartment to the garage was <br>
wide open. At first I figured the landlord didn't close the door tight
enough. Then it happened when the <br>
landlord was away. This only happened when I fell asleep on the cough
with the tv on. <br>
The volume on my stereo would get louder on it's own. I didn't have a
volume dial but rather a slide that <br>
went up and down. If the volume went down I could just chalk it up to
it's an old stereo and was reacting <br>
to gravity but going up?&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
A now former friend came over to visit one night and we were in the
living room watching tv when we <br>
heard a loud crash in the room behind us. I was expecting&nbsp; this
entire shelving unit that was in that room <br>
had fallen over but when we went in nothing was out of place. <br>
Another time while my landlord was in Vancouver on vacation, another
friend&nbsp; came over on a Saturday <br>
afternoon. After spending a few minutes in my apartment we left to go
play tennis. He drove. When we <br>
came back I discovered I had locked my keys in the apartment. My friend
joked "Maybe the ghost will <br>
unlock the door" (that leads from the garage to my apartment). I opened
the outside garage door, which <br>
was always unlocked. My friend then let out an expletive as we both saw
the inside door was wide open. <br>
He then said he specifically remembered my checking both that door and
the entrance door to my <br>
apartment to make sure they were locked before we left to play tennis.
At this time I should notify you <br>
that I am a lockaholic. <br>
The most telling part of this involved my yellow lab. He was my dog but
he lived with my parents. There <br>
wasn't anywhere he would happily go. Oh were going to the vets and
she's going to give me shots? <br>
Great lets's go. Well we finally found one place he wasn't going. My
apartment. No matter how much we tried, no matter how much we tricked
him when he got within five feet of the entrance to my <br>
apartment the hair went up on his back. We never got him any closer
than that.<br>
&nbsp;I never experienced anything bad and would have stayed there
longer but the landlord sold the house <br>
and I had to move.<br>

Recent Haunting Experiences<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lee.gaedtke@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
Hi, my name is Lee and I'd like to share my recent haunting experiences
with <br>
you all.<br>
I'm Australian, recently moved to Ireland and during my first week here
I was <br>
staying at the Dublin International Hostel. I was staying in a dorm
room with <br>
9 other women, however one night I woke up in the middle of the night,
sitting <br>
bolt upright, I didn't have any trace of sleepiness at all and after
looking <br>
around for a few seconds I heard someone whisper 'Ella' in my ear,
clear as <br>
day. I thought it might have been one of the other women, but looking
around I <br>
saw that everyone else was asleep.<br>
The next day I asked at the front desk about the history of the hostel,
and <br>
apparently it used to be an orphanage (go figure right?) and a school
for the <br>
local area and the good folks at the front desk told me that there has
been a <br>
fair share of people reporting spooky things.<br>
Next, I arrived at my new house, new job working as a nanny. I got to
know the <br>
children and got to know the story of the family. The father's parents
had <br>
passed away before the children were born. One day I came into the room
to <br>
find the oldest daughter (who is four) talking away to herself. I asked
her <br>
what she was doing. She said that she was 'talking to Granny Treasa at
the <br>
window'. I asked her if she was there right now and she said that she
was gone <br>
now but 'Granny Treasa knows all about you. You're staying in her
room.' I got <br>
the heebie jeebies like you would not believe. The parents told me that
she <br>
often says she's talking to her Granny Treasa.<br>
Another time, it was just myself and the baby (she's two) in the house
and we <br>
were just playing away when she stood up, went to the staircase and
said <br>
'Hellllooo? Hello! Hello!' with a big smile on her face. I asked her
who she <br>
was talking to and she just pointed to the top of the staircase and
starting <br>
chattering away in baby to the person at the top of the stairs.<br>
At other times I've heard footsteps on the upper floor when it is just
me in <br>
the house on the bottom floor and sometimes in the room I sleep in, it
gets <br>
unbearably cold. <br>
I wonder, who was Ella? Has anyone else stayed at the Dublin
International <br>
Hostel and had any ghostly visitors?<br>
I wonder if the girls are actually talking to their Granny or if
they're just <br>
pretending to feel close to her?<br>
<br>
<br>
My Haunting Story<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; moonwolf615@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
my names alisha and my story involves a few different parts. The first
part is all things that were <br>
reported to me from my childhood. To start from the begininning, it was
well known that my <br>
grandmother had a "ghost" friend that she would talk to and that
everyone knew about named <br>
Red. aparently once i was born, being the first of her grand children
and the child to her eldest <br>
son, Red aparently took a liking to me. My mother was not too happy
with this. the first <br>
experience happened in our home in the dead of winter, I was still a
small baby, and my mother <br>
had me swaddled in blankets in the middle of her bed while she was
doing house work. We were <br>
alone, my father was at work. She went to check on me and to her terror
i was gone. She <br>
proceeded to tear apart the room and even up ended the bed looking for
me. she looked over the <br>
whole house and even ran out into the snow to see if someone had taken
me. not only was no one <br>
there, but there wern't any foot prints in the snow besides hers.
Eventually she called my father <br>
who rushed home. they ran all around looking for me and eventually
returned to the bedroom, to <br>
find me happily laying on the upturned matress. They still don't know
where i went. My personal <br>
belief is that there are many different kinds of spirits out there. In
highschool i had a fascination <br>
with fairies. I still believe ghost, fairies and all those sorts of
creatures are all just spirits. And i <br>
joke that im a changeling. this is not the end of my encounters as a
baby. my parents eventually <br>
lived with my grandfather and had a makeshift apartment set up in the
basement while my room <br>
was upstairs. One night when my mother was again alone in the house,
she put me in my crib and <br>
went to bed. Eventually she heard a sound that sounded like someone
walking up the basement <br>
stairs. Alarmed that someone had broken into the house she rushed to my
room to get me and <br>
found me happily jumping up and down in my crib laughing as every toy
in my room was going <br>
off on its own, She promptly called my grandmother and told her to come
get her "ghost". The <br>
next occurance didn't involve me, but explains alot about why "Red" had
such a bond with me. <br>
We were all at a family reunion and my parents were sleeping on a
matress in an upstairs room of <br>
a family members house that had a large window seat. My mother woke up
and looked over to <br>
see my father, who is very distinctive with red hair, sitting in the
window. She called out to him <br>
and told him to come back to bed and he payed no attention to her,
annoyed she rolled over only <br>
to find that my father was right next to her deep asleep, when she
turned back the man in the <br>
window was gone. The next morning she asked my grandmother about "red".
She told her that it <br>
was the funniest thing that he looked just like my dad, and that she
called him "red" because she <br>
had the same red hair as my father. I suppose this would be like a
doppleganger, but the figure of <br>
"red" never seemed to be a menacing one to me, he was always doing
things to make me happy <br>
and was a companion to my grandmother. I still wonder what times when i
was young if i <br>
thought i was dealing with my father when i was really interacting
withe "red". This is not the <br>
end of my experiences with spirits. I never really noticed things in my
own home, besides the <br>
fact that i have trouble sleeping and a very vivid "imagination", but i
did have many experiences <br>
out of my home. My best friend when i was young, lived in a house that
i instantly disliked, it <br>
had the creepy being watched feeling. the first night i stayed over
when we were about 12 she <br>
told me about how she was sure her house was haunted. The haunting was
centered around the <br>
bathroom which the door was located in her room. She told me she would
hear breathing, which <br>
she used to think was her sister, but her sister had just gone off to
school and she was alone in <br>
the room now. when i stayed there i would sleep on the floor, and since
her room was small that <br>
meant that i was laying right in front of the bathroom door. I stayed
only acouple of times over <br>
night, but the creepy feeling usually kept me away. Eventually one day
we were hanging out in <br>
the bathroom, myself in front of the mirror and her sitting on the
toilet, when the heavy old door <br>
to her bathroom, which was wide open slammed shut and locked. We stared
at the door for a <br>
few seconds in terror before she finally unlocked and pulled it open
and jumped on the couch to <br>
stare at the door. if that wasn't scary enough, her dog walked by the
door and stopped like she <br>
sensed something then proceded to brissle and foam at the mouth while
staring at the door. I'm <br>
not sure if i really believed all the stuff my mom told me about untill
that point in my life, but i <br>
did after that. We spent the rest of the day trying to figure out how
the door could do that. no <br>
wind, not even alittle and the door was old and hard to shut. She later
told me about other <br>
happenings in the house that occured once every few years. She had
blankets that were close to <br>
her face yanked down to her feet and one night she heard the breathing
only to turn and see a <br>
face. They eventually moved out of the house and it was condemned and
torn down. That house <br>
was Scary! since then only little things have happened to me. When i
was 18 i moved into my <br>
first apartment all on my own. for the first week while i was moving i
slept on my matress in the <br>
livingroom where the tv was. Every night id make sure the windows were
closed and locked <br>
even though we were on the second story and every morning they were
opened at least half way. <br>
when stuff like that happened id usually just ignore it. eventually my
friend moved in. She is like <br>
me and has had experiences with spirits and immediatly noticed things
as well. our usual greeting <br>
was to scratch on the other persons door instead of knocking.
Eventually she would come to me <br>
and ask me if i was scratching on the door, when i hadn't been
scratching on the door. We both <br>
just decided to ignore it. one night we were both in our own rooms when
it seemed like <br>
something shook my door and started scratching at it, i told her to
come in, but she didn't <br>
respond, then i could hear noises like the fridge&nbsp; and cabinets
opening in the kitchen. My dogs <br>
noticed too, but like me didn't pay too much attention assuming it was
just her in the kitchen. <br>
Eventually a little creeped out i texted her, and then called her when
she didn't respond. She had <br>
been asleep the whole time. The kitchen had always been creepy, and the
randome noises <br>
continued untill my boyfriend moved in. After that there was no more
scratching and all the <br>
noises stopped, He thought we were a bit crazy. I have only actually
ever seen a spirit a few <br>
times, and never in my own home, i usually see them in the places i
assume they are connected to. <br>
Usually they are just flashes, and then they are gone and i ignore
them. occasionally i will see <br>
them in fields as we drive past. The most shocking i've ever seen we
have nicknamed the hoodie <br>
ghost. there is an old cemetary close by where i used to live that we
drove by daily and every <br>
time we went by at night, we would see a guy in a dark hoodie sitting
or leaning on the old steps <br>
leading to cemetary gate. we could stare right at him and not notice
any facial features and if we <br>
glanced away he would be gone. It happened one time when we were
walking by the steps, we <br>
gave him a passing nod before we registered there wasn't anyone
actually there. The other time i <br>
saw a spirit, was so weird that i question if it was actually real. i
was in the car with my friend <br>
and her boyfriend. looking out the window of the car i noticed what
looked like big bat wings <br>
dipping into view. I stared at it for some time thinking it was a play
of light or the telephone <br>
wires but i would see it when the wires wern't there. I told my friends
and when they looked it <br>
would dip out of sight. I dont know what it was, but it was big and i
was the only one who <br>
could see it. I know that these things make themselves known to me
because I am open to seeing <br>
them, but i don't think im a medium. I&nbsp; can't go to a place and
talk to spirits or see them. but <br>
every once and a while i will catch a glimpse of something, like a
shadow, or see a person out of <br>
the corner of my eye who is not there when i turn to look. I think that
it all has something to do <br>
with that time that i was gone when i was a baby and the area that i
live in.<br>

Kemper-Marsh-Millard Funeral Home<br>
By:wbmillard@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
Hello, i used to live there at the age of 10 while my uncle owned the
place. I moved there in <br>
2004. Nothing much really happened at first, was a normal place. They
began renovating the <br>
basement maybe 4 months in after i had moved in. I would begin having
odd dreams of <br>
a shadowed misshapened figure where the elevator was. wierd things
would happen maybe once <br>
a week to me. I seemed to be the only one to experience things. The
chapel doors closed on there <br>
own once which are heavy and big so no draft of air would easily push
them closed. I once saw a <br>
light figure early in the morning while still dark out walking around
the chapel. It would sit at the <br>
old organ and move into the pews and sit in one of the rows. (third i
believe) they have reversed <br>
the room since then. We would always seem to lose something and come up
with it days or even <br>
weeks later in a different spot.<br>

As Long As It Stays Quiet, I&#8217;ll be Happy!<br>
By: sovichp@yahoo.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
My name is Patrick, and I submitted a story to the site about 5 or 6
years ago of some things that <br>
happened to me back when I was in college, but I wanted to submit a
more recent story of mine <br>
as well. <br>
About three years ago I purchased the house I live in now, which is a
1940's cape cod in a suburb <br>
of Pittsburgh.&nbsp; The land upon which my neighborhood sits is the
site of a post-Revolutionary War <br>
Military Installation known as Legionville, which is where General
"Mad" Anthony Wayne <br>
trained the first peacetime U.S. Army.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
The first night I slept in my house, I woke up about 3 or 4 am with the
light next to my bed <br>
turned on.&nbsp; Now I am a light sleeper and need total dark to fall
asleep.&nbsp; I figured I must have <br>
turned the light on in my sleep, so I turned it off and went back to
sleep.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;The next night, I woke up again at 3 or 4 am and the same light
was turned on.&nbsp; I was a little <br>
weirded out with this occurence, but shut the light off and went back
to sleep.&nbsp; The next night, I <br>
made sure I was going to sleep with the light off, moved the light all
the way to the other side of <br>
the night stand, and slept all the way on the opposite side of my queen
sized bed.&nbsp; Sure enough, <br>
at 3 or 4 am I woke up and the light was on.&nbsp; <br>
At this point, I determined the light itself must be faulty, so I
switched to a new lamp with a new <br>
outlet.&nbsp; Again, I was awaken with the light turned on.&nbsp; I was
so shook up at this point I yelled <br>
'STOP IT, I know you're messing with me, so just stop it!"&nbsp; What
weird's me out more than the <br>
experiences of waking up with the light on is the fact that it
completely STOPPED after I <br>
confronted it!&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Fast forward about three months.&nbsp; I have a career which allows me
to work from an office at <br>
home for much of the time.&nbsp; I was in the second bedroom which I
converted to my office doing <br>
some paper work around 3:00 PM.&nbsp; I heard a door downstairs open
and could sense that someone <br>
was in the house.&nbsp; I figured it was my parents, who have a habbit
of letting themselves in on <br>
unannounced visits.&nbsp; I called down "I'm up here" to them, but
received no response.&nbsp; I went to <br>
the top of the steps and yelled down "hello" and nobody answered.&nbsp;
At that point, I heard the <br>
door to my kitchen slam shut and loud heavy footsteps run down into my
basement.&nbsp; I ran <br>
outside of the house and called the police as I was certain there was
an intruder.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
From the sidewalk across the street I observed the house while waiting
for the cops to arrive.&nbsp; I <br>
have a front door, a garage door, and a side door, all of which are
visible from the street.&nbsp; <br>
Nobody exited the house during this time.&nbsp; Two police officers
showed up and seared my house, <br>
but found nobody.&nbsp; The strangest part of this occurence is that
the door I heard slam which is at <br>
the top of my basement steps in my kitchen was locked.&nbsp; That door
locks with a deadbolt.&nbsp; It is <br>
the type where you cannot lock it behind you and shut the door.&nbsp;
You have to either lock it from <br>
the kitchen side, or with a key on the basement steps side.&nbsp; I
clearly heard the door slam shut and <br>
THEN steps ran down into the basement, but the door was locked from the
kitchen side.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
At that point I decided to have a priest do a house blessing.&nbsp; For
the next few months, nothing to <br>
that degree would happen, however, I would be in bed late at night just
at the point where I am <br>
about to doze off, and would hear a male and female talking.&nbsp; Its
just like when you're a kid and <br>
were sent to bed when the adults are still up talking downstairs.&nbsp;
I could hear voices back and <br>
forth, but could not make out what they were saying.&nbsp; I'd get up
out of bed to listen closer, but <br>
the voices would stop.&nbsp; I made sure to check to see if I was
catching the neighbors talking or left <br>
a TV or radio on, but never found an explanation.&nbsp; After those few
months, all activity stopped <br>
all together.&nbsp; I never really did figure things out, but as long
as it stays quiet, I'm happy!<br>

High School Haunting<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heathersmscheer@gmail.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I go to Churchill High school in Livonia, Michigan. The auditorium is
said to be haunted by a <br>
man called "Carli". When im in a theatre show, which is frequently, I
always hear banging <br>
coming from the rafters and catwalk. I frequently here footsteps coming
from the stage area but <br>
when you look there is nothing there. One time, my friend and I were
sitting in the auditorium <br>
talking. It was dark and no one was around by the way. we were sitting
facing into the house <br>
and looking at the midget door at the back of the auditorium. There was
a sheet of paper taped to <br>
the door. Well, all of the sudden, the paper started to disappear, and
reappear. It kept this up for <br>
several minutes. My&nbsp; friend and I both know about Carli and have
heard him before so we <br>
figured he must be doing it. We kept watching the paper do this
vanishing act, when out of the <br>
blue and almost as if it happened in slow motion, we saw a distinct
head and leg walk past the <br>
door, as if he was pacing. We both got up and ran out of there in
complete shock. When we went <br>
back he was gone. My friend went up to the door and paced back and
forth as I watched. It <br>
looked exactly the same except I saw her and not plain darkness. We did
some research and <br>
found out that Carli got nervous and frightened easily making him pace,
A LOT. We havent seen <br>
him since, but the figure was definitively a man and completely there.<br>

"EAFB DAKOTA RIDGE HOUSING" <br>
By: michael900rr@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
&nbsp; I was stationed in 1995 at Ellsworth AFB, i lived in base
housing Dakota <br>
ridge "660 Mickelson ct", multiple objects moving, sounds in house,
both wife <br>
and i saw medicine witch doctar above our bed floating casting some
kind of <br>
spell on us both. Weird cold chills in house like pockets of cold air
you <br>
could walk thru but only in 1 room at a time. I had a wolf siberian
husky who <br>
would bark at walls and run to kitchen and watch trashcan slide across
the <br>
floor.<br>
&nbsp; Over the next 6 months, i would find myself praying for death
with a gun to <br>
my head, we were divorced, cat died unexplained death per the vet after
<br>
spending $2,000 to save her, 2 deaths in family, motor on the car blew
and the <br>
mechanic said hes never seen anything like it the crankshaft pulley <br>
mysteriously elongated the keyway hole and entire motor was replaced,
brother <br>
was in serious car crash, mom got divorced, brother ran away from home,
and <br>
since that night my life and my x wife's life has been pure hell. She
was <br>
summary court marshalled after 6 months, i was moved to idaho but
things didnt <br>
get better. <br>
&nbsp; I went to housing office and they would not disclose any info on
that house, <br>
i told them what was happening and they annotated the house folder i
also told <br>
them i think this house was built on indian burial ground, but my next
door <br>
neighbor moved out of the house and i can tell you i strongly belive
this <br>
house is on indian burial ground.<br>
