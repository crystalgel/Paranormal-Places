<P><B>By: sugarek@cbc.cc.tx.us</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>This is a little long, but bear with </B>
<P><B>me... This happened in 1976. My </B>
<P><B>now ex-husband and I had been living as cheaply as we could since we
had </B>
<P><B>married 3 years previously, and had finally saved up the money for
a house of </B>
<P><B>our own. Meanwhile, we were still living in a trailer house we had
put on </B>
<P><B>a lot next to his Grandmother's house. Another house had been there
</B>
<P><B>previously, and we were surrounded by older homes. No tragedies had
ever </B>
<P><B>occurred there that I knew of.  Saving our money </B>
<P><B>meant no air conditioner so the windows were open most of the year
in safe </B>
<P><B>little Skidmore in hot South Texas. So we were quite open to the immediated
</B>
<P><B>outdoors, both visually and auditorially.  After about 2 years of </B>
<P><B>living in this spot, the manifestations began with the sound of boots.
While </B>
<P><B>sitting in my living room, I would hear boots walking up the drive
to the </B>
<P><B>back door steps under the car port. We had a concrete drive leading
past </B>
<P><B>the side of the trailer into a carport attached to the trailer house.
</B>
<P><B> The boots were (I imagined) worn </B>
<P><B>by a man, walking in a hurry. As my husband was a big man, who habitually
</B>
<P><B>wore work boots to work, I was familiar with the sound. But these </B>
<P><B>steps were very individual and I came to recognize the different </B>
<P><B>gait. They would march up the drive regularly during the day, and then
I </B>
<P><B>would hear the "whoosh, whoosh, whoosh" sounds as the boots mounted
the 3 </B>
<P><B>steps at the back door. (This is important later) the back door to
the </B>
<P><B>trailer had the master bedroom immediately to the right. The door itself
</B>
<P><B>opened onto a hallway, which led to the left, ending at the </B>
<P><B>kitchen. From my living room windows, I could clearly see if a person
was walking up the drive. </B>
<P><B>I learned never to jump up to go to the back door unless I heard the
dog bark or a car </B>
<P><B>door slam first.  Other people also heard </B>
<P><B>this phenomenon. A good friend of mine heard this on several occasions,
as </B>
<P><B>did my husband's uncle.Each time (he or she was seated on the couch
with </B>
<P><B>his/her back to the window) asked why I didn't go to the door? So you
see </B>
<P><B>that this was a common experience.  I wasn't afraid at this </B>
<P><B>point as the boots were outside. I laughingly refered to my ghost.
I asked my </B>
<P><B>husband's grandmother if she knew of anything that could shed light
on this </B>
<P><B>phenomenon, but she did not, even though she had lived in the house
next </B>
<P><B>door for over 50 years.Then something odd </B>
<P><B>happened inside the house. I had a few bits of jewelry I was very fond
of. I </B>
<P><B>kept them all in a standing jewelry case (like a miniature armoire
on little </B>
<P><B>legs) in the bedroom. I might also mention that I am a meticulous </B>
<P><B>house keeper, and cleaned at least weekly, very thoroughly. The teen-aged
</B>
<P><B>girl next door sometimes asked to use the phone and I would let her.
Then two </B>
<P><B>of my rings went missing. I immediately suspected her and vowed never
to let </B>
<P><B>her in the house again. Then, after several weeks, I was cleaning,
and moved </B>
<P><B>the jewelry case, which I did at least weekly. There were the two rings
</B>
<P><B>under it! I have wondered if she did take them and put them back, but
now </B>
<P><B>I have to be open the possibility that my ghost was coming inside the
house </B>
<P><B>to play pranks.  Then I had this strange </B>
<P><B>experience. One night, in a state of sleep paralysis, I came awake.
My mind </B>
<P><B>was completely alert, but trapped in my body, which felt like a big
log. But </B>
<P><B>more remarkable than that was the fact that there was an entity like
</B>
<P><B>a ball of energy (sorry, words begin to fail me here) in my room. It
was </B>
<P><B>like George Bush's "thousand points of light". Little lights winking
on and </B>
<P><B>off all over. I experienced this entity as female, extremely good humored,
</B>
<P><B>and just plain good. I had no fear whatsoever. I was in a state of
great </B>
<P><B>wonder. I wanted to speak to the entity to ask "Who are you?" but could
not </B>
<P><B>command my body.  I have later come to </B>
<P><B>believe that this was a good spirit or my Guardian Angel who was there
to </B>
<P><B>protect me from the "bad" spirit which was getting stronger. Here come's
the </B>
<P><B>final chapter: Not long after this </B>
<P><B>I was asleep. My husband had to be at work in Corpus Christi by 6:30
in the </B>
<P><B>morning, which was an hour's drive away. I didn't have to get up until
7. So </B>
<P><B>I would make his lunch the night before and leave it in the fridge.
</B>
<P><B>This particular morning, I woke up to the sound of heavy boots slamming
</B>
<P><B>about the kitchen, going frantically back and forth, back and </B>
<P><B>forth. My first thought was </B>
<P><B>that he had forgot his lunch and hadhurried back for it. I was also
a little </B>
<P><B>p-o'ed because of thekitchen floor. Remember, I'm the good housekeeper.
I </B>
<P><B>kept thatlinoleum waxed to a fare-the-well, and I knew that it was
</B>
<P><B>beingscarred up by his boots and there would be little clods of </B>
<P><B>dirteverywhere.  Also, I felt </B>
<P><B>my cat leap on the bed. It sniffed my backand then curled up against
my </B>
<P><B>legs. (My back was to hall that led directly to kitchen so the cat
was </B>
<P><B>between me and the kitchenarea. But then I </B>
<P><B>looked at the clock. It was almost 6:30! Hewould never have come back
for </B>
<P><B>his lunch so late but would have bought some that day in town. Then
I heard </B>
<P><B>the boots hit the loose board at the edge of the linoleum where the
</B>
<P><B>carpeted hallway began that led to my bedroom! With that creak, my
</B>
<P><B>heart begin to hammer so hard I thought I was going to have a </B>
<P><B>heart attack. I didn't even think of the ghost. I thought this was
a real </B>
<P><B>person in my house, coming for me. I lay there frozen in fear, thinking
that </B>
<P><B>the best thing to do was for me to pretend to be asleep.  The boots
RAN down </B>
<P><B>the hall toward me. The trailer shookwith every step. It was as if
a big, </B>
<P><B>heavy man was running down that hall. I just knew that whoever it was
was </B>
<P><B>going to leap on top of me. Just as the boots got to my bedroom, though,
</B>
<P><B>they exited through the back door (down the same back steps on the
carport </B>
<P><B>they always came up to) and slammed the door so hard the entire trailer
</B>
<P><B>rocked, even though it was a big trailer and tied down. I sat bolt-upright
in </B>
<P><B>bed, hardly able to catch my breathfrom fear.  There was no cat in
</B>
<P><B>my room. In fact, it was outside, I later found out. And when I ran
to </B>
<P><B>the window I couldn't see anyone. This was a very small town, population
400. </B>
<P><B>Someone running around loose would have been noted, and I would have
been </B>
<P><B>asked about it, believe me.  Even though our new </B>
<P><B>house was 3 months to completion, andthe trailer had not yet been sold,
I </B>
<P><B>moved out within 3 days to live with my mother-in-law.  My explanation
for </B>
<P><B>some of this is as follows...(not to sayit is correct, but this is
only what </B>
<P><B>I think)... I believe that my Guardian Angel appeared to me (only
experience </B>
<P><B>I've ever had like that) to let me know that I was protected. The "bad"
</B>
<P><B>spirit was getting stronger, the boots making more frequent </B>
<P><B>appearances. To the best of my knowledge, "she" came after the incident
</B>
<P><B>with the rings. I think the morning of the "boots in the </B>
<P><B>kitchen" incident, that it was her again in the form of a cat, lying
in </B>
<P><B>a state of protection and comfort between me and the thing that </B>
<P><B>was intruding in my house.  Please let me state that </B>
<P><B>at this time in my life that I had never done drugs of any kind and
did not </B>
<P><B>dabble in the occult. I have run into 1 or 2 other ghosts in my lifetime
but </B>
<P><B>nothing ever to this extent. I don't know what would have happened
if I </B>
<P><B>had remained in the trailer, but as the bad spirit was creating </B>
<P><B>more numerous incidents and coming inside the trailer, I don't think
it </B>
<P><B>would have been good. Thanks for reading my very long </B>
<P><B>story. Hope it was worth it.</B>

<P><B>Little Girl on the Creek</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: sugarek@cbc.cc.tx.us</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>This ghostly sighting happened to my fiance. </B>
<P><B>He was living near the little town of Goliad, Texas </B>
<P><B>about 12years ago in the Springtime. His in-laws had a place </B>
<P><B>which bordered a creek. This place was somewhat isolated and had </B>
<P><B>heavy brush on it. He decided to go fishing in the creek and walked
down </B>
<P><B>toward it, fighting the heavy brush. Realizing that most of y'all don't
</B>
<P><B>understand the significance of this, let me explain that this means
that you </B>
<P><B>have to be paying very close attention to where your body is at all
times in </B>
<P><B>relation to all the thorns. Your attention must be close-up and personal
if </B>
<P><B>you don't expect to become an uncomfortable pin cushion. This should
also </B>
<P><B>give you the impression that there aren't going to be many other </B>
<P><B>people around. Anyway, as he is approaching the creek (about 30-40
</B>
<P><B>yards off), he suddenly looks up toward the creek. There he sees a
</B>
<P><B>little Hispanic girl about 6 years old. Her dark hair is cut </B>
<P><B>shoulder- length. She is wearing a white dress with a red sash tied
in </B>
<P><B>a big red bow in back. She has on red shoes to match. But he knows
she's a </B>
<P><B>ghost because he can see clear through her even though he can see every
</B>
<P><B>detail.  He is stunned and afraid, but feels no menace. He </B>
<P><B>stops dead (sorry!) in his tracks and just watches until she is lost
</B>
<P><B>from sight. Scared as he was by the ghost, he was more afraid </B>
<P><B>that people would think he was crazy for talking about it. It was about
</B>
<P><B>a year and half later before he asked his mother-in-law about </B>
<P><B>the apparition. His mother-in-law said that she had heard that a little
</B>
<P><B>girl had drowned a long time ago and that she was seen from time to
time </B>
<P><B>along the creek. She had no other information than that. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Poor Little Lost Soul</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Dee3319@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>  I had recently sent a story about my grandfather visting me about
a week </B>
<P><B>after his death.  Well.  that was one of the more comforting things
that has </B>
<P><B>happened to me.  The next story I am about to submit actaully happened
as a </B>
<P><B>dream,  but to this day,  I feel a very strong connection with it.</B>
<P><B>  It all happened about 6 years ago.  A 10 year old girl mysterouisly
</B>
<P><B>vanished from a sleep over at her friends house.  I had never meant
this </B>
<P><B>girl,  and although we only shared the same first name,  I had several
odd </B>
<P><B>dreams about her after her dissappearence.  </B>
<P><B>  One day,  about one week after the child turned up missing,  I woke
up </B>
<P><B>early one morning to go to work.  It wasn't like any day though.  I
woke up </B>
<P><B>feeling very sad and upset.  I didn't have any idea why I was feeling
like </B>
<P><B>this,  but  something just wasn't right.  So,  I continued to get ready
for </B>
<P><B>work.  When I got there,  I still had this bizarre feeling that something
</B>
<P><B>"big" was about to unfold. </B>
<P><B>  About half an hour into my long work day, I forgot about the "feeling"
and </B>
<P><B>went on with my day.  A woman I work with came into work about an hour
later </B>
<P><B>and asked me, "Did you hear they found the missing girl?"  All of the
sudden </B>
<P><B>this feeling came back,  and I said,  "Yes,  they found her in a dumpster
</B>
<P><B>wearing her blue night gown."  She replied,  "Then you did hear?" 
I then </B>
<P><B>started to cry uncontrolably and said,  "No,  she (the young girl)
came to me </B>
<P><B>in my dreams and showed me where she was,  and told me that I no longer
had </B>
<P><B>to play with her, because it was time to move on, and now she could
rest in </B>
<P><B>peace."  The woman just looked at me in disbelieve and really didn't
know </B>
<P><B>what to say.  And neither did I.  I then realized this poor young soul
felt </B>
<P><B>compelled to have someone be with her.  Why she chose me,  I will never
know. </B>
<P><B> Again,  we did share the same first name,  but other then that,  I
can not </B>
<P><B>explain what happened.  Most people I tell this story too,  have a
tendency </B>
<P><B>of just looking at me with an odd expression on their face,  but I
to this </B>
<P><B>day believe it was all more then just a dream.</B>
<P>

<P><B>Spirit that Follows</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Seafun49@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I have a "visitor" that has been with me for the last 6 years.  It
is male, </B>
<P><B>if I see anything I see a black shroud, like you invision death.  Mostly
it </B>
<P><B>is a feeling or a sense of his being present.  He has moved with me
several </B>
<P><B>times, from South Carolina to North Carolina to Alabama.  He travels
with me, </B>
<P><B>I have sensed him in my car on trips.  Sometimes he lets me know that
he is </B>
<P><B>near by letting me hear foot steps.  Mainly, he comes at night, and
I have </B>
<P><B>felt him lay down with me and put his arms around me.  At these times
I have </B>
<P><B>a cold feeling and cannot move or talk, I am afraid.  I had a friend
who </B>
<P><B>spent the night and as she slept she was covered up with the sheet
and became </B>
<P><B>very frightened.  We thought that the spirit had attached to a Bible
and I </B>
<P><B>threw it away, but he was still there.  My grown children have sensed
this </B>
<P><B>being.  I have used Bibles open to the 23rd Psalm, black salt, black
candles, </B>
<P><B>salt, and other things, but he is still present.  As I move he seems
to go </B>
<P><B>with me.  He does not appear every week, just every once in a while.</B>

<P><B>The Shackles</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: dcarwy@yahoo.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I"ve never seen ghosts or had any sort of experiences with the</B>
<P><B>supernatural but my friend, Amber, has. She was friends with this guy</B>
<P><B>named Seth, whose mother was my high school coach. She was telling
me</B>
<P><B>about this house Seth's parents bought in Monticello, Florida, about
45</B>
<P><B>minutes away from where we live. It was a real old house with lots
of</B>
<P><B>land aroound it. This house was a weekend house for Seth's family.
One</B>
<P><B>day, Amber was invited to spend the weekend with them. She told me
that</B>
<P><B>on the way up there they tried to warn her not to get scared because</B>
<P><B>there were ghosts there. She thought they were pulling her leg and
was</B>
<P><B>laughing and playing along. When they got there, Amber was impressed</B>
<P><B>with the two-story wooden house. It was built in some old style from</B>
<P><B>the 1800's, apparently. She walked upstairs to her room for the
weekend</B>
<P><B>and was given a tour of the house. Upon entering one room, she
smelled</B>
<P><B>something sour and bitter. It was right beneath the attic. She
couldn't</B>
<P><B>describe it to me but let me know it wasn't pleasant. Then, she was
led</B>
<P><B>to the attic, supposedly the most haunted room. There were old rusted</B>
<P><B>chains and shackles attached to the walls. A long time ago, a slave</B>
<P><B>owner owned this house. The slaves would be punished by whipping and</B>
<P><B>being shackled in the attic with no food and water for several days.</B>
<P><B>Amber said she had no eerie feeling and didn't see anything out of</B>
<P><B>ordinary. Later on that night, Seth and Amber were staying up late
and</B>
<P><B>playing games. They dared each other to go up to the attic, knowing
the</B>
<P><B>stories behind the deaths of slaves in the attics.  When they went
up</B>
<P><B>the stairs and turned on the lights, they smelled that sour and</B>
<P><B>metallic smell and saw dark stains on the floor that wasn't there</B>
<P><B>previously. Amber said she had never been so scared in her life. She</B>
<P><B>thought her heart was going to stop beating because it was beating
so</B>
<P><B>fast and hard. She and Seth went downstairs, wasting no time at all.</B>
<P><B>Amber couldn't sleep all night because she was certain she could hear</B>
<P><B>groans and cracking. The next day, Amber came straight home and
refused</B>
<P><B>to come back to the house again. I talked later on with Seth's
mother,</B>
<P><B>my high school coach, and she said it was true. She gave more stories</B>
<P><B>about she'd find things moved or missing, how she smelled cigar smoke</B>
<P><B>when no one smoked. She told me how she would come home at night and</B>
<P><B>all the lights would be on in the house. I asked how she could stand</B>
<P><B>living in the house. She told me she had not seen any ghosts or even</B>
<P><B>felt threatened. She actually thought of them as her friends because</B>
<P><B>they would turn on the lights for her at night when she came home.
I</B>
<P><B>wouldn't have been able to stand it! Weird, huh? It made me leery of
my</B>
<P><B>own house, even though my parents originally built it!</B>

<P>
<P><B>When my son was about 3 months old I bought him </B>
<P><B>one of those Dream Screens that you can connect to the side of a crib
for </B>
<P><B>the baby to watch. One night I put my son to bed, started his </B>
<P><B>screen for him and went to bed myself.I had a baby monitor and could
hear him even </B>
<P><B>when he was breathing.I fell asleep shortly after his screen had </B>
<P><B>played itself out.I was awaken around 2 or so by music coming </B>
<P><B>through the baby monitor and the sound of my baby making gurgly noises
babies </B>
<P><B>make when they are happy.I got out of bed and headed down the hall
to his </B>
<P><B>room. As I got closer I felt not cold but a very warm comfortable </B>
<P><B>feeling.My son was laying in his crib wriggling around and acting very
</B>
<P><B>happy with his screen still playing. I stood there for a few moments
</B>
<P><B>taking it all in. When thescreen stopped I disconnected it from the
crib and tried </B>
<P><B>shaking it and such tomake it start but nothing happened, so I assumed
my son didn't </B>
<P><B>kick it to startit by accident.I thought for awhile and remembered
the warm feeling I </B>
<P><B>had when first comingup on his room. It was the same feeling I use
to get </B>
<P><B>when I was a little girl andmy grandma would give me a hug.In my heart
I believe my grandma </B>
<P><B>came to visit me and see her great grandchild. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Ghostly Feelings</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: eolivare@concentric.net</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B> I have a few experiences. In 1976, I was living in an old bldg and
every night, I</B>
<P><B>would hear footsteps..heavy ones walking on the floor above me. I
then</B>
<P><B>asked the apt. manager who lived upstairs and learned that no one did</B>
<P><B>and there was a crawl space. He checked it and no one was there...so
on</B>
<P><B>a weekend when I knew no one was in the bldg except myself, I decided</B>
<P><B>that if I heard the footsteps again, I would not be scared. Then the</B>
<P><B>footsteps began, pacing all night. I kept my wits and made plans to</B>
<P><B>leave. I left the bldg. Second experience about 1985...I was at work</B>
<P><B>early one day (9th and Market) and was going into the bathroom, but
a</B>
<P><B>woman went in before me, not less than one foot in front of me, and
so</B>
<P><B>when I walked in to the bathroom...no one was there and I looked
under</B>
<P><B>all the stalls and still no one. Yet there was one way into the
bathroom</B>
<P><B>and the same way out.  The woman looked just like a solid body.  This</B>
<P><B>same thing happened again late one evening when I was going into the</B>
<P><B>bathroom and I rushed in just behind her to see her and when I got
in</B>
<P><B>two seconds later..no one, not even in any of the stalls.  Later I</B>
<P><B>learned that the cleaning staff in the bldg saw the same thing..they
saw</B>
<P><B>the woman enter the bathroom and they waited for the woman to leave
the</B>
<P><B>bathroom, but no one left and when they went in to find her...she was</B>
<P><B>not there. In 1977, a friend committed suicide. All that week-end
that</B>
<P><B>she died, I was depressed and could not shake the feeling.  Then on</B>
<P><B>Monday, I went to my univeristy library and as I sat there trying to</B>
<P><B>read late in the morning, I heard someone yell in my ear...except it</B>
<P><B>penetrated my body.. that "Holly committed suicide!"  I jumped and</B>
<P><B>looked around but people were quiet and no one was saying anything
and I</B>
<P><B>thought...where did I hear that and I must be thinking negative. I</B>
<P><B>became uncomfortable and left the library to shop.  When I returned
at</B>
<P><B>about 6pm to read, then a woman came up to me and said, "We were
looking</B>
<P><B>for you this morning...we were talking about you and wanted to tell
you</B>
<P><B>that Holly committed suicide."  I said so it is true what I heard.
I was</B>
<P><B>told to call Holly's husband and he verified it and said he searched
for</B>
<P><B>me the whole week-end. The next day a strange thing happened. In my</B>
<P><B>grief, I meandered my way to work in a different direction, passing
a</B>
<P><B>funeral home where I noticed a coffin in a hearse and my heart and
love</B>
<P><B>went out to it.  Then after I got to work, I checked the obituaries
for</B>
<P><B>the funeral home where Holly was. It was the same place I passed that</B>
<P><B>very morning and so I invited a friend to come with me to pay my last</B>
<P><B>respects to Holly at noon. I met my friend at the funeral home...and
we</B>
<P><B>were told that Holly had been sent out that morning for cremation.
She</B>
<P><B>had been the only one sent out and she was in the coffin that morning
in</B>
<P><B>the hearse that I passed on my way to work earlier. In 1982, when my</B>
<P><B>father died, I awoke early in the morning and was calm, then my
mother</B>
<P><B>called to tell me he died.  Everyone in my family woke up and my
mother</B>
<P><B>got out of bed, sat by the phone, then it rang and she got the word.
At</B>
<P><B>this time, I could hear people cry...only the sound came from their
body</B>
<P><B>and not their mouth.  My brother was in deep grief and not crying out</B>
<P><B>loud, but I could hear his spirit cry and he just had a sad look. In</B>
<P><B>1992, my mother was very ill and in a rehab center.  I did not like</B>
<P><B>staying in her house because I thought it was haunted.  On this</B>
<P><B>particular morning, it was 5 am and I was typing and printing a
letter</B>
<P><B>on the computer. I typed most of the letter, got up and stuck a mug
of</B>
<P><B>water in the microwave and set it for one minute, also I prepared a</B>
<P><B>plastic cone with filter and coffee in it, then I rushed back to the</B>
<P><B>computer to print the letter. I added a few lines to the letter and
then</B>
<P><B>began to hear the microwave beep and beep.  I ignored it, then the</B>
<P><B>beeping stopped. I got this creepy feeling. But I ignored it and then
I</B>
<P><B>thought the microwave had a timer and so the beeping stopped because
of</B>
<P><B>the timing, not because anyone opened the microwave door. I printed
the</B>
<P><B>letter, ran to the kitchen to get the mug of water out of the
microwave</B>
<P><B>and pour it in the cone.  I found instead that the mug had been taken</B>
<P><B>out of the microwave and the coffe was made, waiting for me on the
ledge</B>
<P><B>of the kitchen counter.  Yet I knew I did not get up from the
computer</B>
<P><B>to make it, because I made a conscious decision to ignore the
microwave</B>
<P><B>and finish my letter.  My mind worked over time to figure it out. 
I</B>
<P><B>grabbed the letter and left the house that morning and told whatever
did</B>
<P><B>it that I was taking the coffee but I didn't really appreciate it.</B>
<P><B>Other things happened, like the rustling of papers when I was trying
to</B>
<P><B>sleep...etc. and I had to leave the house.  Sometimes I have heard
other</B>
<P><B>people think and they were not directing their thoughts to me as what</B>
<P><B>happens with schizophrenics. Enough for now.</B>

<P><B>Dangling Phone Cord</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: mrbots@fcmail.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>I was at my mates house for his birthday and there was around 10 of
us in his lounge room. From</B>
<P><B>where I was sitting I could see the phone in his kitchen, it was mounted
on the wall. Anyway we</B>
<P><B>talking about all the wierd things that have happened to him and his
family in the house and I </B>
<P><B>said that I didn't believe them because I had stayed over heaps of
times over a six year period </B>
<P><B>and had seen or heard nothing. Well as we were talking about this,
the cord that connects the </B>
<P><B>the hand piece to the rest of the phone swung left, then all the way
to the right then stopped.</B>
<P><B>I was the only one that saw it and got cold shivers all over my body.
There was no way wind could</B>
<P><B>have blown it and there was nobody within 10 foot of it. it must have
been there ghost.</B>

<P><B>Haunted College</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Salemgodes@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This isn't my story or even the story of the perosn who told me, but
I </B>
<P><B>thought I 'd share it anyway.     This was told to me by the music
teacher at </B>
<P><B>my high school.  The college he attended (which I won't mention the
name) is </B>
<P><B>up north.  I'm not sure when is was built, but the main bulding of
the </B>
<P><B>college was a Catholic monastery .  There have always been stories
around the </B>
<P><B>college that a monk went crazy and killed himself in the monastery.
 People </B>
<P><B>at the college have reported strange happenings and sightings of what
</B>
<P><B>appeared to be a monk.  The story that I know comes from a janitor
who works </B>
<P><B>at the college.  On the weekends one of the custodians jobs is to break
down </B>
<P><B>the classrooms.  This means they have to stack up all desks and chairs
up </B>
<P><B>against one wall.  The janitor had just finished doing this and walked
out </B>
<P><B>the door and locked it from the outside.  There is only one door into
the </B>
<P><B>classroom and it is the one he has just locked.  The windows in the
room can </B>
<P><B>only be opened from the inside and the janitor was the only one in
the room.  </B>
<P><B>As he turned to walk away from the door he hears loud crashing and
banging </B>
<P><B>coming from inside the room.  He immediately unlocks the door and steps
</B>
<P><B>inside.  What he finds is that all the desks and desks and chairs have
been </B>
<P><B>thrown all around the room.  Drawers from the teachers desk were ripped
out </B>
<P><B>and papers strewn across the room.  There is no possible way any human
could </B>
<P><B>have been in that room and done that damage in a matter of seconds
then run </B>
<P><B>out without the janitor noticing.</B>

<P><B>Green Rocking Chair</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: HaroDork@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>	Our farm house in Cooperstown, NY had been built in the 1790's. Since
</B>
<P><B>then, a family known as the Lidells had lived there for several decades
(My </B>
<P><B>father has the historical information). One man, Wilbur Lidell had
been </B>
<P><B>painting the house when he fell off the ladder and was killed by the
fall. He </B>
<P><B>remained in the house until the people before use sold it to us. My
father </B>
<P><B>was an antique dealer and a historian, while my mother was a scientist.
When </B>
<P><B>strange things started to happen my father did research on the house.
He </B>
<P><B>found out about Wilbur, and told us. Some of the experiences, I, both
my mom </B>
<P><B>and dad, grandmother, and friends had were of footsteps, and our green
</B>
<P><B>rocking chair. The rocking chair would start and stop several times
daily. My </B>
<P><B>dad had a Lidell reunion one time and that was the last time we heard
the </B>
<P><B>ghost, and saw the rocking chair. Since then we have moved to Delaware
</B>
<P><B>(boring)  when my mom got a job here. </B>

<P><B>'Things'</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: jasonm@itpc.co.uk</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>After my grandfather's death in a local hospital 'things' started to
occur</B>
<P><B>in the house he shared with my grandmother.  I went to look after my</B>
<P><B>grandmother after grandad died, one night I was in bed sleeping when
I</B>
<P><B>heared a sound like a hand sliding up a hand rail intermitantly, as
if</B>
<P><B>someone was slowly comming up the stairs, I ignored the sound and put
it</B>
<P><B>down to my imagination or the wind I could have been dreaming.</B>
<P><B>Again whilst in bed in the early hours I was woken by a sound which
was like</B>
<P><B>someone rubbing their hands together, I was half asleep and opened
my eyes</B>
<P><B>to see a dark figure stooping over my bed with their hands clasped,
this</B>
<P><B>shocked me and I sat bolt up right in bed and the figure was gone,
again I</B>
<P><B>think I was dreaming.</B>
<P><B>Whilst in the bathroom I glanced across the landing and saw water
dripping</B>
<P><B>from the door frame onto the floor  and thinking we had a leak in the
roof,</B>
<P><B>went to check it out but the door frame and floor were dry.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The thing which happened which I find most difficult to explain away
is,</B>
<P><B>during the night again the weather was very bad, in the back yard at
the</B>
<P><B>time we had the old metal dust bins and they were being blown all over
the</B>
<P><B>back which caused a lot of noise and kept me up most of the night,
went down</B>
<P><B>stairs into the kitchen in the morning to find the two kitchen chairs
up</B>
<P><B>against the back door and the large setee chair from the front room,
which</B>
<P><B>was in a corner of the room with a side board in front of it, pushed
into</B>
<P><B>the middle of the room, I asked my grandma what had happened and she
said it</B>
<P><B>must have been the dog (?!) Grandma could not have moved that chair,
she was</B>
<P><B>quite frail,  as you would have had to have got up the side of the
chair and</B>
<P><B>pulled it out, even I would have struggled.  I don't like repeating
these</B>
<P><B>events as I am easily spooked and don't like to think of this as being
some</B>
<P><B>kind of haunting, I am hoping that you can give me a logical explanation
to</B>
<P><B>these events, as I am sure there must be one !!</B>

<P><B>The House up the Street</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: sunnystorm22@hotmail.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Hi! I just found your page out of pure curiosity when my friend's cousin
mentioned scary pictures</B>
<P><B>on the internet, and I'm kind of facinated by ghosts. So, anyways,
I'm 15 and from Nova Scotia,</B>
<P><B>Canada, and I'm sure these stories are for sure true. Our village is
over 350 years old and over </B>
<P><B>that time there's been constant battles between
french/english/indians/spanish/whatever, but </B>
<P><B>anyways, that's why I'm scared to go in the park where there's still
remains of forts. But this </B>
<P><B>isn't really the topic. My sister told me this story, and she heard
it when she was in the house </B>
<P><B>which was at one time her friends' house. They've moved out since and
I don't blame them after </B>
<P><B>what I'm about to tell you. I can't even look up at this newly- abandoned
house when I walk by.</B>
<P><B>The house is at least 150 years old and sits on top of a hill in front
of an old graveyard, the</B>
<P><B>western part of the graveyard behind the church. It used to be a nuns
convent way back when. </B>
<P><B>The woman that owned the house was washing dishes (this story came
directly from her to my sister</B>
<P><B>), and the sink is right below a window. She saw some old lady walking
by the window slowly, </B>
<P><B>towards the graveyard, and she said she kinda looked like a nun. The
woman ran outside to see who</B>
<P><B>was on her property, and she was gone. Another story is the woman's
husband and son were working</B>
<P><B>on the upstairs part of the house at opposite ends and were hammering
something each. The son </B>
<P><B>stopped for awhile to see if his dad was still working and he could
hear his dad ,clearly, still</B>
<P><B>working and hammering. So, 15 minutes later he went down to get something
to drink and was </B>
<P><B>shocked to find his dad coming in the door with groceries, when the
hammering suddenly stopped. </B>
<P><B>He said "I just got in from grocery shopping, I was gone for about
an hour." So, he was really </B>
<P><B>the only one working on the house...so who was the other thing working
on the house? These </B>
<P><B>stories come directly from down the street, and I beleive they're all
true, sometimes I even see</B>
<P><B>a light on when there's absolutly no one living there for  a couple
of years. Beleive them or</B>
<P><B>not, Thanks for listening,</B>

<P><B>Family Experiences</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: superstar_01_@hotmail.com </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B> I was just lookin at your site and thought I might send a couple stories
that have happened </B>
<P><B>to me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>    We lived in this house in Seminole Oklahoma were alot of weird</B>
<P><B>things happened.  Like when one time my dad was laying asleep on the</B>
<P><B>couch in the living room.  And then he woke up and saw our dog (big
dog)</B>
<P><B>in the middle of the living room floor staring at him with bright red</B>
<P><B>eyes.  He didnt think nothing of it until he realized that the dog
wasn't</B>
<P><B>supposed to be in the house.  He thought the back door was open or</B>
<P><B>something so he went back there to shut it but the door was closed
and</B>
<P><B>the dog was in the back yard.</B>
<P>
<P><B>    And then there was one time when I was having a nightmare that
there</B>
<P><B>were demons in our house yelling and screaming and breaking things.</B>
<P><B>Well my aunt lived with me and in the dream she burned this blue
thing</B>
<P><B>that she found then it went away.  I woke up the next morning and my</B>
<P><B>aunt was real tired.  I asked her how come she was so tired and she
said</B>
<P><B>"i couldnt sleep last night, it sounded like everyone in the house
was</B>
<P><B>up and being real loud."</B>
<P>
<P><B>    In the house I am living in now I woke up to something grabbing
my</B>
<P><B>leg and i looked over there and there was nothing there, then this
real</B>
<P><B>loud buzzing noise filled the room and I couldnt hear nothing 4 like
10</B>
<P><B>sec.  My aunt and my mom thinks the cause of it was this cd I brought</B>
<P><B>home because it had a couple like satanic pictures in it but I do not
think</B>
<P><B>so.</B>
