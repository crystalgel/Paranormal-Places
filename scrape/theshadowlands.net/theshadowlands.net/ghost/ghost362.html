<p class="MsoNormal">And Now "MY" Ghost Story</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: johnspurling2@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I thought I might as well tell my story, finally. I'm the
one who submitted the <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Old</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Hill</st1:PlaceType>
 <st1:PlaceType>Cemetery</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> (in <st1:place><st1:City>Newburyport</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>Massachusetts</st1:State></st1:place>) entry to the Haunted Places
Index. What I didn't mention there was that I have personal experience of the
phenomena described in the submission. I was only to learn years and years
later that my experience was alluded to in a local legend or mythology I was,
back then, utterly unaware of.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">"There are cases where visitors have been temporarily
'possessed' and taken on different personalities while at the cemetery."</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I spent ages 9 to 15 on <st1:Street><st1:address>Vernon
  Street</st1:address></st1:Street> in <st1:City><st1:place>Newburyport</st1:place></st1:City>
- the same street, incidentally, the historical "Olde Gaol" is on.
(Although the "Gaol" is supposed to be haunted as well, I had never
experienced anything remotely supernatural in connection with it the whole time
I lived on the street, and I often hung around its premises.)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One of my favorite haunts as a kid (pun unintended ...</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">sort of) was the <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Old</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>Hill</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceType>Cemetery</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>,
which was right across the street from the Olde Gaol. My friends and I spent
many an hour playing there - indulging in games such as hide n seek, looking at
the weird tombstones, engaging ourselves in silly superstitious childhood
rites, such as the old yarn about conjuring a spirit by walking backwards 13
times around a tombstone while repeating the dead individual's name ... you
know: the usual light-hearted childhood fare. :-) Sometimes I went there with
friends, sometimes with my sister - oftentimes alone.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I believe I was 13 when I first started feeling a peculiar
heightened "draw" to the cemetery. You know the cliche about being
drawn to something or someone like "a moth to a flame." Well, this
was definitely the case. It's a cliche all right, but an apt one.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now, everyone, to some degree, becomes paranoid on some
level while visiting a cemetery. A feeling of being observed, a subtle (or
perhaps not-so-subtle) feeling of self-consciousness just beneath the surface.
Especially if one is (physically) alone. One feels one is being watched by the
dead, regardless of how ridiculous it seems to one's sense of logic and reason.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Well, during this time the self-consciousness became so
pronounced it personified or condensed itself into the sense of a specific
entity I imagined abstractly as a boy of about 11 or 12 (close to my own age)
who rather resembled myself but had darker eyes. Eyes like pools of
dusk-darkened pond water, yet the skin of his face very pale almost to the
point of dead white. The eyes were so dark, the darkness seemed to bleed into
and around the sockets like cast shadow. I wouldn't call this an actual
conscious image I held - it was a FEELING. It's difficult to explain. This
entity was composed of or formed out of feeling rather than visual imagination.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">From then on, when I would visit the cemetery, I</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">sensed this boy's presence very strongly. My mind would
suddenly begin obsessing over this subtle-profound presence like it was
preoccupied by some kind of light fever-induced delirium. It wasn't
overwhelming, but it was certainly persistent. I wasn't frightened or disturbed
by all of this in the slightest - rather, my attitude was defined by casual
intrigued fascination and curiosity.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">All of this came to a head one mid-autumn day in 1981.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My sister (11) and I were in the cemetery, and I decided I
was to pretend I was a "ghost" who looked like her brother but
wasn't. My sense of this mysterious boy was very potent at that moment and I
decided to pretend I was him. My "act" was pretty convincing; I
communicated details to my sister regarding when I lived, when and how I died,
and in which spot of the cemetery my body was buried. I showed her a gravestone
and claimed it was mine. I think I got my sister to the point of at least
humoring my "act" with feigned belief.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">At some point, I began to seriously spook her out. I kept
talking and talking, and it must have seemed I'd lost my mind. I probably did.
I had a pretty defined sense of losing control by that point. But just as she
was turning to leave for home, I raised my arms and cried
"Winnnnnnnd!" - and at that exact moment a huge gust of wind battered
at us and it actually succeeded in blowing my hat clear off my head and sent it
rolling down the hill. I went after it, and just as I left the periphery of the
graveyard, the wind stopped and I instantly lost all inclination to continue
acting like a ghost.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Maybe there is something to the supernatural after all. I
would learn years later about the legend of people taking on
"personalities" or becoming obsessed by spiritual influences while
visiting that cemetery.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Back then, I hadn't known about possession or whatnot.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I read about the legend, my childhood experience at <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Old</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>Hill</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceType>Cemetery</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
was finally given an explanation, a point of reference. Everything seemed to
fall into place and it made sense.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">That was my one and only experience with "ghosts"
or the supernatural.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I go to Anderson College, now there is a lot stories about
the ghost of Anna, I think her last name is White, haunting the Sullivan
Building, well I have a couple of stories of my own about her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two semesters ago I was going to the Sullivan
Building for a bible study and me and a couple of my friends were waiting for
the rest of the group to show up in the lobby, when I heard movement upstairs,
now I raised in a one story house so I notice when there is a lot of movement
above me when I'm in a two story house, now I didn't think much about it until
my friend Quinn and his girlfriend Amber came in, Quinn came in for the bible
study that I was a part of and Amber was looking for where her bibile study was
being held, since I heard movement upstairs I thought that someone wsa up there
so I went with her up stairs and looked around and no one was up there and
since the only set of stairs in the building were in the lobby and I was
standting in front of them the whole time no one could have come down with out
me knowing it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And another one of
friends has an experience with the Sullivan building, she says that many times
when she has walked by there she has heard a female voice calling her.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Oh yeah, there has also been things going on in several
other places on campus, one that I heard about right after it happened since
I've made friends with one of the security guards he comes around every once in
a while and visits and one time while he was talking to us he was called to the
Merrit Administration building where a couple of students were standing outside
the building when the front double doors to the building swung open on there
own, and this was long after the building had all been locked up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">And there is a rumor about the Belk Theatre in the Rainy Fine
Art center being haunted, now I haven't experienced anything yet, but several
of my friends who work during several of the plays have told me that there have
been many times when there have been sounds of someone moving on the catwalk
when no one actually was when everyone was asked about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That's all for right now and I'll update if I
find something else out.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal">In regards to Ensign-Bickford in Simsbury Connecticut, I
used to be a senior security officer there for a few years and there are a
number of buildings known to be haunted, for example the plumbing shop, it is
said that a working hung himself in the stairway leading too the second floor.
ALL of the security officers refused to patrol that area at night because at
one time we all felt a cold feeling when in the stairway. The southern part of
the plant has had alot of fatalities in the history of this company. Lights
would misteriously go on and off. An example of this (I saw this first hand) we
would have mtion detectors going off in a building directly across from the
security building, when we looked out the 2nd floor lights would go on and off
randomly followed by the first floor lights and sometimes at the same time.
Upon searching of the building, nothing was found. Ensign-Bickford also owned a
large mansion at the time next to the <st1:City><st1:place>simsbury</st1:place></st1:City>
volunteer ambulance. Legend has it that a little girl died inside when back in
the late 1800's or early 1900's. Unsure of what she died of , but One security
officer who i believe is still there has a photo taken when they were trying to
sell the place. The photo was taken in the Great Room that contained the
fireplace. This photo was supposed to go into the advertisement, it never made
it because in the photograph there was a female in an early 1900's lace dress
leaning against the fireplace and she was semi-transparent. This shocked all of
us guards who patrolled that property. This in conjumction with motion
detectors beiing activated constantly, motion lights going off and the building
being empty really frightened most of us to the point of ending up doing just
exterior checks of the building for signs of forced entry. If you want some
good paranormal activities, this is certainly in my book 'ground zero'. I can
tell this certainly from experience and I am not really a believer in the
paranormal, but I can't justify the things that happen there. I have numerous
other 'happenings' that i can't explain.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The history of this plant is a deadly one with what I have been told
over a hundred people have been killed there since before the civil war due to
accidents. If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact me via
my personal email address at <a href="mailto:cjs0800@yahoo.com">cjs0800@yahoo.com</a>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Ghost Girl and Her Dog</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: unplugged14@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This strange event has been on my mind for quite some
time....</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It was a warm and pleasant evening last September, and I had
decided to take my little dog for a walk around the neighborhood, like I do
several times a week. We walked about one block down, and crossed the street.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As we walked in front of one of the many houses, I heard a
little girls voice say "Hello! Can I pet your dog?" I stopped and saw
a young girl, probably around</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">5 or 6 years old standing in front of the door of the 3rd
house from the corner. Beside her was a large, old looking, golden retriever.
(He had the white muzzle and droopy eyes of an aged, but much loved dog) I
paused and replied, "Uh, of course". I felt a little strange, because
even in though we live in a good part of town, kids are usually weary of
approaching strangers when their parents aren't around. I pulled my dog away from
the tree she was sniffing and we headed back towards the girl and her dog. I
glanced at the girl, who was chattering away about her own dog Buddy, and began
to feel that there was something a little odd going on. First was how the girl
looked.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The girl was beautiful, with long white blond hair, down to
the back of her knees. She was wearing a white blouse, and a long white skirt,
and she wasn't wearing any shoes! Feeling a bit miffed, I glanced into the
house behind her. THe house was COMPLETELY DARK. Not a single light was on
inside, even as it grew darker outside. I also noticed that there was no
vehicle in the driveway, and no garage where one would be parked.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">At this point I remember being concerned that this little
girl was a bit young to have been left all alone at night. Meanwhile, the
little girl was babbling on about her doggie Buddy, and how he likes to eat,
and was trying to get my litle dog's attention, while her the old dog sat on
the lawn, watching the whole scene. "What's her name?" She finally
asked me. "This is Phoebe" I answered. I was slightly confused,
because Phoebe kept pulling away from me, as if trying to get away. And my
little dog absolutely loves children. She's small, so she tends to like people
her size. Not to mention that she is always up to meeting other doggie friends.
But Phoebe did not want anything to do with this little girl, or her dog.
"Uh, she's a little shy" I said as I saw the little girl get a sad
look on her face when Phoebe wouldn't be friendly. So I asked her about her
dog, so she wouldn't be upset. And,as before, the girl started chattering at
about 100 miles and hour, as little girls will do. I tried to follow what she
was saying, and it was something about how Buddy got old, and then he went to
heaven when he went to sleep at the bottom of the stairs...or something along
those lines. I remember glancing over at the old dog, still sitting on the lawn
as if keeping an eye on his young blond companion. My own pup was really raring
to go, so I finally said, "okay, well, you better go inside now it's
getting dark" the little girl just gave me a big smile,and said "Bye
Lady, Bye Bye Phoebe". And skipped off up the driveway to the house, with
her dog following. We continued on up and around the block .</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The whole time I pondered what had just happened. I couldn't
help but have a strange feeling, not good, or bad, but just weird. I had never
seen that little girl, or her dog before. And having my own dog to walk, I was
fairly familiar with the neighbors. I also had seen many children around
playing, but none that looked anything like this girl. Besides, most of the
children were older than her anyway.To this day, a year later, I still have not
seen the girl and her dog. I have walked by that same house many times, and it seems
that a middle aged man lives their alone. He drives a sporty SUV, and is rarely
home. But the strangest thing is my dog's behavior. My little dog had never met
a kid she didn't jump on and give kisses. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have told this story to several people, and everyone has
been a little freaked out. I think I am going to do some research on the
history of my neighbor hood and see if I can turn up some clues.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi, my name is Itzel Gonzalez, and I would like to declare
myself as a person that has seen ghosts. How can I start, I am pshycic, and I
talk to ghosts also I have once been attacked by one. Since when I was 5 years
old I started my adventure on <st1:country-region><st1:place>Mexico</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
In the house of my aunt I used to see a little boy, actually I could only see
his hat. Well then at the age of 11 when I bearly got my own house I started to
see a girl in about the age of 7. It was one night that I saw a girl on my
feet. She was white, glowing, and had a long, beautiful, straight hair. At
first i thought it was my 5 year old sister, Idania, but something made me put
my right hand besides me. I went white and cold blooded as a reptile when I
felt my sister's hair silky and long. All I did was pray to god for her to
leave me this night that I could help her some other day. The next night as I
was looking on the window still thinking of the scary incident that had
happened to me the night before. I felt someone looking at me as I turned
slowly toward the sight I saw a tall shadow. The first thing I did was cover
myself, the next thing that happened was that I felt a body on top of me trying
to suffocate me. Well, I just threw myself up and the spirit went away. Up to
now the girl visit me the past Christmas and the latest is that she followed me
to school on thursday. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Our Ghost Stories</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: jreed66@bootheel.net</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I've grown up hearing ghost stories most of my life on dark
stormy nights, and every bump in the night was never explained away by "
Oh it's just the wind", or "It's just the house settling".
Instead, I was always told, "It's just the spirits coming for a
visit".<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have always had one spirit or another bouncing around
where I lived. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The home I have lived in now for five years is filled with
the little specters and we've had some times with them.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Two days after we moved in, I was doing my house work around
<st1:time minute="0" hour="23">11:00 pm</st1:time> when the house is quiet, the
kids are asleep and my husband still at work. While doing dishes at the kitchen
sink, I felt as if someone was watching me. I thought it was one of the kids up
for a drink so I kept working. The hair on the back of my neck stood on end and
I looked in the dark window in front of me. Two eyes looking right into my own,
and not my reflection. The window was too high up for someone to just be
standing there, and there was an electric stove in front on the other side. I
turned to look behind me, but there was no one visible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After turning to the feeling several times, I
finally ignored it, until an insect repellant can "rolled" out of the
cabinet behind me and stopped at my feet across the room. I replaced it in the
cabinet and two more times. Finally I pulled the glass window shut in front of
it, to dry the dishes. The can flew out of the cabinet this time and just
missed my head, slamming into the cabinet in front of me. I took the can back
to the cabinet, and had to open the door to put it in. This time I said
"Stop it, I'm busy and don't have time to mess with you right now!"
It stayed put. Each night I could feel the eyes on me but ignored it.
Eventually it settled down when I started finishing my work earlier.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A few months later, while going through the kitchen, I saw a
little boy in the hall from the corner of my eye. I continued watching him from
this view, so he wouldn't know that I could see him. He had black hair cut in a
page boy cut like my own son's, white shirt and black pants. When I turned to
face him, he was gone. I have seen him two other times once in the hall and
once in my yard. Once I saw a woman standing in front of my picture window, her
feet going right through our sofa. She had one of those 40's rolled back hair
styles, and a floral dress on. I stared right at her. She was crying and
appearing to be watching for someone to come to the house. I asked her if I
could help her and she faded away.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My entire family has seen the man's shadow walking down our
hallway and can hear his footsteps as if he is walking on a hard wood floor but
it's carpeted. He scares my husband half to death who never believed in ghost
until he married me and each house we live in has had spirits in them. He
thinks that I attract them. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Most recently I was awoke by a man pulling hard on my ear. I
have never seen him before and he's a dark slightly frightening man. He had on
a long black coat and black clothes like Mormons from long ago. His hair was
dark black with a widows peak and his face thin and drawn. His expression was
angry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband and I moved into a
room we had redone that was once the sun room, and one of my older son's now
has the room but he won't sleep in there because the window opens by itself.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We don't show fear, I heard that they can't hurt you unless
you let them, but I had a bruise for days on my ear.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A lot of things happen in the house. The lights go on and
off by theirselves along with our television. The light bulbs blow
similtaneously and we keep a drawer full of them. Cabinet doors open and close
by theirselves, forks and sharp knives disappear and never come back so we are
always replacing them. The toilet flushes by itself and the water taps are
always just turning on, doors slam and we can hear a baby crying late at night
and no one around has one. Sometimes the power goes completely out and everyone
else still has power in town, and we haven't blown any thing, we just have to
let them come back on when it gets ready. Pretty creepy? That's just a smidge
of the odds that happen. There is often the smell of smoke and burned wires,
cabbage or rotting meat at the strangest of times, the smell of food cooking
when no one is up and music from my daughter's music box when it isn't even
wound late at night. Perfume wafts thorough our house, floral and light, and
the smell of spicy cologne that none of us wear.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Things really come to a head when we do a spring cleaning,
apparantly they like a clean house. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Our home was built in the 50's, It's had 4 families in it,
we and the family before are the only ones who have noticed the hauntings. I
know all the families who have lived here. We live near a place called the <st1:Street><st1:address>Pole
  Road</st1:address></st1:Street> in New Madrid Co., MO. During the Civil War,
most of this area was all swamp with very little civilization. Confederate
soldiers had to put tree poles end to end and side by side to make a road to
pull their wagons through the swamp. On the road where I live a confederate
soldier was found dead on a stump and his body never identified. It's in the
town history. Orbs are seen all over town, and there is a lot of dark history
here of people disappearing and strange deaths. This past year alone, 7 women
died with the same type of rare uterine cancer, and four men with stomach
cancer. They all died within two weeks. A girl hung herself in the school in
the 50's and the room where she was found floods often and there is no water
source there. The town is full of tunnels that I have heard were old fallout
shelters from one of the former town board ladies, but others say that they are
drains because it's possible the town could flood being a former swamp.I've
heard of children falling in and drowning, but none since I have lived near
this town for the past 20 years. It's possible for it to happen though, if
someone could take off the hundred pound lids or remove the steel bars from the
drain outlets. Not all of them have drain outlets, so they can't be used for
that, They are large steel and concrete openings into the ground like storm
shelters.One street floods with every rain for no reason. The founding father's
son lived there until a few years ago when he died in his late 90's. His house
is still there and is one of the oldest homes in the area. A lot of buildings
are reported haunted here, the old box plant and cotton compress are haunted by
some workers that were killed there. We haven't tried to exorcise them, but I
have had a medium here who used a Ouiji board for her source.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing out of the ordinary happened that
wasn't already happening other than the dark man appeared after that.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Ghost Story</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: denis_cuillierrier@pch.gc.ca</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I wanted to share a real story about a house I lived in when
I was a kid so here it is... </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I grew up in <st1:place><st1:City>Ottawa</st1:City>, <st1:State>Ontario</st1:State>,
 <st1:country-region>Canada</st1:country-region></st1:place>, in a house that
was kept in my family until my parents decided to sell it due to the high
mortgage rates. It was an old house that was built by Dr. Sweetland in the1860&#8217;s,
which was the first house, built on that street. It was sold to my ancestors
and my mother was taken care of by her great aunt when she was 9 years old,
after losing her father in a railcar accident in <st1:City><st1:place>Quebec
  City</st1:place></st1:City>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that
house, nine bodies were exposed due to the years when tuberculosis was a major
illness. When we lived there, we could hear things, especially at nighttime.
The house had an attic and we could sometimes hear someone walking. The
entrance of the attic was in my bedroom, a door which was locked at all times
that would sometime open by itself. I would come in my bedroom when it was time
to go to bed and I would find the attic door open. Sometimes, I could hear
someone coming down the stairs of the attic and stop at the door as if he or
she wanted to come in my room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tell
you, I always slept with my head under the blankets because I was spooked. My
father had a collection of paintings; he had at least 200 or more that were
hung through out the house. I was in the living room on day when I heard a
large bang on the wall and a painting just fell on some of my mother&#8217;s
crystals. Of course, I was the only one in the living room so I was accused of
doing it but even when I told my dad what just happened, he wouldn&#8217;t believe me
and he would punish me even more because he would say that on top of breaking
things, I was a liar&#8230; </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have 4 sisters and 2 brothers and they all witnessed
something during the years that we lived there. The last thing that happened
was very strange and I was happy to see that both my parents witnessed it as
well and for once, they saw that all those years, when we told them that
whatever broke, whatever noise they heard, wasn&#8217;t us kids but were actually
ghosts. Here&#8217;s what happened&#8230; </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Like I mentioned earlier, my parents had no choice but to
sell the house because the interest rates were way to high in the early 80&#8217;s
and my father, being the only one working, had trouble making the mortgage
payments. The &#8220;FOR SALE&#8221; sign was up and one of my sisters found herself an apartment
because she decided that at her age, it would be a good time for her to use
this opportunity and tell mom and dad that it was time for her to move out. She
bought herself some furniture and also bought herself a piano that she had
delivered to the old house until she would actually move to her new apartment a
few mouth later. My mother played the piano so she found some old music that
belonged to one of her great cousins who died in the house like all the other
eight from tuberculosis. She played some music but was playing one in
particular that she liked very much. According to some text that was written
behind the music sheet, it was also her cousin&#8217;s favourite that she played for
her siblings when they were exposed and a few weeks before she died. Anyway, a
few weeks after the piano was delivered, my mother noticed that the piano was
playing off key so my sister called the store where she bought it and the
salesman told her that he would send someone to tune it for her. The Piano
Tuner arrived, started tuning it and when he was done, he asked my sister if
someone had open the piano and played with the keys inside. She said no and the
tuner said that almost all the keys were so tight that they were about to
break. One thing he wouldn&#8217;t understand is that when a piano needs to be tuned,
it&#8217;s because the keys get loose so they need to be tightened. That wasn&#8217;t the
case, instead of loosening, they where tightening up. Anyway, it was fixed so
the man left. One week later, the same thing was happening, the piano was
playing off key so my sister called again and the Piano Tuner came to our house
and again, he couldn&#8217;t understand what was happening to the piano. He fixed it
and left. One week later, the same thing was happening, the piano was again
playing off key. The Piano Tuner and the Salesman came to the house to look at
the piano and again, the piano was having the same problem, the keys were very
tight, at the point where they would break one by one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Piano Tuner said that he&#8217;s tuned pianos
for 15 years and he never saw or heard of such a thing, a piano that tunes by
itself. He said that if he was to call the head office in <st1:City><st1:place>Toronto</st1:place></st1:City>,
they would tell him to go see a Psychologist because it wasn&#8217;t possible. The
Salesman decided to replace the piano with a new one and he would send the
first one to the company who builds them and just tell them that it was
defective. So, the next day, a new piano was delivered and guess what, a few
days after we got it, the same thing was happening. The salesman did not send
the Piano Tuner because my sister was moving the next week so he would rather
send the Piano Tuner to her new place and take a look at it. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">What I believe is that my ancestors who died and were
exposed in that house, their spirits were still there and new that the house
that was kept in my family for years was for sale and were probably not happy
about it and it was probably a way to show us their frustration. Today, that
house is a Bed and Breakfast and my sisters and bothers and I, spent a night at
the B &amp; B. The owners of the house told us that a Medium was once their
guest and when she came in the house, she told them that she could sense
spirits and she believed that there were nine of them and that they were good.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Ghosts and Blindness</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: goatboy@cox.net</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have a story I'd like to share. I am totally blind. I've
been this way since birth. We think it is hereditary because my brother is
blind in one eye but has perfect sight in the other. Anyway, my family and I
moved into this house when I was about three. The house bothered me at first. I
cried almost the whole day the first day we were there. My grandmother even
said to me, "Brettsy, you shouldn't cry at the new house." I don't
know if the new sarounding bothered me because they usually do, or if I felt
something noone else could feel. I eventually got used to the place and things
seemed allright. However, a year later, I got up in the middle of the night.
You know when you're a kid and your body says, "get up," you do.
Well, I went into the livingroom and to call it a blindism, or whatever, I
began running back and forth between the family room and the Foryay. I soon
stopped abruptly when I heard another pare of feet running next to me. I
figgured I should stop and maybe go sit on the couch. Well as I approached the
couch I heard a person move over to make room for me. Then I heard a woman's
voice somewhere in the room. It was undefinable as to where exactly it was
coming from. It said, "Did you speak to dah?" By then I was scared
pissless. I decided I'd better go back to bed. I lay there for a while and then
I heard someone come into my room. I lay really still hoping they couldn't hear
me breathe. The person approached my bed and began a rhythmic tapping on the
wall and the bed. Two taps on the wall and one on the bed. Tap Tap bump, tap
tap bump. I fell asleep but I woke the next morning with my head toward the
foot of the bed and my feet toward the head of the bed, and on either side of
my head were two pares of women's feet. It was as if I were lying at their<span style="">&nbsp; </span>feet. Soon my mom came in to wake me and
comented on how I was sleeping. I asked her if she had seen the two women
sleeping in my bed. She thought I was just being silly. The next night I was
affraid to go to sleep. "There's someone in my room mom," I cried.
"There's noone in your room," she sweetly replied. Well until I was
about ten I was visited by these women. Sometimes not for a while and then
frequency increased in times of trouble or low confidence like when my parents
began having trouble and talked about devorcing. However, as I became a
teenager and was quite sure of myself the visits completely stopped. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Years later after we moved out of that house my friend
Rollypolly and I thought<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to do some
research in the supernatural.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We found
the demons name to be D.A.X. Rollypolly instantly got a really bad feeling . We
did a little research and we found that Dax is a name of a deamond found in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Spain</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
It preys on weak people and thrives off of fear. That might be what, "Did
you speak to Da" meant. It also might explain why it came around in times
of sadness. It may just take on the form of a woman or women. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">i wrote just little while ago but i forgot to inform all of
a public place where you're sure to brush the paranormal surface. there is this
motel in west reading <st1:State><st1:place>pennsylvania</st1:place></st1:State>
called the PennView Motel. it's $66.64 including tax to stay there for a night.
enough sixes? anyway it's a completely legit motel just very old and ugly and
dirty. the only thing you should be afraid of is catching an infectious disease
from the sheets.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i stayed there with my boyfriend for a weekend and
afterwards i asked him if i was the only one who saw the black animals darting
around from the corner of my eye. he was surprised that i saw them considering
he's usually the first to notice if anything supernatural is around and
promptly wards it off for me. i call them gremlins. this place is absolutely
teeming with them. i read a lot people see them. my old roommate/sifu/mystic
explains that they aren't actual gremlins but shadow-dwelling entities that
appear in areas where things aren't going all that wonderfully--people dabbling
with black magic, or just outright acting badly. some people have them that
follow them everywhere. if you're one of these people i suggest a major
lifestyle change.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Mushroom Mines in Soldier, <st1:State><st1:place>Kentucky</st1:place></st1:State></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: CSilverHair66@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">About a month ago I went to go visit a friend who goes to <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Morehead</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>State</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceType>University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.
When I got there we had nothing to do, so she starting telling me about a
haunted mushroom mine that's in Solider, <st1:State><st1:place>Kentucky</st1:place></st1:State>.
I wanted to go so badly because that kind of stuff interested me. So we drove
all the way there, and it was in the middle of the day so it was still light
out. When I got out of the car I got an uneasy feeling, but I ignored because I
wanted to go in so badly. So we grabbed our flashlights and went over the dirt
pile that goes all the way around the entrance of the mine. So we went inside
and to your left is a room and I heard a big boom, like someone threw something
at me. and I ran out of there as fast as I could. I got so scared and I don't
get scared that easy either. I just stood at the entrance of this big huge
mine. My friend decided she was going to go in further. I just stood there
watching her go in further and further until I couldn't see her anymore, and
I'm freaking out because she was in there all by herself walking around this
evil place. About 10 or 15 minutes later she came back into site, but she was
still far inside the cave and the more she came into site I could see someone
walking behind her, and we were the only ones there. She starting running
towards the opening of the mine, the figure still behind her. When she got to
where the sun came in mine the figure stopped chasing her. I was so amazed
because you could see the outline of this person that had been chasing her, and
usually you read about people seeing things out of the corner of their eyes, I
was looking right at this white figure of a man. As he was walking back in the
mine he keep looking back, as if telling us not to come back in, it was very
weird, he was evil you could feel it.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">On our way back to school we were talking about what we felt
and what we heard and saw, that's all we could talk about for the rest of the
day. I took the 2 hour drive back home and still the only thing on my mind was
the Mushroom Mine. when I got home I got on the computer to check my e-mail. I
got an idea to look the Haunted Mushroom Mine on the computer, and I came
across your website and I read what you had put about the mines about the man
following people out of the mine. I don't want to sound mean but I was kind of
disappointed that there wasn't any back ground information on the mines like
what happened there to make it so haunted. I think it is the most frightening
place or thing I have experienced in my life. So I was thinking you should go
there and get more info about it. Thank You for taking the time and reading
this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Right Time to Share</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: dulegstmiramherzen@hotmail.com]</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I discovered your site many years ago, but thought that the
time was right to share of my experiences of my home and the experience my family
has had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The first one I want to share w/ you is my parent's
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As far as I know we are the
second family to have lived there and my family moved in the house in
1981.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stairway to the basement has
always been a source of uneasiness, but the basement itself is worse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The basement is cut in half by a wall, we
call the 2 parts downstairs (or sometimes the basement) and the basement
basement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The downstairs/basement is the
tv area and computer room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also
functions as a guest bedroom for visiting brothers from college.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The basement basement is just an unfinished
basement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The basement basement falls
where the stairs are and so part of it has a sloping ceiling from the
stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I used to play in that area as a
little girl, but only during the day when my dad was down there working in his
workshop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I have to go downthere, even to this day (and I am a 25
yr old woman) I turn on all the lights and get what I need as quickly as
possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought I was alone in
feeling like something wanted to harm me (I get this feeling only in that part
of the basement, the part under the stairs) until Christmas 2003 when my
brother was teasing my sister in law about the "gremlins" (his
word).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It turns out that 3 out of the 4
siblings had felt the same thing, the unease, the feeling that whatever it was
wanted to harm them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never had a big
problem w/ these feelings since I could usually avoid going into the basement
basement, however, it grew harder the time my dad recarpeted the stairs and
left the stairs bare for a couple of weeks.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I tried to avoid going downstairs at all b/c of the feelings that
something wanted to grab my ankles.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The next experience was one that my brothers had at our
grandmother's house. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">They were spending the night at her house sleeping on the 2
couches in the living room when they were woke up by the sound of a coo coo
clock they couldn't see (we later learned that granny had one, but it was
broken in the attic and wasn't fixed for 20 years).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of my brothers looked into my
grandparent's bedroom (directly across from him) and saw a woman sitting,
brushing her long hair in front of my granny's vanity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They say she looked at them through the
mirror, smiled, and vanished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They, of
course, told us and mom the story, but mom claims that it was just granny
brushing her hair in the morning and that they didn't recognize her b/c she had
always worn her hair up, not down.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The last story I would like to share is when I visited the
Concentration Camp named Buchenwald in what used to be <st1:country-region><st1:place>East
  Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was going there w/ a couple of friends, 2 of whom had already been
there and would act as my tour guide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
soon as we stepped off the bus, I could feel a sense of heaviness, a
depression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It continued the entire time
I was on the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never saw
anything there, but I know that the events that occured there have placed a
"stain" if you will on the atmosphere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only thing that I saw that was unusual
was one of the mass graves had a depression (as all graves do if they aren't filled
in), but this depression was in the shape of a cross.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This mass grave wasn't for the Jews, it was
filled w/ Russian soldjers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought
that was noteworthy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt a depression
and a heaviness I have never felt before and hope to never feel again until I
stepped back on the bus to leave.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">These are my experiences and my families.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thank you for allowing me to share them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi, my name is Jordan, I'm only 16 but I've had a lot of
experiences with ghosts.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I dont even know where to begin...well...I guess I'll tell
you about the first house I lived in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
live in a township called Ridley right outside of Philadelphia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house I lived in was only 50 or some
years old when we moved in in the late 80s, when i was born.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The neighbors told us that the couple who
lived there before never got along.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
man was a cop and one day his wife took his gun and shot him while he was
shaving in the upstairs bathroom.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Well...we had lived in the house for a few years before
anything really happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day while
my brother was playing soccer he sprained his ankle and had to use
crutches.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since it was hard for him to
get around, he stayed at home while the rest of my family (me, my mom, my dad,
and my sister) went out to buy a christmas tree since it was coming up
close.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we all got home, we found
our brother running out of the back door without his crutches screaming and
crying, holding our dog Watson in his arms.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He threw him into the car and we headed to our granmoms house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told us that he had gone up to the
bathroom and saw a strange light in my and my sisters room, assuming it was
just the car pulling into the driveway and the headlights shining through the
window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But after he got out of the
bathroom, the light was right in front of him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He told us it was in the shape of a person and held his hand out to him
and he heard a voice say "run danger life".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well he definently ran.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He ran down the steps and out the door just
as we pulled up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was the first
encounter any of us had.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After that, strange things kept happening, our piano and my
dads guitar would play by themselves, the water in the bathroom upstairs would
turn on by itself, my brothers globe would spin around without anyone touching
it, ceiling fans or lights would turn on and off, and my dog would constantly
stare up the steps growling and barking at nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atleast nothing we could see.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also heard things from my sister and
brother, my sister told me she saw it standing in my parents bedroom looking
out of the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My brother told me he
was in the bathroom and the shower curtain started to pull open by itself very
slowly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One thing that freaked me out
the most was when my sister told me she had woke up in the middle of the night
and saw a figure standing over me while i was sleeping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But for some reason when she told me this, I
wasnt scared. After a few years, my parents were divorced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom and us moved into an apartment only a
few minutes away so that i wouldnt have to change schools.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day after school I was at my Dads house,
our old house, and I was sitting on the couch watching TV, only me and my dad
were there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt someone come up
behind me and pat me on the head, then walk up the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few minutes later my friend came to the
door and I went to my dads room to get a brush and he was sleeping in his
bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one else was there but him, and
I never heard anyone come back downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I used to hear footsteps all of the time when i was home alone and
almost every morning while I was getting ready for school when i was little I
would see it standing in the hallway.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Well, my Dad ended up moving out of the place a few years
later and into an apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing has
happened here.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Meanwhile at my moms apartment, only a few things had happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three major things happened there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first thing, my mom was by herself and
she was sitting on the couch, and she said that suddenly the light in her
bedroom turned on and the door shut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
found her standing outside on the steps.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Another thing, I was sitting up very late at night or early in the
morning, however you want to look at it, it was 4:30 am.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was on the computer and I heard a strange
noise in my ear, the only way i can describe it sounding was like a robot or
something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It freaked me out so I went
to bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The strange thing was, the next
night I went to bed earlier, but couldnt fall asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was almost 4:30 when I had last looked at
the clock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard the sound again out
in my living room minutes later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few
weeks after I was<span style="">&nbsp; </span>going to bed, and I
noticed a ball of light in the corner of my room...I figured it was just a
light coming in from the window, since it was directly opposite from it, but
when i rearranged the blinds, nothing changed about the ball of light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I wasnt scared, I got the same feeling
that I did when my sister told me about the ghost standing over me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Somehow I knew that it was the same ghost...I
just get this feeling that he was watching over me for some reason...but
nothing has happened since I turned 13.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Other things have happened, but I figured this is already
long enough.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am very interested in
ghosts...but not when theyre in my home.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My grandmother died back in 1994. I was about 5 years old at
the time. When my father was going to visit her in the hospital and he sensed a
spirit walking by him and he recognized the smell of his mother. He walked into
the room and was informed that she had passed away. Later, after the funeral I
was laying in my bed and I wasn't completely asleep but I was almost there. I
then saw a figure of my grandmother standing there and she told me she wasn't
in heaven yet, but she was going to be there soon. I told my parents about it
and they didn't think all that much of it because I was so young. Well during
the winter of 1994 but Dad starting hearing banging noises along the house and
went he went outside to see what it was, he noticed there were no footprints or
anything. The minute he would go back to bed the banging noises would start
again. Also around that time my sister would lay in bed and hear distinct
footstephs that sounded like my grandmother walking up but when she would look
down the stairs no one was there. A very religous neighbor of mine told my
family to pray for her because she was probably just a lost soul and couldn't
find her way. We dont hear her as much anymore, but I notice as im writing this
there are noises downstairs and no one is home. I'm going to investigate.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My own ghost story happened when I was about 15 years
old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friend and I were walking in the
cemetery, which is something we did on a regular basis considering we were
neighbors and shared the same back yard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this case, it was the <st1:PlaceName>Oak Ridge</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Cemetery</st1:PlaceType>
located in <st1:place><st1:City>Southbridge</st1:City>, <st1:State>MA</st1:State></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We came across a freshly buried grave site
where mourners had thrown various flowers over the dirt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friend and I decided to take 2 roses each.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If her Mom asked where she had gotten them,
she would say from a bouquet at my house, and if my Mom asked, I would do the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We stayed at my house until 10 PM
or so and then decided we would spend the night at her house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We made our way next door, down a long
driveway which led to her home since her house was set back farther than mine,
when we noticed someone standing on the other side of the rock wall in the
cemetery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first we just stood there
staring because we weren't sure of what we were seeing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a man in white, who seemed to be
glowing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we stood there he raised his
hands to us and motioned for us to come him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Or maybe just to notice him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was like watching someone flag down a plane on a runway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were so afraid we just turned around and
ran down the driveway, across the street and hid behind a parked car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were shaking so hard we could barely
speak.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember going back down the
drive way very slowly holding her hand just to confirm what we had seen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was still there so we cut across my yard
and ran in my house hysterical.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My Mom
tried to calm me down and I confessed everything we had done during that
day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was very disappointed in
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My brother and his friend were
laughing at us the entire time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I
didn't care.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friend and I along with
my stepfather returned down her drive way.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We made it to the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We scanned the cemetery with a
flashlight my stepfather had brought, and screamed at what we saw next.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Along one of the many roads in the cemetery
we saw the same man walking towards the grave we had taken the flowers
from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had traces of white trailing
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friend and I screamed "He's
over there!" and ran back to my house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My stepfather just stood there and soon followed us saying he saw
nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several strange events took
place that night, but I don't know if you would post such a long story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I will end with this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am now almost 23 years old and I think of
this experience at least once a day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
still get goosebumps every time I think of it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I would just like to say that ghosts do exist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As for my friend, I'm not sure if she still
thinks of that day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've since lost
contact with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it has taught me
to respect the dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I even wrote an
apology note to the man the next day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But was to afraid to leave it by his grave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Someday I will leave it there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I am from <st1:place><st1:City>Lake Charles</st1:City> <st1:State>Louisiana</st1:State></st1:place>
and have always lived here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since I was
five I have experienced things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First I
lived in Chennault appartments where me and my mom saw an army man coming out
of the shower and he walked right through our bedroom door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I was 13 we moved into a house on the
corner of Creole and Louie st.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is
where I experienced things I never could have imagined and it seemed like they
would find one person in the house to pick on and it was me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would be alone at night waiting for my mom
to get off or my friend to get back home because she and her mom lived with us
and all of the sudden I could hear banging and slamming of things upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would get scared so bad I would call my mom
at work to come home or I would call someone to come and get me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one believed me because it kept only
happening to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a couple times my
mom and my friends mom claimed of hearing someone walking through their room at
night thinking it was us but it was not.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Several times I had these things happen to me and it seemed to get worse
each time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Door knobs jiggling, banging
on the wall, and even doors slamming.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Well the very last time before we moved out it all started again and I
called my mom and she came home and sat down and began telling me that she
thought I may need help and sure enough right as she finished the sentence
every doorknob in the house started jigging.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After that we moved out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Me and
my sister in law went to the house this past year and I am now 23 so its been
10 years and the new owner say the same things happen to them exept its the
same as me, the ghost or ghosts only pick on the wife of the man who lives
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has heard a few things but she
claims that whenever he leaves it does those things to her also.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I wasn't crazy afterall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just recently found out that a man
committed suicide there 2 years before we moved in.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">One day in the summer of 2003 a girl who was badly beaten
stumbled onto my front lawn. No one else being home my mother 9months pregnant
decided to call for some help. After calling the police, she rushed out side to
attend to the girl, her head had been brutally abused, her head was bashed in
badly and blood was gushing out of the open wound. my mom asked the young girl
who had done this to her but she did not respond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once the police and ambulance came we never
found out about what happened to the girl. Recently my mom woke up in the
morning, around 7:30, and the front door was wide open, she did not think
anything about it. Later on that day, she and my dad were relaxing in the
living room when all of the sudden a the dogs began to bark very loud as though
someone was walking in our yard. Sitting up, my parents saw a young girl about
the same age, and simmilar features as the girl that had wandered into our yard
years before, she turned up the drive way and towards the front door. My mother
mistaked the girl for a sales person, and opened the front door, just as that
happend, the dogs became silent and the girl was gone. the next few days,
various and frightening happenings occoured, the T.V would turn on, on its own,
the door would open as the whole family was sleeping. on one occasion, a friend
of mine was awaiting my arrival home, she and her mother were waiting in their
car in front of our house, they were looking at the window, and saw blue lights
flashing inside. that very same day my boyfriend said that someone signed on
AIM with my mom's screen name and kept putting the away message on all day.
Soon after the happenings stopped. We don't know if the girl had anything do do
with all that happened that strange week.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This story happend about 2 years ago. My moms dad Peter died
when she was like 6 years old. So she never really got to know him and
naturally I didnt know him. One night my friend Mandy was staying the night at
my house. We had been planning to shaving cream my brother that night because
he had gotten us twice before and we were looking for revenge. LOL Both our
rooms are upstairs with the stairs in the middle of them. About 2am Mandy and I
got up to do the deed. I told Mandy to go downstairs and get the shaving cream.
I stayed in my room and waited. She walked out the door then came back in a few
seconds later and said "Josh is standing at the bottom of the staris and
he seen me!" I opened my door and looked across at Josh's room and seen
him laying in his bed. I told Mandy. "<st1:place><st1:City>Ur</st1:City></st1:place>
seeing things, look his still sleeping" She was like then "Who's at
the bottom of the stairs." I looked around the corner and down the stairs
and there was a man standing there. He was there just stairing at us. He didnt
seem angry nor happy. But he didnt seem to be a threat. He looked slightly
fimilar but I couldnt place a name. But I could see where Mandy thought it was
Josh becasue I could see some resemblence. I looked at Mandy and said "Get
back into bed because I dont know who that is!" When she looked around the
corner and down the stairs she whispered "He's gone". When I looked
again...sure enough he was gone. The next morning my mom was going through some
pictures and putting them in frames. Mandy picked up my grandparents wedding
picture and nearly fainted. I asked her what was wrong and she showed me the
picture. I hadnt seen the picture in years and the man we had seen the prevouis
night had been my grandpa!! We told my mom about what appened and she was
shocked. But she belived us that we had seen my grandpas ghost. About 2 weeks
later Mandy was staying the night at my house again. I belived we had a ghost
that opened our cabinets, he opened and shut windows, pushed buttons on the
micorwave and things like that. Me, her and my brother were in the kitchen
getting ready to pop some popcorn when i shut the door on the microwave, it
started before I pushed any buttons. Mandy flipped out but I told her that was
just another ghost. She asked his name. I told her I hadnt named him yet. She
told me too. All of a sudden the name Jonathan came to me. So thats what I
named him. That night her and my family (mom, dad,brother,me) were sitting in
the living room when our front door opened. Mandy asked what happened and I was
like "oh that was just Jonathan again" My mother looked at me and
said "what did u just call him??!!" I was like "Jonathan"
She said "why did you name him that?" I was like "I dont know.
Jonathan just popped into my mind." Dad asked my mom wha the big deal was
about the name Jonathan. She looked at me and asked if i knew who Jonathan was.
I was dumbfounded and said No. She told me that Jonathan was my great grandpa!
I thought it was neat. So now we belive that not only is my grandpa ghost here
but my great grandpa! Thanks for your time.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I was asleep one night about a couple of years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I woke up really late like about 2 or 3 in
the morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked through the
doorway of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my bedroom door and I saw a
dark figure move quickly across.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
called out, "mom?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was
no reply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I saw her face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only, it wasn't really her, her eyes were red
and menacing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could tell it wasn't
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was something evil.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But just as quickly as I saw her, she
disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thinking that the darkness
was playing tricks on my tired eyes I sat back to go back to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then something very strange and frightening
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was lying on my back and
completely paralyzed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could not move
any part of my body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried to call for
my mom but my voice was somehow choked.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All I could do was think.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
prayed to God in my mind to forgive me of my sins, to save my life and my
soul.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I saw this blue square
box-like shape hover above me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
slightly translucent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(it looked like a
tv screen, snowy-like when it makes that white noise sound)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well to me it felt like this object thing was
draining my energy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt my eyes
starting to close but I fought to keep them open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before I closed my eyes I could see a
transparent blue illumination figure exactly like me being pulled into the blue
box.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My last thought was God I love you
please save my soul.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I believed the
figure of me to be my soul.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Next thing I
know I open eyes, sit up real fast covered in sweat and scared to death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got down on my knees and prayed to God
thanks for saving my life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing like
this has ever happened to me and hasn't since then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm not sure what the blue box was to this
day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm a real skeptic for ghosts
but<span style="">&nbsp; </span>this most definitely was not a dream
so I have no idea what it was!!!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When I was a child in middle school I had a very frightening
experience that continued off and on for approxiamately 10 years. When I was a
child I lived on Travis AFB in <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>.
I was out riding my bike one night and stopped at the ball field. I was sitting
on the top of the bleachers when I looked up and saw this figure dressed in
black robes. I was shocked to say the least. I then noticed that it was on the
same level as me, this was unusual because the field was level. I notiiced that
it had green eyes with viens (similar to looking deep into a cats eyes). I was
so scared I did a backflip off of the bleachers and hopped on my bike and
peddled as fast as I could. I reached home and ran inside. I never really felt
safe after that. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then about three years later I was living in a house in <st1:place><st1:City>Vacaville</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>California</st1:State></st1:place>. The way this house was set up
was that the living room had a hallway that ran off of it in an L shape down
this hallway were the bedrooms. The kitchen was behind the living room. In the
living room we had the sofa against one wall (from which you could look down
the hallway) and a chair sat next to the front door and the TV was in a corner.
I was home alone and it was about 2 in the morning. I saw a movement out of the
corner of my eye so I looked up and sitting in the chair about three feet away
was the same figure. I watched it as it slowly stood up. It moved towards me
and I could feel very negative emotions coming from it. I just froze I could
not move and so I thought to myself if this thing touches me I am dead. I then
formed a power symbol in my head and threw it at the thing and at the same time
I thught to myself I bind you and demand that you leave immediately. The next
moment it disappeared. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I did not see it again until years later. Just before I got
married. I was not alone when I saw it this time. My fiancee was with me and
she saw it too. We were in front of her uncles house and we both smelled this
horrible stench. we looked up and the thing was right in front of us about a
foot away. My fiancee being Catholic and having holy water threw the water at
it and it disappeared and I have not seen it since.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We have been in our house for eleven years and during that
entire time we have felt we aren't alone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On many occasions I have had the feeling someone is watching me....not
from outside the house, but inside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
have been in my basement and couldn't get upstairs fast enough because a
feeling of dread overtakes me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">While alone in the house I hear noises...no pets were in the
house at the time, although we do have pets.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The sound was that of something coming up the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My son who is now six has commented about ghosts in his
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do know the original owner's son
was born in that room and that he passed away many miles from our home a few

long before he died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not aware if
anyone died in our home.</p>

thirty plus years ago asked if we had seen the ghost in our house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did not have the chance to ask what he was
talking about.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The strangest event happened to my husband today.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said he took clothes out of the dryer
and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>his pants and shirt were buttoned
while in the dryer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have a friend who
also talked of this happening in his house.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We are in the process of moving and are away from the house
for as long as ten days at a time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
husband says the occurances seem to be happening more as we spend time away
from the house.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I no longer live in the house as my son and I have moved to
our new home in another state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
house is brand new and nothing happens here that is of a supernatural nature.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">If it was only one person in the house who was experiencing
things I would be skeptical.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I almost
forgot...our cats would often stare at nothing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">An experience that I had at the tree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My cousin told me of the tree so of course I
wanted to see it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After passing the
three humps in the road at 2:00 in the morning I came to a curve that my cousin
told to slow down on good thing because if I had been by myself I would have
wrecked into the tree that was in the middle of the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now I don&#8217;t mean laying down I mean planted
in the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After observing the tree I
did a burn out next to it. (bad move) Before I got off of the road my car broke
down three times as if each witch took a lash at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My fan belt split twice long ways and once
side ways to deliver the final blow.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Freaky, you can say that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My car
showed no sign of belt wear just cuts.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">While I was stationed in <st1:country-region>Germany</st1:country-region>,
I got married to my wife in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Denmark</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
We stayed at a nice little hotel that was built in the 1400&#8217;s. We stayed a
total of 3 nights and never had a problem until the last night. Late in the
last night, I was laying in bed with my new wife. We were both facing a wall
away from the door. I said something along the lines of &#8220;I&#8217;ll always keep you
safe&#8221; At that moment, an overwhelming fear came over me. At the same time, my
wife said, &#8220;Why did you just say that?&#8221; I had no real reason but she described
to me that she was feeling the same thing I was and we were able to determine
that the source of our unexplained fear was coming from the doorway behind us.
Neither I nor my wife wanted to turn to see if anything was there. When I
finally mustered up the courage to look, I was convinced that I was going to be
looking directly into the eyes of the Devil. However, nothing was there and
shortly after the fear subsided. I have jumped out of planes and been to combat
twice, but I have never felt as scared as I was that night.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi my name is Melissa from Virginia Beach VA. I have had
some strange things happen to me on this 26 years of life here on this planet.
These stories are the truest to my knowledge and I hope you enjoy them. I have
alot to say so sit back and enjoy!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The year was 1985 I was 5 or 6 and I was in Lake
Winnipisauke<span style="">&nbsp; </span>New Hampshire with my mom
and her boyfriend. We were taking a walk after dinner and I saw someone walking
at the edge of the woods were it meets the road. He seemed to be an Indian he
was naked except for his bottom half being covered up. He was staring at me and
my eyes were locked I wanted to get my moms attention but I could not look away
nor speak. When I could finally tell my mom to look she did and she said
"what man I don't see anyone" I was very confused and couldn't
understand why they couldn't see or hear him walking in the woods. We turned
around and I looked in the woods trying to find him no luck, when we got back
to the cabin I wanted to find him again still no luck. I never forgot about him
and I know what I saw, people think I'm crazy when I tell them the story but
now I realize it was an Indian ghost and children do see things that adults
can't see. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The year was 1993 I was 14 and we moved into this really
great house in <st1:place><st1:City>Hampton</st1:City> <st1:State>VA.</st1:State></st1:place>
Everything was fine and normal at first until I started to date this guy. He
had a brother named Tim that committed suicide in the field sort of across the street
from my house. We would hang out in the field quite often and soon after
strange things started to happen. The lights would turn on in the middle of the
night including my room, the vacuum was turned on one night. I was doing
seiances in the house and I didn't think much of it until I did it in my room
one ight with a friend and the cat was with us also. The cat freaked out hair
standing on it's back hissing at something and ran out. We freaked out also and
turned the lights back on and never did that again. I'm pretty sure that my
boyfriends brother was the ghost in our house. Maybe he felt safe with us and
knew that I was friends with his brother. He hated his dad and stepmom and
that's why he killed himself. It saddens me to think about it and knowing that
he is probably trapped in this world forever and will never get to see the
light.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The year is 1999 and my family moved to <st1:PlaceName>Middlesex</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceType>County</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName>Va</st1:PlaceName>, 40
minutes from the mysterious Cohoke light in <st1:place>West Point</st1:place>.
The house they moved into was built in 1902 and used to serve as ferry house
that would carry the people across the <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Rappahnock</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>River</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. The house has had many
owners and the ones before my mom used it as a summer home. The house was quite
at first until things started to dissappear like the house key that was sitting
on the counter the night before, and my moms yummy peanut brittle bars that she
made on Xmas and mysteriously got half eaten and cut perfectly while she was on
vacation. Not so sure about that one! My step-father is the first to see the ghost
he saw him walk around the perimiter of the house and saw his features very
clearly. He had long grey hair in a ponytail, long beard, white button down
shirt, blue jeans and no shoes. We believe he was the ferryboat operator, and
did not want my family to take his home. My mom has also seen him pacing back
and forth along the cliff where the steps lead down to<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ferry boat she thought she was dreaming at
first and the person she was talking to outside thought she was crazy by the
look on her face. He looked back and saw noone. Then she felt him touch her
shoulder and felt his presence behind her. I have never seen him but have felt
strange things and feeling like I'm being watched. I never leave the room at
night without having lights on and off within my reach. other siblings have
also felt his presence. At night I always sense someone peering at me through
the windows but it is pitch black outside and you can't see a thing. I will be
going back to her house soon to try to get some video footage hopefully I get
something!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My next story is quite strange it's one of those things that
make you wonder if our angels can be placed into human form. It was summer 2004
I was in <st1:place><st1:City>Portsmouth</st1:City> <st1:State>VA</st1:State></st1:place>
at 7-11 with my kids getting slurpees. This old lady around 75-80 comes up to
me as I'm getting my kids out of </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the car she tells me I have beautiful reddish hair (as she
strokes my hair) just like hers when she was younger (my hair has a tint of red
depending on the hair dye!) Then she tells me how beautiful my kids are and
asks how old they are and their names (Hannah was 5, Ian was 3) she tells me
I'm very lucky. Then out of nowhere she tells me her bithday <st1:date year="1931" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1931</st1:date>. That is the day of my
birthday! I secretly freaked out my heart jumped and stomach dropped. She then
walked back to her car not even entering the store. When we left the store she
walked up to my car after I backed out and almost got hit by the macho guy and
his macho truck and she said to me "don't worry honey your gonna live
longer than him"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was so freaked
out my encounter with this lady like she was an angel or something. After being
on the interstate for about 25 min heading back to Virginia Beach I see this
truck with furniture in it and the chairs were not tied down, I got in another
lane cuz I knew something was gonna happen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sure enough the car in front of me slams on it's brakes and so do I and
all the cars behind me with all the cars going "screeeech!!!!!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>what do I see? chairs all over the interstate
and as I finally came to a stop I hit a chair along the way scratching up and
denting my front bumper. I had a slight anxiety attack with my whole b y
shaking, I was so lucky I didn't get hit with my kids in the car. I looked back
at all the cars stopped I was lucky to be alive. Was that my guardian angel in
human form at 7-11? I will never know but I'm a believer that anything is
possible. Well those are my stories I hope they weren't too long! Write back if
you have any questions or comments-</p>
