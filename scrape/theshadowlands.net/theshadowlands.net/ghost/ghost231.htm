<BR><B>My Ghostly Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: dizidez@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I've had several different encounters, but I wish to tell two of
my stories</B>
<BR><B>that don't make much sense to me.&nbsp; I am hoping that someone
out there has</B>
<BR><B>experienced something similar and can provide me with an explaination</B>
<BR><B>because my stories seem to be a little to unique. I assure you that
I am a</B>
<BR><B>sane and normal person.</B>
<BR><B>My first story is this:</B>
<BR><B>It started when I was 15 years old, peaked when I was 20 and now,</B>
<BR><B>thankfully, has stopped occuring at the age of 22. I will try to
condense</B>
<BR><B>this as much as possible so it won't be too long.</B>
<BR><B>For the first couple of years I would wake up around the same time
a few</B>
<BR><B>nights a week and find myself paralyzed, completely.&nbsp; I could
feel something</B>
<BR><B>near me, but saw nothing. I would try to scream for my mother every
time,</B>
<BR><B>but nothing would come out.&nbsp; My entire body would tingle and
I couldn't see.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; However, the feeling was very, very real and I knew that
I was not</B>
<BR><B>sleeping.&nbsp; It would only last for about 20 seconds, but felt
like forever.</B>
<BR><B>Then all of a sudden I could see, move and had the ability to scream
if I</B>
<BR><B>wanted.&nbsp; But once the experiece was over, I wouldn't want to
scream anymore.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; One day my sister confided in me and described what would
happen to her at</B>
<BR><B>night.&nbsp; I had not told her yet about my experiences because
I didn't know</B>
<BR><B>what to think of them. The odd part is that she experienced the
same thing</B>
<BR><B>that I did and around the same time.&nbsp; Moving along. . .between
the ages of</B>
<BR><B>18 and 19 the occurances began to get stronger.&nbsp; I could still
feel the</B>
<BR><B>other presence in my room and would still have the urge to scream
out for</B>
<BR><B>help, but I would start to see visions, ones that I could not make
out. Keep</B>
<BR><B>in mind that before I could not see anything or open my eyes. At
the age of</B>
<BR><B>20 things got really weird. Everything would occur as before and
I still</B>
<BR><B>couldn't see whatever was in there with me, not that I wanted to,
but I</B>
<BR><B>could start making out more and more of those visions.&nbsp; It
started small.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>could see my television, which stood next to my bed.&nbsp; However,
my eyes were</B>
<BR><B>not open.&nbsp; Then I could see things across my room. Finally,
my last straw</B>
<BR><B>before I refused to allow this to happen again. ALthough, I couldn't
see</B>
<BR><B>myself, I could see from my own point of view.&nbsp; I woke up paralyzed
only I</B>
<BR><B>didn't tingle and I could see my own bed, the bed that I was lying
in and I</B>
<BR><B>could see myself lying in it. I was at my doorway stuggling to get
back to</B>
<BR><B>my body, wow this sounds nuts. .I know. Finally, after what seemed
like an</B>
<BR><B>eternity of struggling back to my bed, the bed which I never moved
from, I</B>
<BR><B>felt this pound on my chest and then I could open my eyes. I sat
up, scared</B>
<BR><B>out of my mind, and told whatever presence was there to leave me
alone.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>don't know why but I got this sense that it wanted me to cross to
it's world</B>
<BR><B>and that it was disappointed that I told it to leave.&nbsp; After
that night, it</B>
<BR><B>never happened again.&nbsp; Sometimes I still feel it nearby and
beg it not to</B>
<BR><B>scare me anymore.&nbsp; So far it has listened. I've never told
my sister about</B>
<BR><B>my last experience because she has always been very sensitive to
spirits,</B>
<BR><B>but does not take joy in that so I don't want to upset her.</B>
<BR><B>My second very weird experience:</B>
<BR><B>This one actually happened as a single event and occured before
the other</B>
<BR><B>series of events that I just described began. I told this story
on another</B>
<BR><B>web site as well because I am hoping that someone will read it and
say,</B>
<BR><B>"That's happened to me too!"&nbsp; This one is tough to describe
and before I do</B>
<BR><B>I want to say that I never did drugs when I was 14 and I don't use
drugs,</B>
<BR><B>not even asprin, today. I also do not drink.&nbsp; So, I can't find
an</B>
<BR><B>explaination in that, wish I could. . .in a way. Here it goes. .One
night</B>
<BR><B>when I was 14 I was lying in bed wide awake when I began to see
these moving</B>
<BR><B>colors around me, mostly deep red and dark green. At first I tried
to</B>
<BR><B>dismiss it by thinking that I was having a visual hallucination
of some</B>
<BR><B>sort, remember I was NOT on drugs! Then the colors began to collect
together</B>
<BR><B>and started to move in a spiral above and around me. It became very
intense</B>
<BR><B>and no matter what I did or how I tried to dismiss it, it would
not go away.</B>
<BR><B>The odd part is that I was never afraid, I just wanted this moving
spiral to</B>
<BR><B>go away.&nbsp; Finally, it took on a solid-type form and I could
not see anything</B>
<BR><B>else but this stupid spiral.&nbsp; Like in the first story I told
you, I had that</B>
<BR><B>sense that someone wanted me to follow it to it's world.&nbsp; I
can't really</B>
<BR><B>describe this without sounding incredibly wacko, so I will tell
it like it</B>
<BR><B>was.&nbsp; I knew at that moment that I could enter this spiral
and leave this</B>
<BR><B>world that I lived in. I remember having this strong urge to go
inside of</B>
<BR><B>it. In a way, I wanted to out of curiosity.&nbsp; But when I had
that thought,</B>
<BR><B>the red colors in the spiral grew stronger and deeper and I knew
then that</B>
<BR><B>whatever was calling me was not going to take me anywhere pleasant.
At this</B>
<BR><B>thought, it went away instantly, as if it were never there.</B>
<BR><B>I know that my stories are not typical ghost stories, but they are
very real</B>
<BR><B>and very true.&nbsp; I have always, like my sister, been very sensitive
to the</B>
<BR><B>paranormal. Her experiences have been much like my own. I know that
between</B>
<BR><B>the ages of 14 and 20 that someone or something was trying to call
me to it.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; If anyone out ther has ever heard or been through anything
similar to what</B>
<BR><B>I have experienced PLEASE let me know.&nbsp; One last thing, these
"callings"</B>
<BR><B>began after me and my sister had spent three months obsessed with
the Ouija</B>
<BR><B>board. Maybe that explains something . . .</B>

<P><B>My Story a Ghost Dog</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>First of all&nbsp; let me introduce myself.&nbsp; I am a scholar
and an atheist and never had a "weird"&nbsp; experience or anything related
to supernatural, however, I am open minded about phaeonomena of the kind,
if there is convincing evidence.&nbsp; In short, I am not a believer, but
I WANT to believe.</B>
<BR><B>.&nbsp; This is my father's story.&nbsp; He told me only once, when
I was a teenager, and I remember he was very puzzled of the memory. He
added after he finished the narration that he still, to this day, he could
not explain what he saw. He is also an atheist, a counrtyside boy who fought
in Europe during WWII ( I mean he has slept in snowy mountains, has seen
dead, dismembered bodies&nbsp;&nbsp; and the like, hostile "shadows" in
forests, and THAT is really scarey!). He later&nbsp; got educated but never
lost his relationship with nature.&nbsp; IN the late 1950's he was in their
family house&nbsp; on a mountain, together with a bunch of friends. They
were out hunting in the forests and were using the old house as their "base".
The story is not a cliche, I mean&nbsp; no ladies in cloacks, near cemeteries,&nbsp;
people who wake up in the middle of teh night only to "sense a presence"
near them, etc. This is the reason I believe it is quite reliable.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The company of hunters slept in the house during
the first night and woke up early next morning, had breakfast and prepared
their gear, guns and everything to go out hunting.&nbsp; My father went
down, in the ground floor to open the front door.&nbsp; Remember now, my
father is in a familiar place (his house), at dawn, quite excited, with
a bunch of close friends, fully awake, had had breakfast, dressed and probably
with a shotgun&nbsp; on his shoulder. As soon as he opened the door, he
saw what he described a huge black dog, the size of a bull, blocking his
way out. He froze at the sight, but he noticed that the gigantic dog backed
and let my fater walk past him.&nbsp; My Dad indeed walked an inch away
from the huge dog.&nbsp; The dog looked friendly.&nbsp; Astonished as he
was, my father got back into the house and called the rest of the hunters
to come out and see the huge dog or something weird.&nbsp; Indeed, everybody&nbsp;
ran down the staircase, my father opened the door, but ...... the dog was
not there anymore!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My father told the story only once.&nbsp; He
was probably embarrassed to let us believe that he ever saw a creature&nbsp;
like this or that he was imaniging things.&nbsp; He was positively absolutely
certain that he saw the gigantic dog a foot away from his face, or he would
not share his experience. Mind you that he is a country boy and he can
still tell a bird from teh way it flies.&nbsp; There are no cattle in these
snowy mountains&nbsp; of Southern Europe, only goats and sheep.&nbsp; It
seems there is no way he could have been mistaken.&nbsp; I can rule out
the possibility that the apparition was a bear which was mistaken for a
dog.&nbsp; There are no bears in this part of the world. He actually saw
a huge but friendly dog in front of him!</B>
<BR><B>Does the story have an ecological message?&nbsp; I mean a huge dog
blocking a hunter from going out and shoot at wild rabbits and partridges?&nbsp;
I don;t know, but when I think of it....... The dog behaved a lot like
a daemon-guard.&nbsp; It is of course a very modern approach. I don;t think
there were such sensitivities back in teh 40's or 50's.&nbsp; Nature was
still rich in wildlife, and countyside people had little for entertainment,
remember there were no video games backthen!</B>

<BR><B>Mine Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ledlin99@juno.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I write this true story
on a rainy Oregon day.&nbsp; I've always been</B>
<BR><B>a kinda' ghost buff and my parents house is haunted.&nbsp; Pennies
fall from</B>
<BR><B>the ceiling, someone pull on your shirt, ect.&nbsp; I never really
felt</B>
<BR><B>"alone" in that house and I could never sleep with my door open.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>always felt that something was out in the hallway.&nbsp; Anyway
hears my real</B>
<BR><B>story:&nbsp; Me and a bunch of my friends decided to go up to the
Bohemia</B>
<BR><B>Saddle(an indentation in the mountain range and old mining area).&nbsp;
It was</B>
<BR><B>kinda' dark when we got up there, but it was OK cause' we were a
"bunch</B>
<BR><B>of brave men".&nbsp; We whipped out our flashlights and headed into
a nearby</B>
<BR><B>mine shaft.&nbsp; We were having a good ole' time yelling and listening
to our</B>
<BR><B>echoes.&nbsp; Well the ground was kind of muddy and one of my pals
said "Hey</B>
<BR><B>check this out!".&nbsp; So we all went over there and in the mud
was one boot</B>
<BR><B>print.&nbsp; Just one.&nbsp; We thought that was a tad strange since
we were all</B>
<BR><B>wearing tennis shoes.&nbsp; It was then we heard the foot steps.&nbsp;
They were</B>
<BR><B>echoing in the mine shaft so we couldn't tell where it was coming
from.</B>
<BR><B>We franticly shined our flashlights around.&nbsp; The footsteps
stopped.&nbsp; So</B>
<BR><B>we quickly walked out of the mine back to the car.&nbsp; We got
in, and of</B>
<BR><B>course the car wouldn't start.&nbsp; Now hears where it gets scary.&nbsp;
The road</B>
<BR><B>is basicaly a cliff that winds up the mountain.&nbsp; SOMETHING
STARTED</B>
<BR><B>PUSHING THE CAR NEAR THE CLIFF.&nbsp; Of course we were close to
loosing</B>
<BR><B>control of our bodily functions.&nbsp; Finally the car roared to
life and we</B>
<BR><B>prrled out of there.&nbsp; We were pretty shaken and drove to my
friends</B>
<BR><B>place(it was the closest).&nbsp; We all got out of the car and calmed
down in</B>
<BR><B>his house.&nbsp; Well we went out to the car to go home and on the
trunk of</B>
<BR><B>the car were two muddy handprints!</B>

<P><B>Marna</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: marniee8@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My grandmother-Marna-raised her 10 children in a three-story, wood-frame,
victorian home, in greenwich, ct.&nbsp; when she died, the house was sold.&nbsp;
the new owners renovated the home.&nbsp; one of my grandmother's daughters
and her daughters went to see the renovations--they were surprised--not
only with the renovations--but, also, with ghost stories that the new owner's
told.&nbsp; as they described incidents, it became clear that the ghost
was our grandmother!!! they described her perfectly--now, years later,
subsequent owner's have their own stories--at least one of which includes
a description of my grandmother (who lived to 97).&nbsp; my husband and
i visited a friend in greenwich for a weekend.&nbsp; we ate breakfast in
a diner before heading back to massachusetts.&nbsp; as i was complaining
that the french toast had fake grill lines on it and was a funny color,
i became overwhelmed with the smell of 4711--my grandmother's perfume!!&nbsp;
i was in an old chevy truck that routinely carried dogs, manure, plants,
carpentry items--it's usual smell was musty--my cousins are sure that my
grandmother was letting me know she was there--i know it is possible that
my subconscious was working on the ghost stories and conjured one up for
me---however, i prefer to believe that marna came by to say hello!&nbsp;
(i would tell her other stories, but they are only hearsay--there are some
very convincing ones, though--and in light of my experience---i believe
she is still in the house that was her life)</B>

<BR><B>I ain't Afraid of no ghost!</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: trip@mrtc.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello, my name is Robert Triplett.&nbsp; I don't think there is any
need to</B>
<BR><B>be ashamed of ghost sightings.&nbsp; This indicates that anyone
who sights a</B>
<BR><B>ghost is a goof.&nbsp; Not true.&nbsp; I can give a rats rear end
if anyone</B>
<BR><B>believed my story.&nbsp; So far, there are four people that I know
of who</B>
<BR><B>have seen what I have seen.&nbsp; The latest was the door to the
second floor</B>
<BR><B>slamming and then opening right back to where it was.&nbsp; Then
later, I</B>
<BR><B>heard some rustling around from a room on the second floor.&nbsp;
I thought</B>
<BR><B>it was my mom, but apparently she was on the back porch.&nbsp; That
was the</B>
<BR><B>lesser events.&nbsp; We've seen an old woman walking around the
house on many</B>
<BR><B>occasions.&nbsp; One time when I seen her on our back porch, which
is closed</B>
<BR><B>in, I thought it was my mother.&nbsp; As I walked past I began talking
to</B>
<BR><B>her, as I said thinking it was my mother.&nbsp; When I asked a question
and</B>
<BR><B>she didn't answer I glanced into the doorway.&nbsp; She wasn't there.&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>lady was wearing a black dress with a gold pattern.&nbsp; I stepped
out onto</B>
<BR><B>the back porch and there was my mother outside feeding the birds.&nbsp;
She</B>
<BR><B>wasn't wearing black at all.&nbsp; She was wearing a white sweat
shirt and</B>
<BR><B>green sweat pants.&nbsp; Another incident occurred later while I
was going</B>
<BR><B>upstairs to bed.&nbsp; I've grown so used to the constant visitations
I</B>
<BR><B>nicknamed them my ghosties.&nbsp; Each night, as I passed the bedroom
next to</B>
<BR><B>mine, I'd always greet my ghosties.&nbsp; Well one night I said,
"Hello</B>
<BR><B>ghosties".&nbsp; You know what?&nbsp; They answered!&nbsp; They
started whispering as</B>
<BR><B>if they were in the doorway.&nbsp; Now that made the hair stand
on the back</B>
<BR><B>of my neck.&nbsp; After that I went to bed, fell asleep and had
a great</B>
<BR><B>nights sleep.&nbsp; Our house is over 100 years old.&nbsp; Many
viewings were held</B>
<BR><B>here.&nbsp; As far as I know they are all friends and welcome.&nbsp;
You get a</B>
<BR><B>sense of family and friends.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>"Grim Reaper" foretells death in family</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: JCATWOMAN64@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>On Saturday, December 29,2001, I was working as usual.&nbsp; I was
passing out</B>
<BR><B>mail in the Taunton Post Office in the Industrial Park.&nbsp; I
turned the A-frame</B>
<BR><B>utility cart, and out of the corner of my eye, I saw the tall figure
of a</B>
<BR><B>male standing behind me.&nbsp; At first, I actually swerved to avoid
collision</B>
<BR><B>with this "figure" then my conscious mind questioned who could be
standing</B>
<BR><B>behind me.&nbsp; So I turned my head to see what or who was behind
me, and of</B>
<BR><B>course, there was no one there.</B>
<BR><B>I finished passing out the trays of mail and ran to tell my friend
that I'd</B>
<BR><B>seen a ghost.&nbsp; I told her it was only visible from the corner
of my eye, and</B>
<BR><B>that it was a tall male figure, with some sort of dark cloak falling</B>
<BR><B>knee-length.&nbsp; I got the distinctive feeling it was a grim reaper
type of</B>
<BR><B>ghost, and that someone in my family would die.&nbsp; She dismissed
this notion,</B>
<BR><B>although she believed I'd seen something.</B>
<BR><B>On Friday, January 4, 2002, I got a phone call from my mother.&nbsp;
My</B>
<BR><B>grandfather had past away the night before. The time frame from
the sighting</B>
<BR><B>of the ghostly figure and the actual death of my grandfather was
5 days.</B><B></B>

my boyfriend if he moved it and he said no. eve day something like that
would happen. then finally one day I stayed home from work and I heard
foot steps coming up the stairs and then the door to my apartment blew
open. I got up and closed the door and I feel asleep on the couch and when
I woke up I waz in my bed room. my boyfriend hadn't come home at all that
day. I waz just walking around my kitchen and I turned around and there
waz this man standing behind me dressed in white and had jet black hair.
I just saw him for a split second. I kept on seeing that man out of the
corner of my eye and one day my mother came over for thanksgiving and she
gave me a picture of my father( who passed away) when he waz about 35.
and it looked like the man that I have been seeing. well you see, I never
got the chance to get to know my dad,so I think this is his way of saying
hi to me. well that is my story.</B>

<BR><B>Ghosts where I used to live</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Grey94Ranger@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>When I was younger, probably from 14 until I was 15 or 16, we lived
in a</B>
<BR><B>house where I'm not sure if I had ghosts, or a bunch of demons.
I never saw a</B>
<BR><B>human figure, but there were plenty of other things to lead me to
believe we</B>
<BR><B>were haunted. There were lots of things that happened in that house
to make</B>
<BR><B>me think it was haunted, but I can't remember a lot of it. When
I was in</B>
<BR><B>school, I met a girl who practiced Satanism with her older brother.
I started</B>
<BR><B>to practice with them. A couple months after I started, I had another
friend</B>
<BR><B>stay over for the night (she didn't know I practiced Satanism).
We stayed in</B>
<BR><B>my room in the basement that night. The next morning, she asked
me if I had</B>
<BR><B>seen anything weird the night before. I said no, and she told me
that early</B>
<BR><B>in the morning, she woke up and saw in the room across from mine,
two red</B>
<BR><B>"eyes" about 6 inches off the ground. She said she woke up a couple
times</B>
<BR><B>during the night and watched them walk back in forth in front of
the door.</B>
<BR><B>She believed in ghosts and told me my house was haunted. This was
the first</B>
<BR><B>experience with anything strange. I started noticing little things
in my</B>
<BR><B>bedroom here and there like objects that were moved, areas that
were cold,</B>
<BR><B>and just feelings of being watched. Once when I was listening to
my cds down</B>
<BR><B>in my room, my little sister said that her radio suddenly started
playing the</B>
<BR><B>song I was listening to. She was listening to a radio station, and
I was</B>
<BR><B>listening to a cd that wasn't played EVER on the radio. She got
scared and</B>
<BR><B>told my mom, who at the time was very religious and was pretty angry
at me</B>
<BR><B>for "bringing scary things into the house." But I was never scared
of</B>
<BR><B>anything going on in the house until about a year later, when I
started</B>
<BR><B>hearing voices call my name, started seeing the ghost of my cat
that died in</B>
<BR><B>the house, and started feeling her jump onto my bed and lay down
when there</B>
<BR><B>was nothing there. My two cats that I had at the time were very
perceptive to</B>
<BR><B>any activity, and half the time they would know something was in
the room way</B>
<BR><B>before I would. A couple of incidents that made me totally sure
something was</B>
<BR><B>in the house was when things started to move in my presence. Doors
would open</B>
<BR><B>and close while I watched, and I would see tall black spots move
out of the</B>
<BR><B>corner of my eye. One Saturday, my mom was in the stairwell painting
the</B>
<BR><B>walls right in front of my bedroom door (nobody else was home) when
she says</B>
<BR><B>she heard voices yelling at her to get out of my room. She said
not only did</B>
<BR><B>they yell at her, they also started picking objects up in my room
and</B>
<BR><B>throwing them at her on the ladder. About 2 months after that, we
moved</B>
<BR><B>because she was so afraid of the house, she wouldn't go into the
basement</B>
<BR><B>alone. After we moved, I stopped practicing Satanism, but I still
am afraid</B>
<BR><B>to be alone in the house I now live in, just because I let my mind
get the</B>
<BR><B>best of me!</B>

<P><B>Small Ranch</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was born and raised in a small rancher in pennsauken with an attic
that was converted to a bedroom, shared the one room with my two other
brothers. When nightfall came, I became very uneasy as if I wasn't alone.
At times I was so frightened that I slept with my covers over my head.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; One summer night I awoke from a sound sleep to hear
a pleasant lullaby being sung so softly-I could not resist from not looking
out from under my covers in which I saw a full floating figure of a woman
in a flowing dress admiring my six month old brother in his crib. I quickly
pulled the sheets back over my head and prayed that it would stop. I fell
asleep to awake to my mother looking very puzzled and telling me that she
smelled a strange perfume that she doesn't wear. I told her what I had
seen and told me it was my imagination. I experienced numerous feelings
of hands touching my bed and pushing down on my mattress, starting at the
bottom of my bed and coming closer to me. Things did not get better when
we moved to marlton and a nicer house. I began hearing voices of someone
calling my name. My bedroom door remained locked all of the time. I was
too scared to investigate. At one time the voices were so loud I couldn't
help but to call out to my younger brother-"did you hear that?" and he
would say "yes". Then I asked him to go out in the hall and see what it
was. He said "no way".</B>
<BR><B>Three months had gone by and no more noises or voices. My brother
was sick with the flu and my mom asked me if my brother called out in the
middle of the night to help him. During that night I heard a voice call
my name. I crossed through the hallway to my brothers room and he was asleep.
I turned to leave the room and the vision that was over my baby brothers
crib in our old house, was eye to eye to me in the hallway. It wanted to
get a clear look at me. I was frozen and I felt as if we stared at one
another for a couple of minutes. The figure slowly began to fade and disappear.
I was fifteen years old and that was my last ghostly encounter until I
was 39 when I moved back in my old house after my divorce.</B>
<BR><B>My grandfather who lived in the in-law suite had a stroke and passed
away. I helped my mother in her daily chores and one of them was cleaning.
I was cleaning my grandfathers bedroom when out of the corner of my eye
a shadow passed&nbsp; behind me and the hair on the back of my neck stood
up. Then re-occurring noises of drawers opening and closing by themselves
would be heard. My mother denied hearing them but I pointed them out to
her. It got to the point when the noises became the loudest,&nbsp; I would
enter the in-law suite and ask if someone wanted to talk to me. I was not
scared. But no answer. The noises were heard by my mother and her boyfriend.
At one time my mother entered my grandfathers bathroom and was greeted
by the sound of a man clearing his throat as if he was being disturbed.
It freaked my mom out and she dropped the towels she had in her hand. I
refrained from watching TV late at night downstairs because the noises
would get so loud I could not hear the TV and I would shut the TV down,
tell my grandfather that I was going to bed and everything would quiet
down.</B>
<BR><B>Shortly there after I met my soul mate and moved in to her house.
I still return every week to help my mom keep the house clean. My last
and final encounter was the weirdest. While dusting the dining room , from
the corner of my eye I saw the figure of a man sitting on the couch in
the living room. I turned to look, and our eyes met, I had to go around
a dining room table to enter the living room and he was gone. I thought
there was someone else in the house, I searched every where-but found no
one. I believe my mom's house is haunted by more than one entity, but now
my mom believes she does not live alone, and has made peace with her guests.
She feels they give the house character , and they are happy spirits.</B>
<BR><B>I hope you enjoyed my story and do not ask to investigate because
my mom doesn't take much to strangers in her house.</B>

<BR><B>created. I have always belived in ghost sence I was a little girl.
Well in</B>
<BR><B>the past 3 years my eyes have been opened to it more than ever.
I feel as if</B>
<BR><B>I am being watched alot and I belive i am. I talk on the quiji board
alot (if</B>
<BR><B>you belive in those, I do) and I talk to a boy named andrew well
me and him</B>
<BR><B>became close in the past 3 years and now I dont need the quiji board
to talk</B>
<BR><B>to him. I can talk to him through my head (sounds weird unless you
understand</B>
<BR><B>it, trust me im not crazy). Well I just wanted to tell you how great
your</B>
<BR><B>site was and share my little story. I also have another story, it's
a weird</B>
<BR><B>one. Me and my boyfriend wont let go of the pictures and I dont

<P><B>A Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: djhanks@bellsouth.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I&nbsp; just wanted to tell you about a ghost that my husband saw
a few years ago. There is a cemetary in Autaugaville AL . It is called
the Rocky Hill cemetary on the right on highway 14 going toward Selma from
Prattville. It is right out of the city limits&nbsp; passed the caution
light. My husband and four friends drove up into the cemetary one night
and sat there a minute with the headlights on and a ghost floated across
in front of the truck.&nbsp; All four people saw it&nbsp; , got scared,and
tore out of the cemetary. They have never been back. I would like to go
see it but he will never go back in there again. He said it looked red
with no face. I would like to go try to video tape it but i'm scared the
two police in&nbsp; autaugaville&nbsp; would catch and arrest me.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Ghost Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: summerland@sympatico.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>About four years ago, my wife and I at the time had bought our first</B>
<BR><B>home in Toronto, Ontario Canada.&nbsp; We were very excited with
our new home</B>
<BR><B>and our second child arriving in this world.&nbsp; The house was
a two storey</B>
<BR><B>structure.&nbsp; The second storey was just a single bedroom.&nbsp;
I imagined</B>
<BR><B>over the years that the attic of the house was converted to a bedroom.</B>
<BR><B>Within the first few months, I began to notice unusual events in
the</B>
<BR><B>house.</B>
<BR><B>My first experience was the sounds of foot steps late at night coming</B>
<BR><B>from the attic bedroom.&nbsp; My daughter had slept in this room.&nbsp;
I thought</B>
<BR><B>my daughter was walking in her bedroom.&nbsp; I would go upstairs
to tell her</B>
<BR><B>to go to sleep and to my surprise she was sound asleep.&nbsp; I
was perplexed</B>
<BR><B>by this.&nbsp; I know for a fact that she never experienced sleepwalking.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>also noticed that our cat disliked this room.</B>
<BR><B>Another incident I had with this house was when my wife and I noticed</B>
<BR><B>that we didn't close our exterior door properly.&nbsp; As I went
to the</B>
<BR><B>close, I felt this force from the other side of the door disallowing
me</B>
<BR><B>to close the door.&nbsp; My wife shrieked with horror.&nbsp; I managed
to regain</B>
<BR><B>control of the door to close it tightly.&nbsp; I looked outside
the window,</B>
<BR><B>thinking that someone was trying to gain entry to my house.&nbsp;
Needless to</B>
<BR><B>say, there was nobody there.&nbsp; I gave the benefit of doubt to
the wind.</B>
<BR><B>Although, we had a glass screen door before entering the house was
a</B>
<BR><B>second exterior door. I was afraid to tell my wife what was happening</B>
<BR><B>because a) she wouldn't believe me and b) she's neurotic.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, one morning I woke up.&nbsp; I had a late night at work.&nbsp;
My wife and</B>
<BR><B>daughter were out of the house.&nbsp; The house was a detached structure.&nbsp;
We</B>
<BR><B>were in the dogs days of winter.&nbsp; So, obviously the windows
were</B>
<BR><B>closed.&nbsp; The next thing I heard was running up the stairs,
a child's</B>
<BR><B>laughter and a loud distinct sound of a door slam.&nbsp; I was really
freaked</B>
<BR><B>out about this episode.&nbsp; I knew for certain that the house
was haunted.</B>
<BR><B>My wife and I decided to separate and sell the house.&nbsp; I was
now</B>
<BR><B>occupying the attic bedroom as a defiant stand to let whatever it
was</B>
<BR><B>know that it didn't drive me away from the house.</B>
<BR><B>Years later,&nbsp; I was looking over some pictures that I found
of the house</B>
<BR><B>and I noticed something strange from a photograph that I have no</B>
<BR><B>explanation of.&nbsp; It wasn't an orb.&nbsp; There was a large
red streak divide</B>
<BR><B>between myself and daughter.&nbsp; The photo was taken outdoors
facing the</B>
<BR><B>house.&nbsp; Even to this day, I still have a reminder of a photograph
of</B>
<BR><B>unusual events in that house.&nbsp; I searched over hundreds of
pictures I</B>
<BR><B>photographed with this camera and could not find that same red streaked</B>
<BR><B>on any pictures.</B>

<BR><B>Hotel Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: justice311@home.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This was not my first encounter with the supernatural but this one
was more vivid and nerveracking.&nbsp; I am 17 and I have always beleived
in ghosts and the supernatural.&nbsp; Around October 12, 2001, my parents
and I had to leave our apartment for a few days in order for it to be exterminated.&nbsp;
So the three of us had to stay at a hotel near Mission Valley.&nbsp; I
believe it was called the Comfort Inn.&nbsp; On the first day, we all left
to eat dinner and run a few errands.&nbsp; Before we drove out of the parking
lot, my mom forgot her jacket and asked me to go up and get it for her.&nbsp;
So I went up to the third floor to retrieve the jacket.&nbsp; Our room
was near the end of the long hall and was about 20 ft. away from a window.&nbsp;
The sun was still high and the window was closed and locked.&nbsp; As I
moved closer to the window, I suddedly had the weirdest feeling that soemthing
was neer me.&nbsp; I thought that something would just appear right in
front of me.&nbsp; But mothing happened and I dismissed the idea.&nbsp;
So I entered the room, got the jacket and closed the door.&nbsp; I began
to walk back to the elevators.&nbsp; About six feet past the door was a
door that led into another room.&nbsp; Even though I was far away, I could
see the outline of a person about six feet tall.&nbsp; Suddenly, I became
very cold and a chill ran through my body.&nbsp; I turned around and saw
that the window and all doors around me were closed.&nbsp; As I walked
closer, I could see more of the figure.&nbsp; It was transluscent black
but seemed to not have a head.&nbsp; (I only saw a vague outline of one.)&nbsp;
The figure had it's "back" to me and it was standing at and angle.&nbsp;
The two arms were stretched out and the hands were holding onto the doorknob.&nbsp;
It was violently shaking like it needed to open the door.&nbsp; I tried
to rationally coem up with a solution:&nbsp; "Mabey, my shadow was being
projected onto the door."&nbsp; However, I was about 25 feet away.&nbsp;
Even so, I stoped moving entirely.&nbsp; The figure did so as well.&nbsp;
However, this did not last long and the figure began to move and shake.&nbsp;
I began to walk faster and faster to the elevator.&nbsp; The only thing
moving through my mind was "OmyGodOmyGod....."&nbsp; I began to run.&nbsp;
The figure continued to move.&nbsp; I stopped about seven feet away from
the apaprition.&nbsp; It stopped moving and turned to look at me like it
was suddenly aware of my presence.&nbsp; One of its arms dropepd away from
the door.&nbsp; Seeing this, I ran as fast as I could to the elevator,
covering up my face with the jacket.&nbsp; I jumped into the elevator&nbsp;
and faced the corner.&nbsp; The doors closed and I ran to my parent's car.&nbsp;
My mother then hinted at how pale my face was.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Grandpa</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: wrighdav@attbi.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Before my grandpa died he was a very healthy 82 year old man,&nbsp;
he was my best friend in the whole world. I always spent time with him
every chance I got also. Well one day he fell and hurt his hip or something
like that and he went to the hospital. This hospital also has a old folks
home on the other side of it, where my grandma was at. He was there for
a while then they released him. My aunt, who is a retired nurse, came to
stay with him for a while to help him get back on his feet.</B>
<BR><B>Well about two weeks after his first fall my grandpa got up out
of his chair to go to the bathroom, my aunt offered to help him but my
grandpa was to stubborn and refused her help, and he fell again. This time
he was rushed to the hospital and things were getting worse for him. He
started to get sick while he was there and things progressively got worse.
I remember driving out to see him and when I got there they were taking
him in to do tests. I remember him with tubes coming out every where and
he being drugged and out of it, reached over and grabbed my hand without
looking around first, giving me a squeeze. Even though he couldn't speak,
I knew that every thing was going to be ok.</B>
<BR><B>About a week later I received a call from my dad and he told me
that they decided to take him off life support and let him not suffer any
more. So I went to the hospital, which was a 45 minute drive from where
I lived at that time. I remember never being sad but very happy and peaceful
for some reason. when I got to the hospital I went to his room. I need
to add that they took him off about an hour before I got there and the
doctor said that he would pass away within a few minutes. As I walked in
and saw my aunt and uncle stand up out of there chairs. I looked at his
heart monitor and it was barely beeping. when I got to the foot of his
bed and grabbed a hold of his foot he then passed away. He waited for me
to be there before he left.</B>
<BR><B>I then ran to the other side of the hospital where my dad was, comforting
my grandma, as I walked up to him he said," I know." My grandma, who was
suffering from Alzheimer's, was in a wonderful mood until he passed away.
Then it was like she hit a brick wall and was very sad.</B>
<BR><B>The ghost part of this story is this: later that night when the
nurse was putting my grandma to bed, the nurse said that my grandma was
looking at the end of her bed and said, "He looks good in white." The nurse
asked her what she was talking about and my grandma said, "Elmer looks
good in white." as she was pointing at the end of her bed. The nurse could
not see anyone there but said that she could feel very strongly the presence
of my grandpa.</B>
<BR><B>I love sharing this experience with people, every time I do I can
feel my grandpa close by.</B>

<P><B>My Parents Ghost Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: primordialslime@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have been reading through a lot of your stories and thought that
I would</B>
<BR><B>share one with you too.&nbsp; It's not my own story but my mum and
dad's, and</B>
<BR><B>happened before they got married in approximately 1967.</B>
<BR><B>My mum's side of the family used to live in Salisbury, in England,
and</B>
<BR><B>stayed in an old stone farmhouse called Tied Cottage.&nbsp; This
farmhouse was</B>
<BR><B>adjoined by a barn, a tractor shed and a small cottage, and my mum
thinks</B>
<BR><B>that the farmhouse is about 200 - 300 years old at the least.&nbsp;
Otherwise,</B>
<BR><B>the place was surrounded by farmland.&nbsp; One evening, my mum
and dad had come</B>
<BR><B>round to visit my grandma while the other occupants of the house
were out</B>
<BR><B>for the evening (these being my two uncles, Barry &amp; Jeff).</B>
<BR><B>My mum, dad and grandma were all watching TV and around 22h30, they
heard</B>
<BR><B>the front door open and then slam, and the sound of someone racing
up the</B>
<BR><B>stairs towards the bedrooms.&nbsp; My mum said that the sound was
not like that</B>
<BR><B>of a lady or child walking up, but more like a large man (or someone
bulky)</B>
<BR><B>stomping up.&nbsp; They assumed that it was one of my uncles returning
from his</B>
<BR><B>evening out.&nbsp; My dad decided to put the kettle on, and shouted
up from the</B>
<BR><B>bottom of the stairs, "Barry, do you want tea or cocoa?"</B>
<BR><B>There was no answer so he called up again, and again he got no answer.&nbsp;
So</B>
<BR><B>he went upstairs to see who it was, only to find that there was
no one up</B>
<BR><B>there at all and the entire upper floor was deserted.&nbsp; All
the windows were</B>
<BR><B>still locked from the inside, and upon returning to the front door,
he found</B>
<BR><B>that this was bolted and locked from the inside too.&nbsp; My mum,
dad and</B>
<BR><B>grandma were a little shocked, as they had all heard someone distinctly</B>
<BR><B>coming in and running up the stairs.</B>
<BR><B>When my uncle returned later, they asked him if he had come home
at all and</B>
<BR><B>he said that he had not.&nbsp; I have often asked my mum whether
she thought it</B>
<BR><B>was a ghost running up the stairs, and she told me that she thinks
it must</B>
<BR><B>have been, as there was no other logical explanation that could
explain the</B>
<BR><B>loud stomping.&nbsp; They never experienced any other "ghostly"
happenings prior</B>
<BR><B>to or after that incident.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Leaping 8ft Fence</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: spoons_rules@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was about 8 years old and my two friends who were cousins,
each 8years old, we were swinging on the elementary school swings during
the winter on a weeknight. Were all having fun when out of nowhere this
person was running down the school field away from us and it ran towards
the fence that lined the school yard. At that moment we were all watching
in awe as this person just flew into the air and over the fence without
touching it, landed, then continued running which was towards the parking
lot of one of our many churches in town and disappeared. I asked each of
my friends if they had just seen what I had seen and they all agreed that
they saw a person running and jump over the fence. We all laughed cause
we thought it was funny but we were all kind of spooked that it (the person)
just disappeared after entering the parking lot. To this day I still remember
it happening and that was over 16 years ago.</B><B></B>

it. Well we was just talking then all of a sudden it was like I fell a
sleep. When I came to my friend was acting like she saw another ghost.When

<P><B>By: Angie.Kittleson@hartfordlife.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>About 2 years ago I worked for a cleaning company and 1 of the buildings
we cleaned was Fortis in Woodbury Minnesota.&nbsp; I was in charge of vacuuming
and changing trash. One of my co-workers, Sam, who cleaned the bathroom,
didn't come to work one Friday.&nbsp; I was going to help him out and clean
the bathrooms but I figured he'd be in before Monday he knew what he had
to do.&nbsp; Monday came and still no word from Sam.&nbsp; I went to the
basement to gather the supplies needed to clean bathrooms.&nbsp; I didn't
start bathrooms til late that Monday night, I was behind with my other
work.&nbsp; I started on 5th floor and work my way down, the building was
empty.&nbsp; I got to the 2nd floor men's bathroom when I heard something
coming from down the hallway.&nbsp; I walked out into the hallway, took
a good look up and down, nothing was there.&nbsp; I returned to my work
and again I heard something, but this time it was someone.&nbsp; I walked
back into the hallway to see if I could help this person.&nbsp; I heard
the door to the women's bathroom slowly swinging shut.&nbsp; I decided
to wait a few minutes for her to return to the hallway.&nbsp; While I was
waiting I was wrapping up the cord to my vacuum cleaner.&nbsp; 10 min.
soon went by and the lady never returned.&nbsp; I was getting ready to
leave so I went in there and she was pounding on the stall door.&nbsp;
I ran in as fast as i could and started pushed doors open, none of them
were locked.&nbsp; And there was no woman.&nbsp; I started to walk back
out slowly observing everything&nbsp; and just as I turned my body to exit
the bathroom the door flew shut and the stall doors started slamming open
and shut, open and shut.&nbsp; I was teriffied and there was nothing I
could do. I could still here the women screaming for help but as soon as
that bathroom door opened I was out and have never returned to that building
and I pity the people that go back day after day knowing what be roaming
the halls of 2nd floor.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>A Ghost Experience that Changed my Life</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tyia3@roadrunner.nf.net</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi there, I come to your site all
the time and I just wanted to tell you my story. I have had experiences
with weird occurances since I was about 8, the first ones were shadows
in a dim room when there was no one there to make it this happened all
my life in every house I lived in until I was 20 . I was a very unhappy
person for some reason and I never appreciated life no matter how hard
I tried. I started having really unusual dreams, I would dream I was in
a hospital and I was looking around and thinking that I had wasted my whole
life angry and worried. I remember my hands were old and i had a wedding
ring on with a diamond in it.I could see the mirror by the bathroom in
this peach colored room. Then i woke up. I had this dream of places I had
never been numerous times .I told my grand mother about it and she told
me my great- grandmother was in a peach colored room and that she had died
a very unhappy woman she had been angry her whole life and had told my
grand mother she had wished she could have changed her life. Then about
a year later my nan mentioned she had a old ring she had got from her mom
when she died and it was the ring that I had seen on my hand. So I have
changed my life and I am a happier person. I never had the dreams any more
but I&nbsp; still hear things unusul like a woman humming a song..I don't
know maybe this is a coinscidence but its very true.I forgot to ad that
my great-grandmother had died when I was around 7 thank you for listening
I know it sounds abit off the wall .</B>

there was no-one there {and Git always wore a cap} but there was a dog
at deans legs, and the weard thing was the same dog ran under Gits coffin
the knight he {GIT} was laid out in his brothers house and dean had to
move the dog. And the same dog just keeps hanging around were he and his
girlfriend died because they fell just yards from each other.But I know
now if any of my friends that passed away came back I wouldnt be afraid.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Reenactment of Murder</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Panther@townsqr.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>people call me crazy I do not care come see for your self.</B>
<BR><B>Heres my story.</B>
<BR><B>Let me start from the begaining I live in an old house dont know
how old it realy is but from what I have seen I would say about 1920 or
so, but anyways every 15th of each month about 12:00 am the story unfold
its self.</B>
<BR><B>Here goes how on to your seats.</B>
<BR><B>There is this family of three was living in my house (still does)
and the mother had just put the little girl to bed and she was waiting
for her husband to come home and then all of a suden there is this man
kicks the door in and shots the wife and rapes her and the little girl
come in to the room and sees this going on and the man grabes her and rapes
her amd shots her and then rapes her again and then the father walks in
and there is this shower af bults in the air lasts for about 10 to 15 min.
and the father drops and the bad part about it is if the man hears or sees
you he will hurt you too. I have lived in the house for about 3 months
and once I tried to stop it and her picked me up and throw me across the
room and he hits meas well.Why dont I leave you are probley acking your
self because they ghost family ask me to stay when this happens I leave
for the night or until its over.The family is very nice and wish for me
to stay.Sure once in a while I here bumps in the night and things come
up missing but if you talk to them they will return what they took mostly
is the little girl taking the stuff trying to get atencion, the little
girl was only about 5 years of age. The only bad thing is if they dont
like you they will let you know by scaring you half to death or taking
your things, with me living there I have to put the house the way they
want it or they will remove it or take them or it down.</B>

<P><B>Two dreams or not</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Moore9932@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I don't know if you would call this a haunting, a visit by the Angel
of Death or as I would describe him "the Grime reaper ."</B>
<BR><B>When I was about 25 years old I began having heart problems.Diagnoised
as tachycardia a rapid heart beat of unknown origin.</B>
<BR><B>At the time I had two small children and was married.</B>
<BR><B>It had been a normal day. The Children and my husband were sleeping
and I crawled into bed ready for a good nights sleep or so I thought.</B>
<BR><B>Soon after getting comfortable in bed the lights out and the house
quiet I was awakened by the uneasy feeling of someone watching me. I slept
facing the bedroom door which led to the hall way leading to the rest of
the bedrooms. Our children's bedroom was adjacent to our bedroom door and
visible from our room.</B>
<BR><B>When I opened my eyes I say a figure dressed in robes like a monk
would wear with the hoods standing in my girls bedroom door. His face was
not visible only a black black void. He was holding a black staff like
you us to cut wheat with. He was telling me without speaking that it was
my time and I had to go with him as he was sent for me.</B>
<BR><B>I was frozen stiff struggling to wake my husband but unable to move
or scream. I am sure I was awake and not dreaming.</B>
<BR><B>I verbally pleaded with this spirit that I couldn't go now as my
children were to young and needed me. I begged that there were to many
things I still needed to finish.</B>
<BR><B>He keep telling me it was my time and he needed to take me. Yet
he spoke no words. Yet I heard him clearly in my mind. Telling me over
and over again my children were to young and needed me.</B>
<BR><B>I could not move. I could not speak out loud, yet I pleaded with
him not to take me. I struggled to move to wake my husband lying next to
me but I could not do either.</B>
<BR><B>Finally I summoned up all my courage, it turned to anger and I began
to cuss at him telling him I was not going to allow him to take me. I was
going to stay with my children no matter what. He stood there staring at
me with the blackness where you knew there should have been a face.</B>
<BR><B>As quietly as he appeared he was gone.</B>
<BR><B>I was immediately able to move and to talk. I screamed and ran to
my children sleeping peacefully in their beds. I frightened and woke everyone
with my blood curdling scream.</B>
<BR><B>I quieted the children and put them in my bed with me as I didn't
want to be away from them. My husband instead it was just a dream. He convinced
me and I passed it off as just a dream too.</B>
<BR><B>For weeks I was afraid to go down the hall at night as I felt someone
watching me and an uneasy feeling when in the back of the house where the
bedrooms are.</B>
<BR><B>I had convinced myself it was a dream until a few weeks later when
my mother my sister and I were sitting at the kitchen table at my Mom's
house talking about things that had scared us in the past when out of nowhere
my mother told us detail by detail the exact same experience I had encountered
that night. She to had passed it off as a bad dream.</B>
<BR><B>I had never told her or anyone the story nor had my husband.</B>
<BR><B>We figured it out with a calendar and she had her experience the
same night I had mine.</B>
<BR><B>How can two people living in two separate homes have the same dream
on the same night?</B>
<BR><B>I am no longer convinced it was a dream but I am positive we were
both visited by the Grime Reaper and fought him off.</B>

<BR><B>The Stairs</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Suzalicious02@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>For the first five years of my life I lived a considerably happy
one, despite</B>
<BR><B>my parents just barley making ends meet, in a small Michigan town.
In order</B>
<BR><B>to pay the bills my parents purchased a large old fashioned farm
house</B>
<BR><B>complete with barn, etc., in which upon signing the paperwork for
it, they di</B>
<BR><B>scovered it had been semi-rebuilt in the late 1900's after a large
fire</B>
<BR><B>claimed much of the North side of it.</B>
<BR><B>I was born in the house and never really thought anything of the
occasional</B>
<BR><B>"strange feelings/senstaions" I had around certain areas of it;
I didn't know</B>
<BR><B>anything about paranormal activity and things like that...I just
wanted to</B>
<BR><B>play &amp; have fun.</B>
<BR><B>The place that I would begin having unignorable problems with, however,
was</B>
<BR><B>the large "L shaped" stairway that led to the bedrooms from the
living room.</B>
<BR><B>Because it was an "L shape" it had a landing (a small rectangle
where both</B>
<BR><B>portions of the stairway met). I always felt many strange feelings
throughout</B>
<BR><B>the South side of the house (the original part of it) and the stairway
was</B>
<BR><B>always the strongest of them. I had three separate instances in
which I fell</B>
<BR><B>down the stairs while no one was around, none seriously injuring
me, but</B>
<BR><B>after the 3rd one, at age 4, I refused 2 go up them anymore because
crazy as</B>
<BR><B>it may sound, I knew I was sent down them by some force. The bad
feeling I</B>
<BR><B>had about that landing area had seemed to have forced me down the
steps. For</B>
<BR><B>real!!!</B>
<BR><B>I had bedroom experiences that were so terrifying that I just like
to tell</B>
<BR><B>myself they were nightmares, though deep down I know they can't
be, but the</B>
<BR><B>worst experience I ever had came while my parents had moved into
a downstairs</B>
<BR><B>bedroom while their room was being remodeled and I had to go to
the bathroom</B>
<BR><B>during the night, which was downstairs as well. This left me with
no one to</B>
<BR><B>walk me down the stairs, but I knew if I ran fast enough nothing
bad would</B>
<BR><B>happen so I remember bits of pieces of going alone, returning, and
seeing it</B>
<BR><B>floating there on the landing, a big white blob with maybe a head-shaped
mist</B>
<BR><B>formation on it's top, but it wasn't very clear at all.</B>
<BR><B>That was the only time in my life besides a few of the bad "nightmares"
that</B>
<BR><B>I was paralyzed with fear...it's the worst feeling in the world,
you have no</B>
<BR><B>control. I wanted to talk to it but couldn't and at the same time
I wanted my</B>
<BR><B>Mom &amp; Dad but couldn't do anything, not even breath. I must
have stood there</B>
<BR><B>for 10 seconds, it looking at me, me looking at it, and then it
was gone, I</B>
<BR><B>don't remember how it disappeared.</B>
<BR><B>At the age of 5, needless to say, we moved out of that home, and
built a new</B>
<BR><B>one where I have not had one experience, or one "nightmare." I tried
putting</B>
<BR><B>my experiences in the past, not wanting to feel that I was crazy...until
my</B>
<BR><B>teens, at a family gathering, I was reminded of it all again when
the topic</B>
<BR><B>of paranormal activity came up.</B>
<BR><B>My mother told me the story of the fire, and that neighbors had
told them of</B>
<BR><B>the deaths that resulted in it, and that she, too, had seen a woman
floating</B>
<BR><B>about the landing, while going to the bathroom ON A HAND-FULL of
occasions,</B>
<BR><B>during the night (I don't remember it being a woman, just a white
mist/ghost</B>
<BR><B>w/a semi-head). She said when I came screaming to them describing
the same</B>
<BR><B>thing she'd seen, they had had just about enough of the house and
were</B>
<BR><B>financially stable by then, as well, to move out. I will never forgive
her</B>
<BR><B>for taking that long to tell me, and making me feel crazy all those
years,</B>
<BR><B>but I will never ever live in a home someone else has lived in.</B><B></B>

WE WERE LOOKING AT. AFTER A CIGARETTE OR TWO WE LEFT. AS WE WALKED FARTHER
INTO THE WOODS WE CAME APON WHAT LOOKED TO BE A OVER GROWN FIELD, UNTIL
I TRIPPED OVER SOMTHING. I GOT UP AND LOOKED DOWN TO SEE WHAT I HAD TRIPPED
OVER AND SAW IT TO BE A TWO HUNDRED YEAR OLD GRAVE. AS WE LOOKED AROUND
WE NOTICE WE HAD STUMBLED INTO A OLD GRAVE YARD. AGAIN BEING IDIOTS WE
WERE WE THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT. AS WE WERE WALKING BACK TO THE HOUSE I STOPPED
WALKING BUT EVEN AFTER I STOPPED WALKING I HEARD FOTTSTEPS. I TURNED AROUND,

<BR><B>Spirit Drives Car</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: dlopez@colliersb-k.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I have been reading your site and stories and I think I have one
of my own.&nbsp; This happen last weekend to me and when I told a co-worker
about it (she also reads your site) she said that I should summit my story.&nbsp;
So here goes.&nbsp; Last weekend after working diligently to clean my house
for Thanksgiving and the holidays, I finally got to sit down and rest.&nbsp;
My husband and son had gone to the store and I was in my house alone watching
a movie on TV.&nbsp; During a commercial I went into the kitchen for some
water and heard a noise that sounded like my sons remote control car driving
(anyone that has one knows that sound!) which he had been playing with
earlier and left it in the family room.&nbsp; When I went back the car
was not where it had been but about 3 feet away from the wall where it
had been parked and now in the middle of the room.&nbsp; Not really thinking
anything but thats kind of weird, I re-parked the car with the remote
by the wall and continued to watch my movie.&nbsp; Now it does get strange,
as I was sitting there, I watched the car move about 8" and stop and start
to move again backwards.&nbsp; I decided that the car must be picking up
the signal from the remote so I moved it so that it was not pointing at
it but away from it.&nbsp; After moving the remote, the car continued to
back up so I pick up the remote and held it to make sure that the trigger
on the remote was not moving.&nbsp; Nothing moved.&nbsp; Well now I was
sufficiently weirded out.&nbsp; So I started to talk with the spirit or
whatever it was that was at the wheel of the car.&nbsp; I went through
the names of family members who had passed, mother, father, stepfather
and brother.&nbsp; When I got to my brother the car at the time was not
moving and when I asked if it was my brother Mike, who passed away four
years ago, the car back up again and stopped.&nbsp; I asked again and again
it back up.&nbsp; So now I'm thinking that it is my brother and he was
trying to tell me something, so I asked if something was wrong with different
family members, each by name, no response.&nbsp; So I asked if he was still
here and the car backup into the wall with the tires still trying to turn.&nbsp;&nbsp;
So I pulled it away from the wall and again asked if he was there and it
moved so I continued to asked about family members thinking the he was
trying to tell me something (this being the first time something like this
had happen).&nbsp; No answer on my questions, so I said, "I guess that
you just wanted to say Hi", and the car moved.&nbsp; After awhile it stop
and I asked if he was here and got no answer though the car.&nbsp; I really
believe that my brother who I was very close to and always looked up to,
came by to say hello and to say "don't forget about me", when the family
is together for Thanksgiving.&nbsp; And I will be sure to include him in
our prays so he knows the I got the message.</B>
<BR><B>P.S.&nbsp; I have tried but the car hasnt moved since that day.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Sensitive</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:simpson@deskmedia.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I don't know where to begin. I guess it all started when My oldest
son who is now 2. We moved from Missouri to Minnesota when he was 10 months
old. There were 3 bedrooms upstairs and one down. We all slept upstairs.
Well every time I took him upstairs he would wave and smile real big and
say hi. I thought well he is just being silly doing baby things. Well it
has still continued since he was older. I will ask him who he is waving
too, and he says her right there mommy.</B>
<BR><B>Well now he has toys that you have to push and do not take batteries
that move all by themselves. Also the ones that you have to push to make
music go off all by themselves while we are sleeping at night. We are upstairs
and the toys are downstairs. Then just this Thanksgiving we were visiting
my mom and I had just put my baby in his crib to sleep. I went upstairs
to check on him and toys were going off like crazy making music. He was
only 7 months old and can't get out of the crib. I called my mom upstairs
to listen and it quit. Then I told her okay go downstairs now and she stayed
and it started again.</B>
<BR><B>My mom came for a visit to Minnesota. My son wanted to go and see
the geese. Well my mom wanted me to take pictures of him. When she gave
them to me. They is a white image you can see through at the bottom of
one and then right in middle of the next one. None of the other pictures
have this on them. What is going one???</B>
<BR><B>Then just this Christmas we were all downstairs with my whole family
there and the door to the laundry room shut all by it self.</B>
<BR><B>When I am upstairs at night I can hear people talking downstairs.
I have all sorts of minor things that happen to me everyday. What could
this be??? I could type stories forever to you. This ghost if that's what
it is follows me where ever I go!!!</B>

<P><B>Our house in Alexandria, Va.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:tofujoe@vision1mm.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From 1976-1978, we lived in a brick home at 428
East Lurray ave. near</B>
<BR><B>George Washington Senior high School in Alexandria Va. I was 14
years old at</B>
<BR><B>the time. This house was haunted by a ghost of a woman with short
dark hair,</B>
<BR><B>probably in her forties. She died in the basement from a fall down
the</B>
<BR><B>stairs from what I was told, foul play was&nbsp; not ruled out.
She laid there</B>
<BR><B>for hours while her children stepped over her body thinking "Mom
had too</B>
<BR><B>much to drink again, she'll wake up soon."</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my dreams at night, it was a hot summer day,
Dad was downstairs,</B>
<BR><B>taking a shower in the basement and called up for me to bring him
a towel.</B>
<BR><B>(We always took showers in the basement in the summer, because it
was alot</B>
<BR><B>cooler down there.) I opened the door and looking down at the bottom
of the</B>
<BR><B>stairs was this lady sitting in the dark on the stairs. She turned
around</B>
<BR><B>and smiled at me, one of those really scary smiles, like "You're
next" or</B>
<BR><B>something to that effect. I'd always wake up after that.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the evenings, when it was in the heat of summer,
My Father and Mother</B>
<BR><B>and I would sit out on the front porch and try to cool off. More
than once,</B>
<BR><B>we'd hear an upstairs door slam so hard, you'd swear it shook the
house! It</B>
<BR><B>was a calm summer night, no wind. We'd go in the house and check
to find all</B>
<BR><B>the doors to all the rooms wide open. The reason I know the woman's</B>
<BR><B>description so well, is because our neighbor next door was showing
us her</B>
<BR><B>scrap book and I recognized her photo. I asked who she was and I
said</B>
<BR><B>"That's the lady in the dream I always have!"</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Father and I used to hunt all the time. I
was in the basement lots of</B>
<BR><B>times, reloading shotgun shells and for no reason at all, the light
would go</B>
<BR><B>out and I'd be there in the dark! I would nearly tear the door off
the</B>
<BR><B>hinges when I got to the top of those stairs! My Father used to
be an</B>
<BR><B>electrician, he checked the light for shorts, there were none. Once
I felt a</B>
<BR><B>hand brush my ankle as I was in a mad-sprint up those stairs, near
the</B>
<BR><B>bottom.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It all came to a head one night as we were moving
out. My Mother stayed</B>
<BR><B>in Va. and Dad and I were already in Ca., settling into our new
home, while</B>
<BR><B>Mom stayed behind and closed the deal on the house and packed up
furniture</B>
<BR><B>for shipping out to Ca. There were only 2 pieces of furniture left
in the</B>
<BR><B>living room. A chair that Mom had re-upholstered for my cousin Ron
and a</B>
<BR><B>fold-out coffee table, that was it. Mom was turning off all the
lights and</B>
<BR><B>walking up stairs to turn in for the night. She could make her way
through</B>
<BR><B>the living room alright, because the streetlight had shown through
the</B>
<BR><B>window across the living room floor. As she neared the bottom of
the</B>
<BR><B>staircase, she was flipped upside down, her head going for the sharp
corner</B>
<BR><B>of the folding table on the way to the floor! She told me it was
like</B>
<BR><B>someone had done a judo flip to her! She got up and turned on the
lights and</B>
<BR><B>everything was still in it's place. The chair was the type that
reclines and</B>
<BR><B>swivels around. It hadn't been moved at all.It's a good thing Mom
moved her</B>
<BR><B>head at the last second.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other things that happened were voices like a
couple of people having a</B>
<BR><B>conversation in the other room, we all heard that alot. The personal
most</B>
<BR><B>freaked-out experience that I had was when I was awakened by a light
right</B>
<BR><B>in my face one night. I was in the smallest room in the house (and
the</B>
<BR><B>warmest in the winter time) This room was on the 2nd floor at the
top of the</B>
<BR><B>stairs. I woke up and there was like a twisting, burning ball of
light</B>
<BR><B>inches in front of my face. At first I thought it was a flashlight.
but it</B>
<BR><B>wasn't. I swung my hand at it and it moved back and went through
the wall</B>
<BR><B>into my sister's room. I spent the rest of the night staying awake
and</B>
<BR><B>reading with the light on. I told Mom and Dad about it and all of
us agreed</B>
<BR><B>it was a ghost.</B>
