Hello everyone this story happened to my dad years ago but he told me
not to long ago. Well many years ago my dad use to work th grave yard
shift so he would go to work from 10pm to 4am. He is not a big believer
in the supernatural and he is one of of those guys that put on a strong
man vibe. What happened to him that&nbsp; really scared the daylights
out of him was that he work getting out of work one night and to get to
were we used to live you have to pass a avenge size cemetry. His truck
never gave him any problems beforeor after tha happened but while
driving along the cemetry something strange happened is truck turned
off by itself. He tried turning it on but it wouldnt. But the weird
thing about that was he kept on moving and when it pass the cemetry it
turned on by itself. My dad who also fixes cars check the truck over
and over again and found nothing wrong with it everything was fine. He
never was so scared like he was that night in is whole life and never
as he was that cemetry ever again.<br>

I will start with my time on Guam. Once my wife and I moved into our
house on Guam we set up the rooms, my son got his own and we picked one
right next to his. After we set up and finally got situated, we got
this feeling from on our sons room, like somebody or something just
wanting us out of that part of the house. So being normal adults we
just ignored everything. But our son would not want to be left in the
room, kind of like he was in pain or being scared, but once we left the
room he would relax and return to his normal 3 month self. Anytime we
would be in his room the feeling came back I would pass it off as new
house gotta get used to it, I never got used to it neither did my wife
or son. The presence in the corner of the room started to take over his
whole room. Anytime we would walk past the room from any direction the
feeling would come back kind of daring us to confront it. Finally we
got orders to leave. And we were happy to get off the island. Fast
forward and we get our house in New Jersey, my wife is at her moms
house, it&#8217;s me and my son in the new house.&nbsp; I get the house set
up. We had a baby a couple months be for we left the island so she gets
her own room with the same crib from Guam. The first night my son and I
finally get to relax we here a sound like boxes shifting and scrapings
on the floor, my son looks at me and says uh oh, so I brush it off as
something fell from a box. When I go up to the 2nd floor room I open
the door (right across the door is a window) and in the reflection is
me and a bald guy that is smiling. I shut the door and thought it was
my imagination, so I opened it again to make sure and there was of
course nothing there it freaked me out. I went back downstairs to shake
it off and as I sat back on the couch I saw in the reflection of the
entertainment center glass door the same bald guy just sitting on the
stairs looking like he wanted to come down and hang out. Well I shut my
eyes and opened them again and he disappeared. Later on down tour time
in the house my kids started complaining of a bald guy walking in their
rooms scaring them making them wake up. They come to us wanting the
bald mean guy to leave them alone. So I told them if he comes back and
scares them too tell him to go away and leave them alone. So I woke up
one night to the kids yelling go away we don&#8217;t like you and that was
the last of the bald guy scaring the kids. But I think that was the
time I boxed up the crib from Guam and got rid of it.<br>

Darker Than Night<br>

My parents bought a house on the south side of Lubbock TX I don&#8217;t know
how old the house was but I know in my bones that it has a history
because my brother and I were always kind aware of the feeling you get
when your in the back rooms, you just don&#8217;t feel comfortable at all. My
very first haunting experience wasn&#8217;t very scary things would fall you
would here a noise not to loud, but one night when I was sleeping at
2:30 am I woke up feeling this high energy in the room I looked around
at everything noticing that buy my desk there was this black mass buy
the chair. I thought to myself what could it be I thought I left
something hanging on the chair but just a few seconds of staring at it,
it stood up, I mean you talk about a scary situation it was about my
size no features and black, darker than night itself as it jumped
towards me the adrenaline rush kicked in and I jumped from the bed to
the light switch and that&#8217;s quite a distance. I couldn&#8217;t believe it I
couldn&#8217;t sleep at all I would stay up as long as I could on school
weeks it was getting ridiculous this thing would appear in my room and
there was nothing I could do about it. Even while I was awake it would
hit the door making it shake if I was awake with the lights on and it
wasn&#8217;t the air conditioner it was a force like someone throwing a fist
at the door. I never had an experience like that ever since I left that
house but my dad does on occasion. He tried to make my room into his
extra bedroom on those loud snoring nights but he saw this thing the
first night. He was down praying on his knees when he turned around
with that feeling of being watched and this black mass was behind the
closet door and it dove under the bed that&#8217;s when he decide to make
that room into a study instead. I believe that shadow people do exist
after my experience who wouldn&#8217;t. There are many more stories to be
told but I&#8217;m glad to put this one out there and soooooo glad to be out
of that house.<br>

Evil Land<br>

I would say this is a story of a haunted house but it isn't! Until
about 10yrs ago it was just a haunted house in my book. I met my
husband over 30yrs ago. He told me about a house that he used to live
in that had some very strange things happen in it. It was local but he
never wanted to go anywhere near it. He said that it was very old and
had been built by a young groom who had some of the wood and granite
that made the fireplace sent from Ireland. Anyway The story is that
when he married his wife she came with her mother ( a real shrew).She
harped at him and distressed his wife to the point where he went mad
and killed them both, then ran screaming that the demons of the house
had made him do it. My husbands family moved into the house in the
early sixties During the years they lived there The heard doors closing
and footsteps on the stairs as well as the smell of coffee and frying
bacon in the middle of the night. His mother was quite a gardener but
could never get flowers to grow in the yard. He said the whole family
was quite uncomfortable in the home and eventually moved. We had been
together for a few years when we heard that the property had been sold
for a mini storage lot. We were talkin about it one evening with my
sister and some friends when my husband told the story the friends
asked to see the house. I had never seen it to this point and I'll
admit was more than a little bit curious. We finally talked him into
going and away we went. When we turned onto the street it was on I got
a really creepy feeling but when we pulled up to the house I was
terrified. There was not a living blade of grass or anything else on
that lot. We live in Washington State and this was March! The house was
dark and very ominous I refused to get out of the car so did my sister.
The guys (three of them including my husband) took a flashlight and
headed around to the back of the house to see what they could see.
After a few minutes we saw a flashlight on the second floor. A few
minutes later we saw the front door open but no-one came out. Afer a
few minutes more they returned to the car. We comented on the fact that
we had seen the light and they told us they had never turned it on!
Then we asked them wy they didn't come out the front door? They told us
it was locked and that they had tried it before going around back. I
was always skeptical about the stories connected with the house but
after they tore the house down the mini-storage was plagued by problems
and eventually went out of business. The property sits abandoned and
barren (still nothing lives there) and it's still as creepy as it was
years ago!<br>

Ghost Puppies<br>

Well here goes. My experience started late last fall. It started when
as I lay in my bed, I felt something walking, I didn't see anything,
nor did I feel anything other than the weight on the bed. At first I
was very scared, I didn't know what to think, I was afraid that it was
a spirit of a person or whatever. This went on for about 2 weeks off
and on. So I started to talk to this spirit, and started saying names,
of people.&nbsp; I got no response, and then I figured out that it had
to be a dog. The only dog that I actually had dealings with that died,
was my neices dog, named Astro. I called his name and he came to
me.&nbsp; This went for a couple of weeks, then one night as I was
laying bed something came and laid my lap, this freaked me out. I
called out the names of pets that I had, and low and behold it was my
cocker spaniel that i had when I lived in St. Charles MO. I did not
know how or when she died. I had her with me for about 5 or 6 years.
She is with me anytime I am in my bedroom.&nbsp; She comes over to my
chair, pawing at the chair, for me to go back and lay down on the bed.
LOL a week or so after Pepper came, there was another puppy. This time
it was my other cocker spaniel, that I had in MO. He stays on the bed
at all times, he never gets off the bed, nor does he go wherever the
other dogs go.&nbsp; I have no idea how these dogs found me. Last year
my girlfriends dog passed away, he was chow by the name of
Spanky.&nbsp; I never met this dog, and only saw a picture of him one
time, but; one night he came and joined our little pack.&nbsp; There is
next to my bed on and inside wall a place that is ice cold, this wall
should never be this cold and never was until Astro came. I don't know
what to think, or do with these puppies.&nbsp; They are with me always
as long as I am in my Bed room. I was a little upset, because at first
I was the only one that new they were here. But my girl friend came
over&nbsp; and laid on my bed, and nothing occured. Then as we sat on
the side of the bed, I told her to call Spanky, he was here dog for
over 10 years.&nbsp; When he came to her , her eyes opened wide. I
think she didn't really believe me at first.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now she is
encouraging me too find out what is going on, and why they are here.<br>
I know this may sound strange too some of you, but; it is real.&nbsp;
Thank you for your time and if anybody has any ideas please email me.<br>

Ghost Stories<br>
<br>
By: meera.moran@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Curiosity lead to unknown spirits following me home<br>
Up until the past few years, I became a true believer. I have always
felt that I had a special gift, where I could sense energy, esp waves,
and other sorts of things. I have had countless moments where I have
thought of something random that was about to happen, whether it was a
thought, feeling, song...whatever, but aside from that, I know that
there are several unexplained factors of this earth, such as life after
death. Many of us feel as though we know everything and are so easy to
dismiss that ghosts/energies/spirits exist. There is so much
outstanding proof that there has to be paranormal activity on this
earth we roam...along with the dead.<br>
Anyway, I have visited some "haunted" sites, and one of them is in my
hometown, and that's a whole different story. But this one time I went
to a place called, Dudley Street in Bedford Mass. Supposedly there were
nuns that practiced witchcraft there about 100 years ago. These nuns
were chased down by some guy who hung some of them and others slit
their throat. Legend has it, that there was a house deep in the woods
where these nuns practiced their witch craft. Ever since these nuns
murders, the house started sinking into the ground. The second floor of
the house is now at the ground level. The street begins very normal and
thickly settled with nice houses and fields, but as you keep going, the
road gets darker and narrower. As you keep going, you get this creepy
eerie feeling. Ever since I felt as though I was followed home with
that fear. I have seen a few strange things happen there, but not so
much until I got home.<br>
&nbsp;About two summers ago, I was relaxing in my room until I got this
overwhelmingly uneasy feeling. I knew I wasn't alone. I tried to ignore
this feeling and go to bed. Right when I was laying down *my bed faces
the window* I see this huge orb, the width of my fist, floating around
my window, then darting in through my room. Too big to be a fire fly. I
knew it wasn't a car. I knew it wasn't a reflection. I am not the type
of person to blow things out of proportion, I tried to debunk it but I
couldn't. I freaked out, after staying completely still in my room. <br>
&nbsp;A few nights later, it was about 3:00 am, and I felt this
coldness come over me. I suddenly woke up and I looked around my room,
then I looked at the corner of my room, and there was a tiny black
shadow hovering remotely. It wasn't a shadow of anything, because there
is nothing near that corner. I turned on the lights, of course nothing
was there. Then I switch the lights back off, and no more shadow. I
knew I was wide awake when I saw that shadow. <br>
Many times in the night, the room will originally be warm, but I will
feel something stroking my hair and a bitter coldness blow against my
skin.<br>
I have seen images in my mind and in my room of angry faces that
weren't just my imagination, just before I'm going to bed. I sometimes
hear very very soft voices conversing, I know it's a womans voices,
because I thought it was my mom, who was asleep. <br>
It was later when I found out that also according to legend, once you
visit Dudley Street, you feel as though you're followed home. This is
according to your website too. I didn't know that...but know it makes
sense. These occurrences are still happening today.<br>

Hi there..I used to live in Kahuku Hawaii. It's on the north shore of
Oahu. Growing up I have experience personal ghoslty activities in our
home.At night you could hear the sounds of drumming off in the
distance.Some would say it was night marchers. There would be knocking
on our home as if someone was running around it knocking on your siding
until it stops at the back door. Once there the sound get harder and
louder. We could also hear whisper outside of our window when someone
would check no one was there.our fencing would shake and shake.The
water faucet would turn on,the toilet would flush on its own. the front
door would open on it's own. Sometimes my daughter walker roll own its
own the music would turn on. We could never explain where or how these
noise would come from. Later the entities did not seemed friendly but
more sinister of some sort. My friends who lived nearby had similar
experiences in there home. <br>

my aunt owned this restraunt and we were always welcomed specially
since most of the costomers were just trailors since it was located in
belpre, kansas, very lonley place. that day she decided to do this
event for adults only, some sort of dance. so of course no kids around.
so we were send to her house.<br>
the houses there are like kinda far away from each other and very
hidden too, in between the few trees there are. so her house was big
and nice at her entrance door she had this big statue thing of the
virgin mary with canldes lit up all the time.<br>
i was around seven years old. it was my cousins my younger sisters and
i, we were around 10 kids in the house, with 3 "adults", they were just
my aunts who were around ther late teens. getting ready for the dance
in the restraunt so that meant they were all over the mirror in the
room. which was the only room with the light on, we didnt bother to
turn on the light of the living room because we got some light from the
room. we were all in a circle trying to figure out what to do since
were all too bored!! then suddenly we heard some foot steps coming from
the kitchen, which we could not see into cuz it was that dark plus the
entance was like a door size. we got so scared because it was that
loud. we all froze then my cousin who was a guys about the same age as
me at the time ran to my aunts to warn them some one was in the house.
they thought we were playing a game on them but checked anyway and the
steps get on going but only in the kitchen. they freaked!! more than
the kids there. one of them told me to reach in real quick to try to
reach for a knife, of course i said no then the same to my cousin but
he said no too. so she had no choice but to reach in herself as quick
as she could she reached for a knife while that was going one of my
other aunts went into her room for my uncles gun. all us kids were
right behind then since they were scared. then my aunt with the knife
in her hand said im gonna count to 3 and turn on the light to the
kitchen, which again meant to reach in quick.the footsteps never
stopped until the light went on. there was nothing, nobody. my aunts
were so scared they called my grandma and aunt to go pick us up. once
they got there us little kids started telling the grown ups what had
happened. they never believed us, they didnt even believe my aunts,
they got in trouble instead for grabbing the gun!!!!!!!! till this day
i renmber it so well. when i finally got a chance to tell this story to
ma grandma in a more personal place, she wantd to believe me but like
she didnt. she wanted me to stop the story so she told me that probably
it was my grandpa who wanted to visit us, since he had passed away in a
carr accident and never met any of his grandchildren. i guess ill never
know.<br>

Haunted House in Wisconsin<br>
<br>
By: pfatmama@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
When my sister divorced her husband about 12 years ago she had very
little money and two small children. She wanted to stay in the area she
lived in so when a big old house was offered for rent she took it. Over
the years things have happened in the house that can only be explained
as paranormal. <br>
The activity level increases in spring usually right around Easter. <br>
For example: <br>
One night while watching tv an oil lamp on top of the tv went flying
off of it. Both of the kids and my sister witnessed it.<br>
The dog: my sister has a rescue dog from the local animal shelter.
Sounder the beagle has some issues...one being you cant touch his back
near his tail. On many occasions he will stand in her dining room
looking into the kitchen and just bark. During one of those barking
sessions he spun around as if someone had smacked his hind quarters.
There was no one there.<br>
My niece, whom most of the activity revolves around: her room is a hot
spot. Things (especially coins) will go flying off of her dresser.
Noises...creepy feelings....all caused her on many occasions to leave
the room and go sleep in her mom's room. Recently, as of this past
Sunday, she was using a curling iron in the bathroom and the plug was
yanked out of the wall so hard she couldnt believe it. She plugged it
back in, proceded to go down the steps and as she approached the bottom
of the staircase a stack of plastic cups sitting on a little bar at the
base flew out across her path. She picked them up and put them back.
NOTE: her friends have been in the house when things happen....<br>
The cat: my sister found it in a corner, haunches up and spitting
/hissing ...no one or thing was there. <br>
The fiance: my sister's fiance was not a believer until right around
Christmas he had a travel alarm on a bedside stand and woke to see it
go flying off of the stand.<br>
Me: I've never seen anything move in the house and prior to knowing
about the activity when I'd go upstairs to use the bathroom have an
uneasy feeling like I'm being watched. I never venture down the
halll..thats right...never. I've never seen my sister's bedroom in her
house and only have been in my nieces room twice. The feeling is very
strong in the bathroom which is next to my neice's room. Another sister
has felt the same thing and all the years we'd go to visit neither one
of us ever said anything not wanting to sound like we were nuts. Our
experiences came out on a road trip...and when we talked we both felt
the same way about that area of the house. The feeling of something bad
is so overwhelming at the top of the steps by the bathroom I dont use
the bathroom unless it is absolutley necessary. Last Sunday after I
heard about what went on prior to me going over there I didnt go up to
use it even though I needed to do so. I drove 1 hour 45 minutes having
to go....home to use my bathroom. <br>
There is a room off the kitchen that has such an overwhelming bad
creepy feeling to it that my sister keeps the door closed and a table
in front of it. She doesnt use it, no one goes in it. <br>
There are alot of unexplainable noises like things falling and when you
check...everything is fine.<br>
The list goes on....<br>
My sister seems to think its the spirit of a little boy as no one has
ever been hurt and it seems to center around my niece. I dont tend to
think that way. I think its something bad.<br>
She is getting married and will be leaving that house this October. I
am happy and releived.<br>

Henry Ford - Dearborn Michigan<br>
<br>
By: katematsondesign@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Hello , My name is Kathryn. I have always wanted to share my story with
someone and I am pleased to find your web site. I always wondered why
no psychics have done any investigations on Henry Ford's Property in
Dearborn Michigan near Detroit.<br>
My story began when I was a very small child. Henry Ford owned many
farm homes. The people who lived and loved the and grew produce to feed
a hungry developing car industry.<br>
I was not born yet but my parents had 4 growing children. My late
Mother was searching for a dining room table. She saw an advertisement
in the Detroit News and went to a sale on Cherry Hill Road. The area at
the time was very rural. She approached the home which was run down and
hidden by trees and overgrowth.<br>
Once she got inside she discovered the home was for sale. It was one of
Henry Fords farm homes. My parents purchased the home and moved in.<br>
Well in 1958 I came along. The youngest of 5 children and late in my
parents life. The house was very eerie. It was a 5 bedroom rambling
home on 9 acres.&nbsp; This home was always know as the Haunted House
On Cherry Hill Road. <br>
Ever since I can recall I have had the gift along with many other
members of my family. I was second generation of northern Europeans. My
Aunt's had the sight even through devote Catholics.<br>
Being very small a huge old house can seem overwhelming to a small
child. I recall laying in bed and watch what is known as shadow people
now walk around my room and down the long hall.<br>
There was a passageway that circled all the upstairs bedrooms. Having
older brothers they stored a lot of there toys and such inside the
passages where I would play at times. I know this was not a dream as it
was in the afternoon. I was under there and all of a sudden many dolls
started to talk to me. One was a clown which was evil. I ran
screaming.. <br>
As I grew I discovered that the woman who lived in the house in the
period that Henry Ford was alive hung herself in our massive kitchen.<br>
Over all the years I lived there , many family and friends would see
her throughout the home. You always had the feeling you were being
watched. In the basement was a well . I never liked the basement at
all. <br>
When I was a teenager , I was the only one left at home so I had my
choice of bedrooms. I had a television and stereo comforts a lot of my
friends did not have. I can not tell you how many times at night when
my parents were asleep and I would be up watching a television show I
would wander downstairs to the kitchen to get a snack. I would have my
television on along with every light in the room including the hall.<br>
I would he heading up the stairs and here every thing I had left on was
off. I brought this to the attention to my Father who was a non
believer at the time. He found nothing.&nbsp; I would beg with whom
ever was there after a time to please not do this as It frightened me.<br>
The paranormal activity was consistent throughout the entire time I
lived there. Doors opening and closing before my eyes , specters
appearing in front of me. My Mother had many experiences also. None of
my friends would spend the night at my home.<br>
Upon graduating from High School , I was heading to New Mexico. Two
night's prior to my departure I went to bed as usual. I had heavy
antique furniture and a lot of it. It was on that thick shag carpet
that if you dragged anything on top of it you could see the lines.<br>
I woke up in the morning and to my shock ( that is an understatement)
here every piece of furniture was twisted , turned and pushed up
against the west wall , There were no lines at all.<br>
It was if every piece of furniture was lifted off the ground.<br>
I ran downstairs where my parents were having breakfast truly upset
yelling at my parents what a fighting joke to play on me. Now they were
the only one's in our home along with me and the remainder of my family
were well grown and had families of there own and did not live with us.<br>
My parents returned to my bedroom with me and their mouths dropped. I
never slept another night in that room again.<br>
It was apparent the ghost was upset at my leaving. <br>
My parents sold the home and the night prior to them moving further
north, my parents were in bed. My Father who was this non-believer<br>
was woken at 3:00 a.m.&nbsp; Here was a haggard woman sitting next to
him shaking his arm. Apparently he freaked out and jumped out of bed
never to sleep another night in that room.<br>
It was funny because this did not wake my Mother who was sound asleep.
He did not tell her of this experience until years later.<br>
I do believe strongly in ghost's. Over the years I have come to believe
that now that scientists have discovered our universe has dimensions <br>
then so do we on this planet.&nbsp; Maybe when we cross over we go to a
different dimension. That is why we see events that have occurred in
the past. <br>
I now live in Redstone Colorado. A high mountain town that started as a
mining community. The place where all the marble for the monuments in
Washington D.C&nbsp; came from.&nbsp; We have a castle , a very old Inn
and a town which is so haunted.<br>
Not long ago , I was alone at a friends home and stood at the kitchen
sink. In the corner of my eye I saw a figure. I turned my head and here
was a full body apparition of a man walk from one end of the room right
through the wall. I know what I saw was real . I was clear minded. It
freaked me out for a short time but due to all my past experiences I
knew how to deal with it. I have had so many that I could go on and on.<br>
I believe and think we have the ability to hone in and fine tune our
gifts. As children we are open . Our minds are not all boggled up with
problems and disturbances. That is why when we are little we have more
experiences.<br>
Michigan has many haunted locations. In Northern Michigan you could be
walking through the forest and find an old dilapidated house left long
ago by it's owners,a long forgotten Indian cemetery .. There is a lot
of history as is all across the country.&nbsp; <br>
I have wanted to but have not dabbled with EVP's. We have a lot of very
old cemeteries in my location and this summer I plan to attempt some
work. I do not to try it in my home , just as a speaking board you can
invite the WRONG spirit into our homes. They can and will trick you in
believing they are someone they are not. <br>
I have also wondered why no physics have ever investigated some of the
Indian Ruins in Utah , Colorado, New Mexico and so on. I have been to
places off the grid in Utah which housed long gone tribes. I have
caught on camera orb's and strange faces on my digital camera.<br>
Well Thank you for anyone who reads these and a place to discuss our
experiences.&nbsp; <br>

Mudlick Hollow<br>
<br>
By: mazurheather@gmail.com <br>
<br>
&nbsp;I wanted to submit my experience with Mudlick Hollow in Brighton
Township, PA. My friends and I were out for a night of paranormal
investigating, we actually found out about this road from your sight.
We began the evening at Gretchen's Lock in Ohio, but after we finished
there we moved on to Mudlick Hollow. We drove all the way to the top of
the road just to scope out the area. We then came back down the road.
We were unsure of where the actual accident took place so we took
pictures all the way down the road. It was really easy the road never
gets any traffic, so we were able to travel at about 10 mph and snap
pictures all the way. Halfway down the road I was actually hanging out
the window trying to get better photos and I noticed two red eyes, come
to find out it was a possum. About eight feet of the road that followed
we were able to get great pictures of orbs. After the eight feet the
orbs just stopped and never reoccured again. We are very confident that
this is where the accident took place. It was very cool to us that the
story on your sight stated that the couples buggy was run off the road
by a small animal and we experienced the possum right before the orbs
began to show on the photos. Well thats all for our adventures for now,
but we are heading out this weekend to do investigating in Altoona at
wopsononock, fort roberdeau, and horseshoe curve. We are eager to see
what we can encounter, I will let you know what we find. We hope to
hear from you regarding our first findings. If you are interested in
photos please let us know they show the orbs very well. <br>

THIS TOOK PLACE IN 1972.&nbsp; I HAD BEEN IN A BAD RELATIONSHIP FOR
SEVERAL YEARS, TYPICAL STORY, I WAS 22 AND AFRAID TO STAND UP FOR
MYSELF, AND HOPING THE RELATIONSHIP WOULD DIE A NATURAL DEATH.&nbsp;
FINALLY, THINGS HAPPENED WHICH DROVE ME TO TAKE A STAND, WHICH TOOK
PLACE IN A CAR.&nbsp; WE WERE SITTING IN THE GUYS CAR A BLOCK FROM MY
WORK AT ABOUT 3 IN THE AFTERNOON.&nbsp; HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE GIVING ME
A RIDE TO WORK, BUT HAD STOPPED FOR SOME DRAMA ON THE WAY.&nbsp; I WAS
TELLING HIM THE RELATIONSHIP WAS OVER AND HE WAS TELLING ME HE WAS
GOING TO KILL ME.&nbsp; I SAID "GO AHEAD, IT WOULD BE BETTER BECAUSE I
JUST CANT LIVE LIKE THIS ANOTHER DAY,"&nbsp; WHEN BEHIND HIM ON THE
OUTSIDE OF THE CAR, SOMETHING BEGAN TO APPEAR.&nbsp; I WAS SITTING
AGAINST THE PASSENGER DOOR FACING HIM, AND HE WAS FACING ME WITH HIS
BACK AGAINST HIS DOOR.&nbsp; THE APPARITION LOOKED LIKE A CYLINDER OF
WHITE SMOKE,&nbsp; THE SMOKE WAS SWIRLING AROUND AND GETTING THICKER BY
THE SECOND, BUT NEVER FULLY MATERIALIZED.&nbsp; I KNEW IMMEDIATELY IT
WAS HIS MOTHER, AND WHEN I TOLD HIM HIS MOTHER WAS STANDING BEHIND HIM,
IT BEGAN TO DISAPPEAR, BUT IT HAD DONE THE JOB.&nbsp; HE WAS FREAKING
OUT, WITH EYES LIKE EGGS.&nbsp; THE THING IS, HIS FATHER HAD SHOT AND
KILLED HIS MOM WHILE SHE WAS WAITING TO CATCH A BUS TO WORK. HE WAS A
HORRIBLE CRAZY MAN WHO COULD NOT TRUST&nbsp; EXACTLY LIKE HIS
SON.&nbsp; ANYWAY, THATS WHAT HAPPENED, AND HE LEFT ME ALONE, AFTER HE
BLEW UP THE ENGINE IN MY CAR. THAT SEEMED TO MAKE HIM FEEL
BETTER.&nbsp; ALL THIS HAPPENED IN WINCHESTER VA.&nbsp; THE FATHER WHO
SHOT THE WIFE HAPPENED AT HANGING ROCK WEST VIRGINIA. SHE WAS STANDING
ALONG RT. 50 WAITING FOR THE GREYHOUND, AND HE WAS STANDING ON THE
PORCH OF HIS HOUSE ABOUT 100 YARD AWAY.&nbsp; HE USED A 22 RIFLE. HE

My Haunting<br>
<br>
By: sugar.junkee@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
It really hasn't been long since the strange happenings started, just a
few months. And it started with just simple things; insignificant stuff
-- items being found in places I did not put them, the DVD player my
grandfather left behind turning on and off as well as the TV. (These
incidents we just blew off as me being too tired to remember, since I
was taking care of my newborn twins, and we told ourselves that maybe
the TV and DVD players just had a timer). One day the DVD player turned
on by itself then turned off, I called it very creepy and scary and
after that it didn't happen again. One night, my son woke up around
three or four in the morning and I was so exhausted that I just turned
him on his back and propped the bottle up in the crib and laid back
down, waiting for him to cry to be put back on his stomach so he could
sleep when he was finished (which was very normal). I assume I drifted
off to sleep at some point and woke up the next morning around seven. I
jumped up and ran to his crib, expecting to see him sleeping on his
back without a blanket but found him on his stomach sleeping, blanket
tucked around him and the bottle beside him. I was completely freaked
out and wondered if I had gotten up without remembering but I knew
there was no way I could be standing up for the amount of time it
would've taken to rock him back to sleep without remembering it. I
asked my mother if she had come down but she said that she hadn't been
in my room. Though it was strange, I put the incident behind me and
went on with my life until a few weeks later I was washing clothes. I
left the clothes and went upstairs to go about my business and when I
went back to check on them, the washer door was wide open. It was
strange but I didn't think much of it until it happened again a week
later. Soon after I started noticing that my twins, specifically my
daughter, would smile and laugh at the ceiling when I put them on my
bed. They would baby talk and give huge smiles to nothing in particular
which was especially strange for my daughter because she only smiles at
the people she knows very well (we joke and say she's a baby with
attitude). The most recent experiences were the most confirming for me
though. My son has a musical toy that has a switch. You can either move
the switch from the off position to turn on the music, next is nature
sounds, and the last position is supposed to sound like a heartbeat.
When the sounds go off you can press either the "Next" or "Volume"
button to restart the sounds as long as it is not in the off position.
As usual I turned on his favorite nature sounds and rocked him to sleep
and went to lay down. I awoke a few minutes later to his semi crying
and&nbsp; I noticed the nature sounds fading to an end. I walked over
to his crib and pressed the button to restart the sounds... then I
pressed it again... and again. Nothing. I checked the switch and it was
in the off position, which I knew there was no way it could switch to
that position on it's own. <br>
Today I was smoking outside on the porch. I had used a candle lighter
instead of a cigarette lighter since mine wasn't working. After a few
minutes I felt something strange in my pocket and the next thing I knew
the candle lighter hit my hand and knocked the cigarette out of my
hand. I looked around for the cigarette everywhere but couldn't find it
anywhere. This is what ultimately made me decide to research hauntings
online.<br>
I don't really feel threatened right now, my guess would be that it's
my grandparents who just passed away only months apart last year right
before my twins were born. The DVD player was my grandfathers' before
he died and grandmother was a heavy smoker for most of her life and
ultimately died of what started out as cervical cancer that spread to
her liver. Everyone finds it odd that my grandmother and grandfather
passed away right before I had a twin boy and girl. Maybe they're
watching over me closer than I thought.<br>

State Hosptal House<br>
By: finch5000@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
This story takes place around the time I had my youngest son.
(2005)&nbsp; I was having financial issues and staying with some people
I knew.&nbsp; To give a little background, this house was about a block
away from an abandoned asylum.&nbsp; It was in row of huge beautiful
houses built for the doctors who worked there.&nbsp; I believe this
hospital was one of the largest in the state. It was several blocks
long, fully self supportive. It even had its own farm and power
plant.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the Traverse City State Hospital, if anyone wants to
look it up.&nbsp; <br>
Anyways, all of the buildings, including the Dr&#8217;s homes are connected
by underground tunnels.&nbsp; In the lowest level of the house I always
had a chilled feeling and later found out that was where the tunnel had
entered the house before it was closed off.&nbsp; It was also where the
dr who owned that house&#8217;s wife hung herself, so as he walked through
the tunnel to get home after work, he would find her body.&nbsp; I
didn&#8217;t know that stuff till after I began complaining about that
hallway.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to go through the hallway often to be able
to smoke outside on the patio.<br>
One night, after I had been there about 2 weeks, I was standing outside
smoking in the middle of the night, probably between 1 and 3am.&nbsp;
At first I was sitting in a plastic chair, but felt eerie.&nbsp; So I
got up and moved closer to the door.&nbsp; I was facing the building
and suddenly had this feeling like something was out there with
me.&nbsp; For some strange reason, I had this feeling and a thought
process telling me not to have my back to &#8220;it&#8221;..&nbsp; I really wanted
to finish my cig, so I stayed out there .&nbsp; <br>
The whole area was closed in by a wooden fence, with a large open
gate.&nbsp; I started walking toward the opening and suddenly I was
overcome by panic and fear.&nbsp; I started backing up, back to the
house with out turning my back to it. I felt like I being watched and
stalked, kind of like something was about to attack me.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then I&#8217;m not sure why, but I felt CHASED.&nbsp; I was either super
pregnant or had just given birth, so I was not supposed to be moving
fast, I remember.&nbsp; I through my cigarette and ran up two really
long flights of stairs.&nbsp; (this place was an enormous older home
from maybe 1850&#8217;s ish, gorgeous)&nbsp; To get from the bottom floor to
the 3rd floor, you had to go up the first flight of stairs and through
the house to the set going up to the next floor.&nbsp; Usually when
coming in I would actually stop on the main floor for a minute before
walking up the next flight of stairs.&nbsp; I probably have never moved
that fast.&nbsp; I ran in, up to my room, slammed the door behind me
and jumped up to the top bunk, covered up and put a pillow over my head
like a little kid.&nbsp; I felt this thing right behind me till I got
most of the way up the second flight of stairs. It was almost like I
could feel it touching me.&nbsp; I never saw anything, but it felt
&#8220;ugly&#8221;, whatever that means.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the best word in my vocabulary
to describe the feeling.&nbsp; I saw nothing, but for some reason kept
having visions of something evil, almost like a mix between a vicious
animal and something whitchey.&nbsp; I waited what seemed like an
eternity to take the pillow off my head.&nbsp; I rolled over to my side
to &#8220;watch the door&#8221;.&nbsp; Just as I looked at it, it popped
open.&nbsp; I stopped breathing, laid face down, replaced the pillow
and hoped for the best.&nbsp; <br>
Then I felt like it was gone a few seconds later.&nbsp; Like out of
nowhere I was safe or something.&nbsp; At that point I jumped out of
bed and switched on the light.&nbsp; I kept it on all night.&nbsp; My
arm hairs are standing up as I am writing this.&nbsp; I am not an
easily scared person and often take my kids &#8220;ghost hunting&#8221; and
whatnot.&nbsp; I get scared when I drive by this place.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t
feel like whatever this was, was associated with the house, but the
hospital grounds.&nbsp; I spend a lot of time exploring other parts of
the grounds and never experience anything more than the feeling of
being watched.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve heard some evil stories about that place,
true things from people who worked and visited there.&nbsp; <br>
Also, whenever I would bath my newborn in the upstairs bathroom, I&#8217;d
always feel really sad and have visions, like someone drowned a baby in
the bathtub.&nbsp; I always felt like someone was watching me through
the window when I would use that bathroom too.<br>

My Experience<br>
<br>
By: JCookJourn@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
My husband and I tried small town living for three years, moving into a
massive (3,400+ square feet) Queen Anne Victorian in Stillman Valley,
Illinois, 12 miles south of Rockford. We experienced numerous ghostly
encounters while there -- voices saying things like "mom?" and "stay."
There were also footsteps when no one was there. One night, my husband
and I heard very distinct footsteps coming up the grand staircase and
walking on the hard wood floor just outside the master bedroom door.
Neither of my step-children had gotten up, however. Both my husband and
I had extreme difficulties sleeping in that house, as did my dog who
later died. We would wake up between 3:00 and 4:00 am every night. One
night, my husband became extremely bothered when he felt an entity
trying to get into his brain. My husband does not spook easily, by the
way. <br>
I can provide more information upon request. FYI: The house is
currently on the market because we just couldn't stay there any longer.<br>

Haunted Place Pomona, Calif<br>
<br>
By: miakoda@charter.net<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Our family moved in this house in the 1960s (House built 1938 I
believe) <br>
Things that would happen is lights in certain rooms would go on and
off, water in the bathroom sink would turn on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Voices
heard in the attic above the garage.&nbsp; I last lived there from 2001
to 2002 to take care of my father before he passed away.&nbsp;&nbsp;
During that time while living there again there were voices that would
call name, or my roommates name...&nbsp; Every now and then it would
feel like someone was pulling the back of my hair, or blowing smoke in
my face...&nbsp;&nbsp; The light and the water thing still going on
too..&nbsp; One time when my mom and dad were watching TV a picture
from the shelf flew off the wall hit the front of the TV and landed
near my mother..&nbsp; (she had just said to my dad I guess our spooks
are gone now)&nbsp; There were lots of things but my folks never wanted
a bunch of people coming in to investigate things.&nbsp; I am not <br>
sure who owns the property now, as we have sold it when my dad passed
away.<br>
There is an apartment building next to the house and in the one apt
that faces my dads old house,&nbsp; 2 different people have hung
theirselves in the closet.<br>

Haunted Places<br>
<br>
By: MedSurgNurse67@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In our residence, we hear several noises at night.&nbsp; My husband use
to constantly wake up at night and step outside our bedroom door
because he heard what appeared to be footsteps in our hallway.&nbsp;
You can hear them pacing back and forth at night.&nbsp; We use to think
it was the house settling, but everynight?&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; I remember
as a teenager, I came home from a night out with my friends and my dad
asked me what I was doing.&nbsp; When I told him I just got home, he
thought I was lying, because he said he had heard me walking up and
down the hallway for a while.&nbsp; Apparently, before my parents died,
they heard the same noise in the hallway that we hear now.&nbsp; Also,
when I came home one night, I opened the front door into our livingroom
and saw a woman sitting in a chair in the corner of the room.&nbsp; It
was an apparition of a woman, dressed in the late 1800's or early
1900's clothing.&nbsp; She was wearing a gown and her hair was up in a
bun.&nbsp; She was sitting there rocking back and forth and
knitting.&nbsp; Freaked me out!&nbsp; My brother was asleep on the
floor and I kicked the crap out of him trying to wake him up, only for
him to not see what I had saw.&nbsp; Figures!&nbsp; Anyway, we hear the
noises EVERY night and they still creep me out.&nbsp; I won't go to the
restroom in the middle of the night unless my husband wakes up
first.&nbsp; I'm in my 40's now and no matter how much time passes, I
still can't get use to the footsteps. <br>

I live in South Pymatuning Twp. My home is built where an Indian
Village once stood.&nbsp; My daughter on our breezway walked into
someone, and there was no one there, but actually felt them bump
against her. <br>
My home always has someone walking in the rooms, if you go to the
cellar they are walking all through the house and I live alone now.<br>
I have found many arrow heads in my yard and found a stone head I
imagine used by a child that they prob. Had dressed and used as a doll.<br>
It is very haunted.<br>
I've grown used to the spirits now.<br>

Haunting at Fairfield University<br>
<br>
By: ryan.jillian@gmail.com <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I lived in Dolan Hall at Fairfield University in CT my freshman year
(2001-2002).&nbsp; One night, I was across the hall in a friend's room
when my dad called.&nbsp; My roommate came to give me the phone, and a
few minutes later we both went to go back into our room, but we were
locked out.&nbsp; This was impossible, because the doors are old and
you can only lock them by using a key from the outside.&nbsp; Once we
got an RA to let us back into the room, we heard strange gurgling
sounds, which ended up being the coffee maker.&nbsp; It was brewing hot
water right onto the bureau (there was no pot because we never used
it), and it was also unplugged.&nbsp; Our room was converted into an
office a year or two later.<br>
A few weeks later, two girls down the hall got locked inside their
room, and the fire department had to come to get them out.&nbsp; <br>
I also spent a night alone in Dolan Hall over spring break, but nothing
happened that night.&nbsp; Probably the bravest night of my life though!<br>

Plymouth, NH haunt<br>
<br>
By: hwelchsr@metrocast.net <br>
<br>
The location is on Smith Bridge Road out in West Plymouth.&nbsp; It is
haunted by a harmless man thought to be William, probably because there
is a tombstone in the cellar with that name on it.&nbsp; The cellar is
paved with tombstones though no one seems to know their point of
origin.&nbsp; They have been there at least since the 1930's.&nbsp; He
can be heard at night wandering the house and looking into rooms,
ostensibly to see that all is well.&nbsp; He has only been seen three
times.&nbsp; First time was when a woman was home alone, lying in bed
reading.&nbsp; She thought she heard something, lowered the book and
saw a man standing at the foot of the bed.&nbsp; She closed her eyes
for a few minutes and he disappeared.&nbsp; Second time was when a
seven year old child was in an upstairs bedroom talking to a man, then
came down and asked who he was.&nbsp; No one was found.&nbsp; Third
time was when a couple were sitting on a couch in the living room
talking and suddenly both of them saw a person in the dining
room.&nbsp; Moments later he disappeared.&nbsp; William has been known
to open or shut doors, rattle door latches (house had old fashioned
latches instead of door knobs) or simply to pace the floors and stairs
during the night.&nbsp; Family dogs would not go down into the cellar,
but would stand at the top of the stairs with raised hackles.&nbsp; The
house passed out of the hands of the family about 1976 and soon after,
the barn and attached ell burned to the ground.&nbsp; Only the house
was saved.</big><br>
