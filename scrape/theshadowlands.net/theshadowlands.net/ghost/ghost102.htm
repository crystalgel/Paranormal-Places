<P><B>By: Freebie136@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This story was told to me by a friend who lives in Coshocton County,
Ohio,</B>
<P><B>it concerns the haunting of graveyard in a very rural location. I am</B>
<P><B>originally from a neighboring county and i have lived in Florida for
the</B>
<P><B>last 26 years and met this friend while on vacation at Daytona Beach
6yrs.</B>
<P><B>ago and after discovering that we knew a lot of the same people and
land</B>
<P><B>marks a discussion came up about this graveyard. It is a very old
cemetary</B>
<P><B>with headstones way back to the mid1800's(I went there with my friend</B>
<P><B>several yrs. back on a trip back to my hometown)and most of the graves
are</B>
<P><B>from the Stockum family from that era in Coshocton County. It is
located</B>
<P><B>very far from any civilization in an extremely remote part of the
county,</B>
<P><B>and has been used as a party place for daring youths as the story or
legend</B>
<P><B>is widespread amoung the youth as well as oldsters that I talked to.
I</B>
<P><B>talked with people my age(baby boomer), my parents age, my grand
parents</B>
<P><B>age, present teens , and younger, and got the same general story. It
centers </B>
<P><B>around the supposed execution of a</B>
<P><B>woman named Mary Stockum for practicing witchcraft in the late 1800's
in</B>
<P><B>Coshocton County. She was supposedly be-headed and buried at the
location</B>
<P><B>with her head and torso in seperate graves, and she is seen at the
witching</B>
<P><B>hour looking for her head. This is the main theme of the story,
although</B>
<P><B>there is a plethera of individual stories of chilling proportions from
my</B>
<P><B>friends' experiences and many other people i talked to. Now the people
I</B>
<P><B>talked to would swear on any polygraph machine that what they told
me was</B>
<P><B>true, but the ironic thing is that a similar story from my home county
is</B>
<P><B>around about a warlock that was executed at around the same period
of time</B>
<P><B>and is buried in a remote cemetary in Tuscarawus County that I have
also</B>
<P><B>visited. Also decapitated with same burial and looking for his head
at</B>
<P><B>mid-night. Coincidence or the real deal????????</B>

<P><B>Majestic Theater</B>
<P>
<P><B>By Anonymous</B>
<P>
<P><B>I prefer to remain anonymous.  (The Majestic Theater is in Reading,
PA)</B>
<P><B>When I was in high school, a friend of mine was chummy with some of
the firefighters that ran</B>
<P><B>with the Mt. Penn Fire Company (whose quarters used to be next door
to the Majestic).  At any </B>
<P><B>rate, we cut school a few times to hang out with her friends at the
fire company, and at the </B>
<P><B>Majestic.</B>
<P><B>One day, while we were hanging out in the office adjacent to the
projectionists booth (this would</B>
<P><B>be one of the firefighters, my friend and I), there was a tremendous
THUD from the backstage area</B>
<P><B>We three went downstairs, and the firefighter went backstage to check.
 He came back a few </B>
<P><B>minutes later to inform us that the only thing that could have fallen
was a stack of boxes; said</B>
<P><B>stack of boxes was undisturbed.</B>
<P><B>Another time a bunch of us were hanging out downstairs shooting pool
and listening to music (the </B>
<P><B>turntable was located in the projection room upstairs) when suddenly
we were treated to the </B>
<P><B>horrible scratching sound of the tone arm dragging across the record.</B>
<P><B>Needless to say, we hauled ___ out of there very quickly.</B>
<P><B>I believe the Majestic is now a day care center, but a few years ago
it was a reception hall, </B>
<P><B>and a dear friend of mine had her wedding reception there a few years
ago.</B>
<P><B>Unfortunately, the guests were barred from visiting the balcony.</B>

<P><B>Castle In Canada</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: d.bear@mailcity.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Victoria, BC. Dunsmuir Castle. Built in the 1800s by the scion of a
local coal mining family who</B>
<P><B> were big in the early years of the province, it is an bulky, imposing
Victorian structure. The </B>
<P><B>coal and the family dwindled out, as they do, and the last surviving
member of the family was </B>
<P><B>the wife of the builder. She had had the misfortune of outliving her
offspring. Mrs. Dunsmuir </B>
<P><B>willed the building and the grounds to the Canadian government. For
many years, it was the site </B>
<P><B>of Royal Roads Military College. The "castle", as it was known, was
the lone surviving structure</B>
<P><B>from the Dunsmuir days; a series of nondescript concrete boxes were
erected to house the school</B>
<P><B>and the cadets. The castle became the administration building. The
fourth floor, where Mrs. </B>
<P><B>Dunsmuir had died in her room, was bricked off and remained unused.
The rest of the building was</B>
<P><B>divied up into offices. Being the military, everything was under lock
and key - except on those</B>
<P><B>evenings when Mrs. Dunsmuir was walking. There was word that a light
could be seen moving along</B>
<P><B>the windows on the fourth floor, and the next day, every lock in the
place would be open. It </B>
<P><B>became common to blame mislaid items on Mrs. Dunsmuir. The only living
sole in the place at night</B>
<P><B>was the duty officer, a senior cadet who spent the evening in a small
room on the ground floor,</B>
<P><B>with the responsibility rotating among the cadets. While working there
as a cook in the early </B>
<P><B>'80s, I asked one of the cadets what the policy was regarding the duty
officer and Mrs. Dunsmuir.</B>
<P><B>This young strapping military man looked at me and said, "You go into
that room and you don't </B>
<P><B>come out, no matter what."Royal Roads closed a few years ago. As I
have not lived in Victoria </B>
<P><B>for about 10 years, I am not sure what role the place has now.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Flood Town</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:  losgrappler@yahoo.com</B>
<P>
<P><B> Back when the St. Francis dam broke, the flood waters passed straight
through the small town of</B>
<P><B>Bardsdale (about 25 minutes east of Ventura) and from what I know,
most of the town was drowned</B>
<P><B>as it was right in the path of the flood.  Its almost all orchard now,
with maybe a hundred </B>
<P><B>houses spread around, but there are countless ghost stories involving
the church and several of </B>
<P><B>the houses and roads.  I myself have come across a couple of them.
The first being a huge figure</B>
<P><B>charging through the trees toward our car.  I didnt get a good look
at it, but my friend who was</B>
<P><B>in the car with me swears that it had red eyes.  I asked around, and
have found that its </B>
<P><B>supposedly a demon that roams the area, though im not so quick to buy
the demon bit, something </B>
<P><B>was certainly coming at us.  I hauled ass out of there.  My second
encounter was nowhere near as </B>
<P><B>sinister.  Another friend and I had pulled up at an intersection, and
in stopping, I noticed </B>
<P><B>movement to my left.  I turned to see a woman in all black with a shining
white face and hands.</B>
<P><B>I got no feeling of dread or horror from her, but an overwhelming sadness.
 I watched her until</B>
<P><B>she came within a few feet of the car before I lost my nerve and took
off.  There are hundreds </B>
<P><B>more stories about Fillmore, Piru, Bardsdale and the surrounding areas.
 Might be worth checking</B>
<P><B>out sometime, though- and I know this sounds hokey- I would not recommend
touring Bardsdale on </B>
<P><B>foot at night.  Its nice enough during the day, but at night there's
just too much bad energy, </B>
<P><B>especially during a new moon.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The Hotel Vendome</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: zodiac@uswest.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Prescott, Arizona.  Room 16 in the Hotel Vendome has had rumors of
hauntings for years.</B>
<P><B>Hearing of this, I visited the Vendome, rented the "haunted" room for
the night (with a friend),</B>
<P><B>and thus began my adventure.  Throughout the evening, we heard sounds
- like someone across the</B>
<P><B>hall was having a party - clinking glasses, the murmer of conversation.
 But, when we opened the</B>
<P><B>door to listen in the hall, the sounds stopped and all was quiet. 
We joked about the ghost and</B>
<P><B>were laughing when the pipes in the bathroom exploded with noise -
as if someone were banging on</B>
<P><B>the pipes with a sledgehammer.  At the same time, the temperature in
the room dropped about </B>
<P><B>10 degrees, at which point we fled the room, gathering our things quickly.
 I reached into the</B>
<P><B>closet to retrieve my bag and we ran down to the lobby.  Later, I told
my friend that I left </B>
<P><B>something hanging in the closet, as I was certain that I had seen something
hanging there when </B>
<P><B>I got my bag, but it didn't "register" until later.  I went back to
the room and checked, but </B>
<P><B>there was nothing there.  I'm still certain that I saw a dress or something
hanging in that </B>
<P><B>closet.  Later questioning revealed that many others had reported strange
phenomena in Room 16</B>
<P><B>- the crying of a cat, the image of a woman, the television and the
lights going on and off. </B>
<P><B>The front desk switchboard would often register that the phone line
from Room 16 was being used</B>
<P><B>when there was no guest in it.  Investigation turned up no evidence
of the phone being used,</B>
<P><B>but strange long distance charges would appear on the bill.  Guests
have been known to leave in</B>
<P><B>the middle of the night, have complained that the television won't
stay on the same channel or</B>
<P><B>keeps turning off, or the phone rings with no one on the other end.
A group of amateur researchers</B>
<P><B> supposedly contacted the ghost, who identified herself as "Abbey."
</B>
<P><B> I did some historical research in an attempt to identify the ghost,
but turned up nothing,</B>
<P><B> as many old records were missing and previous owners could not be
located.</B>

<P><B>Cemetary Experiences</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: anthrojim@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Wales, New York: Gutleburg Cemetery on Gutleburg Rd. The cemetery is
home to many victems of </B>
<P><B>illegal abortions (both mother and baby) from the turn of the century
and legend says that if a </B>
<P><B>visitor experiences three signs, something bad will happen to them;
hear a dog barking </B>
<P><B>(not unusual), hear train whistles (no train in the area), and see
strange glowing lights </B>
<P><B>floating in a farmers field across from the cemetery. Although I have
not experiences all of the </B>
<P><B>signs, I have seen the lights that appear where only corn grows. I
went back in the daylight to </B>
<P><B>investigate and saw nothing to explain them. I know people who have
broken bones in the cemetery</B>
<P><B>after experiencing the three signs and people who had strange mists
following their cars upon </B>
<P><B>leaving the cemetery. Others have seen faint glowing objects in trees
(seen by two different </B>
<P><B>people in two different parts of the cemetery) and two other Bozo's
experienced STRONG wind </B>
<P><B>gusts whenever they tried to use a Ouija Board on an otherwise calm
night. One strange thing </B>
<P><B>that did happen to me there was that and some friends and I were going
to meet there one night </B>
<P><B>at a certain time, we were there at that time but they weren't and
we waited a half an hour to </B>
<P><B>go in to the cemetery (which is very small, I have some pictures).
We finally went in and left </B>
<P><B>after fifteen minutes. The next day when we saw the friends that we
were supposed to meet, they </B>
<P><B>swear that they were waiting for us in front of the cemetery for a
half an hour at the time we </B>
<P><B>were supposed to meet. There is only one entrance and the cemetery
is only about 75 feet wide on </B>
<P><B>an old country road.</B>

<P><B>My Daddy Is there to Stay!</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: TweetieMAS@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I lived in Alabaster Alabama. I was raised there. before we moved there
a man hung his self in a</B>
<P><B> bedroom. so that makes one ghost. We moved there and my daddy got
killed in the house,so my </B>
<P><B>daddy is haunting the place, he will turn the radio to WZZK everytime
you try to listen to a </B>
<P><B>differant station. He has also replaces things. like me and my sister
was looking for a record </B>
<P><B>one time and we looked everywhere and it wasn't know where to be found,and
we looked around and </B>
<P><B>it was in the middle of the bed where he slept. My sister was giving
me my 13th birthday party,</B>
<P><B>and I had a crystal heart ring holder sitting on the dresser in my
bedroom. it flew up and hit my</B>
<P><B>bestfriend in the head. so anyway he never realy bothered us enough
to move. but the houser is </B>
<P><B>still haunted til today,and weird stuff keeps going on. Me and my mom
sold the house back in 1994.</B>
<P><B>and who ever moved in there I talked to them, and she was telling me
that window's keep opening </B>
<P><B>stuff keeps getting missed placed. So I told her about the ghost of
my daddy and she doesn't </B>
<P><B>believe in what I say, but she will find out sooner than later...</B>

<P><B>Scariest House I Ever Lived In!</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:  amy39_99</B>
<P>
<P><B>Jamesville Ave Syracuse Ny, First let me give you a little background
on the house.The house was </B>
<P><B>built on a family plot long before we even thought of buying the house.I
really am not sure why </B>
<P><B>that plot was picked but we had seen no reason to let that stand between
us and the ownership of</B>
<P><B> the house.The house we had bought was beautiful, it was a ranch style
house with the front door</B>
<P><B> facing a cemetry diagonal from our house. We found out later that
the house was positioned like</B>
<P><B> this as to disturb as few graves as possible. After learning that
I have come to the conclusion</B>
<P><B> that most of the graves around the house were simply left there as
to make the building of the </B>
<P><B>house less costly, well anyway an instance that will probably burn
on my brain forever would be </B>
<P><B>that of a Friday night. Me and my husband had just come home from dinner
and both our daughter </B>
<P><B>and teenage son were sleeping. We went through our normal nightly habits
and said good night to </B>
<P><B>our kids but when we reached our daughters room she was not there.
I panicked for a second but </B>
<P><B>was relieved when my husband found them both in my sons room wich was
downstairs in our basement.</B>
<P><B>I woke both of them up to ask why they were downstairs when I heard
the door at the top of our </B>
<P><B>stairs slam shut. I was startled for a minute but then realized my
husband was coming down the </B>
<P><B>stairs. I continued to ask if my children were ok. My daughter in an
obviouse panic told me of </B>
<P><B>a scary boy in wich case I was alarmed and imediatly awoke my son.
My son after helping me calm </B>
<P><B>down his sister went on to tell me that before he went to bed he locked
all the doors in the </B>
<P><B>house as he was instructed to do by my husband and I. He said that
as he was locking the back </B>
<P><B>door wich led into our garage when the front screen door slammed shut
repeatedly. He thought he </B>
<P><B>had left it open so he went to close it and it seemed to still be locked
and secure. He was on </B>
<P><B>his way downstaires again when he heard the door slam again. He said
that he then asked his sister to check and when she opened the door she said
there was a boy outside who complained he was cold. My daughter seeing no
threat let the little boy in to warm up. She then told my son what had happened.
My son said that he felt something was very wrong and when he went to investigate
the situation he said the the young boy had explained that he used to live
in the house and had led us to what he claimed used to be his room. The room
he had pointed to was the door next to our bathroom, wich for us was only
a storage area. My son said that he acted very nervouse in the room. My son
then asked if he wanted my son to walk him home. The child stated that he
wanted to stay my son decided it was ok for a little while. Later that evening
my son was ready to put my daughter and himself in bed so he asked the child
where his parents were. The child seemed to be ignoring him. My son then
asked where his house was and the young boy was seemingly irritated with
my son and ignored him again. My son then decided to call </B>
<P><B>around the neighborhood to see if anyone would know where this kid
lives. By the time he had </B>
<P><B>reached the phone my daughter ran up to him and said that because my
son made him mad that he </B>
<P><B>was playing with the lights. My son went into the room and said that
he froze in place. The </B>
<P><B>little boy was in the middle of the room as the lights flickered on
and off. My son then decided</B>
<P><B> to call the police to find his parents and as he reached the phone
the lights went off, the </B>
<P><B>door slammed and after a few seconds had passed the lights were back
on but the boy was gone. </B>
<P><B>After hearing this I ran up the stairs to get my husband but it felt
like something was pushing</B>
<P><B> on the door, after I had pushed my way through the door I had found
nothing on the otherside. </B>
<P><B>I told my husband about this and he said that it was my childrens
imagination and that calmed me</B>
<P><B> down a little bit. I later calmed down enogh to attempt to sleep and
went through our house and </B>
<P><B>locked all the doors. As I locked the front door I heard a noise behind
me and turned around. I </B>
<P><B>still cannot believe what I saw. There was a young boy standing between
my bedroom and my </B>
<P><B>daughters bedroom right in front of the storage room staring at me.
I screamed but when I opened</B>
<P><B> my eyes he was gone. After that we had alot of strange things happen
but not as intense. My </B>
<P><B>daughter swore she saw the little boy almost nightly and eventually
we deserted the house. After</B>
<P><B> moving to our present house my husband had recieved an envelope from
his lawyer which contained</B>
<P><B> an article about our house and explained how a man was paid to move
the graves from one plot of land to another but in the middle of the project
the man who was to move the graves had a financial dispute with the land
owner and decided to abandon the job. The paper went on to tell of what had
happened and then I felt a chill up my spine and started to cry. The bottom
of the paper went on to say that most of th!&lt;BR&gt;</B>
<P><B>e graves were removed but some still remained and discribed how the
man woked enough to move the</B>
<P><B> graves of mr. and mrs. Stien but had decided to stop work without
moving the body of thier 8</B>
<P><B> year old son Charles J Stien. We also found out that if the body was
still on the property it</B>
<P><B> would be directly underneath a wood stove that sat in our backyard.
I don't know if the house</B>
<P><B> is still standing but it was truley the scariest house I have ever
lived in. </B>

<P><B>The University of Idaho</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: youngc@ruralnetwork.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Many buildings on the campus are haunted. I used to work as a
Security</B>
<P><B>Guard at night, checking the dorms to make sure they were locked. Over
the</B>
<P><B>5 years I worked there I saw and heard many strange things. In Borah
Hall</B>
<P><B>on night I was walking down the hallway, from the other end a deep
moan</B>
<P><B>started, then came racing at me, I felt something pass around my body,
(It</B>
<P><B>felt like shaving cream does on your fingers, but it was cold.). The</B>
<P><B>moaning continued passed me, down the hall to the double doors where
I had</B>
<P><B>entered.  When it got to the double doors I heard a loud bang and the
moan</B>
<P><B>just stopped. I decided it was time to go back to the office for
awhile.</B>
<P><B>&gt;Another time I was walking up a flight of steps to the 4th floor
of an old</B>
<P><B>dorm. At the 2nd floor landing I could hear someone walking up the
stairs</B>
<P><B>behind me, the foot steps sounded like they were one floor below me,
but I</B>
<P><B>had not heard the door to the stair case open or close, and I know
that I</B>
<P><B>had not passed anyone on the stairs. I continued up the stairs, the</B>
<P><B>footsteps followed behind me, always one flight below. I decided that
I was</B>
<P><B>hearing the echo of my own foot steps, so when I got to the top floor</B>
<P><B>landing, I expected the echo to stop too. They did not. I heard the
foot</B>
<P><B>steps continue up the stairs. When the foot steps reached a landing
half</B>
<P><B>way between the 4th and 3rd floors I expected to see who had been
following</B>
<P><B>me, but there was no one there. The foot steps continued up towards
me for</B>
<P><B>about three or four steps, then ended.</B>
<P><B>Alot of stuff happened in the frat houses. I'll try to remember which</B>
<P><B>stories go with each house and pass it on later. I do remember that
Ed and</B>
<P><B>Lorain Warren stopped at the U of I one weekend and explored several</B>
<P><B>buildings and houses on the campus. In one of the frats a girl's cross
she</B>
<P><B>wore on her neck suddenly levitated away from her body and was held</B>
<P><B>motionless at the end of chain, it looked like someone was holding
it and</B>
<P><B>looking at the cross. The cross then fell back to her chest. She asked
a</B>
<P><B>couple of her friends to take her back to her room right after that.
The</B>
<P><B>local legend of the frat house was that it was haunted by the spirit
of a</B>
<P><B>brother who had died during spring break and had liked the house so
much he</B>
<P><B>had returned to it. Ed and his wife had the remaining people gather
in a</B>
<P><B>circle and concentrate on the energies in the room. Lorrain stated
after</B>
<P><B>awhile that whatever was in the basement was not the spirit of a
human</B>
<P><B>being, nor anything that had ever lived.</B>
<P>
<P><B>House In New Jersey</B>
<P>
<P><B>BY:  Lugnut7779@aol.com</B>
<P><B> I lived at this residence from1979-1990, from the time I was 7 years
old, till I was 18.  Too</B>
<P><B>many events occurred to list all of them, but a few significant ones
are:  at the age</B>
<P><B>of 9, my father had a friend over, and had sent me to my room, which
was in</B>
<P><B>the attic.  While the light was still on, and while saying my prayers,
I</B>
<P><B>heard a thumping noise from behind the wall.  The noise grew louder
and my</B>
<P><B>father yelled to me to get in bed and quit making all that noise. 
At that</B>
<P><B>time I yelled down that it wasn't me, that there was something behind
the</B>
<P><B>wall. At that time, the panel on the wall started violently banging
and</B>
<P><B>shaking off the wall.  My dad got frustrated and started coming up
the</B>
<P><B>steps, but before he got to the top of the steps, the panel came
completly</B>
<P><B>off the wall and hit the ground.  No sooner than it hit the ground,
it</B>
<P><B>sprang back up into place.  At that time, my dad had made it to the
top of</B>
<P><B>the steps and had started yelling at me, but then realized that I was
in bed and petrified. </B>
<P><B>I pointed to the panel in question, my dad pulled the panel off the
wall, which was still</B>
<P><B>nailed, and it revealed a small cubby, approximately 4x3, which had</B>
<P><B>apparently been previously used for storage, and was now covered by
the</B>
<P><B>panel.   On another occasion, I was awakened by a ghostly figure
which</B>
<P><B>appeared to be female with matted hair and a long white gown.  I
couldn't</B>
<P><B>see the face, only a sillouette.  I went downstairs and slept on the
couch.</B>
<P><B> I was 12 years old at this time.  The next morning I told my dad,
who</B>
<P><B>laughed at me and said he would start sleeping up in the attic.  About
a</B>
<P><B>week later, when I woke up, my mom came in holding a notebook behind
her</B>
<P><B>back.  She asked me if I could describe again what I had seen in the
attic.</B>
<P><B> At that time, she showed me a picture that she had drawn and I said,</B>
<P><B>"That's it!! How did you draw it??"  she then told me that that was
what my</B>
<P><B>father had seen in the attic that night and she had drawn it from his
description.  There are</B>
<P><B> many other small things that happened, T.V.'s and stereo's coming
on in the middle of the night</B>
<P><B> by themselves, a bird cage was unhooked from the ceiling and dropped
to the</B>
<P><B>ground while we were all asleep one night.  One night one of my
friends</B>
<P><B>were over and observed a bowl spinning in the middle of the table.
 In</B>
<P><B>1997, I went back to the house for a visit after living in Virginia,
I</B>
<P><B>spoke with the occupant who was reluctant to talk to me at first. 
After we</B>
<P><B>spoke for awhile and she realized that I had lived there and was
familiar</B>
<P><B>with the house, out of the blue, she asked me if anything strange had
ever</B>
<P><B>occured while I was living in the house.  I didn't go into great
detail,</B>
<P><B>because I didn't want to scare her, but she had mentioned about cold
spots</B>
<P><B>in the house, her feeling like she was being watched, and about lights
and</B>
<P><B>electrionical equipment coming on by themselves. </B>

<P><B>Road to the Convent</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Seterah</B>
<P>
<P><B>Well my friends were begging me to come down this road with them thats
near New Bedford MA</B>
<P><B>so, I'm like, ok what the heck... let's do it. So they're telling me
the story as we drive to </B>
<P><B>the road.  So it was about this nun, there's a convent on the road
and one of the nuns was raped,</B>
<P><B>so she thought she was unfaithful to God so she went and hung herself
on a tree.</B>
<P><B>Sso now, lots of weird things had happened to the convent. The Mary
statue outside the place, her</B>
<P><B>hands are cut off at the wrist not broken off... its as if someone
sawed them off,  or if she was made</B>
<P><B>with out them and when you drive past, she seems to turn her head and
watch you. So we drive </B>
<P><B>past the convent, and sure enough, she seemed to turn her head and
watch you pass. The convent</B>
<P><B>itself supposedly has had lots of hauntings, or crazy people running
around in it. So then you </B>
<P><B>go a little further down the road and theres a field and you can see
white figures moving through</B>
<P><B> it, looking for the raped nun and there is a father like guy with
a white balloon, and a fire </B>
<P><B>extinguisher (don't ask)  and one time they went down there, they saw
a fire extunguisher out on </B>
<P><B>the road, and the man with a balloon, but he wasnt there the night
we went. So you go further down</B>
<P><B>the road and you see these small boulders saying, in discoloration,
not paint or anything</B>
<P><B>"go back, the nun is dead" and then on the trees, there are more
discolorations like a black </B>
<P><B>square and one in the shape of a nun, with a white head, and a black
dress. Then you get to the</B>
<P><B> part where the nun actually hung herself so we pulled up under the
tree, and turned off </B>
<P><B>everything, and got really quiet and you're supposed to hear scratching
and thumping from when </B>
<P><B>she blew around in the wind, banging against the tree, and I'm telling
you I heard pounding and </B>
<P><B>it wasnt an internal sound, it was actually outside the car from the
tree. So then we got freaked</B>
<P><B>out, and drove furthur and there are some houses, and their cars are
behind chains, because at</B>
<P><B>night sometimes they roll out onto the road, and there isn't a hill.
Nothing could possibly move</B>
<P><B>them and sometimes they turn on and flash their lights. So we drive
past, they look normal, they</B>
<P><B>didn't do anything special, but they are behind the chains. Then we
get to a more residential </B>
<P><B>part, and the road is pretty much over but the weird thing is  the
road always is on a slight </B>
<P><B>turn to the right,but you don't end up east (because you drive up it
north) or south, and you </B>
<P><B>don't end up west Ii forget  but... anyhow when you get to the end
of the road (this is stupid)</B>
<P><B>if you turn around and drive back as fast as you can, you supposedly
go insane but you really </B>
<P><B>don't. They tried it once and they're *um* normal.... its a road to
New Bedford </B>
