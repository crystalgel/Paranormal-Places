<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Jefferson Hotel experience 3/25</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: robtahn@prodigy.net</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>In November 2006 my friend Patty asked if I
wanted to go to <st1:place w:st="on">Jefferson</st1:place> and stay at
the famous Jefferson Hotel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said yes,
then she tells me we're going on
November 19th and we're staying in their most haunted room, number 19.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>That scernio seemed creepy in itself!</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The <st1:place w:st="on">Jefferson</st1:place>
is as quaint
a small town as you'll find.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hotel
was no exception;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>reminded me of my
grandmother's house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Warm, cozy and
creaky.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We checked in, put our stuff in
our room and decided to take our cameras and see what we could find
while it
was still daylight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We chatted with the
owner of the Cypress Coffee House across the street about his
experiences and
he let us take pictures of him and his store.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We felt honored because he normally doesn't let anyone other
than the
folks on the ghost tour do that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We took
about three pictures and our cameras died - typical for ghost hunting.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>We took our cameras back to the room so they
could charge up
for the ghost tour that evening and then we were heading downstairs for
dinner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before we left Patty wanted to
see what kind of activity she could coax out of the room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I believe a woman is to have committed
suicide in the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Patty was asking
her to make the chandelier move, write on the mirror, make some noise.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>While standing there, we noticed the
temperature in the room kept going up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Curious, I checked the thermostat and the temp had increased to
6
degrees warmer than what the thermostat was set to.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So I turned off the heat. (each room has it's
own climate control).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even with
everything shut down, the temp continued to increase at a steady pace.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>At that point we decided it was a good idea
to leave the room and have<span style="">&nbsp; </span>dinner.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span>While waiting for
our
table in the hotel restaurant, we were chatting with the host.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We asked him to tell us some stories about
the hotel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We didn't tell him what room
we were in, but he proceeded to talk about room 19 first.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He said people had experienced noises,
smelled cigar smoke, the chandelier moving and temperature changes.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Patty and I looked at each other and busted
out laughing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The poor host had no idea
what was so funny until we told him what room we were in.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span>We did sleep with
the
lights on that night, just in case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Other than hearing a few noises, it was an uneventful night.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A Haunted History</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Leah_Lay@hotmail.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I was shown this site by a coworker&#8230; very
impressive! Within
the astonishing volume of personal accounts, I&#8217;ve noticed some
similarities
between my stories and the experiences of complete strangers. Even to a
skeptic
(which I am not) that has to be pretty convincing. I wanted to list a
few of my
encounters here.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The majority of my paranormal experiences
happened in
elementary school. We lived in a fairly new house in <st1:place
 w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Rowlett</st1:city>, <st1:state w:st="on">TX</st1:state></st1:place>.
My bedroom faced the street, across the hall from my parent&#8217;s room, and
we had
an attic with a fold-out ladder above my room. I witnessed several
strange
phenomena that terrified me to the point where I would run into my
parent&#8217;s
room and tuck myself under their bed frame to spend the rest of the
night. </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The first incident that I can remember:</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I was laying in bed reading, and I turned out
my lamp, but
the room was illuminated by the street. I saw a wispy figure about 3
feet high
that looked almost like a rag doll, with a round head and a draping
featureless
body. The apparition rose steadily up into the air and disappeared into
the
ceiling. </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>From then on, it just steadily went downhill.
I had an
antique vanity, and I saw ghostly faces all around the perimeter of the
mirror,
twisting and morphing. </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Then I awoke one night, and at the head of my
bed sat a
figure that was darker than the darkness in my room, a shadow man, and
he was
completely featureless aside from the shape of a brimmed hat. I was
paralyzed
with fear, and I was too scared to move to even look away. I eventually
must
have passed out from exhaustion.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I began to notice strange happenings. I would
go to bed, and
wake up with an open window. Or my curtains would be drawn before bed,
and I&#8217;d
wake up to have them closed. </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>And finally, after being terrified by one
thing or another,
I was curled up under my parent&#8217;s bed frame, I looked in the dresser
mirror
across the room, and there was a figure of a large black vicious dog
with red
eyes. It was snarling, and drooling, and showing its teeth, but there
was no
sound. Terrified, I slammed my eyes shut, and shuddered uncontrollably
until I
fell asleep.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>As I grew up, I saw less and less. We moved a
few times, and
I started to forget about my childhood horrors. Then in high school, we
moved
to SC. A few weird things in that house: I came home once to find the
attic
door wide open when no one else was home. My mom told me she felt
someone
stroking her hair while she napped, and felt a person sit on the edge
of the
bed, but no one was there. She also kept several creepy dolls that
seemed to
move on their own, or watch you. One time at the library, I stumbled
upon a
book called In a Dark Place, which chronicled a horrific haunting that
occurred
in <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Connecticut</st1:place></st1:state>.
The <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Warrens</st1:place></st1:city>
were even called upon to help rid this family of malicious demonic
forces. It
was the most terrifying book I&#8217;ve ever read. I would grow very uneasy
and
spooked while I read it, and it got to the point where I couldn&#8217;t even
sleep
with the book in my bedroom. </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Another story was at the Dillard&#8217;s in <st1:place
 w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Denton</st1:city>, <st1:state w:st="on">TX</st1:state></st1:place>
where I worked as a perfume salesperson in a really old mall. I went
into the
storage area for our department, which was an oddly shaped room, with
very
tight corners and high shelves. I heard a &#8220;Pssst.&#8221; So I called out, and
when no
one replied, I went around the corners and didn&#8217;t see anyone. I blamed
it on
pipes, or something else, and brushed it off and went back to searching
for my
products. Then I heard a more insistent &#8220;PSSST.&#8221; This time closer and
louder,
and my heart stopped, and I panicked and ran out of the storage room as
fast as
I could, and wouldn&#8217;t go in there alone anymore.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A few years later at the Legacy Theatre in <st1:place
 w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Plano</st1:city>, <st1:state w:st="on">TX</st1:state></st1:place>
after a movie, I went to the restroom alone. After finishing up in the
stall, I
was gripped by this inexplicable terror, almost like something was
coming down
the aisle of stalls to get me. I began to panic and shake, and ran out
of the
bathroom, with the hair on the back of my neck standing on end. When I
came
out, my friends were asking me what was wrong. &#8220;You look like you&#8217;ve
seen a
ghost!&#8221;</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I also had a dream that I was getting ready
for my
grandfather&#8217;s funeral, and when I woke up, I got the call that he
passed away
in the middle of the night. </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>This last story was from my dad, and it&#8217;s
probably one of
the worst I&#8217;ve heard, particularly because of its creepiness, but also
b/c my
dad is a hardcore skeptic, very Christian, and he doesn&#8217;t make things
up.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When he was a boy, he had a paper route,
which meant he had
to wake up early and bike around the neighborhoods before dawn. He came
across
a ditch that had traces of a morning fog, and he saw what appeared to
be a
naked human running across the road on its hands and feet, loping like
an
animal. Scared him to death, he says!</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>That concludes my paranormal history. Thanks
for taking the
time to read this! Keep up the good work =)</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:Leah_Lay@hotmail.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I had a boyfriend in college whose mother
killed herself. It
was a very traumatizing and tragic event, and the entire family was
deeply
effected by it, even though she didn&#8217;t live with them b/c they were
divorced.
After the family gathered together, we all sat in a circle and held
hands, and
the stepmother wanted to pray. My boyfriend&#8217;s little sister said &#8220;But
mom was
Jewish!&#8221; and the stepmother proceeded to pray a Christian prayer
anyway. Right
in the middle of the prayer, the power went out in the entire house and
then
came back on. There wasn&#8217;t a storm or any wind, nor did they neglect to
pay the
bill. It was definitely eerie. They built that house as a family, and
it was
her &#8216;dream house&#8217; so I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to find her still there to
this
day.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I had a dog for 13 years named Hippie.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Now Hippie Loved cats and disliked other
dogs, kids and most people. When our babies were born Hippie decided
that she
would guard the babies when they were asleep mostly at night.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>She would jump off of my bed and go into the
babies room and sleep in the middle of the floor between the 2 cribes.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>A few months later Hippie delveloped cancer
and we had it removed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The day she came
home she went right to the babies room and laid down between the cribes.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Hippie would go to sleep and snore.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>3 months later Hippi died at home. Shortly
after her death we were up late and we heard what we thought were
little nails
clicking on the floor of the kitchen headed for the babies room.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We got up to look but of course nothing was
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even my oldest daughter heard it
and asked is that Hippie?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There could be
times that you would hear her then after the walking if you listened
long
enough you could hear a faint snoring coming from the room.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>This went on for several months until about a
month before the house was sold then it stoped.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We figured that Hippie loved us so much that even in death she
felt that
it was her job to guard us and the babies until she felt it was no
longer
necessary.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Few Personal Stories</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: o5pr3y@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>First off I just want to say that I love your
site and I've
read nearly all the stories in it. I've been meaning to send in a few
stories
of my own but never got around to it. </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When I was a little kid,(about 3 - 6), My
cousin lived in a
house that gave me the creeps. I spent the night there frequently but
never
thought to much about the eeriness untill after they moved out and
other
relatives moved in. Well a few years back we had a small family party
at the
old house and I hadn't stepped foot in it in 15 + years. It got late
and my
cousin and I were relaxing in the garage and just talking when we both
felt
cold and uneasy. So we left the room and joined everyone else. When it
got down
to just a few of us, My family and my cousin's and the current
residents, we
started talking about how the house creeps us out.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My Aunt mentioned that whenever she went into
the Garage to
do laundry she would feel like someone was watching her and sometimes
there
would be what she called , the "darkman", staring at her. It always
just stood there and thats it. One of the current residents told us
about thier
late son's encounter had happend years before. He said that he painted
his room
black so he could use it as a development lab, (he was a photographer).
Well
the very first night when he was sleeping in it, ( still just his room,
no
development fluids or anything), he saw a small girl. About 2 ft high
and with
a green body with an orange face. It was floating in the top corner of
his
room. From what I was told was that the "girl" turned and looked at
him, and all he did was pull up his sheets and try and sleep.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When my cousin still lived at that house, I
had been moving
around for a while. We settled into a little ghetto area of town with a
cheap
rent since it was all we could afford. I was about 4 at the time. I
don't
remember any of this, but these things were all recently told to me by
my
parents. 1st off, when we were still unpacking, a whole box of shoes
went
missing. After about 3 months the ENTIRE box reappeared in the middle
of the
living room. completely untouched and the tape unbroken. Also, we had a
small
bowl that we kept keys in, but our keys would continously go missing
until the
last exact minute that we needed them.Such as for work. A few odd
things
happened to me while we were there. my Ghostbuster toys went missing (
I'm not
joking, as stupid as it sounds it REALLY happened). Other times, my
mother
would come in and have to block my closet door because i would point
and
complain about the "man". The last incident I was told about was hown
one time my mom stopped me from jumping out our apartment window
because those
kids called my name. I know that sounds cliche but once again I'm not
joking.
My mom is very religious and doesn't joke about those things.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Another incident that happend to me was
around 2002 in the
Spaghetti Factory resturaunt in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city
 w:st="on">Oahu</st1:city> , <st1:state w:st="on">Hawaii</st1:state></st1:place>.
I was there on a family
trip and we were eating a late dinner. I went to use the bactroom and
and as
soon as I walked in I felt uneasy. While I was using the facilities, I
was overcome
by the most tremendous amount of fear I've ever felt. I quickly
finished up,
and went to wash my hands. However I made sure I didnt look in to the
mirror,
(after all NOTHING has made me feel that scared before, the last thing
I needed
was a face to match it). I went back to my meal and talked to my mother
about
it, since she was always interested in hearing these things. I also
went and
asked the manager about it who told me that a few other people, both
employees
and customers, had felt something like that before but no one had ever
seen
anything.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>One of my friends (the one who actually told
me about this
site), just recently told me of a new encounter. Its more of a
paranormal story
rather than a ghost one though. His uncle</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>used to dabble around in Astral Projection.
Once when he was
doing so, he turned to check on his body, (something he always did) he
saw what
could only be descibed as a Grim Reaper like creature standing next to
his
physical body and staring at his spirtual self. the creature then
pulled out a
claw shapped blade and seemingly threatened to stab his body on the
bed.
Instantly, my friend's uncle snapped out of the trance and hopped out
of bed
and threw up his arms as if ready to fight, and all the while yelling
out to
the creature to "come on and fight". yet when he looked around<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>the room there was nothing to respond to his
call.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Haunted House</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: stephanie.hoehner@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>in 2007 my husband and i moved to Burns Flat,
<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:state w:st="on">Oklahoma</st1:state></st1:place>
last year after
he was transferred for work. the house that we lived in is located on
an old
military base in town. when my husband went to sign the lease for the
house,
the lady who ran the housing authority there told him that she should
tell him
a little bit of information behind the house before he heard it from
someone else.(we
were also told the same exact story by our landlord). story goes that a
year
before we moved in, a man and his girlfriend were living there together
for
some time until she left him. he committed suicide by hanging himself
in the
hallway at the entrance to the living room. the marks from the rope he
used are
clearly visible on the molding around the attic door. our landlord had
told us
that several males lived there before us and none stayed for more than
2
months. one man, two days. we were told he quickly packed up and left
in the
middle of the night. i didn't believe in any of the drama behind the
stories.
until little by little my husband and i would see shadows out of the
corners of
our eyes. my youngest son, who was two at the time, stood in the
kitchen one
night for several minutes staring at the back door. he wouldn't respond
to me
calling to him. after that he would look towards the kitchen and stare.
after
seven months of living there, my husband left his job and we made very
quick
plans to move back to OKC to be closer to my parents. we started
packing and
moving by the next day. on the night before we left, early that morning
around
3 am, we were laying in bed watching tv. we had the door to our room
opened
enough that we could see our kids room across the hall. i looked up and
had
seen half of a solid silhouette standing in the doorway. i say it was a
"solid" because most of the light from kid's nightlight was blocked.
i shrieked and jumped on my husband saying someone was watching us. I
got up to
see if one of the kids had got up, but, they were sound asleep. i
checked in
the living room to see if my mom (who stayed the night to help us) had
got up,
she was sound asleep too. we haven't been back since and will not go
back.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>One of the Haunted Places</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: rocknrollbabe511@aol.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Hi, I kinda wanted to tell me own story about
one of the
places that are listed in the Georgia Haunted Places. In <st1:place
 w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Griffin</st1:city></st1:place> The
Trestle. Theres more to it then
what you have posted. My cousin lives in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Griffin</st1:place></st1:city>
and we&#8217;ve visited the Trestle a few times. Our first time was nothing
big. We
could feel a presence that we feel didn&#8217;t want us there or back. We had
planned
to go back that night, but never made it due to the car doors not
opening and
when we finally got them to open on the way there we had a car wreck,
and after
that our last attempt to go, the car wouldn&#8217;t start. </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>After a few weeks of avoiding the place we
went back. This
is just a few things we saw. Theres a small wooden bridge before you
get to the
trestle. You can hear the screams of a women that was said to have to
raped and
killed there. Also the trestle was known for its hagging and some
nights you
can see the out lines of peoples bodies haning. Since the area is being
built
on theres is less and less activity. But theres a line on the ground
that keeps
the spirits in that area and away from some of the people that live
there.
Other then that I don&#8217;t know much more about the place but I thought
you could
add some of that to your page.</big></p>

Story</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: christinerichter@gmail.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My story starts in 1983, the year I was born
in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Des Plaines</st1:city>, <st1:state
 w:st="on">Illinois</st1:state></st1:place>.
My parents and my older brother had previously lived in a two-flat, but
with a
new baby, they decided they needed more space. House hunting was
difficult for
them, because money was tight, and they always seemed to get outbid on
the
property they wanted. When they pulled up to the house right off of the
Wolf
Rd. Circle, they thought it was too good to be true. It was a brick
ranch, with
wood floors, and all of the space our young family would need. There
were
schools within walking distance and a couple of parks too, they thought
there
was no way we would be able to place a successful bid on this one
without a
fight. It seems the property had been on the market for 7 years and no
one had
stayed there very long. My parents were ecstatic, and immediately
placed a bid,
and bought the house. </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Everything was pretty normal, and no one
seemed to notice
anything odd, little noises were just the foundation settling, right?
The day I
was christened, my parents invited everyone over for a party, and to
see the
new house. We had moved in a month or two before so this was the first
opportunity for the family to check it out. My aunt walked up the
steps, and as
soon as she set one foot in our entry way, not even saying hello,
looked at my
mother and said, "I will not go in your basement, and will not go in
your
attic..." My mom thought it was strange but just brushed it off.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>While we were living in the house, things
seemed to
escalate. The kitchen was always about 20 degrees colder than the rest
of the
house, even on the hottest summer days. There were constant footsteps
down the
hallways that were noticeable because of the wood floors. One day my
Godmother
and my mom were hanging out in the house and watching me. They heard
the
footsteps coming down the hallway, and me being a one year old heard
them too.
You could follow where they were coming from, and as soon as they
approached
where the doorway was I started screaming and crying at the top of my
lungs.
Needless to say, they picked me up and ran out of the house as quickly
as they
could. We didn't go back until my dad was home from work. Another weird
thing
that occurred regularly was that we had storm windows in the basement
that had
shutters on the basement walls that were locked from the inside. There
was no
wind that would come from the window wells, but they would bang at
random
times.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Everyone in my immediate family was injured
while living in
the house. My brother, who was 8-9 at the time was playing on our
living room
floor, when out of nowhere my mom hears a scream. She walks in to find
the
fireplace mantle on top of him. He of course couldn't have pried it off
the
wall, and it was about 15 feet away from the fireplace. He said it flew
off the
wall onto him. My dad was hanging up artwork in a hallway one day, and
said the
hammer flew back and hit him above the eye. He had to go to the
hospital and
still has 2 scars above his eye from where the sharp points on the
opposite end
of the hammer hit him. My mom also said an unseen force pushed her off
the deck
and she broke her wrist.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I was the only one to see the ghost, but I
cannot recall
anything, even though this is my very first childhood memory. I was
about 3 at
the time and my dad asked me to get him a pop from the fridge. I
remember
mundane details like the socks he was wearing and my point-of-view
while
walking down the hallway. I reached the fridge, grabbed a pop, and
turned
around to head back to the other room. When I did, I screamed and
that's all I
remember. My parents found me lying on the kitchen floor, and when they
woke me
I didn't remember what happened. I'm 25 years old now, and I try to
remember,
but I still can't. I've thought about going to a hypnotist to bring the
memory
back, but I'm too afraid.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My parents had been in the house a while now,
and got
friendly with the neighbors. After a while they started asking about
the house
and our experiences with it. They then mentioned that they knew the
house
wasn't "right". It had been vacant for a long time, and whenever
anyone moved in, they wouldn't last too long. They told my parents that
an
older couple had lived there and the husband was a salesman that would
travel
frequently. His wife, <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pearl</st1:place></st1:city>,
had some medical ailment and was confined to a wheelchair. One time
when the
husband went out of town, Pearl died in the kitchen and no one knew
until the
husband came home a week or two later. The husband must have known that
even
after death, <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pearl</st1:place></st1:city>
stayed in the house because even though he moved out, he paid for the
house to
be kept up and the heating and air conditioning to run for the 7 years
it was
vacant.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My mom went to a psychic around this time
with some
girlfriends, and they all had a reading. After she was done giving my
mom a
reading about life children, job, future, etc. She said, "I know you
didn't come here to find out about this, you really want to know who is
in your
house..." Finally, someone offered to help. She told my mom to go back
into the house and tell <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pearl</st1:place></st1:city>
that she was welcome to stay if she would leave us alone, but if she
wanted to
cause trouble she would have to leave. After that my mom had the house
blessed,
and nothing happened again. We lived there another 2 years before we
moved.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I live in a suburb about 40 minutes away now,
but every time
I pass that house I always wonder if <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Pearl</st1:place></st1:city>
is still there.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Summit Inn</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I wanted to tell you a little about the
Summit Inn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The summit <st1:place
 w:st="on">Inn</st1:place>
was the only place in franklin that had a live band.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They would open it up for dancing fools such
as my self and my best friend <st1:personname w:st="on">Karen</st1:personname>.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We partied there every weekend.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The ghosts name was Ester.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
always heard stories.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The owner who was
killed Chuck, and His wife,
who is now out of the hospital, <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Nancy</st1:place></st1:city>
we always telling people about her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The oldest Daughter Jessica and her husband
Joey ran the bar
forever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a grand place.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The fires were never so bad.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I remember the first one after we started
parting started in the bar in a service elevator and went all the way
up to the
attic. but it was like it was contained. the second one i remember
destroyed
the entire bar.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Now alot of people would stay the night if
they drank too
much and would hear stories of <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Nancy</st1:place></st1:city>
laying blankets out on the beds and they would be back in the closet
before the
Guest came back to the room.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>We would always joke and call up the stairs
"Hey Ester
come join the party...".</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>We were all shocked when the <st1:city
 w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Summit</st1:place></st1:city> actually
burned down. Chuck was a
great guy. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Kind hearted, fun and full of
life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The property is gated off now, but, I have
lots of pictures
of the summit when the energy was high.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And regulars came every weekend to kick up their heals and
listen to the
band.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you want i will try to get them
scanned and send them to you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know how
a little information can make a story a little more like an old friend.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Keep up the good work and If I come up with
any stories you
don't have i will be sure to let you know.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>In my family almost evryone has experienced<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>the paranormal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
is only one of the many things I have
experienced. It happened about five years ago, when my daughter was
almost 5
yrs old. For some reason, that I don't know, I have always liked to
visit
cementeries and this happend at a cementery located in <st1:city
 w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hollywood</st1:place></st1:city>.<span
 style="">&nbsp;
</span>My sister and I desided to go look for Rodolfo Valentino's
resting place
which is in the mousolium.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a huge
mousolium but at the entrence you get a map that shows exactly where
the famous
stars of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">hollywood</st1:city></st1:place>
are buried.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>OK, so we are in the
mousolium following the map but we having problems finding Rodolfo
Valentino's
resting place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After about 35 minutes,
and we were still looking, when my two older sons (21 &amp; 17 years
old) came
up to us and told me, "what's wrong with your daughter?" and I asked
"why?". They, than, asked me to look at what my daughter was
doing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My daughter was knocking on the
wall(the covers to where the coffins are put in) and was saying "I'm
coming".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After knocking, she would
run over to anotherone and would do and say the same thing over and
over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I watched<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>for about five minutes in which time my sons desided to leave
due to
they were really scared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I called my
daughter and asked her what was she doing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My daughter looked at me and very camly(even looked happy) said,
"the lady is dead".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that
age my daughter was calling males and females "lady".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I got a little scared too and told her to
tell the 'lady' to go away to which she turned and said "good
bye".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sister, kids and I were
the only ones in the place and this was the first time I had ever been
in a
mousolium.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How would my daughter know
that those were not regular walls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
never knocked on the house walls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Us
adults didn't see anything out of the ordinary but we did get a little
scared
due to the way my daughter was knocking and saying "I'm coming"
sounded as if people were calling her and she was responding...Ok, it's
a long
story but I hope you enjoyed it...I always read stories in this page
and I
really like this site...keep up the good work....</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>About 20 years ago I was employed by Bull
Worldwide systems.
They had a location in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Lawrence</st1:city>,
<st1:state w:st="on">MA</st1:state></st1:place> on <st1:street
 w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Merrimack Street</st1:address></st1:street>
in the old Wood Mill. I
was in Security and worked numerous night shifts. There is a ghost that
haunts
the 2nd floor far east wing near the exiting staircase. There were many
a
nights I held the only key to the area that was secured and alarmed. It
was my
job to walk the floors, secure the area and leave. After walking my
tour I
would sit in the Security control room on the first floor and get
window alarms
going off. I would then walk up to that area and after exiting the
elevator I
would see lights on and get the strong smell of lilac perfume. Upon
entering
the area the window would be open, (30ft up and no ladders around
outside,
windows had screens latched inside) lights on and even sometimes
furniture
moved and placed on desks. Puzzled, I would leave the area, shutting
off
lights, latching the window, fixing the desks and re-setting the
alarms. It
would happen every now and then with no explanation. Many employees
witnessed
similar events, even in daylight hours, but no one saw an apparition or
figure.
However, the lilac perfume and temperature in the area would always be
cooler
when that fragrance was around. When it was gone or normal, the
temperature was
usually around 75. </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The story goes from Wood Mill history, that
at the turn of
the century a young woman had an accident in that 2nd floor area. Her
long hair
got her hair stuck in a huge woolen machine eventually crushing her
skull. Back
then there were no emergency shut offs and machines just kept running
until the
steam stopped the engines. They say its her ghost that haunts that
floor.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Today in 2008, the Wood Mill is being
converted into Luxury
Condo's. Good luck to the individual who purchases the 2nd floor east
end.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Below is a link to the site. There is a black
and white
photo showing the building that looks like its 3 separate buildings
attached
but is actaully one. The floor with activity is the one with the
majority of
tractor trailors parked in front of or the top of the photo wit the
little mill
next to it.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>here's the story:</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>"At the top of <st1:street w:st="on"><st1:address
 w:st="on">St. John's Drive</st1:address></st1:street> (just off of <st1:street
 w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Mosley Rd</st1:address></st1:street>)
in the
Gladstone/Peapack area of NJ, there's a school. It used to be a church
and a
catholic school. Nuns still reside there, they live on the third floor
of the
main building, and rent out most of the land and buildings to <st1:place
 w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Montgomery</st1:placename> <st1:placetype
 w:st="on">Academy</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
a K-12 school. Well, back when it was a boarding school (all girls) one
of the
dormatory buildings one night caught fire and burned down with several
of the
girls (ages 8-15) inside, as well as one or two of the staff who was on
watch
for the night. Now there are many, many places in the school that are
rotted
and condemned that are mostly like basement areas and old boiler rooms.
A few
years ago we were starting up a photography club for the school, and
knew of an
old dark room and the like that, like much of the old school, still had
equipment and things like pictures in it. So, a group of about eight of
us
(unfortunately, at least half were younger kids, who got easily scared)
went
down, very carefully, to the old dark room to see what we could
scrounge up.
What we wound up finding as far as materials were mostly old
photographs and a
few film reels... some interesting stuff, some every-day. but some of
the old
rooms we had to pass just happened to have occupants of the
'less-than-solid" variety.. Needless to say, the younger kids bolted,
and
we had to chase 'em all the way out. Other occurances are reported
sounds of
children playing with marbles on the hard floor upstairs above one room
on the
first floor, though since Montgomery has occupied the space (and most
likely
for some time before that), that room upstairs has been carpeted. In
the first
floor girls' bathroom there have been reportings of doors slamming and
leaky
faucets that haven't actually had working pipes for years... there is
no water
that runs to them.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Also, the old principal of the school, who
was there when i
got there, used to give his 'Haunted Tour' to the graduating senior
class every
year.."</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My Fathers Stories</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: stjulson@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I have been a frequent visitor to your site
for years now,
and have constantly shared and showed it to many friends of mine. I
have been
fascinated with the supernatural since I was a child, mainly due to my
father's
experiences and his frankness and honesty when he tells me the stories
which he
has experienced.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My father lost his mother when he was only 6
years old, and
ever since then has experienced many different instances where he
believes his
mother has made contact with him. Starting from when I was born--two
weeks old,
as a matter of fact--my father was driving home from work on the always
busy
and awful <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Florida</st1:place></st1:state>
highways when he heard a woman's voice tell him to put on his seatbelt.
He
should have been wearing it, I know, but Dads will be Dads. Three
seconds after
he heeded this and locked in his seatbelt, an 18-wheeler merged into
his lane,
not seeing him, and smashed his car into the barrier. Had he not put on
his seatbelt,
who knows. As the years went on, his mother's jewelry which he had
would move
around the house, especially his room, without anyone touching it. He
would
hear voices at night call his name, and often times our dog would bark
at
nothing. There were also two instances where her picture, which sat on
his
nightstand, would suddenly move or fall over without anyone near it.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I myself, sadly, have experienced the
supernatural only
twice, or so I like to believe. It may be foolish to wish that I have
experienced
it more, but oh well. Once, when I was only four years old, I was
climbing atop
a large, brick barbeque which my father was in the middle of
constructing. The
bricks were massive compared to my small body, since I was four, and
when I was
climbing on them began to move so violently from me climbing on them
that I
fell onto my back, onto the patio floor (my father had not yet mortared
the
bricks). As soon as I hit the floor, the bricks began to fall on top of
me.
Strangely, and I am not going to explain what I felt or thought I saw,
as I was
four and it is only a one or two second memory, but the bricks did
little
damage to my body, only giving me cuts and bruises. By all rights they
should
have broken all the bones they hit, including my legs, arms, and
sternum. I
truly believe that something, perhaps my grandmother, laid on top of me
and
took the blows. My second experienced happened when I was 17 and was
laying in
bed. Not two minutes after I had turned off the lights, something
walked from
the hallway up to the foot of my bed. It was not hurried walking, or
slow, but
just walking as if something was coming to check on me, either barefoot
or
wearing slippers. Needless to say, it scared the crap out of me, and I
made a
nightlight out of my bed-side lamp. Of course, once the lights were on,
nothing
was there. </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Thank you for having this site. It's nice for
all of us
believers to have a place to meet and share.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Hello! I came across your website today and
thought I would
share a few things with you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have
always had the ability, I guess you could say, to know when ghosts are
present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On occasion I have even seen
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mostly, it is just a sense that
they are there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I inherited this from my
mom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have a lot of stories, some from
my mom, and some from my own experiences.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first one I want to tell you about was something that
happened with
my son when he was two.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My husband's brother died two weeks before we
were
married.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had never mentioned Uncle Jon
to my son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he was two years old my
son began telling me that Uncle Jon was coming to visit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Everyday for about a week he would tell me
this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The one night while I was setting
the table for dinner, he got very excited and started saying "He's here
Mom! He's Here!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked who was
here and he told me that Uncle Jon was here.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I then asked where he was, and my son pointed into the kitchen
behind
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was one of the few times that I
haven't been able to sense that someone was there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My son still believes in ghosts to this
day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is now 10 years old.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A couple years after that we moved into
another house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no history of a
death in the
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had been built in 1980.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I always felt a presence there but oddly
enough, it was never the same person.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Our visitors came and went as though they were staying at a
hotel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes they were men and
sometimes
women.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most were non-threatening.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I would see them walking down the upstairs
hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night while cooking dinner a
woman wearing an old fashoined dress, 1800's style I would guess,
walked
through the kitchen towards the family room and then just vanished.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>A couple of years ago while we were on
vacation a ghost moved into my youngest son's room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From the time we returned noone was comfortable
in that room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My son began crying,
saying he didn't want to die.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Death was
suddenly on his mind a lot and he was scared.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I knew what was going on and I finally had enough.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I walked into his bedroom one night and said
out loud, "You are not welcome here.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You have no right to do this to my son, he is a kind and loving
boy who
does not deserve to be frightened like this.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You want to stay in this house than learn to share and stop
scaring my
son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was his room first.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You have a problem with that then pick on
someone who can take it!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I then
turned around and walked into my room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The ghost followed me in there and I could feel a lot of
hostility in my
room for awhile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that night, my
son was no longer afraid and did not think of death again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This ghost apparently moved on and never
returned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had many more visitors in
the time that we lived in the house but as I said before, they just
came and
went.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have since moved from that town
and in the new house we smell cigar smoke once in awhile in the closet
under
the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of us smoke.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My Haunted House</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: vethurlow@gmail.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When i was eight years old,after my mother
passed away,my
family and i moved from Hendon to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city
 w:st="on">London</st1:city></st1:place>.
We moved into a newly developed street,into a five bedroom,three story
home. It
was the most beautiful house i had ever lived in and spent the next six
years
gradually moving from room to room as i grew older. For the next three
years or
so i was in the first two immediate bedrooms as you reached the second
floor.
No disturbances of any kind ever happened;they were very peaceful rooms
to
sleep in. Unfortunately,my dad,my older sister and eldest brother
decided to
use a Ouija board in my dads room at the end of the hallway on the same
floor.
They spent many weeks playing<span style="">&nbsp; </span>with
it,without informing my older brother and i. We had one spare room on
the third
floor next to my sisters room as my eldest brother only ever slept
there when
he stayed over. I was tired of my room and moved into that room. Still
unaware
of what they had been doing,i didn't know at that point that they had
also
played in her room. Less than three days after i moved in there,i got
the urge
to move my bed against the closet door. I felt uneasy having it stare
at me
when i slept,i moved it in hopes of keeping whatever was in there to
remain
that way. one day,i was reading in my room and i heard scratching
coming from
above me,which would have been the attic. naturally i bolted and had my
sister
check it out,of course nothing was there. After that i slept downstairs
until
my dad made a wonderful suggestion of me taking his room. I was
thrilled and
too young to think about why he would give it up so easily. Well, he
took the
other second floor bedroom and i took his,while my sister remained up
there
alone. I had absolutely no problems there for the first six months.
Then,my dad
decided to share with us during a story telling night,about what they
had done
in my room. They told me of a slightly unnerving presence that grew
more
hostile with every new session. This spirit claimed to be my mum,knew
everything but one question,"How did we lose our wedding rings?".
This spirit failed that one,so they called him on it and he then
claimed to be
the devil. That was their very last experiment and burned the board in
a
bonfire we had had months earlier. I didn't have a good nights sleep in
that
room for almost the duration of me sleeping in there until we moved
out. It
started with my room already so dark,feeling like the space was closing
in on
me. I would try to move around and make noise to make myself feel
comfortable.
But then, i felt like someone was watching me from behind me in the
corner of
my room. It felt evil,like it hated me. Like a cold stare coming from
someone
you're most afraid of. I just tried not to breathe,i didn't move an
inch the
whole night. I pretended to be asleep. I would lay on my side and close
my
eyes,too afraid to open them again because i could feel it staring me
in the
face. Cold sweats would come out of nowhere,all over my body and i was
frozen
either until i woke or day break. It progressed to my door rattling at
two or
three in the morning. I would get so scared because on most nights when
that
happened,there would be these soft and slow footsteps leading up to the
door
before it started. I was always afraid and my dad didn't believe me,he
would
just say "if it wanted to hurt you,it would have done so by
now".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember the first night
that i stood up for myself, i flipped the light on,jumped out of bed, i
swung
the door open and said "go away!" and shut it again. Every time it
happened after that i began to treat it as a prank. i would just say
out loud
things like "leave me alone!", "what do you want? go away".
By the time we had moved out, these happenings became less and less
frequent.
The weirdest part was that as time went on in that house,it became less
and
less beautiful. It started to look and feel old,as if the home we had
built in
it was fading. On the day we left,i looked back and felt a sadness as
though it
had died. I was relieved to be gone.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>6 Years Ago</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: doggyboy137@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>It started about six years ago, my family
moved into a house
in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Murray</st1:city>, <st1:state
 w:st="on">Utah</st1:state></st1:place>. Late at night, i would lie in
my bed
watching shadows of witches walk up and down my hallway pacing. When we
were
cleaning out the cupboards, we found a<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>sharp tooth, strange coins, and weird writing on the walls. In
the
basement, there was a cement room, with no light in it. In the cement
room
there was no way out of it, but there was a dead-bolt lock on the
outside, and
many scratches on the inside, and when you would look inside the cement
room,
you would see red eyes staring at you. One night i was lieing asleep in
my bed
when all of a sudden someone said my name, and they asked me to come
play with
them, they kept tuggung on my blanket asking me to play but i just
ignored
it.My father would have dreams of indians dancing around a fire. There
were
stairs in the house that led to wall then turned, and on the wall there
was a
huge red stain that would not come out. We have pictures of the house
which has
a huge tree in front of it that looks like a witch over the house, also
in the
picture there are children, who are transparent who were not there when
the
picture was taken. My mothere was in the kitchen when she felt cold
hands grab
her neck and slam it aginst the table, she still has the scar. I would
walk
past the basement door and her a man and a woman arguing. We lived in
that
house for EXACTLY five years, when looking over paper work with our
realtor, every
other person who lived in that house lived there for five years,
EXACTLY FIVE
YEARS!!! One day the realtor came to ask us how we liked the house, we
told hi
it was haunted, he denied our claim, then a branch on the tree hit him
in the
head and he tripped, after that he quit selling realestate. when we
started to
ask our neighbors about the house they turned weird!! when we would
bring up
the subject to them they would run in there homes. Now ever since i
lived in
that house, i see things!!</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My Story - Yolanda</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: Jmeraz@aol.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I bought a house in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city
 w:st="on">Lakewood</st1:city> <st1:state w:st="on">CA</st1:state></st1:place>
in 1995.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the beginning, my youngest
daughter
refused to sleep in her room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said
it was because she didn't like the colors, but I found out later it was
because
she would hear voices and then the room would go absolutely pitch black
no
matter what time of day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She slept on
the couch for the entire 11 years we lived there.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>In June of 2006, someone broke into the house
and attacked
everyone with a knife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My oldest
daughter, Yolanda was killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
daughter refused to ever step foot in the house again after she was
released
from the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My youngest daughter
and I had to return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had no other
place to go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first, we would see
lights outside my bedroom window every night at about 3 am.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>That was about the time the attack had
started.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We would hear the tv even when
it was turned off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were always
bangs in the house for no reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
cats would look up at the same place when they happened.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I would walk down the hall and hear footsteps
and music from
Yolanda's room even though there was nobody in that area of the house.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>We sold the house and moved out at the end of
2006.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It wasn't because of the incidents
in the
house, but I still wonder if my daughter is somehow trapped in that
house,
reliving that night.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I just love your web site.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I wanted to tell my experience with the old fort in <st1:place
 w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Fort Scott</st1:city>, <st1:state
 w:st="on">Kansas</st1:state></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I believe that I am slightly sensitive and do
believe in
"ghosts" or spirits,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My (now)
ex-husband is sensitive as well as is some members of his family.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I live in SE Kansas and lived in <st1:place
 w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Fort Scott</st1:city>, <st1:state
 w:st="on">KS</st1:state></st1:place><span style="">&nbsp; </span>for
a few years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Back in about 2004, myself, my then-husband,
and our two
daughters were visiting the fort,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
after hours one summer evening, but not quite even dusk yet,<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>My oldest daughter was about 4 years old and
my youngest daughter was about 3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
were walking downtown towards the fort, and then walked past the front
of the
fort.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once we passed the main building,
my oldest daughter asked me, "What that soldier was doing up on the
second
floor balcony?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Looking, there was
no one there!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked her what the man
was wearing and she said blue clothes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That made me think Union soldiers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We continued to walk past and she looked back, I asked her if he
was
still there and she said no, that he must have gone inside. My husband
asked he
if she liked the large old tree in the middle of the courtyard in the
middle of
the fort, because he himself had some sort of "feeling" surrounding
it,. My daughter said that it gave her goosebumps and made the hair on
her arms
stand up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Since then, we have visited the fort and when
we are there
during the working hours nothing really seems amiss.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I personally got a cold feeling in the
basement museum part of the main building (where my daughter previously
saw the
soldier man).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just a general feeling
that I wasn't alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although, there
were no other visitors down there with me,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I spoke with one of the park rangers and he said that the alarms
go off
all the time, without reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
actually there with my daughters last year (2007) when the alarm was
going off,
and spoke to the policeman that responded and he was exasperated and
told me
that it happens all the time. </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Feel free to take any piece of my story and
add it to the
haunted places page or even the haunted stories page,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have had other things happen in my
lifetime, that I may relay later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I am a resident of Cazenovia, a small town to
the south east
of <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Syracuse</st1:place></st1:city>.
One late fall night I was driving on <st1:street w:st="on"><st1:address
 w:st="on">East Lake Road</st1:address></st1:street> and came upon what
appeared to be a
young lady and an older woman dressed in 18th Century<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>dresses on the side of the road. I slowed
down to see if they needed any help, but then sped up again once I
realized
that my headlights were passing right through them. To this day I do
not like
to drive that road at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What I
probably saw were spirits walking the carriage path that used to exist,
where
the road now exists.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Oldest Family Home</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: prayer4ne1@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I've never written this down, but our WHOLE
FAMILY can tell
you true experiences about this! Our oldest family home is located
about 2
miles north of <st1:placename w:st="on">Screaming</st1:placename> <st1:placetype
 w:st="on">Bridge</st1:placetype> in Liberty Twp <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Ohio</st1:place></st1:state>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even friends and business associates have encountered a
passed-on
relative who I'm sure, knowing him, will never ever leave. That's okay,
we
don't want him to leave.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My grandfather, Charles Brandenburg, owned
our family farm,
127 acres originally, and made it into a flourishing, lucrative popcorn
and
tomato business for many years. In 1970, after a family argument, he
continued
out in the field next door (used to seat the largest farmhouse). The
tractor he
was using got stuck in the spillway next to the pond (pond's still
there too).
He brought a second tractor out to try to pull out the first tractor
with the
assistance of my grandmother (who just passed away last Fall) and my
aunt (who
currently resides at 5111). In his attempt, the tractor turned over on
him,
crushing him and killing him instantly. Strangely, everyone seemed to
know
something occured there and came to the site. They said they saw a
bright glow
in the sky.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Ever since then, more people than I can tell
you have each
had an experience, describing him so well, we knew who they were
talking about,
and we've showed them his picture. Their expressions have been classic!
</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>You can either hear him or see him and it can
be day or
night. He's always there. He has one particular place he sits. Lights
on or
off, you can see him. It's chilling a little though when you look long
enough
when you are trying to make out what you are looking at when you
suddenly
realize he's looking RIGHT AT YOU! If you turn your back to the living
room of
the house and watch reflections in the many windows, he will stand up,
bow his
head, and walk from one end of the room to the other. </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I would be home as a teenager doing my
homework when my
parents would leave to the store. The light and sound in the room would
change
as he came up to look over my shoulder, and sometimes he would clear
his
throat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Clocks stop and start when you ask him
questions, other
electrical appliances stop and start.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When business associates or parents of friends would come into
the driveway,
they would run up to the house to inform us that someone was sneaking
around
outside by the drive. And everyone seems to know exactly what he looks
like. </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Did I mention---- he built the old house? </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My aunt is now 72 years old and lives there
alone with her
dog. My parents still live in <st1:place w:st="on">West Chester</st1:place>
(as
do I) and they have plenty to share also. </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>God! I only wish someone would catch him on
video or
something! (Just to look at!)</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>If you want any pictures, I can send them.<span

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>This story happened in <st1:city w:st="on">Nanaimo</st1:city>
<st1:state w:st="on">BC</st1:state>, in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region> from 1992-1994. The
people
who experienced phenomena were me, my sister, and my mom. It was in a
house
behind <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Uplands</st1:placename>
<st1:placetype w:st="on">Park</st1:placetype></st1:place> elementary
that was built in the
1970's. I really don't know any of the houses history. While we lived
there my
sister saw an apparition of a short old man with a scarf tied around
his head
several times. Once she saw him appear in the bathroom while she was
taking a
bath. I was sitting in the living room watching tv, and heard her yell.
She saw
him appear in her room, and the upstairs bathroom also. My mom saw him
once, a
few monthes before we moved. We had a large window in the front of our
house,
and she saw him walk by it, then go into our neighbors yard and
disappear
behind a fence. She went outside, and followed him, but saw nobody.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I never saw anybody in that house, but I
experienced other
phenomena. I would often hear the keys on my brothers computer clacking
when I
was the only one home. I experienced really starnge things twice. The
first was
one night when me and my sister were left home alone. We were in the
living
room watching tv when we thought we saw people running through our
yard, and
eard noises. We panicked, and went to the room we shared. We pretended
to be
asleep in case somebody was trying to get in the house, so that they
wouldn't
hurt us. We were lying there for a pretty long time. I heard people
talking
inside our house. It was 2 or more men, and a woman. They were laughing
and one
of them, the woman I think, asked for matches. That was all. Eventually
our
parents came knocking on our window. They didn't have keys, and wanted
in. We
got up, and went to the front door. We told them what had ahappened
right away,
and I found out my sister had heard voices too, saying the same thing I
heard
them say. My parents checked all the windows, and doors, and everything
was
locked from the inside. </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A month or so later my sister and me were
home alone again.
It was about 6 or 7 at night. There was one room on the second floor.
We took
our two pets up with us, and went to watch tv. I left the kitchen light
on
because I was scared. We were up there for about a half hour when we
heard a
noise downstairs. We both went down there. The light switch had
actually been
turned off, and a very heavy large glass bowl that had been on the
counter was placed
on the stove. Nothing really dramatic happened after that in that
house. My
sister saw the old man a few times, but soon he disappeared. I've had
weird
stuff happen since, but nothing that scared me that much.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>"The House Behind Lum's Restaurant"</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anonymous</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A woman I work with told me a ghost story
months ago that I
just can't stop thinking about. If it's true, and I'm convinced that it
is,
then she was a participant in one of the most fascinating paranormal
stories of
all time. By my friend's estimate, the year was 1972</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>or 3. She was in
her twenties and unmarried at the time. She had started hanging out
with these
four guys who shared a rented house that stood at the corner of Wilson
and
Sulphur (I think) near Highway 44 here in St. Louis. Now at this point
I have
to issue a disclaimer of sorts- that my friend (whom I'll call
"Joan") has ever told a lie. She seems very straight forward and
honest and simply not prone to exagerration of any sort. Anyway...she
remembers
her first time at the house and how something went whizzing by her.
When she
mentioned it to her host he told that she hasn't seen anything yet!
Some time
later, she was at a table in the house (in the kitchen or living room I
think)
and an ashtray lifted off the table as if moved by some unseen hand,
and
started circling her. For a second she could not believe her eyes.
Before long,
she was seeing something levitate every time she went to the house!
EVERY TIME!
Once it was a lit cigarette that was lifted which put everyone in a
panic
because they were afraid that when it landed a fire could start. The
consciencious ghost thoughtfully put the cig in the glass of the man
who had
been smoking, which prompted the smoker to ask aloud if "they" didn't
like him smoking! In fact, Joan and a friend spent the night there once
and
claimed to have gotten no sleep whatever- there was so much to watch in
the
house; things moving,things levitating, or both- that there was just
too much
to watch! Once she was talking to one of the guys who lived there about
the
haunting and he told her that's nothing; that she she come by late one
night
close to midnight. Well, it came to pass that they were playing cards
one night
when Joan heard<span style="">&nbsp; </span>something that sounded
like crying. She got up and walked around to where the stairs to the
second
floor were, looked up, and saw a little girl! She was in pajamas and
pig-tails
and holding a doll or teddy bear. And she was crying. Joan said that
when she
focused her eyes she could tell that the girl was slightly
transluscent. The
girl then opened her mouth in what appeared to be a scream and silently
and
gradually (yet quickly) dissappeared. Eventually Joan asked the guys
what they
knew about the house's history and it turns out that they were renting
the
house from an older man (say in his 50's) that was the nephew (?) ofa
couple
who had been murdered in the house roughly twenty years</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>earlier. It seems that one of the couple were
woken up in
the night and went downstairs. It was there that they were confronted
by an
intruder. A struggle ensued. The other spouse came to their aid but
both wound
up being killed. It was immediately after the killings</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>that the intruder saw the little girl at the
top of the
stairs. She was, no doubt, sobbing and hysterical and he killed her
too. Since
Joan has told me this story (last September I think)</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I've been trying to reasearch it a little and
have had no
luck. I have tried to recreate the story in the same order it was told
me,
detail for detail. There are few details I can add. Joan said that
there was
faculty from <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">St. Louis</st1:placename>
<st1:placetype w:st="on">University</st1:placetype></st1:place>
studying the
house for</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>some time back in the 70's. The investigation
did tape
record the reaction of people who had never been in the house before
(these
people did see these amazing feats). Unfortunately she does not know if
any
video footage exists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also said
these four guys seemed to enjoy bringing girls to the house for the
sole
purpose of exposing them to these scary happenings! Whenever these
girls would
cry and claim to have seen something these guys would sometimes say
that they
had seen nothing! The thing that gets me about this story is how
nonchalant
everyone involved seems to have been during these occurances. I can't
believe
anyone would take such a spectacular haunting for granted. And it makes
me
wonder just how many other stories are out there, just as spectacular
maybe,
and just as unknown because the people involved are just taking it for
granted.
Another detail I must add is this; this house, sadly no longer stands.
I'm not
sure when it was raized, but it could have been standing as recently as
2005.
Back in the 70's it stood in the back of Lum's Restaurant. Today, the
house and
restaurant are both gone, and a new hotel (A Drury Inn) has been built
there
which I believe is now open. She has long since lost contact with the
four guys
(which she met while working at a bar called Sub-Station 8). Hopefully
posting
this story will help preserve it and bring more details to light.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The Burns Ranch</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: troyarn@catholic.org</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I spent the first
18
years of my life living in a small <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Kansas</st1:place></st1:state>
town.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Although there was little reason to stay, it
was a great
place to grow up and I have many fond memories of exploring the nearby
woods
and rivers. A lot of strange things happened in and around that town,
but I
will only tell of one for now. This short story is about the Burns
Ranch.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Burns
Ranch was
located about five miles west of town, situated at the base of a gently
sloping
hill literally out in the middle of nowhere. A curving, gravel road was
the
only way to get there and beyond the house this same road soon petered
out into
dirty ruts that faded into miles and miles of unused pasture land.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The house
itself
was a two story Victorian that had to have been built in the early
1900&acute;s. It
was old, but wonderfully remodeled and a beauty to behold. A smaller,
more
modern guest house stood behind it and an ancient barn nearby completed
things.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All of
this had
been in the Burns family for generations; handed down from one son to
the other
till finally Richard Burns inherited it. At the time of this story, Mr.
and
Mrs. Burns had a newborn baby girl and a son who was about 4 years
younger than
me. I was a family friend and while in my high school years, would
house sit
while they were all away on business trips or vacations.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was
a great
gig for any teenager and I always jumped at the chance to get away from
it all
and spend some time alone out there.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
summer they
asked me to stay at their place for a few weeks. The first week I was
to be
alone as usual, but the second week, their son Robert was going to be
there.
Although not much younger than me, they for some reason wanted me to
keep an
eye on him. We got along well enough so this was all fine with me.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
left for the
ranch one late afternoon just as the shadows of the day were starting
to bend
longer toward the east. Weaving through the curves of the road and over
old
low- water bridges, I finally crested a hill, made my way down to the
last of
the bridges, passed through a small forest, and then came out into the
wide,
open spaces of prairie land. About 100 yards further down the road was
the
house.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No matter
how many
times I went out to the ranch, I could never fully get over the creepy
feeling
that would wash over me the minute the house came into view. It always
seemed
foreboding and spooky. The place looked haunted.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
corner of the
house formed a rotunda in which Robert&#8217;s room was located on the second
floor.
As I neared the house, I could see someone standing in the shadows of
his room;
holding the curtain back and watching me arrive. Pulling into the
driveway I
saw the curtain fall back into place, swinging slightly. It seemed that
someone
was home and</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I
wouldn&#8217;t be alone that first week after all.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
driveway led
around the house to the back door, which everyone used when entering or
exiting
the house. The only time I ever saw the front door used was after
dinners when
we would go out to sit on the porch and watch the sun set.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I locked
up the
car, went through the gate of the fenced in yard, and knocked on the
door,
waiting for whoever was inside to answer. When no one did, I went
across the
yard, past a three foot statue of the Virgin Mary, and toward what
amounted to
a cement room that had been built into the side of the hill. It was
some sort
of storm shelter and near the door I found the keys to the house which
were
always hidden there behind an old painting.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I let
myself
into the foyer and sat my bags on a bench, I kept calling out to let my
presence be known. Dead silence was my only welcome. On the right side
of the
entranceway were the stairs that led up to the bedrooms. Under the
stairs and
next to the bench upon which my bags sat was the door that led to the
basement.
Beyond that door and in front of me was the dining room, the kitchen
being to
its left. To the right of the dining room were the rest of the
downstairs; a
few sitting rooms, the library, and an entertainment room.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sure I
saw someone
at the window, I began a search of the house; starting with the first
floor
before working my way upstairs. The stairs ascended to an L shaped
hall. Just
to the left were the master bedroom and bath. To the right and down the
hall,
past another bathroom, were the baby room and a spiral staircase that
led to
one of the sitting rooms below. The guest room I used as well as
Robert&#8217;s
bedroom was around the corner, at the end of the L. I searched these
rooms then
went down to the basement, which had been renovated into a modern
living room
complete with bar. I found nothing.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Perplexed
but kind
of used to how weird the house could be, I went back upstairs to unpack
and
start to enjoy my stay.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I set up
my guitar
and amp in the entertainment room where I planned on creating rock
songs I was
sure millions would jam to in years to come.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The fridge was stocked so that was no problem
and I had
brought along a ton of movies to watch on the VCR in the basement. It
seemed
the only thing I had to worry about was the occasional phone call and
feeding
the dog, which was in a pen out near the old cement shelter. No problem
as far
as I was concerned.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I had
been house
sitting here many times before so knew how eerie things would feel when
evening
came. Like I said, it just had that look of a haunted house. Not much
happened
that first night and the next day I got up, fed and watered the dog,
then
watched a few movies before taking a short walk around the property.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
evening the
phone rang and it was Mr. Burns. He wanted to know how much it had
rained the
night before. I knew he was out of state so told him it didn&#8217;t rain at
all but
he insisted I check his rain counter, a measuring device that he had
attached
to a post near his mailbox. I went out and sure enough, although it had
been
completely dry the last few days, there was about &frac14; inches of
water at the
bottom of the thing.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I went back to the phone, where he was
waiting on the other
line, and told him. He didn&#8217;t seem surprised and said it would probably
rain
that night. He told me to take care, make sure to keep the doors
locked, and to
not let anyone in when evening came.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I liked
Mr. Burns
and he was a decent guy, but sometimes he talked like that; making
little sense
at all. So I agreed to do as he said and hung up the phone. About three
hours
later evening crept up on the ranch and with it came the first storm of
the
summer.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
wasn&#8217;t just a
small shower, this was a torrent. It came down heavy for about thirty
minutes
then calmed to a steady downpour. Suddenly the phone started ringing. I
would
answer but no one would be on the other end of the line. It rang like
that all
night, about three times an hour, and each time I picked up the
receiver I
would be greeted with silence; no voice, no signals, nothing. Just
silence.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the
rain came
down, I looked out the window, down toward the road that led back to
town. I
saw a flicker of light through the nearby forest and went to stand on
the front
porch to get a better look. Sure enough, there was someone down there.
It
seemed a vehicle had stopped just inside the forest at the low water
bridge.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whoever
it was had
most likely been coming out to the ranch, so to make sure there was no
trouble,
I reluctantly slid on my bad weather clothes, went out to the shelter
where I
hung up the key, then made my way through the rain and mud down the
road toward
the light. The wind was howling and the rain pouring down in sheets,
but I
could still see the light shining whenever I raised my head to see
where I was
going.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I finally
got to
the curve that led into the woods and toward the low water bridge but
when I
made the turn, there was nothing there.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By now I
was really
freaked out. The bridge was flooded over and there were no tire marks
on either
side of it. I could clearly see the other side of the bridge and no one
had
been down it since well before the rain started&#8230;probably not since I
came down
the day before.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I checked
around a
few more minutes just to make sure no one happened to be there needing
help,
and then made my way back to the ranch. The phone was ringing again as
I
entered but I didn&#8217;t bother picking it up this time. Let it ring. I had
wet
clothes to get out of and weird lights to think about.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was
warming up in
the kitchen a few hours later when I heard a car horn go off. A steady
drizzle
was coming down now and looking out the window again, I noticed the
lights near
the bridge were back; this time dancing around through the trees before
turning
up the road and coming toward the house. It was a car and every few
seconds the
driver would toot the horn a few times. I got on my clothes, wrapped
the
still-damp coat around me, and went out the back door; this time armed
with a
rifle.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I could
see nothing
past the light of the porch so went out into the storm carrying the
rifle and a
small flash light. I went toward the barn and down the soggy driveway.
The horn
was still honking, but I could no longer see the road due to tall brush
in the
fields so the car was invisible to me but getting louder and louder by
the
moment.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Everything
suddenly
seemed to build up; the car horn got louder, I could now see the glare
of the
lights growing through the brush. I found myself getting tense;
pointing the
now cocked rifle in the general direction of whoever was coming down
that road.
The horn rang out one more time. The light shined just a little
brighter. I
finally got to the end of the drive and went out onto the road.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was
nothing
there to greet me; just a dark, wet, stormy night and a muddy road that
lead to
a very flooded bridge. Even the rain seemed to have eased up a bit.
After a few
minutes of trying to figure all this out, I gave up; covering the rifle
so as
to keep the water off it.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I trudged back toward the house for the last
time that
night, deciding it was safer inside than out there in the open.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nothing
much
happened for the rest of the evening until about 4 a.m., when I was
awakened by
someone pounding on the front door. This was odd. Everyone always used
the back
door. Nonetheless, I got out of bed, put my clothes on, and went
downstairs to
find out what was going on.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My body ached from being out in the storm the
night before.
I tried to hurry down the stairs and through the house as fast as
possible,
listening as the banging becoming more and more persistent.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I had an
idea that
no one was going to be waiting for me on the porch when I opened the
door and I
was right. Unable to sleep, I looked around a bit then brewed a large,
strong
pot of coffee and sat reading till the sun poked up over the horizon.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The day was
bright,
hot, and humid and after a short nap, I decided to take a walk around
the
property. I hung the keys back inside the shelter so as not to lose
them and as
I did, I got a strong urge to go into the little room and explore a
bit. I have
no idea why I would suddenly want to do this since there was really
nothing in
there and to be honest it was not a place I wished to be in. Still, it
took a
little effort to walk away from the shelter. Something told me not to
enter all
the way, so I just stuck my hand in, quickly placed the keys behind the
painting, and then I shut the heavy door.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I took a
long walk.
Before going back to the low water bridge, I shut the barn door which
had come
open during the previous evening&#8217;s storm, then made my way to the top
of the
hill behind the house. From here I got a great view of everything for
miles and
miles. I sat up there for some time then went to the river.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
bridge was
still flooded out but not as bad as before. There were no tire marks
and no
evidence whatsoever of anyone being there before except for what tracks
I had
made.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I still had no idea as to what had happened
the night before.
I would have thought it was all a prank but the storm was a bad one and
besides, the bridge had been out. I went back to the ranch and the
first thing
I noticed was that the barn door was open again. Already on edge, I
peered
inside then closed the door; placing a large rock in front of it.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later
that
afternoon while working out a few songs on my guitar, I kept getting a
very
strong feeling of someone standing right behind me. No matter where I
would sit
the feeling was always there. Growing tired of it, I stopped what I was
doing
and said aloud, &#8220; Stop it! I&#8217;m trying to do something here!&#8221;. No sooner
had I
said this than the feeling stopped. It came back whenever I would start
to
practice my music, but went away when I told it to.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
next day I was
upstairs going through some things when I heard, very loudly, someone
downstairs yell out, &#8220;Hey!&#8221;. It startled me at first, but then I
thought it
might be the family coming home early so I put up what I was doing and
went
down to find an empty<span style="">&nbsp; </span>house.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The rest
of my time
there alone was uneventful with the exception of a lot of weird
feelings. The
library for some reason spooked me as did the shelter and I refused to
use the
spiral staircase located next to the baby room. I was somewhat nervous
the
whole time and took many long walks. Once while sitting at the top of
the hill,
I saw a car coming toward the ranch. It passed through the forest and
made it
over the bridge. I was actually a little relieved. Robert had finally
showed
up.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Robert&#8217;s
grandmother
had brought him back from a summer camp he had attended and after we
finally
said our goodbyes, I sat on the porch with him listening to the various
stories
he had to tell and looking through the photos he&#8217;d brought back. I was
reluctant to mention my own tales but it didn&#8217;t matter; Robert had
grown up in
that house. He knew something weird had happened to me while alone
there.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We spent
the next
few days enjoying the good weather. We hiked, explored the valleys and
forests
along the road, and went on drives that took us to places we&#8217;d never
been to
before. One night, just as the sun was setting, Robert finally asked me
how my
stay had been. I didn&#8217;t hesitate in telling him some of the odd things
that had
happened and he reaffirmed some of them with his own stories.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It seems
he too was
drawn toward the cement shelter where the keys were hidden. The only
difference
was that he had gone inside; the heavy door slamming shut, locking him
in. It
was some time before he was able to push the thing open and get out. He
said
that the Virgin Mary statue had been moved so it was facing the
doorway, as if
watching his struggle.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He was as
confused
as I concerning the lights at the bridge and the mystery car, but he
did
mentioned seeing a lady come down the spiral staircase I was so afraid
of. She
came down, glared at him for a moment, and then walked back up. Robert
never
found out who she was but felt that she was not nice. He also told me
of dreams
he had about the library. They were vivid and scary and involved the
closet. He
had just recently discovered that a relative had been born in that room
years
ago and had died there as well.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Above
each bedroom
door was a small window and Robert said one early morning he woke up
seeing the
shadow of someone come down the hall and stand in front of his slightly
open
door. The person stood there for some time before Robert called out,
thinking
it was his father. When he got no reply, Robert screamed for his
parents and as
they turned the corner in the hall, the shadow disappeared.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
explained why
I always felt watched whenever I tried to sleep in the guest room
across the
hall. As for Robert&#8217;s room, I only went in there to get a CD now and
then. I
never felt comfortable in there ever since I saw someone looking out
the window
at me as I came up to the house that first day.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Toward
the end of
my stay, Robert and I settled down one evening in the basement. We had
movies
to watch and were set for the night. There was a small bathroom between
the
foyer and the kitchen and in it was an old fashioned toilet that had a
string
you pulled when you wanted to flush it. The thing was loud and as we
sat
downstairs watching our second movie we could hear it flushing.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
inspected it
before finally turning off the water and returning to our movies.
Around one or
two o&#8217;clock in the morning we were in that zombie state just before
sleep
actually comes. Suddenly, we heard the back door slam shut.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wide
awake now, we
grabbed a few rifles that we had brought down to the basement with us
and
listened. From right above us we heard the unmistakable sound of boots
shuffling across the foyer floor. They slowly came toward the basement
door and
stopped. Then we heard the door creak open.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I admit I
finally
came to understand the term &#8220;shaking like a leaf&#8221; but Robert wasn&#8217;t
much
braver. We were too scared to even try and pretend to be cool.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
a moment there
was nothing, and then whoever was above us came walking down the
stairs. We
could hear someone brush against the coats that hung on pegs along the
wall. We
could hear the firm, deliberate sound of boots making contact with the
warped
boards that were the steps.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
stairway going
down into the basement was hidden behind a wall so that anyone who came
down
could not be seen until they reached the bottom. The third stair from
the
bottom always made a horrible squeaking noise and when we heard that we
raised
our rifles and waited.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>And waited.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
when no
one came into view, I told whoever was there that we were armed and to
leave.
There was no sound at all. Eventually we gained a little courage and
slowly
peeked around the wall and up the stairway. No one was there. The door
was
shut.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was
beyond scared
at this point and after going throughout the house and checking the
doors and
windows, we spent the rest of the night in the dining room talking
about what
had happened. To this day I am unsure what to think. We heard, without
a doubt,
the back door open up and slam shut. But when we checked it, the key
was still
in the lock and the door was still bolted from the inside.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Robert
left the
next day to go spend a few days at a friend&#8217;s home. He wasn&#8217;t surprised
when I
told him I was asking another friend of mine to come out and stay with
me on my
final night there. That night was quiet except for the usual strange
feelings.
Even my friend mentioned it and left early the next morning.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rather
than spend
another day there alone waiting for Mr. and Mrs.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Burns to return, I wrote a note telling them
I had to leave
early to run a few errands, placing it on the kitchen table.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I packed
up all my
things, made sure the house was cleaned up, and then locked the door. A
sudden
sense of urgency overcame me as I walked to the shelter to put up the
extra
key. I came close to just tossing it into the room in my struggle to
hurry, but
managed somehow to put it back in its proper place on the hook.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I
walked to the
car I noticed the barn door was open again and although I tried to
ignore it, I
ended up going over and shutting it.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The big rock I had put in front of it earlier
was gone.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No one
ever said
anything about me leaving early or asked me how my stay was. Mrs. Burns
would
often laugh at the idea that her house could ever be haunted, but
sometimes I
think that laughter was a little forced.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for
Mr. Burns,
when I asked him how he knew it would rain the evening I checked the
level of
water in his gauge, he looked at me puzzled and swore he never even
called me
during that trip.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I still
don&#8217;t know
what to make of that place. Like I said, lots of strange things
happened in and
around the small town I grew up in. And that was just one of them.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Hi!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
encountered
your site a few years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an
interesting source for ghosts and local legends.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My sister lives on a farm in <st1:place
 w:st="on">Northern Virginia</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
saw your site
and thought that the resident ghost of their farm should be included.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Waverly Farm is in <st1:city w:st="on">Clear
Brook</st1:city>, <st1:state w:st="on">Virginia</st1:state>, about
five miles
north of <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Winchester</st1:place></st1:city>.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The main house was built about 1740 by
Alexander Ross.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later the home was owned
by a great nephew of George Washington.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A clear spring gushes from the farm.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a result of the spring and the droughts experienced in the
1860's,
the house remained neutral ground during most of the Civil War.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>It was after the war that reports of the
ghost, a man in gray, began to appear.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The man wanders at night into the south bedroom on the second
floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On one instance he is reported to
have blown out candles to disrupt a card game.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>PS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
looking
through the ghosts listed for <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Newberry</st1:city>,
<st1:state w:st="on">SC</st1:state></st1:place> (my home town), I
noticed an
error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ghost at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename
 w:st="on">Newberry</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">College</st1:placetype></st1:place>
(Madelain) haunts Smeltzer Hall instead of Keller Hall.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Smeltzer stands on the site of the original
building for the college which had a tower (unlike the present
building).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The story takes place right
after the Civil
War, about thirty-five years before Keller Hall was built.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hope this is useful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ernest Shealy,

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Weird Experiences in South Euclid Home</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: Galgonedaft@aol.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Shortly after moving into my home in South
Euclid,I awakened
one night to see a black figure standing about two feet away from me,It
was
silent,and unmoving,at least six feet tall.I was too terrified to
scream or
move.I could see its hand extended towards me.The hand had the
appearance of
shiny,black glass,I could not see facial features,but I knew it was
lookong at
me,and it was a very evil presense.I had been suffering tormenting
thoughts for
weeks prior to seeing this.For the past ten years I sleep with the
bedroom
lights on all night because of this,When I told this to my then,teenage
daughter,she told me that she had seen orbs,at night in her bedroom,but
had
never told me,for fear of not being believed.We anointed the house with
oil,and
prayed for all evil to go in the name of Jesus Christ.There have been
no more
incidents of this sort here.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There
is one more inexplicable event,however.My 25 year old daughter had a
frightening dream that she was at our old house,in Euclid,that we moved
from 15
years ago,She dreamed that she was frightened,and frantically trying to
get out
of the house,A voice said "dont go in the coal room."She bismissed
the dream,until one week later we saw<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the same house being shown on the evening news,taped off as a
crime
scene.It turned out that much loved schoolteacher Marilyn Habian had
been shot
to death in our old house.Now the really eerie part-her body was found
in the
old coal room,now a bathroom.Creeps me out,to say the least</big></p>
