<P>
<P>
<P><B>I just wanted to share what happened in August 97</B>
<P><B>at my sisters house, but first some background My moms</B>
<P><B>family has always been sensative and it was passed on to me and both</B>
<P><B>sisters. My ex-husband is a buddist and has many wards apon</B>
<P><B>him through religous training.  That said we were at my sisters</B>
<P><B>apt. in Alameda, Ca, and just talking and my sister let us</B>
<P><B>know that she has two spirits that inhabit her 3rd story apt.</B>
<P><B>Well my ex-husband got a little weirded out and let my</B>
<P><B>sister know that she should have let him know before he came in</B>
<P><B>(we've visited off and on for 2yrs and she just thought she had</B>
<P><B>been just  seeing things until my mom and sister said</B>
<P><B>something)because he doesnt know how a spirit would react to him. My</B>
<P><B>sister says there hasent been any weird reaction any other</B>
<P><B>times. so we talked abut it my sister reasuring me they</B>
<P><B>seam  harmless just things disappearing and later showing</B>
<P><B>up where she had just looked or peeking arround the</B>
<P><B>hallway wall like a small child.  Anyways my sister says"Oh,</B>
<P><B>ill just tell them its just Will, he's ok." and we talked</B>
<P><B>about his training and all, well about a minute after what my</B>
<P><B>sister said I felt a slight pressure on my chest and look at my</B>
<P><B>sister then it intensifies and we both look at the hallway, the</B>
<P><B>source of the feeling .  we didnt see anything and the feeling</B>
<P><B>went away. we looked at my ex-husband and he didnt feel</B>
<P><B>anything.  we let him know it was a feeling like oh thats ok.but it</B>
<P><B>was strange because I havent felt anything since I was pregnant</B>
<P><B>w/my 2yr old son.anyways it was strange. I dont know if her</B>
<P><B>apt is some sort of a way-station or what but her mom-in-law saw</B>
<P><B>a woman in white in her hallway.I wish I could have seen it.</B>
<P><B>                    thanks for listening.</B>

<P><B>Shasta</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: j_broccoli@chickmail.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Hi my name is jenny and I live in Irvine, California. Even though this
is a pretty new </B>
<P><B>neighborhood (maybe 10 or 20 years old) it is not creepy, but interesting
in its own way. </B>
<P><B>Now that you know where I live and can stalk me all you want, let me
tell you the interesting</B>
<P><B> story I've got for you. </B>
<P><B>About three years ago, when I moved in, my neighbor's dog, Shasta,
was really sick and in pain. I</B>
<P><B>helped take care of it when he wasn't home. She was always really friendly
with me and whimpered </B>
<P><B>when I called her name over the gate. Eventually, my neighbor told
me to stop coming because </B>
<P><B>Shasta was all better, which I thought was really rude because he knew
I loved Shasta and she </B>
<P><B>was like my little buddy. Every day from then on, Shasta would howl
24-7. when I came to the </B>
<P><B>gate to soothe her, she whimpered of happiness. I heard her claws on
their stone landscaping,</B>
<P><B>heard her panting, you know, the works. After I went home again, she
would start howling like </B>
<P><B>crazy. Two weeks after my neighbor told me to stop coming to see Shasta,
I decided that I would </B>
<P><B>have a talk with him and ask him to let me have Shasta since he was
never home and made it </B>
<P><B>obvious when I was around that she only caused him problems.  When
I approached the door and </B>
<P><B>proposed my plan to him, he gave me a sad look and told me that Shasta
had died two weeks before.</B>
<P><B>He said that he could not bare to tell me earlier. </B>
<P><B>That night, there was no howling</B>
<P>
<P><B>My Egg Headed Friend</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: StacieInAnaheim@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am just going to jot down a few experiences that I had as a child.</B>
<P><B>These aren't really stories, just things that have happened to me as
I</B>
<P><B>was growing up.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I remember lying in my bed for a nap in the middle of the day and</B>
<P><B>something at the foot of y bed would jerk the covers off me.  Not
just</B>
<P><B>tug a little, I mean completely off.  There was a time when I lived
in</B>
<P><B>Germany and there was a man that would walk down our hallway and I</B>
<P><B>remember his head was shaped like an egg and he had no face.  Later
in</B>
<P><B>life he visited me once more in Texas by couching down next to the
bed</B>
<P><B>in the middle of the night and looking at me. Not only did he scare
me,</B>
<P><B>but caused my husband to experience the pain of broken fingers (2)
when</B>
<P><B>I grabbed his hand.  I have not seen my egg-headed friend in a long
time</B>
<P><B>now.</B>
<P>
<P><B>If anyone has info on ghost dogs, I would appreciate some help.  I
have</B>
<P><B>been followed by a white Great Dane/Greyhound cross since I was
little</B>
<P><B>and lived in Germany.  When he visits, he is always looking over his</B>
<P><B>shoulder away from me as if there is something behind him.  My pets
that</B>
<P><B>I have had over the years have never had a problem with him being
there.</B>
<P><B>Just need some feedback.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Thanks </B>

<P><B>Naresh's Story</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: DeLimbu@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>My name is Diya. The story I am sending you is about 3 years ago happened
to </B>
<P><B>my uncle (Naresh) in the eastern part of Nepal (lies between china
&amp; India). </B>
<P>
<P><B>About three years ago at around 7:30 - 8:00 pm ( it gets dark early
there), </B>
<P><B>he was riding from one town to another town to go home after a work.
He had </B>
<P><B>an old van. He was alone. At that time he just got married about a
month </B>
<P><B>before.  Between the town, there is a big forest and a stream. And
also there </B>
<P><B>is a small camp. The camp is near the stream. </B>
<P>
<P><B>As he passed the camp, he glimpsed a sight of a young woman who was
sitting </B>
<P><B>below the stream. She was dressed in a Hindu bride's costume (all red)
and </B>
<P><B>she was weeping. He passed her but something his instinct told him
he should </B>
<P><B>go back and may be give her a ride if she wants. He thought what could
have </B>
<P><B>made her wanted to cry at this time and at this place. </B>
<P>
<P><B>So he went back, she was still weeping. And asked her why she was crying.
She </B>
<P><B>told him it was her misfortune &amp; if he could give her a ride. He
asked her </B>
<P><B>where she was going. She said "Tarara". Its was the same town where
he lived. </B>
<P><B>So he gave her a ride. She told him she would like to sit at the back
seat. </B>
<P><B>He agreed. On the way he asked her how did she came in the middle of
the </B>
<P><B>forest. He turned to look back at her but the mysterious thing was
that she </B>
<P><B>was not there.  He thought may be he was in a dream. But it was real.
And </B>
<P><B>then again as he rode along, he again turned to look back, at this
time she </B>
<P><B>was there. This process repeated again &amp; again for about 20 minutes.
She was </B>
<P><B>there, she was not there. He was petrified.</B>
<P>
<P><B>At last when he was about to reach his house. He turned to look back
again. </B>
<P><B>At this time she was not there. He became glad &amp; parked  outside
and ran to </B>
<P><B>the front door. His wife greeted him on the door. He told her "Something
</B>
<P><B>really strange happened to me". She asked him what was it and why he
looked </B>
<P><B>so black and blue. He told her the whole story and also told her she
was </B>
<P><B>unseen again as he parked the van. At that point the wife said "Who
is that </B>
<P><B>woman standing outside the gate"?. My uncle fainted and became sick
for about </B>
<P><B>two weeks.</B>

<P><B>Another Ghost Experience From Jorcutt</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: jorcutt@hotmail.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>  Hi all.  It's been awhile since I posted my last ghost experience
to </B>
<P><B>Shadowlands, so I thought I'd give an update.</B>
<P><B>  Since I posted on Shadowlands, I've moved to a different house. 
Ralph has </B>
<P><B>long since left me, but I've had some other interesting experiences
in my </B>
<P><B>new house.  I moved in with my boyfriend here in December of last year,
and </B>
<P><B>even though he is definitely NOT into the paranormal, he too has seen
and </B>
<P><B>felt some stuff.  When we first moved in, it was just little stuff,
like the </B>
<P><B>water faucet turning on by itself, or the closet doors in the back
room all </B>
<P><B>of a sudden being open when we had just seen them closed five minutes
ago, </B>
<P><B>or just the feeling of being watched.  It never scared us, because
the </B>
<P><B>presence didn't feel mean or anything.  Well, I started not liking
it as </B>
<P><B>much when I started having nightmares in our bedroom.  The first one
was </B>
<P><B>that ghosts were diving down at me from the ceiling, and although it
doesn't </B>
<P><B>sound scary telling it, it was one of the most frightening dreams of
my </B>
<P><B>life.  I slept in the living room for the rest of that night.  I didn't
</B>
<P><B>think much of it (everyone has nightmares once in awhile.)  But then
I </B>
<P><B>started having nightmares about ghosts like every other night.  And
they </B>
<P><B>only happened when I slept in our bedroom.  The dream that really freaked
me </B>
<P><B>was that I was sleeping, and a lady (who I knew was a ghost) dressed
all in </B>
<P><B>white woke me up.  I was really happy to see her for some reason, and
she </B>
<P><B>took my hand and started leading me towards our kitchen.  All of a
sudden I </B>
<P><B>knew that she was dangerous and evil, and since she was walking backwards,
</B>
<P><B>pulling me with her, I made her walk onto our heating vent on the floor.
 </B>
<P><B>She burnt her feet (??? I know ghosts probably can't do that) and she
got </B>
<P><B>really mad and left.  After that, I convinced my boyfriend to turn
our </B>
<P><B>bedroom into the computer room and we took over the back room.  For
awhile </B>
<P><B>while we were rearranging, we slept on a mattress on our living room
floor.  </B>
<P><B>For a couple nights in a row, our front door (which when shut is very
sturdy </B>
<P><B>and doesn't just blow open) would open very slowly, creaking the whole
time, </B>
<P><B>and then slam shut.  My boyfriend and I watched it for quite awhile,
and </B>
<P><B>also noticed that the whole time it was happening there was a dark
blobby </B>
<P><B>blotch hovering above the door.  I've also heard my name called and
numerous </B>
<P><B>"Pssst!" when no one else was home, but other than that, things have
calmed </B>
<P><B>down a little.  But now my boyfriend and I have moved back into our
old </B>
<P><B>bedroom because we have a baby on the way (due July 27th!) and she
gets the </B>
<P><B>back bedroom.  So who knows what will happen?</B>
<P><B>                    </B>

<P><B>Our Ghost</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: JDDONULT@worldnet.att.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Hi!,</B>
<P><B>I hope you don't think we are crazy, or making these things up.  My
husband</B>
<P><B>and I truely believe that  we have a ghost living in our home.  We
don't</B>
<P><B>notice him every day, but there have been several instances over the
past</B>
<P><B>few years that have convinced us that we are not imagining what is</B>
<P><B>happening.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We have been living in our home for  4 1/2 years.  We built this home
from</B>
<P><B>the ground up, and no one but my husband and my children have lived
here. </B>
<P><B>We also have 2 dogs and a cat, so initially some of the things we
thought</B>
<P><B>we heard were easily dismissed as one of the girls doing something
or one</B>
<P><B>of animals in another room. What really gets eerie is when the cat
hears</B>
<P><B>the same things we do.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I guess my husband and I started believing that we may really have
a ghost</B>
<P><B>sometime last year.  Our youngest daughter moved out of the house,
leaving</B>
<P><B>just my husband and myself, and the noises we heard just couldn't be</B>
<P><B>explained any longer.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We live in a two story house.  One night last year, shortly after
Kellie</B>
<P><B>had moved out we heard a tremendous "thud" upstairs in the bedroom
Kellie</B>
<P><B>use to occupy.</B>
<P><B>When Kellie lived at home she would drop her books from the bed to
the</B>
<P><B>floor creating the same noise.  It is an unmistakable sound.</B>
<P><B>I ran upstairs to the room, but of course no one was there and there
were</B>
<P><B>no books or any thing on the floor. The floor was clear, and no</B>
<P><B>explaination of the cause of the noise.  This was way louder than the
house</B>
<P><B>settling or any other explaination we have tried to use.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>The floors creak in several of the rooms when you walk on them.  The
worst</B>
<P><B>room is the master bedroom, and you cannot walk through it without
the</B>
<P><B>floors making a creaking noise.  You can hear it downstairs in the
family</B>
<P><B>room.  One saturday afternoon I had a headache and went upstairs to
lay</B>
<P><B>down for awhile in the bedroom.</B>
<P><B>My husband heard the floors creaking in our room and assumed that I
had</B>
<P><B>gotten up and went to the window to look outside.  He actually could
hear</B>
<P><B>the pattern of the footsteps walking over to the window.  When he
came</B>
<P><B>upstairs, of course I was still sound asleep. He immediately asked
me if I</B>
<P><B>had gotten up, but I hadn't, nor had I heard anything.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We (my husband, myself and even the cat) often hear the doors open
and</B>
<P><B>close, go to look to see if someone is there, and find nothing.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have several other instances, but unfortunely I don't have the time
to</B>
<P><B>share them now.  I will try to contact you later.  Some of the
situations</B>
<P><B>involve the pets, and other people.  Its a family joke, about the ghost.
</B>
<P><B>Oh by the way I live in Tampa FL.</B>
<P><B>I will send more when I have time!!!!</B>

<P>
<P><B>You want a "ghost" story?  Well, I'll give you one.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I've been working overseas for 15 years and along the way, I picked
up a</B>
<P><B>Brasilian wife and we now have a 5 year old son.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Last Christmas, we all visited my 94 year old grandmother at her home
in the</B>
<P><B>USA.  Grandma had been very sick during November and quite frankly,
we were</B>
<P><B>afraid that it would be her last Christmas.  Naturally, we had the
normal</B>
<P><B>comings and goings of family visitors and friends.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Of course, the living room is the main "gathering" place and everyone
was</B>
<P><B>busy talking and watching football when my son asked me (in
Portuguese,</B>
<P><B>thank goodness), "who is the old man sitting in that chair"? </B>
<P>
<P><B>My son was pointing to my grandfather's chair...Grandpa's been dead
since</B>
<P><B>1982.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Oh yeah, Grandma's doing fine!!!</B>

<P><B>Ghost Encounter</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: sbarn@iaw.on.ca</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>There was this old house that was boarded up and my sister and I
thought</B>
<P><B>that it would be neat to go inside and check it out. The first time
we went</B>
<P><B>in it was almost dark and we felt a little bit weird, we just had
these</B>
<P><B>weird feelings and we got a little freaked out so we decided to come
back</B>
<P><B>the next day and when we did we brought our camera. While I was outside
my</B>
<P><B>sister was checking out the house and there was this old chair that
she fell</B>
<P><B>in love with that she was sitting in. While she was sitting there she
said</B>
<P><B>that this was when she was encountered by the ghost. The ghost looked
like a</B>
<P><B>young girl maybe 7 or 8 years old. My sister got scared and she
satyed</B>
<P><B>completely still. As she sat in the chair with the camera in her lap
she</B>
<P><B>tried to take a picture but she was too scared to move. She says that
the</B>
<P><B>girl took the camera tooka picture of her and then through the camera
and</B>
<P><B>disapeered. When she hurried outside to tell me I didn't beleave her.
I said</B>
<P><B>that we should just get the film and see if the picture was there.
We took</B>
<P><B>the film and got it developed  suer enough there was a picture of my
sister</B>
<P><B>sitting on the chair all crouched up with this look on her face, she
wasn't</B>
<P><B>even really looking at the camera. To this day it freaks us out.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Family Ghost Stories</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>By: JACamero@aol.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>I have a few stories to relate to you, they are all very true and have
all </B>
<P><B>happened within my immediate family.  They were told to me by my mother
and </B>
<P><B>aunt, two of them are first-hand accounts.</B>
<P>
<P><B>In the early 1960's, before I was born, my mother and my sister moved
into </B>
<P><B>the house that they lived in when I was born a few years later.  My
mom was </B>
<P><B>recently divorced and raising my sister alone on a cashiers salary.
 She had </B>
<P><B>just met my father.  Needless to say, she didn't have much money and
couldn't </B>
<P><B>afford a telephone.  They didn't even own one and there was not even
one in </B>
<P><B>the house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>But yet, the odd thing was they would periodically hear one ringing
in the </B>
<P><B>house.  I asked my mom if maybe it wasn't one of the neighbor's phones
</B>
<P><B>ringing and she said definately not; it was the distinct sound of one
ringing </B>
<P><B>right there in the house.  She said that she and my sister would hear
it </B>
<P><B>ringing during the night and would lie in bed and count the rings.
 This was </B>
<P><B>in the mid 1960's, way before the era of answering machines or cell
phones.</B>
<P>
<P><B>While she was dating my father, he often would hear the mystery phone
ringing </B>
<P><B>in the house also, this would drive them nuts and they would search
the small </B>
<P><B>house (which only had 2 bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen and one
bathroom, </B>
<P><B>there was no basement and no attic) from top to bottom and find nothing
to </B>
<P><B>account for this odd occurance.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When my mom and dad got married, they finally had a phone installed
and never </B>
<P><B>noticed this occurance again.  They moved out of that house the summer
after </B>
<P><B>I  was born, in August 1967.  The house is still there, and I wonder
if </B>
<P><B>anyone else ever noticed this strange phenomena??</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Another family story involves my maternal grandmother, whom I never
met, she </B>
<P><B>died tragically when my mother was just 9 years old.  She already had
6 </B>
<P><B>children when her 7th one was born.  This was a son, who developed
pnemonia </B>
<P><B>when he was only a couple of weeks old.  This was in the early 1930's
when </B>
<P><B>money was tight and they had no electricity, phone or running water.
 They </B>
<P><B>lived in the country and didn't have money for a doctor.  One night,
my </B>
<P><B>grandmother was awakened in the middle of the night by a small light
in the </B>
<P><B>upper corner of the bedroom (remember, the house wasn't even wired
for </B>
<P><B>electricity).  As she gazed at this light, she saw a small "being"
emerge </B>
<P><B>from the center of the it.  She said it resembled a small baby with
wings.  </B>
<P><B>It flew around all four corners of the room, making a beckoning gesture
with </B>
<P><B>it's finger, and once it completed one circuit of the room, it flew
back out </B>
<P><B>of the illuminated corner and the light extinguished.  My grandmother
didn't </B>
<P><B>know what to make of this, and eventually went back to sleep.  The
next </B>
<P><B>morning, she found her baby was dead.  From that moment on, she "knew"
that </B>
<P><B>this was an angle who had come to call her son up to Heaven.  She was
at </B>
<P><B>peace with his passing and knew he was with God.  Whether or not that
was </B>
<P><B>what it was, she believed it in her heart and it brought her peace;
that's </B>
<P><B>all that really matters.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Now, my final story.  I had already told you that my mother's mother
passed </B>
<P><B>when my mom was only 9.  After her death, the 6 children were split
up and </B>
<P><B>sent to different aunts and uncles to stay, as her father had cancer
and was </B>
<P><B>too sick to care for the children.  It happend that one night shortly
after </B>
<P><B>their mother's death, my mother and one sister were staying with the
same </B>
<P><B>aunt and uncle along with their only brother.  They, too,  were a poor
family </B>
<P><B>with many children of their own and the kids all slept in the same
room with </B>
<P><B>two beds.  The girls in one and the boys in the other.  That night
my aunt </B>
<P><B>awoke in the middle of the night and looked around to see what had
roused </B>
<P><B>her.  She then noticed a lady at the bedroom window.  She at first
thought it </B>
<P><B>was her aunt and opened her mouth to call to her, when she noticed
that her </B>
<P><B>"aunt" was hovering a good foot off the floor with no feet.  The figure
</B>
<P><B>turned from the window and "floated" over to the boys' bed, leaned
over it </B>
<P><B>and looked at her brother, then it turned and "floated" over towards
the </B>
<P><B>girls' bed.  At this point my aunt became so terrified that she pulled
the </B>
<P><B>covers up over her head and cowered closer to my mother, who didn't
wake up.  </B>
<P><B>When she dared to peek out again, the being had left.  The next morning
she </B>
<P><B>told her aunt about this, she "assured" her that it was probably only
a </B>
<P><B>dream.  I've heard my mother tell this story many times since I was
a little </B>
<P><B>girl and heard my aunt tell it to me also; and untill the day my aunt
died, </B>
<P><B>she swears that she wasn't asleep when this happened and it wasn't
a dream.  </B>
<P><B>In her heart, she felt it was the spirit of her mother who couldn't
rest </B>

<P><B>Grandfather's Spirit</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: cherig@twave.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>My experience with ghosts happened the night before my grandfather
died. I was 12 years old </B>
<P><B>when he past away. My mother and I was spending the night at my </B>
<P><B>grandfather's house because he was in the hospital not expecting to
live. </B>
<P><B>It was late at night and I woke up from a sound sleep; seeing a dark
figure of a </B>
<P><B>man standing at the bedroom door. Immediatley I thought it was my </B>
<P><B>gradfather. I laid my head back down on the pillow and fell back </B>
<P><B>asleep. The next morning I went into the kitchen to see my grandfather
</B>
<P><B>but, he wasn't there. I was disappointed to find out that he was still
in </B>
<P><B>the hospital. That afternoon, my cousin came by to tell my mother and
I </B>
<P><B>that my grandfather died. For many years I just figured that it was
all a </B>
<P><B>dream until today, I was talking to another cousin of mine. We were
</B>
<P><B>talking about my grandfather and I happened to mention my experience
the night </B>
<P><B>before he died and she said that the same thing happened to her. The
more </B>
<P><B>I think about it, I believe it was my grandfather's spirit and I think
that he </B>
<P><B>was checking on his grandchildren before he crossed over. </B>

<P><B>Shaking Bed</B>
<P>

<P>
<P><B>About 12 years ago I had been seeing a gentleman who practiced Buddhism.
 We</B>
<P><B>saw each other for a month or so.  He kept pressuring me for deeper
intimacy</B>
<P><B>which I continually denied him.  I just was not interested.  We
stopped</B>
<P><B>seeing each other and when we did he wrote me a letter saying how I
would</B>
<P><B>grow to be old and lonely because I couldn't face my own sexuality...
etc.</B>
<P><B>It was a very bitter letter indeed.</B>
<P>
<P><B>He had always told me that he had special "powers" with regards to
the</B>
<P><B>religion he practiced.  I really never thought much of it until one
day I</B>
<P><B>was stopped at a traffic light with my then "future husband" in his
new</B>
<P><B>truck.  The old Buddhist boyfriend turns right in front of us and sees
the</B>
<P><B>two of us together.  As he passed I could see the red starting at his</B>
<P><B>shoulders up to the top of his head.  It looked like he could explode
from</B>
<P><B>anger.</B>
<P>
<P><B>That night my fianc&eacute;e and I are laying in bed and the smoke
detector went</B>
<P><B>off.  It was between 10:00 and 11:00 pm.  The time that the previous</B>
<P><B>boyfriend used to "chant".  Anyway, my fianc&eacute;e runs down the
stairs to check</B>
<P><B>things out.  The alarm sounded for only a few seconds.  While he was</B>
<P><B>downstairs there was an oval shaped area between where he and I were
laying</B>
<P><B>that was violently vibrating.  I put my hand on the area and my hand
shook.</B>
<P><B>I placed my hand on a different part of the bed and it was still. 
I was</B>
<P><B>very freaked out.  When my fianc&eacute;e returned to bed he said there
wasn't</B>
<P><B>anything that he could see that would have set off the alarm.  I then
had</B>
<P><B>him put his hand on the "area"  his hand shook as well.  After a few
moments</B>
<P><B>it subsided.  Neither one of us could explain what had happened.</B>

<P><B>A Ghosty Story</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: dbzkfreaky2k@yahoo.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>  Ok, this happened to me when I was very little, I</B>
<P><B>don't remember it, but my brothers and sisters</B>
<P><B>constantly remind me of it.  Here's the story.  (the</B>
<P><B>names are changed)</B>
<P>
<P><B>  One day, I was playing outside, I was probably 3 or 4</B>
<P><B>at the time.  Well, my sister says that I ran to the</B>
<P><B>corner of the yard, and started talking to someone. </B>
<P><B>They said that I said his name was Lance.  He was my</B>
<P><B>'imangaiery' friend. </B>
<P><B>  I would play w/ him constantly.  I'd do stuff wrong,</B>
<P><B>and tell people that Lance told me to do it.</B>
<P><B>  I started to light candles, and play weird games</B>
<P><B>with Lance, I'd tie up my two year old brother, and</B>
<P><B>draw things on his face.</B>
<P><B>  </B>
<P><B>my mom and dad were getting really worried, and then</B>
<P><B>one day, I was in the kitchen, doing one of Lance's</B>
<P><B>chores, when my mom walked in and screamed.  She said</B>
<P><B>that she saw a white, 15 year old looking guy above</B>
<P><B>me.  We moved and that was the end of the Lance.</B>

<P><B>Ghost...or Imagination?</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: KoRnMoNkEy_317@webtv.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>First let me tell you about myself.....I'm a 14 year old boy,I live
on</B>
<P><B>an army base with my Mom,Step-dad,3 brothers &amp; 1 sister.  People
tell me</B>
<P><B>that I have a very wild imagination,so I'm not sure if this story is
my</B>
<P><B>imagination or if it's really a ghost that likes to bother me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>You see I just moved down here from Oklahoma, and I have already had</B>
<P><B>what I think are expeiences with a ghost of some sort. It started
about</B>
<P><B>the second or third week of living here.    </B>
<P><B>It started when I was lying on my bed, all I was wearing was a pair
 of</B>
<P><B>shorts and with me living in Arizona it gets pretty hot (even at
night.)</B>
<P><B>Well anyways I was lying down and all of a sudden I felt a cold spot
at</B>
<P><B>my feet,the window was shut &amp; the air conditioner was'nt turned
on at</B>
<P><B>all, after a few minutes if getting used to it I just shrugged it off</B>
<P><B>and tried to go to sleep. After about another minute of having the
cold</B>
<P><B>spot at my feet,it started to moveslowly up to my chest. When that</B>
<P><B>happened of I got scared and left out of my room and ran to the
living</B>
<P><B>room. When I finally hot the courage to go back to my room....I laid</B>
<P><B>back down and tried to forget about the whole thing. </B>
<P>
<P><B>That wasn't the only experience that I've had with this "ghost". I
was</B>
<P><B>in my room about a week later with my headphones on full blast. I was</B>
<P><B>listening to the loudest cd I could find, all of a sudden I heard</B>
<P><B>someone call my name. I looked around my room (my little brother
likes</B>
<P><B>to hide under the beds) but didn't find anyone, after a few more
minutes</B>
<P><B>of waiting, I went back to my cd. I kept hearing a voice call my name</B>
<P><B>like five times before  got up and ran out to where my mom was. She</B>
<P><B>asked me what was wrong and I told her, but as I told you people say
I</B>
<P><B>have a wild imagination,so she didn't believe me and said it was my</B>
<P><B>imagination. So I just forgot about it and slept in the living room.
</B>
<P>
<P><B>My last experience happened when I was at the computer. I like to
stay</B>
<P><B>up late (now that school is finally out) and talk to people in chat</B>
<P><B>rooms. Well I was in this one chat room when I was  talking to a
friend</B>
<P><B>who is always on. We were talking about experiences with ghosts and</B>
<P><B>everything when all of a sudden  the screen flashed and it went back
to</B>
<P><B>my homepage. I though that there was just some kind of  bug in the</B>
<P><B>computer or something, so I ignored it. I went back to the chat room
 and</B>
<P><B>my friend asked me what happened &amp; I told her. She told me that
she had</B>
<P><B>a ghost that likes to play around and mess with the computer while
she's</B>
<P><B>on it (especially when she's in a chat room.)</B>
<P><B>After a while the screen flashed again and it showed a website titled</B>
<P><B>"Vampires" and  Ijust freaked and turned off the computer. </B>
<P>
<P><B>The last experience kinda proves that it wasn't my imagination but
the</B>
<P><B>other 2 I'm not sure of.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Thanks for taking the time to read my story.</B>

<P><B>Strange Experience</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: BRGil@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>This happened about 8 years ago, to me it was very strange I happen
to</B>
<P><B>live on a Indian Reservation in Southern Calif.</B>
<P><B>Well one night me and two of friends drove to the store and we only
have</B>
<P><B>one road on our Reservation and must pass by a church that is on our</B>
<P><B>Reservation well on the way back from the store we saw a girl
standing</B>
<P><B>under a pepper tree that is next to our church and she appeared to
be</B>
<P><B>only wearing a long white t-shirt and she stood there motionless with</B>
<P><B>her arms crossed around her chest, when my friends and I drove past
her</B>
<P><B>we did not recognize who she was and thought that she might be in
some</B>
<P><B>kind of trouble so we turned around to ask her if she needed any help</B>
<P><B>but for some reason we got really spooked at the last minute cause
the</B>
<P><B>closer we got to her she stil stood there motionless so we just kept
on</B>
<P><B>going the funny thing was not one of us got a look at her face.  Well</B>
<P><B>about I would say a half an hour a friend came walking up to our
house</B>
<P><B>and asked why we didn't stop to give him a ride because we past right
by</B>
<P><B>him at the church and we told him because we didn't see him and we
asked</B>
<P><B>him if he seen anybody standing under the pepper tree near the church</B>
<P><B>and he said no he didn't but as he was walking past the church he
could</B>
<P><B>hear a women crying for help some where around there. He said that
he was going to</B>
<P><B>see where it was coming from but decided not to so we all decided to
go</B>
<P><B>and check it out well we couldn't see or find anything or anybody we
even</B>
<P><B>stopped to ask a person who lives near the church if they had heard</B>
<P><B>anything and they said that they did and also went to check it out
and</B>
<P><B>found or seen anything, but this person said that this was not the
first</B>
<P><B>time the crying for help was heard, so till this day I spoked when
I</B>
<P><B>drive past the church at night</B>
<P>
<P><B>Who are YOU?</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: tigeriz@hawaii.rr.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>My fianc&eacute;e, 'J' (I'll just call him that </B>
<P><B>here), and his family live in a home on the nursing home where his
mother is a </B>
<P><B>nurse at. Because of this, I found it interesting that in </B>
<P><B>thesix years that we had dated, I noticed that they don't seem to have
any </B>
<P><B>hauntings. But it could be because it's affiliated with a Catholic
church </B>
<P><B>in the area. I'm usually sensitive about these things as I have mentioned
</B>
<P><B>before and would know it quickly if there was any ghosts hanging </B>
<P><B>out. Well, wouldn't you know it, that changed last </B>
<P><B>year!I just stopped by 'J's home to drop off something </B>
<P><B>one warm afternoon and stayed for alittle while to chat. While I was
</B>
<P><B>walking back to my car, I started to feel uneasy. The sensation got
</B>
<P><B>stronger as I got to my car so I started to walk slower. I stopped
in </B>
<P><B>front of my car and stared at it because there was this </B>
<P><B>overwhelming feeling that something or someone was in my car. I </B>
<P><B>peered in to all the windows...nothing... So I disengaged the locks
with the </B>
<P><B>remote like I usually do and peered in one more time. The feeling was
</B>
<P><B>intense! This feeling is always a strong pressure in my head </B>
<P><B>accompanied by the edges of my vision clouding a little.(I get this
feeling </B>
<P><B>whenever a spirit is near.And I later found out, for premonitions of
danger) I </B>
<P><B>slowly sat down in the driver's seat and looked over my shoulder. Nothing.
</B>
<P><B>But...something. When I looked forward, I looked in my rearview mirror.
Nothing. </B>
<P><B>But then something. My vision clouded a little more and then I started
to see </B>
<P><B>her in my mind's eye. An older Korean woman, very stern looking with
an </B>
<P><B>air of authority. Leaning forward at me. A little on the chubby side
but </B>
<P><B>not fat. In her 50's.She was wearing a floral dress.  Short tightly
permed </B>
<P><B>black hair. Amazingly enough, I was calm. I should have been freaking
out </B>
<P><B>but I didn't. As I started up the car and began driving toward the
</B>
<P><B>exit (clouded vision and all!), I got the feeling that she was asking
who I was </B>
<P><B>and what was I doing there. It was in an authoritarian tone like a
person </B>
<P><B>who catches a stranger on their property and wants to know who it is
</B>
<P><B>. I ignored her because I figured that if she belonged here, she would
</B>
<P><B>disappear as soon as I passed the exit gates but she didn't. However,
the </B>
<P><B>feeling did lessen its grip a little, just enough for me to see where
I was </B>
<P><B>driving. She was still asking the same questions. So I said aloud in
a calm </B>
<P><B>voice, "I have a right to be there. I was visiting. But you don't belong
here </B>
<P><B>anymore. You are dead and you need to pass on." Abruptly the feeling
was gone </B>
<P><B>and I hadn't noticed that the air in my car was thick until she left.
The air as </B>
<P><B>well as my vision had become normal.That night,'J' and his sister came
over. </B>
<P><B>Later in the evening, I nonchalauntly asked if anyone died recently
at the care </B>
<P><B>home. He said 'no' but then his sister said 'Well, actually, the nursing
home </B>
<P><B>director died a couple of days ago of cancer".I asked how old was she.
</B>
<P><B>She said that the director was in her 60's. I asked if she was a little
</B>
<P><B>chubby but not fat. 'J' said that she was skinny but that he thinks
it was </B>
<P><B>because of the cancer. I asked what she looked like about 10 years
ago. 'J' s </B>
<P><B>description of the woman matched my 'passenger'! They proceeded to
go on </B>
<P><B>about what a stern woman she was and how she never seemed to cut their
</B>
<P><B>poor, hardworking mother any slack, making her work all holidays and
such.</B>
<P><B>Then he stopped and asked "Why?" I just turned away and went "Oh, nothing."
When </B>
<P><B>he pressed, I turned and looked him straight in the eye and said "You
don't want </B>
<P><B>to know." he knew not to press on because he was a chicken when it
came to the </B>
<P><B>supernatural! I've been back countless times after that and </B>
<P><B>haven't felt her again. I hope that she did pass </B>
<P><B>on.    </B>
