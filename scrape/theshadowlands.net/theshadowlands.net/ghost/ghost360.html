<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hi my name is
Diana im a 55 year old mother of five great children. I live in Toronto
Ontairo, When i was 15 years old me and my family moved to a house on duffrin
st. this house had three floors 2 bedrooms were on the 3rd floor. three on the
second floor the house was very big and my parents kept it very clean even with
5 children. my self and my brothers had experinced many strange things in this
house between the 7 years i lived there. For exaple one day i was singing a
song and tapeing it on a tape recorder. i was singing " My Love Is Gone My
Pride Is Gone I Care No More". no one was in the house at that time exept
for my self. when i played the song back to hear my self singing a mans voice
followed mine in a deep deep voice i was very scaed i was home alone. when my
parents came home i played it for them we just could not beleive what we were
hearing that was just one of the many things that happend. onther thing that
happend was there was three diffrent times when we would have a visitor in the
middle of the nite. one man and two wemon. my mother was very strong minded and
they always seemed to go to her room and they would ask her.. if they could
spend the nite. she would always anser "let me go ask my son he is on the
3rd floor". i remember this so clearly because i was so terrfide i went
into shock stared shacking and couldent move to go help my mom. my mother would
go to the 3rd floor to get my brother and by the time he got down stairs there
wouldent be anybody around, he would run out the door look out to the street
but there was no one there. i couldent believe wat was going on in the house i
met my husband in 1970 we slept in the front bedroom on the 2nd floor these are
the things that happend to me in that bedroom. i woke up one nite with such a
force to my stomch it was like some one has taken there foot and kicked me so
hard i pushed my husdban off the bed thinking he had struck me. He thought i
was crazy and asked me why i pushed him off the bed. i told him i thought he
had kicked me but he had been sleeping so it wasent him. onther nite i woke up
with my hands on my throat choking my self i was thinking why would i be
chokeing my self like that?.many other things had happen to me in this house. i
wishh i could tell you more but my son dousent want to write he is to tired he
wants to go to bed. we moved out after i had my first son, my mother and father
had the chance to buy the house for 50,000$ but refused to buy it because we
believed it was haunted. we leared later the the owner of the house also had
experieced the same kinda things we did. the house was sold guess?who???? bout
the house? nuns and priest. i went back 2 years ago to look at the house it
still looked the same from the outside and the back yard was just as nice as it
was in the 70s. i wanted to knock on the door but i dident i thought that maybe
the nuns wouldent let me go in and look around..(i was a little afraid.)
because what was ever in this house was maybe after me, for what reson i dont
know. I think that its to bad that no one ever investigated for any ghost in
that house. maybe if anybody reads this they mite go to the house if uwant to
contact me email me at ekli9@hotmail.com thx for reading hope u liked it. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Well my sister, my boyfriend and myself have been reading
many stories of different cry baby bridges, and happend to find one about 30
minutes from us in Viola, Illinois. The story behind this one is that a school
bus full of children went off the bride into a deep creek and drown. If you go
to the bridge put your car in neutral and shut off the engine they will push
you across the bridge to make sure you get across okay. So we decided to drive
out there. We did as the instructions said and it worked, but not only did they
push us across the bridge put they were controlling the steering and pushed us
up the hill and around a curve until we were about a half of a mile away from
the bridge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say we were
convinced it worked. Along with the story came a warning not to get out of the
car or roll down the windows. My sister figured that when they stopped pushing
it was safe to get out and see if she could see hand prints. My boyfriend and I
decided to stay in the car. She said there were finger prints and we drove back
to the main road. Once there we all got out and looked and the hand prints.
About 30 mles back towards home my boyfriend had to use the restroom, since we
were out in the middle of no where we stopped on the side of the raod and he
did his thing. About five minutes later water marks started appearing on the
insdie of the car windows and my boyfriend said he felt very cold. i reached
into the back seat to hold his hand and his pants were soaking wet like he
stepped into a lake or creek. At first we laughed and said he peed his pants,
but his pants were way to wet and it was ice cold with no odor. After we got
into town my boyfriend complained of a haed ache and chest pain I turned around
to ask if he was okay and he freaked out and started screaming that a dead man
was in the car. He swore he saw the face of a dead man in mine. I have no idea
how to explain this and although i am not scarred I wonder if the real reason
why they push you across the bridge is because they do not want anyone there to
begin with and they say not to open your doors because the spirits will try to
get the hell out of there!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I beleive you may be right on the childhood and seeing
ghosts at a young age. My sister has a friend in the playroom it was a little
girl and my sister used to play and put cups of water out for her and her
friend. Me and my cousins like 10 at the time (16 now, her 3). Well last year
my aunt was going through a divorce and we had her room in the play room and re
did it put her bed and such in there, well to cut to it one night she had waken
up around 2:00am and there was a girl at the foot of her bed. She thought it
was my little sister and said <st1:City><st1:place>Taylor</st1:place></st1:City>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>I lived in Hawaii,
when I was young, and they had evicted the families that lived in houses that
had been there ( some from the early 1910's) for generations.When the statred
to renovate the land to start building ( In Hawaii, the custom is that the
Aina:land, must approve of any buildings being built upon it. If that isen't
done , bad things are said to happen. How ever in this case a Clergy was
brought in, and the blessings began. As soon as he started however, a Tutu, an
old wise woman or healer for the family, came onto the property, and started
with a mele to curse anyone who lived on/ or built on the land. She and her
family where the very ones evictedfrom that land. Now 2 decades later there
have more strange deaths, murders, and other violent occrances then anywhere
else on the <st1:place>Island</st1:place>. They say it is all because of the
curse that the Tutu put on the aina.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I've been reading the stories on your site for quite some
time now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've had several things happen
to me in the past that I could never quite explain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being brought up in a Christian home, we were
taught that there was no such things as ghosts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Despite that, I've always been fascinated by ghost stories, horror
movies, etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It wasn't until I got a bit
older, however, that anything noteworthy ever happened, and even when it did, I
was still in "ghost denial".</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My first experience with the paranormal occured when I was
17 or 18.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My best friend's mother had
been hit by a car crossing a busy street.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My friend had always told me her mom was haunting her house, watching
over her family, but I didn't believe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
is, until one night when I had spent the night there and met her for myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was sleeping on the couch in the living
room which is right next to the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The two rooms are connected by an archway, with no door in between.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't tell you what time it was, but I'd
been sleeping soundly and woke up to the sound of water running in the
kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was completely dark, so I
couldn't see anything, but assumed it was her older brother up getting a drink
of water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the water kept
running for several minutes, and I heard no other noises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I got up and turned on the light and
discovered that the kitchen was empty, but the water was running full
blast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I walked in to shut it off, only
to have the cabinet doors fly open and close by themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ok...... now we're a little bit freaked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told my friend the next morning and she
just laughed and told me that "mom is welcoming you to the
family!".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few days later she made
her presence known again by causing a drawer to come flying out of a desk when
we were no less than 10 feet away from it.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fast forward about
3 years... My mother had just passed away after a lengthy illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a hot sunny day in late August.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My dad had gone to visit his sister in
another state because he had to get away, "too many memories", he
said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in the process of scrubbing
down the walls and windows in the living room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had gone into the kitchen to dump the dirty scrub water down the
kitchen sink.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The living room door was
open and sunlight was flooding the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I got a feeling like someone was there, even though I didn't hear
anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned around and in the
rchway between the kitchen and living room (remember it was a bright sunny day)
was a shadow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't discern who or
what it was, male, female, whatever, but whatever it was was hovering just
outside the kitchen, halfway into the hallway that goes towards the
bedrooms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said "Mom???" at
which point all the hair on the back of my neck stood up on end, and I proceded
to watch this "thing" float down the hallway and into my dad's
bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was slightly freaked out,
being home by myself and all, but I got over it... until that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was getting ready to go to bed, making sure
everything was all locked up when I looked out the kitchen window to notice the
garage door was up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remembered closing
it earlier when I'd got back from the store.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So I hit the button on the garage door opener and watched the door
close.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned around for a split
second to get a glass of water, looked back out the window, and the garage door
was open again!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got a flashlight and went
out to make sure nothing was in the way that would make it go back up, then
closed it again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I finally got to bed
(ignoring the whole door issue - refused to think about it).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After turning out the light I noticed a funny
glowing type thing in the corner of my room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Having had enough, and still refusing to believe in ghosts, I said
"Ok that's enough.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whoever you are,
you're dead and you don't belong here anymore, go away".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I'm still
fascinated with ghost stories, and still wonder if I'm ever going to experience
anything else, but at the same time, my 6 year old son shares my love of scary
movies, etc., and to keep him from having bad dreams, etc, I tell him
"ghosts, monsters, vampires... they're just stories, they don't exist."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm sure he'll have his own experiences some
day for himself, then he can make up his own mind.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">well let me start out by saying i really really enjoy your
site and i hope you will put my story</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">on it which is true.one evening i was playing with my dog
britney outside and my mother told me to put her up and thats when i noticed
her collar was missing but i decided to tie her up any way since i didnt know
where her collar was and it was getting darkso after i tied her up i went
inside for about 20 minutes and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i
started to wonder why my mom had not come inside yet and at that moment i knew
something was wrong so i went out the front door and i called out to my mom and
she told me to go back inside and i said why but she still told to just go back
inside now i got a sickening feeling that something had happened to britney i
was 11 around this time and i happened to be very close to my dog.i went back
inside and started pacing around when my mom finally came inside i could tell
by the way she looked that something was seriously wrong.i went to bed soon
after because it was a school night and when i woke up in the morning i was
suprised that it was 10:00 since my mom usually woke me up around 6:00 to get
ready for school .i found my little 5 year old brother my sister who was 9 or
ten at the time and my mother in the front room my mother told us all to sit
down on the couch so we sat down and the bad feeling returned sending a wave of
terror through me.my mom then told me that britney had died and i could feel
the color drain out of my face then i said no your lying she cant be dead your
joking around when my mother replied no in a very serious voice i started to
cry then i asked her how still sobbing my mother told me she strangled her self
on the wire i had tied her to i sobbed for a while and visited the place where
y mom had layed her to rest at a few days after this incident i was still very
depressed i noticed that when i was walking outside i could hear panting behind
me and at fist i was confused but then i knew it was britney i smiled and then
told my mom about it.i also have felt like my dog was laying on my legs why i
was in my bedroom laying on my bed and i sterted to talk to britney telling her

<p class="MsoNormal">July 4th Visitor</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: dragon4shadowing@yahoo.com </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My family and I moved into an apartment two and a half years
ago. I noticed little things at first. Noise coming from the back bedroom but
nobody else is in the house. Glimpses of someone walking past the door out of
the corner of my eye. I remained open to the fact that I may<span style="">&nbsp; </span>have an occupant sharing the apartment.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This would not be my first experiences with ghosts, so I was
not immediately concerned by the thought of having an unexpected roommate. Most
of the time our roommate is quiet. Car keys sometimes turn up in unexpected
places (such as under the bed covers), a cd or two missing (still wondering
where he put those). </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then things changed. I was sitting on our living room couch
surfing the net on the laptop on July 4th. It was about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00</st1:time> or so, my husband was in the bedroom reading and I
had the lights off so I could watch the fireworks. Light was coming from the
computer, a little light from outside and a little from the bedroom. I saw what
I thought was my husband come into the room and stand about 5 feet in front of
me and look out the window about 3 feet in front of him. I thought he had come
to watch the fireworks. I waited for him to say something but he remained
silent. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After a couple of minutes I said my husbands name out loud,
He answered from the bedroom. I told him nevermind, I'm talking to ghosts. He
said, okay. I continued watching my visitor for a few seconds when he just
faded away. An hour later I put my computer on its side leaning against a
stereo speaker and headed to bed. I was laying in bed with the light on,
thinking about reading a little more when I heard my computer fall over, I
thought the dog or cat may have knocked it over, However the cat was above me
on the window sill and I found the dog laying in the bedroom doorway. The cat
also seemed to be interested in what was happening in the living room. I walked
into the living room and checked on the computers, it was still leaning against
the speaker, just on the opposite side away from all foot traffic. Since my
husband and myself where the only ones home I figured our visitor was nice
enough to put the computer out of harms way.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It's been interesting having our roommate around. I wonder
if we will see him more now. Anyway I thought I would share my story. While I
have my share of scary, weird ghosts stories I thought I'd share a good one for
a change.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Haunting in a Farm House</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: af_kid69@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have only had a few experiences with ghosts, but I
personally was facsinated by them, and i hope people take time to read this. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My family and i live in a one story four bedroom farm house
where we opperate our farm. One summer when my cousin and i were about eight
years old, we decided to have a water fight. There is this really heavy, not to
mention thick glass door on the back side of our house, so i opened it and left
the screen door closed so i could run in the<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>house at any moment if she was about to soak me with water. I ran around
to the other side of the house where she was waiting for me, so i quickly ran
for the side of the house where I and only I had just been so i could sneak off
into the house, because that was the safe zone. When i reached my destination
the screen door was wide open and the heavy sliding glass door was shut. we
were the only ones home, and she was right behind me the whole time. the door
was too heavy for anything like the wind to shut a sliding door. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A few years down the road my brother passed away in a drunk
driving accident. I was fourteen at this time. shortly after his passing, i
woke up at <st1:time minute="18" hour="3">3:18 AM</st1:time> suprised because
this was his time of death just a week before this. I went to the bathroom to
get a glass of water, and on my way<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i
looked out our picture window inside our living room and underneath the porch
light, standing in plain view was my brother, he just smiled at me and then
vanished. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Before he died, he and his wife were about to get a divorce,
and she played the innocent widow pretty well. I won't get into my dissliking
of her because that is not necessary. Anyway, they produced two beautiful
children in their course of marriage. she decided to move away with them to a
bigger city where we would barely be able to see them. she even rented out the
house my brother built with his own two hands to this woman who would always
try to make him cheat on his wife. Obviously, my brother was not too excited
about this. I guess that a few months after the move, a few weird things began
to happen in the house. The woman's sister was staying with her in that house
and she had a little daughter. The little daughter would claim to see a man
telling her she had to leave the house, when they showed her my brother's
picture she told them that was the man she saw. Everytime they would try to
listen to the radio, the station would change by itself to either a rock
station or a country station, the only kind of music he would listen too, and
it would turn up louder by itself. If someone sat there and held the station
the sterio would completely shut off and could not be turned back on. the final
straw was when the woman's high school graduation picture fell off the wall and
shattered. The nail was secure but some how it was lifted off the wall and fell
to the floor, with everyone sitting in the living room around the picture. They
moved out, and my n hews and thier mother moved back home. We haven't heard
from my brother since, maybe because everything he wanted to happen did. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Two Stories</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: kirstengagne@msn.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Hi, I'm just going to tell you a 2 stories that happened to
me that scares me a lot.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Just about 2 years ago, I moved to a <st1:City><st1:place>new
  city</st1:place></st1:City> and moved into a new neighborhood, school and
everything. Moving into a new house was awesome, and It was a gorgeous house!
First day of school, people found out I lived in the house I'm currently no
longer in, and told me it was haunted and no one ever felt like coming over. I
was thinking right, but, then that's actually when things got creepy. In
through our garadge was wooden stairs leading to the basement. We'll every time
I'd come home for lunch and even when I'd be home all by my self, something
clicky would be heard and I would just freak. Until one day I knew it was
coming from the wooden stairs. I stood by the stairs and all I'd hear was a
click, click, click, and nothing would be there. One day, I got fed up at lunch
time and I told my mother what I'd been hearing at home and school and we were
right beside the stairs. As I'm telling her, she tell's me young brains have
lots of things just fill their mind. I'm thinki , haha mom, not funny. My mom
opens the garadge and their it happens again, the clicking sound once again
heard. My mom freaked and grabbed me and rushed us in the garadge. She told me
to stay there and she took a bat and when in side. I was worried, she just left
me their all by myself. A couple of minutes later I walked inside scared out of
my mind and I headed towards the stairs and went down them and their my mom was
worried. She said she saw nothing. Few days later my mom talked to the owner
{She New Him} and he says, "Weird, my mother died on her birthday on these
stairs, she got a brand new pair of clicking shoe." After that day we
never heard it again.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">And another story happened with me and my brother. We'll, I
was young and was a big chicken so I stood by my brother while my mother left
for groceries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let me start off this
way, my brother would have this small play toy gun and it was his favorite gun
and he'd have it all the time and kept it in his drawer when it wasn't in use.
Back to when me and my brother were sitting at the computer, he's 2 years older
than me, my mom had been gone for a while. We stood there and I was pale just
staring. All of a sudden something started laughing, like a clown and it
sounded as if two clingy things had been banging together, and then I realized
it was the sound of my brothers gun made and I was thinking oh my Lord. My
brother and I started freaking and we ran to the stairs and it got so loud and
then the door handle started moving and it was banging and I ran and opened it
and it was my mom. She asked us why we were so pale when we told her, it wasn't
something she seemed much to care, like we were just children telling our
tales. My brother that night went to get his play gun; it was gone and was
never to be found again.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A lot more of these things have happened, and if you're
interested in some more I can write them up and email you them. We moved out of
that house just down the street and nothings happened to us like that again.
Hope you enjoy my stories!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Well, interestingly enough, I just happen to get done
reading your article about ghosts in <st1:place><st1:City>Yucaipa</st1:City>, <st1:State>CA</st1:State></st1:place>
and guess what.....I live in <st1:place>Yucaipa</st1:place> and have a ghost
too. My older son Adam 26, and his girlfriend Julia 23, plus Floyd 64, all saw
the same ghost. He was a thin man that seemed to float. They followed him from
one room to the other and he vanished. We also have a candle on top of the
family room TV that gets knocked onto the floor every few days for no apparent
reason. We have watching the candle get knocked off as if someone were pushing
it on the floor. It just gets swipped off the TV. Sometimes the TV is on,
sometimes not. My house definately has a ghost but I don't know who this tall,
thin man was. I kind of like it that he's here, it's like having another pet.
Just thought you'd want to know about this since you were in the area checking
it out.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hello, My name is Mike, and I am a resident of <st1:place><st1:City>Staten
  Island</st1:City> <st1:State>Ny</st1:State></st1:place>. Me and my friends,
Mike, and Maria - have used your site for a reference on where to go, and we've
gone to two places so far - and I'd like to share our expierences with you.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Sleepyhollow - Sparta Cemetary: We've been there twice, the
second one being about an hour ago. The first time we went was about 2 weeks
ago, and there is an open gate to get in, but we made a discovery about
something I will tell you in a little bit. The first time we went there, we got
in okay, and we only visited about oh, the first half of the cemetary. We
continued to hear rustling - but tried our best to remain calm. We then came
across two moslueems(spelling?) - my friend Mike decided to go see if they were
open, but he became too creeped out and came back towards me and Maria. While
standing outside of them, we noticed a light from the street shinning through
the trees, making an angel like silhoutte on the building. We all stared at it
for a bit, and Mike mentioned that it looked like an angel, suddenly the light
turned off - kinda creepy. After that we left.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The second time was tonight, there were for of us, Me, Mike,
Our friend Rob, and his girlfriend Steph. We got in the same gate once again,
and we proceeded to explore the same area we did last time. This is where we
made our discovery, and maybe you can post a warning next to this place for
people on the listings - the light we saw last time that came from the street-
making the angel type figure, may be a motion detector, because it shines right
into the cemetary - even tho its far in the street, when we walked the light
turned on. This is when we started to be concerned, we also heard sirens, but
they were ambulances. Then this is where it gets spooky, as we were walking the
road back to the two moselums, I happened to glance through the trees as what
appeared to be a standing silhoutte of a person, then I noticed a hat - shaped
like a police officers - then I tried to show Mike, and he saw it too. But then
I noticed it wasn't moving, when we were leaving, it was a statue on top of a
tombstone. However, when we left, Mike explained to me that what he was looking
at wasn't the statue - it was a shadow, he says. And his decription of the
shadow was the same police type figure, we were both looking at two different
things - but had the same description. I think something there didn't like us,
and was trying to give us an illusion to get out. The other two that were with
us didn't see anything - the only conclusion we could come up with was that
something there remembers us from our last visit, and most likely doesn't want
us there.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Our other adventure - Brewster - The Golf Course/Pond.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We drove up there - there was 6 of us. We drove passed the
pond, and I saw something across the pond that looked like a flashlight being
waved, I don't know what it was - but when we stopped at the gasstation before
we headed over to the pond, someone said "party at the lake tonight."
while purchasing alcohol. We parked up on a street about a mile or two away from
the pond, and we all walked down the road to it. We also had a recorder with us
the entire time to see if we picked up anything we didn't hear. We found a dead
animal on the side of the road, as well as many beer cans. We aslo kept hearing
rustling in the woods as we came to the pond. When we came to the pond, we saw
nothing for about<span style="">&nbsp; </span>10 minutes, so we
walked back to the cars. We began walking faster when we heard a crash in the
woods - and then we got back to the cars, and stopped in front of the golf
course, where I took a picture of the sign - me and Mike were taking picturesat
the same time, and I noticed there is a red orb like structure on the side of
the sign. It's not present in Mike's pictures tho, here is a link to the
picture http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v670/MikemicalRomance/26e6adb6.jpg</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">If you want to use it on the site, tell me - it's find with
me, i'd just like to put a copyright or something of the sort on it. Then
afterwards we found a cemetary nearby, but nothing creepy happened. When we
came back home - we listened to the recordings, we picked up a loud crash, and
two Moaning/Whispered sounds - one being directly said right after Mike said
"That was definitely a noise." </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">So there is a report of our three visits to places, thanks
to your site, we're addicted!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Please write back if you have anything to say.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Personal Experience</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: Unknown</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Mr. Juliano I came across your site and began reading the
many experiences</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">people have had. While my own experince is not really that
of a ghost</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">enconter I still believe that it may relate to some of the
stories. Mine is</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">a premonition.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Growing up in <st1:State><st1:place>Florida</st1:place></st1:State>,
I would visit my step great grandfather. Even though</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">he wasnt truly related to me he was far closer to me then
many of my blood</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">relatives. I remember always seeing him sitting in his
recliner and chewing</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">his tobacco. When i was about 10 I began having strange
dreams. In the dream</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i was walking through a house that was on fire. I was in a
long hallway and</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the flames were on my right side. I was not scared in the
dream more curious</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">than anything else. Every few meters a round gray shape
would raise out of</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the flames and go over my head. This shape would then
dissapear on the left</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">side. I tryed but could not see what was on the left; it was
as though my</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">head wouldnt turn far enough.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I had this dream on and off for over 2 years before it
finally stopped. I</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">didnt have the dream again until I was 14. However this time
the dream was</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">different. I began having it every night for 2-3 monthes
straight. And</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">everytime i saw the shape it was a little bit clearer. One
night i realized</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">it was someone's face though i couldn't make out whose. The
dreams stopped</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">for 2 weeks then i had the dream 2 more times. The last time
I realized it</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">was the face of my step-great grandfather. The next morning
my mom told me</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">that he had died in his sleep.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I thought perhaps it was just my subconcious mind telling me
that he was old</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">and that he would die soon. But when I was 17 I got a book
from a friend and</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">in the book it had a section on dream interpretation. I read
that if you</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">dream of a house on fire then there will be a death in your
family. At that</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">point I remembered all the dreams I had had. I realized that
it was more</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">than just my mind warning me.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have on occasion felt as if someone was with me whenever I
most needed</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">someone to care. I believe that it is him.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I want to thank you so much for taking the time to read
through my story</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Mr.Juliano. I am sure that others feel as I do and I thank
you for having</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">your website to help the rest of us better understand these
strange</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">occurances. If you wish to place my story on your page I
give you my</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">permission. Again thank you so much.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When I was a freshman in high school my Mom and stepdad and
I moved into an older </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">home built sometime in the late 1920's or early 1930's I
assume this from the newspaper I had found </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">dated 1936.When we first moved in ,there wasn't anything odd
things happening not until my stepdad </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">and uncle started putting in rooms upstairs in the loft. One
nite after a long day of swimming with friends </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I decided to go home a take a nap and meet back up with my
buddies later that nite, Well that didn't happen </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I awoke to or whom I thought was my nephew sam tapping me on
the foot, the room was very dark just </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">a small bit of light through the curtains I looked over at
the clock ,it was late around <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00</st1:time>
pm.So I said </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">to whom I thought was my nephew, what are you doing in here
,and where's your mom,you see they lived next door </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">to us,and I asked again with no answer. I got up and turned
on the light...noone was there..OK..I said to myself </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">that was odd..and very reluctantly went to sleep.That wasn't
the end of it one nite I woke up with all my cover off </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the end of the bed,maybe I kicked them off who knows?,I know
because the second time it happened, I was </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">not asleep when I felt the covers slowly pull off of me and
off the end of the bed..can we say ....WTF.....<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">and that's when I slept downstairs on the couch for a few nites
telling my mom it was too hot upstairs to sleep. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A few months had gone by without anything happening ,until
they put another room upstairs in and I moved into that one. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I started hearing sounds on the roof like if someone was
throwing a ball onto the roof and it was bouncing down </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">went on for atleast a good month....Well the ice finally
broke when my Grandmother who had been living with us </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">asked my mom one morning who was standing in her doorway
lastnite my mom said no-one and my </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Grandma replied that it was a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Child and a woman" and that's when
I told them what was happing upstairs. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">strange......</p>

two years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My family and I stayed in
the st.francis inn, which is a bed and breakfast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We stayed in the <st1:City><st1:place>Sanford</st1:place></st1:City>
suite for like, 1 nite, and the lady at the front desk said that her daughter
had babysat there and the kids were playing with those hot wheel toys.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, she said that her daughter called her
up and said that the toys were moving on their own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was sooooo afraid to sleep in that
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, the next two nites, we
stayed in the cottage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was very homey
like and I had no problem with it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
went upstairs to the room I would stay in and I didn&#8217;t feel comfortable at
all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt like someone/something was
watching my sister and I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>so that night
I slept in the pull out couch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
nite, my mom said that late at nite, she heard footsteps coming up the stairs
and into the room my sis and I were supposed to stay in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>everyone was sleeping, so there was no
logical explination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Creepy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the next morning, my mom went to have
breakfast and she was talking to these really nice people that stayed in the
supposedly haunted room, lillys room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is a whole long story to the room, and I don&#8217;t really know the
details.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the couple staying in that
room said that they took some pictures, and in one , there was an armchair from
like, a long time ago against one wall, but it wasn&#8217;t actually there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So they started walking out to the courtyard
next to the cottage and said, &#8220;oh, its just lilly messing around with
stuff&#8221;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as they said lilly, the
light above the cottage door went out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My dad went to check it out, but there was nothing wrong with the
lightbulb.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was freaked out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were gonna leave that very day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom couldn&#8217;t find her car keys or the
cottage room key.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was looking and
she found the car keys on top of the counter and the cottage keys inside the
door we never came in through.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
story is all true from what my mother told me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Very creepy.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: <st1:PersonName>1smallfreak</st1:PersonName>@gmail.com </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Well, to start off with, I can see and talk to dead people.
It sounds crazy, I know, but its the truth. I'm not one of those people that u
see on T.V., but it's pretty much the same thing. I started seeing ghosts when
I was six, when while I was asleep in my bed, I was awaken by what I thought
was my brother walking around, but it turned out to be somebody I didnt know. I
wanted to scream, but I was too terrified.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">At first, he didnt notice me, then he saw me, looked
surprised, and disappeared. I saw footprints just appear in the floor, heading
inside my closet. I've been scared of my closet ever since. I couldnt see who
it was because it was so dark, but the next day, I found out it was a kid.
While walking up the stairs to eat breakfast, I saw him sitting on the steps,
frowning at me. I noticed him, stopped, and I really wanted to scream. I was
just about to let one out, when he put his finger to his lips, signaling me to
be quiet. I didnt want to scare him away so I didnt yell. I smiled, he smiled
back, I blinked, he vanished. At this point, I thought I was going crazy. I
went upstairs, ate my cereal with my family, all the while, he watched. I tried
to shrug it off, when a vase he was sitting next to fell off and broke.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then I was staring wild eyed at him, he frowned, and
disappeared again. I later was walking down to my basement, when I heard
crying. I thought it might be my brother, frustrated because he couldnt beat a
videogame (he always cried when he couldnt win), but when I got down there, the
T.V. and the lights were off. I was again, terrified, but I peaked around the
corner and nothing was there, all I heard was crying, but it kept getting
louder. I was turning around to run, when I saw him right there in front of me
I fell on the ground and screamed. He cried even more at this. I could hear my
parents asking if everything was alright while they were making their way
downstairs.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I looked at him and he vanished once again. The crying
stopped as my parents came in the little crawl space that we called "The
Toy Room".</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">They looked at me, stunned, still staring at where the
little ghost use to be. They asked me if I hurt myself or something. I said,
"No...</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I just tripped." They then inspected my body, to really
see if I was just toughing out some scrape. My mom then looked at my dad, and
shrugged. My dads next reply scared me so bad to the point I peed my pants.
"Well...then...why were you crying son?"</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Well, after a few more meetings, I found out he was a ghost
(yes, I didn't know before). After a while, we became friends, but he never
spoke, just helped us out and played with our toys. Like once, before we went
to our grandparents house, we had to clean the basement. It took hours, but we
finally did it, then we went to my grandma's. When we came home, my brother and
I went to the basement, to play videogames. It was a mess! We groaned, and I
screamed, "SAAAAMM!!" We named him little black sambo, because of his
color (not to be racist for those of you who are easily offended). While my
brother went to the bathroom, he appeared, at first smiling, but then frowned,
seeing how distressed I was. I looked him straight in the eye and said,
"Help us clean, or clean it yourself!" I stormed upstairs to get my
mom so she could help us. We were just heading downstairs when I heard my
brother scream. I ran down to figure out what Sam had done. When I got in there
I saw my brother shaking, his eyes fully open, looking to and fro. I looked in
the room and gasped myself... it was perfectly clean.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My mom got down there and said, "What mess?".</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It was six years that I had known him, he was mine, and the
family's best friend. It was almost like he was a part of the family: he lived
in the house, went to school with my brother and I, and did household chores
(without us asking by the way). My life was going good, I was starting seventh
grade, I had lots of friends, what more could I ask for? "I've decided
that we're moving" I'll never forget that day. The day my mom decided to
move. She had wanted to move before, but never did. We've even had a "For
Sale" sign in our front yard before, but it was taken down only a few days
after because my mother didn't want to leave the house she raised her children
in. Now she was serious. The sign went up almost immediatly and she started
looking at houses. At first, I thought it was cool, I mean, the house we were
in was good, but we didn't live in the best neighborhood in the world, which
was why my mom wanted to move. It was a long time before someone decided to buy
our house for $200,000 in cash right there if we moved out in a week. My father
took his offer, and we started packing immediatly. I was sad to leave this
house, I had so many memories there, but, I had to move on. While I was packing
my things, Sam appeared beside my bed, but he wasn't smiling this time, he was
frowning (this didn't happen a lot). I stopped packing and asked him what was
wrong. He looked at my bag. I smiled and said, "Will you miss this house
too?" I was surprised to see him shake his head. I frowned and he started
crying, "Why won't you miss our house?... didn't you like it here?"
Then, I heard something I had never heard from him before... his voice.
"I'm not leaving." then he vanished.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I'll never forget that week, I was more sad that week then I
ever was, or will be. I had known Sam six years. Six years! It was like losing
a little brother to me. That entire week, I begged him to go with us, he would
just shake his head and say, "I can't." The day we left was the worst
day ever... it's ironic, but it was the day after easter. As I was heading out
of what was now our empty house, my brother and I ran to our Toy Room where Sam
was. After ten minutes Sam appeared. My brother of course couldn't see him but
knew he was there. At first he was frowning, but then the room got brighter,
and he smiled. He waved goodbye, tears streaming down his eyes. I said goodbye
and my brother said, "This is your last chance to come with us Sam...
Please?" But Sam just shook his head, looked up, and disappeared from our
lives.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After Sam, I've seen several spirits. Especially when we
moved to the apartment complex. There was an old lady in a night gown that
lived in my dad's closet, and a guy in camoflauge kakis and a white shirt with
a green beanie that lived in our living room (he used to watch me play video
games and laugh, he even tried himself once). When we moved into our new house
(the house I'm in now) there was only one ghost. A mischevious poltergeist that
is so annoying. He once turned on our T.V. and cranked the volume up to the max
while we were all asleep! It scared the crap outta my mom, but he thought it
was hilarious.There have been good things as well as bad things though, about a
year ago, my brothers best friend died in a car accident. Our family,
especially my brother, were distraught. So my brother and I stayed up late the
night he died, and watched Monty Python to cheer us up. Then, I noticed
somebody walking around our kitchen, grinning with the biggest smile I had ever
seen. I thought it was the poltergeist, so I told him to go away. My brother
asked,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I don't think it's the
poltergeist..."</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I stared at him and asked him how he knew, "I don't
know," he said, "but I really don't think it's him." He told me
to describe him.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">"Well," I said, "he's wearing blue jeans,
white t-shirt, and he has the biggest smile I've ever seen." <st1:PersonName>Jason</st1:PersonName>
stood up, "Jayson is that you?!" The ghost nodded and walked over. It
turned out, the ghost was my brother's best friend, Jayson, that died in the
crash. We stopped the movie, and talked for hours. Jayson had to talk through
me though, apparently, the only way a ghost can communicate to living people,
is through someone else. Anyway, presently, I talk to a ghost that came in
about a month ago, her name is Emelie, and her brother, Jacob.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Jayson visits now and then, but I don't see him as much as I
used to.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Well, that's my life, helping out ghosts, kinda weird huh?
But it all started out with a little ghost named Sam. This is for you, buddy!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I found your site
tonight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>listening to the voice
recording on page one, #13 ("go out there"), I understood the voice
saying, "the boy ain't here".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Also, #16 (my mother's 95"), is saying, "I (I'll) love you all
the time".<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I never actually had a
ghost or haunting experience. Only the time when I was 12 yrs, I was sitting
off to the side of my grandmas' coffin while the grown-ups were conversing
around her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was listening to them,
when out of no-where this white bird fluttered down and perched itself on the
edge by my grandma's head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought some
one brought in a birdcage, for this bird was a beautiful white dove.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was so amazed by it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just sat there and watched it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember a warm, peaceful feeling coming
over me as if I were covered with sunbeams.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After what seem to be an eternity, sitting and watching that beautiful
white dove, I realized no one else is saying anything about the bird, ...and
the bird was closer to them then it was to me!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Yet they kept talking and looking down upon my grandma as if the dove
wasn't even there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as I tried to
get my mothers attention, I looked back at the coffin and the white dove was
gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I jumped up out of my chair, going
room to room searching for the dove.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
even went outside looking in the trees and up in the skies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the funeral attendants was standing in
the lobby when I came back inside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
asked him if they had pet birds in the funeral home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never said anything about the dove until
that evening at home to my mom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
started to cry which made me cried.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
said it was a sign from God, only for me, since no one else could see it. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">One of My Experiences with Ghosts</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: rag_lady@hotmail.com </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Hi my name is Samantha and I'm 18 years old.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have had a lot of unusual and scary things happen to my
family and I.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">But I won't get into all of that. But what I will tell you
is one story about something I had the unfortunate chance of meeting. THIS is
my story:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My family and I are gypsies, since we constantly move around
and hardly stay in the same place. Mostly because of my dad(God rest his soul),
he wanted us to see "the world" so we lived in 17 different towns and
cities altogether.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">But we sort of gave up on that since he died 7 years ago. So
we moved a couple years later to <st1:place><st1:City>Timmins</st1:City>, <st1:State>Ontario</st1:State></st1:place>(
Which is located in <st1:place>Northern Canada</st1:place>)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">which is only an hour and a half away from where we used to
live( Cochrane).</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">So anyway, I didn't get the greatest feeling from our 2
bedroom upstairs apartment. Not only was it on a bad street, but I felt
something not good there.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Right away odd things happened. Such as the rocking chair
moment.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There was this creepy old rocking chair from the 70's
already there and it was put away in the inside porch with most of our
belongings. I had an unnerving feeling and I went to go see it. Right there
from the doorway, it was rocking crookedly which made it look even creepier.
Then it stopped so suddenly, like it knew that I was watching.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then there's the attic. I always hear something walking
around up there and a loud thump like it jumping up and down. It was very cold
up there. I always avoided it. My mom even put a lock on the attic door,
"Just in case", was all she said.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I didn't know what that meant.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I remember one night I was home alone waiting for my mom and
sister to come home. I didn;t feel safe, even with all the lights on. i
couldn't sleep until they were home. I was in my room waiting on my bed, then I
heard the door open and someone walking around. I thought it was mom so I went
to go look. she wasn't there, the door was open and I was alone. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I used to wake up with scratches all over my body, some of
them deep and I would be puzzled as to how they got there. I didn't have a pet.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then there's the one night when I woke up in the middle of
the night, feeling scared and it was cold in my room, which was weird since i
didn't have a window and I wasn't cold, it was just the room. I felt someone
was standing beside my bed looking down at me( my bed was practically floor
level). I turned the other way and tried going back to bed but that's when I
felt someone hot breath in my ear and I heard it rasp. It was a man. i knew. My
heart stopped and I froze. I was scared. I couldn't sleep since.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">i knew it was a man, I had a dream of him. he was caucasian,
weighty and tall.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">he often tried to follow me in my dreams, he was angry,
abusive, but couldn't touch me once I got away from the apartment.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I told my sister and she knew also.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">we moved out of there the next summer and we went back to
Cochrane and we stayed here ever since. we've had other spirits but we didn;t
care, we were back to something familiar and that was ok.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi my name is Cody and I have encountered a few ghosts my
first when I was very young I woke up and opened my eyes and something said
Gotcha Gotcha I looked and no one was there so ran downstairs.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Another time I went downstairs in the basement and I saw a
man in a cloak and I asked who it was and it made a hissing sound and so i
threw something at it I can't remember and its hissing got louder so I ran
upstairs and never saw it again it had no face.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Another time I saw a lady after going to the public pool and
I saw a woman and once again I fled.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">At my friends former house I saw a lady in his house running
towards the window I was looking through so again I fled.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One time my cousin, my mom and I were driving to my
grandma's house and saw a semi-truck go right through our van so we stopped at
a gas station and started driving again and turned on our radio and it said put
up your weapons you cowardly humans and fight. So we started driving without a
radio nad we went to our aunts house which she knows alot about ghosts and she
said my cousin's friend died from a semi-truck on that same road.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">All these times I never told anyone but my friends because
my family thinks I lie about that kind of stuff.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I lived in a town home in my hometown of <st1:place><st1:City>Glendale</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>Arizona</st1:State></st1:place>. It was on <st1:Street><st1:address>59th
  Ave.</st1:address></st1:Street> and <st1:City><st1:place>Peoria</st1:place></st1:City>,
less than a mile from three cemeteries and a dilapidated old barn house. Creepy
surroundings. My experiences aren't that riveting, but the place was infested
with cockroaches and they never went away no matter what we did. We did so many
things as far as fogging, we let 30 geckos loose to eat them all, we put out
roach traps. I've just heard things about bugs in haunted places, flies and
stuff but it could have nothing to do with it. But also, there was 1 1/2
bathrooms in the place, the upstairs one had a shower the downstairs one just
had a toilet and sink. Well, one time I was in this bathroom which is right
beneath the stairs. As I was sitting on the toilet I heard feet running up the
stairs like thunder though. Like someone was really hurrying to get up there.
Then I came out of the bathroom and saw my boyfriend and my roommate and I
said, "Who ran upstairs all crazy?" And they said neither of them. I said,
"Are you sure?" And they said, "Yeah, we've been sitting here
the whole time." I asked if one of our three cats ran upstairs. The two
girl cats are too small to have made that kind of noise but our male cat was
almost 20 pounds so it was a possibility. But he was sitting beside my
roommate. Also, the light used to turn on by itself and in my boyfriend and my
bedroom, the lock was on the outside and it was a key hole as if somebody was
locking someone in the room from the outside. One of our female cats went crazy
and started to growl at us and attacked my roommate. My dog was always barking
at things when there was nothing for him to bark at.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Very scary. Thank God I live there no more.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">After sharing some particularly creepy paranormal
experiences amongst ourselves, my brother, sister, my sister's boyfriend, and I
decided to check out a couple of the places on the Haunted Places list that
just happened to be located here in scenic <st1:place><st1:City>Muskogee</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>Oklahoma</st1:State></st1:place>. While searching for the address
of 219 <st1:City><st1:place>Okmulgee</st1:place></st1:City>, we wound up on a
street by the name of Callahan. A set of train tracks runs across the road, and
bells and crossing lights are in place to warn about oncoming trains. At around
2:00 in the morning, we started down the road. When we started, the warning
lights were flashing, but they went off shortly, and we assumed a train had
just passed. But when we came up on the tracks, they began flashing again, and
this time, the bells went off, too. Our driver, my sister, slammed on the
brakes, and we all started looking for the train -- there wasn't one in sight.
The lights went off a few seconds later. So we sat, and waited, unsure of
whether or not to continue across the tracks. Then the lights went off again.
My sister sped in reverse to get away from the tracks, she was so freaked out.
Her boyfriend finally talked her into going across the tracks, and when we did,
he, my brother, and I felt extremely panicked. After that, we finally found our
address -- which is now an abandoned parking lot. The story says you're
supposed to here two men talking in the back seat. What happened was that my
left eardrum started hurting VERY badly, and I just got an overwhelming sense
that something bad had happened. As we were pulling out of the parking lot, two
street lights went out -- one right on the corner which the parking lot was on,
and one diagonally across the street. We went through the parking lot once
more, and once again my left ear started hurting. My brother said that his ears
started ringing for about a second and stopped, and my sister's boyfriend said
he felt like he was on an airplane because his ears suddenly became stuffy.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By: sienkiem@MSKCC.ORG</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have a ghost story that my Dad told me about.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He and my grandmother (Dad's Mom) used to see
this ghost all the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was born in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Poland</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in a very small town in the North.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
two years after I was born my parents and I lived with my Dad's family in one
of the upstairs rooms with a separate entrance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My Dad says that whenever he came home after dark he used to see this
man in a suit standing on top of the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My Mom didn't know about it then because she is very afraid of ghosts so
my Dad never told her but one day she found out about it when her sister and
her Mom came to visit one winter evening when it was already dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They came up the stairs in the dark and my
grandma walked forward to turn the light switch on and at the same time my aunt
saw the man in the suit standing on top of the stairs and she saw my grandma
walking right through him and turn the light on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My aunt freaked out, she was shaking and
crying for hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, that's how my Mom
found out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My Dad said that one
explanation for the presence of that ghost is that the house is very, very old
(the area where I used to live used to belong to <st1:country-region>Prussia</st1:country-region>
then it was taken over by Teutonic Order and then <st1:place><st1:country-region>Germany</st1:country-region></st1:place>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After World War II <st1:country-region>Poland</st1:country-region>
took over the land and my grandparents (Dad's parents) moved there (they came
from <st1:country-region><st1:place>Lithuania</st1:place></st1:country-region>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So no one is really sure how old the house is
but when they came there after the war they found a body in the upstairs
kitchen and that is right next to the top of the stairs where my Dad and other
members of my family used to see the man in the suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have gone up those stairs many times after
I was older (my cousins used to live in that room) and I never saw anything but
I heard this exact same story from many members of my family who experienced
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Haunted House</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi, you probably won't think much of this but it really
freaked out my friend. Just read it first before you judge it.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It started with my friend's mum. His mum used to be a
cleaner you see and she and her friend were cleaning this house when something
happened. First whenever his mum and her friend were cleaning upstairs they
could always smell something really horrid downstairs, but whenver they went
down, there was nothing there. This happened quite a few times. Then one day,
my friend's mum was cleaning the wall when she felt something push her really
hard on her shoulder. She was then off with shock. Her friend who cleaned with
her didn't think it was true but the next day it happened to her as well. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When my friend's mum was better, her and her friend went to
the house next door to this haunted one and they told the woman who lived
there. This woman (called Vanessa) went into the house and as soon as she
stepped upstairs the smell stopped. It was almost as if she had scared the
ghost or thing off. I don't know what you'd think of this story but I can
guarantee you one thing, it is 100% true!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have been reading stories on your website for a few years
now, and I figured I might as well share some of the experiences which have
occured to me and members of my family, and friends.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My grandparents have lived in their home for about 45 years
now. My grandmother was a nurse before she retired, and she often looks after
family and friends when they are ill. My great-grandmother and my great-uncle
have both passed away in her home, one in 1979, and the other in 1993, I think.
Anyway, my mother especially, can always feel my great-grandmother's presence
in the basement, where my grandparents had stored her rocking chair, which has
been there since she was staying at their home, and is still there today. You
just get an overwhelming feeling that there is someone sitting on the chair,
although it has ever scared any of us. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When my two sisters and I were younger, we spent every
weekend, and a few weeks each summer at my grandparents place. One time, my
older sister and I had been chatting about the house being haunted, and my
grandfather got upset about that. My sister made the comment thet she wished
that the ghosts would prove that they were in fact there. We left to go grocery
shopping, and when we returned approximately 2 hours later, there were 2 cups
out of the cupboard (we had put all the dishes away before going), and the way
they were situated on the floor, it was apparent they had fallen. One was a
plastic cup, which ended up being fine, and the other was glass, which had
broken. In fact, there were pieces of glass embedded in the floor through the
carpet. We knew that they couldn't have fallen on their own because t cupboards
were all closed, and my grandmother stacks her glasses and mugs in stacks of 4
or 5, so there was absolutely no way to explain how only 2 fell, and the
cupboard doors shutting behind them. There was nobody who could have done it,
my parents do not have keys to enter my grandparents place, and my uncle was in
Buffalo NY (we live in Ottawa,On.). My father thinks that my sister got her
wish, and she has never again made a request like that.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My family believes that the home we live in is haunted. It
quiets down, then gets active. We have no idea how to go about checking the
history of our house, but we do believe our property was once connected to our
neighbours. My older sister woke up one night, a few months after we moved in
(my parents bought the house about 7 years ago). When she opened her eyes she
saw a boy, she said he looked to be about 10, standing in the centre of the
room. He was wearing a baseball cap, and t-shirt. The way she described it, he
looked real, he wasn't transparent and there was no glow about him. She just
looked at him, she rubbed her eyes because she couldn't believe what she had
seen, then rolled over to face away from him, and went to sleep. My mother was
telling our neighbour about what my sister saw, and the neighbour commented
that it sounded like her ghost, her husband had seen a little boy he described
the same as my sister, in their attic the day they moved in. Our ghost doesn't
bother anyone often, and my big sister is the only one who has ever seen him.
We can all feel his presence when he is around. We have a sunroom, which had
been a garage that the previous owners had converted, which we use as a
bedroom. The only place a bed can fit properly to allow people to walk around
the room is to place it under the window, so you actually are literally right
at the same height as the window sill. That room gets very hot during the
summer, and stays very cold in the winter, we can never get the temperature
right, which is a duct prob m. The window pretty much stays open throughout the
whole summer, so anyone sleeping there can feel if there is wind coming in or
not. Anyway, my younger sister (it is her bedroom) has been woken up by the
sound of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the gate opening and slamming
shut on the front porch on a windless night. This doesn't happen very often. In
our living room and dining room area (which we use as a computer room) have
older windows with the sliding lock things on both sides that have to be
pressed in to open or close the windows. My younger sister and my mother were
in the living room one day when it started to rain. Mom told my sister to help
her close the windows so no rain gets inside, when they both heard the windows
in the computer room start closing and when they went to get a better look,
sure enough both windows were closed. We live in a bungalow, and there are no
walls separating the rooms, only an archway, so they coulldn't see the windows,
however they definately would have seen if anyone had been in the room. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I used to work 6 days a week starting at 5:30 a.m., with
Saturday's being a shorter shift, so I would usually leave at about 9 or 10
a.m. I would go home and take a nap most Saturday's. My bedroom is in the
basement, which is separated into two rooms, a rec room, and laundry area, then
walking through those rooms and turning right to go into the very back of the basement
is my bedroom. I got home one Saturday and went to lie down. Mom was also lying
down in her room, and her room is at the top of the basement staircase. We were
the only two home. She heard the front door open, and footsteps walking around.
She figured it was my father or one of my sisters. Whoever came in decided to
come down into the basement, open my bedroom door, lie down behind me, and
squeeze me. I was confused, but not in anyway paralized or afraid. I was too
tired to open my eyes and see if anyone was there, but I remember being
squeezed pretty tightly. Then, the squeezer got up, left my roo and both my
mother and I heard the footsteps going up the stairs, then out the front door.
I had to use the washroom, so I got up and ended up meeting mom at the top of
the stairs. I scared her, because she thought she heard a bag rustling as the
footsteps had come upstairs, and she thought it was me leaving the house. We
looked outside, and her car was the only one in our driveway, no one else had
come home at all, so we have no idea who it could have been, or why it would
have wanted to hug, or squeeze me. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My sister had gotten a helium filled balloon for her
birthday one year, and it was just hanging in the corner on the ceiling in our
computer room. I was awake one night surfing the net when I got the distinct
impression that something was right behind me, so I turned around and came face
to face with her balloon. It freaked me out, because, it had been floating on
the ceiling, and it had to lower to the height of a person sitting, and cross
the room, where it floated just level with my head. I popped the balloon that
night. My sister has heard dishes being thrown into the sink at night when she
got home from work, and one night saw a shadow of a person looking out the
living room window when she came home. She walked in the house and dicovered
everyone sleeping in their bedrooms, so she doesn't have a clue who would have
been at the window. She called her boyfriend to come get her because she didn't
want to be the only one awake that night.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I apologize for the length of this e-mail, and as I've
mentioned, it is not the most active of hauntings, in fact no one has ever
really felt uncomfortable before in our home. I still have years of experiences
to tell about, maybe I'll e-mail again sometime.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In 1989 I lived as a single mom in a two story townhome.
This was in <st1:place><st1:City>Berea</st1:City>, <st1:State>KY.</st1:State></st1:place>
My bedroom was upstairs and had one window overlooking my front door and the
parking lot. David, my next door neighbor shared his porch with me. One small
cement porch with one step up, leading to his door and to mine. He was number 7
and I was number 8. One time, early morning between 2 and 3 o'clock, I had just
startled myslef awake after a disturbing dream. In fact, I'd just finished
writing it all down in a dream journal and had turned off my bedside lamp. I
lay there in<span style="">&nbsp; </span>darkness with only my
bedroom window as a night light. A bit of street light<span style="">&nbsp; </span>shone through the slightly elevated shade and
if a car happened by I'd see a quick flash of headlights roam across my bedroom
walls. Roads were mostly empty and it was all stillness outside. My window was
partly open and I remember the sound of wind and an occasional insect amidst
all that quiet. It was summer, or maybe end of summer, and the fresh air
smelled like honeysuckly. As I lay there trying to fall back asleep I
suddenly<span style="">&nbsp; </span>heard the low growl of a car
engine in the parking lot below.. It idled for a few minutes and then turned
off. Silence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Next the click of a door
handle, then the sound of a door creaking open and slamming shut. I heard shoes
hitting the pavement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had loud
distinct heels on them, pacing the each step like I imagined a sharply dressed
woman would do. Klip, klop klip klop,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>coming closer to David and my porch. They made a distinct noise which
echoed in th enight air, they walked to just below my window. I wondered if the
person would knock on David's door, or mine.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was a pregnant pause as I listened for the knock. I guessed the
knock would be on David's door, as he was a big late night partier and frequent
l e night friends. The knock came, but on my door. I heard it loud and
belowing, through my open window from right below it, and simultaineously it
echoed through my apartment. Five knocks on my front door. Sharp and
determined. I immediately leaped out of bed and was at the window a few seconds
later. I yelled down to the visiter, "Hold on, I'll be right there".
I had several<span style="">&nbsp; </span>friends or family it could
be, despite this odd hour, I wasn't<span style="">&nbsp; </span>concerned.
I turned from the window and bounded down my stairs, in the dark, and sprung
open my front door.I opened it part way and then all the way. Only darkness,
just an empty porch. There was no car in the parking lot as far as my eyes
could see! Wind howled through the trees, it just shrieked past my door and
blew branches across the pavement. I shuddered, not from cold, but from the
lightening bolt of creepy chills that were traveling like ice down my down my
spinal cord. I shut the door again, then locked it. Then stood there for a
minute or two and checked the lock again. Slowly I moved again, back up the
stairs again, taking each step up backwards, keeping watch on my front door.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This is a true story and to this day, I still dont know if
what I saw was real.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My Mother passed away on May 13 of 1997.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was especially hard on my wife and I
because of all the things that she did for us to help us out like watching the
kids so we could go out and have fun for a few hours.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After the funeral arrangements were made, I went to my
mother's place of employment to collect her personal property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She worked with alot of nice people<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and a few of my aunts even worked there as
well.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The warehouse she worked in was a small, 1 floor building
probably about half the length of a football field.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As you walked into the employees entrance,
the timeclock machine was hanging on the wall about 3 ft in from the door and
that hallway ran along the wall from one end of the building to the other.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As I walked into the door, I was looking down at the floor
(it was hard for me to be there because of how much she loved her job and the
friends that she had there) and as I walked past the timeclock, I picked my
head up and saw at the very other end of the hallway, my Mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was standing there with her light brown
curly hair with her glasses drapped around her neck like she always wore them
wearing her "Proud To Be Irish" sweatshirt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She stared at me and walked around the corner
down the last Isle from where I was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
walked very quicky down to the other end of the building <span style="">&nbsp;</span>and as I got to the isle, she was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I walked around the building to find someone
that I may have mistaken her for, but there was nobody there who was even
"REMOTELY" dressed like my mother was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt a knot inmy stomach and had to walk
out of the building to get my head straight.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I didn't know what to believe after that. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A few days later, my brother decided to move into the house
because our mother lived by herself and we did not want the house to be broken
into since the obituary notice had been in the newspaper earlier that day.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I received a phone call from my brother (who sounded
nervous) asking me to come over to the house because "the doorbell keeps
ringing and when I get to the door, there's nobody there".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought that maybe he was either imagining
this, or someone was playing a trick on him, but that is where my mother had
passed away, at her own home.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">this will be the second story that I've sent to you.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">my mom told me this story and said that she was about 10 or
11 during the time of her experience.she said she was sleeping one night and
she woke up at about 1 in the morning. she looked up and saw a white shadow
floating next to her bed that had big eyes.she said its head looked a little
swollen and it looked like it was trying to say something.she got really scared
and tried to scream to wake her mom she was so scared that she couldn't make a
noise.she never told her mom about it because she was afraid that her brothers
would tease her.but a week later she over heard her brother (my uncle Kevin)say
that he saw a white figure with a swollen head.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Well, heres how this starts. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My best friend was over for the week, this summer, of '05,
and we'd been working all day on something. After going inside and taking a
nap, we both decided to go for walk in the woods. It was still light out, but
barley. We let my mother know where we were ging, when my little brother asked if
he could go. I said sure, and I let him come along. When we got back there, it
was getting dark fast, and I was glad I had brought along my sword, incase we
ran into any wild dogs. We'd been walking for about 10 minutes, when I noticed
a trail I'd never seen before, yet I'd been past this place tons of times. So,
we dicided to take the trail. It led down into a field that I knew, and we
began to walk across it. Suddenly we heard this really loud shrieking noise,
and looked acrossed the field. I should have probably stated before, I'm 17, my
friend is 16, and my little brother is 13. Now, when we heard this shrieking,
everything suddenly felt worng. And I don't mean as in we shouldn't be here
wrong, I mean completely wrong. I drew my sword out of instintc, when my friend
turned to me, asked for my sword,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and
said he felt it to, I guess he noticed I felt someth g about that place. I
decided to hand him my sword,and we decided to get out of there as quickly as
possible, i.e., running. While we were running, I turned around, as I was at
the back of our little group, when I saw two silver pahntoms. After I saw them,
I saw a fleeting image of an old castle. After that, I was completely
terrified. Not only where we being chased by two pahntoms, but now they were in
my mind.At this point, my friend, my brother, and I ran all the way home. That
was not the first time I had spotted the phantoms. One night, I had been in the
field, and I had spotted them, yet I did not feel threatned until that night.
It has reamined a mystery to me, at least it will until I get my investigation
team back there........ It's one of the scariest things to ever<span style="">&nbsp; </span>happen to me. This is a true story, and mine
is not the only one to be heard about this field and it's two
phantoms............</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">About 4 years ago, when I lived with my mother &amp; her
boyfriend in an apartment, I was sleeping on the loveseat in the living room
&amp; I had a stack of pillows &amp; blankets close to my head. It was about 12
am &amp; suddenly the pillows &amp; blankets fell over, I shrugged it off, I
mena, there were a lot of pillows &amp; blankets &amp; the pile was a bit
lopsided, that was, until I got up in the morning. When I woke up, I saw that
the pillows &amp; blankets had been made into a little pallet on the floor next
to me. Also, in that apartment, it was about 10 pm, I was trying to get to
sleep, &amp; I saw an lady in one of those button-up high-collared dresses from
a long time ago, I was a wee bit freaked, but when I saw her, I was scared, but
kind of happy to see her.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Also, about 2 years ago, I was living in a house with my
father &amp; my step-mother &amp;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
walking to my room &amp; i saw a blonde lady laying on our couch, she was
wearing a long, light blue dress. At first, I htought it might have been my
step-mother, then I realized that she didn't have a long, light blue dress, so
I looked back &amp; the lady wasn't there, &amp; my step-mother was at the
other end of the house on the computer. This time, it happened to my father, he
was sitting in his chair watching television &amp; for some reason he looked
behind him &amp; saw this little old lady with her hands on her hips giving him
a disaproving look. I'd also had things disapear &amp; turn up in wierd places,
at first I thought I had done it, I'm always leaving my stuff in odd places,
like my shoes in the bathroom behind the towels, don't ask. But, then I
realized even I didn't leave things in that wierd of places. Once, I lost my
house keys, I knew I had left them on my bed &amp; when I was getting ready for
bed &amp; I was getting all the crap off my bed, I realized that my keys
weren't there. I looked for them for days, but I never found them, that is
until, about 6 months ater, we were moving out of that house &amp; my dad was
moving this big desk out of my room, &amp; there were my keys. There is no way
that I could've kicked them under the desk by accident, it had this wierd
decoration on the front. The only way it could've gotten there was from the
back &amp; that was also impossible, my desk was too close to the wall for
that.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This also happened to my father a few months ago, it was
really late at night, or really early in the morning, I don't know. But, my
father woke up &amp; saw his father standing in his room. He called my aunt
&amp; she told him what happened.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This happened about 5 months ago, to me, I was sitting in
the church, during prayer, &amp; i don't know why, but I looked up &amp; I saw
my best friends dad standing right there, which I knew to be impossible,
because he had been dead about 2 years before this occurance. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This happened 4 months ago, I was late, like, really late,
&amp; I was having trouble trying to sleep &amp; I was looking at my window, or
rather, glaring, but , yeah, so, back to the point. Ok, so I was glaring at my
window &amp; I looked at the end of my bed &amp; saw this wierd demon looking
creature. Anyways, I totally freaked, I mena, you don't see wierd little
creatures everyday, you know? Ok, well ever since I've seen this
"thing" my favorite clothes have been dissapearing. At first I
thought they might be under my bed or in my closet, but they're not, there's
nothing under my bed &amp; I've been through my closet twice. Do know what that
freaky little creature might have been? </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">About 3 months ago, I was at my friends &amp; they have
crosses everywhere, I mean everywhere, ok, so, back to the point, the crosses.
Yeah, ok, so they have crosses everywhere because they have a problems with
these wierd glowing orb-like ghost thingys. Well, my friend, her sister, &amp;
I were sitting o her bed, talking &amp; we were talking about Stephen King movies
&amp; I say, "Have you seen IT?", &amp; we here this creepy voice
say, "Yes", we freaked out, we all jumped into the middle of the bed
&amp; didn't move for a long time. Ok, well the glowing or thingys are supposed
to be ghosts, we guess, because like, a lot of people have died in that house.
Ok, well, my friend was up late one night, watching television, &amp; she looks
out her window &amp; she sees 3 glowing heads. Ok, that's wierd right? Well,
one day, I had come home with her after school so she could give me a ride to
church, ok, so, I put my backpack in the middle of her bed, &amp; sat on the
floor, so I could watch some television before we had to go, she was on the
other side of the room, by window where she saw the glowing heads &amp; all the
sudden my backpack flies off the bad &amp; into her closet. I was like,
"WTF?", &amp; She goes, oh, it's ok, it's just the ghosts. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">About a year ago, I was in my friends grandmother's
bathroom, my friend had to shave her legs, &amp; I see this old dog lying on
the floor &amp; I was like,"Did y'all have a dog that died?", &amp;
she was like,"Yeah, how'd you know". I said,"Cause It's lying
right there on the floor underneath the sink". Ok, so maybe it didn't
happen like that, but I did see it. Laso, I was sitting on her grandmother's
bed &amp; all the sudden I get all cold &amp; I have these feelings of hatred,
love, sadnness, &amp; unwillingness to go. Well, those soon passed, bacause I
got the out that room, quickly. I was talking to my friend &amp; I
said,"Was there an older man who died, who was close to you who
died", &amp; She said,"Yeah, my grandfather how'd you know?". I
said,"Beacuse Ijust met him.". Turns out they have several
"portals" so to speak in thier house, plus 3 in thier ouigi board,so
we don't play with that. </p>
