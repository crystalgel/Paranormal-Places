Grandma<br>
<br>
<br>
By: prattr1983@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Hello, this is a TRUE story of my first real experience of
ghosts.&nbsp; I was very very young, 7 years old, but i remember it
like yesterday.&nbsp; My grandmother wasnt very ill or anything, but
nevertheless she died one night of a heart attack. She died on a Wed.
and the funeral was on Sat. that week.&nbsp; After her funeral the
family each went to their own homes ( in different cities).&nbsp;
Nothing out of the ordinary.&nbsp; But what made it really different
was that at the time we lived in a single wide trailer and of course
due to the circumstances all of the clothes were dirty and lined down
the wall of the hallway.&nbsp; When we got home all of the clothes were
washed and folded and piles on the dryer.... Wierder still was that on
the phone had&nbsp; a message on it.&nbsp; IT WAS GRANDMA&nbsp;&nbsp;
she told my mother and the rest of us that everything is fine and that
she is with god and it is beutiful.&nbsp; What made everything even
stranger was that each of my aunts and uncles had similar things happen
to them.&nbsp; Dishes were washed and things were cleaned, and each had
messages on their machines.&nbsp; That night i felt as if someone was
in my bedroom with me.&nbsp; When i awoke i was talking to my
grandmother.&nbsp; Right there, i mean god when your a kid your told
that dead is dead. Never the less my mother came in after a minute
seeing who i was talking to.&nbsp; She dint beleive me at first but she
eventually belived.&nbsp; <br>
Believe it if you want but i know the truth.<br>

Indian Boy<br>
<br>
By: katietrueland@charter.net<br>
<br>
When I lived in a house in the country in Piedmont,South Carolina, I
thought I was losing my mind! We had lived in the house about seven
years, with no paranormal activity of any kind. One day...everything
changed... I started feeling as if someone was tapping me on the back,
several times a day. Do you know what it feels to be claustrophobic? I
felt as if there were a room full of people around me, and I could
hardly breathe.I would go outside, and stay for awhile, and when I
re-entered the house I could breathe freely. One night, When my
children were asleep in their beds, and my husband was working the
third shift, I sat up in bed reading. I had a lamp on beside the bed,
and I was reading about a veternarian's life. I saw movement out of the
corner of my eye, then turned to look at what was moving&nbsp; head-on.
I saw a young boy (around 8 years old) with dark skin and hair, wearing
an animal skin vest and leggings of some sort. He had something in his
hand.....and ran from the wall beside me straight into my closed closet
door! I sat there in stunned disbelief for a few moments thinking "I
did not see what I thought I just saw!!" I stayed awake&nbsp; the rest
of the night trying to figure out why I saw a spirit of a small Indian
boy.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not mention this to my children,who were 8 and
11 years old, because I didn't want them to become scared. A few days
later my daughter, Heather, (8 yrs. old)came up to me, in the middle of
the day, with a strange look on her face. She said "Mama, I heard, and
thought I saw&nbsp; Patrick(her brother) running toward his room, so I
jumped out of the way before he crashed into me! I heard him jump on
his bed, and it sounded like he fell off! I hurried into his room, and
went around to the other side of the bed, to see if he was okay, but
there was no one there!"&nbsp; A couple of weeks later I was baby
sitting my small niece. We were in the kitchen, and she walked over to
the living room door. She ran and jumped into my arms, with a scared
look on her face, and she said "Feather"!&nbsp; She must have seen an
Indian brave! We lived in the house nine more years and heard many
unexplained noises, and could feel a presence in the house.Katie<br>

My Ghost Experience<br>
<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
<br>
When I was young (think baby-toddler), I would often go to my uncle's
house. Now, the history of my uncle's old house is interesting. My
uncle knew that a little girl had died there, though he never said how
long ago but it must be pretty long ago because she apparently wore
"weird" clothes. At parties, guests (who might've had a bit too much to
drink) would come up and ask things like, "Who's the girl in weird
clothes?" but they didn't know. When he came down to meet people at the
door or go places with them, they'd ask if anyone else was coming down
when there was no one else in the house and claimed that they had seen
a face peeking out of the upstairs window. Also, my uncle knew the
house was haunted because the girl would turn on the radio when he was
in the shower. <br>
One day, 2 of my uncles were and I were in this room. I was cooing and
talking to someone, and they thought I had an imaginary friend. So,
naturally, they asked, "Who are you talking to?" and I just replied,
"That girl". So, my other uncle decided to go further and ask, "What
does she look like? Is she happy or sad?" and I said, "Actually, she
looks kinda mad." So they decided to take me back downstairs. Another
time, my uncle was carrying me down the stairs and I jumped and
shivered, so he asked what happened. According to my uncle, I told him
that it was "that darn voice" again and that it had told me to be
careful on the stairs. On another note, my sister apparently saw this
girl also (or another spirit) and called him or her "The Cookie
Monster". She was afraid of the spirit and wouldn't go upstairs, while
I wanted to go upstairs. <br>
I'm 12 years old now and I haven't had another known ghost experience.<br>

The Man at the End of the Hall<br>
<br>
<br>
By: RobW14Azn@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
Most of these events are fairly recent. It all started when I was about
eight or nine (2000). At the end of the hallway (which is where my room
is) I had always felt a strange presence, but I was a bit skeptical at
the time so I thought nothing of it. Often I would wake up in the
middle of the night to a cold breeze, although there was nothing to
cause this. Sometimes I would see a black figure walk past the door
because I always kept it cracked open at night, it dissapeared once I
blinked. Being the skeptic I was at the time, I believed that since I
had woken up only seconds earlier, that this was my mind still asleep.
But then the same thing happened again the next night. And then the
night after that in my parents room (which was strange because its on
the complete other side of the hall). I began to wonder. After awhile,
when the hall was dark I began to see the outline of a person slightly
taller than me standing at the end of the hall. It made me somewhat
uncomfortable. After I first saw this, footsteps started in the
hallway, but only when I was in my room trying to sleep. They would
start at one end of the hall walk to my room then start over again. It
would do this time and time again, then eventually stopped. I
eventually stopped seeing the black figure walking past my room, now it
was just the sound of foot steps and the outline at the end of the
hall. Present day I live in the same house. I now see this outline at
the end of the hall and in an unused room. I have grown accustomed to
walking past this apparition everytime I go through the hall.
Apparently Im the only one my family that can see it, but not the only
one that can hear it. My parents both believe in ghosts, but they're
not so sure about the on im seeing. This ghost now only stands at the
end of the hall and frequently taps the lights on our ceiling fan at
night. The hosue is only twenty years old. We are the second owners and
there have been no deaths before we moved in that I know of. I
currently see this ghost peeking around the corner and staring at me as
I type this. Only one real event from this ghost has scared me, I was
sitting on the couch (around the age of 14) watching TV at about
midnight. All of a sudden to my right there was a flash of light JUST
next to me, it scared me into scooting down the couch. Im am now 15 1/2
and I still see this ghost without fear. I have never tried to
communicate with it, but I hope to soon. Hopefully without any flaw.
Thanks for reading my story.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

The House I Grew Up In<br>
<br>
By: sassysmom24@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Okay, this is a bit lengthy so please bear with me.<br>
The house where I grew up is not a very old one.&nbsp; It was bought
new by my aunt and uncle, then sold to my parents before I was
born.&nbsp; The land was just a hill covered with cedar trees until
they cleared it for the house.&nbsp; When I was very young (well
actually, well into adulthood) I was scared to death of my brother's
room.&nbsp; It was always cold, never could make it warm in there no
matter what you did.&nbsp; And it just felt wrong for some reason, like
it didn't want you in there.&nbsp; I would lay in my bed at night and
feel someone or something standing in the&nbsp; hallway at my bedroom
door...I could feel is as surely as if I was touching it and my heart
would just about pound out of my chest with fear.&nbsp; Just about
every night for years I would pile the covers up so that I couldn't see
the doorway.&nbsp; But as for actual evidence, that started when I was
a bit older.&nbsp; I remember I was about 8 or 9 and I was sleeping in
my mom's room.&nbsp; Mom was sound asleep beside me, Dad was at work
(he worked nights) and my brother was just a baby in his crib.&nbsp; I
had the blanket pulled up to my neck and felt a hand touch my shoulder,
then squeeze gently.&nbsp; I could feel all five fingers through the
blanket.&nbsp; I squinched my eyes shut as hard as I could and pulled
the blanket over my head, then the hand just let go.&nbsp; That seemed
to start a string of incidents which I won't give a lot of detail here,
but briefly the events were the telephone dialing by itself, my
brother's cd player turning on and off by itself and switching songs
even when no one was in the room, footsteps going through the kitchen
by someone wearing heavy boots in the middle of the night, a teddy bear
that I had that played music when you squeezed it's paw started playing
by itself (my whole immediate family plus some extended family members
were witness to that one...it freaked them out!)&nbsp; My brother and I
were watching tv one night, he was about 10 and I was 15 or so and he
just started staring wide eyed above the tv at the mirror.&nbsp; I said
what are you looking at and we both saw a grayish outline of a
shoulder, arm and torso in the mirror that stayed for about 3 seconds
then just faded away.&nbsp; There's lots more stuff but that's just a
few examples.&nbsp; Whatever it was in the house never hurt us, but did
feel threatening sometimes. <br>
Years later, in 1997, I was 19 at the time and still at home, my
grandmother came to live with us.&nbsp; She had some severe health
problems and couldn't live by herself anymore.&nbsp; She hadn't lived
with us for long when she said one day that there was something in our
house, she could feel it and couldn't we feel it too?&nbsp; Anyway, she
lived with us for a while, we converted the den into a bedroom, and her
health continued to decline...she went into kidney failure and we had
to do her dialysis at home.&nbsp; It was peritoneal dialysis and
involved using this rubber tubing that had a really strong vinyl
rubbery type smell to it.&nbsp; Day in and day out that smell was
there, like when you open a new pool float for the summer...that sort
of smell.&nbsp; She had this flower (I can't remember what kind) that
she had had for years and was healthy but it never bloomed no matter
what she did.&nbsp; Never.&nbsp; Anyway, she went downhill really fast
and eventually was put into the hospital, her body had just given
out.&nbsp; On the day she went into the hospital, my dad noticed that
the flower had a bud on it.&nbsp; We couldn't believe it.&nbsp; She was
in the hospital about a week before she passed and, I'm not kidding, on
the day she passed away, that flower bloomed.&nbsp; It was
beautiful!&nbsp; A dark fuschia color.&nbsp; I still have that flower
pressed into my bible.&nbsp; After that, we started feeling her
presence around the house, totally nonthreatening.&nbsp; We would hear
her walk from the den to the bathroom and back several times a night,
sometimes things would be moved around.&nbsp; One day, several months
later, I was in the den just looking out the window (we had converted
it back into a den after she died) and all of a sudden, that smell, the
smell of that rubber tubing was so strong in my nostrils that it almost
made me gag.&nbsp; It was like I had those tubes stuck up my
nose.&nbsp; All the tubing that we had had was long gone, so where this
smell came from, I don't know.&nbsp; I don't know if it was just
residual or what caused it...but after just a few seconds it went
away.&nbsp; The biggest thing though, was in 2003.&nbsp; My mom and dad
were sitting on the porch breaking beans (if you're&nbsp; from the
south you know what that means) and their pastor and his wife came to
visit.&nbsp; The front of the house has a big picture window.&nbsp; My
parents were sitting in front of it with their backs to it and the
pastor and his wife were facing them.&nbsp; Anyways, they visited a
while then left.&nbsp; On Sunday morning, the pastor's wife came up to
mom and asked her who the lady was that was living with her.&nbsp; Mom
asks her what she's talking about.&nbsp; Agnes (the pastor's wife) says
that when they were there visiting, a lady in a blue housedress with
pink flowers came up to the window, looked out at them, smiled a hello,
then turned around and walked back through the house.&nbsp; She then
described her exactly as far as hair and general features and it was my
grandma, there is no doubt about that.&nbsp; Mom then showed her a
picture and Agnes couldn't believe it...it was definitely her.&nbsp; My
parents still live there and I'm not afraid when I'm up there
anymore.&nbsp; I still here my grandmother walk through the house at
night if I'm there, but it's not scary at all.&nbsp; It's
comforting.&nbsp; She's watching out for us and the house no longer
feels bad or threatening, not even my brother's room, although it's
still my least favorite room in the house.<br>

My Own Stories<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
<br>
<br>
I have been reading your website for last 3 years. By far your web site
has been most informative source. I have recommended this site to many
of my friends and colleagues so that they understand this subject
better.<br>
This is the first time I am sharing this experience to anyone which has
just recently occurred. To give you some back ground my mom died when I
was just 2 years old. My father married once again and I have my step
mom who brought me up. I and my mom recently had clashes between us and
my step mom went to an extent that she rejected me as her child and
also went to an extent telling me that I was the one who was
responsible for my mom&#8217;s death. I was heartbroken I never knew such a
silly fight would lead to such disaster.<br>
It was 7th Feb 2007 and to keep me together I called my friend to spent
night with me. That day I had big fight with my mom and had not eaten
anything the whole day. I was hungry. I and my friend barely went of to
sleep. Now at around 1:30am I suddenly woke up to realise I had sleep
paralysis. I was not able to move my body, barely able to breath, and
though I was calling my friend no voice was coming from my throat. This
lasted for 5 seconds or so and suddenly huge blast of air came out of
me and I woke up my friend completely shaken.<br>
When I told my friend what happened with me, he said that he saw a dark
apparition in the room, and when I screamed it vanished. To tell you a
little about my friend he is a person who has such experience in the
past and has the ability to sense spirits.<br>
This is not the end. We were lying down on the bed and just then we
heard clear sound of someone turning on the switch in kitchen, we
listened carefully just then another sound of someone opening the
kitchen cabinet, and then clutter of utensils. We rushed in to kitchen
and there was nothing there. Well my friend later concluded that it was
my dead mom and the reason she did something like that was I had not
eaten anything. She was worried. The sleep paralysis was to wake me and
then those sounds were made to tell me that &#8220;eat something&#8221;I am down
with fever for 2 days now and in spite of my condition my step mom has
not taken care of me. Infact we fought last night as well. I went to my
bedroom and lied down for sometime. I had this constant sound in the
background. I am mentioning this as a background because I was thinking
very hard and deciding whether to stay with my parents or move away
from here. I got a little irritated with the constant sound and
switched my attention towards it and I could not believe my ears. I
could clearly hear someone mourning in room (lady&#8217;s voice because one
could easily make out). I got up and I opened the window to check if
the sound was coming from outside. The voice simply stopped!<br>
I have never experienced something like this earlier. Please help me
understand this better. Is my mom not happy of my state and she has
come back to help me ease my pain? Or is it someone else? To tell you
the truth, though I believe in these things but reading your websites I
am sceptical to discount certain events as not out of ordinary like
sound of footsteps on dead leaves can be nothing more that a rat
crawling on it but this was real and it has a taken a lot of thinking
before concluding these instances as Para-normal. Please help me!<br>

NH Ghosts, Wolfeboro<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
As an electrician, I had the Tuc Me Inn as one of my customers.&nbsp;
The former owners, (sold the building to the current owners) had a good
relationship with the ghost/s&nbsp; They realized that they had a non
paying guest, when one of their first customers, an older woman, in her
seventies, went up the stairs to bed, and was goosed on her fanny by
someone.&nbsp; She was furious, and going back to the owners, she found
them in their quarters getting ready for bed.<br>
On another, later, occasion, I had installed a wireless doorbell
extender.&nbsp; This gadget used the regular door bell, but allowed
another ringer, or ringers in various parts of the house. A few nights
after it was installed the ringer in their room ran non stop late at
night.&nbsp; No one was at the door, and they finally disconnected the
noisy thing.&nbsp; Being awake, they went to their elderly mothers room
to explain what had happened and found her in the midst of a major
heart attack.&nbsp; Yes, she lived, because they found her in time.<br>
There were many other stories concerning the ghost/s but these are the
ones that stick in my mind.&nbsp; The Inn has been written up within
the past ten years in a "ghost" book.<br>
Hope this may be of interest.<br>
PS&nbsp; I found your sight on a search for" factory second windows" Talk about seeing "through a glass darkly"!<br>

Man in the Room<br>
By: chanwoot@171studios.com<br>
<br>
well i have MANY stories, but the one that stands out the most to me is
this one. i was always a night owl, so while everyone else was sound
asleep, i was awake watching tv in the living room when i glanced into
my little brothers room to see a man on his knees in the far right
cornor of the room. he was just a black/grey shadow, he had his face
down in his hands and he was either crying or praying. what scared me
the most was when i looked away and then looked back and he was still
there!!! he never left. it wasnt like i saw him out of the cornor of my
eye or anything i was staring right at him for the longest time. i
couldnt bring myself to get up and leave. as i just sat there thinking
what to do next, out of my dinning room into the living room (RIGHT IN
FRONT OF MY FACE) three glowing black balls, one after another floated
out of my front door. by that time i didnt care what was going on, i
just got up and ran into my bed room and sat there thinking about
everything that just happend and wondered if the man was still in my
brothers room. my uncle and his wife also lived with me and my family
at the time, and i just told them that i was scared of these things
that i was witnessing. my uncle looked surprised and up-set at my aunt
and told me that they had been doing witch craft!!!! after that they
moved and i was forsed to live in the middle of ALL of it! my parents
thought i wanted attention, my grandmother thought i prayed to the
devil, and i didnt know how to get rid of it. finally after about a
year of different experiances, my other grandmother came up to pray
over the house, and when she came across this old wooden mask that we
got from my mothers grandfathers old cabin, she said that just looking
at it gave her an unsettled feeling in her stomach, so she took it with
her. after she left i felt at peace!!! for the time being anyway.... i
know there isnt anything to back my story up, but the way i see it you
can either believe me or not, but when i saw this site i wanted to tell
a few of my own. they are the most difficult times of my life and i
have a feeling there not over yet!<br>

Ghost of High School Love<br>
<br>
By: coleenshin1@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
My Stepfather died who I loved dearly. I drove home with my boyfriend to attend the funeral.<br>
It was July and very hot and clear. It was the day before the funeral.
My Stepdad had many friends and was a social drinker who hung out at
the very small bars in our very small town.<br>
You could walk main street and get to the three bars he frequented. It
was my plan to go to each and hug and comfort his old crew of drinking
buddies who are mostly elderly and hang out playing dominoes, people I
have known all my life. On this day, there was a 4th of July
celebration going with street vendors and music and such with a street
dance planned for later in the evening. I walked along with my new
boyfriend and my best friend from high school, I was mostly in a daze
and terrible sorrow at the sudden death of the man who raised me as his
own daughter. Even though I was with my new man, I looked around
through the crowd for Ronnie Joe, he was my first love and we had years
of history, a broken engagement, 12 yrs of off again, on again romance
since high school. I had been there for him when his father died, and I
knew he had loved and respected mine. I was upset he had not come to
the house or spoke with my grieving mother.&nbsp; The fact that we were
not together anymore would never stop him from coming to me, at least I
hoped. My boyfriend went to buy us cold drinks, My friend Linda stood
chatting to someone she knew. I stood still in my little bubble of
silence and pain, watching a game of basketball in the middle of
mainstreet,<br>
something they do every year. There he was, across the street, I saw
him, he saw me. He walked halfway across the street and stood still, a
look of love, great compassion and what I could only call sad yearning.
Our gaze held for long moments, tears began falling down my face, I was
so glad to see him!&nbsp; But then, he looked down at his feet, then
back one last time at me, he smiled, it was the most beautiful thing I
had ever seen, every hope, every dream, every sorrow we had ever shared
mingled in that smile. He turned, walked away to be lost in the crowd
in a moments passing.I was devestated, so hurt and angry. I turned and
fell weeping into my surprised and shocked best friend's arms telling
her how he had started to come speak to me and then walked away. She
found my new boyfriend and they took me to my mom's house to try to
comfort me and put me to bed. Later that evening after composing myself
I sat with my Mother as we recieved guests, family and mourners. That
is when Elsie, my High School Love's Mom came in the door, She had been
crying, she came and wrapped her arms around me, told me how sorry she
was about my Dad and how hard this double blow must be on me...I said
what? what are you saying? I was confused, I did'nt know what she
meant, double blow? She gasped and said, Oh God, you don't know? I
started shaking, just trembling from head to toe. She said Ronnie Joe,
He's dead. He died in a car accident up by Tulsa last night, He died
instantly. I fainted from the shock, the day had been too much. It was
truly months before I recovered. My boyfriend was a rock and supported
and believed what had happened because he had been there when I went
all tragic after Ronny Joe walked away from me in the street as does my
best girl friend who was there as well and took me home. It is my
belief that Ronnie Joe had come to say good bye, to comfort me for the
loss of my Stepfather, As I had been there for him. so he was for me.<br>

Haunted El Segundo, California<br>
<br>
By: cheval_52@msn.com<br>
<br>
The ghost of a man who committed suicide around 2000 still lingers in
the hallway on the 4th floor at 880 Apollo St in El Segundo,<br>
California.&nbsp; The street is just off of Rosecrans Blvd near the
local Movie Theater.&nbsp; I know because I saw him constantly when I<br>
did my night and early morning patrols as a Security Guard for
"Universal Protection" based in Long Beach, California.&nbsp; Going down<br>
the hallway three times a night was the toughest thing I ever had to do in my life.<br>
I always said a prayer as I approached the swirling apparition and told
him that I was just passing through.&nbsp; What I state here is<br>
true and can be backed up by another incident that was witnessed by three members of the El Segundo Police Department in<br>
2003.&nbsp; An incident so disturbing that the three officers called
for backup.&nbsp; All the officers were skeptical upon arrival to
answer a<br>
security alarm accidentally set off by me.&nbsp; When I asked them
about a possible suicide that had occurred a few years earlier, they<br>
asked me why I wanted to know.&nbsp; I told them of having strange
feelings on the 4th floor but did not tell them of my actual experience<br>
of seeing the apparition for fear of ridicule,&nbsp; it was then that
the elevator bell to the main lobby suddenly rang.&nbsp; When they asked<br>
me who else was in the building I stated that we were quite alone and that there was no other entry into the building.<br>
With that all three officers drew their guns and approached the
elevator doors.&nbsp; When the doors opened up,&nbsp; nobody was there.<br>
All three officers turned as white as a ghost (sic) and quickly stepped outside.<br>
I now live in the Seattle area but have submitted stories to you guys
in the past.&nbsp; About two years ago I submitted the true story<br>
of my encounter with the ghost of a Hispanic woman face-to-face in 2003
in Delano, California. I was working for "Pinkerton Security"<br>
at the time and my partner "Kathi Fursee" of Oildale, California (North of Bakersfield) witnessed it as well.<br>
I was born and raised in Southern California and my paranormal
incidents began at the age of 16.&nbsp; I have had many experiences
since<br>
then whereever I go,&nbsp; especially in Southern &amp; Central California as well as Washington State where I now live.<br>

Another Spirit<br>
<br>
By: harkness@mail.usachoice.net<br>
<br>
I sent my story about 2 weeks ago about my mother Peggy and my father
Tom who saw her shortly after her death.&nbsp; Just a recap, my mother
died of C.O.P.D on October 21, 2005 and my father died of lung cancer
October 3, 2006, not even a year later.&nbsp; Now I have to tell you
about my 11 year old daughter (Tasia).<br>
I am very interested in the paranormal but have kept that interest
secret from my five children (14, 11, 6, 5 and 14 months) so I did not
frighten them.&nbsp; Tasia is my only daughter and scares quite easily
so I am more careful with her.&nbsp; Today she tells me "Mom, I need to
tell you something but you are not going to believe it."&nbsp; I told
her to go ahead, "I was in the livingroom, with Jerred (14 months)
looking at our photo albums when I looked up and saw in the corner of
my eye Gramma and Grampa.&nbsp; I then turned my head and they were
gone."&nbsp; I said, "Really?&nbsp; Did Gramma have her oxygen
on?"&nbsp; (She has had oxygen since 1999)&nbsp; "No, mom she
didn't."&nbsp; I then decided to explain to her about your website and
all the people who have mentioned seeing things in the corner of their
eyes.<br>
My point in telling this story is that ghosts/spirits are real, not
that any of you need that info, you all are correct.&nbsp; My point is
even a person, a child like Tasia, who knows nothing (I asked her later
if she had ever heard such tings and she said no) experienced something
that many people had.<br>
I was very happy that happened to her and hope it happens to me.<br>
Thank you, I hope I haven't bored you.<br>

Aunt Mickey's Family Room<br>
<br>
<br>
By: dhowell19@cox.net <br>
<br>
When I was about 15 years old, my father and I traveled from San Diego,
California to Columbus, Ohio to see some family. We stayed at my aunt
Mickey's house. One morning, I walked downstairs to go eat. I was the
only one up and a little groggy. At the landing of the stairs is a
doorway that leads into the family room. It's funny that the room is
called such because no one is allowed to touch anything in there, it
just sits pretty all the time. Anyways, as I walked past the doorway I
saw a light come on and off. I kept walking thinking that it was just
some residual sleep. The very next day, while my cousin Michael and I
were walking past the room, the light once again turned on. The very
strange thing about this is that it is a touch lamp with a three-way
bulb. As we all know, the bulbs light output gets brighter from 1-2-3.
This is always the pattern for the bulbs. As we stopped and watched,
the light went 1-0, 1-3-1-0,1-2-3-1-0. Being scared, we ran to the
living room and hid behind the couch. This happened a few more times
while I was there, and I was fascinated each time. On my last night
there, I was walking upstairs to get to bed when the hair on my neck
stood up. I stopped, turned, and was once again treated to a
light-show: 1-2-1-0, 1-3-2-3-1-3-0, 3-0-3-0, 3-1-0-3-0-3. The light
stayed on this time, and I fled upstairs. Once we were back in
California, I told my father about this and he proceeded to tell me
that the house has been haunted for as long as he could remember. He
also told me about one of his experiences there in which the
grandfather clock (which has not worked since they purchased it)
started to chime at 1:30 a.m. The clock chimed 5 times, then no noise
was ever heard from it again. The pendulum never moved during this
process.<br>

Did he Bring It to My House??<br>
<br>
By: msmka81@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
*Please do not disclose my email address if this is chosen to be posted*<br>
I know this sounds really repetitive but I have been able to see
spirits, ghost and/or shadow people since I was about 8 yrs old.&nbsp;
Fortunately the darker half as far as demons and harmful spirits spared
me up until now.<br>
I am now 25 years old and I live in Philadelphia Pa, nothing really
special but for the first time I was being taunted by a ghost.&nbsp;
When I was 13 I was really scared of the things I would see and hear
but my grandmother instilled in me that I should not be afraid, just
pray and ask them to go away and I did.&nbsp; For the first time since
then I was scared to death of this thing and that is why I am writing
to you.&nbsp; I started to date a guy and it seems as soon as we begin
to get close and he would stay at my house this presence seemed to come
with him. When he was there it would be fine but when he wasn't it was
hell!&nbsp; Day or night I would see the shadow walking past my kitchen
or my bathroom/bedroom door, there were times when I would fall asleep
on the couch and would be startled awake as if someone shook me or
because of feeling like someone was standing over me.<br>
After I started to realize that these things only happened when the guy
wasn't around is when "he" materialized and I was able to describe him
to the "T"(this was about 3 months into it). The spirit was of a slim,
white, male looking to be in his late 20' early 30's.&nbsp; He wore a
trucker hat with a red and black flannel shirt that had the sleeves cut
off, under the hat I was able to see that he had blond hair that hung
right to his shoulder.&nbsp; Like I said day or night he made his
presence known, sometimes at night "he" would stand at my bedroom door
and just stare at me for what seemed like eternity.&nbsp; When I would
see him I wouldn't totally acknowledge that he was there but I knew
that he knew that I felt and saw him. <br>
I have a few spirits that seem to go with me wherever I go and they
don't scare me, just startle me sometimes because this new one had me
on edge, he really really frightened me so I told my friend what I
thought he had brought into my house and that I couldn't see him
anymore.&nbsp; He was very upset about that and even called me out of
my name!&nbsp; That night while I was in the shower I swear it felt as
if someone was standing right at the shower curtain and at any second
it would be pulled open.&nbsp; The presence seemed so anger and bent on
scaring me.&nbsp; I felt threatened and I have never felt this way
before, with all the things I have been thru with seeing things.&nbsp;
I trembled in the shower until I could barely stand up straight, I
grabbed my towel and ran out of the bathroom in to my bedroom, fell to
the floor and wept and wept and prayed for this thing to go away.&nbsp;
As I was crying and praying to God to please help me I heard a crash
that&nbsp; nearly gave me a heart attack.&nbsp; I waited a while to see
if there would be anymore noise but I heard nothing so I went to
check.&nbsp; When I stepped into the bathroom three rows of tiles
across and four down had fallen out the middle section of the shower
wall, landed in the tub and cracked. From that night on I haven't seen
or felt "him" and haven't looked back as far as talking to that guy.<br>
I guess what I want to know is can people bring or have spirits with them that may haunt you but not them? <br>

Don't Laugh at Ghost Stories<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp; veeflo@yahoo.com<br>
Here I am reading stories on your website. Well about 6:30 pm I'm alone
here in my office and have your website up on the computer reading.
Just read some stories that didn't quite register as real. I was
chuckling to myself when one of the file cabinet drawers slides open on
it own accord.(It's very squeaky). My first though was Ok this was too
weird! I go over and close the drawer. Then out loud I said Don't open
my drawers anymore and go back to where you came from.<br>
I guess they didn't like that I was laughing at some of the stories. I
believe and will always believe that there are spirits that walk among
us!&nbsp; <br>

Enola Summerdale Fire Company<br>
<br>
By: summerdaleff2049@aim.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I am a former live-in at the summerdale fire department in summerdale
(Enola) PA. We still do have the eerie feelings of being watched and
and like you are not alone. The bunk room door also still flies open
with noone being around it, or when all of us were in bed. This ghost
(who is believed to be former member "Pete" Blane. Pete is his
nickname, I can get his full name for you next time i go up there, we
have it on a plaque. Pete likes to pay with the lights sometimes, and
as mentioned in the article, he also likes to make starnge noises. In
the back of the engine bay there is a "hole" in the roof that has a
ladder going up to it, it goes to the cocklift or attic. In the winter
we do not see him because we keep a board over the top of the hole to
help keep heat in the building, but in the summer we take the board off
and sometimes at night you can see Pete up there kind of looking down
like he is keeping an eye on everything. And then there was one
occurence which I was not around for, but Pete was apparently a very
brilliant man when it came to firefighting, and there is a man in our
station who does not always say some ofthe smartest things, and he was
in the lounge with another member and said something very stupid along
the lines of firefighting. Well around the top of the lounge we have
photo albums and mapbooks/box charts and some other books. Well when
this man said this comment whatever it may be this photo album flew off
the top shelf and nailed on top of the head. The other member in there
said everything was pushed back onto the shelves when they walked in
and that there was no possibl way that the boo kcould have just fallen
off of the shelf on its own. Just thought you would like to hear about
some of these more recent occurrences. If you could email me back so I
know that you have recieved these, and if you would like any more info
just let me know and i will be glad to help you out as best as possible.<br>

My Ghost Story:<br>
<br>
By: spochylko@shaw.ca<br>
<br>
<br>
Hi my name is Holly and I would like to tell you one of the scariest
ghost stories that happened to me when i was about 8 years old. Me, my
parents and my sister who is a year younger than me moved into this old
creepy brick house that was the oldest house in town. This house was
only supposed to be a temporary place to live and rent as my parents
were looking around for a home to buy. I never liked living in the
house. I always got the feeling that someone was watching me all the
time...Our family dog would sit at the stairs that lead up to mine and
my sisters bedroom and she would just stare and bark as if something or
someone was present when there wasn't anyone. My mom told me a long
time after we had moved out of this place that when she was alone she
would hear footsteps going up the stairs and hear voices. She said she
was in the bathtub and she felt someone touch her neck. But anyways
back to my experience. I was in bed one night fast asleep. All of a
sudden I awoke and looked across my room. On my clothes hamper I had a
pile of clothes folded.The clothes turned into what looked like a cat
arching its back and baring its teeth. I screamed and yelled for my
mom. When she got upstairs I ran and jumped in her arms. I was crying
my eyes out cuz I was so scared. I happened to glance at my moms face
and it wasn't her! My mom has blue eyes and blonde hair. This
thing/person had brown eyes and black hair. I screamed,"Mom its not you
its not you!" And then I looked back at her and it was my mom. After
this incident we moved out of that house. I still have nightmares about
it to this day. Also, my mom told me when i was about 14 years old that
there was a young girl about 17 years old that lived in the house in
the 1980's. She killed herself in there and people that lived in the
house before and after us had creepy things happen to them too.The
house has since been torn down.Thank God!It gave me the creeps to even
drive by it!!<br>

Ghost<br>
<br>
By: r.e.outbreak@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
.My family and I had just moved to a new house when the trouble began. <br>
Before i start explaining all the unusual events that plagued our
family for some time i want to say the house we moved into was almost
brand new, even estate it was built in was brand new. The first
sighting was made by my younger brother he said at about 1 in the
morning he had waken up (which was strange because he was a very strong
sleeper) to what he believed was a face directly in front of his own
but we all dismissed what he had said as just a dream untill one night
i was woken at 1 in the morning, ( i always sleep with the door closed
and the way the beds positioned in the room i could not see the door
without sitting up) i could feel someone standing at the door looking
in at me so i sat up as quick as i could and briefly stared straight at
the figure which quickly slammed the door, i jumped out of bed with
clenched fists thinkin some weirdo had broken into the house and ran
downstairs to find all the doors locked i turned on all the lights and
yelled to my mum and dad to get up thinkin the "burglur" was somewhere
in the house. But&nbsp; we couldnt find anyone in the house. the next
morning i talked to my nan whos bedroom is downstairs and she said she
often saw a strange figure walk up the stairs at about 1 in the
morning.&nbsp; Alot of the time when everyone was down stairs we would
hear walking about upstairs and often come upstairs to find things
moved or just missing altogether.<br>
these events happened for almost two years untill we moved out. im not
sure what significants 1 in the morning had but that was mainly the
time odd things would happen. There are many more stories but to
explain them in detail would take a long time.<br>

Once a skeptic/not anymore<br>
<br>
<br>
By: mcreed@nish.org <br>
<br>
<br>
I have had experiences in my life that has turned me from a skeptic to
a believer. Years ago my girlfriend who is now my wife and I were <br>
staying in a trailer park with her mother. My wife&#8217;s father &#8220;my father
in-law&#8221; passed away in the trailer and several months later my wife and
I were laying<br>
down in the bedroom. It Was a two bedroom trailer where her mother
slept down the hall, our bedroom door was removed because her mom was
old<br>
fashion and did not like the fact that we were in a bedroom in the
first place so she had the door removed. Anyway, we were laying down in
our room<br>
where you could look out into the hallway. It was around 12:30p.m. when
we heard this walking as if it were getting closer to our door way, the
louder<br>
it was getting, the closer it got. By the time it got what sounded like our door way my wife and I had the sheet up to our <br>
eyes ready to see whatever it was coming. Sounded like a little giant.
I was 17 and she was 18. All of a sudden there was a ball of light that
started <br>
down the hallway on the wall. It was a perfect shape around 6&#8221; in
circumference and went down the hallway at an even pace (slowly)
without any dis-<br>
figurement. this continued until it passed by our doorway and headed
towards my mother in-laws room. We were to scared to see where it went
after it <br>
passed by our doorway. But after awhile we had the nerve to check but
did not see it. In the morning we asked her mom if she heard the noise
and she<br>
said she did not hear anything. We had tried everything to try and debunk the theory of it being a spirit but could not.<br>
Another time is when we were living in a town house and we were playing
cards at our dining room table. There was a butter knife hanging off the<br>
the kitchen counter when we had made snacks. The whole family was in
the dining room and you could look directly into the kitchen. All of a
sudden<br>
there was a sound like &#8220;bing&#8221; at that time I looked up to see the knife
do a couple flips in the air. Something hit it. Just not sure what it
was? No one<br>
was in the kitchen, we were in the next room with our jaws lower than
our knees. It was at this time that we would do a little investigation
work ourselves.<br>
We sent the kids to bed and set out a tape recorder on the dining room
table and taped while we were sleeping. We made sure the table was
clear of <br>
all items except the recorder. We were so anxious to come home from
work and play the tape although at times it seemed boring until we
struck gold.<br>
We left it out on the table several nights. Everytime we listened to it
you could hear the clock in the background tic,toc,tic,toc,tic,toc,
then we <br>
heard what sounded like paper being crumbled up next to the microphone
along with what sounded like the cupboards being slammed in the
kitchen? <br>
And everytime something would make noise it seemed as if the white
noise the recorder was making would sort of tone down a little. But the
next night <br>
which was the biggest night of all was when we got home and listened
again to the tape of course we heard the cupboards slamming but in the
middle<br>
of the tape came this eerie young voice that amongst the white noise
and out of the blue said &#8220;I&#8217;m scared&#8221;. The white noise toned down some
and then<br>
came this voice. Definitely a voice. I had the hairs on the back of my
neck stand up. We thought we were getting into territory that we had no
control<br>
over and decided to stop what we were doing. Since then we have moved
on to an apt. and have not had much happen to us here. There was one
time<br>
when me and my son were playing X-box in the living room. All of a
sudden when things were quiet we heard a voice say &#8220;Michael&#8221; it was a
young girls<br>
voice. Both my son and I looked simultaneously to the right to respond
to the caller which obviously no-one was there. We looked at each other
and <br>
asked one another if we heard that. Both our names are Michael and
that&#8217;s why we both looked. I believe whatever this thing is it&#8217;s been
following us.<br>
Is this something you have heard or have happened? Is this some kind of
guardian angel, or could this be a bad thing. Even though we have moved
<br>
several times since the first incidence, I believe it is still with us.
Nothing has really happened since we moved several months ago but have
this<br>
feeling that it&#8217;s still there. Anyway, also would be interested if
there is a group of ghost hunters looking for some extra help here in
Northern V.A,<br>
If you know of any please let me know. I would be very interested.
Thanks for taking the time to read some of my experiences.
Mike.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

Pet Ghost Story<br>
<br>
By: LisaBu@UAWLSP.com<br>
<br>
Back in last October, 2002, I had to put my pet Collie down.&nbsp; I
also had a Sheltie that was still living.&nbsp;&nbsp; We had a daily
morning routine that went like this:&nbsp;&nbsp; Both dogs would wake
me up to let them out.&nbsp; They would not go out for my husband who
left for work earlier than I did, so when he left, they would bark and
nudge me to let me know they had to go out.&nbsp;&nbsp; My Collie had a
favorite spot on the front porch.&nbsp; She would lay right in front of
the door or go to the front door to come in when I always let her out
the side door.&nbsp;&nbsp; About a week after putting my Collie down,
something very strange happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; I began my regular routine
with the Sheltie waking me up to let her outside.&nbsp; I waited to let
her in as usual, sometimes having to help her up the porch stairs
because of her hips and old age.&nbsp;&nbsp; I let her in and we both
went back into the bedroom and&nbsp; back to bed waiting for my alarm
to go off.&nbsp; As I laid there, I heard my Collie bark at the front
door.&nbsp; I thought to myself that I forgot to let her in.&nbsp; I
was angry at myself because I forgot her and I wanted to go back&nbsp;
to sleep before my alarm went off.&nbsp; I couldn't believe that I left
her out there.&nbsp; I got out of the bed and started walking to the
front door, when I&nbsp; stopped in the middle of the room realizing
that I never let her out because she was no longer living.&nbsp; I had
to look out the front door because her bark was so clear and loud and
it came directly from the front porch. There were no other dogs in the
area.&nbsp; Our front porch was fenced in so no other dogs could have
been on the front porch.&nbsp; My Collie had a very distinctive
bark.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just knew that it wasn't the sheltie that barked
becuase her bark was different and because the bark sound came from the
front porch and the Sheltie was laying on the bedroom floor.&nbsp; My
bedroom faces the front porch door.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I know that I
wasn't sleeping because I had to wait to let the Sheltie in from
outside.&nbsp; In fact, most of the times I had to help her up because
she had very bad hips.&nbsp; I figure that I was up for at least 10 to
15 minutes so I know that I wasn't sleep walking and I certainly didn't
fall asleep when I laid back down because I heard her she bark as soon
as I laid down.&nbsp; The only explanation that I have is that she had
one last bark for me.&nbsp; She was letting me know she was still
there.&nbsp; I have never heard her bark again. <br>
The Sheltie is also gone now, 2 months after the Collie.&nbsp; I now
have 2 Schnoodles.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of dogs will look into the kitchen
from our living room and bark continually.&nbsp; Her bark sound is more
of a "whose there" type of bark, not a happy friendly bark.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I thought that she just may see the Sheltie laying on the kitchen
floor, as she did at times.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

Medical Office<br>
<br>
<br>
By: maldofr2002@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
A few years ago I was working in a medical office where I experience my
first ghostly encounter. The office was in an older part of town and
was said to have once been a carriage house. While it was a doctor's
office it looked like a house. There was a loft upstairs, which were
used as offices. The main offices were located in the center of the
house/building and hallways, with wood floors, circled all the way
around it. There were two entrances to these offices and little windows
where the cashier sat and where the nurse's station was located. Don't
be fooled though, as much as this was a medical office, it was spooky
at night. <br>
I was attending night school at the time of the first occurrence and
would occasionally stay late so as to kill time before I went to my
class. All the staff would usually be gone by six and I would lock up
when I left for my night class. There were usually strange noises like
papers shuffling in the loft upstairs, but I would just shrug that off.
I figured it was an old building and the house was just settling. One
night I was studying late and heard what seemed to be footsteps in side
the building. It seemed strange since I was the only one there at the
time. I shrugged it off again, mainly because I didn't want to believe
it was anything abnormal. Then the footsteps started to get louder and
clearer. They sounded to be heavy footsteps like a male wearing boots.
These footsteps went all around the main office where I was sitting and
stopped as soon as they got to the entrance behind me. The main office
was carpet so you wouldn't hear footsteps on carpet. I was so scared
that when they stopped in front of the entrance, I thought "crap I'm
going to see something aren't I?" So I waited, squeezed my eyes shut
for a minute while I got up the nerve to turn around and face whatever
was in the place with me. Fortunately, there was nothing there. No
shadow or fog, nothing. I was happily surprised but freaked out at the
same time. So I gathered my books and bag and took off as fast as I
could before anything else could happen. After that I never stayed
there late again, at least not alone. <br>
Another time in the building, I was with some coworkers in a training
session. It was late at night as well, but there were a number of
people with me. My boss and co-workers were spread out in different
exam rooms when we heard a big thump. It was a swinging door that
allows one to enter into the main offices and reception area. It was
quite strange since everyone was in rooms, which are not close to the
area. Everyone was freaked out wondering how that door could have swung
open and shut on its own! It was a huge thump too so it had to have
been slammed shut. Scary! Needless to say the training session was over
after that. <br>
I still get scared when I think about the footsteps, they were so real
and I seriously thought I was going to see a ghost. I don't what I
would have done if I had. Luckily I don't work there anymore.<br>

The Alamo<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I am seventy one years old and have lived in northwestern Pennsylvania
for the last twenty years.&nbsp; I am, however, a fifth generation
Texan and my contribution is about The Alamo.<br>
When I was approximately seven years old, I accompanied my family on a
visit to San Antonio.&nbsp; We, of course, went to the Alamo.&nbsp; My
mother was a former school teacher and a Texas history buff so we were
well versed in Texas history and understood completely what the Alamo
represented.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixty four years ago was a simpler time, we
had no television to educate us in the looks and sounds of historical
events.&nbsp; Also, I am sure at age seven the only movie I had seen
was &#8220;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&#8221;.&nbsp; I am pointing out this as
proof that I had no preconceived idea of the appearance and sounds of
The Battle of the Alamo.<br>
As we were well behaved children, my parents thought nothing of letting
us wander off after arriving at the Alamo to look in the display cases
etc.&nbsp; I was alone without my parents or my sisters.&nbsp; I came
to the entrance of the Chapel in the Alamo.&nbsp; To my eyes, it was in
a state of abandonment with high stone walls and longish narrow windows
without glass up toward the top before the vaulted ceiling began.&nbsp;
The floor was of sand with debris from several of the stones from the
walls here and there.&nbsp; There were no plaques or display
cases.&nbsp; I did not step into the Chapel.&nbsp; I only stood at the
entrance and watched as smoke and dust billowed into the high
windows.&nbsp; I heard cannon and gun fire and faintly smelled gun
powder and another smell I did not recognize.&nbsp; Perhaps it was
blood.&nbsp; I could also hear the continuous shouting and occasional
screaming of men from beyond the walls of the empty Chapel.&nbsp; It
was like standing at the edge of a movie or, perhaps, like using a
virtual reality device.&nbsp; I stood there entranced for several
minutes and then, like any seven year old, wandered away to continue my
tour.&nbsp; I did not mention this to my family at the time.&nbsp; It
is a wondrous event to me now but, at the time, it never occurred to me
that everyone couldn&#8217;t see the Chapel of yesteryear and hear the battle
raging.&nbsp; I now feel very honored to have witnessed this haunting.<br>
Years later, I wondered what would have happened if I had stepped onto
the sand floor of the Chapel.&nbsp; Would I have come to the small room
where Jim Bowie lay ill and dying?&nbsp; Would a door have opened onto
the terrible battle?&nbsp; Or would the whole thing have disappeared to
become the sterile Chapel of a hundred years later with the proper
plaques and display cases of a historical site?&nbsp; I feel almost
certain that this was what is known as a residual haunting with the
sights and sounds impressed upon the landscape.&nbsp; I would not like
to think that those souls are still there fighting a battle that they
know is going to end in their death.<br>

Haunted El Segundo, California<br>
<br>
By: cheval_52@msn.com <br>
<br>
The ghost of a man who committed suicide around 2000 still lingers in
the hallway on the 4th floor at 880 Apollo St in El Segundo,<br>
California.&nbsp; The street is just off of Rosecrans Blvd near the
local Movie Theater.&nbsp; I know because I saw him constantly when I<br>
did my night and early morning patrols as a Security Guard for
"Universal Protection" based in Long Beach, California.&nbsp; Going down<br>
the hallway three times a night was the toughest thing I ever had to do in my life.<br>
I always said a prayer as I approached the swirling apparition and told
him that I was just passing through.&nbsp; What I state here is<br>
true and can be backed up by another incident that was witnessed by three members of the El Segundo Police Department in<br>
2003.&nbsp; An incident so disturbing that the three officers called
for backup.&nbsp; All the officers were skeptical upon arrival to
answer a<br>
security alarm accidentally set off by me.&nbsp; When I asked them
about a possible suicide that had occurred a few years earlier, they<br>
asked me why I wanted to know.&nbsp; I told them of having strange
feelings on the 4th floor but did not tell them of my actual experience<br>
of seeing the apparition for fear of ridicule,&nbsp; it was then that
the elevator bell to the main lobby suddenly rang.&nbsp; When they asked<br>
me who else was in the building I stated that we were quite alone and that there was no other entry into the building.<br>
With that all three officers drew their guns and approached the
elevator doors.&nbsp; When the doors opened up,&nbsp; nobody was there.<br>
All three officers turned as white as a ghost (sic) and quickly stepped outside.<br>
I now live in the Seattle area but have submitted stories to you guys
in the past.&nbsp; About two years ago I submitted the true story<br>
of my encounter with the ghost of a Hispanic woman face-to-face in 2003
in Delano, California. I was working for "Pinkerton Security"<br>
at the time and my partner "Kathi Fursee" of Oildale, California (North of Bakersfield) witnessed it as well.<br>
I was born and raised in Southern California and my paranormal
incidents began at the age of 16.&nbsp; I have had many experiences
since<br>
then whereever I go,&nbsp; especially in Southern &amp; Central California as well as Washington State where I now live.<br>

Hello!&nbsp; I've submitted a couple of stories to you site
before.&nbsp; I certainly enjoying reading the stories posted by other
and can't imagine experiencing some of what I've read.&nbsp; As always,
I'm sharing someone else's story because I've never had an actual
experience myself (and I kinda hope to keep it that way - LOL!!)&nbsp;
Anyway, this happened to my son a few days after Christmas.&nbsp; <br>
My son, who is 12, does NOT watch scary movies of ANY kind, had this
experience:&nbsp; He's sitting in the family room watching TV.&nbsp;
His father is sleeping in the room across from the family room (we have
cape cod home).&nbsp; Next to the master bedroom is the formal living
room.&nbsp; The Christmas tree is right up against the wall separating
the master bedroom from the living room.&nbsp; I am upstairs on the
computer.&nbsp; My son tells me he hears and sees the tree
'rattling'.&nbsp; He thinks it's his father, not realizing his father
is sleeping.&nbsp; The tree rattles for a second time and he looks up
just in time to see a set of arms reaching up to the Angel at the top
of the tree.&nbsp; The Angel then falls to the floor making a loud
noise.&nbsp; I heard the noise upstairs and paid no mind.&nbsp; My
husband is woken and says in annoyance, "What's going on out
there?!"&nbsp; My son, who up to that point thought it was his father
then freaked out. <br>
My husband gets out of bed to fix the angel.&nbsp; My son comes
upstairs to where I've been the whole time and shares his
experience.&nbsp; When I tell you that my kid doesn't like to be scared
in any way, and is not prone to making up stories.&nbsp; He was shaken
up when he told me what happened and didn't want me to leave him alone
in his room, but wanted me to stay with him until he fell asleep.<br>
The complete view of the owner of the arms was obstructed by the family
room wall separating the family room from the living room, there fore,
all my son saw was the arms.&nbsp; When I asked if they were female or
male arms, she said they were in shadow, like dark cylinder
shapes.&nbsp; He didn't see clothing or skin, just the shadowy
suggestion of arms reaching up to the angel.&nbsp; <br>
I can tell you that my husband and I had been arguing constantly before
this....and someone in my family saw the ghost of a woman in my
house.&nbsp; My son will sometimes scream down at me in the middle of
the night asking that I go and sleep in his room with him because he
keeps hearing someone/something in his bathroom. One night, while I
laid in bed with him, we heard scratching on the walls for about half
hour.&nbsp; I convinced him we had mice between the walls, or a
squirrel, maybe.&nbsp; Truth is, the scratching was too loud to be that
of a mouse - or a squirrel for that matter.&nbsp; To me, the scratching
sounded like someone was trying to get someone 's attention, if you
know what I mean?&nbsp; Anyway, I thought I would share yet one more
incident told to me by someone else - in my house.&nbsp; I've yet to
experience anything, though at times I have felt a little spooked in
the middle of the night.&nbsp; Otherwise, we love our little old house,
which keeps us warm and cozy when we're home.&nbsp; If we do have a
spirit, it is truly a kind one, and was tryin to find a way to tell my
husand and me that we ought to keep it down!<br>

Hendersonville, fairly recent haunting.<br>
<br>
By: pmroysdon@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
I lived for a while with my ill mother in a rental house on Kanuga Road
in Hendersonville, N.C.&nbsp; The time span was from Spring of 1984
until Fall of 1987.&nbsp; The house was a three bedroom, one bath,
brick home built probably in the 1930's.&nbsp; I have always been
somewhat sensitive to unseen entities, but mother was definitely
unbelieving in "such nonsense".&nbsp; Almost from the time we moved in,
we both were aware of a "visitor" who would walk across the back
concrete deck towards the back door.&nbsp; He could be seen through the
two back windows that faced out onto the deck.&nbsp; We could clearly
see his arms and midriff area.&nbsp; He even "dressed" for the weather
- a white long-sleeved shirt in warm weather and a dark blue or black
zip-up jacket in cold weather.&nbsp; I know mom saw him too.&nbsp;
There were a few times when she would tell me that someone was walking
up to the back door and could I see who it was?&nbsp; There was a
circular gravel drive in the back.&nbsp; There were several occasions
where we would hear a car pull into the drive and circle around the
back.&nbsp; We could even see the red tail-lights on occasion.&nbsp; <br>
There were two small efficiency apartments near the back of the
property.&nbsp; Imagine my surprise when the people living there also
related that they heard cars pull in (and sometimes even see the
lights).&nbsp; Needless to say, these "cars" never pulled back out, but
simply vanished after going around the back circle.<br>
Mom died from her lengthy illness in May of 1986.&nbsp; After she died,
I had a roomate move in the help defray rental costs.&nbsp; She had a
baby.&nbsp; About the same time, I met and became engaged to my
husband.&nbsp; He also heard and saw things.&nbsp; Mom decided to make
her presence known during that time too!.&nbsp; Imagine my shock when
we returned from a grocery shopping trip and hearing Mom's voice
clearly calling my name from the house!&nbsp;&nbsp; My husband to be
turned towards me and asked me who was calling my name!&nbsp; We had
another shared shock one day.&nbsp; We heard a baby crying in the
house.&nbsp; My roomate was gone for awhile and, of course, her little
son was with her.&nbsp; My fiance and I were able to follow the sound
to the closet in my roomate's room, but when we opened the door, the
sound kind of muted out and disappeared.&nbsp; <br>
I have had friends over at various times who also were aware of the
backdoor man or the vanishing car.&nbsp; One girl shocked me when she
was able to "see" my mother sitting in one of the chairs.&nbsp; She was
able to describe her surprisingly accurately.&nbsp; <br>
I was never overly scared by anything that happened in that brick
house.&nbsp; The baby episode was the most alarming, but even then
there was no feeling of terror.&nbsp; I moved from that house when I
married and my housemate moved shortly afterward.&nbsp; Last Spring, I
stopped by that house.&nbsp; It had been turned into a sewing and
knitting notions shop.&nbsp; The current shopkeeper was unaware of
anything out of the ordinary.&nbsp; I suppose "hauntings" happen to the
"right" people at the right time.&nbsp; Too many people shared what was
happening for me to accept that it was only imagination.<br>

The Land Lady<br>
<br>
By: san.thomas@knox.army.mil<br>
<br>
I always believed in ghosts and things have always happen, or witness
things, get the feeling of a presence but never actually seen one.<br>
When I was 11 yrs old we move to Lowell MA, it was a dulpex that had an
upstairs apartment and down stairs apartment , and all shared the same
huge basement, the first night I felt a present their, and that night I
saw shadows, at the time I was in a room with my 2 younger sister cause
it was the first night so I would pinch my sister,so she would start
crying and my mother would come to the room and I would fall asleep.
The lights would always turn off at leasts once a day and I would have
to go to the basement and flip the circuit breaker, and every time I go
to the basement I always felt I was being watch and there was a present
there. You would hear footsteps coming from the attic and twice we
called the landlord to check it out but could not find anything. The
back door was always locked but the door would be open, my parents were
hardly home so it was scary because I was more concern of a burgler
than ghosts. As a kid I didn't understand what was happening until one
night my brother who is a year older than me was sleeping, his room was
actually a pantry, it was big enough just to fit a bed and nightstand,
during the middle of the night my brother started screeming and when we
got therehe was still, stiff in his bed, he wouldn't move, he was white
as a ghost, when my mom asked him what was wrong, he replied that there
was someone sleeping beside him and breathing down his neck, and a few
seconds later he jumped out of bed never to return to the room. My
mother then told us that it was the Land Lady(that's what she called
it). My mother, father, and older sister has seen her. She was dress in
all white, she would come from the attic and through our front door and
walk back to the bathroom and disappear. It wasn't an evil spirit, and
she never should herself to the younger kids, just to the adults so I
wasn't scared after that and even though things still happen ,nothing
bad we finally moved to a different state. <br>

No One believes Me..<br>

Back in 1970 I had My first job after graduating from Nursing
School.&nbsp; I needed to borrow My Mom's car to get to work, but I got
home late the night before, and didn't get a chance to tell Her.I got
up in the morning,(about) 5 AM and was brushing my teeth, when I
saw&nbsp; someone walk past the bathroom door.&nbsp; I (naturally)
assumed it was Mom, so I went out of the bathroom to tell Her I needed
the car.&nbsp; The livingroom was empty.&nbsp; My cat was sleeping on a
chair across the livingroom, and she stood up, and was looking at a
point over My shoulder.. She started to "chirp" as cats do when they
see a bird or something. Her hair stood up, and Her tail got twice its
size, and She kept "chirping".. I KNEW something was going on, so I
eased Myself into a chair just left of the livingroom doorway. I felt
like there was a "presense",but was afraid to turn around.&nbsp; After
what seemed like Eternity, (but was actually only a few minutes), Nicky
(the cat), turned around a few times on the chair, laid down, and went
back to sleep.&nbsp; At that point, the eerie feeling left, and I knew
it was safe to turn around and look in the hall.... I told My Mom and
My Sister about "The Woman In Green".. (She was wearing a flowing Green
Nightgown), and they&nbsp; scoffed at Me.... BUT, That Night I went out
after Work, and when I got Home, My Mom and My Sister were piled in the
same Bed!<br>
