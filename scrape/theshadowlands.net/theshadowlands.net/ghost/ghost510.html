<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">It
started when I was about 3. I asked Dad were Mom
went because I wanted to ask her if she could make me some potatoes,
since that
was my favorite thing to eat and I was hungry. He told me that she's in
the basement
doing laundry. So me being my over-the-top happy self went to the
basement
steps and started to go down slowly. (I couldn't go down normal because
I was
always scared I would fall on my face so I would go down backward on my
hands
and knee's.) I got to the third step and stopped to look between the
steps and
see in my Mom was in the laundry room. I was just sitting there
watching her
fold the clothes when I felt something push me. I caught my balance and
tried
to ignore it, but I was scared. Then it pushed me again and I fell. We
have
about 14 steps to go down before we can step onto the concrete floor,
so it was
pretty far to fall for a little 2 year old. When whatever it was pushed
me over
the edge I felt something cradle me and rock me back and forth like a
leaf. I
felt strangely comforted. Then I got to the bottom, it sat me down and
told me
"It's ok, everything's fine. Go to your Mom." I remember turning
around, smiling, and trying to see if anything was there. But sadly
there was
nothing. I ran to my Mom. When I was 4 I woke up to hearing something
calling
my name. I looked around my room, but nothing was there. I then looked
out my
window and there where 3 shadows looking at me and moving around. I
screamed
for my Dad to come see them. When he came running into my room they
were gone.
I told him what I saw and he said he would go scare them away. When I
was 5 I
NEVER went in the basement alone. If I ever went down there alone
things would
fall over from the other side of the room, I would get very cold and I
would
get the feeling like something was watching me. I was afraid if I was
down
there to long it would come after me. This fear lasted until I was 11.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>When I was 6 I started seeing faces around my
bed, I would get a cold chill, (Which is very hard to get because I
have a Hot
Water Bed) and then I would close my eyes saying it was just my
imagination and
go back to sleep. When I was 9 my I was talking to my Mom about ghosts
and the
different things I've seen. She told me that when she 1st accepted the
Lord (My
Family is Christian) She saw this freaky figure. It had no arms or
hands, no
legs or feet, and it looked almost as if it's eyes where glowing. It
had some
hair, but it was mostly bald. It had a small braided beard, and it was
squinting. She also said it looked like an old man. She said it was
coming to
her like it wanted her to stop praying, so she prayed even more, then
it turned
into dust and flew out the window. Then I talked to my Dad about it and
he told
me that when he was younger he was walking to the kitchen to see his
Mother.
Then something grabbed his feet and tried to pull him under the
mattress. He
said that he tried to scream but no words came out, Then his Mom looked
through
the door way and it let him go. This made me very scared. Then when I
was 12 my
Parents told me about the old barn. (We live right in front of a horse
farm)
The store was that there was the farmer, his wife and their daughter
that lived
in the old farm house. Their daughter was doing something and ended up
getting
herself put in a wheel chair. Her Parents felt sorry for her and bought
her a
horse. She loved the horse so much, and when she got better she rode
the horse
everyday but it died unexpectedly. She went into a deep depression and
was
walking in the prairie (My front yard). She laid down and died. The
mother got
so depressed that her daughter died she soon died in the same prairie.
Later
the husband got depressed and stopped feeding the animals in the barn.
The
animals got so hungry they started eating themselves. He just stayed in
his
chair and died. The daughter died in our front yard, the mother died in
our
orchard, and the father died in the house. When I was 14. (The age I am
now)I
still see faces around my bed. My aunt died a few months ago. My
nephew, Eric,
is a police officer and was testing out his new camera. He took a
picture and
he saw a face on the window. My family thinks its my Aunt, I think it&#8217;s
just a
reflection because the 'face' is to wide.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>2 weeks after the wake, I returned home. I woke up one morning
to my dog
howling like crazy, but I just stay in bed. 3 days later I wake up at
like 4 in
the morning to get a drink, I was to lazy to go down stairs so I went
in my
brothers room because he always keeps drinks and other goodies in
there. I come
back out and close the door, I look through the hallway to my parents
room
because in my head I'm thinking "Oh great, here comes mom..." I see
this figure looking at me from my Dads dresser. It was about 5' 2" and
its
hair was shoulder length. It walked over to the doorway and waved at
me, then
it turned around and walked over to my mother looked at her, came back
over to
me, smiled and waved at me, and walked down stairs. I was standing in
place the
whole time until it walked down the stairs, then I went over to the
stairs and
looked down but it wasn&#8217;t there. I also had a dream about my Aunt being
a
ghost.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Dead Bride used to come in dream!! In India my
mother&#8217;s grand father bought a house there was a big garden and Takhat
was
already kept there by former owner. After shifting there my mother&#8217;s
aunty
(Phuphi) who was just 7 or 8 years old , she slept over it and saw &#8220;a
bride
wearing red bridal dress and heavy gold jewelry was running so fast and
was
being chased by a man and a hindu pandit with bald head and a single
long
queue, who had a sharp knife in his hand as they wanted to kill her
suddenly
the bride stopped due to a blocked lane&#8221; Aunty woke up and so scared
about the
dream but after few minutes she forgot about it but surprisingly the
next day
when she slept again there the dream repeated it self, now she told all
that to
my mother&#8217;s grand mother, their maid was very sensible she said that
there must
be some thing wrong let me sleep there if I see the same then Molvi
sahab
should be called. The same happened as expected the maid also saw &#8220;a
beautiful
bride who was dressed up like Muslim brides, got out of breath but
still
running madly in order to safe her life&#8221; My mother&#8217;s grandfather called
Molvi
sahab , he recited Quranic verses and instructed to dig the ground out
then as
expected a crumbly skeleton of a bride wearing red bridal dress but all
of her
jewelry had been snatched. Supposed her as a Muslim girl my mother&#8217;s
grand
father and other people offered her last prayer &amp; buried her in
Muslim
graveyard then just for checking the maid again slept over there but
now she
slept peacefully as the bride got the peace by disclosing about her
murder and
as she couldn&#8217;t safe her life so her last wish came true to be buried
in Muslim
graveyard for this she used to come in dreams.<span style="">&nbsp;

WAS AT A MEETING FOR HOSPITAL UPDATES ON 5010
BILLING/AN ALL PAYERS MEETING. WE HAD ROOM 309 WITH DOUBLE FULL BEDS.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I HAD THE FIRST BED BY THE BATHROOM TO
MYSELF.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I READ MY EBOOK UNTIL 12:45
AM.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>MY TWO ROOMMATES WERE ASLEEP BY
THEN.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ONE IN THE NEXT BED AND THE OTHER
ON HER BLOWUP MATTRESS BY THE WINDOWS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
HAVE TROUBLE SLEEPING IN HOTELS AND THIS WAS NO EXCEPTION.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>THE ROOM WAS STUFFY AND HOT, EVEN THOUGH WE
HAD TURNED THE THERMOSTAT TO COLD AND THE FAN ON HIGH.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I HAD ALL THE LIGHTS TURNED OFF BECAUSE I
CAN'T SLEEP WITH ANY KIND OF LIGHT ON. I WAS TOSSING AND TURNING,
TRYING TO GO
TO SLEEP WITH THE COVERS PUSHED DOWN AT THE END OF THE BED.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I HAD MY BACK TO THE EMPTY SIDE OF MY BED
USING ONLY ONE PILLOW.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I COULD SEE
AROUND THE ROOM DUE TO THE LIGHT COMING THRU THE CURTAINS, IT WAS A
GREY GLOOM
WHERE I COULD SEE MY ROOMATE ON THE BED NEXT TO ME.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>MY ROOMMATES WERE SLEEPING QUITE SOUNDLY,
SNORING AND SUCH.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I EVEN HEARD THE
PERSON SNORING IN THE ROOM NEXT TO US, THEIR BEDS HAD TO HAVE BEEN ON
THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE WALL FROM OUR HEADBOARDS. I WAS CURLED IN A FETAL POSITION
FACING
MY SNORING ROOMMATE THINKING THAT I JUST MIGHT NEED TO PULL THE SHEET
UP, DUE
TO FINALLY FEELING COLD.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THEN I FELT
SOMETHING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BED AND REAL FAST SOMETHING TROTTED
PAST MY
BACK UP TO MY PILLOW, WALKED ACROSS ABOVE MY HEAD ON MY PILLOW AND AS I
TURNED
TO LOOK A BODY LIKE A CAT WITH A TAIL THAT BRUSHED MY FACE,(OH MY GOD!)
JUMPED
DOWN TO THE FLOOR BETWEEN THE BEDS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
ACTUALLY SAW IT JUMP TO THE FLOOR IN THE GREY GLOOM COMING FROM THE
CURTAINS IN
FRONT OF ME.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I FROZE AT FIRST, THINKING
, OH MY GOD THERE IS A CAT IN THE ROOM. I LAY THERE AND SQUINTED AT THE
FLOOR
BETWEEN THE BEDS LOOKING FOR THIS CAT? ANIMAL? THING THAT HAD SCARED
ME. WELL,
WHILE I WAS LOOKING AT THE SPACE BETWEEN THE BEDS I FELT SOMETHING IN
THE BED
BEHIND ME.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>FIRST OF ALL, LET ME TELL
YOU, THESE BEDS DID NOT SINK IN WHEN YOU GOT ON THEM.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>THEY WERE USING SOME KIND OF MATTRESSES THAT
YOU DIDN'T ROLL INTO THE MIDDLE IF SOMEONE ELSE GOT INTO BED.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I FROZE, TOTALLY IN FEAR BY NOW, ALL THE HAIR
STANDING UP ON MY BODY WITH MY MUSCLES FROZEN AND TWITCHING, READY TO
LEAP
RIGHT UP OUT OF THAT BED. A BODY LAY WITH ITS BACK UP NEXT TO MINE AND
IT HAD
TO HAVE BEEN A MAN.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I FELT WARMTH ALL
ALONG MY SHOULDER BLADES TO MY HIPS WERE WE TOUCHED.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN MY HUSBAND
DOES THAT AT HOME. THIS PERSON WAS BIGGER THAN ME.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I FROZE AT FIRST TRYING TO COMPREHEND WHAT
WAS HAPPENING.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I DID NOT FEEL THREATENED
AND ACTUALLY WAS ENJOYING THE WARMTH DUE TO THE ROOM HAD FINALLY GOT
COLD
ENOUGH FOR ME TO WANT TO PULL THE SHEETS UP BEFORE THE CAT CAME ALONG.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>THE REALITY HIT ME AND I WAS OUT OF THAT BED
AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I TURNED ON THE
LAMP BETWEEN THE BEDS AND LOOKED AT THE BED AND NO ONE WAS THERE.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I LOOKED ALL AROUND FREAKED OUT, ADRENALINE
GOING A HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I WENT TO
THE BATHROOM TURNED ON THE LIGHT LOOKED UNDER THE COUNTER, IN THE
SHOWER.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>NOTHING.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>MY ROOMMATES STILL SNORING FAST ASLEEP.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>IT WAS 3 SOMETHING ON THE CLOCK BETWEEN THE BEDS.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I DID NOT WANT TO GET BACK INTO BED, BUT I
DID, TOTALLY FREAKED OUT.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I FINALLY
TURNED OFF THE LAMP BETWEEN THE BEDS BUT LEFT THE BATHROOM LIGHT ON SO
I COULD
SEE AROUND THE ROOM.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I LAY THERE SCARED
TO DEATH TRYING TO RATIONALIZE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THE
INCIDENT MUST HAVE ONLY TOOK LESS THAN A
MINUTE, BUT I STILL LAY THERE PETRIFIED TRYING TO RATIONALIZE WHAT
HAPPENNED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I FELL ASLEEP BECAUSE THE
NEXT THING I HEARD WAS MY ROOMMATES <span style="">&nbsp;</span>WAKING
ME UP BECAUSE MY CELL PHONE ALARM CLOCK WAS GOING OFF AND THEY DID NOT
KNOW
WHERE THE ALARM WAS COMING FROM, IT WAS IN MY PURSE ACROSS THE ROOM.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I HAD FORGOTTON TO TURN OFF A 4:26 ALARM TO
GET UP TO GO HUNTING FOR DEER SEASON THAT ME AND MY HUSBAND WERE DOING
TO GO
BUCK HUNTING EARLIER IN THE WEEK.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I DID
NOT GO BACK TO SLEEP AT ALL AND WHEN WE WERE ALL SHOWEREED AND WAITING
TO GO TO
THE MEETING I TOLD THEM WHAT HAPPENED.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>ONE ROOMMATE BELEIVED ME, THE OTHER SAID I MUST HAVE BEEN IN
THAT IN
BETWEEN DREAMSTATE AND IT NEVER HAPPENEDI DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO BELEIVE,
IT ALL
SEEMED SO REAL.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THAT EVENING AFTER MUCH
JOKING ABOUT MY NEW BEDMATES JOINING ME AGAIN, IT IS NOW AFTER MIDNIGHT
AGAIN
AND I AM STILL FREAKED OUT, IN THE SAME BED, SAME POSTION FACING THE
OTHER BED
NOT GOING TO SLEEP.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I LEFT THE BATHROOM
LIGHT ON ALL NIGHT AND EVEN THOUGH MY ROOMMATES SNORED AND SLEPT MY
BODY LAY
THERE FROZEN WITH FEAR, ALL THE HAIR STANDING UP ON MY BODY AND SO
FROZEN MY
MUSCLES WERE TWITCHING.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I DID NOT
DARETURN ALL THE LIGHTS OFF DUE TO MY BODY ACTUALLY TELLING ME THAT WE
WERE
SURE TO HAVE ANOTHER INCIDENT IF I DID.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I WAS GLAD TO LEAVE THE NEXT DAY.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>HAS ANYONE ELSE HAD AN EXPERIENCE IN THAT HOTEL SIMILIAR TO MINE.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I DO NOT THINK I DREAMED IT.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>MY BODY OBVIOUSLY DID NOT.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>IT WOULD
NOT LET ME RELAX TO GO TO SLEEP.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 style="font-size: 16pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">I
was a security guard at St. Michael&#8217;s College from
1987-1996.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The theater is in the Fort
Ethan Allen area and it<span style="">&nbsp; </span>is called
Herrouet Theater. St. Mike&#8217;s owned purchase the this building along
with the
Old Chapel and the NPR building that were on either side of it.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>It can still be found on their campus map on
North Campus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The nun&#8217;s name that haunts
this building was Sister Sarah, and she died on stage in this theater
during
the 1960&#8217;s.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many have seen her on the
second floor as she used to sew costumes in a room up there that had a
window
that would look out the front of the building.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to people that worked at St. Mike&#8217;s who knew her, she
was fond
of peering out the window(s) to see how many people were attending the
performance(s) when they had plays and movies in this building.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>On several occasions, I checked this building
for a variety of reasons and I was with other SMC personnel.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>During my employment we have encountered
Sister Sarah either peering through the front window or walking in the
theater,
but could never really identify her. All we saw was a figure.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>On one occasion in particular, I was with the
a custodial manager at 3:00am as he assisted me that night.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>It all started because the front door was
ajar and I needed some backup before entering the building to check it
out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After determining that the door had
been left open due to a performance they had the night before, we just
needed
to make sure everything was in order before we left.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I had walked down the main center aisle
of the theater my flashlight went dead suddenly and at the same time I
could
hear what sounded like a woman singing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It wasn&#8217;t upstairs, it was clearly in front of me but distant.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I called my friend (the custodial manager) to
assist because I could barely see the stage without my flashlight and
when
we<span style="">&nbsp; </span>both approached the stage in the dark
his flashlight died too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We clearly
heard a woman singing from the stage area, but wasn&#8217;t sure whether it
was a
radio left on or whether there was actually someone on or below the
stage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since we had no way of seeing, we
went back
to the lobby where we turned on every light in the building so we could
investigate more thoroughly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once the
house lights were on, the singing stopped.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Needless to say, it scared the s**t out of me and we left
promptly after
we determined there was no one down there. Note also, our flashlights<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>worked perfectly outside <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span

building, and it was warmer outside than inside
that building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did my very best NOT to
go in this building again, especially alone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Also one other thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
pentagram on the floor of the attic was in Joyce Hall (all male
freshman

my name is Christian<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and I have a story to
share about a haunted
attraction at Disneyland.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Disneyland
Railroad:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Legend says that the Fred
Gurley locomotive number 3 is the most haunted locomotive on the
Disneyland
railroad not only because she is the oldest locomotive of the fleet but
also
due to a disturbing incident that happened during the mid 1960s when
engineer
Harley Ilgen suffered a fatal heart attack when operating the Fred
Gurley
locomotive through the Grand Canyon diorama.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Shortly after his death, many cast members have noticed strange
activity
going on with the Fred Gurley locomotive.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On a cold winter's night, both cast members and guest would
sometimes
see an apparition of a ghostly white figure in the Cab of the Fred
Gurley
locomotive when no one was in the cab.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On some evenings as Fred Gurley slowly steams through It's A
Small
World, the bell of the locomotive has sometimes been known to ring on
it's own
without the hand of the fireman pulling on the tether.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And when stopped in a station, the bell of
the Fred Gurley has been known to<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ring
on it's own without the work of a mortal fireman.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Fred Gurley<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>was Engineer Harley Ilgen's favorite locomotive, and rumor has
it that
Harley will come along for the ride and ring the bell of his favorite
locomotive to make his presence known.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I was reading the stories on here and i felt like
I could write and tell of the one and only ghost encounter i have ever
expierianced. it was not scary but i was rather entriged as to why it
visited
but i did find out<span style="">&nbsp; </span>its rather long so
please bear with<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>here goes.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>i was about 10 im now 24<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it
happened in walsall in the UK<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>i
lived with my mom and dad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my dad was a
long distance lorry driver and i
never really saw him as he would be gone for days it was on this night
in 1998
that he was away.i was in bed and at around 11pm i heard my mom in her
bedroom
talking to someone i being only 10 and missing my dad i thought that he
had
phoned even though i had not heard the phone ring so i got out of bed
and
walked to my door and my mom was defanatly talking to someone although
i cannot
recall anything that was being said i dont even emember if she was
talking
english as i didnt understand it. my moms room was next to mine so<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>walked out of my room . i opened my moms door
to be met by a man he didnt turn to face me or even acknowledge i was
there
just carried on talking so i looked around the door and my mom was
sitting up
in bed with a smile on her and didnt notice i was there like the man
she
carried on the convasation with him. still i could not understand what
any of them
were saying.. i was kinda freaked out normally my mom would pat the bed
and
tell me come get a cuddle. anyway standing by this man i felt happy and
safe so
i thought i would leave them to talk and went back to bed i fell
straight to
sleep. in the morning my mom was cooking breakfest and i asked her who
the man
was that was here last night she said what do you mean so i explained
the night
before. she asked me what he wearing and i said dark brown/green army
uniform
and what i would now know as a cpl's hat and uniform with short brown
hair very
tall and skinny. she said that it was my grandad that i had never met
so i was
kinda upset that he hadnt even said hello to me and that he had left
without
meeting me i asked my mom what they were talking about and she said
grown up
stuff. so i left it a few days then i asked her and my dad why my
granddad
didnt talk to me and they sat me down mom got a photo and asked me if
that was
the man i had saw i smiled and said yes and when i was by him i felt
happy it
was then my mom told me that he had died 2 months before i was born
fighting<span style="">&nbsp; </span>on the other side of the world
i was shocked as he seemed so real when i saw him and i could hear him
talking.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>nothing else was said
apart
from that before he died he said he couldnt wait to meet me and hold me.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>i wish i had known what he was saying to her,
a couple of weeks later my mom passed away in my arms.after getting
over my
grief and thinking about this incident over 14 years i no that the
night my
grandad came it was to tell my mom that it was her time to go and he
would be
waiting for her and that is why she was smiling cuz she got to be with
her dad
again. not all ghosts and spirits are bad some. and my grandad was an
amazing
man when he was alive and when he was a spirit.. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

 style="font-size: 16pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Athough
I am fascinated by spirits and stories of
the like, I never really wanted to experience it firsthand. My
boyfriend and I
went to stay in cabin that was built before 1820. We were asleep the
first
night when he was awaken to footsteps coming up the stairs. He went so
far as
to grab a weapon to protect us and waited to see a head emerge from the
top of
the steps. That head never appeared. The footsteps stopped and he went
back to
sleep. I never heard them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We came back
home and went about our business. I have lived in my townhome for 11
years and
absolutely nothing has ever happened here. I decorated for Christmas
and hung a
bell on the doorknob in the basement. As my 2 daughters and I were
wastching tv
one night, I heard the bell ring. I asked my older daughter if she
heard that
and she said 'yes, it's the bell in the basement'. The cat was beside
us and
there are no drafts. It's a heavy bell. The next occurance was a week
or so
later. My boyfriend was asleep on the couch when I came home from work.
It was
about 2 am. We chatted and as he was falling back asleep, I heard the
bell
again. I thought he had fallen asleep and was disappointed that he
missed it.
But when I said 'did you hear that?' he sat up quickly and said 'Yes! I
didn't
realize what I was hearing'. Again, my cat was next to us. The third
thing that
happened was that our tv shut off on it's own the other day. The girls
and I
were watching it and suddenly it just flipped off. The remote was
actually in
another room. That could have an explanation but they bell cannot.
Although,
our tv has never shut off on it's own. I don't know if spirits can
follow you
but the whole thing sure is odd. Just thought I would share what
happened with
us. Thanks so much!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">My
first encounter with a ghost was at the tender
age of four years old. There were heavy footsteps coming down the
stairs. I
frantically yelled out and said who is it? And the invisible being just
halted
on the creaky step and then continued coming down the stairs I sprinted
to the
front door and stood on my tippy toes to unlock the two bolted locks.
And raced
up the street into the arms of my babysitter. And when she asked me why
I was
outside. I simply told her that I was happy to see her. And I could
never tell
a soul what I had experienced till I became an adult. (The memory of
that
experience still remains very vivid!)At that young age...I had a very
strong
feeling that I was not alone in that house. (E.S.P.)Afterwards more
strange
things started happening....I started seeing black blobs of shadows
glide
across the doors, seeing full body outline forms of a man in black and
wearing
a cap, a woman sitting on the coffee table with long hair and starring
at the
window. This took place in the old house we live in now. And there is
something
that really freaked me out sometime ago...I could not shake the feeling
I had
of being heavily watched/starred down. As I walked up the stairs, I
turned
around and saw two tiny red bright eyes looking up at me. And it was
faceless!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And I would say the height was
that of a
small child 3-4 years old. After that experience I have not seen the
faceless
red eyes. I have questioned myself over and over....Was it a small
child or
something else (The devil/demonic?).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
could go on and on about my ghost experiences....I have kept a log of
what I
have experienced and will write a novel about my true haunting's. To
share with
others that have experienced something strange or stranger than me. I
remind
myself that I am sane after I see, smell or hear something that is out
of the
ordinary. And then I would humor myself and say oh, it's you again
visiting. I
can feel when I'm not truly alone and I guess that is a good thing for
having a
built in alert system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On my vacation
sometime age...I took some pictures and this particular photo was of
the moon
night and the palm trees and the ocean. After I had the photos
developed I
discovered that what I was looking at were two define body misty forms.
walking
in the ocean. I titled it: The Ghost Lady &amp; Companion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I <span style="">&nbsp;</span>sent
a friend a copy of the photo for confirmation and he agreed that, it
was a
ghost mist in my photo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ms.Carlson<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I just wanted to share with you my true ghost
stories and I would like to say again....I am a firm believer in ghost
due to
my experience encounters with them!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and another person where in route at 2:30 am in
the morning, in a truck to go north for a delivery. The weather was
raining, thunder,
lighting. As we passed the Stockerton exit heading north ,we noticed
something
up ahead us. We drove up on the object faster than expected. We noticed
it was
a tractor trailer crossing the highway directly in front of us. There
was no
road or cross over there to the south bound side. We had the same
reaction, getting
ready for an impact. The closer we got ,the more detail we can see
,like the
ribbet in the trailer the tires the entire trailer, the color and type
of
tractor. We were ready to collide when we passed right threw it. Our
hearts
pumping in adrenalin, We both knew what happened and what we saw. A
phantom
rig. We called it the phantom 33...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">March
1989<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ridgecrest,
California<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I found a great apartment in
Ridgecrest, California. It was a brand new complex in 1989. I looked at
a
ground floor apartment, perfect for me and my three young children, and
signed
the lease. It was so clean and new, I felt certain that we were the
first ones
to live in it. Our furniture and belongings would be arriving later, so
the
first night in our new home we had just a suitcase and a diaper bag in
an empty
place. I emptied the suitcase and left it open in the middle of the
living room
floor for my kids, then aged 11 months, 2 and 3 years old, to climb on
and
play. I was smiling at my daughters as they play. I could see my middle
child
across the room with a baby doll and my youngest as she sat by the
suitcase
playing with a rattle. Suddenly a toddler size hand came out from under
the
small space of the suitcase top, grabbed the rattle out of the baby&#8217;s
hand,
smacked her with it quite hard, dropped it into her lap and disappeared
back
under the suitcase top. The baby began to cry right away. I picked her
up to
comfort her and said, &#8220;Nicky, you come out from under there right now!
You&#8217;re
in big trouble!&#8221; Both of my daughters were in full view, so I assumed
the small
hand belonged to my little son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every
hair on my body stood up when his voice answered me from behind, way
down the
hall, in the bathroom. So whose hand was that under the suitcase top? I
slowly
lifted up the suitcase top with my foot as I peered underneath. Nothing
was
there. I started to feel myself panic. What had I seen? I definitely
saw the
little hand. It grabbed the rattle from the baby. Hit her with it.
Threw it
down and disappeared back under the top of the suitcase. The baby had a
red
mark on her thigh and cried. It really did happen. I told myself that I
was
just tired and imagining things and it was time to get some sleep.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Around midnight, I was awakened by the sounds
of footsteps outside our apartment in the gravel. It made me feel
creepy
because my apartment was on the very end next to open desert. I peeked
out the
window. I could hear the footsteps loud and clear, pacing back and
forth in the
gravel, but I couldn&#8217;t see anyone. The footsteps were going from the
back of
the building, down the entire length of the apartment, to the front.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I went to a different room and looked out that
window. Still, I could hear the footsteps, but absolutely no one was
out there
or even in the vicinity. I went from window to window until I had
checked from
every angle. The steps had the sound of a large man wearing work boots
and
continued until around three in the morning. This went on every single
night
without fail the entire time that we lived there. Pacing, pacing. <span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>Other strange little things would go on all
the time. Sometimes I would feel a child tug on my shirttail, only to
turn
around and see no one there. Sometimes I would hear children playing in
the
bedrooms when all three of mine were with me in the living room. I knew
it was
paranormal, but this was a brand new apartment. The manager said we
were the
lucky first ones to get to live in it. How could there be a history if
no one
had lived here before? I couldn&#8217;t quite figure the puzzle out.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>One day, a few weeks into our new place, we
had all the windows open and the kids and I were playing and having fun
together. I thought I could smell something burning, but I wasn&#8217;t sure.
<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Plus, all the windows were open, so I
couldn&#8217;t be sure of where it might be coming from. The smell became
stronger
and then black smoke started pouring in my sliding glass door. I ran
outside
and looked up, the black smoke was coming out of my upstairs neighbors
apartment. I ran back into my place and dialed 911 and reported that
the
upstairs apartment was on fire. Then I ran back outside with the kids.
The
other neighbors started coming out to see what was going on and then we
discovered that it wasn&#8217;t a true fire. My neighbor had fallen asleep
with food
on the stove. I dialed 911 back and apologized profusely, I hadn&#8217;t
meant to
call in a false alarm, I was so sorry, I thought it was a fire. The
dispatcher
was very nice and told me not to worry, it&#8217;s better to be safe than
sorry, but
the fire dept had to continue in to be sure everything was alright. So,
anyway,
the scene cleared and my new neighbors invited me in to laugh about it
and
introduce ourselves. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Shortly after,
my
son came to me and said, &#8220;Mommy, there are two men at the door who want
to talk
to you. And they have briefcases and badges.&#8221; I thought, &#8220;Oh no!
They&#8217;re going
to arrest me for calling in a false alarm!&#8221; I walked to the door and
these two
men were FBI agents and they asked to come inside. As we sat down in
the living
room, the one agent asked if I had made any changes to the thermostat
on the
water heater. Thoroughly confused now, I replied that &#8220;no&#8221;, I had not
adjusted
it, that I had actually never even thought to look at it. He smiled and
said
that was great and asked if he could photograph the water heater and
the
bathtub. I said &#8220;Sure&#8221; with a completely lost expression and he said,
&#8220;Perhaps
I should explain. We are doing a you with her boyfriend and two young
sons. One
night while she was at work, the boyfriend immersed the two year boy in
the tub
full of scalding water. He died of his injuries.&#8221; So finally I knew the
missing
piece of the puzzle. We weren&#8217;t the first ones to live there. It had a
history,
a short but a horrific one. I think perhaps the footsteps were residual
of the
boyfriend who may eternally pace back &amp; forth out there after
killing this
innocent baby boy. Who knows?! <o:p></o:p></span></p>
