<p class="MsoNormal">I grew up in this house, built in 1959 on a new sight where
the woods had been cut away for a new subdivision. Split level brick home, we
were the first to live there, from 1960 to the early 80's. The 'entity' was
much like that of the Comedy Store in <st1:City><st1:place>Hollywood</st1:place></st1:City>,
where I now live. A dangerous 'entity' capable of moving inanimate objects and
invading and manipulating people in a manner much more horrifying than anything
seen in the Exorcist. The activity seemed to emanate from the basement. Those
who owned the house after we were finally able to leave ( it wasn't easy ) have
experienced wierd occurances, nothing as over the top as we experienced.
Whatever it was ( is ) was eager to present itself or make it's presence known
any time of the day or night. A sickening feeling and deep cold announced it's
presence.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I should say that A LOT was left out where Bartonville's
Asylum was concerned, many photos have been taken and this is not a place one
would ever want to enter at night. The <st1:City><st1:place>Madison</st1:place></st1:City>
theatre in <st1:City><st1:place>Peoria</st1:place></st1:City> is haunted and in
<st1:City><st1:place>Elgin</st1:place></st1:City> there used to be a classic
haunted house.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Here in <st1:City><st1:place>Hollywood</st1:place></st1:City>,
there are dozens of astonishing sights, The Knickerbocker Hotel, The Argyle and
dozens more. Over thirty people have jumped from the <st1:place>Hollywood</st1:place>
sign, the first being Peg Entwhistle.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">okay, just for the record im not a loon, i am normal, have a
normal job, not crazy at all.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i was staying at my friends house, where we all planed to
sleep in the livingroom, laura and dave and myself.i knew dave was leaving
early in the morning fo work at <st1:time minute="0" hour="6">6am</st1:time>. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i woke to go to the loo in the night and found laura had
gone to bed in her own room upstairs so it was just me and dave sleeping in the
livingroom.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">it was getting light when i found myself awake, even though
i felt tired. i awoke sudenly but peacfully, and i was very much awake (did not
dream this!).</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i was wondering why i was awake (in my head, not out loud)
when i heard breathing. two sets of deep in+out heavy breaths, i instantly
thought oh its ok its dave breathing. the next thing i thought was 'hang on,
daves not here(he had left for work) and straight afdter that thought came
'laura said her house was haunted . .' </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">before i could even ponder that i heard a voice, an older
mans voice right in my ear, so close i could feel him near me wispering he said
"i'll wrap you in my grave". he sounded full of malice and just
really hatefull.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i was terrified, and was stuck in that position i was so
afraid. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">after about 15 mins i held my hands over my ears and
screamed and screamed till laura came down, but where i had my eyes closed when
she tried to get me to realise she was there i thought it was the ghost and
screamed more! :p</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">she says i was hysterical for a while untill she calmed me
down. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">it was not a dream.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">laura then told me, her sister used to wake in the night
because she couldent breath and felt like someone was sitting on her chest.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">lauras mum told me that laura, when she was little, used to
ask who the people in her house were when there was no-one there but herself
and her mum.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i had trouble sleeping for months after, and still cant
sleep on that side or with the lights off alone.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">when he said the word 'wrap' i had a visual image of
cherries, which i thought was strange, it was like somone saying in german a
word u regonise when you only speak english.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">what he said dosent make much sense but when i told my mum
she thought he might have said 'rape' and not 'wrap' . it sounded like wrap
though.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">well thats it hope u dont think im mad ;)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Many years ago, I lived in a huge old farm house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was pretty big and I was newly
married.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We would have friends stay
periodically as they needed to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had
many things happen.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The one bedroom always had flies in the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would spray, vacuum and scrub the windows
but the next day, the room was full of flies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My best friend and her husband needed a place to stay for awhile and I
let them choose the room they wanted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They chose the room of flies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
one night she was sleeping and felt someone pushing her to roll over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She thought her husband had gotten up in the
middle of the night and was coming back to bed, but when she rolled over, she
fell against her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She looked to
see who pushed her and although no one was there, she felt the pressure of
someone lying against her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She tried to
wake her husband but he would not wake up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was so scared, she stayed awake the rest of the night until morning
and was too afraid to look and see what was next to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, once daylight hit, she felt the
pressure leave and noticed an indention of a body left behind on the bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They never slept in that room again.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We also had dogs that would not go upstairs or
downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was doing dishes in the
kitchen and the upstairs stairwell was behind me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of a sudden, my dog perked up and his
hair stood on his back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He started to
growl as he was looking towards the doorway and suddenly bolted for the
livingroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would not come in the
kitchen after that unless I was with him. My dogs also would stand at the
doorway to the basement and would have their hair raised on their backs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was always scared to go down there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would get a really bad feeling where I
would run down and back up as fast as I could.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I would try and get one of my dogs to go with me, even in daylight, and
they would not go further than the doorway.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We would also hear someone walking through the house, but no
one would be there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The one spirit would
be talking and we would look for the voice and could not find it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes it would call out our names and we
would think it was each other and answer and find out it wasn&#8217;t anyone calling.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We slept in a downstairs bedroom and I would have a sense of
a man standing at the foot of our bed, watching us go to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our dogs even had to sleep with us and would
not sleep at the foot of the bed.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After many strange activities, our neighbor told us an
elderly man had lived alone in the house for a long time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His mail had been piling up in his mailbox so
the mailman contacted the police to have them check on the old guy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was found dead on the kitchen floor and
had been there for quite awhile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
funny thing is, the kitchen was never spooky feeling.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi, my name is Ayme, and I want to share something that
happened to my family about 9 years ago. I have some free time on my hands, so
I might as well. As I said about nine years ago my husband, I and our 4
children (ages 12, 11, 9 and 5) moved into this small 4 bedroom house. From the
day we moved in we knew there was something about the house. It wasn't really a
bad feeling, but something different. The feeling was almost welcome, like we
were meant to be there. We were happy to be there, it was a comfortable house
for people who were used to living in apartments. We had bedrooms, a living
room, bathroom and a kitchen on the first floor. And a bedroom with bathroom
and a small porch, plus a larger room with a smaller room off to the left on
the second floor.At one time the house had 2 apartments. The upstairs had 1
bedroom with bathroom, a living room and a small kitchen off to the left. The
first floor had 2 bedrooms a bathroom,living room and kitchen with access to a
basement. At the time we found this house seemed almost like a God send since
we were being evicted because we had aquired a Dog. And this house had a nice
sized yard and the landlord did not mind pets. Well soon after we moved in
strange things started to happen. Since I was a stay at home mom most of the
time due to being the parent of a ADHD(Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder)
child, I was the one to experience most of the phenomenon. You see while my
husband was at work and the kids at school, I would hear light foot steps
downstairs. But for anyone who has lived in apartments your first thought is
" it's the neighbors," until you come to the realization that you are
now living in a house and there is no way you are going to hear the neighbor
whom does not live upstairs or downstairs ( It's a single family home for
crying out loud!). But I put it out of my mind telling my self I was so used to
hearing the patter of small feet, that i could still hear it when no one is at
home. We had minor things happen like, The footsteps when there was only one
person home. Things disappearing and turning up some where you knew it
shouldn't be, sightings by a friend who had never been to our house, and
finally the sound of a small die cast toy car falling down the stairs and
hitting the back door. At night once all the kids were asleep( when you're a
parent you can tell when the kids are asleep just by listening) You can hear
the sound of a small toy car falling down the stairs and hit the back door (
which happened to be a thick wooden door ). For any one who has small boys you
know what a hotwheels sounds like when it hits any surface because you've heard
it before). Anyway, this is what my husband and I heard on a nightly basis. One
day, about 8 months of living there a friend of my husband brought over a new
girlfriend for us to meet. As far as we were concerned nothing out of the
ordinary happened that day until Jimmy ( my husbands Friend ) Brought by his
girlfriend ( <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
). At this point I should explain a few things. First off, the bedroom with the
bathroom belonged to my husband and I, the large room that used to be a living
room became our " computer room" and the little room off to the left
became our daughter's room. Secondly we did not allow our kids to have friends
over, due to things disappearing when ever certain friends came over. Well the
next time <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
came over she asked us how many kids we had and I told her 3 boys and 1 girl.
Then she asked us who the little boy downstairs had been. And I asked her what
little boy. She said the last time she had visited us there had been a little
dark skinned boy in diapers playing Nintendo 64 with my kids. And I told her
politely there was no other child but mine in the house. She insisted that
" I saw another little boy in diapers today and the last time I came
playing Nintendo 64 with your kids!" I told her she was mistaken as my
kids were not allowed to have friends over. Well of course she dropped it after
that, but to this day she still swears there was a little boy in diapers in our
house. At other times when I was alone at home I would hear someone knocking on
my bedroom door, and I would automatically ask " what ? " and then
realize there was no one home but me when I received no answer. This happened
to me a lot. Sometimes I would hear some one playing in the boys' rooms
downstairs when the kids were at school. About 1 year after we moved in my
oldest and I took newspaper routes. About 4 months after we started our paper
routes, I was rolling newspapers before delivering them when the front page
caught my eye. The picture on the front page looked like my house, but there
were toddler toys on the lawn and I had no toddlers at the time. So I proceeded
to read it and found out that exactly 1 year before we moved in a little black
boy of about 1 years of age had died in the home. It seems Miles had been
living there with his foster mother, her father and her children. One day the
foster mother went out and left her father to watch little Miles. While she was
out her father in a fit of rage hit Miles while the little boy was at the top
step on the second floor ( which by the way happened to be near my bedroom
door). The little boy lost his balance upon being struck and fell down the
stairs and broke his neck. As I read this little things began to fall into
place and I realized that maybe Miles was still there. The last thing to happen
there was about three months before we moved out. It was late and my husband
and I were still up talking and watching TV, when again we heard the little car
falling down the steps and hit the back door. I knew my kids were sleeping
because that was the only sound in an otherwise silent house. So I jokingly
said " Alright Miles, It is late, and it's bed time for little kids and
even little ghosts. What I heard next chilled me to the bone and freaked me out
so bad I was almost in tears. As soon as I said that I heard a tiny little
giggle, which my husband also heard, and I promptly said " do what ever
you want!". As I said before, up to this point we had thought we were
imagining everything that happened there and never wanted to believe we had a
ghostly tenant. The strange thing is that we were never scared while we lived
there, the feeling living there was we are home and this is where we were meant
to live. Unfortunately due to circumstances beyond our control we had to move,
otherwise we would still be living there. It was the most comfortable place I
have ever lived in and I loved it there! I have other stories that have
happened to family members,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and myself.
Maybe I will share some more some other time. For now, I hope you enjoy this
story and maybe can tell me if it was really a haunting after all. I still keep
trying to tell myself we imagined it all, or maybe deep down we hoped for a
ghost story in our lives. I just don't know what the case was.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By: Randall<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Hello my name is Randy and I`ve been reading many of the
true ghost stories on ur site and I must say some of this stuff is genuine and
it sends chills down my spine.I know from experience.To tell this story we have
to go back to the 70`s.the city of Toronto.My Mom and my stepdad were in a band
my mom left my stepdad for a woman in the band and we [meaning me and my
younger brother,my mom and her lover]moved into a rooming house.Two rooms on
the second foor w/kitchen and bathroom.On a street called Bertmount near Pape
and Queen.The first day we moved there maggots came crawling out from
underneath the baseboard of one of the walls in my room.My Mom and her
girlfriend shrieking and squishing bugs.Anyway my Mom would leave me and my
brother there alone at night so she could play music with the band.Besides the
lady who lived on the first floor had three boys my age and she would come up
periodicaly during the nite ,or right away if we called out.Well it started out
that when everyone was gone and my brother was asleep I would hear the voice of
a child quietly muttering or praying and I wasn`t the least bit frightened,at
first.Now please keep in mind this was a long time ago and I don`t remember
anything in particular it said to me but it was like an imaginary friend I
assumed.Then one nite,I was in a mood or something,and for some reason I was
being cruel to my younger brother{as children sometimes are},And he went to
sleep crying.Now this spirit or entity took on a much more terrifying
persona.Now it hated me.And nite time was now a horrifying experience.There
were a few things that it did almost nightly like yanking the covers off
,or<span style="">&nbsp; </span>making it seem as though a huge rat
was underneath the covers,scream profanities constantly,rattle the dishes that
were left to dry on the counter.I would beg my Mom to stay home and scream for
that poor woman who lived downstairs.Or I would try to keep my brother awake
but he could sleep through anything.The most terrifying thing that ever
happened was this ball of lite red at first but it changed as travelled up and
down the wall,spitting electricity.I was so scared most of the time I couldn`t
move.It got so bad I couldn`t sleep ,and kids at school were accusing me of
wearing makeup[eyeshadow].I became accident prone and finally got poked in the
eye by some girl at school and my mother sent me to stay at my grandmothers for
a month.By the time I recovered,we moved away a few days after I returned.For
years I never told this to anyone.No one believed me when I was a kid.But
nothing like that has ever happened to me since.It seemed like for awhile I
even forgot it happened.But not anymore.There are a couple of things I learned
from this experience first thing was that spirit was a child and secondly that
spirits do exist.And lastly I`m no psychic detective or anything,but I`ll bet
there`s a body buried behind the wall in that room!Who knows,maybe someday I`ll
go back there and check it out.Well thanks for letting me get this out of my
system,and thanks for listening to my tale.Goodbye and Goodnite<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

haunting</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This is for the KC-135 reference under Fairchild Air Force
Base in <st1:State><st1:place>Washington</st1:place></st1:State>. I&#8217;m a crew
chief stationed out at Fairchild, and the jet you&#8217;re referring to is 58-0050,
known to those of us in Maintenance as &#8220;Spook 50&#8221;. Although I can&#8217;t remember
the exact occurrences behind either death on that jet, it is true that two
people have died on separate occasions. You accounts of temporary power losses,
items falling off mounting points, moans, and strange fuel leaks are true. Some
other incidents that have happened while I&#8217;ve worked the night shift there are:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In the control cabin (cockpit) there is a chair just to the
left of the door to the cargo area (as in all KC-135s). A crew chief I know
(who&#8217;s name I won&#8217;t use, as I doubt he&#8217;d want it known) was sitting in this seat
one night filling out maintenance forms for the jet, and happened to glance to
his right, and saw just out the corner of his eye, a &#8220;dark&#8221; hand reaching
toward his right shoulder as if someone were leaning out to grab him from the
doorway. Since then he has outright refused to go up into that jet for any
reason, whether day or night. The same is for the others I&#8217;ll tell you about,
and for myself.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Another incident happened while towing Spook 50 out of a
hangar onto a parking spot. When towing jets, someone has to sit in the pilot&#8217;s
seat so that he can hit the brakes in case of an emergency. During this tow, I
was walking along the left wingtip to ensure we wouldn&#8217;t hit the hangar door.
The crew chief &#8220;upstairs&#8221; started freaking out, on the verge of panic, saying
that he heard a voice in the jet calling his name and making &#8220;banging&#8221; sounds
in the far back (where it&#8217;s normally near pitch dark, even in daytime) of the
cargo area. After the tow was completed he couldn&#8217;t get off the jet fast
enough, and we could all tell he was visibly shaken and scared.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Yet another crew chief and buddy of mine was on Spook 50
during our shift inspecting panels and rivets on the wings. When he was done
and putting the over-wing hatches back in place, his flashlight went out on him.
He already was familiar with the hauntings on the jet and had two other
flashlights with him. Overkill probably, but can you blame him? Neither of the
other two flashlights would work, and even after jockeying batteries and light
bulbs around, they wouldn&#8217;t work. When our truck pulled up to take him inside
from the jet, we saw him climb down the crew entry ladder, and the second his
feet were back on the ground, the one flashlight in his hand came on. He summed
it up best by saying &#8220;I&#8217;m calling shenanigans. That jet hates maintainers.&#8221;</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I myself have heard strange noises, though not the groans
mentioned in your description. Before being put on night shift, I worked days,
and a few times could just barely make out voices having a conversation inside
the jet, even though I was the only one up there. The voices were quiet enough
that I couldn&#8217;t make out anything being said. I could only hear tones and
sounds that at least sounded like human speech. The next part of this takes
some understanding of our jets to really get. In the back of the cargo area,
underneath the floor is what we call the &#8220;boom pod&#8221;. It&#8217;s basically just that,
a pod, where the boomer climbs in, lies on his stomach, and controls the boom
during aerial refueling operations.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Later that same day I was working outside the jet when
another co worker was upstairs, shutting down power. When he came down he gave
me a weird look and said &#8220;weren&#8217;t you just upstairs in the boom pod?&#8221; I told
him no, and he suddenly looked scared. He said he was sure he saw me (or
someone) climb into the boom pod. He even saw and heard the grate open and
close when &#8220;I&#8221; climbed in. After I assured him that I wasn&#8217;t upstairs while he
was, all he could say was &#8220;We&#8217;re getting the f*ck out of here&#8221;. Whichever of
the ghosts in Spook 50 is manifesting itself, it&#8217;s certainly not friendly,
though to date it hasn&#8217;t hurt anyone.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Hope this gives you some extra reading to put on your great
site. Peace, from <st1:country-region><st1:place>Kyrgyzstan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Experiences Since I was 8</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: Elsii121@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Hi, I have experienced<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>haunting's since I was about 5 or 6 years old. The very first time was
when my family moved into the house my uncle owned we lived downstairs and they
lived upstairs. It was an old pretty house, well<span style="">&nbsp; </span>after a few weeks of living there one summer,
my dad went tot he grocery store though it's strange my parents would leave me
alone at home because I hated leaving the house<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The grocery store was on the corner anyway. So that day I was alone and
I heard someone walking up stairs, thinking it was my aunt and cousins I went
upstairs where they always left the door open for us I walked in and no one was
in the he house, I check the living and bathroom the kitchen no one was there
but I kept hearing someone behind me then out of no where this doll appeared by
the door, it wasn't there when I walked in. II wasn't very scared but just a
little shook up I went downstairs and stayed in my living room looking out the
window for my dad to come home. Well we ended dup moving 3 years later when I
was 8. This time we moved into this Victorian style home, cherry wood and old
heaters, very romantic with a small chandelier, I fell in love with the house (
I've always loved old homes)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>months
after moving in I would hear someone in the bathroom rummaging or washing their
hands I would walk in there no one would be there everything would stop,
sometimes later I would sometimes be sitting in the kitchen eating cereal and I
saw a tall man with another oddly tall woman not dressed in Victorian wear but
still old fashioned maybe 1930's or 40's,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I saw them standing down the hall in there straight at me I looked at
them for a little bit and then they were gone. They were misty and I remember
seeing the sun shining through them it was very calm. Other times that I stayed
home alone in this new house I would hear someone waking up the stairs and then
it would stop if I would cal out, one day they didn't stop I was watching TV it
then turned off and I couldn't figure out why, so I sat on the couch playing
with a little music recorder I liked talking into, I heard my name being called
from the stairs, it didn't sound like my dad but in my head I was forcing
myself to think it was and I called out "daddy" no one answered I
just kept hearing my name and someone walking closer up the stairs I heard the
footsteps and my name I became really frightened and I heard a soft chuckle of
a man, it wasn't treating. Well after that I had many more experiences now I am
18 and they have stopped. I kind of miss them and sometimes want to come in
contact again. That's some of my early experiences.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Story #1</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">About four years ago, my parents moved to a home in
Midnapore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We know nothing about the
homes past, but right after they moved in - strange things began to happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These odd things were only noticed by my
mother and my nephew.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My stepfather
never saw or heard anything strange and my mother was afraid to tell him, for
fear that he would put the house up for sale immediately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mom would notice that knick-knacks in her
china cabinet would be missing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
would show up again in the china cabinet, in a different spot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day she was coming downstairs and could
hear the television on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She thought to herself "that darn kid left the TV
on" and as she rounded the corner, it clicked off by itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was vaccuming one day and turned the
vaccuum off, but it kept going for about thirty seconds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The basement had motion detectors that would
go "blip, blip" when they detected motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">These were going off so often that eventually you didn't
even hear them anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mom would often
feel a presence watching her when she was downstairs doing laundry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The home had strange things in it, such as
holes in the walls that had been plastered up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One closet had the back of it plastered up and I used to tease her that
maybe a body was back there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My nephew
(who lives with my parents) used to complain (not be scared, but just</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">complain) that there was "someone" in his room
with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They lived in this house for
about two years.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Story #2</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I was sixteen (a<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>long, long, long time ago), I went to visit friends who lived in <st1:place><st1:City>Medicine
  Hat</st1:City>, <st1:State>Alberta</st1:State></st1:place> (<st1:country-region><st1:place>Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was to stay with them for one week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My first night there, they showed me the
guest room, in the basement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was not a
jumpy kid but was uneasy about the accommodations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Once in the basement, you had to cross all the way across to
the other end - turn down a hallway and the bedroom was down that hall, with a
bathroom directly across from it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
first night there, I tried to convince the dog to come downstairs and sleep
with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would have none of that! I
resorted to carrying the poor creature downstairs but once we got down there,
he bolted back upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It didn't help
that the walls were covered in animal heads - deer, elk, etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was and still is absolutely horrifying
to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More horrifying in fact than
meeting a ghost face to face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyhow, I
slept down there the first night without incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A day or two later, I went into the laundry
room, which was also in the basement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Hanging behind the door was the creepiest little puppet (it
was actually a</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">marionette)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that I
have ever seen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now I am not making this
up for the sake of dramatics, but this hideous thing would be swinging back and
forth every time I went into that laundry room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would stop swinging when it was facing me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If I went into the laundry room with anyone
else, it was completely still and usually facing the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could not and still cannot figure that one
out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyhow, one night I decided to take
the dog for a walk (actually, I was sneaking out to smoke cigarettes) and out I
went.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was gone for one or two hours
and when I returned home, the house was dark.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Someone was showering in the upstairs bathroom, but the kids
were in bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I decided to go downstairs
and get ready for bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lights were
off - I turned them on and went downstairs to my room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I headed into my room, I noticed that the
bathroom across the hall had a light on and the door was shut closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't think anything about it, but walked
into the room and took my nightgown, toothbrush, etc out of the suitcase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned around and the door to the bathroom
stood wide open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The light was off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought to myself "geez, I must be in
trouble"....... but carried on getting ready for bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I eventually made my way upstairs to face the
music.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My host was still in the bathroom
and I sat in the upstairs living room waiting for him. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>He eventually came
out of the bathroom and came and sat with me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I asked "is Darlene made at me for something?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His reply was "Darlene went to <st1:City><st1:place>Calgary</st1:place></st1:City>
tonight."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had made an offer on
a truck that was for sale and it was accepted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Darlene had been gone for hours.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He could sense that I was puzzled and asked me why.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I explained what happened downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One thing that has always troubled me, is he
very matter-of-fact stated to me "it must have been the wind" and got
up and left me sitting there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How could
the wind turn a light on / off and OPEN a door?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I slept on the couch upstairs for the remainder of my trip.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Haunted House</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Not sure I believe in ghosts, but we live in a house in
Brookeville (The Blue House) built in 1790 that might be haunted. My daughter
once saw an old woman sweeping the stairs (we two are the only ones living in
the house). I occasionally smell things cooking (coffee, shortcake, chocolate
cake), even though we're not close enough to the neighbors to smell their food.
No creepy feelings, though--she seems to be a good ghost.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Grandmas House</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In <st1:City><st1:place>conway</st1:place></st1:City>, <st1:State><st1:place>south
  carolina</st1:place></st1:State> I lived on <st1:Street><st1:address>Cates
  Bay Road</st1:address></st1:Street>. You could tell the house out from all
the other ones because it was the only one on a dirt road and all of the other
houses where by the highway. We lived with my grandma so the house was pretty
old. Her parents lived in and her parents parents' also lived in it and so on.
All in all the house has been through 13 generations. The house was also built
on top of slave head quarters. Whoever built the house thought it would be
"charming" to leave some of the quarters still standing. My grandma
always told me the house was haunted; I didn't believe her. Until one night
when a date was dropping me off and we sat in the drive way for a little while,
we got quite and all of a sudden we heard a white male voice shout, "get
back to work!" then we heard a whipping sound and a dish or glass break. I
told my date good nite and ran inside. When i got there I saw that it was only
my grandma in the house. Of course I knew my dad would never behave like that.
All grandma did was look at me and say,"Ya heard it too huh sonny..I told
you it was true." of course then I fainted. my grandma told me that my mom
use to lay in bed and listen to a black woman sing hymns. Grandma said it was
never frightening to her until she found out there was no black woman living in
the neighborhood. the kitchen to the quarters must have been in my grandma's
room because (no lie) it has a very distinct smell of fried chicken. The house
almost caught on fire one day. Mom was cooking peas on the stove and she put it
on low, she was gone for about 5 minutes and when she came back the knob had
been turned to high and the pot was on fire. When grandma died we moved out of
the house and out of <st1:City><st1:place>conway</st1:place></st1:City>. Too
many strange things for us to handle.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi. We have experienced something at our old house that we
lived in. One day my sister wasn't feeling good so she asked my mom if she can
stay home from school. Then all of a sudden the glass vase that was on our
shelf just flew off and crashed onto the ground. Nobody even touched the shelf
and there was no wind. It just flew off without an explanation. I believe it
was a ghost.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">One day a couple of years ago my sister and I were sleeping
in our rooms. My dad was in the living room watching t.v. waiting for my mom to
come back from work. Then he saw two kids that looked like my sister and I. He
told them to got to sleep but they would not listen. Then they ran out the door
but instead of opening the door and going out they went right through the door
outside. Right away he went to go see if we were still in our room.and there we
were. He was scared and didn't know what to think. After that we all became
believers of ghosts.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Ghosts of <st1:place><st1:City>Clay</st1:City>, <st1:State>Alabama</st1:State></st1:place>
and those of which are unknown...</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: macnanbio@mindspring.com </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><st1:place><st1:City>Clay</st1:City>,<st1:State>Alabama</st1:State></st1:place>
is a fairly new town. Most of it was farming land and nothing but swamos before
the new Middle School and high school went in about anywhere from <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9</st1:time> to 12 years ago. Thigns haven&#8217;t been the same
since.In the High School it is reported that lockers open and slam by
themselves and you don&#8217;t want to be out in Clay at night. You see many Indians
used to live there befor ethe land was bought and sold off piece by piece. In
the middle of the night sometimes you can here strange noises outside your
houses and the dogs and other animals in the area will act out for no reason at
all. Is this the work of a ghost? No real investigation has been done there,
but for those of us who live there, we know the truth. We all know that Clay is
indeed a haunted town.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>That is not the most
haunted place though. I live in the middle sized town of <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Grayson</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>Valley</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, and I have personally had
enough experiences to tell you that I personally believe that my house is
haunted. My first experience came when I was about 7 or 8 years of age. I
remember it was a school night and I had just layed down to bed. I don&#8217;t
remember much about it but I remember the room becoming very cold and it felt
as if someone sat down on the end of my bed. I layed there scared to move at
first but when I looked up there was no one there. Ever since then things have
been weird. At first I shrugged that experience off and told myself it wasn&#8217;t
true&#8230;boy was I wrong. It happened again when I was about 10 or so. I was
helping my mom carry in some groceries and as I approached the top of the
stairs I swore I heard the sound of children laughing. I immediately shrugged
it off and told myself that I imagined it, but my next incounter would leave my
breathless. When I was 13 my grandmother, whom I was very close to, passed
away. Right after she passed things seemed different. At first it was little
things. Like throwing things down and then coming back later to find that they
were gone and had somehow been put in there right places and small things like
that, but then something out of the ordaniary happened. One night about two or
three days after my grandmother&#8217;s funeral I was laying in bed when I happened
to notice something shining on my wall. I noticed it was about the size of a
small tomatoe and was a very beautiful blue color. I didn&#8217;t think anything
about it because I figured that it must have been the moon light shining off of
something but it kept coming back. Night after night it would appear and always
in the general area over my door just slightly over my wall. Then one night I
got up to see where the light was coming from. I couldn&#8217;t find a source anywhere.
From the way the moonlight was shining it couldn&#8217;t have been that and there was
nothing in sight for it to shine off of or anything like that. I was totally
freaked out. But by the next night it was gone and I never saw it again. The
last great encounter I had was this past summer. I was 14 about to turn 15. I
remember I had just gotten home from school and was doing my chores, which
included vaccuming the livingroom. There was this black fan that was sitting on
the floor and was plugged into the wall. I had to unplug it to plug the vacuum
in. The other spare plug was being used up by a lamp. I began to vaccum.
Shortly after I turned around to unplug the vacuum when I noticed that the lamp
was unplugged and the black fan had been plugged in and was no running on high.
I was absoloutly terrified. I ran in my room and shut my door and didn&#8217;t come
out till my dad got home. I am an only child and no one else was in the house
with me when the event occuried which places no one else there who could have
plugged the fan in&#8230;other than a ghost? I have since had other small experiences
that involve strang noises or talking that sounds distant. Sometimes though I
wonder if there is something more in my house than just me.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I don&#8217;t know much
about the history of my house or the property for which it sits on. I know only
that before us my house had two previous owners. First, a younger couple with
three children and when she got pregnant again they had to move. And after them
an older couple moved in. Then after they left we moved in. The house is only
about 20 to 30 years old, I know that much, but unfornatually that is all I
know at the given time.Maybe my experiences have something to do with my lost
family or maybe that of the previous families who lived there. Or maybe I have
so many experiences because in my family,we have a history of producing Mediums
and prophetics, or people who can sometimes see into the future without any
control over how to do it or when it is going to happen or sometimes things
just come to them. Anyhow.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>This is my story of <st1:place><st1:City>Clay</st1:City>,<st1:State>Alabama</st1:State></st1:place>
and of my possibly haunted house. I hope you will enjoy reading it and can
maybe offer me some tips about why these ghosts might be there or whatever it
is inside my house.</p>

help was needed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His death was very

course!!) Too many questions left unanswered!!!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It's just that ever since this
unfortunate event has taken place then the outside area has a
creepy,strange,almost make your hair wanna stand up feeling!! Especially at
night!! My dear sweet friend Mikey never believed in ghost until his son died
this tragic death!! Now he sees them!! Also several of us have seen what seemed
to be the profile of a ghostly shadow or human shaped mist!! very starnge i get
chill bumps just thinking about it!! My friend seems to think there is
something evil working here &amp; i get that same creepy feelin as well!! At
first I wasn't scared or frightenened b/c i thought if it was a ghost it was

several spots that we where gonna sit at when finally decided on th front deck
swing!! We were sitting there chatting when suddenly Mikey's big light, on the
front of his body shop,BLEW OUT!!! Now i have been told an old wives tale that
if someone close to you dies &amp; suddendly your lights start blowing that
they (your dead loved one!!) is tryin to contact you!! so needless to say when
that light blew I just about fell out!! Then suddenly we hear a loud BANG!!
That was all I needed to hear in my eyes it was time to<span style="">&nbsp; </span>GO!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
told my friend "come on let's get in my Passport &amp; leave i'll explain

<p class="MsoNormal">I have to tell you a story.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I was young my parents rented a house in Monmouth <st1:State><st1:place>Oregon</st1:place></st1:State>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was so happy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We walked all over downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was cool I liked it and I was very happy. <span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then I took the first flight of stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stairs turned right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They went up right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a room there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I went forward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I walked in this room I felt a horrible
icky feeling. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It was terrible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My parents did not know what I
felt. I did not tell them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was just
icky and dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that room I had a walk
in closet. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I felt so much like there was a woman in that closet. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I could not ever go in that closet or place any clothing in
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got in trouble for not hanging
up my clothes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I knew there was

<p class="MsoNormal">I don&#8217;t know if you still need stories or are updating this
site anymore but here is what happened to me as I can remember it&#8230;.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was watching TV late at night one summer in my room. All
of the lights were off; the only thing that was turned on was the TV. I was
watching a show on tape and I had paused the tape. Something caught my
attention out of the corner of my eye. I looked and for a couple of seconds,
this pair of eyes was staring at me from underneath my dresser. They were these
two red glowing eyes looking directly at me. I was only a couple feet away from
the dresser at the time and I was laying on my bed. Whatever it was had
disappeared after a couple of seconds of my looking at it. I quickly turned on
the light, thinking that it could be an animal but I did not see anything.
There is no way for some animal to get inside my room from the outside; there
weren&#8217;t any open doors or windows for an animal to somehow crawl in. A stayed
up for months after that, afraid I would see this thing again. But, I never
did. I was completely shocked when I looked at it that one night, I wasn&#8217;t
afraid though. I know I saw this because I can still see the image in my mind
of what I saw.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My family and I lived in this house on <st1:Street><st1:address>Merritt
  St.</st1:address></st1:Street>, in <st1:place><st1:City>Bridgeprto</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>Connecticut</st1:State></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were never really sure how many ghosts we
had in our house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before I was born, my
parents used to have family get togethersand birthday parties in our basement
that my parents had so beautifully redone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They used to be down in the basement with their guests, when they'd hear
what sounded like someone running upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When my dad used to go upstairs and look, he used to never find anyone
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then we had this plastic water
pitcher with a close and open top, well when we used to go and grab it to pour
ourselves more water, the top would pop off.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then when we put it down, the top would close.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Not only had the ghosts affected everyone in my family, but
it affected my brother and I the most.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The ghost or ghosts hated my little brother and would bother him in the
night saying they were going to kill him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The ghosts loved me, they wouldn't really bother me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although sometimes when I was in the basement
playing video games, I could feel them sitting next to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now I love hauntings and ghosts but after we sold our house
and moved to <st1:place><st1:City>Wilmington</st1:City>, <st1:State>NC</st1:State></st1:place>,
the ghosts seemed to follow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even today,
I know that they're there because sometimes when I look up, I can see a dark
figure go over me or past me and I know they're there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night, my brother and I were watching a
movie in our room, and a little boy's voice and a little girl's voice could
clearly be heard in the hallway behind my door.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My parents were asleep and on the other side of the house, our tv was
the only thing on and when we paused it we could still hear them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Rt. 55</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I just read your haunted website and was surprised that Rt
55 is not on it.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The rumor I heard was that it and the Deptford mall were
built on an old Indian burial ground. Supposedly an Indian chief still alive at
the time they opened Rt 55 put a curse on it, I believe a motorcyclist was
killed on that road when it first opened the ramp to RT 42, to be blamed on
this curse.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We always kidded about those ghosts. I worked at the Bank in
the mall, and we had swivel chairs. Some mornings we would come in and no
matter which way we turned the chairs, the backs would face each other, we said
the ghosts aren' t talking to each other that day! The space is no longer a
bank I think it is now Lane Bryant. This all happened between 1984-1991</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Former House</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hello, My name is David Wahl and I finally have to tell
about a former house I lived at in Round Lake Beach.We lived at 1320 Woodridge
Dr. in Round Lake Beach, Illinois.In the basement of this house by the sump
pump there was always a very cold chill, not only that but a cold chill was
felt down your back until you went back upstairs.We also had a problem with
sump pumps burning out, light bulbs were burned out fast, and the circuit
breaker for the washer and dryer would always pop.The "thing" in the
basement never seemed to want anyone downstairs, and once the lights went out
it seemed to chase you upstairs, my dog would never go in the basement and our
cats always came back upstairs immediately.We lived there 13 years and finally
sold the house and perhaps there is nothing to this but it was all too
coincidental with the cold feel in the corner by the sump and all the
electrical conditions.Well, thank you for listening and I just finally had to
tell my story.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Childhood Experiences</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By:mrctuba1802@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It wasn't until recently that I stumbled upon your sight as
I was researching the events that occured on <st1:Street><st1:address>112 Ocean
  Drive</st1:address></st1:Street>, Amityville. Since then I feel the need to
share my own experiences.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">All of these events occured when I was but a young boy. The
first one happened in the very first house I can remember living in. It was a
large two story house with many open rooms and hallways. The house was
"large" by my standards and I inherently feared several rooms within
the house, namely the main hallway, my own room and the dining room. My room
resided on the second floor just above the dining the main hallway ran through
the entire first floor. Now onto the experience. As a boy I had a nasty habit
of leaving my room and venturing through the main hallway, past the dining
room, and into the kitchen to fetch myself some goodies and a glass of water.
On one of my nightly expeditions are looked down the stairs into the main
hallway (which runs parallel to the open stairs) and I saw a shadowy figure
walk across the floor. It was the distinct shape of a medium sized man. Now, We
have a light that shines in from the backward into the hallway which has a full
window wall. When I shared this with my mother she insisted it was my mind
playing tricks on me and probably one of the cats shadows on the fence for a
nightly strole. but I swear up and down to this day there was nothing on the
fence and the only cat we had was staring a the floor, hissing through the
windows.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My second experience occured several years later, in a
different house and was much more terrifying than the last one. I remember I
was probably between 8 and 10 years of age. This house, since day one, gave me
a horrible feeling in my heart, one that seemed to only intensify during the
night hours. Unfortunately, I had not yet lost my habit of venturing out into
the kitchen at night, caused by a constant thirst. One event I was passing by
the living room when I saw a shadow fingure walk past the sliding glass door
and seemed to vanish into the corner darkness of the room. Fearful I ran bak to
my bedroom and quickly rocked myself to sleep. This alone was not enough to
disuade me though, as I would once again venture towards the kitchen. Only this
time as I kept my eyes locked on the living room, for sure that the same
aparition would show itself to me again, I was completely unaware of what lay
before. The entrance into my kitchen had long been an open entryway, and as I
turned to enter the kitchen there it stood before me just as plain and visible
as if I was standing before anyone else. I full image of a large male figure,
totally black, devoid of any and all features. It merely stood in the doorway
as if blocking my path. I screamed something horrible and ran to my mothers
room, awaking her in the process. I practically pulled her out of bed to come
see, when we arrived at the kitchen there was nothing there. I pleaded with my
mother to check everything. She informed me that nothing had been taken, no
doors had been broken in, nobody had come into the kitchen or the house in
general. Six months later we moved out of that house.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">That was over ten years ago and to this very day the memory
of that even gives me chills. It would be many years after that event occured
that my mother would tell me that she too felt an uneasiness within the house.
Something dark, and foreboding. I was just glad to know I wasn't crazy...</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Anomaly</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By: bruce_thomson@hotmail.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">At the age of 8, I recall heading out to school in the
morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be co-incidental, I can
not be sure, but it was St Patrick's day, I recall this from eating breakfast
beside the radio and listening to the day's news.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I was walking down the farm road (our place is a small
croft) I thought I saw what I recall to be someone on a mountain bike or racer
going past the road-end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon further
instpection, I was completely amazed and astounded to find that there was in
fact no bicycle there at all!!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It took
me about precicely 5 minutes to piece together the reality of the situation,
despite the sudden apparent unexplainable logic of it all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As I looked closer and closer from about an approximate
distance of 500ft I could in fact 100% verify that there was indeed no bicycle
that was propelling the movement of this figure at all!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, for every 1 step that the figure
took, it was equal to about 4 human steps...</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Given the trauma that I entailed upon verifying this, I only
recall, dropping to the ground completely without speech to explain what had
just happened before my eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It is an infalliable truth, that it took almost precicely 2
weeks before I plucked up enough courage to inform my parent of this amazing
event.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Upon much deliberation, my mother concluded that the figure
I had seen was akin to a monk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
would make sense, considering the precise day, apparent look of the figure, and
direction in which it was heading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We found out that indeed, there was an old monastery in a
nearby location called "Grange."</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">From documented literature at the local library, we found
that the Monks were in fact tortured with workloads and often had a harsh,
painful existance.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I can only fathom that what I saw for about a precise 5
minutes was a pristine example of the "other side."<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It often puzzles me beyond conclusion, I wish I could find
an answer to this anomaly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The graphic image of the monk literally walking in a step
ratio 1 to 4 is beyond scientific explanation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have a naturally scientific/mathematical orientated mind and
therefore, find a lot of this information not only disturbing, but frankly,
completely and 100% totally unexplainable.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It may sound odd, but I often have never take on board
others stories or situations because I don't believe them or find that I can't
relate to what has been said.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">All I know is that what I saw is real for me, despite what
anyone else thinks.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I desperatly wish I could explain this in further
context.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I originally saw this at the
age of approximatly 8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am now 26 years
of age and it is still as ripe in my mind as when I originally witnessed this.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As with all, this information is supplied in a adult context
and hopefully is of some use to your cause.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I would like to share with you an expieriance I had after my
Mother passed away which got me interested in the paranormal,up until then I
saw everything in black and white in this subject.Before my Mother was buried i
placed a single red rose in her hands,a few days afterwards both my Father and
my Sister were telling me how they had seen my Mother and my Father in
particular was loseing sleep because she kept moving her crystals around on her
dressing table and the "tinkling" sound they made kept him awake.On
my way back home in the car I told my Husband how upset I was that my Mother
had visited both my Father and Sister and not me and that i wouldnt believe it
unless I saw her.Shortly after returning home,I was getting changed in my
bedroom,I was standing right in the middle of the room with nothing close to
me,I suddenly felt very light headed and giddy and (the only way i can describe
this)suddenly there was a clinking noise like metal hitting a wall and
something bounced off of me and landed on the floor,I bent down and picked the
odject up,and started to cry,for in my hand I saw a beautiful brass button in
the shape of a rose,I have no buttons like it,and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>have never to this day seen any buttons like
it,all I could say was "Thankyou Mum.since then I have joined a
Spiritualist Church and a Closed Circle,I have also become a Healer,and I think
this was my Mothers way of telling me to get my butt off the chair and get
working with spirit.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This is an old story that happened to our family, one
winter's night, in 1965, in the town of <st1:City><st1:place>Acton</st1:place></st1:City>,
MA. My mother, my sister and myself were sitting in the living room watching
TV. Outside, a fierce snow storm had already dumped a foot of snow and another
foot was still to follow. While we sat and watched TV we all heard two loud
raps on the back door. We wondered who could be out in this kind of weather
knocking at our door. Mom got up and we followed her to the back door. When she
opened the door all that was out there was wind driven snow and cold. There
were no footprints in the snow and we concluded that if thier were footprints
the falling snow could not yet have filled them in. We just sat back down to
continue watching TV when we heard, what we now assumed were knocks, two loud
thuds on the front door. The front door was much closer and the noise was laud
and distinct. We jumped up and quickly went to the front door and opened it to
find the same conditions we had just found at the back door. This time we had a
clear view of the street and there were no footprints anywhere. Just heavy wet
snow and wind. This time we investigated a little <st1:City><st1:place>furth</st1:place></st1:City>
by walking out on the porch for a better look. We thought maybe the neighbors
kids accross the street might have thrown snow balls at the door or house, but,
there were no impacts on the doors or walls of the house. The only movement
outside was the falling snow. We had only one explaination for this and it was
not at all saddening to us either. My oldest sister was taken from us in an
accident in the fall of the previous year. We all knew that it was her coming
home, to say hello, the only way she could.</p>

 <st1:PlaceType>Center</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> is a arcade and used to be a
grocery store. I worked at Buster's and weird things mostly happened to us in
the basement. Once we heard someone with loud shoes, like high heels walking
and when you talked to it it would stop for a while and then keep going. There
are circuit breakers in the basement and we switched them off at night to turn off
the games. A few times I would go down and as I got to the breakers, they were
already switched off, but yet the games were on when I went downstairs.
Upstairs some weird things happened also. When I would go to leave, I heard
hear loud knocking coming from the basement. Also once I went to leave and I
heard a loud smash as if something very heavy fell off of a shelf and smashed.
In the morning, everything would be fine.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">HELLO THE SHADOWLANDS!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have never been comfortable telling people about what
happen to me as a kid when I had my first and only OBE. When I was asked if I
ever had OBE I always tried to avoid it or just said no which was wrong to lie.
I felt weird talking about it. What changed my mind is seeing that other people
weren't afraid to talk about their OBE.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">On this day my Mom and I were up early to see my father off
to work as we always did. After that we went back into their bedroom and my Mom
fell asleep real fast. I remember I couldn't sleep so I got up to look out the
window for a while. Then I went back to the bed where my Mom was sleeping and
fell a sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember that I was
floating on the ceiling of the bedroom and screaming for help! Then I woke up
and fell right back to sleep and it happened again! It's like when you wake up
from a bad dream just to fall back to sleep real fast again. Then the third
time I had woken and went back to sleep nothing happen.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was just a kid I don't think I was older
enough for school yet. Now that I am grown so far nothing like that has ever
happened<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to me again.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Experience at the Swimming Pool</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: smankars@hotmail.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have been reading this site for past almost five years
now. Today I am going to share my experience with folks from the other world.
This incident happened in December 2003. My wife &amp; I were returning back
home late at night from a get-together. At that time were were staying in a
rental housing complex, at <st1:place><st1:City>Falls Church</st1:City>, <st1:State>Virginia</st1:State></st1:place>.
</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The parking lot in front of our house is right besides the
complex's swimming pool. One can see the pool from the parking lot. As I was
pulling into this parking lot around <st1:time minute="0" hour="2">2.00am</st1:time>
in the night.... in the path of our car's headlights, we saw a pair of female
legs running in the pool area. The water in the pool was disturbed as if
someone had entered in recently. I jokingly told my wife, that someone has
stole their way into the pool for a dip. She asked that how is it possible
for<span style="">&nbsp; </span>someone to enter the pool area when
the gates are locked &amp; furthermore she added that its around <st1:time minute="0" hour="2">2.00am</st1:time> ... on a cold, wintry &amp; chilly
December night.??!! </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This caught my attention. I got out of the car &amp; ran
towards the pool's gates which was about 50 feet away. We had seen the figure
run towards the same direction.But, there was no one there. I came back to my
wife who was getting out of the car now &amp; angry because I had left her
alone inside the car. We started walking home, thats when my wife said that all
she saw was just the pair of woman's legs that ran across the beam of my car's
headlights. That time it occurred to me that it was the same image I too had
seen. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">THERE WERE JUST A PAIR OF LEGS..... NO UPPER BODY OR A FACE.
</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">That scared the daylights out of us &amp; we started running
to our house. We came inside, closed the doors shut &amp; checked all windows
if they too were shut. After that we never saw nor felt anything till we stayed
there for another six months. But till date whenever we speak about that
experience, it sends shivers down our spines.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">well, where do i begin. we lived in east syracuse on taft
rd. in a 2 story house.my first experience is so vivid still and i was only
three at the time.i had a ghostly playmate named kathy with the red long
ringlet hair and starched white dress.my mom thought she was an<span style="">&nbsp; </span>amaginary friend .she said i would freak her
out by actually looking like i was actually holding hands with her and playing
with someone she could not see.she was always with me.i can remember holding
the covers up for her to get in bed with me.i have heard of these friends
before but never thought of kathy as one until i read some stories on your
site.now i'm freaked. lol.my dad died<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the year<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i was 6 and we went home
to be closer to family so we moved to winthrop.my mom bought a house that we
were fixing up with the help of her brothers. my uncle went down cellar to get
the paint and an old man in overalls was standing at the bottom of the steps
only to dissapear when he hollered ,HEY YOU!as we were to soon find out that
was only the beginning.we had things come up missing all the time only to be
found later in the silverware drawer or some odd crazy place like the nail
clippers in the fridge. at christmas she bought me a huge doll ,hid it in the
cellar and its never to be found in that house to this day.cowboys and indians
walking through a closed locked front door. someone grabbing her hand through a
solid pine headboard. arms coming through the walls to hold us while we slept.
ya right.eek.clothes missing from where we left them minutes before and
searching for hours to find them only to reappear right where we left them.my
bed coming 2 feet off the floor in the middle of the night to wake the whole
house with an earth shattering boom.by the way the ouji board was the only thing
under it besides the cellar stairs.i didnt sleep in that bed for weeks.well

<p class="MsoNormal">Lady in Wedding Dress</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: bonnier1966@fuse.net</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My experience happened when I was 4 yrs. old. We rented a
two story home and my dad worked swing shift so I often slept with my mom when
he was at work. One night while sleeping with my mom, I awoke. Her bedroom door
was opened and I could see the bathroom, hall, and my room across the hall. I
saw a women wearing a white wedding dress walk into my bedroom. I wasnt scared,
just confused. Being only 4 yrs old, I didnt know what ghosts/spirits were. I
was just wondering who was this lady in our house. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I awoke my mom and told her "mom, some lady just walked
into my bedroom". She told me to go back to sleep. I didnt though. I was
curious so got out of bed started to walk into my bedroom. It was so dark I was
afraid to walk into my room. I decided to walk downstairs. As I was heading
down the steps the lady appeared again, wearing a white wedding gown and
walking up the steps. I stopped, she stopped ( she was about 5-10 steps below
me) we both looked at each other. Her expression was just unconcerning. She
didnt look scary or evil but more surprised to see me but her expression didnt
really change. We stared at each other for a few moments then I stepped to one
side of the steps and she began to slowly walk up the stairs and right past me
into my room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I walked on downstairs and into the kitchen. This part gets
a little unclear of what I exactly saw. In the corner of the kitchen was a
small child about my age. She was stooped down and had something in her hand
like a baby bird. It seems she was doing something to the baby bird and looking
at me and kind of giggling. I just went back upstairs still confused. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I crawled back into bed with my mom and was still facing the
hall where I could see the bathroom. Then a voice called to me
"Bonnieeeeee, time to take a bath". Now I was scared. The bathroom
looked pitch dark and no way was I going to walk into there if someone was
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I rolled over so I didnt have to
see the hallway/bathroom but still had my eyes open and was facing a window. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Suddenly a ladder hit the window, someone opened the window
and a little girl and boy was crawling in through the window. I believe the boy
was wearing knickers and the girl a faded pink dress. I immediately closed my
eyes tight. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The next thing I remember I awoke and it was morning. I told
my parents about it as soon as I awoke in the morning. As far as I know, I
didnt have anymore sightings but it wasnt long after that we moved. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I never forgot that experience. It was very real. I still
think about it from time to time . Now that I am older I found out that my
parents had some weird happenings in that house too. No sightings but my mom
would hear footsteps on the stairs at night. My dad would be standing in the
bathroom mirror shaving and feel a real strong presence behind him, he'd turn
around and no-one would be there. There was also problems with the furnace. The
pilot light never seemed to want to stay lit. My dad called the landlord to ask
him to come over to the house to light it and the man said"oh no, I'm not
going back in that house again, I'll just tell you over the phone how to light it".
</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Not long after we moved out there was a fire at that house.
But I dont know any of the details or if the house was burnt down or just
damaged. My parents do believe me and my mom remembers me waking her up that
night and telling her I saw a lady. I dont know why I only saw children and a
lady in wedding dress or the history of the house. All I know is it happened 35
yrs ago &amp; I still remember it. Some people say I was just dreaming but I
know I wasnt. I was up walking around and those people I saw were real to me.
Just as if they were real human people, they were not faded or ghostly like you
see on TV but just as clear I see real people. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">That is my true story</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Occured sometime in 1970 in <st1:place><st1:City>Hamilton</st1:City>,

you could hear foot steps at night and if you slept there ,some one would sit
on your bed you could not see them but the bed would give weight . My parents
went on vacation and I was to turn the lights on the patio on at night and off
in the AM, I went by the house about 7:30 am and went into the house and walked
thru the living area and passed by the kitchen ,(I Felt the hair on my back
standing ) down the hall passed then bedrooms and into the Den where the light
switch was I turned it off and hurried bach thru the house to the front door. I
locked the door and got out. The feeling was still with me of someone in the
house. I was taking off and looked back the light was back on again,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for the rest of the time I unscrewed the
light bulb outside. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hello my name<span style="">&nbsp; </span>is
Laura, I live in <st1:State><st1:place>Florida</st1:place></st1:State>. I had
just recently got married five years ago, and my husband and I have two
children. My son was a baby and my daughter had to be about 4 or 5. Anyway we
were renting my grandmothers house. Everybody use to claim this house was
haunted, mind you I visited alot and had sleepovers when I was younger and
never experienced anything out of he norm. It was about three days after we
moved in and I was giving my daughter a bath. I was plucking my eye brows in
the mirror when my daughter says "mommy there are eyes in here waching me".
I said "what baby"? And as I turned to her there was this look of
terror on her face as she pointed and let out this horrible scream. She was
screaming "hes going to get me', Hes going to get me. Well this scared me,
and she was still screaming, so I started screaming, ran to her and dove out
the bath room with her, at this time my husband runs into the room swinging,
because he thinks there is someone in there tring to hurt us. Well we get her
out and try and calm her down ,but she was histerical mumblig ," hes going
to get me".. "The eyes mommy ,the eyes".We got her calmed down
finally, and as soon as I said nobody is coming for you honey, I am here. The
garbage knocked over and the loud noise from the garbage scared her and she
said see mommy the eyes are coming. Finally everything stoped<span style="">&nbsp; </span>after about an hour of rocking her and she
calmed down.Another incident that happened is that<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would hear a conversation going on, and I
would go to see what it was, to find my daughter talking to her friend
"Lisa" in the mirror. That was the little girls name, says my
daughter. Doors opened and closed by them self, showers would turn off and on.
I even had my cousin spend the night and I was telling her about it, and she
was being mean to them, and a screw driver flew off the fridge and hit her in
the stomach. She freaked out.I told her never prevoke a spirt. We since moved
about three months later.We have things happen still to this day. I think we
are just magnets to them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Grand Marais- on Christmas Eve about 5 years ago, I was at
my Grandma&#8217;s house and I was up stares with me Cousins &amp; Aunt and we were
talking about girl stuff, then the door slammed shut. I looked over at the door
there was something in it ,I leaned foreword and saw it was a glowing foot. I
jumped back. When we went down stairs to yell at the boys my mom said,&#8221; they
were down here the whole time.&#8221; So we went to yell at my uncle and he said, &#8220; I
was down here eating, and we thought you slammed the door.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>scary because I know
who the ghost is, and she&#8217;s not at all scary; Maybe a little ornery at times,
but not too scary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ghost is my
husband&#8217;s mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We live in the house
that belonged to her and my father-in-law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She battled cancer for months and died in 2000 in the home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I moved in, in 2003, I knew that she had
died at home under hospice care, but I didn&#8217;t know details.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never got to meet her except for once many
I have a ghost story to tell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s not
exactly years ago before I even met my husband.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When our son was born we spent many hours rocking in the recliner that
sits in the corner of our living room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is nothing behind this chair to catch a baby&#8217;s eye, just plain
white walls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the time my son was
old enough to interact with people by smiling, cooing etc&#8230; he would stare at
this corner behind me while we were rocking, and coo and laugh as if someone
were entertaining him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought nothing
of it since he was a very happy baby, but then he started reaching for someone
behind me, and pointing,<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I mentioned
this to my husband and he started paying attention to him doing it, and
nonchalantly said, something like &#8220;Hmm, that&#8217;s odd.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That corner is where my mom&#8217;s hospital bed
sat until she died. Maybe it&#8217;s her&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
didn&#8217;t scare me because I know she is just there to see her new
grandchild.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She makes herself known
every now and then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just a few weeks
ago, during the night I was sort of asleep, but woke suddenly and was on alert
because I thought I heard the baby make a noise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His room is right across the hall from ours
and the way the rooms are set up I can see into his room and his bed if I raise
my head and look over my husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
particular night I sat up and looked across the hall into his room and saw a
woman with a scarf on her head in a sweat suit leaning over the baby bed just
looking at him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About the time it
registered and I gasped, she was gone. I was awake, and I know what I saw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was hazy, and I could vaguely see the
night light behind/through her. I got up and checked on the baby, who was
sleeping peacefully. I woke my husband and told him what I saw and he told me
it was ok, and for me to go back to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Somehow I did. The next morning he explained to me that in the last few
months of his mom&#8217;s life she pretty much lived in sweats for comfort, but she
always wore a colorful scarf on her head because she had lost her hair during
chemo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So now I had seen her too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A couple of weeks after this incident, my
husband was sick.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is very &#8220;needy&#8221;
when he is sick.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I myself had just had
some minor surgery that resulted in a major infection that I was finally
starting to recover from, and I was a bit cranky and felt like he was just
being a big baby, and I told him as much on about the second day of his
illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His father told me that his
mother used to baby him horribly especially when he was sick, and that is why
he needed so much attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I made some
comment to him like &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not his mother and I refuse to baby him&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess that irritated his mom&#8217;s spirit a bit
because that night when I went to lay in our bed beside my husband I could not
get comfortable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seemed like there
was no room in our bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I kept tossing
and turning, getting hot then cold, and my muscles felt like they had an
electric current running through them, and I couldn&#8217;t lay still.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was miserable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally I got up and went to lie on the bed
in the baby&#8217;s room to see if I could get comfortable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a little better in there, but I felt
like someone kept coming to the door and glaring at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I got up and went into the living room and
lay on the couch to sleep and I was just fine.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I fell asleep and slept the whole night there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next morning my husband said he had the
weirdest dream that his mom was taking care of him while he was sick and she
made me leave the room!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think she was
aggravated with me for not taking care of him the way she would have.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My 15 year old son has also seen her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Out of the blue one day he said, &#8220;<st1:PersonName>Mom</st1:PersonName>,
you know we have a ghost here don&#8217;t you?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I just said &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s Marty&#8217;s mom, she is harmless.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said &#8220;I know, I just see her out of the
corner of my eye while I&#8217;m watching TV.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She walks from the bathroom to the kitchen then disappears.&#8221; </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have had scary encounters before in other places that left
me afraid to be alone in certain places, but I&#8217;m not at all frightened by our
ghost here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know she is just here to
look out for us.</p>
