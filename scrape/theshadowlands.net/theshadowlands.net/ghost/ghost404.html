Looking Through Wavy Glass<br>
<br>
<br>
By: midwestmusic@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
Where do I begin, which story do I tell first, there are so many that
we have learned to deal with over the years, swept under the rug, never
to bring up again. I will start with the most recent. While caring for
my grandchildren, changing a diaper, dashing from one room to the
other, I saw a full figure of a man, he was leaning against the wall in
a relaxed stance, startled as was I he quickly disappeared, I was
stunned because I didn't think this would happen. Let me back up a bit,
the man I saw was my beloved Father in law, departed a year before.
Where he was standing was his natural place to watch The Young and
Restless soap opera we watched together for years. The reason I didn't
think I would ever see him this way is because the night he passed away
in my house was the most restful sleep and the most peaceful night I
had ever spent in this house, I say it was a gift from him. He loved
the grandchildren and I thought they may have been experiencing some
type of visit from him from their actions but shrugged it off. He was
the most loving person I have ever known and would not frighten anyone.
I was at ease with the sighting but had to take a moment for it's
abruptness. it was like looking through wavy glass or under water. This
is the least scary, but true story I have to tell.<br>

The Jolly Drunk On Carson Street - Steubenville, Ohio<br>
<br>
By:JediXkid9@webtv.net <br>
<br>
Note: I'm changing the names to keep privacy and the street name,
because it's private property and the second house is now inhabitated
by my other Uncle again well as the one where my other Uncle died.<br>
I have a few strange stories in the city of Steubenville Ohio,&nbsp;
these stories pertain to a house that my Uncle Bill lived in with his
wife Jeanne. <br>
My uncle Bill was a heavy alcohol drinker, he drank with his brothers
and buddies on many occassions, he lived in the house across the street
from his brother Dale at the time of his death.<br>
No one was ever sure what happened to Bill, they chalked it up to too
much alcohol, he was found upstairs between the first room when you hit
the top and the bathroom, bleeding out the back of his head in a pool
of blood and a alcohol bottle near him. <br>
Many of our family members have speculated that his wife killed him,
thinking he may have been verbally or psychically abusive toward her
(No one ever noticed anything though),&nbsp; no real autopsy was done
to show why he was bleeding the way he was, they ended up saying he
mixed it with pills but it just seems so unlikely that he'd commit
suicide with the kind of man he was, jolly, amusing and just a good ol
drunk. Always had something funny to say or do.<br>
My cousin Dale Jr. was very close to his Uncle Bill, and apparently
after the funeral when he was younger, Uncle Bill came upstairs to his
room solid and plain as day telling Little Dale that everything was
alright and he shouldn't be sad, mind you they lived right across the
street from one another. My uncle Dale and his wife Dina also reported
seeing Uncle Bill standing over their bed, but it seemed like he only
stopped by to check on them as he had Dale Jr. they said he said that
everything would be alright, watch over little Dale. (If you're
thinking what I thought, Yeah I thought It was their grief playing
tricks on them but I changed my mind a few years later.)<br>
After that, Bill's brothers' house also had a very strange feeling
about it...especially after the Dale and his wife moved to another
residence and my family moved in there, my little brother, sister and I
hated our mother's room and hardly ever went in there, there felt like
there was a dark presence there, we've also noted noises running up and
down the stairs sometimes; my sister is a listener of Rap, and Bill
never liked that crap, she's noted along with my cousin Paula in the
past that anytime it's on, the stereos change to any country station it
can find out of the blue. Anytime I would play country or rock music,
the volume would turn up.<br>
Now the more freakier thing is, my Uncle Bill's old house just across the street.<br>
Since his death, there have been at least sixteen families that have
moved inside there and never stayed, ever. It is the most moved in and
out of house in the uptown area. People have reported a stain of blood
in the corner of the living just above the spot where he died, and alot
of these people had no idea that anyone died there at all, they have
seen a heavyset man roaming the hallways and have reported the strong
smell of jack daniels through out the house, well as having things gone
missing only to return to them very obviously in places they can find
them. I doubt my uncle would be a maleviolent spirit by any means and
it would seem like him to play pranks on others.<br>
I got to stay in the house one night, because I befriended a girl named
Mary who ended up living there with her mother, I only got to note that
the upstairs at night got really cold even though it was hot and humid
outside in the summer, I also seen the bloodstain in the corner where
they had just recently not only moved in but painted over, several
times. <br>
I also noted when I lived across the street, figures in the upstairs
windows when no one would be home or just staring out at me with a
alcohol bottle in their hand, I never felt scared for some reason; it
was just like someone was checking to see who I was, watching over me.<br>
But since then, three other families have moved into his house and my
Uncle right back across the street. Haven't asked him if anything
strange still goes on there, and people really can't seem to keep
rooted to my Uncle's old house ever.<br>

Hudson Hills Manor<br>
<br>

<br>
This is in reference to your story about the ghost of a little
girl,tuning on televisions, opening cabinets, and talking to the kids.
Myself and my 3 children lived there on the second street from&nbsp;
9/2/97-7/1/01, my son was almost 2 when we moved in, and was 5 when we
left.It all srarted when I would here him talking in the middle of the
night, and when I would ask him who are you talking to ? He would tell
me the little girl , I always thought he had an over active
imagination, boy was I wrong.His toys would end up all over his room in
the middle of the night, and he said it was her[Ashley]she was a blonde
haired little girl about 8 or 9 years old she would tell him her daddy
was mean to her.On another occasion my sister was about16 she would
spend the night at our apartment and always slept by my son,well she
woke up because she heard talking and thought it was my son, when she
looked over at him he was sound asleep so she rolled over and standing
right next to the bed was a little girl, she had a black eye.as time
went by things started to progress, my boyfriends brother was taking a
nap in my sons room and he saw her to.I would wake up to every
television in the house on in the middle of the night and the cabinets
opening and closing it was crazy.I woke up one time to a bunch of noise
and my boyfriend [Josh]&nbsp; and myself ran to his room and could not
get in, he pushed the door as hard as he could and it opened the
dresser was in front of the door, there is no way my son could have
moved it, he told us ashley got mad at him because he wouldn't do what
she wanted him to do.There's little things that would happen here and
there, but the worst was when I heard pounding on the floor upstairs
and i ran up there and Josh was laying on the floor with the kids
watching tv and he said all of a sudden he couldn't move, couldn'
scream, it was like something jumped in him and paralyzed him well I
made fun of him,he use to take alot of pills so I was like go eat some
more pills, I didn't believe him,well I wish I would have! A couple of
weeks later was going to sleep and sure enough I felt something come in
the room it got darker and all of a sudden I couldn't move it was
almost like electricity going through my body, I could feel the hair on
my arms stand up, I tried to scream and I couldn't ot was so scary, it
happened a couple times.One time I actually saw a mans figure, it was a
glassy blob, I always felt that there were 2 of them the little girl
wasn't bad but whatever came into my room was bad, maybe it was the
dad.There was a guy I think his name was mark, he was sitting on the
couch i had just met him and out of the blue he asked me if i saw her,
I said what are you talking about, he said the little girl he had lived
there as a child with his mother and sister and he saw her back then
come down the stairs and walk right through the wall,after we moved the
girl behind me said at night she saw someone standing in the window
every night and the apartment was empty, I just thought i should write
and tell you about this alot of people joke and don't believe it , so I
was so glad to find what you had posted about it, thank you. You can
write back if you want
to.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Previous Owner<br>
<br>
By: Zachmelj@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
The previous owner of my house committed suicide about 2 years prior to our purchasing the house. <br>
When my husband and i met with the owner's daughter regarding the
purchase of the house she told us that her father was standing behind
us and had shook his head yes that we were the people he wanted in the
house.&nbsp; <br>
At first, my husband and I thought she was a little bonkers.&nbsp;
However, we started to notice certain things in the house.&nbsp; Our
alarm would go off for no reason.&nbsp; Little brick--a-brack i have in
the kitchen would start swinging back and forth. Our hall light would
go off. Not just the light bulb, the switch would be turned to the off
position.<br>
One morning my husband woke up and went to open the front door to find
it already opened as far as it could be with the chain on it.&nbsp; I
woke up one morning to find the blinds on the sliding glass doors half
way open.&nbsp; when i mentioned it to my husband, he informed me that
he was not in the den that morning as he was running late for work and
basically got dressed and ran out the door.<br>
We have seen the black outline of a man walking past the windows.&nbsp; <br>
Since then, I ocassionally seen the spirit of my dog in the house.&nbsp; We also have several orbs located around the house.<br>
However,none of them are violent or nasty beings.&nbsp; In many ways
they are protective of my husband, myself and my other two dogs.<br>

Spirit<br>
<br>
By: dcalhoun3@stny.rr.com<br>
<br>
We lived in a house for 32 years that we had a local contractor
build.&nbsp; Raised 2 children and assortment of cats and dogs.&nbsp;
From the first few nights we were in the house we experienced many
times ghostly activity.&nbsp; I have documented most of it.&nbsp; It
began with a lot of racket in the middle of the night waking myself and
our then 5 year old son up.&nbsp; My husband said it was the new house
"settling"&nbsp; One night it was louder than usual and woke him
up.&nbsp; He sat up and hollered "what the heck is going
on?"&nbsp;&nbsp; I said nothing, just the house settling.&nbsp; I went
to the area it seemed to be coming from and had a frank discussion with
the spirit.&nbsp; I told it we were not going to leave and that he/she
( I felt it was a he) needed to stop the noise so we could
sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp; Guess what, the noise stopped right then.&nbsp; But
the haunting began during the day.&nbsp; Over the years we heard him, I
saw him, my daughter and I saw a halo type of light where his head
would be on 2 occasions, our dog reacted to him but not the cats, I
bumped into him, I felt his fear and unbelievable loneliness and I knew
he did not stay in the house but came in and out as he wished.&nbsp; <br>
Once I asked my daughter why she never seemed to have bad dreams and
call me during the night.&nbsp; She said she did have bad dreams but
the nice man would come and sit on her bed and tell her it was okay so
she didn't have to call me.&nbsp; After she left for college the
haunting stopped.&nbsp; I asked the ghost if he was still there to let
me know and a large art piece came crashing off the wall.&nbsp; So I
assumed he was still there.&nbsp; I have a lot of detailed stories to
tell about him but I don't know where to start.&nbsp; He would turn the
TV on sometimes at night and he would turn on a music box that played
Stardust.&nbsp; He would swipe articles and maybe a year or lots&nbsp;
later return them.&nbsp; Our family thought of him as part of our lives
although we seldom spoke to anyone about it.&nbsp; If the subject came
up we would.&nbsp; Anyway my mom said I should pray for his soul and I
did.&nbsp; The last few years we lived there I believe he was
gone.&nbsp; All in all it was a rewarding experience that reinforced
our faith in the afterlife.<br>

Another Baby Story<br>
<br>
By: snag16@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
when i read the title "the baby" it sparked my memory back to what my mother told me when i was younger.<br>
i remember her telling me a story about her aunt,&nbsp; before my mom
was even born, this story was passed down from my great grandparents.
and now on to me as well.<br>
i remember that mom was telling me how her grandmother had had a child
and it died upon bitrh. This not being sad enough my mother and her
sisters and brothers used to play around the clothes line.. but only
one side, one day my great grandmother asked them why this was so and
they looked at her as if to give the matter of fact expression and said
simply, "because when we play around the other side we wake the baby up
and it cries the whole time we play." and then they left for home. My
mother came to find out later on in life that her aunt/ my great aunt
was burried under the tree that the clothes line was connected to.<br>

The Girl<br>
<br>
By: mm1143ws@bellsouth.net<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I was a sceptic when it came to the paranormal,I thought that people
were crazy,and that they needed to be locked up, but that all changed
when I had a visit from a little girl.My grandparents were getting old
in age and my mother wanted to be closer to them, so when the old
homeplace came up for sale, they jumped at the chance and bought it.I
never liked the house,and I wasn,t happy when we moved.It was a
old,farmhouse, that had been built back in the late eighteen
hundreds,and it was in terrible shape.The rooms were huge and drafty
and there wasn,t a whole lot of light but I couldn,t change the
situation so I decided to keep my opinions to myself. My bedroom was
located on the third floor of the house,that overlooked the tobacco
fields.In my bedroom ,there was a small,closet door that had been
nailed shut.I asked my parents if I could open it ,and they said that
they didn,t mind,so I opened it.What I found was facinating. There were
old , medicine bottles, ancient, quilts and small childrens clothes,
cloth nightgowns to be exact.I took the things that I had found to my
grandmothers house across the field,so proud of what I had found.My
grandmother was furious when she saw the treasures that I had
discovered.She told me that I shouldn,t have touched them, and to put
them back where I had found them,so I did but I didn,t nail the door
back together.That Winter, the weather was so cold and relentless, that
I thought that I would freeze to death.We bundled up in blankets and
drank cups of Hot Chocolate to keep warm.It was on a frigid ,December
night that I saw the little girl.I was sleeping and suddenly I woke
up.The room was freezing cold, but at the same time warm, if that makes
sense, but that is the only way that&nbsp; I can describe it.I looked
over toward the staircase and I saw her,a small girl, she looked to be
about five or six years old.She had long ,blond,hair parted in the
middle,she wore a white nightgown,and in her arm,she held a teddy
bear.The girl appeared to be very curious and stared at me.I was so
scared,and I tried to scream but I couldn,t,it was as if she held me
spell bound and I couldn,t function.Her body was blurry but I could see
her clearly.I threw the blanket back over my head and prayed that she
would be gone when I looked again.I waited a few minutes,and then I
dared to look again,she was gone.I told no body of this
encounter,thinking that they would think that I was insane,but mama
finally asked me why that I was sleeping in the guest room and not my
own room,so I told her.She told me that it was just a bad dream and
that there was no such thing as ghost,so I gathered my courage and went
back to my room.Two weeks later, on Christmas Eve night,we were eating
dinner at my great-grandmothers house, and mama told everybody about my
so called dream,I was mortified and so embarrased that I left the
table.My great-grand mother came and found me and told me that she had
something to tell me.She told me that the little girl wasn,t a dream
,that she had appeared,and that the reason that she knew it was because
the same girl had appeared to her when she lived in the farm house as a
teenager.She said that the girl appeared to her&nbsp; while she was
doing her sewing in the parlour,and that it had scared her so bad that
she had ran out of the house and wouldn,t go back in until her father
came home.She told her father what she had seen and he told her that
she had been visited by Anna-Belle.He explained to her that around the
turn of the century , the farm house had once been an old,Tobacco barn
and that his grandfather had converted it into a house.It was a autumn
afternoon that Anna-Belle was walking home from school and was taken by
a man, who killed her and left her in a shack by the road,he said that
she had been haunting the homeplace ever since.I have recently found
out that I and my great-grandmother are not the only ones that have
seen her.Some people say that they see her skipping down the
old,dirt,road as the twilight comes and that she dissappears into the
trees.I was once a sceptic but I,m not any more.<br>

Valley Oaks Elementary School<br>
<br>
By: selena_lewis@qbsol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I too, went to Valley Oaks Elm School back in 1982. Mr. Byrd was the
principal then. This school is indeed haunted!&nbsp; A group of my
friends and I were in the third grade girls restroom playing around,
when one of my friends decided to call Bloody Mary.&nbsp; Being that I
was sensitive to seeing ghost, I stood by the door and refused to
participate.&nbsp; As the girls continue to call Bloody Mary the lights
went out and all four toilets began to flush repeatedly.&nbsp; We all
screamed and the girls came running my way to get out the door. The
door would not give, not even with the weight of six girls pushing on
it.&nbsp; A nearby teacher heard our screams and ran to open the
door.&nbsp; Mrs. Weins swore that the door was not locked, but we knew
better! <br>
I have also noticed the merry-go-round spin around a half turn and
coming to a stop on its own.&nbsp; There is also a presence of an older
person in the cafeteria on stage.<br>
I was in a forth grade pioneer play when I felt a cold spot on the back
of my neck.&nbsp; I was afraid to move until another student bumped
into me.<br>
I&#8217;ve moved out of the area to make sure that my daughter never goes to that school.<br>
I&#8217;m glad that I&#8217;m not the only person to experience this phenomenal. <br>
I will write back soon.&nbsp; I have so many true life stories to tell.&nbsp; They can all be research and proven true. <br>
I&#8217;ve seen ghost my whole life and have had them try to communicate with me.<br>
What can I say? They like me. I&#8217;m an open doorway!<br>

St Thomas Church in Thomaston, Ct.<br>
<br>
By: puck5801@bellsouth.net <br>
<br>
Hello. My name is Laura Grenier. I was messing around looking at
differant web-sites during Halloween and stumbled upon your site. I was
born and raised in Thomaston, CT. I now live in Tennessee with my
husband and daughter. Of course everyone in Thomaston has known about
the Opera House hauntings.&nbsp; I was amased to see that the St.
Thomas church and school was on the hauntings list. However, I am not
surprised. My older sister and I both attended St. Thomas school back
in the 1970's. I distinctly remember going to services and functions at
St. Thomas Church very often. As a child I can remember the basement of
the church. Even at 5 years of age it was a place that felt erie. There
were instances in the basement that went unexplained. One instance I
can remember is the presence of water in the old basement kitchen.
Church workers would always talk about the "kitchen creek". There were
no busted pipes or leaky faucets. However, once in a while there would
be a pool of water on the floor with no explaination where it came
from. I can remember my mother, whom was an active church member of St.
Thomas, not allowing my sister or I in the basement. She would often
discuss with my father how lights would go off by themselves leaving
the basement in complete darkness (there were no windows in the
basement only floresent lighting). We all knew there was something or
someone in the church itself but we never discussed it (catholics
seldom do).<br>
It was not until I came upon your site that I asked my sister and
parents about what happen in the basement. My sister, who now resides
in St. Augustine FL., remembered about as much as I did. A feeling of
"you are not alone" or being followed. My sister recalled seeing lights
turn off and energy lights (orbs) in the room before someone flipped
the light switch. My mom did recall the water in the kitchen and others
telling how they would be in the basement and things would happen or be
seen. A strong sense of being followed was also an erie feeling. <br>
My mother distinctly remembered the basement doors being locked or
locking all the time when you were the only one there. There were two
ways into the basement. One through the main church and the other was a
side door on the east side of the church. My mother recalled her last
instance with the church. She advised she was working in the basement,
bringing in food for the sunday brunch after church. She advised every
time she went back to the car to get more stuff the basement door would
be locked when she returned. She advised this happen several times. The
last time being when she dropped off the last load at the front table
in the basement, turned back around, and the door was locked from the
inside again. My sister and I attended St Thomas school from approx
1973 till 1982. I have never heard of any "stories" of whom or why this
haunting is happening. But it definately exists. <br>
I thought this would be an interesting story for you. Most of
Thomaston's buildings were built on cemetary's were the bodies have
been moved to the old part of Hill Cemetary. Perhaps this explains some
of the activity in the town. <br>

The Records of a Family Forgotten<br>
<br>
By: havlatka@chartermi.net<br>
<br>
Many years ago my sisters and I were in a small deserted house in Acme,
Michigan.&nbsp; We loved old items and since this old place was open
and with no signs warning about entering it, we decided to take a look
to see what we could find.<br>
One of my sisters discovered a large wooden trunk buried in the floor
in a small room in front of the house. The house had only a sand or
dirt floor. <br>
Considering ourselves lucky for this great find we took all we could
out of the trunk and went back to the cottages we were renting on a
nearby lake.. <br>
It took us a long time as we spent the rest of our vacation reading
letters, checking out facts, etc. and we were able to make up a family
tree complete with pictures and living locations.<br>
The letters read very interesting, taking us completely back to the late <br>
1800s and early 1900s.&nbsp;&nbsp; We read about Christmas trees being cut and <br>
decorated, fishing for dinner, love affairs and even asking advice for <br>
committing suicide.&nbsp;&nbsp; The family we discovered and read about was a brother <br>
and two sisters.&nbsp; The brother never married and moved to Chicago where he <br>
was a member of the Chicago Tribune (I think) Typesetters union.&nbsp;&nbsp; From the <br>
letter discribing his pains and growing weakness, we came to the conclusion <br>
that he died of cancer.&nbsp;&nbsp; He lived in a rooming house and his landlady kept <br>
the sisters informed.&nbsp; . The two girls both married and had many
children between them.&nbsp; All but one died in very early age of
comsumption or something like that, never heard of today.<br>
The one surviving child went to school and eventually became a teacher in <br>
Acme.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was the last to live in the house.&nbsp; Don't know if she married, <br>
but if she did it was quite late in life and she had no children..<br>
The cemetery where the family was buried is still standing and sit next
to the Grand Traverse Resort.&nbsp; The house was burned down and was
gone the next <br>
year when we went up for our vacation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A golf course took it's place.<br>
Now for the lasting effects this discovery had on our lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After <br>
bringing this treasure home and keeping&nbsp; it stored in my home, my children <br>
started seeing figures at night.&nbsp;&nbsp; We heard footsteps without seeing <br>
anybody.&nbsp; My neighbors quit visiting us because of the things they heard and <br>
my girls had no more sleepovers because nobody would come.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their friends <br>
would go home in the middle of the night because of this apparition making it's appearances.<br>
My husband and I moved twice more and naturally the stuff and spirits came with us.<br>
Three of our daughters came home to visit without their husbands and <br>
children this last summer in July.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently their being here aggravated <br>
this ghost because he did all he could to upset them and their time here. <br>
My girls live from coast to coast and see one another only on special <br>
occasions like this one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cameras wouldn't work, so no pictures to look <br>
back on.&nbsp;&nbsp; The last night here they spent the night cuddled together on the <br>
front room sofa, nobody could sleep.&nbsp; They definitely could feel this presence in the room and the house.<br>
After this I decided to donate the boxes of stuff to a Traverse City museum <br>
and even called them to make sure they wanted it.&nbsp;&nbsp; They did.&nbsp; .But days <br>
before getting if out of my home, another daughter living in California
and unable to be here in July called me and asked if she could have the
letters, pictures, etc..&nbsp; I tried to talk her out of it but ended
up mailing all of <br>
it to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her purpose was to write a book about this family, the time <br>
and the location in Michigan's northern lower peninsula.<br>
We haven't talked about it, but I hope she accomplishes her mission.&nbsp;&nbsp; I <br>
always felt it would be a shame to put this very interesting family's
story in a museum to get dusty sitting on a shelf and forgotten about.<br>
We are still visited by someone. Two times lately I've seen the complete <br>
man, and with the clothes he wears, he comes from that era.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was <br>
aggravated the last time he came and shook his fists at me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I admit I was <br>
scared and decided then that this was more then I wanted to deal with. <br>
Hence I got rid of the boxes.&nbsp;&nbsp; One time while reading in the den late at <br>
night I saw only his legs walking across the floor going to the computer <br>
room.&nbsp;&nbsp; I spend time in my computer room at night and feel his presence <br>
around me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Seems I can be catching up with email and all of a sudden feel <br>
someone behind me.&nbsp; Very loud noises make my husband and I jump while watching tv in the evening.<br>
I have since found a little book of Tennyson's poetry that belonged to
one of the family, was put in my library and forgotten..&nbsp; This
precious book has babies names, their deaths, pieces of clothing,
pieces of hair, newspaper <br>
obits, inside the jacket of the book.&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to keep this book as it is <br>
beautiful to me.<br>
This is my story spanning a good 35 to 40 years.&nbsp; All of it true.<br>
Surprising enough I feel honored to have shared a small portion of their lives.<br>

Old Farm House<br>
<br>

<br>
Hi. My name is Robin and when I was about 9 I lived in a house in
Ottsville, Pa. I had many things happen there and on two occasions saw
two different ghosts. First let me tell you the history of the house
and the layout so you can kind of get a picture. Im not really sure of
the year the house was built the year is engraved in the house but I
just can't remember I think it was like 1400 or something. At one time
the house was a hospital and there was a second addition to the house
so the main house was where the doctors slept and the other part was
where the sick ppl where. In time they knocked down back half of the
house so just the main house stood and later it became a school the
teachers stayed in which is now the bedrooms and the teachers taught in
what is now the attic. So now you know a little of the history so let
me tell you a little of the layout then I will get to the good stuff
lol. When you walk in right in front are the stairs to the left was a
dining room to the right was a living room and it went in a circle so
next to the living room was a sitting room then you went to the kitchen
and it connected to the dining room next to the kitchen was a door that
led to the cellar which was cold and made of cement it also had a door
down there which was wine cellar. Upstairs there was a huge open
hallway to the left was my parents bedroom which has a sitting area and
a full bathroom connected to it. To the right of the stair and up one
step was a full bath room to the right of the bathroom was my brothers
room and down another long hallway was a room I shared with my sister
and next to my room was the door to the attic. Now our attic was huge
you could ride a bike up there in the attic was a door it was the door
that connected the hospital to the house it was only wide enough that
one person could walk though unless you went in sideways. Ok now for
the good part. I don't remember really when it started little things
happened first like my mom would put things down and come back for them
and they wouldn't be there she would look all over and she would check
the same spot and they would be there. Sometimes the tv or lights would
turn on and off. My mom never told me any of this stuff untill one day
when I was older and told her that the house was haunted so I know it
wasn&#8217;t just my imagination. My mom told me that when she was in her
bedroom she felt as if she was being watched and when she was in the
sitting area she got this intence feeling that someone was in the room
with her and she would just leave. At night I would hear ppl walking
back and forth in the attic. Then one night I was in bed sound a sleep
when I just woke up and at the end of my bed there was this women at
first I thought it was my mom. She was wearing this white gown it kind
of looked like a nightgown I couldt really make out any facial features
but her hair was dark and short a wavy. Like I said I thought it was my
mom so I said "MOM" weird thing I just layed back down and went to
sleep. The next morning I asked my mom if she was in my room and she
said no. That was the only time I saw her I also saw a little boy
around the age of 6 or 7 in the attic window. I was playing hide and
seek outside in the corn field with my brother and sister and our rule
was you couldn't leave the field to hide. So I was the one seeking and
for some reason I looked up and saw this boy sitting in the window of
the attic I thought it was my brother cause I couldn't make out the
features due to him being so high up and far away. So I ran in the
house and up there stairs and in the attic yelling your not supposed to
be up here that&#8217;s cheating but when I reached the top of the stairs no
one was there I searched the whole attic still thinking it was my
brother. I Looked out the window and saw my brother in the corn field
there was no way he could have left the attic with out me seeing him or
passing him along the way. One more thing then I will go cause this is
getting kind of long in the attic the passage I told you about early
well one day my mom sent me and my brother up to go get some papers she
had her own buissness and used it to store files. My brother and I were
in the back when all of a sudden the door slammed closed and we heard
giggling like a little kid we were screaming cause the door wouldn&#8217;t
open the I heard my mom running up the stairs and the door just popped
open. That was the only scary thing that happened I think that it was
prob the little boy just having fun. So that&#8217;s my story the house is
still standing by the way I wonder if the other owners had anythiing
happen.<br>

Polite Ghost / Cody<br>
<br>
By: torino1975@comcast.net <br>
<br>
I have sent in 2 things that have happened to me, and it depends on the
day if I am not scared or amused by whatever it is or whomever it is
trying to get my attention.&nbsp; This one little remembrance makes me
smile sort of&#8230;and it happened in 1997-98.&nbsp; My parents, my brother
and his then wife, my husband, and my 3 children all went out to eat at
this really nice place (not too fancy or pricey) place in my little
home town.&nbsp; We did not get seated in the &#8220;nice dining room&#8221; and
were sitting in the &#8220;lunch area&#8221; near the salad bar.&nbsp; Everyone had
gotten up to get their salads and that left me, my mum, and my 3
children still at the table (my mum and I would assist my children
after the others were seated).&nbsp; Well, I am sitting there and
holding a good conversation with my mum (she was sort of facing me to
my right, our table was round) and suddenly I felt this warm, firm
pressure on my back as if someone was trying to get by.&nbsp; I
immediately scooted forward, leaned in and said, &#8220;Excuse me&#8221; and my mum
goes, &#8220;Pardon?&#8221;&nbsp; I looked and there was no one there! I looked
back to see where this &#8220;person&#8221; had come from and there were no tables
or booths behind us, just windows overlooking the river.&nbsp; I got
&#8220;that feeling&#8221; again and shivered and said, &#8220;Someone just put their
hand on the middle of my back and gently pushed forward as if to go
by.&#8221;&nbsp; My mum only smiled and said, &#8220;Polite ol&#8217; thing, huh?&#8221;&nbsp; <br>
I&#8217;ll never forget that.&nbsp; The hand felt so real&nbsp; and&nbsp;
warm.&nbsp; I did not have that &#8220;dreaded&#8221; feeling with this
&#8220;occurrence&#8221; like I had with the others I have shared in the past on
this forum.<br>
One other thing&#8230;the house we lived in when we moved to this state in
1992 had this family that lived next door to us on the corner.&nbsp;
The first day we were moving in, their beautiful Cocker Spaniel was
sitting in our driveway.&nbsp; The houses were so close together that
we could stand in our driveway and talk to our neighbors while they
stood on their front porch.&nbsp; Anyway&#8230;my son bent down to pet the
dog and as he withdrew his hand, the dog jumped up at him, snarling and
trying to bite him.&nbsp; He screamed and I ran to him and the owners
came running out of the house.&nbsp; (It was early Sept. and still warm
to have windows/doors open). They had heard my son scream and they
said, &#8216;We&#8217;re so sorry, but he is so persnickety&#8230;he&#8217;ll let you pet him
but for some reason when you take your hand away is when he tries to
attack.&#8221;&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t too happy to learn this and instructed my 3
children to not touch that dog for any reason.&nbsp; To make matters
worse, we all noticed that dang dog chose the pole near my driveway
(our fence was 1 &frac12; feet on my neighbor&#8217;s property so in all
actuality he was still on his property) to sit and stare at us when we
came home.&nbsp; We&#8217;d have to park our vehicle and then cut across the
front yard instead of walking up near the fence to get in the house and
of course the driver would have to get out and walk to the left rear
and cut across to get in the house so not to disturb or tick off the
dang dog.&nbsp; I ran a home daycare back then and the parents would
always complain about that dog and the owners would try to keep it up,
but for some reason or another it was always out.&nbsp; As long as you
didn&#8217;t try to pet it, you were fine, the dog wouldn&#8217;t bother you, but I
still didn&#8217;t trust it.<br>
A year before we move to where we are now (2002) I came home late from
class one night and that dog was sitting near the GATE.&nbsp; I was
like, &#8220;You&#8217;re getting awful ballsy moving more on my property and
closer to my front porch Cody.&#8221;&nbsp; So I had to quickly get out of
the car, go to the driver&#8217;s rear, scoot across the driveway and part of
my front yard and then up onto my front porch and into the house.&nbsp;
I told my husband that Cody was almost to the porch (we had two ways to
get on the porch, one step from the driveway and 2 steps from the front
walk) and he got angry and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m putting a stop to this.&nbsp;
We&#8217;ve put up with that dog for too long and now it is just getting
closer and closer.&#8221;&nbsp; The next day I saw Barbie outside (a lady in
her late 50&#8217;s, real cool &amp; nice) and I explained to her that her
dog was now encroaching himself closer to our front door to where we
were all uneasy.&nbsp; She looked at me and said, &#8220;We had Cody put down
last weekend because he was eaten up with cancer.&#8221;&nbsp; I got angry
and said, &#8220;I saw Cody right here&#8230;.&#8221; I stomped over to the spot and
said, &#8220;He was right here looking at me!&nbsp; My headlights picked up
his eyeballs (how a dog&#8217;s eyes will glow white in headlights) when I
pulled in the driveway!&#8221;&nbsp; She shook her head (I told you she was a
sweetie) and said, &#8220;Come here&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp; I walked to her back yard, behind
their red shed (which was even with my dog kennels in my yard) and
there was a fresh mound of dirt with a little marker that said
&#8220;Cody.&#8221;&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t see it from my yard due to the fig tree
between the grave and my fence. She smiled and said, &#8220;I told Jimmy I
saw Cody sitting out by the pool and again near the bus stop waiting
for the crossing guard but he said I was insane.&nbsp; I have seen Cody
in the mud room, looking at me, too.&#8221;&nbsp; I kindly smiled and walked
away knowing darn well I saw A LIVE Cody sitting by my gate the night
before. I guess I just chalk that up to one of those things like
&#8220;oh-oh, another one to file away in my &#8220;unexplained&#8221; file in my memory.<br>

Ramsey's House <br>
<br>
By: lorrieyork@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
I lived in a farm house while growing up, and again as an adult. Alot
of doors opening, noises, water running by itself, music playing and
enity's sitting on the bed with you.&nbsp; It was frightening. There
was someone stomping up and down the basement stairs and wiggling the
doorknob so loud one night, we has the police come out to find nothing.
My mother stood at the basement door with a gun until they arrived.The
house is owned by Ramsey's. Big farmers of most of the land in
Milligan. I moved back into the house as an adult. Not before blessing
the perimeter of the yard and every threshold. It was more peaceful
then but I could feel ghosts there still.&nbsp; My research revealed a
woman committed suicide in the house and a farmhand had hung himself in
the barn 100 years ago. The barn burned down when I lived there as an
adult. I have taken people out there over the years who didn't believe
until they visited. The house was empty alot. The last time I was
there, I figured no one would ever live there again with the condition
of the place. As I drive by, someone is indeed living there and I
haven't had the chance to stop and see how it looks.&nbsp; I was so
frightened as a teenager in that house. Couldn't stay alone, even in
daylight. Since then I have been drawn to the house. My family and
friend could not believe I wanted to live there as an adult (with two
small children)&nbsp; I can't believe I wanted to either. But it always
pulls me back.<br>

Purchase a Home<br>
<br>
By: ozziefudd@comcast.net<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We purchase a home in Randallstown the end of 1981. At settlement, one
of the owners said, &#8220;I&#8217;m so glad a happy, young family is moving into
that sad house.&#8221; No explanation was given. <br>
After moving in New Years Day of 1982, we soon noticed it was difficult
to cross through the living room without an &#8220;eerie&#8221; feeling and every
once in a while you could smell an odor of cold ashes in there. We
thought it might be the fireplace in the next room, but found it
wasn&#8217;t. Years later a neighbor shared that someone had burned to death
in a fire in the living room.<br>
It wasn&#8217;t long after finding out about the death that my children
started reporting the appearance of a tall, dark haired man with a
beard who would appear at their bedroom doors. They said though he
didn&#8217;t actually do anything, he was a threatening presence and they
were very afraid of him. We haven&#8217;t learned who this presence might be.<br>
After more than 20 years in this house, we have &#8220;imprinted&#8221; it with our
presence and there are no eerie feelings or apparitions visiting
anymore.<br>

Two Personal Stories<br>
<br>
By: anonymous<br>
<br>
I'll call the first story My Brother-in-Law's Farewell.&nbsp; About 30
years ago my wife's oldest brother was killed in an accident at age
23.&nbsp; The days following were a blur of shock and grief.&nbsp; On
the second night neither of us could sleep, so we sat up in bed holding
each other.&nbsp; I finally drifted off for a while but was awakened by
the strong sense of someone else in the bedroom.&nbsp; I glanced at the
clock, saw that it was a few minutes after 2 a.m., then saw a
bluish-white light coming from the opposite corner of the room.&nbsp;
It was oblong in shape, about 5 feet high and maybe a foot or so off
the floor. It had no particular human characteristics except its
general size.&nbsp; Then a voice inside my head said very clearly,
"It's all right.&nbsp; <br>
Everything's OK.&nbsp; Please take care of her."&nbsp; A sense of peace came over me and I slept soundly until the next morning.<br>
When we sat down to breakfast I wasn't sure what to do.&nbsp; I clearly
remembered what happened but couldn't decide whether it was a dream or
possibly a hallucination brought on by stress and lack of sleep.&nbsp;
My wife and I both have advanced degrees in the sciences and we're not
given to fantastical explanations of events, so I decided not to say
anything to her. <br>
&nbsp; However, part-way through the meal she stopped and asked if
anything strange had happened during the night.&nbsp; Yes, I said, but
did not go into any further explanation.&nbsp; Then she quietly told
me, "A little after two I saw a bright light and heard the words 'It's
all right. Everything's OK' "...<br>
The story doesn't end there, however.&nbsp; Her younger brother had
temporarily moved into the deceased brother's apartment to help deal
with packing and other necessary tasks.&nbsp; That weekend he came home
and told us that the same night we saw the white light, he had been
awakened by footsteps going from the front door into the spare bedroom
where the older brother (an electrical<br>
engineer) had set up his workshop.&nbsp; Some pieces of equipment
suddenly were switched on, operated for a few seconds, and then just as
suddenly shut off. <br>
&nbsp; The footsteps then reversed from the workshop to the front door and faded <br>
away.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning her younger brother checked the doors and windows - <br>
everything was securely locked.<br>
The only thing I can conclude is that all of us had been paid one last visit to say good-bye.<br>
The second story I'll title The Ghostly Pug.&nbsp; When I was in middle school my <br>
parents bought a pug dog as a pet.&nbsp; He quickly established himself as Chief <br>
Dog of the House, with the special responsibility of making sure that no one <br>
overslept each morning.&nbsp; In my case he accomplished that task by nosing open <br>
the door to my bedroom, running across the floor and making a flying leap <br>
onto the bed. He would then lick my face until I was either awake enough or <br>
frustrated enough to get moving.<br>
The years eventually took their toll, and by the time I was in graduate <br>
school he was crippled by arthritis and other infirmities.&nbsp; My parents and I <br>
finally had to make the heartbreaking decision to release our pet - our <br>
friend - from his pain.&nbsp;&nbsp; A few mornings afterwards I was in that halfway <br>
stage between slumber and consciousness, trying to decide whether to get up <br>
or sleep some more.&nbsp; Then I heard the bedroom door open slightly, followed <br>
by the sound of little feet running across the rug.&nbsp; Something - not a <br>
20-lb. pug, but more like a light pillow - landed on the bed.&nbsp; I felt puffs <br>
of air against my face as if something were trying to make contact without <br>
quite succeeding.<br>
After what seemed like perhaps 15 seconds or so, I heard a voice, in the <br>
same sort of way I heard my brother-in-law's voice, say "I'm sorry, but he <br>
has to go now."&nbsp; The puffs of air stopped and the slight weight disappeared <br>
from the bed.&nbsp; I don't know what made me turn my head towards the wall, but <br>
when I did I saw an image as if in a window: green fields, a spring day, and <br>
a young and limber pug dog running happily through the grass.&nbsp; A few more <br>
seconds and the scene faded back into a plain wall.&nbsp; It took me much longer <br>
to stop crying, but I knew our little pug was happy forever.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
My Ghost Story<br>
<br>
By: res6l970@verizon.net<br>
<br>
<br>
So you would like to hear a Ghost story? Well I&#8217;ll tell you mine, if I
may. Very few people have heard this story and I think it may rest some
troubled thoughts I get from time to time. In the year 1970, some
friends and I shared an interest in the paranormal. The famed Ghost
Hunter Hans Holtzer was big then and my friends and I devoured his
books and came to the conclusion we would like to try our hand at such
things and perhaps encounter something along these lines ourselves. Now
Mr. Holtzer, mind you, prefers to use Trance Mediums in his work to use
as a means to locate any entities he may be seeking out. We had no
Trance Mediums at our disposal and were wary of any we may have access
to as we had no way of confirming their abilities so we decided to
pursue any and all of the local legendary hauntings in the area
ourselves. We went through many of these items at our gatherings and
one in particular caught our attention. It was on a lonely stretch of
road that had a sordid past and it had reports of women screaming and
the proverbial spectral hitch hiker but one thing caught my attention
quickly. There were reports of a glowing sphere (an orb as they are
called now) chasing after cars down this road. We decided to track down
this report first to see if we could find any reliable witness to this
phenomenon and at first met with no luck whatsoever. One of my friends
had an uncle who worked as a County Detective for many years and one
day her and I were at her moms house when he happened by. The
conversation drifted to our interest and, to our surprise and delight,
he knew of this road and it&#8217;s history. The road, it seemed, indeed had
a sordid past and he filled us in on it&#8217;s rather dark and depressing
history. Murders, suicides and the like had occurred on this road and
he himself had been involved in some of those investigations thus
lending some credence to the legends we were hearing. We then talked
about the various reports of Ghostly phenomenon and he had also heard
of these. I then asked him if he had heard of the Orb and indeed he had
and knew a person who had told him he had seen it himself. I then asked
him if he believed this person and he replied he did indeed believe
them and apparently gave him the impression I was skeptical about what
he was telling us because he picked up the phone and called this
person. He then put me on the phone with this lady, who worked at the
County Sheriffs office with him and she told me her story. She and her
boyfriend had been on that road some fifteen years before and were
parked by a set of railroad tracks that bisected the road and were in
the habit of using this as a place a make out place due to its
remoteness. They had seen the Orb, and yes it did end up chasing them
off. That did it for me, and my friends and I resolved to stake this
place out and see what we may. We began to visit the place on the road
near the tracks and with all four of us in one of our friends window
van drive out there about twice a week and just sit and observe.<br>
We probably went out there three weeks running and saw nothing but our
patience was eventually rewarded, if you would care to call it that.
First I must describe the area we were in. We were stopped on the road
with the railroad tracks in front of us that crossed the road at about
a 30 degree angle. To our left there was a clearing that extended back
about 40 feet to a tree line that cut into a woods that surrounded this
part of the road and added to its seclusion. Behind this tree line was
a marshy area with some sparse trees and bushes back there. On the
night of our first encounter all was dark as there was no moon out to
speak of and suddenly there appeared a yellow glow behind that tree
line. It seemed to be floating about three feet off the groung and was
just sort of drifting about back there. The really weird thing was it
didn&#8217;t seem to cast any sort of illumination around it as it moved. In
other words it wasn&#8217;t lighting up the area it was in it was just
glowing out there like a big firefly. Soon it just vanished and we sat
a while longer to see if it would return but when it became apparent it
was gone we left. I was skeptical at this point and wondered if it was
the proverbial swamp gas or something along those lines so further
investigation was needed which was agreed upon. Our next trip turned up
nothing but we were persistent by this time and upon our next visit it
appeared again. When it appeared this time it was seen to be more
active. It was again floating about three feet above the ground but was
like dancing, for lack of a better description. It stayed much longer
this time also staying for some ten minutes before vanishing again. We
returned two nights later and, to our amazement, it was already there
when we pulled up. We killed the lights on the van and turned off the
engine and there it was, floating about back there. After about five
minutes of this I said out loud something to the effect that I wondered
if there was someone out there with a light of some sort trying to make
fools out of us. Now I have a long history of saying things out loud
that I want to immediately take back and this quickly became one of
those times. The Orb suddenly stopped moving and began to appear to
glow brighter. It then began to make sudden, jerky, movements. My
friend, who was driving the van said to me that it seemed as though I
had pissed it off. This also seemed to have a reaction on it as it
became even more agitated and the glow became even brighter. Suddenly,
it burst through the trees and into the clearing, affording us a clear
view of it which I still dream of occasionally. It was about two feet
in diameter and the yellow glow was quite bright now and again I
noticed it cast no reflective aura on the ground beneath it. It hovered
there for a few seconds and then rapidly moved towards us about ten
feet or so. We were mesmerized by this and sat there which seemed to
really piss it off as it came again about ten feet toward us and
stopped. When this happened we began to feel it. It projected
malevolence and fear which hit us all at the same time. <br>
It then advanced another ten feet which put it at about that distance
from the van at which point I, and everyone else, wanted to leave, now.
As the driver fumbled for the keys it began to make a few jerky, side
to side movements and then dropped close to the ground. I then saw a
piece of what looked to be a railroad tie that was laying on the ground
beneath it and it rose suddenly and when it did it flung this rather
large piece of wood at us and it hit the side of the van with a loud
bang. This prompted the driver into action and he slammed the van into
drive and we fled as fast as we could. I turned around and behind us
was the Orb, chasing us down the road as was reported by others before
us. Eventually it broke off the chase and the last I saw of it, it shot
across the road and out of sight. Needless to say we were freaking out
and went to a local drive in and got something to drink. We never
returned to that road after that as we were all badly shaken and it was
some time before we even talked about it. It was apparent this thing
was a powerful, malevolent, entity that meant us harm and we saw no
need to further provoke it again. Thirty years passed and two of those
friends of mine had passed away and the other married and had kids and
the like. I still see her once in a while and she is well. I was out
with my wife and was sitting in a tavern with her, having a drink after
work when I noticed a younger man at the table next to us. He was
wearing a shirt with a logo on it from a local Ghost Hunting group that
has since disbanded. He seemed knowledgeable and he inquired about my
thoughts on the subject. I told him I was indeed interested in things
paranormal and had been for quite some time. He told me then he was
having a hunt coming up and wondered if I would be interested in
joining him. To my amazement when I enquired where they were going he
told me they were headed out on that road. I promptly declined which
seemed to surprise him. I then told him I had a very bad experience out
there and had no intention of ever going out there which really set him
off. He wanted to know more and I told him this story which really
floored my wife as I never told her of this. He told me to wait and ran
out to his car and brought back a briefcase. In it he had several
photos. These were taken a few days before on that damn road. The road
is closed now and overgrown with weeds and such as it has been bought
by the State to be used as prairie land and they had went out there on
foot. I gave him directions to where this all happened down by the
railroad tracks and all, and also gave him my E-MAIL address and bade
him good hunting<br>

Granny"s House<br>
<br>
By: tech_36_2000@sbcglobal.net<br>
<br>
When I was 2 yrs old, my father (David ) and my uncle Tommy (his
brother) were killed in a trucking accident in 1958. They were the only
children my grandparents had.&nbsp; My grandparent lived in a tiny town
in Arkansas called Winthrop.&nbsp; Where David and Tommy are buried. My
mom eventually remarried and we moved to Oklahoma. Occassionally we
would visit our grandparents in Winthrop, spending a week at a time
there.&nbsp; <br>
Set the scene:<br>
Granny's house was really old. It had 15ft high ceilings. Screened in
front porch, with another exterior porch added on later. In the living
room, there was a big potbellied stove used for heat. The house did not
have a bathroom in it.&nbsp; No hot water heater, all water was drawn
from the well in the back yard.&nbsp; To bathe, you had to boil water
on the stove,&nbsp; and pour it in the wash tub. The bathroom (so to
speak) was the outhouse in the back yard, where no one went after dark.
There were no locks on the front and rear doors. There was simply a
piece of wood with a nail driven thru it. You would turn the piece of
wood sideways to lock the door. <br>
The house consisted of a living room,&nbsp; to the right of the living
room, was the master bedroom, beyond that was the dining room which led
to the kitchen,&nbsp; then back to the living room. One big square.
There was one extra bedroom next to the master bedroom <br>
but it was big enough for 3 little girls to share. <br>
Just beyond the house was a forest that surrounded the house on three
sides. There were no neighbors within 1/2 mile of the house.&nbsp; Just
creepy woods with wild animals that howl at night.<br>
I was always afraid of staying at granny's house. During the day it was great, but at night it was different. <br>
The Ghosts:<br>
Rumor has it that the lady that used to live in granny's house, fell
dead in the front doorway one afternoon, and her body was stuffed in
the attic. There was never any proof of that. But I always wondered
about it. <br>
One night we were up for a visit and my parents and grandparents
decided to take a drive to Texarkana and leave the kids home
alone.&nbsp; On this trip, we brought my sister's friend Pauline with
us.&nbsp; There were six of us kids left home alone.&nbsp; Me, my 2
sisters, Pauline, and my 2 brothers who were infants. <br>
We had put my brothers to bed and the four of us were sitting in the
living room chatting, watching tv, and doing girl stuff.&nbsp; Now from
my vantage point,&nbsp; I could see directly into the kitchen from the
living room sofa.&nbsp; I could see the window above the sink which
looked out over the backyard. As we were sitting there chatting,&nbsp;
I happened to look up at the window and I saw a man's face staring back
at me. There was no neck, or shoulders,&nbsp; just a transparent head
with piercing eyes staring at me with a sinister smile on his face. I
screamed and dove over the sofa. My sisters saw it too.<br>
So we gathered up or courage and decided to check the house. Two girls
go thru the kitchen then into the dining room. The other two will go
thru the master bedroom, check on the boys and meet up in the dining
room.&nbsp; Once we got in the dining room, we saw that the backdoor
was standing open so we closed it and "locked" in.&nbsp;&nbsp; My
sister proped a chair under the door knob as an extra brace. Then we
all huddled in the living room scared to death.&nbsp; The face in the
window is still watching us with an evil grin. Suddenly the walls start
to shake, the windows start to rattle, the front door flew open.
There's a loud crash in the dining room.&nbsp; Screams are coming from
every direction outside the house. We ran to the bedroom to protect the
babies who were sound asleep.&nbsp; Suddenly all is quiet. Deathly
quiet. The face in the window is gone.<br>
The back door is standing open. The chair we placed against the back
door is on the other side of the room. Never disturbing anything in
it's path. The "lock" is turned straight up and down.&nbsp; We slammed
the back door, placed the chair up against it. Took the shovel from the
pot bellied stove, shoved it in the jam of the front door.&nbsp; We
gathered&nbsp; butcher knives, iron skillets,&nbsp; anything we could
find and sat on the floor of the living room in a huddle, scared to
death. <br>
Suddenly the front door flew open with a loud crash. Screams and
moaning coming from everywhere. Windows rattling, walls shaking, the
back door flew open. The face is back in the window,
watching........&nbsp; staring at you.<br>
This went on for what seemed like hours.&nbsp; Finally we heard a knock
at the front door. We all got in a huddle and moved slowly toward the
door. Pulled the curtain back and there our parents were. We told them
of our ordeal, they laughed as though they didn't believe us. <br>
Later that same night:<br>
After everyone is gone to bed. The house is dark, all is quiet........ or so you think.<br>
Remember this house has no indoor bathroom.&nbsp; I'll be damn if I'm
going to the outhouse after a night like this. Not even with a
flashlight !!&nbsp;&nbsp; That only left one option. <br>
Take a bucket out on the front porch and do your business. Off in the
distance, in the field on the left side of the house, there is a blue
mist in the shape of a man floating toward me. I was terrified and went
running back inside.&nbsp; My older sister went out next. She also saw
what appeard to be a ghost floating toward the house, but this time it
was even closer.&nbsp; Finally my other sister went outside, but she
didn't see the blue mist in the distance. It apparently vanished.&nbsp;
Suddenly, the mist comes up from under the porch slats and completely
surrounds her. She's so frightened, she can't move, with tears
streaming down her face. After a few minutes, the mist disappeard, we
grabbed my sister and went running for cover under the blankets. We had
had enough for one night.&nbsp; We all huddled in our bed until
daylight.&nbsp; <br>
The next morning...&nbsp; there was never any evidence of what had happened that night in granny's house. But we know it did. <br>
In the early 1970's, my grandfather died and I had to return to that
old house for the funeral. I guess some families still believe in old
customs. Instead of using a funeral home, they brought my grandfather's
body home for the wake, and placed his casket in the living room. The
funeral was scheduled for the next day.&nbsp; Forgive me, but I just
could not sleep in that old house one more night, all the while knowing
my grandfather is dead in the next room. <br>

I think I've had some kind of connection with spooks all my life. I don't know quite what it is, though.<br>
When I was little, we lived in Ohio. My mom and dad would drop off my
brother and I at Grandma's house for the day. Our cousins would be
there, too. There was always something mildly creepy about Grandma's
bedroom. The rest of the house was really cool--filled with
photographs, an entire room for toys, and a room with yard-sale scores,
and I always loved exploring the rest of the house. But God help me,
her room always frightened me. It was the most normal-looking room of
all. Something always felt off, though, and just once, I think I saw
some odd shadow dart across the wall in the broad daylight, when we
were supposed to be napping. This led me to scream for Gram and my
brother, who, from that day forth, would have to sit and keep an eye on
me until I finally went to bed.<br>
Gram also said that the house next door was haunted by a man named Leroy, but I don't know whether this is true or not.<br>
Gram died about 8 years ago in the house, and my uncle moved his family in. <br>
They spiffed it up--no more room full of yard-sale score and stuffed
animals. Instead, my cousins decorated their rooms in a typical
teenage-girl way, and Gram's old bedroom was changed into a game room,
with a pool table, darts, and a closet with a fridge full of liquor. I
haven't been to my uncle's in years, but one incident stands out with
me. I was attempting to play pool by myself (because of my wild claims
of seeing things all over, I never managed to make many friends) and
felt someone watching over my shoulder. I turned around, expecting to
see my cousin Amber fiddling around with my pool cue, because she would
do that when Dad was trying to line up a shot. But nobody was there at
all. This time, the room didn't feel as evil as it once did. It felt a
little mischievous, but not really evil. Perhaps it was Grandma,
keeping an eye on things.<br>
We moved down to North Carolina and nothing really happened for awhile.
I was relieved. Maybe if I stopped making these claims of seeing and
feeling odd things, I could make some friends. And I did. But we hopped
from house to house, finally settling in a newly-built quiet suburban
neighborhood across the street from some woods. This house always felt
like it had something cheerful following us around, although nobody
ever said anything, and my parents and brother dismissed it as me
having an overactive imagination. Sometimes the dogs would start
barking furiously or growling at absolutely nothing--they still do that
today, in fact. Although our house went up in flames a few months ago,
my stepmother, father, and the dogs moved in next door and they still
bark at nothing.<br>
I once spent the night over at a friend's on Halloween. This place
always felt uneasy. She told me--dead seriously--that it was haunted. I
believed her! I always felt like something nasty was just around the
corner at that house--not merely mischievous, but outright NASTY. So I
don't know WHAT possessed me to spend the night at her house on
Halloween! Anyway, we sat down and watched cartoons on TV rather
uneventfully. The motion-detector witch-in-a-rocking-chair decoration
was getting on our nerves, so we took the batteries out and tossed
them. Keep that in mind--absolutely no batteries, no power source. My
friend reached out for a handful of candy from our grand haul and the
witch started rocking back and forth, cackling! <br>
As if it still had batteries! It was midnight outside, but both of us
STILL bolted outside and spent a good deal of the night in the front
yard in lawn-chairs.<br>
My friend also said that she had seen her grandfather's glasses moving
around--floating above the table--one day while she was making a
package of ramen noodles in the kitchen. She knew that something wasn't
right about that house. We rarely stayed inside to play. We would
either wander around the neighborhood, walk to the playground, or stay
outside in the swimming pool area.<br>
And now I've moved once more to a newly-built quiet suburban
neighborhood, and my entire family is pretty sure there's something
about this house... <br>
even though it was newly built and everything. My stepsister says she's
heard things scurrying about the ceiling, knocking as if they were at
the door, footsteps, or scratching on inside walls. My mother says
she's seen some stuff seemingly move across the counter as her back was
turned and nobody else was around. There are some random cold spots in
the hall, den, my room, and my other stepsister's room. And sometimes
the furniture seems to shake underneath you. We call this
"thing"--whatever it is--James Stern, because sometimes, for no real
reason, lots of junk mail is delivered to a man by that name, although
nobody by that name ever lived here.<br>
There's another kind of thing around here, too, that makes no noise,
but it seems to be a slightly more touchy-feely ghost. Sometimes you'll
be sitting on the couch and you'll feel like someone is leaning over
your shoulder, like they're trying to see what you're doing--it does it
whenever I'm writing or typing, when my stepfather is working on his
work stuff, or when my stepsiblings are trying to pick a movie to
watch. I call it the Nosy Ghost, in the most affectionate way. But I'd
be glad to share what I'm writing with it--it seems friendly enough by
just being around and not causing any real trouble. Sometimes, just
prior to this feeling, you'll smell something incredibly sweet, almost
like honeysuckle, and it'll stick around for awhile. We don't grow
honeysuckle, we don't have scented candles (they make my grandma and
stepfather sneeze), and my stepsisters don't own any honeysuckle
perfume, so I'm pretty sure it's not them.<br>
So there you have it--my 18 entire years of slightly odd happenings and
goings-on. I've only "seen" a ghost twice--the odd shadow darting
across Gram's room and whatever moved Kristen's motion-detector on
Halloween--but I'm pretty sure they're around some places, and I'm
pretty sure James Stern and the Nosy Ghost are hanging around here.<br>

St. Gertrude Church in St. Clair Shores<br>
<br>
<br>
By: Ma5339@aol.com<br>
<br>
I happened across this web site last night and when I read the piece
about St. Gertrude Church it gave me chills. I used to live in a small
apartment complex next door to the church. From day one strange things
happened, including all of my circuit breakers snapping off
simultaneously, small objects disappearing that never resurfaced, and
waking up in the middle of the night having heard my name called (I
lived alone) paralyzed with fear feeling a presence in the room. These
are just a few of the things I experienced while living there, and I
would always try to rationalize the things that happened even though I
knew something was not quite right about the place. Now, after reading
the St. Gertrude story, I know that there was definitely some haunting
going on.<br>

I have lived in old houses my entire life. My mother and I have never
lived in a house under the age of 150 years old. The newest house that
we moved into is 163 years old and is made of white stucco.We moved out
9 months ago. We have lived in the same area for years and we do know
that our house as well as many others built on the blocks surrounding
us are built over what was once the underground railroad. Since moving
in there have been creaks and weird sounds but nothing until about 7 to
8 months after living there.<br>
One nite me and my freind has come home around 1:30 am and no one was
home. We went into the front room to watch tv. It is a small room with
a window looking out into the front porch outside. As we sat watching
tv we heard the screen on the window rapping like wind was shaking it.
It was 75 degrees out even during the nite and there was no wind. We
watched the screen move slightly and then gasped as the whole screen
slid down the window calmly as if someone was sliding it down.<br>
Me and my friend were horrified. Needless to say she spent the nite.
The next day my mom put the screen back up. The very next nite I came
home by myself around the same time. I was extremely hungry and made a
meal and sat down by myself to watch TV. Once again I started to hear
the screen slide down the window and slammed to the ground. Why at this
time right as I sit down would it come down? We removed the screen
indefinitely. About two weeks after this happend I was getting ready to
go out around 9. Me and my friend were there together. My radio
unexpetantly went out, my room being on the first floor is right next
to the front tv room were the screen had kept falling down.<br>
Thats when we heard a bunch of crashed and glass breaking. Scared we
went to the front room all the frames in the room were on the floor and
3 our of 7 of them had all the glass shattered. We left immediately.<br>
When my mom got pregnant our neighbor started insisting that we get our
house blessed. When my mom pushed her for further information she told
her that<br>
36 years ago an older man lived in our house with his wife and two
daughters. Soon his wife and daighters just up and left. She then
revealed that soon after his wife and children left him our neighbors
daughter was raped by that man in his basement. He moved out one week
later and was killed in an automobile accident. We have since moved and
I can say we are a little more nervous about the thought of thise who
have inhabited houses before us.<br>
