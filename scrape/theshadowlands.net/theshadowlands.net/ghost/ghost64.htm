<P><B>I LIVE IN A HOUSE THAT IS ABOUT 38 YEARS OLD. I'M NOT REAL SURE OF
IT'S</B>
<P><B>HISTORY BUT I DO BELIEVE I HAVE SOME KIND OF SPIRIT THAT IS LIVING</B>
<P><B>THERE. THE OCCURENCES ONLY HAPPEN EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE. LET ME TELL
YOU</B>
<P><B>ABOUT THE ONE THAT MAKES ME BELIEVE. MY AUNT AND I WERE SITTING IN
MY</B>
<P><B>LIVING ROOM TALKING ONE DAY WHEN ALL OF THE SUDDEN WE HEARD A CRASH
FROM</B>
<P><B>THE BACK OF THE HOUSE. WE WENT TO INVESTIGATE AND WHEN WE LOOKED IN
MY</B>
<P><B>SPARE ROOM THERE WAS A PICTURE MIRROR THAT HAD BEEN SITTING ON THE
TOP</B>
<P><B>SHELF OF A BOOKCASE LYING ON THE FLOOR FACE UP WITH WHAT LOOKED LIKE
A</B>
<P><B>BIG FOOTPRINT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT. NOTHING ELSE ABOUT IT WAS BROKEN
JUST</B>
<P><B>A FOOTPRINT,THERE WAS NO WIND OR ANYTHING TO KNOCK IT OFF. MY AUNT</B>
<P><B>MENTION THAT RIGHT BEFORE WE HEARD THE CRASH SHE HAD SEEN A BLACK
SHADOW</B>
<P><B>GOING DOWN THE WALL, LIKE SOMEONE WALKING DOWN THE HALL. THAT IS WHEN
I</B>
<P><B>TOLD HER THAT EVERY SINCE I HAD MOVED IN I AND MY SON HAD SEEN THE</B>
<P><B>SHADOW.</B>

<P>
<P><B>I bought a used trailer in the summer of "93 and the trailer had been</B>
<P><B>completely redone, the outside was not beatup in any way so I wonder</B>
<P><B>what the inside looked like. I moved in about the end of october '93,</B>
<P><B>being single I was the only one here. I could feel a presence here
but</B>
<P><B>was not afraid in any way. A few months later I became sick and did
not</B>
<P><B>get out of bed for 2 days, on the second night while I was lying in
bed</B>
<P><B>I felt the covers being pulled up around me and it was as if some one</B>
<P><B>was tucking them in around me. I could also feel the breath of "who</B>
<P><B>ever" it was. I was not on any medicine or dreaming in no way!!!! A</B>
<P><B>short time later I felt the bed sag as it would when some one sits
on</B>
<P><B>the edge of it, but no one was there. two of my cousins have seen the</B>
<P><B>same little girl that I have standing in the hall looking into the</B>
<P><B>living room. she looks to be 8-11 years old, dark hair to the middle
of her</B>
<P><B>back, light blue dress with small yellow flowers on it. A long white</B>
<P><B>ribbon in her hair, very beautiful child, and she just seems to be</B>
<P><B>looking at us, she is not frowning nor smiling. I have also noticed
that</B>
<P><B>when I take pictures only around the couch, day or night, there is
a</B>
<P><B>white "mist" or cloud in the pictures. I can not figure it out. I
have</B>
<P><B>now married and we do not have children but Kevin has three from a</B>
<P><B>previous marriage and that seems to help out. "Sarha" as I call her
does</B>
<P><B>not appear as often as before. I never felt in any danger or harm
from</B>
<P><B>her, maybe just company knowing I was not alone here.</B>
<P><B>Thank you so much</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=haunted>Haunted Louisiana</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By: bwarren@rgsd.org</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have lived in Missouri most of my life and never have had any
significant</B>
<P><B>paranormal experiences here. But I have had two experiences in
Louisiana,</B>
<P><B>one in St. Francisville (the Myrtles Plantation) and one in New Orleans
(the</B>
<P><B>Beauregard-Keyes House).</B>
<P>
<P><B>As many of you know, the Myrtles Plantation is considered one of the
most</B>
<P><B>haunted houses in the world. When I explored the beautiful (but very
eerie)</B>
<P><B>grounds on a visit in April 1998, I was tapped on the shoulder by an
unseen</B>
<P><B>hand. I also took several snapshots of a famous mirror that often
shows</B>
<P><B>ghostly faces when photographed. Sure enough, after I had the film</B>
<P><B>developed, several faces were visible in one shot and the body of a
woman in</B>
<P><B>old-fashioned clothing was clearly visible in another. All in all,
it was</B>
<P><B>quite an exhilarating visit!</B>
<P>
<P><B>The Beauregard-Keyes House is one of many famous haunted sites in New</B>
<P><B>Orleans. As I was touring the house with a large group in April 1997,
I kept</B>
<P><B>hearing loud footsteps behind me. I assumed it was another tour guide
or a</B>
<P><B>caretaker or something. Everywhere we went, the footsteps followed,
but they</B>
<P><B>never quite caught up with us. At one point, as our group turned the
corner</B>
<P><B>of an L-shaped wing of the house, I heard the footsteps in the room
just</B>
<P><B>behind us. Then all hell broke loose. It sounded like someone was
opening</B>
<P><B>and closing drawers and throwing papers around in that room. I
couldn't</B>
<P><B>stand the suspense any longer. So I walked back around the corner and
looked</B>
<P><B>in the room. No one was there, and no papers were askew. In fact, the
room</B>
<P><B>was immaculate. Puzzled, I turned around to rejoin the tour group when
I</B>
<P><B>almost ran into three other tourists. They had heard it, too.</B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>One time a few years ago I woke up in the middle of the night to find
two</B>
<P><B>darker than dark figures standing across my room staring at me. At
first I was</B>
<P><B>scared because I heard that dark figuers were evil but they weren't
doing</B>
<P><B>anything to me so I just stared back at them. After awhile I went back
to</B>
<P><B>sleep and never saw them again.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Another spirit I saw was a little man about 3 feet tall and had a cane.
I saw</B>
<P><B>him almost once a week but the time I saw him was about a month after
I saw</B>
<P><B>the black figures and he was about 2 feet from my face. It was kind
of</B>
<P><B>shocking to wake up to that, so I jumped about as high as you can.
I noticed</B>
<P><B>that he always came at exactly 3:00 am and that my dog wasn't in my
room even</B>
<P><B>though she slept in there all night. One time I woke up a little before
3 am</B>
<P><B>and got up to see if he was coming, and I saw him walking out of my
parents</B>
<P><B>room and down the hall to my brothers room. After about a minute I
saw him</B>
<P><B>walk out of his room and towards my room. Since I was standing in the
doorway</B>
<P><B>he stopped and stood there looking at me. I also thought it was weird
that</B>
<P><B>every family that ever lived in that house got divorced. </B>

</H3><P><B>By:  boo_356@yahoo.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have a story that still chills me to the bones. Our haunting
started</B>
<P><B>about a year and a half ago. I was the first to see our ghost, but
now</B>
<P><B>he has made himself well known. One night last summer I was home</B>
<P><B>alone. The settings were perfect for a ghost, 2:30 in the morning,
</B>
<P><B>and a very bad storm outside. I had been watching Tv and was getting</B>
<P><B>up to got to bed. That's when I heard a faint knocking sound. It was</B>
<P><B>coming from our dining room. I have to admit I was scared of a robber</B>
<P><B>or something, it being 2:30 in the morning. I picked up the poker to</B>
<P><B>the fire place and walked in the dining room. The knocking was coming</B>
<P><B>from the bay window. Half scared out of my wits already from the
storm</B>
<P><B>I was half determined to turn around and pretend I didn't hear it.
But</B>
<P><B>the other part of me wanted an explanation. I walked up to the
window,</B>
<P><B>but since it was dark out I couldn't see a thing. That's when the</B>
<P><B>lightening flashed, and I saw a face glaring right back in at me with</B>
<P><B>the saddest expression on it's face I had ever seen.  At first I was</B>
<P><B>so shocked, my hair stood on end, and my heart stopped. Then, in the</B>
<P><B>next instant, the face was gone. I grabbed the nearest phone and</B>
<P><B>called 911. I reported a suspected burgaler. The police came but not</B>
<P><B>even a clue was found. They set up a watch in my neighborhood, but</B>
<P><B>nothing came out of that either. After a while they gave up. That's</B>
<P><B>when our ghost came back. Late one night, about 3 weeks later,</B>
<P><B>everyone but my brother and I had gone to bed. That's when I heard
the</B>
<P><B>tapping. This time it was coming from the front door. My brother</B>
<P><B>insisted it was one of his late night friends looking to go out. He</B>
<P><B>opened the door and noone was there. Suddenly it was like a breeze</B>
<P><B>blew in the room, that was cold as ice, and literally knocked him off</B>
<P><B>his feet. Let me remind you this was a perfect night in early August.</B>
<P><B>The whole room grew very cold, and there was this smell that I still</B>
<P><B>can't describe. My brother picked himself up and gave me a look like</B>
<P><B>what the hell just happened?? We shut the front door, just as my mom</B>
<P><B>came down stairs. She also noticed the smell, although the room was</B>
<P><B>warming up some. I had heard plenty of ghost encounters in my life
to</B>
<P><B>know that whatever had been outside had wanted to come inside my</B>
<P><B>house, and just did. Not really saying much, we all went to bed. The</B>
<P><B>next day is when the actual haunting started. It begain with</B>
<P><B>unexplained smells and noises in certain rooms, and "cold" spots.</B>
<P><B>Then, we got to see our ghost. </B>
<P><B>We were just getting back some pics that we had taken about a week</B>
<P><B>after the knock at the door incident. In 3 pics taken in our living</B>
<P><B>room, there is a man standing in the corner, by the piano. He is very</B>
<P><B>transparent, but he sure wasn't there when we took the pics. We then</B>
<P><B>knew we had a ghost, not one who had died in the house or wanted</B>
<P><B>revenge but one who must have chosen us to live with. We even named</B>
<P><B>him, Sam. We heard him every night and every day, and we knew his</B>
<P><B>presence by nasty smells, or cold spots in warm rooms. But we have</B>
<P><B>only seen him in pictures. The best picture is one we took last</B>
<P><B>Christmas, you can see him standing in the kitchen right next to my</B>
<P><B>mom. She said that he just wanted his picture taken. Our ghost isn't
a</B>
<P><B>evil spirit or anything we would be afraid of, but it still sends</B>
<P><B>chills up my spine to think about the first night he was tapping at</B>
<P><B>the window </B>

<H3><B><A NAME=hats>Who's Been Touching My Hats</A></B>?
</H3><P><B>By: mnmoisant@CSUPomona.Edu</B>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I am an avid hat collector.  I love going to thrift shops and buying
old</B>
<P><B>hats.  I keep a lot of my hats on this hall tree that stands in the
foyer</B>
<P><B>of my house.  One night, some friends and I were all watching t.v.
in my</B>
<P><B>den.  (As a matter of fact, I think we were watching Fast Times at</B>
<P><B>Ridgemont High, because I had just bought it that day.)  So we were
all</B>
<P><B>watching this movie when we all noticed movement in the hallway (the
den</B>
<P><B>is situated so that you can see into the entry hallway, but you can't
see </B>
<P><B>into the foyer); I peered a little more closely and noticed that 3
of my </B>
<P><B>hats were on the floor near the hall tree.  I didn't think this was
a big </B>
<P><B>deal because the hats could have easily fallen.  My best friend got
up and</B>
<P><B> replaced the hats to their proper place.  Then about 10 minutes later,
we </B>
<P><B>all noticed something fall from the ceiling and land in front of the
bathroom</B>
<P><B> door (the foyer opens to the stairs that will take you to the bedrooms,
and </B>
<P><B>the hallway which leads to the den, and there is a bathroom in that
hallway,</B>
<P><B>which is around the corner from the foyer.)</B>
<P><B>I looked and saw that it was my hats again, the same three.  It was
as if</B>
<P><B>they had been picked up and thrown into the air.  There was no way</B>
<P><B>possible for the hats to just fall like that.  I asked my friend where
she</B>
<P><B>put the hats, and she told me that she had put them on the table next
to</B>
<P><B>the hall tree, so there was no way that those hats would have fallen,
and</B>
<P><B>even more so, if they did fall, there is no way they would jump up
by</B>
<P><B>themselves to the ceiling and then land around the corner from where
they</B>
<P><B>had originally been.  There was no one else in the house at the time.
 We</B>
<P><B>were all too scared to put the hats back (we didn't know what we would
see</B>
<P><B>around the corner) so we left them there, and almost immediately after
the</B>
<P><B>hats were thrown, this freezing gust of wind came at us from the
hallway,</B>
<P><B>but it was the middle of summer!!!!!! and hot outside.  We all got
freaked</B>
<P><B>out and my friends decided to go home, by the back door.  As soon as
they</B>
<P><B>left, I heard this strange sound, almost like something slowing in</B>
<P><B>revolutions, it was a very distinct sound, one that I had heard before,
I</B>
<P><B>turned around and saw on the kitchen table, a top (toy) slowly losing
its</B>
<P><B>momentum and revolution power that was making the familiar
click/scrape</B>
<P><B>noise.  The thing is that no one had been near the table, the top ,
which</B>
<P><B>is totally manual, had been spinning on its own.  I decided to join
my</B>
<P><B>friends.  </B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>         My experience happened when I was not even two- my parents</B>
<P><B>experienced it and told me the story a couple of years ago. We had
moved into</B>
<P><B>a townhome that had been renovated- it burned down before we moved
in. We had</B>
<P><B>been moved in fao about a week when my parents heard a baby crying
and</B>
<P><B>footsteps coming from the stairs area. There was a bathroom near the
stairs,</B>
<P><B>and when my parents would come down to investigate, the water in the
toilet</B>
<P><B>would be running just as if someone had flushed it. But who? The baby
crying</B>
<P><B>was even more annoying. They would come running into my room thinking
that it</B>
<P><B>was me, but I would be fast asleep. We didn't have any neighbors with
babies.</B>
<P><B>Where could the noise be coming from? My parents swore that it was
coming from</B>
<P><B>the stairs. Well, a couple of weeks later we were moving out of that
spooky</B>
<P><B>place and found out that a family of four- two parents, a toddler,
and an</B>
<P><B>infant were found under the stairs burned to death. Gross huh?</B>
<P>
<P><B>   Well, that's my experience. Thanks for taking the time to read it.

<P>
<P><B>I have never done anything like this before and </B>
<P><B>I'm not for sure that what i have to tell is even considered a ghost
story. To </B>
<P><B>be honest with you I have ignored the paranormal for most of my life
and thought </B>
<P><B>most of the stories to be myths. Then after the birth of my daughter
I </B>
<P><B>definately changed my mind. </B>
<P><B>I had just brought my daughter home from the </B>
<P><B>hospital and my husband and I were staying with his parents for a while.
One </B>
<P><B>night in the middle of the night I awoke and heard a loud ringing in
my </B>
<P><B>ears....I couldn't move nor could I talk ....I was trying to wake my
husband up </B>
<P><B>but I couldn't say anything to wake him up. </B>
<P><B>I felt the entire time like there was a presence </B>
<P><B>in the room however I didn't feel threatened by this presence what
so ever.And </B>
<P><B>all the while I still heard the loud ringing in my ears.</B>
<P><B>Finally the ringing started to stop and i could </B>
<P><B>start to move some...I finally woke my husband up and told him what
happened but </B>
<P><B>of course he laughed at me and told me to go back to sleep.</B>
<P><B>The next day I told my mother in law about my </B>
<P><B>experience and she swore that it was her aunt that had died when she
was </B>
<P><B>young....my mother in law was very close to her aunt and thought that
she had </B>
<P><B>come back on several occasions to check on my mother in law. She thought
that </B>
<P><B>maybe the aunt was coming to check on the new baby.....who knows? I
haven't had </B>
<P><B>an experience since then</B>

</H3><P><B>BY: Dmic19@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>This story may sound pretty far fetched but this is the truth. First
off</B>
<P><B>I bought a house that used to be a church back in the 18th century
and</B>
<P><B>it is haunted. After we moved in strange things started happening and</B>
<P><B>one I didn't know about for awhile. My 16 yr. old son was having a</B>
<P><B>nightmare every night and in the dream it showed  him a grave stone
and</B>
<P><B>a voice would say find this grave and you will know the truth. </B>
<P><B>So he started going to graveyards every day and I said what's the
deal</B>
<P><B>with these graveyards, he said I just like to go to them. Well this
went</B>
<P><B>on for a year then one day he said "Mom, I think something in this
house</B>
<P><B>wants me to go crazy. I can't stand going to those grave yards any
more</B>
<P><B>but I have that dream every night." Then he told me of the dream. I
said</B>
<P><B>stop going and the dreams will stop so he did and the dreams did
stop.</B>
<P><B>We thought that was the end of it for about 8 months then one day the</B>
<P><B>phone rang and I said hello and no one would answer so I hung up my</B>
<P><B>caller I.D. showed it was long distance. Pretty soon the phone rang
again</B>
<P><B>and it was the same person they still would not say anything so my</B>
<P><B>daughter came over. In a little and it rang again and I said oh it's
that</B>
<P><B>same one that won't answer so she answered the phone and she said
what?</B>
<P><B>I can't hear you seak up she said which Jim do you want my dad or my</B>
<P><B>brother she said just a minute she laid the phone down and said it's</B>
<P><B>some wierd chick for Jim she went outside and got my son he came in
an</B>
<P><B>got on the phone and he said what? Who? then his eyes got real big
and</B>
<P><B>he said I don't know no chick named Toshua and he hung up and went</B>
<P><B>outside. I called the number on the caller I.D. and it was a</B>
<P><B>disconnected number so I called the operator and she said that phone
was</B>
<P><B>out of order but there was as alternative number I could call the
place</B>
<P><B>was a grave yard about 70 miles away. So I caled the other number and
a</B>
<P><B>man answered the phone he said he was the grounds keeper and that no
one</B>
<P><B>was there today but him. I told him someone had called my house from</B>
<P><B>there 3 times today but from another number he said what number so
I</B>
<P><B>told him the other number and he said that phone is not working it
is in</B>
<P><B>the other office it is out of service no one could use that phone.
I said</B>
<P><B>well it's on my caller I.D. and it was a young girl named Toshua he
said</B>
<P><B>well I don't know what to say except maybe someone from the grave
wanted</B>
<P><B>to speak to someone at your house. I said I think the same thing. I
went</B>
<P><B>outside and told my son where the call came from and he acted very
afraid</B>
<P><B>and said I don't want to talk about it anymore. I said are you going
to</B>
<P><B>go to that grave yard and check it out and he said hell no. Well my</B>
<P><B>daughter said the girl sounded like someone who was real spaced out</B>
<P><B>because all she would say is I want Jim in a real wierd voice so with</B>
<P><B>all those dreams and then the phone call I would think that the same</B>
<P><B>thing was after him that was after him with the dreams. It freaked
him</B>
<P><B>out real bad. Some thing still bothers him sometimes at night when
he is</B>
<P><B>going to sleep. He said it's like every time he just gets to sleep
for</B>
<P><B>about a half an hour something taps on his shoulder and wakes him up
but</B>
<P><B>no one is there.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=farm>Grandpa's Farm</A></B>
</H3><P><B>BY: gumby_girl98@yahoo.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>    I love your site and end up scaring the hell out of myself when
I</B>
<P><B>read the stories on it. Anyway, to my story....when my Grandfather
and</B>
<P><B>Grandmother were first married, around the early 1900's, they lived
on</B>
<P><B>a farm in Kentucky. This farm, it seems, housed more than your normal</B>
<P><B>farm animals. At night, in the attic you could hear large pieces of</B>
<P><B>furniture being moved back and forth across the floor, very rapidly.</B>
<P><B>Needless to say, they wouldn't bother to check it out until daylight,</B>
<P><B>but when they did nothing at all was in the attic, it was completely</B>
<P><B>empty.</B>
<P><B>     Out back of the house there was a woodpile where all the wood
for</B>
<P><B>the heating and cooking was split and stacked.  Very late at night
you</B>
<P><B>could hear someone or something out there chopping wood. The
morning's</B>
<P><B>investigation showed my Grandfather's axe in the exact same spot he</B>
<P><B>had left it the day before and not a single stick of wood out of</B>
<P><B>place. One night my Grandfather felt especially brave, this courage</B>
<P><B>brought on by some homemade moonshine, so when he heard the commotion</B>
<P><B>at the woodpile he stood on the porch and yelled out "Chop! You
S.O.B,</B>
<P><B>chop!". Well, apparently the thing heard him, it began to chop faster</B>
<P><B>and faster and faster to the point where it was chopping at an
inhuman</B>
<P><B>rate of speed.  My Grandfather hightailed it into the house, grabbed</B>
<P><B>his shotgun, and sat up scared out of his wits for the rest of the</B>
<P><B>night. It goes without saying, my Grandfather never teased it again</B>
<P><B>while they lived there, which wasn't very long.</B>
<P><B>     Only my Grandfather and Grandmother lived on this farm and at</B>
<P><B>that time they had no children nor hired hands working on the farm
to</B>
<P><B>account for these stange happenings.</B>

<P><B>encounter of when I was sixteen.  I sincerely wish to assure you that
</B>
<P><B>I am not making the following up...I still remember facts very </B>
<P><B>clearly.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Mum and dad had a family quarrel with grandma and refused to speak
to </B>
<P><B>her for over 10 years.  I was only allowed to see her on her death
bed </B>
<P><B>a few minutes before she died; She smiled and made it clear that she
</B>
<P><B>remembered me.  I didn't know what to say and just promised her that
I </B>
<P><B>would pray for her.  She seemed to be very happy when I told her so
</B>
<P><B>and she nodded.  She died a few minutes later.</B>
<P>
<P><B>A week when by and I forgot all about grandma.  One night, at 2.30a.m.
</B>
<P><B>I woke up meaning to go to the bathroom.........Just two meters away
</B>
<P><B>from me on the third step of the staircase I saw a blurred tall figure
</B>
<P><B>without features.  It seemed like a foggy/stained appearance, just
</B>
<P><B>staring at me......I froze and attempted to call mum and dad, but just
</B>
<P><B>opened my mouth and no could not utter a sound.......it kept starring
</B>
<P><B>at me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Then I forced myself under the sheets and covered my head........I
</B>
<P><B>heard the broomstick hitting the wall three times (as if someone was
</B>
<P><B>playing with it).  Then the washing machine started working on it's
</B>
<P><B>own. It was then that dad got up and yelled at me to stop joking in
</B>
<P><B>the middle of the night and advised that I should quit going up and
</B>
<P><B>down the stairs bare foot during the night - it was driving him crazy-
</B>
<P><B>IT WASN'T ME!!</B>
<P>
<P><B>Another week went by and again during the night I needed to get out
of </B>
<P><B>bed....I tried to think the previous week was just a dream, I never
</B>
<P><B>believed in ghosts!   It was then I saw my grandma's face at the </B>
<P><B>window........and she was showing me a heart shaped red and white </B>
<P><B>carnation bouquet and smiling at me.......</B>
<P>
<P><B>I told mum the next day and she said that her four sons together threw
</B>
<P><B>that bouquet over her coffin during the funeral.  I never went to her
</B>
<P><B>funeral.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I spoke to one of her daughters, she just said that before dying
</B>
<P><B>she kept insisting  on seeing me for the simple reason that people
</B>
<P><B>kept telling her that  I resembled her in every way and it was a </B>
<P><B>torture for her not being able to see me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I did pray for her and didn't see her anymore!</B>
<P><B>I thank you for at least believing me.....no one ever did...</B>

</H3><P><B>BY: CntryRose4@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I don't have any pics or audio to send but I do have a very good story.
While</B>
<P><B>I have always believed in ghosts and things of that nature, my husband
was</B>
<P><B>very skeptical. It started when we moved into an old house in which
some had</B>
<P><B>died..an elderly man. The house was old and had hardwood floors. It
was a</B>
<P><B>beautiful little place for a couple. The night we moved in we decided
to sleep</B>
<P><B>on the floor in front of the fireplace. We started the fire and it
had burned</B>
<P><B>for several hours before we retired for the night. About two hours
into our</B>
<P><B>slumber I was awaken by an abrupt noise. I thought I was dreaming but
soon</B>
<P><B>realized that was not the case. Above us floated a thick, black band
of smoke</B>
<P><B>billowing out of the fireplace. I thought that an ember had jumped
onto the</B>
<P><B>blankets and set us on fire but nope--there was no explanation for
this</B>
<P><B>occurrence. We extinguished the fire and resumed sleeping. Then next
night I</B>
<P><B>was awakened by the sound of boots stepping across the hardwood floor.
I woke</B>
<P><B>my husband in a panic. He grabbed the gun and set out to find the
intruder.</B>
<P><B>After searching the house top to bottom and front to back, he found
nothing or</B>
<P><B>no one. This continued throughout the night. We joked about the ghost
in our</B>
<P><B>house and let it do its thing for a while--then things began to get
a bit more</B>
<P><B>dangerous. I had given birth to our first child about four months after
we had</B>
<P><B>moved in. The first night home the usual footsteps occurred but this
time they</B>
<P><B>would approach the bedroom door and stop. About the third time this
occurred I</B>
<P><B>attempted to open my eyes and make sure it was just our ghost and not
someone</B>
<P><B>else but I couldn't move, open my eyes, or anything. I began to breath
heavy,</B>
<P><B>as if I couldn't catch my breath, and break a sweat. I became
increasingly</B>
<P><B>concerned because my newborn was lying in the crib two feet from me
and I</B>
<P><B>could do anything to protect him. About ten minutes later I was able
to move</B>
<P><B>and immediately jumped to my feet and looked in the crib to check on
my child.</B>
<P><B>Relief set in when I found him to be OK. My husband awoke the next
morning for</B>
<P><B>work, kissed us good-bye and I went to lock the door behind him. I
went back</B>
<P><B>to the room and went to sleep trying to catch a couple of hours before
my son</B>
<P><B>awoke. About 20 minutes later I became increasingly hot and short of
breath</B>
<P><B>just like earlier in the morning. However, this time I was able to
move and I</B>
<P><B>got up from the bed to discover that our gas heater was turned all
the way up</B>
<P><B>with flames belching out of the face. It was so hot that the stone
grates</B>
<P><B>busted! I was beginning to wonder if I was living with a ghost or the
angel of</B>
<P><B>death. My husband was still a bit skeptical until this final episode.
We had</B>
<P><B>been discussing bills and were sitting on our sectional sofa. He laid
his</B>
<P><B>cigarettes down on the sofa beside him as we continued to talk. He
reached for</B>
<P><B>the smokes to find that they were gone! We both got up and began to
look for</B>
<P><B>them. We went from room to room and pulled the sofa apart and took
the</B>
<P><B>cushions off but no cigarettes. Finally we both left the room and came
back</B>
<P><B>about five minutes later to discover that the sectional was put back
together,</B>
<P><B>cushions on, and the cigarettes lying right where he had sat them.
This was an</B>
<P><B>eerie experience. I could go on and on about the things that came up
missing</B>
<P><B>or moved around, hot water running cold and knocks on the front door
with no</B>
<P><B>one there. Out of fear we moved the next day! Thanks for letting me
share my</B>
<P><B>story.</B>

</H3><P><B>BY: RGPRING1@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Ok....this is a story that happened to me when I was 8 or 9....I'm
not sure</B>
<P><B>which..</B>
<P>
<P><B>	It was about 7:15 - 7:20 in the morning and I was eating breakfast
before I</B>
<P><B>went to school (our breakfast table is in the kitchen and from there
you can see</B>
<P><B>most of the front door on the other side of the house) and I just happened
to</B>
<P><B>look up and see a shadow of a man about 6'+ on the wall closest to
the kitchen.</B>
<P><B>I guess then it noticed I was looking at it because it moved very fast
towards</B>
<P><B>the living room and ran towards the picture windows. As curious as
I am I then</B>
<P><B>went into the room to look for it. It wasn't there. I asked my stepfather
who</B>
<P><B>was still in bed if he had gotten up and moved around yet......no he</B>
<P><B>didn't.....I told my mom and she didn't really believe me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	About a year or so later we moved out of that house (I was 9 then).
We rented</B>
<P><B>a house for a while until we could find another at a reasonable
price......it</B>
<P><B>was here at this age and this house where I noticed somethng wasn't
right. I</B>
<P><B>saw the shadow again,and again,and again,etc. it would be in the hallways
at</B>
<P><B>night and rooms where there was little light....it started to scare
me..I told</B>
<P><B>my mom and once again she put it off as another example of my vivid</B>
<P><B>imagination. We finally left that house and moved in to my grand mothers
house</B>
<P><B>when she died.(I've experienced other things in this house not related
to</B>
<P><B>this"shadow"). When we moved I guess it decided to stop........how
do I say</B>
<P><B>this.."bothering" me as much but its still around. I see it out of
the corner</B>
<P><B>of my eye every now and then. Maybe it wants to keep haunting me but
maybe my</B>
<P><B>grandmother is keeping it from hurting us....When I see it I never
get a very</B>
<P><B>comfortable feeling.....I'm now 13 going on 14 and it still shows up
every</B>
<P><B>once in a while.......</B>
<P>
<P><B>(just for a couple examples on how this is real: 1) first incident-the
shadow</B>
<P><B>had to have come from the inside because outside it was completely
dark and the</B>
<P><B>only lights on was the one in the kitchen.</B>
<P><B>rest of incidents-a shadow can not change its angle on the</B>
<P><B>wall without a change in the angle of the light.</B>

</H3><P><B>By: stteb@home.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This isn't really much of a story, but to me it proves the reality
of the</B>
<P><B>supernatural, since it occurred to my mother, who would never ever
lie about</B>
<P><B>anything, much less this!</B>
<P><B>It happened when I wasn't much more than 7 years old, so this makes
the</B>
<P><B>story dated about 24 years ago.  We lived in a big house on North Drive
in</B>
<P><B>the city of Kitchener, and one day while my mother was alone in the
house,</B>
<P><B>cleaning the upstairs, she began to get the sensation of being watched.
 It</B>
<P><B>made her anxious, but it didn't make her want to bolt out of the house
or</B>
<P><B>anything like that.  She continued to  clean, and once in the
upstairs</B>
<P><B>bathroom, she began to scrub the tub.  It was then that it happened.
 Out of</B>
<P><B>the corner of her eye, she saw something.  Turning to look, my mother
saw in</B>
<P><B>the doorway of the bathroom a solid black figure, clearly definable,
with</B>
<P><B>hands and feet and easy to see fingers.  There were no facial features,
no</B>
<P><B>distinct detail, it was just as if a shadow were standing in front
of her,</B>
<P><B>watching her clean.  Well, needless to say, my mother kind of lost
it.</B>
<P><B>Then, in the blink of an eye, it was gone.  My mother ran out of the
house</B>
<P><B>and to a neighbor's, where she stayed until my father came home.</B>
<P><B>Later that evening, we received a phone call informing us of the fact
that</B>
<P><B>my father's mother, who lived in Amherst, Nova Scotia, had died.  A
chill</B>
<P><B>ran down my mother's spine when she found out that Grandma had died
in the</B>
<P><B>afternoon, at the same time she saw the figure in the bathroom doorway!
 It</B>
<P><B>was as if Grandma had reached out to say "goodbye".</B>
<P><B>That isn't the end of the story.  That night, after making preparations
to</B>
<P><B>go to Nova Scotia for the funeral, my mother had a dream that we were
in</B>
<P><B>Amherst, and that the entire family had gathered for a spaghetti
dinner.</B>
<P><B>Well, needless to say, a few days later when we reached my Grandma's
house</B>
<P><B>in Amherst, we walked through the door to see the entire family had</B>
<P><B>gathered, and were eating spaghetti!  My mother was almost in shock,
since</B>
<P><B>it was exactly like her dream.</B>
<P><B>I know this gives no one definitive evidence of the supernatural, but
it</B>
<P><B>does to me.  If you knew my mother, it would give you all the proof
you</B>
<P><B>needed.</B>

</H3><P><B>BY: Elmo1krf@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My mother has had a Madame Alexander bride doll since she was about
5. She</B>
<P><B>loved the doll, Betty, which she got for Christmas one year. When we
moved to</B>
<P><B>our new house when I was 7 (I'm now 13) the doll was put on a shelf
in my</B>
<P><B>room. It was fine there for the first couple years we lived here. But
when I</B>
<P><B>was 9, I started having nightmares about it killing me. I would wake
up</B>
<P><B>screaming and run into my parents' room. I went to bed one night as
usual, but</B>
<P><B>right before (I did this every night since the nightmares started)
went over</B>
<P><B>and would be really friendly to the doll even though I knew she couldn't
give</B>
<P><B>me nightmares. I noticed her shoes were untied. Then I climbed back
into bed</B>
<P><B>and fell asleep. I didn't have a nightmare that night. I woke up at
2 in the</B>
<P><B>morning for no reason. I turned over in my bed and saw the doll bend
down and</B>
<P><B>tie her shoes. I fell asleep again immediately after that. In the morning,
I</B>
<P><B>got up and went over to the doll. She was turned slightly and her shoes
were</B>
<P><B>tied. I got really scared and made my mom put the doll in the back
of the</B>
<P><B>closet. I haven't had any nightmares about her since. I don't know
if it was a</B>
<P><B>ghost or what but it was really weird and my younger brothers have
always been</B>
<P><B>scared of the doll too so they wouldn't do something like that. </B>

<P><B> </B>
<P><B>I've enjoyed reading these pages for a while now and having read the</B>
<P><B>stories about spheres of light has lead me to want to share my story.</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is about as close to a supernatural encounter I've had; it could</B>
<P><B>have been my imagination, or I've been told that it could have been
my</B>
<P><B>Guardian Angel.  I'd love to hear from anyone who's got any comments,</B>
<P><B>explanations or who's seen anything similar.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Anyway, here it is.  When I was about 7 I shared a room with my 5
year</B>
<P><B>old brother in a new-ish (about 10-15 years old) semi detached house</B>
<P><B>in Cleveland, England.  My parents where in the next room and they</B>
<P><B>were the only other people (or animals) living in the house.  One</B>
<P><B>night I went to bed only to awake several hours later in the dead of</B>
<P><B>night.  I was in the habit of sleeping with my head under the covers</B>
<P><B>but with my  face pointing towards the wall at the head of my bed.
</B>
<P><B>When I opened my eyes I saw a bright circle of light on the wall,</B>
<P><B>about 5 or 6 centimetres in diameter, as if someone had shone a torch</B>
<P><B>at the wall (except there was no light diffusion - it was a circle
of</B>
<P><B>light and totally dark around it).  It definitely wasn't my
brother...</B>
<P><B>Around 6 or 7 years later I saw it again.  We'd moved house 50 miles</B>
<P><B>north to Morpeth in Northumberland. I now had my own room - nobody</B>
<P><B>else was there - and the light was as before.  Both times I squeezed</B>
<P><B>my eyes shut, and when I opened them again, it had gone.  I remember</B>
<P><B>feeling a bit frightened both times, but when the morning came I</B>
<P><B>shrugged it off and after a few days I was no longer bothered about
it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I'm now nearly 29 and I've never seen the light again.</B>
<P><B>Neither of the times it appeared were especially stressful times for</B>
<P><B>me and there had been no deaths in the family at these times.

<H3><B><A NAME=pale>The Pale Woman</A></B>
</H3><P><B>BY: GAALHAZU@aol.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>     When people ask me if I believe in ghosts,  I tend to tell them
my brief</B>
<P><B>encounter with The Pale woman.  </B>
<P><B>     It happened in the winter of 1975,  I was 8 years old.  My mother
thought</B>
<P><B>it would be a good idea for me to stay home and miss school since I
had a</B>
<P><B>slight fever.  I remember that day in great detail.  The sky was a
rather</B>
<P><B>morbid looking grey and the street I lived on was unusually quiet.
 My mother</B>
<P><B>was taking care of me the whole day,  Keeping me in high spirits. 
My mother</B>
<P><B>is a devout christian.  She had in her bedroom a shelf that contained
dozens</B>
<P><B>of holy statues, Pictures and candles.  Earlier that day my mother
placed a</B>
<P><B>tambourine among the many the statues on the shelf.  Even though I
was a mere</B>
<P><B>8 years old,  I looked at that as being very odd,  The tambourine seemed
out</B>
<P><B>of place to me.  But I said nothing of it.</B>
<P><B>     As night came I was laid to sleep with my mother right by my side.
 She</B>
<P><B>turned off the lamp and attempted to fall asleep as well.  I was starting
to</B>
<P><B>fall into a deep sleep,  when a loud crash suddenly awoke me.  Without
even</B>
<P><B>looking, I knew the loud crash was the sound of the tambourine crashing
into</B>
<P><B>the floor.  My heart started pounding very heavily.  Out of instinct,
 my</B>
<P><B>mother called my name aloud.  We both sat up in the bed simultaniously,
she</B>
<P><B>turned on the lamp and That's when we saw her.  She was standing at
the foot</B>
<P><B>of the bed.  Although I looked at her for only a few seconds I was
able to</B>
<P><B>recall all of her features,  down to the most mundane of details. 
She was a</B>
<P><B>middle aged woman,  with white hair and a very pale skin tone.  She
was</B>
<P><B>soaking wet,  As if she was standing in the rain.  She had on a torn,
dirty</B>
<P><B>white gown and had tree leaves in her hair and on her gown as if she
rolled</B>
<P><B>around in dirt.  She did not say a word and she did not do anything,
 she just</B>
<P><B>stood there looking at us.  almost staring through me and my mother.
 By this</B>
<P><B>time I had already put the covers over my head and began to cry.  I
could hear</B>
<P><B>my mother pleading with this 'intruder' to leave our home.  It all
ended in a</B>
<P><B>matter of minutes.  My mother held me and told me that she was gone,
 and that</B>
<P><B>she could not hurt us.  After all the chaos I got up to get a better
grip on</B>
<P><B>things.  The tambourine was broken,  But there was no sign that the
pale woman</B>
<P><B>was in our home,  The only thing that remained was the foul odor of
wet</B>
<P><B>clothing.  I asked my mother why did the pale woman break the tambourine.
 My</B>
<P><B>mother had no answer.  To this day she has no answer.  </B>
<P><B>     This encounter is the only one I ever had with anything dealing
with the</B>
<P><B>supernatural.  Because of it,  I have trouble sleeping at night to
this day.</B>
<P><B>It has made me a virtual prisoner.  I hope never, ever to see something
like</B>
<P><B>this again.  So when people ask if I believe in ghosts,  I tell them
about the</B>
<P><B>pale woman.  In an attempt to let them know that incident was the
most</B>
<P><B>frightening thing that has ever happened to me And that non-believers
should</B>
<P><B>believe.</B>

<P>
<P><B>I live in a little town in Wisconsin near Madison.  Our house is only
15</B>
<P><B>years old and it is haunted.  Occassionally, at night, we can hear
walking</B>
<P><B>around in the attic.  My mom is a very big beleiver in the paranormal
and</B>
<P><B>spirits.  She says "oh, it's just the spirits, that's all."  -like
it's no</B>
<P><B>big deal.  But it scares the crap out of me!  Some times there are
things</B>
<P><B>that are missing in the house when just a second ago there it was right
in</B>
<P><B>front of us.</B>
<P>
<P><B>On time, when it was me and my mom, our dog started barking at nothing.
</B>
<P><B>Then she started following whatever it was around the room we were
in.  She</B>
<P><B>stopped right between my mother and i and barked furoisly at nothing.
</B>
<P><B>Then a shadow swept by us.  The dog stopped barking and layed down
and</B>
<P><B>everything went back to normal.  "Don't look so scared, it's just the</B>
<P><B>spirits," my mom replied.  I couldn't get it out of my head for
weeks.</B>

</H3><P><B>BY: name withheld by request</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>This isn't a ghost story as such, just a strange occurrence that I
remembered whilst reading</B>
<P><B> other stories.  I used to live in a flat in Walthamstow in East London
and so far nothing </B>
<P><B>strange had happened.  One day I was in the bathroom  when a picture
above the toilet fell </B>
<P><B>off the wall and landed face up on the cistern, thinking nothing of
this I re-hung the picture</B>
<P><B> and went to leave the room only to have the picture fall again.  This
time I was quite </B>
<P><B>irritated and stomped over to the toilet and re-hung the picture only
to have it literally</B>
<P><B> slide down the wall and land on the cistern. I re-hung the picture
only for it to fall again</B>
<P><B> so I just swore and gave up. (I must add that when the picture fell
for the first time, my</B>
<P><B>first thought was of the old superstition that when a picture falls
there will soon be a death</B>
<P><B> in the family).  By now I was quite spooked by the continual falling
of the picture and the </B>
<P><B>superstition and just left the picture resting on the cistern.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>A few days later my mum called me at work asking when I would be arriving
home that night and</B>
<P><B> could my boyfriend and myself stay in as she would be coming round
along with my grandparents.</B>
<P><B>  I remember being rather stunned as to my mum's abrupt conversation
and agreed to stay in for</B>
<P><B> them.  Later that evening, my mum and grand parents came round with
the news that my great-uncle</B>
<P><B> Tony had been found dead that morning in his flat - it looked like
he'd had a heart attack when</B>
<P><B> in bed.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Okay, nothing odd or spooky in that you may think, until I tell you
that in total the picture</B>
<P><B> fell four times on the morning of 30th June, and my great-uncle died
on the 4th July.</B>
<P><B>I have since moved into my Great Grandparents house in another area
of East London and</B>
<P><B> let's just say that this house has quite a ghostly history!</B>

</B>
<P><B>thought I was hallucinating, but it began to happen every night around
</B>
<P><B>one in the morning. We'd discuss different things about me, him, death
</B>
<P><B>and the usual everyday things. Two nights ago, I had a friend over
and </B>
<P><B>we were up in my room with the lights off talking. I have a mirror
next </B>
<P><B>to my bed and both my friend and I saw a bright blue light coming from
</B>
<P><B>within the mirror. I flipped the light on and we ran downstairs. Now,
</B>
<P><B>the night before this, I told my roomate about my brother coming to
see </B>
<P><B>me. He noticed the mirror and told me to put a crack in it. I took
a </B>
<P><B>hammer and cracked the lower righthand corner. That night Chris came
to </B>
<P><B>me and he looked badly decomposed. Every other time he came, he looked
</B>
<P><B>like he ususally did, but this night he was all bloody and cut up.
He </B>
<P><B>told me that I was going to die in twenty seven days. Then he left.
Now,</B>
<P><B>the next night is when my friend and I saw the blue light. My roomate
</B>
<P><B>called one of his friends and had him come over. We'll call my roomate
</B>
<P><B>Dan and his friend John. John and I went upstairs to see if anything
was</B>
<P><B>out of place. During that week, things in my room had been moved around
</B>
<P><B>and put in different places. Also, my CD player had been tampered with
</B>
<P><B>every day. The CD "Kettle Whistle" by Jane's Addiction was always in
my </B>
<P><B>player. I tested this out. I put Marilyn Manson in and the next day
when</B>
<P><B>I got home from work, Jane's Addiction was in the player. As I said
</B>
<P><B>before, we went up there to see if anything had been moved. Nothing
was </B>
<P><B>moved. John told me to remove a piece of my mirror to see what would
</B>
<P><B>happen. He happened to glance up and look across the hall to the window
</B>
<P><B>in the other bedroom. He saw a person floating at the window with red
</B>
<P><B>eyes and an angry smirk on it's face. A thing about that room: there
is </B>
<P><B>no place a person could stand and have leverage. It is also two stories
</B>
<P><B>up. We ran downstairs into Dan's room and shut the door. I was not
going</B>
<P><B>to sleep in my room, so we stayed up all night. For three hours, we
</B>
<P><B>heard footsteps in my room. My room is directly above Dan's room and
the</B>
<P><B>bathroom and all of us could hear it. We have four cats, but no cat
made</B>
<P><B>that sound. Yesterday I moved all of my things into the extra bedroom.
</B>
<P><B>Last night I was on the phone with a close friend and I saw a figure
</B>
<P><B>walk by the living room window. No one was home but Dan and I and he
was</B>
<P><B>asleep. I went into his room and told him what I saw. I guess he saw
</B>
<P><B>someone walk through his wall. At about midnight I went to bed in my
new</B>
<P><B>room. I was still awake and Chris came to talk to me again. This time
he</B>
<P><B>said ' don't trust what you see upstairs'. I noticed something that
I </B>
<P><B>hadden't noticed before. Chris had a silver pinky ring that he wore
all </B>
<P><B>the time before he died. Last night he was wearing it. All the other
</B>
<P><B>nights he wasn't. How's that for weird?? </B>

</H3><P><B>By: Marilyn</B>
<P>
<P><B>After my experiences with the haunted house on Kern's </B>
<P><B>Avenue,  I hoped to never again encounter the forces of </B>
<P><B>the supernatural.  It seems the forces though, had other </B>
<P><B>plans.</B>
<P>
<P><B>In late September 1979, I was married and now had a six </B>
<P><B>year old daughter.  We had just moved from California to </B>
<P><B>Mesa, Arizona.  We found an affordable two bedroom home.  </B>
<P><B>It was part of a four-plex.  It seemed like a nice place </B>
<P><B>for the first month that we were there.  That all changed </B>
<P><B>though just before Halloween.</B>
<P>
<P><B>It all started innocently enough.  My 24th birthday was </B>
<P><B>coming on November 10th.  My mom always likes to send me a </B>
<P><B>birthday card early.  This has always been her habit.  </B>
<P><B>That year was no exception.  I got the mail that day, and </B>
<P><B>there in it was a card from my mom.  Inside the card was a </B>
<P><B>five dollar bill.  I was pretty tickled to receive the </B>
<P><B>money, since I had been wanting a little eye shadow duo </B>
<P><B>that I had seen in the grocery store a few nights earlier.  </B>
<P><B>I decided to hop on my bike and dash on up to the store </B>
<P><B>before my daughter Dody got out of school that day.  </B>
<P><B>Before I left though, I left a note for my husband to let </B>
<P><B>him know where I was going.  Don sometimes was able to </B>
<P><B>come by the house for lunch. He was a computer service </B>
<P><B>technician, and he traveled all over the city.  If he </B>
<P><B>happened to be near the house at lunch time, he would just </B>
<P><B>drop in.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I wrote the note to Don saying that mom sent me five </B>
<P><B>dollars in a birthday card and I was going to the store.  </B>
<P><B>I sat the note on the table and drew an arrow on it which </B>
<P><B>pointed to the card.  I sat the card up with the pretty </B>
<P><B>cover showing.  This card was very pretty as it had a </B>
<P><B>birthstone set in the center of a flower on the cover.  I </B>
<P><B>sat it up to show that.  Then I left.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I got back about half an hour later.  Don wasn't there.  </B>
<P><B>But, I saw that he had been.  At least, that's what I </B>
<P><B>concluded by what I saw on the table.  The card was </B>
<P><B>flipped over and upside down.  The part of the card </B>
<P><B>visible now was the back side, with the part that </B>
<P><B>displayed the price, facing forward.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was sorry that I missed Don.  But I thought he was </B>
<P><B>really clever in letting me know he had been there by </B>
<P><B>flipping the card that way.  Finally, Don came home at the </B>
<P><B>end of his work day.  I told him that I was sorry that I </B>
<P><B>had missed him.  He didn't know what I was talking about.  </B>
<P><B>He hadn't been by the house that day at all.</B>
<P>
<P><B>That really freaked me out because I had made such a </B>
<P><B>production of setting the card up to show the birthstone.  </B>
<P><B>So, there was no room in my mind to doubt myself.  Finally </B>
<P><B>though, I told myself that I must have somehow flipped the </B>
<P><B>card over myself.  I had to tell myself this just to be </B>
<P><B>able to sleep that night.</B>
<P>
<P><B>A week went by with no other strange happenings.  Then, lo </B>
<P><B>and behold, another spooky thing occurred.  I was home </B>
<P><B>alone doing my housework.  I was washing dishes, when I </B>
<P><B>left the room.  When I got back to the </B>
<P><B>kitchen I saw a strange sight.  A drinking glass was </B>
<P><B>sitting upside down on the side of the sink.  I knew that </B>
<P><B>I hadn't left it there.  A chill ran up my spine.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Then it all became more pronounced.  I would leave a room </B>
<P><B>and come back to find an object turned upside down, on a </B>
<P><B>regular basis.  I was so frightened by it.  The worst part </B>
<P><B>was that no one wanted to believe me.  These things only </B>
<P><B>occurred to torment me it seemed.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One day though, my sister in law, Rhonda was over.  I was </B>
<P><B>telling her about some of the incidents.  We were sitting </B>
<P><B>at the kitchen table at the time and I was cooking us some </B>
<P><B>macaroni and cheese.  We also had a pot of coffee going.  </B>
<P><B>Anyway, as soon as I had finished telling her about all of </B>
<P><B>the weird things, she did a brave (or crazy) thing.  </B>
<P><B>Rhonda said aloud,"If you're here, show yourself."  At the </B>
<P><B>instant the words were gone from her mouth, the </B>
<P><B>electricity died!!!!  The macaroni stopped cooking, and </B>
<P><B>the Mr. Coffee shut off.  We both ran outside.  We ran to </B>
<P><B>the back of the four-plex to where the breaker box was.  </B>
<P><B>We looked inside the box, but no breakers were tripped </B>
<P><B>off.  I need to say also that no one was around outside </B>
<P><B>that day but us.  We finally called the electric company </B>
<P><B>to send out a repair man.  When he arrived, he quickly </B>
<P><B>found the problem and fixed it.  We asked him what the </B>
<P><B>problem had been. He told us that a pertinent part was </B>
<P><B>missing from the breaker box, and he just replaced it.  </B>
<P><B>That really spooked Rhonda and me.  We had gone straight </B>
<P><B>outside when the electricity failed.  No one had been </B>
<P><B>outside.  Even if a human had done it, what were the odds </B>
<P><B>of it occurring just when Rhonda had asked the presence to </B>
<P><B>show itself. After this incident, I was really scared.  At </B>
<P><B>first, the entity seemed almost playful.  Turning objects </B>
<P><B>upside down seems quite harmless.  Playing games with the </B>
<P><B>breaker box seemed powerful, cunning, and sinister.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One rainy morning after Dody left for school, I decided to </B>
<P><B>go back to bed for awhile.  Don had gone to work early </B>
<P><B>that morning.  I wasn't too surprised though when I heard </B>
<P><B>him coming up the sidewalk with his keys jangling.  I </B>
<P><B>heard him open the front door, and come into the </B>
<P><B>apartment.  I decided to keep the covers over my head.  I </B>
<P><B>was pretending to be asleep.  I was going to wait until he </B>
<P><B>came into the room to greet him.  Silly, I know.  I heard </B>
<P><B>him come into the room.  He was standing by the bed.  I </B>
<P><B>could hear him breathing.  But he never spoke.  Finally, I </B>
<P><B>whipped the covers off my head and yelled, "BOO!."  No one </B>
<P><B>was there!!!!  Then, as I was about to jump up out of the </B>
<P><B>bed something pushed me back down.  I was screaming and </B>
<P><B>crying by now for this thing to go away and leave me </B>
<P><B>alone.  It just pushed harder on my chest, pushing my body </B>
<P><B>deeper down into the waterbed mattress.  I felt such awful </B>
<P><B>pressure.  I couldn't breathe.  I really and truly thought </B>
<P><B>that I was going to die.  Just when I thought that I </B>
<P><B>couldn't take anymore pressure and live--it stopped!  Just </B>
<P><B>as quickly as it had all happened, it was over.  I got </B>
<P><B>some clothes on and drove myself over to my mother in laws </B>
<P><B>house for the day.  I was not going to stay alone in that </B>
<P><B>house!  Not that day, anyway.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Soon after this experience, I got a job that would keep me </B>
<P><B>away from the house during the day.  I worked from 6 a.m. </B>
<P><B>to 2 p.m.  That was perfect for me because Dody got out of </B>
<P><B>school at 3 p.m.  So, I would hardly ever be alone in the </B>
<P><B>house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I had begun to have awful nightmares of dismembered </B>
<P><B>bodies.  I dreamt that our house was on a patch of land </B>
<P><B>that had been used as an Indian burial ground.  I never </B>
<P><B>did any research of the land, so I don't know if the </B>
<P><B>dreams had any basis in fact. The nightmares were just so </B>
<P><B>dark and gruesome. I began to dread going to sleep.</B>
<P>
<P><B>After I got the job, I was rarely alone in the house.  I </B>
<P><B>liked that just fine.  One day though, the presence still </B>
<P><B>managed to give me a spook.  I had just picked Dody up </B>
<P><B>from school.  We were going over to Don's mom's house, but </B>
<P><B>Dody wanted to change her clothes first.  We stopped by </B>
<P><B>our house.  I went to the bathroom while Dody changed in  </B>
<P><B>her bedroom.  As I was washing my hands in the bathroom, I </B>
<P><B>decided to move a little plaque off of the bathroom shelf </B>
<P><B>and put it away.  The plaque read, "All that I like is </B>
<P><B>either immoral, illegal, or fattening."  For some reason </B>
<P><B>that day, the plaque made me feel disgusted.  I hated it's </B>
<P><B>message.  So, I took it off the shelf and put it in the </B>
<P><B>cabinet under the bathroom sink.  I noticed that the shelf </B>
<P><B>needed to be dusted as there was a clean line where the </B>
<P><B>plaque had rested.  I decided to leave the dusting until I </B>
<P><B>returned from my mother in law's house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Dody and I finally returned home.  I was glad that I had </B>
<P><B>made it home before Don because I was going to fix up a </B>
<P><B>nice dinner to surprise him.  I remembered though that I </B>
<P><B>wanted to dust the bathroom shelf.  I went into the </B>
<P><B>bathroom.  I stood frozen in shock at what I saw.  </B>
<P><B>There sat the plaque exactly where it had been </B>
<P><B>before I had moved it and put it away!!!  It had even been </B>
<P><B>set meticulously back the way it had been--sitting </B>
<P><B>perfectly in the line with all the dust surrounding it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I rushed Dody back to the car and drove straight to a </B>
<P><B>phone.  I called my mother in law and she sent my brother </B>
<P><B>in law over to stay with us until Don came home.  It </B>
<P><B>didn't really help that much to have someone else there.  </B>
<P><B>I was so terrified of this house.  To know that something </B>
<P><B>was watching me even in the bathroom was just way too </B>
<P><B>weird.</B>
<P>
<P><B>That May we finally got our tax refund and we used the </B>
<P><B>money to move. We moved away from Mesa and got an </B>
<P><B>apartment in Phoenix. Luckily, the entity didn't follow us </B>
<P><B>there to our new home.</B>
<P>
<P><B>To this day though, if ever I see something turned upside </B>
<P><B>down, it unnerves me.  I'm always afraid that the terror </B>
<P><B>will begin again.</B>

<P><B>Chestnut Grove Cemetary...If that dosen't sound creepy, I don't know</B>
<P><B>what does.  I got curious one day, and decided to go to an old, old</B>
<P><B>cemetary.  Curiousity killed the cat you say?  Well, fortunatly, I
am</B>
<P><B>not the cat.  I lived to tell my story.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	My step mother and I decided to check out an old party spot.  Her</B>
<P><B>friends used to go there when they felt like a little scare.  They
came</B>
<P><B>running back telling all sorts of crazy stories.  I guess she was to</B>
<P><B>scared to see for herself.  Years later, (she graduated from high</B>
<P><B>school), she told me about this cemetary in the valley.  Fearless me,</B>
<P><B>had to investigate.  I don't believe anything unless I see it with
my</B>
<P><B>own two eyes.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>	As we strolled to the back of the cemetary, looking at any random</B>
<P><B>epitaph, we saw 1800's to the 1990's.  She stopped, I stopped.  "Do
you</B>
<P><B>hear that?"  she asked.  "Yeah, I hear that..."  I said.  I heard it</B>
<P><B>with my own ears, in broad daylight.  What other than organ music.

</H3><P><B>BY: johnboy@bright.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have a few encounters I would like to share with you.</B>
<P><B>In 1965 my grandparents bought a house that was built in 1850.</B>
<P><B>At one time this house was involved in the underground railroad (I
know</B>
<P><B>this</B>
<P><B>because there is a published book with my house in it.).I know that
they</B>
<P><B>were a few deaths in this house.</B>
<P><B>As far as we can tell there were only four owners, by grandparent
were</B>
<P><B>the last.(until 10yrs ago when they sold it.)</B>
<P><B>I should tell you that it was also built on and Indian burial ground.</B>
<P><B>I'll tell you one of my dad's stories first....</B>
<P><B>When my mom and dad were dating my mom would come over and play cards</B>
<P><B>frequently.</B>
<P><B>On one such occasion my dad went upstairs to use the bathroom(there
were</B>
<P><B>2 doors into the bathroom) while he was in there he heard the little</B>
<P><B>bathroom door shaking(and saw it)</B>
<P><B>so he was scared and decided to get out of there, by the time he got
to</B>
<P><B>the other door the little door flew open(I should add that this door
was</B>
<P><B>incredibly hard to open).My dad flew down stairs and saw that
everyone</B>
<P><B>was still in the kitchen!</B>
<P><B> On a regular basis the rooms would get cold and you would smell
lilac</B>
<P><B>perfume, they always said Agnes is here.</B>
<P><B>My uncle was awakened one night by his bed shaking violently and</B>
<P><B>something was breathing heavily in his ear.</B>
<P><B>I understand that my aunt was walking past one bedroom(later to be
my</B>
<P><B>sisters and mine) and heard a baby crying, they didn't have any
babies</B>
<P><B>at that time.</B>
<P><B>For as long as I can remember we were afraid to go upstairs alone.</B>
<P><B>I don't know any thing in particular that happened to my twin sis,
but</B>
<P><B>my oldest had an encounter twice...</B>
<P><B>Once she was told to go into the living room and on her way through
the</B>
<P><B>dining room a lady stopped her and wouldn't let her go in.</B>
<P><B>Another time she was holding a ball and something took it out of her</B>
<P><B>hands.</B>
<P><B>I had two encounters, there was a double bed and single bed in our</B>
<P><B>room(the 3 of us shared) my sisters were mean to me, they wouldn't
let</B>
<P><B>me sleep with them in the big bed so I had to sleep over in the other</B>
<P><B>bed, on night I saw something outside the window, I think it was a
man,</B>
<P><B>I'm not sure. I was terrified!</B>
<P><B>Another time I was home alone(I'm not sure why?) and the door to the</B>
<P><B>stairs opened, these door had very old latches on them, you had to
lift</B>
<P><B>the lever to get them open. I saw the lever lift and the door was
pushed</B>
<P><B>open!</B>
<P><B>I never stayed home alone again.</B>
<P><B>Once a plate flew out of the dish drain while my grandpa was in the</B>
<P><B>kitchen.</B>
<P><B>When my grandparents moved a glass candy jar flew off the
refrigerator.</B>
<P><B>The house is empty now, which is a shame because it was a lovely big</B>
<P><B>house.</B>
<P><B>Its located in Westerville Ohio If anyone lives in the area I would
be</B>
<P><B>happy to tell them the address so they can check it out!</B>
<P><B>thanks,</B>

</H3><P><B>By:   nanej@webtv.net </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Since i was very little  I have always had strange things happen that
i</B>
<P><B>could never understand .   I would see and hear things that terrified
me</B>
<P><B>but would never mention to  anyone until i got to my teen years. 
 Then</B>
<P><B>my sisters would start mentioning things to me that they had</B>
<P><B>experienced.   The first  thing that i had seen  was in cincinnati,</B>
<P><B>ohio.  We lived in a old and big green house on henshaw ,  us kids
slept</B>
<P><B>upstairs where there were three large bedrooms .   Plus there was a
door</B>
<P><B>that led to the attic.   I never heard voices until I started in my</B>
<P><B>teens but I saw things.   Like I was downstairs getting ready to go
up</B>
<P><B>stairs to play, when I opened the door and  there at the top of the</B>
<P><B>stairs stood a dark figure of a man.. he was looking down at me I
know</B>
<P><B>that even if he had no eyes .   He was just black solid black.   So
i</B>
<P><B>quickly shut the door and stayed downstairs until my sisters went up
to</B>
<P><B>play , thats when i would go up.   It happened again one day, but
this</B>
<P><B>time the figure was looking over the banister at me.   that was the
last</B>
<P><B>time i saw it until many years later.   But he had big glowing eyes
and</B>
<P><B>he asked me a question about a aunt of mine .   just a semple
question.</B>
<P><B>But there was no importance of the question.  but I was living in</B>
<P><B>Midland , ohio  then.   I had many  things happen since.   I've had
a</B>
<P><B>ghost whistle in my ear.   I never told my sister whom I was living
with</B>
<P><B>at the time because she was nine months pregnant at the time.  because
i</B>
<P><B>didn't want to upset her.   But it happened to her a couple weeks
later</B>
<P><B>and she freaked out.   This place was a apt.   in Wilmngton, ohio.
 I</B>
<P><B>slept upstairs by myself and she and her husband  slept downstairs.</B>
<P><B>There was only one bathroom and it was across the hall from my room.</B>
<P><B>And that is where we heard the flirty type whistle in our ears.   We</B>
<P><B>both mentioned it to each other and when she told me I told her that
it</B>
<P><B>happened to me too but I didn't want her to know.   She could never
go</B>
<P><B>upstairs by herself again.   There was only one other bedroom
upstairs</B>
<P><B>but we could never get ourselves to using it.  because it was always
so</B>
<P><B>ice cold in there even in the summer.  We didn't even put  any
furniture</B>
<P><B>, boxes or anything in there.               There has been many
things</B>
<P><B>that I had seen and heard.  But the very recent  one was when my
father-</B>
<P><B>in-law died.   My husband came home early from work and told me that
 his</B>
<P><B>dad died.   Shortly after he went back to work,  I was writing out
a</B>
<P><B>shopping list of things I needed  in order for us to go to Chattanooga
for</B>
<P><B>the furneral.   When suddenly I  was scared by his voice.   I didn't
know</B>
<P><B>what he said because it happened so fast and it was like he was in
a</B>
<P><B>tunnel.    </B>

<P><B>family home but was converted to a two unit in 1955.</B>
<P><B>We moved into the house in 1992, after it was empty for many </B>
<P><B>years.; Immediately, we began to notice some very strange things happening
</B>
<P><B>around us. Every morning at approximately 4:30 a.m., we could hear
what </B>
<P><B>sounded like a radio talk show coming from what was the kitchen downstairs
and </B>
<P><B>could faintly hear someone shuffling around but when we would get up
to </B>
<P><B>investigate, we could find nothing. It was obvious that whoever this
was </B>
<P><B>was a male getting up every morning to go to work, as far as we could
</B>
<P><B>tell. And.....this person did...and does not....care for my husband!
</B>
<P><B>My husband takes great pride in his tools and had set up a small workshop
in one </B>
<P><B>of the old bedrooms. Obviously, this did not please this old man, because
</B>
<P><B>he would toss the tools around, and they usually ended up on the floor.
</B>
<P><B>And now, we find, his tools are ending up missing. However, I do believe
</B>
<P><B>that he likes ME. I had an old wringer washer in the basement that
I loved </B>
<P><B>very much and it was acting up. I jokingly remarked to the ghost to
please </B>
<P><B>fix my washer ---- and he did!!!! My refrigerator door needed some
</B>
<P><B>adjustments and my husband, the great procrastinator, could never find
time to </B>
<P><B>fix it. All I had to do was ask the ghost, and my door was fixed. My
</B>
<P><B>husband and I had a huge fight one day, as most couples do, but evidently
the </B>
<P><B>ghost thought he was going to harm me because he grabbed my </B>
<P><B>husband.We have a shower in the basement and when you go down, you
can </B>
<P><B>smell very faintly roses, like a cream cachet and sometimes you can
smell </B>
<P><B>something baking, mostly brownies or some type of chocolate cookie,
so we know </B>
<P><B>that a woman is also here.Upstairs in what used to be a nursery, there
is a little </B>
<P><B>boy. He plays with my dog and cat but I also think that there is a
man who </B>
<P><B>is in there, too.My three year old granddaughter entered the room because
</B>
<P><B>she thought my husband was there, but when she went in she said,
&amp;quot;You're not </B>
<P><B>grandpa and left. When we asked who she was talking to, she said </B>
<P><B>&amp;quot;The man in there, he's not grandpa. She is afraid to go into
</B>
<P><B>my kitchen because she says there are ghosts.Things are continuosly
missing or moved.&amp;nbsp; They even took </B>
<P><B>my dentures!!! I still can find them.; Thank God, I have </B>
<P><B>dental insurance.These are just a few of the things that happen at
my </B>
<P><B>house.; They don't harm us but do things that are irritating, like
move and </B>
<P><B>misplace things.</B>

<P><B>I was a freshman at MHC in the fall of </B>
<P><B>1989. All freshman live in the same dormitory. Enda Corpening </B>
<P><B>Moore. Coming in as a scholar, I was sent to the fourth floor where
all of </B>
<P><B>the scholars were to live for their first year. I was on the short
end of </B>
<P><B>the hallway where there are only 5 rooms. Luckily, I was not right
next to </B>
<P><B>the stairwell, but one room down from it. Over one of our breaks, everyone
</B>
<P><B>in our dorm had gone home, away, fishing or something. My friend and
I </B>
<P><B>decided to stay on campus. We were THE only ones in the dorm that long
</B>
<P><B>weekend. The first night alone, we drank a few beers and watched some
</B>
<P><B>TV. As we grew weary, we went off to our own rooms. We lived in </B>
<P><B>rooms diagonal from each other.About an hour or so after retiring,
I </B>
<P><B>heard heavy footsteps across my ceiling, coming from the attic. I heard
</B>
<P><B>them open the door and stomp down the stairs. I went to my door, intending
</B>
<P><B>to race across the hall to Meg's room. I opened the door. Meg stood
</B>
<P><B>in her doorway. She had heard the same noises. We just stood there
</B>
<P><B>and stared at each other. We looked down. At each of our feet, there
</B>
<P><B>were blood stains on the carpet. Only in front of each of our </B>
<P><B>doorways. Not drops all the way down the hall. I slammed my door </B>
<P><B>&amp;amp; locked.I remained awake until sunrise several hours later,
but </B>
<P><B>never heard anything more from our late night visitor. We never told
our </B>
<P><B>suitemates about the experience.</B>
<P><B>The story goes that a young girl got pregnant </B>
<P><B>and was dragging herself up to the attic after giving herself an
abortion.</B>
<P><B>Supposedly, she is coming down to warn young girls not to let it happen
to </B>
<P><B>them. Another story says that the ghost is actually Edna Moore, whose
</B>
<P><B>father killed her when he found out she was pregnant. He dragged her
</B>
<P><B>corpse to the attic. She periodically comes back down to look for her
</B>
<P><B>father.</B>
<P><B>I don't know who it was they scared the hell out </B>
<P><B>of me that night, but I know I will never forget it.</B>
<P><B>You may post this story on your </B>
<P><B>site.</B>

<P><B>This story is not as facsinating as some of the others I have </B>
<P><B>read, but to me... I'll never forget it. I guess in many ways, I am
very </B>
<P><B>lucky, my experience was not scarey... just kind of an expreience.</B>
<P><B>I was 9 years old, and staying over at my best friends Julie's </B>
<P><B>place. We were sleeping downstairs on the hide-away, watching the movie
</B>
<P><B>Ice Castles. Nothing strange, just being girls. I can remember, like
</B>
<P><B>it was yesterday. I was on the left side of the bed, facing into the
</B>
<P><B>kitchen. I can remember being wakened late in the night (early am)
by </B>
<P><B>what, I am not sure. All that I heard was something
saying...&amp;quot;Hello, </B>
<P><B>can you hear me? Hello? Hello? are you awake? Can you </B>
<P><B>hear me?His(it was definitely a man) voice was SO </B>
<P><B>clear, tt was as if he was leaning over me, 'trying' to wake me </B>
<P><B>up....Everyone one the house was asleep, except for me of course (figures!)
</B>
<P><B>Well, being 9 years old, I did the only thing that I could think of....
I yanked </B>
<P><B>the covers up over my head! The next morning, I told Julie what had
</B>
<P><B>happened, and she told me that she had had some strange experiences
in that </B>
<P><B>place too!  It wasn't so much that it was scary, just....different.
</B>
<P><B>Well, Julie moved away within a year. I never heard from him</B>
<P><B>again, but I can promise that I will always remember him.</B>
