<b>My Grandma</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: mhigbe@hotmail.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>My maternal grandma and I were not very close.&nbsp; She was difficult
to get</b>
<br><b>along with, she told crude jokes, and she chainsmoked like a fiend,</b>
<br><b>resulting in her eventual death from emphysema in December of 1995.&nbsp;
My mom</b>
<br><b>had been out in Florida taking care of her, and I was in Texas taking
final</b>
<br><b>exams for my first semester in college.&nbsp; I was studying at
my boyfriend's</b>
<br><b>house that night.&nbsp; I called my mom to see how Grandma was doing,
and she</b>
<br><b>said, "I'll call you right back."</b>
<br><b>She called back about 5 minutes later and told me Grandma had died.&nbsp;
Even</b>
<br><b>though we wern't close, I was overcome with emotion and started
crying.</b>
<br><b>Finally, I fell asleep.</b>
<br><b>The next morning, I grabbed one of my boyfriend's sweaters from
his</b>
<br><b>mothball-filled closet.&nbsp; As I pulled it over my head, I noticed
that, for a</b>
<br><b>change, it DIDN'T smell like mothballs- in fact, it smelled really
good.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>sniffed it again, and to my shock, my grandma's perfume - Chanel
No. 5- was</b>
<br><b>on it!&nbsp; And I knew it couldn't have been my perfume that was
on it- being a</b>
<br><b>poor college student, I was doing well to afford shampoo!&nbsp;
And the sweater</b>
<br><b>had just come out of mothball-filled storage.</b>

<p><b>My Story</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: CyberMeg03@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is my own personal ghost story.&nbsp; This
happened when I was about 12</b>
<br><b>yrs old so keep in mind that 12 yrs have passed, but as long as
I live, I</b>
<br><b>will never forget the details.&nbsp; Here goes:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was spending the night with a good friend of
mine, in a house that was</b>
<br><b>extremely haunted.&nbsp; Stephanie lived in one of these houses
that just seemed</b>
<br><b>to be an epicenter for paranormal activity.&nbsp; Her aunt walked
the basement</b>
<br><b>steps, an unknown spirit lived in the attic, and there was a tree
out back</b>
<br><b>that just looking at it scared me to death.&nbsp; I am really not
entirely sure</b>
<br><b>why the tree scared me so much, but it rocked me to the bone.&nbsp;
It was large</b>
<br><b>and had an ominous presence.&nbsp; Stephanie called it the "witch
tree," but</b>
<br><b>really had no actual reason for doing so.&nbsp; But nevertheless,
the tree is not</b>
<br><b>my focus in this story; it just gives a little background information.&nbsp;
We</b>
<br><b>went to sleep that night, and about 2:00am, I woke up with a start.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>thought it was just because Steph and I had talked about ghost stories
until</b>
<br><b>we fell asleep, but then I had the feeling that I was being watched.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>looked up and saw this large pair of blue eyes hovering over me.&nbsp;
I know this</b>
<br><b>sounds silly, but I am dead serious.&nbsp; They just kept watching
me.&nbsp; Maybe</b>
<br><b>watching me is not the right word.&nbsp; The kept glaring at me
and all I could</b>
<br><b>sense was EVIL.&nbsp; I felt so cold and I couldn't wake Stephanie
up.&nbsp; I thought</b>
<br><b>I might have been dreaming so I closed my eyes and laid there, but
I looked</b>
<br><b>up every few minutes and the eyes were still there.&nbsp; I had
no clue what to do</b>
<br><b>to make them go away, so I just started praying to God (something
I saw in a</b>
<br><b>movie), and never opened my eyes that night again.&nbsp; I woke
up in the morning</b>
<br><b>and told Stephanie about them.&nbsp; She had never seen them before,
but didn't</b>
<br><b>doubt me.&nbsp; She of all people knew the history of her house.&nbsp;
I went on with</b>
<br><b>life as normal, forgetting about the eyes until about 2 months later,</b>
<br><b>Stephanie came to me and said she talked with her little brother,
Aaron, who</b>
<br><b>was 8.&nbsp; She said she didn't even mention the eyes to him, but
one night they</b>
<br><b>were talking about the house and he asked her if she had ever seen
a large</b>
<br><b>pair of blue eyes.&nbsp; She stopped dead in her tracks.&nbsp; Aaron
said that to him</b>
<br><b>the eyes were friendly and never glared at him.&nbsp; We just figured
out that</b>
<br><b>they saw me as a stranger and focused evil on me.&nbsp; I will never
know for</b>
<br><b>certain.&nbsp; All I know is that I never stayed in that house again.</b>
<br><b>In addition to that story, my sister and I were out driving about
9 months</b>
<br><b>ago.&nbsp; I was about 11:00pm and we passed by Stephanie's old
house.&nbsp; She no</b>
<br><b>longer lived there, but I am pretty sure that her father still did.&nbsp;
I turned</b>
<br><b>to Lauren, my sister, and said "look La, there is that creepy house."&nbsp;
Now,</b>
<br><b>this next part will sound so bizarre, but I swear it is true.&nbsp;
All of the</b>
<br><b>sudden, a light shot up from the house, which was completely dark,
and 2</b>
<br><b>other lights shot up from the other side of the road.&nbsp; We thought
they might</b>
<br><b>just be electrical charges.&nbsp; That was, of course, until they
started chasing</b>
<br><b>the car.&nbsp; We had to get a mail down the road until they disappeared.&nbsp;
Do you</b>
<br><b>have any idea what those lights might have been?</b>
<br><b>Thank you for listening to my stories.</b>

<p><b>My Uncle Wayne</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: angelac@networkonecom.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Back in 1996 my uncle Wayne passed away in a tragic auto accident
on the</b>
<br><b>interstate near Neenah, Wisconsin (between Appleton and Oshkosh).&nbsp;
He had</b>
<br><b>been pulling a load of sod with a small pick-up truck that he borrowed
from</b>
<br><b>a co-worker.&nbsp; The truck must have been too small to carry the
load because</b>
<br><b>the truck flip killing my uncle instantly.&nbsp; Needless to say,
my father flew</b>
<br><b>out to Wisconsin from our home in Pensacola, Florida to attend the
funeral</b>
<br><b>of his youngest brother (my father is the oldest of seven children).&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>story I am about to tell comes from the mouth of my father.&nbsp;
The afternoon</b>
<br><b>before the day of the funeral, my father took his mother and father
to the</b>
<br><b>funeral parlor to finalize the arrangements.&nbsp; On the way back
to my</b>
<br><b>grandparents' home, my grandmother noticed that her family ring
was missing</b>
<br><b>a stone.&nbsp; The stone that was missing was my uncle Wayne's birthstone!&nbsp;
They</b>
<br><b>looked everywhere for the stone and could not find it.&nbsp; Everyone
kept saying</b>
<br><b>it was Wayne's way of saying a final good-bye to his mother.&nbsp;
The next day</b>
<br><b>(the day of the funeral) everyone left my grandparents' house to
go to the</b>
<br><b>funeral except my uncle Stan.&nbsp; Stan stayed behind to wait for
a cousin that</b>
<br><b>was running late.&nbsp; A few minutes later, Stan heard a car pull
into the</b>
<br><b>driveway.&nbsp; At the bottom of the driveway was a car that looked
exactly like</b>
<br><b>Wayne's (a green spit fire)...my uncle Stan thought how strange
it was that</b>
<br><b>their cousin had a car exactly like Wayne's (his car was still parked</b>
<br><b>outside his old apartment at the time).&nbsp; He looked out the
window again and</b>
<br><b>saw a man sitting in the driver's seat with a beard (my uncle Wayne
had a</b>
<br><b>beard when he died).&nbsp; My uncle Stan opened the door to walk
outside thinking</b>
<br><b>it was their cousin (who also has a beard).&nbsp; When he opened
the door the car</b>
<br><b>reversed out of the driveway and quickly drove away.&nbsp; A few
minutes later</b>
<br><b>their cousin pulled up in a totally different car.&nbsp; My uncle
Stan was so</b>
<br><b>shocked that he told everyone at the funeral what had happened.&nbsp;
Since this</b>
<br><b>time, no one else has been visited by my uncle Wayne.</b>

<p><b>Haunting</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: blackmoon8@webtv.net</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>WE , my husband and I , were sitting home one night and all of a
sudden</b>

heard it get</b>
<br><b>louder then the dogs started barking like someone was there so Kevin</b>
<br><b>went upstairs to check it out nobody was there . the doors were

of just</b>
<br><b>heard someone outside because we live on a busy road .&nbsp; A few
minutes</b>
<br><b>went by and nothing , then the noise came back but much louder and</b>
<br><b>harder the dogs were going crazy then my husband looked at our doorknob</b>
<br><b>and it was shaking hard like someone was trying to get in so we
got</b>
<br><b>scared climbed out our bedroom window and left for an hour when

<p><b>Dressed in Pink</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: lorinda@azstarnet.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>A year ago we bought an old Victorian house. The family matriarch
had</b>
<br><b>refused to let it be sold, although it was in a dismal condition.
When</b>
<br><b>she passed away, the family decided to sell, although it had been
with</b>
<br><b>them for 80 years.</b>
<br><b>We began the serious process of renovation, but I was disturbed
by the</b>
<br><b>obvious presence of an old woman, dressed in pink, always in the
same</b>
<br><b>place, in the same room. I naturally assumed it was the family</b>
<br><b>matriarch, Sophia. She was so unhappy and seemed displeased at the</b>
<br><b>disturbance we were causing. So I called in a pyschic friend of
mine to</b>
<br><b>help her move along. The psychic rang bells, chanted, burned</b>
<br><b>(something), and we put lit candles in all the doorways and windows.
The</b>
<br><b>very next day it appeared that Sophia&nbsp; had gracefully moved
on.</b>
<br><b>A year passed. We finished the renovation and were preparing to
throw an</b>
<br><b>open house party. The day before the party a woman came into the
house</b>
<br><b>and announced that she had grown up there. She said she had been
coming</b>
<br><b>by to check on our progress, but had always been too shy to come
in.</b>
<br><b>Something had drawn her courage up to come in on that day. We were
very</b>
<br><b>pleased and immediately invited her and all her family to come to
the</b>
<br><b>open house the very next day.</b>
<br><b>They all came. At one point, I couldn't resist, and I asked this
woman</b>
<br><b>if there had ever been ghosts in the house. "Oh yes!" she replied,
"my</b>
<br><b>great grandmother was so persistent, we had to call in a priest
to</b>
<br><b>exorcise her."</b>
<br><b>Feeling confident, I then told her about Sophia. The woman began
to</b>
<br><b>tremble and cry. She said that her mother, Sophia, had ALWAYS worn
pink,</b>
<br><b>and the room and place I described would have been between the beds
in</b>
<br><b>the children's room.</b>
<br><b>Rest in Peace, Sophia.</b>

<p><b>Real Haunted House</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: captainjinx@juno.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>i'm from the southern Calif. area so heres how it goes,I was born
in the Los Angeles</b>
<br><b>area but my parents bought a brand new home in the Orange County
area,the</b>
<br><b>city of La Palma to be exact,the house was located on some ranch
of some</b>
<br><b>sort because our backyard faced a very very large open but fenced
field</b>
<br><b>with some cattle roaming around in it,mind you these are track homes
as</b>
<br><b>we know it today and at the time it seemed like we were living in
the</b>
<br><b>boon dogs,I mean looking back at it now it was rather a very lonely
area</b>
<br><b>but it had all these new track homes,you know one supermarket,one</b>
<br><b>library,one hospital,fire station and police station,you get the
idea.but</b>
<br><b>funny thing was that were only four blocks west of Knotts Berry
Farm,</b>
<br><b>that is if you stand at the main enterance,and as you get closer
to park</b>
<br><b>area the city was more developed,you know like hotels, MovieLand
Wax</b>
<br><b>Museum and so forth.so i guess on the other side of the city was
less</b>
<br><b>developed.not knowing who or what was on the land previously.but
back to</b>
<br><b>the haunting at hand,well the house was well built new</b>
<br><b>carpet,plumbing,the whole works with upgrades.but on some occasions
I was</b>
<br><b>very scared downstairs in the family room and in my own bedroom,I
mean my</b>
<br><b>room looked like a toy room display so there was no reason for me
to</b>
<br><b>scared just out of the blue,I mean was playing in my room and it
seemed</b>
<br><b>as if "evil" walked in the room. I got this incredible feeling of
hate</b>
<br><b>towards me as if I shouldn't have been there.this happened to me
several</b>
<br><b>times in the house and at 7 years of age I didn't know nothing about
the</b>
<br><b>paranormal or supernatural activity.another occasion was during
a</b>
<br><b>saturday afternoon my mother and I were upstairs and suddenly we
heard</b>
<br><b>this slamming and crashing noise and as we came down stairs we saw
in the</b>
<br><b>living room my moms favorite painting totaled on the floor,it looked
as</b>
<br><b>if someone broke it in anger I mean the frame was just trashed and
the</b>
<br><b>small pictures around the one that got totaled were perfectly hanging</b>
<br><b>straight. the ghost made itself see again in the late afternoon,this
time</b>
<br><b>my mom was doing some house cleaning and as she turned to one side
she</b>
<br><b>looked up towards the stairs she saw a man wearing a white-cream
colored</b>
<br><b>suit in pristine condition except he didn't have a head,no hollywood
gore</b>
<br><b>or anything like that,I saw the same thing myself,this time I saw
him at</b>
<br><b>night at the end of the hallway, this was VERY REAL and very scary!</b>
<br><b>another time as would sleep at night the beds were occasionally
kicked</b>
<br><b>very hard,also in the master bedroom the sliding glass mirror doors
were</b>
<br><b>slaming back and fourth and the dresser draws were also slaming
in and</b>
<br><b>out as well. all these things happen separately from each other
on</b>
<br><b>different ocassions. the main blvd. is La Palma Ave. and street
of the</b>
<br><b>house is Comstock Circle,and it is the second house on the left,
its a</b>
<br><b>two story house. my parents were the original owners we lived there
from</b>
<br><b>1970 to 1975. well Dave if you know of any experts on the paranormal
on</b>
<br><b>the west coast here please pass this information because after all
this</b>
<br><b>time I would like to just how haunted this place was and whats the
back</b>
<br><b>ground on this place. again the first two story house on the left
hand</b>
<br><b>side as you enter Comstock Circle is the house,and also friends
of the</b>
<br><b>neighborhood also have there strange storys to tell as well.</b>

<p><b>Real Life</b>
<p><b>By: SBullard@sjp.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I was asleep one night in my apartment in Little Rock, Arkansas,
and the</b>
<br><b>phone rang.&nbsp; I didn't answer and, when the machine came on,
I looked up as</b>
<br><b>the person on the other end started talking;&nbsp; to my surprise,
and tremendous</b>
<br><b>horror, there was a man standing over my bed, glaring down at me.&nbsp;
I could</b>
<br><b>tell by the way he was looking at me that he was an evil sprit,
who must</b>
<br><b>have died a horrible death.&nbsp; He was dressed in old time, Little
House on the</b>
<br><b>Prairie looking clothes, with the wide brimmed hat and everything;
he had</b>
<br><b>long, curly, brown hair and a beard.</b>
<p><b>I was paralyzed with fear, and the only thing I could think of doing
was</b>
<br><b>covering my head with my covers and start screaming at the top of
my lungs.</b>
<br><b>I looked up from the covers and, there he stood, not moving, staring
at me</b>
<br><b>as if he were trying to give me a warning.&nbsp; I covered my head
again, looked</b>
<br><b>up again, and he was still there.&nbsp; The next time I raised my
head, he was</b>
<br><b>gone. I never saw him again.</b>
<p><b>To this day, I have never witnessed anything more frightening in
my life</b>
