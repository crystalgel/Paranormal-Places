Indiana... Merrilville's reeder road.<br>
<br>
By: pardonek@insightbb.com <br>
<br>
<br>
Im a native of Hammond, which is very close to Merrilville.&nbsp; I
have been to reeder road many times, and actually know a different
story of the road.&nbsp; The ones i saw on your sight are new to
me.&nbsp; My parents told me this story long ago, and although i have
not expierienced it for myself, i know others who claim they
have.&nbsp; This may be more of a local story, but who knows, its still
something id like to share.<br>
Back in the 1950s the road was often used by teens and young adults as
a private make out place.&nbsp; The story goes that a young lady, and
her boyfriend made a stop at the road.&nbsp; While they were parked
there they heard a thumping on top of the car...&nbsp; They ignored it
for a bit, but the girl started to become creeped out as the noise grew
louder.&nbsp; The boyfriend decided he would get out and
investigate.&nbsp; When he got out the thumping stopped.&nbsp; After
several minutes the boyfriend had not yet returned, and the thumping
started again.&nbsp; The girl paniced and got out of the car.&nbsp;
When she got out, she found her boyfriend bloody and hung from a tree,
and the thumping she was hearing, was the sound of her boyfriends feet
hitting the top of the car as he hung there dead.&nbsp; Supposedly on
warm summer nights if you pull off onto the road and park for a bit you
will hear the thumping, and if you get out to investigate the thumping
will stop and you will find a lettermans jacket hanging from the tree
above you.<br>
There is also an abandoned school out in cedar lake, where Hammond
Baptist used to attend.&nbsp; The story goes that the pastor went crazy
and killed some of the children there.&nbsp; I personally have
expierienced strange happenings in the school, such as childrens
voices, windows that were shut on the way in open as we walked back
out... supposedly its supposed to be the children trying to
escape.&nbsp; From what I understand, a few years ago part of the
building caught fire inexplicably.&nbsp; I have not been there in about
5 years.&nbsp; However if you would like some directions to the place,
its a little tricky to get to, and i would be happy to share them with
you if you are interested.<br>
Like i said, this is a story passed on to me by my parents, and others
i know also know the story and claim the have witnessed it.&nbsp; I
also know of satanic gatherings in the field down the trail in the
woods.&nbsp; Usually occuring during the 2 equinox's every year, this
may explain some of the animal parts found.&nbsp; Also in this field, i
have seen glowing orbs here and there, but never thought much of them
since they were far out in the field, but you may be able to look into
this more than i can.&nbsp; Anyhow, i hope you enjoyed the story i
shared, and maybe would like to add it to you site.&nbsp; Anyways, if
you have any questions, comments, or would like directions, feel free
to e-mail me back and ill be happy to impart whatever knowledge i have
to you... Thanks, oh and great site i liked seeing some of the storys i
know of.&nbsp; Oh and the girl that jumped into the river and
drowned... its a hammond story... she can be seen on holloween night,
on cline ave, hitch hiking trying to get to her wedding... supposedly
if you pick her up, she thanks you for the ride and dissappears.<br>

My name is Gemma. I went to a primary school in a small village where I
lived for a year or 2. Then we had to move into a town nearby. It
wasn't to far away from my friends so sometimes i would catch the bus
there. One day i went up to see my friend Holly. She told me that my
old deputy head teacher had just died. I dont know how old he was but
apparently he got murdered! That night Holly asked me to stay at her
house for the night so I did. We were only about 10 at the time. Her
parents were down stairs and her two little brothers were both asleep.
We were the only people awake upstairs. Holly went downstairs to get
something to eat for me and her and left me alone. I decided to play a
trick on her. I turned all the lights off and hid under her bed in her
room. I looked around. I was really scared. So i looked up and saw two
eyes looking at me. They were glowing. At that point i closed my eyes
thinking it was just my imagination but when i opened my eyes they were
still there. I stayed under the bed because i didn't want to move. Then
i heard holly coming up the stairs. The eyes backed away into the
darkness and i backed away and hid again. When Holly came in the room I
jumped out and scared her. I told her about the eyes and she believed
me. Then she said lets take a look inside the wardrobe. So we both
opened it slowly and took a look inside. Funnily enough nothing was in
there except from her clothes and stuff. So we both decided that it was
me seeing things because it was dark. Later that night Holly turned the
lights off and we both went to sleep. I couldnt get to sleep and i kept
on looking over at the wardrobe. I was lied there with my eyes wide
open when suddenly i saw the eyes again. Looking over at me. I slid
under my covers. When i looked out they had gone but i could feel
something in the room. I new something was there. Suddenly a black
figure appeared infront of me. It lied down and then i saw the eyes. It
was staring right at me. I screamed which woke Holly up and she
suddenly backed away against the wall. We could both see the black
figure on he floor. Then it seemed to sink into the ground and
dissapear. We both went downstairs and stayed there for a couple of
hours. We talked about the figure for ages. Then i said it reminded me
of something! Holly said that as well before we both realised that it
looked likemr baker... Why would he haunt us though?? We'll never
know... <br>

Tukwila, Washington<br>
<br>
By: AtkinsM@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In 1954, my family rented a small one bedroom home on the banks of the
Duwamish river in Tukwila, WA.&nbsp; It was all we could afford so we
made do.&nbsp; I was 7 years old at the time and had two sisters, each
a year apart on either side.&nbsp; My sisters slept in the single
bedroom while my parents converted the dining room into a bedroom with
sliding curtains.&nbsp; I was supposed to sleep in the bathroom behind
the metal shower where there was just enough room for a cot.&nbsp; I
rarely spent an entire night there.<br>
We learned pretty quickly that this house was not "normal" because of
strange things happening from the beginning.&nbsp; Poltergeist type
activity such as thr rocking chair beginning to rock on it's own and
the TV coming on to static, all on it's own.&nbsp; My mother was a
"stay-at-home" mother so she was the one, along with us kids, who
usually witnessed all of this.&nbsp; My father was typically skeptical.<br>
Quite often I would end up in bed with my parents.&nbsp; Late one
night, from my parents bed, I had to get up and go to the
bathroom.&nbsp; To get to the bathroom, one had to go through my
sister's bedroom.&nbsp; It was dark as I trudged into my sister's
bedroom, headed for the bathroom.&nbsp; As I entered the bedroom, I
bumped into someone I didn't see.&nbsp; It was a very noticeable crash
into a human body, not hard furniture.&nbsp; In fact, whomever I bumped
into, I surprised as they gave out a gasp and then the sound of them
falling onto my sister's bed could be heard.&nbsp; I remember saying
"oh - excuse me" and then I turned on the light as the switch was right
there at the door.&nbsp; What I saw next scared the crap out of
me.&nbsp; NO ONE WAS THERE - MY SISTERS WERE UNDER THE COVERS AND SOUND
ASLEEP.&nbsp; Shortly after that - I had everyone in the house awake.<br>
In this same house, my mother said she would often wake in the night
with a very "heavy" feeling as if someone was sitting on her chest and
whispering in her ear.&nbsp; My dad scoffed at all this.&nbsp; Then one
night, it happened to him -the heavy feeling on the chest and whispers
in the ear.&nbsp; We moved shortly after that.&nbsp; This was in
1954.&nbsp; Right after we moved, the house was torn down and The
Riverside Inn&nbsp; was erected in it's place, which has been there for
the last 51 years.&nbsp; I've been in the Riverside a few times and
often wondered if it had strange happenings.&nbsp; I've never asked
anyone there.<br>

My Personal Story<br>
<br>
By: corgiluv22@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
In early Autumn of 1999, my parents asked me to house sit, (and dog
sit), as they had to visit my younger sister who was in her last year
of college in Pittsburgh. I had the most terrifying experience of my
life that night-- that I have never forgotten even after 5 years.<br>
I agreed to help my parents, and after work friday afternoon, I stopped
off to rent movies at Blockbuster--American Pie, and The Exorcist. I
had seen the Exorcist many times before, but I heard they added bonus
Interviews to the beginning and I wanted to see that.<br>
It was a normal evening as I watched both movies. After the movies, I
decided to call my boyfriends to say goodnight to him. We had a lengthy
conversation. We somehow got into the discussion of the movie The
Exorcist. His grandparents are Iraqi and part of the movie takes place
in Iraq etc. It wasn't a scary conversaton at all. It was more of a
theological discussion about different religious beliefs. He told me
about how Iraqi people believe in "Jins" just like Christians believe
in Demons etc....<br>
We ended the conversation talking about light hearted things, and just normal everyday things. <br>
I decided to call it a night and was got washed up, and just as I was
about to flush the toilet, I heard a distinct raspy vioce and it said,
"Hiiiiiiii Annaaaaaa" (Hi Anna) in a very "taunting" or teasing way.
Simeltaneously I felt a chilll go from the base of the spine to the
back of my neck. I was literally paralyzed with fear! My heart was
racing, and I was so stunned that I physically could not move for a
good 10 seconds. I ran downstairs and made my dog come up and sleep in
my room. I also slept with 2 rosaries that night and a crucifix. I was
scared out of my mind for the entire night. <br>
Nothing else ended up happening, and when my parents came back they scoffed at me of course.<br>
I still ask myself to this day: "Did I provoke some kind of spirit by talking about religion and the occult?<br>
What bugs me is, I wasn't even thinking of anything remotely paranormal
when I heard the voice. It was an AUDIBLE voice. I am 100% sure. I also
couldn't tell whether or not the voice was male or female because the
sound was too raspy. <br>
I am 29 years old and that is the only strange or "paranormal" thing
that has ever happened to me. I still remember it like it was yesterday
and swear to God its a true story, and to this day I still cannot
explain how or why that happened. I know one thing, I don't ever want
to experience that level of fear again in my life.<br>

My Father's Ghost<br>
<br>
By: Way2BombIsBack@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I've always wanted to share this story but never knew anyone to
appreciate it.&nbsp; My father and I never really got along.&nbsp; As a
teenager, I was constantly at odds with him and when he passed almost 8
years ago, I felt more relief than anything.&nbsp; All my dad ever
wanted was to be a grandpa.&nbsp; He was at the end of his working
years and already had one grandson (from my brother).&nbsp; He had
moved us into a new home and died 2 months exactly after we moved
in.&nbsp; We moved in on July 4, 1997 and he died September 4,
1997.&nbsp; He gave us just enough time to settle in and make sure we
would be fine without him.&nbsp; I had tried for a few years to get
pregnant when my dad was alive but for some reason it never
happened.&nbsp; I was young when all of this was going on so it was for
the better.&nbsp; I wasn't even 18.&nbsp; I believe he died so I could
have my son.&nbsp; I ended up getting pregnant within 2 weeks of my
dad's death.&nbsp; Obviously, my son never knew his grandfather.&nbsp;
Throughout the years though, Gabriel (my son) has said he talks to his
"PopPop".&nbsp; I've never really talked much about my dad because of
our unsteady relationship so some of the things Gabriel comes up with
baffle me.&nbsp; I don't know where to start.&nbsp; I guess the first
time I realized they had a connection was when my son was less than 2
years old.&nbsp; We were at my brother's house and looking at the
pictures on the wall.&nbsp; He was naming the person in each
picture.&nbsp; We came to a framed photograph of my father and when I
asked my son who that was he said "My PopPop".&nbsp; Now, at this
point, I had NEVER mentioned my dad or anything about him.&nbsp; I
never kept pictures of him.&nbsp; I was stunned but I just kept on
going, as if it were no big deal.&nbsp; Several months after that, I
heard Gabriel playing in his room and carrying on a conversation unlike
the play ones kids have with themselves.&nbsp; I went in there to ask
who he was talking to and he said his PopPop.&nbsp; I asked him where
his PopPop was and he pointed up towards the ceiling and said he was up
there, watching us.&nbsp; Remember, this is all before he was 2 years
old.&nbsp; I didn't know what to think so again, I just let it
go.&nbsp; Now, as the years passed, Gabriel will sometimes cry for his
PopPop as if he knew him and he misses him.&nbsp; I mean real tears, to
the point of almost hysterics.&nbsp; He'll tell me how much he misses
his PopPop and ask why his heart had to stop "beeping" (he means
beating, my dad died of heart disease).&nbsp; Everytime he does this I
always remind him that he never knew his grandfather but he will insist
that he does, that my dad visits him.&nbsp; One time, Gabriel was
sitting at the kitchen table (probably about 4 years old) drinking a
mug of hot cocoa.&nbsp; He said, "Look Mom.&nbsp; My PopPop drinks his
coffee like this."&nbsp; And he held the mug in the exact same manner
as my father.&nbsp; Then he said, "My PopPop drinks lots of
coffee.&nbsp; He has funny black teeth right here and he wears
glasses."&nbsp; He then pointed to the top two front teeth.&nbsp; It's
true.&nbsp; My dad did have "funny teeth" and wore glasses.&nbsp; He
had a bridge that he very rarely wore so when it wasn't in place there
was a black space.&nbsp; At this point, the only picture he'd seen yet
was the one at my brother's house and in it, he was wearing his
dentures.&nbsp; Gabriel always talks about my dad in the present even
though I've explained he's no longer with us.&nbsp; There's other
things that have happened but most of the time I just don't connect
them unless I sit down and really think about it all.&nbsp; Gabriel
will start to "act funny" on special anniversary dates so I'm sure my
dad is making a visit and checking in on us during those times.&nbsp;
Sometimes, I'll notice my dad's presence also.&nbsp; Last year, it
would have been my parents 25th wedding anniversary.&nbsp; As I was
walking to my car in the morning I felt as if I was walking with a warm
cloud surrounding me.&nbsp; It was a chilly, crisp day in January but I
felt this warmth around me while I walked thru the colder air.&nbsp;
Later, I was writing the date at work and realized what day it was and
figured it must have been my dad visiting me in the morning.&nbsp; If
you're interested in knowing more, please feel free to email me back
and I'd love to share.&nbsp; I just thought this might be worth
sharing.&nbsp; <br>

My Experience<br>
<br>
By: ZEPPULON@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I was visiting my parents home in Athens, Louisiana several years ago.
My mother was visiting an aunt and my wife was watching tv with my dad.
It is a large two story house that was built in the late 1800s. I was
in the large room playing a piano when I felt some one lean on my
shoulder, I thought that it was my wife placing her hands on my
shoulder. I turned to look at her but there was no one there, I
immediately went to the living room, my wife could tell something was
wrong with me, before I could tell her what had happened the room was
filled with an overpowering scent of roses, this was in the dead of
winter.As quickly as the scent came it went away.&nbsp; We looked for
an explanation but there were none.<br>
Since then both of my parents have passed away and the house is
abandoned. I was there last fall gathering up pecans and heard a noise
like furniture being moved across the floor. There have been other
occurrences like the windows in a bedroom being raised&nbsp; when they
should have been closed,and the wind blowing the curtains. Other guest
have experienced freaky things there especially in one particular room
we all called the ghost room. My mother said she watched lights dance
on the lawn outside her window. I don't go there anymore except to
relocate flowers and gather pecans.<br>

Hauntings<br>
<br>
By: Dita1207@aol.com<br>
<br>
I am a current student of California Sate University Channel Islands,
formerly Camarillo State Mental Hospital.&nbsp; The hospital was
established in the late 1930&#8217;s and treated many different forms of
mental health issues, addictions and cared for the mentally and
severally disabled.&nbsp; About one third of the hospital has had
interior renovations and is currently being used.&nbsp; When the
hospital was fully function it was completely self sufficient,
including a working hospital with a morgue and a dairy.&nbsp; This
beautiful location was ideal fro creating a new California State school
when the hospital closed sometime in 1997.<br>
I once visited the hospital in the early 1990&#8217;s while it was still
functioning.&nbsp; Now, more then ten years later I have returned to
attend school.&nbsp; The history of this location has many curious and
egger to explore, this includes myself.&nbsp; The currently unused
portions of the old hospital still have electricity and water running
through them.&nbsp; Most of the windows and doors to the building are
open.&nbsp; There are several no trespassing signs posted every few
feet and the abandon buildings have constant police surveillance.&nbsp;
Yet many of us have been able to still enter and explore.&nbsp; I worry
about sharing this because I fear others will attempt to visit the
campus and do some investigating of their own.&nbsp; I encourage
further education ones self, but I am adamantly apposed to those who
wish to visit to do harm to the buildings.&nbsp; This is an incredibly
beautiful old facility that deserves respect and protection.&nbsp; I
take great pride in it and do what I can to care for it and educate
others.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Much of the abandon buildings have been completely emptied of any
furniture or amenities.&nbsp; I did find several rooms that still had
curtains up and pictures from magazines or drawings hanging on
walls.&nbsp; Through most of the building I did not experience other
then a few drafts of air or a noise.&nbsp; However, I did experience
something that is hard to explain while visiting the old children&#8217;s
ward.&nbsp; Up many stairs and through several rooms you come to what
looks like a recreation/school room of some sort.&nbsp; There are still
a few children&#8217;s drawings on the walls.&nbsp; You then enter into
another long narrow room with a nurse&#8217;s station on the far end.&nbsp;
Once you reach the nurses station and turn right you come to two
doors.&nbsp; One straight ahead, and one directly to the right.&nbsp;
The door directly ahead is referred to as the &#8220;black room.&#8221;&nbsp; It is
a very small room, no bigger then 10x10.&nbsp; It is painted all black
from floor to ceiling.&nbsp; There are small black cubbyholes and a
small black bench.&nbsp; In the very center of the room is a very tall,
very narrow, very deep white tub on a black platform.&nbsp; There is a
white linen sheet that can be pulled around to enclose the tub.&nbsp;
Directly in front of the tub and above it are two large mirrors, so
that in a person where to lay in the tub the only thing they could see
was themselves directly above and ahead of them.&nbsp; The room next to
the black room was incredibly small and narrow with three showerheads
next to one another.&nbsp; Both rooms felt rather warm to me, but other
than feeling incredibly uncomfortable I experienced nothing.&nbsp; As I
head back out, past the nurses station, into the large room, the best I
can explain is that I suddenly became very dizzy.&nbsp; I sort of
stumbled my way across the room and back to the door connecting to the
recreation room.&nbsp; With both hands on the door, bracing myself I
looked back into the room.&nbsp; I felt like the room was zipping
around me in a circle, I looked up to the ceiling where there are
several ceiling fans on.&nbsp; I looked at the fan furthest away from
me, near the nurse&#8217;s station, and it seemed to suddenly stop
spinning.&nbsp; I felt a wave of heat come over me, and then freezing
cold.&nbsp; I felt like I could not get my footing although I was
standing completely still and holding onto the door.&nbsp; I let go of
the door and stepped out of the room where I immediately felt perfectly
fine.&nbsp; I have since told this to others who have explored this
building and they explained that they have had similar
experiences.&nbsp; <br>
Before leaving the children&#8217;s ward I entered into another section of
the building.&nbsp; It was rather windy that day and because all the
windows and doors to all the buildings are opened, it can become quite
drafty, but nothing to cause any discomfort.&nbsp; I felt nothing else
as I walked around.&nbsp; I then came to a closed door, as soon as I
opened it a large gust of ice cold wind came rushing out and over
me.&nbsp; I assumed this was from all the open windows and doors, but
as I peered into the room not a single window was open.&nbsp; The room
was several degrees colder, to the point where I was freezing and
uncomfortable.&nbsp; I could not find any explanation into the
temperature change and immediately left the room.<br>
I recently visited a steam room that is down below another abandon
building.&nbsp; From ground level one can hear a great deal of noise
that sounds like banging pipes, but once you head below ground you find
a room that is completely empty with no pipes.&nbsp; The sounds can
still be heard, but slightly stifled.&nbsp; In that steam room there is
a large cut out on one of the walls.&nbsp; While nothing was seen while
there, later, pictures showed a light source appear that was not there
at the time.&nbsp; It is a small stream of light that is different in
every picture, and not in some pictures.&nbsp; The building that is
above the steam room has a lot of noises similar to the pipes but you
can also hear doors slam closed.&nbsp; While watching through a window
I have heard this noise, yet no doors are closed.&nbsp; Every time the
noises are verbally acknowledge a noise that sounds like a human
voice/moan/mumble can be heard from outside the window.&nbsp; <br>
I hope to further explore more of this beautiful place, while
respecting its past and those who have come here before me.&nbsp; I
have no professional training and do not claim any of my experiences to
be facts or proof of any sort of paranormal.&nbsp; I have amateur
photographs that show things I cannot explain.&nbsp; I have in no way
gone out to find anything or prove anything, but through my exploring
things have been brought to me that make me question what I see.&nbsp;
I hope others enjoy these experiences ass much as I have<br>

want me there.<br>
One Christmas in 1999 I had taken some pictures of the family and when
I had them developed ,behind my son-law were 3 mirrors,In those&nbsp;
appeared somesort of demon looking face and 3 numbers of 6 . I had a
shitzu puppy that would start in that room and stop.The room would get
ice cold and you could feel a presence in the room. One night I had
some family members stay and all 6 of them wound up in bed with me. I
don't know , nor can I explain&nbsp; of the voice that came through the
hallway at 12 one night telling me to leave,The air was so cold in the
hall, goosebumps covered me. I ran into the bedroom and told my husband
but he was sound asleep. I don't know what happened in that house but
something evil I believe lives there...<br>

When I was growing up in Indiana in the 60's my parent bought a house
in Hammond IN.&nbsp; I recall many times sitting in the living watching
tv when I would hear footsteps upstairs in the attic bedroom.&nbsp; We
never really thought much of it because my dad was usually sleeping
upstairs.&nbsp; One day, I must have been about 10 yrs old and my two
uncles and my aunt were staying with us.&nbsp; My parents had gone out
and we were sitting in the living room watching tv when we heard
footsteps upstairs again.&nbsp; This time we knew something was going
on because there was NO ONE upstairs. When we went to see what was
going on our dog was at the bottom of the stairs with his hair standing
on end and growling up the stairs.&nbsp; Our dog never did go upstairs
into the attic and he was 13 yrs old when he died.&nbsp; It turns out
that the previous owner's father died in that bedroom and I suspect it
was his footsteps that we heard.<br>

Experiences from the Laguna reservation<br>
<br>
By: Cluarkie@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I was very young when I began to experience what would be the start of
several incidences. Even to this day my friends laugh when I tell them
that because of what I witnessed I'm almost petrified of the
dark.&nbsp; <br>
At five my family lived in a trailer in Parajie, one of nine villages
on the Laguna reservation. In the living room we had two wooden shelves
attached to the wall by a general 'hook and track' set up. There were
slots along the length of each of the two tracks making the height of
the shelves ajustable.&nbsp; There were hooks on the end of each brace
securing the shelves in place and in order for the shelves to fall
forward they would have to "jump" up and over, clearing a height of at
least 11/2 inches. Twice I had been within two feet of these shelves
with my back facing them when the next thing I hear is this enormous
crash of the shelf and everything on it in pieces all over the floor.
Only one shelf fell each time. The first time I was alone in the living
room and the other my parents were sitting at the table.<br>
One last event that happened in this trailer was the sounds. The walls
were paper thin but yet what I heard that day scared me so much that it
took me some time to muster enough will power to run outside the house.
I was sitting in the living room playing when I heard the muffled
chatter of voices, followed by heavy thuds that could have been loud
enough that if someone had been sitting in the last room on the
opposite side of the house they could have heard it but like I said all
this was muffled so much so that it sounded so far away yet all this
was coming from the next room. I could not understand anything that was
being said but I could make two voices that stood out from the rest, a
deep voiced male, a moderately toned female over-powering what seemed
to be a room full to people, like you would hear standing behind a
thick concrete wall opposite a crowed restaurant. This happened in
broad daylight and the front door was about five feet away. I ran about
100 yards to my aunts and didn't go back over until I knew that there
was someone home. <br>
It didn't take too long for me to share what happened here with my
brothers, sisters and cousins. I told my parents about what happened
but they didn't seem to care about it in any way. In daylight or
especially at night I never liked that room. <br>
We moved several times before finding a place in Mesita, yet another
village. It was low rent housing. I was nine and the kids thing to do
was gather up our friends, some blankets, some munchies, some music and
sleep on top of either ours or our neighors roofs. It was one night
that the crashing shelves would make one final call. Unlike the first
two incidents I was just getting on top of the neighbors roof 30 yards
away when I heard this loud crash. I could see into our living room and
noticed two brackets sans one shelf. That was it, it was over, for now.<br>
I would just like to point out that our location was so baron that we
were far from any major highway. The surface streets at the time were
wide gravel paths. There no vibration like that of a heavy ton truck or
a low-flying aircraft. I became interested in generally studying the
paranormal when I was around twenty and came to the conclusion that
maybe these incidents were PK or poltergeist in nature.<br>
Moving again from low rent housing to new housing was where I would
experience another incident that would be my last for some time. I was
in my middle-teens and unfortunately I was the only one in the house
that night. I remember this well. I was lying on the love seat watching
the Arsenio Hall show. All my attention was on the show until I heard
heavy breathing. Already I got scared and didn't move. From the
position of the love seat I could only hear the breathing and not see
the source that this was coming from - at the time my decision was that
I didn't want to. From the location I figured that it was coming from a
chair that was next to the dining room table. The table was right
behind me and the chair was in back of the table to the right against
the wall by the securely closed and will insulated sliding door. This
breathing was inside the house, slow and deep and as clear as can be.
This lasted a little over a minute. After this ended it took some time
for me to readjust before my attention slowly came back to the applause
on Arsenio. <br>
I thought that was the end of my ordeal for the night but just as my
heart sank down out of my throat and back down to my chest this small
shadow about the size of a football floated quietly from behind the
love seat about three or so inches above the floor and went straight
torward the fireplace but did not rise. This black haze passed through
the metal chain curtain without making a sound simultaniously fading
away. I stared at the fireplace for about thirty minutes while keeping
an ear out for any more breathing. Finally I got up and turned every
single light on inside and outside the house. This was one thing that I
couldn't explain.<br>
Many years had passed since then and at least for now I've only
encountered one more to add to this. It's was just a minor scare. I
moved from the reservation in New Mexico to the big city of San
Francisco. Living to my now bad habit of staying up late at night I was
watching television when I heard the floor boards upstairs creak with
the clacking coming from footsteps. I live in the ground level in-law
of a nice house. The lady that stays upstairs lives alone having
company every now and then. I know for sure that this night she had no
one staying with her. Her living room is located directly above mine
and with the exception of a few small rugs the majority of her house is
hardwood floor. These footsteps started directly in the middle of the
room and only moved in one small area of the room above, even without
shoes the late night silence will amplify anything that's heavier than
an ant on those noisy floor boards, no one can quietly tip-toe to the
middle of the room, make noise then leave just as quietly. This
occurance like the breathing only lasted for about a minute. <br>
I knew she didn't have company that night but despite my certainty I
went up the following morning to ask her if she did. Her reply was no.
She went on to say that earlier that day on the night that I heard the
foot steps that she heard someone calling her name from either the
kitchen, dining room or the living room. She answered with no reply.
She said that it was a man's voice but didn't recognize any other
characteristic other than that.<br>
I didn't past this off. I just thought about it as such. Regardless of
geography I'm nowhere near being out the woods. I've grasped the fact
that this may continue for the rest of my life and I'm quite interested
in studying this in more specific detail. I know that there are many
facts of nature that may account for some things that happen which are
explainable but I don't see how that would apply to all of what I
shared here.<br>

Bush House Salem Oregon<br>
<br>

&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I used to be a tour guide at the Bush House in Salem oregon.&nbsp;
During the summer of 1999 a movie was flimed there and my boss Paul and
I spent the night in the house.&nbsp; By 1am Paul ws passed out
upstairs in his office and I crshed in Mr. Bush's bedroom in the back
corner of the downstairs.&nbsp; From Mr. Bush's bedroom there was a
short hallway leading to the kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp; there were doors at
both ends of it, which i had locked.&nbsp; In the hallway there was a
stair case that leads upstairs to the servents quarters where a
caretaker lives.&nbsp; It was always closed and locked.&nbsp; In the
middle fo the night i heard footsteps on the staircase that goes from
the kitchen&nbsp; to the basement.&nbsp; the next day I asked the
caretaker and Paul neither one of whom had left their sleeping places
in the night.&nbsp; It is thought to have been Mr. Bush's youngest
daughter Eugenia who was mentally ill and who died in the house in 1928.<br>

A Face in the Mirror<br>
<br>
By: robbob@net-change.com<br>
<br>
When I was younger, I moved into a very pretty but old house that
hadn't been lived in since the death of it's owner about twenty years
before. The house was spectacular, elegant, and sophisticated. The
first few months of living in that house, we heard strange sounds, and
odd things would happen (lights would turn off, doors would close,
ect.). We ignored it, thinking it was just a typical old house. Well,
my sister, brother-in-law and nephew were visiting and they layed my
nephew down for a nap in one of the spare rooms in the back of our
house. We never really used that section of the house. My
brother-in-law went to check on my nephew, and glanced into the
bathroom on the way. Apparently he saw my stepdad's reflection in the
mirror, and even though he found it odd that my stepdad was using the
bathroom in that part of the house, he ignored it and came back into
our living room. There, he saw my stepdad and the rest of our family
sitting on the couch. He seemed confused, and asked if he had just been
in the bathroom. My stepdad said no, and we all just laughed it off.
About three months later,&nbsp; my stepdad and I were sitting in the
living room watching our usual TV show. We both began to smell wood
smoke, and it seemed to be comming from the fireplace. The fireplace
hadn't been used since we had lived there. My stepdad is a firefighter,
and couldn't help but try to find the source of the smell. We didn't
really smell it untill we had gone in the other room that was on the
other side of the wall that held the fireplace. There was no heat or
other signs of fire, so we were quite interested in what it could be.
We went to the previous owners of the house to find out what we could.
They were the children of the man who had owned the house. One night
there had been a fire, and the owner went downstairs to investigate. He
opened the cabinets on the other side of the fireplace, and fire
backdrafted into his face and he died. It was the same place that we
smelled the smoke. This detail buried us in interest and asked for
photos, letters, anything tied with that house. They showed us a
picture of the man that had died, and he looked almost alarmingly
identical to my stepdad... And my brother-in-law had seen is reflection
in the mirror. <br>

The Feelings I had<br>
<br>
By: listentothebird@sbcglobal.net<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1998...I had a ghost experiance..My first and I hope my last.<br>
I was living in the second floor of a college dormitory. My collegue <br>
that lived directly under me would ask me on occassion if I was moving<br>
furniture late in the night and early morning. Between 12 midnight <br>
and 2 a.m. Absolutely not.I can recall that I moved my bed once in<br>
the middle of the day; when I first moved in at the beginning of the<br>
&nbsp;semester. I thought maybe it was a ghost because it was common<br>
&nbsp;knowledge that our domitory was an old TB hospital. The entire<br>
&nbsp;campus was located on an old military hospital site...Our cafeteria<br>
&nbsp;was were the morgue was back in World War 1 or 2.<br>
&nbsp; I never heard anything in my room.<br>
Then early one Saturday morning I got up and made myself coffee<br>
and left the dormitory on the second floor and headed down the old<br>
iron stairs.And made my way across the tennis courts to make a <br>
phone call. I could see my dormitory from where I stood. I dialed<br>
the number and was talking to a freind steadily watching the stairs<br>
to my dorm. That is when I saw a smokey black figure flalling it's<br>
arms around wildly and staring straight at me..Then it went back <br>
intp the locked closed doors of the second floor dorm. They lock <br>
behind each person that leaves.So I reported it to staff. That is<br>
when I started to hear many ghost stories from the nightgaurdsmen that <br>
patroled the cafeteria and hallways.There are many dorm buildings on campus.<br>
&nbsp;Any how; I put it behind me and c tinued my life.<br>
Shortly after my brother died due to a long illness.<br>
I returned to college but got my own apartment and shared it with<br>
a freind. It would get so cold in there..Heat turned all the way up<br>
and the fireplace on yet it was 70 degrees outside. I was still greiving<br>
so I withdrew from college and took my truck on a long drive cross<br>
country. In Nebraska while at a rest stop my entire truck swarmed<br>
with flies.I am very clean and so wasn't my truck. I was eating<br>
but still swarms of flies. I threw my food away and drove and<br>
drove crying and screaming trying to get them out of my truck.<br>
I stopped and washed my truck. Then got a motel and shower.<br>
&nbsp;I returned 6 months later to my old apartment to ask around to<br>
see if the new renters had any problem. The lady that opened the door<br>
&nbsp;was really nice and said that she had to hire someone from another<br>
state to come and clear the ghost.She said it was so bad. That the<br>
person they hired had to have a partner come and help. <br>
&nbsp; She mentioned the freezing cold room temperatures. The feeling<br>
that someone was following her up the stairs; like I had. She<br>
said they do a certain ceremony and burn certain herbs to clear away<br>
the spirit.She said the landlord had her move in because she did<br>
minor gohst clearing work. But it was too much for her. <br>
She said the people she hired said that the bowl they<br>
used to burn herbs caught fire.The flames reached the ceiling.. <br>
It was the worst ghost cleansing they had to do<br>
in a long time..Then the lady did a ceremony over me and the feeling<br>
that someting was hanging on my back just went away. Actually<br>
I felt whatever it was kind of crawl up and out of me. It moved my <br>
spine involuntarly..<br>
I have never had a problem scince..<br>

The Friendly Rollands<br>
<br>
By: pfeiffer@powerweb.net<br>
<br>
My Name is Darlyn My husband Steven and I bought a house in the Village
of Reeseville about 20 years ago.&nbsp; The house at 218 N. Main St.
was built in 1865!<br>
When jacking up and restoring the south porch on our home, my husband found a large pile of ashes...with two<br>
rounded topped tombstones, standing upright in them.<br>
He also unearthed a clay pipe!&nbsp; While the project was underway...I
suggested he dig it up to see what else was there.&nbsp; He said "No
absolutely not, they did things alot<br>
differently 100 years ago...I am putting it back the way I<br>
found it!"&nbsp; <br>
Ever since that day, pictures are tilted, items are moved, and occassional shadow is caught out of the corner of your<br>
eye, when home alone! <br>
We always say the Rollands have been at it again and<br>
live in harmony with them.&nbsp; <br>
No records can be found of the family<br>

The Hay Loft<br>
<br>
By: WylGav@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
Hi my name is Kim and i am 18 years old i have a few experiences i would like to share with you.<br>
Every summer holidays i used to go to my nana's farm and help out but
last time i went which was a few years ago when i was 14 something
happened that i've since tried to forget but i think it's about time i
shared it with you all.....................<br>
It was a boiling hot July afternoon and i was helping to clean out one
of the barns, my nana went after about half an hour complaining that it
was "too hot for her liking"&nbsp; but i decided to stay and try and
finish. About 10 minutes after my nana left i began to hear tiny pitter
patter of feet in the hay loft. Thinking that it was just mice or
something i got on with my work. I began sweeping when i heard laughter
and two voices one of a boy and the other a girl talking in hushed
whispers.<br>
"Hello is there some one up there?" i asked <br>
i peered up the stairs feeling slightly scared and called again but no
one replied as i turned to get back on with my work the voice of the
girl called out "quickly up here"<br>
I was quite spooked no one should be up here but the other kids in the village were always mucking around.<br>
"Hey your not aloud up here" i shouted as i walked up the stairs. As i
got up to the hay loft i heard an all mighty scream and looked up too
see the too silvery children with hooks through their necks blowing in
the slight wind. <br>
I completely freaked out and ran screaming to my nanas house. My nana
later told me that two young children had died in that barn when they
were playing around. My mum came to pick me up the next day and as we
drove away i looked back at the barn and saw two little faces staring
back from the hay loft window. Needless to say i never went
back................<br>
well, that was my first experience and will post my other another time.<br>

The Lemp Mansion<br>
<br>
By: redflame41@sbcglobal.net<br>
<br>
Just a note, I LOVE your site!<br>
Ok, on with the story...<br>
My mother, her girlfriend (I hope you don't take offense to
homosexuals), and I were going to dinner at the Lemp Mansion.&nbsp;
Btw, the food is delicious, I highly recommend it.&nbsp; And we were
seated in a smaller corner room on the left side of the house in the
far back.&nbsp; The entire time, we were on edge and nothing was
happening.&nbsp; So we simply ate and talked.&nbsp; <br>
At one point, I had to use the bathroom, so I exused myself and went
alone.&nbsp; As soon as I entered, I saw that the bathroom had only two
stalls.&nbsp; I entered one and as soon as I was done, I took a quick
look around and I found out I was the only one in there.&nbsp; The
toilets had seat covers, and I had set mine down, while the other was
up.&nbsp; I decided the wash my hands and take my time enjoying the
lighting and what not.&nbsp; <br>
As I was washing them I thought I heard the stall door creak and I
turned to find that the doors were as they had been when I had first
looked.&nbsp; So I simply gave a weird look to the stall and continued
washing.&nbsp; As I was finishing up and turning off the water, the
sound of a toilet seat slamming onto the rim startled me and I turned
to see who made the racket, since I hadn't heard anyone come in.&nbsp;
I saw no one, and looked in both stalls to find that both of the covers
were just as I had first seen them, and I was still completely alone.<br>
Thanks for reading!<br>

The Little Girl in the Closet<br>
<br>
By: g.palm69@ntlworld.com<br>
<br>
My name is Catherine. After the experiances me and my family have had,
i know we have a ghost. It all started when I was seven. I couldn't get
to sleep, I looked down from my bunkbed for a moment or two and saw, in
my bedroom closet which had no door, what seemed to be a little girl,
sitting in there,staring at me. She wore a white dress and was
underneath either a white blanket or duvet cover. Once me, my mum, and
my sister were watching a film in the dark, and suddenly, on the shelve
my picture was slammed down. One time my sister said that she had seen
the ghost, one night when we had our normal beds. She saw her walk from
the closet to the end of her bed, just staring at her. then she flew
through the wall. The second time I saw her was when I was out in the
kitchen. I saw her out the window, in the shed window, smiling, but
there were two faces beside her this time. The most scariest experience
I ever encountered, was when I was watching tv. I was sitting down on
one of the settee when I heard footsteps coming down the stairs, I got
scared and turned off the tv to ask who was there. Then, the door
creaked open then there was a noise on the other settee like someone
was sitting down on it! I was so scared I couldn't move. Nothing else
has happened since then but I know our house is haunted for sure, the
girl just won't go away...<br>

Theorosa"s Bridge and Our Families Story<br>
<br>
By:osirus2be@gmail.com <br>
<br>
This is a true story of our families experience at Theorosa's bridge<br>
in Wichita Kansas.<br>
I grew up in Sedgwick Kansas a small town just North of the bridges<br>
location. Since my family is American Indian we always respected the<br>
legend and tales of the bridge.<br>
On May 12th 1983 my own mother was killed in a car wreck within feet<br>
of the old bridge.<br>
The police couldn't explain what caused her to swerve sharply to the<br>
left, however, they agree that "something" must of been in the road in<br>
front of her. Although no animal tracks were ever found and it wasn't<br>
another car.<br>
I was young at the time and awake around midnight with a horrible<br>
dream that I'd been killed (someone had chopped my head off with an<br>
ax).<br>
Later that morning around 4:45 a.m. I was awaked again by someone<br>
pounding on my door. It was the police looking for me, turns out they<br>
found my drivers license in my mom's car. Thinking it was me who died<br>
they came to inform my parents only to find me standing in the<br>
doorway.<br>
Several years later, I was helping my dad go through some papers and<br>
found my mom's death certificate. Only then did I find out that mom's<br>
was thrown through the windshield and decapitated.<br>
Throughout the years as family members and friends have drove by the<br>
site strange things have happened to them. Their cars quit working for<br>
just a few moments or they see things, like my mom standing there<br>
looking at them smiling.<br>
If anyone would like to email me I'd be more then happy to talk to you<br>
about all the strange things I've personally seen.<br>

Theta Chi Fraternity House update - Pontiac / Have A Nice Day Cafe update<br>
<br>
By: craig_sharum@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I used to live in that house (as a brother). The fire in the attic was
true and strange things did happen. One of the most common had to do
with the lights. We had sensors installed to cut back on brothers
leaving the lights on. These sensors ONLY reacted to movement. These
lights would go on and off all the time when no one would be in the
room. We would be several rooms away, far enough from the sensors that
we wouldn't set them off, and they would suddenly go on and off.<br>
Also, there were times when we would be sleeping and we would wake up
to what sounded like a large social gathering downstairs. Several of us
would go down there, thinking it was a group of brothers coming home
from the bar, only to find the entire house empty and no one would be
around.<br>
Also, I used to work at Have A Nice Day Cafe and the upstairs was
indeed haunted. I would have to go up there every night to take down a
banner that was thrown over the exterior of the building. To do this I
would have to go to the roof, via the upstairs. It is full of rooms,
completely empty. There was this long hallway that stretched the length
of the building. There was only one light that sat at the end of the
hallway. As you walked down the hall you would get the feeling your
were being watched. Several bouncers claimed to have seen a man up
there. Apparently before it was Have A Nice Day Cafe it was called
Industry and one night a bar back committed suicide&nbsp; upstairs
using a broken beer bottle and when the bouncers would make their
rounds before closing they would have to go up there to make sure no
one snuck up there and when they would flash their flashlights into the
room in which the suicide took place, the man/ghost was seen crying and
bleeding. Then he would get up and run towards you asking for help.
Many bouncers quit after they experienced it.<br>

We Believe it was Her<br>
<br>
By: Left70@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
When I was about ten years old I saw an old women in the garden outside
my bedroom window.&nbsp; At the time I did not think anything of it
until years later my good friend said that when she stayed the night
she woke in the middle of the night because she felt as though
something was watching her and she saw an old woman looking at
her.&nbsp; It was then that I realized that what I saw was not my
imagination.&nbsp; My mother was home alone one night with our family
dog named Buster and they were on the couch together when she heard a
door shut and no one was there.&nbsp; My mom finally believed us.&nbsp;
Before my parents bought the house a woman had died in our house and we
believe it was her.<br>

Has our realatives really left us after dyeing?<br>
It was one night while staying at my grandmothers. I was about 11. I
was whatching TV in there living room when I heard what sound like my
grand father (big, a little chubby and tall) walking through the house,
but I didn't bother to look (figuring that it was him). Then I finally
said bunkie (what I call my grand father) what are you doing. I was
waiting for him to say something like "Oh I'm going to bed", but there
was no reply. Out of the corner of my eye I could see a shadow of a man
such as my grandfather. but as soon as I got up it faided. I rushed
downstairs to the basement were my grand parents were . just bairly out
of breath I managed to say to my grand father "were you just up
stairs?". he said "No why do you ask?"<br>
about a year befor this happened my beloved great uncle died of a
disease in his lungs and his kidneys. After getting out the hospital
from an operation he staid with my grand parents and loved it there.
After he had went back to work and got his own apartment. He died ,
found by his ex wife. The day of his funerale I promised never to foget
him and never dought&nbsp; word he said. And I still stand bye my
promise today<br>

Spirit in Our Home<br>
<br>
By: keiromagoodies@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
Growing up in Lakeland Florida my parents purchased a reposessed mobile
home.&nbsp; One of the bedroom doors had a dead bolt lock, but faced so
the child in the room could not get out.&nbsp; My elder sister had this
room and reported a small girl about the age of 5 or 6 would appear in
a white nightgown carrying a teddy bear.&nbsp; She would sit at the end
of my sisters bed and just cry.&nbsp; In the closet of my bedroom in
the same house, there were stickers and drawings on the wall where it
appeared someone was punished and made to sit in the closet.&nbsp;
There were also fingernail scratches on the wall in the same
closet.&nbsp; In the 3rd children's room of the same house, there was
brown carpeting with a lime green shape on the floor that was the same
shape of a clothes iron.&nbsp; If an iron fell onto carpeting while it
was hot, doesn't it make sense it would just BURN the carpet hair
instead of change the color to green?!&nbsp; My aunt even had to come
"remove" a spirit once that was following my little sister all the way
to school and hiding behind things when she'd turn around to see who

Redcoats in my Home<br>
<br>
By: 10WaitT@kingston-grammar.surrey.sch.uk<br>
<br>
This is a story about ghosts or at least a paranormal experience. I heard<br>
noises in my room at first and just thought nothing&nbsp; but after a few years i<br>
did some research and saw my house used to be a big mansion where redcoats<br>
(british soldiers from Napoeolns time) were billeted.after finding this out<br>
i did not care as i never felt threatend or scared by the noises. Anyway<br>
that night i saw the redcoats.They were not a whitey pale colour but a<br>
greeny eerie colour. They were siting around tables drinking beer and<br>
playing cards. Then one of them saw me and he pointed (i couldnt hear them<br>
just see him pointing at me and his mouth move) they then all looked at me<br>
and one of them drew their sword. Then they dissappeard which i hope meant<br>
that i dissappeared aswell if anyone can remember a story about seeing a boy<br>
in bed from your grandfathers fathers father then it was probably me just<br>
travelling through the space time continuim<br>
also i saw the jfk assination but no-one saw me then and i also saw<br>
Napoleons death so if anyone can recall someone saying that e-mail me at<br>

My Encounters with Ghosts<br>
<br>
By: kitty_campbell31@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
My name is Kitty and I m 21 years old. I may have already submitted to<br>
this site years ago, but I can t remember for sure, so I m resubmitting.<br>
My family has always been open-minded about spiritual and paranormal<br>
matters. When I was younger, I had quite a few paranormal experiences, as<br>
did my mom. The most direct contact either of us has had with spirits was<br>
with her father. He died at home (he lived with us) when I was about 4. My<br>
mom was very close to him, and I was pretty close to him for being so<br>
young. After he died, my mom would often be housecleaning and walk into<br>
the room where his old recliner sat, and smell his unique scent, cigarette<br>
smoke mixed with cologne and whatnot. She never saw or heard him, but she<br>
would know he was there and would talk to him for a while. When I was 6,<br>
we moved out of the house he died in and into the house where my mom still<br>
lives. My grandfather decided to come with us. I never had the type of<br>
encounters my mom had with him, but I was lucky enough to see him once.<br>
First, I need to explain the set-up of our house. The front and back doors<br>
are directly parallel to each other, and both have glass panes in them.<br>
The front door opens into the dining room, and you can walk straight<br>
through to the kitchen and then to the back door. You can look from the<br>
front porch all the way into the back yard through the glass in these<br>
doors. When I was about 7, I was standing in the kitchen looking out the<br>
window of the back door, and I could see the reflection of the front door<br>
in the glass. Suddenly, I saw my grandfather walk by the front door in the<br>
reflection, as though he were walking across the front porch. He smiled<br>
and waved at me. The whole thing only lasted a split second, but he was<br>
very deliberately contacting me. I believe he chose to do it in such an<br>
indirect way so as not to frighten me. Maybe he was saying&nbsp; goodbye&nbsp; since<br>
I was too young to understand when he actually died. What s strange is<br>
that I described him to my mom as looking younger than he had when he<br>
died, and when she showed me some pictures of him in his 40 s, I told her<br>
that s exactly how he appeared to me. She thinks he must have been<br>
happiest during that time of his life and so chose to appear that way. I<br>
think it was a couple years after that when my mom had her final encounter<br>
with him. She was housecleaning again, when she smelled his familiar odor.<br>
She was in a hurry, and she told him&nbsp; I m sorry Dad, I can t really talk<br>
right now , and left the room. When she came back in, the scent was gone,<br>
and she just knew that was the last time she would&nbsp; hear&nbsp; from him. She<br>
feels guilty that she didn t stop to talk to him, but I think he just<br>
realized that she was ready to move on, and that s why he didn t contact<br>
her again. We do believe that he stuck around for a while after that,<br>
because we would often lose a piece of jewelry or something small, only to<br>
have it turn up right under our noses a few days later. This continued for<br>
years.<br>
<br>
I have had other experiences unrelated to my grandfather, but his was the<br>
only (human) spirit I ever actually saw. Not long after we moved into the<br>
new house, I had several experiences with feline spirits. I once saw the<br>
hind legs and tail of a cat disappearing into (not up) the top of the<br>
stairs from the landing. I know it couldn t have been our own cat because<br>
it was pure white, and our two cats were black. Another time, I was<br>
sitting at the kitchen table when I felt a cat rubbing against my legs. I<br>
reached down to pet it, but nothing was there, and when I looked under the<br>
table, there was no cat to be found.<br>
There were also a few incidents in my mom s house where electronics would<br>
do things seemingly on their own. The TV turned itself off at least twice<br>
that I can remember, but perhaps the weirdest instance was when I was in<br>
my bedroom listening to my stereo. It has one of those LED screens that<br>
flashes things as the music plays, and when you turn the volume knob,<br>
these bars show up on the screen that move up or down as you change the<br>
volume. I was listening to music one day, and I had my back to the stereo,<br>
when I realized the volume was getting lower. I turned around, and the<br>
volume display had come up on the screen and the bars were going down like<br>
the knob was being turned. I turned the volume back up, and nothing else<br>
happened after that.<br>
This has gotten long, but I only have one more experience to share. At<br>
another sleepover with my best friend, we decided to leave a tape recorder<br>
with a blank tape in an empty room while we hung out in the living room,<br>
and record whatever there was to hear. No one went in the room while it<br>
was recording, and the door was shut. When we played it back, we could<br>
very faintly hear ourselves in the living room for most of the tape, and<br>
nothing else. But there was one spot on the tape where a high-pitched<br>
voice spoke in a loud, raspy whisper. It was obviously neither of us,<br>
because you could hear us in the background very softly behind it. We<br>
weren t sure what it said, but it sounded like&nbsp; Shine the light . It<br>
didn t make any sense, but it did creep us out! That was the only<br>
unexplained voice on the tape, which unfortunately I no longer have. That<br>
was the last experience I had that I m certain had no physical<br>
explanation. <br>
