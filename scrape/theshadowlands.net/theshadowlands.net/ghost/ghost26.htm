<P>
<P><B>Well I was sitting up one night and I came across your page and I thought

that I would send you a story of my own,once when my mom and dad were staying
in california with my uncle they had a strange experience, my sister was
about five and I hadn't been born yet, they were staying at this old house
that my uncle owned and they were sitting at the dinner table one night,
they had made a very spicy chili, they were talking about ghosts and things
and my uncle told them that he had a ghost well my mom always the skeptic
said that she did not believe them, so later that night she heard someone
in the kitchen stirring something in a cup, well she just thought that it
was my uncle mixing some soda water because he had heartburn, the next morning

she asked him about it, he said he didn't know what she was talking about,
and my aunt verified his story, that wasn't the only thing either, later
in the week she was lying awake iin bed one night and she looked at a picture
of christ that was hanging on the wall and all of a sudden it took on a demonic

look to it, then she felt a hand on her foot it didn't move or anything but
it just rested its hand right on her foot, see my mother is a very strong
person and not anything could scare her like this did, thats not all though,

later when my other uncle came to stay with us in the house his wife freaked
out one day and locked the bathroom door and climbed out the window and came
in through the front door, and she looked at my mom and my other aunt and
told them that she knew what they were up too and that she could get out
of the house if she had too, well my aunt isn't crazy she's a very down to
earth person, after that my mother told my dad that she was leaving with
or without him. Like I was saying i was sitting up one night and I came across

your page, I dont't know if this is just a story my mom told me just to scare
me or if its true but I do know that every time we bring it up she gets a
scared look on her face.</B>

<H3><A NAME=grandmother>My Grandmother?</A>
</H3><P><B>by rmrani01@morehead-st.edu </B>
<P>
<P><B>This is a true story. I have to tell it because I believe anyone else

</B>
<P><B>would think I'm crazy. I have seen a ghost and it scared the hell out
of </B>
<P><B>me. </B>
<P><B>	It all started late one night about 12 o'clock when my dad and I </B>
<P><B>were sitting in our living room. I was about 5 years old and I was
sitting </B>
<P><B>on my dad's lap while he was relaxing in his favorite recliner. We
were </B>
<P><B>just sitting there watching tv andfrom where we were sitting we were
</B>
<P><B>facing the hallway. All the lights in the house were off and my mother

</B>
<P><B>was in bed. All of the sudden I saw this woman walking through the
</B>
<P><B>hallway. She was wearing a long white gown and she appeared to be almost

</B>
<P><B>floating. I turned to ask my dad if he saw it and he was just staring

</B>
<P><B>down the hallway. I could feel his whole body tense and I could feel
the </B>
<P><B>chills on his arms. Dad turned to me and asked me if I had seen it.
I </B>
<P><B>said yes and I asked who was it. I was starting to get really scared
and </B>
<P><B>dad tried to calm me down by saying that it was probalby my mother.
That </B>
<P><B>figure had turned the corner and we figured that if it were my mother

</B>
<P><B>going into the kitchen that we would see her come back out. Nothing
or no </B>
<P><B>one ever came back through. My dad finally got fed up and got the nerve

</B>
<P><B>to go looking through the house and I went with him because I didn't
want </B>
<P><B>to be left alone. We never found anybody and the next day we asked
my </B>
<P><B>mother if she had been up at any tiem that night and she said no, that

</B>
<P><B>she had slept all through the night. To this day I will always believe

</B>
<P><B>that it was grandmother. I never got to know her because she died before

</B>
<P><B>I was born. But I've seen pictures and although I did not get a real
good </B>
<P><B>look at whatever was in the hallway I will always beleive that it was

her.</B>
<P><B>It still scares me to death just trying to tell the story but I feel
it </B>
<P><B>finally had to be told.  </B>

<H3><A NAME=the>The Poltergeist</A>
</H3><P><B>by Chet in CO</B>
<P>
<P><B>I swear that this is true.  My entire young life I was the focus of
a poltergeist.  I am now 32 and nothing has happened for more than 5 years.
 My earliest memories are of the front door of our very old Pennsylvania

farmhouse opening every evening at approximately the same time - around 8:00
PM.  It became a natural occurance and when the door unlatched and swung
open, someone would say "George's home - go shut the door" and we would just
get up and shut it - no big deal.  The door unlatched even when the deadbolt
was locked.  It wasn't until my father replaced the entire front door when
I was around 12 that "George" couldn't open the door anymore.  Maybe his
key wouldn't work.  I think this frustrated him into action.</B>
<P><B>Shortly afterwards, my family was eating Sunday dinner in the kitchen
when across the room, in view only to my sister and I, the cupboard opened,
a box fell over, and two more stood up.  The cupboard just as strangely closed.
 I can think of no explanation for this and can remember the incident as
if it occurred yesterday as can my sister.</B>
<P><B>Then the mischief seemed to focus on me.  One or two really startling

incidents stand out, the scariest was one night I was home alone listening
to classical music on the stereo (Wagner's "In the Hall of the Mountain King")

and talking to my girlfriend. The only light in the room was provided by
a kerosene lamp which was in style then.  I was telling her about the ghost
in the house and laughing it up like it was a joke.  As she listened on the
other end of the line, the stereo began modulating, going very fast and then
very slow making a very eerie sort of music (listen to the music I said was

playing sometime and imagine the effect) while at the same time the kerosene
lamp began to flicker like a strobe light.  I was petrified and my girlfriend
was in a panic asking me what was going on.  It all came to a peak when the
lamp sent up a bright flame that lit up the whole room with a loud "whoosh"
and just as suddenly, at the exact same moment, the stereo went back to normal.
 I sat motionless and silent for a few minutes in a cold sweat, while my

girlfriend cried.  </B>
<P><B>I think that was a warning not to make fun of him.</B>
<P><B>Another inexplicable event was about a year later, I came home from
school to grab my golf clubs and run back out to my waiting friends.  I ran
up to my room but they were gone.  My mother had no idea what had happened
to them nor did anyone else in my family.  Strangely, a few of us remembered
my father loaning them to a stranger but the memory felt more like a dream,
I don't know if I can explain that part satisfactorily, but we remembered
the same details. Well, my father vehemently denied loaning them to anyone
and got annoyed with us insisting on our "memory" of the stranger in the
dining room borrowing my golf clubs.  My clubs remained missing for more
than a week.  On an uneventful day I came home from school and went up to
my room and there were my golf clubs -- in my bed!  The club heads were resting

on my pillow and the bag was under the blankets right where I sleep!  Again
my mother was home the entire day and swears that we had no visitors - she

accused me of playing a prank on &lt;U&gt;her&lt;/U&gt;.  (as a note, my
room was on the third floor and inaccessible except through the house).</B>
<P><B>There are many more, the poltergeist followed me to college and from
place to place where I've lived all across the country.  Things have moved
in front of myself and others.  Precious things have disappeared and just
as mysteriouly reappeared in overly conspicuous places.  He even followed
me into my first couple of years of marriage.</B>
<P><B>I don't fear him, but I sure don't laugh at him.</B>

<H3><A NAME=watching>Someone's Watching</A>
</H3><P><B>by Juliet6985@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have two stories to tell you. One was a wonderful ending that made
me feel like my family is being watched over. The other, being watched over
but not by anyone or thing we want!</B>
<P><B>The first, one night while I was sleeping, I dreamt that I was in an
old dark basement and that it was life or death that I get out. Frantic I
finally was able to open a very large door. As I stepped out to the light
I heard my daughter calling me from the basement. As I turned I saw her as
a baby sitting in her stroller and smilling at me. She was gesturing for
me to get her (in reality she was 12 yrs. at the time of the dream). The
last thing I wanted was to go back through the door to the basement but I
would never leave her there. So back in I went, I held her but I was not
able to leave the basement. I clung to her and then I woke.</B>
<P><B>I was in a sweat, I even woke my husband I was so upset, he told me
not to worry that is was only a dream. I could not go back to sleep, I lay
there for 20 min. and then got up and went to the bathroom. After leaving
the bathroom, still feeling extreamly upset, instead of turning to my bedroom

somthing made me go to my daughter's room down the hall. As I opened her
bedroom door, the smell of somthing burning almost floored me. I screamed
for my husband, we ran in her room looking for a fire but could not find
one. We were feeling the wall thinking the fire was behind them. Nothing,
but there was no doubt something was buring. Then my husband looked up at
the ceiling and said it was the fan. The motor of her overhead fan was burning
( we keep the fans on at night during the summer). We shut the electricity
off to assure no further problems. We would take care of it the next day.
The funny thing about it was she slept through the whole thing! </B>
<P><B>The next story is upsetting, still to this day I have to deal with
it each working day. I work in an office with my husband in our own business.
We rent a second floor storefront in an old town. We have been there for
about one and a half years. It started out with my husband calling me from
work ( he sometimes would have to work late hours) telling me he felt someone
was up there with him. This happend often enough, but I would always tell
him to come home. He got use to it, and one time he thought someone looked
in on him from the other room. But being a typical male, did not take it

seriously. Then one sunday I had to run in and make out some checks I forgot
to mail on friday. As soon as I went in I found myself constantly looking
down the hall as if expecting to see someone. Sitting at my desk I kept looking

up, knowing no one would be there, I just couldn't stop. Then it happened.

Someone or thing was standing in front of me breathing very hard, very loud.
At first I tried to logically figure it out. When I ruled out anything I
could possible think of, the hair on my neck stood up. My hand was shaking

uncontrollably when I called my husband up.  He called the police on the
other line while he kept me on the phone. Of course I knew they wouldn't
find anyone but I left the office with them. </B>
<P><B>Since then I still must go to work, I feel something is there but there
has not been another incident. That next morning on monday I talked to what
ever it was that frightened me outloud with my husband there. I asked that
it not bother me again  as I must still work there. I told it, it was a mean

thing to do to me. My husband thought it was ammusing. Still working there!</B>

<H3><A NAME=honeymoon>Haunted Honeymoon</A>
</H3><P><B>by Twinkie4u@webtv.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>On April 29,1991, on our honeymoon at the Crescent Hotel in Eureka</B>
<P><B>Springs Ark. we were visited by unearthly beings.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The night turned  cold and rainy as a storm which carried tornados</B>
<P><B>through Wichita and Oklahoma swirled around us in the Govenors Suite.</B>
<P><B>As kinky as it is my parents came along on the honeymoon and had a</B>
<P><B>seperate room in the same suite.  Their room was about Michaels pub</B>
<P><B>which they heard the tinkling of ivorys most of the night.</B>
<P>
<P><B>About 1:00 a.m. after a trip to the restroom, and sliding between the</B>
<P><B>sheets, the room which was air conditioned suddenly turned hot.</B>
<P><B>Figuring that the humidity rose outside I didnt think much of it. 
I</B>
<P><B>turned to snuggle with my husdand when a moan sounded loudly

throughout</B>
<P><B>the room, I looked at my husdand and knew it wasnt him as the sound

came</B>
<P><B>from the upper right side of the room.  The hair on the back of my

neck</B>
<P><B>stood straight up and I tried to snuggle closer until my husdand woke

up</B>
<P><B>and started screaming at the top of his lungs and jumping around in

the</B>
<P><B>bed.  By this time I was crying and hollering at him to stop as he

was</B>
<P><B>scaring the hell out of me.  He finally settled down and kept telling

me</B>
<P><B>everything was alright.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Needless to say at 3:00 a.m. I was up for good watching the weather</B>
<P><B>channel and drinking diet pepsi.  Lee got up not much later than that</B>
<P><B>and we sat talking about what had happened so early in the morning.</B>
<P><B>When I asked him what had happened. He sheepishly asked you mean when

I</B>
<P><B>was yelling? He said that there was a person in white standing on

your</B>
<P><B>side of the bed looking down on you.  When  I started to yell, it</B>
<P><B>disappeared.</B>
<P><B>Needless to say, throught this whole mess my parents never heard a</B>
<P><B>thing.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Up and at em' the next morning I told my mom about what had happened

and</B>
<P><B>she said she had seen a young girl dressed in white as well.  At the</B>
<P><B>front desk we asked if the hotel was haunted and the desk clerk said

"of</B>
<P><B>course"  We told him out story and come to find out that the Crescent</B>
<P><B>Hotel has  several ghosts is attendance.  Of which we were probably</B>
<P><B>visited by atleast two that night.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Since then we have stayed the night on several different occasions

and</B>
<P><B>nothing note worthy to say happened.  I knew of another couple who

went</B>
<P><B>and stayed there and they had experiences themselves.  I also know
a</B>
<P><B>friend who worked there as a maid several years ago and she has here</B>
<P><B>stories as well.</B>

<H3><A NAME=gettysburg>Gettysburg</A>
</H3><P><B>by M459@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I'm not sure I'm a believer in ghost or not. But I am a good Catholic
and I do believe in the ALMIGHTY and Heaven and hell, So I have an open mind

about it. One of my past time is reading about U.S history, So needless to
say I've read a lot about the Civil War and the battle of Gettyburg. The
last time the family and I went back east to visit my mother-in-law we made
a trip to the Gettysburg battle field. We drove to the top of little round
top to look at the battle field and down to devils den. As soon as the family
and I got out of the car we were struck by this smell of something dead.
My daughter made the comment about it and I told her it was most likely a
dead dear that the rangers haven't pick up yet. We then drove down to devils
den and when we got out of the car the smell was still there. Now there is
a famous photo taken at devils den that is called the Snipers Pit, Which
shows a soldier lying dead behind a stone wall built between to large boulders.
I explaned to my kids that the soldier wasn't killed here but futher away.
I had been to Gettysburg a few years before and by using old photos from
a book I had found the location. The area is off the beat path so you have
to walk through all the over grown brush to get there. As we turn around
the back side of this boulder where this poor soul was killed we found a
2 by4 inch Confederate flag plant there. Someone like myself, a civilwar
buff must have put it there. So I had the kids stand there next to the flag
and I took four pictures. Now the strange part. When had those photos developed

all of them came out except the four I took by the Confederate flag. A bright

light ran down all four of those pictures right between my kids, like an
over exsposer, yet all the other pictures were fine. And the smell? It was
there the whole time we were there at that area of of the battlefield it
never got stronger or weaken it was just there.........M.C </B>

<H3><A NAME=monk>The Monk</A>
</H3><P><B>by hgrams@usa.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>I have known a number of ghosts over the years, the most recent</B>
<P><B>visitation was two years ago.  I had been in a really stupid accident</B>
<P><B>six months earlier that compounded a back problem I was born with.
 I</B>
<P><B>had been in the super market bagging my groceries when I was struck

in</B>
<P><B>the back with a shopping cart with 240 pounds of water softener salt

in</B>
<P><B>it.  A carelous stock boy had loaded it and shoved in in my

direction,</B>
<P><B>letting go of it.  The uncontrolled cart struck me at the position
of</B>
<P><B>the 3rd and 4th lumbar vertebra, where I also have scoliosis.  I now</B>
<P><B>have spondylolesthesis (A forward displacement of these two vertebra)</B>
<P><B>along with fractures of the same two vertebra which gives me

horendous</B>
<P><B>pain.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have had a lot of physical therapy, acupuncture, drugs, a heavy</B>
<P><B>elastic brace (a sports corset, the type worn by professional

football</B>
<P><B>players), and still have trememdous pain.  Even months of prayer were

of</B>
<P><B>little effect in causing the pain to subside.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One night in March I lay in bed as usual, I was laying on my left

side</B>
<P><B>facing my east window.  This overlooks the back door where there is
a</B>
<P><B>security light that operates with a motion sensor.  By this time I

was</B>
<P><B>more than a little ticked because God was not listening to my pleas

for</B>
<P><B>help.  I told Him to stop ignoring me and I begged him to send me

some</B>
<P><B>saint to give me some sort of comfort, I even asked to be allowed

just</B>
<P><B>to dream of having healing massage to ease my discomfort even a

little.</B>
<P>
<P><B>As I was in a state of half-sleep, the security light came on</B>
<P><B>iluminating my room.  This light caused me to waken fully.  At the

same</B>
<P><B>time I felt the mattress move as a weight settled on it directly

behind</B>
<P><B>me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I turned my head and saw a Buddahist monk approximately 30 to 35

years</B>
<P><B>of age kneeling there.  I noted he was dressed in saffron robes and
a</B>
<P><B>dark red woolen outer wrap.  His left arm and shoulder was bare.  He

had</B>
<P><B>very closly cropped black hair and even white teeth.  His dark,

almost</B>
<P><B>black eyes were briming with feeling, they were the most compasionate</B>
<P><B>eyes I have ever looked into.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I asked him who he was and what he was doing there.  He told me "I
am</B>
<P><B>the Dahali Lama from two times back," and he gave me a Tibetan name
I</B>
<P><B>can't pronounce or spell.  He indicated he was a previous incarnation

of</B>
<P><B>the present Dahali lama, two times removed.  He said he had come to

give</B>
<P><B>me a healing massage.</B>
<P>
<P><B>That was acceptable to me and I lay my head back down on my pillow

and</B>
<P><B>let him work on me.  He knew exactly what part of my spine to work

on,</B>
<P><B>and rubbed, kneaded and massaged my back until I a felt a warm glow</B>
<P><B>penetrating the whole area.  I fell into the most peaceful sleep I

had</B>
<P><B>had in months!  In fact, I remained free of pain for well over six</B>
<P><B>months!</B>
<P>
<P><B>I really wish he would come back as my back is acting up again. 

Also,</B>
<P><B>it is really hard to find a healer that makes house calls these days,</B>
<P><B>and the price (nothing) was so right for an old lady on Social Security!

</B>
<P>
<P><B>I did go to the library and looked up references on the Dahali Lamas,</B>
<P><B>the one I forget the exact number, from two times back died when he

was</B>
<P><B>very young, there was very little information available on him.</B>
<P>
<P><B>There is a Buddahist temple about 2 to 3 miles directly north of my</B>
<P><B>house, one of about 3 or 4 in the state.  Whether this spirit was or

is</B>
<P><B>a guardin of that temple I do not know, I just know he was a

wonderful</B>
<P><B>healer with a gentle touch and he is welcome in my house anytime he</B>
<P><B>choses to visit!</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have had experiences where something or someone has sat on my bed</B>
<P><B>before, I was always too afraid to open my eyes and look at them, I</B>
<P><B>would say a few prayers and they would go away.  Next time I will

look</B>
<P><B>to see who or what they are.  My guardian angels are there to protect</B>
<P><B>me, why should I be afraid? -- </B>
<P>
<P><B>One of my physical therapist's said:  "That proves God is</B>
<P><B>nondemoninational!"</B>

<H3><A NAME=yari>Yari's House</A>
</H3><P><B>by Xavier687@aol.col</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have believed in spirits my whole life and have had many encounters.
This is one that I will never forget and pray will never repeat...</B>
<P><B>I was invited to sleep over my girlfriend Yari's house one night in
12th grade while her parents were away. Her aunt Lisa was watching us and
we watched a movie together. </B>
<P><B>Around 1:30am we all decided to go to bed. Yari was to sleep with her
aunt in her parents bedroom and I was going to sleep in Yari's room. She
came in, kissed me goodnight, and closed the door. This was around 2:00am.
I remember Yari telling me some stories about the hauntings that went on
in her room and they distrubed me but I was able to sleep anyway.</B>
<P><B>I was asleep for about 30 minutes when the door began to open. There
in the doorway was a tall figure wearing a white nightgown, like the one
Yari was wearing, with long black hair, again same as Yari, but I couldn't
see a face because of the moonlight in the room.  The figure started to come

towards me. I thought it was my girlfriend and I was going to get lucky.
The figure reached out its hand to me as I folded my covers over and reached
out my hand to pull her, what I thought was my girlfriend, into bed with
me. </B>
<P><B>I went to grab its hand and mine went right through it. The figure
was no more then a foot away from me. I looked straight into its face and
then it vanished. I screamed, hopped out of bed, and ran into the T.V. room.

</B>
<P><B>Yari and her aunt came running out of her parents room to see what
was going on. I told them what happened, naturally her aunt didn't believe
me, but Yari with a serious look on her face said "You saw it?!" </B>
<P><B>They went back to bed after a little while and I stayed up in the T.V.
room until 6am and left the house. I never went back into her house again
for the remainder of our relationship. </B>
<P><B>One thing that I constantly think about not noticing earlier was when
the figure was walking toward me. The gown never bent where its knees should
have bent. I have told this story to countless people and almost all of them
said I was crazy, hopefully you won't.</B>

<H3><A NAME=mom>My Mom's Visit</A>
</H3><P><B>by asthom@ieighty.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>I have a very true story for you, It happened January of 97. I

immigrated</B>
<P><B>to the states seven years ago. I was born in England and used to

attend</B>
<P><B>Spiritual Churches.</B>
<P><B>The reason for this, my Mother died when I turned thirteen and I did

not</B>
<P><B>get to say goodbye or tell her I loved her. Just before her passing.

my</B>
<P><B>Mother told me to go and find my natural Father. (I forgot to ask his</B>
<P><B>name). With help from my family, I got his name and some history.</B>
<P><B>Where I live, there are none of these Churches, some law thing.</B>
<P><B>After many years of searching I found my Father, I thought. </B>
<P><B>We got on real well for a while, then his new wife gave him a choice,
me or</B>
<P><B>her.</B>
<P><B>He needed his wife and I did not need the proplems.</B>
<P><B>I was going through the Internet and trying to get some free readings,

to</B>
<P><B>help with this new loss of mine.</B>
<P><B>Anyway, I wrote off to a few people and kept hoping.</B>
<P><B>A few days later, I got mail from a well known Lady, who had offered

to</B>
<P><B>help me contact my Mother. (at no charge) This Lady is

Internationally</B>
<P><B>known and very good at what she does. Instead of talking to her through

the</B>
<P><B>Internet, she asked me to call her at home. To which I obliged

happily.</B>
<P><B>We talked for a few minutes and at no time did I give her any details

about</B>
<P><B>my Mom.</B>
<P><B>I was asked to concentrate and focus on one thing in my home and the

Lady</B>
<P><B>would call for my Mother and ask her to come to us.</B>
<P><B>I was told to call for my Mother, but a little while later, I was

still</B>
<P><B>having proplems.</B>
<P><B>The Lady said she would do it for me. </B>
<P><B>After about two minutes, my Mom was with us. I knew this, because I

could</B>
<P><B>sense her being there. I asked her a few questions and they were

answered</B>
<P><B>for me. </B>
<P><B>(not through the Lady, directly to me) The Lady then told me my

Mothers</B>
<P><B>name and what she looked like. I was hysterical by now as you could</B>
<P><B>imagine, not only could I talk with my Mom, I knew she was by my side,

in</B>
<P><B>the same room as me.</B>
<P><B>We talked some more and then the Lady told me that Mom wanted to talk
to me</B>
<P><B>on my own, without her on the phone. I said no, in case I lost contact

with</B>
<P><B>Mom.</B>
<P><B>Then I heard the Lady ask my Mom why she had never gone home to be

with</B>
<P><B>God.</B>
<P><B>My Moms reply.. Iam so worried for my daughter, I know what she has

been</B>
<P><B>through and I have never wanted to leave her side. I have always been

with</B>
<P><B>her.</B>
<P><B>This made me cry even more, I felt sad for my Mom. Twenty years of
being on</B>
<P><B>this plane and not going home to meet God.</B>
<P><B>The Lady told me that I had to tell my Mom to leave and go home and

make</B>
<P><B>peace with God, to be with Him. How could I, I have now got my Mom
back, I</B>
<P><B>was not about to send her away. I would never get to talk to her

again.</B>
<P><B>There was no way I was going to do this. The Lady said I should, but

I</B>
<P><B>could ask for her to return to me, when she had done being with God

and</B>
<P><B>getting peace.</B>
<P><B>This seemed pretty fair and I felt that Mom was happy about it too.
      	</B>
<P><B>I asked Mom not to leave when the Lady did, I wanted to spend a little

more</B>
<P><B>time with her and Mom wanted the same thing. I thanked the Lady whole</B>
<P><B>heartedly and promised I would do as she asked of me. </B>
<P><B>Mom and I talked for a while, then I told Mom to go home to God, but

to</B>
<P><B>come back to me when she had seen Him and made peace. This broke my

heart,</B>
<P><B>I felt like I was once again losing my Mom. But I knew it was the

right</B>
<P><B>thing to do for her.</B>
<P><B>I told her again I loved her and missed her so much, Mom told me the

same.</B>
<P><B>When Mom was about to leave, I shouted for her to stop. It was tearing

me</B>
<P><B>apart.</B>
<P><B>Mom, will you hold me one more time, put your arms around me and just

hold</B>
<P><B>me.</B>
<P><B>Mom came at me and I felt her arms around me. I felt all the love she

has</B>
<P><B>for me and how happy she was to be able to do this. I was so happy,

but</B>
<P><B>still real sad, because I was wishing she was still here in body.</B>
<P><B>I guess Mom felt this and she held me even tighter, the warmth from
her was</B>
<P><B>over- whelming. I could now feel her face on mine and it felt like
she was</B>
<P><B>wiping my tears with her face, her skin was so soft. Was this really</B>
<P><B>happening ? as God is my witness, my Mom was really there with me and</B>
<P><B>holding me with all her might.</B>
<P><B>I honestly felt everything. Then as Mom was leaving, I felt her hand

slide</B>
<P><B>down my arm, (my hair stood up as this happened- not because I was

scared)</B>
<P><B>then her fingers was holding mine. Then Mom was gone, I love you Mom,

I</B>
<P><B>love you so much, please come back soon. I love you, Goodbye. I felt

her</B>
<P><B>smile and happiness. I love you too baby girl. (what mom called me
in her</B>
<P><B>living years)</B>
<P><B>Then there was nothing. I walked around with my arms around my body,
but it</B>
<P><B>did not feel the same as when Mom was holding me. The tears falling

so</B>
<P><B>freely and fast.</B>
<P><B>I hope she does come back, soon. I got to tell her I loved her and
I said</B>
<P><B>Goodbye.</B>
<P><B>I was now happy. Thank you Lady on the Internet, you made my dream

come</B>
<P><B>true.</B>
<P><B>You are a very special person and I will be eternaly grateful to you.

Thank</B>
<P><B>you for My Angel, My Mom........    </B>

<H3><A NAME=coffee>Grandpa's Last Cup of Coffee</A>
</H3><P><B>by teddy_d@hotmail.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My maternal grandmother was a practical, down-to-earth woman, having
</B>
<P><B>been in a subsistence farming family throughout her life. If you

didn't</B>
<P><B>grow it, you didn't eat it. If you couldn't trade for it, you didn't
</B>
<P><B>have it. They grew their own food, butchered hogs and chickens, wore</B>
<P><B>clothing made of blue homespun and later from feedsacks, made soap

from</B>
<P><B>ashes and rendered lard, made medicines from the plants that grew

wild.</B>
<P><B>There was never time in her life for fantasy or wishful thinking. And</B>
<P><B>she was religious, having attended the Ozarkian community "meetin'
</B>
<P><B>house" church all her life; she would never 'tell a story'---lying

was</B>
<P><B>seriously evil in her eyes, no matter how small the 'story'.

Neverthe-</B>
<P><B>less, she experienced paranormal phenomena all her life. She took it
</B>
<P><B>in her stride, figuring God was in his heaven, and knew what he was</B>
<P><B>doing, so it was all right by her. In fact, she considered one parti-</B>
<P><B>cular experience to be a sort of gift from God...</B>
<P>
<P><B>I tell you all of this to explain why I am so sure her experience was</B>
<P><B>not a fantasy, or an story made up to make herself feel better. I am
</B>
<P><B>sure that she experienced just what she said she did. She was

probably</B>
<P><B>the most pragmatic and trustworthy person I have ever known.</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I heard her tell this story to my mother, her daughter. She didn't

hide</B>
<P><B>it, nor did she broadcast it. I made sure to be unobtrusive, because
</B>
<P><B>as a youngster(about 12 or 13 at the time), you never knew at what
</B>
<P><B>interesting point in a conversation they might notice you listening,
</B>
<P><B>consider the subject to be unsuitable, and ask you to leave. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Grandma and Grandpa had been married since they were very young--they

</B>
<P><B>had been together all their lives. They were in their 70's,I believe,</B>
<P><B>when grandpa died.</B>
<P>
<P><B>They had eaten breakfast, then grandpa headed to the front porch like

</B>
<P><B>he always did. Grandma would clean up in the kitchen, make a fresh
</B>
<P><B>pot of coffee, and join him on the front porch to talk and pass the</B>
<P><B>morning together. </B>
<P>
<P><B>As he left the table, grandma asked grandpa if there was anything

else</B>
<P><B>he wanted. "Just a cup of coffee," was his reply, and he headed

through</B>
<P><B>the small house to the porch. Before he got there, he fell to the

floor,</B>
<P><B>dead. The doctor told grandma there was nothing she could have done:

he</B>
<P><B>was dead before he fell. But grandma still worried.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Of course it was hard for her---she missed him terribly, and felt </B>
<P><B>bad that she never even got to say a final 'goodbye' or 'I love you'.</B>
<P><B>But that is not what bothered her the most. She was worried and

upset;</B>
<P><B>for some perverse reason, she couldn't forgive herself for not</B>
<P><B>fulfilling his final wish--for a cup of coffee. Somehow, to her, that</B>
<P><B>was a promise to a dying person, and she felt very guilty over not

be-</B>
<P><B>ing able to carry it out. She was a reasonable person, but this

nagged</B>
<P><B>at her night and day. She couldn't shake the feeling that she had

done</B>
<P><B>something unloving and irresponsible.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One night, several months after grandpa's death, she was laying in

bed,</B>
<P><B>going over it all again, wishing she could have somehow given him

that</B>
<P><B>last cup of coffee he wanted, when in he walked. Grandma said she </B>
<P><B>wasn't frightened at all, but a little startled. She said her first</B>
<P><B>thought was a sinking feeling that maybe he didn't make it to heaven</B>
<P><B>all right; he seemed to be able to know what she was thinking, and
</B>
<P><B>assured her all was well, but that he was worried about how she was</B>
<P><B>worried over the cup of coffee. She said she got out of bed, made a</B>
<P><B>pot of coffee and took it out to the front porch, where they sat</B>
<P><B>and talked things out.</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B> She said it seemed they talked for hours and hours, but</B>
<P><B>eventually, he told her it was time for him to go. Before she even
</B>
<P><B>asked the question, he said, no, he wouldn't be able (or wouldn't be</B>
<P><B>allowed, I'm not exactly sure which) to come back and visit any more,</B>
<P><B>but that he would be waiting for her.</B>
<P>
<P><B>She woke the next morning, thinking what a strange, realistic dream

she</B>
<P><B>had had---until she went out to the porch and saw two chairs pulled

up</B>
<P><B>and TWO COFFEE CUPS.</B>
<P>
<P><B>She never worried about that final cup of coffee again. </B>
<P>
<P><B>I believe it happened. I just can't see the woman I described to</B>
<P><B>you as unstable enough to sit on the porch talking to herself</B>
<P><B>all night and drinking a pot of coffee out of two cups, can you?</B>

<H3><A NAME=me>Watching Me</A>
</H3><P><B>by Tattoos9@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P>      <B>First of all my parents house was finished the same month I was
born, so basically it is a fairly new home. It all started when i was about
14 (I am now 21). I slept like the dead back then, and nothing could wake
me, not even my sisters shaking me.  </B>
<P><B>     Well for some reason one summer I decided to sleep in the basement,

(which is where I usually spent most of my summer days, because it was cooler).

Mind you, I was never afraid of the basement, that is untill that summer.
I would sleep on the pull-out couch bed, and I usually slept on my right
side, so the wet-bar would be located directly behind me. Well, thie first
night i slept down there I awoke suddenly, at about 2:00 a.m. and I had this

intense feeling of being watched. I could tell, for some unknown reason that
this was a male watching me. And "he" had this terrible hatred towards me,
at first I couldn't move, most likely parylized by fear. But I could never
get up the courage to look behind me, because "he" was just dareing me to
turn around, but I knew as soon as I did he would do harm to me. </B>
<P><B>     I don't know why but for the rest of that summer I still slept
in the basement, and "he" always showed up at the same time. To this day
I refuse to go into the basement alone, and I am the only one that this

particular Ghost has bothered. The reason I say that is because my little
brother who is 13, has had his own experience in the basement. There is now
a pool table on the west side and the couches on the east side of the basement.

There is a T.V. that sits directly in the center of the pool table and the

couches, and the back of the T.V. faces north. Well, my brother and a few
of his friends were playing pool, when they were finished they put the remainder

of the balls into the pockets, and sat down to watch T.V. Mind you the pool
table is no more than a foot away. When they were done watching T.V. they
all got up and proceeded to run upstairs, but my brother noticed something

different, all the balls were on the table. None of his friends heard anything,

that scared them to death and they all ran outside terrified. But I think
this ghost is a friendly one, and was just playing a trick on the boys. There
are several other experiences that have gone on in the circle that my parents

live in, and all of them in the thier basements, the only solution i can
come up with is that the site in which the circle is located used to be a

graveyard, that has long since been forgotten. But I still am very sensitive
to the paranormal, everywhere I go there are ghosts, whether it by work or
home. </B>
<P><B>Thank you for taking the time to read this. These are both true stories.

And I invite any comments.....</B>

<H3><A NAME=unusual>Unusual Phenomena</A>
</H3><P><B>by &nbsp;royalv@planetc.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>This isn't a Ghost story, but it is one of some very unusual

phenomena,</B>
<P><B>witnessed by more than just myself and it is all true.</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>It was Christmas day and we were making the rounds, visiting family</B>
<P><B>members and exchanging gifts. The last stop was my Grandfather's

house.</B>
<P><B>As my parents played cards with my Grandfather and his second wife,

my</B>
<P><B>brother and I were watching the Television. The news had come on, the</B>
<P><B>lead story was of a small local store that had burnt down as well as

the</B>
<P><B>home attached. All family members were assumed dead. It wasn't until

I</B>
<P><B>recognized the new telephone booth that I realized that it was our

home,</B>
<P><B>our store that had burnt to the ground. </B>
<P>
<P><B>This was devastating to my family, as we not only lost our home, but

the</B>
<P><B>only source of income as well. I was especially hurt and angry. I

took</B>
<P><B>it personal. The home burning on a holiday, at that time, an insult.</B>
<P><B>One night, weeks later, as I lay trying to sleep, crying over the

death</B>
<P><B>of our dog, whom we'd had for 9 years, I begged God to allow me to
go</B>
<P><B>back and say goodbye to the home and dog I so dearly loved. I also</B>
<P><B>insisted that if there were a God, surely He couldn't be that all

good</B>
<P><B>and loving if he took my home on Christmas, I demanded proof of His</B>
<P><B>existance. Like I said, fifteen years old and really angry.</B>
<P>
<P><B>That night I dreamt that I returned to the store, the door was black

and</B>
<P><B>burnt. As I pushed the door open, it slowly returned to it's pre-fire</B>
<P><B>appearance. Shiny and new. I made my goodbyes, lingered over family</B>
<P><B>heirlooms that I sorely missed, held my dog and let her know I loved</B>
<P><B>her. I left the way I came, pushing the shiny door open and watching

it</B>
<P><B>return to the blackened husk it was when I first approached. (mind

you,</B>
<P><B>in reality there was no door left standing) I felt at peace when I

woke</B>
<P><B>up, feeling as if my wish had been granted. I heard my father yelling</B>
<P><B>that he smelled smoke and rushing around the apartment trying to find</B>
<P><B>the source. I assured him that my room was fine and went to the</B>
<P><B>bathroom. Rubbing my eyes to get the sleep out and trying to retain

that</B>
<P><B>wonderful feeling from the dream, I went and looked in the

mirror..where</B>
<P><B>I had touched my face was covered in soot. I smelled like smoke. My</B>
<P><B>hands looked as if I had pressed them flat against black ashes. I was

in</B>
<P><B>shock, I walked out of the bathroom and stood in front of my father,

who</B>
<P><B>was now accusing me of causing the smoke smell, just freaked out of

my</B>
<P><B>mind. There was no physical way for me to get to the site of the

store</B>
<P><B>that had burnt, no fires or ashes or anything that had been burnt in

the</B>
<P><B>apartment. My mother came out and saw the soot and black ashes on my</B>
<P><B>face and hands, so I was not the only person to witness this

phenomena.</B>
<P><B>I explained to her my dream and continued to return to the mirror to

see</B>
<P><B>if this was real. I ended up washing it off, so it was not an</B>
<P><B>"apparition" or psychosomatic, it was black soot.</B>
<P>
<P><B>For days afterward, everywhere I went, every single person that came</B>
<P><B>near me complained of the smell of smoke. I couldn't shake it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Some time after that, when we were digging thru the remains of the

home</B>
<P><B>trying to find something, anything that had survived we found only

this;</B>
<P><B>a bible and the cover to my album, "Jesus Christ Superstar".</B>
<P>
<P><B>I know this isn't a "ghost" story, and it has some pretty serious</B>
<P><B>religious overtones. Allow me to state that my family has never

attended</B>
<P><B>church and to this day none of us are connected to any organized</B>
<P><B>religion. But, I do have my answer, my proof and I did get my wish.
I</B>
<P><B>got to say goodbye.</B>

<H3><A NAME=virginia>Williamsburg, Virginia</A>
</H3><P><B>by artforms@scvgvine.com</B>
<P>
<P><B> My story is simple but needs a lot of introduction so please</B>
<P><B>bare with me.  It happened in Williamsburg, Virginia on April 9, 1995

at</B>
<P><B>a place called Magazine.  Part of the reason why I am writing this
is to</B>
<P><B>find someone else who has had experiences at the Magazine.  The</B>
<P><B>building was built in 1715.  One of only a hand fool of original</B>
<P><B>Colonial buildings it is in the heart of Colonial Williamsburg.  I

lies</B>
<P><B>directly across the Governors mansion on Main Street.  My High School</B>
<P><B>Choir was visiting the town for the day and being a history buff I

had</B>
<P><B>to see it.  I had two friends with me, Joe and Michelle.  The

buillding</B>
<P><B>was simple.  Three stories with the top story closed off.  Each story</B>
<P><B>only a single room with a spiral staircase connecting them.  Out side</B>
<P><B>the building was a simple wall with a small post for a guard.</B>
<P><B>            I wrote our simple experience in a letter to my current</B>
<P><B>fiance that night when we got back to our Hotel in Washington D.C.

 This</B>
<P><B>is the letter as I wrote it that night after I couldn't sleep.  The

time</B>
<P><B>was very early on April 10, but I wrote April 9 since it seemed the

same</B>
<P><B>day.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Dear Buggy,                                     April 9, 1995</B>
<P>
<P><B>            Today we went to Williamsburg where William and Mary's</B>
<P><B>College was built in 1693.  Joe, Michelle, and I went into a place</B>
<P><B>called Magazine that was built in 1715.  Joe and I where by the

stairs</B>
<P><B>of the second floor and Michelle was looking at something.  Joe and
I</B>
<P><B>heard someone quickly walking up the stairs.  The next second

Michelle</B>
<P><B>comes over and Joe and I walk down the spiral stairs so we would be

out</B>
<P><B>of the way of the person coming up the stairs but we never saw

anyone.</B>
<P><B>It wasn't until later in a restaurant that I menchioned it to Joe and

he</B>
<P><B>said that he heard it to.  We realized then that we never heard the</B>
<P><B>walking go back down, and when we got to the first floor there was
no</B>
<P><B>one there nore was there anyone outside.</B>
<P><B>            Last night while I was taking a shower and I heard

someone</B>
<P><B>say a few words inside the bathroom while everyone was asleep.  When

I</B>
<P><B>got out of the bathroom Joe had been asleep for a while and took up

the</B>
<P><B>whole bed so I grabbed a pillow and went to go to sleep on the floor.

 I</B>
<P><B>could see the light from the hall in the crack of the door and it</B>
<P><B>started to get smaller and smaller till it got to half it's size.

 Then</B>
<P><B>I got really scared and dug my head into my pillow.  In the morning
I</B>
<P><B>woke up in my had with the pillow which is not where I fell a sleep.

 We</B>
<P><B>are in 404.  Ryan ------ is in 406.  The night before last he fell
a</B>
<P><B>sleep in a choir and woke up on the other side of the room with a

pillow</B>
<P><B>and blanket.  In 408 She an ------- feel asleep on his covers and

woke</B>
<P><B>up in under the blankets even though he had all his clothes on and

has</B>
<P><B>never done anything like that before.</B>
<P>
<P><B>                        Ich liebe dich,</B>
<P><B>                        Dale L. Sheldon</B>
<P>
<P><B>            That is the letter that I wrote.  It is a little sketchy</B>
<P><B>because it had to be short.  It is written on two small post cards.</B>
<P><B>Although most people said that it was the heater that I heard in the</B>
<P><B>shower it's hard for me to say that the is true.  I sure sounded like</B>
<P><B>someone talking to me.  At the time the hotel was under heavy</B>
<P><B>renovations and people where saying that it was going bankrupt and

may</B>
<P><B>be torn down in a few months.  I don't know if it is still there. 
I</B>
<P><B>can't even remember what it was called anymore.  The voice in the</B>
<P><B>bathroom just seemed so real to me.  The shower could have muffled

the</B>
<P><B>sound of the heater so that my imagination went away with me.  The

light</B>
<P><B>of the hall may be explained simple because I was so tired and my

eyes</B>
<P><B>where playing tricks on me.  Although non of the people who woke up

in</B>
<P><B>different places where they went to sleep had never had such a thing</B>
<P><B>happen to them before, since they were in a new place you never know.</B>
<P><B>The main thing that I can't explain was the Magazine building.  That

was</B>
<P><B>real.  There was no one anywhere when we went down the only stairs

going</B>
<P><B>up to the second floor but there had to be.  I hadn't been a second</B>
<P><B>before that we heard the person walk up the stairs.</B>
<P><B>            I would like to add that I have been very good at saying

how</B>
<P><B>things used to be centuries ago.  In Annapolis, there is a building

that</B>
<P><B>I assumed was used to make ships.  Now the building is an ice rink

and</B>
<P><B>cafe.  A friend and I were saying that the entire area had ounce been</B>
<P><B>covered by water.  We asked the tour guide and we were right.  We

were</B>
<P><B>right about a lot of other things to that I am not going to go into</B>
<P><B>detail about.  To me the sound at the Magazine building was made by
a</B>
<P><B>young man of about 25 years of ago.  he had dark hair and dark eyes.

 He</B>
<P><B>had simple cloths on and was tired but in a hurry to get something.
 I</B>
<P><B>have a feeling he never got it, he was shot on the stairs.  Maybe he

was</B>
<P><B>an English soldier that ordered to destroy the building but I don't</B>
<P><B>belive that to be true.  I think it was something far more subtle

that</B>
<P><B>no one was ever supposed to find out about and that no one did.  He</B>
<P><B>wants people to know.  I have not ready any history about the

magazine</B>
<P><B>other than the date when it was built.  If anyone has had any similar</B>
<P><B>experiences or any experiences at all dealing with the magazine

building</B>
<P><B>I would greatly appreciate then help.</B>

<H3><A NAME=family>My Family's Experiences</A>
</H3><P><B>by spau@netcom.ca </B>
<P>
<P><B>I am a 30 years old technical professional and like many technical</B>
<P><B>people, I prefer to explain thing logically, but what I am going to

tell</B>
<P><B>you is beyond any logical explanation. These are my family

experience,</B>
<P><B>not mine.These are the real things.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My family, especially on my father side, has been encountering

ghostly</B>
<P><B>experience over the years and I was told these stories that make me</B>
<P><B>scared but at the same time I would like to be the one who

experienced</B>
<P><B>them. The descriptions are very short because I don't remember the</B>
<P><B>details, just the jest of the stories.</B>
<P>
<P><B>1 st encounter (according to my memory)</B>
<P>
<P><B>My grandparents used to live in an old building in Hong Kong, it was</B>
<P><B>built before the second world war. They moved into this unit in this</B>
<P><B>building a few years after the war ended (after the japanese invasion

of</B>
<P><B>the land). Like many old building built around the war time, it had

long</B>
<P><B>hallway and dark corners. My aunt (my father's younger sister) told

me</B>
<P><B>they always got this old chill in their bathroom which was very small</B>
<P><B>compared with western standard. They always felt there was a presence</B>
<P><B>there, and they never spent more than a few minutes there (even for
a</B>
<P><B>shower). </B>
<P>
<P><B>Second encounter:</B>
<P>
<P><B>Another encounter was thi bright light suddenly appeared in the

kitchen,</B>
<P><B>like an explosion. According to what I was told, the light was seen

from</B>
<P><B>one end of the long hallway and the kitchen is on another hallway.
It</B>
<P><B>lasted a second or so, but it was observable. When my grandparents

went</B>
<P><B>inside the kitchen and checked, there was nothing and nobody. The</B>
<P><B>location of the kitchen was not at a place where bright sunlight

would</B>
<P><B>shine through. The light was certainly not a reflection and more than

a</B>
<P><B>bright light similar to a nuclear explosion, there was no sound.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Third encounter:</B>
<P>
<P><B>But the more scary one would be this crying sound coming out from the</B>
<P><B>wall at one of the dark corners. At around 12am most nights, the

sound</B>
<P><B>came out from the wall. I forgot whether it was a male or female

sound</B>
<P><B>but it was definitely a human crying sound. My uncle's bed was

opposite</B>
<P><B>to this wall. Surprisingly ,my uncle got angry instead of being

scared,</B>
<P><B>he used to shout at the wall or threw one of his slippers at it,

saying</B>
<P><B>"Shut up" (in Chinese of course), then the sound would stop.</B>
<P><B>But he got very frustrated doing this almost every night.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Several years after, they moved to another building and again built</B>
<P><B>around the war time. On one of this Chinese halloween nights, when</B>
<P><B>families are burning stuff (for-the-dead-money, paper cars and house,

it</B>
<P><B>is a tradition for the deads, hoping the dead ones get them on the

other</B>
<P><B>side) for their love ones on the street, there was one such ceremony</B>
<P><B>right at the entrance to the building where my grandparents lived.</B>
<P><B>Around 12am, everyone was retired in their rooms and suddenly, all
of</B>
<P><B>them heard this crying noise of a man running across the long hallway</B>
<P><B>which ran through the length of the unit , there was windows in the</B>
<P><B>living room which was one end of the hallway and the other end would

be</B>
<P><B>the balcony. The dog was barking very loudly as this noise was

running</B>
<P><B>from one end to another end. Everyone came out from their rooms which</B>
<P><B>ran along the length of the hallway.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Fourth Encounter:</B>
<P>
<P><B>This happened to my aunt (my father eldest sister). When she was</B>
<P><B>preparing dinner in the small kitchen, she suddenly felt a cold chill</B>
<P><B>coming from her back, she turned and then saw this woman watching

her,</B>
<P><B>like many chinese ghosts (my impression with all stories that I

heard),</B>
<P><B>you can see the face, not fog or just shape, chinese ghosts usually

have</B>
<P><B>very well defined shape, almost like a real person. As an experience</B>
<P><B>person with this sort of thing, my aunt did not care or respond and</B>
<P><B>pretended she was not there, it was believed that if you communicate</B>
<P><B>with the ghost, it will grow attach to you and never leave you alone.</B>
<P>
<P><B>But on one occasion, she got very angry as her cabinet in the kitchen</B>
<P><B>were opening and closing like crazy, she slammed on the kitchen bench

in</B>
<P><B>frustration and said that she had had enough, the whole thing stopped</B>
<P><B>immediately.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I guess my family had a way with ghosts.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Fifth encounter:</B>
<P>
<P><B>In the same place as in encounter four above. While watching TV

behind</B>
<P><B>which was the balcony and where my aunt's dog was, my cousin suddenly</B>
<P><B>jumped and asked my aunt who the person head was, flying around near

the</B>
<P><B>balcony, the dog was barking at the same time. My cousin was very

scared</B>
<P><B>as he could clearly see the blood was dripping from the neck. The

head</B>
<P><B>was floating around. My aunt did not see it this time but believe my</B>
<P><B>cousin right away as her family had been encountering ghostly

experience</B>
<P><B>for years. She tried to calm my cousin, but it was a very scary</B>
<P><B>experience for him.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Sixth encounter:</B>
<P>
<P><B>(Same place as above)</B>
<P>
<P><B>My eldest cousin was sick (he was just a kid at the time)and had been</B>
<P><B>sleeping in the bed. One day (during the day)when my aunt brought in</B>
<P><B>some lunch for him, he asked who this boy was and said he was

drowning,</B>
<P><B>he could see this image near the ceiling. The boy was drowning in

water</B>
<P><B>and seemed to be screaming. Without any disbelieving, my aunt asked

her</B>
<P><B>neighbour who was in the apartment building for a long time, about

any</B>
<P><B>prior incident in the neighbourhood. The building was at a very</B>
<P><B>residential area, not downtown apartment building. </B>
<P>
<P><B>The answer she got was , there was a boy drowned a few year back in

the</B>
<P><B>buiding swimming pool. Well, what else....</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was a kid at this time and spent time in their apartment a lot, but</B>
<P><B>never once I saw anything, I would say now it is a disappointment for</B>
<P><B>me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Seventh Encounter:</B>
<P>
<P><B>My aunt (as above) moved to another buiding with larger living area.

I</B>
<P><B>had been there many times and I did not like it as it was dark even

with</B>
<P><B>a lot of sunlight outside.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One day, as she was doing some dusting around the apartment and was

in</B>
<P><B>her bedroom, she suddenly saw all this fog around the whole apartment,

I</B>
<P><B>would say it was like the Victorian London type of foggy. She smelt

this</B>
<P><B>rodden meat smell,(this was new to her), as she turned back, she saw</B>
<P><B>this giant pair of hairy feet(just the feet, no upper body or head
or</B>
<P><B>anything), walking across the fog which was very close to the floor.</B>
<P><B>then suddenly the feet disappeared. </B>
<P>
<P><B>As the smell thing was new to her, she asked my granddad what would

that</B>
<P><B>be as my granddad was the most experienced with this type of thing.

His</B>
<P><B>reply was "Oh, it was just dead people smell", meaning her apartment

was</B>
<P><B>visited.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Once again, with all the time I spent there, I saw nothing.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Eighth Encounter:</B>
<P>
<P><B>My mum was visiting Taiwan. She was sleeping soundly in her bedroom
in a</B>
<P><B>hotel, until she was awaken suddenly. She then saw this figure in the</B>
<P><B>dark with a giant pair of eyes approaching her, she could not

identify</B>
<P><B>whether it was a man or a woman, as she screamed, my dad got up and</B>
<P><B>turned on the light, nothing there in the room.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Nineth encounter:</B>
<P>
<P><B>At the same place as above. Around 1am, my mum was still up but my

dad</B>
<P><B>was asleep. My mum heard this noise coming from outside the hotel</B>
<P><B>building, she looked out down from her window, she saw a group of

people</B>
<P><B>outside seemed to be having a party, the noise was so loud, it could</B>
<P><B>easily be heard even inside the hotel room. My mum, however, could

not</B>
<P><B>figure out whether it was a group of men or women or both, the image

was</B>
<P><B>so VAGUED,even at this short distance.She did not take any notice and</B>
<P><B>went to bed.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next morning , she asked the management whether there was a party</B>
<P><B>outside last night. The management replied there was no party and</B>
<P><B>certainly not at 1am at night. But the noise was also heard by

several</B>
<P><B>people in the group. Ghosts ?????</B>
<P>
<P><B>Tenth Encounter:</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was visting England with my brother and was staying in one of my</B>
<P><B>families house, it was a modern house. One night, when I was out and

my</B>
<P><B>brother was alone in the house and was sleeping in his room with the</B>
<P><B>door completely closed. He suddenly heard footsteps on the stairs.

They</B>
<P><B>were spiral-shaped stairs running all three floors. The footsteps

were</B>
<P><B>clearly heard and were coming from bottom to top floor and was</B>
<P><B>approching his room on the third floor. My brother thought it was me</B>
<P><B>(the owner was gone for a trip), so he did not care, suddenly he

heard</B>
<P><B>someone was talking outside his room (the foot steps stopped at the

same</B>
<P><B>time, what he heard was someone speaking in Victorian English, it was</B>
<P><B>certainly not modern English. my brother recognised that it was not

my</B>
<P><B>voice, he got a little bit scared. He did not open the door to find

out.</B>
<P>
<P><B>By the time I came back, I asked him what was wrong as his face was</B>
<P><B>white. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Once again, I was there for a year on my own, I never heard or</B>
<P><B>encountered anything.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Finally, Eleven encounter</B>
<P>
<P><B>My brother used to study in a boarding school in the UK. One night,

he</B>
<P><B>was the only one in his domitory (room), suddenly he heard this

female</B>
<P><B>crying noise, it was like she was in pain, a very ugly sound. It

sounded</B>
<P><B>very distance at the beginning but eventually it sounded from

somewhere</B>
<P><B>next to him,like someone whispering at your ear, he got very

frightened</B>
<P><B>and ran.</B>
<P>

<H3><A NAME=piggy>The Piggy Ghosts</A>
</H3><P><B>by satish@intafrica.com </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Hi ,my name is Sharmila, I come from India, a country which is known

for</B>
<P><B>its mystic past. That it one of the reasons I decided to send this

story</B>
<P><B>here.</B>
<P>
<P><B>It was one of my maternal grandfather's hobbies to scare his

grandchildren</B>
<P><B>with TRUE ghost stories. When I was young I listened to them with

wide-eyed</B>
<P><B>respect, but it is just recently that I have stopped believing in them.

The</B>
<P><B>latest story which he told me was so weird, that even U would fall
off your</B>
<P><B>seats laughing.(That was the same thing which I did.)</B>
<P>
<P><B>Grandpa said that when HE was young, he used to live in a village.
Once, he</B>
<P><B>was walking with his friends on a full-moon night, at about (gulp!)

12.00</B>
<P><B>am when he heard the grunt of a pig.Now, pigs were quite familiar in

his</B>
<P><B>village, so he did not pay much attention. The noises seemed to come

from</B>
<P><B>behind him. But when the noises got a little   closer AND louder, he

simply</B>
<P><B>had to turn back.And ooh!!! What a "tooweet" sight! He saw a Mother

pig</B>
<P><B>walking with her piglings behind her.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Now I know U are laughing! Its funny alright, but not the next part.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We all know that a pig may have a majority of about at least 5-8

piglings</B>
<P><B>no? But this one had Hundreds!! The line of piglings following the

mother</B>
<P><B>did not end! One could go mad counting them.</B>
<P>
<P><B>"Ha ha ha ha.Man its real scary.I don't know if I'll be able to sleep</B>
<P><B>tonight", saying this I got up to go home, leaving Grandpa in a

dejected</B>
<P><B>mood.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I live in Bombay, mind You, not in a village.I was walking home at

about</B>
<P><B>8.00 pm and  I decided to take a shortcut through a large, open,

deserted</B>
<P><B>playground.I walked ,and walked and I heard the grunt of pigs.(Oh no!)

I</B>
<P><B>turned my head back to see the same thing my Grandad hed seen about

40</B>
<P><B>years ago!!!</B>
<P>
<P><B>Please sympathise with me.I'm not joking, I swear. Do U believe

me?I'm</B>
<P><B>always ready for your views on this topic.My address is</B>
