<p><b>haunted prison</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; txgregory@bop.gov</b><b></b>
<p><b>Let me start by giving some background.&nbsp; I worked in a large
maximum security prison in California (I can’t reveal the name or location).&nbsp;
As you can guess, there is a lot of sorrow, negative energy, and outright
evil inside a prison.&nbsp; This particular prison had experienced several
fights, assaults, and killings in it’s time.&nbsp; We had a saying that
****** could go from 0 to insanity in a microsecond. When staff would get
together, the topic of ghosts would always come up.&nbsp; There were several
stories about the place, usually centering around where an inmate had been
killed.&nbsp; Some stories were ludicrous, some really made you stop and
think.&nbsp; I even had a supervisor that would not go into the administrative
building after midnight.&nbsp; I am not what you would call a skeptic,
but as a rule I need to experience something to understand or believe it.&nbsp;
It so happened that my office was on the third floor of the administrative
building.&nbsp; On this particular night, I was working 2 p.m. to 10 p.m..&nbsp;
It was about a quarter to ten when I locked my office and started down
a semi-dark hall.&nbsp; My mind was on several reports that were coming
due and the last thing on my mind were the ghost stories about the administrative
building.&nbsp; It was a fairly warm night and the air conditioner was
keeping the hallway cold enough to “hang meat in”.&nbsp; As I got about
halfway down the hall, I hit a pocket of really warm, moist, dank air.&nbsp;
I also noticed the aroma of sweat, urine, stale tobacco smoke, and an unwashed
body.&nbsp;&nbsp; The sensation was unbelievably revolting and I immediately
broke out in a cold sweat.&nbsp; As quickly as the pocket appeared, it
was gone.&nbsp; My skin prickled and I exited the building rather quickly.&nbsp;
Only later did I realize that the area where I had this sensation was adjacent
to our evidence room.&nbsp; Earlier that afternoon, my assistant and I
had been in that evidence room retrieving the personal property of an inmate
that had been killed about 10 years before.&nbsp; As the inmate had been
killed in his cell, all of his personal property had been placed into the
evidence room.&nbsp; To this day I do not know what that pocket of funk
was or what relation it had to the evidence in that room.</b>

<p><b>my experience..</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; rethagec@msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I once had an experience with a ghost calling out my name. I didn't
see it, but I sure heard it. I was over my grandfather and grandmother's
house. My older sister lives their, her room is in the attic. So I was
in the attic by myself, and no one was home,&nbsp; except me and my grandfather
he was in the living room.&nbsp; So out of no where, I hear a women's voice
call out&nbsp; "Chelsea, come here". I went down stair's to see if my sister
came home, and called for me. No one was home except me and my grandfather.
So I went back to the attic, not thinking it was a ghost till 5 minutes
later I hear "Chelsea come here". I was so scared, I ran down to my grandfather,
on the way down I didn't see no ghosts. I think it might have been in a
bedroom. I told my grandfather I was going home. I never heard nothing
call out my name again, that was the only time.</b><b></b>

<p><b>my grandpa</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; BARXB2@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I'd like to tell you a story that happened to my familly about 3
years ago.&nbsp; My grandpa became ill and was sent to the hospital.&nbsp;
His condition kept getting worse and the doctors told us to spend as much
time with him till the end.&nbsp; Well one night about 10 members of my
familly crowded into his room (including myself). We talked one topic after
another untill grandma mentioned how grandpas dog (husky/wolf) casper kept
getting in the house looking for him and would lay down in the bedroom
looking sad.&nbsp; Well everyone there went silent watching that image
in our minds when suddenly grandpa said "who's taking pictures" we looked
around confused. Again he said "who's taking pictures" in a more demanding
tone.&nbsp; My aunt said nobody. Grandpa then looked at the end of his
bed and his eyes widened slightly and exclaimed "there's casper" pointing.&nbsp;
We didnt see anything. he kept trying to convince us that his dog was there
with him.&nbsp; latter that night after everyone went home grandma called
me and said that casper was acting happy and energetic.&nbsp; We are still
not sure what happened that night.&nbsp; But about two days later grandpa
passed on.</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Fathers Ghost.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>By:&nbsp; i_am_liz6@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Alright...this is a true experiance that happened with me through
ghosts that seem to love to hang out in my house. Well..this one is about
my fathers ghost...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>One night I was getting ready for bed and everyone else at gone
to bed before me..it was about 3 in the morning..I stayed up late on the
computer...well...while getting ready I heard something or someone call
my name..I turned around and looked at the door and saw no one there. So
I shrugged it off and then finished getting ready. As I crawled in to bed,
I heard my name again...I started getting scared and I yelled out " Not
tonight..." And I could feel it approaching me ..I had this vibe there
was someone there. Within moments..my whole room fell in the sent of my
fathers after shave....and on my door I heard two knocks. I knew it was
my dad and when I rubbed my eyes and laid down...I looked over at the door
way, and I saw him...as plain as day..walk right by my door. I knew my
father was still protecting us from harm as I rolled on to my side and
fell asleep.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Some ghost happenings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; Evildragonx4@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have lived in this house that I am in now since 1996 with my mom
and dad. Nothing strange seemed to happen until 2002.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I thought I needed more space so I asked my mom if I could move to
the basement. A few nights after I got moved down in the basement I decided
to watch the 007 moive on. I got bored and turned the TV and lights out
and tried to go to sleep.</b><b></b>
<p><b>About 5 minutes went by and I heard whispers in a corner of the room.
I thought it was my uncles TV. My uncles room is right above mine. I heard
this again and I got a little scared because it was daylight and my mom,
dad and uncle were at work.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Then my bro and his family moved and needed a place to live at. I
traded rooms with him. My bro's girlfriend told me she had heard whispers
and the chilling feeling that someone was watching her.</b><b></b>
<p><b>When my bro and his family are gone, I am over in my room which is
about ten feet from his. Sometimes I'll be reading and I'll here the sound
of a light switch being turned on and when I look to see if he is home,
the lights are out.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Since then I have seen little black figures out of the corner of
my eye and heard someone shout something when I am trying to fall asleep.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Then in early Apirl I slept on the couch because I had to hear the
mailman knock on the door in the morning. When I woke up I was in my bed!</b><b></b>

<p><b>Ghost in the attic</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; farah.khateri@ntlworld.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi my name is jess and i thought i would tell you my story.&nbsp;
Around this time last year i moved into a new house with my husband Daniel
and my 5 year old dughter Scarlett.&nbsp; About 2 weeks after we moved
in we heard strange noises coming from the attic. At first me and my husband
put it down to birds or mice so we got an exterminator to come in and take
a look but he found nothing.&nbsp; A couple of days after this my daughter
woke up in the night and went to the toilet she said that when she walked
past the door that goes up into the attic it started to shake she was so
scared she came crying into me and my husbands room and told us what had
happened.&nbsp; My husband grabbed a torch and went to investigate but
found absolutuly nothing.&nbsp; Over the next few weeks the noises and
the bangs from the attic got worse so one day we put and camera up there.&nbsp;
Me and my husband would go up there every day to check it but for the first
2 days nothing happened then on the third night as we were bed we heard
very loud bangs and voices i was absolutely petrified.&nbsp; In the morning
we checked the video and saw old chairs and books being thrown all over
the place by some invisible force.&nbsp; I was very shocked and told my
husband that i wanted to move but he said no because we love the house
so much.&nbsp; Anyway nearly a year on we do hear noises and bangs but
not so often the ghost doesnt harm us or anything like that so we are happy
for it to stay there.&nbsp; Sorry this is so long.</b>

<br><b>2 stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; jaronby@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I got two stories to tell.</b>
<br><b>The first is about the experience I had with my</b>
<br><b>great-grandmother.</b>
<br><b>I was about nine or ten when she passed. She was in</b>
<br><b>the hospital after my grandmother found her in her</b>
<br><b>appartment. Apparently she severed a stroke.</b>
<br><b>After a couple of more strokes she finally passed.</b>
<br><b>In the time since my grandmother found her she didn't</b>
<br><b>came back to consiousness.</b><b></b>
<p><b>When the time was right the hospital called and the</b>
<br><b>whole family went up there. I was the only one not to</b>
<br><b>attend, I guess also because of age and it was already</b>
<br><b>late at night.</b><b></b>
<p><b>A couple of nights later I woke up in the middle of</b>
<br><b>the night and there was my great-grandmother.</b>
<br><b>She was sitting beside me on the bed, put the cuilt</b>
<br><b>back on me and went. Everything was in a haze of</b>
<br><b>whitish.</b>
<br><b>I told my mother the next morning and she said that</b>
<br><b>probably my great-grandmother came to say goodbuy.</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>The other story is more recent and deals with my</b>
<br><b>grandfather. I emigrated to Israel and since the rest</b>
<br><b>of the family remains in Holland I again wasn't</b>
<br><b>present with my grandfather's passing.</b><b></b>
<p><b>It was a couple of weeks after his passing and I had</b>
<br><b>at that time serious doubts how everything would go in</b>
<br><b>the near future.</b>
<br><b>Again I woke in the night and there was my grandfather</b>
<br><b>standing at the end of the bed. I can't remember if he</b>
<br><b>said it or made me feel it, I remember him saying me</b>
<br><b>not to worry and everything will be allright.</b>

<br><b>My Ghostly Encounter</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; dannyvorhees@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Danny Vorhees. I'm a 20 year old paranormal investigator
based in England. I would like to share with you one of the most disturbing
cases I have ever encountered. In my two years as a paranormal investigator,
I have never come across a case which has scared me more.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I live in a small village near London, which is a popular spot for
ghost stories, due to the large amount of public hangings/beheadings etc.
that took place there. One particular place, Pudding Lane, is extremely
famous. 338 years ago, the Great Fire of London broke out in a shop in
this street. And this is where my story begins.</b><b></b>
<p><b>After the fire of course, the street was rebuilt. The houses built
in those days still stand now, and my client, one Mrs Gemma Clarke, lived
in one of them. Mrs Clarke and her family moved in around 5 years ago,
in 1999. Their first year or so in the house was peaceful, but then on
7th August 2000, odd things began to happen.</b><b></b>
<p><b>At first, it was just one or two objects moved every night. A pen
for instance, that had been left next to the pad on the telephone table,
was found in the bedroom of Mrs Clarke's oldest child Leah. Although nobody
could explain this strange happening, the family thought nothing of it.
Bread was also mysteriously taken from the bread bin. Only bread though.
Nothing else in the larder or cupboars was taken.&nbsp; Seven days after
the objects began to move in the night, they stopped. They were replaced
by a faint smell, a curious smell, all throughout the house. I still remember
the smell to this day, a kind of light burning, mixed with the smell of
freshly-baked bread. Strange I know, but it will become apparent later
on.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Strange things were also beginning to happen in Leah's bedroom. The
smell was strongest in this room, still faint, but noticeably stronger.
Light black marks appeared all over her walls, although once rubbed with
a piece of cloth, they vanished easily. Leah was woken virtually every
night to a loud roaring sound. After a few nights of this, Leah moved into
her brother Alex's room.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The strange occurrences didn't follow her, but they continued to
happen</b>
<br><b>in Leah's room. An enormous black mark (which remains there to this
day I believe) appeared on her ceiling, stretching from corner to corner.
Mrs Clarke, admitting there was something strange going on, called local
paranormal investigator Bryan Lewis.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Bryan is one of my good friends. I met him at college, and found
out with great astonishment he was interested in the paranormal as well.
When we left college, we vowed to stay in touch, and we still do. Bryan
and his team (two photographers and a machine operator) spent a night in
Leah's room. All four men were repeatedly dragged out of bed throughout
the night, and all heard the roaring sound Leah had described, accompanied
by a loud crackling. Bryan documented every strange activity, and took
some photographs of the machine operator being dragged out of bed. The
next morning, he gave yours truly a call.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I arrived in the house later that day. After meeting the family and
Bryan's team, I was shown up to Leah's room. The huge black mark was looming
on the ceiling, and the faint smell caught in my nose. We agreed that we
would all spend the night in Leah's room, Leah included. She was reluctant
at first, but after we promised we wouldn't let anything harm her, she
accepted.</b><b></b>
<p><b>That night, we were all dragged out of bed again. I would feel something
cool brush my arm, then I would be lifted clear of my bed and dumped on
the floor. This time, however, I was recording everything. Three hidden
cameras were set up in the room. One in the corner, one peering out from
underneath Leah's bed and one on the door. The roaring sound gradually
grew louder</b>
<br><b>and louder, particularly just before Leah was dragged from her bed.
The</b>
<br><b>roaring sound started to fade, and we were dragged from our beds
less</b>
<br><b>frequently.</b>
<br><b>There was a loud hissing noise, and the roaring stopped completely.</b>
<br><b>Leah rolled over and promptly went to sleep, while we sat and discussed
the</b>
<br><b>night's events.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The next morning, everybody looked tired. After a cup of coffee each,
we all sat down to discuss what had happened. Bryan and his photographers
were sent to the local library to research anything to do with the house.
The machine operator and I went back to Leah's room to take some readings.&nbsp;
We discovered that the area exactly half a metre around Leah's bed was
a huge sixteen degrees colder than the rest of the room. We also discovered
that the camera underneath Leah's bed was totally wrecked, due to the severe
temperature change. On the other two films, however, a dancing wisp of
light could be seen, hovering above everybody in the room.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Bryan returned two hours later with some interesting information.
The house in which we were standing was built near an old bakery. But not
any old bakery. The bakery in which the Great Fire of London started, over
300 years ago.This explained the smell of baking, possibly why the bread
went missing too. The roaring sounds we had all heard the night before
were the roars of flames, the hiss may have been the sound of water extinguishing
the fire.Bryan also learned that one of the maids that lived inside the
bakery had died in the fire, after refusing to climb out onto the roof
to safety. Could this be what was haunting the Clarke family?</b><b></b>
<p><b>We called in the local priest, Reverend Timothy Wighte. He explained
he would try to contact the ghost, and ask it to leave the Clarke family
alone. He set up the table. Everybody took a seat around the table, and
he asked for quiet. Then he called upon the ghost to enter the room. He
asked the ghost two make two knocks if it was within the room. Two loud
knocks echoed around the room, clear as a bell. Leah looked suddenly scared,
but her mother put her arms around her and she buried her face.</b>
<br><b>The Reverend continued to ask the ghost whether she knew Thomas
Farynor, who</b>
<br><b>was the owner of the bakery. Again, two loud knocks could be heard.</b>
<br><b>Then the Reverend asked the question:</b>
<br><b>"Are you the ghost of the maid who died in the fire?"</b><b></b>
<p><b>There was a pause, and then two knocks. The Reverend looked over
at Mrs Clarke, and she nodded. The Reverend continued to ask the ghost
to leave the family alone. He said they would gladly share their home,
and they might all live together happily. He asked whether the ghost would
like that, and was answered with two knocks. The Reverend looked at the
family, and smiled. For the first time since I had met the Clarke's, they
smiled.</b><b></b>
<p><b>To this day, there have been no reports of disturbances in that house,
or any other house on Pudding Lane. The Clarke's, I believe, still live
in that house. They all remember what happened, although they wish they
didn't. I send them the occasional letter to see how they are holding up,
Bryan does too.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I can't explain why this case scares me. Out of all the cases I have
ever been involved in, why should I say this is the one that scares me
most?</b>
<br><b>The answer to that one, I don't know. But I have to say that being
dragged out</b>
<br><b>of bed at two in the morning by something you can't see might just
have had something to do with it.</b><b></b>

<p><b>My ghost story...by Midnights_misty_moon</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; midnights_misty_moon@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello to all,&nbsp; My name is midnights_misty_moon and ever since
i was a little girl, i started experiencing paranormal stuff.&nbsp; I am
what you call a ghost magnet.&nbsp; I can sense things when they are there
and usually i can tell if its male or female man, woman or child.&nbsp;
I have come across many spectral ghosts in my lifetime.&nbsp; Some are
good and some have been very bad.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dont know that i could ever help a spirit
but i know how to keep them at bay away from me and my children.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have the ability to see spirits, I have
had them to touch me and call my name.&nbsp; When i was a little girl,
you can only imagine that this terrified me to death.&nbsp; I thought i
was crazy.&nbsp;&nbsp; As i got older, however, i learned to accept what
it is that i have.&nbsp; I know when someone is going to die in my family
and even strangers.&nbsp; I have learned however that sometimes its best
not to say this to others because they just dont beleive.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mom has the gift, as does my sister
and my grandmother and both of my greatgrandmothers have the gift.&nbsp;
So i guess you could say it runs in the family too.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; It affects mostly the women in my family although some
of the men in our family have the gift but they dont see it for what it
is.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, my earliest memories are the house
that we lived in.&nbsp; Here in south georgia, there are a lot of confederate
graves of unknown soldiers and im sure there are northerners planted here
too...We also have a lot of indian burial grounds.&nbsp; My interest is
also in Native Americans.&nbsp; I have Cherokee and creek in my family.&nbsp;
I use to love to collect arrowheads.&nbsp; I have a great collection that
is until they seem to disappear, i only have one left todate.&nbsp; I was
always finding them.&nbsp; The strange thing is that i begin to see weird
things that i didnt understand.&nbsp; I would hear children crying, I would
always hear someone in our house and outside as well.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I seen strange eyes out of my bedroom window
that seemed to glow.&nbsp; It always scared me to death.&nbsp; There would
be someone scratching someone outside my window and i would usually end
up scaring my mom to death and she would take a flashlight and go outside
and there was no one there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the land where we lived which my parents
owned, it was given to my mom by her stepfather.&nbsp; Every house that
had been on that plot of the land, the houses always burned down.&nbsp;
I had dreams of our house burning down.&nbsp; It always scared me, because
i felt like i was really there.&nbsp; I could feel the heat and feel the
walls coming down.&nbsp; I kept telling my mom that our house would burn
down someday.&nbsp; She said that was not going to happen...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I started having these dreams of
this woman, she was standing in the house and she was pounding her fists
on the windown screaming.&nbsp; She had long brown hair and was wearing
a white dress.&nbsp; Well we had a long road that we had to walk down to
get to the school bus.&nbsp; One morning in particuliar, i had to walk
down the road by myself because my brother was sick.&nbsp; I started walking
and i heard someone call my name, i turned and looked around, I noticed
at the end of our driveway, I could see mist swirling upwards and fog started
rolling in.&nbsp; I started getting scared.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then a woman appeared before me, she was
the woman in my dreams....I froze with fear...I couldnt move.&nbsp; She
pointed at me and then pointed at our house and shook her head no over
and over again...I finally ran screaming back to our house and my mom said
there was no woman there and she made me go back down the road.&nbsp; I
seen this woman quite frequently...I told my mom about her because i kept
on seeing her and she thought for a moment and said it sounded like her
cousin who committed suicide and a long time ago she use to live in a house
that sat on that plot of land.&nbsp; My mom showed me a picture and asked
me if that was her and i said yes it was.&nbsp; Her name was Joanne and
she was my mom's cousin who killed herself, she was very young when she
died.&nbsp; She killed herself because she had a lot of health problems,
she was 20 years old or so. bsp; I asked my mom why would she be appearing
to me and my mom said that perhaps she couldnt let go because of what she
did.&nbsp; Well the dreams continued. as i got older the dream seem to
go away.&nbsp; Well the night before my high school graduation, I had the
dream again and again Joanne appeared to me and told me that our house
was going to burn down...I said ok ill be sure to get my things out and
thats exactly what i did and i told my mom and dad oh the house is going
to be on fire, just thought i would let you know because i have myself
have no intention of staying here if that is going to happen...Of course
my dad told me that i was crazy and my mom said i was over reacting...well
i had my graduation the next day that evening...after the graduation i
went out with my boyfriend at the time.&nbsp; We were partying and celebrating
have a good time.&nbsp; Then as we were driving down the road, i big fiery
flash went over our car and something exploded and these flames appeared
to me and i could see our house on fire.&nbsp; I could feel the heat and
i started screaming no no no, my boyfriend asked me what the hell was wrong
with me and i said our house is on fire and he said you are crazy, it seemed
everyone was always telling me i was crazy and i said ok damn it, ill prove
it to you so we went out to my house and sure enough our house was on fire
burning down to the ground.&nbsp; I freaked out naturally i remembered
the woman in the dream but my mom was there and my sister was safe, so
i took it to be that my moms cousin Joanne was trying to warn me that our
house would burn up and for me not to be in it when it did happen and for
that i am thankful.&nbsp; Believe it or not...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So since that time, my gift of second
sight has gotten to become more so.&nbsp; I can sense how&nbsp; a person
is within the first ten minutes of meeting them.&nbsp; I can sense danger
and i can sense if that person is going to harm me or not...also if i go
to someone's house, i can sense if something is there or not.&nbsp; I can
see ghosts in photos and near certain objects.&nbsp; One time i had one
to get in bed with me and let me tell you ok that was unnerving...My dog
went nuts and chased it out, i could see the imprint it left on the bed.&nbsp;
As long as my dog was in my room it didnt bother me and it didnt bother
my kids as long as they were sleeping in the room they were in eventually
i had to sleep in the same room with them because the spirit didnt seem
to want to go into that room.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Another time i had some children over of my cousins
and they were eating in my dining room and they all came out screaming
saying that my table had lifted and started shaking and when i went in
there the table was against the wall not where i had put it so i knew they
were telling the truth...ive got so much to tell you about what ive experienced,
i should write a book....anyway happy reading and if you have a bad spirit
you dont want in your room put salt across the threshold and make a invisible
doorway, they wont be able to get through....later midnight</b><b></b>

<br><b>My father-in-law</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; lharrington@bozzuto.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My father-in-law passed away in October 1997.&nbsp; He had 13 children
and many friends and relatives who loved him dearly.&nbsp; He was a marine
and a master electrician who had a tough exterior, but was one of the kindest
and dearest people I have had the pleasure of knowing.&nbsp; The funeral
was probably the largest I have ever seen.&nbsp; My eldest daughter was
espeically close to him and was so saddened by his death that we worried
about her emotional state for quite some time.&nbsp; She said that he promised
to dance the first dance with her at her wedding.&nbsp; She was only 13
when he died, and felt upset and betrayed when he "left."</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>At the funeral service at the church, my husband, so very grief-stricken,
prayed to his father to show him some sort of sign that he was with him.&nbsp;
Suddenly, a large flock of birds emerged from a small tree outside of the
church and flew off into the distance.&nbsp; My husband felt that was his
sign.&nbsp; Now, when my&nbsp; husband talks to his father through prayer,
he sees a bird or birds that fly before him.&nbsp; When my eldest daughter
graduated from high school in 2002, before the graduates filed in, all
of the seats were empty.&nbsp; There was a bird that caught the attention
of my husband, his brother and I.&nbsp; It was flying around in the auditorium
and it landed on a chair and remained there until the graduates filed in.&nbsp;
My daughter sat in the chair that the bird had landed on.&nbsp; There were
several cousins that graduated after her and the bird has shown up at the
ceremony every year since then.&nbsp; I'm sure he'll be at my youngest
daughter's graduation in 2005.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Also, about a month after he passed away, our phone rang around
3:00 a.m.&nbsp; It was dark, and I reached over and answered the phone,
but there was nothing but static on the other end.&nbsp; I figured it was
just a prank or a bad connection, so I hung up.&nbsp; The next morning,
I checked the Caller ID to see where the call came from and it said "Fort
Lincoln Cemetery," which is where my father-in-law is buried.&nbsp; It
happened again about a week later, with the same static and the same info
on the Caller ID.&nbsp; My husband just said, "Hi, Dad," and the calls
never came again.&nbsp; But we still see birds when we think of him.&nbsp;
And I know he'll be dancing with my daughter when she gets married.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; schmeisj@mscd.edu</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have always noticed strange things going on at my house, but the
only</b>
<br><b>time anything strange ever happend was only in one room of my parents</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; It was my old room when I was in middle school and
high school.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Well one night when I was sleeping I woke up around 3:00 am
and saw a</b>
<br><b>little boy sitting in my closet next to my laundry basket.&nbsp;
I didn't</b>
<br><b>really think anything of it, I thought I was dreaming or just seeing</b>
<br><b>something.&nbsp; I didn't think anything of it until another night,
I fell</b>
<br><b>asleep with my TV on and I woke up again around 3:00 am and when
I woke</b>
<br><b>up I heard someone who I thought was my sister scream my name, it</b>
<br><b>sounded like it was coming from the basment.&nbsp; Right when I
sat up to</b>
<br><b>see what was wrong my tv shut off.&nbsp; I was really scared and
turned the</b>
<br><b>TV back on and laid in my bed with my blankets over my body and</b>
<br><b>couldn't move.&nbsp; Then, what sound like a gust of wind, blew
over my</b>
<br><b>right ear and my TV shut off again.&nbsp; I turned my TV back on
and when it</b>
<br><b>shut off again, I heard a voice in my ear saying "dead people, dead</b>
<br><b>people, dead people, dead people."&nbsp; After that it all stopped
and I was</b>
<br><b>able to turn my TV back on a go to sleep.&nbsp; I moved out of my

<p><b>Me and my family have lived in this house for about two years now,
and</b>
<br><b>when when we first moved in I started getting these weird feelings
like</b>
<br><b>someone was watching me. Well last week my mom woke up early one</b>
<br><b>morning to see a dark shadowy figure standing at the foot of her
bed,but when</b>
<br><b>she turned her lamp on it disapeared and then last night I was sitting</b>
<br><b>on my bed when I heard what sounded like a loud whisper coming from
our</b>
<br><b>kitchen and I really couldn't make the words out, but when I turned
and</b>
<br><b>looked in the kitchen there was no one there, and I know it couldn't
of</b>

<p><b>ghost or imagination?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; fmoseley2003@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>hi!&nbsp; i really enjoy your site.&nbsp; i have a story for you.&nbsp;
my dauhgter</b>
<br><b>has experiences with the unknown.&nbsp; the ghosts seem attracted
to her.&nbsp; she</b>
<br><b>wants to know why it always picks on her and no one else in the
house.&nbsp; i</b>
<br><b>told her that some people are more sensitive than others and they
don't notice</b>
<br><b>odd things that happen and that she needs to not let it bother her
as much</b>
<br><b>as she does. they don't seem to be evil, only mischevious.&nbsp;
the first time</b>
<br><b>she noticed anything was in 1999.&nbsp; she was 12 and i had left
my husband and</b>
<br><b>moved in with my parents taking her and her brother whom is 2 years</b>
<br><b>older than her.&nbsp; anyway, my mother had told us for years that
the house that</b>
<br><b>they now lived in was haunted and strange things had happened over
the last</b>
<br><b>10 years.&nbsp; we had only been there for a couple of months when
one night my</b>
<br><b>daughter was fussing with her brother as most sibling do, and finally</b>
<br><b>they lay down to sleep.&nbsp; we were sleeping in the den(used to
be a garden</b>
<br><b>years ago before the previous home burned down with the old couple
inside).</b>
<br><b>anyway they had finally went to sleep.&nbsp; well my daughter screamed
and</b>
<br><b>came crying into the kitchen saying that her brother had slapped
her on the</b>
<br><b>back.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; i went into the den and her brother was fast asleep.&nbsp;
i talked her back to</b>
<br><b>bed and she came screaming back into the kitchen and said something
was</b>
<br><b>sitting on her feet and it was really cold and i felt her feet and
they</b>
<br><b>were ice cold.&nbsp; needless to say i woke her brother up and we
slept in the</b>
<br><b>living room that night.&nbsp; i went into the den with the bible
(i wasn't a real</b>
<br><b>religious person), but i read a prayer to that room and told the</b>
<br><b>spirits that if they were going to mess with anyone it better be
me not my</b>
<br><b>children. anyway, nothing else happened for a few weeks until my
mother had to</b>
<br><b>take my father to the dr and the kids were at school and i was all
alone.</b>
<br><b>now all this time in my mothers home i never felt uncomfortable
or</b>
<br><b>anything.&nbsp; i was sitting in the kitchen drinking coffee that
morning and all of a</b>
<br><b>sudden i heard a puppy crying in the living room, i automatically
got up and</b>
<br><b>went to check it out when i realized my mother doesnt have a puppy
and the</b>
<br><b>dog she does have was in the laundry room asleep.&nbsp; i was creeped
out and i</b>
<br><b>went back into the kitchen and acted like i didn't hear it, and
soon my</b>
<br><b>parents returned.&nbsp; i told them what happened and they laughed
at me and told me</b>
<br><b>that was nothing.&nbsp; that for ten years they had put up with
the sinks turning</b>
<br><b>on by themselves, the cabinets opening on their own, seeing black
shadow</b>
<br><b>people walking down their hallway, having pictures rotating on their
walls so</b>
<br><b>much that they nail them to the walls to keep them from moving,
my brothers</b>
<br><b>when they were younger would wake up and go to the bathroom and
come back</b>
<br><b>and find a knife in their beds or their closet doors which were
sliding</b>
<br><b>doors would slam open and shut on their own.&nbsp; one time my yougest
brother</b>
<br><b>says he had just laid down for the night and a purple ball of light
came at him</b>
<br><b>and zapped him, he couldn't move and when he could he ran screaming
down</b>
<br><b>the hallway to my mothers room and she says he was petrified and
the hair</b>
<br><b>on his head was sticking straight up.&nbsp; he did not sleep in
his room for a long</b>
<br><b>time.&nbsp; these things happened off and on over the years and
they just</b>
<br><b>got used to all this wierd crap going on.&nbsp; they had freinds
visit from out</b>
<br><b>of town and the wife refused to come back because she swore she
saw a</b>
<br><b>black shadow figure going up and down the hallway all night.&nbsp;
other people</b>
<br><b>have came over and have mentioned seeing someone going down the
hallway, but</b>
<br><b>noone would be there.&nbsp; they still live in this house to this
day.&nbsp; they</b>
<br><b>investigated the land and found out that their side of town was</b>
<br><b>originally a lake and when they dammed part of it up homes were
built and the</b>
<br><b>original house was a tiny shack with an old couple living their
with their</b>
<br><b>daughter and her baby.&nbsp; they had a garden right outside their
back door and</b>
<br><b>would go work in it every day, this garden was where the den is
now.&nbsp; there was</b>
<br><b>a fire an it killed them all.&nbsp; my mom and dad have seen an
old woman</b>
<br><b>standing in their closet grinning at them.&nbsp; and they all have
heard the baby</b>
<br><b>crying in the closet many times.&nbsp; my mother says sometimes
she hears frogs</b>
<br><b>croaking in the closet and their is no way under the house unless
you take the</b>
<br><b>metal grill out of the concrete that is all around their home.&nbsp;
me and the</b>
<br><b>kids moved on to kansas with my new fiance, now husband, and it
is now 2003.</b>
<br><b>my daughter has had some experiences in our new home that we purchased.
it</b>
<br><b>was built in the early 1900's and other families have lived their
and as</b>
<br><b>far as we know no one has died there.&nbsp; after we had lived there
for about six</b>
<br><b>months i would go downstairs (my bedroom at that time was upstairs
with</b>
<br><b>my daughter and sons, our 8 yr old only came on the weekends and
slept on</b>
<br><b>the couch, the rest of the time she was at her mothers thru the
week) to</b>
<br><b>the kitchen after my son and daughter were gone to school and my
husband</b>
<br><b>gone to work, the kitchen cabinets would all be wide open every
morning.&nbsp; i</b>
<br><b>have a galley style kitchen with floor to ceiling cabinets, counter
inbetween.</b>
<br><b>some of these cabinets were so high that i couldn't shut them without</b>
<br><b>jumping to shut the door and i am 5'9.&nbsp; i accused everyone
of leaving</b>
<br><b>them open out of laziness and all denied leaving them open.&nbsp;
this has</b>
<br><b>continued to this day about 5 or 6 times a month instead of every
day.&nbsp; i also</b>
<br><b>would come home for my hour lunch every day and see a black cat
run from the</b>
<br><b>dining room to the den, and at that time we had a chocolate colored
cat</b>
<br><b>named ruby, and i would follow it to the den(that is where i kept
her</b>
<br><b>food, on top of the floor to ceiling shelves in the den to keep
the dogs from</b>
<br><b>eating her food) and call her, here ruby and she would not be in
there</b>
<br><b>at all.&nbsp; i would look all over the house and puzzled because
i always</b>
<br><b>found ruby outside on the porch or in another room not even close
to the den</b>
<br><b>and&nbsp; because i cleary saw a cat run from one room to another.&nbsp;
this happed</b>
<br><b>about 3 or 4 times.&nbsp; my family thought i was nuts so i tried
not to mention</b>
<br><b>these occurances to anyone but my daughter whom beleived me.&nbsp;
any way, me and</b>
<br><b>my husband got to keep our youngest daughter for the entire summer
and we</b>
<br><b>moved down to the basement and gave her our sons room and he got
our old</b>
<br><b>bedroom upstairs, due to it having a walkin closet.&nbsp; he has
slept in that room</b>
<br><b>and never had his bed shake in there.&nbsp;&nbsp; during the time
i saw the cat and</b>
<br><b>the cabinet were opening my daughter ran screaming into my room
one night</b>
<br><b>saying that her bed was shaking.&nbsp; her stepfather told her it
was probably the</b>
<br><b>furnace down in the basement making it move.&nbsp; she wasn't convinced
that</b>
<br><b>was it.&nbsp; this continued off and on.&nbsp; one night she cleaned
her room and</b>
<br><b>shut her closet door which was the shutter sliding type and it ranalong
an</b>
<br><b>entire wall.&nbsp; she heard rustling noises in the closet and figured
it was her</b>
<br><b>brother in their getting ready to jump out and scare her.&nbsp;
she was just</b>
<br><b>about to tell him to get out of her room when he knocked on her
door</b>
<br><b>and told her she had a phone call.&nbsp; needless to say she slept
downstairs in</b>
<br><b>the living room that night.&nbsp; she says she will shut her light
out, go</b>
<br><b>downstairs or go across the hall to the bathroom and when she gets
back to her</b>
<br><b>room the light will be on.&nbsp; or she will leave her light on
and when she gets</b>
<br><b>back it will be off.&nbsp; the bed still shakes occasionally but
now i think she is</b>
<br><b>used to it.&nbsp; once i asked her brother why he would never sleep
in his room</b>
<br><b>upstairs and he said he was tired of his bed shaking (this was before</b>
<br><b>he got to move into our old bedroom) his sister and i told him our
experiences</b>
<br><b>and he did not beleive us and neither did my husband.&nbsp; 6 more
months go by</b>
<br><b>and my daughter has another experience.&nbsp; she was in bed and
had just laid</b>
<br><b>down to go to sleep when she saw a tall black shadow block out the
night</b>
<br><b>light shining from the bathroom across from her room, it crossed
her door way</b>
<br><b>and went into her younger sisters room.&nbsp; she saw lights flickering
in there</b>
<br><b>and thought the tv was on.&nbsp; then it hit her that she had turned
her sisters</b>
<br><b>tv off before going to her own room and the shadow she saw was too
tall to</b>
<br><b>be her 8 year old sister, then her bedroom door started to slowly
shut by</b>
<br><b>itself, she ran screaming down the stairs, fell, ran screaming thru
the</b>
<br><b>house to the dining room where the basement door was(our bedroom)
and</b>
<br><b>begged me to come upstairs.&nbsp; we turned all the lights on and
checked</b>
<br><b>everywhere and noone was in her room or her sisters room, because
her sister was</b>
<br><b>asleep downstairs on the couch and her brother was asleep in his
bed after</b>
<br><b>working harvest until 10 pm. so he was fast asleep.&nbsp; she got
her blankets and</b>
<br><b>fan and went into the den to sleep on the couch, i left my basement
door</b>
<br><b>open in case she needed me. she is 16 and was petrified.&nbsp; anyway,
the next</b>
<br><b>morning i found her in the living room sleeping on the couch with
her sister</b>
<br><b>instead of in the den.&nbsp; she told me that the bathroom door
which is in the den</b>
<br><b>was open only about 2 inches, when she looked at it later it was
open all</b>
<br><b>the way, that freaked her out and she took her fan and blanket and
got on</b>
<br><b>the couch in the living room with her sister and just about the
time she</b>
<br><b>was going to sleep she heard someone walk thru the living room and
they</b>
<br><b>walked in front of the fan, that noise it makes when someone is
in front of a</b>
<br><b>fan and then someone or something blew gently in her ear and made
her hair</b>
<br><b>move. she said she shut her eyes turned to face the back of the
couch and</b>
<br><b>finally went to sleep.&nbsp; she refuses to go to her room unless
someone is with</b>
<br><b>her.&nbsp; i am waiting on the next episode to happen with her.&nbsp;
i told her to tell</b>
<br><b>it to leave her alone and she said she did and that is when it came
into the</b>
<br><b>living room and blew in her ear.&nbsp; my husband thinks we are
nuts and</b>
<br><b>told us not to say a word to the youngest or she would never sleep
in her room</b>
<br><b>upstairs.&nbsp; so i told my daughter that i would stay in her room
or</b>
<br><b>wherever she dicided to sleep, and i would stay until she fell asleep.&nbsp;
that is</b>
<br><b>my story for now.&nbsp; is this a ghost or ghosts or our imaginations?&nbsp;

<p><b>Is it my imagination or something paranormal</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; Jjessi1971@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, my name is Jessica. At my mother-in laws house weird things happen.&nbsp;
Ive heard stories from my neice and my husband about little things they
and the family has expereinced, and I would think to myself WEIRDOS. Stories
went on a couple of years, until a few months ago I expereinced something.(well
actuall when I went to their house for the first time I was sitting at
my mother-in laws computer and very faintly I heard a man and women talking,
almost like it was through the walls.At first I didnt think nothing about
it, and then the next time I was sitting there, and I was alone in the
house and I heard them again. I started thinking thats strange it sounds
like its coming from the walls, so I went outside to see if anyone was
around and there was nobody there. I told this to my mother and father-in
law and they told me it was just my imagination. (oh did I mention that
my mother-in law is a Jehovas witness, she doesnt believe in ghosts, just
demons. And she says no way that Jahova will allow that in HER house.)
Well time went by and didnt here it again and I just went on with my life,
then a few months ago I stayed the night at their house and slept in my
sister-inlaws room, door open. And down the hall I heardscuffing noises.
Like when an old person is wearing slippers and they scuff when they walk.
Well I got up to see who it was and I saw nobody. My mother in laws door
was closed, and my neice and sister in law were fast asleep in the living
room. Si i went to bed thinking it was my imagination. Well I heard it
again, and again, again. I kept getting up, again, again, and again, and
saw nothing. It went on all night, until i fell asleep aroud 4:30 am out
tiredness.&nbsp; When i got up about 8:00am with droopy eyes my family
asked me why I couldnt sleep, and I told thekm. Again my mother-and father-inlaw
told me it was my imagination, and all my neice could say was told you
so.&nbsp; And I told myn husband about it when I got home and he said its
possible, he expereinced some things in that house, actually all his siblings
have. And he also told me about the old couple that luived next to him
that died. One died in a hospital, and the other died at a family members
house.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I dont know what I expereinced is authentic, or just things that
can be explained.&nbsp; All I no is all the grandkids get scared going
down grandma and grandpas hallway every once in a while.&nbsp; What I want
to know is can this be possibly something paranormal!!!! there is more
to this story but its alittle long .</b><b></b>

<p><b>Dark Hovering Man</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; spectral@adelphia.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I live in Maine, and one night, while staying
at a friends house for the night, a very, scarey event occured. My friend,
at the time lived in Clinton, Maine.&nbsp; She was staying with her Aunt
and Uncle who lived on a dirt road drive in an old, old farmhouse that
had a set of railroad tracks next to the house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My friends room was on the second floor of the
house in what was more like a fiished of attic.&nbsp; It was divided into
two sides.&nbsp; There was the finished side, and then there was the unfinished
side.&nbsp; We never set a foot in the unfinished side because that was
where they new most of the ghosts that they were well aware of, stayed.&nbsp;
They told me about how the ghosts would climb down the old staicase in
that half of the atttic, and they would always find that doors that they
had locked were unlocked, or just the opposite.&nbsp; They also set they
often times could here footsteps on the old staircase and up in the attic,&nbsp;
it was right above the kitchen.&nbsp; They said, for the most part, they
had friendly ghosts.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night, her Aunt and Uncle were out for dinner,
and my friend and I were at the house babysitting her cousin.&nbsp; He
had gone to bed, so we climbed the ladder that lead to her room, and got
ready for bed ourselves.&nbsp; A little while later, we were still up,
lyinging on the mattress on the floor and talking on and on, as young girls
often do on sleepovers.&nbsp; It was a moonlit night, but clouds were rolling
by, causing the moonlight to blink on and off.&nbsp; As we lay on our backs
facing the ceiling and talking,&nbsp; it happened.&nbsp; I remember it
so clearly too.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The moonlight was fully comming through the window
like a nightlight.&nbsp; Suddenly what looked to be a tall, all black man,
was hovering above us.&nbsp; I couldn't make out any feet or any kind of
facial figures on this man.&nbsp; It looked like he was wearing a large
trench coat.&nbsp; My heart started racing, and I didn't say anything to
my freind untill I checked out the window to make sure the clouds weren't
playing tricks on my mind.&nbsp; The sky was cloudless.&nbsp; Turning my
gaze up again, I whispered,"Do you see that?" to my friend.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said "Do you see that too?"</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes!" I answered.&nbsp; That was all the confirmation
either of us needed.&nbsp; She counted to three, and on three it was still
there and appeared to be moving down toward us,&nbsp; in sinc' we pulled
the covers over our heads, held eachother and and screamed and cried at
the same time.&nbsp; When we finally did come out from the protection of
the covers, it was gone.&nbsp; My friend was convinced this was an evil
being, that was trying to hurt us.&nbsp; I really don't know what to think.&nbsp;
All I know is that I was thirteen or fourteen at the time, I'm 20 now,
and this event still gives me goosebumps to think, write, or talk about
now.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Shadows</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; wmorgan1@tctc.edu</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is a story that has happened to me recently that I would like
to</b>
<br><b>share.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have been dating a guy for almost a year now and not long after
we</b>
<br><b>started dating, he confided in me that sometimes he feels like</b>
<br><b>something follows him...something evil and depressing.&nbsp; I asked
him if</b>
<br><b>he had done anything to open a door to let whatever it was into
this</b>
<br><b>world or give it a reason to follow him and he said no.</b>
<br><b>We dropped the conversation at that and never spoke of it again.&nbsp;
About</b>
<br><b>four months later, we were watching tv at his apartment and I fell</b>
<br><b>asleep.&nbsp; While I was sleeping, he got up and turned off the
television,</b>
<br><b>and then laid down beside me and fell asleep too.&nbsp; I woke up
suddenly</b>
<br><b>about thirty minutes later and looked around the room in the dark,</b>
<br><b>thinking I had heard some sort of loud noise.&nbsp; That's when
I realized</b>
<br><b>that right in front of me, about two feet from the foot of the bed,
was</b>
<br><b>a shadow--an outline of a human shape.&nbsp; It didn't have any
facial</b>
<br><b>features, it was mainly just a dark grayish silhouette that was</b>
<br><b>hovering just over the top of the foot of the bed.&nbsp; As I watched,
it</b>
<br><b>reached out an arm and began to reach for me.&nbsp; I instantly
felt as if</b>
<br><b>it was going to kill me and I screamed for Josh.&nbsp; He jumped
up beside</b>
<br><b>me and turned on the light.&nbsp; The form disappeared instantly.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>shaking and told Josh that I had seen something there and he asked
me</b>
<br><b>if it was a gray form that hovered over me.&nbsp; I was in shock,
because I</b>
<br><b>hadn't described what I had seen to him yet.&nbsp; I told him yes,
and he</b>
<br><b>said when he was younger he saw the same thing, only he reached
out and</b>
<br><b>touched it and it flew out a window.&nbsp; I was shaken up badly
after that</b>
<br><b>moment, and I made him take me home.</b>
<br><b>Recently, we at my house and we were both asleep in my room.&nbsp;
It was</b>
<br><b>probably about 11:00 at night.&nbsp; I woke up again like I had
before,</b>
<br><b>thinking I had heard a noise and looked up to see a long white vapory</b>
<br><b>looking form floating across my room. As I watched it picked up
speed</b>
<br><b>and started floating right at me!&nbsp; I screamed "NO!" and put
a pillow</b>
<br><b>over my head.&nbsp; Josh woke up and grabbed my arm. I took the
pillow off</b>
<br><b>my face and looked around, but the shadowy thing was gone.&nbsp;
Before I</b>
<br><b>could tell Josh what happened, he said "I know...I felt it go over
us."</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I'm not sure if there really is something that follows him, or what,</b>
<br><b>because it only seems to happen when he is with me.&nbsp; I think
it is</b>
<br><b>really strange, and whatever it is, doesn't seem to be very friendly.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Several New Encounters</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; pauleew@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>It's great to be able to share a few new stories with ya'll. First
is a</b>
<br><b>story about a distraught teenager, who killed himself a few years
ago.</b>
<br><b>His friends and family visit his grave site on a regular basis,
so</b>
<br><b>there</b>
<br><b>is often activity there. We here at Ghost Hunters of the Last Frontier</b>
<br><b>have become convinced that he very much regrets what he's done.
Last</b>
<br><b>Halloween, while we were wacthing the local cemetery, which we do
every</b>
<br><b>year, to guard against vandals, we were taking pics when some of
his</b>
<br><b>friends showed up to visit, with thier permission we took some pics
of</b>
<br><b>them all, and were thrilled to get 2 great pics of the boy himself.
The</b>
<br><b>detail in the pic was outstanding, we could see his whole form very</b>
<br><b>clearly. Even his mother was amazed at the detail. When he died
the top</b>
<br><b>of his head had been distended due to the exit wound of the bullet,
and</b>
<br><b>it showed up in the pic, which I'm going to post in the near future.
is</b>
<br><b>friends started to play some music, and started to dance and when
we</b>
<br><b>took another pic, we caught him dancing as well, again very clear
in</b>
<br><b>the</b>
<br><b>pic. Shortly after this, his mother arrived for the party, and when
we</b>
<br><b>took a pic of her next to the headstone, there was an orb on her</b>
<br><b>shoulder, which she was sure was him. She related that she had felt
him</b>
<br><b>next to her, and said that she had felt his hand on the exact spot
that</b>
<br><b>the orb had been. We have been back there many times since then,
and</b>
<br><b>always get an orb or two in the area, as well as a sense that he
is</b>
<br><b>there and aware of our visits.</b>
<br><b>Right across from him is another friend I knew before his death.
He was</b>
<br><b>working on one of the oil platforms here in Alaska, when his head
was</b>
<br><b>crushed by a piece of heavy pipe that broke off. His spirit is also</b>
<br><b>very</b>
<br><b>evident, and also always shows up with orbs in the pics we take
there.</b>
<br><b>One of the members of our group is so in tune with the other side,
that</b>
<br><b>whenever he is photographed, anywhere he is, there is always an
orb(s)</b>
<br><b>or somethng in the pic. In one pic there were 319 obvious orbs around</b>
<br><b>him. We call him an orb magnet!</b>
<br><b>I have many other enounters to share but will add them later. If
anyone</b>
<br><b>wants to visit South central Alaska, we would be happy to show you</b>
<br><b>around.</b>

<p><b>The Landlord's Son</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; george103188@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My friend was at home, by herself and she was watching one of those
shows on the travel channel about haunted hotels.&nbsp; She had to go to
the bathroom, and when she was washing her hands, she saw in the mirror
some guy standing behind her.&nbsp; She was scared and confused so she
turned around to tell the guy off for being in her house, but when she
turned around, he was gone.&nbsp; She looked back in the mirror and he
vanished.&nbsp; Well, I can honestly say that I didn't believe her when
she called me right after that.&nbsp; She wanted me to go over to her house
because she was scared and I thought "Man, what has she been smoking, there's
no such things as ghosts."&nbsp; But I went over there anyway.&nbsp; I
told her she was probably imagining things after watching that show.&nbsp;
Later that night, as I was putting on my pajamas (I had the door opened
because her house is freaky and I wanted to be able to run.), I saw this
dude standing next to me and he looked very angry about something.&nbsp;
I thought he broke in and was going to kill me, but when I looked next
to myself, he was gone.&nbsp; I didn't look in the mirror to see if he
was there, I just ran to my friend and told her what I saw.&nbsp; It turns
out that we saw the same dude, and we thought it was best not to stay there
anymore so we ran accross the feild to her landlord's house.&nbsp; When
we described what we saw to him, he told us it was his son, who had lived
there previously, but he wouldn't tell us how he died.&nbsp; To this day,
I don't go to her bathroom by myself and if I walk by her bathroom, it
looks like someone else is walking next to me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has a very haunted house.&nbsp; In the kitchen,
if you stand in a certain spot, you can smell the faint smell of some kind
of perfume, but only for a second.&nbsp; Her baby sister died in the bathtub
and I can kind of feel her in there.&nbsp; Her grandmother, who is full
blooded Native American, once told once told my friend's mom that she could
see this guy hugging her, and in the hallway, in a certain spot, it feels
very cold, colder than the rest of the hall.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When my friend was younger, she was sleeping
next to her dad (mind you she was about four or five when this happened
and she still has nightmares) and she had to use the bathroom.&nbsp; On
her way back from the bathroom, this figure grabbed her, she couldn't see
it's face, and it dragged her to the back door, which has no porch, just
a five foot drop, and tried to push her through it.&nbsp; The more she
struggled, the tighter it gripped her.&nbsp; Finally, she broke free and
she went to th kitchen window.&nbsp; She saw the white figure, but when
she blinked, it was gone.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a house that I used to live in, I always felt
like I was being watched by many people and sometimes I could hear strange
whispering, so I would get scared and find my mom. but her room wasn't
any better, in fact, it was worse, and I could feel people walking past
me and I would suddenly feel very cold, no matter how many blankets I was
under, my mom could feel them too.&nbsp; If you want to ask questions about
these things, send your questions to george103188@hotmail.com, my name
is Katie.&nbsp; Thankyou.</b>

<p><b>it follows</b><b></b>

<p><b>This is gonna sound kinda crazy. But bear with me. I have always
seen kina funny little things. But in November 2000 I was pregnant with
my 3rd daughter and things started to get outta hand. It all started when
my At the time almost3 year old daughter used to sit upstairs and I would
hear her talking to someone. I heard this one day and I asked her who she
was talking to she said the Baby I thought awww how cute she is excited
about the new baby. Well this stuff went on for the next month than one
day she&nbsp; came down and said mommy the baby's crying (she said this
often) Itold her to go pick it up thinking that she was pretending She
said I can't mommy it's up. At the time this diden't seam important. Anyway
as we eased into December I had my baby girl. I first noticed things starting
to happen a few days befor christmas. I satrted hearing noises foot steps
when no one was up stairs. I dismissed it as an over active imagination.
Than one day I was down stairs and I heard this very loud pounding up stairs
no one was up their. I told my husband and he said i was a nut.Well when
I got the babys first day home pic's back. the first 5 pics taken in the
span of 10 mins their was black half circle lines and light circles all
over the first 3 pics. But it was the last 2 they were cvered with blue
balls of light that looked like it had blue spider webs around it. the
rest of the roll was fine. Again I was alittle freaked out I sent the pics
to my father he said they were weard but not to be concerned. Well the
noises and stuff contiuned for the nexted few months alway when the kids
and I were home alone I got so scared that I would not be alone their.
Well one day my husband and I were in the living room ond the utility room
door handle started turning by it's self and the door started shakeing.
Well my husband freaked we checked it out their was nothing in their that
could have done that the kids were in bed. afew weeks later we were once
again sitting in the living room and out of nowear we heard the loudest
sound of finger nails going down the back of the same door. we both screamed
and ran. Now we had no pets at the time and this sounded like finger nails
on a chalk board it sounded like people finger nails. My husband nolonger
called me crazy. The noises got so bad all my kid talked about was the
baby on the wall in their room. The foot steps got louder we finnaly moved.
Everything was good 4 about the first year or so then one day my daughter
comes down stairs with her sister her speech being much better now she
said mommy theirs a baby on my wall. I had just had another daughter. but
my blood went cold I said no honey the babys in the living room. She said
no mommy not that baby it is a scary baby its on my wall and it's crying.
I wasnted to cry I was so afraid to go upstsirs when I did their was nothing
their. I thought okay they made it up. But not 3 weeks later the footsteps
started again. The banging&nbsp; so again we moved. It has been quiet for
the last year and&nbsp; a half I think its beacuse we have moved 3 times
due to finacal problems. But we are going on 6 months here an I am afraid
that the next 6 will bring a very unwanted visitor.Have u ever heard of
this before is their anything I can do if it starts again</b>

<p><b>Harrisburg, Pennsylvania</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; Jennyl3al3y@aol.com</b>
<br><b>To start off I just wanted to say I'm kinda disappointed that more
people in Central Pennsyvania aren't submitting their stories. I know for
a fact it's a pretty haunted area. Here are my experiences with the house
I grew up in in the Union Deposit Area of Harrisburg. Locals will know
where I'm talking about when I say, "the house on Spring Creek."&nbsp;
Here goes.&nbsp; My Grandparents, Mom and I moved in to this farmhouse
when I was about 4 years old. It had sat vacant for awhile.&nbsp; As early
as I can remember, My Great Uncle would come over and sit with my Pap and
tell him about the old man and old lady that he used to see in rocking
chairs on the porch facing the road.&nbsp; (Keep this in mind.)&nbsp; I'm
still not sure if the old couple was "living" the times he'd seen them.
Years passed, but as I got older and I got a bit better at expressing myself,
I would run to my Nan and tell her I felt like someone was watching me,
particularly on the stairs. She smiled and told me the Catholics would
say it was my Guardian Angel. I just looked at her funny, not thinking
or knowing to tell her&nbsp; whoever was watching me was making me pretty
uncomfortable and at times scared.&nbsp; I was always terrified of my bedroom
as well. I never slept there. The night was particularly terrifying, especially
when you are a little kid. I slept in the pull-out bed in the living room
until I was about 11 years old and we moved out. My bedroom was always
ice cold and there were always dead flies on the window sills no matter
how much we cleaned them.&nbsp; I do remember one particular day watching
a movie, nothing scary or anything (Troop Beverly Hills) haha and eating
popcorn.&nbsp; When I looked up ahead of me at the wall I could see in
the mirror that a black shadowy figure was passing right behind the recliner
where I was seated. I dropped the popcorn and ran about a mile up the road
to meet my Nan on her daily walk. I used to constantly ask my Grandparents
if they had ever seen any ghosts there and they would say no- at the time.&nbsp;
We moved to Duncannon, PA when I was around 11 or 12.&nbsp; That's when
I found out what was up.&nbsp; My grandma said to me one day, "Jenny, I
hate to tell you this now but I think our farmhouse was haunted."&nbsp;
Turns out she'd seen an old man herself, very pale, in a white tee and
overalls. She said she'd been hanging curtains when she'd seen him resting
against a car parked in our driveway. She thought nothing of it until she
went to see what he wanted but then he was gone.&nbsp; She also told me
every night before she fell asleep, she'd hear whispers.&nbsp; It became
so routine to her she said it was odd not to hear them in our new home.&nbsp;
It sounded to her as if a radio dial was being turned, a lot of static
and both constant male and female voices. My Grandfather, however, hadn't
experienced anything, though he did believe her.&nbsp; The house has literally
haunted me in my dreams for as long as I can remember, power of suggestion,
I 'm not sure but almost every dream was consistent. In the dream the home
was haunted by a plump, short, old lady who kind of kept to herself, a
tall , thin, grouchy sometimes angry old man, and a little boy. The little
boy I remember very clearly though he only appeared in my dream vividly
once. He had brown hair, blue eyes and freckles across his cheeks. He was
wearing a newsboy cap, a white shirt and suspenders.&nbsp; In that dream
he was peering out of my bedroom window at me while I was driven into the
yard by the old man.&nbsp; I got the feeling he was lost, or in despair.
Over the years,&nbsp; as my interest grew in my dreams and the paranormal
in general I decided to make several trips back to my old farm house.&nbsp;
(The house again, sat abandoned for 10+ years after we'd moved. )&nbsp;
One day my Mother and I went back and found some of my old Jem coloring
book pages in the middle of the floor of my old bedroom.&nbsp; I thought
nothing of it until one day when I went back a few months later to show
some friends where I grew up.&nbsp; I joked, "I wonder if "they" left me
anything else?" We all ran out of there when we reached my bedroom and
in the same spot as the coloring book pages were on my previous visit,
was now the cover of that Jem book which I have in my possession to this
day.&nbsp; It came to my attention that it was quite a party house for
only a short period of time, the vacant house was vandalized, and home
to a runaway for a little while as well.&nbsp; Apparently others had gotten
the vibe that they weren't totaly alone there either.&nbsp; Some aquaintances
were stunned that I had grown up there since it was so notoriously haunted,
though no one knew any history of the place.&nbsp; Finally, someone else
had suggested it!&nbsp; At any rate, some friends and I began cruising
by on occasion to check on the place.&nbsp; One night when we were riding
by, we saw a steady orange glow eminating from two bedroom windows on the
second floor.&nbsp; This was the room next to my old bedroom. This glow
was very vibrant, an orange-red, and it was much too big and controlled
to be a fire- it didn't even flicker!&nbsp; On another occasion when we
went back, we got out of the car in daytime and went to walk around the
outside. We all felt as if something menacing was watching us and quickly
left. We knew we didn't belong there.&nbsp; In the house I am living in
now, I woke to a sound one night out of deep sleep. I listened carefully
because it sounded like a heated, WHISPERED, conversation.&nbsp; I was
curious until I recognized the sound of static, at that point I'd realized
I was hearing the same thing that my Nan used to hear at the farm house
but that is the only current experience I have had.&nbsp; It scare d the
crap out of me at the time so I moved my bed, just to comfort myself. About
2 years ago, the farm house was torn down to make way for a new development.
To this day when I drive by the now vacant lot I get this awful feeling.
I pity whoever buys the new house built on that land. It's almost as if
the ohouse itself is a ghost. I wish I knew the history of the place. That
is a work in progress.&nbsp; Please, I know Central, PA especially Harrisburg
is extremely haunted. I'd love to read some other local stories.&nbsp;
Thank you for listening to mine...</b>

<p><b>my story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; spectral@adelphia.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I've often felt intensely aware of what I can see and or not see
in my surroundings.&nbsp; I live in Waterville, Maine, and there are a
few different sections of town. There's the old part and the newer remodeled
part -as it is with most towns.&nbsp; I have had more than a couple experiences
with the supernatural here in Maine.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; One event gives me Goosebumps every time I think about it.&nbsp;
I was in the old part of town in a second floor apartment building that
I had never been in before.&nbsp; I had used their bathroom to splash some
cold water on my face.&nbsp; After doing so, I realized there was no towel
in this bathroom to use to dry my face.&nbsp; Now, this was a large bathroom
still having the original sink and claw foot tub in it.&nbsp; There were
two doors in this bathroom, the door I used to enter, and another doorway
that was opened directly diagonal from the entrance door.&nbsp; I walked
over toward the second doorway to try and find a towel.&nbsp; It looked
like it was a small room someone was using as a bedroom.&nbsp; There was
a fan facing the doorway at an angle and it was turned on.&nbsp; Beyond
the fan along the same wall was a small stand and large stereo system.&nbsp;
The room was dark, and I really didn't want to go in, first of all I didn't
know who's room it was and didn't want to be rude, second, it gave me the
creeps.&nbsp; However, I was dripping wet and was desperate.&nbsp; As I
cautiously stepped in the fan slowed down.&nbsp; I really didn't think
much of it, thought maybe I had stepped on the cord or something.&nbsp;
I became alarmed when I took another step toward the fan to investigate
and it sputtered to a stop. I followed the electrical cord all the way
to the wall and it was fully plugged in.&nbsp; Instinctively I quickly
stepped back, and the fan turned back on and sped up again.&nbsp; It seemed
the more frightened I became, more things happened in this tiny room.&nbsp;
I stood there in the middle of the room and suddenly some papers ruffled
and flew up in the air a bit.&nbsp; Then I was suddenly hit with a chilling
gust of cold air and instantly froze in fear. This had never happened so
blatantly to me before.&nbsp; Before I knew it the stereo system when nuts,
all of the buttons were getting pressed quickly and randomly.&nbsp; The
radio came on, stations kept switching, then the cd player came on.&nbsp;
I was, as embarrassing as this is, on the verge of peeing my pants, I didn't
thank goodness.&nbsp; I took a deep breath, grabbed a towel, and ran as
fast as I could out of that room, out of the bathroom, through the kitchen,
and into the living room.&nbsp; I tripped and fell three times along the
way.&nbsp; I jumped into a chair and huddled there, clutching my knees
and shaking.&nbsp; Two stunned people were staring at me like I had gone
mad.&nbsp; I stuttered out the story of what had just happened to me, and
they just smiled, laughed and said "Yeah, this place is really haunted.&nbsp;
The ghosts are always messing with our electrical appliances and door locks."&nbsp;
I had a hard time ever staying in that bathroom for very long.&nbsp; I
also heard that those small rooms off of the bathrooms were often built
and used for children nurseries.</b><b></b>

<p><b>hey i got a TRUE story (school orbs)</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; no_bodys_angel77@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hey,</b>
<br><b>My school had a dance in the gym for the end of the year :) they
turned off ALL the lights (except the D.J's corner). I always thought my
school was haunted cause werid things happen there ALOT....like the doors
open and close by themself...things are heard at the back of the art room
and the bathrooms ALWAYS sound like some one is walking in circles, but
when you go in a check eather no one is there or the person in there didn't
do it.</b>
<br><b>Any ways,i decided that this was my chance to take pictures and
see what would come out, i grabbed my Digital Camera (best for takeing
pictures of ghosts) and started takeing pictures of my freinds,and of walls.When
we all sat down to take a look, in EVERY picture there were about 10-12
round,circular,bright things in the air, they were kind of see threw but
not really, when i looked over all the pictures i thought that maybe i
caught Orb's in my pictures..or "Will-O-Wasps" as some people call them.
When i asked my freind, she said that is was dust but i really dont think
dust is that round or bright.</b><b></b>

<p><b>happenings in my house</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; ghosttank14@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>A lot of wierd things go on in my house. Not one or two weeks pass
without somthing happening. A five or six months ago when we first moved
in my mom just got done putting all the pots and everything away in the
cabinets and she had one open that she forgot to close and this coffee
pot that was sitting in the back of the cabinet where it could not have
possibly had fallen out but a few minutes later the glass pot fell out
and sdhattered on the floor. then the next week when i was sleeping i starte
hearing scratching on the walls like fingernails scratching on it. we did'nt
have a cat at the time and my stepdad was sleeping in the other room. Then
two weeks after that my baby sisters little bathtub was wedged in the corner
of the two walls where it couldnt have fell and it fell. Then two weeks
later i had to go to the bathroom around 11:00 p.m. and the rest of the
house was dark and so was my bedroom next to the bathroom. So when I turned
the bathroom off a few seconds later my touch tone light turned on by its
self.</b>
<br><b>Then s couple of weeks after that the light in my baby sisters changing
room turned on by its self. And both my mom and stepdad were asleep. Then
nothing else wierd in the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;house happened for a while until just the middle of last month
and the begining of this month when i got a camera for graduation. I told
my mom it wasnt working right. When she was checking it out the light on
the camera was not on and niether was the kitchen</b>
<br><b>and my mom told me an orb flew across the screen. Then that early
that morning when my mom slept in my room she said that the strobe light
in my room turned on. She went and checked it out and the knob on it was
on off. She then was almost back to sleep when it turned on again so my
mom unplugged it. Earlir this week my playstation 2 turned on by itself
. Also when you are in the basement of the house you get the sensation
of being watched from the back room down there. I would like to video tape
my house but I keep forgeting to. My friend has a book on his house which
used to be Colonel Harmon's plantation house and the area that him and
i live in about every house has a story and is haunted.</b><b></b>

<p><b>True story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; haglersmaru@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>All my life i have been sensitive to the paranormal. have experienced&nbsp;
things in my life that only be told to people that have shared my experience.
my first memory was when as a child of about 5 or 6 in Amarillo Texas i
had a real fear of the closet that some thing bothersome was tormenting
me from the closet. i believe as young children fear is brought into our
existence at a young age to keep us off guard as to these manifestations
that will introduce themselves at a later date in our life's. growing up
in an Air force family we moved around a lot to many different homes some
with a history some without let me go on to explain while we lived in murfreesburo
Tennessee i as a child of around 11 heard a conversation going on in our
living room as if people were talking over a meal yet this didn't cause
fear since i slept in a room with my there brothers. then my father received
orders for Vietnam and we relocated to Ozark Alabama to be near his family
so that we could get rides to fortrucker since my mother didn't drive .
we moved into Scott's trailer park and nothing&nbsp; ever happened then
we had to move about 3 months later down the street to a house that was
nothing less then torment for me. at the beginning i had no fer of this
house i slept in the middle bed room in a top bunk unti i awoke with a
startle when i heard heavy solid sounds as someone was walking down the
hall way from the kitchen to my bedroom i was so scared this happened every
night with out a break.i also could hear chairs sliding in the dinning
room.and like someone was walking across the roof of the house. the bathtub
dripped and splashed echoing down the hallway. i would have to sleep on
the side of my brothers bed on a ironing board just to get sleep and every
chance i had i would sleep at a relatives home i hated that house . my
mother tried her best to calm my fears i would go to church and pray for
relief often reciting the lords prayer. i stayed up one night watching
TV when the lite bulb in the living room exploded for no reason and before
this i had been seeing things go on in my peripheral vision such as movement
and when i looked towards the motion it would be gone. i really wasn't
enjoying this at all. then one night i slept in my older brothers room
and it was day lite out side the morning lite coming thru the window i
was contemplating the days adventures fully awake and to my despair i heard
those horrible footsteps coming towards my brothers room stooping short
of the room i normally stayed in.i knew then that this wasn't about my
imagination this was really something i was experiencing regardless if
i wanted to or not.after experiencing this for to long i was sleeping again
by my brothers bed on the same ironing board and i heard someone call my
name tom tom i woke up and this time it was my father he was back for good
from Vietnam standing next to him was my mother what a joyful occasion
i would soon no longer stay in this house.a few days after my fathers return
it felt good to sleep in the top bunk again and not be fearful of what
i couldn't understand.knowing my father was there to rescue me from my
torment.it was not to be a few nights later i awoke in a cold sweat and
to my despair i heard those same tormenting foot steps coming towards my
room i actually became angry and fed up for not having b n given any peace
I just didn't care i bolted up in my bunk looked to the right foot of my
bunk suspended in the air an apparition molecular lites in the shape of
a man human cararestics yet transparent. i sat on the side of the bunk
and said in the name of Jesus i don't want you here i slid of the bed to
the floor rebuking this apparition as i was told to do. i went to my parents
room and that was that. i was never bothered again.we then moved to California
were i now still live.my mother made an iquire to our landlady about these
disturbances and found her husband had built the house and was killed in
f freakaccident were something fell off a building he was workin on and
hit him in the head, and later to loose her son who also had lived in the
house who was deciest.</b><b></b>

<p><b>the lady in white</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; jresendes@sympatico.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>This all started when i was about 5 or 6(I am 16 now). i used to
hear a lot of noise n weird sounds durin the night time in my house. as
i laid awake in my bed at night i used to hear people walkin up the stairs,
and i knew it wasnt my family members becausre they were all sound asleep.
my brother used to hear things as well. one night he said he heard drawers
opening and closin in the bathroom. he went to see who was makin the noise
and to his surprise no one was there and everyone was asleep. then one
night while my father, my brother and myself were eatin dinner the hallway
light suddenly turned on. no one else was home so the way light turned
on was a mystery to us. then a few years later my brother was home alome
and makin a sandwich.&nbsp; he said he heard the cupboard behind him open
and close. a few weeks after that i was in my kitchen, then i went to the
washroom, and when i came back to my kitchen the micorwave was running(no
one else was home at this time).</b>
<br><b>Now here comes the weridest part. my brother and i shared a room
at the time. and i was still awake and it was around 1 am. i thought my
brother was asleep. as i was lookin around the room i noticed a figure
dressed in white with really long black hair. the figure walked across
my room and stopped in front of my bed. i closed my eyes in fear and when
i opened them she was gone. i thought maybe the figure was just my imagination.
but the next morning my brother asked me if i saw someone in our room the
night before. i said yea and gave him a description of the woman, and my
description was the exact same as his. that sighting of the ghost happened
when i was around 7 or 8, and its been 8 years later and i havnt really
seen her. the only other mentionable sightings have been i have noticed
people walkin down my hallway while i watch tv at night, and everyone is
sleepin in my house. and one night my brother was brushin his teeth and
he noticed something walk across the hall behind him. he went to see if
it was our sister but no one was there. to this day i havnt seen that ghost
yet, but id like to get another chance to see her and maybe communicate
with her.</b>
