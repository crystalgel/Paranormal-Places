<p><b>The Phantom Hit</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: muetz@new.rr.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This story happened two summers ago and may not be paranormal, but
it sure freaked me and my buddies out and every once in awhile we still
talk about "The Phantom Hit."&nbsp; Me and two friends were up late and
we came up with the bright idea of chucking rocks at cars that passed by
my friend's house.&nbsp; We took handfuls of rocks and whipped them at
cars and if we hit one we would run like hell.&nbsp; We moved to a busier
street and hid by some bushes. This one car was coming and we each had
one rock.&nbsp; I almost never threw because I felt too guilty if I hit
a car.&nbsp; My friends both threw their rocks.&nbsp; My one friend's rock
clearly bounced across the road and landed in the grass, I saw it happen.&nbsp;
My other friend hit the car and it made a huge THWACK! sound when it hit
the car.&nbsp; The car didn't stop so we were relieved but not five seconds
later we heard another THWACK that sounded exactly like the first one.&nbsp;
Exactly like the first one.&nbsp; Only one rock had hit the car, I had
not thrown, and my other friend had missed.&nbsp; Unless some other kids
had decided to throw rocks at cars at the exact same time, and one hit
the exact same car not five seconds after my friend's did, we could find
no explanation.&nbsp; I'm sure you're thinking there must be some other
explanation but I promise you it was the exact same sound.&nbsp; That is
the only weird thing like that that has ever happened to me.&nbsp; Lame
when compared to other's stories, but it still freaked us out.</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;We (me and my 8 month pregnant wife) had just purchased an

<br><b>Upper Yucaipa.&nbsp; The house was built in 1956 and a room was
added on in the early</b>

master bathroom when I</b>
<br><b>heard a woman’s voice say, “What are you doing?”&nbsp; I opened

<br><b>the living room, to find my wife sleeping on the sofa.&nbsp; A few
nights later, I was</b>
<br><b>working a 24-hour shift.&nbsp; My wife was woken by a noise and
saw a light in the</b>
<br><b>hallway.&nbsp; She said it was blue in color and was hovering in
the hallway outside our</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; The light was in the shape of a ball floating 4 feet
off the ground.&nbsp; After a few</b>
<br><b>min. the light went away.&nbsp; Four months ago, I was giving my
son a bath in the</b>

<br><b>Painful Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: deanna@lizettesgothshop.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Stumbled upon you. Your sincerety seems very genuine. I think this
will be more of a therapy process for me. So here goes...</b><b></b>
<p><b>In 1996 my fiance and I purchased a home in North Carolina and began
work on our little dream house immediately. My husband to be was a carpenter
so I had my own 'handy man'. This was going to be great! It only took a
few days for me to start noticing that I just didn't feel wanted in the
home. There were days that I thought "I love this house I feel so at 'home'
when I'm here". The sun shining in through the windows, the birds chirping
outside, people popping in to welcome us to the neighborhood. But...I still
had those moments that I could litterally feel someone watching me. As
work continued on the house and the wedding plans falling into that frantic
pace, I was diverted from not really focusing on that 'watched feeling'.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The wedding was so tender and sweet and everyone of our friends
along with family turned out in their best attire. We were so delighted
with how well and smoothly the entire day went. We had a small honeymoon
,the house took all of our money so a couple of nights is all we got. We
got all settled in the evening back from the honeymoon and retired for
the evening. Our mattress and boxsprings on the floor we snuggled up for
our first night in our new home together as husband and wife. Being newleyweds
ofcourse it didn't take much snuggling for it to turn to more. And then
it happened...right in the middle of our "snuggling" I saw it for the first
time. Just standing at the foot of our bed. It was very tall and dark.
I whispered to my husband that someone was at the foot of our bed and he
quickly grabbed the gun that had a place by the bed and it dissappeared.
My husband asked, "where the hell is someone? There is nothing there!".
I told him everything that I saw. The part that shook me up was that well...we
had tore out a small closet in the bedroom to make it bigger. We found
all kinds of things between the walls that were of that period. The house
remind you was very old. There was no way these things could have gotten
in there. My husband being a construction worker looked for a reasonable
explaination (he didn't believe in any hoogy-boogy stuff. No way could
he figure this out so we just brushed the whole thing under the rug. I
proceeded to tell him the big black figure flew up inside the closet! He
just looked at me and said it was only my eyes playing tricks on me. I
had a very hard time falling to sleep that night. Time and life went on
in our little home. Friends over on the weekends playing cards releaving
the weeks stress. Yes, this was a happy time.I happened to mention to one
of our guests one night about the fact that our little dog Sasha would
lay in the guest bedroom all the time and growl at the closet in there.
I thought this to be odd since it was my closet that I thought I saw the
shadow float up into. Why did she not growl at my closet? So as scared
as I could possibly be I decided the next day to empty out this closet
just to help my fear. I felt as though the entire time someone was there.
I can't explain this feeling other than it's a feeling you will never forget
once you've experienced it. I never opened that closet door again. Sightings
of this dark,tall shadow started to be a frequent thing for me but I never
mentioned it to my husband. I was afraid he would think I was loosing it.
The sightings quickly turned into things being moved around. Mainly just
small objects that I was momentarily using at the time. Such as a hair
brush. When I would lay it down to spray my hair it would be gone when
I would reach back for it. That should tell you how focused in on my hair
I was. I would find my house keys outside on our back porch in the washer
and odd stuff like that. This soon turned to having something litterally
sit next to me on the couch at all times of the day and night. I stood
in the doorway to our living room one evening and watched the impression
of someone sit down in a chair. Complete with the wicker chair crackling
from the weight of NOTHING? Why could I not see the shadow during these
times. It was like it would let me see it when it wanted to. Is this possible?
Within a year the honeymooners were fighting all the time. I finally got
up enough nerve to ask him if he had ever seen this shadow figure, seen
or heard anything or ever felt like being watched. Yes to all the above.
I don't know if I was releived or frightened more by this. I decided that
I had to get out of there so I packed a suitcase and went home to mom &amp;
dad. Within a weeks time my husband was hanging little tine handmade nooses
up all over our cute little house. This scared me enough that I quickly
returned back to the house to try and figure out what in the world he was
doing. It didn't take long to find out that within that week he had started
having these strange black out spells and threatening suicide! To make
this painful story short I did all I thought I could do and moved out to
leave him in that haunted hell hole. A few weeks later I got "the phone
call". My husband had hung himself in the very closet that I had seen the
shadow go into. If anyone has any advice on what this could have been please
help. NOTE; This house was not haunted to my knowledge prior to this. I
knew the lady that lived there. Her and her husband were the original owners.
Her husband passed away leaving her the house. I don't know if he passed
in the house. I never got to ask her that. She died after she sold us the
house and moved into a nursing home. Thanks for any suggestions. Oh, I
should say that this experience has turned me into a huge ghost lover.
You would think I'd be a big chicken now. This is by far my worst haunting.
I have had many. I'm remarried now and have this sort of weird shit to
happen all the time. My mother does to. We have thought about seeking questions.
Can there be people that pick up spirits while out and bring them home?
Well, Thank you for the chance to tell my story. Let me know if you want
more.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Hi, my name is Evan and I am currently checking with students at
Smith</b>
<br><b>College for stories of paranormal activity on campus.</b>
<br><b>I noticed your list of "haunted places" and (geez, thanks alot!)
now I'm</b>
<br><b>totally interested. I just posted a request on the campus online
forum this</b>
<br><b>afternoon and I just recieved a reply from a student living in Martha
Wilson</b>
<br><b>House...she had alot to say. After she grants permission, I hope
to forward</b>
<br><b>her story to you guys, as well as any other info I get. I've heard
rumours</b>
<br><b>that on campus, there are other areas that are possibly haunted
but aren't</b>
<br><b>mentioned on your site. My girlfriend (a senior at Smith) told me
about</b>
<br><b>spending a night in the infirmary (heath services building) and
was grabbed</b>
<br><b>by unseen hands. Other places could include the daycare center (across
the</b>
<br><b>street from the infirmary),Morrow House's Maids Corridor, and Baldwin
House.</b>
<br><b>I have become extremely interested in stories regarding Smith and
the NoHo</b>
<br><b>Asylum, especially due to the age of both locations and the fact
that they</b>
<br><b>are located in extremely close proximity with each other.</b>
<br><b>If you guys have any info regarding the asylum (I'm a Canadian and
would</b>
<br><b>hate to be deported for trespass), I would appreciate it.</b>
<br><b>I'll keep you guys posted about these places before I head to Seattle</b>

<p><b>Ghost stories: My experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: fire4luke@netscape.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I was a Security officer at Modesto Jr. College. It has two
campuses and the West campus Law Enforcement training facility used to
be the old State Hospital. While on rounds there we had to check all of
the windows on the barrack type buildings to make sure that they were closed.
I would walk what was called the 1/4 mile hallway first to make sure all
of the doors on the hallway were locked. Many times I would have to chase
down subjects that would be at the other end of the hallway and then turn
the corner.... but as you would guess when I would get there no one would
be in the dead-end hallway. The people would be dressed in hospital gowns
and were usually older males approx. in their 70's. One time while in class,
a group of students observed a older male in his 70's walk right through
the room they were sitting in and disappear down the hall. When they followed
him, he vanished. Apparently when the hospital was in operation, many unexplained
deaths occurred in a short per!</b>
<br><b>iod of time.</b>

<p><b>Great Grandma</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sarash11@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Not long after my Great-Grandma died i had a really REALLY bad stomache
ache and a horrible headache. When you first seen an agel you see them
out of the corner of your eye. Well, i was sitting on the couch moaning
in pain when suddenly out of the corner of my eye a figure appeared. It
looked just like my Great-Grandma. It was moveing around and i was kind
of scared. It was an angel. I suddenly felt warm from head to toe and i
fell asleep for like 5 minuets. When i woke up i was all better. It was
as if i never had this sickness. Then, it felt as if a hand touched my
shoulder and said it's alright. It was my Great-Grandma. My Gaurdian Angel!</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I have previously sent my experiences in a haunted house I lived
in. I have</b>
<br><b>also summited a place to the Haunted Paces Index, now I have a more
recent</b>
<br><b>experience to share. I should start out by saying that I have a
special gift</b>
<br><b>for communicating with the dead. My mother has this gift so does
one of her</b>
<br><b>sisters as well as my grandfather when he was alive. Subsequently
I have more</b>
<br><b>that several entities following me around. Anyway two years ago
after I</b>
<br><b>graduated from high school I moved to my parents basement and converted
it to</b>
<br><b>an apartment. They let me live here rent free which is more than
a great deal</b>
<br><b>for a poor college student. While living here in my basement dwelling
I</b>
<br><b>acquired a new entity. He is 's very a seven year old little boy.
I tend to</b>
<br><b>think he died of aids or some other terminal disease. He's very
sweet and I</b>
<br><b>don't mind him hanging around. I have only seen him twice in the
form of a</b>
<br><b>small child sized shadow. The reason I have seen him so few times
is because</b>
<br><b>I told him he was welcome to stay with me as long as he wanted if
he didn't</b>
<br><b>try to scare me. I have heard him many times, giggling and calling
me mommy</b>
<br><b>for some reason and saying I love you. I have no children of my
own yet. He</b>
<br><b>kept his promise but he can be a little michiviouis as all children
can. I</b>
<br><b>have a stuffed pink panther that's over 4 feet tall standing in
my room. It's</b>
<br><b>to heavy to ever fall over on it's own but I constantly find it
laying face</b>
<br><b>down on the ground. He helps me find things when I lose them which
is often.</b>
<br><b>Once I somehow misplaced a pair of my work out shorts. I had looked
all</b>
<br><b>through my basement and even removed each piece of clothing out
of my closet</b>
<br><b>while searching. I gave up and went up stairs and asked my Mom if
she had</b>
<br><b>seen them she hadn't. When I went back into my closet later I found
a my</b>
<br><b>clothes neatly pushed of to each side on the rode. In the middle
hanging all</b>
<br><b>by themselves and sticking out obtrusively were my shorts. I asked
davey if</b>
<br><b>he found them then I heard a giggle. Also I every once in a while
I come home</b>
<br><b>to find my tv on and turned to my favorite channel (Court tv) as
well as my</b>
<br><b>lava lamp going. The other thing he likes are all my stuffed animals
and</b>
<br><b>dolls I never had the heart to get rid of. I constantly find them
over</b>
<br><b>turned, out of the usual spot or faceing the oppisite way. I know
this is</b>
<br><b>getting long so I'll wrap it up. Besides davey the ghost of my cat
whom I</b>
<br><b>just had to put to sleep in august. While sleeping at night I can
still feel</b>
<br><b>her in her usual spot on the bed and can sometime hear her purring.
It's a</b>
<br><b>nice warm loving presence,she was my sole mate since I was five
years old and</b>
<br><b>I miss her a lot. Anyway that's all folks I never told and one these
things</b>
<br><b>so it just between us :)</b>

<br><b>Addition to Camp Zama</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jennwurz@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I just read the anonymous account for the story</b>
<br><b>regarding "Camp Zama" and I can't tell you how freaked</b>
<br><b>out I am.&nbsp; My parents and I lived in Sagami-Hara from</b>
<br><b>1984-1987 - and I can back up the account of</b>
<br><b>hauntings.&nbsp; However, we did NOT know that the grounds</b>
<br><b>had formerly been a cemetery!!!!!!&nbsp; Nor did we know of</b>
<br><b>the history of both Camp Zama and Sagami-Hara.</b>
<br><b>On two separate occasions my dad had been pushed down</b>
<br><b>the stairs - now, normally when a person slips on a</b>
<br><b>stair they slip backwards and fall on their rears.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>felt a force pushing him squarely on the shoulders -</b>
<br><b>and fell face first.&nbsp; My mother was standing on the</b>
<br><b>outside patio and was pushed sideways into the flower</b>
<br><b>bed.&nbsp; She was simply standing with me, talking to a</b>
<br><b>neighbor.&nbsp; There was no way she could have just fallen</b>
<br><b>outright, for no reason or for lack of footing.</b>
<br><b>At the time, I was about 10 years old, and although</b>
<br><b>children could carry an imagination or fear of</b>
<br><b>'monsters under the bed' - I saw an evil face burned</b>
<br><b>into the wall of my bedroom.&nbsp; So frightening that</b>
<br><b>often I had to run downstairs to the living room to</b>
<br><b>sleep, because I would wake up screaming often, if I</b>

<br><b>Group Home Demon</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: A49erfan3310@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My mother and many other employees used to work in a group home for
mentally</b>
<br><b>retarded teenagers and adults. They were called "Clients". For their
privacy</b>
<br><b>(and sanity) I will give no names, however, the home is in Cicero,
Indiana.</b>
<br><b>There were many witnesses to all occurrances in this home, so I
was inclined</b>
<br><b>to believe it. I "used to be" very skeptic. Afew years after the
house became</b>
<br><b>a group home, some of the employees would hear strange noises, sense</b>
<br><b>presences and cold spots. Anyway, one night after dinner while everyone
was</b>
<br><b>in the kitchen, they all heard a door slam. But the entire house
shook when</b>
<br><b>this happened. No human could use such force. This got their attention.
Most</b>
<br><b>nights after that, they would always hear 3 knocks on any wall in
the house.</b>
<br><b>Does this indicate the 666 thing?&nbsp; Things happened every night
to some of the</b>
<br><b>employees but not all. One would get his hair pulled, the other
would hear</b>
<br><b>screaming in his ear, another nothing at all. There were door slams
in the</b>
<br><b>same room everyone was in and only one would hear it and none of
the others.</b>
<br><b>One day...well, several days it would show itself. They all concurred
that</b>
<br><b>this thing was black with red eyes and about 6 feet tall. It had
no human</b>
<br><b>qualities about it of course, and it looked as if it had scales.
By this time</b>
<br><b>every one was terrified. My mother was one of the employees it had
the most</b>
<br><b>fun with. It constantly harassed her and mimicked her. Every day
the</b>
<br><b>harassment grew stronger and more evil. It began harassing the clients
which</b>
<br><b>angered my mom and the others. They all decided to reach out to
God and the</b>
<br><b>Bible. This always enraged the evil spirit or demon and it would
go nuts! It</b>
<br><b>would turn the volume up all the way on the tv, turn all the lights
out, slam</b>
<br><b>doors,etc. Every time they got on the phone for help and started
talking</b>
<br><b>about the demon they would either get cut off or there would be
too much</b>
<br><b>static to talk so they had to hang up. I could go on for 2 hours
about what</b>
<br><b>happened there. Just a few for now. It used to form itself into
one of the</b>
<br><b>employees or clients, i mean make itself look like one of them.
But it never</b>
<br><b>was perfect when it did that, it would have something missing like
an eye or</b>
<br><b>ear or finger. One day when a male employee was in the living room,
one of</b>
<br><b>the clients was sitting on the couch watching tv. There was a mirror
on the</b>
<br><b>wall beside the couch. The employee looked in the mirror and said
he saw a</b>
<br><b>black hand around the client's neck. Some nights it would hide in
the</b>
<br><b>clients' closets and scare them when they were in bed. They became
too scared</b>
<br><b>to go to bed each night. One client described it as "lightning in
the closet</b>
<br><b>and scary noises".&nbsp; It used to move furniture around a lot,
too. One night my</b>
<br><b>dad went to visit mom there and the thing messed with him pretty
hard. It</b>
<br><b>pulled his hair all night until finally my dad said something nasty
to it.</b>
<br><b>When my dad got home that night,</b>
<br><b>he turned on the kitchen light as usual and the bulb blew. He put

<br><b>one and it blew. He put in yet another and it blew. Finally he got
one in</b>
<br><b>that did not blow. I suppose it could have been a bad box of bulbs.
Later</b>
<br><b>when he was in bed, he was awakened in the middle of the night to
see the</b>
<br><b>black mass of scales and red eyes. His reaction to this was "Get
out of here</b>
<br><b>you don't belong here" and rolled over to sleep again. A few minutes
later he</b>
<br><b>said it was gone. That same night, he said his longtime guardian
angel</b>
<br><b>visited and comforted him. If there's evil, there has to be good.
He never</b>
<br><b>told my mom this and I don't have to tell you why. Another night
my dad heard</b>
<br><b>growling in his ear that got progressively louder. Freaked him out!
The dog</b>
<br><b>was asleep. Another night mother was in the bathroom at home with
the door</b>
<br><b>shut and the dog was in there with her. He started growling at the
door and</b>
<br><b>she was too afraid to open it. The thing knocked 3 times on her
bedroom wall</b>
<br><b>a couple of times, too. She pretended she didn't hear it.&nbsp;
Like I said, I</b>
<br><b>could go on for hours telling you all the things this thing did.
Just to let</b>
<br><b>you know, they had a Preacher or someone like that come to bless
the house</b>
<br><b>and say a prayer, but that did not get rid of it, only quieted it
a little.</b>
<br><b>The group home is no longer there, it has become some other business-good</b>
<br><b>luck to them, they're going to need it.</b>

<p><b>Basement Suite</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dandrea@sprint.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>Well my story goes like this....</b><b></b>
<p><b>I used to live with another girl in a very new house downstairs in
the</b>
<br><b>basement suite. At first everything was normal. Eventually we started</b>
<br><b>hearing a cat's meow. Figuring it was just the neighbours upstairs
it was no</b>
<br><b>big deal to us. Eventually the noises became louder, closer to the
door that</b>
<br><b>seperated us from the stairs going upstairs, the cat just sat there
and</b>
<br><b>meowed. Finally feeling a bit annoyed, we confronted the people
upstairs</b>
<br><b>about thier cat, they denied even owning one.</b>
<br><b>Another night I came home from a night of partying. I will admit
to being</b>
<br><b>drunk but I know what I know. Feeling the urgent need to go to the
bathroom</b>
<br><b>like most people do after drinking more than thier body wieght.
Being male I</b>
<br><b>stood in front of the toilet doing my business. Directly in front
of me is a</b>
<br><b>mirror and to the right is the counter. Halfway through doing my
business I</b>
<br><b>all of a sudden felt a push from behind me. Hard enough that I stumbled</b>
<br><b>forward. Out of reflex I yelled a startled sound that I have never
heard</b>
<br><b>from me before. I looked in the mirror to see if anyone was behind
me. No</b>
<br><b>one there. I immidiately felt the cold chills race through my body
until I</b>
<br><b>left the bathroom. I went to check to see if my roomate was home,
she</b>
<br><b>wasn't, I was alone. Needless to say, I stayed up most of the night
trying</b>
<br><b>to figure out what had just occured.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Feminine Face</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: res078us@gte.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>The story I'm going to relate is absolutely true.&nbsp; It occurred
when I was 15 years old and is the only significant experience I've ever
had.&nbsp; I'm not a psychically sensitive person which made it all the
more frightening.&nbsp; So...here goes:&nbsp; As I've already mentioned,
I was 15 years old. I had retired for the evening to my bedroom where I
immediately fell asleep.&nbsp; My step-mother had an annoying/endearing
habit of bending down and placing her face next to mine and my sister's
faces while we slept to make sure we were breathing.&nbsp; That is why
when I awoke approximately 2 hours after going to sleep I wasn't surprised
to see a feminine face about 3 inches from my own.&nbsp; She was staring
into my eyes and had (in hindsight) a rather maniacal smile on her face.&nbsp;
I remember two thoughts coming to mind at the time.&nbsp; The first thought
was "She's checking to see if I'm breathing" and the second was "Wow! She
looks really old and mean up close."&nbsp; I began to laugh and sat up
suddenly.&nbsp; The face stayed about three inches from my face until I
was fully sitting up.&nbsp; Then the face simply disappeared.&nbsp; I leaped
from my bed and ran to where my father and step-mother were having drinks
in the kitchen.&nbsp; I was petrified and shaking visibly.&nbsp; Well...that's
it!&nbsp; I would welcome any theories about what that might have been
(besides my imagination as I've already accepted that as a definite possibility).</b>

<br><b>Uncles Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Bass4rp@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi my name is nate, and my uncle told me about a haunted cematary
he used to</b>
<br><b>go to in the 70's.&nbsp; So I decided to take my friends there with
me at night,</b>
<br><b>becuase we like to get scared.&nbsp; Well it is called Aux Sable
cematary in</b>
<br><b>minooka, illinois.&nbsp; To get back there it is about 2 miles of
road along a</b>
<br><b>tree line, then finally the tree line stops and it is just forrest,
you then</b>
<br><b>enter the forrest on a dirt road for a 1/4 mile, and go over a creek
on a</b>
<br><b>stone bridge, then finally getting into the cematary.&nbsp; The
whole cematary is</b>
<br><b>about 200 yards squared.&nbsp; The cematary is inactive so it is
pretty old.&nbsp; Well</b>
<br><b>we get there and always walk around for a little while, but 3 out
of the 5</b>
<br><b>times we have gone there, this thing happens.&nbsp; We are in the
middle of the</b>
<br><b>graveyard, and we see headlights coming down the 1/4 mile trail,
so we run</b>
<br><b>and get in our cars, and we go fly down the trail because we think
its a cop,</b>
<br><b>but everytime we go right up to the headlights coming at us on the
trail, and</b>
<br><b>the car just dissapears.&nbsp; It can't be another source of light
becuase the</b>
<br><b>nearest light was 2 miles back when we got off of an actual road.&nbsp;
This seems</b>
<br><b>really odd.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Haunted Life</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Sixstringslim@gateway.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; I am 41 years old and have a lifetime of strange happenings
.&nbsp; The first haunting I can remember was when I was living in Peru
Indiana.&nbsp; It was in a house in town back in the mid 60's.&nbsp; I
remember that my sister's and my rooms were upstairs on the second floor.&nbsp;
Note: we NEVER slept up there.&nbsp; Mainly because we both knew that there
was something there.&nbsp; Sometimes when we were playing, my parents would
here a person falling down the steps and banging hard against the door
at the bottom.&nbsp; They thought it was one of us, run to the door and
open it only to find that there was onone there.&nbsp; Then there was the
nioses outside the house.&nbsp; One time I remember my uncle who was home
on leave was watching my sister and I so our parents could go out.&nbsp;
It had snowed that day and the ground was covered.&nbsp; That evening,
we heard someone running around outside the house, banging on the walls.&nbsp;
My uncle (an Army NCO) went outside to confront the person, again, no body
was there.&nbsp; And there were no tracks in the snow. needless to say,
he never came back to that house again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; In the mid-70's my dad built our own home in Irvine, Kentucky.&nbsp;
we lived there for about two years with nothing happening.&nbsp; They (my
parents) decided to build an addition on to the house.&nbsp; The original
house became all bedrooms.&nbsp; The new part was the new livingroom and
kitchen/dinning room.&nbsp; Thats when things started happening.&nbsp;
At first there were nioses in the attic, we thought they were cats that
had gotten up there somehow. But we could never find them.&nbsp; Then the
sightings started.&nbsp; There was an access hole to the attic that was
covered up with a piece of drywall.&nbsp; The dryall had broken and everytime
we walked through the hall, we could see up into the attic.&nbsp; Sometimes
I could see something looking back at me! And it was'nt no cat.&nbsp; I
would only catch a glimpse, and it would scurry away, I never saw what
it really looked like.&nbsp;&nbsp; My sister said she saw it once, she
was washing her hair in the bathroom sink (the bathroom door was right
below the opening), when she finished she wrapped a towel arond her head,
turned to walk out of the room, and standing in the hall was what she described
as a small creature, about 2 feet tall, pionted ears and all black.&nbsp;
She said it acted suprized she saw it, and moved sideways real fast and
dissapeared.&nbsp; My mom says that sometimes she would goo into her bedroom
and see an indention in the blankets and pillow of a where a small body
had lain.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; About this time my brother was born.&nbsp; The sightings
and noises were growing at a steady pace.&nbsp; I recall once, now this
is what really scared me the most, I had made a comment to my mom that
I diddnt belive in ghosts.&nbsp; Now my mother had a heavy brass ashtray
that was passed down to her by her father.&nbsp; We were in the livingroom
watching TV.&nbsp; She was on the couch, I was on the floor sitting under
the large pitcure window.. The ashtray was on top of the mantle over the
fireplace accross the room.&nbsp; I made the statement that I diddnt believe
in ghosts, Then I heard a loud crash right by my head.&nbsp; I thought
someone out side the window had banged into the wall.&nbsp; I turned to
look, when I saw the ashtray on the floor by my hand.&nbsp; Mom said she
saw it fly off the mantle and just missed hitting me.&nbsp; I went to my
room and put on my headphones to listen to my sterio, when the whole thing
came crashing down on my head. (It was on a shelf above my bed)&nbsp; So
I went back into the livingroom and told her that I DO believe in ghosts.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; As the years went by, We just accepted what was going on
around us.&nbsp; I was in my senior year in school, my sister had married
and my brother was about to start head start.&nbsp; One night, I was laying
in bed trying to sleep, I had to go to school the next day I saw something
new.&nbsp; I was laying there about to drift off, that grey area between
awake and sleep.&nbsp; I saw, floating over my bed , a whitish colored,
misty "ball".&nbsp; It looked like it might have been made of smoke or
something, I watched it swirl around then float up to the ceiling and dissapear
into the crack where the wall meets the ceiling.&nbsp; Then suddenly I
was wide awake.&nbsp; I realized that I had just seen something that should'nt
have been there.&nbsp; I got up an went into the livingroom where I sat
and watched TV.&nbsp; My sister was visiting us and her and mom was still
up.&nbsp; I never said a word to them.&nbsp; I sat up with them untill
I finally got up the nerve to go back to bed.&nbsp; The next day My dad
drove me to school, and I told him of the inncident.&nbsp; He asked if
I told mom.&nbsp; I said no and he said not to.&nbsp; My dad always refused
to believe anything was happening there.&nbsp; I found out why he diddnt
want me to say anything to mom.&nbsp; It seems that she had seen the same
thing only two days before.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; After that incident, I graduated, left home and jioned the
Navy.&nbsp; But things only got worse after I left.&nbsp; It seems that
what ever was in that house was after my baby brother, and finally ran
my family out in the middle of the night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; The stories I got from home was that first, my brother had
got a cat, and the cat turned on him one day for no reason at all.&nbsp;
He had gone down to the natural spring at the back of the house, and the
cat jumped into the water and reached up and tried to pull him in! the
next day they found the cat, It was at the front door of the house, decapitated.
We dont know who did it or why.&nbsp; The last straw was one night they
were all in bed, my brother was sleeping in between my parents.&nbsp; My
mother woke up, something had grabed my brother and was pulling him towards
the foot of the bed.&nbsp; Mom grabed him and held on.&nbsp; She was yelling
at dad to wake up to help her.&nbsp; When he finnaly woke up, he saw mom
holding Bryans arms, his little bod was susspended in air, as if someone
else was holding his feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He fell to the bed then, they
packed what the could in a hurry and left.&nbsp; They sold the house to
an uncle of mine, he claims that he has never had any problems in that
house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Now the house was built on old farm land. But right next
to a very old cemitary.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also When My grandpaw used to plant
corn on the lot before we built the house, after he plowed we would always
find old arrowheads and things like that. (All over the farm actually)&nbsp;
I dont know if either of these things had anything to do with what went
on in that house or not.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Any doubts if anything I said here are ture or not, I'm sure
that you could find doccumented evedence.&nbsp; After my family left, news
got out about the house, there was a piece about it on the news, and some
students from Eastern Ky. University had gone to the house.&nbsp; To study
it.&nbsp; They diddnt last the entire night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Now while these things were still happening at home, I was
off on my own life adventures.&nbsp; I had joined the Navy.&nbsp; I had
read once that all military bases and ships had their fare share of ghosts.&nbsp;
I recall one incident when I had to stand barracks watch.&nbsp; I would
make my rounds of the barracks, the I had to make rounds in the barracks
next to ours.&nbsp; The squadrons in the next barracks had gone to sea,
and it was our responsibility to watch them.&nbsp; I was making my rounds
in there, I was the only person in there.&nbsp; Everytime I made my rounds,
all three floors I could hear footsteps following me until I left. I would
stop, they would stop.&nbsp; It was just something nerve racking. I was
stationed in Virginia Beach.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; In 1980, I had married, and was transfered to San Diego.&nbsp;
I went there and rented a trailor for us.&nbsp; I brought my wife and daughter
there.&nbsp; I never had any problems there by myself.&nbsp; When I would
go out to sea for a couple of weeks, my wife told me strange things went
on there.&nbsp; She would go to bed every night, wake up the next morning
and all of the windows would be opened.&nbsp; One night we were in bed,
just playing around, tickling each other, she went over the edge of the
bed.&nbsp; She sat there on the floor, we just laughed about it when from
the foot of the bed we both heard SOMONE moan.&nbsp; God, you should have
seen her move.&nbsp; she jumped back in bed, we looked at the foot of the
bed but there was no one there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I had since lived in two other haunted places, both in Whidby
Island Washington.&nbsp; The first was a real nice appartment.&nbsp; It
was brand new, we were actually the first family to have lived there.&nbsp;
But that diddnt mean annything to whatever else occupied the same space.&nbsp;
In that place I remember hearing a little girl cry out for her mommy, I
thought it was my daughter.&nbsp; It was comming from the bathroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I had just returned home from work, My wife's car was gone.&nbsp; I thought
it was strange that she would leave our little girl at home by herself,
VERY unlike her.&nbsp; I asked through the door if she was allright, but
she never answered.&nbsp; I opened the door a crack.&nbsp; There was no
body inside.&nbsp; When my wife came home, she told that she had been hearing
the childs vioce comming from the bathroom.&nbsp; The scariest thing that
had ever happened in that house was one night we were sitting in the livingroom
watching TV.&nbsp; Right next to where I was sitting was a wall, on the
other side off the wall was our bedroom closet.&nbsp; I heard the loudest
thump and banging by my head, through that wall.&nbsp; I went into the
bedroom, opened the closet door.&nbsp; Nothing had been disturbed, nothing
had fallen to the floor.&nbsp; Exceept one item.&nbsp; Hardly heavy enough
to make a racket as loud as we heard.&nbsp; It was a paperback book that
I had just finished reading and put on the top shelf.&nbsp; A horror novel
called "The Keep".&nbsp; Every page had been ripped out of that book and
scattered all over the closet floor.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; The second place was in Navy housing.&nbsp; There we had
a mischevious little spirit wou would hide things on us.&nbsp; on time,
we were going to walk down to the grocery store.&nbsp; I went looking for
my gloves.&nbsp; I found one on the kitchen counter but could find the
other.&nbsp; When we came home from the store, there it was, on the kitchen
counter right where I found the first one.&nbsp; Just small things like
that happened there, nothing really scary.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; My last entry, by far the most thought provoking.&nbsp;
This one makes me believe in the paranormal more than anyother single incident.&nbsp;
If I hadd'nt been there and heard it for myself, I dont know.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; After I got out of the Navy, We moved back to Kentucky.&nbsp;
My wife's grandmother came to live with us.&nbsp; When she died of kiddney
failure, I found her that morning, I went to wake her for breakfast, she
had passed in the night.&nbsp; It was no big secret that my wife was her
favorite of all her grandkids.&nbsp; While she stayed with us she used
to come to our door in the middle of the night to make sure that we were
still there and all right.&nbsp; I diddnt know this at the time though.&nbsp;
A few days after the funeral I couldnt sleep one night and I heard footsteps
come to our door.&nbsp; I thought it was our daughter so I got up to see
what she wanted.&nbsp; Of coarse there was no body there.&nbsp; I went
to her room to check up on her and she was sound asleep in her bed.&nbsp;
The next day I told my wife about it.&nbsp; Thats when she told me about
her grandmothers late night trips.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; We moved out of that house after a while and was staying
at my wife's sister's house.&nbsp; One day not long after we were there
the bedroom phone rang.&nbsp; My sister-in-law looked at us very strangely
and went to answer it.&nbsp; Here is the conversation as I heard it: "Hello,
uh yes, she's alright, she's here with me"*click* When she came back to
the table, she was white as a ghost.&nbsp; She sat there for the longest
time untill finally my wife asked her who it was.&nbsp; I could see she
was on the verge of tears.&nbsp; She said "It was grandma she said she
was looking all around the house for you but couldnt find you.&nbsp; I
told her you were here with me"</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; The real kicker about this is that the Phone My sister-in-law
used was in the kitchen where we were.&nbsp; The only phone that rang was
the one in the bedroom.&nbsp; It was broken and not even pluged in.&nbsp;
Hence the strange look.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; That's about all I have, My daughter is now married,
I have a grand daughter.&nbsp; My wife and I have lived where we are now
for the last 7 years.&nbsp; We havent had any strange events here at this
place (so far).</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Oh there was one more I forgot.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was in
High school, a friend of mine was killed by a truck.&nbsp; The next day
in school everyone was saddened by the loss He was one of the very popular
kids.&nbsp; Second class chorus was where I believe We all "saw" him for
the last time.&nbsp; In order to get into the chorus room, it was seperate
from the school, you had to go outside and come in through heavy steel
doors.&nbsp; The kind that have that long bar in the middle you push to
open (This rules out wind, because wind would have to come from the inside
of the room and be very strong to push it open)&nbsp; There was one such
door on each side of the room.&nbsp; As we all sat there, remembering our
good friend, One of the doors just opened as it was closing we felt a small
breeze.&nbsp; When the door closed all the way, the door on the oppisite
side of the room opened and closed back.&nbsp; To this day, I believe it
was Bo making a last trip through the school.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Haunted House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sassey5@flash.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Here is one that I'd like to share.&nbsp; When I was in high school
our</b>
<br><b>family moved into a beautiful old two story house.&nbsp; This home
had 4</b>
<br><b>fireplaces and was a mansion in it's day.</b>
<br><b>My parents started experiencing objects being moved but they didn't</b>
<br><b>think much of it because they were also believers and pretty much</b>
<br><b>something happened in each old house we lived in.&nbsp; Dad would
be watching</b>
<br><b>TV and the TV would either turn off or change channels by it self.</b>
<br><b>Remember this was not a remote control TV.&nbsp; After several times
of</b>
<br><b>having to get up and correct it, dad finally said "That's enough"
and it</b>
<br><b>would stop for the night.</b>
<br><b>I would rarely go into my sister's room which was upstairs directly</b>
<br><b>across the hall from mine.&nbsp; Nor would I ever go into a room
at the very</b>
<br><b>back of the house on the second floor.&nbsp; I had a very bad feeling
about</b>
<br><b>these rooms.&nbsp; Once while in my room I heard a crashing sound
come from</b>
<br><b>my sister's room.&nbsp; Knowing my sister was not home, I went into
her room</b>
<br><b>to see what was going on.&nbsp; I found that everything on her fireplace</b>
<br><b>mantel was on the floor as if someone was angry and just took their
arm</b>
<br><b>across the mantel knocking everything off.&nbsp; Also found all
her clothes</b>
<br><b>in the closet on the floor.&nbsp; I just cleaned up the mess and
left.</b>
<br><b>One night, I was the only one home and was in my room with my door</b>
<br><b>locked.&nbsp; I woke up to find a man with dark hair and dressed
all in blue</b>
<br><b>leaning over me.&nbsp; I just thought it was my father and closed
my eyes,</b>
<br><b>suddenly realizing my father was not at home, I opened my eyes to
see</b>
<br><b>the man was gone and my door was still locked.&nbsp; I didnt tell
anyone</b>
<br><b>until a couple of days later after my brother had an experieence.</b>
<br><b>My brother had just come home and was walking up the stairs to go
to his</b>
<br><b>room and about 1 minute later came running down the stairs white
as a</b>
<br><b>sheet.&nbsp; He told&nbsp; me that there was a man standing in his
bedroom</b>
<br><b>doorway.&nbsp; I asked him if it was a young darkhaired man dressed
in blue.</b>
<br><b>He said no it was a elderly man with white hair.&nbsp; That was
when I told</b>
<br><b>my parents about what I saw.&nbsp; My mother later say the elderly
man as she</b>
<br><b>walked into my brother's room to check on him because he had been
sick.</b>
<br><b>She saw the elderly man sitting in a chair at the foot of my brother's</b>
<br><b>bed smiling at her.</b>
<br><b>The spirits never bothered us or caused us harm.&nbsp; But I have
spoken to</b>
<br><b>others who have had violent experiences with the spirits.&nbsp;
The current</b>
<br><b>owner while remodeling the home has told me of times items have
been</b>
<br><b>thrown at them and their guests.&nbsp; While replacing water lines
he found a</b>
<br><b>headstone under the foundation of the home.&nbsp; It was the grave
of a 17</b>
<br><b>year old boy who had been shot and killed while sitting on the porch.</b>
<br><b>The owner let us in the home and I still to this day feel the presence</b>
<br><b>in the home but they never bother me.&nbsp; However, I am constantly
flagged</b>
<br><b>with dreams of the house and spirits in the home trying to contact
me.</b>
<br><b>I know this sounds odd but I feel there is a connection here.&nbsp;
I'm not</b>
<br><b>done researching it either to find out what is going on.&nbsp; It's
still a</b>
<br><b>beautiful old house and I'd love to own it and live in it once again.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Haunting in Chicago</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: PossumPrincess88@msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I had a few scary experiences while I was in Chicago.&nbsp; I was
staying at my friends house and we went out to dinner that night.&nbsp;
I had left my backpack zipped up in the guest bedroom.&nbsp; When I came
back, my backpack was open and all my things were scattered around the
room.&nbsp; The next experience was when I was standing with my back facing
the door way.&nbsp; I heard footsteps and when I turned around they stopped.&nbsp;
The last experience was when I was going to bed and I got up to shut the
door.&nbsp; I shut it and when I was walking back to the bed, the door
opened.&nbsp; I tried to shut it again, but it wouldn't shut.&nbsp; It
was like a force was holding it open!</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp;Heres My Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: nin@n.bnet.Nb.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>my name is sarah&nbsp; and i am a 20 yr. old from&nbsp; new brunswick.
i wanted to share my experience with you as i feel it may be of some benefit
to those who feel that they are 'haunted" by a ghost.</b>
<br><b>quite the contrary in my opinion. I was protected by a ghost as
a small child.i was a mere infant when we lived with this ghost. he was
an early gentleman who had burned in the house many many years ago.</b>
<br><b>When my mother had chosen to take the appartment, the landlord had
neglected to mention his knowledge of it being haunted.</b>
<br><b>We soon discovered that we were definately not alone. Though there
was definately a presence in our house, we were not terrified or disturbed
in any way. we soon became accustomed to him and soon named him "hermon".</b>
<br><b>Hermon made his presence known to others only when he deemed it
necessary.</b>
<br><b>i was very ill as aninfant and my heart and lungs would collapse
at a moments notice...no cry, no warning of any sort. Hermon would make
himself seen at my doorway, peering over me. all you could see was a tall
slender man dressed in a top hat, with coat tails. this however was only
an outline. I'm terribly sorry my history is hindered...i'm not familiar
with what period he would be from.</b>
<br><b>Hermon had also turned on a light which held no light bulb for several
months to waken my older brother to prevent him from falling down flights
of stairs that would definately have killed him.</b>
<br><b>herman also had a habbit of slamming cupboard doors and drawers
when someone would approach that he deemed unsafe to be in our home. If
we persisted...he would slam the door a jar. (we never encountered any
problems with the door however except when the cupboards would slam)</b>
<br><b>So as you can see...it has never occured to me to be scared of ghosts.
i feel very comforted and at ease with the thoughts of being surrounded
with ghosts. Fear has never entered my mind.</b>
<br><b>Icurrently live approximately 1 mile from the old appartment, which
for some unspoken reason remains almost constantly empty. I on the other
hand have a comforting feelinf that Hermon still resides there waiting
for his next "family" to watch over.</b>
<br><b>Thank you very much for your time, and i hope that this story may
come as some comfort to somebody else.</b>

and its awsome that</b>
<br><b>someone actually made one!&nbsp; You must get a lot of ****, but
i promise you</b>
<br><b>that this isnt.&nbsp; A few years ago this old house was bought

the house</b>
<br><b>because it was an indiana historical monument but they were going
to tear it</b>
<br><b>down for the airport.&nbsp; Well she bought it and moved it.&nbsp;
It was this huge old</b>
<br><b>white house and from kids most of the windows had been broke out
and whatnot.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;But i guess some girl was shot by a hunter when she was playing
out in the</b>
<br><b>woods, and ever since she looks out the window.&nbsp; The indianapolis
star even</b>
<br><b>did a write up about the house and everything.&nbsp; Well myself
and my brother</b>
<br><b>Cliff, and my friends Chris, Felicia, Dustin, and Joe decided we
were going</b>
<br><b>to get inside.&nbsp; So we did we went through the house and Cliff
took a few</b>
<br><b>pointless things that were in there just like a nail and a butter
knife.</b>
<br><b>These things could have had no meaning whatsoever.&nbsp; Well the
next night Cliff</b>
<br><b>realized his picture that was hanging over the fireplace was upside
down.&nbsp; So</b>
<br><b>he awitched it around thinking i was trying to scare him.&nbsp;
And this happened</b>
<br><b>for a few weeks his picture was the only one upside down after we

<br><b>The Bedroom</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tlaws@freedomforum.org</b><b></b>
<p><b>About threes ago I was over one of my best girl friends house. Her
family</b>
<br><b>were having a barbecue;&nbsp; I forget what holiday we where celebrating,
anyway.</b>
<br><b>I've been over her house plenty of times before , so I know her
house inside</b>
<br><b>and out, but this day I was looking at the back of her house and
I saw a</b>
<br><b>window that was blacking out, so I ask her father what room does
that window</b>
<br><b>go to.&nbsp; He said that it goes to Tammies room (that was my friends
name)&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>said are you sure, so we all went up to Tammies room and non of
her windows</b>
<br><b>where blacked out.&nbsp; He said that was strange, so outside we
all went and</b>
<br><b>looked up at the window.&nbsp; Where on earth could that window
go to.&nbsp; he said.</b>
<br><b>His wife just told him not to worry about and to enjoy the barbecue.&nbsp;
He</b>
<br><b>said ok and we all had a good time that day, but over the weeks&nbsp;
the thought</b>
<br><b>of where that window went started to bother him.&nbsp; for weeks
he would stand</b>
<br><b>outside and then go up to Tammies room and stand on the outside
of it.&nbsp; Just</b>
<br><b>staring&nbsp; trying to figure out where the window was.&nbsp; One
day I was staying</b>
<br><b>the night over Tammies house and in the middle of the night.&nbsp;
We woke up to</b>
<br><b>this banging next to Tammies room.&nbsp; We walked out into the
hall and there we</b>
<br><b>saw Tammies mother, and Tammies father.&nbsp; John what&nbsp; are
you doing Tammies</b>
<br><b>mother ask her husband.&nbsp; Tammies father had a sledge hammer
and he was</b>
<br><b>knocking out the was next to Tammies room.&nbsp; I found out where
that window</b>
<br><b>is.&nbsp; But do you have to do this now.&nbsp; Her mom ask.&nbsp;
Yes I wont be able to</b>
<br><b>sleep until I find out.&nbsp; So I banged and he hit and around
6 am in the</b>
<br><b>morning he had finally knock the wall down.&nbsp; And what was there
was amazing.</b>
<br><b>It was a room that had bee sealed off.&nbsp; inside was a bed,&nbsp;
as nightstand and</b>
<br><b>a dresser.&nbsp; The bed was made up and on the bed was a bible
turn to</b>
<br><b>Revelations and on the night stand a glass of water filled to the
top of the</b>
<br><b>glass like it had just been filled.&nbsp; There was not way in this
room or out</b>
<br><b>this room until Tammies father knocked that wall down, and they
had been</b>
<br><b>living in that house for over 15 years.&nbsp; A hour later the water
evaporated.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Real Happenings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kkuhn@gtd.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I actually have a few stories I could tell, but the one that I feel
is the</b>
<br><b>most real is this one.&nbsp; We used to live in an old farm house.&nbsp;
The upstairs</b>
<br><b>was just our bedroom.&nbsp; No other rooms up there.&nbsp; At the
time my son was only</b>
<br><b>2 1/2 and he slept in a bed at the other end of the room.&nbsp;
I would take him</b>
<br><b>up to bed at night and we would watch a little tv before his bedtime.&nbsp;
This</b>
<br><b>particular night he started carrying on a conversation that I couldn't</b>
<br><b>really understand and he wasn't actually talking to me.&nbsp; I
asked who he was</b>
<br><b>talking to and he said grandma.&nbsp; I said that grandma wasn't
here and he said</b>
<br><b>Yes she is, she right there (pointing to the couch on the wall opposite
the</b>
<br><b>end of the bed).&nbsp; I never really figured out what the conversation
was but</b>
<br><b>neither of us we frightened.&nbsp; As I have said I have other little

<br><b>The Patapsco Female Institute</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: TheMax04@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>dear webmaster,</b>
<br><b>i was looking thru your site, and i saw the brief paragraph on the
ahunting</b>
<br><b>on the patapsco female institute, and i think you may be confused.
there is a</b>
<br><b>ghost at the instutute, but it has nothing to do with satansim,
thats another</b>
<br><b>house in ellicot city, which ill get to in&nbsp; a minute.</b>
<br><b>the pataspco female instutte was founded in the 1830's, and was
a prestigious</b>
<br><b>school for young southern girls. the facility was not the best however,
girls</b>
<br><b>often got sick and died, due to poor healthcare, and no plumbing
facilites,</b>
<br><b>all those chamber pots were malaria breeding grounds, im assuming.
i spent a</b>
<br><b>great bit of time there doing a play called dear old patapsco, about
a day in</b>
<br><b>the life of a young girl from the institute, and i got to see firsthand
the</b>
<br><b>cold spots especially at the top of the stairs, but the whole ruins
(and</b>
<br><b>thats what it is now) gives off energy,. onc, on the lower level
which is now</b>
<br><b>being dug up to find artifacts, a pair of feet, encased in leather
ankle</b>
<br><b>boots walking around. the story goes that a young woman, named annie,
wrote</b>
<br><b>letters to her parents, saying how unhappy she was to be in that
"prison",</b>
<br><b>and eventually fell ill and passed away. its her ghost who roams
around the</b>
<br><b>institute. coincidentally, the lead charactors name in our play
was also</b>
<br><b>named annie.</b>
<br><b>the school that had dabbled in satanism, is old st marys college,
nicknamed</b>
<br><b>hell house. its an old school about 3 miles away from the institute,
and is</b>
<br><b>an old catholic college. supposedly, there are phantom dogs who
attack you if</b>
<br><b>you tresspass, but the real creepy thing is the giant statue of
the virgin</b>
<br><b>mary that is on top of the school. when you climb the steps to go
up there,</b>
<br><b>its the first thing you see.</b>
<br><b>sorry, i didnt mean to correct you, or be an ass or anything, but&nbsp;
it irks</b>
<br><b>me, ive worked in the instutute, and its not a horrid, scary place
to be,</b>
<br><b>actually, ghost and all, its reallly quite pleasent.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Grandmothers House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: chapman120@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>About 6 years ago, when I was 12 years old, my Grandmother died and
my family</b>
<br><b>moved into her house. This was also the house my dad and his siblings
grew up</b>
<br><b>in, and for years I had heard stories of them seeing ghosts and
strange</b>
<br><b>things in the house.</b>
<br><b>It was a very old house, at least 100 years old. The poor thing
wasnt in the</b>
<br><b>best of shape, the ceiling looked as if it was getting ready to
fall in, and</b>
<br><b>the floor on the second floor was sinking. My bedroom was on the
second floor</b>
<br><b>and the floor in there was noticebly sunken. The only thing on the
first</b>
<br><b>floor was my grandmothers old wash room. It was also used as an
apartment</b>
<br><b>back 50 years ago because it had a kitchen and bathroom. It was
now used as a</b>
<br><b>storage room.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, I had very many experiences with ghosts in here, and so
did my mom,</b>
<br><b>dad, and older brother.</b>
<br><b>My grandpa was married twice before he married my grandma. Both
his wives</b>
<br><b>died in this house (I know what you're thinking, and no he didnt
murder them.</b>
<br><b>I think they both died of heart attacks. My grandpa was like 60
years old</b>
<br><b>when he married my grandma who was 35.)</b>
<br><b>I believe the spirits of these women, along with the spirit of my
grandpa</b>
<br><b>still live in this house.</b>
<br><b>I use to love visiting this house when my grandma was alive. Every
Sunday</b>
<br><b>from the day I was born to when my grandma died all her children
and their</b>
<br><b>familes would visit and have sunday supper. But when we moved into
the place</b>
<br><b>after she died it didnt feel the same. I no longer had the warm
cozy feeling</b>
<br><b>come over me when entering the front door which led directly to
the kitchen.</b>
<br><b>The only time I ever felt uncomfortable in the house when my grandma
was</b>
<br><b>alive was when I was visiting my grandma for sunday supper was one
day when I</b>
<br><b>was about 4 years old. My uncle lived in the house with my grandma,
and in</b>
<br><b>his room there was a huge blanket with a Lion's face on it hanging
on one of</b>
<br><b>his walls. I remember as I stared at the blanket I heard as plain
as day, a</b>
<br><b>Lion's roar. It scared me so much I ran to my mom crying.</b><b></b>
<p><b>In the TV room where my Grandma use to sleep (on the couch) there
was a very</b>
<br><b>old picture of my grandpa, he must have been like 25-30 years old
in the pic.</b>
<br><b>It was kind of spooky looking too though, I hated looking at the
picture</b>
<br><b>because it seemed like his eyes would follow you.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, my first experience with a ghost came one night when I stayed
up late</b>
<br><b>by myself to watch TV. I was in the living room sitting on the couch.
The way</b>
<br><b>the room was made was there was a huge, I'm talking gigantic window
on one</b>
<br><b>end. The whole wall was basically a window, it overlooked the road
down below</b>
<br><b>and directly across the road was a church, the church where my grandmas</b>
<br><b>funeral was held. There were two really old style chairs that belonged
to my</b>
<br><b>grandpa, one sitting on each side of the window. I was watching
TV when</b>
<br><b>suddenly I saw what looked like smoke floating in the air above
one of the</b>
<br><b>chairs. I kept watching as the smoke took on the figure of a face,
then</b>
<br><b>disappered. This scared the sh*t out of me! I ran into my mom and
dad's room</b>
<br><b>and jumped in bed with them.</b>
<br><b>About a week later a couple friend's from my basketball team stayed
the night</b>
<br><b>with me. We were the only ones up late one night, we were in the
living room</b>
<br><b>eating popcorn and talking, when suddenly from across the room in
the laundry</b>
<br><b>room the light came on. It scared the piss out of us! None of the
rooms in</b>
<br><b>the house had doors, instead sheets were hung to use as doors. As
we sat in</b>
<br><b>the living room terrified of what we had seen, the sheet to the
laundry</b>
<br><b>room's entrance flapped in a breeze. This was strange because no
windows were</b>
<br><b>opened, and the heater or ac wasnt on.</b>
<br><b>After this none of my friends wanted to stay the night with me again.
More</b>
<br><b>and more strange happenings involving the laundry room kept going
on. The</b>
<br><b>room was also refered to as the press because that was where my
grandma kept</b>
<br><b>her sewing machine and clothes. I told my dad about what happened
with the</b>
<br><b>light in the press, and he told me that other things have happened
in that</b>
<br><b>room. He said when he was about 7 or 8 that room was used as a bedroom
for</b>
<br><b>him and 2 of his 3 brothers. He was laying in bed one night when
he heard a</b>
<br><b>knocking sound on the window which face the side of his bed. He
looked up to</b>
<br><b>see what was making the noise and in the window were what he described
as</b>
<br><b>being 3 little men laughing and pointing for my dad to turn around
and look</b>
<br><b>behind him. My dad said he was too scared to turn around, and just
laid in</b>
<br><b>bed and covered his face with the covers.</b>
<br><b>My grandpa also slept in this room, and my aunts said that they
have seen him</b>
<br><b>in it after he died. Also in this room we found boxes full of my
grandpas old</b>
<br><b>coal mines pay stubs from back when he worked in the mines when
he was 12</b>
<br><b>years old. Some of them were for only 50 cents.</b>
<br><b>This room also had a strange smell, its kind of hard to describe
though. We</b>
<br><b>also found a picture in there of my grandpas second wife, Edna.
It was very</b>
<br><b>spooky looking, her eyes were plain white, no pupil or anything
in the</b>
<br><b>picture. I was so scared of the pic that I burnt it.</b>
<br><b>Other things happened as well, like the TV would turn on and off
by its self,</b>
<br><b>lights would come on, the microwave would turn on, one night I even
saw an</b>
<br><b>old woman laying in my bed. I was constently bothered with nightmares
about</b>
<br><b>the place, I'd wake up in the middle of the night because of loud
noises like</b>
<br><b>footsteps and people talking. I would see shadows of people walking
through</b>
<br><b>the rooms and cold breezes would sweep by me.</b>
<br><b>Later I learned that there were more ghosts in the place and not
just my</b>
<br><b>grandpa and his 2 dead wives, I believe my grandma was also there,
along with</b>
<br><b>my uncle who had died of a drug overdose.</b>
<br><b>My dads 1st cousin lived in the house beside ours, and one night
he drunk his</b>
<br><b>self to death. His ghost could be seen wondering our back yard at
night,</b>
<br><b>carrying a beer bottle in his hand.</b>
<br><b>We finally moved when I was 14. Now my uncle lives there.</b><b></b>

to go to</b>
<br><b>my granny's home that lived near by . But when they went home again
a</b>
<br><b>couple of days later the sounds were the same .Then she was pregnant
with</b>
<br><b>me and for example when my dad use to help her washing the floor
and he was</b>
<br><b>sure that the floor cloth was there he wouldn't find it and then
he used to</b>
<br><b>say"if you really want it you can have it"and go to the other room
he used</b>
<br><b>to find it. Then i was born and since I was the only child in the
family i</b>
<br><b>had no children to play with I&nbsp; used to play with the mirror
in the bedroom</b>
<br><b>.I knew i wasn't playing alone cause when I throw the ball the ball
would</b>
<br><b>came back to me .My parents&nbsp; got worried a lot and once they
asked me with</b>
<br><b>who I was playing and i told them with a man . His hair was long
and dark</b>
<br><b>,big black eyes with moustach and a bit of goaty he was dress in
royal red</b>
<br><b>like a cavalier and he had a necklace with a pandent the face of
Christ .So</b>
<br><b>we went to live with my grannys for a while becuase they were afraid,but</b>
<br><b>soon we had to return home cause I was ill and I wanted to go home
.As soon</b>
<br><b>as we retured home i started to feel better and i went to play .The</b>
<br><b>following months were raffy since dad lost his job and mum used
to find</b>
<br><b>money under the mat in the cuboard and some times even sweets and
milk</b>
<br><b>.Once I gave dad 3 numbers that this friend of mine had gave me
and he won</b>
<br><b>some money from the lotto. Mum and dad tried to have more children
when we</b>

and dad got</b>
<br><b>a new job and it was time to leave. A few days before my friend
wanted to</b>
<br><b>give me his chain and I said no cause my mum always told me not
to accept</b>
<br><b>things from other people so i was afraid altough I wished to .And
so we</b>
<br><b>left .people phoned us the next morning to ask us if we left a dog
or some</b>
<br><b>thing in the flat,cause they could not sleep with at night with
the sounds</b>
<br><b>of some one crying and foot steps coming in the flat .All I know
is that</b>

<br><b>she saw the angel Gabriel). . . "she was little more than a child
when the</b>
<br><b>angel came to her; she had not lost her child's creative acceptance
of the</b>
<br><b>realities moving on the other side of the everyday world."&nbsp;
L'Engle then</b>
<br><b>goes on to say, "The artist, if he is not to forget how to listen,
must</b>
<br><b>retain the vision which includes angels and dragons and unicorns,
and all</b>
<br><b>the creatures which our world would put in a box marked 'Children
Only'."</b>
<br><b>And so, as an artist, I suppose I have retained a belief in and
a vision of</b>
<br><b>that unknown realm.</b>
<br><b>In 1989, my husband and three young children (ages 3-6) moved into
a rental</b>
<br><b>house in Farmington, New Mexico, the town where we had lived since
1980.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>were in that house for 14 months, and during that time period, some
pretty</b>
<br><b>strange things happened.&nbsp; I never was able to discover the
history of the</b>
<br><b>house, but I did know that it was approximately 30 years old.&nbsp;
And we came</b>
<br><b>to know that a young girl had once lived. . . and perhaps died there.</b>
<br><b>Our six-year old daughter Rachel, had her own room - across the
hallway from</b>
<br><b>her two younger brothers.&nbsp; I began noticing shortly after moving
in, that I</b>
<br><b>would awaken in the middle of the night to a light down the hallway,
and it</b>
<br><b>was always coming from Rachel's room.&nbsp; Knowing that I had turned
off all the</b>
<br><b>lights before going to bed, at first I thought Rachel was turning
it on</b>
<br><b>herself, in an attempt to deal with the normal childhood fears of
a new</b>
<br><b>place.&nbsp; But soon I discovered that the light that was being
turned on, was</b>
<br><b>the light in the closet of Rachel's bedroom.&nbsp; The only way
to turn it on was</b>
<br><b>to pull the string attached to the ceiling bulb, and Rachel could
not reach</b>
<br><b>the string.&nbsp; Then -- for the first (and only) time in Rachel's
life -- she</b>
<br><b>began to talk "in her sleep."&nbsp; It was very playful chatter,
and always</b>
<br><b>friendly.&nbsp; I began listening at her door, and sometimes would
quietly go</b>
<br><b>into her room and sit on the floor by the door to listen to this
seemingly</b>
<br><b>one-sided conversation.&nbsp; When I finally became brave enough
to ask Rachel</b>
<br><b>one day WHO it was she was talking to at night, she responded very</b>
<br><b>matter-of-factly, "It's just Jilley, Mommy.&nbsp; The girl who lives
under my bed</b>
<br><b>and in my closet."&nbsp; I got chills when she said that.&nbsp;
Our family has never</b>
<br><b>known a "Jill", or a "Jilley", and my daughter was talking as if
this were</b>
<br><b>just a close friend of hers -- nothing more.&nbsp; Their nightly
conversations,</b>
<br><b>accompanied by the closet light, continued throughout the fourteen
months we</b>
<br><b>lived in the house. Sometimes it was clear that Rachel was asleep.&nbsp;
Other</b>
<br><b>times I would find her sitting up in bed -- eyes open -- engaged
in a very</b>
<br><b>lively game of some sort, laughing and having a lot of fun. . .
with no-one</b>
<br><b>visible around.</b>
<br><b>But Jilley did more than just play with our daughter.&nbsp; Our
living room T.V.</b>
<br><b>began to go on in the middle of the night sometimes. . . and would
even</b>
<br><b>change channels.&nbsp; I would have to unplug the T.V. to sleep
through the night</b>
<br><b>whenever my husband worked his week-long graveyard shift at the
Power Plant.</b>
<br><b>We had that T.V. for many years after moving away, but it never</b>
<br><b>"malfunctioned" like that anywhere but THAT house.</b>
<br><b>Jilley apparently did NOT like the fireplace.&nbsp; When the first
chilly autumn</b>
<br><b>night arrived and we started a fire, the tempered-glass panes on
the</b>
<br><b>fireplace doors shattered.&nbsp; We had them replaced, thinking
it was just a</b>
<br><b>fluke.&nbsp; But the first time we tried again to light a fire.
. . the glass</b>
<br><b>doors shattered again.&nbsp; We didn't use the fireplace anymore.</b>
<br><b>We had two cats at the time.&nbsp; One was a female who had had
a litter shortly</b>
<br><b>before we rented the house, and the other was one of her kittens.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>kitten's name was Jin-Jin, and unfortunately, we didn't think to
have him</b>
<br><b>"fixed" before he began to mature.&nbsp; Jin-Jin's favorite place
in the house</b>
<br><b>was our boys' bedroom.&nbsp; But to get there, he had to walk past
Rachel's room</b>
<br><b>in the hallway.&nbsp; He never ONCE entered her room, and would
always arch his</b>
<br><b>back when going past her room, every hair on his back standing straight
up.</b>
<br><b>He began to "spray" his awful male-cat hormone, at just a few months
of age,</b>
<br><b>and ONLY in the hallway on his way past Rachel's room.&nbsp; He
would hiss and</b>
<br><b>growl too -- staring into her bedroom -- and it was clear that he
felt his</b>
<br><b>"territory" was being threatened.&nbsp; We had no choice but to
give him to the</b>
<br><b>Animal Humane Society.</b>
<br><b>I had no fear of Jilley, but she could be a nuisance.&nbsp; Rachel
didn't fear</b>
<br><b>her either. . . but has never talked about her unseen playmate since
moving</b>
<br><b>away.</b>
<br><b>We wonder who lives in that house now. . . and if Jilley is still
amusing</b>
<br><b>herself with&nbsp; T.V.s and lights in the middle of the night.&nbsp;
Does she still</b>
<br><b>scare the family pets, and play with the children?&nbsp; And did
someone finally</b>
<br><b>replace the fireplace doors with something other than glass?</b>
<br><b>My prayer continues to be that one day, "Jilley" will find peace
from her</b>
<br><b>earthly sojourn, and go to the place she was meant to go. . .&nbsp;
back to the</b>
<br><b>God who created her, and the heavenly home he has made for her.]</b><b></b>

<p><b>My name is Matt . I moved into a new house in</b>
<br><b>December 2000.&nbsp; I moved from Pennsauken, New Jersey to Mt.
Laurel, New</b>
<br><b>Jersey.&nbsp; In January, when I was plying in my family room, I
set up my camera</b>
<br><b>on the chimney ledge.&nbsp; I just wanted to show off, because I
was wrestling</b>
<br><b>with my toys, and the camera was getting everything I was doing.
So when I</b>
<br><b>accidentally fell off the couch and onto the floor, the camera picked
that</b>
<br><b>up.&nbsp; And also a voice.&nbsp; A voice that I did not hear.&nbsp;
The voice sounded like</b>
<br><b>a very old man, and whatever it was said "hey!!"&nbsp; I didn't
hear it when I was</b>
<br><b>playing, but when I played that back on the camera, I heard the
voice.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>father said it was the T.V. ( the camera was near the T.V. ), but
I knew it</b>
<br><b>wasn't.&nbsp; You could barely hear the T.V., and the voice had
to be right next</b>
<br><b>to it.&nbsp; Up until today, I still don't know what that voice
was.</b>
<br><b>Little did I believe in ghosts and spirits before, but when I heard
that</b>

<p><b>Voices in the Bathroom</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lisa_threedouble@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Last summer I was home alone waiting for my dad to get</b>
<br><b>home from Bingo so I could go out walking around, It</b>
<br><b>was around 9 O'clock and he was going to be home in</b>
<br><b>like 20 minutes so I started to get ready, Well I was</b>
<br><b>in the bathroom washing my face and everything, I</b>
<br><b>heard my dad say my name. So I walk out of the</b>
<br><b>bathroom and answered him, but no one was there, so I</b>
<br><b>just shrugged it off and went back to doing what I was</b>
<br><b>doing, Well then I heard it again, I yelled out and</b>
<br><b>answered him from the bathroom, but no reply, so I</b>
<br><b>just ignored it, It happened a few more times, but I</b>
<br><b>brushed it off, Well My name was called again, this</b>
<br><b>time by another voice, By someones I have never heard</b>
<br><b>before, so I got out&nbsp; my curling iron incase someone</b>
<br><b>was in the house, and I searched it from top to</b>
<br><b>bottom, Nothing so I went and locked the doors and</b>
<br><b>went back to take care of my business, I even locked</b>
<br><b>the bathroom door incase someone was in the house.</b>
<br><b>Well My name was called again, and I ignored it, and</b>
<br><b>then it felt like someone was right behind me, like</b>
<br><b>right next to my ear,and in a really eary voice it</b>
<br><b>whispered my name, This voice was really scary I dont</b>
<br><b>know how else to discribe it except it was real raspy</b>
<br><b>low and eary, then all of a sudden I heard people</b>
<br><b>started screaming and it sounded like they were in the</b>
<br><b>bathroom, and I was too scared to run to the door I</b>
<br><b>felt like I couldnt move, so I sat in the tub crying</b>
<br><b>for I say 2 minutes, but it felt like two hours, Then</b>
<br><b>everything just stopped. and I just sat there for a</b>
<br><b>minute deciding on what I had experienced had been</b>
<br><b>real or if I was going crazy, I was just trying to</b>
<br><b>take everything in, Then the bathroom got this still</b>
<br><b>eary feeling, and I felt weight on me, and I couldnt</b>
<br><b>move again, It felt like you were waiting for someone</b>
<br><b>to pounce on your or something, and then real close to</b>
<br><b>my ear, my name was said again, in that same eary</b>
<br><b>voice, I jumped out of the bathroom as fast as I could</b>
<br><b>and ran out on the front pourch until my dad got home,</b>
<br><b>I tried to tell them what happened but no one believed</b>
<br><b>me then, they started to believe when they were alone</b>

<br><b>Strange but True</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ellul@another.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>my story is strange but very true, where do i begin?</b>
<br><b>well i guess it all started when i became pregnant with my son "
Connor" I had started to see changes in my flat,i.e things out of place
such as videos out of order on my shelf and ornaments that faced the wrong
way. At first i thought that maybe i had moved them and being pregnant
i had forgotten that i had, as all women know that pregnancy can make you
very forgetful. As time went on stranger things started to happen. I remember
that i was at home listening to some music, upon the window sill in the
lounge i had a solid glass vw beetle,it is a paperweight, as i looked up
the vw came off the windowsill and landed on a beanbag that was about six
feet away from the window, this really shook me up infact i had to call
my husband up at his works as i was so scared. He thought that i was going
mad. other things happened over the course of the next few months that
led me to seeing a clairvoiant. The clairvoiant picked up on a spirit that
was in my flat, the clairvoiant said that the spirit was that of a little
girl named Rosemary, Rosemary's purpose was to look after the spirit of
my son as he was an old spirit that needed guiding. The claivoiant said
that the spirit never meant any harm she just wanted us to know that she
was there. The claivoiant told me that Rosemary had hidden something precious
of mine behind the stereo in the lounge, when i got home that day i searched
around the stereo and to my amazment i found my mum's engagment ring that
had been lost for weeks,the strange thing was that the ring was placed
over one of the speaker wires which was plugged into the back of the stereo,so
how did it manage to actually come to be around a wire? I feel that the
claivoiant was right in as much as the spirit was there for my son "Connor"
as in the ninth month of pregnancy Connor died inside of me, i had to go
through the process of giving birth to my little darling. I hope that Connor
is somewhere where his spirit is free and he has an angel like Rosemary
to look after him .</b>

he put it in the</b>

<p><b>True Camp Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ZeroLimits2002@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Well all of you can believe me or not but about 4 years ago I was
at camp</b>
<br><b>with my class for 3 days. Just 3... Well it was going great we were
doing</b>
<br><b>wall climbing, obstacle courses, and the food turned out to be better
than</b>
<br><b>what we normally get at school! Man it was a great time.</b>
<br><b>It was the day before we had to go home and the teachers decided
we could go</b>
<br><b>on the row boat trip after days of beging even before we came. There
was a</b>
<br><b>huge lake near the camp, so big it had a large island in the middle
which a</b>
<br><b>bridge from camp shore would connect to a unknown buried man is
there but</b>
<br><b>thats another story all together. Anyhow the bridge had a large
gap under it</b>
<br><b>and that rowers would go under to circle the island to get back
to the boat</b>
<br><b>station. The station was a small shack with fishing rods, oars and
others</b>
<br><b>with boats stacked up on the side.</b>
<br><b>I was never a popular kid back then (I was 12) and the day of the
row trip I</b>
<br><b>was alone in a boat all by myself., it had just rained heavy that
night and</b>
<br><b>the sky was very grey, it was calm though was a pretty cold day.
As we got</b>
<br><b>into the water and the all rowed ahead of me even the teachers were
laughing</b>
<br><b>as I struggled. People flung water at me and pushed my boat with
their oars</b>
<br><b>and laughed and laughed... We all finally rowed on the opposite
side of the</b>
<br><b>island. The island blocked off my view and the rest of their view
of the</b>
<br><b>camp. I was busy crying and trying to catch up as the group rowed
off ahead.</b>
<br><b>I was alone behind the island trying to row and then the group faded
from my</b>
<br><b>view. I was not thinking of monsters in the water but killers in
the woods</b>
<br><b>(aka Jason vorhess) as the friday the 13 theme played in my head
and I cried</b>
<br><b>my eyes out I heard a loud thick PLUNK! Like a rock a big rock softly
slaming</b>
<br><b>into the water.</b>
<br><b>I turned and was completly scared. "****..." I said and I remember
cause that</b>
<br><b>was before I saw 4 ripples slide about 10 feet away from my boat.
The space</b>
<br><b>behind the island was pretty big but with the trees heavily growing
on the</b>
<br><b>island and on the opposite area not belonging to camp closing us
in (except</b>
<br><b>for a large gap blocked by a gate like dam) there was no way for
anything to</b>
<br><b>get in or out. I sat not rowing and sniffling, more curious now
than scared.</b>
<br><b>My boat glidded on its own (cause of the water) and I watched the
water</b>
<br><b>carefully. I floated to the middle of the lake almost and then I
heard it</b>
<br><b>"Kevin! Where---" I stopped listening when a large HUGE HUGE shadow
slide</b>
<br><b>from under my boat my and headed diagnoly and then turned from the
direction</b>
<br><b>I went. MY eyes widen and I was to scared to scream, since it was
leaving me</b>
<br><b>and going somewhere else I rowed fast trying to get back to camp,
I looked</b>
<br><b>left and saw MORE LAKE blocked off by a gate. The sight was scary
to me, all</b>
<br><b>this water and darkness. I looked back and saw a large rippled coming
at me.</b>
<br><b>I was terrified I didn't scream I just followe my instinct and rowed
for the</b>
<br><b>island. The rippled stopped beside me and a creature 40-50 feet
long slowly</b>
<br><b>rose out of the water. It's head was odd I can't describe much like
a snake</b>
<br><b>and horse scally with a like hair on the cheeks. Most of the body
was</b>
<br><b>submerged but I could see it from under the murky water.</b>
<br><b>I was hoping not to see a eye but it did open... It was hug and
yellowish it</b>
<br><b>looked at me and I muttered softly things I don't remember. It glided
gently</b>
<br><b>to the side of me and bumped the boat. So soft but I moved near
shore. It unk</b>
<br><b>and must have turned around cause in a instant reappeared in front
of me it</b>
<br><b>rose its head out and was extremely close. It look at me and barely
opened</b>
<br><b>its mouth and made a hissing noise but it was loud and like a burp
hiss I</b>
<br><b>know its funny but it was weird to me. It sunk down again, I didn't
kno how</b>
<br><b>deep the water was but it was extremely deep... I titled the boat
and dove</b>
<br><b>under on purpose but I didn't mean to turn the boat over. I sunk
almost to</b>
<br><b>the bottom but I rose just as quick, I doggie paddled for my life,
I can't</b>
<br><b>swim, I sunk several times but I finally reached shore and grabbed
small</b>
<br><b>trees the ground anything to climb up. I been on the island before
and I ran</b>
<br><b>but feel heavy right on the edge. I remember still hearing the hiss
noie but</b>
<br><b>not looking back. I ran threw the trees and headed for the bridge
to the</b>
<br><b>camp. I saw the bridge and looked across and saw my class and teachers.
They</b>
<br><b>were about to go look for me the teachers franctically looking towards
the</b>
<br><b>way I was suppose to come back from. I ran across the bridge muddy
and wet.</b>
<br><b>My class surprised and I was too to see them concerned. my teacher
asked</b>
<br><b>"What happpened did you fall out where?" I stuttered "I" and collasped
to the</b>
<br><b>ground and was breathing heavy. They walked me back to the camp
and I</b>
<br><b>showered and dressed and laid on the top bunk wrapped in covers.
I was so</b>
<br><b>scared yet excited about what I had been threw but I knew no one
would</b>
<br><b>believe me. Then one of the people from the camp came in and went
beside my</b>
<br><b>bed. After he asked if I was okay and I told him I was and he told
me then</b>
<br><b>the boat was totalled. I was shocked but then he pulled somehing
out his</b>
<br><b>pocket and showed it to me. You saw it didn't you he asked... I
was shocked</b>
<br><b>Yeah I said. He showed me a picture. The picture of the beast I
saw. H told</b>
<br><b>me he was scared by it too and many of the people (mostly campers
who stray</b>
<br><b>and the consoulers) have seen it but they are all lairs and say
that it was a</b>
<br><b>shark. HE said me and he are the only ones that have truly seen
the thing.</b>
<br><b>And I will never forget it and I wake up at night after a dream
of being</b>
<br><b>eaten or seeing the beast again. I just wanna know where it came
from...-</b><b></b>

<br><b>A Couple of Spooks</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: alyssa500@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I only have a couple of stories,&nbsp; the first i will tell you
occured at a</b>
<br><b>friends house. I was spending the night with my friend Liz. Me,
her, and her</b>
<br><b>brother were all asleep in their family room (we had fallen asleep
after</b>
<br><b>watching a movie, we were maybe 9, and Kevin, her brother was 8)
i was the</b>
<br><b>only one awake when i heard their doorknob start rattling, this
continued</b>
<br><b>for a couple of minutes and stopped, i thought it was her dad, because
he</b>
<br><b>comes home very late at night most nights, so i dismissed the incident,
but</b>
<br><b>when i thought about it later, now that i am 13, i realize that
her dad</b>
<br><b>would have either gotten his key out, knocked, gone to the back
door, or the</b>
<br><b>garage door,i didn't fall asleep for about 15 minutes after that,
it's a</b>
<br><b>very small house, so i could have seen all three entrances from
where i was</b>
<br><b>laying. (What can i say, i was 8, i know you're thinking most 8
year olds</b>
<br><b>would have been freaking out, but what can i say? i was a stupid
8 year old)</b>
<br><b>My second story also occured at Liz's house only a few monthes ago,&nbsp;
we were</b>
<br><b>playing with my ouija board that i had brought over, we both got
very weird</b>
<br><b>sensations when using the board it seemed that the spirit was trying
to</b>
<br><b>communicate through me, so i tried to talk to her, she seemed like
a very</b>
<br><b>weak spirit, and it was taking a lot of her energy to talk to us.
First, i</b>
<br><b>closed my eyes and concentrated on contacting a spirit, and a woman
flashed</b>
<br><b>into my mind, in a garden, the next second, rose petals flashed
into my</b>
<br><b>head, and the name hannah, we were both freaking out, because this
was the</b>
<br><b>first time either of us had gotten the board to work, i also experienced
a</b>
<br><b>great sadness, and everytime i placed my hands on the planchtte
(the message</b>
<br><b>indicater) the tips of my fingers got icy cold, but when i raised
my hands</b>
<br><b>off the planchette, they returned to normal, i also started having
trouble</b>
<br><b>breathing, and my side started hurting really bad everytime we put
out hands</b>
<br><b>on the board, so we put the board away for the night. the experiences
at my</b>
<br><b>house are really no big deal, nothing like what happened at Liz's
house, my</b>
<br><b>grandfather died in our house, and it's basically just my doors
that are</b>
<br><b>weird, once i came home from school, and my moms door sounded like
it opened</b>
<br><b>really hard and hit the wall behind it, although i was home alone,
my two</b>
<br><b>dogs were asleep on the floor in the same room as me, and my cat&nbsp;
didn't</b>
<br><b>have NEAR&nbsp; enough force to make a door do that. This happened
about 3 times,</b>
<br><b>and stopped, so i called my friend, liz, who wont think im crazy
when i tell</b>
<br><b>her about my paranormal experiences, as soon as i started tellling
her what</b>
<br><b>was happening, it started again, this was enough to make me crap
my pants,</b>
<br><b>and i was freaking out at this point, but i decided to just forget
it, my</b>
<br><b>last experience also included one of my doors, i was closing the
door, and</b>
<br><b>about three-four inches to being closed, it FLEW out of my hand,
and slammed</b>
<br><b>itself, like someone on the other side of the door was pulling it
away from</b>
<br><b>my, to close it on their side, but when i checked there was no one
there. My</b>
<br><b>sister has also had experiences in our den, she told me her story
when i was</b>
<br><b>about 11 years old (my grandfather died in the den, he didn't leave
that</b>
<br><b>room the last 3 monthes of his life, and he had been dead about
2-3 years</b>
<br><b>then) we have a big wooden beam in the middle of the den, and every
once in</b>
<br><b>a while my sister will see something out of the corner of her eye
"looking"</b>
<br><b>at her from behind the beam,but when she looks, the "thing", will
be gone</b>
<br><b>she has always thought that it's a little boy with blonde hair,
in overalls,</b>
<br><b>at about four years old, her&nbsp; then boyfriend, now ex-boyfriend,
told her he</b>
<br><b>had a really weird dream he had last night the first time he saw
our house,</b>
<br><b>(he hadn't ever seen our house, and she hadn't said anything about
a beam in</b>
<br><b>our house before he told her this story, and there is NO way that
he could</b>
<br><b>have known this, he didn't know any of her friends, because they
went to</b>
<br><b>different schools) he told her that he had a dream about something
big and</b>
<br><b>brown, and a little boy with BLONDE hair, in blue OVERALLS was peeking</b>
<br><b>around it, and it looked exactly like the beam in our den. Sorry
my story is</b>
<br><b>so long, if anyone has anything to say about these stories, e-mail
me!</b><b></b>

<br><b>Haunted In Santee, CA</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: afox@arrowheadgrp.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have always thought that ghosts exist.&nbsp; I never had any proof
to speak of</b>
<br><b>(until recently), it was just something I believed.&nbsp; I moved
to Santee,</b>
<br><b>California about 8 months ago and have since obtained what I believe
to be</b>
<br><b>proof of ghosts.</b>
<br><b>I share a small, one bedroom apartment with my husband in the small
town of</b>
<br><b>Santee.&nbsp; Ever since first arriving in the apartment I have
had the feeling</b>
<br><b>of never really being alone.&nbsp; My husband is in the NAVY and
is often gone</b>
<br><b>for 3 or 4 days at a time and I am left "alone" in the apartment.&nbsp;
I always</b>
<br><b>feel a presence though---something watching me.</b>
<br><b>The first thing that happened that got the attention of both&nbsp;
(my husband</b>
<br><b>and myself) of us was the day the light in the kitchen turned off
by itself.</b>
<br><b>We were both standing in the kitchen, preparing dinner, when the
light over</b>
<br><b>head just went out.&nbsp; We at first thought the bulb had burned
out, but upon</b>
<br><b>investigation found that the switch had been flipped.&nbsp; We were
the only ones</b>
<br><b>in the house and were facing each other--away from the switch--when
this</b>
<br><b>occurred.&nbsp; Can you say, goose bumps?!</b>
<br><b>The next thing that happened, which convinced both of us that we
were not</b>
<br><b>alone in the house, is the morning we awoke late for work to find
the entire</b>
<br><b>apartment in disarray.&nbsp; First it was odd that we woke up late.&nbsp;
We always</b>
<br><b>set the alarm clock for 4:30 and are both paranoid about being late
so we</b>
<br><b>both check it before going to bed to make sure it's set right.&nbsp;
When we woke</b>
<br><b>up this particular morning, the alarm clock had been turned off
and was set</b>
<br><b>for 6 in the morning.&nbsp; When we left our bedroom (the door was
closed,</b>
<br><b>something neither of us ever does) to start hastily getting ready
for work,</b>
<br><b>we were alarmed by what we found.</b>
<br><b>I had been doing laundry when we went to bed.&nbsp; When we awoke,
the dryer door</b>
<br><b>was open, with clothes strewn through out the hallway and the washer
lid was</b>
<br><b>open, revealing water and laundry sitting in it---it was opened
before the</b>
<br><b>spin cycle obviously.&nbsp; The TV in the living room was on---muted
however--</b>
<br><b>along with the radio, VCR and cable box. All the clocks had different
times</b>
<br><b>on them---none of them correct--- and every light in the place was
on.&nbsp;&nbsp; All</b>
<br><b>windows and doors were closed and locked, so no living person was
in the</b>
<br><b>apartment.&nbsp; The other thing is, how did we sleep through all
this??</b>
<br><b>The most recent thing has been this last week and only affects me.&nbsp;
Every</b>
<br><b>night, for the last 7 nights, I have awoken at exactly 3:32AM, startled
and</b>
<br><b>frightened.&nbsp; Every night I get the sensation that I'm being
watched, but I</b>
<br><b>can't find anyone in the apartment and turning on all the lights
does not</b>
<br><b>make the feeling diminish.&nbsp; The "episode" generally lasts until
4:45 or so</b>
<br><b>when the feeling of alarm just goes away and I can go back to sleep.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>first five days this occurred I was home alone and figured I was
just not</b>
<br><b>sleeping well with out my husband.&nbsp; The last two nights he
has been home and</b>
<br><b>sound asleep through it all.&nbsp; Today he leaves again and I'm
curious to see</b>
<br><b>if it continues.</b>
<br><b>I don't know for sure if it's the spirit in my apartment that's
causing my</b>
<br><b>sleeping problem or something else??&nbsp; Other than this last
week, there has</b>
<br><b>never been a steady stream of things going on.&nbsp; The light switch
thing was</b>
<br><b>back in December of 2000 and the crazy morning was in February.&nbsp;
Any insight</b>
<br><b>from anyone would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; I'm sick of being
awake every</b>
<br><b>night--I'm getting tired!</b>
