I just wanted to reiterate words of caution to new investigators and
old alike about methods used to contact spirits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Remember that there are many methods that have been used to contact the
spirits over the years that include Ouija bards, s&eacute;ances,
pendulums, EVP and ITC, EMF meters, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; While many of
these methods can be used successfully to make contact with spirits,
they can also be dangerous to many investigators.&nbsp;&nbsp; People
who are aware of how to properly prepare and protect themselves can use
some of these methods while reducing the risks but there are many
people who feel they do know everything they need to or don&#8217;t see any
danger are the ones that need to heed this reminder.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When you reach out to any spirits, there is always the danger that
there may be other spirits, human or non-human, that may also be within
&#8220;earshot&#8221; and decide to answer. You have no way of knowing what the
nature or personality of the spirits may be.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without
the using the proper methods and using protection it is as if you are
walking blindfolded into a room full of strangers and calling out for
one to answer.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may not like the response you get in
this situation and it is the same when trying to contact
spirits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, being confrontational and
mean-spirited when trying to make contact can also attract the wrong
kind of spirit to you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Steer clear of methods of contacted
spirits that you have no training in and exercise some common sense
when addressing spirits.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;ve seen people ask ghosts to
give me a sign that you are here and I&#8217;ve seen others yell at a spirit
and challenge them to prove they are present.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have one
comment to say in these cases, be careful what you ask
for.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes the response you get is not exactly
what you wanted and often times you get to go home after the
investigation and the people who are there everyday have to deal with
the repercussions of anything you may have upset or
angered.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that you may have seen some of these
things done on a variety of TV shows but keep in mind that most of
these people are trained in this field and have a lot of experience so
they understand the upside and downside of what they are doing and many
know how to guard themselves the best you can.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That part of the process usually doesn&#8217;t make it to the show once it is
aired.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To sum it all up, be careful and
cautious when dealing with the dead, just as you would when dealing
with the living.<br>
