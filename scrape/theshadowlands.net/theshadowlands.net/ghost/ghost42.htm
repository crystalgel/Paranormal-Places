</H3><P><B>by MICHELLE_LINCKS@yahoo.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I'm glad to see I'm not alone.  I, too, have stories of beloved pets</B>
<P><B>coming back to say their last good-byes.  I only had two experiences</B>
<P><B>with this, though.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I can't recall, exactly, which one came first, so I'll tell you in
as</B>
<P><B>much detail as I can.  Both experiences happened while I was still</B>
<P><B>living in my grandparents' house.  And I was about 13, going on 14,
when</B>
<P><B>they happened.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We had an adorable cocker spaniel/poodle mix named Brandy.  She was
a</B>
<P><B>tiny, black furball full of love.  Unfortunately, Brandy came down
with</B>
<P><B>epilepsy.  Every time she got excited, she would end up going into
a</B>
<P><B>literal fit.  It took a lot of love, hugs, and soft words to help her</B>
<P><B>out of her fits.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One day, I had to go into the hospital for emotional problems.  I
stayed</B>
<P><B>there for three weeks.  My last day there was both a happy and sad
one.</B>
<P><B>I was leaving behind new friends, but I was going to see my old ones</B>
<P><B>again.  When I got home, I went upstairs to my room.  On my way up,
I</B>
<P><B>saw Brandy sitting on the landing, waiting for me.  I bent down to
pet</B>
<P><B>and kiss her on her little head.  The last thing I remember telling
her</B>
<P><B>was "I love you".  Then I walked up the rest of the steps to go to
my</B>
<P><B>room.</B>
<P>
<P><B>A couple hours later, my best friend, Angie, called me.  She told me
she</B>
<P><B>was sorry to hear about my dog.  I asked her what dog.  She answered,</B>
<P><B>"Brandy."  I said that Brandy was fine, and that I had just seen her
not</B>
<P><B>too long ago.  She thought I was nuts.  Then she told what had
happened.</B>
<P><B>A week before I was to get out of the hospital, my mom took Brandy
to</B>
<P><B>the vet after the most severe fit she had ever had.  That's when my
mom</B>
<P><B>made the difficult decision to have Brandy put to sleep.  I wasn't
to</B>
<P><B>know about it until I got home, otherwise, the treatment at the
hospital</B>
<P><B>would have been for nothing.  After I got off the phone, I searched
the</B>
<P><B>house everywhere looking for my beloved cockapoo.  As it would seem,
she</B>
<P><B>was nowhere to be found.  I confronted my mom about it, and she</B>
<P><B>confirmed my fears.  That night, I went to bed with a heavy heart.</B>
<P>
<P><B>But, that wasn't quite the end of Brandy.  She came to me in my dream
a</B>
<P><B>few days later.  In the dream, she was a puppy again.  She was
frisky,</B>
<P><B>playful, and happy.  I started crying in my dream, telling her I
loved</B>
<P><B>her, as I hugged her fiercely to me.  Then, the dream ended, and I
woke</B>
<P><B>up crying.  Brandy came to tell me she was alright, that she was
happy,</B>
<P><B>and good-bye.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My second story has to do with my full-bred German shepard named Yoko.
</B>
<P><B>Yoko was like a mother, friend, and guardian angel to me and my
younger</B>
<P><B>sister.  She would never let us out of her sight.  Everyone loved her</B>
<P><B>like she was an actual blood relative.  There even came a time when
Yoko</B>
<P><B>needed our love and attention in order to survive.  One summer, on
July</B>
<P><B>4, Yoko had escaped from our backyard, to get away from the
firecrackers</B>
<P><B>that everyone was setting off in our neighborhood.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We were out of town that weekend, and when we came home, our beloved
dog</B>
<P><B>was missing.  My uncle Dennis had been house sitting at the time, and
he</B>
<P><B>told us what happened.  Yoko was missing for about two or three days,</B>
<P><B>until someone called to tell us she had been hit by a car.  She had
been</B>
<P><B>taken to the vet immediately after that to have a broken hip mended.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We spent the rest of the summer pampering our poor girl.  She
couldn't</B>
<P><B>get up to go do her duty outside, so any messes she made had to be</B>
<P><B>cleaned as soon as possible.  We had fed her, laid by her, we did</B>
<P><B>everything we could to make her comfortable.  And, in the end, it
paid</B>
<P><B>off.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Unfortunately, Yoko's death was an early one.  She was only 13, but</B>
<P><B>still had a lot of life in her.  What did her in, ironically, was not</B>
<P><B>old age, but poison.  We normally left her in our backyard for the</B>
<P><B>night.  But one night, she came into the basement via a small window</B>
<P><B>under the back porch.  Fortunately, the dryer was directly beneath
this</B>
<P><B>window.  She jumped down, and climbed the basement stairs.  She
somehow</B>
<P><B>got her paw up to turn the door knob and push the door open.  After</B>
<P><B>that, she came up to my mother's room and started to scratch at the</B>
<P><B>door.  My mom woke up to this, opened the door, and found a sick Yoko.
</B>
<P><B>She was foaming at the mouth at this time.  My mom went downstairs
with</B>
<P><B>her to keep her company and give her comfort.  I guess they both knew</B>
<P><B>there was no hope this time.  Around 8 o'clock the next morning, Yoko</B>
<P><B>died in my mom's arms.  It was a very hard time for the whole family.
</B>
<P><B>We all loved her so much.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Then, one night, when I was 13 years old, I was upstairs all alone.
</B>
<P><B>Everyone was downstairs doing one thing or another.  Our other dogs
were</B>
<P><B>even downstairs.  I was in my mom's room, with the door closed,
watching</B>
<P><B>TV.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>The room was situated where the bed was facing the door and a crib.
 The</B>
<P><B>floorboards are also very old, and so creak in certain spots, like
the</B>
<P><B>foot and right side of the bed.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Anyway, as I said, I was all alone, watching TV.  All of a sudden,
the</B>
<P><B>floor started creaking at the foot of the bed.  I tried to listen for</B>
<P><B>any toenails scratching the floor, and heard none.  I wasn't really</B>
<P><B>scared, just startled.  I then started calling our other dogs' names
to</B>
<P><B>see if it was one of them.  I got nothing back, but a creak in the
floor</B>
<P><B>on the right side this time.  I crawled over to that side of the bed
to</B>
<P><B>see what it was, but there was nothing there.  Then I remembered,
those</B>
<P><B>were the only two spots Yoko would sleep in the room.  I felt quite
a</B>
<P><B>bit better about her now after this experience.  I knew she was okay.</B>

<H3><A NAME=strange>My Strange Experiences</A>
</H3><P><B>by cykobrat@erols.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I read your story I had chills down my spine.  I feel like I
have</B>
<P><B>found someone who may relate with what has happened to me a few times.
</B>
<P><B>I am going to tell you about three incedents, two are related.</B>
<P>
<P><B>First, in the mid to late eighties, I was driving in my car with a</B>
<P><B>friend in West Carrollton, OH.  It was around 9 or 10pm and we were</B>
<P><B>bored so just driving aimlessly.  We were in a residental area not
too</B>
<P><B>far from farm land and nearing a cross road.  I tell you this because
it</B>
<P><B>may be pertinant.  All of a sudden the atmosphere in the car changes,
it</B>
<P><B>feels thick and our hearing changes, sort of muffled.  I looked at
my</B>
<P><B>friend to see if he was noticing anything and his eyes were opened
wide</B>
<P><B>and he looked pale, scared.  I looked ahead and under a street lamp
I</B>
<P><B>saw a small black figure.  It appeared to be about 4ft tall and
wearing</B>
<P><B>a full length cloak, and it was waddling in a way.  I noticed that
as it</B>
<P><B>walked under the lamp there were no shadows, no highlights, no low</B>
<P><B>lights.  Its like it absorbed the light as it walked under it.  I
again</B>
<P><B>looked at my friend and asked if he saw it.  His mouth was open and
all</B>
<P><B>he could do was shake his head.  I asked him what I should do.  Should
I</B>
<P><B>slow down, speed up, turn around?  I really felt odd at that time.
 I</B>
<P><B>watched the figure cross the street diagonally in front of me and
then</B>
<P><B>turn the head of the cloak towards us.  It seemed to startle, and
walk</B>
<P><B>faster.  I got the feeling that it realized that we saw it and we
were</B>
<P><B>not supposed to.  It crossed between two cars and through a fence,
not a</B>
<P><B>gate, the actual fence and disappeared.  I had taken my foot off of
the</B>
<P><B>gas pedal because I had run out of time to turn around, but the car</B>
<P><B>wasn't really slowing down as much as I thought it should.  When we</B>
<P><B>passed the area where he had disappeared the atmosphere change back
to</B>
<P><B>normal and our hearing came back.  I stomped on the gas and we were
out</B>
<P><B>of there.  The next day we went back to the same area in the daylight
to</B>
<P><B>look for the gate he must have walked through and there was no gate
at</B>
<P><B>that area.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next two incidents are somewhat related.  I was in an apt in</B>
<P><B>Portsmouth, VA.  I was asleep and I heard a voice in my head that
there</B>
<P><B>was someone in my room watching me and I needed to wake up.  The
voice</B>
<P><B>was urgent and I felt like I was swimming aginst a current trying to</B>
<P><B>wake up.  When I was able to open my eyes the was the form of a
woman,</B>
<P><B>around 5-5 or so, and she was all dressed in white, the style of that</B>
<P><B>day.  She had very light blond hair and pale skin and was wearing
dark</B>
<P><B>sunglasses.  She was standing very close to my face just looking at
me I</B>
<P><B>blinked my eyes several times to see if I was still dreaming.  She
was</B>
<P><B>still there.  I didn't have a bad or a good feeling about her, she
was</B>
<P><B>just there.  She eventually moved backwards into the wall and</B>
<P><B>disappeared.  About six months later I heard the same urgent voice
in my</B>
<P><B>head, same swimming sensation and when I woke up there was a figure
in</B>
<P><B>white again, but this time holding up something that looked like a</B>
<P><B>window screen.  I blinked my eyes again like the first time.  It was
a</B>
<P><B>male figure this time, same blond hair, in a similar cut, short and</B>
<P><B>curly. He lowered the screen slowly and had a smile on his face like</B>
<P><B>some people do when they get caught at something.  He also moved</B>
<P><B>backward into the wall and disappeared.  I have not experienced them
any</B>
<P><B>more since that time, but I did move out shortly after the second</B>
<P><B>incident.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I hope you find these interesting.  If you have any clues for me to</B>
<P><B>figure this out I would appreciate it. </B>

<H3><A NAME=with>With,Or Without My Nightlight</A>
</H3><P><B>by SCULLYD545@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Well,the first time I had a ghost experience was when I was 10 and
in 4 rth grade,that was last year.I have a nightlight(ssshh,don't tell
anyone!!)but that night my nightlight wasn't working,I really like my night
light,its like protection to me.So that night it wasn't working and I had
to sleep without it wich I truly did not want to do but I had to..I share
a room with my sister but she was sound asleep when this happened and if
I had woken her up she would've killed me..Anyways as I lay in bed I looked
over and I saw this black figure standing near my bed,it had no face just
a body no details just a black body..It was in the shape of about a 6 foot
man,my mom said it was probably Dad but I would've atleast seen the color
of his shirt and pants even if I didn't have my nightlight on,and plus he
doesn't wear all-black he never really wearsone solid color..But then another
night when I didn't have my nightlight on again I saw it  again,only in a
different place..It was same looking,same standing position,only in a different
spot of the room..Then one night of this year I had my nightlight on and
I had closed my eyes and kinda fell asleep then I woke up I don't know why
and for 10 seconds I saw this women in a ragged white night gown or dress
I truely don't know what it was,and it was hafly-floating and had her arms
out to me..And I must not forget these 2!!My mom had told me that her mom
used to go "Tsssk,Tsssk"and it used to annoy her alot.Anyways I was in bed
and I heard it "tttttssskkkk,ttttssskkk",I really started cracking up and
I ran downstairs and slept with my mom until my sister got home.And one more,one
night I was istting there reading when my sisters covers started going up,and
down like someone was sleeping in there,I shuttered and kept on reading..Nothing
has really happenedsince the women in the white dress,but I'll let everyone
know if anything else does happen(i also experienced hearing voices once)</B>

<H3><A NAME=base>Military Base in Germany</A>
</H3><P><B>by grant@henge.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was stationed with the First Armor Division.  My company was the
501st</B>
<P><B>AG, it was in the German town of Ansbach.  The barracks we lived in
were</B>
<P><B>very old, I had a "scratching in the bricks outside my window that
dated</B>
<P><B>to 1883.  I lived on the third floor, and my office was in the</B>
<P><B>basement.  I was told that they once were stables, this I believed</B>
<P><B>because you could see the hinges still imbedded in the rock.  My job
was</B>
<P><B>to process the unclassified military correspondence, this included
the</B>
<P><B>faxes that came in.  I would go to work at 4:00A.M.  I would pick up
the</B>
<P><B>messages at the message center and process them for delivery.  On one</B>
<P><B>night, there was a "party" going on up stairs, and I was invited, but
I</B>
<P><B>had to go to work at 4:00, so I didn't go.  The "inside" doors to the</B>
<P><B>basement were two metal doors that are usually locked with a chain.
 I</B>
<P><B>don't usually lock it when I am working, but if there is a party
going</B>
<P><B>on sometimes it is wise, to keep from being disturbed.  Well, I am</B>
<P><B>sitting there working through the pile of messages and I suddenly
hear</B>
<P><B>the door open, that is, I heard the subtle sound of the hinges
squeak.</B>
<P><B>I figured that some one is coming down to bother me since I was the</B>
<P><B>"working stiff" tonight.  Many people will say they can "feel" when
some</B>
<P><B>one is coming up on them even though they can not hear them, and this</B>
<P><B>was the case.  I stop working and ws looking at the door, so when
they</B>
<P><B>got up to the door I was prepared for them to jump around the corner
and</B>
<P><B>try to scare me.  I waited and waited but no one came around the</B>
<P><B>corner.  So I got up to see what was going on there, I looked around
the</B>
<P><B>corner and saw that I had locked the door, that is the padlocked
chain</B>
<P><B>was on my side and no one could get in without me unlocking the door.</B>
<P><B>For a second there, I thought I could smell hey, but I am not totally</B>
<P><B>sure, but lets say, when everyone came in to work that morning they</B>
<P><B>could tell I was visibly shaken.</B>

<H3><A NAME=my>My Mother and Uncle's Story</A>
</H3><P><B>by Delirium8m@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Ok now this isn't my story though I went to the haunted house in question
I did not have as strong an experience as my mother and uncle. These are
their stories.</B>
<P><B>                  About five years ago my Uncle Pat was friends with
a young couple who he still knows today. The lady of the house, Rocsan, lived
with a well-to-do doctor ( her husband at the time ) in a very large 3 story
victoren house in Greene. This house was inhabbited by a rather troublesome
ghost. Many members of my family have had incounters with this specter that
have sometimes been less then friendly. The ghost, which my uncle named Clide,
would move funature from room to room on a regular bases.It would mostly
move the dinning room furnature from  the from the dinning room to the kichen.
Foot steps were heard  rather often but probably one of Clide's most prominent
sighs of being around were swarms of flies. In the dead of winter swarms
of flies and cold spots in an other wise warm house would appeare. in my
mothers experince in the bathroom she saw the flies and felt its pesence
( she ran screaming down the hall until she got back to the bedroom where
she beged my father to look in the bathroom).The cloud of flies that almost
intirly blacked out the bathroom light. By the time my father reached the
bathroom l(ess then a minute later) where a cloud of flies had once covered
the bathroom light only a few dead flies remained. But Clide was more then
just a swarm of flies it would open locked windows and it even opened the
fire place. In my experience ( if you can call it that ) I had gone into
the wood shed to get some well wood for Rocsane. And I can't explane it (at
the time I knew nothing of the ghost ) I felt a presence like something was
watching me and I remember rushing out, and feeling rather frightend. Also
one of my uncles friends reported seeing some one open the curtens and look
outside from the attic, but no one was inside the house. After some investigation
my uncle uncovered that there had been a murder in the house. The victum?
A young women who was murdered in the kichen and then her body was draged
into the woodshed.</B>

<H3><A NAME=war>The Civil War House</A>
</H3><P><B>by Heathe5447@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>About 10 years ago I had been seeing a guy who stayed with my cousin
in his Grandma's home... The home itself is very old and it was built at
the time of the civil war.  There are rummored to be tunnels all over the
property that were confirmed by his grandfather before his death. The tunnels
as we were told were used for the underground rail road .... But My cousins
granddad had filled most of them cause he was afraid that the kids ( and
we would have! ) tried to go into them!</B>
<P>
<P><B>Anyway as I said before the house is and was in very bad shape!!!!</B>
<P>
<P><B>I did not like it over there it seemed to have a "feeling" to it! 
Not happy I would always feel not one but several spirts in the house!  </B>
<P>
<P><B>One day I had gone to get my (then) boyfriend, I made sure to call
ahead of time so that they would be ready when I got there!</B>
<P><B>As my luck would have it they were not ready! Now in the upstairs of
the this massive home is a door that leads to the outside and then to some
steps, the door has a sheer curtin on it.  Being the impatiant woman that
I was I honked the horn!  Now my boyfriends room was by the door ( the door
leading to the outside was 5-6feet from his room) I noticed a shadowed  figure
standing on the inside of the door; thinking it was my boyfriend ( my friend
saw this too) I honked agian! Then the firgure seemed to kinda pull the curtin
off to the side as if too look out at that VERY MOMENT MY BOYFRIEND AND ALL
THE OCCUPANTS OF THE HOUSE CAME OUT THE FRONT DOOR!!!</B>
<P><B>Thinking that maybe someone else was inside I asked who was upstairs
My cousins reply was No body we just came out!</B>
<P><B>My friend and I both looked at each other and got the hell out of there
!</B>
<P><B>Later I found out from his grandma that the house had a history, Once
in the upstairs room thats no longer used, she saw the aperition of an old
balck woman cleaning somthing unkowen she was dressed in rags turn of the
century rags.... The grandmother just looked at her and said that the war
was over, the figure just faded!</B>
<P><B>Unkowen spectors would walk in and out doors!</B>
<P><B>The house still stands, And Im sure it was grand in its day but now
its almost in ruin although to my knowledge people ( my cousins gran) still
lives there.....</B>

<H3><A NAME=home>Nursing Home Ghost</A>
</H3><P><B>by Pollerpan@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I work in a nursing home in a small town in northwest Ohio, which shall
remain nameless (also, I am just learning how to use a computer so please
forgive any errors !).I am a night shift nurses aide, we work from 5:30 pm
until 6 am, so we see it all.We (the aides and some of the nurses) are a
pretty close knit bunch, so whatever spooky stuff I have heard from them
I know is the truth. These instances pale in comparison to the stuff I've
read on this website, but I feel compelled to share it anyway.My first experience
occured a few weeks after I started working nights .I happened to be the
only person sitting at the nurses station,reading. For some reason I happened
to look up and see someone standing in the hallway in front of one of the
ladies' rooms.I thought it odd, since I had never seen the occupant of that
room ever stand up .On second look,it was too tall to be a woman but I couldn't
make out any features, there are only a few lights in the hall, so I got
up to see which resident had gotten out of bed .When I did there was no one
there.That freaked me out.My second experience scared me more because it
happened in broad daylight. Our shift had just started and as I was walking
down the hall,I saw this white THING go running accross the hall from one
room to the other. That scared me very badly,I don't think I went anywhere
alone the rest of that night.Some of the aides have heard someone call their
name when there is no one around.Also there is a ghost that plays the piano
in the dining room at night.I have never seen him though, and hope I never
do.The creepiest thing is that before one of the residents die, one of the
other residents will report seeing a "man in black" or a little boy wandering
around.One of the other aides I work with,Janet(who also has a ghost in her
house, but thats another story),told me when she worked day shift,one of
the residents had just died and she was packing up the ladies' things and
one of the nurses was in there too, and a vase of flowers on the dresser,
(and I quote Janet here)"lifted off the dresser by itself moved about three
feet in the air then fell to the floor and shattered everywhere ".I would've
soiled myself,but Janet's a tough cookie, so I give her credit for that.Also
there is a ghost nicknamed  "Shadowman" who is probably who I saw the first
time,and countless other stories that I've heard secondhand so I won't repeat
them because I'm not sure if they're true.I know my stories aren't as scary
as some of the others I've read here,but they're scary enough for me! I also
have another story involving me as ababy, but I will save that for another
day.Anyone with similar experiences, plerase e-mail me at
Pollerpan@aol.com.Thanks!</B>

things</B>
<P><B>that could not,  and still can not be explained.  Here are some examples
of</B>
<P><B>the things that we have experienced there.  Keep in mind, this Taco
Bell is</B>
<P><B>fairly new, 6 years old to be exact, and it was built over a empty
lot.</B>
<P><B>First thing,m it started out that we would here a small puppy barking
in</B>
<P><B>the back of the store, when there was no one, or nothing back there
at all,</B>
<P><B>except our dry food storage.  We also noticed that the barking would
not</B>
<P><B>stay to one particular area, it would move around the store, depending
on</B>
<P><B>wher you were, and the volume of the bark would vary as well.   A couple
of</B>
<P><B>times, a co-worker of mine and I even ran out of the store, without</B>
<P><B>finishing our duties, due to the noises.  Another noise was that of
a</B>
<P><B>little girl, talking very low, and mumbiling.  This happened to my</B>
<P><B>co-worker, as he went into the bathroom.  He heard the voice of a
little</B>
<P><B>gorl say something to him, he then ran out of the bathroom, scared
to</B>
<P><B>death.  At the times of these noses, the store was closed, and all</B>
<P><B>entrances and exits were fully secure.  The store is also very small,
so</B>
<P><B>there is no way for a person to "Hide", and try to fool us.  Another</B>
<P><B>problem that soon developed after the noises became more prominant,
was</B>
<P><B>that of objects being knocked off shelves, and what not.  Dishes would
be</B>
<P><B>knocked off the racks for instance.  One of the biggest peices of
evidence</B>
<P><B>of all the disruption was pictures that we would try to take in the
store.</B>
<P><B>We would have our "Employee of the Month" picture that we wouyld try
to</B>
<P><B>take, and the picture would turn out blurry, with green stuff all
around</B>
<P><B>the person, and the rest of the picture.  If we took the picture
outside</B>
<P><B>though, they would turn out fine.</B>
<P>
<P><B>If you have any more questions.  Feel free to write me back.  Thanx
for the</B>
<P><B>web page, I think it is very informative, and helps a lot of people</B>
<P><B>understand things they would other wise not beleive.</B>

<H3> <A NAME=son>My Son</A>
</H3><P><B>by MICHELLE_LINCKS@Yahoo.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have already given two previous stories of my experiences.  But
they</B>
<P><B>don't cover the whole spectrum of what I've seen and heard.  Do our</B>
<P><B>children somehow inherit a gene that makes us more sensitive to the</B>
<P><B>unseen world around us?  I've often thought so.  I'm no exception to
it.</B>
<P><B>Neither are my sisters, nor my son.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I've always been able to feel certain vibrations caused by the
emotion</B>
<P><B>that comes from different types of people.  It goes the same way with</B>
<P><B>our unearthly visitors or guests.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I used to live in an apartment not too far from my grandparents'
house.</B>
<P><B>Our guests, one wanted, two unwanted, caused quite some scenes.
 Before</B>
<P><B>I have said that I have an over-active imagination, and part of this
is</B>
<P><B>due to that.  But I believe in what I have felt and heard, never saw.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The one ghost we liked was of an old woman.  For some reason, the
name</B>
<P><B>Gloria popped into my mind when I thought of her.  I considered her
my</B>
<P><B>guardian angel during this time.  My mother and step-father would
have</B>
<P><B>these horribly nasty fights almost on a daily basis.  We figured it
was</B>
<P><B>caused by one of the remaining two ghosts.  We called this one "the</B>
<P><B>nameless one," and he was as mean as the Devil himself.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Now, I'm a terribly sensitive person, and the fights had a very bad</B>
<P><B>influence on me.  I was stressed all the time, couldn't sleep, etc.
 But</B>
<P><B>Gloria was always there to comfort me.  There were nights when the</B>
<P><B>fights would get so bad, that I would almost have a nervous breakdown.
</B>
<P><B>Then, all of a sudden, I would feel this sweet calm come over me. 
I</B>
<P><B>would somehow confront my parents, and the fights would stop.  It
seems</B>
<P><B>"the nameless one" hated quiet days.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I will never forget the day Gloria saved my life though.  It was an</B>
<P><B>unusually quiet day.  I was alone in my room, when all of a sudden
a</B>
<P><B>mental picture of the worst fight between my parents came to me.
 (This</B>
<P><B>particular fight never happened, though.)  I tried extremely hard to</B>
<P><B>push this image from my mind, but it wouldn't leave.  It kept pushing
me</B>
<P><B>to the edge of a breakdown.  I started rocking back and forth, and</B>
<P><B>crying.  Then this little voice came to me.  It told me to try to
calm</B>
<P><B>down enough to call my friend.  I ended up calling Regina, and told
her</B>
<P><B>what happened.  She knew enough about the apartment and my
experiences</B>
<P><B>to believe me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Gloria saved me that night.  Afterall, I used to be a suicidal young</B>
<P><B>girl.  And I was almost pushed back to that edge.</B>
<P>
<P><B>It seems, though, that Gloria wanted to show herself to others more
than</B>
<P><B>to me.  One morning, somewhere between 2 and 4 a.m., I woke to my
sister</B>
<P><B>crying and asking to sleep in my bed with me.  Being as tired as I
was,</B>
<P><B>I allowed it.  But, I became more aware of the situation as the
seconds</B>
<P><B>went by.  Why would she want to sleep in a twin bed with me?  More</B>
<P><B>importantly, why is she crying?  My sister hardly ever cried in her</B>
<P><B>life, unless someone really hurt her.</B>
<P>
<P><B>She told me she had just rolled over in her bed, when she came wide</B>
<P><B>awake.  She turned her head to her right, and saw what she described
as</B>
<P><B>an old bag lady, with her hands reaching for my sister, approach the</B>
<P><B>bed.  My sister covered her face with the blanket, then pulled it off
to</B>
<P><B>still see this woman coming toward her.  The next thing my sister
knew,</B>
<P><B>she was beside my bed, crying.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The third ghost, however, has been seen by only one person.  My other</B>
<P><B>younger sister, who's almost ten at this time.  She claims to have
seen</B>
<P><B>him in the bathroom while she was taking a bath.  (Imagine finding</B>
<P><B>someone watching you while you bathe!)  She screamed hysterically
until</B>
<P><B>my mom came into the room.  He was nowhere to be seen.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I've often heard things on nights when I was home alone.  There would
be</B>
<P><B>this popping sound, like an aerosol can bursting, in our bathroom</B>
<P><B>closet.  But, upon inspection, nothing had been touched, popped,
fallen,</B>
<P><B>or burst.  Everything was as it was before.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Plus, we had this triple-doorway system in the house.  There was a</B>
<P><B>doorway from the foyer into the living room, a doorway from the foyer
to</B>
<P><B>the hallway, and, next to it, the doorway from the living room to the</B>
<P><B>hallway.  Each were connected to one central door jamb column.  There</B>
<P><B>was a door in the doorway from the living room to the hall, which was</B>
<P><B>closed most of the time.</B>
<P>
<P><B>On certain nights, you could hear something small, like bb's, being</B>
<P><B>thrown at the door.  When we moved in, there were bb's lodged in the</B>
<P><B>door and in the jamb.  It seems they were from a previous tenant, an
old</B>
<P><B>man, who used to like to shoot his bb gun at the door for some reason.
</B>
<P><B>However, when we checked the door on these nights, there were no
fresh</B>
<P><B>marks on or holes in the door or the surrounding area.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Another thing I'd like to touch upon.  Can infants actually see those
of</B>
<P><B>their relatives they had never been able to meet, due to that
relative's</B>
<P><B>untimely death?  I believe so.  My son, for instance, has been</B>
<P><B>exhibiting some rather strange behavior for quite some time now.  My</B>
<P><B>fiance and I regret that our son and my fiance's father had never met.
</B>
<P><B>But I honestly don't think this is true.  I think they have met, and</B>
<P><B>still meet.  The first time I noticed this behavior was when he was</B>
<P><B>three months old.  (He's five, going on six, months now.)  He was
always</B>
<P><B>an alert baby.  One night, I was sitting with him on my lap on the</B>
<P><B>couch.  I was playing with him, when suddenly, his attention was
caught</B>
<P><B>by something just above my head.  There was a window behind me, but
the</B>
<P><B>blinds were closed.  As this something moved, so did my son's gaze.
 He</B>
<P><B>tured his head quickly to the right, toward our bedroom doorway. 
Then</B>
<P><B>he whipped it to the left.  It was like something or someone was
really</B>
<P><B>trying to get his attention.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Every now and then, I'll catch him talking (or trying to anyway) to</B>
<P><B>someone who isn't there.  He laughs at the air, etc.  I believe it
to be</B>
<P><B>my fiance's father.  Afterall, Charles would have loved our son
dearly</B>
<P><B>while he was alive.  </B>

<H3><A NAME=grandmother>Grandmother</A>
</H3><P><B>by lfuhrman@rocketmail.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was a senior in high school, my grandmother was diagnosed</B>
<P><B>with pancreatic cancer, and came to our town to get treatment.</B>
<P><B>She stayed in our home for awhile, until she was moved to the hospice</B>
<P><B>to die.   A few years after her death, I was working as a carry-out</B>
<P><B>for a local grocery store during my summer off from college.  One day
while</B>
<P><B>I was sacking an order, I looked up and saw a woman waiting for her</B>
<P><B>groceries to be sacked several stands in front of me.  She resembled</B>
<P><B>my grandma...her body, her hair, her mannerisms.  I kept glancing up
at</B>
<P><B>her.  Right before she left, I caught a profile of her and it really</B>
<P><B>looked like my grandma.  I hurried sacking my order so that I could
get outside and</B>
<P><B>see her face more clearly before she left.  As I approached the big</B>
<P><B>glass windows before the doors to go out, I saw her driving off in
a car.  She</B>
<P><B>looked right at me and smiled.  I swear it was my grandmother.</B>
<P><B>I knew it couldn't be, because I didn't really believe in things like</B>
<P><B>that, but when I got back inside, I got a big chill...it was like
someone</B>
<P><B>dumped ice water on me.  I suddenly realized that this day was the
exact</B>
<P><B>anniversary of my grandmother's death.  I truly believe that she was
visiting me.</B>
<P><B>I have never seen the woman again.</B>

<H3><A NAME=visit>My Grandmother's Visit</A>
</H3><P><B>by</B> <B>michael.martin@wonderware.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Back in 1977, when I was 5 years old, I required surgery for a</B>
<P><B>hearing problem I had developed.  The morning I was to have the
surgery,</B>
<P><B>my parents were at home with my younger brother who was only a year
old</B>
<P><B>at the time.  But my grandmother was at the hospital to comfort me.
 She</B>
<P><B>accompanied me from my room into the pre-op room where I was to wait</B>
<P><B>until the sedatives I had been given "kicked in" and I would be ready</B>
<P><B>for surgery.  I remember laying on the gurney thinking, "I feel so
wide</B>
<P><B>awake and alert.  I'm supposed to be falling asleep for surgery." 
I</B>
<P><B>looked to my grandmother and said, "How am I going to fall asleep?"
 She</B>
<P><B>said, "Just close your eyes and you'll be fine."  So I did and that
was</B>
<P><B>the last thing I remembered.</B>
<P><B>	This was not an overly exciting thing to have happened, but it's</B>
<P><B>one of those memories that I always carried with me. </B>
<P><B>	Fast-forward to 1997.</B>
<P><B>	My parents took my wife and I out for my 26th birthday.  During</B>
<P><B>dinner, I began recalling some of my earliest childhood experiences.
 I</B>
<P><B>told my parents the story of my hospital visit (which apparently I
had</B>
<P><B>never done before) and my memories of grandma being with me the
morning</B>
<P><B>of my surgery and how she told me to "just close my eyes and I'll be</B>
<P><B>fine."  </B>
<P><B>	My mother looked at me with a frozen, blank stare for a second</B>
<P><B>or two.  Then she said:</B>
<P><B>		"Your grandma wasn't at the hospital that morning.  She</B>
<P><B>was home with us and your brother."</B>
<P><B>	"No." I said.  "She was there in my room and in pre-op and just</B>
<P><B>told me to close my eyes."</B>
<P><B>	"Your grandma was with us that morning," she continued.  "The</B>
<P><B>hospital called and told us that you would be going in for surgery
that</B>
<P><B>morning and we realized we didn't have time to get there to see you</B>
<P><B>first.  When we told your grandmother, she panicked and became very</B>
<P><B>distressed.  "He's just a little boy!" she told us.  "Someone needs
to</B>
<P><B>be there with him.  You can't let him go in alone."</B>
<P>
<P><B>	Well, somehow, some way, my grandmother was with me.</B>

<H3><A NAME=the>The Visitor</A>
</H3><P><B>by mourningstar@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>From the time I was about 15 until I was 19 I had a demon "visitor."
 I</B>
<P><B>would have a dream where I was just lying in bed, but could sense an</B>
<P><B>evil presence in the room.  When I woke up, I would still feel the</B>
<P><B>presence, which was right next to my bed. </B>
<P><B>I would pretend to be asleep in hopes that it would go away.  (This</B>
<P><B>stems from my childhood.  I figured that if you pretend to be asleep</B>
<P><B>then the "monsters" would get discouraged, because what's the point
in</B>
<P><B>trying to scare a kid who was sleeping!)  It would gently stroke my
hair</B>
<P><B>and sometimes my cheek for a while, then the presence would fade. 
The</B>
<P><B>room would be bone-chilling while the demon was there, and when I was</B>
<P><B>touched it felt so cold that it burned.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Nothing else ever happened.  I wasn't molested or used sexually in
any</B>
<P><B>way, which is really puzzling.  I was touched so softly, like a
lover's</B>
<P><B>touch.  But, the presence in the room terrified me.  Deep down, I
know</B>
<P><B>that if I had reacted in any way, the demon would take it as an</B>
<P><B>invitation and who knows what would have happened.  If it had been
a</B>
<P><B>"friendly" spirit or an angel (which I've also had an experience with)
I</B>
<P><B>wouldn't have had the feeling of terror that I did when I was a teen.</B>
<P>
<P><B>About 5 years after the last incident in my bedroom I was briefly</B>
<P><B>tormented by a demon again.  I was going through a divorce and was
under</B>
<P><B>a lot of stress and had a nervous breakdown.  I don't remember much
of</B>
<P><B>that night, but I do remember lying on the couch under a blanket and
a</B>
<P><B>quilt shivering and crying that I was too cold and couldn't warm up,
yet</B>
<P><B>my body was sweating from the covers.  It also felt like my entire
body</B>
<P><B>was being stabbed by icicles.  For about 20 or 30 minutes I prayed
and</B>
<P><B>demanded that Satan leave my presence in the name of Jesus Christ.
 I</B>
<P><B>finally warmed up, but the stabbing pain I felt took a couple of days
to</B>
<P><B>fade; as if I were actually stabbed with a sharp object.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I haven't had another "visitation" since then.  I do know that God's</B>
<P><B>presence is protecting me.</B>
