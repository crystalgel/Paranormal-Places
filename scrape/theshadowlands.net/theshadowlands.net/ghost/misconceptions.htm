<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">Everyone in every culture has their own beliefs
concerning the afterlife.&nbsp; Some flat out refuse to believe while other
cultures accept it with open arms and in some cases honor spirits of the
dead. None of these beliefs are wrong, but there are some common misunderstandings
with people who believe in ghosts, here are just a few.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">(1) All ghosts are evil.&nbsp; This is becoming
less common as people are starting to realize that most spirits they see
are not hurting them in any way.&nbsp; This theory may have come about
because people feared the afterlife, it startled them and scared them to
see and hear things they weren't expecting.&nbsp; They connected fear with
evil because why would something good scare them. In reality, it is rare
to come across an evil spirit.&nbsp; Usually ghosts do not mean to scare
anyone.&nbsp; They just want someone to notice them.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">(2) Ouija boards are a great connection to
the afterlife. The common misconception about this is without proper training
from a medium or a psychic you could be sending out an open invitation
to the spirit world and you don't know what may answer.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">(3) Seances are a great way to contact loved
ones who have passed on.&nbsp; Again you are asking for trouble without
the proper training or assistance of a psychic or medium .&nbsp; You are
asking spirits to come into your home and prove themselves to you.&nbsp;
Again you never know who or what may answer.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">(4) Reading, studying, and believing in spirits
will make my home haunted.&nbsp; Learning about the supernatural might
make you more open and sensitive to ghosts that were always around but
it doesn't attract them.&nbsp; It just opens</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arrus BT">up a part of your mind that you have inadvertently
had closed off.&nbsp; It opens it to accept the things that you may have
ignored or refused in the past.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">(5) Only old houses or houses that have seen
death can be haunted. People, places, items and areas can all attract spirits.&nbsp;
If a&nbsp; person loved something in life they can come back to it in death.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">(6)A house isn't haunted if I can't see a ghost.&nbsp;
Some people believe that ghosts are all around us and it is up to them
to make themselves known.&nbsp; This can be in several different ways such
as noises, smells, items</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arrus BT">disappearing or moving on their own accord
and apparitions, one or a combination of many may occur with a haunting.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">These are a few of the common misunderstandings
of ghosts and hauntings.&nbsp; I am sure there are several more. One thing
to remember always is to check out any and all natural causes before jumping
to supernatural ones. These</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arrus BT">are just a few of my thoughts and ideas, as
always I welcome yours!</font></b>
