Betty&#8217;s Ghost<br>
<br>
By: lrwilliams82@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
My fianc&eacute;, Lynne, and I moved into a house in Fairfax, Virginia
with our 2-month-old Labrador puppy, Ben. The house was a modest 1950&#8217;s
era, Cape Cod with a finished attic that we used as an office and spare
bedroom. One of the things that attracted us to the house was the
large, fenced in yard and the kennel out back. <br>
We&#8217;d been in the house for about a week when, from time to time I&#8217;d
feel a bit uncomfortable, as though there was a presence there. A
presence that was not &#8216;nice&#8217;. But I&#8217;d chalk this off to my imagination.<br>
Soon, however, there began occur things that couldn&#8217;t be attributed to
imagination. The hall to the bedrooms was in the back of the living
room. Lynne and I would be sitting on the couch with Ben asleep on the
floor.<br>
Suddenly he&#8217;d raise his head and stare at the arch leading into the
hallway. His hackles would go up and he would growl quietly, deep in
his throat. Initially we thought this was cute. Ben, our tough little
watch puppy. But then we noticed that after a moment, he&#8217;d turn his
head and look up as if following someone walk from the hallway to the
door of the attic. When the &#8216;person&#8217; got to the attic door he&#8217;d get up
and scamper over to the door and sniff around the base as though
wondering where the &#8216;person&#8217; went. <br>
One evening I was getting ready for bed. Lynne was already in bed, but
I assumed she was reading. Ben was in the bathroom with me. He wasn&#8217;t
yet house broken so we always kept him close and I needed to put him
outside one last time before going to bed. As I stood there brushing my
teeth, I heard a whistle. It was loud and very clear. Ben heard it too
and went scampering out of the bathroom toward the kitchen. I rinsed
out my mouth and called to Lynne asking her not to call the dog unless
she was planning on getting out of bed to clean up the mess. Then I
heard the back door slam. I walked into the bedroom to make sure Lynne
was really there. She was and she was already sound asleep.&nbsp; I
walked back to the kitchen and found Ben sitting on the back steps with
the door closed and double locked. Two other times we&#8217;d look for Ben
only to find him in the back yard with the door locked.<br>
Neither Lynne nor I had put him out.<br>
There were other subtle occurrences such as the strong pervasive
feeling of a malevolent presence and some extremely vivid nightmares.
But again, these could have been imagination building on itself. Still,
it seemed obvious to me that the house was haunted and the ghost was
not particularly friendly. The ghost obviously didn&#8217;t want the dog in
the house either as most all of it&#8217;s actions seemed focused on the dog.<br>
Then one day we got a call from our landlord. He wanted to know if he could come over and talk to us.<br>
We had never met him, but assumed that this was just a &#8216;please don&#8217;t
destroy my property&#8217; discussion and set a date to meet him. When he
arrived, he brought his wife, a woman who initially seemed very cool
and reserved, but melted when she saw Ben. As we talked, she sat there
in her mink coat with Ben happily curled up in her lap. As it turned
out, our landlord was a retired veterinarian. The woman who had lived
in the house had been a client of his. Her name was Betty and she had
raised white German Shepherds. This explained the fence and the kennel.
He went on to explain that he&#8217;d gotten the house when Betty had
developed cancer.<br>
It was terminal. The treatment was expensive. In return for his paying
her mortgage, she would leave the house to him in her will. That had
been a number of years ago. Recently, the doctor said, he&#8217;d gotten a
phone call from a man who said that Betty had been his mother. This
surprised the doctor because he&#8217;d known Betty well and she&#8217;d never
mentioned a family or children. The man explained that Betty had been
born and raised in Oklahoma in the 1930&#8217;s and had become pregnant.
She&#8217;d given this man and his twin sister up for adoption and left town
and the stigma behind. When she died, she&#8217;d left her body to the
medical college at George Washington University where her ashes
remained. He requested that he and his sister be allowed to see the
house their mother had lived in and to bury her ashes in the yard. The
doctor wanted to know if we minded. A date was set and we left one
Saturday to give Betty&#8217;s children the privacy they needed. <br>
When we returned home that evening, Ben was shut up in the kennel in
the back yard. It was interesting to be reminded that behavior is
genetic! And, a small tree had been planted in the yard. We let Ben out
and went inside to fix dinner. The feeling in the house was incredibly
different. The feeling of a presence was gone, the nightmares had ended
and Ben never again followed a ghost to the attic. He did, however,
chew that little tree down to a nub the very next day.<br>

Edith's&nbsp; Ghost<br>
<br>
By: lrwilliams82@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Many years ago we bought a house in south Richmond.<br>
The house was a rather grand brick house built on a small hill over
looking Forest Hill Park in 1925 by Harvey and Edith Martin. Harvey and
Edith lived a seemingly happy life in the house their entire married
life, raised 5 sons and eventually died in the house at a ripe old age
some time in the 1980&#8217;s. Edith had died only a few years before we
bought the place.<br>
Since then, another couple had bought the house and had fixed it up a bit before he was transferred. <br>
The day we moved in was a busy one. We&#8217;d been going since dawn and
finally the truck was empty, the boxes and furniture were waiting for
us to get to them at our leisure and I was sitting on the front porch
drinking a cold beer in the company of my 3 year old son Zach. It was
dusk. The streetlights had just come on and my son says to me, &#8220;Daddy,
who&#8217;s that lady?&#8221; I asked him what lady he was talking about since the
street in front of the house was completely deserted.<br>
&#8220;That lady, right there.&#8221; I told him I didn&#8217;t see anyone and asked him
what she looked like. With a hint of frustration in his voice he said,
&#8220;She&#8217;s over there under the light, wearing a big dress&#8230;oh, she&#8217;s gone
now.&#8221; I wasn&#8217;t sure what to make of this.<br>
At the time, my wife, Lynne, and I both worked. We hired Kathy to
provide day care for Zach, our infant son Josh and the son of a
neighborhood friend who was about the same age. One day I came home and
Kathy was smiling and shaking her head. I asked her what was up.<br>
&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to believe this, but I put Josh down for a nap this
afternoon and when I went up to check on him, his blanket was on him.&#8221;
I looked confused so she explained. &#8220;His blanket wasn&#8217;t in his bed. It
was across the room.&#8221; After that such occurrences seemed to become
fairly common. Zach was older and in preschool so he was never home
when these things happened. The teddy bear would end up in bed, the
blanket would end up in bed or the rocking chair could be heard rocking
from downstairs. When Kathy would go up to check, the chair would
gradually slow to a stop.<br>
My parents came to visit and have Thanksgiving dinner with us that
first year. When they visited, they slept in what was a second master
bedroom on the first floor that had been built off the dining room in
the &#8216;50s when Harvey Martin started having a difficult time climbing
the stairs. Lynne took great pride in making Thanksgiving dinner for my
folks and particularly my mother whom she was always eager to impress.
The dinning room was lit with candles. Two candles were on the table
and half a dozen others were in several new sconces she&#8217;d bought to put
on the walls. It was a wonderful dinner and we all had a great time. As
we were cleaning up, I asked my oldest son Zach to help me blow out the
candles. At five, this was a highlight of his day. I lifted him up and
he blew out all six around the room and both candles on the table. Then
he helped me carry the dishes into the kitchen. When I came back out,
every single candle in the room was burning and no one else was or had
been in the room. I can&#8217;t explain it. Won&#8217;t even try. I&#8217;ve never heard
of such a thing happening, but have often wondered if Edith simply
didn&#8217;t want the evening to end.<br>
Edith loved that house. Her husband had built it following her
specifications. She&#8217;d raised five boys in that house and she&#8217;s the only
one I can think of who would be so attached to the house. Who or
whatever the spirit was was always benevolent and genuinely seemed to
be looking out particularly for the boys.<br>
There always seemed to be a good feeling to the place and, oddly, we
always felt that we were the caretakers of Edith&#8217;s home rather than our
own. But that was okay with us. She was part of the family.<br>

My Experience with a New Ghost<br>
<br>
By: Myhomex2@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
In 1996, my ex-husband's grand-mother died of a massive heart attack in
the home she shared with her oldest daughter and youngest son, along
with my then, three year old daughter, Shaianne ( pronounced
Cheyenne).&nbsp; Nicky, her son was a bit of a recluse, when he was a
little boy, he was burned over seventy percent of his body, and the
result was he was never comfortable around other people, when Marie,
his mother was diagnosed with adult onset diabetes, he took care of
her, he would bring her her medicine and snacks and make sure she had
what she needed.&nbsp; <br>
Every night at 9 pm, Nicky would leave his room and make Marie some
popcorn and a diet pepsi for a snack, stay and talk for a few minutes
then go back to his room and close the door.<br>
When Marie died, Sharon her daughter went to the hospital with her
middle sister and did what needed to be done to get the body released
to be taken to Chicago to be buried.&nbsp; While she was gone, Nicky
called his niece, Robin, and asked that she and her husband come and
pick Shaianne up because he couldn't deal with a three year old right
now.&nbsp; Robin came over to pick her up, and he wouldn't even give
her a hug goodbye.<br>
After Robin left, Nicky went into Sharon's closet and got her shotgun
and killed himself in his bedroom.&nbsp; Sharon and her sister came
home from the hospital and walked into the house, she called for Nicky
and got no answer, she then went to his bedroom door and pushed it open
and started screaming.&nbsp; She had lost both her mother and her baby
brother on the same day.<br>
I offered to house sit for her to get Shaianne used to living in the
house without Great gramma, and Uncle Nicky while she escorted the
bodies to Chicago for burial. Sharon agreed and so I moved in.&nbsp; I
was out of that house the very same night.&nbsp; I would not stay there
alone with Shaianne.&nbsp; <br>
At first I thought I was just imagining things because I have a very
active imagination, I love scary movies and love to scare myself silly
watching them in a dark house with storms going on outside.&nbsp; But
after the third time of closing a locked (with a sliding bolt lock)
bedroom door and turning off a bedroom lamp, I got the idea I was not
alone in this house anymore with Shaianne.<br>
It started while I was cooking dinner, I turned the hallway light off
because I didn't need it, Shai had had her bath and was watching
a&nbsp; cartoon, and I was in the kitchen, which was parallel with the
doorway to the hall.&nbsp; I noticed out of the corner of my eye a
light, so I went to turn off the hall light, it was already off, I
looked at Nicky's door (which I had bolt locked, I didn't want
Shai&nbsp; in there because the professional clean-up crew hadn't been
able to remove the stain out of the carpet and Sharon hadn't had the
time or the strength to change the carpet yet) it was open and the
bedside lamp was on.&nbsp; I turned it off and closed and locked the
door again, and went back to the kitchen.&nbsp; This happened twice
more.&nbsp; Later that night, I was sitting on the couch in the living
room, when Nicky's door opened and I felt something in the kitchen, I
immediately went to check on Shai, thinking she had woken up and wanted
a drink.&nbsp; She was sleeping like an angel.&nbsp; I again turned the
bedside lamp off, closed and locked Nicky's door and sat back on the
couch.&nbsp; That's when I felt something walk by me going to Marie's
room.&nbsp; I looked at the clock and realized it was 9:05 pm.&nbsp; I
freaked out!<br>
I called my husband ( my then boyfriend) and told him to come and get
me and Shai, that there was no way on God's green earth I was staying
in that house.&nbsp; He got to us in fifteen minutes and anybody who
has lived in Houston, TX can tell you it takes a good forty five
minutes to get from Southwest Houston to Bear Creek Houston, and that's
in good traffic.<br>
The next day he decided he wouldn't leave me in the house at night
alone, he experienced some strange happenings and just about freaked
out when he heard banging on the hallway walls while he was alone in
the house taking a shower.&nbsp; I heard the same things while I was
waiting for him to get there when he got off work, it was a good thing
too, because I got out to check what was going on, Shai was asleep and
I was alone, it was about 8:00 pm and I caught a prowler in the back
yard and called the police, there was a substation right across the
road and luckily my ex-brother-in-law was on duty.<br>
I had the house blessed before Sharon came home and one night she and I
sat and talked and I told her what I had experienced and what I
did.&nbsp; I didn't think she would want Nicky wandering around the
house if he wasn't in solid form.<br>
All in all, it was a very strange experience for me, but it did confirm my belief in ghosts.<br>

3 Experiences<br>
By: Danny the Lost Ghost<br>
<br>
So far, I have had 3 experiences, I will tell you all of them here:<br>
I first became interested in ghosts when I was 8, here's the story:<br>
I was staying to sleep at my grandma's house when I was 8, I was going
to bed, and I coulnd't sleep, in I opened my eyes and rolled over on my
bed, I saw my grandfather who I never met, because he died in 1989,
this started a long lasting child ghost believer.<br>
&nbsp;Here is my 2nd apparition, a few years later, when I was 11, my
mom moved out with her boyfriend, so one night, I was watching TV in my
mom's room, and I saw this mysterious lady in her late 20's- mid 30's,
the night after that my mom's fianc&eacute; is showing me some old
photos, there was this one of his deceased mom, who I never met, but
when I saw her, I recognized her from the previous night.<br>
My third and last apparition, I didn't tell you that when I was 9, I
moved with my dad, so my dad needed to go to an event from the magazine
he works for, so he left me alone in the house, I was just playing
computer games, I was a bit settled down, because my neighboor of the
apartment next door to ours had died two months before that, at age 99,
there had not been any apparitions ever since, so befor I turn on the
computer, my yorkie heads into my room, she didn't want to come out, so
I used inverse psycology, did the thing I always do, I lock my dog in
the room, then go play computer, then come back to get her out, so I
start playing comp, I start hearing steps, I hear like someone is
opening my fridge, crashing plates, knocking on doors, so I go to the
living room to see what happened, and the door is open, I close the
door, and run like crazy looking for my dog all over he house, I look
in my room, and remember i forgot to let my dog out, dumb me...<br>

My Story<br>
<br>
<br>
By: chaotic_kitten_n_ruby_slippers@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
When i was a few months old we moved from our house in Texas to a
beautiful house in Broussard. It was out in the country, and we had
very few neighbors.We&nbsp; bought the house because we were a growing
family, and we needed a big house.&nbsp; <br>
About the ghosts. A few months after moving into the house, my mom and
dad started to hear a baby crying and screaming. naturally because i
was a young baby, they would come and check on me to make sure that i
was okay. As always i was fast asleep with no signs of me crying. Our
closest neighbor was a good ways down the road and besides my mom and
dad, the only other people in the house was my older brother and sister
-both about fourteen.<br>
As i got older other things started to happen. By the time i was five
my mom and dad who usually got along had gotten divorced a few years
back when i was about 2 years old. I went to my dads apartment to spend
the night with him. He had to go to work early the next morning, so he
took me home. When we got to my house we were standing in front of the
double doors trying to unlock them. I looked through the window and a
white figure quickly moved across the kitchen and was gone. I was half
asleep so i didn't really think anything of it, but with all of the
other other things that has happened--I'm wondering if it was really a
ghost.<br>
One day my mom was going upstairs to get my piggish brothers dirty
clothes, but when she got to the stairs, a lady in a long brown dress
was blocking my moms way to get up the stairs.<br>
At night the little baby started to play with my toys. It wouldn't seem
strange if i had stuffed animals or something that would fall off of
the shelves, but i had wind-up toys. How would they have wound up
themselves??? Also, the staircase was right across from my room and at
night you could hear footsteps walking up and down the stairs. I wasn't
the only one that heard it, my brother and sisters who's' rooms were
upstairs heard it too.<br>
I'm not sure if it was a medical thing or not, but my brother started
acting strange. He did some things that i would rather not talk about.
It could have just been medical, but it was strange because he was
always so sweet to me and my mother. <br>
After a while nobody wanted to stay except for me and my mom. My
brother and my sister moved out. Me and my mom were upstairs cleaning
out my brothers room and i found a journal. By this time i was in about
second grade. I opened the journal and read it. At one point he said
that at night he would see things-- Eyes staring at him. Once again
with his "medical condition" i didn't know what to say. I picked up the
journal and ran out of the room. I made sure not to tell my mom.<br>
After a while my mom and i couldn't take it. We were going to get a
priest to come and bless the house. Our lives fell apart as soon as we
talked about it. My whole family started arguing, and my dad was
forcing us to sell the house. We had nowhere to go and my mom broke up
with her boyfriend. Maybe just coincidence--or maybe they...or whatever
it was didn't want to leave. <br>
After a while i was to scared to even get up to use the bathroom, at
night so i moved across the house into my moms office. I felt so much
safer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Once i moved across the house I didn't hear or see anything, except for
one night when i heard a bunch or creaking noises. It was coming from
my moms room. When i went to check, the rocking chair was going back
and forth-like a mother was rocking her baby. And there was an
indention in the chair liek somebody was sitting in it.<br>
I know that is seems strange that things mostly happened on the other
side of the house, but it was two houses. The side of the house that my
room and the stairs was on was a very old house that was moved to the
property many years ago, and the newer part which my moms room was in
was fairly new. A doctor bought the older part and built the new part
hisself.<br>
I had a dream that there were some people in our yard. They were trying
to get&nbsp; me and my mom. They were Japanese...Chinese...something of
that sort. They didn't speak English... it was some other language.
Okay...so i had a strange dream. My mom told me that she woke up and
heard a fight that sounded liek it was coming from the other side of
the house. There were about three men, and woman and what sounded liek
a young child. Just liek in my dream they didnt speak English... it
sounded liek a k noise...not everything thing that they were saying...
but the k sound was very clear in whatever language it was.<br>
I'm not sure when any of this happened, but i have some stories from my brothers friends my dad and moms boyfriend<br>
Phil(moms boyfriend)- at night he would hear my handheld video games go
off...including my wheel of fortune game where you have to press a
button and spin the wheel yourself.<br>
My daddy- this is a letter that my dad wrote. these are his EXACT words-<br>
"Sometimes at night after everyone was in bed, and i would be watching
t.v. a few times (i dont recall how often) i would hear crying. I
turned down the t.v and would still hear it, but it sounded distant,
like it was coming from the other side of the house. It sounded distant
but it was clear. I figured it was Hannah, so i would get up to go
check.&nbsp; I could hear it on the way over there, but when i got to
the hall, I would not. When i checked in on Hannah she was fast asleep.
I looked at her closely and it did not appear she had been crying.<br>
Other times that i had heard it, i would try to quietly sneak over to
that side of the house (Hannahs room) but the results were always the
same. Sometimes Hannah would not be home, or else sleeping in our room,
but the sound always seemed to some from that side. Sometimes i checked
on Ben an Elisabeth, but I didn't hear it come from upstairs. The tone
sounded like a child, a little girl. <br>
A few times i was awaken by the same sound. It would be clear enough
and understood enough that i got up to check. Results were the same.
After the first time or two i would feel the hair on the back of my
neck rise and i got goose bumps on my arms.<br>
I didn't mention it to anyone, until Lisette said that she heard
things. It has been a few years since i have been there, but it is
still in my mind, and i still cant explain it."<br>
(also signed by a priest or whatever but i couldn't understand the name... Father Joseph Breunau....is what it looked liek.)<br>
My brothers friend t-ben---- said that he heard the piano being played
the laughing phone,saw a moving doll, shadows, doors closing and
bumping against walls, whispering, and illumination near Hannahs room. <br>
the laughing phone was one of my windup toys... it was my
favorite...the moving dolls name was sarah...it sat on the dresser near
my bed.<br>

Part of Me<br>
<br>
By: jettacoupe@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
Well, I'll just say that I'm 25 years old now and the first
thing(ghost) I ever saw was when I was about 7.&nbsp; My mother,
yongest brother and I lived in a housing development for abused and
battered woman.&nbsp; She was a young girl who looked to be about 12 or
13, I figured because she was bigger than me.&nbsp; As I was lying in
bed asleep my heart starting beating really fast and that's what woke
me up, I opened my eyes and she was just standing there, with a grey
sweatsuit suit on (the plain ones with just the drawstring) staring
at&nbsp; me, I hid my face, looked again and she was still there
staring at me and for some reason I could not stop staring at
her.&nbsp; <br>
I wasn't really scared because I was a pretty tough kid due to my
mothers circumstances and I didn't feel afraid just wondering what I
was seeing.&nbsp; After what seemed like forever she kinda stepped back
into my closet and faded away, still staring at me.&nbsp; That next day
two little birds SOMEHOW became stuck in my window frame, like on the
outside where you would lift it up to clean, their wings were caught in
there.......totally freaked my mom out.<br>
But enough of that, seeing ghost/spirits has been a part of me since
then, I was told by my grandmother to pray whenever I was scared and if
they didn't scare me ask them what they wanted or why they were
here.&nbsp; As a teenager my mom was given this house in the Mt Airy
section of Philadelphia. Nothing too out of the ordinary, a few dark
corners, cold spots, passing shadows but nothing I had not been
accustomed to.&nbsp; My mother couldn't always see/feel/sense things
but she never doubted what I said.&nbsp; <br>
What was strange about this house was the middle room which was right
at the top of the steps, my youngest brothers slept in this room and
would always say to my mom that I would wake him up at night shaking
the bed.&nbsp; I never bothered him, never got out of bed so I knew
what was at hand they were about to make themselves known so I prepared
to switch rooms with him. The night before the switch I was lying in
bed when I heard I choking/gagging noise.&nbsp; I didn't turn to face
the noise.......then I heard scuffling like two people were fighting
but it was right at me bed as if it was going down right on my
floor.&nbsp; I turned to look and saw exactly what I heard two shadows,
one holding the other down and choking it.&nbsp; I yelled for my mother
but she did not come (maybe I didn't actually yell, maybe she was too
scared to come back there) I turned back around and faced the noise, I
still heard it but I did not see it so I jumped up and ran to my
mothers room.&nbsp; She was awake so I just dropped onto her bed and
cryed and cryed and cryed.<br>
Despite what has just happened i still moved into the middle room and
oh my goodness did the craziness begin.&nbsp; Everything from the
closet door never staying close, in the summer from my bed to the
closet would be cold, things would go missing and then pop up in the
same spot days later, my dog who surprising was not scared became my
alarm.&nbsp; Whenever it became cold or a presence was felt she would
put her head on her hands and give this muffled bark/growl as if to say
"I know you're here!"&nbsp; <br>
*******I didn't even mean to go into detail about this I wanted to
write about a spirit that scared me half to death for about 5 months
when I was 23 living in my apartment.&nbsp; I think they guy I was
seeing brought him into my house because as soon as I stopped my
courtship this presence slowly faded out of my circle and I was back to
my usual three that I think just like me and follow me from place to
place but I'll send that another time********<br>
It came to a head when this one "thing" was really bothering me, taking
things more often, opening the door to the closet all the way (I left
it cracked because I figured it must have been like a doorway for them
or some type of portal, so to save myself the stress I never actually
closed it all the way) shaking my bed, I think "he" went as far as to
tease and hit my dog.&nbsp; She is a white Bichon Frise and a few times
when I got her cut down she had bruises on her body.&nbsp; The first
time I blamed it on her groomer for cutting her too short and giving
her razor burn but the third, fourth, fifth, I took her to the vet and
she said someone was hitting her with something.&nbsp; None of us in
the house ever did that so I blamed it on him!&nbsp; "He" would not
allow my to sleep at night by making it extremely cold in the room,
enough was enough!&nbsp; I was an inner city kid who was fed up with a
ghost...LOL...out of all the things going on outside I had beef with
something inside.....crazy!&nbsp; The night came and I decided to call
him, I waited and waited and waited, there was nothing, I fell asleep
and jst like clockwork I was awakened by the sheet of cold air.&nbsp; I
made sure not to move my body but to just focus my eyes on the closet,
it seemed so deep like there was no end to it, I didn't move muscle and
that's when I heard it "Help me, help me!" in a lone tone, not a child
but whether man or woman I don't know.&nbsp; Oh my goodness are f-n
kidding me, did I just hear that?&nbsp; Still I didn't move and I
started to have a minor panick attack, heart almost beating out of my
chest when I heard it again, I sat up and for some reason unknown to me
reached my hand out towards the closet, shaking like I leaf but not
really scared I had this feeling that something was GOING to grab me
already etched in my brain, in my thought process so it was just a
matter of it happening.&nbsp; And that it did.<br>
I leaned forward with my hand extended almost into the archway of the
closet when I saw it take form, a hand and a wrist of a man,
transparent in color but when it met mine it was a solid form. It was
"him" I knew he was real.&nbsp; When our hands met, again whatever
reason unknown to me, I leaned back and pulled on the hand and felt the
weight of a body, like if you help a friend up off the group by getting
a grip on their hand, I felt the weight! It felt like I had just really
pulled someone out of my closet.............in the mist of all this the
hand faded and I just sat on my bed mentally exhausted, I laid back
down and watched my closet door squeak to a close and fell asleep.<br>
From that day on I could close my closet door and it would stay shut,
the rest of my little "friends" hung around the house and did suttle
things but "he" was gone.&nbsp; I remember it like it was yesterday and
it gives me the chills just writing about it.&nbsp; I never told anyone
about my experiences because I knew it would be hard to believe.&nbsp;
My grandmother never said she believed or not just told me to pray and
I held a lot from my mom because I didn't want to scare her.&nbsp; Over
the past year we just started to talk about it and from what she says
she always knew and even said she could feel when "he" left the house
because it wouldn't be as cold and uncomfortable.<br>
*Sigh* Wow that took a lot out of me<br>
Thanks for your time<br>

A Few Encounters<br>
<br>
By: kirstinkay@sbcglobal.net<br>
<br>
I am currently 19 years old and have had a bit of a past with ghostly
encounters. I have lived in eight different houses in the same small
town. I will list the houses and encounters experienced there. <br>
1. &amp; 2. These are together because I lived next door to my
grandmother and count her house as one of my home. So, 1., I lived in
this house until I was 10, but the only odd things that happened here
were shadows when there were no lights to cast them. They usually
appeared on the walls in my bedroom and were shaped as a person, a
woman to be exact, in an old fashioned dress with puff sleeves. My
mother claimed it was shadows from trees, but, as I said, there was no
light to cast the shadows. The shadow always appeared over my bed, even
when we moved my bed to different spots.I guess it might have been
trees, I was little at the time,&nbsp; but it did look EXACTLY like a
woman, I use to think it was a witch, and would tell my mom to tell her
to go away.I've always wondered why the shadow was the same on all the
walls but was never there until my bed was under it. ( An interesting
side note on this one, the address of this house was 1303 S. Elm, the
same as the Nightmare on Elm Street movies. Not that that had anything
to do with it, but my older sister liked to scare me with it.)<br>
On to 2., as I said we lived right next door to my grandmother, I was
always over there for one reason or another, or just to hang out. But I
never felt uncomfortable being there until after my grandmother died,
about a year after we moved. I would go and stay every weekend and
never have a problem.My uncle, who had lived there with my grandmother,
continued to live there for a bit after her death. After she passed
away, she died in her bedroom of a stroke, I could not stay the night
there. I always felt someone was there. I don't think this was actually
because she was there with me, I think it was because I knew she had
died there. But this story has to do with a music box. My grandmother
owned a music box that had two white swans on it, it was a gift from
her late husband and she cherished it, I loved it. (By the way, one of
the swans head was broken off, and she kept it in her jewelry box, the
male swan, she said she it fell and&nbsp; broke&nbsp; the day of my
grandfathers funeral. I always thought that a bit odd.) Well, that
music box was given to me. And every time I get upset and contemplate
suicide (I have bipolar disorder and have 'lows' from time to time.)
this music box starts to play. It isn't wound and it hasn't been
knocked, as some music boxes tend to play a bit after being hit, and it
only happens when I am upset and lonely. Right now it is packed in a
box buried deep in a storage shed, as I am getting ready to move yet
again. A few days before my wedding, I was nervous and worried as
brides are, and I had to go to the storage shed to get something. As I
sat there thinking of the upcoming wedding and worrying about it, the
music box began to play. I have no idea where the box it is in is
located, but I know it was impossible to play right then. I was
comforting. I knew she was there and happy for me. <br>
3. This house just had a 'feeling' to it. You felt as if someone was
watching you and that you were not alone. I always thought it was a
man. But I never saw anything, and I haven't ever talked to my family
about it, so I don't know if they felt anything, but we only lived
there for a little under a year. I came home from school one day and my
mom had packed all our stuff and said we were moving. I don't know why.
I think this was the scariest house, I've lived in.<br>
4. This one is kinda of odd. Mostly because we rented this house from
the couple that had built it and had lived there&nbsp; until we moved
in. The house was small, only two bedrooms, but it had a finished
basement. That was were my room was. I would here footsteps when no one
was home, but I never thought to much of it. What creeped my out was,
sometimes when I was laying down in my bed, something would lift up my
covers and lay down next to me. I could the bed sink as they sat down
and would feel the covers and pillow move as they then layed down next
to me. The first time I thought it was my sister. But when I looked and
saw no one, I was terrified. The next few times I just closed my eyes
and prayed it wouldn't hurt me. After so many times of it happening, I
thought nothing of it. A few years after it first started happening, I
started dating a guy who would come over early in the mornings and
climb into bed next to me to wake me up with cold hands.......He would
scare when he touched me because I thought it was the 'ghost' touching
me. Another incident at this house was my mothers boyfriend, who was
living with us, died. One day I was walking out of my bedroom door and
I saw him, I at first thought it was his twin brother, but he walked
right through a wall. I thought I was crazy and it was his brother, so
I went upstairs and looked for him, but I found no one home. I saw the
brother the next day and he said he hadn't been there at all the day
before. The ghost was wearing exactly what he wore in life, blue jeans
and a white tee-shirt and brown boots. <br>
5. This house was my uncles, I stayed with him for a little over a
year. The lady he was renting from had lived there with the husband
until they were divorced. The husband continued to life there for a bit
after the split. He attempted to hang himself in the basement, but he
didn't succeed. While I was living there, he died of natural causes.
That was when I started to feel watched, and I hated to go into the
basement. I didn't know he had attempted suicide there until after I
moved out. Obviously, I was feeling his emotional vibes from that time
of his life. <br>
6. I never actually live here either, this is where my mother lives. I
didn't live with her after we moved from house number four. We didn't
get along very well, I was in those teen years....so I found lodgings
elsewhere.I've only had one encounter here. Anyways, I was sitting on
the floor with both my sisters and my boyfriend (the same from house 4,
and now my husband). We were playing board game and were sitting in a
square. My mother and step father were sitting on the couch opposite of
me(I could see everyone the whole time), and I had my back to the
kitchen. We six were the only ones in the house. I had my long hair in
a braid down my back and something grasped my braid and jerked it so
violently that my head flew back. At first I thought it was my
boyfriend or my little sister, but I would have saw their hands. I
don't know what it was, but it had to be directly behind me to pull my
hair and make my head fly back like that. My older sister across from
me saw neither of them reach over to pull it. <br>
7. I lived here a year with my boyfriend and&nbsp; a roommate. The
first night after we had moved in, I was home alone until they got of
of work at midnight. I was laying on the couch watching TV, when I
heard the back screen door open. I looked up, as I could see the back
door from where I was sitting, and saw the dead bolt turn as if someone
put their key in and turned it, then the back door opened and closed as
if someone came in and the deadbolt snapped shut. I got up, left a note
for my boyfriend to get me from my moms and left. I told my mom what
happened and she laughed and said it was my imagination. A person can
imagine sounds or shadows or even ghosts, but you can not imagine the
door opening and shutting right in front of your eyes. After that
little things would happen, like the bathroom door would open as you
were in the shower and no one would be there. A closet door would
always be found open even I heard the latch click shut. Something would
tap on the living room window, then as soon as it stopped it would
happen on a bedroom window, then on the kitchen window, then the other
bedroom window, and back to the living room.&nbsp; A person couldn't
have ran around the house that quickly, because it was as soon as one
stopped another started. Things disappeared only to reappear later
right where they had been. Things seemed to happen mostly to me, my
boyfriend and roommate thought it had something to do with me being the
only girl, but someone would yell my name from another room and I'd go
to see what they wanted only to find they weren't even home. One day I
was in the shower and I heard someone having a terrible coughing fit in
my roommates room, so I went into his room to see if he was alright but
he wasn't in there, I found him in the front yard. He said he'd been
out there since&nbsp; I got into the shower. My cat would hiss at
something in the bedroom. The landlady said when she was there alone
she didn't feel alone. <br>
8. In this house, nothing has happened. Its my in-laws, where I am
staying as my husband completes his military training. I'll be moving
very shortly with him, so maybe I'll have more to add after we get into
our new house. If anyone has any comments. please feel free to email me
at kirstinkay@sbcglobal.net. I'd like to know what others think of
these.<br>

Shadow Man<br>
<br>
<br>
By: fmoseley@jewellcohosp.org <br>
<br>
Hi, I wrote a couple of years ago about our upstairs shadow person
terrifying our teenage children. Especially my daughter.&nbsp; My
children have since moved on to their own homes.&nbsp; Now the
ghost/shadow person is starting to bother my 10 year old stepdaughter
and me at various times.&nbsp; Nothing has happened for the longest
time. (about a year). Most of the acivity happens upstairs and
occasionally downstairs.&nbsp; Now that our stepdaughter is approaching
puberty, I think it has become active again.&nbsp; My husband and I had
made our bedroom down in the basement and nothing has ever happened to
us down there, even with renovations.&nbsp; This winter our basement
flooded twice and it actually went all the way to the other side and we
decided to move upstairs into the largest bedroom.&nbsp; Our
stepdaughter also started to sleep in her remodeled bedroom upstairs at
the same time.&nbsp; She only comes about two weekends a
month.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
The first incident was on a winter afternoon while I was upstairs
taking a bath.&nbsp; I had the CD player on low and our cat was lying
in the floor in front of the bathroom door.&nbsp; I was expecting my
husband home in an hour or two.&nbsp; I heard what sounded like someone
coming into the front door and walking thru the house downstairs, just
like noises my husband would make coming home.&nbsp; The cat sat up and
then waited in front of the door.&nbsp; Then I hear my husband coming
up the stairs and coming around the corner on the upstairs landing and
walking up to the bathroom door.&nbsp; Our house is completely
carpeted, but you can hear people moving around in our home when you
are in another area of the house.&nbsp; The upstairs hallway always
creaks right in front of the bathroom door as you pass it.&nbsp; Well,
the cat was looking expectantly up at the door as if waiting to be let
out.&nbsp; No one opened the door so he crouched down to look under the
door and put his paws under the door&nbsp; to the other side like he
does to other people when he wants them to let him into their
room.&nbsp; No one opened the door, so I called out and no one
answered.&nbsp; So I got worried and got out of the bath and put my
robe on and opened the door.&nbsp; No one was there.&nbsp; The cat went
running down stair and I followed calling out to whoever was
home.&nbsp; I walked thru the entire house and no one was home but me
and the cat.&nbsp; I went back upstairs and was finishing my bath all
freaked out, because the ghost has never done anything that weird to me
yet.&nbsp; I know I was not imaging things because the cat was hearing
the same things I was.&nbsp; <br>
The second incident happened last week about a couple of months after
the bathroom incident.&nbsp; I was lying in bed getting ready to get up
and get ready for work.&nbsp; My husband had just come upstairs to kiss
me goodbye and I had heard him leave in his truck.&nbsp; I closed my
eyes for a few minutes waiting on the snooze alarm to go off for the
last time.&nbsp; Now remember that this room I am sleeping in is the
room that my daughter was constantly bothered by the shadow man in and
often was so terrified that she ran screaming down stairs on many
occasions. I was in between sleep and wakefulness, that in-between
state just before completely getting out of bed. It was not completely
light outside yet.&nbsp; I felt a person push lightly down on my upper
arms holding me lightly and felt them lean over me right in front of my
face.&nbsp; For a second I thought my husband was kissing me goodbye
before going to work, but then I remembered that he had just done that
a couple of minutes ago. I was lying on my back.&nbsp; I opened my eyes
and saw a dark form leaning over me and slightly turned my head to see
whom it was.&nbsp; There was no face just a grayish black figure
leaning over me.&nbsp; When I opened my mouth to scream bloody murder
it completely disappeared.&nbsp; Now my snooze alarm is set for 10
minutes and I had pushed the button about 3 to 4 minutes before my
husband kissed me goodbye.&nbsp; So this took place a few minutes after
he left and only lasted seconds.&nbsp; The feeling I got from this
thing was that it was trying to see whom I was.&nbsp; I did not feel
frightened of it even though I was going to scream, even though I did
not scream I just opened my mouth to when it disappeared and I didn&#8217;t
finish the entire scream.&nbsp; I do not feel like it meant to scare
me. That freaked me out worse than the bathroom incident.&nbsp; Now I
knew that my daughter never made any of her stories up.&nbsp; I always
believed her and gave the benefit of the doubt, but this shadow person
never ever contacted me, until now.<br>
I have to go know but I have two more incidents to write about later.<br>
Thanks for your wonderful site.<br>

"The Radio"<br>
<br>
By: mysticallady06@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
Hello, my name is Tammy and I'm 30 years old. I have had a strange
experience for about 10 years now; I call it "the radio". It can happen
in the middle of the day or wake me up from a sound sleep; when it
first comes to my attention, it sounds like a radio that isn't exactly
in tune with a station, then through the "static" I can begin to detect
a word and/or phrase. It hasn't made a difference where I live or how
close my neighbors are to me. Naturally, when I first began hearing
this, I assumed it was a neighbor's stereo or TVs or maybe a car stereo
passing by. I soon realized that it was not coming from outside of my
home. So of course I went room to room checking radios, TVs and cell
phones to see if they had been left on. I watched a movie called "white
noise" in which the dead were trying to communicate through electronic
devices; well this is different from that. It can be stone silent and I
can hear the "static". I feel absolutely silly saying this but it
scares me just a little. I have had strange experiences all through my
life, but this just doesn't make any sense. I have tried to ignore it,
tried to speak to the source of the sounds, nothing changes. I'm too
sure what it means. I believe in ghosts and other supernatural
phenomena. I feel privileged to receive messages from the other side; I
just wish I knew what to do with them! Nothing comes across clear
enough to make much sense. Thanks for reading my story and I love your
site.<br>

Hauntings?<br>
<br>
By: UGotFlava@aol.com<br>
<br>
Every place I've lived in has never really been "normal".&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are the three stories that stand out most in my mind:<br>
Chipplegate<br>
I lived in this house from the time I was 3 months old until I moved
out when I was 20.&nbsp; We had a half-finished basement.&nbsp; When
you came down the stairs, the "front" part had thin outdoor carpeting,
like on a patio, two couches, TV, VCR, my stereo, and all my games
(board games and cards).&nbsp; The "back" part had a concrete floor and
held extra storage room for stuff that didn't fit in the attic, plus a
washer, dryer and extra freezer.&nbsp;&nbsp; The finished part of that
basement was my getaway.&nbsp;&nbsp; All my sleepovers were held down
there.&nbsp; If I wanted to be alone, I'd go down and close the kitchen
door.&nbsp; My best friend and I practically grew up down there.&nbsp;
It was our retreat during the winter months and whenever it was too
rainy to play outside.<br>
Nothing extrodinary happened there until I was around 7.&nbsp;&nbsp; My
uncle had built me a huge shelf to put all my games on.&nbsp; Being
young, I have no idea what wood was used, but even without being bolted
to the wall, it was extremely heavy, taking my dad, a few uncles and a
couple cousins to carry it in.&nbsp; Being a skinny, scrawny little
thing, it was purposely made so I'd be able to climb it - to get to the
top shelves - without it falling over on top of me.<br>
One night we went out to dinner with a bunch of other familys from the
neighborhood.&nbsp; Upon our return, early enough to play before
bedtime, my friend and I went down there.&nbsp; One look was all it
took.&nbsp;&nbsp; We both ran back up the stairs screaming.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This big, heavy shelf had tipped over, games were strewn everywhere,
parts, pieces and pegs littered most of the floor.&nbsp; Dad, and the
male neighbors who came over for a drink, told the rest of us to get
out while they investigated.&nbsp; Thinking it was a robber, they
searched for an hour.&nbsp; It was a two-story home, plus the basement,
but it wasn't really all that big.&nbsp; They searched every nook and
cranny, but came up empty.&nbsp;&nbsp; Later on, when I was around 12,
I brought it up, telling my parents I had always felt it was
supernatural.&nbsp;&nbsp; My mom tried to deny it, saying it was just a
robber who probably got scared and escaped somehow when he heard us
pulling up.&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked my mom, "Well, then why didn't he or
she start upstairs?"&nbsp; Nothing else in the house was touched...even
then, to me, it didn't make sense that someone trying to rob our home
would start with a child's board games.&nbsp; There was never any
explination for it.&nbsp; I don't know why it happened only once.<br>
Though we did discover that 1 piece from each of three games were never
found again.&nbsp;&nbsp; When my parents were finally ready to move out
for good, I did my own little search for the missing pieces, even
checking in a closet-like section under the stairs, in which the door
was always kept closed.&nbsp; We ripped up the carpeting and replaced
it with new.&nbsp; Tore down all the wooden storage compartments and
rebuilt those...empty as could be, and those pieces never resurfaced.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Pine Place<br>
With the birth of my first child, my husband and I decided, after years
of my living with his brother and sister-in-law and some other friends,
that it was time to get our own place for our growing
family.&nbsp;&nbsp; We got a good deal on a 2-bedroom apartment and
jumped at it.<br>
We moved in when our son was only 11 days old.&nbsp;&nbsp; He often
"talked" to the upper corner of one of his walls.&nbsp; Constantly
staring at it when he was still an infant, gibbering "to it" as he got
older, and when he finally started talking, he would hold conversations
with this corner.<br>
I did feel something in the building (not just our apartment)...but
again, I didn't feel scared, just that "not alone"
feeling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mostly got the feeling at night, when my
husband was working the night shift.&nbsp; I figured it was just
because I had our son...so I wasn't "really" alone.&nbsp; However, the
more my son talked to his corner, the more I felt that "something".<br>
Finally, when our son was around 2 yrs. old, we decided to
investigate.&nbsp; A friend and I asked if the spirit would show him-
or her-self to us in the living room.&nbsp; We saw nothing, but my son,
on our lap, kept talking about the "blue man".&nbsp; We asked him to
describe the man.&nbsp; "What color is his hair?" and the like.&nbsp;
In the end, our son, asked what was on his belt.&nbsp;&nbsp; He'd never
even seen them before, even water/toy models...but he told us "The man
has a gun on his belt, and a weird black stick, too."&nbsp; We asked
how he knew it was a gun, being as he'd never seen or heard of one
before.&nbsp; He told us "That's what the Blue Man said it was."&nbsp; <br>
After doing some research, we did learn that a police officer was
killed in the apartment, trying to stop a burgalry in progress, only a
few months before we moved in.&nbsp; I've always known children are
more sensitive, but being as young as he was and he wasn't scared of
the presence either, we never really felt threatened.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Our New Home<br>
Once my husband and I discovered we were going to have another child
(our 3rd, then...we have 5 now), we decided it was tijme to stop
renting and get a home of our own.&nbsp; We moved in to this home in
late Feb. of 2001 and from the beginning, things have been weird.&nbsp;
Thankfully, again, nothing scary or anything we want to get rid of, but
it has been, I feel, the "most haunted" of all the places I've lived in.<br>
The home used to be a boarding house for college kids before we bought
it.&nbsp; It stood empty for years and many of the previous owners left
items behind after the original owner passed on (and 5 years later,
we're STILL getting some of their mail!) so we're sure that at least
one of these students had a child.<br>
I can't even really pinpoint exactly when things started
happening.&nbsp; I just remember the kids coming down shortly after we
moved in to tell me of the old man they kept seeing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sometimes they'd see him standing in their bedroom doorways, other
times they'd catch a glimpse of him going past their rooms.&nbsp;&nbsp;
All of them (now that even the baby is talking) have said they're not
scared, just "surprised" when they see him.&nbsp; They feel he is
protecting them.<br>
We've all also seen two dogs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upstairs, the kids claim to
see a little white dog.&nbsp; After much searching in books and online,
they describe it was a West Highland White Terrier, but more the size
of a German Sheppard.&nbsp;&nbsp; Downstairs, I myself have seen a
small, black, very shaggy dog, usually walking from the front door down
the hallway into our kitchen.&nbsp; There is never any noise associated
with the sightings (no claws on the hardwood from the dogs, no
footsteps from the old man, etc.), just that "glimpse out of the corner
of you eye" thing, but when focusing on them, they don't
disappear...just continue on their way to...wherever it is they're
going.<br>
As recently as a few weeks ago, I was thrilled to finally see something
more.&nbsp; The kids had a slumber party (just my own) downstairs,
trying to watch all of the Harry Potter movies.&nbsp; Not wanting to
wake them when a friend called late at night, I went upstairs to my
husband's bedroom (I sleep in the living room, even on nights that he's
off, the hard surface of the floors are better on my aching
back).&nbsp; While chatting, I noticed a white mist eminating from a
little room off of the bedroom (we believe it to be an added-on nursery
for whatever student had the child there) and going out the door.&nbsp;
I opened the door and it was gone, but a few minutes later, it came
back, hovering close to me.&nbsp; Again, I wasn't scared, but I was
surprised to finally see something myself!&nbsp; <br>
I simply said "They're sleeping downstairs tonight, can you watch over
them until I get back down there?"&nbsp; The mist floated toward the
stairs, but due to the angle of the door, I don't know if it actually
went down or not.&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend freaked out asking me who I was
talking to, so I explained everything to her.&nbsp; She's a state away
and planned on staying here this summer for a visit...unfortunately,
now she's not too sure if she wants to stay overnight in this house,
even after I've told her the man usually stays upstairs.<br>
Doing research on this home is hard, due to so many tennants.&nbsp; The
owner never had kids, and everyone else who has lived here has been
younger, either those moving on within a few years or so of owning it
before him, or the various college kids who've rented rooms while he
owned it.&nbsp; There is no one else we can think of who it would be,
but it is said that the man always wanted children.&nbsp; No idea on
why he didn't have any.&nbsp; We feel he may be looking over our
children as "the ones he never had".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The neighbors
have all also said that he never owned any pets (dogs, cats, not even a
fish) and didn't allow them.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the dogs, the only thing
we can think of is that one (or two) of the college kids snuck their
pets in and the dogs either loved this home so much they didn't want to
leave or they may have died in the home somehow.<br>

LIFE/DEATH<br>
<br>
By: jennairh@gmail.com <br>
<br>
Hi!&nbsp; I have some stories of my own to send.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
1.)When I was a little girl, I was trying to fall asleep when I heard
my parents in an argument.&nbsp; Since I was only around 7 or 8 years
old, I was frightened.&nbsp; All of a sudden I see this small, red ball
of light flowing around my room.&nbsp; I believe this was a distraction
for me so I wouldn&#8217;t hear the conversation.&nbsp; This is all that I
remember of this occurrence.<br>
2.)At the age of 5, I had a sun-stroke and my tonsils taken out.&nbsp;
I am now 35 years of age and am just now remembering this.&nbsp; I
remember floating above a surgical table that I was lying on and
watching the hospital staff working on me.&nbsp; Very shortly
afterwards, I was walking towards a bright light with a person at the
end waiting for me.&nbsp; When I reached this person, they said they
loved me.&nbsp; I told them I wanted to go with them, but they said
that I couldn&#8217;t because there were people that loved me and I needed to
go back.&nbsp; I remember feeling very sad and reluctant to have to go
back.&nbsp; This is all that I remember.&nbsp;
I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ask<br>
ed my mother if she was ever told that I had to be revived with any of these two hospital stays, and she <br>
told me that they almost lost me during my sunstroke when my father
saved me from swallowing my tongue by putting a pen down my
throat.&nbsp; Its odd that all these years have passed before
remembering such an awesome happening.&nbsp; I guess that just goes to
show that there is something after life on earth!!!<br>
3.)I&#8217;ve been single since my daughter was born.&nbsp; When we lived in a condo, my daughter would always talk <br>
To her imaginary friend.&nbsp; Strange things started happening at this
residence, so we moved before loosing my sanity.&nbsp; One week after
moving into&nbsp; my new residence, I was laying in bed with my 3yr.
old daughter and talking.&nbsp; She said to me, &#8220;Mommy, Thanks for
saving my life.&#8221;&nbsp; Now, this isn&#8217;t something you would hear come
out of 3 year olds mouth.&nbsp; It completely gave me the chills and
all my hair was standing up!&nbsp; It really makes me stop to think
that even though my child was only 3 yrs. old, they still know what&#8217;s
going on without being told or somehow has information that we adults
don&#8217;t have.<br>
4.)&nbsp; My mother recently has had many surgeries.&nbsp; She was
sleeping in her lazy boy one afternoon and woke&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
up to seeing a blond, 3 foot angel sitting on top of her feet.&nbsp; She blinked, and it was gone.&nbsp; She said she <br>
was so beautiful.<br>

Haunted Homestead<br>
<br>

My mom now owns our family's homestead built early 20th century; about
1907, my gg grandmothers indian allotment.&nbsp; We spend holiday
weekends there.&nbsp; My mom and dad both report the water in the
kitchen faucet being turned off and on and the overhead light doing the
same.&nbsp; They also both report one visit last year when thousands of
dead flies were found in the sill of the west window of their bedroom
which was originally the parlour when my gg grandfather built the
home.&nbsp; Dad said this was a definite sign that a "spirit" had been
near.&nbsp; This homestead is in NE Oklahoma in a small town called
Fairland.<br>
Dad had been living in Florida after all the hurricanes doing
reroofing.&nbsp; One of the homes that he and collegues were renting
was/is occupied by Mrs. Cunningham (mrs. C).&nbsp; He said he would
turn out all the lights and shut/lock all doors at night and at least
one would be on and open in the AM.&nbsp; She could also be heard
rummaging around in the kitchen at nights.&nbsp; One night, he and
several friends were watching a movie in the living room and the TV
went off; he told her it was okay and to please not do that, and there
was not more problems that night.&nbsp; <br>
A close friend of his had once looked into the base of a nearby lamp
and saw a reflection.&nbsp; Two of the insurance adjusters had been
staying in this home and reported lights in the kitchen being on after
they were sure they had been turned off thinking that the other
roommate had turned it on.&nbsp; "Mrs. C seemed to like my dad after
she got used to him and no longer gave him any trouble, but did NOT
like lots of people nor strangers in "her home" which is in the western
panhandle west of Ft. Walden beach.<br>

Where is the Logical Reason??<br>

Hi my name is Alicia and I would like to share my experience with you.
I love watching the shows on TV and reading about ghosts, but I'm not
sure if I really believe. I live and work on the Outer Banks of NC. The
place I work is a Preschool. It once was a persons house, I'm not sure
of the age of it, but my guess would be 45 to 50 years old. The owner
of the building now has told me stories for as long as I have worked
there about different things that have occurred there at night. When it
was a residence she told me that the family that lived there had a
little boy about 18 months old that was sick. The child died not long
after in one of the classrooms. The owner stays late after hours and
tells of things that go on like the toilet flushing and toys going off
by themselves. Granted there is reasonable explanations for those
occurrences, but for me the one I experienced I'm not so sure. One
morning my boss (owner) got to the preschool early, no one else was in
the building. We were sitting in the office talking. We saw one of the
other teachers come in with her son, which was about maybe 2. She
didn't come to the office to say good morning or anything so we
continued to talk. We heard and saw her leave the building. About 10
minutes later as my boss was talking I heard faint footsteps running
down the hallway. I didn't think nothing of it. My boss continued to
talk like she didn't hear it, so I thought I was hearing things. No
more then 5 minutes later I hear it again, I looked at my boss and
asked 'Did you hear that?' she said yes. I asked her if the teacher had
left her son there she said that she didn't think so. We got up and
called his named and walked through the whole building and could not
find him. By the time we had went through the building the teacher with
the child came back and we asked her if she had left her son there she
said no. There were absolutely no other people in the building at the
time we heard the footsteps. Since that time I've heard toys just go
off by themselves or just fall off the shelf and there be no one
around. I always look for the logical reason reasons for things that
happen, I can see if the toys going off to be the batteries going dead
or vibrations, but the times I've heard them go off I had just put new
batteries in. One time during nap time (when no one was moving around)
we had a box fall off the very top shelf and it was all the way on the
shelf. I've also heard a child laughing. I'm still a skeptic, but it
has me wondering. My boss doesn't stay after dark if she can help it.<br>
Well, thanks for listening I'll continue to visit your web page.<br>

Toys 'R Us<br>
<br>
<br>

The place is Toys &#8216;R Us in McAllen, TX and one from Target Greatland in
the same city.&nbsp; Everyone knows of the little boy that died from
the fall at Toys &#8216;R Us.&nbsp; This here is my own experience with him.<br>
I used to work over night for Toys &#8216;R Us around 6 yrs ago.&nbsp; That&#8217;s
were everyone said they say the little boy.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll refer to him as
&#8220;Tom&#8221; for the remainder of the story.&nbsp; Well the story for Tom was
that he climbed the ladder that led to the roof. That&#8217;s where he lost
his footing and fell.&nbsp; The ladder is located where it is now Kids
&#8216;R Us where the children cloths are at.&nbsp; Well I was working on day
and I was stalking toys near the cribs.&nbsp; I saw a little figure run
by out of the corner of my eye.&nbsp; I told someone what I saw and
they said it was just maybe a bag from the boxes that flew by.&nbsp; So
I let it go.&nbsp; Then I saw it again and this time I saw a good look
of it.&nbsp; I was certain it was a boy.&nbsp; I ran and told my boss
that I saw a little boy running around.&nbsp; He looked at me and told
me who it was, Tom.&nbsp; He let me know that once in a while he passes
by us to tease us in a game of tag.&nbsp; He has never hurt anyone only
teases them.&nbsp; Everyone that works there and does at least one
overnight will run into him.&nbsp; I myself say him maybe 3 times
before I changed jobs to work for Target.&nbsp; Here is that story.<br>
In target there was also a death of a little boy.&nbsp; It is said that
he ran into the backroom area where the trucks unload there merchandise
and got hit by the 18 wheeler.&nbsp; He died in the hospital.&nbsp;
Every now and then in the backroom and even on the sales floor at night
you can hear someone calling your name in a whisper.&nbsp; I myself
have had it done several times.&nbsp; One of my co-workers quit cause
the ghost took a liking to him and actually would constantly call his
name out while at work.&nbsp; <br>
We never came up with a name for the ghost.&nbsp; <br>
I live here in Incirlik, Turkey with the Air Force.&nbsp; My friends
that still work in these to stores as well as some of my wives friends
that work there say they still see the ghosts.&nbsp; <br>

Childrens Voices<br>
<br>
By: homefry@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Ok, so i've lived in my house going on 4 years. It's always been
peacefull in my little house. Some times i'll see somthing out the side
of my eyes, but don't really pay attion or think really hard on it. On
day when me and my family had first moved in i seen an old lady in a
white nightgown with purple flowers walk out of my husbands and my room
into our childrens room. when i walked in there to see what was going
on know one was in there. That was the only time i had somthing that i
could 100% say that i had seen somthing paranormal in the house that i
could not exsplane. Intell about a month or two ago.<br>
My house is an old house, but not the oldest house in my town by any
means. We live in a little white 2bedroom house right behind a old
church that was bought and made into a privet home. The church/house is
a pritty house&nbsp; restored to it's formal glory buy the loving hands
of a eldrly couple, but this has nothing to do with the Church as one
would think. It has to do with the little white house that stands in
it's shadows. When me and my husband first moved into the house we had
some friends that lived only a couple of houses down from us. I would
go and set on her porch and drink tea or soda and talk about
everything. On one hot and muggy day as we talked she asked me how i
liked my new home, and i told her that i loved it. I could tell that
she wanted to talk about somthing, but was kinda holding back. It was
not long after that i seen the old woman. The next day i brought it up
to my friend and she looked really releived as she told me that they
haved lived in there house for about 3 years and seen renters come and
go. she said the longest some one sayed there was and old woman and her
son, and they lived ther for about 10 years and after the old woman
died( not in the house) the woman who bought it could not keep any one
in there longer than an couple of monthes. As she told me the stories
about the house that was going around my whole block i got goose bumpes
up and down my arms. Could i have moved into a haunted house?&nbsp;
This really got me excited, so i drug more stories out of her. Myhouse
was known on my block as the black dog house for at night when no one
lived ther a big black dog was seen to circle the house all night and
would not let any one near it, but when morning came no black dog could
be found. know i live in a very small town were evreyone knows everyone
and know one had a dog that big and that looked like that( we keep
areally close eye on the animals in our town cause of all the kids).
Other people have seen shawdows on the out side of the white walls that
was well lite by the street lamp right out side of the house, but&nbsp;
the person standing right next to you could not see anything claming
that the area around the house was pitch black, and one time my
landlord was called late one night to say that ther was some one in the
house that was suspost to be empty that the lights was on, and she
informed them that the house had no electric going to it for she had to
have them shut it off so she could get an electrion in ther to fix the
wires in the house. This when on tell the day we moved in the house
than it all stopped. Than one night i was sitting at my computer and
had my earphones pluged in cause my husband and kids were asleep and i
did'nt want to wake them. As i was switching&nbsp; my meda player to
some diffrent songes, i had that moment of static when i heard a
childes laughter two children as a matter of fact. I took of my
earpones and it stopped. thinking my kids were still up i walked into
there bed room to find them all asleep and not one had moved when i
turned the lights on, wich meant they were out of it and have been for
some time.&nbsp; thinking i was hearing things i went back to my
computer it was going on 10:00pm as i put my earpones back on and get
ready to hit the play button i hear it again but this time i could hear
in the static that one had to be an boy i'm not sure how old he was but
his voice was changing were he sweeked alot, and the other one was a
older girl i think older than the boy. and alls i heard was laughter
and the of somthing hard rolling across the floor. I was to loud to be
a ball so i'm thinking it was marbals. I remeber taking off my head
ponesa couple of times and looking around and seeing no a thing. I did
this a coulple of time and the last time i did it i took the head pones
off and looked behind me and seen nothing. when i put the pones back i
heard the childen again, but this time this is what i heard. "ink she
can see us", Don't know, I'm bord wanna go out en play". Know at this
point i take off the ear pones did'nt evan bother to shut my computer
off. I just went stright to bed and layed REALLY close to my husband
all night. I heard children talking all night but could not make out
what they were saying, so finally just like a child i put my head under
the covers and went to sleep. I've heard this happen all the time but
tought it was my kids intell i heard the voices clearly, and relized
that thes children were much older than mine. My oldest being 7 and my
youngest 4. these children had to be atleast 11- 13. i still every
onceand awile hear them but not as ofton as i did at the first. and i
only seen the old woman that one time. I have never seen that dog with
in the 4 years i have lived hear, but my mother used to live acrosse
the street from me and she would not walk over here after dark, cause
she said my yard was to dark and it botherd her. She never has liked my
house when she comes she'll only stay a min or 2. She says it makes her
uneasy and she can't breath right. Well that&nbsp; the latest that has
happend, but i'm sure i'll have more for&nbsp; summer is coming and
things seam more active in the summer.<br>
