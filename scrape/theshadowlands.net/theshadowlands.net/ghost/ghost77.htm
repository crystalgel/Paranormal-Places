</H3><P>
<P><B>By: aeris7g@hotmail.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is my second time trying to send this. The first time, my computer
</B>
<P><B>crashed all of the sudden...hmmm...anyway moving on...</B>
<P><B>Hello, my name is Diane, I'm 16 years old and I will like to tell you
about </B>
<P><B>what happened today. It wasn't more than an hour ago that I brought
my dog, </B>
<P><B>Ginger in from a walk and down to the basement cause we have an air
</B>
<P><B>conditioner down there and that she could cool off. I turned on the
a/c, </B>
<P><B>waited untill she settled on the floor, turned off the lights and went
</B>
<P><B>upstairs to the kitchen. (there's stairs leading from the kitchen to
the </B>
<P><B>basement). No sooner had I finished walking up the stairs, that I heard
a </B>
<P><B>loud crash and Ginger ran up the stairs and hid her head under the
kicthen </B>
<P><B>table. At first I shrugged it off, thinking she had bumped into something
</B>
<P><B>and it fell on her. I called my dog to come with me down to the basement
to </B>
<P><B>put whatever fell at a higher level, but she would only come to the
top of </B>
<P><B>the stairs and look down at me. So, I went down to investigate. Imagine
my </B>
<P><B>surprise when nothing was out of the ordinary. Nothing on the ground
knocked </B>
<P><B>over. nothing missing. nothing. so I'm like "ok...this is weird." but
I </B>
<P><B>continued to call Ginger down to the basement, but she wouldn't budge
from </B>
<P><B>the top of the steps. So, I turned the a/c off and went upstairs to
the </B>
<P><B>kitchen, Ginger following close behind. No one else was home except
my </B>
<P><B>grandmother who was on the porch the whole time. I have no idea what
could </B>
<P><B>have scared my dog like that. She is an overweight dog and only runs
if she </B>
<P><B>has too. If anyone has any ideas, don't hesitate to email me! Thanx
for </B>
<P><B>listening.</B>

<P><B>"The Vase"</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: topeagle9@hotmail.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>True story, as I remember it, anyway. A long time ago, when I was just
a </B>
<P><B>child, I really can't remember how old I was at the time, maybe 4.
Anyway, </B>
<P><B>my family and I used to live in this old house in New York. It was
a </B>
<P><B>two-story house, the biggest one on the street it was located on, I
remember </B>
<P><B>that well. This house, I always felt strange when I opened the door
and </B>
<P><B>stepped inside. Some of the dark hallways I moved very quickly through,
as I </B>
<P><B>felt as if someone was always following me. I took the stairs with
amazing </B>
<P><B>speed, and would never go downstairs unless the lights were on, or
I was </B>
<P><B>already down there. Anyway, this one incedent scarred me for life,
I can </B>
<P><B>still remember it clearly. I was downstairs with my father, and he
was about </B>
<P><B>to go upstairs, I wanted a drink of water, he wanted a beer. The kitchen
was </B>
<P><B>upstairs, so that's where we headed. On the second floor of the building,
I </B>
<P><B>was fixing a drink of water, when I noticed a glass vase on the cupboard
</B>
<P><B>area. Of course, I was not surprised to see this, as my mother would
buy </B>
<P><B>vases on occasion, but never find the right flowers to fill them. Anyway,
</B>
<P><B>this vase began to rattle just a little bit. I thought it was a bit
unusual </B>
<P><B>at the time, but I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, so I
turned </B>
<P><B>away and started to walk out of the kitchen, when I heard the vase
move a </B>
<P><B>bit. I turned around again , and this time I was kind of creeped out.
When I </B>
<P><B>turned, the vase was so still, it was scary. Like the eerie peace before
the </B>
<P><B>tornado. I was about to turn and head downstairs again, but felt obligated
</B>
<P><B>to look at it, almost like I could not turn away. The vase was so very
</B>
<P><B>still. Then it happened - BANG! The vase just exploded! That's the
best I </B>
<P><B>can describe it! It blew up from the inside, very creepy. a couple
years </B>
<P><B>later, we moved out of the house and I've never been back since,
ever.</B>

<P><B>Cowering K-9</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: ralphwil@eclipse.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>I had a experience while in the US Army, now some 20 years ago, that</B>
<P><B>always puzzles me. I was stationed at an Army depot in the South
Western</B>
<P><B>part of what was then West Germany, was a Military Police K-9 Dog</B>
<P><B>Handler and my duty was basically to work during the hours of
darkness</B>
<P><B>and patrol the woodlands. My dog was attack trained and used airborne</B>
<P><B>scent to scout and detect people and animals. The area I patrolled
was</B>
<P><B>also a wildlife refuge. As to the experience, I was on patrol walking
my</B>
<P><B>dog when out of the blue my dog laid down and started to whimper and</B>
<P><B>whine and started to crawl backwards, still in the laid down position.
I</B>
<P><B>myself hit the dirt, listened and looked around in the blackness of</B>
<P><B>night. I neither heard a sound nor saw any movement. I guess that
this</B>
<P><B>activity continued for at least 3 to 4 minutes, then my dog stood up
and</B>
<P><B>just continued being himself. I spent 26 months at this depot with
that</B>
<P><B>dog and It never happened again. I have scouted Deer, Wild Boar ,
Fox,</B>
<P><B>Rabbits, Hedgehogs, Weasels and People with this dog, Knew his alerts</B>
<P><B>for all, so I feel strongly that what scared him was not natural. I
did</B>
<P><B>not feel any presence at that time. I called my Sgt. and reported a</B>
<P><B>Alert and the squad thoroughly searched the area with no further
alerts.</B>
<P><B>I have since then read in a novel (about ghosts stories) Of a solider
in</B>
<P><B>WW2 that had the same experience. I was told that the area (as most
of</B>
<P><B>Europe) was dotted with many battlefield's, In fact there were Huge</B>
<P><B>concrete Pill Box's that were destroyed throughout my patrol area.</B>
<P><B>Anyway, my friends and wife listened to my story and I think they
don't</B>
<P><B>really believe it.</B>
<P><B>Just thought you might shed some light on this experience that
puzzles</B>
<P><B>me to this day. Thank you for your time.</B>

<P><B>Ghost in our House</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: MARNIE0223@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I have several stories to share with you, we have a ghost in our house,
but I </B>
<P><B>think this ghost is here to protect us.  We've had people in our home,
if our </B>
<P><B>ghost doesn't like them, pictures will fly off the wall and things
will </B>
<P><B>disappear that belong to these people.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was telling my husband about our ghost, he just smiled and said 
"honey we </B>
<P><B>don't have a ghost in our house."  The front door (which was standing
wide </B>
<P><B>open) slowly swung shut, and we could hear the latch click.  His computer
</B>
<P><B>chair was facing the computer, turned completely around, until it was
facing </B>
<P><B>the computer again. He stared at the computer chair for a minute, then
said </B>
<P><B>"well then again maybe we do."</B>
<P>
<P><B>More recently, our daughter just got married, and I was wishing that
she had </B>
<P><B>a sixpense to carry in her shoe, I realize that sixpenses are very
expensive, </B>
<P><B>and I said  out loud that I wished she had a special coin to carry
in her </B>
<P><B>shoe.  A penny fell hit me on the top of the head and fell on the floor.
 I </B>
<P><B>was sewing her wedding purse, and my hand were full of material needle
and </B>
<P><B>thread.  I was nowhere near where a penny could have fallen from a
piece of </B>
<P><B>furniture.  My daughter wore the penny in her shoe. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Thanks for your time.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Cheap Rent</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: busby.d@worldnet.att.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I will try and make what is a long story, short. But events like this
must</B>
<P><B>be lived to really understood and even then...understanding is not
really</B>
<P><B>the correct phrase because there is never real understanding, just</B>
<P><B>exceptance.</B>
<P><B>I was 19 and my new wife was 17, we were struggling financially to
put it</B>
<P><B>mildly(this was in 1975).  We heard of a house for rent for $35. a
month on</B>
<P><B>a gravel road not too far from the small town in Arkansas were we were
from.</B>
<P><B>It was a wreck, old , unpainted, falling down, but at that price what
the</B>
<P><B>heck. We were young and to be honest 'partiers' as long as we had a
place to</B>
<P><B>'crash' and have our friends over, well it would do.</B>
<P><B>The first we heard of the place being 'haunted' was when an old man
came</B>
<P><B>around selling wood (we had a wood stove). He told us not to buy much
as no</B>
<P><B>one ever stayed long as 'people say the place is haunted and I know
for fact</B>
<P><B>a murder happened here years ago'. Perhaps that set us up to start</B>
<P><B>'manufacturing' a ghost as some would say; but to tell the truth, we
never</B>
<P><B>gave it a thought. Every night was a party, most of our friends still
lived</B>
<P><B>at home and so our place became the 'hang out'. But slowly things got</B>
<P><B>strange. It really started when I started talking about taking a job
in</B>
<P><B>Texas and our moving. It was as if 'something'didn't want us to
leave(this</B>
<P><B>was something we surmised later upon reflection) as if the life we
had</B>
<P><B>brought into the place was somehow 'welcome'. Anyway to strive for
brevity;</B>
<P><B>there was a room that we never used, it was always 'cold' and 'eerie'.
 Some</B>
<P><B>of this is going to sound 'textbook' ghost story here, but these are
the</B>
<P><B>events. This was a very small shack of a house and we needed the room,
but</B>
<P><B>you just couldn't be in there long(this wasn't just us everyone said
the same</B>
<P><B>thing). We went to Texas to interview for the job; upon our return
we found a</B>
<P><B>strange site ...eveything from the refrigeraror was in the center of
the</B>
<P><B>kitchen floor in a mound, things were missing from around the
house(we</B>
<P><B>actually found the missing items in impossible places at later times),
and</B>
<P><B>the really strange thing was that all the doors and windows were
still</B>
<P><B>locked. My Grandmother had been 'keeping an eye on things and had called
us</B>
<P><B>in Texas to tell us that from looking in the window it looked as if
we has</B>
<P><B>been broken into, but she could not get in to see because somehow they
must</B>
<P><B>have locked up when they left ?</B>
<P><B>This was the beginning of it actually, the place began to be
'unliveable'</B>
<P><B>no noises, feelings of not being alone, depression,feeling of
suicide,...and</B>
<P><B>finally the event that caused us to move out immediately. My wife had
tried</B>
<P><B>to stay there alone on the night before this event as I was away,but
she</B>
<P><B>could not, we had gone to bed but had left the stereo on in an
adjoining</B>
<P><B>room, the stereo was a straight shoot from our bed...nothing except
a</B>
<P><B>doorway without a door between us and it. My wife got up and went to
switch</B>
<P><B>it off, as she was returning(in clear sight of me in the bed), she
screamed</B>
<P><B>and dived into the bed. "Someones in the house" was her words I grabbed
the</B>
<P><B>pistol and went looking. Of course...nothing. But from her shoulder
to her</B>
<P><B>buttocks was four scratch marks 'like a hand had raked down her back'.
We</B>
<P><B>moved out the next day...we just knew not to be there another night.</B>
<P><B>The place is still there, we go there from time to time. But it is
in such a</B>
<P><B>shape that no one now lives there. We have heard that others  have
had</B>
<P><B>expierences in that old place, but this I can say, in all seriousness,
those</B>
<P><B>events so long ago forever shaped the way we 'see' things. And we are
always</B>
<P><B>ready to give these type of stories an 'open minded response'. Because
we</B>
<P><B>lived it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My Haunting</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: khuskey@email.msn.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>I am very happy to see that hauntings didn't only happen to us.  My
family</B>
<P><B>and I lived in Old Towne Alexandria for over twelve years.  If anyone
is</B>
<P><B>familiar with Virginia, Old Towne is one of the  most haunted places
in the</B>
<P><B>metropolitan area.  We lived in subsidized housing for eight years
in this</B>
<P><B>small city and here is where the haunting began.  My mother was eight
months</B>
<P><B>pregnant with my brother, Kevin, when we moved in.  So happy to have
a home</B>
<P><B>of our own, we cleaned and settled in in no time.  The FIRST night
we were</B>
<P><B>there, I remember lying in bed with my mother and hearing a very hard</B>
<P><B>knocking at our door.  We were new in the area and had no idea who
it could</B>
<P><B>possibly be.  We looked out the window and saw nothing or no one. This
is</B>
<P><B>were it all began.  After the knocking on the door, I was freaked,
so it a</B>
<P><B>little hard for me to go to sleep.  When I finally went to sleep, I
was</B>
<P><B>woken up by scratching on  the walls.  Not like mice, but like human
hands</B>
<P><B>purposely scratching. As soon as I realized where the noise was coming
from</B>
<P><B>the bed began to shake as thought there was an earthquake.  Although
I did</B>
<P><B>not get up or even say a word to my mother we were both aware of what
was</B>
<P><B>happening.  To make a twelve year story short, we were constantly
bothered</B>
<P><B>by these ghosts.  There was constant movement in the house.  Knocks
on the</B>
<P><B>front door, boxes falling off shelves for no reason that could be seen.
 I</B>
<P><B>fell victim to a "flying" box right on my nose.  A swollen bruised
nose was</B>
<P><B>a result.  My brother was attacked just as much as every other person
in the</B>
<P><B>house.  One morning my mother had left my brother sleeping while she
went to</B>
<P><B>fill the car with gas.  My brother woke up to a woman's screaming as
though</B>
<P><B>being stabbed to death.  He got up and ran to a neighbor's house. 
These are</B>
<P><B>small things compared to what many of our other family members and
even</B>
<P><B>family friends have witnessed.  The bottom line is, these ghosts were
in</B>
<P><B>absolute control of the house and in a way, in control of us.  We
were</B>
<P><B>scared out of our minds for months at a time.  It was the worst experience
I</B>
<P><B>have ever been through.  I'd rather get my wisdom teeth pulled than
spend</B>
<P><B>the night in that house ever again.  Luckily, we moved out and haven't
had a</B>
<P><B>problem since.  Weird thing is, the people who live in that same house
had</B>
<P><B>informed us that crazy things are happening to them too.  We researched
the</B>
<P><B>area, and there was a railway that ran directly in front  of our house,
and</B>
<P><B>on the other side of the tracks was a graveyard for poor people.  There
are</B>
<P><B>rumors that when the land was purchased by the company building the</B>
<P><B>townhouses, not all of the bodies were exhumed.  To make matters worse,
a</B>
<P><B>lady with five children lived in the exact same house fifteen years
before</B>
<P><B>we did, and she died.  This woman did not want to die and leave her
children</B>
<P><B>to the government to split them up.  So, she therefore died without
wanting</B>
<P><B>to.  Other people in the same row of houses have complained about
ghosts,</B>
<P><B>noises, voices, waking up to screams, etc..  I am now such a believer
that I</B>
<P><B>guess you can say I am almost obsessed.  My father jokes about it,
saying</B>
<P><B>that the only reason I chose to go to the college I did was to get
the scoop</B>
<P><B>on the old civil war hospital which is now a residence hall.  Yes,
I seem to</B>
<P><B>be attracted to old historical places, which happen to be haunted.
 I often</B>
<P><B>return to Old Towne to visit the shops and every now and then I walk
(run)</B>
<P><B>by the house that for so long tortured me and my family.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The Trestles</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: schickfu@hotmail.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>I am now 20, and the house I grew up in is only about 100 feet from
the city </B>
<P><B>line of Mexico, Missouri, so my road turns to gravel there.  Down this
</B>
<P><B>gravel road are a set of trestles that support train tracks.  It is
rumored </B>
<P><B>that the KKK used to hang it's victims there, and other people had
told me </B>
<P><B>stories of strange things that happened there.  I was never afraid
of it </B>
<P><B>though, until this incident when I was in high school.  My best friend
and I </B>
<P><B>used to get free food from a fast food place where our friend worked
and sit </B>
<P><B>on top of the trestles and eat it. On one such night we were eating
and </B>
<P><B>joking when we heard a disturbance in the gravel road below that sounded
</B>
<P><B>much like footsteps.  This didn't really scare me, though, because
there </B>
<P><B>were woods to either side of the road and it could be a deer or some
other </B>
<P><B>animal.  We could tell the sounds were directly under us, under the
</B>
<P><B>trestles, so we kept eating and joking.  Then later, the noises were
still </B>
<P><B>there and my friend and I stopped talking.  We looked at each other
for a </B>
<P><B>while because we could tell the footsteps had moved out in front of
us, but </B>
<P><B>we saw nothing.  It was a full moon and whatever was making the noise
would </B>
<P><B>have been at least decent sized but we saw nothing.  The first thing
that </B>
<P><B>frightened us was when we both made the observation that the footsteps
</B>
<P><B>sounded like they were obviously bipedal, or on two feet.  The next
thing </B>
<P><B>that scared us was, though we saw nothing, the sound of the footsteps
was </B>
<P><B>moving towards our car.  This truly freaked us out, but we didn't know
what </B>
<P><B>to do.  Every time we threw a rock at the noise it would stop for a
second, </B>
<P><B>then start back up.  By now it sounded as if it was just circling our
car.  </B>
<P><B>We sat scared as hell for about five minutes before we decided to make
a mad </B>
<P><B>dash for the car and leave.  Now, every time I go out there or even
look </B>
<P><B>down my road, I get the worst chills and I beg whoever is driving to
leave.  </B>
<P><B>This is definitely a site for phenomenon, for many people I know have
their </B>
<P><B>stories about that place, and mine is the least scary of them.  I just
have </B>
<P><B>the misfortune of living right next to it.  I will try to get my friends
to </B>
<P><B>tell their stories, also.</B>
<P>
<P><B>A Hug From My Mom</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: KMD6@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I have always been a believer in life after death and the realism of
ghosts. </B>
<P><B>I've heard hundreds of stories and experiences as well.  And now I
can tell </B>
<P><B>my own experience to others. When I was a freshman in high school,
my mom had </B>
<P><B>a massive heart attack and died in her sleep. It was all so sudden.
No one </B>
<P><B>knew that she had any health problems.  Heart problems had run in the
family </B>
<P><B>though since they had taken the lives of her mother as well as one
of her </B>
<P><B>brothers. Well she died suddenly on April 25, 1995 in the early morning
</B>
<P><B>hours. I was a wreck. I had lost not only my mother but also my best
friend. </B>
<P><B>I used to confide in her and tell her everything and now she was gone.
When </B>
<P><B>she died, I helped take over the "motherly duties" around the house
since my </B>
<P><B>aunts labled me as being the most responsible even though I was the
second </B>
<P><B>oldest. It was tough for me. I was busy balancing my honor roll status
in </B>
<P><B>school, my soccer teams and taking care of everyone. Well it was mid-summer
</B>
<P><B>and my older sister was giving me a hard time about everything giving
me the </B>
<P><B>"your not my mother so I don't have to listen to you, etc..."  I was
really </B>
<P><B>starting to feel depressed and overwhelmed about having to go from
14 years </B>
<P><B>old to 40 in a matter of minutes. My teenage years were taken away
from me </B>
<P><B>and I didn't think it was fair. I went to bed on a hot summer night
(89 + </B>
<P><B>humidity). My bedroom is not air conditioned and it was like a sauna
in </B>
<P><B>there. I was crying for some reason for something that my sister had
done to </B>
<P><B>me.  Then I rolled over on my stomach which I never do when I am in
bed. </B>
<P><B>Suddenly there was this really ice cold feeling that came over me.
It felt as </B>
<P><B>though someone was holding me tightly in a huge "hug."  I was so scared.
I </B>
<P><B>tried to move but I was paralyzed in fight. Then I could see that there
was </B>
<P><B>some sort of light coming from behind me. I tried to turn around but
I still </B>
<P><B>couldn't move. This went on for a few minutes. Even after everything
became </B>
<P><B>normal again, I still couldn't turn around because I was so frightened.
I </B>
<P><B>later started to think about what had happened and I realized it was
my mom. </B>
<P><B>She always provided me with hugs when I needed them the most and I
think that </B>
<P><B>she felt that I needed one then. It's been 4 years and I haven't see
anything </B>
<P><B>since then but now I know that she is still there for me when I need
her.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My Protector Ghost</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: jeni_67@hotmail.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I've known that I had a ghost since age 5. He would do little things
that </B>
<P><B>never really hurt me, like pull at my pigtails and tickle me. These
things </B>
<P><B>used to scare me, and I told my parents about it, but they wrote it
off as </B>
<P><B>childish imagination. It stopped after I told them. The first time
he really </B>
<P><B>kept me from getting hurt was at the park. I was about 7 at the time.
I was </B>
<P><B>at the swings with my brother, and we were racing to see who could
go the </B>
<P><B>highest. Of course he was winning, being 3 years older than me. He
decided </B>
<P><B>that he had had enough and jumped of of the swing, landing without
problems. </B>
<P><B>I tried to jump, but I couldn't take my hands off of the chains, nor
could I </B>
<P><B>move my butt in the seat. The whole time this happened, it felt as
if </B>
<P><B>someone was holding me there. When the swing got close enough to the
ground </B>
<P><B>as to where I could jump without getting hurt, the feeling went away
and I </B>
<P><B>jumped out. I ran straight to my mom and refused to go near those
particular </B>
<P><B>swings again. He was also a comfort during my parent's divorce. I was
9, and </B>
<P><B>I would cry at night when I was supposed to be sleeping. One night
it felt </B>
<P><B>as if someone where sitting on the bed with me, and when I looked,
I saw a </B>
<P><B>boy. The image wasn't very clear, and all I really remember was that
he told </B>
<P><B>me not to worry, things would get better and I would be fine, and he
wiped </B>
<P><B>the tears off of my face. I asked him what his name was, but he just
smiled </B>
<P><B>and told me to go to sleep. The he was gone. I felt him there every
night </B>
<P><B>that I got upset after that, but I never saw him again until a few
months </B>
<P><B>ago. I was home by myself at the time, and I was in my room with my
CD </B>
<P><B>player up quite loud. I felt a presence in the room, and when I looked
up, I </B>
<P><B>saw my ghost. He told me to get up and go to my friend Kirsty's house,
who </B>
<P><B>live down the street from me. I ignored him for a while, but he didn't
go </B>
<P><B>away. I asked him what his name was and his age, but he said that he
</B>
<P><B>wouldn't tell me unless I went to her house. After considering it,
I called </B>
<P><B>her and asked if I could come over. She said yes, and he said that
his name </B>
<P><B>was Casey, and he was 15. Then he told me to get out and go down there
</B>
<P><B>before he scared me. I didn't believe him, so I sat on my bed, being
</B>
<P><B>stubborn. He shrugged and vanished. About 3 minutes later, I felt icy
</B>
<P><B>fingers on the back of my neck. I turned around, but didn't see anything.
I </B>
<P><B>wrinkled my nose up and thought that he wasn't scary at all. After
a few </B>
<P><B>more minutes of me sitting on the bed, he reappeared and picked me
up. He </B>
<P><B>wouldn't let go of me, even though I wouldn't stop wiggling. He just
said </B>
<P><B>that if I wouldn't leave he would take me there his self. He did exactly
</B>
<P><B>what he said. He dropped me off on her front porch, rang the bell,
and </B>
<P><B>disappeared. She answered the door and drug me inside, then proceeded
to </B>
<P><B>slam the door shut and lock it. I asked her what her problem was, and
she </B>
<P><B>thought I was nuts because I hadn't heard that a serial killer was
in our </B>
<P><B>town. About 15 minutes later the cops showed up across the street at
my </B>
<P><B>house, and out they came with the serial killer. Apparently a neighbor
had </B>
<P><B>heard something from our house, and upon investigation found that our
</B>
<P><B>backdoor had been kicked open. I still feel Casey around, but I haven't
seen </B>
<P><B>him since he put me on my friend's porch that night. I don't know yet,
but I </B>
<P><B>am sure that sometime soon I will find out who he is. This may seem
to </B>
<P><B>extreme for some to believe, but I know what happened, and no type
of </B>
<P><B>explanation will ever make me think that any of this is untrue.</B>

<P><B>Creaky floor</B>
<P>

<P><B> </B>
<P><B>I am right now 14 and this experience happened at my old home in</B>
<P><B>Bloomington, IL.  It was the weekend so I decided to stay up late.
 When I</B>
<P><B>went to sleep it was about 12:00.  I was trying to sleep when I heard
what</B>
<P><B>sounded like footsteps in my room.  At first I thought it was just
the house</B>
<P><B>creaking like everynight but this time it went on longer.  I was very
very</B>
<P><B>scared.  Then the scariest part happened, I started to viberate.  I
mean</B>
<P><B>viberate really fast.  It may be because I was scared but that has
never</B>
<P><B>happend to me before.  I have no idea how long I was this way but then
I</B>
<P><B>felt very very calm.  Like I was being protected.  In the moring my
mom said</B>
<P><B>see heard something walking around in my room at 4:00 A.M.  She thought
it</B>
<P><B>was me, but I was asleep already.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Murph says "BYE"</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: cherdallascowboy@hotmail.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>I love these reportings. I am sure there is some other realm we go
to </B>
<P><B>because of my experiences. I have never had any with relatives but
these </B>
<P><B>involve a very good friend of mine-Murph. Murph(you guessed it) was
full </B>
<P><B>blooded Irish, loved Notre Dame, St. Pats Day and was the first to
run in </B>
<P><B>work and tell me about this new band called Guns N Roses. I had to
go listen </B>
<P><B>to their new song and I was an instant fan. These facts all go together
like </B>
<P><B>this...</B>
<P>
<P><B>We were the same age, worked in the same place doing the same thing(editing
</B>
<P><B>movies) and went out(as friends) and got along great. Co-workers even
asked </B>
<P><B>why we did not date and we just said it would ruin our friendship.
When I </B>
<P><B>look back I don't know why we didn't go out. I think we had a even
more </B>
<P><B>special relationship by what happened.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Murph had been sick as a kid and had surgeries. Well unknown to anyone
he </B>
<P><B>had contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion in the late 70's. He
died in </B>
<P><B>the late 80's and was buried on St. Pats day in his Notre Dame boxers.
He </B>
<P><B>was in the hospital and we knew it was coming fast. Everytime I went
to see </B>
<P><B>him he was asleep, so I never talked with him.</B>
<P><B>I was staying at a friend of mines house the night he died. I was sleeping
</B>
<P><B>in the bed and loud music woke me up and made me bolt out of bed. I
was </B>
<P><B>"dreaming" that Murph was running towards me and he had a white limo
telling </B>
<P><B>me to get in. When I opened the door it turned into a hearse and he
was in a </B>
<P><B>casket. But the music was blaring as I woke up. I thought what idiot
is here </B>
<P><B>playing the stereo loud! It was a song by Guns N Roses(our band) called
</B>
<P><B>November Rain. It was so loud I made it all the way downstairs and
into the </B>
<P><B>family room and the stereo was not on!! Then the music quit. I felt
very </B>
<P><B>sad, very quickly--I knew Murph had just died. Then I smiled and said
Thanks </B>
<P><B>for talking to me now. I felt very comforted by the visit. That morning
I </B>
<P><B>found out he did die at around when the music came on. 1 year later
this </B>
<P><B>happened.</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is honest to God true!! I left work and it was St Pats day, so
I was </B>
<P><B>looking all over for a green carnation to take to the graveside. I
could not </B>
<P><B>find one in the whole town. They were all sold out. I bought a rose
and gave </B>
<P><B>it to Murph and asked him to not be so mad that I brought him a rose
instead </B>
<P><B>of a carnation. The next morning My 2 kids and I went out to the garage
to </B>
<P><B>go to work and my daughter sat down and then asked me why I had this
in the </B>
<P><B>car. I looked over and it was a green carnation!! The truth. It makes
me cry </B>
<P><B>to write about it. He always had to get the last word in!!   Thanx
for </B>
<P><B>listening.</B>

<P><B>Cats Ears</B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>I have written to you previously about odd things my</B>
<P><B>husband and I had experienced in our last home.  Now I</B>
<P><B>have an interesting occurence in our new home to share</B>
<P><B>with you.  We've lived here for about two months now</B>
<P><B>and until last week, nothing out of the ordinary had</B>
<P><B>occurred.  One night after I had put my daughter to</B>
<P><B>bed, I was lying on the couch watching TV.  I was</B>
<P><B>lying on my stomach facing so that I was able to see</B>
<P><B>through our kitchen and down the hallway (we live in a</B>
<P><B>mobile home.  As I was watching Tv when I noticed two</B>
<P><B>black pointy ears coming towards the couch fairly</B>
<P><B>quickly.  Naturally, I assumed it was my cat.  I</B>
<P><B>figured he was going to jump up onto the arm of the</B>
<P><B>couch.  The ears came towards me, and I saw two paws</B>
<P><B>reach for the arm and felt the impact on the couch. </B>
<P><B>When I sat up to see why he wasn't jumping onto the</B>
<P><B>couch, he wasn't there.  There are still some unpacked</B>
<P><B>boxes sitting by that end of the couch so I thought he</B>
<P><B>might have slipped between them and went behind the</B>
<P><B>couch.  I got up and looked behind the couch and all</B>
<P><B>around and didn't see him.  I started calling him and</B>

<P><B>TWO GENERATIONS, TWO STORIES, ONE HOUSE</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: moleron@sssnet.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>MY GRANDPARENTS BOUGHT THE HOUSE MY MOTHER LIVED IN THE </B>
<P><B>MAJORITY OF HER LIFE WHEN SHE WAS IN THE FIRST GRADE. THE HOUSE ITSELF
</B>
<P><B>WASN'T ALWAYS A HOUSE.&amp;nbsp; IT ONCE SERVED AS A GRANGE OR TOWN
HALL AND LATER </B>
<P><B>BECAME THE SHOP OF A BLACKSMITH. SOMEWHERE, MY MOTHER HAS A PHOTO OF
THE </B>
<P><B>HOUSE TAKEN BACK IN THE EARLY 1900'S. STRANGELY, IT IS EASILY </B>
<P><B>RECOGNIZABLE.THE HOUSE IS A VERY SIMPLE DESIGN: IT IS A BASIC RECTANGULAR
</B>
<P><B>SHAPED BUILDING WITH AN UNUSUALLY LARGE LIVING ROOM (BECAUSE OF ITS
ORIGIN) WITH </B>
<P><B>ONE SMALL ROOM AND A SMALL BATHROOM ON THE FIRST FLOOR THAT WAS ADDED
ON WHEN </B>
<P><B>THE BLACKSMITH OPENED HIS SHOP. THE KITCHEN WAS ADDED LATER WHEN THE
FIRST </B>
<P><B>HOME OWNERS BOUGHT THE SHOP GIVING THE HOUSE A SORT OF 'L' SHAPE TO
IT. A </B>
<P><B>BACK PORCH RUNS THE LENGTH OF THE HOUSE LEADING TO THE KITCHEN. AN
</B>
<P><B>UPSTAIRS WAS ALSO ADDED TO THE ORIGINAL STRUCTURE, GIVING THE HOUSE
AN EXTRA </B>
<P><B>THREE BEDROOMS.WHEN MY MOTHER WAS ABOUT SEVEN YEARS OLD (ABOUT THE
SECOND </B>
<P><B>GRADE) HER GRANDMOTHER LIVED WITH THEM, AS SHE HAD DEVELOPED ALZHEIMER'S
AND WAS </B>
<P><B>IN NEED OF EXTENDED CARE. THE UPSTAIRS BEDROOM DIRECTLY OFF THE STAIRS
</B>
<P><B>BELONGED TO HER GRANDMOTHER, WHILE MOTHER HAD THE SECOND ROOM AND MY
UNCLE TOOK </B>
<P><B>THE ROOM AT THE END OF THE HALL. MY GRAND PARENTS HAD TO REMOVE GREAT
</B>
<P><B>GRANNY'S DOOR BECAUSE SHE HAD A HABIT OF LOCKING HERSELF IN WITHOUT
BEING ABLE </B>
<P><B>TO GET OUT. MY MOTHER AND HER GRANDMOTHER WERE EXTREMELY CLOSE.</B>
<P><B>MOTHER HAD A PARTICULARLY FAVORITE HAT THAT GREAT GRANNY ONLY LET HER
PLAY WITH </B>
<P><B>ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS BECAUSE IT WAS HER "TO-DO" HAT.</B>
<P><B>WHEN GREAT GRANNY DIED, MY GRANDPARENTS CHOSE NOT TO TELL MY </B>
<P><B>MOTHER AND UNCLE RIGHT AWAY. THEY FELT THAT THEY WERE TOO YOUNG TO
</B>
<P><B>UNDERSTAND. ONE EVENING, WHILE MY MOTHER WAS ASLEEP, SHE HEARD HER
</B>
<P><B>GRANDMOTHER WHISPERING TO HER. MOTHER AWOKE TO SEE HER GRANDMOTHER
SITTING </B>
<P><B>NEXT TO HER ON THE BED. GREAT GRANNY ASKED MOTHER TO COME INTO HER
ROOM </B>
<P><B>BECAUSE SHE HAD SOMETHING FOR HER. MOTHER FOLLOWED HER INTO THE ROOM
AT </B>
<P><B>THE TOP OF THE STAIRS. GREAT GRANNY WENT TO THE CLOSET, GOT OUT MOTHER'S
</B>
<P><B>FAVORITE HATBOX AND SET IT ON THE BED BETWEEN THEM. SHE LET MOTHER
OPEN </B>
<P><B>THE BOX AND PUT THE HAT ON. GREAT GRANNY STARTED TO TELL MOTHER THAT
SHE </B>
<P><B>WAS GOING AWAY AND THAT SHE WOULD MISS MOTHER MOST OF ALL. NOT TO WORRY,
</B>
<P><B>SHE TOLD MY MOTHER, THEY WOULD SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN.SHE WANTED </B>
<P><B>MOTHER TO HAVE THE HATBECAUSE SHE LOVED IT SO MUCH. THEN SHE HURRIED
</B>
<P><B>MOTHER BACK TO BED BECAUSE IT WAS LATE AND THERE WAS SCHOOL THE NEXT
DAY.</B>
<P><B>IN THE MORNING WHEN MOTHER PASSED GREAT GRANNY'S ROOM, THE HAT </B>
<P><B>BOX SAT OPENED ON THE BED AS IT HAD BEEN THE NIGHT BEFORE.</B>
<P><B>THIS WAS THE FIRST OF MANY THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO MY MOTHER </B>
<P><B>IN THE HOUSE.LITTLE THINGS, LIKE MISSING POSSESSIONS, FOOTSTEPS, </B>
<P><B>WHISPERING AND STRANGE FEELINGS SPECIFIC AREAS OF THE HOUSE HAPPENED
TO MOTHER </B>
<P><B>FREQUENTLY AFTER THAT. SHE DIDN'T MENTION IT TO ANYONE BECAUSE SHE
THOUGHT </B>
<P><B>THAT IT WAS HER IMAGINATION. AND MOST OF ALL, SHE THOUGHT THAT SEEING
HER </B>
<P><B>GRANDMOTHER WAS AN EPISODE OF SLEEP WALKING EVEN THOUGH SHE HAD NEVER
BEEN KNOWN </B>
<P><B>TO SLEEP WALK BEFORE OR AFTER.MY MOTHERS MARRIAGE TO MY FATHER ENDED
SOON AFTER IT </B>
<P><B>BEGAN. MY TWENTY-YEAR-OLD MOTHER MOVED BACK IN WITH HER PARENTS WITH
ME </B>
<P><B>WHEN I WAS AN INFANT. I LIVED WITH MY GRANDPARENTS UNTIL I WAS SEVEN
YEARS </B>
<P><B>OLD, AT WHICH TIME MY MOTHER REMARRIED AND WE MOVED OUT. BY THEN, I
FELT </B>
<P><B>THIS INCREDIBLE CONNECTION WITH THAT HOUSE. I COULDN'T EXPLAIN IT,
BUT </B>
<P><B>JUST VISITING THAT HOUSE WAS NOT ENOUGH. I MISSED IT.</B>
<P><B>AT SEVENTEEN, I MOVED BACK IN WITH MY GRANDPARENTS BECAUSE MY </B>
<P><B>STEP FATHER AND I JUST COULDN'T GET ALONG. BY THEN MY GRANDPARENTS
WERE </B>
<P><B>OCCUPYING THE DOWNSTAIRS BEDROOM BECAUSE IT WAS TOO DIFFICULT FOR GRANDPA
TO </B>
<P><B>CLIMB THE STAIRS. I TOOK MY UNCLE'S OLD ROOM AT THE END OF THE HALL.
</B>
<P><B>FROM THE TIME I AM OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER, I HAVE HAD A SUBTLE </B>
<P><B>FEAR OF THE ROOM AT THE OPENING OF THE STAIRS. THERE WAS AN OVERWHELMING
</B>
<P><B>FEELING OF ANGER, AND SOMEONE WATCHING ME IN THAT ROOM. I TRIED, AS
</B>
<P><B>PERSONAL ACT OF BRAVERY, TO STAY IN THAT ROOM FOR A WEEK. BY </B>
<P><B>THETHIRD NIGHT, I HAD TO SLEEP DOWN STAIRS. THE WINDOW IN THAT ROOM
</B>
<P><B>OPENED BY ITSELF ON THE FIRST NIGHT. GRANDPA TOLD ME IT WAS BECAUSE
THE </B>
<P><B>HOUSE WAS SETTLING, SO THE NEXT NIGHT I LOCKED IT AND IN THE MORNING
IT WAS </B>
<P><B>OPEN.&amp;nbsp; I TOO SAW AND HEARD THE SUBTLE THINGS MY MOTHER AND
EVENTUALLY MY </B>
<P><B>GRANDMOTHER WOULD LATER CONFESS TO. I WOULD SEE SOMEONE WALKING TO
THE </B>
<P><B>BACK DOOR, AND HEAR A FAINT KNOCK, BUT NO ONE WOULD BE </B>
<P><B>THERE.ONE SUMMER NIGHT, WHILE I SLEPT UPSTAIRS IN MY UNCLE'S OLD </B>
<P><B>ROOM I FELT SOMEONE STARING AT ME. AFRAID TO OPEN MY EYES, I TURNED
</B>
<P><B>MY BACK AND COVERED MY HEAD. LATER I AWOKE TO THE ROUTINE FOOTSTEPS
</B>
<P><B>COMING UP THE STAIRS, BUT THIS TIME, I WAS NOT AFRAID. I GOT UP </B>
<P><B>OUT OF BED AND OPENED THE DOOR AND FELT THE COLDEST CHILL I HAVE EVER
</B>
<P><B>FELT IN MY LIFE. I SAID "PLEASE LET ME SLEEP" ALOUD AND I WAS NEVER
</B>
<P><B>AWAKENED AGAIN.AS I BEGAN TO TELL MY MOTHER WHAT I </B>
<P><B>WAS EXPERIENCING, SHE BEGAN TO TELL ME SIMILAR STORIES. SHE SAID THAT
</B>
<P><B>SHE TOO HAD FELT SOMEONE STARING AT HER AT NIGHT. SHE ALSO TOLD ME
</B>
<P><B>OF THE WISH BOX SHE KEPTIN THE BOTTOM DRAWER OF HER DRESSER </B>
<P><B>THAT JUST VANISHED ONE DAY. SHE SAID SHE NEVER GOT THAT BOX OUT </B>
<P><B>UNLESS SHE WAS ADDING SOMETHING TO IT. AFTER SEVERAL WEEKS SHE </B>
<P><B>FINALLY GOT MAD AND SHOUTED OUT LOUD TO RETURN HER BOX. WITHIN THE
NEXT </B>
<P><B>COUPLE OF DAYS, IT WAS BACK INTHE BOTTOM DRAWER.</B>
<P><B>ITHINK THAT THE HOUSE IN SPRINGVILLE HAS MANY SPIRITS </B>
<P><B>THERE. MY CLOSE FRIENDS HAVE TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE ALWAYS </B>
<P><B>UNCOMFORTABLE STAYING THE NIGHT, BUT DIDN'T KNOW WHY. I HAVE SENSED
</B>
<P><B>BOTH GOOD AND BAD THERE. I MISS THE HOUSE, EVEN THOUGH IT SCARED ME
</B>
<P><B>VERY MUCH. MY UNCLE ENDED UP BUYING THEHOUSE FROM MY </B>
<P><B>GRANDPARENTS. HE SOLD IT TWO YEARS AGO. MY MOTHER AND I PASSED IT </B>
<P><B>NOT LONG AGO AND I SAID SOMETHING TO HER ABOUT MISSING THE HOUSE AND
SHE SAID </B>
<P><B>SHE COULDN'T EVEN LOOK AT IT BECAUSE IT BROUGHT TO MUCH BACK. I </B>
<P><B>WANT TO GO BACK AND ASK THE CURRENT RESIDENTS IF THEY HAVE SEEN OR
HEARD </B>
<P><B>ANYTHING. IM CURIOUS TO KNOW IF THE ROOM AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS </B>
<P><B>BELONGS TO ANYONE.</B>
