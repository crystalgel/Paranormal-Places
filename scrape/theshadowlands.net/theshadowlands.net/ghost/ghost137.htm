<b><font size=+1>AM I FOLLOWE</font>D</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cdtadmin@cdtc.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>As I was reading your website I was recalling my own "happenings".
None</b>
<br><b>were ever harmful to me but I do sleep with the light on most of
the</b>
<br><b>time. I believe I have a following - whether it be the same "ghost"
or</b>
<br><b>if I have some attraction for them.</b><b></b>
<p><b>It started when I was about 4 years old. I had this imaginary friend.
I</b>
<br><b>named him Jingles. From what I am told (I do not recall any part
of</b>
<br><b>Jingles other than what I was told by my family), I made my friend</b>
<br><b>Jingles so believable that everyone in my family actually started
to</b>
<br><b>believe there really was someone named Jingles. I would talk to
him,</b>
<br><b>play with him, and of course if anything was broken or stolen Jingles</b>
<br><b>did it. If I was good and got a treat Jingles had to get one too.</b>
<br><b>Jingles remanded by friend until I reached first grade and moved
to a</b>
<br><b>new home.</b><b></b>
<p><b>While in the kitchen with my sisters and mother a man's voice from
the</b>
<br><b>woods called my name. I was about 8 years old then. We all froze
with</b>
<br><b>our mouths dropped to the floor and our hearts racing. All four
of us</b>
<br><b>could not have imaged that someone called my name. I was young so
my</b>
<br><b>mother made a joke about and it was "forgotten". Throughout my childhood</b>
<br><b>strange things happened in this house -- images were seen out of
the</b>
<br><b>corner of mine (and my familes) eyes but we would just chalk it
up to</b>
<br><b>our imaginations, certain toys would flip in the air. Stuff like
that. I</b>
<br><b>was scared for the moment but never afraid to be in the house. Over
the</b>
<br><b>years we have found what I believe to be cow skulls in the backyard
(2</b>
<br><b>were found) but no one on the street has any cows. We don't know
where</b>
<br><b>they came from.</b><b></b>
<p><b>This house that I lived in as a child eventually became my home.
My</b>
<br><b>sister lived in the in-law apartment below me. She would always
ask me</b>
<br><b>what I was doing up there because she would always (even when I
wasn't</b>
<br><b>home) hear jumping and walking around. What makes this so strange
is</b>
<br><b>that once I moved out of the house the noises stopped.</b><b></b>
<p><b>After moving out of my parents house and into my own home about 9
months</b>
<br><b>ago there seems to be "extra" guests. I hear voices but can't make
out</b>
<br><b>what they are saying. I often hear a muzzled radio sound. I hear
running</b>
<br><b>water. The house is always making house noises. But around 4am /
5am the</b>
<br><b>noises stop and the house is "dead" silent. Often a cold breeze
will</b>
<br><b>find me even when there is no wind. I can't explain the feeling
that I'm</b>
<br><b>not alone. My children (9 years old and 8 years old) keep saying
they</b>
<br><b>want to move because they think the house is haunted. I don't think</b>
<br><b>moving is going to solve that problem!!</b><b></b>
<p><b>A little background on the house I now own...</b>
<br><b>It is 30 years old and a waterfront property. I found out that the
owner</b>
<br><b>of the home died of cancer (not in the house but has died). There
have</b>
<br><b>been 11 deaths around the lake and they have all died of the same</b>
<br><b>cancer.</b><b></b>
<p><b>AM I BEING FOLLOWED?&nbsp; If you any input as to these happenings
I would</b>
<br><b>invite your insight.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Thanks for your time.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Du Toits Kloof Pass</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cornell@sybaweb.co.za</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, my name is Cornell</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I'm a 21 year old from Cape Town South Africa.</b>
<br><b>As yet I have not seen anyone from my country send in any of there
supernatural experiences.&nbsp; I have to say that I find that quite strange,regarding
all the haunted places we have around here.&nbsp; I am not quite sure what
my experience was, but I can assure you that at that time it was absolutely
terrifying.</b>
<br><b>First I have to tell you a bit about the history of the place.&nbsp;
From what I have heard the mountain passes were built by Italian prisoners
of war (P.O.W) during the second World war- and allot of them died building
those passes.</b>
<br><b>There are hundreds of stories of people seeing phantom soldiers,
workmen and the additional hiker.&nbsp; I am sure that some of them could
have been real workmen because the roads are still being built onto.&nbsp;
The roads up there are very old and traitorously winding- and because of
that there have been many automobile accidents.</b>
<br><b>Now to get to what happened.. For the last three years of my School
career I went to Boarding school in a ,very small town, called Rawsonville.&nbsp;
Now I have to add that the area surrounding it is very mountainess, and
to get to the town which is situated in a valley, you have to either go
through the new tollgate tunnel or go over the mountain pass.&nbsp; I faille
to recollect the exact date on which it happened, but I do remember that
it was near the end of 1996.</b>
<br><b>At that time my parents where on holiday in Europe and my older
brother *by 5 years* drove to Rawsonville to&nbsp; fetch me.&nbsp; I had
a SRC function on that evening and he attended it with me but around 10:00
PM that evening, we were both getting a bit tired and decided to rather
get going&nbsp; for the 1 &amp; 1/2 hour drive home.</b>
<br><b>There are quite a few legends about the old mountain pass and that
evening I made a joke and asked my brother if he wanted to go check&nbsp;
out the ghosts at the old tunnel.&nbsp; He gave one of his evil scary laughs,
that he does whenever we talk about ghosts , and&nbsp; took the turn off&nbsp;
that leads up the mountain.</b>
<br><b>On our way up,&nbsp; I must confess&nbsp; that I was a bit nervous-
but then again, I get nervous whenever someone even hints at anything remotely
scary..lol .&nbsp; Every thing went fine and as we went through the tunnel
my brother pressed the car hooter three times, as everyone does *I dont
really know why you have to do it, but its sortof a tradition amongst the
people in that area.*&nbsp; After about 5-10 minutes he kept on&nbsp; glancing
in his rear view mirror, and then he would nod, or smile... I thought this
very strange and asked him what he was doing.. He</b>
<br><b>looked at me with a totally straight face, and said that we have
a young women in the back seet and he was just chatting to her.&nbsp; Ofcourse
I immediately turned around and saw absolutely nothing.....I looked at
him and told him to stop scaring me ... and that it was not funny.... he
held by his story and said he's not trying to scare me, but that there
is truly a girl in the car, and he asked me if I could not see her.&nbsp;
Now, I'm the youngest of three children and the only girl, and have always
had a wonderful relationship with my brothers.&nbsp; I would have known
if he was lying.&nbsp; Me, scared quite stiff, and not even able to breath
properly just sat there praying that, it/she, would not</b>
<br><b>appear to me.&nbsp; Finally after about 15min. and a whole lot more
nods &amp; smiles , my brother told me that he had to stop to relieve himself
*mother nature*.&nbsp; I can still remember the exact location he stopped
at -&nbsp; it was on the left side of the road with a white stone half
verandalike entrance to a farm or some place.&nbsp; It had been raining
the whole week and the ground was very muddy and smelled moldy.&nbsp; I
debated over getting out with him but I thought that he would not be very
impressed with me if I accompanied him on his "errand".&nbsp; So I gathered
all the *guts* that I could muster and sat all&nbsp; "alone" in the car.&nbsp;
I remember it being very cold... I could see my breath as I</b>
<br><b>breathed out.&nbsp; But it might have only been because of the weather
in that area.&nbsp; Nothing much happened in the time my brother was away,
for&nbsp; one exeption..... there was the distinct sound of someone breathing...
and no, not me.... I made a point of holding my breath... and I could still
hear it....I sat there waiting for my brother for atleast 10min that seemed
like 10 hours, so afraid that I could not even get up the nerve to uncross&nbsp;
my leg that was aching like crazy.&nbsp; He got back in the car and did
not say allot after that, he just asked me when we had picked up the man
in the Kakuei clothes.&nbsp; I decided to not say or ask anything anymore...
things were just getting to weird for me.&nbsp; As we got off the intersection
that goes on to the Paarl Road... * as you get off the mountain pass*&nbsp;
my brother suddenly started driving faster and faster.... I told him to
slow down.. and he looked at me with this confused expression on his face,and
said that he's not speeding... that he's been driving100 km\hour the whole
time because thats the speed limit in the new tunnel.&nbsp;&nbsp; At that
point I started crying and told him that we did not go through the new
tunnel but over the pass, and through the old tunnel...He smiled at me
and said *No, I distinctly remember us stopping in front of the new tunnel
picking up a young girl, driving through the new tunnel,and dropping the
girl after the toll gate.</b>
<br><b>Things were just getting so confusing an weirder by the minute...
I told him that it was impossible... I know for a fact that we drove over
the mountain.... and I related my whole experience to him..... He would
not Believe me!!!!!&nbsp; Then to prove to him that I was telling the truth
I told him to have a look at his boots and at the floor by his feet....
and, if there was mud- what I was telling him, is the truth....Now, he
found mud on his boots alright and on the carpet by his feet... But for
the past 3 years he's still keeping by his side of the story.</b>
<br><b>How do you explain that.... two people, 1 car, two dramatically
different stories???????????</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>My Grandfather Watches Us!</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ebgolden@eden.rutgers.edu</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past few months
I had two experiences with ghosts. This</b>
<br><b>past New Year's Eve my grandfather died after a short illness.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>family stayed over my grandparents house the night before he died,
and I</b>
<br><b>slept in an upstaris bedroom.&nbsp; I couldn't really sleep for
too long and</b>
<br><b>at one point, as I lay in bed, with my eyes slightly open, I began
to</b>
<br><b>see some sort of figure near my bed.&nbsp; I began to see what looked
like a</b>
<br><b>face, and ran out of the room into the hallway. As I walked down
the</b>
<br><b>hallway, I was pushed by a burst of energy two times, and walked
at a</b>
<br><b>greater speed than I myself meant to.&nbsp; I can't really decribe
it, just</b>
<br><b>that whatever it was actually passed through me two times.&nbsp;
The second</b>
<br><b>shove left me in from of my grandfather's bedroom.&nbsp; I couldn't</b>
<br><b>understand why since my grandfather had been moved to the downstairs</b>
<br><b>living room and no one was supposed to be in his room.&nbsp; However,
an aunt</b>
<br><b>of mine was lying on the bedroom floor, passed out, after getting
too</b>
<br><b>upset when entering his room, which no one in my family knew at
this</b>
<br><b>point. Shortly after, my grandfather died.&nbsp; My family feels
that even</b>
<br><b>though at this point he was still alive, his spirit had already
left his</b>
<br><b>body and directed me to check up on my aunt.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After his death, I tried to put it out of my mind for</b>
<br><b>awhile.&nbsp; However, at the beginning of March, my mother and
I visited my</b>
<br><b>grandmother and she asked me to carry up some boxes to store in
my</b>
<br><b>grandfather's room.&nbsp; As soon as I entered the room I started
thinking</b>
<br><b>about the whole situation with his death and could not stop crying.&nbsp;
It</b>
<br><b>was the first time that it had really sunk in that he was gone,
and that</b>
<br><b>I will never see him again.&nbsp; Three days later, I went back
to college,</b>
<br><b>and about 1:30 A.M., after my roomate had gone to sleep, I with</b>
<br><b>headphones began listening to a c.d. of mine. I began thinking about
my</b>
<br><b>grandfather again, and soon, the doorknob to the dorm room began
to</b>
<br><b>shake and I could hear someone fumbling around with it for awhile.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>windows were open but there was no wind coming through.&nbsp; I
went up to</b>
<br><b>the door figuring that it was someone on the floor stopping by.&nbsp;
Then,</b>
<br><b>the doorknob slowly turned and the door opened......and nobody was</b>
<br><b>there, but I could feel a presence.&nbsp; I believe that this was
my</b>
<br><b>granfather letting me know that although he has passed on, he is
still</b>
<br><b>watching over us.</b><b></b>

<br><b><font size=+1>Signalbox in England</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: a.a.davidson@talk21.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Over 30 years ago I was a signalman in a quiet country box on the
now closed Waverley route.&nbsp; I operated a level Xing over a back road
some 3/4 of a mile from the main road.</b>
<br><b>On a November Saturday back shift,&nbsp; around 18.00hrsm&nbsp;
because it was rather war I sat with some of the windows open.&nbsp; I
had left my gates blocking the roadway waiting for a train leaving Carlisle
six miles away.&nbsp; not many cars used the Xing at weekends so I was
surprised to hear a sound from otside and down on the road.</b>
<br><b>I went to the window and looked out,&nbsp; there was nothing to
see so I made to turn away,&nbsp; At which point a voice called "Can I
come across?"Looking back out I could see a person standing beside the
wicket gates,&nbsp; I called back "Yes" and made to unlock the small gates.&nbsp;
I returned to the window and a girl had crossed the track and as standing
at the fence below me.She was dressed in light coloured,&nbsp; I guessed
at Tan,&nbsp; clothes her hair was fair but her face was hidden in the
shadow cast by the box eaves.&nbsp; We talked. she told me she had come
of a bus and was heading for a certain house where she was staying,As we
talked snow began to fall,&nbsp; I asked her to come up to the fire she
refused as she refused to step closer to the fence.&nbsp; A bell rang behind
me,&nbsp; I turned away and turned back and she was gone.The road ran away
straight for a good&nbsp; 1/2 mile,&nbsp; I hurried downstairs,&nbsp; kneeling
on the road I could look along the tarmac shiny and wet reflecting the
lights of a marshalling yard on the horizon. the road was empty.The following
week,&nbsp; early shift I made a point of stopping the people who lived
at the house mentioned,&nbsp; no one had been visiting.&nbsp; It hadalready
dawned on me that the bus she had mentioned no longer ran.I hope you find
this of interest,&nbsp; let me say that I worked at that box for sometime
after and loved every minute.&nbsp; Signal boxes are curiousplaces some
odd by their very locations,&nbsp; but all old and well used.</b><b></b>

<br><b><font size=+1>The Handprints</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; TAYAH-1@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello me and my boyfriend have had a couple of incidents at our</b>
<br><b>apartment leading us to believe there is something here aside from
us. I</b>
<br><b>first of all think that its strange that this is happenig as we
live in</b>
<br><b>an apartment complex. About 2 months ago we were in bed and watching
t.v</b>
<br><b>we heard a childs voice in the living room and this continued for</b>
<br><b>several weeks on several different occasions. It seemed to be as
if</b>
<br><b>calling out for someone.</b>
<br><b>Then about a month later is when&nbsp; the really strange part of
it took</b>
<br><b>place..noone had been here at all and the house was spotless and
we</b>
<br><b>noticed a small handprint on our bathroom mirror. it was in the
middle</b>
<br><b>of the mirror and had water sreakes running down from the top of
the</b>
<br><b>fingertips as if it had just been done minutes earlier. And then
this</b>
<br><b>very morning my boyfriend turned the shower on and went to the living</b>
<br><b>room to watch t.v until it warmed up ..he said he noticed in the
corner</b>
<br><b>of his eye the bathroom door move so he assumed I was in there ..so
he</b>
<br><b>waited a couple more minutes then went in to take his shower.As
soon as</b>
<br><b>he went in the bathroom he plainly noticed a Small handprint on
the</b>
<br><b>steamed up mirror and instantly ran in and woke me up to look at
it. I</b>
<br><b>went to look at it and I had chills it was obvious to me it had
just</b>
<br><b>been made(not to mention i had just cleaned that mirror 2 days ago)the</b>
<br><b>watersreakes were coming down from everywhere on the handprint this</b>
<br><b>time. The funny thing is that both incidents it was only one hand
and</b>
<br><b>only the right hand both times the prints were in&nbsp; almost the
same area</b>
<br><b>of the mirror. It seems to me its a childs size hand the first incident</b>
<br><b>the print was slanted the 2nd incident the print was perfectly straight.</b>
<br><b>We ourselves are skeptical about this but at the same time openminded
to</b>
<br><b>the fact that spirits do exsist. There are no childen ever here
in this</b>
<br><b>entire complex.And no other reasonable explantions, this is real.
If</b>
<br><b>anyone has any knowledge of these occurances please E-mail us as
soon as</b>
<br><b>possible. Once again we can not think of any other explanation.Thank
You</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>I Dreamt of My Son</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ladybug3228@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This may seem pretty benign compared to some of the</b>
<br><b>stories I read on the "prenatal hauntings" story</b>
<br><b>board, but here's my story:</b>
<br><b>I accidentally became pregnant in February 1999. I</b>
<br><b>didn't discover I was pregnant until I was about 8-9</b>
<br><b>weeks along. My husband and I had not yet planned on</b>
<br><b>having children, but we were so happy about the baby.</b>
<br><b>When I was about six months pregnant, I had a dream</b>
<br><b>the likes of which I've never had, and have never had</b>
<br><b>again. It was so real and vivid; I didn't even have to</b>
<br><b>write it down. I can remember every detail to this</b>
<br><b>day. My son was born in October 1999, so it wasn't</b>
<br><b>really all that long ago.</b>
<br><b>I dreamed I was sitting in the front yard of my</b>
<br><b>sister-in-law's new home. I had not yet been to or</b>
<br><b>even seen a photo of my sister-in-law's new home, but</b>
<br><b>upon visiting for the first time, after the dream, it</b>
<br><b>was exactly as it appeared in my dream, even down to</b>
<br><b>the potted plant she keeps on the porch.&nbsp; In my dream,</b>
<br><b>I was sitting in a folding green lawn chair, and was</b>
<br><b>watching my two nieces play in the front yard with</b>
<br><b>jump ropes. I was holding a baby boy, and he was</b>
<br><b>wrapped in light blue blankets. I had a section of the</b>
<br><b>blanket over his face to shield him from the sunlight.</b>
<br><b>I recall that he began making cooing noises, so I</b>
<br><b>brought him off my shoulder and lay him in my lap. I</b>
<br><b>uncovered his face and revealed the EXACT face that my</b>
<br><b>real-life son has today - I saw my son's face BEFORE</b>
<br><b>he was ever born; right down to the bright blue eyes.</b>
<br><b>My husband has brown eyes and I have blue eyes. It was</b>
<br><b>assumed our son would have brown eyes; they tend to be</b>
<br><b>dominant. However, he had bright blue eyes in my dream</b>
<br><b>- and he has bright blue eyes in real life.</b>
<br><b>My son cooed and babbled to me in my dream, and I</b>
<br><b>remember saying to him in my dream, "I'm so glad you</b>
<br><b>came to me; you're the best thing that's ever happened</b>
<br><b>to me."</b>
<br><b>I said that exact same phrase the day he was born and</b>
<br><b>had the strangest feeling of deja vu - I realized it</b>
<br><b>was exactly what I'd said in my dream. Do you think</b>
<br><b>this is a form of haunting? I saw exactly what my son</b>
<br><b>would look like as a baby before he was born. Of</b>
<br><b>course, seeing as how it's a dream, and I'm the only</b>
<br><b>one who saw it, that could be debatable. But I was</b>
<br><b>incredibly shocked when I saw him in real-life for the</b>
<br><b>first time, right after he was born, because he was</b>
<br><b>exactly as he appeared in my dream - almost three</b>
<br><b>months before his birth.</b>

<p><b>Hi, my name is Andrew and I live in New Zealand.</b>
<br><b>I have had something happen to me that I think may be supernatural.</b>
<br><b>At around 11pm-1am, my friend and I were talking (he was sleeping
over at my</b>
<br><b>house) and suddenly I became very cold and It seemed something outside
was</b>
<br><b>glowing very strongly (although the curtains were drawn and I was
Too scared</b>
<br><b>to even move).&nbsp; It was a full moon and there were clouds which
I had seen</b>
<br><b>earlier. In the morning I asked my family if anything had happened
but they</b>
<br><b>hadn't (even my brother who's room was right beside mine and our
windows are</b>
<br><b>facing the same direction. I didn't hear anything outside during
or after</b>
<br><b>the light and The moon couldn't have shone that bright. This light

<p><b>Last week my dog, Tramp, started shaking violently, and panting and

<p><b>&nbsp;My whole family on both sides, have always been known to be

<br><b><font size=+1>THE HAUNTED CABIN!</font></b>

<p><b>By: Freaky7985@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>A FEW YEARS AGO ABOUT 1995, I WENT TO A CHRISTIAN SUMMER CAMP IN
BIG BEAR IT</b>
<br><b>WAS CALLED CAMP CEDER CREST. THE GIRLS IN MY CHURCH YOUTH GROUP
WERE STAYING</b>
<br><b>IN THE CABIN ALL THE WAY IN THE BACK HALF OF THE CAMP RIGHT ON THE</b>
<br><b>BOUNDERIES. I HAD HEARD RUMORS THAT THE CABIN WAS HAUNTED BUT I
FIGURED THAT</b>
<br><b>THE PEOPLE TELLING ME THESE RUMORS WERE JUST TRYING TO SCARE ME.
BUT AFTER</b>
<br><b>STAYING IN THE CABIN THE FIRST NIGHT I HAD BEGAN TO BELIEVE THE
RUMORS,</b>
<br><b>BECAUSE BRUSHES THAT BELONGED TO SOME OF THE GIRLS WOULD SOME HOW
FLY ACROSS</b>
<br><b>THE ROOM AS IF THEY HAD BEEN THROWN, BUT NO ONE THREW THEM, ALSO
THE BEDS AT</b>
<br><b>NIGHT WOULD SHAKE VIGORISLY AND I WAS UN ABLE TO EXPLAIN THIS TO
MYSELF AND</b>
<br><b>COME UP WITH A RATIONAL EXPLAINATION AND NO ONE ELSE WANTED TO BELIEVE
THAT</b>
<br><b>THE CABIN WAS HAUNTED. THEN WHEN WE LEFT I SWORE I WOULD NEVER SET
FOOT IN</b>
<br><b>THAT CABIN AGAIN, BUT I WANTED TO KNOW IF IT WAS HAUNTED SO TWO
YEARS LATER I</b>
<br><b>WENT AGAIN WITH MY CHURCH AND A FEW OF THE GIRLS AND I WENT BACK
TO THE PLACE</b>
<br><b>WHERE THE CABIN SHOULS HAVE BEEN TO SEE IF IT WAS BOARDED UP OR
SOMETHING TO</b>
<br><b>SHOW US THAT IT WAS DANGEROUS OR HAUNTED OR SOMETHING, BUT THE CABIN
WAS TORN</b>
<br><b>DOWN, THERE WERE TWO MEN WORKING ON THE CABIN WITH YELLOW POLICE

<br><b>SURROUNDING THE CABIN AND THE HILL IT SAT ON, THE CABIN WAS ALREADY

<p><b><font size=+1>My Visit to the Whaley House</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: AshenForest1734@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>in november of 1997 my wife and i went to the whaley house for fun.
she told</b>
<br><b>me how the house was supposed to be haunted but i thought she was
just</b>
<br><b>fooling with me to get a reaction. when we entered the house the
care taker</b>
<br><b>told us a little about the house and i asked her if the house was
really</b>
<br><b>haunted or if it was a bunch of b.s. . she told me that strange
things did in</b>
<br><b>fact happen and then again i thought it was just a bunch of hooie.
well i can</b>
<br><b>actually say that house is weird. as i walked through the house
i had it in</b>
<br><b>my head that nothing ever happened and everyone made up stories
about this</b>
<br><b>particular house. here`s the good part, as i came to the study of
old man</b>
<br><b>whaley i started to smell smoke. i thought it was kinda weird but
then</b>
<br><b>thought that someone outside was smoking. then the smell got so
intense that</b>
<br><b>i almost started to cough. i turned to my wife and asked her if
she smelled</b>
<br><b>it and she respondede yes and that it was strong. i decided to go
on and see</b>
<br><b>what else was in the house. the cigar smell followed me and then
at that time</b>
<br><b>the care taker said to me that mr. whaley didnt like me. i said
to her that</b>
<br><b>the cigar smell was just tremendous and i couldnt take it. she tole
me " i</b>
<br><b>dont know why but for whatever reason he don`t like you ". i could
hear</b>
<br><b>people upstairs and decided i`d go and ask them if they smelled
the smoke. i</b>
<br><b>started to go upstairs and when i got half way up the stairs i got
this</b>
<br><b>outrageous chill that ran through my whole body. as i got all the
way</b>
<br><b>upstairs there was nobody there. i also noticed that the foot steps
had</b>
<br><b>stopped too. i went back down stairs and told my wife that there
was nobody</b>
<br><b>up there and as i told her we could hear the foot steps start up
again and i</b>
<br><b>went back up and to my suprise there was nobody there but the rocking
chair</b>
<br><b>was barley rocking and stopped. thats when i thought that this was
a little</b>
<br><b>too weird and went back down stairs and told my wife what i saw
and she</b>
<br><b>thought i was lying. as we toured the rest of the house there nobody
there</b>
<br><b>except the care taker and as we were ready to leave i told the care
taker</b>
<br><b>what had happened and she told my wife and i that , that was pretty
common</b>
<br><b>and she wasn`t pulling my leg. i can tell whoever who wants to get
the</b>
<br><b>feeling that were not alone in this world that, the whaley house
is for real.</b>
<br><b>i was skeptical and im more of a beliver now.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Wayside Inn</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; CBEIGHEY@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>More information about theWAYSIDE INN in Middletown, VA</b><b></b>
<p><b>Frequently, on our way to PA from FL, we stay at the WAYSIDE INN
in Middletown, VA.&nbsp; Always a pleasant stay...until our last visit.&nbsp;
We stopped impromptu without reservations and they were filled, except
for Rm 14, which they hesitate to rent because it is suppose to be the
'haunted room'.&nbsp; When they tell guests, few will stay in it.&nbsp;
My husband and I are not 'die hard ghost believers' and we said we would
stay in Rm 14, as we loved staying at the inn.&nbsp; All went well until
about 2:20 AM.&nbsp; I was reading in the sitting area, unable to sleep,
when I heard pounding...very rhythm-like pounding...loud, lasting about
15 minutes before I heard someone downstairs, in the lobby, hollering and
banging, also.&nbsp; It sounded like someone was pounding a nail in the
wall, which was odd at this hour, with an inn full of guests sleeping.&nbsp;
The pounding stopped for about one half hour.I dozed off.&nbsp; The pounding
started, waking me.&nbsp; I got up and heard more hollering and banging
downstairs.&nbsp; Then the pounding stopped.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>happened off and on, at longer intervals, throughout the night.&nbsp;
I couldn't imagine why all this noise would be allowed to go on at this
hour and almost called the desk to find out if the night clerk was all
right, but it was late and I hated to ring the phone.&nbsp; The noise stopped.&nbsp;
I slept fitfully, awaking on and off to thumping downstairs.</b>
<br><b>In the morning, the clerk asked me if we had anything unusual to
report about our stay in Rm 14.&nbsp; I said no...not really, only that
the pounding I heard was strange at that hour of the night and that someone
was hollering downstairs.&nbsp; She said the hollering and pounding downstairs
was her banging on the door to tell the ghost in the celler to stop chopping
with his cleaver on the chopping block.&nbsp; She said he is a ghost at
the inn who used to cut meat or etc....that this happens frequently.&nbsp;
When he is noisy, she has to bang on the celler door</b>
<br><b>and tells him to quiet down, that he is waking the guests.&nbsp;
Usually this quiets him, that some nights he's noisier than others.&nbsp;
Also, a waitress told me about one of the girls seeing a lady in a lavender
gown walking through the dining room.&nbsp; The clerk told me a guest who
was using Rm 14 went to her car and on the way back in, looked up in her
window, and saw a woman in a lavender gown looking out.&nbsp; The guest
left.</b>
<br><b>Guests in Rm 14 were reported to see a soldier in a uniform and
a lady in lavender embracing in the window, when guests were in the room.&nbsp;
We used to stay there frequently on our way back and forth from FL to Pa.&nbsp;
After our experience in Rm 14, I am not anxious to return.&nbsp; The cleaver
chopping, in the celler under our room (our room was on the back stairway
leading to the cellar) disturbed me.&nbsp; I did not like the experience,
although the other stays, in other rooms were perfectly normal and very
enjoyable.&nbsp; It is a gracious inn, with a good dining</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; The bar hasn't since before Lincoln's time.&nbsp; It
has an interesting past. What I have told you is only a few of the sightings.&nbsp;
My information came from people who work at the WAYSIDE INN and from my
own experience.</b><b></b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Hell Dogs of Eldorado Canyon</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; ryanacevedd@webtv.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Eldorado Canyon on the Colorado River just above Hoover Dam. This
was once the site of an early twentieth century mining town. legend has
it that many miners would keep dogs at their claims for protection and
also as a reliable food source in extreme times of need. These dogs were
more often then not brutally</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;reared so as to not tolerate even the slightest trespass by
a stranger. When the mines finally ran dry and minors moved on to other
workable areas,many of these dogs were either shot on site,simply left
behind still chained as they were,and for the lucky ones released to fend
for themselves. For many years since people have come out of this canyon
with tales of sightings and in a very few instances terrifying accounts
of actually being attacked or chased by these alleged ghost dogs while
exploring various different mining or town sites</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;in the area. Curious as to the validity of such tales my brother
and I made the decision to do a little exploring of our own. On the first
few excursions we found nothing as was expected. However on the last adventure
we stumbled onto what we thought was just another anonomous shaft site.
As we looked closer at the site we noticed about an eight foot severely
weathered chain embedded into the rock wall at the entrance to the shaft.
Well, curiousity</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;got the best of the both of us and foolishly we entered the
shaft. There we came upon the bones of what appeared to be those of a large
dog.&nbsp;&nbsp; We decided to camp here as the day was coming slowly to
its end. A decision that later we would come to regret. The still desert
night closed in as we had dinner and relaxed around our small campfire.
we heard what we assumed were coyotes yipping and calling off in the distance.
The atmosphere became thick and very uneasy. We now felt that we were being
watched from a very close distance. What we thought was the night time
breeze now sounded more like the panting or breathing of large dogs in
close proximity. Then we heard the growling. Grating,low......and hatefull.
The fall of paws on the desert sand now became apparent. They seemed to
circle the campsite. We were surrounded. That's when the scratching started.
It came from the area were the chain layed. That damn chain moved! It seemed
to tug away from the rock wall,pulling harder and harder each time! We
fumbled for our gear and and stumbled to our feet. My brother shown the
flashlight at the chain. There were scratch marks in the rock! There were
what appeared to be blood stains on the wall seemingly were the</b>
<br><b>unfortunate dog furiously clawed at the chain's base in the rock
itself! The chain dropped...something brushed against my leg and I struggled
to keep my balance. My brother caught me and we ran like hell towards the
car! The fall of canine foot steps and wild panting chased us all the way!
I've never run faster in my life! On the road heading out of the canyon
we were paced for a good two or three miles at least by what seemed to
be a pack of wild strays! We made it home and I will never forget the terror
of being chased by this pack of</b>
<br><b>spectral hounds...NEVER! Locals refer to them simply as The Hell
Dogs of Eldorado Canyon.</b><b></b>
