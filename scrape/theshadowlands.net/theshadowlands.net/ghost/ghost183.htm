<br><b>My Guest</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Hlmrjmx6@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; I have had many experiences,</b>
<br><b>in my life, but more now than ever. My husband and my son of six,
who was 4</b>
<br><b>when he first came to me with a problem he was having in his room.&nbsp;
I will</b>
<br><b>start off by&nbsp; telling you that someone is following me almost
every day. It</b>
<br><b>seems to be right over my left shoulder, never the right, always
the left.</b>
<br><b>Some days I feel intimidated by it, other days it really doesn't
bother me,</b>
<br><b>other than the fact I know it is there. My husband and I have both
witnessed</b>
<br><b>things move, and lift from places. My son has had several conversations
with</b>
<br><b>my father, who has been deceased since&nbsp; 88. My son went as
far as to tell me</b>
<br><b>what the curtain man who wanted to play with his toys was wearing.&nbsp;
Now keep</b>
<br><b>in mind, my son was only 4 at the time this occurred, and has no
way of even</b>
<br><b>knowing what my father looked like, or was wearing when we buried
him, but</b>
<br><b>yet he described his yellow shirt and black pants without hesitation.
I am</b>
<br><b>concerned. I have a few close relatives that have passed, some that
were not</b>
<br><b>ready, some that had no choice.&nbsp; I also get bad feeling of
fear from</b>
<br><b>something that is with us. I have gone to the point of asking it
to leave.</b>
<br><b>The house hold vibes will clear for a few days, and then it all
seems to</b>
<br><b>resume without problem.</b>

<p><b>My Great Grandparents House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:EngelT@sosmail.state.mi.us</b><b></b>
<p><b>I've never told anyone about this, but I wanted to share this with
others</b>
<br><b>with similar experiences.</b>
<br><b>From the age of about 10 to the age of 13 I lived in my great-grandparents</b>
<br><b>house in Saginaw, MI with my parents.&nbsp; My Omah and Opah died
long before I</b>
<br><b>was born and my grandfather was not a sentimental man so I did not
know much</b>
<br><b>about them.&nbsp; They died when my father was still quite young.&nbsp;
From the</b>
<br><b>moment I set foot in that house, I could tell there was something
there.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>was actually a warm feeling.&nbsp; Before we had moved in there,
my parents had</b>
<br><b>been fighting constantly, but while we were in this house, I don't
remember</b>
<br><b>one argument.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, there were areas of the house that I did not like.&nbsp;
The master</b>
<br><b>bedroom was beautiful with ornately carved woodwork and a long closet
that</b>
<br><b>connected it to the bedroom next door.&nbsp; The appearance of the
room was</b>
<br><b>inviting and although this room was beautiful, I didn't like being
in it</b>
<br><b>alone.&nbsp; All year round it was approximately 20 degrees colder
that the rest</b>
<br><b>of the house.&nbsp; We had the radiators checked and they were working
fine, but</b>
<br><b>once you took a step away from the radiator it was almost as if
you were</b>
<br><b>stepping outside.&nbsp; I later found out that it had been my Omah
and Opah's</b>
<br><b>room and that my Opah died in there.</b>
<br><b>Besides the master bedroom, there were 2 more bedrooms downstairs
and an</b>
<br><b>apartment with 2 more bedrooms upstairs.&nbsp; When my grandfather
was growing up</b>
<br><b>there, he and his brothers had there run of the apartment.&nbsp;
During the time</b>
<br><b>we lived there, every night about 8:00 PM, you could hear two sets
of</b>
<br><b>footsteps walking up the stairs and from room to room in the apartment.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>parents tried to tell me it was the house settling, but I knew it
Omah and</b>
<br><b>Opah walking upstairs to say goodnight to the kids.</b>
<br><b>I always felt their presence in the house.&nbsp; It was as if I
was getting to</b>
<br><b>know them 20-plus years after their passing.&nbsp; The bed I slept
in had been</b>
<br><b>theirs and some of the furniture in the living room was theirs also.&nbsp;
One</b>
<br><b>article was my Opah's chair.&nbsp; It was an oak easy chair with
large olive</b>
<br><b>green textured cushions (my mother still has it).&nbsp; On several
occasions I</b>
<br><b>would wake up in the middle of the night to find the chair rocking.&nbsp;
There</b>
<br><b>was no explanation for this, we did not have any pets that could
have</b>
<br><b>started it rocking and when it happened, it rocked steadily for
several</b>
<br><b>minutes and the room would fill with the sent of Cherry Vanilla
pipe</b>
<br><b>tobacco.&nbsp; When the chair stopped rocking, the sent would fade
rather quickly</b>
<br><b>and everything would return to normal.&nbsp; While we were there,
my parents</b>
<br><b>would say it was a dream or my imagination, but a few years after
we moved,</b>
<br><b>they both admitted to experiencing some of the things I had.</b>
<br><b>Most of the experiences were pleasant.&nbsp; The first few months
we were there,</b>
<br><b>I slept in my Omah and Opah's bed in the small room off of the living
room.</b>
<br><b>The room had such an inviting feel to it.&nbsp; I always had friends
wanting to</b>
<br><b>spend the night.&nbsp; I found out that this room had been used
as the nursery</b>
<br><b>and playroom when the children were younger.&nbsp; I believe that
had something</b>
<br><b>to do with the feeling.</b>
<br><b>My parents then decided to move me to the larger room off of the
dining</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; There was a large cherry wood wardrobe built into the
wall.&nbsp; It had 4</b>
<br><b>doors and 4 drawers.&nbsp; The smaller doors on the top were jammed
shut and we</b>
<br><b>couldn't get them open at all.&nbsp; Just about every time I walked
into that</b>
<br><b>room the hair on the back of my neck would stand on end and I felt
as if I</b>
<br><b>was not wanted there.&nbsp; I could still feel Omah and Opah, but
their energy</b>
<br><b>wasn't as strong in that room.&nbsp; Shortly after I moved in there,
terrible</b>
<br><b>things began happening in the house.&nbsp; One night I was jolted
awake by a loud</b>
<br><b>repeated banging.&nbsp; When I sat up and looked around, the 2 smaller
doors on</b>
<br><b>the wardrobe were violently banging open and shut.&nbsp; My father
rushed in the</b>
<br><b>room and asked me what was happening, but the banging had stopped
just as he</b>
<br><b>had reached the door.&nbsp; When I told my father what had happened,
he turned on</b>
<br><b>the light and tried to open the doors, but they jammed shut again.&nbsp;
I slept</b>
<br><b>on the couch for the next few nights.</b>
<br><b>Bad things continued to happen to me.&nbsp; I was awakened by slaps
by invisible</b>
<br><b>hands.&nbsp; Occasionally something would jump on the bed.&nbsp;
I would wake up with</b>
<br><b>small welts and bruises without an explanation of how they got there.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>parents continued to ignore these goings on until one night.&nbsp;
It was an</b>
<br><b>incredibly humid summer that year.&nbsp; We had placed a fan on
top of the</b>
<br><b>dishwasher in the kitchen to try to circulate the air throughout
the house.</b>
<br><b>You had to walk past the dishwasher to get the bathroom.&nbsp; I
was passing by</b>
<br><b>to the bathroom to prepare for bed when I heard a kind of scuttling
noise</b>
<br><b>(that's the only way I can describe it).&nbsp; I turned around and
at that moment</b>
<br><b>the fan leaped off of the dishwasher and flew towards me.&nbsp;
I stumbled back</b>
<br><b>just as the fan crashed to the floor where I had just been standing.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>parents came running in and by the looks on their faces I could
tell they</b>
<br><b>finally knew something was after me.&nbsp; I stayed at my aunt and
uncle's for a</b>
<br><b>few weeks until my parents had found another place for us to live.</b>
<br><b>I only went back to the house once after that.&nbsp; It was to move
my stuff out</b>
<br><b>of the house.&nbsp; When we were leaving the house seemed to feel
"dead"; the</b>
<br><b>energy, both positive and negative, seemed to be gone.&nbsp; It
was as if they</b>
<br><b>finally cancelled each other out and just left a feeling of void.</b>
<br><b>I found out later from my grandfather that he had had another sister,
Josie.</b>
<br><b>She died of a prolonged illness in her early teens.&nbsp; Her room
had been the</b>
<br><b>one off of the dining room.&nbsp; Before she became ill, she felt
she had to</b>
<br><b>compete with her siblings for attention from her parents.&nbsp;
She sometimes did</b>
<br><b>cruel things to my grandfather and his other siblings.&nbsp; I think
that maybe</b>
<br><b>she was still there and felt that she had to compete with me.&nbsp;
I think that</b>
<br><b>she may have been jealous that Omah and Opah were paying attention
to me.</b>
<br><b>I've shared this theory with my parents since.&nbsp; They seem to
think it too.</b>

<br><b>My Grandparents House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: AmmoDog01@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>My grandparents house is very much haunted. I spent most of my childhood</b>
<br><b>there.</b>
<br><b>My grandparents have experienced hauntings since the house before
this one.</b>
<br><b>My grandmother would straighten up after my grandfather, and in
the morning</b>
<br><b>his suit coat was always draped over the same dinning room chair.
Also, when</b>
<br><b>my grandmother would try to pull the chairs out to clean, it was
as if</b>
<br><b>something was pulling on them from under the table.</b>
<br><b>In the house they live in now, it all started when I was about 3
or 4. I was</b>
<br><b>sitting at a little toy piano. I turned around and I saw a large
man shaped</b>
<br><b>shadow. There was no one else in the basement. It disappeared after
I</b>
<br><b>screamed.</b>
<br><b>My brother was in the basement when he was about 4 or 5. The hanging
tapestry</b>
<br><b>on the wall turned into a demon/freddy cruggar shape and reached
out of the</b>
<br><b>picture for him. Cross my Heart!!! And when he was playing in the
same room,</b>
<br><b>his truck flew off the pinball machine across the room from him.
He was a</b>
<br><b>little freaked out.</b>
<br><b>We then moved away with my mom, but would come and visit often.
We slept in</b>
<br><b>the same room and I would see the same shadow man watching me when
he slept.</b>
<br><b>He was right outside the door.</b>
<br><b>Later on, we moved back in with my grandparents. This is when it
got really</b>
<br><b>bad. I started having really bad nightmares. The cold water turned
on while I</b>
<br><b>was in the shower. I heard footsteps pacing around my room at night.
I heard</b>
<br><b>my name whispered when I was trying to sleep. i saw things out of
the corner</b>
<br><b>of my eye. I heard the kitchen chairs being draged across the floor
while I</b>
<br><b>was in the basement. Then there was the really scary night. I was
woken from</b>
<br><b>a dead sleep ans sat up straight in bed. A voice pounded in my head,
telling</b>
<br><b>me to get out. I ran all the way to the back door and stopped myself.</b>
<br><b>Needless to say, I did not sleep the rest of the night. Some time
later, I</b>
<br><b>was alone, ironing in the house. I felt something touch my back.
I swung</b>
<br><b>around and almost burned my self with an iron. That is when I rekized
it was</b>
<br><b>a little boy in a white night gown. He was murdered there. He was
stabed in</b>
<br><b>the back.</b>
<br><b>He has followed me ever since, though the killers spirit keepd his
distance</b>
<br><b>now. i have heard a voice, gottne visions and heard laughter since
then. I</b>
<br><b>enjoy his presence now that I understand him.</b>

<p><b>My Grandpa Was In That Photo</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: hitgirl4@juno.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;A while back I went to visit my grandmother with my father
to see how</b>
<br><b>she had been doing.&nbsp; My grandfather had passed away about 13
years ago</b>
<br><b>before this.&nbsp; While we were there I began to look at all her
old photos</b>
<br><b>that she had to sort of pass the time while her and my dad chatted.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>came across this one photo that was blurry. I looked close and hard
and</b>
<br><b>didn't really notice anything unusual. I asked my grandmother why
she</b>
<br><b>would keep a photo that was no good in her photo album and she looked
at</b>
<br><b>me funny and said, " You mean you can't see him?"&nbsp; I looked
at the</b>
<br><b>picture again a little harder.&nbsp; It was a picture of a christmas
tree in</b>
<br><b>which the lights sort of streaked across the photo and the tree
was</b>
<br><b>blurred, but right in front of the christmas tree was a very distinct</b>
<br><b>image of my late grandfather.&nbsp; I don't know how I even overlooked
it.</b>
<br><b>"This looks like grandpa. He is smiling."&nbsp; She began to tell
me that</b>
<br><b>three years ago she had gotten her very first christmas tree and
my uncle</b>
<br><b>took a picture of it for her with a polaroid camera.&nbsp; Seconds
after the</b>
<br><b>film developed he looked at it and immediatley said to my grandmother,</b>
<br><b>"Thats dad."&nbsp; As she told me this story I couldn't take my
eyes off the</b>
<br><b>picture.&nbsp; It kinda freaked me out just a bit.&nbsp; Then all
of a sudden it</b>
<br><b>got uncomfortably cold on the couch where I was sitting.&nbsp; Now
this is a</b>
<br><b>very old house and does not have central air or heat.&nbsp; My grandmother
was</b>
<br><b>also cold natured and had the gas heater on which was right next
to the</b>
<br><b>couch where I was sitting. My dad and grandmother just kept talking
as I</b>
<br><b>was trying to figure out where the heck the cold was coming from.
I felt</b>
<br><b>the window behind my head which was very warm to the touch from
the sun.</b>
<br><b>I moved down the couch closer to my father and it got warmer. But
when I</b>
<br><b>moved back to where I was sitting it was still cold.&nbsp; I can't
explain it.</b>
<br><b>No drafts or air conditioning.&nbsp; I wonder if it was my grandfather
trying</b>
<br><b>to say hello to me.&nbsp; I don't know if it was a ghostly experience
or not</b>
<br><b>because I didn't feel strange and the hair on the back of my neck
never</b>
<br><b>stood up. But that picture sure did weird me out enough to make
my eyes</b>
<br><b>stay open when I should be sleeping for a couple days.&nbsp; Thanks
for your</b>
<br><b>time.</b>

<p><b>My Grandmother's Experience.</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: rarnette@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>In the summer of '87 I went with my grandmother to Meridian, Mississippi
to</b>
<br><b>spend the summer with an old freind of her's, who I will call "Rose",
with</b>
<br><b>whom she had grown up.&nbsp; The summer was spent with my grandmother
and Rose</b>
<br><b>visiting their old freinds and stomping-grounds while I rode around
Rose's</b>
<br><b>and her husband's farm on a four-wheel ATV looking after things.&nbsp;
All the</b>
<br><b>days of this summer were spent in this general course without much</b>
<br><b>excitement, except the day my grandmother and Rose saw a ghost.&nbsp;
You see,</b>
<br><b>one day, about three weeks into our stay, my grandmother and Rose
had</b>
<br><b>decided to go visit an old friend, a woman who belonged to one of
the oldest</b>
<br><b>families in Meridian, and in fact, lived in the oldest house IN
Meridian.</b>
<br><b>This house is featured on the cover of Meridian's tourist's guide.&nbsp;
Well the</b>
<br><b>lady that lived in this house was rather old, a bit older than my</b>
<br><b>grandmother and Rose, and because the idea for to visit her was
rather</b>
<br><b>spur-of-the-moment, grandma and Rose decided to drive around the
old house</b>
<br><b>to look for signs of life or activity before knocking on the door.&nbsp;
Well, as</b>
<br><b>they were passing the front side of the house for the second time,
they both</b>
<br><b>noticed a beautiful young women in a beautiful white gown watching
them.</b>
<br><b>When they saw her they stopped the car in order to ask her about
their</b>
<br><b>freind.&nbsp; As they began to get out of the car, though, the young
woman began</b>
<br><b>to fade back through the front door.&nbsp; Upon seeing this, they
both looked at</b>
<br><b>each other and basically asked, "Did you just see that?!!!"&nbsp;
Terribly</b>
<br><b>frightened, they both jumped back in the car, fastened their seat-belts
and</b>
<br><b>prepared to leave.&nbsp; Before they did, though, they both looked
back, only to</b>
<br><b>see the young women watching them from one of the glass panes that
sided the</b>
<br><b>door.&nbsp; Now I did not see the ghost myself, but when grandma
and Rose got</b>
<br><b>back, they were both speechless, with a pallor and sweatiness that
could not</b>
<br><b>have been faked.&nbsp; This is how I know that ghosts exist.</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Ghost</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: DMBushor@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>A couple of weeks ago, on Halloween, my friend and I went to the
local</b>
<br><b>cemetery to take pictures.&nbsp; She is a photography major and
I wanted to get a</b>
<br><b>"ghost picture."&nbsp; It wasn't very dark outside when we left
my house.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>cemetery is only about a mile away and is just off of a main road.&nbsp;
There</b>
<br><b>were kids out trick-or-treating.&nbsp; When I drove up the hill
towards the</b>
<br><b>parking lot, it got really dark.&nbsp; I thought it was odd, but
I just figured it</b>
<br><b>was getting later or maybe more clouds came over head.&nbsp; It
wasn't until I</b>
<br><b>parked my car and killed the engine that I noticed how quiet it
was.&nbsp; I could</b>
<br><b>see kids walking around not very far from us so we should have been
able to</b>
<br><b>hear them.&nbsp; I thought it was strange, but I wasn't scared yet.&nbsp;
We started</b>
<br><b>walking around in search of Big Elk (he was the last full blooded
chief of</b>
<br><b>the Omaha tribe) when I noticed my flash light was doing weird stuff.&nbsp;
It</b>
<br><b>would be normal, then I would walk a few steps and it would turn
off.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>would walk a few more steps and it would start dimming and brightening.&nbsp;
This</b>
<br><b>was when I started freaking out.&nbsp; They were new batteries and
the flashlight</b>
<br><b>wasn't old.&nbsp; We decided at that point to get a different flashlight.&nbsp;
We went</b>
<br><b>back to my friends apt and got her light and went back to the cemetery.&nbsp;
This</b>
<br><b>time we drove past where my light was weird and strait up to where
the older</b>
<br><b>graves are.&nbsp; After about 5-10 minutes of walking around we
found an old</b>
<br><b>headstone that was unreadable.&nbsp; She decided to take a picture
of it so I held</b>
<br><b>my flashlight on it and she walked closer to it.&nbsp; At the same
exact time she</b>
<br><b>snapped the picture, both of us got a chill up the backs of our
necks and I</b>
<br><b>got this huge feeling of not being wanted.&nbsp; I told her frantically
that I was</b>
<br><b>done and that I was leaving.&nbsp; That picture didn't turn out
but another one</b>
<br><b>she took did.&nbsp; I was taken the first time we were there.&nbsp;
It was blurry, but</b>
<br><b>you could make everything out.&nbsp; There were a bunch of trees
and tombstones.</b>
<br><b>In front of one of the trees you could see a white blob that looked
about the</b>
<br><b>height of a grown man.&nbsp; You can't see any humanly features,
but it looks very</b>
<br><b>out of place.&nbsp; Lightning struck at the same time she took that
picture so it</b>
<br><b>didn't turn out well.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next night I went to a friend who is psychic.&nbsp;
A soon as I walked in</b>
<br><b>the door she was like, "What did you do?"&nbsp; I told her and she
said she could</b>
<br><b>see a middle aged Indian (from India) man standing behind me.&nbsp;
He frightened</b>
<br><b>her at first but after her and I talked for about an hour she said
his eyes</b>
<br><b>became loving.&nbsp; She told me he was angry because he thought
I was trying to</b>
<br><b>get rid of him.&nbsp; But when he realized I wasn't he told her
how he died and</b>
<br><b>that he had fallen in love with me as a friend and wanted to be
my guardian</b>
<br><b>angel.&nbsp; She was no longer scared of him and I told him that
as long as he</b>
<br><b>doesn't scare or harm anyone he could stay.&nbsp; She gave me an
angel figure that</b>
<br><b>she said was a gift from him.&nbsp; When I touched it my hands started
smelling</b>
<br><b>like roses.&nbsp; The angel itself doesn't smell, but my hands do
after I touch</b>
<br><b>her.&nbsp; The whole next day I smelt roses.&nbsp; I thought I was
going crazy because</b>
<br><b>no one else could.</b>
<br><b>It wasn't until the next day when my friend that was with me in
the cemetery</b>
<br><b>was in my car that I realized I wasn't crazy.&nbsp; As soon as she
got in she</b>
<br><b>said, "What's with the rose perfume?"&nbsp; I about fell over.&nbsp;
I was so happy</b>
<br><b>that she could smell it to I about died.&nbsp; Now a few things
have started</b>
<br><b>around my house.&nbsp; Like a few minutes ago, my water faucet turned
on and then</b>
<br><b>off by its self.&nbsp; I just reminded him not to scare me.&nbsp;
I figure that I could</b>
<br><b>always use another guardian angel and if he wants the job he can
go for it.</b>
<br><b>I haven't felt scared yet and I don't think he wants to scare or
hurt me.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>have recently been scared by a spirit though, but it's more my friend's</b>
<br><b>story, so I'll let her tell it if she wants.</b><b></b>

<p><b>New Orleans Famous Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: astrea@mindspring.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>On October 29th, 2000, I believe my friends and I met with one of
New</b>
<br><b>Orleans' more famous ghosts. Julie.</b>
<br><b>Six online friends and I had gone to New Orleans over the Halloween
weekend.</b>
<br><b>That Saturday night, we took a walking tour of the French Quarter
which</b>
<br><b>lasted three hours and explained many ghost stories of the Quarter.
One of</b>
<br><b>which was that of Julie, an octaroon mistress who died on the rooftop
of her</b>
<br><b>French Quarter home. On the lower level of her home now stands a
boutique</b>
<br><b>called The Bottom of the Cup, with its twin boutique of the same
name on the</b>
<br><b>far side of the Quarter near the police station.</b>
<br><b>Julie is known to cast the scent of magnolias around her presence,
as well</b>
<br><b>as for playing with the long hair of women who frequent the building
that</b>
<br><b>was her home.</b>
<br><b>The next evening would be our last in New Orleans, so we made the
trek back</b>
<br><b>into the Quarter to take pictures at the various haunting sites,
as oddly</b>
<br><b>none of us had carried a camera on the tour. We passed the Royal
Street home</b>
<br><b>of Julie in a bit of a hurry. My temper had flared a bit and I was
walking</b>
<br><b>quickly, not paying any attention to where we were going, down Royal
Street,</b>
<br><b>through Jackson Square in front of St. Louis Cathedral and eventually
coming</b>
<br><b>to the police station.</b>
<br><b>Out of nowhere, the girl at my side and I were overcome with the
smell of</b>
<br><b>flowers. Not strange in itself, except that there were no flowers
anywhere</b>
<br><b>and the scent was so strong that it was unnatural. It was as if
someone had</b>
<br><b>held an ether mask over our faces coated in flower essence. Every
breath was</b>
<br><b>pure scent. Wide eyed, I turned to my friend and asked, "Do you
smell</b>
<br><b>that!??!" Her expression was as shocked as I imagine mine was.</b>
<br><b>We looked around as the others caught up with us, and began to smell
it as</b>
<br><b>well, and noticed that the police station's grounds were torn up
for</b>
<br><b>landscaping. No plants, no bushes, only trees with no flowers. There
were no</b>
<br><b>shops open in the area that were or could have been burning incense.
There</b>
<br><b>was, however, one suprising thing. The second Bottom of the Cup
boutique was</b>
<br><b>right across the street.</b>
<br><b>Another friend pointed this out and laughingly said, "Hi, Julie!".
She will</b>
<br><b>tell you that then she felt fingers play in the back of her hair.</b>
<br><b>I've heard many times that ghosts will travel between places that
the humans</b>
<br><b>who inhabit their haunts will go. Only if its a short distance,
mind you,</b>
<br><b>which this was. One boutique being connected to the other, obviously.
By the</b>
<br><b>time I reached the police station, my camera was put away. I do
have some</b>
<br><b>photos taken a few minutes after the incident, which I need to examine
more</b>
<br><b>closely...just in case.</b>
<br><b>I can't say that I smelled magnolias, only that it was an overpowering,</b>
<br><b>unnatural floral scent. I can't prove that my friend actually felt
something</b>
<br><b>in her hair, though I have no reason to doubt her. I can only say
that I</b>
<br><b>believe Julie came out to stop our hasty, irritated march through
the French</b>
<br><b>Quarter.</b>

<p><b>My Father?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jocsho@impop.bellatlantic.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is event that happened in December of 1985. My father had passed</b>
<br><b>away in September of 1985, of cancer and I is my belief that he
visits</b>
<br><b>from time to time, to see how people in my family are doing. Around</b>
<br><b>christmas of&nbsp; '85, my brother, sister, and a friend of my brother
were</b>
<br><b>sitting around our dining room table playing cards and just having
a</b>
<br><b>good time. Well all of a sudden my brother's friend looked up from
the</b>
<br><b>table and his jaw just dropped and hit the ground, and that got
the</b>
<br><b>attention of my siblings, who looked in the direction of the living
room</b>
<br><b>were they observed a greenish mistlike light come down the steps
to the</b>
<br><b>second floor, go through the living room , and out the front door.
A few</b>
<br><b>seconds after the mist had left, my mother came running down the
steps</b>
<br><b>and said "DID YOU SEE THAT!" well there was and overwelming Yes
from</b>
<br><b>everyone in the room. My brothers friend decided that he had seen
enough</b>
<br><b>and promptly left through the back door. It is kind of funny that
he</b>
<br><b>never came through the front door again after that day!</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Memories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ATAFF@amfam.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I would like to start by telling you that I love your sight, and
I read it</b>
<br><b>often.&nbsp; It is very informative and entertaining at the same
time.&nbsp; That is</b>
<br><b>rare to find these days.&nbsp; For a long time I had these memories
that I am</b>
<br><b>about to describe, I always thought maybe I had an overactive imagination
or</b>
<br><b>maybe even I was alittle strange.&nbsp; I always believed however
that I was not</b>
<br><b>crazy, or any crazier than anyone else that is normal.&nbsp; Ha
Ha.&nbsp; The first</b>
<br><b>thing I can remember I had to be about 3 years old.&nbsp; I remember
my</b>
<br><b>grandmother putting me to bed on her couch in a strange place to
me.&nbsp; (It</b>
<br><b>was on the couch of a home that my grandparents owned in Arkansas
and it was</b>
<br><b>only used by them once in a while. Kind of a vacation spot as my
mother</b>
<br><b>recently explained to me.)&nbsp; Anyway, I remember grandma turning
out the</b>
<br><b>lights and going to bed herself and shortly after wards, I began
feeling</b>
<br><b>very uneasy and frightened.&nbsp; I started hearing voices that
sort of swirled</b>
<br><b>around my head.&nbsp; It was totally dark and I could not see anything,
and I</b>
<br><b>could not make out what these voices were actually saying, but it
was like a</b>
<br><b>low whisper and they were as I said earlier, just swirling around
my head.</b>
<br><b>I remember that I was unable to move and too afraid to say anything
or</b>
<br><b>scream for my grandmother.&nbsp; I finally covered up my head with
a pillow and</b>
<br><b>pulled the covers up tight and fell asleep.&nbsp; Later after talking
to my</b>
<br><b>mother and father I found out that I would have been about 3 and
the reason</b>
<br><b>I could not move or get up was because my leg was broken at the
time and I</b>
<br><b>had a full cast on my leg.&nbsp; My mother and father were both
surprised that I</b>
<br><b>could remember the trailer that my grandparents had there as I was
only</b>
<br><b>there a few times and I was so young.</b>
<br><b>The next memory of this nature that I have is when I was about 8
years old.</b>
<br><b>I lived with my parents in a small old house and for some reason,
I did not</b>
<br><b>like spending time in my bedroom alone.&nbsp; Most of the time I
played with my</b>
<br><b>toys in the living room or outside.&nbsp; I always would get a strange
feeling</b>
<br><b>when in my room alone.&nbsp; I also would have problems sleeping
at night.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>always had the feeling that there was an old lady in my room, one
that was</b>
<br><b>not really pleased that I was there.&nbsp; Kind of like a haggle
old witch or</b>
<br><b>something like that.&nbsp; This is when my sleeping habits became
to sleep every</b>
<br><b>night with my pillow over my head allowing myself only enough room
to</b>
<br><b>breathe.&nbsp; I continued these habits until I was 18 and started
sleeping with</b>
<br><b>my boyfriend.&nbsp; My whole family thought this odd, and commented
on my</b>
<br><b>sleeping habits quite often, but I just told them it was the only
way I</b>
<br><b>could sleep.&nbsp; The only really odd thing that happened in that
house that I</b>
<br><b>can somewhat recall was that I always had strange nightmares.&nbsp;
One night</b>
<br><b>while I was sick with the croup, I dreamt that I was being pushed
to walk a</b>
<br><b>narrow walkway and that the ground was a long way down.&nbsp; When
I woke up, I</b>
<br><b>was clear across my room from my top bunk where I slept and I was
by the</b>
<br><b>door to the room witch was prompt open by a spiny sea shell witch
I had</b>
<br><b>scraped my leg on.&nbsp; I got up and went to the bathroom crying
and crooping</b>
<br><b>and my parents got up and started asking my questions very concerned.&nbsp;
After</b>
<br><b>that I slept on the bottom bunk.&nbsp; Since then, both my parents
have told me</b>
<br><b>they had strange feelings in that house too.&nbsp; When we moved,
my bedrooms</b>
<br><b>were always my favorite hang out and I had no problem, in fact enjoyed
being</b>
<br><b>alone.</b>
<br><b>When I was about 16 or 17 we went to a friends house for my mothers
birthday</b>
<br><b>and I went into the house to use the restroom alone.&nbsp; There
was no one in</b>
<br><b>the house.&nbsp; I was washing my hands and I heard a womans voice
call my first</b>
<br><b>name.&nbsp; I turned around thinking my mother had entered the house
and was</b>
<br><b>about to enter the bathroom and there was no one there.&nbsp; I
dried my hands</b>
<br><b>quickly, the hair had stood up on the back of my neck and arms and
I left</b>
<br><b>the bathroom and the house saying that I appreciated the use of
the bathroom</b>
<br><b>and that the house was lovely.&nbsp; When I told the owner about
this and my</b>
<br><b>mother, the owner told me, oh yeah, that was just grandma, she always
walkes</b>
<br><b>the house and that grandpa did too as they both died in the house.&nbsp;
I did</b>
<br><b>not get scared, because the feeling I had gotten was not uneasy,
it had just</b>
<br><b>caught me by surprise.</b>
<br><b>The next experience was when I was about 18.&nbsp; I moved into
a small house and</b>
<br><b>lived with 2 roomates.&nbsp; This house was shaped like an exact
box, we had the</b>
<br><b>living room and kitchen across from each other and then two bedrooms
one</b>
<br><b>through the living room and one through the kitchen with a bathroom
in</b>
<br><b>between the two bedrooms.&nbsp; We had no doors inside the house
except one on</b>
<br><b>each side of the bathroom adjoining the two bedrooms.&nbsp; We always
kept these</b>
<br><b>open, as I lived with 2 guys as my roomates and we were very cautious
to</b>
<br><b>only have the doors shut when the bathroom was in use to avoid walking
in on</b>
<br><b>each other.&nbsp; We had curtains over our bedroom doors for privacy.&nbsp;
One</b>
<br><b>bedroom belonged to the guys and one bedroom was mine.&nbsp; We
would always</b>
<br><b>remark that we had a little spirit because every now and again the
curtain</b>
<br><b>would throw back in one of the bedrooms as if someone was entering
it and</b>
<br><b>then the curtain in the other bedroom door would throw back as if
someone</b>
<br><b>was leaving it like they were making there rounds through the house.&nbsp;
This</b>
<br><b>reminded us of something a child would do out of bordom or when
playing</b>
<br><b>around.&nbsp; We were never scared or uneasy in the house, even
when home alone.</b>
<br><b>One night the guys came home and had been in an argument and were
obviousely</b>
<br><b>upset.&nbsp; I had several hours earlier warmed my self up some
caserole and put</b>
<br><b>my empty bowl in the sink.&nbsp; Anyway, back to the guys when they
came in and</b>
<br><b>one was telling my how upset he was, he stared getting loud, all
of the</b>
<br><b>sudden, we heard a loud crashing sound.&nbsp; I jumped up and looked
outside</b>
<br><b>thinking somone had thown something at our window and broken it
or a bottle</b>
<br><b>was thrown up against the side of the house.&nbsp; Upon search there
I found</b>
<br><b>nothing, I started looking through the house and found my caserol
dish was</b>
<br><b>broken in the sink.&nbsp; I mean shattered as if I had thrown it
down into the</b>
<br><b>sink.&nbsp; We cleaned up the mess and tried to analyz what had
happend.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>discussed if it had been hot, the cool air rushing up from the pipes
or cold</b>
<br><b>water dripping on it could have shattered it, but I had ate out
of it</b>
<br><b>several hours previous and had put it in the sink with my bear hands
and it</b>
<br><b>was cool when I placed it in the sink.&nbsp; Also we discussed if
it had been</b>
<br><b>cracked, it could have shattered from being heated and then cooled,
but it</b>
<br><b>was practically&nbsp; new, and I had not noticed any cracks.&nbsp;
I and my roomates</b>
<br><b>believe that the child spirit became scared at the raising of my
roomates</b>
<br><b>voice and his anger and broke the dish in the sink to get our attention
and</b>
<br><b>calm him down or get his mind off of his anger.&nbsp; We later found
out that the</b>
<br><b>land lord of the house had once let there daughter and son in law
live there</b>
<br><b>and one day the daughter was going to go to the store.&nbsp; The
daughter started</b>
<br><b>to back out of the driveway and her small son who had unknown to
her wanted</b>
<br><b>to go with her and ran behind her car and she backed over him killing
him.</b>
<br><b>We were saddened to hear this story, but understood who our young
spirit had</b>
<br><b>been in the house.</b>
<br><b>The next experience I had was when I was 22 or so.&nbsp; I went
to visit a friend</b>
<br><b>of mine on several occasions.&nbsp; As he was moving into his home
and cleaning,</b>
<br><b>I went to help him.&nbsp; As we were cleaning the bedrooms, mind
you it was cool</b>
<br><b>outside, I would say it was late September in Missouri, not cold,
but</b>
<br><b>chilly.&nbsp; I noticed that in a few spots upstairs there were
a lot of dead</b>
<br><b>flies, I mean more than I had ever seen before in an old empty farmhouse,</b>
<br><b>but not everywhere, just at the top of the stairs and in a window
ledge,</b>
<br><b>like you would put plants ect in one far back bedroom.&nbsp; I just
vaccumed them</b>
<br><b>up and went on, but it was odd.&nbsp; Then when I would visit him
after he moved</b>
<br><b>in, I would notice that I got an unusually terrified feeling in
the den, as</b>
<br><b>we called it when you would pass through it to go to the bathroom.&nbsp;
I mean</b>
<br><b>every hair on my body would stand on end and I found myself practically</b>
<br><b>running through the room and closing the bathroom door as quickly
as</b>
<br><b>possible and then running back when I was done.&nbsp; Once or twice
we would make</b>
<br><b>plans for me to cook him supper and I would get there before he
was done</b>
<br><b>doing chores, he would not be home yet, I was instructed to wait
inside.&nbsp; As</b>
<br><b>I was waiting int he living room for him I would begin to feel uneasy
and it</b>
<br><b>would grow stronger and stronger until I would feel I should go
outside,</b>
<br><b>when I could not ingnore it any longe and would get ready to leave
he would</b>
<br><b>come home, then it was not so bad.&nbsp; He told me later about
little things</b>
<br><b>that would happen to him at night when he would lay down to go to
sleep,</b>
<br><b>like a window would slam shut, he would get up and open it and then
lay back</b>
<br><b>down and another one would slam shut, finally he would become angry
after a</b>
<br><b>while and yell, stop it and then it would quite and he could go
to sleep.</b>
<br><b>To say the least, I was happy when he moved.&nbsp; I did not like
the feelings I</b>
<br><b>would get, I think the spirit did not want me there at all.</b>

<p><b>My Experiences with the Supernatural</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: whisperfarms@email.msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am a 30 year old woman who never used to believe in ghosts, spirits,
or anything of the like.&nbsp;&nbsp; But after you read about my experiences,
you will see why I am a believer today.&nbsp; My first experience with
anything wierd was when I was 10 years old.&nbsp; My family and I lived
in Aurora, Colorado at this time.&nbsp; We had a beatiful tri-level house,
with 3 bedrooms on the top floor.&nbsp; My bedroom was in the back corner.&nbsp;
One night I was laying on my bed trying to go to sleep and my bed starting
shaking.&nbsp; It scared the daylights out of me.&nbsp; So I laid there
very still and after about 2 minutes it stopped.&nbsp; I put my hand over
to the edge of the bed to get up and go to my parents room and, I tell
you the truth, two very real felling hands grabbed mine and pulled.&nbsp;
Of course, by this time I was really scared and I screamed, which brought
my parents running.&nbsp; I told them what happened and they prayed over
my room and the house and I never had another problem with it again.&nbsp;
I never thought about it again, until I was married and my husband, Tim
and I moved into a small rental house that dated back to the early 1940's.&nbsp;
We had a cat named Cleo at that time and she is the one who first noticed
that something was not right about this house.&nbsp; I would find her staring
at the fireplace, hissinf and all puffed up or growling at the front door.&nbsp;
All of this would happen at night, there was never any problem during the
day. Well one night, Tim and I were sitting in the living room watching
TV when Cleo started hissing at the fireplace again and when we looked
there where little whorls of ashes spinning around in the fireplace.&nbsp;
There was no drafts or anything of the kind.&nbsp; Then we heard footsteps
on the front porch, when Tim went to the front door to look out the window
inset, there was no one there.&nbsp; As soon as he sat down, the footsteps
atarted again, walking in circles and you could see the shadow of something
passing the window.&nbsp; Well, needles to say, there was always a light
on in the house at night from that time on.&nbsp; One night, when Tim's
parents were over, they heard this same thing going on, and they started
praying over the house and the footsteps stopped.&nbsp; Later that night,
I had gone to the kitchen to get something to drink and what I saw in my
living room made me drop my drink.&nbsp; There was an angel standing there
telling me that the spirit had gone to where it was supposed to go and
would never be back.&nbsp; After we moved out of this house, my sister-in-law
told me that she had been having bad dreams about our house.&nbsp; With
faces in the ceiling and skeletal hands reaching from vines growing up
the chimney.&nbsp; Only then did I connect the dreams I had been having
of anger and of being alone with this house.&nbsp; The house my husband,
our two kids, and I live in now is very nice, the only thing we seem to
have is the ghost of a small cat, who likes to run out from under the couch
and down the hallway into our bedroom.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not the only one in my family who has had experinces
like this.&nbsp; My brother, Steve, who is 4 years younger than I am and
not inclined to mess with or believe in this kind of thing, came down for
a visit one year and told me this story.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; He and his wife, Jenni, lived in a trailer in Georgia.&nbsp;
This trailer sat next to a small lake.&nbsp; The property was owned by
a gentleman who lived in a house on the other end of the property.&nbsp;
Well, after some strange things happened, Steve went and talked to the
owner.&nbsp; The owner said that his brother used to live in their trailer
and that one day he had gotten drunk and went swimming in the lake and
drowned.&nbsp; Since then, he had been unable to keep renters in the trailer
because his brother still belived it was his home.&nbsp; Well, my brother
took matters into his own hands.&nbsp; That night, their "houseguest" decided
to watch TV at about 3:00 in the morning at full volume.&nbsp; My brother
walked out into the living rrom and saw the wavy outline of the man sitting
in the chair facing the TV.&nbsp; Steve told it that he didn't mind if
he wanted to watch TV or live in the house with them but could he turn
down the TV as it was ony 3:00 am.&nbsp; Steve went back to bed and could
not believe it when the volume on the TV was turned down to a murmer.&nbsp;
Steve also told me that their "houseguest" also liked games.&nbsp; Steve
had a fishing game, the kind that you used the little poles to catch the
fish as they turned in a circle on the board.&nbsp; Well, my brother came
home from work on evening to find his wife, Jenni, sitting on the front
steps waiting for him.&nbsp; When he asked what she was doing, she informed
him that the ghost was inside playing games and she didn't feel comfortable
with it. When he went inside, the fish game was sitting on the the dining
room table, which was unusual in itself, because it was kept in the laundry
room and Jenni had not put it there.&nbsp; The game was going in circles
with the fish moving and one of the poles going up and down.&nbsp; But
what really freaked my brother out about the whole thing was that there
were no batteries in the game at all.&nbsp; Well, Steve told me that they
and their "houseguest" came to some kind of a truce and Steve and Jenni
lived there for another two years.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt pretty alone until I found this site and it
helped me realize that I am not the only one out there.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;
I hope that this story helps someone else out there.</b><b></b>

<br><b>I've Had A Few Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sflack@lbbs.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have a few experiences to share.&nbsp; Two of them happened in
the house I grew up in.&nbsp; When we first moved into the house, it was
very run down and needed renovating, so my mom, dad, sister, and I all
slept in one bedroom upstairs.&nbsp; Well, I was sleeping in my bed one
night and woke up for no reason.&nbsp; I was four years old at the time.&nbsp;
I heard the voices of two men talking downstairs.&nbsp; Of course I was
terrified.&nbsp; I thought someone had broken in and was stealing things
from our still unpacked boxes.&nbsp; I remember being so scared that I
could not even scream for my dad.&nbsp; I got up and got into bed with
my parents.&nbsp; When we got up in the morning, nothing had been touched
downstairs.&nbsp; Years later when I was in high school, I would be very
scared while laying in my bed in my room.&nbsp; I hadn't seen anything,
I would just feel very scared.&nbsp; One night, I was laying there and
felt someone sitting in a small chair I had sitting in the corner.&nbsp;
The chair was facing my bed, and I knew something evil was there watching
me.&nbsp; I was too terrified to leave.&nbsp; I eventually fell asleep.</b>
<br><b>Another time when I was in Junior High, another friend and I spent
the night at another girl's house.&nbsp; We all slept in her brother's
room as he had the biggest bed.&nbsp; We had been eating popcorn earlier
and placed the bowl of leftover popcorn at the foot of the bed.&nbsp; As
we lay there in the dark, we were all three being pelted with pieces of
popcorn.&nbsp; Of course each of us accused the other of throwing it, but
we all denied doing it.&nbsp; We then looked to the end of the bed and
saw popcorn flying up on its own.&nbsp; In the morning, the bowl was tipped,
and there was popcorn everywhere.&nbsp; Our friend's mom told us the next
day that they were told the house was haunted.</b>
<br><b>Lastly, I was working late one night, and one other co-worker was
here.&nbsp; We were chatting at her desk and heard someone cough from the
other side of the office.&nbsp; When we went over there, no one else was
in the office besides us.&nbsp; I then was walking to one of the conference
rooms to turn on the TV.&nbsp; There had been a tornado, and I wanted to
check the status.&nbsp; All lights were off, and as I got about 10 feet
from the conference room, I got this terrifying feeling like I was to turn
around and go back.&nbsp; I did.&nbsp; And, those are my ghostly experiences.</b>

<br><b>My Dad!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: suezq7767@hotmail.com.</b><b></b>
<p><b>My father used to laugh at me for believing in ghosts, nothing every
really happened until after he died, which I believe he came to me to prove
it to me- my brother and sister haven't experienced anything.</b>
<br><b>One of my child's toys have went off, saying "hello baby" (it was
a phone that said that) it said it over and over....</b>
<br><b>I felt someone touch my arm once and I turned around to say "huh"
and no one was there.&nbsp; I was in my father's favorite kitchen chair,
where he always sat.</b>
<br><b>Then my childs other toy has played row, row, row your boat once
on the anniversary of his death and once in the middle of the night.&nbsp;
My dad loved to sing that song in his "deep" voice.</b>
<br><b>I said once to myself while driving" I wonder if people can really
hear us"?&nbsp; I said, Ok, if someone can, give me a sign, but don't scare
me.....that night around 11:15 my smoke alarm beeped once and woke me and
my husband up....he said oh, it must be the batteries. I said, no way,
we just moved in 6 months ago...they are new.. Then I remembered what I
said!&nbsp; I just smiled with the feeling it was my dad.</b>
<br><b>I have been to chanellors and think the are neat!&nbsp; All of this

<p><b>Texas Patches</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cwilson85@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My cat, Texas Patches died a week after Easter 1999.&nbsp;&nbsp;
2 weeks later I had a</b>
<br><b>dream of her being angry because I wasn't there.&nbsp; So the next
time I could</b>
<br><b>take leave I went home.&nbsp; I asked my parents were they buried
her.&nbsp; I went to</b>
<br><b>her grave to pay my respects and the dreams stopped.</b>
<br><b>At times, she still comes "in person" to visit which I find interesting</b>
<br><b>since I'm in California and she died in Arizona.&nbsp; She was 18
yrs old when</b>
<br><b>she passed on. We had her since she was 2 months old.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have no problem</b>
<br><b>with her visiting just wonder why she comes to California. The only
thing</b>
<br><b>I've said was "Texas?" and get a warm feeling and then the feeling
leaves.</b>
<br><b>When in AZ I "feel" her jump on the bed and lay beside my legs.
for awhile</b>
<br><b>she was doing that here in California but stopped except when I'm
sick.</b>
<br><b>We have another cat named Pumpkin Rose which seems to "see" her
as well.</b>
<br><b>My mom can "feel" her too.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Mother Called</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: october@NRTCO.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>when i was little i used to hear someone always calling my name it
was always nice and friendly and it was always a womans voice , everytime
i heard it i would ask my step mom if she called me she always said she
didnt and i would ask my sister too and it was never her, &amp; i knew
lots it wasnt them because sometimes they were with me , when i got a little
older i talked to my grandma about this because me and her are close because
my real mother died when i was only 2, so i told my grandma how over all
these years almost everyday i heard a womans voice calling me, and my grandma
then told me that she used to hear a womans voice calling her too except
the voice wasnt calling out her name it was calling out mom and she told
me that it was her daughters voice who is my mother i didnt recognize the
voice because i cant remember her voice because she dies when i was so
young but my grandma said it was her and sometimes when the the voice used
to call her she would try to find where it was coming from because she
loved my mom alot and wasnt scared even if it was a ghost just as long
as it was her and the voices always came from the hallway to her room and
in it, only me and my grandma ever heard these voices i think its because
we were the ones who needed her the most we miss her so much, and when
i used to hear the voices other things used to happen to like noises ussually
banging on the furnace because it makes a loud noise and whenever i go
in this one room the water pumps just start going even if no one is using
water and it always scares me because it goes out of no where, i know for
sure i wasnt imagining any of this and that scares me even more but i know
she loved me and now i dont hear anything anymore and neither does my grandma
it went away after we both talked about it</b>

<p><b>By: MuSHRooMHEaDBeBe@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>there are a couple of experiences.&nbsp; The first being that I moved
into a house</b>
<br><b>when i was 5, that a boy had died in.&nbsp; I had constant awakinings
from a</b>
<br><b>little boy, telling me to get out.... sure enough, 6 months later,
I had to</b>
<br><b>move out, due to a disagreement with my father.</b>
<br><b>The other story is that my mom died when i was a year old, and since
then, i</b>
<br><b>have dreams about the woman i never knew, and the way she died.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Maui Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: OUISCH27@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>In my early 20's, I moved to Maui to live with a friend of mine who
had just</b>
<br><b>had a baby.&nbsp; She rented in a neighborhood built years ago by
Dole Corp. for</b>
<br><b>its pineapple plantation workers-- block after block of little ramshackle</b>
<br><b>houses.&nbsp; Rachel liked to collect roommates-- it was almost
a bed &amp; breakfast</b>
<br><b>for friends new and old-- anyone her kind heart took pity on.&nbsp;
At one time we</b>
<br><b>had about 9 people either living or crashing there, and everyone
shared</b>
<br><b>similar otherworldly experiences on the island.&nbsp; For instance,
you could stop</b>
<br><b>by the condemned sugarcane factory that had a banyon tree splitting
it</b>
<br><b>through the middle and pick up some curious vibes-- then follow
up with a</b>
<br><b>visit to "Old Maui High", a completely abandoned high school campus,
and</b>
<br><b>sense all the presences you wanted in broad daylight.&nbsp;&nbsp;
But we all had our</b>
<br><b>very own presences to come home to.</b>
<br><b>The kitchen had a door leading into the garage.&nbsp; Even if you
locked it, at</b>
<br><b>certain times of the day and night, this door would unlock and swing
open by</b>
<br><b>itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Footsteps would cross the kitchen and fade out.&nbsp;
Guests sleeping on</b>
<br><b>the convertible futon couch in the living room reported that the
footsteps</b>
<br><b>came right up to the bed and walked around it.&nbsp; There was nothing
to see if</b>
<br><b>you opened your eyes, but you'd feel as though you were being checked
out.</b>
<br><b>We speculated that it was the ghost of a deceased pineapple picker
coming</b>
<br><b>home from "work" and finding strange living people in his living
room.</b>
<br><b>We also had baby footsteps which pattered down the hallway to the
bedrooms at</b>
<br><b>the end.&nbsp; Rachel and her baby shared the lefthand room, I had
the righthand</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; Time and again, I'd hear little hands pounding on my
door at about</b>
<br><b>baby height and think it was Rachel's son, only to realize that
he was asleep</b>
<br><b>for the night.&nbsp; It also happened in the daytime when he &amp;
his mom were out of</b>
<br><b>the house.</b>
<br><b>As a household, we used to eat potluck together several times a
week.&nbsp; At one</b>
<br><b>point, everyone in the house went through this phase of rampant
overeating.</b>
<br><b>We'd stuff ourselves until we were sick, almost unable to stop.&nbsp;
We'd eat</b>
<br><b>even when we flat out didn't want to, almost as though we were being
forced.</b>
<br><b>One day I found a book in the town library's local interest section
about</b>
<br><b>Huna, the tribal religion of the Hawaiian islands.&nbsp; I found
a wealth of</b>
<br><b>information about spirits and hauntings in this book-- apparently,
the</b>
<br><b>kama'aina (native-born locals) were well-versed in dealing with
such matters.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The book specifically cited the "hungry ghost" as being of
significance to</b>
<br><b>their people.&nbsp; A "hungry ghost" causes people to eat against
their will,</b>
<br><b>because it feels forgotten &amp; neglected.&nbsp; The book suggested
making up a plate</b>
<br><b>for the ghost so that it would feel "fed".</b>
<br><b>I came home and excitedly told a few of my roommates about what
I'd read.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>talked it over and decided this might just be the answer.&nbsp;
I don't remember</b>
<br><b>if we set out a plate for it that night, but after dinner I went
for a walk</b>
<br><b>with Nikki, one of my roommates.&nbsp; We always walked laps around
the big town</b>
<br><b>athletic field which was lit up brightly at night, and held hands
out of</b>
<br><b>fellow-gal friendliness.&nbsp; Suddenly, I FELT SOMETHING TAKE MY
OTHER HAND.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>wasn't dreaming.&nbsp; Something was holding my hand suspended in
the air, in the</b>
<br><b>same way that Nikki was holding my other hand, and I couldn't pull
loose.</b>
<br><b>Scared, I whispered to Nikki, "Something's got my hand."&nbsp; Big
waves of pure</b>
<br><b>energy were racing up that arm, and whatever held my hand was very
cold.&nbsp; But</b>
<br><b>I didn't get an unfriendly feeling from it at all.&nbsp; Nikki tried
to push my</b>
<br><b>arm down, it stayed up.&nbsp; She felt my hand.&nbsp; It was ice
cold, and she said my</b>
<br><b>other hand was warm.&nbsp; She whispered back that we should keep
walking and see</b>
<br><b>what happened.&nbsp; We started to talk out loud about the Huna
book and the ghost</b>
<br><b>in our house, saying that we wanted to be respectful of its wishes.&nbsp;
We</b>
<br><b>walked a full rotation and a half around the field with our unseen
companion.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The energy it was sending up my arm was making my teeth chatter,
my body</b>
<br><b>shiver and my hair stand on end, all on a balmy Hawaiian night.</b>
<br><b>Suddenly, with a very definite feeling of friendly farewell, I felt
the being</b>
<br><b>let go of my hand and leave my side.&nbsp; My knees buckled and
I burst into</b>
<br><b>tears.&nbsp; At that very moment, Nikki and I were looking upward
at the night</b>
<br><b>sky, and a meteorite blazed across it.</b>
<br><b>Our lease ran out a few months afterward, and we all moved on.&nbsp;
I don't</b>
<br><b>remember any more happening with the garage door ghost.&nbsp; It
was as if he had</b>
<br><b>only wanted to be recognized, then he could leave.&nbsp; The baby
ghost seemed to</b>
<br><b>stay.&nbsp; Maybe it didn't understand that it could leave, the
way the older</b>
<br><b>ghost did.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Many Haunts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: thailiavigue98@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is the first time writing my experiences here. I</b>
<br><b>have quite a few.&nbsp; I will start with he most recent.</b>
<br><b>When I was 12 (1992) I lived in Montana.&nbsp; This was the</b>
<br><b>very first time I experienced anything.</b>
<br><b>I got really sick.&nbsp; The doctors thought it might have</b>
<br><b>been from the soldiers bringing back some weird stuff</b>
<br><b>back from Desert Storm.&nbsp; But to me I felt like I was</b>
<br><b>going to die.</b>
<br><b>I remember the night it was the sickness was the worst</b>
<br><b>it had ever been.&nbsp; My parents were carrying me to bed</b>
<br><b>cause I had no energy to walk, and barely speak.&nbsp; But</b>
<br><b>When they got to my room, I saw a woman sitting in the</b>
<br><b>corner.&nbsp; I asked me mom who it was.&nbsp; She thought I was</b>
<br><b>hallucinating because I was so sick.</b>
<br><b>Later that night, I was awakened by something watching</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; I looked over and saw a woman sitting with me.</b>
<br><b>She was wearing all white and had long curly hair.</b>
<br><b>She saw just looking at me and had a smile on her</b>
<br><b>face. I feel back to a peaceful sleep.&nbsp; After that I</b>
<br><b>got better REAL fast.&nbsp; It was almost like my guardian</b>
<br><b>angel watching over me.</b>
<br><b>My second experience didn't come to me until my family</b>
<br><b>and I moved to Washington State, in a little suburb of</b>
<br><b>Seattle called Auburn.&nbsp; We lived in a brick duplex.</b>
<br><b>As soon as you walked into the house you'd be in the</b>
<br><b>kitchen and you'd see the darkness beyond that.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>house my family now call "the dungeon" because it was</b>
<br><b>so dark in that house.</b>
<br><b>The first ghost I saw in that house wasn't until 6</b>
<br><b>months after we moved in.</b>
<br><b>My parents had just left for work and my school was</b>
<br><b>less than a block away.&nbsp; I was getting ready for</b>
<br><b>school and I was walking out my room and was in the</b>
<br><b>threshold of the door when "she" walked right in from</b>
<br><b>of me.&nbsp; She was wearing a long black late 1800s dress</b>
<br><b>and had her long black hair down.&nbsp; She had walked</b>
<br><b>through the wall, stopped, looked at me, turned back</b>
<br><b>and kept walking right into the bathroom.&nbsp; She was so</b>
<br><b>pale and translucent!&nbsp; I was petrified!&nbsp; But I had to</b>
<br><b>get ready for school, so I went into the bathroom and</b>
<br><b>got ready.&nbsp; I thought I had a hallucination and didn't</b>
<br><b>think about it after that.&nbsp; UNTIL.....</b>
<br><b>One night my mom and I got to bed really late a little</b>
<br><b>after midnight.&nbsp; We turned off all the lights.&nbsp; And it</b>
<br><b>was pitch black in the house.&nbsp; Not even the light from</b>
<br><b>outside shown in.&nbsp; We were almost to the hall when I</b>
<br><b>saw a flash of light and saw a little boy about 7 or 8</b>
<br><b>years old run right in front of us.&nbsp; He was wearing</b>
<br><b>knickerbockers and a little cap.&nbsp; I soon as it</b>
<br><b>dissappered.&nbsp; I asked my mom if she saw it.&nbsp; In a</b>
<br><b>shaky voice she said no and said she saw that kind of</b>
<br><b>stuff all the time at work.&nbsp; How could she know what I</b>
<br><b>saw, I didn't tell her.</b>
<br><b>Too go on with my true story, I saw a man in my</b>
<br><b>bathroom with a knife in his hand and when I looked at</b>
<br><b>out knife holder there was a knife missing and not in</b>
<br><b>our dishwasher.&nbsp; To this day there is still a knife</b>
<br><b>missing.</b>
<br><b>I saw a girl walking around my room, I had forgotten I</b>
<br><b>had set my clock and when it went off at 6:30am I got</b>
<br><b>up and saw her.&nbsp; She too was wearing black and had the</b>
<br><b>same black hair.&nbsp; She started to come toward me.</b>
<br><b>After that I don't remember anything.&nbsp; I just remember</b>
<br><b>waking up a while later.</b>
<br><b>Then, there was a time when I had just went outside</b>
<br><b>and had forgotten something inside.&nbsp; When I went back</b>
<br><b>to get it everything in the room looked like a tornado</b>
<br><b>when through the living room.</b>
<br><b>The very last thing that happened in the that dungeon</b>
<br><b>of a house was about a month before we moved.&nbsp; I was</b>
<br><b>in the pantry getting some macaroni on the top shelf.</b>
<br><b>When I felt pressure on my chest and was thrown</b>
<br><b>against the wall behind me. The force was so great,</b>
<br><b>that I had bruises on my chest from what ever pushed</b>
<br><b>me and bruises on my back from hitting the wall.</b>
<br><b>But you know, every time I told my mom and dad about</b>
<br><b>it and they never believed me.&nbsp; I told them about a</b>
<br><b>month after we moved and they said they believed me</b>
<br><b>the whole time.&nbsp; So, whatever it was I think it's</b>
<br><b>still following me.&nbsp; The house I live in now, is</b>
<br><b>pretty scary too!</b>
<br><b>Just in the past year and half I have heard chairs</b>
<br><b>moving, the table with the glass in them moving like</b>
<br><b>someone is walking and accidently hitting it as they</b>
<br><b>walk by.&nbsp; I have also heard "him" walking in and out</b>
<br><b>of my room and night and seeing nothing.</b>
<br><b>My boyfriend who WAS a non believer has heard "him"</b>
<br><b>walking by him and has heard the chairs move and seen</b>
<br><b>the dishes move.&nbsp; "He" has banged on the walls in my</b>
<br><b>room and the garage.&nbsp; Now, I'm just really scared and</b>
<br><b>I can say, " I see dead people."&nbsp; Cause I have seen</b>
<br><b>"him" walking in my house!</b>
<br><b>I feel it is a he or a him just the way he watches me</b>
<br><b>and the way he walks in the house.&nbsp; Maybe someday I</b>
<br><b>can solve this mystery.&nbsp; But for now I'm just really scared!</b><b></b>

<p><b>Lou's Spirit</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: amberholland@mindspring.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>First off, let me start by saying that the following story is not
of vital</b>
<br><b>interest, however very important to me personally. I have been extremely</b>
<br><b>psychic since a small child and have had many paranormal experiences
in my</b>
<br><b>life. I am by no means a new comer to the world of parapsychology,
but the</b>
<br><b>following is new to me.</b>
<br><b>In 1997 my beloved cat Louie died of Pleurisy. He was my soul mate
and we</b>
<br><b>were very close. We had conversations on a daily basis and he was
so loyal.</b>
<br><b>He was survived by his mate Sugar Lee. Need less to say, his death
was very</b>
<br><b>overwhelming, tragic and happened so quickly. Louie died at the
Vet about a</b>
<br><b>block and a half from my apartment. After viewing his body and making</b>
<br><b>arrangements for cremation, I returned home alone. I was in some
of the most</b>
<br><b>severe mourning I had ever experienced. While in this process, I
decided to</b>
<br><b>feed Sugar Lee and although I know this is where I made my mistake,
I can't</b>
<br><b>take it back now. I called out for Lou, as I always did for feeding
time. I</b>
<br><b>was in denial and acting a bit strange my self. Approximately tem
minutes</b>
<br><b>later, I was sitting on my bed crying. Sugar Lee had also been crying
out</b>
<br><b>for him as she sat to my left on the hardwood floor. Amazingly,
we both</b>
<br><b>heard a heavy creek come from right side of the floor where Lou
would always</b>
<br><b>sit. Both the cat and I looked over simultaneously, so it was proof
to me</b>
<br><b>that it wasn't simply my mourning imagination. My floors absolutely
do not</b>
<br><b>creak without weight upon them. I knew instantly that Lou was there.
The</b>
<br><b>next day while sitting in the guest room (crying profusely again)
I heard a</b>
<br><b>crashing sound that was not uncommon. Lou would always jump onto
the top of</b>
<br><b>an organ I had and lay on top of it. He was 22 pounds, so he never
failed to</b>
<br><b>knock the sheet music from the top of it. Sure enough, the crashing
sound</b>
<br><b>came from a top the organ and again it was apparent that Lou was
there. When</b>
<br><b>this happened I immediately realized that through my intense mourning
I had</b>
<br><b>summoned Louie's spirit into the apartment. A month or so later,
Sugar Lee</b>
<br><b>had an experience in the hallway that I cannot explain. All I know
is that</b>
<br><b>she saw something that scared her out of her wits. Have you ever
seen a cat</b>
<br><b>go pale? It was interesting to say the least. The reason I'm writing
is</b>
<br><b>because my Husband and I are planning to relocate sometime next
year and I</b>
<br><b>have tremendous concerns about possibly leaving Louie behind. I
can't say</b>
<br><b>for sure that he hasn't moved on, for I haven't had anymore experiences</b>
<br><b>since.</b>

<p><b>Little Boy Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mjp316@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My house has always had a couple of wierd things with it.&nbsp; Its
an old</b>
<br><b>2-story house.&nbsp; Anyway one night I was downstairs looking up
info for a</b>
<br><b>report I was doing.&nbsp; Ironically, it was a ghost report.&nbsp;
My mom was in the</b>
<br><b>room next to me on the phone and my sister was upstairs in bed.&nbsp;
All of a</b>
<br><b>sudden I hear a huge crash as if someone had fallen down our stairs
or</b>
<br><b>something.&nbsp; I got up and ran to the stairs but nothing seemed
out of place.</b>
<br><b>I turned on the light in the kitchen to see if anything had fallen
and</b>
<br><b>everything was in place because I had just cleaned the kitchen before
I did</b>
<br><b>my report.&nbsp; I check the bathroom to see if anything had fallen
and, of</b>
<br><b>course, nothing had fallen.&nbsp; I thought something might have
fallen in my</b>
<br><b>room so I start to walk upstairs.&nbsp; My cat was running around
the house,</b>
<br><b>meowing loudly and wouldn't stop running.&nbsp; I checked my room
and nothing had</b>
<br><b>fallen.&nbsp; I check my sisters room and she was awake and I asked
if she had</b>
<br><b>made that noise and she said she didn't but the noise woke her up
and she</b>
<br><b>was looking around also.&nbsp; Then she decided to go downstairs
and I left her</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; As I did, I saw a flash out of the corner of my eye
on the floor,</b>
<br><b>like a lighter flash.&nbsp; I shrugged it off and went downstairs
because it was</b>
<br><b>cold up there.&nbsp; As I reached the bottom of the stairs I looked
up and</b>
<br><b>noticed it was really dark up their.&nbsp; I decided to go back
up and put a</b>
<br><b>light in the mini hall up there.&nbsp; So I go and grab a lightbulb
and head</b>
<br><b>upstairs.&nbsp; As I get to the top and small kids hand waved up
in my face</b>
<br><b>really quickly.&nbsp; My whole body tensed and I about fell back
down the stairs</b>
<br><b>but caught my balance.&nbsp; I went and put the light in and looked
all over the</b>
<br><b>place to see what the little hand could have been but I didn't find</b>
<br><b>anything.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Experience Is Like Dave's</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Tyra_skylord@rulers-of-the-realm.zzn.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I live in an older neighborhood in Colorado Springs,
CO.&nbsp; We moved</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; into my house when I was seven years old.&nbsp;
It was built in 1903.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever since I was little,my parents said I had
a strange awareness of</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; things that happened around me.&nbsp; I believe
them.&nbsp; At first when I</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; moved in it was fairly quiet; not much happened
for the first three</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; years.&nbsp; I merely had trouble sleeping.&nbsp;
The summer before my sixth</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grade year I had a friend over.&nbsp; We used
to play with my collection</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of horse figurines.&nbsp; Anyhow, we heard what
we thought was my mother</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; walking down the hall, and then we threw the
blankets over our</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heads.&nbsp; We were supposed to be asleep.&nbsp;
We had left my horses in a</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heap.&nbsp; Anyway, when we thought he coast
was clear, we threw the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blankets off.&nbsp; The horses were in a neat
row, standing up!&nbsp; I looked</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over my friend's shoulder and saw a little girl
that looked to be</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; about our age playing with the toys!&nbsp; At
first my friend thought I</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was crazy,until the girl tugged at her shirt.&nbsp;
She spoke to me in a</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very clear and gentle voice.&nbsp; She said her
name was Mary, and that</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her brother Luke lived here with her around 1960.&nbsp;
She was protecting</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me from something that hadn't happened yet.&nbsp;
After that, I saw her</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more and more frequently.&nbsp; I often came
home to find that a room I</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had left messy was spotlessly clean, even though
all of my family was</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with me. I even saw her brother a few times in
my living room.&nbsp; Both</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of them were nice, so I never gave it a second
thought.&nbsp; My mother</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; got an indian sand painting from a friend for
a gift that Christmas</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and hung it up in our bathroom.&nbsp; It kept
turning a quarter turn.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; father, who hadn't believed me before, was frightened
by it and hid</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it in a box downstairs. I later learned of another
ghost, who now</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; walks over my bedroom every night on the roof
and I have seen fall</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; off.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When that happened, I decided to do some research
on the history of</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my house.&nbsp; I went to the library and looked
at micro forms, but found</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very little.&nbsp; I did learn that my house
had had many additions since</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it was built, and that the living room, bathroom,
and my brother's</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; room was the original floorplan of the house.&nbsp;
After the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disappointment of coming up empty-handed, I decided
to go home.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had a dream that night from what I knew was Mary's
point of view.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her father came home drunk, and killed her and
her brother in the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; living room with a long hunting knife. After
that, he sped away in</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his car and hit a light pole.&nbsp; He died also.&nbsp;
His bestfriend came and</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disposed of the bodies.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to forget what I had dreamed.&nbsp;
I saw very litle of Mary</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; until just a few months ago.&nbsp; I am eighteen
now, so that tells you</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how long it has been.&nbsp; I have always heard
the ghost on the roof, and</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it has never bothered me.&nbsp; But Mary came
to me on Halloween, and she</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was genuinely freaked out.&nbsp; My friend and
I were holding a seance as</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a part of our party.&nbsp; A dark figure which
only I could see, but</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; everyone felt, appeared at my bedroom window.&nbsp;
I was just as scared</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as she was.&nbsp; I banished the figure, and
he disappeared after a few</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; minutes.&nbsp; I went to the library again a
week ago.&nbsp; I had a date to</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; look for.&nbsp; September 26th, 1960.&nbsp; I
found the obituaries of Luke,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary, their father.&nbsp; Come to find out that
the footsteps on the roof</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were the evil figure, and he was their father's
friend who was still</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trying to find the bodies he had hidden.&nbsp;
He's gone now, but Luke and</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary still frequent the house.&nbsp; Luke has
of late begun some</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mischievous activity, but I don't grudge him.&nbsp;
The whole fact was</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that Mary was tryingo protect me from that spirit,
and now that he's</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gone, I can finally sleep in peace.&nbsp; But
every now and then I see imp-</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like creatures as you have described. Several
of them come through a</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wall in my room.&nbsp; I can venture so far as
to say they look like small</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dragons to me, but they have never done me any
harm, and they have</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; always been there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry this is so long, but I thought you might
like to know you</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aren't alone in seeing strange spirits.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Life</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: hansenc@prsd.ab.ca</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; About</b>
<br><b>three years ago when we were camping in the British Columbia area,
something</b>
<br><b>strange happened. I was sleeping in the tent beside the Rv in which
the</b>
<br><b>parents slept. In the morning I was the first to wake and mom and
the others</b>
<br><b>were awake too inside the Rv, mom came out and said that you slept
until</b>
<br><b>12:00 am at night and woke me up very pale (me) now I told her I
slept right</b>
<br><b>through the night, I always remeber when I wake up you know. Well,
we put</b>
<br><b>that off for the time being.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; About two weeks later it happened again but at my grandmother's
house when</b>
<br><b>I stayed for the night. She said that you were up at 12:00 am and
very pale,</b>
<br><b>she asked if i felt al can but i didn't answer and again I told
my</b>
<br><b>grandmother that I slept right throught the night. And it happened
again</b>
<br><b>just a week ago with my sister, she said she was afraid of me, she
said that</b>
<br><b>i was standing in her door looking at her very pale, but I don't
remeber</b>
<br><b>anything like this. I read this book on ghosts and found a thing
called</b>
<br><b>doulbe vision, basicly i must be able to project an image of myself
at night</b>
<br><b>and my sister mistaken me for a ghost (image).</b>

<p><b>Ghostly Encounters</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Diane_Grecco@Harlequin.ca</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have some ghostly encounters to share: I used to work in the English</b>
<br><b>department at a college.&nbsp; All the departments are in houses
that the college</b>
<br><b>bought.&nbsp; I'd been told when I first started there that noises
were heard</b>
<br><b>when no one else was in the house, but I was rather skeptical.&nbsp;
For the</b>
<br><b>first year, I heard nothing.&nbsp; My second year working there,
one of the</b>
<br><b>professors died, and that is when I began hearing footsteps coming
from the</b>
<br><b>second floor (I worked on the first floor).&nbsp; I wasn't alone
in hearing these</b>
<br><b>noises -- my friend Dot worked with me, and she heard them, too.&nbsp;
We never</b>
<br><b>felt threatened, though -- we could tell it was a peaceful ghost
who just</b>
<br><b>lingered in the house; we'd walk in and feel like we were home,
like the</b>
<br><b>house welcomed us.</b>
<br><b>One afternoon, when no one else was around and it was stormy out,
we heard</b>
<br><b>footsteps walking up the stairs to the second floor.&nbsp; It sounded
like</b>
<br><b>someone was holding on to the railing, too, because we heard the
same noise</b>
<br><b>we'd hear when someone held on to walk up to the second floor.&nbsp;
We were a</b>
<br><b>little scared, but didn't feel threatened.&nbsp; A student came
in, and he heard</b>
<br><b>the noise, too.&nbsp; Wanting to see what was going on, I went racing
up the same</b>
<br><b>staircase where we'd heard the noise, which stopped right in front
of the</b>
<br><b>office of the professor who'd died, Dot and the student right behind
me.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>thought I was going to see him when I opened the door, so I opened
it very</b>
<br><b>slowly, but there was nothing there.</b>
<br><b>Not long after that, I was talking to Dot, and glanced at the conference</b>
<br><b>table out of the corner of my eye, and from my angle, I saw an arm
and an</b>
<br><b>open book, and the figure was wearing a tan shirt.&nbsp; When I
turned to</b>
<br><b>completely face the table, there was no one there, which on some
level I</b>
<br><b>knew, because I knew Dot and I were alone in the house.&nbsp; But
I believe I saw</b>
<br><b>the late professor, because he was the only one in the department
with a tan</b>
<br><b>short-sleeved polo shirt, and I used to see him sitting at the table</b>
<br><b>reading.</b>
<br><b>There was one scary occurrence in the department, experienced by
two friends</b>
<br><b>of mine, Heather and Kim.&nbsp; They were alone in the department
at the</b>
<br><b>conference table after class, and Heather went upstairs to the bathroom.</b>
<br><b>She heard Kim talking, and wondered who she was talking to, but
when she</b>
<br><b>went downstairs, Kim asked Heather who she was talking to!&nbsp;
Something had</b>
<br><b>mimicked their voices!&nbsp; They got out of there immediately,
and refused to</b>
<br><b>enter the department when no one else was around.</b>

<br><b>It Floated By The Window</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: thegreat1_125@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello...my name is Zeke. I've often visited this site...being that
reading</b>
<br><b>ghost stories is one of my hobbies. Anywho on with my story.</b>
<br><b>I am now 15 and this experience happened when I was around 2-4 years
old.</b>
<br><b>I was lying in bed one night trying to get to sleep. My older brother
was in</b>
<br><b>the at my side on the bed fast asleep. The curtains to the window
were</b>
<br><b>opened and I was staring out looking at the stars. And all of a
sudden I saw</b>
<br><b>something fly by the window. Well it didn't really fly, it actually
kinda</b>
<br><b>floated by. But you see the scary thing is, it was a pinkish figure
it</b>
<br><b>looked like it had just a head a body and a tail. No arms and no
legs of any</b>
<br><b>sort. As it was floating by it's head started to spin around in
circles. I</b>
<br><b>was so scared, as I am now just typing about it. Because for some
reason I</b>
<br><b>always feel like that same "demon" or whatever it was that floated
by</b>
<br><b>follows me wherever I am, even though I have never seen it since.</b>
<br><b>Now as every little child would do I went to tell my mom. But of
course just</b>
<br><b>like every other mom, she told me it was just a dream. But only
I know that</b>
<br><b>it really happened for I was wide awake trying to get to sleep.</b>
<br><b>And to this very day I still haven't found out what that creature
was.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Is My House Haunted</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kristie.bishop@detroit.appnet.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Here is yet another story.&nbsp; This one happened just last night</b>
<br><b>I have always felt that there was something around me as I was growing
up.</b>
<br><b>I certainly hope that I don't have a supernatural being following
me.&nbsp; Even</b>
<br><b>in the house I grew up in I noticed things.&nbsp; From the sounds
of someone</b>
<br><b>walking up the stairs from the basement to the basement door opening
and</b>
<br><b>closing.&nbsp; Strange sounds from the basement and shadows.&nbsp;
My house was built</b>
<br><b>on to an old basement house.&nbsp; I think that there are ghosts
down there.</b>
<br><b>Next, I moved to an apartment.&nbsp; The people behind me always
commented on</b>
<br><b>feeling an evil presence there.&nbsp; I would get up in the morning
and turn my</b>
<br><b>fan off and my closet door would be closed.&nbsp; I would go and
take a shower</b>
<br><b>and come back out.&nbsp; My fan would be back on and my closet doors
would be</b>
<br><b>open.&nbsp; cupboards in my kitchen would be open and my little
cat would be</b>
<br><b>hiding under my bed.&nbsp; Things would constantly come up missing,
most of which</b>
<br><b>would never be found.&nbsp; I hated being in that apartment alone.&nbsp;
I always had</b>
<br><b>an uneasy feeling there.&nbsp; I was happy to move out!</b>
<br><b>I moved into a house 3 years ago.&nbsp; At first it was fine.&nbsp;
Lately I have been</b>
<br><b>noticing strange things.&nbsp; First, my fianc&eacute;'s car keys
came up missing.&nbsp; They</b>
<br><b>just disappeared off of out kitchen table and reappeared about 5
hours later</b>
<br><b>in the same spot where they were before.&nbsp; Things of the same
nature have</b>
<br><b>happened to other objects in our house.&nbsp; I have two cats.&nbsp;
Recently, they</b>
<br><b>have been acting very strange.&nbsp; My girl cat will sit in the
hallway and</b>
<br><b>stare at the wall.&nbsp; There is nothing there, I have checked
it out.&nbsp; When she</b>
<br><b>does this, my boy cat gets really weird.&nbsp; It's like he gets
the devil in his</b>
<br><b>eyes and he just starts going crazy.&nbsp; I use to think it was
the rips but it</b>
<br><b>is different now.&nbsp; I suggested that when my girl cat is sitting
staring at</b>
<br><b>the wall that we get a camera and start taking pictures.&nbsp; Maybe
something</b>
<br><b>will show up in them.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, back to last night .&nbsp; I was in my kitchen washing dishes</b>
<br><b>(where my sink is, I would be standing with my back to the door
and</b>
<br><b>windows).&nbsp; It was about 7:30 PM.&nbsp; My back door was open,
I had just put the</b>
<br><b>glass in my screen door for the winter.&nbsp; My girl cat was sitting
in front of</b>
<br><b>the door just staring off in to space.&nbsp; I started to hear a
tapping on the</b>
<br><b>door.&nbsp; My cat just started freaking out.&nbsp; My flood light
on the back of my</b>
<br><b>house suddenly turned on (it is operated by switch from the inside
of my</b>
<br><b>house).&nbsp; I started to get chills and the hair on the back of
my neck started</b>
<br><b>to stand up.&nbsp; I had that feeling like somebody was watching
me.&nbsp; My friend</b>
<br><b>went outside and looked all over the back yard (I have a 9 ft privacy
fence</b>
<br><b>with bushes on the other side, so it's not like someone could just
run</b>
<br><b>through or jump the fence).&nbsp; There was nobody there or walking
down the</b>
<br><b>street.&nbsp; Before I went to bed I went into my bathroom to brush
my teeth and</b>
<br><b>drink some water when I started to get that feeling again.&nbsp;
I turned the</b>
<br><b>light of and ran into my bedroom.&nbsp; I jumped in my bed and pulled
the covers</b>
<br><b>over my head.&nbsp; I turned and was laying on my stomach.&nbsp;
It felt like someone</b>
<br><b>was standing over me.&nbsp; I can't really explain the feeling I
had.&nbsp; I have</b>
<br><b>felt it before at my apartment and my parents house.&nbsp; It was
like a</b>
<br><b>fluttery, butterflies in my stomach feeling.&nbsp; I just laid there
and told</b>
<br><b>whatever it was to go away.&nbsp; After a couple of minutes the
fluttery feeling</b>
<br><b>was gone and I slept great.&nbsp; I don't know if it is in my head
or what.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>fianc&eacute;e thinks that I am nuts.&nbsp; Although, he admitted
feeling something at</b>
<br><b>our apartment.&nbsp; He is leaving for a week to go hunting.&nbsp;
I am afraid to be</b>
<br><b>in my house alone.</b>

<br><b>Imaginary Friends and Boogey Men, my story.</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: babyfett2@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When I was small, just past toddler, I had an "imaginary friend"
named</b>
<br><b>Bobby.&nbsp; Bobby was a very dark shadow with red glowing eyes
and bad things</b>
<br><b>always happened when he wanted to play, things would get wrecked,
like my</b>
<br><b>dad's self portrait, my cat got stuck in the ventilation system
and lots of</b>
<br><b>other things my dad attributes to me and Bobby.&nbsp; But my dad
knew what Bobby</b>
<br><b>was too, he knew he wasn't just an imaginary friend because he said</b>
<br><b>sometimes he could see it from the corner of his eye, he'd catch
these red</b>
<br><b>eyes staring at him, or feel a cold hand on his back, that sort
of thing.</b>
<br><b>We moved when I was five and Bobby couldn't leave, he was sort of
stuck, I'm</b>
<br><b>not sure why.&nbsp; Then there were no more wierd events.&nbsp;
We moved again.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>moved into this apartment where suddenly I became terrified of the
dark.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>room was at the very back of the house, at the southeast corner,
nearest the</b>
<br><b>yard of our next door neighbor.&nbsp; Our house, wasn't the problem,
it was</b>
<br><b>theres.&nbsp; For a while I kept seeing things, a ghostly figure
and I'd hear</b>
<br><b>things and I knew that whatever was outside my bedroom was very
sad and</b>
<br><b>lonely, but always very, very angry.&nbsp; One moment he wanted
to be my friend,</b>
<br><b>the next he wanted to hurt me, he had a very bad temper, but he
never could</b>
<br><b>get close for very long.&nbsp; Sometimes I'd start to have trouble
breathing, it</b>
<br><b>felt like the air was being squeezed out of me when I was laying
in my bed,</b>
<br><b>then my dog would jump up and start barking and it would stop.&nbsp;
It just got</b>
<br><b>madder and madder.&nbsp; And all of the sudden on day, it stopped.&nbsp;
Until I was</b>
<br><b>about 13 or 14 it had stopped.&nbsp; Then a friend of mine Amber
moved in next</b>
<br><b>door and another friend in the floor below her.&nbsp; We had a sleep
over one</b>
<br><b>night, in their backyard, I thought it'd be safe.&nbsp; We went
to go pick</b>
<br><b>flowers, because some wierd ones grew, from behind their garage(which
btw</b>
<br><b>was an old carriage house, unaccessible because of the raised railroad</b>
<br><b>tracks built over the road that had been there more than half a
century</b>
<br><b>ago).&nbsp; Anyway we started to go behind the garage and all three
of us froze,</b>
<br><b>I wasn't crazy, we all saw something.&nbsp; Something very angry
and now, very</b>
<br><b>awake.&nbsp; All I remember is being frozen for a moment and feeling
it, nose to</b>
<br><b>nose with us, it seemed bigger than before, alot bigger, he wanted
us to</b>
<br><b>come play, to come in the back with him and stay with him, but Heather,
who</b>
<br><b>only got angry at seeing it, grabbed us and told us we should go
in.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>ran.&nbsp; We left our stuff and we ran to our respective houses.&nbsp;
I slept in my</b>
<br><b>room that night, not well, because I could still hear it, my dog
kept</b>
<br><b>barking at it.&nbsp; He wanted me to come stay with him, he said
I was nice and</b>
<br><b>that he wouldn't have woken up again if we hadn't done something,
but I</b>
<br><b>don't know what.&nbsp; For a while things weren't so bad.&nbsp;
He stayed in his yard,</b>
<br><b>bugging us on occassion and I tried to pretend I didn't see anything,
it</b>
<br><b>worked for a while.&nbsp; During that winter strange things happened.&nbsp;
We found</b>
<br><b>wierd foot prints and marks in the snow, just animals I said, we
found</b>
<br><b>strange pictures in the fog on the glass, just the nieghbor boys,
my dog</b>
<br><b>barked at the ayrd the whole winter, every time he went outside.&nbsp;
I saw</b>
<br><b>little lights behind the garage and I know there is no electricity
in the</b>
<br><b>garage.&nbsp; That sort of thing went on all winter and spring.&nbsp;
The next summer</b>
<br><b>though, Amber got a ouija board.&nbsp; She started playing with
it alot.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>said that she had contacted something.&nbsp; She wanted to talk
to whatever was</b>
<br><b>in her yard.&nbsp; The problem was, she woke lots of things up.&nbsp;
That's how I</b>
<br><b>explain it anyways.&nbsp; I would go into her house and I started
to see things.</b>
<br><b>Lots of things.&nbsp; There were several "secret" room in her house.&nbsp;
A small</b>
<br><b>room that locks from the outside, behind the refrigerator, a door
that was</b>
<br><b>meant to match the wall, also with a lock on the outside, both the
landlord</b>
<br><b>didn't know about.&nbsp; One was in her apartment, one was in the
basement.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>could never shut her pantry door, plates and things would start
to smash</b>
<br><b>onto the floor and once a peanut butter jar slammed against the
wall and</b>
<br><b>shattered.&nbsp; Amber started to put tape recorders in there and
kept the door</b>
<br><b>shut, she wanted to make it talk to her, but that just made things
worse,</b>
<br><b>especially after she decided to use the ouija board in her house
again.</b>
<br><b>That room behind the refrigerator, I couldn't go in there when Amber
tried</b>
<br><b>to make me, it was so cold and dark and I heard crying, Amber didn't,
she</b>
<br><b>was to busy trying to find a tape recorder.&nbsp; But I heard a
soft weeping</b>
<br><b>sound and something kept pleading to be let out, Amber said I was
hearing</b>
<br><b>things.&nbsp; There was only one spirit in her apartment, I think
it was a child,</b>
<br><b>he always hid from Amber, because she tried to make him do things.&nbsp;
But I</b>
<br><b>saw him, he was so little and afraid, I tried to talk to it, but
he ran away</b>
<br><b>to that little room behind the refrigerator or to the pantry.&nbsp;
The real</b>
<br><b>problem IN the house was the basement.&nbsp; This is where stuff
happened that</b>
<br><b>all of us saw and felt and heard.&nbsp; Amber, myself(also named
Amber), Heather</b>
<br><b>and a friend of ours Rudaina decided to make a club house in the
basement.</b>
<br><b>This was a bad idea.&nbsp; Things weren't too bad at first, then
I discovered the</b>
<br><b>hidden room and we found, what looked like scratches, in the door
of that</b>
<br><b>room, like someone had been locked in.&nbsp; Things were ok for
a little while,</b>
<br><b>then Rudaina, who lived next door, could see the basement windows
from her</b>
<br><b>room, she claimed to see somthing in the windows, a women.&nbsp;
She said she</b>
<br><b>followed her into the basement once, but wouldn't step past the
door frame.</b>
<br><b>She said she saw bodies down there, bloody and hurt and then she
ran.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>wouldn't go back alone.&nbsp; Three of us, minus Heather, went into
the basement</b>
<br><b>one day and we were looking around and decorating when the door
slammed shut</b>
<br><b>and the knobs fell off.&nbsp; We were stuck down there and we tried
not to freak</b>
<br><b>out, but it was getting really cold(it was still summer, that one
where it</b>
<br><b>go so hot all those people died in chicago)and we started to hear
things.</b>
<br><b>Little whispers, but when I walked up to the door, there was a banging,
I</b>
<br><b>thought someone was on the other side, but when I peeked through
the key</b>
<br><b>hole, no one was there, but the banging on the door was.&nbsp; We
freaked out and</b>
<br><b>ran to one of the rooms and we heard a scratching from the one door
I had</b>
<br><b>found, we thought it was a rat, I opened it and there wasn't anyone
there,</b>
<br><b>just some things falling off the shelf, like it had been bumped.&nbsp;
Finally</b>
<br><b>Heather came home and we started to scream for her, it took a while,
the</b>
<br><b>door was locked and we had trouble finding the getting and getting
the knobs</b>
<br><b>back on.&nbsp; But finally we got out.&nbsp; We never went down
there again.&nbsp; Amber</b>
<br><b>started playing with the Ouija board more and after a couple of
days I</b>
<br><b>started to see things.&nbsp; There was a this shadow, it was Bobby,
I knew it</b>
<br><b>was, those same angry red eyes, him and several other silouhettes
were</b>
<br><b>there, Amber could see them sometimes, but usually she just said
it was a</b>
<br><b>trick of the light or something.&nbsp; But I knew I wasn't crazy.&nbsp;
Rudaina saw</b>
<br><b>them.&nbsp; I remember trying to go into her house once, up the
stairs and</b>
<br><b>something pulled me, I thought I slipped, I tried to go up again
and then I</b>
<br><b>saw it, shadowy arms tugging me down, it was Bobby.&nbsp; Amber
tried to talk</b>
<br><b>with it on the Ouija board and that just made things worse, what
she got was</b>
<br><b>that he was mad at me for leaving.&nbsp; That he was all alone with
the</b>
<br><b>roaches(the house I lived in when I was small was infested).&nbsp;
She asked for</b>
<br><b>his named and he said it was Bobby, Amber didn't know about that,
I didn't</b>
<br><b>tell her because she was the kind who would play pranks.&nbsp; After
a while I</b>
<br><b>would cross the street rather than walk in front of her house, it
was always</b>
<br><b>so could and I had trouble breathing sometimes, but Bobby couldn't
leave</b>
<br><b>Ambers house, I don't know why.&nbsp; But things only got worse
with my backyard</b>
<br><b>neighbor, I felt like something was sitting on my chest at night
sometimes,</b>
<br><b>squeezing out the air and my dog never stopped barking.&nbsp; For
the rest of</b>
<br><b>that summer I slept in the living room.&nbsp; Then after a few months,
the thing</b>
<br><b>in the backyard stopped.&nbsp; I still saw things on occassion,
then Heather</b>
<br><b>moved away and things got very quiet.&nbsp; She refuses to talk
about this stuff.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Amber moved away a year later and things were dead silent
again.&nbsp; I don't</b>
<br><b>know why.&nbsp; On and off that thing was around, the one in the
back yard, but I</b>
<br><b>just tried to ignore it.&nbsp; I couldn't figure out why it kept
coming and</b>
<br><b>going.&nbsp; Now I am 20 years old and I'm a nanny.&nbsp; I care
for two kids, one is</b>
<br><b>this beautiful 5 year old girl named Grace.&nbsp; I moved out of
my place in</b>
<br><b>March and things have been calm since.&nbsp; But before I moved,
for about the</b>
<br><b>last 2 or 3 months I was there, things were really bad.&nbsp; I
started to see</b>
<br><b>things again, just that one thing though.&nbsp; It seemed to have
claws when I</b>
<br><b>could see it, it was pissed and I could feel cold, sharp somethings
pushing</b>
<br><b>down on my shoulders and sometimes I felt like the air was being
squeezed</b>
<br><b>out of me.&nbsp; The little girl and I started to have nightmares
on the same</b>
<br><b>nights.&nbsp; In mine, this ghostly image I saw was rendering her,
slicing her up</b>
<br><b>because I had done something.&nbsp; Grace started having nightmares
about a</b>
<br><b>figure similar to Bobby, but he had claws like I saw in my nightmares.</b>
<br><b>Her's was taking her brother away and hurting me.&nbsp; She was
terrified of her</b>
<br><b>own house.&nbsp; She claimed that when I was around she could see
it and she</b>
<br><b>showed me one day and pointed to it and there it was, plain as day,
a dark</b>
<br><b>shadow with a red gleam.&nbsp; Well a friend of mine, Jerry, believes
in spirits</b>
<br><b>and the like and I knew I could talk to him.&nbsp; He came to my
house once, and</b>
<br><b>never again.&nbsp; He said he saw it and he got freaked out, he
said he felt</b>
<br><b>something try and claw his stomach, it was cold, and you know how
when you</b>
<br><b>put and ice cube on your skin it leaves a red mark when you take
it away</b>
<br><b>from a moment, well that was what was on his stomach, three long
marks.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>friend Colleen also came here twice, once with her husband and once
with a</b>
<br><b>friend and all of them claimed to see a shadow moving, it had a
strange red</b>
<br><b>gleam to it, all of them refuse to go to that old place, even when
I had to</b>
<br><b>move, the refused to help move me out, into a new place no problem,
but they</b>
<br><b>wouldn't step foot in that place.&nbsp; The said it was haunted.&nbsp;
Well in the</b>
<br><b>mean time Gracie was terrified, we both kept having nightmares on
the same</b>
<br><b>night.&nbsp; One day though, with the help of Colleen, I think I
figured out what</b>
<br><b>was going on.&nbsp; I had this teapot.&nbsp; A very old, little
brass teapot, I got it</b>
<br><b>when I was living back at that one roach infested house when I was
small.</b>
<br><b>That's when everything started.&nbsp; Each time I started seeing
that one thing,</b>
<br><b>is when the teapot was in my room, not packed away in the attack,
or broken</b>
<br><b>and needing to be fixed.&nbsp; I never figured out the conncection
until Grace</b>
<br><b>had this one dream about a teapot and asked me why it had my teapot.&nbsp;
She</b>
<br><b>described it to me perfectly, now mind you, she's never been to
me house,</b>
<br><b>those nightmares scared me.&nbsp; Well finally, shortly before I
moved, I snapped</b>
<br><b>the spout off the teapot, not too hard, considering it was superglued
on</b>
<br><b>from breaking several times. It's still in pieces at the old place.&nbsp;
But</b>
<br><b>things have stopped.&nbsp; The nightmares never came back, Gracie
wasn't scared</b>
<br><b>anymore.&nbsp; My father thinks that this teapot was fetter for
whatever it was</b>
<br><b>that was around all those years, and that it being broken or packed
away was</b>
<br><b>important, but I don't know.&nbsp; All I know is that, except for
that one</b>
<br><b>summer, where we all saw strange things, the thing I kept seeing
went away</b>
<br><b>went I wrecked the teapot.&nbsp; I know I'm not crazy.&nbsp; Because
I'm not the only</b>
<br><b>whose seen these things.&nbsp; As for Ambers house, I still won't
go in or near</b>
<br><b>that house, none of us will, especially Rudaina who still lives
next door.</b>
<br><b>I've tried to find out the history of the teapot and the houses.&nbsp;
A man,</b>
<br><b>after finding his wife and his best friend in best killed them then
shot</b>
<br><b>himself, he shot himself in what was my Ambers back yard, behind
the</b>
<br><b>carriage house, about 30 years ago.&nbsp; He lived directly across
the railroad</b>
<br><b>tracks from her.&nbsp; A woman named betty lived in Amber's house
for many years,</b>
<br><b>she died and only her and her neighbor, also deceased about 8 years
ago knew</b>
<br><b>the history of the houses.&nbsp; I don't know how to start to actually
research</b>
<br><b>them myself.&nbsp; As for the teapot, my parents are really sure
where it came</b>
<br><b>from, they think it was either from my Great Grand Mother or something
my</b>
<br><b>father picked up at an antique store.&nbsp; I've thought about taking
pictures of</b>
<br><b>the things I've seen, but I always forget to bring a camera.&nbsp;
I should</b>
<br><b>probably start carrying one with me.&nbsp; Maybe one day I'll get
up the nerve to</b>
<br><b>go back to Amber's and check out the basement.</b>

<p><b>I'm Not Afraid of Ghosts Anymore</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kaliluna@ameritech.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is a fairly long story, and I apologize, but that's how these
lifelong</b>
<br><b>things go :-)</b>
<br><b>I was five years old when we moved into the house in Brighton MI.
I don't</b>
<br><b>remember much about the house when I was that age, only that it
scared me to</b>
<br><b>look at the front of it because it looked like a face. There were
two</b>
<br><b>bedroom windows sticking out of the roof, each with a triangle gable
of it's</b>
<br><b>own. Beneath them was the slanted roof of the front porch, which
had windows</b>
<br><b>all around it and looked like teeth. The first I remember of the
hauntings,</b>
<br><b>I was about 8 years old and was playing at the neighbor's house.
She told me</b>
<br><b>a story about our two houses, which were about 200 yards apart.
She told me</b>
<br><b>they used to be one big house that a man had built for his wife
when they</b>
<br><b>got married. High on down the road, their daughter was getting married,
so</b>
<br><b>they split the house on one side to make a new house where ours
was. They</b>
<br><b>physically moved that part of the house over and built a new wall.</b>
<br><b>Apparently, this man was horrid to his wife and eventually killed
her by</b>
<br><b>abusing her, thus passing the house to a new owner. When I was about
10</b>
<br><b>years old I went over to my neighbors house to help her clean the
attic out.</b>
<br><b>She was finding all kinds of things from previous owners, including
a</b>
<br><b>beautiful (but dusty!) porcelain doll. The doll was wearing a burgundy
dress</b>
<br><b>and had dark brown hair, and those eyes that opened and closed.
My neighbor</b>
<br><b>didn't have a child old enough at the time to play with dolls, so
she asked</b>
<br><b>me if I would like to keep her. Of course I said yes! I took her
home and</b>
<br><b>set her in a small wood rocking chair I had had from when I was
younger. I</b>
<br><b>shared my room with two pretty mischeivious younger sisters (although
they</b>
<br><b>would tell it differently), so it came as no surprise to me the
next morning</b>
<br><b>to discover the doll was gone from the rocking chair. I assumed
one of them</b>
<br><b>had taken it, so I immediately went trouncing off to their room
to recover</b>
<br><b>her. Of course I listened to the innocent protests from both of
them and got</b>
<br><b>thoroughly annoyed when they continued to "lie" about it, so I gave
up and</b>
<br><b>went downstairs to have breakfast. About noon my neighbor called
and asked</b>
<br><b>if I would like to come help her clean the attic again that day,
and I said</b>
<br><b>okay. Then she casually asked me why I didn't take the doll when
I left the</b>
<br><b>day before. I am quite sure my face was white as a sheet when I
whispered to</b>
<br><b>her that I had in fact taken the doll and set it in my room. Of
course I</b>
<br><b>didn't want it back after she told me she found it back in the attic,
in the</b>
<br><b>very spot we had found it!</b>
<br><b>That house stands next to an empty field also. My sisters and I
used to play</b>
<br><b>in the field all the time, and the long grass was always flattened
in one</b>
<br><b>spot in the perfect shape of a square. My mother used to pass it
off as</b>
<br><b>"deer beds", and I believed her until one day I looked out the window
and</b>
<br><b>saw a house standing there with a girl walking around it in a long
dress. I</b>
<br><b>was getting pretty immune to things like that by this time so of
course I</b>
<br><b>walked out there, to see nothing there at all but grass....and a
blue</b>
<br><b>ribbon.</b>
<br><b>I think between the lights that went on and off, the doors that
would open</b>
<br><b>and shut all the time, and the very hairy man staring at me whenever
I awoke</b>
<br><b>at 3:30am has pretty much desensitized me to ghosts in my older
years,</b>
<br><b>although now I can tell by walking into a house whether or not there
is a</b>
<br><b>ghost there. I have gotten used to the feeling of being able to
feel them,</b>
<br><b>and tell if they are just there, or there and want you to know.</b>
<br><b>There were so many odd things about that house I couldn't possibly
list them</b>
<br><b>all, but now when you drive by it, the new owners have redone everything
and</b>
<br><b>it doesn't look like a face anymore, just a nice yellow house------with
a</b>
<br><b>very wicked history.</b>
<br><b>I wonder if they know???</b>

<p><b>I LIVED IN AN OLD BROWN STONE--NEVER REALLY BELIEVED IN GHOSTS.</b>
<br><b>I JUST ENTERTAINED THE IDEA WHEN BORED AND WANTING TO PLAY.</b>
<br><b>THE BROWN STONE WAS OLD. BUILT IN THE LATE 19TH EARLY 20TH CENTURY.&nbsp;
OUR</b>
<br><b>KITCHEN WAS ON THE THIRD FLOOR IN BETWEEN MY BEDROOM (I SHARED WITH
MY TWIN)</b>
<br><b>AND OUR PLAYROOM.&nbsp; THE LIVING ROOM AND EVERYTHING ELSE ETC
WAS ON OTHER</b>

I HEARD</b>
<br><b>EVERYONE INCLUDING MY DAD SPEAK OF SO- CALLED GHOSTS IN OUR HOUSE
I NEVER</b>

<p><b>Haunts from Down Under</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Caitlin.boyd@brokat.com.au</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have had experiences with ghosts before but never with one who
has been</b>
<br><b>quite as persistent as this one.&nbsp; I am interested in the tarot,
have read a</b>
<br><b>great deal on wicca practices (although I don't practice) and have
been told</b>
<br><b>by several clairvoyants that I am at least partly psychic.</b>
<br><b>Last weekend (Saturday night) my flatmate and I were home - had
been out the</b>
<br><b>night before and were lying on my bed talking and working out what
we were</b>
<br><b>doing.&nbsp; For interest and maybe of value, Saturday night was
the first night</b>
<br><b>of a full moon and it was also Remebrance Day for the ANZACS (Australian
&amp;</b>
<br><b>New Zealand soldiers from World War 2).&nbsp; Worthy of note is
that our</b>
<br><b>apartment is brand new - am not sure what the building was before.</b>
<br><b>I could see "something" - an energy bundle which was moving closer.&nbsp;
As it</b>
<br><b>came closer it was a very clear outline of an australian soldier
(they have</b>
<br><b>distinctive "diggers" hats) - my flatmate saw my face go white and
grabbed</b>
<br><b>my hand.&nbsp; As she did this she could also see the soldier and
we appeared to</b>
<br><b>raise some kind of energy around us - which the soldier was pushing
against.</b>
<br><b>The pressure of holding whatever energy it was up was putting raised</b>
<br><b>imprints into our hands and arms.&nbsp; My bedroom has double mirrored
doors on</b>
<br><b>the wardrobe and after a while there was mist/steam on the mirrors.&nbsp;
We left</b>
<br><b>the bedroom and the soldier came with us.&nbsp; In the courtyard
were several</b>
<br><b>more, although only one other came into the house and left quite
shortly.</b>
<br><b>After several hours of this soldier following us around the house
and it</b>
<br><b>seemed as though it was coming into us - the imprints which started
in our</b>
<br><b>hand continually moved up our arms (the imprint appeared to be a
four</b>
<br><b>pronged fork)- it was a conscious effort to push it out.&nbsp; After
several</b>
<br><b>hours of this we were feeling very drained and decided to go outside
for a</b>
<br><b>walk - however it followed and proceeded to push us away from the
apartment</b>
<br><b>and when we started heading back it was pushing against us going
back.</b>
<br><b>Eventually (close to sunrise) I cast a banishing spell and it seemed
to move</b>
<br><b>away - although not out of the house.&nbsp; We thought&nbsp; it
had gone from the</b>
<br><b>house last night however it is still in my bedroom - I can feel
its energy</b>
<br><b>(it seems to stay at the end of my bed or hover above me) and when
I woke up</b>
<br><b>at 3am this morning my mirrors were once again misted up.</b>
<br><b>Whilst I am prepared to have it in the house if we can't get rid
of it, I do</b>
<br><b>need for it to respect space and my bedroom needs to be "off limits"
-</b>
<br><b>particularly since it is disturbing my sleep and I have a professional
job</b>
<br><b>which I need to be able to focus on during the day.&nbsp; My preference
is not to</b>
<br><b>have to move - since we only moved in about 2-3 months ago.</b>

<p><b>Ghosts in my Home</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ShawnaNah@excite.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have reason to believe that there are ghosts in my home. There
have just</b>
<br><b>been way to many weird things going on here that there really is
no other</b>
<br><b>explanation for these things to be happening. We recently got stationed
in</b>
<br><b>Okinawa Japan.&nbsp; And shortly after we moved in we have heard
a few weird</b>
<br><b>things.</b>
<br><b>The first incident my 2 year old son came into my bedroom early
in the</b>
<br><b>morning and he crawled in bed with me and looked behind me, he said
cheese</b>
<br><b>as if someone were taking his picture, he turned my head and said
cheese</b>
<br><b>mommy cheese so I turned my head around and said cheese&nbsp; thinking
nothing</b>
<br><b>of it, then he says wait, wait, wait, wait gets off of my bed and
runs</b>
<br><b>down the hall. He then comes back to the doorway of my bedroom and
says</b>
<br><b>mommy where did he go?</b>
<br><b>The second thing we noticed, we heard knocking in the boys playroom,
well</b>
<br><b>where the sound was coming from someone would have had to have been
knocking</b>
<br><b>through our bedroom closet, there is no other way. And nothing that
we could</b>
<br><b>see was there.we just all heard knocking. The knocking noises have
happened</b>
<br><b>more than once.</b>
<br><b>The third incident, my 5 year old son came into my bedroom around
3am and</b>
<br><b>woke me up and&nbsp; asked me to shut my music off because he couldnt
get to</b>
<br><b>sleep. Well, I wasnt listening to musicand I told him I wasnt
playing any</b>
<br><b>music, what was he talking about? So he takes me into their bedroom
and I</b>
<br><b>heard the sound of a music box, I looked under the bed and all around
the</b>
<br><b>room to see where this music was coming from. I have a dresser pushed
in</b>
<br><b>front of their closet. I moved the dresser out and opened the closet
up,</b>
<br><b>there was nothing in the closet but you could hear the music plain
as day</b>
<br><b>the music was definitely coming from the closet.</b>
<br><b>The fourth thing that happened was, I thought I heard the noise
of a door</b>
<br><b>open in the middle of the night. My husband works nights, so I figured
he</b>
<br><b>was coming home for a bite to eat or something. I walked out into
the living</b>
<br><b>room and I see a shadow standing in the walkway, I called out my
husbands</b>
<br><b>name and there was no answeras I walked closer the shadow disappeared.
I</b>
<br><b>noticed it was cold over there and the front door was locked, no
one was</b>
<br><b>there.</b>
<br><b>And most recently, by far the scariest thing yet isI was taking
a shower</b>
<br><b>and the water and the room gets ice cold. I go to get out of the
tub. There</b>
<br><b>is water all over the floor and on the sides of the tub are two
1975</b>
<br><b>pennies my brother died this August 2000, and he was born in 1975,
at first</b>
<br><b>I thought it was a sick joke someone was playing on me. But my husband
was</b>
<br><b>at work and my two sons were sound asleep.</b><b></b>

<p><b>I Believe</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: CandieHalli00@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I do believe in the supernatural. I have had several experiences
with this</b>
<br><b>subject. At firstI thought I was imagining these things or that
I was crazy.</b>
<br><b>I later learned that I was not the only one that was experiencing
these</b>
<br><b>things. For as long as I can remember my grandfather's house has
been</b>
<br><b>haunted. I and many other family members have seen, and heard stranges</b>
<br><b>things. I know for a fact that there are three ghosts living in
the house</b>
<br><b>with my family. There is a woman and two men. They never have physically</b>
<br><b>harmed us or done anything bad so we have been believing that they
are there</b>
<br><b>to protect us. They do things like open and shut doors repeatedly,
the rooms</b>
<br><b>get cold at times, the lights flicker, we hear voices, etc. One
time in</b>
<br><b>particular I was sitting in my mother's room watching T.V.. I suddenly
heard</b>
<br><b>someone call out my name.&nbsp; At first I thought I was just hearing
things, but</b>
<br><b>it happened again, and then again. I knew that no one was home so
I thought</b>
<br><b>it might be someone at the door. I got up to check the door. It
was closed,</b>
<br><b>and when I looked out there was no sign of anyone. Another time,
more recent,</b>
<br><b>my little sister had a lamp that was sitting on her dresser. She
had draped a</b>
<br><b>little blanket over it so that her room would be dim. My mom told
her that it</b>
<br><b>might start a fire, but my sister didn't listen. As she was sitting
on her</b>
<br><b>bed about to go to sleep, the lamp flew off the dresser and broke
in half. My</b>
<br><b>little sister has told me many times that sometimes at night when
she is</b>
<br><b>sleeping she will look up and see the two men sitting there watching
her.</b>
<br><b>Everyone that comes to visit has experienced some sort of wierd
happenings. I</b>
<br><b>don't know why they are there, or even who they are. I have often
wondered</b>
<br><b>that. I do know that they did not start haunting the house till
after my</b>
<br><b>grandmother passed away.</b>
<br><b>Another experience was at my mother's boyfriends house. I was sitting
on a</b>
<br><b>chair in the corner of the living room, and from that chair you
could see the</b>
<br><b>bathroom mirror. My moms' boyfriend's sister was sitting with me.
It was late</b>
<br><b>at night, and we were just watching a movie. Suddenly from the corner
of my</b>
<br><b>eyes I saw a white light coming from the bathroom. I turned to look,
and I</b>
<br><b>saw a white face in the mirror starring at me. Of course my reaction
was that</b>
<br><b>I was seeing things, so I tapped the girl's lap that was sitting
with me. I</b>
<br><b>asked her if she saw it, and she said yes. She looked harder and
said that it</b>
<br><b>looked like her grandfather. I got scared and ran to the couch to
sit by my</b>
<br><b>mom's friend. After a couple of minutes I heard a knock on the door.
I told</b>
<br><b>my mom's boyfriend, and he told me to get it. I opened the door,
and standing</b>
<br><b>there infront of me was a huge German Shepard. I got scared and
ran to tell</b>
<br><b>my mom and her boyfriend. My mom's boyfriend's mother advised us
to set food</b>
<br><b>out for it, and leave the door open so it could come in. We did
as she said</b>
<br><b>and I ran back to the couch. The dog did not touch the food, instead
came</b>
<br><b>into the house. He went into every room in the house except that
bathroom. He</b>
<br><b>just stood at the door growling. The dog stayed there all night
and in the</b>
<br><b>morning it was gone. We never saw that dog again. I don't know what
the</b>
<br><b>meaning of all that was, or even what was going on. I just know
from that day</b>
<br><b>on I never used the bathroom there.</b>
<br><b>I have had many more experiences, but I won't bore you with all
of them</b>

<p><b>Grandmothers Apartment</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: AmdGdwn@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Anyway&nbsp; this happened when I was in 8th grade ( I am now in
12th)and&nbsp; it</b>
<br><b>scared me pretty bad though a few things&nbsp; kinda weirded me
out. My mother and</b>
<br><b>grandmother had left&nbsp; for the evening. I&nbsp; had just sat
down on the couch to</b>
<br><b>watch some tv when I got a craveing for some chocolate. I had&nbsp;
brought a</b>
<br><b>butterfinger candy bar. I should state at this time the&nbsp; formation
of the</b>
<br><b>kitchen&nbsp; on one side is&nbsp; the oven and refridgerator and
on the other is the</b>
<br><b>sink and&nbsp; counter top. I had&nbsp; just taken the butterfinger
outta the fridge</b>
<br><b>when I heard the tv turn off ,I set the&nbsp; candy bar&nbsp; (not
yet opened) on the</b>
<br><b>oven an went out to the liveing room to turn on the tv again. I
was already</b>
<br><b>freaked out about the&nbsp; fact the tv turned off somehow. I was
alone in the</b>
<br><b>house might I add. I came back into the kitchen&nbsp; seting on
the other side of</b>
<br><b>the kitchen by the sink was my&nbsp; candy bar, now open with a
bite out of it.</b>
<br><b>At this point&nbsp; I figured either I had forgotten I had&nbsp;&nbsp;
tken a bite outta the</b>
<br><b>candy bar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( which I knew was not possible
cause I knew I had not opened</b>
<br><b>it) or I had a spirit in the house who had the&nbsp; a case of the
chocolate</b>
<br><b>munchies also. I really did'nt mind the ghost being there at that
point. but</b>
<br><b>things&nbsp; got creepier&nbsp; as the night progressed.</b>
<br><b>Right after&nbsp; I found the candy bar open with a bite out of
it I heard the tv</b>
<br><b>turn off in the living room again.now I was getting a little scared.I
should</b>
<br><b>also state my grandmothers&nbsp; apartment building is a security
building. I then</b>
<br><b>turned the tv back on and soon the buzzer ( in order to get into
my</b>
<br><b>grandmothers building you have to buzz yourself in) started buzzind
at least</b>
<br><b>40 times I went over to it and&nbsp; hit the "talk" button I think
and asked who</b>
<br><b>was there.........noone answered. the buzzing continued for about
2 more</b>
<br><b>mins.&nbsp; while it buzzed for thise 2&nbsp; min I went to the
tv and turned it to</b>
<br><b>channel 60&nbsp; so I could see what the security cameras were picking
up...noone</b>
<br><b>was there at the buzzers. I was extremely relieved once the buzzing
stoped.</b>
<br><b>the&nbsp; turned off&nbsp; by itself one final time and I again
turned it back on. the</b>
<br><b>final&nbsp; frightening thing&nbsp; happened about 4 min later.
the phone began to ring</b>
<br><b>(this was during the time when I never picked up the phone I let
the</b>
<br><b>answering machine take messages)the phone rang the usual amount
of times then</b>
<br><b>the answering machine kicked in what I heard n the machine scaredme</b>
<br><b>completely. It was a noise resembleing a machine gun. I picked up
the phone</b>
<br><b>and hung it up and picked up again........ the noise was now on
the phone. I</b>
<br><b>unplugged the phone at the base and&nbsp; waited a min&nbsp; the
plugged it back in.</b>
<br><b>the noise was still there.I ten unplugged the phone at the wall
and replugged</b>
<br><b>it.......the noise still there. I hung up the phone and picked up
again the</b>
<br><b>noise was still there . just then my parents walk in&nbsp; the&nbsp;
apartment......the</b>
<br><b>noise was now gone and regular dial tone was in it's place.&nbsp;
it scared me so</b>
<br><b>bad. ever since then I am always scared when I am home alone there
( which is</b>
<br><b>every friday and saturday)but&nbsp; nothing that scary has ever
happened again.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Old Lincoln</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SwitchyardSam@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>During the summer of '99, me and my friend used to ride on the bike
trail</b>
<br><b>just about every day. I'd call him up, then meet him at his house.
But there</b>
<br><b>was this one road I had to go on to get there. It's not the road
that scared</b>
<br><b>me, it was what was on it. I was riding on the street, when I looked
over to</b>
<br><b>the side of the road and I saw an old, beat up Lincoln from the
1970's. It</b>
<br><b>had rust all over it, and it didn't sound that good either. There
was a guy</b>
<br><b>driving it, he parked it on the side of the road by his house and
got out.</b>
<br><b>Then, he opened up the back door, pulled out about 3 big boxes,
and walked</b>
<br><b>towards his house. Then, the car's door slammed shut by itself.
The guy said</b>
<br><b>"Thanks", and went in his house. I don't know of any little device
that you</b>
<br><b>can buy to make a car do that, but if there isn't something like
that, there</b>
<br><b>was something wrong there. I rode on to my friend's house. About
4 days</b>
<br><b>later, I was riding back from my friends house on my bike. It was
getting</b>
<br><b>dark, and I saw the old Lincoln parked on the side of the road as
usual. As I</b>
<br><b>rode by it, all the lights on it flashed twice, all at once(even
the ones on</b>
<br><b>the inside). I sped up and rode home, I was scared a lot, because
there was</b>
<br><b>no one in the car. After that, nothing really happened, until a
couple weeks</b>
<br><b>after the lightshow. I was riding by as usual, and when I saw the
car on the</b>
<br><b>side of the road, with the engine running and no one behind the
wheel. It</b>
<br><b>revved up three times. I rode like lightning, that scared the piss
out of me.</b>
<br><b>I only saw the car once or twice after that. I told my friend about
it, he</b>
<br><b>was the only one who believed me. But I did see it once more, on
the</b>
<br><b>highway...</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Dad is still Here</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: h_3@prodigy.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I believe in ghosts but to my knowledge have never seen one until
recently.</b>
<br><b>My father passed away suddenly in February 2000 from a lethal arythmia
(it effect the lower part of the heart). According to the doctors he didnt
suffer any pain and didnt know he was dying, it apparently took all of
3 minutes for him to pass away.</b>
<br><b>At first mom and I didnt pay attention to what was going on, but
then it want beyond reasonable explanation. One night my mom went to bed
early she was in there for about 10 or 15 minutes when she came back downstairs.
She told me that dad was upstairs; according to her she had laid down when
she felt the bed shake slightly, then she felt someone lay down next to
her she was ready to jump out of bed when she felt a hand on her thigh.
Whenever my mom was upset my dad would do that to comfort her.</b>
<br><b>I have converted one of the bedrooms into a computer room and it
was a habit of his to go to bed early and every night he would open the
door and poke his head in the room and tell me goodnight and he loves me.
Since his death he still comes into my room to tell me he loves me.</b>
<br><b>Twice I have heard the front door open and close; it usually happens
around 6:00pm when my dad would come home from work. Also on my birthday
I woke up at 5:00am and had the feeling to go downstairs. When I got there
I noticed the fan on; this is Michigan in the middle of winter here there
is no reason for the fan to be on. I figure it was my dads way of saying
Happy Birthday.</b>
<br><b>There is a message on the answering machine from my dad, a month
after he passed. Actually he is kind of singing "I outta go". Ironically
my mom had been singing just a little while before and in the song she
sing "I outta go".</b>
<br><b>There are so many other things that have happened since he passed
but I will end the story here.</b>
