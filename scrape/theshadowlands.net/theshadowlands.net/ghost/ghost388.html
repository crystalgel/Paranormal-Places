<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This past May I had
purchased the book Spirits of St. Louis and my friend had come to visit me.
After reading several stories, we decided to "check out" one of the
sites that had the most stories: <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">West
  Cabanne Place</st1:address></st1:Street>. One day in the afternoon we went to
<st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">W. Cabanne PL.</st1:address></st1:Street><span style="">&nbsp; </span>which is off of Delmar east of the Delmar
Loop in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">St. Louis</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">MO.</st1:State></st1:place> Upon arriving to this cul du sac, my
friend had an extreme feeling of sadness. I had a very eerie feeling. This
street is lined with historic mansions that are now run down. At the end of the
cul du sac are abandoned cars with flat tires. Several of the large homes
appeared to be vacant. What I thought was very strange, though, was the fact
that there were no "for sale" signs. After slowly driving down the
street and eventually parking for about 10 minutes, we saw some of the
residents and my friend began talking to one of them. I was focusing my
attention on their conversation, when from behind and to the left of me I heard
a man's voice yell out. I could not understand what was said but I assumed
someone was calling to the group of residents congregated to our right. Curious
as to where the voice originated, I looked back in its direction. I saw no one
on my left at all. Needless to say I was ready to leave and have never returned
to W t <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Cabanne Place</st1:address></st1:Street>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It has been so much fun
reading through the ghost stories!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
have never experienced and ghost myself,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>but my dad has told me lost of ghost stories about his old<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"haunted house".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the story of my dad's house that he
used to live in while he was in college at Virginia Tech in the late 70's. It
was an old farmhouse that had been split up into apartments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The apartments all shared a kitchen and
common living area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house was
located in the small town of <st1:City w:st="on">Newcastle</st1:City> <st1:State w:st="on">Virginia</st1:State>, which was about 20 minutes outside of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Blacksburg</st1:place></st1:City>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are some of the strange things that
happened in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He lived there
with two other guys that were also students at VA Tech.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the things they all noticed were
footsteps on the old creaky steps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
steps were located right next to the front door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They would hear the door open and close at
night and then hear someone walking halfway up the steps, then the footsteps
would stop and there would never be anyone there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My dad said that this never bothered them
much if they were all home, but it was enough to really freak you out if you
were there by yourself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the
roommates was an avid chess player and used to always have a chess board out in
the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day he had set the
board up and gone into the kitchen to get a drink.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he came back some of the pieces had been
moved around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was the only one in the
house when this happened. No one had ever seen the ghost until one of the roommate's
girlfriends had come in from out of town to visit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was on a weekend and my dad and the
bsp;the third roommate were out at a party and didn't get back until next
morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently the girlfriend had
gone to bed early because she had been tired out by her trip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her boyfriend had opted to stay up and watch
tv.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The room she was sleeping in had an
old fireplace in it that had been bricked up for years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The landlord had decided to renovate the
fireplace and had had some men come that week to remove the brick.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Around 11:00 pm the girlfriend woke up
because the room was freezing and reached down to get a blanket that was at the
foot of the bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She looked up to see an
old man with a beard bending over next to the fireplace.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He smiled at her and pointed up the
chimney.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When my dad and the third
roommate got back the next morning the girl was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They assumed that she and her boyfriend had
gotten into a fight or something like that until he told them she had seen the
ghost and it had frightened her so bad she had left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All three of them checked in the fireplace to
see what the ghost was pointing at and never found anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My dad moved out of the house a few months
after this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My parents still live in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">blacksburg</st1:place></st1:City> and I've
driven past this "haunted house" many times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've always wanted to knock on the door and
see if the ghost is still there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">One winter night, many years
ago around midnite, shortly after my step-brother Mickey and I had turned in
for the night, after watching wrestling on TV . <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Back then, the old black and
white TV was not the 24 hour a day luxury we have today, and the few stations
we could pick up on the elaborate roof-top antenna <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>and <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We, along with my father and
stepmother lived in an old wood bungalow where Mickey and I shared an
unfinished attic apartment crammed with old relics.The room was low and only
about 7 feet between the attic floor and the peak of the roof rafters an
decking. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Mickey had just crawled into
his bed which was beside mine, and I was standing up taking my clothes off with
my head about a foot<span style="">&nbsp; </span>or less from the
roof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Suddenly we heard the heavy
tread of footsteps coming along the roofpeak toward the area where I was
standing. Then all of a sudden this person slipped and commenced rolling down
the roof and over the room where my father slept.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Dad hollerd up, "what's
going on up there, who's making all the racket"? I shouted back,
"someone just fell off the roof"!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We then ran down stairs,
meeting Dad and then running outside to the place where the person would have
landed on the ground, which was covered with snow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We were shocked when we
didn't find an injured, or dead person lying on the ground, as the roof was
very steep, similar to that of a chalet, and the two or three inches of snow
would have provided little or no protection to a person falling thirty feet or
more from the peak of the roof to the ground.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I then walked several times
around the house, Dad and Mickey having gone in, checking to see if there were
any signs of disturbance, or footprints in the snow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Finding nothing, I then went
inside to join the family and together we discussed the unexplainable incident
til the wee hours of the morning.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I had a beautiful<span style="">&nbsp; </span>rare black &amp; white Lhaso dog who crossed
June 1st last year....Actually he was murdered by a Vet ... he has told me
through more than one Medium...<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I found Bo Bo in my laundry
basket where he was born.....immagine my surprise when I went to do laundry and
there was the love of my life .......We were constant companions form then
on...<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My first contact with Bo Bo
after he crossed....I was awaken by his barking...I knew where he was, standing
up in the chair looking out the window by the Christmas Tree..it was his
warning bark....I sleeply thought .. he'll come back to bed in a few minutes,
probably a wondering dog outside...the next morning while making coffee it
dawned on me that he had crossed over.......I almost dropped the coffee
can......I wasn't asleep, he woke me.... Another time he woke me licking my
hand,,,,I petted him said good boy and went back to sleep....the next day
astonished again....I have<span style="">&nbsp; </span>caught
glimpses of him in the house from time to time....I have felt him get into bed
when I do, (as he always did)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he seems
to be in his place in the car as always...This could be deep grief on my part
but I don't really think so....As I had another dog<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lady who awoke me with-in the same week as Bo
Bo did.......she had raised up on the bed with her front paws and nuzzled my
face, this woke me and I petted her gave her a hug, turned over and went back
to sleep.......The next morning I was dumbfounded....Lady crossed some 15 years
ago.....!!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If someone has any idea on
what is happening to me let me know..... I have to assume it was Spiritual visitations
and a very special Christmas present .......and I can truthfully say I have
buried people with less pain than I experienced<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>when I had to give up my Bo Bo Bear.....not that God called him but that
he was indeed murdered as a revenge on something Bo nor I had actually done<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">If it is all right I'd like
to share a story that happened to me. It was at school and I was at after
school band rehearsals. My bad director had left his stand to answer the phone
in his office and was half way across the room when the chair on the directors
riser moved and fell off all by its self. No one was near it and every one was
looking at it at the time. what makes it very creepy is that a few days ago a
former band member passed away in his bed and we were just find out about it.
Every one still is freaked but I think that it was the boy who had passed on,
letting us know that he was still here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The sounds of someone
breathing in bed next to me woke me up around 3:00AM this morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The problem is&#8230;I live alone and the only pet
I have is a bird that is caged in another part of my apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I lay motionless for a few minutes listening
to the even contented breathing of someone in a very deep sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I finally got up the courage to sit up in
bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I listened for another minute or
two, trying to discern if there was something else in my room that could be
making the noise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was
nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both windows were closed and no
appliance was on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The breathing
continued until I got out of bed and turned on my light and my television.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m assuming I woke &#8220;it&#8221; up because the
breathing stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sat in the middle
of my bed watching the re-broadcast of the 11:00PM news and the early East
Coast news broadcasts until my alarm went off at 5:00AM.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I called around to family and friends to make
sure everyone was okay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;ve been known
to ask about the wellbeing of people who had died a few minutes before my
call.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say my family hates
when my name pops up on the Caller ID early in the morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was happy to find everyone well, but a bit
freaked out about my early morning slumber party guest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This experience happened
when I was 20 years old and a sophomore in college, so it was almost four years
ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I lived in the oldest dorm hall on
campus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night, I was in my room
asleep, my roommate was staying at her boyfriend's house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was sleeping and was woken up by a loud
crash, like something fell off the wall or from the shelves we had in our
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From my bed, I could see into our
closet, which was a walk in closet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
didn't have my glasses on, so I couldn't see very well, but my bedside clock
read 5:15, and the closet light was on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I saw who I took to be my roommate standing in there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I figured, given the time, she was drunk and
dropped something, so I rolled over and went back to sleep. The next morning, I
woke up around 11, finding the closet light still on, the door to my room
unlocked, and my roommate not home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
she got back later that day I asked if she had come home that night around 5,
and she said she was at her boyfriend's all night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The ghost, however, seemed
to be concentrated only at one end of the room, being in the closet (it made
things fall from our shelves in there all the time) and my roommate's
desk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The desk lamp that was there would
randomly shake without reason, hitting against the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, we've had our RA, who lived right across
the hall from us, tell us she heard noises coming from our room when my
roommate andI had gone home for the weekend and our room was empty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The door would lock when my roommate or I was
alone in the room, and we'd have to unlock it to get out, when we'd come back
from the bathroom or being gone for only a minute or two, we'd find ourselves
locked out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We'd both be in a part of
the room away from the door or window and still feel a cold draft quickly by
us, the constant feeling of someone watching us or behind us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We only lived here for one year, but we were
still glad to move out of there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My name is Scott and I am an
amateur Ghost Hunter from <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Youngstown</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">Ohio</st1:State></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have a strange experience I would like to
share with you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not happen during
an investigation but rather when my mind wasn&#8217;t even pondering about the
paranormal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the early morning of
September 28th 2005 when I was awoken from my sleep by a woman&#8217;s voice calling
my name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first I believed it to be my
mother calling my name as to wake me up because I was late for school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as I found out it was only 5:30AM.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I proceeded to get up out of bed and walk to
the edge of the steps and I looked down into the darkness of the hallway
below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I yelled back, WHAT?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I noticed the dark figure of my dog, Jax,
sitting at the bottom of the steps wagging his tail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I decided that I must have been dreaming and
went back to bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My alarm sounded at 6:05AM
and I went downstairs to grab a shower.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I dried myself off, got dressed and laid on the couch in the family room
to relax and watch a little TV before going to school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard my step-dad come in from outside and
soon after I heard my mother crying hysterically.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had no idea what the matter could be and
asked her what was wrong?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She continued
to pace around the house sobbing and kept telling me to wait until finally I learned
of the tragedy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She looked at me and I
could see the sorrow in her eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jax
was hit by a car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in shock and
asked if he was okay&#8230;my step dad looked at me and said No, he is dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn&#8217;t believe it&#8230;.it was just the last
thing I would have ever expected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
day was one of the worst days of my life and I felt very guilty for his death
because I knew that if I would have gotten up at 5:30 I would have let him
outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead my Step-dad let Jax
outside at 6:00AM and as fate would have it he was hit by a car and the driver
didn&#8217;t even stop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was killed instantly
but I can never seem to get that guilt out of my mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just maybe if I would have let him out at
5:30 he may still be alive.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
looking back on that horrible morning I always think about that woman calling
my name&#8230;I strongly believe it was someone from beyond trying to save Jax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even someone from beyond couldn&#8217;t stop
what was meant to happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I believe this
voice from beyond could only be my great-grandmother who past away in august
2005.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We dearly loved her as she did us
and was simply trying to save one of our family members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I will remember this for the rest of my
life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I myself have been through
almost all of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">fairview</st1:place></st1:City>
many times, i know the place pretty well. Rumors circulate of underground
tunnels and torture chambers, though recently i have come across the
underground tunnels, I have never found any torture chambers. We have not gone
through the tunnels enough to be sure that there isnt, but from what i have
seen in that place...it would make sense. Inside the tunnels there is a dead
end that recently has been bricked, for a reason unkown as of now, we will soon
find out what's behind that wall. Stories of walls bleeding and chairs moving
may be true, but I dont think the haunting is that extreme, we have seen things
that may or may not have been ghosts, but when you see something like that, it
makes you wanna find more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">my story begins in
sheffield, when i was 16 years old, and had just moved out my grandma's house
into a hostel which was built next to the burngreave cemetary, one night i was
waiting for my now husband to come home, i was laying on my bed wen i started
falling to sleep then all of a sudden i saw a black shadowy figure stood at the
side of my bed staring at me a couple of seconds later my husband knocked on
the door to let him in and the figure disapeared. a couple of months after i
moved out the hostel and went to live with my aunt who just lived up the road
from the hostel, when one night i was laying on the settee i fell asleep with
the tv on, i woke up to someone touching my leg but as i opened my eyes no one
was there and the tv had switched off. another time one of my aunts friends was
staying the night and also fell asleep on the settee and woke up to someone
touching her leg, when we all woke up the next day she told us what happened
and i told her that it also happened to me we were both shaken by our
experiences.we used to call the spirit mr brown but my aunt has said from i
left the house nothing since has happened......<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">then when i was 18 i got my
own flat, it was also situated across from the cemetary and across the car park
was the church, this flat was a modern flat built in the early 90s with all the
mod cons, when one night i was laying in my bed when i saw the same black
figure stood by the side of me, and as it saw i could see it it ran to the
bottom of my bed and disapeared also strange things would happen like i would
be stood washing my pots when i would feel a presence behind me as if someone
was there but when i turned around no one was there. one time my husband run
the bath, he didnt get in it straight away, when he came into the living room
and asked me if i had got in the bath, i said i hadnt and when i went into the
bathroom to have a look the bath had been emptied and the plug placed back on
the side of the bath, as i was confused with what was going on i visited the
church across the car park i spoke to the vicar about what had been going on
and she said that the flats had been built on the church graveyard and that
many passed and present residents had also experienced strange things going
on.....<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hello. I really enjoy your
website and decided to write about my own experiences. I am 37 years old and
live in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Indpls</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Ind.</st1:State></st1:place> My husband and I bought the house we
live in 3 years ago. We were told from the very beginning that it was haunted
by the previous owner's husband who passed away in the dining room. Shortly
after moving in, I could feel a presence in the house. One night, I was walking
through the kitchen with a laundry basket ready to go down to the basement to
do laundry when I felt someone push me. I literally flew across the room into
the back door hitting the doorknob which left a huge bruise on my left
shoulder. I turned around thinking that my husband was behind me and getting
ready to yell at him when I saw him sitting in his chair in the living room. He
had a very puzzled look on his face and asked what happened. I told him that I
felt someone push me. He said that I must have tripped. I know better. There
have been countless times when we hear someone walking up and down the stairs
when either everyone is in bed or gathered in the living room. My husband has
heard what he thinks are the kids up talking and playing in the middle of the
night when they are fast asleep. Just recently in the past 2 weeks, I have had
strange things happen to me. We just got a new puppy and the first night we had
him, I was "elected" to stay downstairs with him. As new puppies do,
this one kept whining whenever I would put him in his basket to sleep. At about
4am he finally went to sleep and I put him in his basket and went to sit in my
chair in the living room. I no sooner had sat down when I felt a coldness sweep
over me and clear as a bell heard a voice in my ear say"It's ok now, I'm
here. I then felt hands on my chest and um breasts and could literally see my
nightshirt moving. This thing was molesting me!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could not move or even scream. I mentally
started reciting the Lord's Prayer and it stopped. I jumped up out of the chair
and went upstairs to wake my husband. I actually had fingerprints on my chest.
My husband was so groggy from sleep that he could only mutter for me to go to
bed. I did not go to sleep for fear of being touched again. The next morning, I
left for work. There is a set of train tracks that I cross that hardly ever has
a train on them. I was driving behind a rust colored pickup when I heard a
train whistle. It startled me because I wasn't used to seeing trains on this
track. I looked to my right and could see the train. In front of me, the truck
was not slowing down. There are no flashing lights, crossing gate, or stop sign
at this railroad crossing. I started honking my horn and yelling out loud for
the truck to stop. By this time I was about 50 ft from the tracks and I saw the
train right in front of me. The truck continued on to the tracks and just as
the train would have hit its passenger side the train VANISHED!!!!. I slammed
on my brakes not believing what I had just seen and barely avoided getting rear-ended
from the guy behind me who I am sure thought that I was some idiotic driver. My
husband and I have swore that we have seen one of the kids walk into a room
when they are actually upstairs or in another part of the house. We live in an
area that used to be called Lynhusrt Additions. I have not found any info on
this area and would be interested in finding out anything that could help us
figure out what is going on. Thank you for your time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

few strange occurences in it. One night I was on the computer in the
"scary room" and my dog Mia came in and stared at something behind me
and and whined and ran out. I tried to get her back in the room and she wouldnt
come back in. My dad said that one time when I was asleep he saw a guy come
from the "scary room" again and go into my room. He got up and ran to
check on me but he couldnt find anybody. We have an attic and you can hear
footsteps at night sometimes when were all in bed. We took a picture one time
and saw a distint orb int he photo when me and my friend were sitting on the
couch with no reflective items around. Experiences still happen today but not
as as often.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">So it's 1 o'clock in the
morning, and im up watching a movie in bed. i have all the nessesary supplies.
my snacks, my drink, my remotes and my mobile phone. all of which are located
atop my bedside table about a metre (3ft) away. im enjoying my late night
screening when the home cordless phone rings. which is odd for 2 reasons. no
one ever rings on my home phone, and secondly its 1 in the morning! i drag
myself hastely down the hall to find the little cordless phone, which isnt in
is craddle... wierd again... anyway, i find the thing after a total of 5 rings,
so not long at all, and im about to pick up when half way through a ring, it
stops. i have to say, when your dragged outta bed at 1 in the morn and the
person who rings hangs up, your upset. so i called the missed call service and
waited for the number. as the pre-recorded operator rattled off the numbers, i
thought to myself 'hey, they sound a little familiar...' so i rang them back.
after waiting for the connection to take place i hear the ring through the
receiver... and from my room. i made my way up to the bed side table, looked at
my mobile (dared not touch it) and sure enough... there displayed on the
outside screen... an incoming call... home. home was ringing the phone that
hung up only seco s ago, home was ringing my mobile, my mobile that i knew to
be closed shut and unable to make any type of call at all...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hi I've been reading for a
few months now and figured it was time to write in my experience. It happened
when I was about 12 (1979). I believed in ghosts as I do now although had not
had any experiences up until then. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It happened like this, for
some reason I wanted my Mom's attention, at the time my Dad and she were
planning on remodeling their restaurant and on this particular occasion they
were busy going over paperwork. My mom ended up snapping at me because I kept
bugging her. Being the normal hormonal 12 year old I stomped upstairs to my
room and sat down for a good cry and pity party. I remembered I had cigarettes
for some reason all though I never smoked them...so I decided to show her and
light up a cigarette. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Something made me look up
and leaning into the partially open door to my room was a little girl of about
10...she was holding onto the doorknob and leaning in laughing
mischeviously...(like you would expect a little sister to do to her older
sister as she is eavesdropping)...I was shocked to say the least. All of a
sudden she straightens slightly and looks suprised, like she just realized I
could see her...her laughter dissolved into a look of uh-oh...and all of a
sudden she just was not there anymore.. I remember it was a bright afternoon
and the light did not shine on her like you would expect...can't exactly
explain, but she was somewhat hazy looking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I immediately ran/slide/fell
down the stairs and flung myself into my moms lap (important papers flying
everywhere) and asked her to please tell me she was just upstairs, although I
know it was not her I saw and she had no way of getting downstairs that
quickly, I really wanted to believe I did not just see what I just saw!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As far as I know we are the
second family to live in the home the previous owners having built the house
themselves. I have no idea if someone from their family died there....but I can
tell you as far as we know they never had children although they desperately
wanted to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Other than this one isolated
experience no one ever saw anything in the house. There was always a creepy/presence
like feeling that came from the attic (directly across from my bedroom). It is
hard though to tell if that is just because it was a dark unused area which can
be creepy for no other reason than that. But I and everyone would always hurry
past the attic and did not like to be in it as it was creepy (we just used it
for storage). Well, that is my only sighting although I've had other
experiences. One thing I learned people do not believe you've seen a ghost if
you are only 12! I would love to have another sighting of a ghost but know damn
well if I do I will probably break an important body part in my haste to
vamoose!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">well back when I was about
4-12 years old I used to go to a school that was built on a cementary. Like
everyday I would go to school like every elementary student would I always
enjoyed school but not until I went to the bathroom in the basement for the
first time. Not alot of people ever went there only teahers occasinally did but
they were remodeling the girls bathroom wich would take about 1 week or more
which also made us go 2 by 2 to the bathroom in the basement. Me and my friend
Ashlee were the last ones in line like always we liked being last for a weird
reason that was just who we were .We were both very shy girls. The first time
we went there ever since my 4 years in the school was very freaky but yet we
figured out to find a logical explination for everything For example the sounds
of a baby's cries we figured out it was only the faucet that needed fixing and
the cries was just our wild imagination. Second day was very much the same. But
the thrid day is something I just cant get over. Me and my friend were in the
washroom again when we decided to wash our hands as soon as we turned on the
faubet we heard the cries but they started to get louder and louder. a few
seconds later lights turned on and off each time faster and faster I holded on
to my friends hand tight I could feel they ground shaking.I found myself crying
with my other hamd I took out the little chain with a little cross on it and
kissed it.sunddenly they shaking was going slower, the crying was fading away
and lights were flickering with very long intervals in between when everything
stoped, I remember hugging my my friend and we hurried to the door. Outside was
one of my classmates shouting and asking for reasons why we had locked the door
when we never did. We tried to explain what had happened in there but she said
we were crazy ( I never really talked ton her no one really did). I ied to
forget what had happend as we walked to our classroom were i found my teacher
also screaming at us, also claiming we were out of our minds. From that day I
could bearly sleep , I sit at my bedroom floor looking for a logical explination
to this event, but each one leads me to another dead end were nothing makes
sence. I will not and refuse to forget this day. what was in there , what was
trying to get us and why. We were in third grade of course we had never killed
no one, we never had done anything wrong, but I something tells me they were
just saying get out of my terretory!!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The White Lady and Her
Husband<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: wolfgirl37@msn.com <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When I was about 5 years old
my Grandmother moved into another house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I helped her move in and the very first time I went through the door I
felt someone smooth my hair back out of my face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned, there was no one there, but there
was a feeling of great sadness and loneliness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I would feel this presence
on and off for the next seven years, never seeing anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>then one night at about 1a.m., my cousin and
I were standing in front of the mirror over the fireplace in the living room
(the living room led straight to the dining room and out of the dining room in
a straight shot were double doors that led to the rec room.) we were playing
like we were getting ready to go out for the evening, pretending to put on
makeup.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked up into the mirror and
I saw a beautiful lady dressed in a long white dress with lace on the sleeves
and around her neck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>she had big brown
eyes that were kind and sad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
beckoned at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned to see if my
cousin could see her too, and I could tell from the huge eyes and hanging open
mouth that she could.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">She asked me what we should
do. I told her on the count of three to take off for the stairs, screaming for
our parents all the way. I looked up into the mirror, the white lady was still
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I counted to three and we ran,
screaming at the top of our lungs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
we got in trouble for scaring everyone, we were put to bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was laying in bed crying, because I knew
what I had seen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, she smoothed my
hair, and this time she kissed my forehead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My grandmother lived in that
house until I was 27, I never saw the white lady again, but I often felt her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">That summer after my cousin
and I saw her I did research on the house. A lady was murdered there, when her
much older and very jealous husband found her with her lover.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He shot her in the bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her lover ran and the husband shot him at the
top of the stairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">There was a dark spot at the
top of the stairs that my uncles had scrubbed repeatedly before we moved in and
it wouldn't come out, so, they wallpapered the walls on the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The spot came through the wallpaper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They tried painting again, the spot came
through the paint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We gave up and
learned to live with the spot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My mother was not as lucky
as I had been.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She never saw the white
lady.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, several times she would
be in a room alone and the temperature would drop so low she could see her
breath, then the room would fill with a malevolent presence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">One night when she was about
to fall asleep, she looked over and there was a man's figure standing in the
doorway, she realized she could see her breath, so, she closed her eyes and
prayed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The room started to warm, when

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">During a recent trip to New
York with my girlfriend a strange thing happened.We were visiting for the
weekend and had settled in for the first night .I had gotten comfortable and
was just starting to dose off when my girlfriend announced she had to use the
bathroom.We were sleeping on the sofa bed in the living room and had a clear
view of the bathroom.There were several other family members staying as well
but all were asleep.My girlfriend was in the bathroom and I was in the dark
living room. I started to go back to sleep when I thought she would just wake
me up when she climbs back into bed so I<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>decided to wait for her return.I at that point was laying on my side
facing away from the bathroom.I rolled over to wait for her return and I looked
toward the bathroom and at the bottom of the bed was a small child.The figure
was all white and staring at me but not moving.I thought that it was one of my
girlfriends little girls who was with us on the trip and I tried to focus in on
the face.I was just about to say" sweetie you can't sleep here you have to
go back to your bed" thinking one of the girls wanted to climb into the
bed when suddenly the bathroom door opened, the light filled the room and the
figure faded into the air like a wisp of smoke. The figure I saw after I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>focused was a little boy standing at the
bottom of the bed.No more then 6 or 7 and all white. I thought I was half
dreaming ,so as not to upset my girlfriend I kept what I saw to myself. The
next day my girlfriend swears she heard a rolling sound on the wood floor of
the hallway like a toy being played with and during a visit to the kitchen for
a late night drink of water,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>strange
noises in the kitchen freaked her out.I still had'nt told her what I saw.The
next night will we were all sleeping , my girlfriend and I and several family
members that had just arrived that day and who were also staying on ajoining
couches. Suddenly at 3 in the morning the tv came on by itself .It was so loud
everyone in the room sat up in bed and looked at it but there was no one near
it. It was'nt until the last day before leaving I told my girl what I had
seen.No one has seen anything since.After considerable thought I'm sure that I
saw that boy standing at the bottom of the bed and his features were very
disernable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This is a small house that
has been cut in half to make a duplex.There are about five of the same
type<span style="">&nbsp; </span>dwellings, in front of the house
there is a brick planter and a small brick wall in the driveway.In this house
you walk threw the front door and turn left and there is a room with no door
just a room and a big opening.In this room everynight at 2-2:30 it becomes ice
cold in this room even with a heater on, ive seen a middle age woman and a
small child<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would look and theyed
vanish only at night they would appear i seen both the woman and the child
acouple times i ve seen the woman alone twice or so.At night I could here
scracthing on the ceiling like someone trying to get out or knocking on the
ceiling above the left window It was very hard for me to go to sleep so I would
read I would read on the subject of spirts and how to get rid of them or what I
could do .One time I heard clapping of hands bye my ears I was so frighten
tears were rolling down my face, one of the books I was reading at the time
said to confront the spirt and ask what do you want so I pulled the blankets of
my head to see nothing I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>relived tom say
the least,one time in my bed ive felt the blankets being pulled off me with
such a force so i held my blankets tight and was so afriad i started callin my
family mom dad mom dad still holding my blankets no one came my dad was right
there in the living room asleep to, so i threw my blankets of to find nothing
and I asked my family in the mourning<span style="">&nbsp; </span>if
they had heard me and they said no of coarse.Once late at night I had to go to
the rest room so i had to walk threw a hallway to get to the restroom the
housewas very dark i had ran to the bathroom and did my bussiness o n the door
looked out turned the lite of and ran to my room when i started running I felt
something grab my shorts I pulled them and jumped in my bed the next day I
looked in the hallway just to make sure there wasnt a nail stickin out the wall
or something to that effect but there was nothin there .One day at six o'clock
all my family had left to go out i was in my room listing to music and got
thristy i started walking to the the kicthen and i stopped becuse<span style="">&nbsp; </span>siting on a chair was a dark red figure and i
stepped back and then looked again and i said what do you want and i staired in
to its dark red eyes and i grabbed my guitar i went outside and sat with my dog
untill my parents came bac two hours later wacthing the door and the house<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It still gives me chills to this day even has
I wright this. After I had seen all this it stopped for a month and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought it was over and one day i hadnt a
care in the world and everything was just so beautiful that day that night when
i went to sleep I awoke and stood upand looked down at my bed<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and seen myself laying there i then walked in
to my sisters room checked on her then into my moms roomed and checked on her
then went tothe front room and checked on my dad asleep by the front door to
get some fresh air and i walked threw the door and my dog came out and looked
at me and i remember hearing absollute silence and that was in possible because
the freeway was a block away, so then i seen the sun and it was getting
brighter and i started running to it and then i stopped i ran back into my
house in to my room and fell back into my body to awake to see my dad shakeing
me to get up to do some chores,call it what you want a dream<span style="">&nbsp; </span>or whatever but<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i think it was a out of body experience. In
this house an I belive this is why the spirts only bothered me was because i
went into the attic wicth wasnt really an attic to begin with and i found some
old clothing and a small bed and a dol and i distrubed the objects this is why
I was huanted this I know. this all happened to me whan i was 18 im 25 now I
belive and still do that if I and my family hadnt moved frm that place
"something really bad would of happen to me". I still want to go back
and talk to whoever lives there now but just the thought sends me in to a state
of stress and I no that when I do decide to go there ill see what I did not see
before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">About 10 years ago, one of
my cousins friends were driving home from a party and were driving down the
road from <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Warwick</st1:place></st1:City>
to Sylvester. On the way they pass by a girl walking on the side of the road.
They figured it was just someone taking a night walk. When they stopped to see
if she needed any help, she never replied. So they figured, well forget her, so
they went on. On down the road they passed by <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Providence</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Church</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
and of course thought nothing of it even though they've heard all the stories.
The driver and the passenger were just laughing and joking in the front and
then the passenger asked about the one in the back seat. They both turned
around and the guy is passed out across the seat and the girl they previously
saw was sitting beside him. The driver lost control of the wheel and ran into
the lightpole (which is still there today) in front of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Providence</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Church</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.
The passenger was the only one that survived this horrific incident and he is
still alive today to tell this story. If you go there, you can hear the car
screeching and see the same little girl taking her nightly walk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This story happened to my
cousin about a year ago.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">One night her and a group of
her friends were exploring a bunch of old churches and decided to also check
out these railroad tracks that an incident happened during the slavery
times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The story is that there was a
black man trying to escape one night from the plantation and had his lantern in
his hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He got caught and the master
cut his head off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They say if you go
down there at night, you will see the old slave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And of course they didn't believe it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They went, parked they're car, got out and
looked down the tracks over the hill and saw nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Turning the other way around, looking down
the other side of the tracks, they were at shock to see a small light coming
over the top of the hill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it got
closer they could make out what the light was.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was a lantern.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To they're
suprise, they jumped in the car and started it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As they were going to pull off to leave, the light got closer and closer
and was going faster and faster toward them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After that, they left and didn't want to think of what it was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now that they think back they knew what the
light was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the lantern of the old
slave, he was looking down the tracks for his head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have submitted before, but
it has been a few years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In those few
years since I have submitted a story, it has been mostly quiet in my homes (I
move a lot).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just before moving to the
city I am currently residing in, I had issues with the house I was in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought I was having break-ins so set my
webcam up to record any movement that should happen..was a nice program to
have...what I got was not living.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
sitting at my computer watching a play back of the hour that I was away, to see
if the program worked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Captured me exiting the home and entering
again...was short file, watched it in ten minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While I was setting it up again, the camera
came on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sat watching my screen in
disbelief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the screen was a little
girl in what can only be called her "Sunday best".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked at the area that the camera was
facing and nothing was there, but looking back to my monitor, she was as plain
as day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was a little nervous, but she
stood there, not 10 feet from me, and smiled a little.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I actually got the nerve to say
"Hello" and she disappeared right after.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I uninstalled the program from my computer,
and packed away the webcam that evening.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don't know if it was real or not, but would have gone a long way in
explaining some of the things that disappeared from around the house (things no
one would break in and steal like dolls on stands that I had gotten over the
years).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I moved shortly after, as I had
planned to, to the city I am currently living in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this new home, which we moved into Jan
6th, 2006, nothing seemed out of the ordinary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My boyfriend spent time trying to spook me, but without much success,
knowing how new places are un-nerving to me with the stress of the move and
all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 2 weeks ago, though, things
started to change.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was about 5:30 in
the morning when my boyfriend said he was awaken by knocking and scratching,
but could not finda source for it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since
I slept through this, I naturally attributed it to the neighbors or him
dreaming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He thought that was a
possibility and we let it go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
just 2 days after he told me that he was awakened that I sat in my office and
heard knocking and scratching.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
mid-day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I checked the door, no one
there...went to check the back door, again no one, yet I still hear the
knocking and scratching.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went outside
and checked for a tree limb brushing the roof...nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could not hear any knocking or scratching
outside, but could hear it once I entered, not constantly, just every few
seconds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That finally faded away and
once again, I let it go for the moment, but told my boyfriend that I heard what
he had described and that the neighbors were not home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has since written off the knocking and
scratching which we both still hear from time to time, but other things have
been happening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While sitting in the
front room telling a friend about it, the front door opened and closed itself
as if someone had come in...door knob turning and all...she attributes it to the
wind (there was none) and says she needs something a bit more substantial then
that. I told her to not invite that luck on me and we laughed returning to our
conversation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing big there either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was just 6 days ago that I came home from
work and upon opening the door I was greeted with the smell of food
cooking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It smelled fabulous and like
nothing we have ever cooked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The smell
was brief...but walking in I smelled it again and started getting hungry, again
the smell was brief...I walked outside thinking that maybe someone was cooking
outside (In Feb?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why not?), but smelled
nothing outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, I walked back in
the house and plainly stated that hitting me with smells of food after a long
day was not fair, since it reminded me that I had to cook in a few hours, but
thank you anyway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have not smelled
anything since, but have felt like I was being watched a couple of times and
only once when I HAD to turn a light on, because the room was so dark, that it
felt as if something were waiting in there to pounce upon me once I came fully
into the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is what has tken
place in the past 6 days...even now, I feel as if I am being watched, but
nothing will be there when I turn to look.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Only been truely spooked once...and that was the dark room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Sorry for the length.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Will up-date you if it gets worse, have
already been told that I should have the house cleansed, but at the moment, do
not feel it is necessary...much.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Lately, I have been having flashbacks/zoning
out/dreams about the following that happened to me when I was 15 years old.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When I was 15 I travelled to
<st1:City w:st="on">London</st1:City> and <st1:City w:st="on">Paris</st1:City>
from my home in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on spring break.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went with a tour from
my school.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">One day in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:City> I was coming up from a Tube Station
near the hotel we were staying at.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
turned left to go to our hotel but for some reason I turned right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember walking a few steps and then
feeling kind of foggy, and experienced some distorted vision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Things cleared up, and I was
standing on the same <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:City>
street but it was in the late 1800's or early 1900's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The people were dressed in Victorian era
clothing and there seemed to be a funny smell like something was being burnt
nearby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember turning around and
looking the other way and it was the same kind of view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Horse and Buggies were going buy and a lot of
people were chattering and most didn't seem to know me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt kind of scared at the time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Then a lady who looked
rather rough started speaking to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
was sitting on some stone or brick stairs going into a building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said, "You there, strange boy, where
did you come from then?<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I looked at her, and didn't
know what to say.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned away from
her, and was panicing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started to walk
away from her, I looked back and she was with a group of people and pointing at
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned my head around, and started
to walk in a different way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Then, something grabbed me
and I went foggy again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next thing I
knew one of my travel companions was grabbing me by the arm and saying, "<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Troy</st1:place></st1:City> what the *%# are you
doing?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Quit wandering off, and why are
your shoes so dirty?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked at
my shoes, and they indeed had dirt on them, but we had never been anywhere that
was not paved on our trip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were also
standing about 200 yards from the Tube Station on the wrong side of the street,
and on the opposite side of where we were suppoed to be.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I guess I am trying to
figure out what happened that day, and why I keep thinking of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's like I see it played out in front of my
eyes very clearly, and I am truly mystified by this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Anyhow, thanks for letting
me email about this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maybe somebody will
have some kind of answer for me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">well i moved into a house
with my parents and for four years everything was perfect until one night i was
sleeping and i woke up and looked in my closet and saw a dark figure it looked
like a shoadow but i slept with my lights on which made it all the more
creepier so from then on i would sleep on the floor in my sisters room well one
night i heard something in the living room although i was scared i got up and
slowly walked to the living room and i peeked around the corner and there was
the dark figure again but at the front door it looked as though it was faceing
the door.things stopped for about a year i got older and starting sleeping in
the living room i never slept in my room because it always felt like something
was watching me but anyways one night i was sleeping and i woke up for no
reason but i couldnt go back to sleep and right above the couch i slept on
there was a fan and i stayed up staring at it i stared at it for about 5
minutes and out of nowhere there was someone staring down at me from the side
of the couch it scared the living crap outta me but i still slept in the living
room cause there was nowhere else to sleep .one morning i got up and my stepdad
and my mom were sitting at the table eating breakfast i wast hungry but i sat
down and talked with them and i was talking about haunted houses that i would like
to visit and my stepdad said he though our house was haunted i asked him why
and he said one night he got up to go to the bathroom and in the living room
out of the corner of his eye he saw a tall figure he said it scared him and
that i didnt feel right whatever it was .then my sister told me a story of
something she saw she slept next to a window and she said that she heard

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have a story...a kind of
long story about my grandmother's house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>i will try and make is as short as possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My grandparent's built their
house in or around 1976 in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Robertson
  County</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Texas</st1:State></st1:place>, which
is on the edge of Boone Prairie off of FM 979.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In 1979, a huge oak tree was struck down by lightning, and my granddad
dug up the roots of the tree and cut it into firewood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two years later, in 1981, my grandparents and
their best friends, were in the den playing cards/dominoes, and my grandmother
got up to go to the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
started walking down the hallway to the bathroom, and a dark shadow started
coming towards her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These folks are
Christian people and know that nothing can hurt them, so she just stepped to
the side and let it go on by.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everyone
saw this shadow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The in January of 1983,
which was the worst winter we had with about a foot or more of snow on the
ground, they were all sitting at the dining table eating and all of a sudden
all the curtains and blinds started flying like a strong wind was coming
through the windows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the windows
were not open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Over the years growing up, I
always hated staying there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We only
lived about 10 miles from my grandparents, but we were always over there
staying the night or there on family occasions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I can remember sleeping there in the den on the couch, and all of a
sudden I would wake up with the feeling that something was standing over
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was never anything there, but
it wasn't a good feeling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hallway to
the front door, which was never really used unless we needed to go out that way
for something, (we used the back door mostly cause the driveway was there), but
the hallway was ice cold sometimes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
got to the point that I wouldn't go outside unless someone went with me or
stood at the back door watching.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this
day, I won't get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most everyone in the family has experienced
something there at that house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Now, finally in the
mid-90's, I was told that my grandmother and granddad had been hearing voices
in the middle of the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They didn't
tell eachother for years cause they thought that the other would think they
were crazy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But somehow, they got on the
subject and told the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the
weird thing is that my granddad was totally deaf in one ear and almost deaf in
the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when he heard the voices
he was laying on his good ear...which means he was hearing the voices through
his deaf ear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My parents divorced in
1995, and my mother moved in with my grandparents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After about three months, she started hearing
these voices also.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She says that you can
tell that it's a man and a woman, and you can tell that they are arguing, and
it sounds like it's coming out of an old timey radio, but you can't tell what
they're saying.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In October of 2000, I had
left my ex and put everything I owned in a little house out on my grandparents
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They took me to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Houston</st1:place></st1:City> cause someone was getting me a car to
use for the week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got back to my
grandparents house before they did at about 10:30 at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My daughter was 5 then and she was there with
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went inside the little house to
get some things to take over and stay at my best friend's house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of a sudden I heard a growl...like a
wolf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it sounded like it was right
there at the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had left the door
open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Packs of wolves and coyotes are
known to come up into the yard there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
daughter was playing on the mattresses that were leaned up against the wall
that had fallen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And trying not to scare
her I told her to be quiet for a minute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I walked as silently as I could to the door, popped my head outside,
didn't see anything and shut it as fast as I could.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I go back to doing what I was there to do, and
then there was another growl, but it was loud and right there at my feet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So trying not to get freaked out, I stomped
on the floor...like that would help!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
got most of the things I needed and went outside to the car which was parked
right outside at the bottom of the steps, put the things in the trunk, and all
of a sudden my hair started raising and I got a bad feeling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned around and my grandmother had sheets
out on the clothesline.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were flying
in the wind (a windy night too) except for one of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was standing there sideways, had the
figure of a man, and the head was turned towards me, looking at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But you could tell that it was plain
evil.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could see where the eyes should
be, the nose and everything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I
suddenly went into the little house, got my daughter and told her "let's
go" as calmly as I could. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>When we
got out there it was still there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
daughter stood on the door frame of the car and said "mommy, who is that
standing over there?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That's when I
knew it wasn't my imagination!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A five
year old had seen it too!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I sped down
the dirt road as fast as I could.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
then I realized that I had left something there that I needed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I turned around and went back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That sheet was blowing in the wind like the
rest of them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In October 2002, my
grandmother woke up from some kind of noise coming out of my granddad's room
(they slept in different bedrooms).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
got up and walked into his room and turned the light on and there was granddad
suspended in mid-air looking like he was holding something around his neck and
was trying to fight it off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as
she saw this, he dropped to his bed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Granddad said that whatever it was felt hairy and was huge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Then in November 2002,
Thanksgiving weekend, my cousin and his wife, who always sleep in granddad's
bed, went to bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later on after they
had gone to sleep, his wife woke up because something had ahold of her foot and
was pulling her out of bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to
say, she won't sleep in that bed or that house anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the Christmas holidays, that same
cousin and his son were sleeping in granddad's bed and the bed started
shaking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both of them thought that the
other one was playing a joke on the other.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They said something to the other, and realized it was neither one of
them shaking the bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They both jumped
out of the bed and watched it shake and rise from the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Then in March of 2003, my
granddad died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The week after his
funeral, me, my mother, my 15 year old niece, and my sister and a few others
were staying there at my grandparents house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Me and my 15 year old niece slept in the den, as usual.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She slept in a recliner and I slept on the
couch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later on that night, I was awaken
by someone or something walking down the hallway behind the couch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first I was thinking it was my grandmother
because of the way the footsteps sounded.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But it got really cold all of a sudden and my hair started rising on my
arms and the back of my neck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't
dare look.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But then all of a sudden the
footsteps stopped and those feelings got worse and I could feel something
hovering over me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I kept my eyes closed and
went under the covers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next morning
my grandmother woke us up for breakfast and my niece came running over to the
couch and jumped under the covers with me where I was sitting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She looked like she wanted to say something
to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I said something about what I
heard, and she got woke up by it, too.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She said that she peaked to see who it was and there was nobody there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">There have been other things
that have happened in this house that only one other person knows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is my cousin that lives about three
miles from my grandparents house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
have told him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it's so bad that he
won't go to that house after dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do
know that sometimes you walk by a window or the front door that has windows,
and you feel like someone or something is standing there watching you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's creepy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We have found out, probably
in the early 90's when we found out, that the big oak tree that was struck down
by lightning use to be the hanging tree.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don't know if it was for the county or the community that use to be there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Boone Prairie and Bald Prairie, which is
right down the road, were striving communities up until the Civil War.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where my grandparents house is built, was an
old homestead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have looked up Boone
Prairie on the internet and found out about the community.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know that this might sound like the movie
"Poltergiest", but what if back in the cowboy and indian days, when
they would hang people for steeling horses, cows and such, or someone just
riding through broke the law and didn't have family and such, were hung on that
tree and buried right there where the house is built?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a woman that lives about 7 miles
away that has told us that he grandfather or her great grandfather was hung on
that same tree because of stealing a cow or horse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Which he plead innocent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't remember the details of the whole
story, but I do think that something got misunderstood about the animal and he
was accused of it and hung.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have always wanted to get
"ghost" hunters out there to my grandparent's house to see what they
find.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But my grandmother will say that
nothing's ever happened in or around that house now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We don't know why she won't admit it though
when we've all felt or seen something there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I guess that she's scared someone's gonna think that she's crazy...but
if she is, then we all are.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I thank you for letting me
send this story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: DahlinJH@lemoyne.edu<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When I was about ten, my
family moved to a nice, not-too-old colonial style house in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Maywood</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">New Jersey</st1:State></st1:place>.
It was two stories tall, and a staircase led from a hallway off the living room
up to my bedroom door. I am now 52, and back in 2000, just a year before my
mother passed away, she told nme seriously that my bedroom door used to slam by
itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My sister, Susan told me the
same thing independantly some months after our mother's passing. Growing up, I
never experienced the door slamming, myself, but apparently my mom and dad and
my sister all did. I was into sci fi films as a kid, and one of those films had
a character in it called Mad Maurice. Through the years my parents and my
sister (who was four years older than me), would refer to mad Maurice now and
then- like, Mad Maurice did it, or the like. I sort of wondered why they kept
bringing up that name, but never thought it through until later, when, as I
just said, they told me. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">To get to her room in that
house, my sister had to pass through my room and there was a hallway after
that, leading into her room. One day, as she told me, when she was 12, she
brough home one of her girlfriends, who wondered who the old man was, sitting
in my sister's bedroom chair when they came up to her room. The man vanished,
but my sister also talks about other, low-key strange things that happened in
her room. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As I say, I'd never
experienced anything like that in the house or anywhere else, since.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Just once, though, back when
I was a freshman at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Saint Louis</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, I took a nap
one Saturday evening before a group of my pals and I were going to head out to
a concert. In my dream, I got up and went into the bathroom where I looked in
the mirror. Instead of my reflection, I saw an old man with white hair looking
out at me. When I woke up from the dream I told one of the guys, who said he
wasn't surprised, and that our house had been a retirement center some years
before and that no doubt, some of the residents had passed on while living
there. So my buddy had no problem believing the reflection in my dream was a
ghost. That's the closest I've come to having "ghost" experiences,
though I've had very strong religious experiences throughout my life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Thanks for letting me share
my story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This was about 5 years ago,
when I was in 4th grade, and everyone that has gone to that school previously
knows all the stories of the bathrooms, and the lunchroom, and especially the
Gym.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only problem is, is that no one
finds out about the stories, until they get out of the school, and then they
wonder if they're crazy when they have an experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Like I said when I was in
4th grade, I went to use the bathroom on the 4th grade wing, and after I got
done, and was still in the last stall, the lights went off, and of course I
freaked out. Now it's very easy for someone to just open the door and flick the
light switch, but the only problem is, is that I didn't hear the door open,
because you would know if it did, and believe me it squeaks every time you open
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, when I was still in the
stall, I kind of heard a moaning sound, then felt a cold rush of air, I didn't
know what to think, because I had just moved to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Worth</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">County</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>,
and have never heard of the stories.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Finally, I opened the door and saw a white figure, then it
disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So right then and there I
ran out of the bathroom, but then on the way out something grabbed my foot, but
I just kicked whatever it was away. Still to this day I haven't forgotten that
incident.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I remeber when i was living
in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Prince Albert</st1:City> <st1:State w:st="on">Sask.</st1:State></st1:place> it was my birthday party and i was
playing hide-and-seek with my friend Randy. Her mom called her so she went
upstiars and i was still hiding beside a rolled up rug and the wall. i felt the
rug move as if some one had pushed it with there feet but no one was there i
looked strait up holding my breath and i saw a shadow of a figure looking on me
i jumped up and ran from that spot but as i ran and went through the shape i
had a cold, cold feeling wash through me. In that same house my cousin
(Crystal) told me about this she was babysitting me while my parents were out
she was watching TV when suddenly the washing machien turned on. She went
turned it off and went back upstairs. Again the same thing happen 2 times after
that and after the 3rd time and she came back upstairs all the lights and the
TV and everything went off. She thought the power went out but then the TV
turned on then off the on the off then the lights started to do that she got so
freaked out she came and slept with me. I belive that that house was haunted
and i'm glad we moved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hi, this is a story that
didn't happen to me, but it happened to my mom. Well, here it is.(oh, and just
to tell you where everyone<span style="">&nbsp; </span>else was, mom
was grocery shopping with one of her brothers, the other brother was at boy
scouts, and her dad was at work.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ok, my mom was home alone
around 5:00 or 6:00 P.M., but im really not sure (i never got that specific of
details) anyays, she was sitting on the couch watching T.V. when she saw a
shadow of a figure walk across from one side of the hallway to another (from
her parents room to hers and her 2 brothers rooms). she just thought "oh,
maybe Dan or Jimmy stayed home". About 5 minutes later she saw it again,
walk from one side of the hallway to another again (this time, from her and her
2 brothers rooms to her parents) she got really freaked out and ran out side.
(ok, my grandpa, her dad, is a gun collector, specifically world war II guns,
but he always kept them in a locked cabinet shelf, which was also to high for
my mom or her brothers to reach) ok, so, she ran out side and looked back at
the window thats in her parents room and saw one of her dads guns pointing at
her. She ran for her neighbrs house who's kid she baby sat, and waited for her
mom to get home. when she did, she ran to tell her mom what happened. She
didn't believe her (and most parents never do believe their kids) well, when
they went to the room and looked on the bed. Sitting on the bed was one of her
dads guns. she said nothing has hapened sence then, but, my grandpa is the only
one who lives there now, i bet he just doesnt say anything if something does
happen, anyways thank you for reading!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By:
Trina.McKay@iomcollege.ac.im<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I was working on a kibbutz
in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and a small pretty mongrel attached herself to me, following me everywhere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I called her Fergie and
eventually I returned to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
bringing her with me although it involved putting her in quarantine for six
months.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Fergie and I were extremely
close to eachother and went everywhere together for the next 12 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Time passed and she became
ill with kidney failure. I took her to the vet who wanted to keep her in for a
few hours for rehydration - he said that she would be unlikely to live for more
than a few weeks but could be nursed at home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I went to collect her with my two year old daughter he said she was
much improved and I carried her out to the car.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As I was holding her in my arms she suddenly made an undescribably
anguished noise, licked my face and died.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was devastated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vet came
out, expressed his surprise and said that she must have known she was dying but
had waited for me to come.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I drove her body home and my
husband arranged for her to be buried in a pretty pet cemetary set on a
hillside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Three mornings later I
noticed what I can only describe as an "electrically charged"
atmosphere in the house and asked my husband if he could feel it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Initially he said no, but then became rather
upset and told me that he had woken up around daybreak as he could feel a
weight upon his chest and his face was being licked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had assumed that it was our daughter
playing around, but was very shocked when he opened his eyes to see
Fergie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said she then walked to the
door, sat down, looked back at him for several seconds and then faded away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">At first I couldn't
understand why she had appeared to my husband rather than to me, but then I
realised that she had already said goodbye to me and was coming to wish him
farewell.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Neither of us have ever seen
her again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Hello again. I just thought it was time for me
to share the story of another one of my experiences.(I am also the person
responsible for the story, "Edgar Allen Crow" as seen on group page
11/story page 205.) <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Koch</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Hospital</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> was a reportedly
haunted dilapidated hospital in <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">south
  St.</st1:address></st1:Street> Louis County and I have a VERY good story
concering Koch that I have got to share. In what I think was the year 1987 I
was spending a night at a friend's house which was on a street that ran into <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Koch Road</st1:address></st1:Street>. This was
of course, too tempting a opportunity for four adventuresome boys to pass.
After some planning, we set out for Koch the next day. Fortunately, my friend
at whose house I was staying, had a camcorder which we brought along. Now, it's
been a long time, but we entered through a ground floor window and found
ourselves in what I believe was something like a shower room in the
basement(like what you'd see in a gym).From here we made our way into what
resembled a "boiler room".We decided that to get to the heart of the
hospital we had to go this way. We went through the "boiler room"
atop what appeared to be a large tube or pipe inside a tunnel. The camcorder
was on despite the fact that this room was bathed in complete darkness. For
several minutes all that is discernable on the tape are the voices of four high
school age guys carrying on and displaying typical machismo. At least UNTIL a
FIFTH unknown voice is heard in the tunnel with us. Instantly, one of our group
hushes the others. The tunnel is pitch black and comletely silent. Then we hear
the voice again. Only for a few seconds more. It is voice that is both near and
far and indecipherable. Again excitement and hushing. Seconds later all resumes
like normal. We "tour" the old hospital. We find many interesting
things, among them: an old wooden leg, the chapel on the premises, dental
x-rays and some patient files. Years later, the four of us have gone our
separate ways, but when we DO meet, and the talk turns to Koch Hospital, each
of us explains the same facts, that, 1. None of us is the source of that fifth
voice., 2. None of us saw or heard anyone else in the hospital before entering
the tunnel. And, 3. Koch Hospial was always said to be haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For several years prior to this experience my
friend had informed me of all the stories he knew of Koch. That a night
watchman in the early 80's heard a sound inside one night and took a look
around inside to see what was the matter and found a jar containing a human
fetus. That a deranged patient had escaped to a local grade school where he
proceeded to enter by putting his hand through a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>glass window in a door. (His location was
later discovered by authorities following the trail of blood left by his
injured hand.) As to the authenticity of these other claims I will admit to
being somewhat incredulous. But as to my own experience there was no room for
doubt; something supernatural had definately occurred.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hi I worked for American
Airlines for 6<span style="">&nbsp; </span>years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>5<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>years of those where at DFW.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
have 2 kids and I worked part time for World Wide Freight Services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An affiliate with AA through AMR (mother
company).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To make the story short, one
rainy stormy night, 5 of my co-workers called in (needed 12 to load cargo
plane) and left us with a thin staff.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore I get to drive both loaders (top deck and bottom deck).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The a/c pulled in at around 11:30pm from the
hangar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was flabbergasted because this
was an old plane and I have to reconfigure the load sheet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While doing this, I have someone to work on
the + an &#8211; load factor, and being the responsible crew chief, I have to inspect
all the locks inside the plane.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
where it gets hairy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started in the
belly.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are 4 sections for DC 8
the 1st 2 sections I did not have any problem but the 2 front wont open
up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I recall, the pilots where
suppose to come in from their lay over.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I looked up, there was the 1nd officer waiving at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could have swore the plane was taxied by
mechanics from the hangar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did not
sweat it but this guy help me open both cargo doors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I went top deck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is 20 sections that I have to inspect
for the locks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was with this 1st
officer all this time checking and chatting sometimes joking with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not give me the creeps until. We got
to the very back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is only one way
in and one way out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My load master
(preparing the load sheet was hollering outside and I could hear him coming up
via loader.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was telling him to come inside because of
the high winds, I could not hear him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When he finally got in I was introducing him to &#8220;Chuck&#8221; the 1st officers
name to my surprise he was no longer behind me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Fred, ask me what am I talking about.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was wondering why I was talking to my self.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked at him with a spooked out looked and
Fred told me that I looked like I just saw a ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is my experience and I do not believe in
ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was that all about!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">first, excuse my improper
grammar. I live in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">pennsylvania</st1:place></st1:State>,
and back home, i would often investigate lots of "haunted" places.
I've had some weird mishaps occur, but nothing too crazy. Recently I moved to
Cape Cod in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Massachusetts</st1:place></st1:State>
to go to school. I currently work and live at the Coonamesset Inn which
apparently has a lot of haunted history. One of the owners from many many years
ago, when the farm was first purchased and turned into a restaraunt and hotel,
shows herself to employees on occasion. AS a newcomer, i've had one slight
experience where somthing hit me when i was in a room by myself, but there are
crazier things. On February 9th, A man was staying in room 26th and he saw a
figure of a woman by the window when he awoke during the night. He thought he
was dreaming so he went back to sleep. Shortly thereafter he woke up and the
figure was standing over him in his bed, and it physically shook him. He called
my manger to let him know that he would not be staying for the rest of his
reservation. The rest of the employees told me about some of their own
experiences. A new girl that wasn't informed started seeing the figure of a man
hanging from the rafters in the cahoon room(one of our dining rooms). She asked
the othe employees if they saw it, and she explained what she was seeing which
astounded everyone else, because no one had told this girl about the history of
this place. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">What i discovered is that
the woman is named Edda, she was the owner of the <st1:place w:st="on">Inn</st1:place>
and she was very devoted to her employees and her customers. She loved this
place so i could understand why she would remain here. the man is her husband,
who committed suicide during the building of the restaurant. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">there are plenty of other
little stories, things moving in the basement, cold spots burshing past people,
sounds of running on the stairs to the basement. But the one mentioned above is
the most recent. Thanks for your time,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: allby55@hotmail.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My name is Albert, I am from
Sydney Australia. We used to live in a house when I was 3 or 4 years old (I am
now 26). I had a gold ring which was given to me from a grandparent who lived
overseas. One was also given to my elder sister (she was 5 or 6 years old).
Anyway, I was allowed to wear it, and I treasured it as it was my first peice
of jewelery (and gold!). All i can remember one day was that I had lost it and
was so very upset that I had the whole family on an extended search party
trying to help me find it, but it was no where to be found. I remember that I
and everyone else could not believe that I had lost it because I was
overprotective of all my things as a child (and still am), wether it was toys,
and especially my "gold ring". <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">So, I dont remember how
exactly I had lost it, but all of a sudden, after having nearly accepting that
I would never have my ring back after weeks/months of searching with no
success, I awake one morning to find it on my finger. I believed, and still do
today, that it was the ghosts living in my old house. I remember when I had
woken up, it was in my bedroom. This bedroom was one I rarely slept in because
I was petrified of it. Maybe because I was young and scared of sleeping alone,
but I remember most of the time I slept with my elder sister in her room
because I was afraid of something in the other bedroom. On the rare occasion I
remember sleeping in that " haunted bedroom" I can remember my ring
dissapearing and reappearing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We later moved to the house
I live in today with my parents (moved here when I statred kindergarten, being
probably the same year). My first ghostly experience here was I, being 16 or
so, having been awoken at 3 a.m one morning unexpectedly. I usually sleep like
a rock, with my bed facing the doorway, at my feet. I awoke to a black figure
zooming past my doorway. I remember I was scared stiff and couldnt move. I was
so scared I tried my hardest to fall back to sleep after 10-15 minutes of even
being scared to breath.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">There were also a few
instances in this same house which we live in now that are unexplainable. This
was only 4 to 5 years ago. My mother was making sunday lunch and had finished,
calling us all in to the kitchen table where we were to eat as a family. We all
(my dad, 2 sisters and I) got up from the living room and straight to the
kitchen table meeting mum there. We had left the tv on in the lounge room,
which was quite loudly heard in the kitchen where we were about to start lunch.
My dad asked one of us kids to get up and turn the tv off. We un-intentionally
ignored him as we were all starving and it was a lazy sunday atmosphere. He
asked again, and all us kids looked at each other contimplating which one would
get up. By the third time my father annoyingly asked for someone to get up and
turn the tv off, we are shocked by the tv automatically turning off by itself.
We are dumbfounded as we had never had a problem with the tv in all the 10 or
so years we owned it, and we havent had a problem with it since, except this
one time more. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This was a year or so later.
I was watching cable tv alone in the dark, waiting for my friend to beep is
horn outside when he arrived, as he would pick me up to go out for fun. My
mother was in bed watching tv, and everyone else was out. While I was watching
tv in the living room and waiting, my mother appeared in the doorway and called
my name. She spooked me half to death. Apologising for spooking me, she asked
me why would I be spooked from her just calling my name, and I replied "I
thought you were a ghost!". As soon as I said that, the television started
switching channels by itself, at an abnormale rate. My mother looked at me and
asked what I was doing to the television. I replied that it wasnt me and as she
switched on the light, we both looked at each other, then we looked together at
the other side of the room to see the remote control laying way over on the
other couch. My mother was so spooked, she didnt let me go out with my friend
that night and leave her alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A few more quick instances
of ghosts in my house. Once I came home to an empty house, at about 5-6pm, to
find every light in my house on, even lights we rarely use. I rang all my
family members to see if it was their doing, and they all replied that none of
them had been home yet since leaving that morning (making me the first to have
arrived home that evening). Other times during the night when I would be
sleeping, I would wake to someone walking up and down the concrete path at the
side of my house, past my bedroom window. This would freak me out, as it would
anyone, as when I would look, there would be no one there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">this is my story.a true
story.in 1998 I went to stay in youghal in county cork,southern Ireland, for a
weeks holiday with my wife,my sister and her husband.my brother in law and I
decided to go to the local pub for a few drinks.when we left the pub about
1.00am,we decided to take an old train track route back to our rented house.in
the pitch black of night we were walking and talking when my brother in law
needed to stop and pee.so I stood nearby,he was talking about what we were
going to do the next day..when he stopped in mid-sentence and said oh sh**t.I
looked in the direction he was looking in and I froze.about 50 yards ahead was
a young lady dressed in a pure white dress,the type you would see in the 18th
century (summer dress).she also had on her a large circular hat.it looked as
though the sun was shining down on her.we both froze for what seemed ages but
was probably only a few minutes.the young lady turned and slowly dimmed off in
the opposite direction to us(thank god).we both ran like hell to the main
road.to add..we were not drunk,we were both in our 30s and quite astute. to
this day when I mention it to my brother in law he freaks.this I swear to be
the truth.since that night I do believe in ghosts.thank you for my opportunity
to tell you about this.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A Few Strange Things<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: Buythis1@Charter.net<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When I was a young girl, my
Grandmother often told us stories of her encounters with the Supernatural. We
clung to every word as if it were gospel. She was also clairivoynt and made
many predictions and had dreams that came to pass. Now in my adult years , I
have this almost obsession with the Supernatural. Especially since I have my
own tales to tell.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It all began when I was 8
years old. My best friend at the time lived in a house down the road from me. I
would walk to her house almost every other day. She also had a brother that
committed suicide in that house. One day she and I were sitting on her couch
discussing people that we knew that had died, when I brought up my recently
deceased Grandfather and she brought up her brother. When all of a sudden we
both heard this voice call our names. It was almost whispery and sounded as if
it were faraway. But clearly distinct. I recall that we both looked at each
other and made a beeline for the yard where her parents were raking leaves. Of
course , they thought we were silly little girls making things up. But to this
day I still recall that voice and how it's call from beyond frightened the heck
out of me!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Moving forward to a few
years ago, my Grandmother passed away. I was very close to her. Thankfully, I
did get to tell her goodbye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few
months after her death, I was missing her and wondering if she was ok. So one
night while standing outside of my house waiting to be picked up to go out with
some friends, I said to her outloud "Granny, I would love to see you. Just
to know that you are ok . BUT if you show yourself..please don't scare me! "
The next day having forgotten all about my request. I was coming home from
college , when entering the back door, I happened to glance into the bottom
panel glass . And lo and behold! There in the glass window pane,sitting in a
chair behind me...was my Grandmother! It was like my eyes saw her , but my mind
would not accept the fact. I quickly turned around and she was gone. Yet it was
definitely her. But she had no facial features. She appeared almost cartoonish.
An energy force. I had to laugh after this experience though, knowing my
Grandmother, because she was a pepper in her day and a practical joker and
could have easily scared the bejesus out of me. She came through for me because
rememeber I asked her to show herself but not to scare me. So I guess that the
glass method was the safest way to accomplish this. Anyway, I have had tons
more strange and supernatural experiences. I believe that my life will always
have unexplainable things. Some people are just that way. Thanks for listening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
