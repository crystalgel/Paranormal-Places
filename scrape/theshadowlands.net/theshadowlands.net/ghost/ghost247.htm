<BR><B>My Ghostly Encounter</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: coteis@shaw.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>It's 1980 and I was 11 and a half years old,we had a 2 story house
which was nothing to brag about but it was home,we rented and seemed to
move quit often.That day was like any other day and I had to babysit my
two little sisiters who were 2 and 3 at the time.My mom had left for her
Bingo session and as always she locked the door as she left.There was only
one set of keys and my mother had them.</B>
<BR><B>The three of us where upstairs having a bubble bath,laughing and
making bubble beards when I heard someone coming up the stairs,our stairs
are very creaky and loud,so sneaking up or down the stairs I know is impossible.Without
delay I called to my mom because she had the keys,I got no reply,I wondered
why she was home so early,and called out again three more time and still
no answer by now I am getting scared but trying not to let it show.Our
hallway light was on and thank goodness I shut and locked the bathroom
door when we got in the bath.Now the footsteps where at the top of the
stairs and going from room to room and then I seen a shadow go from left
to right and into my room,now I was visibly shaking and my little sisters
were starting to cry.I didn't know who or what it was but I was going to
find out,I'm not sure where I got the courage to open that door and look
in my bedroom but no one was there,then I looked in all of the rooms and
nobody was upstairs,and to go back down the stairs I would've definitly
have heard it.I quickly got back to the bathroom to get my sisters dried
off and I immedietly checked the front and back door,both where dead bolted.Now
I am really confused because at this point I am not thinking 'ghosts' I
am thinking how on earth did this person run down the stairs and leave??
My mom came home at the regular time and didn't bother to mention it to
her,I thought I must of imagined it all.The very next morning she came
into my room and told me that her baby sister,my aunt died last night.It
was then I told her what had happened and she figured it was her that we
heard, paying a visit to us.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;My Grandfathers Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: hbobb@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Grandfather has grown up on an indian reserve in Sask. Canada
and up</B>
<BR><B>until his passing he was one of the most respected elders around.
He being a</B>
<BR><B>Jehovahs Witness always wanted his grandchildren to live the right
way,</B>
<BR><B>crime free and truthful, the way God would want it. I have spent
hours</B>
<BR><B>listening to my grandfather talk and tell stories how life used
to be and</B>
<BR><B>how life will be when the wicked are no longer here. I have always
been</B>
<BR><B>interested in ghosts and the supernatural and asked my grandfather
if</B>
<BR><B>anything ever happened to him. After a long pause he sat up on his
couch and</B>
<BR><B>looked sternly at me and said. Grandson I will share this story,
a true</B>
<BR><B>story that happened to me when I was younger, with you so that you
will know</B>
<BR><B>that there are dark forces about, live properly and you will have
nothing to</B>
<BR><B>fear. When he was young he lived in an older house with no power,
sewer</B>
<BR><B>ect..., his nearest neighbourrr lived about a mile away, she was
a medicine</B>
<BR><B>woman who was known for using bad medicine to hurt and harm her
enemies. He</B>
<BR><B>awoke one morning early to the sound of his dog barking hysterically,
this</B>
<BR><B>was not so unusual because there were bears near. He jumped up and
got</B>
<BR><B>dressed fast, grabbed his rifle and went to the window. His dog
was by now</B>
<BR><B>barking so fiercely in one spot that he found it strange, there
was nothing</B>
<BR><B>where he was barking at, my grandfather thought whatever it was
must be just</B>
<BR><B>out of sight so he went to the window at the far side of the house,
he</B>
<BR><B>couldnt see anything. He then went back to the window and watched
his dog</B>
<BR><B>bark and bark, it would charge and nip at the air like something
was there</B>
<BR><B>but was invisible, suddenly the dog was hurled thru the air and
landed on</B>
<BR><B>its side. He jumped up and ran around the house and started to attack
from</B>
<BR><B>the other side when again he was picked up by something and thrown
thru the</B>
<BR><B>air. My grandfather did not know what to do something was at his
home and he</B>
<BR><B>couldnt see it, he said he tried not to be scared but it was hard
not to be.</B>
<BR><B>He then ran to the door and opened it, calling his dog in. His dog
then</B>
<BR><B>started to run to different windows around the house barking uncontrolably.</B>
<BR><B>My grandfather later found out that at near the time of the incident
the</B>
<BR><B>medicine woman had died, her spirit being that of a evil one wouldnt
be</B>
<BR><B>allowed home, where all living things get to go when we pass. Thanks
for</B>
<BR><B>taking the time to read this, Hill</B>

<P><B>My Grandmothers Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Katiesroom@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My grandma and grandpa had been fighting, and for a while they were
not on speaking terms with each other.&nbsp; In a huff, my grandma left
the room they were in together and sat down on the bed in the guest bedroom
that used to belong to my mother when she lived there.&nbsp; As she was
thinking, she felt the bed slant as if someone had just sat down on the
opposite corner.&nbsp; She, out of common sense, thought it was my grandpa,
but as she turned to face him, there was no one there, just an incline
where someone should've been sitting.</B>
<BR><B>Another event that happened took place at my friend's aunt's restaurant
(funny huh?).&nbsp; Well, the story behind it all was that the restaurant
was restored from the house of a woman who's husband cheated on her with
the maid of the house, and the wife ended up killing the husband, and firing
the maid.&nbsp; The wife died in that house.&nbsp; The bathroom that was
built, was her room, and every now and then, the mirrors will turn upside
down, and the tp will fly everywhere and the toilets will flush on their
own.&nbsp; One night, it was my friend's aunt's turn to lock up.&nbsp;
She was washing dishes when the whole room began to shake, and dishes began
to flay everywhere.&nbsp; She ran out, thinking the only logical thing,
earthquake.&nbsp; The only problem was, that when she checked the weather
report, the only known earthquakes striking that day was in California
and Manhattan.&nbsp; This took place in Texas.</B>
<BR><B>One last event happened to me, Katie Ackley, a 13 yr. old who lives
in the USVI.&nbsp; I was with my friend, Max, and we were listening to
the new Eminem CD at my house, all alone, since my parents were at a luncheon
for work.&nbsp; At the end of the 6th song exactly, all the lights flickered,
and all of our things we were using to make a cake were thrown on the floor
as if someone had taken their arm at the end of the counter and pulled
their arm across pushing the items down.&nbsp; We both screamed at the
light went out, and when it came back on, the food was still on the floor,
but everything else was back on the counter.</B>
<BR><B>Tanx for reading these events, some states were changed for lack
of remembrance.</B>

<P><B>My Haunted House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tbaby@nmax.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>To start off with I will tell you a little bit about my house, it
is a old farm house, built in the early 1900's. There are several ghost
in the house all are friendly none have tried to hurt anyone, just scare
us a bit. The first one I would like to tell you about it the little girl,
Christina, she leaves in the closet of my old bedroom.&nbsp; When my sister
and I shared this room my mother would come down in the middle of the night
to see what all the noise was about. She would find me and Heather playing
in the closet with our friend. We figured that she was just lonely and
wanted someone to play with. Now that we are grown and moved on, she plays
with my littlest sister, Amanda.</B>
<BR><B>The second one is a ghost of a amish man, he is the spookiest.&nbsp;
He likes to hover over the end of your bed and just watch you sleep.&nbsp;
He does not touch you or move just hovers over you watching.</B>
<BR><B>Now for the best story of the house, one night, about 1 in the morning,
my sisters and I were watching movies like any normal teenagers would.&nbsp;
When we saw something move in the dining room, which we were using as a
extra bedroom.&nbsp; We got up to see what it was, all 3 of us gathered
in a group, when we say something sitting on the bed.&nbsp; We could see
the impression of someone sitting on the edge of the bed, and it was holding
a child's balloon, which we saw.&nbsp; So scared out of our minds, we woke
up our parents who thinking they were smart took the balloon up to there
room, which was the attic.&nbsp; After being so scared we waited a bit
then made our way upstairs to bed, all of us went in every room checking
to make sure nothing was weird.&nbsp; When we walked into my older sister's
room, and the balloon came up though her desk chair,&nbsp; Again screaming
our parents woke up and came to check on us.&nbsp; When they said that
they did take the balloon upstairs with them we freaked.&nbsp; So we had
our bother take the balloon outside and let it go, and we watched it go
up in the night sky.&nbsp; The next morning we are getting ready to leave
the house, when I opened the door and looked right into the same balloon
as the night before hovering in front of my face.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Mom</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Arment24@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My mother passed away on May 13th, 1997 and it was a very hard thing
to deal with because I loved my mother.</B>
<BR><B>After my brother and myself started taking care of all the arrangements,
I went to her place of employment to gather up her belongings and clean
out her locker.&nbsp; I also had 2 other relatives who also worked for
the same company and in the same department, but I guess I needed to do
this myself.</B>
<BR><B>To enter the building, you had to open a door and walk down an aisle
probably about 50 feet to where her department was located.</B>
<BR><B>As I opened the door to enter the building, I walked probably about
20 - 25 feet and just as I was passing the time clock, I looked up and
saw my mother at the other end of the same aisle I was in, looking at me.&nbsp;
Her glasses were around her neck as she usually wore them and her hair
was still curly like she usually had it.</B>
<BR><B>I just stood there and I couldn't believe what I was looking at
and I probably stood there about a minute or two, before I shook my head
to try to get my senses back again to try to believe that this really couldn't
have been her because she had just passed away a few days ago.</B>
<BR><B>When I looked again, she was still there looking at me and then
she walked around the corner at the far end of the aisle and when I ran
down to the other end of the aisle and looked, she wasn't there.</B>
<BR><B>I walked up and down every aisle in the building (it was a small
building) and nobody was there that even resembled my mother in the smallest
way.</B>
<BR><B>To this day, I don't know what to believe.&nbsp; If it was actually
her, or if my eyes had just played tricks on me because of the loss I had
just suffered.</B>

<BR><B>My Most Recent Haunting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sheanewyork@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Before I tell you this, I should probably tell you that I have had
numerous encounters with the paranormal, and I respect and honor the spirits
that have come before me.&nbsp; I lived in an apartment in Houston, TX.&nbsp;
It was one of those dark nights.&nbsp; One of those nights when you shut
off all your lights, and it just seems to overwhelm you.&nbsp; My boyfriend
and I were just about to go to bed, when it got really cold.&nbsp; It was
about 80 degrees outside, and we did have the air conditioner on, so we
turned it off.&nbsp; I laid down on the right side of the bed on my stomach.&nbsp;
Which is how I normally sleep.&nbsp; In about 10 minutes from shutting
all the lights off and laying down, I opened my eyes, and I was lying on
my back.&nbsp; My arms were crossed in front of me, it felt like there
was someone lying on my, and I was paralyzed.&nbsp; I couldn't move.&nbsp;
The only thing I could move was my eyes and my mouth.&nbsp; I called for
my boyfriend, to try and see if he was asleep yet, but nothing came out.&nbsp;
I looked to the right of me and he was just lying there.&nbsp; Like nothing
was happening.&nbsp; Finally after about 5 minutes of trying to shout,
I finally released a loud scream.&nbsp; This got his attention, and he
asked me what was wrong.&nbsp; I tried to reach out to him, but my body
was still paralyzed.&nbsp; Just then, I saw a flicker of light to the left
of me.&nbsp; Sort of like a cigarette lighter.&nbsp; I tried to move again,
and I could finally move.&nbsp; I jumped out of bed and flicked on the
light.&nbsp; I had a poster right above my bed on the wall, and I started
seeing things moving in it.&nbsp; Like it was swirling.&nbsp; I finally
told him as I was putting on my pants that I was leaving.&nbsp; I had to
get out of that apartment.&nbsp; So, he got up, and at 1 am in the morning,
he called a friend of his that was an Indian Shaman.&nbsp; He worked at
the Eckerd's during the night shift.&nbsp; I told my boyfriend that I was
going to stay outside while he went in to get him.&nbsp; While they were
in there, I was so cold.&nbsp; I got out of the car to sit on the curb.&nbsp;
Afterall, it was about 75 degrees, and I had put on 2 pairs of socks, and
pants, 3 shirts, a jacket, and a beanie.&nbsp; I was still cold.&nbsp;
They came out pretty quickly, and he looked at me and ran back inside.&nbsp;
About 5 minutes later, he came back out and told us to get in the car.&nbsp;
I had to go to work the next day, so I told my boyfriend I had to get clothes
for work.&nbsp; He said that he would go in and get them, so we drove to
my house.&nbsp; He was in there while we waited in the car for about 20
minutes.&nbsp; When he finally came back out, he told me that he wasn't
going back in, if he didn't get the right stuff.&nbsp; He said when he
went in, it was even colder than when we went to sleep.&nbsp; And when
he tried to walk through the living room to get to the bedroom, he kept
hitting these walls.&nbsp; Like someone didn't want him in there.&nbsp;
He said he had to actually walk around them.&nbsp; We ended up at his friend's
house, and as I walked into his living room, and his cat started hissing
at me, and ran out the sliding glass door.&nbsp; He burned sage around
my feet and head and body, while he asked me all kinds of questions.&nbsp;
We figured out that the spirit was a family spirit.&nbsp; He asked me if
there was anything else that has happened to me and I told him about all
the other incidences.&nbsp; The Indians believe that a spirit can travel
from one family member to another if the host dies.&nbsp; My father had
died about 5 years prior to this.&nbsp; He died of lung cancer, from smoking
to much.&nbsp; We figured that the cigarette lighter flicker was my dad
trying to help me.&nbsp; About 3 days later, I finally returned home.&nbsp;
Me, my boyfriend, and his friend, saged my whole apartment, and the next
night that I spent there I woke up and felt a calmness, because I know
that my dad is watching over me.</B>

<BR><B>I went out the back door , walked from the patio to the grass and
looked around to check my mum was watching me , she wasn't, but my Nan
was. I couldn't believe it. I kept on looking around to see if I was imagining
it , but she was there alright. I went into the aviary and still in disbelief
l kept on looking down the garden to check she was still there. by this
time I was feeling a little scared. I started to walk back down to the
house and as soon as my foot touched the patio she disappeared. ive never
seen her since and im desperate to see her again. maybe one day when I
need some one to keep watch on me. I do miss her</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Niece Aubrey</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: rsunderman@stjoetitle.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When my niece, Aubrey, was only about 2 years old my brother and
sister-in-law rented one side of a duplex on Ashland Avenue in St. Joseph,
MO.&nbsp; Their side of the duplex had an upstairs where the bedrooms were.&nbsp;
Aubrey's bedroom was one of the upstiars rooms which had a large walk-in
closet.&nbsp; When they moved there she developed imaginary friends.&nbsp;
My family has never believed in ghosts so, of course, we thought nothing
of it.&nbsp; Remember, she was only 2 at the time.&nbsp; Anyway, she had
two imaginary friends and she called them Kay-Bee and DaDaDa.&nbsp; Kay-Bee
was her nice friend and DaDaDa was mean to her, for example, Aubrey was
in the bathtub and started screaming and when her mom came in there and
asked what was the matter Aubrey said DaDaDa was pushing her face down
in the water and Kay-Bee made him stop.&nbsp; It seemed that Kay-Bee was
always sort of protecting Aubrey from DaDaDa.&nbsp; Aubrey also said that
they slept in her closet.&nbsp; Other weird things happened in the house
that didn't happen to Aubrey.&nbsp; My brother was in the basement smoking
one night and heard a scratching sound on the door of the canning closet
and when he went to check it out he opened the door and leaned in and the
door slammed him in the back (the door didn't have a spring and would normally
stay open on it's own).&nbsp; Another time he was in the basement and saw
a strange glare or something on a poster on the wall and when he went over
to look at it he felt a warmth on his neck (not a chill) and he turned
and blacked out.&nbsp; When he woke up he was sitting in the middle of
the room on the floor.&nbsp; My brother had some of his friends over one
night and Tara (his wife) was upstairs in bed and he and his friends were
in the basement and he came up to the main floor to get some more cheese
dip and the crock pot was sitting balanced on top of the lid handle, then
he heard two girls talking upstairs and he thought that one of Tara's friends
must have come by, so he went upstairs and looked in the bedroom and she
was fast asleep in bed, as was Aubrey.</B>
<BR><B>After they moved out of the house Aubrey always said that Kay-Bee
and DaDaDa stayed at that house, that they didn't move with them.&nbsp;
Jason (my brother) and Tara were working at a popular restaraunt as wiaters
at the time and some regulars who claimed to be somewhat psychic and "in-tune"
with the paranormal were eating at one of my brother's tables.&nbsp; He
mentioned that weird things used to happen at the house they used to rent.&nbsp;
He didn't tell them anything about Kay-Bee or DaDaDa, the only thing he
gave them was the address.&nbsp; About a week later they came back in to
the restaraunt and told Jason that they had checked out the house and sensed
two spirits, children's spirits, and that one was a good spirit and the
other bad.&nbsp; They also said that the spirits were coming in through
a portal in an UPSTAIRS CLOSET.</B>

<BR><B>My Own Experiences confirmed by a Room mate</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bmevis@cox.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>The first thing I have to mention is a strange out of body experience
I had when I was about three or four. At the time my parents lifed on the
same property as my grandparents. It was a rectangular lot with our house
in the front and Grandmas in the back. Between the two was a court yard
like area with lots of trees. On the east side I had an above groung sand
box next to the fence. Now this is the weird part. I STRONGLY and vary
vividly remeber seing myself playing in the sand box as if I were standing
back about twenty feet and about six feet up. I was surounded in a white
mist or cloud. I still get a good and pure emotion from this experience.
Does any one have any input?</B>
<BR><B>The second major experience I had was when I was about seven. My
parents moved out of the last house and into this one just before my sixth
birthday. I was lying in my bed triyng to go to sleep when I saw a short
figure, about three feet tall, walk from the right of my door, look into
my room, countinue on, turn the corner and walk down the hall, slowly fading
away. Note: just thinking about and remebering this sends chills through
my body. the hall was and L shape with my parents to the right(north),
then mine and my moms sewing room to the left (south). These three rooms
made the East side of the L. My room looked down the west turn of the hall
with my sisters room to the left (south) respectively. Several years later,
after my parents had divorced, my mom rented out my room to a friend of
hers. (i was living in her old sewing room). One night when we were talking
about ghosts and our experiences, Tiffany, our roommate, mentioned seeing
something in her room. After I asked a few questions, she had explained
in near perfect detail the same thing I had seen, only it was looking at
from the corner of the room. She had also seen an old lady in white with
a flower basket in that room.</B>
<BR><B>Finally, for any one who has read The Celestinre Prophecies, you'll
really appreciate this.Whenever I have thoughts or memories of friends
or family who have past, I'll hear coincidetal noises. The monitor pops,
the light flickers, or just know the cat jumps on my lap from seemingly
no where. I've been told by friends and family that I have "the gift'"
(right there, some thing banged on my wall. . .) and that it is some thing
to charish and share.</B>

<P><B>My Own Ghostly Feelings</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mickeyis@mindless.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I've had a few experiences of my own during my life.&nbsp; Mine seem
kind of simple compared to others, but I have always believed in ghosts...
and these things that have happened to me are my own ghostly adventures
I guess!</B>
<BR><B>One thing I can really remember, is when I was pretty young, somewhere
around 7 or 8, I went into the livingroom where I saw my younger brother,
he was kind of looking creepy but I tried talking to him anyway.&nbsp;
I wasn't sure what was wrong with him, I figured he just didn't understand
what I was saying to him or couldn't figure out how to say back what he
wanted to say (he had some sort of speech impediment back then), and then
he just kind of walked away and I couldn't find him anywhere!&nbsp; But
then as I went into my bedroom I saw him in his bed on the top bunk laying
there in his pyjamas... which was odd because when I saw him in the livingroom
he had been wearing his one green outfit!&nbsp; I was so freaked out, because
he had obviously just woken up!</B>
<BR><B>Another weird experience was when I was at church with my class.&nbsp;
I was no older than 10, I know that... but I was just kneeling like all
the other kids were (I wasn't Catholic like they were, so I didn't know
what to do), I looked up from my "prayer" and saw the Priest coming out
onto the altar with something trailing behind him.&nbsp; The "something"
was wearing clothes like all the statues of Jesus were, and also had a
beard and long brown hair and sandels on.&nbsp; I was in awe, but also
totally freaked out!&nbsp; So I looked back down and then back up and saw
it still there and watched it "merge" with the Priest.&nbsp; It was so
neat!&nbsp; And it was that moment that maybe my path to God (I used to
be pretty religious... only I went to a Presbyterian church then) was through
the Catholic church... so soon after I switched hoping to see that illusion
again.</B>
<BR><B>Next, when I was about 10 years old (so 10 years ago) my grandfather
(my dad's dad) had a stroke in Arizona and was brought back to his city
in Ontario to pretty much just live out the rest of his days in the hospital.&nbsp;
We all knew he was going to die any day, and one day when I was at school
I sitting outside at recess and suddenly I just started to cry and I didn't
know why.&nbsp; Later when I went home that day my parents were waiting
and told us our grandfather had died just a little earlier.&nbsp; The freaky
thing is that I talked to my older brother later, and he told me that he
had all of a sudden had a real need to cry at that same time that day,
and had tried to cover it up with those sour gumballs that were big then.</B>
<BR><B>This one is just going to sound stupid. But I will put it anyway.&nbsp;
I was about 8 years old, and had known for about 3 years or so that Santa
Claus and the Easter Bunny and such didn't exist (my older brother spilled
the beans when I was like 5), so what happened could not have been a totally
overactive imagination!&nbsp; We were in Toronto for Easter at a Hotel
I didn't particularly like... I didn't know why, I just didn't.&nbsp; The
night before Easter (the night the Easter Bunny is supposed to come!) I
woke up with a start, and looked straight ahead to see a big ugly brown
"bunny".&nbsp; It scared me but all I could do was stare at it and watch
it as it moved around the hotel room.&nbsp; I looked in the mirror on the
bathroom and didn't see it on it, but could see it plainly right in our
room.&nbsp; I ran to the bathroom... when I came out it was gone... but
I can still see it in my head... even now, practically 12 years later!</B>
<BR><B>My last story has to do with my other grandfather (my mom's dad)
who passed away January 2002.&nbsp; I was really really close to my grampa,
so when he died I took it really hard, and still am.&nbsp; My grandma (his
wife) had died only 4 months earlier, so there was a lot of death it appeared
to me, and I didn't know if I could handle everything that was going on,
especially since it was my first year of University.&nbsp; I felt like
giving up on everything, and one night I had the strangest of dreams.&nbsp;
In it were both my grandmas and my grandpa... I don't remember my dad's
mom very well, but everyone always says I look like her, and smile like
her, and she was apparently quite fond of me when I was born.&nbsp; But
they were all there telling me to keep going at it, and that they were
always with me no matter what.&nbsp; It was a comforting dream, and I was
able to get through my first year alright!&nbsp; I still feel my grandfather's
presense with me all the time, which is nice since I miss him a lot.&nbsp;
Sometimes, when I get really sad about not having him anymore, I just feel
this comfort like it's going to be okay, and I know it's him watching over
me.&nbsp; He was always so proud of me, and he's making sure I know he's
here with me so I have the strength to finish making him proud.</B>
<BR><B>Thank you for such a wonderful site.&nbsp; It scares the crap out
of me when I'm here in my room all alone (especially since I don't really
like one corner of my room very much!&nbsp; It feels eerie), but I like
finding out others' experiences!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Own Personal Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: pointsfamily@arkansas.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello. First of all, let me begin by saying that I am 25 years old,
the father of two young boys, and consider myself to be a fairly sane person
and a God fearing man. I am not sure if I believe in ghosts or not, but
let me share my experiences, and some of those of my family's. I am going
to try to do this as chronologically as I can, though I am not sure on
some of the dates. Some of these are stories my family has told me throughout
the years, but the biggest part of them are my own expereinces.</B>
<BR><B>The first story that comes to mind is about my mother's father.
He was not a man to go around making stuff up. He was a very serious person
and all and when he told you something, you could take it for the Gospel
truth. I don't think he belived in ghosts, but then again he ha two experiences
in his life that are rather odd. The first one deals with a cemetary near
where he lived. Before he got a car, he would walk home late at night from
work as a young man and would have to walk by a cemetary. Something happened
to him one night though as he was walking by that graveyard. He never would
say what it was, and when youpressed him on the subject he would get upset
and tell you to drop it, but to his last day he would not set foot in that
graveyard. In fact, if he could avoid that place in anyway, he would.</B>
<BR><B>His second experience dealt with my other grandfather who died before
I was born. The night that my father's father died, my mother's father
saw a light over the chicken coop in his back yard. Paw Paw (that's what
we called my gradnfather) swore to his last day that it was a vision of
my other grandfather.</B>
<BR><B>My mother has also had an experience with a ghost. When she was
a teenager she saw the ghost of her uncle walk by her bedroom window at
the precise moment he shot himself. He lived an hour away from them and
when my grandfather went outside the next morning to investigate, there
were no foot prints in the dirt under my mom's bedroom window. While they
were eating breakfast, they got the call that my mother's uncle had shot
himself the night before at the exact same time he had walked by my mom's
window.</B>
<BR><B>My mom's youngest sister has had a couple of experiences as well.
First she saw a lady who had recently died setting on the bed in the lady's
home where she had died. She was there helping my grandmother go through
some things that the ladies husband was giving my grandmother. Needless
to say, both my aunt and my grandmother left the house without the things.</B>
<BR><B>She also saw her grandfather's shadow cross the road into the graveyard
where he is buried on his birthday one morning. She was coming home from
work early tha morning on Valentines Day and had to drive by the graveyard
where her grandfather was buried. He was born on Valentinte's and they
would give him Valentines Dya cards instead of birthday cards. She stopped
to look out into the graveyard and say "Happy Birthday" to her grandfather
and when she drove off, she looked up in the rear view mirror of her car
and saw a shadow go across the road, but no living thing around to cause
it.</B>
<BR><B>That brings me to my experiences. As I said before, I consider myself
a pretty sane person, but what I have seen defies logic. My first experience
happened when I was pretty young, about seven or eight. I was lying in
bed one night and through the curtain of my bedroom window, I saw someone
walk by my window. I told my dad and when he went to investigate, he found
no footprints in the ground oustide my bedroom. Also, my parent's house
has a door that opens and closes by itself. I have also seen that same
"person" walk by the living room window when there is no one around to
explain it.</B>
<BR><B>After my grandfather past away in 1995, I saw him on several occasions.
Once he was standing over my mom's bed and the second time he was standing
in his bedroom in his house. He also has come to me in my dreams on several
occasions and once I heard him walking in his house when there was no one
there but me. I know it was him because in life he only had one leg and
had to walk with crutches. The sound was that of someone walking on crutches.</B>
<BR><B>My last two experiences with the "unexplained" have been quite recently.
My wife and I recently moved into a new house to put our oldest son into
a better school district. Not long after we moved in, I was at home alone
in my office, working on the computer. I had the speakers of the computer
turned off and I know there was no one outside because all of my neighbors
work and have activities during the day that keep them away from home.
However, I heard someone talking in my house and the sound of children
laughing. When I investigated, there was no one to be seen. I even went
outside to make sure there was no one in my yard or in the surrounding
area and there wasn't. Also, late at night, if you look down the hall that
leads from my bedroom to the kitchen, you can see the shadow of someone
walking down the hall, but know one is there.</B>
<BR><B>As I said earlier, I am a God fearing man and consider myself quite
sane, but I cannot tell you how any of these things have happened other
than my family and I have a "link" to the other side.</B>

<P><B>My Parents</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ravnos26@lycos.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have been reading your pages and wanted to add my story. My husband
and I lived with my parents right after we were married. When we found
out I was pregnant we moved into the house next door. I began having horrible
dreams of my child disappering or being stolen while I was pregnant. My
father's father died years before I was born and I had never even seen
a picture of him. I would go over to my mother's house during the day and
would walk across the yard to my house which was locked tight(it wasn't
a good neighborhood). My husband was at work and I would walk into the
house and see a man in what was to be the nursery. I would leave the house
running and stay with my mom until my husband came home. The awful dreams
would continue and I would be woke up in the middle of the night by my
husband because I was screaming. I would lay in bed during the day and
take a nap only to awake to this man standing at the foot of my bed smiling
at me. I wasn't scared. (Strange, I will be th</B>
<BR><B>e first to admit to being a chicken.) Sometimes the man would hold
his arms out to me like he wanted to hug me. Other times I would hear his
voice in my head tell me everything would be okay. This and the dreams
went on throughout my pregnancy. One year and three days after my marrige
I had a bueatiful little girl named Tika Morning. Four days after she was
born she died suddenly of SIDS. To say we were heart broken is an understatement.
She passed away at home with us. After that I had a seris of dreams including
the man I saw at the house and my mother's parents(both dead) sitting at
my mother's kitchen table holding my baby and telling me that this one
was theirs but I would have more. In&nbsp; my dreams my grandparents would
allow me to hold Tika for a short time. I told my dad and his sister about
the man and when I described him my aunt showed me a picture of the man,
my grandfather. Did my grandfather try to help me prepare for this? I know
the dreams did help to relieve a li</B>
<BR><B>ttle of the grieving. And I did have two more children. A very healthy
boy and girl who will learn of their grandparents and have plenty of pictures
of them. Sorry it is so long. I am not the best writer. Thanks for your
time.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Specific Story and a General One</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: KISSMILITIA@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>First, the specific...</B>
<BR><B>Back in the early 1990s, I was dating/ living with this particular
girl. every once in a while, I would get a strange feeling, be it the hairs
on my neck standing up, a sudden chill, or just that strange feeling that
you are not alone. when I would mention this to her, she simply said that
it was her ghost. She said the land that the house that she grew up in
was once part of the large Banning/ Dominguez ranch lands in southern Los
Angeles county. Evidently, someone had been hanged from the tree that was
in her backyard, and for some reason, attached itself to her, following
her from residence to residence. when she moved in with me, it was among
the other belongings that she brought.</B>
<BR><B>As stated, it was usually just that feeling of not being alone that
I felt, and once in a while, our cats would freak out a bit. It was never
a threatening feeling, just strange.</B>
<BR><B>A few years after moving in together, we moved, and a few months
after that, her sister-in-law and her family was staying with us during
the summer months. My girlfriend was in the kitchen, I was sitting at the
computer in the next room, viasable to her, and her sister-in-law's boyfriend
was in the living room watching TV, out of view due to a load-bearing wall.</B>
<BR><B>As I was working at the computer, I caught movement out of the left
side, and turned to see the cats wigging out as theyhad never before. On
both cats, every hair on their bodies was on end, and they were moving
backwards. I looked at my girlfriend, she had stopped what she was doing
and appeared a little ashen. I was about to ask her what was the matter,
when I felt what I can only describe as an icy cold breeze go across my
lap between me and the computer. From the next room, her sister in law's
boyfriend says "Holy shit! Did you see that?"</B>
<BR><B>I turned back tomy girlfriend, and still pale, she explained that
her ghost had just made an appearance in a very big way.</B>
<BR><B>The general story has to do with one of the guys who had been killed
in the line of duty before I had hired on. It is not uncommon for doors
to close at work, lights to be turned off, and the toilets in the men's
locker room to flush when no one is using them. The only explanation is
it is the spirit of one of our guys who had been shot on duty. We will
often acknowledge the happenings by saying "Hi Ron" (his first name), and
the happenings will stop. Seems he is merely seeking some attention.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; My Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Schwarts91@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>hi,my names Emily.I live in a house we bought from my grandparents.my
mom and her 2 sister grew up here as well.I moved in when i was 5 and I
am now 17. It seems that everyone who has lived her that i've talked to
has a story and they all involve the same thing, a large scruffy man that
loods likd an old time fisherman.When i was little i stayed in the room
at the end of hall.every night i made my garnny put a chair infront of
the closet door and leave teh light on...typical of a 5-7 year old right?
but i can recall that face as well today as i did then.He would chase me
in my dreams untill i got so scared i woke up..but only when i opened my
eyes he was still there.Finally one day when my granny and i were home
alone she got sick of it and went to my room opened the closet door and
reache din and grabbed him and said "you're comin w/ me." and she took
him and put him in my brothers closet.i believed in her liek any small
child would and i went to sleep that nighy aweful things.once he actually
bit my sister.he didn't have any front teeth at teh time cause she had
lost them and she told us teh bad man bit her.how could she have done it
herself if she had no teeth? but the odd thing is i was talkin to my aunt
*my moms younger sister who also stayed in teh room at the end of teh hall*
and she had the same dreams i had.i was telling her and 1/2 way through
she'd finish teh dream for me.Then about a year ago when my brother was
hoem from college he stayed in that room because it is now teh guest room
and he woke up in the middle of the night and said some one was holding
him down.he couldn't move and so he tried to scream but he couldn't.</B>
<BR><B>.....we also have many smaller stories. Once my granny was watching
my brother and i before my sis was born and she was down stairs washing
dishes.She said some one,a lady, walked into the door way.she thought it
was my mom who has just gotten home so granny was talkin to this lady.then
when she looked up the lady disappeared.Another time when i was about 9
i got this doll in a walker that had a remote control so you could drive
it around. well one day my dad and my brother were upstairs getting ready
to go away and suddenly they here "hehehe" and teh wheels of teh walker
and they didn't think anything of it.they thought i was playing w/ the
doll.Then when dad walked out into teh hall way he saw the doll stolling
down the hall way and i wasn't even up stairs.dad called to nick and he
came to see.this doll never even hit the wall or ran into anything.but
then after the realized i was down stairs they picked up the doll and found
it didn't even have batteries in it.</B>
<BR><B>We also have the some one calls your name when you're home alone
and the some one sat on your foot when you were sleeping in bed..the stuff
that's not a big deal.We occassionally get the opening and closing doors
and drawers and orbs in pictures and stuff...but my person favorite story
i have is this one:</B>
<BR><B>my best friend,her step sister and i were home alone at my house
one night.we were baking a cake to decorate for our own little made-up
holiday.I had just bought a cd and we got out all of my sisters dolls and
made them be the crowd and we sang to them pretending to be famous.and
after we got done we had to put them all away.when it got down to the last
doll neither of them would go near him.i was like "guys.it's my Roberto.he's
not gonna bit you." but they still wouldn't touch him.Roberto was a special
Italian doll my granny and papa got for me since we're Italian.This was
my favorite doll ever and i swore i would never get rid of him.He went
through everything w/ me.He had one arm that we tried to glue on,sew on
,and even staple on once but it just wouldn't stay.so i picked Roberto
up just like a real baby liek i always did and i set him in teh toy basket
and walked out of the office and shut the door.we all walked into the kitchen
to get out our cake.then we wnet back into the green room where we wereiating
for soem one to get home.we just held hands and sta there.my mom got home
and didn't believe us but she got ride of the doll any way.</B>
<BR><B>well that's all i have for now.thanks for listening</B>

<BR><B>My Story from 1996</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: david.hillhouse@usm.edu</B><B></B>

<P><B>Back in 1996, I was living in an apartment in Meridian, Mississippi
while I was working as computer operator at an insurance company.</B>
<BR><B>Everyday, I noticed the old man from next door walking outside.
He was always a friendly old man, but we never got a chance to talk or
meet. I was always busy with work or on my way to or form somewhere. We
only lived 4 houses from the corner of the block. He was in his 80's and
I guess this was his only exercise, walking to the end of the block and
back everyday.</B>
<BR><B>One day when I came home from work around 4pm, I noticed the old
man walking again. This time he waved and spoke. I waved back then walked
into my apartment. I was getting things ready to make dinner when there
was a knock at the door. I answered and it was the old man. I told me of
how he felt bad that he had lived next door to me for the last couple of
months and had never came over and introduced himself.</B>
<BR><B>I invited him in and he sat on the sofa. We talked for about 15
minutes or so, then he said he had to be going. He left and I finished
dinner.</B>
<BR><B>The next afternoon when I came home from work, there was another
knock at the door. I answered and it was the young lady from across the
street. She wanted to know if I wanted to donate money to buy a deli plate
of meats and cheeses to take over to the neighbor's house. I asked why,
what happened?</B>
<BR><B>She told me that "Mr. Evans" passed away yesterday morning!</B>
<BR><B>I told her that I had just talked to him yesterday afternoon. She
said, "oh, I didn't know you went to the hospital." I told her that I didn't.
I never knew he was in the hospital. I had just talked to him yesterday
afternoon in my living room. She said that was impossible. She went on
to tell me that he had been in the hospital for 3 days and that he had
passed away yesterday morning while in the hospital!</B>
<BR><B>I never saw the old man again. A few months later, I moved across
town to another apartment.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Story as a Kid</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tenchi@insightbb.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>when i was growing up i saw a lot of wierd things ghosts and such
but now that i am older i havent seen too many wierd things [ guess i grew
out of it] except for the occassional out of the corner of my eye deal
and i can hear people talking in gibberish or yelling once in a while...i
am not crazy or psycotic..anyway the one thing i will share with you happend
one night when i was about 5 or so.&nbsp; first off let me tell you that
my dad tore down about 3 or 4 very old houses to build our house, anyway
i was sleeping downstairs,our upstairs was not finished yet,and my parents
slept across the way from me seperated only by a big closet,you could walk
around it and be in their open room,mine was open as well no walls done
yet and the bathroom was right in front of me, i wake up about 2 or 3 or
so..about the same time all the things occured, and i heard..yes i actually
heard..as clear as day and it sounded like it was right next to me the
entire time..a little boy about 5 or 6 my own age saying "mommy,i need
a drink of water." over and over again..i wasnt scared cause i saw things
about this time and he just sounded kind of sad...i waited for it to stop
but when it didnt i sat up and waited longer..all the while over and over
again "mommy i need a drink of water."&nbsp; so after a while i thought..maybe
im imagining it because im thirsty. so i got out of bed and got a drink
of water from the bathroom..but it didnt stop..so i went and sat in bed
for a while..it lasted about 45 minutes! and finally he stopped...i have
no idea why i heard him or where it came from and to this day i still wonder
if he was a spirit trapped in the house from one of the houses dad tore
down to build ours...well thats all i got for now..i swear this is true
and if you have any explanation for it i would love to know as i have wondered
about it all my life as i am now 28 thank you and if you want to add it
to your site i would love it and anyone who might have an idea please write
me too!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tiffany@dragonphly.org</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi, I just found your site while looking for ghost stories, and after
reading about 1000 of them, I had to share some of mine.</B>
<BR><B>My first "encounter" happened when I was about 7 or 8. We used to
live in a 150+ year old house, which was reputed to have been "slave quarters"
back in the day of the Civil War. I was having some friends over for a
sleepover, and we had made one of those "forts" with blankets and were
inside giggling, when all of the sudden, my radio across the room came
on, the sound at full blast. We all looked at each other for about two
seconds, eyes wide, jaws slack, and then ran screaming out of the room
and down the stairs. "Pshaw," my father said. "I'm sure you're imagining
it." Uh, no. We could still hear the music playing.</B>
<BR><B>Years went by without much else happening. Then when I was 15, it
started back up. We had the kind of doorknobs that require skeleton keys
to lock, and I had installed the one in my door, but I had put it in backwards,
so the door could only be locked from the outside (thus locking someone
in). That was fine, since I just wanted to keep people out while I was
out of the house. So one day I get ready to go to school, I lock the door,
and go on my merry way. When I got home, the door was still locked (I had
the only key to that lock), I unlocked it, and went into my room, and every
single piece of paper I had tacked up had been turned upside down and retacked....</B>
<BR><B>A few months later, I was laying in bed on my stomach, with my back
to the closet door, reading. No one else was in the house. Suddenly, the
room felt very cold, and the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. Our
dog Bear, who had been laying on the floor next to the bed, began to whine
very quietly. Next thing I knew, I felt a hand print on the middle of my
back. This hand moved up my back, then back down, and I felt a breath of
air by my ear. Summoning all my courage, I turned around. There was nothing
there.</B>
<BR><B>About six or seven years later, I was at a boyfriend's house. His
parents and little sister had gone out of town and we were the only ones
in the house. I was in the kitchen getting a drink, and upstairs (they
lived in a split level) I hear his mom walking from her bedroom to his
sister's bedroom, and I can hear her talking, but I can't quite make out
what she is saying. I started to go up the stairs, then remembered that
his mom was in the Bahamas. I beat it back down to his room pretty quickly,
and all night long, we heard footsteps walking up and down that upstairs
hall. Other times, we would be pulling into his driveway, which slopes
downhill to the house, and the headlights of the car would hit the glass
panes of the bay window, and we could see a girl standing in the window
looking out at us, even when we knew for a fact no one was home.</B>
<BR><B>Four years ago, I lived in a house on the coast of the Atlantic,
in Rhode Island. About two weeks after I moved in, my roommate told me
that her dad had killed himself out in the garage. Uh, thanks for the forewarning.
That creeped me out a little bit, but I figured hell -- I've been around
enough ghosts, it's not THAT big a deal. Well, we had two puppies, and
they REFUSED to ever go down the stairs into the basement (and really,
I couldn't blame them. If the washer and dryer hadn't been down there,
I would have never gone either!) even though they followed me EVERYWHERE.
One afternoon, it was just the puppies and I in the house, and I had gone
down to throw in some laundry, and I would always keep up a running conversation
with the dogs, to reassure them, and myself! So I'm down there talking
to them about what I did during the day, throwing the clothes into the
washer that is filling with water, when I hear someone with a very heavy
tread walking across the living room floor towards the kitchen (where the
door to the basement is). I shut off the water on the laundry and still
heard it getting closer. I could look up the stairs and see the puppies
cowering and looking towards the living room, and as the footsteps got
even closer, the puppies ran downstairs and hid, shivering, behind my legs.
Well that was reassuring, eh? I picked up a heavy lead pipe (the only thing
I could find!) and went upstairs to investigate... And of course, there
was nothing there.</B>
<BR><B>The apartment I just moved out of was definitely haunted. The complex
is built over one of the battlefields from the Civil War, so it's not that
surprising. Four or five times, I would be sitting on the couch reading,
all by myself, with all the remotes stacked on the coffee table, and the
stereo would turn on. The first time this happened it scared the HELL out
of me. It took me forever to get up adn turn the stereo off. Then one day,
my roommat eand I were sitting in the living room, telling one of our neighbors
about how the stereo comes on by itself, when the oven timer went off by
itself, which made all of us scream and jump up. I tiptoed into the kitchen,
with them right behind me, and shut it off, and as soon as I shut the timer
off, the stereo turned on by itself. The ghost did have a sense of humour.
Later one evening, I was laying in bed reading, when I heard a tapping
on my window. We lived on the 2nd floor, and there was nothing tree-like
or cable-like within a good 20 feet that could be tapping the window. A
moment or two later, I heard, very clearly, a ringing bell ("ding ding
ding ding ding"). Later that night, I heard people talking in the hall
and the kitchen, but my roommate was out. I ignored it and went to sleep.
I moved about 6 months later, and that has been that.</B>

my grandad died in october 1992, on halloween. 1yr l8r, i was sitting in
my room- the house was empty, i was getting ready for a halloween party.
when i heard someone in the bathroom, my grandad had died in our house.
i got up and went to see what the noise was- standing slightly translucent,
was my grandad, just the way he had been before he died, his frail corpse
wrapped up in a royal blue dressing gown. i felt sick- i didnt know what
to say or do- i was frozen with either fear or shock, but either way i
couldnt move. he raised his head and looked at me, and smiled an icy grin,
this grin was not the warm smile which i once knew, but cold and lifeless.
I looked at him, his mouth opened- he said "leigh, darling, go and put
the heating on you'll catch a chill. Oh and look after your Mam for me-
she's a good'n" Words could not express how i felt. i just nodded and stood
there. i felt sick, he said " go on then leigh, i'm being summonded- il
always love you, and il be watching over you- now go and do me a favour
put the heating on" With this i turned around, with tear stained eyes,
i turned back round to find me grandad had disappeared and thats the last
i ever saw of him. i know he watches over me though because i can sense
his presence.</B>
<BR><B>i believe in ghosts. especially on halloween,.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Here is my ghost story.</B>
<BR><B>I practicly live at my neighbors house and when i am there i have
alot of weird experiences. They all usually happen in one room or in the
hallway. THey seem to be little pranks from a little kid. Anyways the first
thing that happen was the closet door cept opening and slamming all night
and would not stop. if you sclosed the door it would open again then slam.
Eventually we took the door off the hinges. THen things like TVs whent
on and off same with the computers and radios. One night i woke up to a
really loud raidio playing, and i turned it off then the tv turned on.
THat when on all night. THe next night the hadel of the door to the room
where i sleep in&nbsp; turned slowly then closed softly then oped and was
left alone. The things dont always happen when i am there my grandma came
home and was going to the bathroom when the door closed by it self and
no one was home. THe most weirdest thing that has happend lately was when
the glass shelf from the shower fell and chipped the bathtub like 5 inches

<P><B>My nana died nearly three years ago now and i stayed with her for
a week, 1</B>
<BR><B>week before she passed away. At this time my nana had been ill for
quite a</B>
<BR><B>while because her kidneys were failing. There has always been something</B>
<BR><B>paranormal in my family but i had never known about it before now!
Late one</B>
<BR><B>night i awoke to the sound of my nanas voice, i walked to the bedroom
door,</B>
<BR><B>of which i could see through and into my nana's bedroom she was
sat on her</B>
<BR><B>bed with her arms outstretched, quite low down and her hands were
curled,</B>
<BR><B>this to me looked like she was hugging two children she was muttering</B>
<BR><B>something and all i got was "Enid, Charlie" as she said these names
she</B>
<BR><B>looked to her left and then to her right. I thought my nana might
have been</B>
<BR><B>going abit funny because she was getting on a bit, i forgot it and
went back</B>
<BR><B>to bed. The next day i called my father (my nanas son) and asked
him if he</B>
<BR><B>new any children called Enid and Charlie the only people he had
known with</B>
<BR><B>those names were his aunty and uncle whom had passed away before
i was born.</B>
<BR><B>Also at this time my late grandfathers birthday was coming up, it
was on</B>
<BR><B>March 4th, i was watching the television and out of th corner of
my eye i saw</B>
<BR><B>a tall figure of which resembled my grandfather when i turned my
head to look</B>
<BR><B>properly at him there was no body there but i did notice that my
nana was</B>
<BR><B>smiling in that direction. She then got up and walked throuh to
the kitchen i</B>
<BR><B>followed, (because of the previous events the night before). I peered
around</B>
<BR><B>the side of the door, my nana was facing me and she said something
about how</B>
<BR><B>nice it will be on March the 4th, of course i thought she was talking
to me i</B>
<BR><B>answered with "What?" she seemed to snap out of this daydream and
then she</B>
<BR><B>asked me why i was talking to myself. I went home that day and one
week later</B>
<BR><B>on march 4th at 12:30 i found out that she has passed away earlier
that</B>
<BR><B>morning.</B>
<BR><B>I was gutted to hear about her death, 1 month later i tried to take
my own</B>
<BR><B>life. I cut my wrists and as i was dieing my nana appeared to me
and told me</B>
<BR><B>it was not my time. My mother rushed into the room and found me
i awoke in</B>
<BR><B>hospital with my wrists bandaged. It was then that my mother told
me that she</B>
<BR><B>heard my nanas voice tell her to go to the bathroom and she had

<BR><B>Nasty Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: cristinesv@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This happenend to me about 10 years ago, I'm now 27.&nbsp; I was
what you would call a very rebellious teen.&nbsp; I am proud to say that
I grew out of it.&nbsp; Thanks to what happened to me.&nbsp; Here it goes:</B>
<BR><B>One night my parents didn't let me go out to this party with my
friends so I snuck out just like I had so many times before.&nbsp; Well
it was almost 3:30am and I snuck in very quietly through the front door.&nbsp;
I knew my parents wouldn't hear cuz they were upstairs. I figured if they
questioned me, I would tell them I fell asleep watching the tube.</B>
<BR><B>I got into my PJ's.&nbsp; As&nbsp; I was lying in bed and I was
about to fall in to deep sleep I felt just a slight touch of caressing
on my hair.&nbsp; At first I thought it was the air, but then I began feeling
it towards my back.&nbsp; I was on my stomach&nbsp; and the touching just
became real hard and rough.&nbsp; I was about to jump out of bed, but I
was just so scared of what I was going to see. I made a small jerk and
as I slightly moved, I felt the matress rise as if someone were sitting
on it.&nbsp; I was alone in the room and I knew I had to get the courage
to turn over or at least lift my head to see.</B>
<BR><B>As I lifted my head towards the door I saw a white-colored floating
cloud go right through my bedroom door.</B>
<BR><B>After that , I never, ever snuck out of my parents home.&nbsp; I
figured that was the lesson I needed. And in a way I do thank this ghost
for scaring me into listening to my parents and realizing they were just
looking out&nbsp; for my best interest.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Nightshift at Tarban Creek Lunatic Asylum</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ozmale@iprimus.com.au</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My name is Stephen Mayo and this is the true story of the creepiest
night of my life.</B>
<BR><B>In 1990 I was fresh out of the Army and working as a casual security
guard for a large security company in Sydney Australia.</B>
<BR><B>At very short notice I was rostered to work five twelve-hour nightshifts
guarding what I was simply told was a construction site. All I was given
was an address. When I arrived at the address just before sunset I recognised
it as being part of Gladesville Hospital, otherwise known as Gladesville
Mental Hospital. This was the place the government sent the criminally
insane, the ones that were too violent to let out into the community or
hospitalise anywhere else.</B>
<BR><B>The foreman gave me a brief tour of the building explaining it was
going to be a new administration block for the hospital and issued a two-way
radio and flashlight from my security company that had been left at the
site for the duration of the contract.</B>
<BR><B>Before leaving for the night he pointed to several half buried bunker
type buildings spread across a large hill nearby and said thats where
the patients are locked up at night, you will hear them but dont worry
they cant get out.</B>
<BR><B>The building was a large two-story sandstone block structure built
in 1830 or thereabouts. The structure was almost a shell in that the complete
second level wooden flooring had been removed and a lot of the ground floor
was missing as well making it dangerous to move about in the dark. There
was no electricity.</B>
<BR><B>The building was located next to a flowing creek that was heavily
lined with weeping willow trees that were so close they touch the building
with the slightest breeze. It was a windy night.</B>
<BR><B>Around sunset I discovered that the batteries in my flashlight were
virtually flat and my two-way radio appeared to be in much the same condition.
I informed my company of the situation and they told me to do the best
I could and they would try and get someone out during the night with fresh
batteries. I will tell you now that they never showed up. It was getting
dark fast, so I thought Id do a search through the building and try to
find another torch, or some form of lighting. I never did.</B>
<BR><B>Unfortunately however, when searching the building I did find out
the name of the creek. In the room that was used to display architectural
plans I made the mistake of looking at the name of the project which was
written on some plans that were laid out on a table. The project was called
The Tarban Creek Lunatic Asylum Building Restoration Project.</B>
<BR><B>Now I had about eleven hours to go, cut off from outside help, alone
in the dark inside the ruins of a former lunatic asylum with the modern
working version literally a stones throw from my location.</B>
<BR><B>I found myself looking towards the sky thinking how it was going
to be an interesting shift. I noticed the moon had risen for the night,
and yes it was full.</B>
<BR><B>I could see long strands of fast moving clouds moving across the
full moon as the weeping willows belted and scrapped the side of the sandstone
building and tin roof.</B>
<BR><B>Then it began, the thing that made me feel really at home. The patients
from the bunkers at Gladesville Mental Hospital started to howl and moan
like tortured animals. I am serious they were actually howling, I have
never heard anything like it before or since.</B>
<BR><B>Pumped with adrenalin out of the fear of bumping into an escaped
patient I spent most of the shift exploring the building and surrounds
with the constant feeling of being watched. I had frequent cold chills
running through my body and found my hand reaching for my sidearm on more
then one occasion.</B>
<BR><B>Even with my best efforts to conserve the batteries in the flashlight
it gave up completely around 1am. By this time I had a good knowledge of
my surroundings and had grown more relaxed. The howling had slowed, with
now only the occasional relapse set off by one patient with the others
joining in as if by some primal instinct.</B>
<BR><B>I now had less then five hours to get through the shift and knew
now that I would be fine. I had found an old wooden chair and placed it
against the front wall of a small-detached building at the rear of the
main in a position that gave the best vantage to see anyone approaching.
The detached building was made of the same sandstone blocks as the main
and appeared to be some kind of tool shed. The only access was a single
door and window at the front between which I placed the chair with my back
against the wall for safety.</B>
<BR><B>By 5:30am the overnight winds had completely stopped and a thick
fog rolled up from the nearby creek, which somehow seemed fitting. There
was only 30 minutes until I could go home and I had now relaxed as the
sun was starting to make an appearance. Then it happened!</B>
<BR><B>I stood up to stretch my legs in anticipation of going home and
made the mistake of having another look through the tool-shed window.</B>
<BR><B>I put my face up to the glass cupping my hands against the window
so I could see inside as sunlight was now reflecting against the glass.
My heart almost stopped. Sitting there on a chair at the bench facing the
window was a person with their head hung forward facing down. I jumped
back from the window to gather my thoughts. After a moment I looked again
and the person was still there, but this time he looked up. It was a young
man with shaggy blonde hair, his eyes looked inhuman; his face was contorted
as if in pain. He did not react to my presence, but just kept looking straight
into my eyes without a sound.</B>
<BR><B>That was enough for me; I quickly put my flashlight and radio back
in the office, headed straight for my car and the exit gate. I made up
some lame excuse for not being able to complete the other rostered shifts
and never went back.</B>

<P><B>I was watching a show late one night in our cottage in</B>
<BR><B>Marshfield. It was on ghost and I was kind of getting</B>
<BR><B>spooked. My mom told me to stop worrying because there</B>
<BR><B>were no such things as ghosts. I got angry and jumped</B>
<BR><B>to my feet and told her that they were real and that</B>
<BR><B>one day she might meet one.</B>
<BR><B>Now the house had been owned by a kind old lady named</B>
<BR><B>Alice. She had died years ago, and everytime you would</B>
<BR><B>walk into the house you could feel a peaceful</B>

<BR><B>this and felt right at home. I guess that's why I</B>

<BR><B>Anyway that night my mom woke to the sound of a</B>
<BR><B>clicking outside her room. She went to check to see</B>
<BR><B>what it was and found that the heat had been turned up</B>
<BR><B>to 100 degrees. None of us felt it or woke up from</B>
<BR><B>this. Later, around 2:00am, both my mom and dad</B>
<BR><B>smelled ego waffles cooking. They went downstairs and</B>
<BR><B>there in the kitchen a read light glowed from the</B>
<BR><B>toaster that had somehow turned on. My mom said she</B>
<BR><B>was sorry and that she did believe. My mom also heard</B>

<BR><B>Odd Things</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: i_rage@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was a teenager, I still lived at home with my parents. My
father had</B>
<BR><B>a downstairs bedroom, my mother and myself each had an upstairs
bedroom.</B>
<BR><B>For about a month, we had noticed odd little things happening around
our</B>
<BR><B>house...things inexplicably moved to different places in the house,
noises,</B>
<BR><B>the hall light chain swinging...</B>
<BR><B>We joked about it but didn't really think anything much more about
the</B>
<BR><B>events. They seemed trivial and certainly weren't frightening.</B>
<BR><B>One evening I came home quite late and went upstairs to bed. My
father was</B>
<BR><B>asleep downstairs and my mother, with her faithful little dog next
to her,</B>
<BR><B>lay awake reading in her bed. I went to my room and settled into
bed.</B>
<BR><B>Within a few minutes, one of our cats came flying into my room,
jumped on my</B>
<BR><B>chest and dug his claws into me. He was terrified. Immediately there
was a</B>
<BR><B>tremendous pounding at the front door. It was nothing less than
violent and</B>
<BR><B>frantic....</B>
<BR><B>I got up, went to my mom's room (it was around 1:30 AM, no one should
be at</B>
<BR><B>that door...) and there was my mom with the dog on her lap SHAKING
with</B>
<BR><B>fear...</B>
<BR><B>The pounding quickly became what could only be described as "tired"...it</B>
<BR><B>never really stopped, but there was a definite sign of fatigue in
the</B>
<BR><B>effort.</B>
<BR><B>I ran downstairs and, to my disbelief, had to wake my sleeping father.
He</B>
<BR><B>threw his pants on, grumbling about "Who the hell is here at this
hour..."</B>
<BR><B>and he walked to answer the door. By now the pounding sounded like
a dying</B>
<BR><B>person's heart would be it's final beats...Deliberate, slow and
with much</B>
<BR><B>effort.</B>
<BR><B>I stood by the hallway as my father reached for the door. He opened
it and</B>
<BR><B>there was NOTHING there...no person, no person running down the</B>
<BR><B>street...NOTHING and NO ONE.</B>
<BR><B>That pounding had continued until the second he opened that door.</B>
<BR><B>Nothing ever happened in our house again after that. I am 20-some
years</B>
<BR><B>older and have never forgotten a single detail of that night, nor
has the</B>
<BR><B>chill in my spine ever left me when I think about it. It only lasted
about 3</B>
<BR><B>or 4 minutes but I will remember it forever.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Okinawan Hauntings Dorm 148</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Carmen.Hartmann@kadena.af.mil</B><B></B>

<P><B>I live on Kadena AB Okinawa, Japan. My first really haunting experience
with ghosts came from living at the old "H" style dormitories that are
condemned now and being torn down. Unfortunately on this island, under
military contracts with the locals they have to leave a building standing
for 40 years before tearing it down, so you can imagine how old some of
these buildings are. The dormitory I lived in was haunted, all the old
"H" style dorms are or were haunted while they were still erect. (They
call them "H" style from the shape they make; Two floors on one side of
the "H" and two on the other with two floors connecting them together directly
in the middle. And in the middle area was where our "Dayrooms" are, or
living room, and a kitchenette) Anyways we lived in rooms about six foot
by six foot with a smallish 2'x3' window. No blinds, and a three foot cement
ledge that runs outside your window on the second floor all the way around
the building. The stairwells are located at each end of the long side of
the "H" and two stairwells at opposite ends leading down into the living
room area inside in the center of each hallway. The bathrooms are like
college dorms and have five individual showers and then five toilets and
three urinals on the opposite side, divided by two walls and four sinks.
Three of the four actual floors with rooms were male and the fourth was
a strictly female floor.</B>
<BR><B>The ghosts made themselves known to me about the second month that
I had lived there. I remember sleeping in my rather small single bed in
a nearly pitch black room. Even though I had a window that faced out to
where the street lights shown brightly in, no light shown in through my
window that night. My window was cracked, and there was no breeze to blow
in. I heard what sounded like a loud crash, like a door slamming shut,
although my bed was right next to the door so I knew it wasn't mine. I
was terrified, and I was cold all over. I hid under the covers until I
knew it was daylight again. In the morning when I finally dared to stick
my out, I found that all of my picture frames that were sitting on my dresser
top had all been tipper over face down. I couldn't explain it.</B>
<BR><B>That wasn't the only thing that gave the idea that there were ghosts
among us. The communal shower heads had the amazing power to turn themselves
on and off. I would be showering for work at 0400 in the morning and because
the other showers were so close I knew there was no one else in the bathroom
with me and the other showers would randomly turn themselves on. Teh toilets
would flush themselves and the sinks could run water all day. The carpeting
in the hallway outside the bathrooms, in fact, was always soggy from the
water overflowing from the bathroom. The boys bathrooms on the other three
floors suffered the same incidents.</B>
<BR><B>One specific occasion that really sent chills down my spine was
once again early in the morning about 0400. Everyone else in my dorm woke
at a more Godly hour, so I was the only one prowlying the hallways. My
room was clear the the far end of the dorm and also closest to a stairwell
leading out to the parkinglot. I was walking from the bathroom to my room
when I had a creepy chill crawl down my back. It felt like someone was
watching me, I tried to shake it off as&nbsp; just being paranoid and silly,
but I couldn't chake it. I didn't dare turn around until I finally reached
my door and thats where I saw it. There was a little man crouched at the
other end of the hallway, dressed all in black from head to two, I couldn't
even see his eyes. He just crouched there, watching me. I didn't stick
around to see what would happen and unlocked my bedroom door and locked
it after myself.</B>
<BR><B>I never saw it again. The strange bathroom hydro effects continued
and things often came up missing in my room to later be found somewhere
other than where I'd left it. But I never mentioned the little ninja spirit
in the hallway to anyone until three months later when I was sitting down
in the living room with a friend late one night. We were comparing ghost
stories trying to spook each other when his face turned serious and he
asked me if I'd seen our ghost yet? I asked him what it had looked like
and he described almost the exact image I had seen. Later I found out that
many people had seen it, although most people just passed it off as being
overly tired or that it really hadn't happened. Two months later I moved
to a less haunted dorm and I sleep much better.</B>

<P><B>Our Cat Jesse</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: rar@murdymcallister.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I wanted to share my roommate's and my experiences with you all.</B>
<BR><B>We had to put our beloved cat Jesse James to sleep on Wednesday,
October 23,</B>
<BR><B>2002.&nbsp; She was 16 years old and her health had been failing.</B>
<BR><B>However, ever since we got home from taking her to the vet for the
last</B>
<BR><B>time, we have been experiencing strange happenings.&nbsp; I should
explain that</B>
<BR><B>we also have two other cats, Gizmo (male, 8 years old) and Ripley
(female, 2</B>
<BR><B>years old).</B>
<BR><B>Many times when we are sitting at home during the evening (or during
the day</B>
<BR><B>when my roommate is home), Gizmo and Ripley will go a little nuts.&nbsp;
They</B>
<BR><B>will stare in one spot for great lengths of time, they will play
with a toy</B>
<BR><B>as if they are playing with someone and will fly around the room
as if</B>
<BR><B>something is chasing them and playing with them.</B>
<BR><B>Jesse always liked to sleep on one cushion on the couch.&nbsp; Neither
of the</B>
<BR><B>other two cats will go anywhere on that cushion.&nbsp; They will
sleep everywhere</B>
<BR><B>else on the couch, except that spot.&nbsp; A lot of times, Gizmo
will sniff the</B>
<BR><B>spot on the couch like he used to when Jesse was there and then
he will</B>
<BR><B>settle himself right beside that spot, but never on it.</B>
<BR><B>My roommate has also experienced sounds and feelings.&nbsp; One
afternoon, she</B>
<BR><B>was in the living room and the litter box is in the entrance hall
of our</B>
<BR><B>apartment.&nbsp; When the cats scratch in the box, it resounds off
of the walls</B>
<BR><B>in that area.&nbsp; Well, that afternoon, the day after Jesse died,
my roommate</B>
<BR><B>was sitting there and she could see both of the other cats right
in front of</B>
<BR><B>her.&nbsp; Gizmo was eating at his bowl and Ripley was asleep on
the couch.&nbsp; My</B>
<BR><B>roommate distinctly heard a cat scratching in the litter box.&nbsp;
It was very</B>
<BR><B>loud and there was no way that it was either of the other two cats!!&nbsp;
Jesse</B>
<BR><B>was a scratcher, so after she would use the box, she was known to</B>
<BR><B>continually scratch in the box until we had to chase her out.</B>
<BR><B>Also, my roommate was lying down for a while and she felt a cat
climb up on</B>
<BR><B>the mattress and sit by her head beside the pillow.&nbsp; She turned
over and</B>
<BR><B>started to say "Hi, Giz..." but she then realized that there was
no cat in</B>
<BR><B>sight!!&nbsp; The other two cats were asleep in the living room!!&nbsp;
One of Jesse's</B>
<BR><B>favourite spots was to sleep right beside my roommate's pillow.</B>
<BR><B>I just wanted to share this with you all.&nbsp; I for one will never
forget that</B>
<BR><B>Jesse is with us still and always will be.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Papa</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: CityHighGal9576@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Ashley and i am 13 years old. When i was about 3 we lived
in our old house in Westland, Michigan. My great grandpa whom we called
"papa" ( our family is VERY polish) died from Cancer about 2 or 3 years
before i was even born. One night when i had just woken up when i was 3
or 4 years old, i saw a figure between my bed and our kitchen threshold
(i slept in our living room because i had problems with my room- another
story for later) and i dont know why but i was totally calm and i just
looked at him and said " who are you" and he just patted my head and smiled
at me and dissapeared.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another is the same year, around chrismas,
i had one of those dreams where you have a falling sensation and i awoke
to him and again was very calm and said " can you please get me a glass
of water, im thirsty" he got up and walked (?) into our kitchen and i heard
shuffling on our&nbsp; carpet so i know i wasent dreaming and handed me
a glass of water. the next morning i woke up and my grandma (i live w/
her) asked me where i got the glass of water since i could not reach the
sink nor the&nbsp; cupboard w/ the glasses at the time and i replied "
some old guy gave it to me last night" and she asked me who and i said
"i dont know" and she said "well, what did he look like?" and then i perfectly
(so she told me when i was older) described my great grandpa whom they
called "papa" whose hospital bed had been pushed into the same corner as
my little toddler bed was placed about a month before he died, inn the
smae spot as i'd been sleeping and seeing him..</B>

<BR><B>Paranormal Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sheanewyork@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My first that I can remember, is when my sister and I were eating
spaghetti one night.&nbsp; My mom and dad had left for the evening, and
it was up to my sister and I to make ourselves dinner.&nbsp; So, we heated
up some spaghetti from the night before.&nbsp; My sister and I were sitting
at the table eating when we heard footsteps running up and down the hall
upstairs.&nbsp; I looked at her, and she looked at me, and we thought maybe
it was our dog.&nbsp; Which was lying at out feet under the table.&nbsp;
Finally, we heard it again.&nbsp; Running the opposite way.&nbsp; We never
found anything upstairs, but we definately heard it.</B>
<BR><B>While I was looking into different religions, I stumbled upon Mormonism.&nbsp;
In the Mormon church, they tell you that you should pray and ask if the
Book Of Mormon is true.&nbsp; One night while doing this before bed, I
got a little help deciding.&nbsp; I said my prayers, and turned off my
light.&nbsp; After about 5 min. my room was filled with a red glow.&nbsp;
My whole room was red and black.&nbsp; I saw the little "imps" that Dave
Juliano saw.&nbsp; They were everywhere on the floor.&nbsp; And they walked
on all fours.&nbsp; And they are fast.&nbsp; I finally got out of my bed
and reached for the door handle.&nbsp; I couldn't open it.&nbsp; It was
like it was locked from the outside.&nbsp; I ran back to my bed, and thought
about what I could do.&nbsp; I finally got up enough nerve to jump out
of bed again, and I ran and turned on the light.&nbsp; Everything was gone,
and I reached for the door handle, and it was unlocked.&nbsp; You decide
what this was telling me.</B>
<BR><B>One day when I was 14, I was over at my boyfriend's house alone,
and he was outside.&nbsp; I saw a tall black non-transparent man walk from
one room across the hall to another.&nbsp; He was in the garage.&nbsp;
Never found a thing.</B>

<BR><B>Penryn, Cornwall</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: RCarter@MIDAC.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In early 1994 I decided it was time to see
my family's homeland.</B>
<BR><B>Cornwall was a beautiful country and of what I could remember as
a child,</B>
<BR><B>chillingly haunted.&nbsp; The town my family came from was Falmouth,
an old</B>
<BR><B>seafaring community with a dark past of Piracy, Smuggling, and Ship</B>
<BR><B>Wrecking.&nbsp; When I first moved there I was taken aback by the
beauty and</B>
<BR><B>history of the place, but I was also in a place where you walked
ten feet</B>
<BR><B>and you felt a strange accompaniment that was not human.&nbsp; I
lived in</B>
<BR><B>Falmouth for my first few months, I learned there were certain avenues
to</B>
<BR><B>steer clear of, such as this old church on the high street that
somehow you</B>
<BR><B>felt was watching you and couldn't quite shake the feeling you were
being</B>
<BR><B>followed.&nbsp; And then there was this extremely old graveyard
across from a</B>
<BR><B>newer one my Grandmother was buried that I wouldn't even walk on
the same</B>
<BR><B>side of the street and would virtually go out of my way(by miles)
to avoid.</B>
<BR><B>But none sunk in my mind more than when my family rented a cottage
in a town</B>
<BR><B>three miles from Falmouth, called Penryn.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was as I remembered the name, RoseMead
Cottage, an old soap box</B>
<BR><B>style house with a beautiful English garden in the front yard and
old stone</B>
<BR><B>walls covered in crawling ivy(perfect setting I might add).&nbsp;
The house was</B>
<BR><B>set up like a shoebox, Living area and sport room to the left, dining
room</B>
<BR><B>on the right, kitchen behind the dining room, and the bathroom behind
the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen (added on after the 1st World War) which posed a real threat
to my</B>
<BR><B>sanity in that home.&nbsp; All bedrooms were on the second floor,
two outer and a</B>
<BR><B>nursery between them.&nbsp; I preferred the sunny non ghost affected
nursery,</B>
<BR><B>much to my friends jokes.&nbsp; The dining room and upper right
hand side bedroom</B>
<BR><B>and sometimes the steep stairwell in the middle of the house were
haunted by</B>
<BR><B>a strange male figure probably late 18th century.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I first read about the ghost in the registry
of the house.&nbsp; People whom</B>
<BR><B>had rented the house had written in it, stories such as "My child
keeps</B>
<BR><B>asking who the gentleman is in the corner", or "Who is the guy sitting
on</B>
<BR><B>the chair", I certainly became bothered when there were repeated
stories and</B>
<BR><B>decided I was never to be alone in that house ever.</B>
<BR><B>In the mornings, I would get up to make tea, and I would let two
young</B>
<BR><B>visiting kittens from next door in for their morning spoiling of
milk and</B>
<BR><B>love, then walk into the living room to sit and have tea while watching
a</B>
<BR><B>little tely, the kittens would never follow only mew at the set
leading into</B>
<BR><B>the dining hall waiting for me to come back to pick them up and
bring them</B>
<BR><B>in the living room with me (of course there was the whle ordeal
of taking</B>
<BR><B>them through the dining room, cackles up ears back and a slow growling).</B>
<BR><B>The worse part of the house adventure was at night, never failing
I would</B>
<BR><B>have to get up at some ungodly hour to use the loo, mainly because
I would</B>
<BR><B>drink one to many pints with my friends till the who's its and what's
its</B>
<BR><B>were all the same.&nbsp; The end result, waking my father or mother
up to escort</B>
<BR><B>the chicken to see a barn about some hay in the middle of the night.&nbsp;
My</B>
<BR><B>father was generally elected, seeing as my mother was not scared
at all and</B>
<BR><B>could care less about the ghost, thinking it a load of horse manure,
my</B>
<BR><B>father would put on his robe (grumble grumble) and follow me down
the hall,</B>
<BR><B>down the stairs, through the dining area(aacchhhtth), through the
kitchen</B>
<BR><B>and I would enter my salvation.&nbsp; I honestly think the ghost
thought it a</B>
<BR><B>hilarious production and exacerbated the issue by catching me me
me all the</B>
<BR><B>damn time.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, one evening after a long night of
pulling my weight at the pub,</B>
<BR><B>taking out a few eyes with my American dart throwing skills, and
walking</B>
<BR><B>home thinking I was invincible against some freak spoke that found
me</B>
<BR><B>irresistible, I fell asleep fast and woke up at my usual 1:00 a.m.
to</B>
<BR><B>ritualistically wake up the parental units to escort me down stairs
.</B>
<BR><B>Father and Daughter go down stairs, Dad waiting in the kitchen,
I in the</B>
<BR><B>loo, and then comes the knocking.&nbsp; "Let me in," my father whispers.&nbsp;
I am</B>
<BR><B>done so I go to the door, open it to a freaked out dad and he comes
in and</B>
<BR><B>closes the door.&nbsp; Apparently, while I was in the loo the ghost
man decided</B>
<BR><B>to make a lovingly appearance from the doorjam of the dining room
to my</B>
<BR><B>father.&nbsp; Scared out of our minds, we decided to hold out for
a few until</B>
<BR><B>either mom came down to see where we were or wait for the sun to
come up.</B>
<BR><B>With backbones of steel and nerves of spaghetti, about 20 minutes
later we</B>
<BR><B>decided to go back up stairs.&nbsp; Mr. Ghost wasn't through with
us, we had</B>
<BR><B>nearly gotten over to the out of the dining room when he decided
to make</B>
<BR><B>himself known again by making a spider web like foggy appearance
in the</B>
<BR><B>doorway.&nbsp; We both scrambled to safety, running up the stairs
and vanishing</B>
<BR><B>into the bedrooms.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning I packed my bags and decided
that it was time for me</B>
<BR><B>to stay at a friends until we left home for the states.&nbsp; I
can only tell you</B>
<BR><B>that to this day, I still get shivers about that place.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Personal Experience in the House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jojodice18@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>hello,</B>
<BR><B>my name is jordan- and I have a couple experiences for you. I can
assure you</B>
<BR><B>that my house is haunted. I live in Independence and my house used
for be</B>
<BR><B>abandoned for some time before my family and I moved in. Ever since
then</B>
<BR><B>very strange things have happened. Some personal experiences I have
had have</B>
<BR><B>been- The microwave will come on for no reason- I will leave something
{ie,</B>
<BR><B>glasses or remote} on the table, leave to go to the bathroom and
when I come</B>
<BR><B>back they will be on the kitchen counter or other places. When I
go to</B>
<BR><B>sleep, I have a fan on, one morning I woke up to my fan being unplugged
and</B>
<BR><B>my curling iron plugged in instead. Doors will open and close for
no reason.</B>
<BR><B>One bad experience was I was watching T.V. one night and a program
came on</B>
<BR><B>that I wanted to take notes on- I wrote a note to myself on a little
piece</B>
<BR><B>of paper and set the end of the note under my coaster on the lamp
table. The</B>
<BR><B>next morning, I was in the Kitchen getting breakfast and my cat
was in the</B>
<BR><B>living room- all of a sudden, she does that weird meow thing and
hisses two</B>
<BR><B>times, then she runs out of the room at worp speed. I walk in the
living</B>
<BR><B>room- and the note I wrote on that was suppose to be under the coaster
was</B>
<BR><B>floating slowly to the ground infront of me, it landed face side
up. The</B>
<BR><B>note I wrote the night before was "stay calm in any situation."
and there it</B>
<BR><B>was laying at my feet. Other small weird things have happeded also-
like</B>
<BR><B>whenever you are alone- you never feel alone. I always feel like
someone is</B>
<BR><B>watching me- Sometimes I get wierd wiffs of foul smelling somethings
also,</B>
<BR><B>not including the wierd noises I hear all the time {tapping, scooting,</B>
<BR><B>rustling, other noises I cannot describe}</B>
<BR><B>I just thought you would like to know because I saw your web site
and</B>
<BR><B>decided that my house is definatly a story for you. I have often
thought</B>
<BR><B>about moving. Very often.</B>
<BR><B>Thanks for your time.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Maybe moving out wasn't such a good idea...</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sundara822@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I have never really believed in ghosts until I moved out on my own
into an</B>
<BR><B>apartment with my friend and our two sons.&nbsp; One night my roommate
and I got</B>
<BR><B>ready for bed.&nbsp; The boys were already asleep so we turned off
the TV after</B>
<BR><B>watching MTV and turned off the lights.&nbsp; The boys woke up in
the middle of</B>
<BR><B>the night so I came out of my room to go to theirs.&nbsp; I heard
that the TV was</B>
<BR><B>on and felt that someone was in the living room, so I turned to
look down</B>
<BR><B>the hall but no one was there.&nbsp; I figured that maybe my roommate
couldn't</B>
<BR><B>sleep so she had stayed up and watched TV.&nbsp; When I entered
the boys room,</B>
<BR><B>she was already in there trying to get her son put back to sleep.&nbsp;
My son</B>
<BR><B>fell back alseep before hers so I went back to bed before she left
their</B>
<BR><B>room.&nbsp; Later in the night the boys woke up again, and when
I came out of my</B>
<BR><B>room I noticed the TV was still on.&nbsp; When I got into the room,
my roommate</B>
<BR><B>asked me if I was watching TV.&nbsp; I was shocked because I thought
she was the</B>
<BR><B>one who was watcing it.&nbsp; She said that she had been sleeping
and thought it</B>
<BR><B>was me.&nbsp; She also said that she felt like someone was in the
living room.</B>
<BR><B>Frightened, I slowly crept into the living room.&nbsp; No one was
there, but the</B>
<BR><B>TV was turned onto the CNN channel.&nbsp; Now I was really scared,
because my TV</B>
<BR><B>always turns back on to the last channel that was on before it got
shut off.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; We watched MTV before we shut it off and no one in our household
watches</B>
<BR><B>CNN.&nbsp; I turned off the TV and ran back into my room hoping
it was just a</B>
<BR><B>fluke of some kind.&nbsp; Was I wrong.</B>
<BR><B>A couple of days later, we had about 4 other people over for dinner.&nbsp;
We</B>
<BR><B>were all in either the living room or the kitchen.&nbsp; All of
the sudden the</B>
<BR><B>door to my bedroom kept opening and slamming shut for a good 2 minutes</B>
<BR><B>straight.&nbsp; My friend's boyfriend thought it was the wind, but
the rest of us</B>
<BR><B>knew it was our ghost.&nbsp; We all went to my door and one of my
friends tried</B>
<BR><B>to push the door open.&nbsp; It wouldn't budge.&nbsp; My door also
is the type that</B>
<BR><B>gets pretty stuck unless you turn the handle and push it open.&nbsp;
We knew if</B>
<BR><B>we couldn't just push the door open, there was no way the wind could
turn</B>
<BR><B>the door handle and continuosly open and shut it.</B>
<BR><B>A few weeks later, my new boyfriend John slept over for the first
time.</B>
<BR><B>Everyone was gone for the weekend, my roomie was visiting her sister
2 hrs</B>
<BR><B>away and my son was sleeping over my mom's for the weekend.&nbsp;
He woke me up</B>
<BR><B>while I was sleeping and said that someone was home.&nbsp; I ignored
him because</B>
<BR><B>I knew everyone was gone and not coming home that night.&nbsp; He
hadn't met my</B>
<BR><B>roommate yet and the next morning he asked me what she looked like.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>thought he was just being weird but I told him her description:&nbsp;
Long brown</B>
<BR><B>hair, about 5 '4 and a little on the plump side.&nbsp; He then asked
me, "Well</B>
<BR><B>who has short blonde hair and is really skinny?"&nbsp; He told me
that in the</B>
<BR><B>middle of the night he woke up and saw a girl standing in my doorway
with</B>
<BR><B>that description.&nbsp; I never mentioned to him before about our
ghost, so he</B>
<BR><B>sincerely thought it was just my roommate and ignored her.&nbsp;
This was the</B>
<BR><B>first real sighting of our ghost and I had missed it, just because
I thought</B>
<BR><B>he was being paranoid!</B>
<BR><B>Another few weeks roll by without incident, so we thought our ghost
had left</B>
<BR><B>us.&nbsp; We were wrong again.&nbsp; I cooked chicken one night
using the oven at a</B>
<BR><B>375 degree setting.&nbsp; Afterwards, I turned off the stove and
oven and cleaned</B>
<BR><B>it while talking about my day with my roommate.&nbsp; I left to
go pick up</B>
<BR><B>something and on the drive back my roomie called from the apartment.&nbsp;
She</B>
<BR><B>asked if I turned off the oven from dinner.&nbsp; I told her of
course I did</B>
<BR><B>because I cleaned it and she saw me do it.&nbsp; You can't obviously
clean the</B>
<BR><B>oven while it's on.&nbsp; She said that she was cleaning up the
boys' room and</B>
<BR><B>hear our oven beeping.&nbsp; (It's an electric oven and beeps when
it's done</B>
<BR><B>preheating). When she came into the kitchen she saw that our oven
was turned</B>
<BR><B>on to 450 degrees and preheated.</B>
<BR><B>It's been awhile since we've heard from our ghost.&nbsp; We have
no idea who she</B>
<BR><B>is or where she came from.&nbsp; Our apartment complex isn't that
old and we</B>
<BR><B>haven't found any stories about a young blonde petite woman about
who died</B>
<BR><B>in the complex.&nbsp; I am now a true believer in ghosts after all
these</B>
<BR><B>incidents..I just hope she has moved on!</B>

<P><B>Photo Taken by a Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Ejsgirl04041997@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I lived in a beautiful condo that looked over a cemetery, now some
would think that having a cemetery for a back yard is an invitation for
ghosts especially when the dining room had a great big picture window overlooking
it.&nbsp; Well, to be honest with you the house I lived in was not all
that haunted or so I though.&nbsp; I lived in that house until I was about
ten and I never really had an experience but that was just me. My sister
was about two years old at the time and she remember this like it was yesterday.&nbsp;
She was in the back bedroom playing with her dolls and the baby-sitter
was sitting on the bed reading the news paper when my sister distinctly
remember hearing someone walking around the kitchen now remember she and
the baby-sitter were the only ones in the house at the time. She froze
in terror not wanting to move she never told me what happened next so I
will leave that at that. My Mom had a whole bunch she swore she saw her
friend running across the room into the livingroom as if to scare her well
she went into the livingroom and found nothing. Scared she ran back to
her friend and told him that she saw something. They both went to investigate
and found nothing. Well, that was it my mother got angry and called in
reinforcements a psychic and the physic put Laurel leaves around the condo
and said to leave them until the next full moon. My Mom did and it seemed
as though the ghost was gone. Until we deciede to move. We were all downstairs
when it happened!!</B>
<BR><B>My Mom was showing the house and we all heard a Polaroid being taking
my mother dismissed it and we all went on our merry way. Well, needless
to say I went upstairs out of curiosity and found a Polaroid of what looked
to be an ora, I still have this Polaroid to this day it is creepy I think
that it was the ghost saying its last good-bye.&nbsp; Well, that was my
story the picture is orange and black ora really kind of creepy looking.</B>

<P><B>Sams friend from the closet under the stairs</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Atlantica35@go.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>It all started when we moved to our house in Falmouth Maine. It is
was a historical landmark. It was a brick slate roof cape. It was a beautiful
house on a charming road. My son was only 4 at the time, and now he dosn't
remember a thing being 12. Sadly, my mother died before Sam (My son) was
born. He constantly said he say grandma standing in the driveway. He said
she couldn't talk. This worried me and my wife. We found it odd that he
would say something like that. Following these events, worse events arrived.
Sam said he made a new friend in the broom closet (under the side stairs).
He said he found her there because she was crying. The little girls name
was Mary. At first, I thought it was cute that he be-friended a little
girl he made up, until the events started getting violent. Sam would take
various&nbsp; fruits and vegtables at make patterns on the floor. He would
empty out the refrigerator. No matter how many times we asked him to stop,
he wouldn't. He would always have the exuse "mary told me to". We started
to think about spirits when he told us certain things about his friend.
He said she never sleeps and sometimes she keeps him up at night. It's
strange but he said she can't close her mouth. Strange things started happening
in the house like when we would wake up in the morning, all the cabinets
and drawers would be open. Sometimes all the sinks and showers would turn
on early in the morning. We would even come home to find all our pictures
tilted to an angle. Strangest of all, one day we heard a loud crash upstairs
in the den. We ran up to see what it was. The room was a wreck, and on
the brick on the floor infront of the fireplace, the candlesticks that
were originally on the mantle were melted and bent to say SG which are
my sons anitials. We know my son didn;t do it because he wasn't even upstairs.
We wondered how the wax was melted to perfectly form the letters. We hired
a ghost hunter that lived in Portland. He said he felt a strong force of
an angry little girl, and the house was defenatlly haunted. We decided
to sell the house ASAP. We put it on the market for a great price until
it finally sold. It sold after 2 weeks which is great. We moved to Longmeadow
Massachusettes where we live hapilly and Sam dosn't remember a thing about
Mary. We've contacted our neighbors and old friends from the area. They
said the new residents of our old home haven't reported anything strange.
You never know until it happens to you how scared you can get when there
is something non-living in your home. Especially when your kids are involved.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: juliedale2002@yahoo.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My husband was attending a conference with his work at Quail's Inn,</B>
<BR><B>Carlsbad, CA.&nbsp; It is a cute resort on an inland man made lake.&nbsp;
I spent all</B>
<BR><B>day in the room on the lake front.&nbsp; Relaxing, enjoying the
swans, ducks,</B>
<BR><B>reading.&nbsp; Normal hotel room with two queen size beds, bathroom,
desk,</B>
<BR><B>chairs. etc. I joined my husband for dinner and we returned to our
room.</B>
<BR><B>That night was very foggy, common for fall of the year.&nbsp; We
were sleeping in</B>
<BR><B>one of the queen size beds.&nbsp; Room very dark, as when you pull
the draperies</B>
<BR><B>it like goes pitch black.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I practically see every hour on the clock.&nbsp; Light sleep always
awakening to</B>
<BR><B>see the next turn of the hour.&nbsp; My husband is sound asleep
facing the&nbsp; wall</B>
<BR><B>with his back to me.&nbsp; I am spooned around him facing in the
same direction</B>
<BR><B>to the wall.&nbsp; I can feel the weight of my husband in bed with
me, I have</B>
<BR><B>slept with him for many years and I know the feel of a person in
bed with</B>
<BR><B>you.&nbsp; I all of a sudden feel that something has laid down beside
me on the</B>
<BR><B>bed also spooning me.&nbsp; I now feel that I am sandwiched between
my husband</B>
<BR><B>and a full length something on my other side.&nbsp; I was really
scared.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>didn't want to roll over and face "what ever??"&nbsp; I pulled the
covers over my</B>
<BR><B>head real quick and as I was pulling the covers over my head, I
saw up at</B>
<BR><B>the ceiling a sphere like object circling with small dot like lights.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>squeezed my eyes shut and shivered.&nbsp; My heart was pounding
right out of my</B>
<BR><B>chest.&nbsp; I know I was awake.&nbsp; I believe I went back to
sleep because then I</B>
<BR><B>was turned and looked at the clock not feeling the presence beside
we</B>
<BR><B>anymore.&nbsp; I noticed about 5:30 a.m. awake and thinking we will
be rolling</B>
<BR><B>out of bed in about an hour to go have breakfast.&nbsp; I am now
facing away from</B>
<BR><B>my husband.&nbsp; I feel his weight leave the bed and know that
he is going in</B>
<BR><B>the direction of the dressers to get his clothes.&nbsp; I sit up
in bed to ask</B>
<BR><B>him "why are you getting up so early before the alarm to get dress?"&nbsp;
when</B>
<BR><B>I see a ghost child like figure walking at the foot of the bed in
front of</B>
<BR><B>the dressers where my husband would be getting his clothes.&nbsp;
It doesn't look</B>
<BR><B>at me, only about the height of a 12 year old boy.&nbsp; Dressed
with a top hat.</B>
<BR><B>Clearly you can see the room through him.&nbsp; I dropped back down
in the bed</B>
<BR><B>and pulled the covers over my head. shivered.&nbsp; Moved closer
to my husband</B>
<BR><B>who was sound asleep and had not left the bed.&nbsp; I wasn't sure
I wanted to</B>
<BR><B>spend the rest of the next day relaxing in this room.&nbsp; But
got up at 6:30</B>
<BR><B>a.m,. and was awake until the desk alarm rang for us to get up.&nbsp;
Turned on</B>
<BR><B>the light and the room was just like any other morning in a hotel.&nbsp;
I spent</B>
<BR><B>the day there, no incidents and I was surprisingly very comfortable.&nbsp;
Do you</B>
<BR><B>think something happened.&nbsp; I told my husband, but didn't inquire
with the</B>
<BR><B>Inn.</B>

<P><B>Ramona's True Ghost Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jrv@hdc-nm.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>One time my boy friend and cousin and I were headed back home from
out of town. We were coming back from a family wedding. It was stormy outside.
We pulled over to the shoulder of the road because we were tired and needed
to rest. It was a long drive on the highway. A while later, It stopped
raining so my boyfriend (The Driver) opened his door to let some air in.
I was sitting in the front passenger seat. We sat and talked for a bit.
We felt a cold presence that someone was watching us. So we both turned
and looked at the door. There was a human shadow on his door. when lightning
lit the sky. We all looked behind the car there was no one there. We got
scared, he shut his door and we left very quickly.</B>
<BR><B>My mom has also told me some of her Ghost stories of when my parents
were teens. They used to live out in the Ranch back then. She would always
see a car drive into the barn and turn it's lights off. back in them days
her and my Aunts and Uncles used to share the same room. My mom would always
ask grandma why the car would appear and disappear in the barn but Grandma
would always tell her to go back to sleep.</B>
<BR><B>I have scanned&nbsp; an old picture of my Grandma and it appeared
to be an orb behind her. I am scaring myself now as I am writing these
true ghost stories this late of the hour.</B>
<BR><B>My mom also talked about when&nbsp; her and my Dad had just got
back in from the movies. Driven..in those days... well... It was already
night, while my Mom and Dad sat in the car talking for a while.&nbsp; They
saw a tall dark shadow walking towards back of the house. a few minutes
later my Dad escorted my mom to the door. When my mom asked Grandma where
Grandpa Was and she told my mom that Grandpa was Sleeping and he had gone
to bed early that night. My mom explained what she saw outside. It appeared
to be the dark tall man that had been haunting their Farm. The same haunting
figure that they later experienced out on the watermelon fields one afternoon.
while my mom was expecting a baby (My brother). The haunting were constantly
happening day after day and night after night.</B>
<BR><B>I do believe that I have some visits from a family member that is
past away also. I'm not afraid. I thought was dreaming it at first, but
I was wide awake looking at the bluish white glow slowly gliding over me
and my baby on night. Another time, I was listening to the stereo surround
sound which has several channels (TV, Phono, VCR, CD player, etc) It started
to change rapidly over and over.</B>
<BR><B>A while back, my uncle past away, and shortly after we had his funeral
and services. we went to my Aunts house for family gathering and to eat
dinner. Later that evening we all gathered outside to take a big family
picture. Later that Month I had the film developed and scanned them through
my scanner. every shot was different. at first I was very upset cause the
picture had a lot of glowing smear on it. every pose was very different.
during the picture shots it was already dark. as I took a closer look at
the pictures. It appears to be the figure of my diseased Uncle.</B>
<BR><B>I have a question that concerns fear with the unknown spirits.</B>
<BR><B>why do we fear the spirits that we don't know for those that appear
to be strange to us. and we don't fear the spirits that we know and truly
love?</B>
<BR><B>well that is all for now...</B>

<P><B>Ghost Hunting 101</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: GwynnaL@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>After reading the Philly Inquirer article, I checked out your website
and read with interest your article on Ghost Hunting 101, particularly
the mention of invoking a blessing before setting out on an investigation.</B>
<BR><B>I say this because I'm a Christian who has been able to detect paranormal
presences since I was a teenager.&nbsp; My family has a history of this
ability, but I think I'm the only one who has accepted it and tried to
hone it.&nbsp; I saw my first presence when I was 13, a spirit named "Eddy"
who followed my older sister when she married and moved out.&nbsp; Eddy
made himself known to me every time I visited my sister, and eventually
my sister caught on to him and called in someone to "lay him to rest."</B>
<BR><B>I continued to be sensitive to these presences, though I never mentioned
it to anyone until after I was married, and my husband and I moved to the
Haddonfield home of his grandmother after her death.&nbsp; Many family
fembers complained that they never felt comfortable after Granddad Deal
died; they said there was one chair in the living room where Granddad's
spirit would push them right out of the chair -- they could feel his hand.&nbsp;
I never had that problem, nor did anyone else in my immediate family.&nbsp;
But soon after we moved in, strange things began to happen, physical impossibilities.&nbsp;
For example, I'd wake in the middle of a cold night and head to the bathroom,
and be thankful for the heating vent blowing hot air on my feet -- only
to wake up again at 6 am to a 55 degree house.&nbsp; Somehow the emergency
switch had been turned off -- a switch no one in the house can reach without
a step-ladder -- between 2am and 6am.&nbsp; That happened three times.&nbsp;
Then lights got turned off behind But the evil spirits thing ... that's
another story.&nbsp; I'm a Christian, in ministry myself and married to
a pastor.&nbsp; Having the whole paranormal thing in the background, I
knew better than to think there were no such things as evil spirits or
demons.&nbsp; Not that I believe in the cosmology of Hell as outlined by
most churches ... But one night I awoke when something jumped up on the
bed, like a cat -- except we don't have pets.&nbsp; I opened my eyes to
see a critter crawling toward my husband.&nbsp; I'd describe it as translucent,
almost limned instead of solid. It had somewhat lupine features, but it
was small.&nbsp; It crawled up my husband's body and reached for his face,
when suddenly it stopped and looked at me.</B>
<BR><B>I was praying -- I'd started praying when I first saw it and figured
it for a demon (my word for it).&nbsp; This thing got a look like a dog
caught stealing cookies, and then it did the oddest thing.&nbsp; It shifted
and took the form of my husband's grandfather -- Granddad Deal.&nbsp; He
continued to look at me, but at that point I said out loud, "You can't
touch us.&nbsp; Go away."&nbsp; He hung his head, kind of sheepishly, turned,
and walked through the outside wall.</B>
<BR><B>Things were quiet for awhile until a few years later when my brother
called me from Connecticut to say he was afraid for his sanity -- he'd
been seeing things in reflections, and what he described was the very lupine
thing I'd seen.&nbsp; He'd been depressed for quite awhile anyway, so I
told him to come live with us until he could get back on his feet with
a job.&nbsp; He wasn't in the house two nights when I saw the thing again
-- the same small lupine demon.&nbsp; So Jack and I conducted a little
prayer tour of the house, but we couldn't get rid of the thing.&nbsp; It
didn't do much except scare my brother -- no physical threats.&nbsp; But
when my brother left, my son began telling stories of weird things happening
in his bedroom -- like his shoes being set on his bed on top of him in
the middle of the night.&nbsp; Having raised our sons to be believers,
we told him that the next time it happened, he was to pray and simply say,
"You can't touch me.&nbsp; Go away."&nbsp;&nbsp; And it did.</B>
<BR><B>As far as any of us can tell, my house has been "presence" free
since then.</B>
<BR><B>It's gratifying to me to see you take this simple precaution of
invoking God's protection on your investigations.&nbsp; I wish you many
blessings, and happy hunting!</B>

<BR><B>Another Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: giddyappin@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I sent a story yesterday, but I have recalled two more</B>
<BR><B>I'd like to share (I'll make it quick!).&nbsp; When I was</B>
<BR><B>much younger and still living at home, sometimes I</B>
<BR><B>would wake up in the middle of the night to what felt</B>
<BR><B>like a cat jumping on my bed.&nbsp; My family are die-hard</B>
<BR><B>cat lovers and we've had several cats we've loved</B>
<BR><B>dearly.&nbsp; I think the cat visitation I experienced was</B>
<BR><B>from our cat Piewackett who died a ripe old age.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>sensation was a cat jumping onto the bed and pausing</B>
<BR><B>for a second as if deciding a place to rest - and then</B>
<BR><B>I would feel it move across my legs and sit at the end</B>
<BR><B>of the bed, or sometimes the cat walking would go</B>
<BR><B>right along my side.&nbsp; It didn't scare me at all.</B>
<BR><B>Sometimes I woout loud hello to it outloud and go back</B>
<BR><B>to sleep.&nbsp; I haven't experienced anything like that</B>
<BR><B>for a long time.</B>
<BR><B>The second story is about my friend Juannie who grew</B>
<BR><B>up in a haunted house.&nbsp; She lived in an old old home</B>
<BR><B>that used to be a stop-off during the Pony Express</B>
<BR><B>days in California.&nbsp; The house had an upper and lower</B>
<BR><B>porch.&nbsp; She told me about the cowboy who haunted their</B>
<BR><B>house - at night you could hear him walking across the</B>
<BR><B>porch.&nbsp; They think he was a cowboy because of the way</B>
<BR><B>he walked - like he had spurs on his boots.&nbsp; The other</B>
<BR><B>story she told me was the time her best friend Phillip</B>
<BR><B>spent the night at her house with her parents.&nbsp; She</B>
<BR><B>told me one night they had to drive him home in the</B>
<BR><B>wee hours because he had woken up to something ripping</B>
<BR><B>off his bed covers.&nbsp; And finally, the last story is a</B>
<BR><B>bit eerie.&nbsp; Juannie had a date over at her</B>
<BR><B>housefriskyess the date got friskey and started</B>
<BR><B>forcing himself on her.&nbsp; She started to get upset and</B>
<BR><B>sudforcibly young man was forceibly pushed off of her.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;It scared the guy so badly he ran out of the house</B>
<BR><B>and peeled out of her driveway.&nbsp; Juannie never felt</B>
<BR><B>like the ghost(s) were bad or evil - rather very</B>
<BR><B>protective of her and her family.</B>

<BR><B>English Ghost Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: charlie12344321@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Here are my stories, i have attached them as a word document. Hope
you get it this time!!</B>
<BR><B>Hi, I am 14 years old and I live in Milton Keynes in England (near
London). I have never actually seen a ghost but have heard many weird experiences
from my friends. The first one is about my friend Lizzie. About a year
ago her dog got very sick and had to be put down. A few months after the
dog had died she woke up to the sound of loud panting in her room. She
lay listening to it for about a minute before going to tell her mom. Her
mom just told her it was probably another one of their dogs (she has 5)
so she went back to her room and looked for the dog that was making the
noise. Eventually she turned around to see a white faded figure of her
dead dog led on the end of her bed looking up at her. This has really freaked
her out and she says sometimes she still sees and hears the dog in her
room sometimes.</B>
<BR><B>My other friend who has seen a ghost is Gio, when he was little
he was sleeping at his Nans house while his parents went to a party. It
was quite late at night when he woke up needing the toilet, he went out
onto the landing and was walking to the toilet door when he felt like there
was something behind him he looked round to see this blue/white figure
floating up the stairs towards him. He froze still and hoped the ghost
wouldn't see him and go away. The ghost (which appeared to be a woman)
went to the top of the stairs and vanished in a bright blue light. He was
terrified, so after he went to the toilet he ran to his Nans room. He
swung the door open afraid of what might be behind him when he saw the
ghost straight in front of him stood by his Nans bed, the ghost turned
and stared at him. She stared at him for no longer than 5 seconds, then
she again vanished in the same way. That was the last time he saw the ghost,
he won't go to his Nans at night.</B>
<BR><B>Also, a year ago I lived in Bristol in the southeast of England.
I have 5 friends in Bristol who swear they have seen some kind of white
flying figure that goes over their head. It's see-through and goes quite
fast so you can only see the colour and they shape but can't make out if
it's a human or animal ghost. My sister says she saw it once when she was
on a school trip, but only for a few seconds. I haven't ever seen a ghost
but I hope to someday, just not on my own.</B>

<P><B>Ghost in my House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Liz</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Just this past Friday I had the experience of my life.&nbsp; It was
about 10pm and my husband and I and the kids are getting ready for bed.&nbsp;
My youngest daughter sleeps with me, and my husband has been sleeping on
the couch because of this.&nbsp; I was so relieved it was Friday because
I haven't been able to sleep all week, I don't know why, I've just been
restless Ive been having dreams of having conversations, but cant remember
any of them.&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember having one dream where I was arguing
with what I feel was an evil spirit, and I recall telling him or her, Im
not afraid of you and you might as well leave my house.&nbsp; When I got
up, my whole body felt so weird as if I had been scared out of my skin.&nbsp;
Well anyway by this time my daughter has fallen fast asleep and I'm still
lying there tossing and turning.&nbsp; I've finally found my comfortable
spot, I'm lying on my left side facing my room.&nbsp; As I'm breathing
out, I feel a cold breeze on my face, I open my eyes and there is a man
in my face, he's crouched down watching me sleep, we are face to face.&nbsp;
I yell what the f*** (excuse my language) and I move myself back, and yes
I am right, it is a man starring back at me.&nbsp; He is a very old man,
he is dark and ash grey in color, a full body size man.&nbsp; I can tell
you every detail of his face, in just those few seconds that I looked at
him.&nbsp; I was so scared l jumped out of bed and ran to my husband trying
to scream but cant.&nbsp; My husband thought someone had broke into our
house and he ran out to see if he could catch the person leaving threw
a window.&nbsp; I couldnt even tell him it wasnt a real man until he
came back into the house.&nbsp; Before this and when we first moved into
this house my children and I were hearing the cries of a young boy calling
for his mother.&nbsp; He seems to stay upstairs and we've come to accept
this, but these two latest are to much for me to handle.&nbsp; I was so
scared by this I couldn't control myself, my body was trembling out of
control and I couldn't stop screaming until my husband finally got me to
calm down.&nbsp; My youngest daughter never woke up, but my other 2 were
very concerned for me.&nbsp; I didn't want to tell them what I saw because
I dont want to scare them.&nbsp; But I surely don't want this to happen
to them.&nbsp; All I can say is I know what I saw and I haven't had a good
nights sleep since or even before for that fact.&nbsp; My question is,
what do I do?&nbsp; I've never seen anything like this before.&nbsp; Just
before this happening, I mentioned to my husband when I got up one morning
last week, my bedroom door was locked.&nbsp; I know I didn't lock my door.&nbsp;
Also that morning, I couldn't find my lip liner as I was getting ready
for work, I heard what sounded like my youngest daughter going through
my make up box but she was asleep, I didnt see anyone or anything, but
when I finally looked down, there was my lip liner, as if it were there
all along.&nbsp; What I dont understand is why now?&nbsp; Why me?&nbsp;
When I was telling my husband what had happened to me, he decided to tell
me of his incident.&nbsp; He didnt want to scare me so he kept it to himself.&nbsp;
He said a few weeks back as he was lying on the couch, he felt like something
was watching him, so when he opened his eyes he seen a young boy looking
down on him.&nbsp; My husband said he told the ghost, not tonight and to
leave him alone and it was gone by the time he could sit up.&nbsp; He also
mentioned on his day off, he was downstairs doing laundry when he heard
someone walking through the house.&nbsp; He&nbsp; thought someone broke
in, so he took his handgun and ran upstairs hoping to find the person in
the house.&nbsp; But there was no one there.&nbsp; He searched the whole
house from top to bottom.&nbsp; He also mentioned when he sat down to rest,
the foot steps continued upstairs.&nbsp; Ive also have heard footsteps
walking around upstairs in my kids rooms, but have accepted that as it
is.&nbsp; Ive had on many occasions felt the presence of someone following
me or watching me when Im downstairs in the basement, but never have seen
anything before.&nbsp; Can you tell me what it is I saw?&nbsp;&nbsp; Its
been eight years if not a little longer since Ive been haunted by a ghost.&nbsp;
When we lived in our apartment.&nbsp; I was being haunted and I was so
relieved when we moved that it was finally over.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>They Ended Up Destroying the House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jbrimm@mac.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Years back, I believe I sent a dream to you that I had that seemed
to</B>
<BR><B>provoke a fear in me that I had never felt before, but I digress.
Due to</B>
<BR><B>alzheimer's, my grandmother's memory has taken a turn for the worst
and</B>
<BR><B>I feel I must save the stories she told me of her as a child; I'm
afraid</B>
<BR><B>you'll have to bear with me, as my memory has never been that great
to</B>
<BR><B>begin with, and there may be parts that I can't quite remember fully,</B>
<BR><B>and possibly parts I have forgotten altogether.</B>
<BR><B>My grandmother as a child lived in Missouri, I'm afraid I can't
remember</B>
<BR><B>the exact location; for a time she lived in a two story home with
her</B>
<BR><B>parents and siblings. During this time, they all had several strange</B>
<BR><B>experiences.</B>
<BR><B>The strangest being one night as my grandmother sat on the front
porch</B>
<BR><B>with her father and brother. They had (as I believe she had described</B>
<BR><B>it) a short fence surrounding their home, and as they sat there
on the</B>
<BR><B>front porch, a light appeared down the road and slowly moved closer
to</B>
<BR><B>their home. After a point, they could make out the top half of a
man,</B>
<BR><B>and what they presumed as a lantern. As the man came up to their
fence,</B>
<BR><B>they could make out his facial features (which I no longer remember)
and</B>
<BR><B>he was indeed carrying a lantern. As the man neared the front gate
in</B>
<BR><B>the fence, my grandmother's father called out a quick howdy to the
man,</B>
<BR><B>and he replied back with a howdy. When the man had reached the gate</B>
<BR><B>however, he opened it and walked through and sure enough they could
see</B>
<BR><B>no lower half to the man. My grandmother had barely realized what
she</B>
<BR><B>saw when the man disappeared.</B>
<BR><B>My grandmother also described the story behind the well their home
had</B>
<BR><B>out back. Nearly every night, never quite at the same time, the</B>
<BR><B>grandfather clock they had at the top of the staircase would bong
once,</B>
<BR><B>on the hour or not, and then stop. This was followed immediately
by the</B>
<BR><B>cries of a baby which came from that well. They would always investigate</B>
<BR><B>it, but would never find anything, and the cries would stop as they</B>
<BR><B>reached the well. Upon asking around in town about it, some folks
had</B>
<BR><B>told them that the woman who had lived there before had drowned
her</B>
<BR><B>child in the well. That however never explained why the grandfather</B>
<BR><B>clock would bong then stop.</B>
<BR><B>I know there were more occurrences, yet they are already too far
gone</B>
<BR><B>for me to piece them together with any accuracy, and while my</B>
<BR><B>grandmother can still bring up pieces of the past every now and
again,</B>
<BR><B>she can barely recognize my face anymore. As to the house, it was</B>
<BR><B>destroyed soon after they had moved out; as far as can be told,
the next</B>
<BR><B>owners had much of the same experiences, and were quick to destroy
the</B>
<BR><B>house.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>What was it?</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:SnSKNAPP@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>I would like to submit an odd occurrence that happened to me about
14 years ago.&nbsp; I was attending a local college at the time, living
with my folks to save expenses.&nbsp; My parents live in a 1940s-50s
cracker-box house, 11/2 story with attic dormer and full, finished basement.&nbsp;
I slept in the attic dormer.&nbsp; It had a window at either end and my
bed was next to one of them.&nbsp; I had been sleeping soundly (strange,
as I have suffered from insomnia all my life), but awoke suddenly in the
dead of night (sorry, very bad pun).&nbsp; I had a small window air-conditioner
running as it was a hot, sticky night.&nbsp; By the light of the street
lamps I saw the figure of a woman standing by the side of my bed.&nbsp;
She was backlit by the light so I saw no facial features, but she looked
as real and 3-dimensional as you or I, in fact, she even swayed slightly
from side to side, just as a person does when standing.&nbsp; She had curly
hair, was short, and wore a housecoat.&nbsp; In fact, she greatly resembled
my mother who has all those features.&nbsp; I remember wondering why my
mom was standing by my bed in the middle of the night, watching me sleep.&nbsp;
I called out Mom?, but there was no answer.&nbsp; I can recall the exact
moment that I realized what I was looking at was not my mother.&nbsp; My
heart gave a single great thump that I could feel throughout my entire
body, then came the adrenaline burst.&nbsp; I stared for what seemed like
a long time before gaining the courage to tear my gaze away and turn on
my bedside lamp.&nbsp; When I did, there was nothing there.&nbsp; There
was literally no time for any human being to leave the room, and nowhere
they could hide in the short time it took to switch my light on.&nbsp;
When I turned off the light, the figure didnt return.&nbsp;&nbsp; To this
day I have absolutely no idea who or what I saw.&nbsp; I know of no deaths
that happened in or around the house, and I have had no other incidents
in it.&nbsp; My parents still live in the house.&nbsp; Thanks!!</B>

<P><B>Weird House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Cubblebug@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My experience happened to me when I was just an infant. My mother
told me this story.</B>
<BR><B>My parents lived in a little 2 bedroom house about 100 feet from
a cemetary. Prior to my parents renting this place a few things happened.
There was a man who was sick who owned the house and he had the back bedroom
of the home. I guess that he was an invalid but he eventually died in that
room due to asphyxiation... he just could not breathe well anymore... The
house was later bought or rented by another man. He was not well and also
slept in that same bedroom. He was found in that room. He had hung himself.
When my parents rented the house I was about 6 months old. Well you can
guess that the back bedroom became mine. I was, as my mother recounts,
a very active child and she had bells on my shoes. I was in my playpen
taking a nap and it occured to my mother that she had not heard the bells
for a while. So she went in to check on me and found that I was laying
there with a blanket around my neck. I had one side in each hand and seemed
to be pulling the blanket tighter. My mother had to perform CPR to revive
me. Obvoiusly I survived.&nbsp; After we moved out, another family with
a young child moved into the house. He had the back bedroom. They woke
one morning to find their son caught with his head between the bars of
the crib, he had died in the night. After all this.. the house burned down
and was rebuilt on the same foundation. The house later burned again to
the ground. The house was later rebuilt on a different foundation and still
stands to this day and nothing seems to be going on anymore...I think that
it seems quite scary that I was the only one to escape the curse of this
house, thanks to my mother's quick responses. I know this is true...you
be the judge!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Recent Hunt and Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: custombuiltcomputers@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have recently organized a ghost hunt with the local park ranger
of olustee battlefield, and soo I will send you the pictures we got. Please
do not post them until we have had time to talk together about them. But
there are a couple of things i would like to discuss.</B>
<BR><B>My name is Brian Eberhart, I currently live in Lake City, Florida.</B>
<BR><B>Recently I was visting a site called the American Institute in Parapsychology.
I took their ESP Test. You know the test that shows the cards and you hvae
to guess which card the computer guesses? Well I was a bit surprised at
my results, being more correct than just by chance.</B>
<BR><B>That night I had a horrific dream. I dreamt about a large house
and moving thru the house like a spirit, not like walking upright, but
more-like breezing through the rooms. As I came to a room, which looked
like a study, I seen a older man, who wore glasses, and smoked a pipe.
he asked for me to help him, but i would understand what he said. I then
moved down a hallway and approached another room to the right, as I opened
the door, i seen a women's legs standing between the doorway. Now bear
in mind, as I said i wasn't walking, but i was moving through. I was probably
at knee level, I would say... behind her, I seen a shadow that thru something
at me and with a screming cry said "NO, No, NO!". It was the cry that sounded
primative but full of rage and fear. I woke up right then and tears began
to run down my face uncontrollably. I was not crying, but tears would not
stop rolling out of my eyes. I hear the names, ,Hyde Stuart, Cattard or
"Cat". I did some research on the internet and found this website. http://www.mostyn.com/Genealogy/Cards/WC09/WC09_007.HTM</B>
<BR><B>Ever since that night,&nbsp; I have been experiencing some bizarre
occurances. A couple of days ago, i was visting some sites that i was preapring
for a ghost hunt. I began experiencing&nbsp; feelings when i touched sertain
things. Have you ever seen the movie 13 ghosts? Remember the sensitive
on the movie? Well kinda like that but not as dramatic. It felt like flickers
of memories that were not mine. I am still practicing on a program I have
called ESP 3.0, trying to develop my senses more. I am by far not claiming
to be a psychic, but I do not think I can write these experiences off very
easliy.</B>
<BR><B>I recently conducted a ghost hunt at Olustee Battlefield in Lake
City Florida. Have you ever been there? If you do some research on the
internet you will find alot of info, especially on haunting. We took a
digital camera, a 35 mm manual with flash, and some coffee (lol). We entered
the cemetary and immediatly , i began getting horrible feelings. Pains
from unexplained areas, and when we reached the cross monument i felt the
names " Daniel and Anthony", as we progressed to the far corner of the
cemetart, I suddenly got a pain in my lower right sied, and in my right
chest. We took many pictures with both digital and film camera when I got
those feelings. When we were in the field next to the cemetary, I remember
the right side of my face feeling like I just got hit really hard.</B>
<BR><B>Whenever we uploaded the pictures from the digital camera, many
of them were filled with "orbs" . It wasn't until recetly&nbsp; that I
knew whet those were. We haven't developed the film yet, but I will send
some to you when we do.</B>
<BR><B>What happened was after the battle at olustee, the site was forgotten
about until 6 weeks later, when a veteran found the horrific site. he then
decided to build a mass burial and put all of the bodies in one hole. He
then erected a monument of a wooden cross, and then forgot about it. The
monument didn't last even 30 years, when a different veteren found the
site and reconstructed a new granite monument, but in the WRONG place.
I gathered the info from a documetnary and research on the interent.</B>
<BR><B>I would like to talk with you more about my experiences and even
talk in person if that is convenient. I am thinking of creating a team,
but I would rather just join one. Do you have any suggestions. Don't worry
I really i don't believe that I am one of those people just loking for
attention. All of you help is very much appreciated.</B>

<P><B>Remembering the Past</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: slydogc@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello!&nbsp; I am called CJ. I don't know if this will make any sense
to you but I will give it a try.&nbsp; This is my first time telling this
to anyone except my family and a few friends that experienced it first
hand.&nbsp; Please, bear with me.</B>
<BR><B>This experience happened in between the winter of 1989 and the following
year (1990). I don't know why it started, but let me fill in the blanks.&nbsp;
My uncle used to come stay with me from time to time in a duplex apartment
that I rented. He was the one who initially told me about the occurences.
At night, at no specific time, he would start to hear noises. These noises,
he stated, would sound like me entering the house. He slept in the front
room of the duplex. (which I forgot to state was the upstairs aparment)
This room was directly above the front door. So he could hear everthing.
He stated that the door would pop and creak as if it were opening. It then
would make a slamming noise like I would do when I came in because the
door was hard to close.&nbsp; Then he said he would hear someone, He thought
it was me, walking up the stairs coming to the landing. Then the noise,
he called it "movement steps", would go down the hallway toward the room
I slept in and stop. The first time he told me this, he was highly upset
at me. I asked him why was he mad. He said that the next time I come in
the house make sure I tell him so he would not think someone had broken
in. I told him that I had not come back until just then, when he saw me.
He called me a liar and was adamant that I was the one he had heard. This
happened three more times where he heard these sounds. Each time I WAS
NOT THERE! I stated to him that if he heard the sounds one more time to
get up and take a look for himself to see who or what was doing the walking!
He finally heeded my advise and found out what I had been telling him all
along. After he heard the steps, and investigated, and saw nothing, he
told me I was correct and that he would not be visiting me anytime soon
after that. (HA!)&nbsp; As for me, even though he heard these steps, for
quite a while I never did. I got a roommate and things seemed normal. Then
one night in march of 1990, I was lying in my bed just dosing off to sleep
when suddenly I heard the front door slam. Naturally I thought this was
my roommate. I heard someone walk up the stairs and walk down the hallway
towards my room. My roommates room was almost directly across from mine
so I waited for him to either check to see if I was awake as usual or to
go into his room. The footsteps stopped outside my door but he did not
knock or open his room door which squeaked quite a bit. I laid there for
a moment when I did not hear anything else. I also became nervous because
I thought for sure that someone had broken in. I got up and checked the
hall. No one was there. I then checked the whole house to make sure everything
was in place and locked. After I found everything was intact, I scratched
my head and wondered out loud what had just happened? That was that for
that night. Nights passed and I didn't hear the footsteps anymore. I did
not tell my roommate for fear that he would say I was either drunk or had
a vivid imagination. Close to the end of April, I heard the footsteps again.
This time I got up and stood behind my bedroom door with my ball bat in
my hand. I said to myself if I see anything, I would swing first and ask
questions later. When the footsteps stopped outside my door again, I swung
it open and jumped out! Of course there was nothing or no one there. This
shook me up more than if I had faced someone, something, anything!&nbsp;
I started being nervous all the time when I would be in the house by myself
at night. It seemed like whatever was visiting my home took this as sign
to come visit me a lot more often. I started hearing the footstep noises
at night and also in the daytime. What started out as a once every now
and then became an almost daily ritual. It seemed it knew when I was home.
Even more interesting was the fact that my roommate, no matter when he
or his girlfriend were home, claimed when I asked them did they ever think
I had come in when in fact I was not home said no. They never heard me
come in. (I tried to ask them coyly as to see what they would say) When
they told me their answer, I wanted to tell them so bad! But at the same
time, I did not want to either scare them or have them think I had lost
my mind. I thought about getting a video camera from someone. The people
I knew&nbsp; didn't have one. Back then I did not know about investigators
or psycics. So I was just stuck. I finally got the nerve to tell my mother
what was going on. She knew something was wrong because I was hanging around
her house more than usual. Especially at night. I told her what was going
on and did she have any idea why this started and why was it continuing?
She stated to me that some years back there had been a shooting in the
downstairs apartment and that a man had died there. I told her thanks for
telling this now. I say this because I had not mentioned that my parents
owned the house I stayed in. She asked me how long had these occurences
been going on. I told by then, it had been happening for about 6 months.
I asked her who or what does she think it is? She said it might be the
dead person returning because he always returned&nbsp; at night to terrorize
his folks at home. She said this man seemed to get a kick out of making
people scared of him. He was killed during one of his sessions by his girlfriend.
I was told he had kicked in the door and was choking her. My mother also
stated to me that there was plenty of blood spattered on the wall behind
him and on the floor. After I thought about what she had said for a moment,
I did remember painting the wall downstairs and seeing spoltches on it.
I also remember having to keep painting over those spots. This was because
the spots would keep coming through the paint no matter how many coats
I put on. I thought I was just using cheap paint and dismissed it. My mother
then asked what I was going to do? I could not move back there for personal
reasons. I had a girlfriend whose house I thought I could stay over but
she told me she wanted to spend more time with me at my place. I said to
myself, alright then. If my girlfriend wants to spend more time at my place,
maybe I would have a witness. She started staying with me and bingo!, It
wasn't 2 nights before she heard the footsteps. Don't ask me why she heard
it after only 2 nights and my roommate and his friend never heard anything.
Well she brought the noises up to me and I admitted to her that I hoped
she heard something so I would know I was not cracking up. She asked me
also what was I going to do. I told her that I was going to move. I couldn't
take it anymore. She was frightened also, which made it even easier to
move out. I moved out close to the end of 1990. The noise did not follow
me which was a big concern of mine. Don't ask me why I felt like that.
I don't even know that answer to this day.&nbsp; The house is still there.
There have been about 7 different tenants that have moved in and out since
then. The upstairs has been vacant for about the last 3 years. I know these
things because when my mother finally sold the house, she sold it to people
we knew. I would ask them from time to time how things are going with the
house. They stated to me that everthing was fine except the upstairs. They
kept having different things go wrong up there. Thats why they finally
stopped letting tenants live up there. The people downstairs moved out
about a year ago. No explanation was given for that. My e-mail address
is slydogc@msn.com. If you have anything you would like to ask, please
e-mail me and let me know.&nbsp; Thank you for your time.</B>
