What Happened to make Me a Believer<br>
<br>
By: tattoomaiden_rockin4life@yahoo.ca<br>
<br>
I am a devout Christian, So I always avoided talk of Ghosts and
goolies. But I have to admit, I've had more than 2 experiances with
spirits. I have never used a oigi board in my life, and still don't
plan on it. <br>
one morning on my way to work, I was walking across the little bridge,
near the rail road tracks. it was really cold outside, so I was bundled
up. I saw a young woman standing on the bridge, wearing a long grey
dress. when I got closer she took off. I thought she was some weirdo,
cuz she wasn't wearing anything to keep her warm. I told my friend when
I got there, and we laughed it off. on my way home from work, she was
standing in the middle of the bike path, at the end of the bridge. she
wasn't wearing any shoes, let alone a coat, ar a hat. So I wondered if
she was ok. She couldn't have been out there the whole time! So I said
"excuse me" as I got closer. I just wanted to ask if she was ok. She
looked up, and fled! I started after her, but when I got to the snow
bank she ran over, I saw that there were no footprints. I was
like...OK! I'm a nut job.<br>
Next morning, It was a bit warmer but still icy cold. As I was crossing
the bridge, I noticed The girl standing in the water! There was very
little ice in there, But she could die in there! I stopped and just
stared. I didn't know what to say! She just stood there. Thats when I
noticed she had a little boy in the water with her. that was enough. I
ran to work, and told my friends about her, and they started to tease
me. Saying I've never seen her, maybe she's a ghost! I told them to
shut up, Because I figured she was just a mentally challenged girl, off
her meds. But the little boy wasn't even crying, or anything. So then,
I thought, Who knows? could be I guess. Next day, I did not see her, or
the little boy. I was early that day so I figured maybe she had a set
time, and so I laughed. But my friend got to work, and asked me exactly
where I saw her. I told her, and she said that her MP3 player started
to cracle with fuzz, and was skipping her songs. She got pale, and so
did I. On my way home I saw her walking the field where she fled
before, but she turned around and ran Around and underneath the bridge.
I calmly walked away. praying. The next day, I didn't see her, But I
did see that someone painted the bridge with bright orange paint, in
Crosses. I have not seen her since. I had a really up front experiance
with another spirit, but I shall not tell it. I only have one witness.
No one else believes me. But I do have a warning: NEVER MOVE INTO A
HOUSE ON CENTRE STREET CALGARY ALBERTA CANADA.<br>

My Thoughts on Hauntings<br>
<br>
By: ppumpkinpus@sbcglobal.net<br>
<br>
I thought I'd share some stories with you about some things I've seen ,
heard , felt in my life time .&nbsp; My name I'll say is C
.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I lived with my mother in Indiana around the age of
10 , some time in August we found out my grandfather had passed
away.&nbsp; This hit me like a ton of bricks because I was close to him
. Mother made arrangements to go to Virginia to the funneral&nbsp; and
be back in about 4 days , I stayed with family here . On the night she
returned I'd gone to bed that night around 10 pm. [ grandmother had
been dead for 10 years , and never been to indiana or our home ]&nbsp;
I'd gone to bed and turned off the lights and layed down , when I had
some one unlocked my bedroom door from the inside , so I turned to look
at the door when I had it opened. I layed there looking&nbsp; at the
door and it opened fully&nbsp; [ I never opened the door that far
]&nbsp;&nbsp; The door lightly hit the wall behind it and shut,I began
to see a grey smoke fill the room and moved toward my bed . When the
smoke got to my bed it moved liked it was going out the window that was
at the foot of my bed.&nbsp;&nbsp; When it was gone I layed back down
and then felt someone or something take ahold of my toes. I sat
straight up in bed and saw both my grandmother and grandfather standing
at the foot of my bed . I screamed for mom and she came and she stopped
in the door of my room in shock. She saw both of them standding there
knowing they were both gone, she froze . I asked her what was going on
and she said they were telling&nbsp; me it was ok and they would be
watching over me . At the time I wasnt sure what had gone on and to
this day have not seen they . Once in a while I do hear grandma laugh
when she thinks things that happen to me are funny .&nbsp; In the
bedroom that happened in there was two dark spots that formed on the
ceiling where they disappeared into . That has been&nbsp; painted over
several times and still won't go away to this day . <br>
When I was 19 I was going to the grocery store with my cousin and we
had to pass between two sides of a cememtary . This was about midnight
and we realised we had no milk for breakfast the next morning . When we
had gotten between the two cemeteries it was 12 straight up . For some
reason she started driving slower and I told her to speed up , she said
it won't go any faster. I said ok.&nbsp; A few seconds we accutally saw
people walking across the street only you could see threw them . I said
don't hit them , stop . By this time it was too late we had gone threw
them , I instantly turned white as a sheet , couldn't move or talk .
She said I had a strange look in my eyes like I wasn't there . She
spoke to me and I could hear her just couldn't respond to her . We got
to the store she parked the car . She said she had to grab me from the
passenger door and shake me to bring me to . I felt like something was
controlling me from the inside and didn't know how to deal with that .
We talked about that to no one for a while and decieded not to go that
way to the store ever again , daylight or dark. lol.<br>

Another Haunted Place in Staten Island<br>
<br>
By: jennsbubblicious@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Hi Dave and Tina,<br>
My name is Jennifer Vinciguerra. I have been a subscriber to your
newsletter for at least 5 years.&nbsp; I love it and look forward to
every edition. <br>
I was reading about the different haunted places in Staten Island, NY
and I was very surprised to see that the old Willowbrook State School
grounds was not listed among the haunted places.&nbsp; I work in the
facility I am writing to you about, and I assure you, it's
haunted.&nbsp; You might already know the story behind it... <br>
The Willowbrook State School was a state-supported institution for
children with mental retardation.&nbsp; It was known for its constant
outbreaks of hepatitis.&nbsp; Between 1963 and 1966, healthy children
were intentionally injected with the virus that causes the disease, and
then monitored as part of a study.&nbsp; It became public and they were
forced to stop the testing.&nbsp; Hundreds of patients died because of
the testing.&nbsp; In addition, the school was overcrowded by
thousands.&nbsp; It was equipped to handle only 2000 or so, but at one
point it had 5000 residents and they were extremely short
staffed.&nbsp; Long story short; there was gross mistreatment, neglect,
and abuse of the residents, deplorable living conditions and many
unwarranted deaths. In 1972, Geraldo Rivera conducted a series of
investigations and exposed the horrors.&nbsp; The facility was
eventually closed down and renamed Staten Island Developmental Center.
It reopened and now houses developmentally disabled adults, and there
are many agencies located here that cater to these individuals.&nbsp; <br>
I work in Building 15 of this Developmental Center. I am a social
worker with this population.&nbsp; I work a lot of late nights and I'm
here alone most of the time.&nbsp; I have spoken with a few of my
co-workers and we have all had similar experiences:&nbsp; There are
often footsteps passing our office doors, and we are clearly the only
people in the building.&nbsp; Toilets flush by themselves when we are
in the bathroom alone, I have heard my name called but there was no one
there when I went to go see who it was.&nbsp; I've heard children's
laughter through the vents.&nbsp; (We are not attached to any other
building) A co-worker of mine saw 2 children in old fashioned clothing
run down the hallway.. she went after them, turned the corridor corner
and there was a locked door, but no children.&nbsp; The scariest
encounter I have had occurred only last week.&nbsp; And it happens
often to me.&nbsp; I often hear a man sceam.. as if in excrutiating
pain.. in the distance.&nbsp; It sounds as if it's through the
walls.&nbsp; I thought I was nuts at first until my co-worker's son
came running out of one of the offices last week and asked his mother
who was screaming.&nbsp; She's heard it too on separate occasions.<br>
Another interesting point... The College of Staten Island (new campus),
is right next door and was once part of Willowbrook State School.&nbsp;
The building with the haunted radio tower is actually state
property.&nbsp; I'm not surprised at all to hear that it's
haunted.&nbsp; <br>
Anyhow,&nbsp; I feel that this should be added to your page.&nbsp; If
anything, out of respect for the poor souls that lost their lives in
this facility.&nbsp; Please feel free to contact me anytime if you have
any questions.&nbsp; Thanks for taking the time to read my email.&nbsp;
Keep up the excellent work!!<br>

Hong Kong YMCA Hostel Ghost<br>
<br>
By: quehanna2002@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
This occured around the date of February 24 2007. I was with a teaching
group(13 of us) and we vacationed in Hong Kong for a few days. While
staying in our hostel, the YMCA, on the 8th floor we had 7 people
staying on that level of the hostel. I was in the first room of that
level along with my friend Kay who was reading on the bed next to me
and Lindsay who was showering at the time. Kay and I were both reading
and suddenly we hear this high pitch, like a small child's voice, tell
us "sleepy time". I looked up and asked Kay if she had said something.
She never answered me and honestly it felt like time had stopped for a
full 3 minutes I heard nothing but pure silence. No noise from the
streets, I couldn't hear Lindsay in the shower(she had been
humming/singing for a bit). Kay never moved a muscle.I felt like I
couldn't move either. It was odd and after 3 minutes I finally hear
sound again, Kay started to move and I heard Lindsay in the shower,
still humming as if she had stopped and picked up where she'd left
off.&nbsp; I went to bed a little freaked out, the following morning I
asked both Kay and Lindsay about the voice and the strange silence. Kay
said she'd heard the voice and the silence. She said she had tried to
ask me if I had said something to her and she couldn't speak. Lindsay
said that she heard nothing and wasn't affected by it. I asked down the
hall to the other teachers, two girls, Carly and Tiffanee both said
that they hear the voice, but didn't hear the silence but they had seen
shadows under the crack of their doorway. Jake and Aaron said they had
heard footsteps but no voice or any silence.<br>
I tried asking around to other people, but I got the brush off from
most. Our head teacher said she'd hear nothing on her floor(the 10th).
So I'm believing that the Hong Kong YMCA Hostel, has a child ghost
wandering the 8th floor.<br>

House in Guthrie OK<br>
<br>
<br>
By: stephany1me@aim.com<br>
<br>
<br>
In 1991, I moved to Guthrie Oklahoma, to a foster home, the house is located on Division Street.<br>
One night, I stayed home, while the rest of the family left to go
bowling. I was pregnant with my son, and didn't feel like going. As I
was laying on the floor watching T.V., out of the corner of my eye saw
something standing on the stairs about half way up them. ( I was
cuddling a puppy who saw it too, because she raised up and looked in
the same direction) Anyway I saw A lady in a white dress, the fabric of
the dress was thinner, and it was a layered look. I actually at the
time was not scared, and laid back down and continued watching tv....
When the rest of the family came home I told them what I saw, and of
course they laughed at me... There was another room in the house that I
refused to walk through unless the light was on. The dining room, had
an aerie feeling to it, when you walked through the door way, directly
to your left, the area was always chilled, (in that same area was the
closet the went underneath the stairs)<br>
Later on, when my little foster sister was grown, her and her husband
and infant daughter moved into the house (1997)... She told me a story
of a time when she had been arguing with her husband the night before
so she was tired, but as she walked down stairs, she heard a women say
"Well good-morning Sunshine!" in a bright cheery voice, she told me few
more things but I can't remember them right of hand...<br>
I moved back into the home in 2004, and could still sense the same
things, but one time I was yelling at my children, while standing on
the stairs, and I heard a voice say "Stop it"...after that I would just
talk to her while I was on the stairs...<br>
The house was bought and sold, and the new tenants have their own
stories. My friends new about my experiences in the house, and a friend
of friend, of the new tenants called me not more than a month ago to
ask me, did I think that the house was really haunted, and to see if
experiances were adding up... and they were... <br>

My Ghost Story<br>
<br>
By: ElementXX8@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Well my name is Samantha&nbsp; and I encountered a ghost. This
happened last year. My friend Tara was having a tea party at the local
Lizzy Rose gift/tea house, I went to her party and next door there are
two abandon houses me and my other friend Emily were walking outside
and we both sat down on a chair outside. The chairs were facing the old
house, so as we were talking we were looking at the house and we saw
someone in the window. Now the house was very old, there was no car in
the driveway, some windows where broken and some bordered up. When we
saw the person we were very scared so Emily and I ran back in the party
and told some of the girls and they came out. Only two out of the 5
other girls saw what we saw then the person disappeared. Then the girls
and I started looking around the house and we saw no signs of a person
living there. Then of coarse I was dared to go up the stairs and open
the door. I agreed I would only do it if someone came with me, so
someone agreed and came with me. Juliann and I walked up the stairs
onto the front porch everyone else was watching us I tried to open the
door but it was locked so I tried to open the door&nbsp; again&nbsp;
this time I used force to open it. I finally opened the door, Juliann
and I were so scared we were holding hands we both looked inside. As
soon as we looked into the house something out of nowhere came fly at
us. We didn't bother to look what is was. We both ran down the stairs
falling and ran back to the other girls. I told them what happened they
all freaked out, so we all decided to go back into the party ,but I
took one last look up into the window and saw a person laughing at us.
I never told my mother the story because she wouldn't believe me.
Nobody will believe this truly happened.&nbsp; And I also think my
house is haunted my mother doesn't believe me but when I'm home alone I
feel someone's presents, and at night and this is when my mother is
home I feel like someone's watching me and then I get the chills.<br>
&nbsp;Well can you tell me if I'm just imagining all these things or is it all truly happening to me.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sincerely <br>

My Stories<br>
<br>
By: Victorsumfam@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Hi my names Kyle im 14 and live in a sleepy village in the countryside called Brimscombe in England.<br>
I live in an area where there has been alot of deaths but none that have been violent(that i know of). <br>
Now these are not major experinces but i thought i should share them anyway. <br>
The first story was after i had finished a phone call and it was about 2am I had my light off as i was in my bedroom.<br>
I was about to sleep when i saw a dim white light moving across my wall
i watched it for about 10mins , now this is very strange as the only
window i have points out to alot of tree's.<br>
I prayed which i have never done before but heard it help closed my eyes and sleptm, since then i have not seen it again.<br>
The next one was a day after the time must have been around 12am i was
lying in bed listening to music when i started hearing banging on my
bath(my bedroom in next to the bathroom).<br>
I turned off my music and listened to it for about 20mins by this time
i was scared prayed and slept since then i have never heard it again.<br>
Another time was while i was out on a night exercise with the ATC (air training corps). <br>
while me and my team were following the river bank we heard heavy footsteps moving along a shallower part of the river.<br>
As i was the 1 ic (in command) i shouted thinking it was one of the enemy team but had no reply.<br>
I told one of my team to go down and see if they could see anything then came back up and told me there was nothing there.<br>
This got me spooked but didnt say anything as i was trying to prove myself for promotion.<br>
This is the final one but its the one that scared me the most.<br>
I was walking my cousins girlfriend home with him and he got talking about WW2.<br>
There is a pub a secounds walk away from where i live and some lights outside it that i had not seen working for a few years.<br>
Then my cousin mentioned the gas chambers and as soon as he did the
lights flickered and after that had happened i was shivering and felt
like i was being watched all the way there and back(Note that i never
get cold and it was a very mild night).<br>
Thanks for reading i know they were not major but i thought i should tell people about them.<br>
Email me if yo have any questions<br>

Hauntings<br>
<br>
By: Thomas.W.Atkeson1@uscg.mil<br>
<br>
First and foremost I can confirm the presence of some one in the
Pittsburg High School photography dark room. I'm not sure if it was
just the long hours a dedicated photo student would spend in the room
or if it was something else but one can get a very uneasy feeling in
that room. It was the Photo II room that did it the photo I room never
made me feel weird. <br>
Two you should look into the Sky Ranch Hotel in Oakhurst California. It
is said to have once been an Indian site of some sort before being
taken over by ranchers some of which were said to have been killed by
the Natives. Next it was said to have been transferred to being a
tuberculosis clinic, an asylum came next and finally the hotel which
has opened and closed so many times it's not funny. I never witnessed
any thing my self other than near the creek next to the hotel you would
get the feeling some one was watching you even in the day. Many of my
friends growing up have been in the hotel and said it was a very scary
night.<br>
<br>
<br>
My Interest<br>
<br>
<br>
By: Shibby_1610@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
I have always been interested in ghost stories. I like to watch all the
shows about them on TV, but have never had any experiences myself until
recently. My wife teases me about my interest and doesn't believe in
ghosts. Just a few weeks ago we took a vacation to Anaheim CA to visit
Disneyland. We stayed at a local hotel just across the street from the
park. The first night we were there we went to dinner and I remember
turning the TV off before we left. When we returned it was on. I told
me wife our room was haunted just kind of joking and she said I must
have left it on but I remember turning it off. Later that night after
we went to bed I woke up to use the restroom and the light was on. I
got up and the switch by the door had been physically flipped up. I
turned it off and went back to bed. When my alarm went off in the
morning the light was on again with the switch flipped up. My wife
slept through all of it and didn't believe me when I told her about it.
We stayed there three nights and nothing happened after that but I
thought it was pretty cool and I'm convinced that it was my first ghost
experience.<br>

Emma<br>
<br>
By: awol@cogeco.net<br>
<br>
Hi, I wanted to share a story about my cat Emma who passed away a few
years ago.&nbsp; I moved in with my boyfriend and he had two cats Emma
and Hazel.&nbsp; Emma was my favorite and she became a great friend
over the six years I had with her.&nbsp; When she was about 17, she
began to deteriorate, and after many vet visits and lots of money
trying to make her well, we had her put to sleep.&nbsp; I felt so
guilty and I thought about her constantly asking myself if I made the
right decision.&nbsp; About 3 weeks after, I heard Hazel "talking"in
the hall way.&nbsp; She was a very vocal cat, but the noises she was
making were very strange so I went to investigate to make sure she was
okay.&nbsp; She was standing at the bottom of the stairs with one paw
batting at something&nbsp; further up the stairs.&nbsp; I thought maybe
it was a mouse or something so I slowly walked further into the hall
way trying to see what she was looking at.&nbsp; I looked up and there
was Emma on the third step looking down at Hazel.&nbsp; She was like a
grayish see through mass, but I knew it was her as soon as I saw
her.&nbsp; I was so happy to see my old friend, I went right up and
started talking to her as I always did.&nbsp; I put my hand right
through her and told her how happy I was she was okay and how sorry I
was we had to put her down.&nbsp; A few minutes later she was gone and
Hazel looked me right in the face as if to say, you saw it too!&nbsp; I
knew how lucky I was to have seen her again and I realized she was
letting me know I made the right decision.&nbsp; This is the only time
I have ever had a paranormal experience and not felt dread.&nbsp; I
look back at this experience and I realize how lucky I am to have had
the chance to interact her the way I did.&nbsp; The whole episode
lasted about 5 minutes, but there is no doubt in my mind that Emma came
to say good bye and to help me let go of my guilt.&nbsp; <br>

The Animals<br>
<br>
By: sportzrlife@comcast.net<br>
<br>
<br>
I have some paranormal experiences to share with you. I am 12 years old
and have a very&#8230; &#8216;different&#8217; friend. I know I have been witnessing
things of the paranormal but of course my family thinking I have been
brainwashed by my friend don&#8217;t believe me. Well for starters, I have
been seeing these sparks. They are of various colors (yellow, green,
purple, and red) but I thought nothing of them until my friend who
happens to be an expert at things like these (she also introduced me to
your website) explained to me that they could possibly be spirits of
some sort. For some reason I guessed that they were animals because I
am an animal lover and take part in things that help them. To help me
out, my friend slept over and told me she saw a black blob floating
about my room near my lamp especially. I didn&#8217;t necessarily believe her
but I will get to that later. She also woke me up in the middle of the
night to tell me that she was hearing voices coming from the corner of
my room (a little girl and a man&#8217;s voice). Since I was half asleep and
petrified (especially since I happened to be sleeping near the corner
of the room) I told her to shut the hell up and go back to sleep. Two
nights later I couldn&#8217;t sleep so I kept the door open which I usually
don&#8217;t do. There is a wind chime in the hallway which I could see from
my bed. I have string Christmas lights around where my wall meets my
ceiling. I could see the reflection of the lights in the wind chime so
I could see the wind chime swinging back and fourth. I thought that was
because I had just turned off the light near there and maybe brushed
against it but it began to swing faster then slower then faster. There
is no heating vent there. <br>
That same night, I heard the voices (man yelling, baby&#8217;s crying, and
little girl talking.) Weeks later, I figured out what the sparks
represented. I was sitting in the living room listening to my ipod one
night with all the lights on that floor shut off (despite the fact that
I am afraid of the dark). I saw the yellow spark at the corner of my
eye and just ignored it since I am so used to them. Suddenly, the spark
got bigger and bigger until it turned into a white cat which meowed
once and disappeared. The cat kept reappearing but I was not afraid.
Later on that night, I woke up to a dog barking at about 9:00 (I was
really tired). I have noted that I have been hearing that bark for a
long time at that exact time. I always thought it was my neighbor&#8217;s dog
until I looked into the corner of my room and saw the purple spark
which also got bigger and bigger but this time turned into a cute l
ittle puppy. I myself have a dog but he was a large German Sheppard and
I was looking at a golden retriever puppy. I also figured out that the
red spark is a baby seal. A few nights later I was on the phone with
the same friend I was telling you about and I saw the black blob
floating near the lamp. That&#8217;s all for now.<br>

Clarinda Academy<br>
<br>
By: j_ann7911@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
My name is Jayanne and I am a Registered Nurse.&nbsp; In my 20 some yrs
of nursing I have experienced things at work that are hard to believe
as well as things in my personal life that have left me wondering if I
was seeing and feeling what I did.&nbsp; I was just browing your site
after looking at Juicee News Daily re hauntings in Iowa.&nbsp; I live
in Corning, Iowa and worked at the Clarinda Academy for a little over 2
yrs.&nbsp; The Clarinda Academy in on the north side of Clarinda, birth
place of Glen Miller.&nbsp; The Academy in on the grounds of the
Clarinda Mental Health Institue and we rent part of it to house around
250 kids from all over the USA.&nbsp; The Building where the class
rooms are and offices sits just to the west of the hospital is now
called The Clarinda Treatment Complex and still houses patiens with
mental disabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know all of the history but
now some.&nbsp; At the south side of the hospital is the origal Federal
Prison that is attached to the hospital by underground tunnels.&nbsp;
There is over a mile I believe of this underground tunnels and I never
would want to be there after nightfall.&nbsp; This prison is now empty,
as a new and bigger one was built on the north side of the
hospital.&nbsp; The staff use to take the kids to the old hospital on
Halloween to scare them, but from what I understand they were the ones
that got really scared in the end and wont take the kids back.&nbsp; I
also went to the hospital for my nursing trianing for my psych rotation
and at that time, 1986, there were still chains hanging on the walls in
the basements from where they use to put patients they couldn't
control.&nbsp; I have had m any experiences of my own there, they were
interesting.&nbsp; Our nursing office was once the morgue and lab and
room where autopsies were performed.&nbsp; I often felt like I was
being watched and things would move around.&nbsp; I did not see them
but would be different when I entered from the last time.&nbsp; I would
feel a whirling , fuzzy sensation around my head at times.&nbsp; One
time we had a&nbsp; phone call at around 10:30 at night from a
extension in another office and could here kids talking, a drill and
screaming.&nbsp; But there was no kids in the building at the time or
anyone else.&nbsp; A staff member threatened to walk out one night, now
this was a football player, defense tackle , for the NWMSU in
Maryville, MO.&nbsp; Who heard a noise like someone running up the
walls of the elevator then saw this face coming at him.&nbsp; We had a
hard time keeping him there for a couple of hours til his shift
ended.&nbsp; The kids voice seeing someone sitting on the end of their
beds.&nbsp; Hearing crying, screaming&nbsp; and noises they couldn't
explain.&nbsp; But what better place to be haunted!&nbsp; Also another
place I worked at was the hospital in Creston, Iowa.&nbsp; Greater
Regional Health Center it is now called.&nbsp; Back in 2001a Behavioral
Health Unit was opened in what was the original hospitals surgical
unit.&nbsp; It was nothing to be working there and have locked cabinets
open.&nbsp; Go in empty lock patient rooms and the furniture moved
around or thermostat turned down to low temps so tht when you talked
you left a frosty cloud in the air.&nbsp; One room in particular would
never unlock .&nbsp; When you took the key out it would be ice
cold.&nbsp; You would get a cold feeling just standing there and
occasionally we would hear voices.&nbsp; Nurses would be tripped going
up the hall or lights would come on and there would be no one in that
room.&nbsp; I could go on and on telling you of haunted places in
Southwest Iowa not mentioned here.&nbsp; <br>
It was nice to find your site.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also am friends with
the owners of The Ax Murder House in Villisca, IA.&nbsp; We have shared
many talks and tales of things that have happened to him-Darwin.&nbsp;
Anyway, this has been great.&nbsp; Good luck with your
"experiences".&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

My Inexplicable Experience<br>
<br>
By: dcorby@ourbrisbane.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I have no idea what happened here, or why, but i will tell you how it
did. I was young, say, 8 or 9, and i was sleeping late one night. I had
covered my whole body with my blanket, and i was playing a subconscious
game with myself. I was pushing down on the edges of the blanket, as if
to seal it, and thinking the words: "sealing all entries and exits". <br>
The moment after i thought these words, i felt a heavy, hot breathing
above my head, as if someone, or something was leaning over the
headboard, breathing on me. I rolled slowly over, clenched with fear,
and was just about to yank the blankets back over my head, but the
breathing stopped. I jumped from my bed and turned on the light. There
was stuff scattered all across my hardwood floor, which is the way i
had left it the day before, and i could hear the sound of footsteps. I
ran to my parents room which was pretty much just across the hall from
me, and woke up my mum. I told her that there was a monster in my room
and if i could have my light on. She rolled over and grunted the words,
yes, but only if you turn it off again. So i went back into my room,
walking stiffly out of fear, and curled up in my bed. I tried to fall
asleep, but was completely unable. So i gathered my blankets and went
out to the loungeroom. I walked slowly down the hall, and curled up on
one of the leather lounges. If i had kept walking down the hall and
through the lounge, i would have made it to the kitchen. I still heard
the sound of footsteps, and saw a very, very faint light flickering
across the walls in the kitchen. I pulled my blanket tighter and turned
to face the front door, which, much to my horror, was lying... wide...
open. I eventually fell asleep, to the soft sound of the cars driving
past, and woke up the next morning on the couch. I asked my mum halfway
through the next day whether she'd opened the door and left it open.
"of course not! you know i lock it every night," she said. And i know
it wasn't my dad, because he had gone to bed near to an hour before me
or my mom. Both my brothers were away, one on a sleepover with a friend
and one on school camp. This story still sends shivers down my spine
and tears of fear to my eyes.<br>

Rosewood Owings Mills<br>
<br>
By: sonicwarhawk@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
to whom it may concern,<br>
my name is nick.&nbsp; and today being febuary 22 2007, i have somthing to share about the rosewood facility.<br>
today iwas at work, im a dump truck driver and i was hauling road salt
for the county of baltiomre. i had an order&nbsp; for a load to go to
"rosewood highway matenice facility" so thought nothing of it and
whent. as i drove down the entry road i had a tingiling that started up
my hands and went to my shoulders { now i thought nothing of it because
it happens to me all the time you see im a diviner or a "water witch"
as we used to be called i have the ability to "feel the energy created
by water moving thu the earth as i pass over. most of the time i can
ony do it with divining rods but if there is alot of water or energy i
can feel it with my hands in a similar fashion"{its mostly a party
trick i freak my freinds out with} i just figured that in a moment when
i passed far enough over it it will stop as normal. but it didnt even
as i drove farther up the road it gradually got worse. <br>
at this point i started to look around to see if there were any tell
tale signs of a water main or buried high voltage cable wich of course
i found none. then to my left i noticed a feild before you reach the
main drive of the grounds, nothing strange about the feild i thought.
but then why did it seem to catch my eye? i wondered.<br>
so i whent on about my job ignoring the slight hum in my hands, and
dumped the salt in the pile turned the truck around and headed back all
the wile hands humming and i was getting a feeling that is still hard
to explain, like somthing was&nbsp; trying to "trap me" or stall me or
just keep me there longer. i know that sounds crazy but thats the best
i can describe it. as i crested the hill on the way back to the drive i
yet again noticed the field,&nbsp; and i still could not for the life
of me tell why i still HAD to look at! then i saw somthing that scared
the freaking hell out of me! twords the back of the feild near a
hedgerow i saw a wheelchair! a freaking wheelchair! not just any
wheelchair this damn thing was OLD! it had wood parts and looked as old
and decrepid as the place it self! <br>
now i had only bin away from that field for maby 10 minites tops! then
the strange feeling got real strong and i could feel a slight panic set
in, my damn hands now hurt! so i stepped on the fuel and flew outa
there as fast as a mack can go! <br>
now as soon as i passed the old iron gate that sits at the entrance it
stopped. all of it. the feeling that i had whent away and my hands
immeadiatly stopped humming.<br>
i found your site wile trying to find out info on this place to see if anyone else has had an experiance. <br>
i hope that this story is of help to you. and if you have any questions pleas&nbsp; feel free to ask.<br>

Weird<br>
<br>
By: wabtahn@soon.com<br>
<br>
Hello, I've been reading and watching this page occasionally. I'm
intrigued by paranormal issues, and I had one or two 'weird'
experiences, which I decided to share now.<br>
The first one happened at home, when I was alone (they always happen
when we're alone...). It was almost noon and I was sitting on a couch
in my livingroom, reading a book. All windows were open so there was
plenty light. Next to the livingroom (on a higher level) there's a
parket/wood floor that goes from the entrance door to the kitchen. I
was enjoying the silence when I suddenly heard footsteps coming from
the bedrooms (also connected to the wood corridor) and when they
reached the entrance door (almost next to my couch) they seemed to
doubt and then dissapeared. My house hasn't got any backstory involving
deaths or former owners, so I thought that was strange.<br>
The second experience/s happened after I moved to another city for
College. I don't know if these involved a presence but they really
scared me off. I think it was a case of Sleep Paralysis. I didn't
believe before, but now I doubt...<br>
The first one was in a pension where my roommate and I slept. I slept
on the upper bed and she was on the lower one. She often woke up before
me and went to college about an hour before I did. On this occasion she
had gone as usual and I just lay there, awake. I tried to sleep, but
heard voices. (I heard them when I was half-asleep) I was curious, so I
kept on listening. They sounded like two girls chatting. One of them
said the word 'Caroline', probably the name of one of them. I then saw
two dark figures sitting near the bed. The worst part was when they
'noticed' me and one of them got up and came closer to my bed. I wanted
to scream and move, but I found myself totally paralyzed. This torture
lasted a few seconds, but I'll never forget the fear.<br>
The other experiences were similar (very seldom occasions and very few
incidents). The paralysis. They might just be nightmares, though. I
always leave a space for doubts. But I'm glad they're gone.<br>
If anyone wants to write and talk about these kind of things, feel free
to do it. I may not answer immediately (I've got to study after all),
but I will replay.<br>
Thank you for your time<br>

The Real Salesian High School in Richmond<br>
<br>
<br>
By: kellyatexcel@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
i was a student at Salesian high school in Richmond and graduated in
06. the story actually goes that a priest hung himself on the fourth
floor, God knows how long ago. but the staff and faculty block off the
fourth floor and students are NOT allowed up there at any time. even
thought most people do at one point or another during their time there.
It is REALLY creepy. but you feel like whenever the halls, on any
floor, are empty you are being watched or followed. and if you leave
the school when the lights are shut off mid-day...well i never walked
out of there...i literally jogged. my old health/P.E. teacher actually
told us that she was working late one night and the lights on the
second floor flickered on and off and some of the doors opened and
closed again on their own. even one of the other teachers, who is a BIG
but sweet, funny guy, hates it when he forgets papers at school and has
to come back at NIGHT and get them...he told our senior religion class
he gets scared....salesian high school may look pretty...but if you
know the building and you have psychics in your family...you learn a
little more there than just what they teach out of the books. ACTUALLY,
sorry i know this is long but i have another story :) they take roll
before each class to make sure nobody ditches, but one day an off duty
teacher was getting the roll sheats from the class, and she was going
down the stairway closer to the deans office, on the third floor going
down, but she saw two young boys in old lettermen sweaters...but it
didnt click in her mind at the time...she asked, "why arent you two in
class?..." and this story was told to us by a teacher who has NEVER
lied to his students. but he told us that they looked at her, laughed,
and dissapeared........SCARY!!!!! i would have ran out...but i found
this out the end of my senior year....so i just decided to stick out
the last couple months and when the bell rings get out...first LoL :)
but thats&nbsp; what i know about my high school...if you would like to
email me back you are more than welcome to :)<br>

Where I Used To Live<br>
<br>
By: collins0220@btinternet.com<br>
<br>
Just under 38 years ago, when I was roughly 6 months old, my family and
I moved from a Victorian home to a modern 4 bedroomed maisonette, in a
redevelopement area of London.<br>
From as early as I can remember, I had always felt someone stroking my
head when I was 'not quite' asleep, I beleive I was no older then two
years old because after that time I was moved from that bedroom where
it always happened to share a bedroom with the younger of my two older
sisters. That experience in itself is not very convincing of ghostly
activity, but as the years went past the experiences became more and
more frequent. And of course for time consuming sake I will condense
the events.<br>
We as a family all (except my father) experienced noises, touching,
objects moving, objects refusing to work, even after everything had
been checked, shadows/forms moving accross the periferal vision.<br>
When noone else was in the house you would hear someone running up the
stairs, I would often get the blame for not saying "hallo"! You would
also hear the sound of doorkeys hitting the wood of the stairs that led
from the front door to the living space, again noone would be there.
When you were on the toilet 'something' would knock very loudly and
urgently on the door. (And on the bedroom door on a Saturday morning
when you had hangover and only wanted to sleep!).<br>
This sort of activity went on for 21 years almost constantly. I cannot
actually remember a time of absolute peace in the home. If I actually
take the time too list all the events I can remember, it possibly could
so on for pages.<br>
I will leave you with one thing though and this happened nearly 18
years ago when my son was 7-8 months old and I found myself living with
my parents as a single Mum. My son was born prematurely and was on home
supplied oxygen from a cylinder that was placed in our room. He was
also given an Apnea Alarm Pad which was placed under his cot sheet
incase of breathing difficulties or no breathing at all. I was rather a
panicky 19 year old with a new baby that had many problems so I fussed
a lot and the Apnea alarm was the last absolute ritual of the night. I
placed the necessary leads onto my son and into the monitor, switched
it on and settled down to sleep. I awoke with the feeling of someone
else in the room and when I checked on my son his Apnea alarm has been
unplugged from the monitor and switched off. Of course it may be
possible that I inadvertantly disconnected the alarm or that the
monitor had come unattacthed but it would have 'alarmed' me. <br>
There were many other 'experiences' that&nbsp; happened in that
maisonette, I hope that for the present occupiers that this has ceased.<br>

A Few Happenings<br>
<br>
By: Day9Dream@aol.com<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I have enjoyed visiting your site for years now, but never really
considered writing in until recently.&nbsp; I have always believed in
ghosts and such, but I also feel I have a pretty healthy skepticism,
especially when it comes to seeing things myself.&nbsp; I tend to doubt
my own eyes and always try to explain things away.&nbsp; However there
have been a few times in my life when I was not able to easily do this.<br>
When I was in second or third grade, one of my good friends and I lived
on opposite ends of a street that stretched about two blocks and
stopped in fields on either side.&nbsp; I would often spend the night
at her house and one particular night we had snuck into her brother&#8217;s
room while he was away.&nbsp; We where laying on his bed, looking out
the sky light centered above it and talking about all the meaningful
things eight and nine years old talk about and we both suddenly saw an
old man&#8217;s face peering at us from through the skylight.&nbsp; We looked
at each other and then back up again and he was gone.&nbsp; We ran to
get her mother, who went to search the yard and then came into to tell
us it was just our imaginations.&nbsp; We both swore that he was there
and ended up sleeping on the floor in her mom&#8217;s room that night.<br>
I my own house at the other end of the block, I would often hear sharp
rapping noises on the wall that the head of my bed rested
against.&nbsp; Many nights I sent my father out to search for people he
could never find.&nbsp; The sound always reminded me of my father's
cane collection.&nbsp; It had the sound of a stick striking the side of
the house, but there were no trees outside my room.&nbsp; He always
told me I was imagining things or that I must have been dreaming, but
we had a pointer at the time who slept in my bed and she almost always
started barking at the wall when I would hear the rappings, so it
wasn&#8217;t just me who was experiencing them.&nbsp; <br>
I work for MHMR (Mental Health and Mental Retardation) in a couple of
different group homes with mentally retarded adult individuals.&nbsp; I
have worked in my primary group home on and off for about five years
and work a mix of nights and days.&nbsp; I love this house; it has this
wonderful feeling of home.&nbsp; Not to long after I began working
there, I started to see the obligatory &#8220;dark figures&#8221; out of the
corners of my eyes in this home a lot as well as some light colored
ones as well.&nbsp; It usually happens when I am working nights.&nbsp;
The first few times my distracted mind equated them with my dog, a blue
merle (darkly colored) sheltie mix and my cat, a largely white
calico.&nbsp; I would catch myself talking to Sky or Carly and realize
that they were not there, so how could I have just &#8220;seen&#8221; them walk by.<br>
When I had been there about four months, I was in the office one night
concentrating on a painting I was working on (one of the best things
about night jobs is you can often pursue other interests) and for some
reason I happened to look up.&nbsp; The office was added after the
house was already being used as an MHMR facility and as a result two of
the walls are the bare brick of the houses exterior and there is window
between it and the kitchen.&nbsp; It is situated over the kitchen
sink.&nbsp; Anyway, the desk was placed where I looked at the window
and when I glanced up, there was an older woman with short gray hair
and flowered dress on standing in the kitchen.&nbsp; I looked down,
then did a double take, and there was no one there.&nbsp; I immediately
got up to go tell my client that it wasn&#8217;t time to get up and she
needed to lay back down.&nbsp; We had a lady who would get up at all
times of the night and get ready for the day.&nbsp; My first thought
was that it was her and that when she saw me look up at her, she ducked
away from the window in hopes I hadn&#8217;t noticed her.&nbsp; Then I
remembered that she was our only consumer to attend the camping retreat
that week and wasn&#8217;t even in the house.&nbsp; I went to check on our
only other female client and she was fast asleep in her bed.&nbsp; I
was a little disturbed by the whole thing, but I figured it was just me
being tired and my mind playing tricks on me.&nbsp; I mentioned it to
my mother in passing, but never told any of my co-workers or friends
because I just knew they would laugh at me. <br>
Not to long after this experience I got an offer to work at another MR
facility&#8217;s group home and left MHMR for about seven months.&nbsp; When
I returned, I once again took over a few of the &#8220;graveyards&#8221; and there
was a new woman working on the morning shift with me.&nbsp; Out of the
blue one day she asked me if I had even seen anything strange in the
house.&nbsp; I reluctantly answered yes and asked her why.&nbsp; She
proceeded to tell me that when she had returned from dropping off our
clients at the sheltered workshop/adult daycare programs they attended
during the day, she was doing her normal walk through to make sure that
the lights were turned of, beds were made, things of that nature and
that when she walked past the large open doorway between the dining
room and the living room, she saw a woman sitting on the couch.&nbsp;
She described the same woman I myself had seen.&nbsp; I then told her
my own story.&nbsp; It did creep me out a bit as I can&#8217;t explain it.<br>
I was actually sharing this story with another co-worker a few nights
ago and she told me that recently when she ended up working a night
shift, she was sitting in the living room and watching TV with the
sound off.&nbsp; Most all of our bedrooms are located at one end of the
house, but there is one all by itself placed off of the dining
room/kitchen area.&nbsp; This used to be the supervisors office, but
one of our managers decided to make it into a bedroom.&nbsp; The client
who was the first to live in this room and was a favorite of most
everyone he met, passed on right before Christmas in 2005.&nbsp;
Anyway, she was sitting there and she said she heard the door open (it
makes a very distinct sound) and footsteps walked across the dining
room to the open doorway between it and the living room and then
nothing.&nbsp; At the time there were no clients living in that room
and when she got up to see what was going on, the door was closed (once
opened, it stays open until pulled shut, it is a safety thing attached
to the top of the door) and no one was there.&nbsp; We both said the
same thing, it was just our guy coming back to check out what was going
on.&nbsp; He was always did want to be involved in whatever was
happening, and he was just making sure no one was having too much fun
without him.<br>

Franklin Pierce College , Rindge New Hampshire<br>
<br>
By: sm.connors@gmail.com <br>
<br>
I attended FPC from 1977-1979 and can vouch that&nbsp; The Manor is
indeed haunted. On nights coming back from The Raven's Nest, our local
campus pub , we'd have to pass by the Manor on the way back to the
dorms. On many occasion we'd hear noises coming from the small gameroom
in one of the wings on the first floor. Peering in the windows we'd see
and hear the pinball machines being played ... bells ringing and lights
flashing, used to scare the hell out of us. Also it was known that on
the top floor you could hear furniture being moved although there was
no office up there... at the time it was basically storage.&nbsp; Not
only was the Manor haunted but so were a few of the dorms. I lived in
New Hampshire Hall at the time and it was rumored that back in the 60's
when FPC was in it's druggie hayday and known even by Playboy Magazine
as one of the top "party" schools in the country... that someone had
lept to their death from one of the 3rd floor windows into the parking
lot.&nbsp; Many times my dorm mates and I held sceances.&nbsp; Once in
my room , with the aid of a Ouija board, we came upon the spirit of a
young man named Slater who claimed that he'd lived there back in the
early 1800's. We contacted him on many occasions and he seemed a
friendly spirit. Another time in a room down the hall we had a sceance
and during it the desk lamps starting going on and off wildly, there
was a burst of ice cold air in the room and then the windows flung
open. We got up and checked the lamps which happened to have dial knobs
on their bases. They had indeed been turned to the 'on' position even
though we had turned them all off before we had commenced summoning any
spirits. There were always areas where you felt as if you were being
"watched" and it was particularly creepy to walk the campus at
night.&nbsp; There are also rumors about " The Lady of the Lake " .. ie
Pearly Pond, that late at night you could hear a woman screaming that
echoed across the lake and you could see a light floating along the
shore opposite the campus.&nbsp; Supposedly this woman had drowned long
ago when she fell into the lake. I"m not sure when this occurred.&nbsp;
From what I had heard at the time ,&nbsp; at one time the "Manor" was a
stopping point on the Underground Railroad and there were many strange
"happenings" that occured on that campus.&nbsp; <br>

My Experience involving the Cat<br>
<br>
By: POSHYPIK@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
well. i was moving house&nbsp; along with my mother&nbsp; .. we were
due to move to our bungalow on the 18th&nbsp; of december.&nbsp; my
girlfriend from Canada was there to help us move to the place we hope
will be her home too soon.... <br>
unfortunately , my mother who was 89 and in ill health, took a turn for
the worse, and had to go into hospital a wek before we
moved...&nbsp;&nbsp; my girlfriend and i did move to the new address,
and told my mother in hospital how we had made up her room with all her
valued memorabilia and furniture,&nbsp; she was looking forward to our
new home... sadly she died on the 22nd of december.. so never saw her
new home as we made it up for her...<br>
As it was Xmas time and new year, we could not arrange a funeral
straight away. that took place on the 8th of
january..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my experience (well the first) was on
new years night.&nbsp; 1st of january....<br>
I was sitting in front of the tv..&nbsp; my girlfriend had gone to
bed...my cat&nbsp; (my mothers cat) crystal was on the back of my
chair., a favourite olace for her...\<br>
I became aware of a strange feeling a coolness and some kind of charged
feeling in the hallway. outside the bedroom we had made up for my
mother..&nbsp; the light was off but it was dimly lit..&nbsp; Crystal
was staring out there.&nbsp; her tail was enourmous.&nbsp; rigid and
like a feather duster. she was obviously seeing something...&nbsp; she
backed away and hid next to my chair...&nbsp;&nbsp; i spoke to her and
said something like "don't be silly&nbsp; theres nothing there."&nbsp;
but there obviously was..&nbsp; crystal stared and stared, but would
not go out there..in the end, i jumped up&nbsp; put on the lights and
looked to see if there was anything physical there.&nbsp;&nbsp; there
was not,, the cat would not approach out there.. and i became upset
too.&nbsp;&nbsp; i don't know if what i did was right..&nbsp; but i
said,,&nbsp; mum if its you, go to dad...i felt a bit silly then cos my
mum would never hurt me.&nbsp;&nbsp; but why didn't crystal go to her
after asll it was mums cat.. i went to bed to be with my girlfriend for
the company, and crystal came in but was clearly agitated, her tail did
not go down, we kept the lights on all night.. <br>
there were two other times after that that Crystal reacted in a similar
way.&nbsp;&nbsp; and i was waryof going into my mothers room for a
while.&nbsp;&nbsp; but crystal didn't mind
that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
do you nthink this was just a visit to see the house?&nbsp; would she
then have gone on happy?&nbsp;&nbsp; i wish i hadnt been a coward, and
had spoken to her.&nbsp; but wouldn't have wanted to hold her
here.&nbsp;&nbsp; have you heard of this before?<br>

My Questionable Ghost Experiences<br>
<br>
By: brandywyne14@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
Hello, these are some experiences I've had, not sure if they're actual
ghost experiences or what to make of them, but I've only told a couple
people who I knew wouldn't laugh at me.<br>
When I was 8, my grandfather became very ill. He refused to stay in the
hospital, so he was brought home to stay until he passed, with my
grandmother taking care of him. They lived in a two story house with a
finished basement, and nothing about the house had ever scared me
before. We visited all the time, but I didn't know my grandfather well,
he wasn't an easy person to get close to. After he passed away, when
we'd go to visit my grandmother (at least a few times a week) I was
always terrified of the basement. It wasn't scary, it was painted,
carpeted, furnished, even had an Atari for my sister and I to play. But
every time I touched the first step to go down there, I'd get this
horrible sense of dread, and I'd tell my mother "I can't go down there,
grandpas there!!!" She'd get angry with me, and tell me I should know
better and he was not there anymore. This feeling has lasted my whole
life, even after my family bought the house from my grandmother and we
moved in. I still hate that basement. And just recently, my mother told
me that my grandfather was very abusive and not a kind person, and she
wondered about the things I said when I was little. I wonder if some
part of him still stays in that house.<br>
Another incident, when I was 12, we found out that my father had
leukemia, and didn't have long to live. My parents were divorced, he
lived in California, and my mom, sister and I still lived in Michigan.
We decided to fly out and visit him one last time. He was in his home,
receiving hospice care, and we stayed in a hotel because his house was
so small. We had been there visiting for 2 days so far, and it was late
so we were about to head back to the hotel room. All of a sudden my
father started getting very sick, coughing, and unable to talk. I was
scared and ran outside, and refused to go back inside to say goodbye
for the night. Everyone else said goodbye, and we left. My sister and I
fell asleep right away back at the hotel. I remember having strange
dreams, but nothing concrete. The next morning, my uncle called to tell
us my dad had passed away in the night. I watched my mom talking to
him, and all of a sudden she got very pale and quiet. She hung up the
phone and told me "I'm sorry girls, your father passed away at 3am..."
She then told me that she had stayed up reading all night, unable to
sleep, and at exactly 3 am, I sat straight up in bed with my eyes open
and tears running down my face, and started talking to someone, and
laid right back down and went back to sleep. She said she thought that
because I was too scared to say goodbye earlier, he came to me to tell
me it was ok, and say goodbye one last time. Maybe an odd coincedence,
but I like to think otherwise.<br>
I've had a few other small things happen...one time I was telling my
friend over the phone that my new apartment had a strange feeling about
it, and at that exact moment, 2 lightbulbs flashed bright blue and
burnt out, and a few other little small things like that. I'm a pretty
skeptical person, but I know a few things I've seen and felt are a
little hard to explain.<br>

Lot's Of Ghosts<br>
<br>

Hello again. This is Anna. I now live in Conklin New York. There are
many Ghosts seen in my house. My sister had a hard time with the
ghosts. They would mainly focus on her. So my mother put jars of dirt
by all of the doors and windows.&nbsp; Late at night you could hear
pipes banging and someone walking up and down the basement steps. ONe
day she went to get something from the fridge andshe could hear a
little girl meow like a cat. For a second she thought it was me, but
then relized I was at pre-school. Dark figures can be sen out of the
corner of your eye and once I saw a girl in a white dress walking down
the hallway. I hope you will put this on the website.<br>

My Other More Violent Ghost Story<br>
<br>
By: bassplayer_ss_2002@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I put up a story here last year. I decided that I'd finally get get
around to putting up the other most memorable ghost experience in my
life. The year was circa 1996. I was 12 years old. I had gotten to
where I would go and spend my weekends with my uncle, grandmother, and
his father. My uncle is one of my closest friends and he's only four
years older than me.<br>
Anyway the date that the story happened is really cliched and if I was
reading it from some other person I probably wouldn't believe it.
Anyway it happened on October 30th circa 96. The day before Halloween.
My grandparents had left that day for awhile. The ghostly activity
happened after my grandparents had been gone for awhile. My uncle and I
was playing video games.<br>
All of a sudden we heard this loud banging in the kitchen. Like someone
violently trying to get the silverware drawer open. We freaked, because
we thought a robber had snuck into the house and we didn't hear it. The
way the house is layed out is as soon as you walk in, you're in the
living room. There is two rooms connected to it. The master and
secondary bedroom. The kitchen is straight on past the living room.<br>
Anyway back to the story. We heard the silverware drawer violently
being opened. Then we heard someone stomping through the living room
really hard. It was shaking stuff in our room. We still didn't know
what it was, so we just unscrewed the table legs off of our night
stand. It doesn't sound silly in hindsight, but we had to have
something that qualified as a weapon just in case it was a robber.<br>
We crept into the kitchen through another bedroom right beside ours
(Not the master room. Another bedroom that leds to a bathroom that was
built by the previous owner.) Our hearts was racing. We went over to
the drawer that was open. Knives and spoons were all disheveled. We
crept on in to the living room and peaked in all of the rooms with our
table legs held tight. We never did find anyone or hear any door slam
as if someone was going outside. It was a very frightening experience
that me and my uncle both remember vividly. I've always heard stories
of the house being haunted that my grandmother lives in. Even though I
believed in ghost. I never quite believed it about her house until that
day.<br>

She Still Cheats at Solitaire<br>
<br>

I really love your site, it's very informative and helpful.&nbsp; Here
is a story that I like to call "She Still Cheats at Solitaire".<br>
My late mother-in-law loved playing Solitaire, and if the cards weren't
going right would cheat (usually turning one card at a time until she
won).&nbsp; Six years after she died, my father-in-law died.&nbsp; That
night, my husband was playing solitaire on the computer.&nbsp; Now, you
know that the computer doesn't let you cheat.&nbsp; She must have been
standing around, because my husband was able to put a red 10 on a red
Jack - and it stuck!&nbsp; He moved it off and was able to put it back
on again three times in a row.&nbsp; The 4th time he tried, it wouldn't
stay on the Jack.&nbsp; We think it was her way of letting us know they
were together again.<br>

Sleep Overs<br>
<br>
By: star0731@comcast.net<br>
<br>
I have sent two of my experiences to your site so far. Neither of those
things are happening anymore. I do have some more recent experiences.
Let&#8217;s start with my story of summer 2006. just some background
information before I start: one of my best friends was sleeping over,
at the time, she was 13 and I was 12, turning 13 in about a month.
Anyway, we stay up late when we have sleepovers (just like any other 12
and 13 year olds). I can&#8217;t remember the precise time but I do know
everyone else in my house, except for my friend and me as well as
probably my dog, were sleeping, so that would make it around 2am. So,
we got hungry, so we went upstairs (we were in the basement) to get a
bag of chips from the pantry. Everything was dark except the dim light
under the microwave that my mom always leaves on for my dog. My friend
was standing by the island counter in the middle of the kitchen, as I
was only about 6 feet away getting a bag of chips. So, I take the bag
of chips out, walk to the counter where my friend is, and open the bag
trying to be quiet (my dads a very light sleeper and had to get up
early for work in the morning so we didn&#8217;t want to wake him) Now,
before I get any further, I just want to confirm that I, in fact,
kicked the pantry door closed, and we both heard it shut all the way.
My friend, facing the opposite way as I was, on the other side of the
counter, was facing the pantry. My back was towards the pantry so I
couldn&#8217;t see it. I caught my friend staring towards the pantry with an
odd expression on her face. She then says &#8220;Uh, Vivian?&#8221; so I look up at
her and she half-way points at the pantry. So I then turn around and
find the pantry door swinging open, rather fastly. We both look at each
other like &#8220;What the hell?&#8221; so I go up to the pantry door, and close
it. Needless to say, we grabbed the bag of chips and ran downstairs,
closing the door behind us. We were both still really confused. After a
minute of sitting there being scared I ask &#8220;I did close the pantry all
the way right?&#8221; she replies &#8220;Yeah, I saw it, you even kicked it shut!&#8221;
that&#8217;s the first time something went wrong in my house as I was having
a sleepover with this friend. Now for the second time. This one
happened in January 2007 or December 2006, over winter break. I was
having a sleepover at my house with the same friend, and this time we
were both 13. Again, I don&#8217;t know the precise time but again, everyone
was asleep besides me, my friend, and my dog. So it was like 2 or 3 in
the am. We both come up from the basement again, and we both have to go
to the bathroom. So, we stop in the kitchen, and my friend goes first.
Then I go. Mind you, this is the bathroom that&#8217;s right down a short
hall from the pantry. Prior to this, we turn on the lights above the
kitchen table because I dropped something so we were looking for it. I
find it, and we start walking down the hallway that leads to the
upstairs (not the same one where the bathroom and pantry are). My
friend starts talking to me so I turned around, we come to a complete
stop for no reason and are just randomly standing in my kitchen now
talking. I was facing the light above the kitchen table, my friend was
facing me. I look up to the light randomly. There are 5 lights hanging
from one unit-thing, by the way. The precise one that I glanced at
immediately flickered a little then turned off right as I looked at it.
Yes, this was odd considering that none of those light like EVER go
off. And even when they do, the don&#8217;t flicker at all. I told my friend,
so we hurried upstairs to my room. we were laying in my room talking
when all of the sudden, a bag that was sitting on my cedar chest fell
to the ground. It wasn&#8217;t me, because my legs were bent at the knees, so
I know it couldn&#8217;t have been me. My legs were at least 3 feet away from
the cedar chest. My friend was in the same position so it wasn&#8217;t her
either. We both heard it and it was then even harder for us to get to
sleep more than it already is. It&#8217;s not like the bag was on the edge
about to fall off either. It was completely in the middle, completely
on the cedar chest. And my last story for now. this is the most recent
one. It happened in February 2007. February 10th to be exact. And it
was around 6:30 pm. Well, my dad was sitting at the kitchen table with
me, my grandma was over because it was my confirmation day, she was in
the bathroom. My mom was up making coffee. My sister in her room and my
brother on vacation with his friend. Anyway, I looked up and happened
to catch the pantry door swinging fastly again, like what happened in
summer 2006. my dad also saw it and said &#8220;that thing just swung open!&#8221;
and I told him about what happened over the summer, how it was exactly
like that. It didn&#8217;t stop swinging for about a minute. But when it did
it cam to a complete stop. Thanks for reading, and question or if the
same thing happened to you, please email me!! <br>
