 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Today
I got a fortune cookie and the fortune inside said <i style="">&#8220;Change
your thoughts and you change the world.&#8221; </i><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This
reminded me of something we all deal
with regularly and more so as paranormal researchers.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>When I teach my various classes and discuss
the type of spirits/ghosts you may encounter or types of negative
entities the
topic of thought forms is one that most surprises people.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Thought forms can be seem like actually
spirits affecting the way a person feels or acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where
do they come from?<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Simply put, they
come from our thoughts and
emotions.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Just imagine when
you were
the angriest you have ever been at someone.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Your thought and emotions are generating real energy that
does always
dissipate and vanish.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Energy by its
nature cannot be destroy so this energy of anger or hate towards
someone often
heads right for its target, the person you were directing that anger
towards.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>People who are being
&#8220;attacked&#8221;
by a bombardment of these negative emotions can show many symptoms
similar to a
spirit attachment, oppression or possession.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Their health may be adversely affected.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>There may even be physical manifestations, especially of
bruises and
scratches.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When investigate a
case
that has these kind of signs you need to dig deep into the interacts
this
person is having with others in the home, at work and anywhere else
where they
may have someone who is angry at them and not letting go of it.</span></p>
&nbsp;<><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><o:p></o:p>Thought
forms can be blocked by using a variety of psychic protection
techniques which
can include anything from physic shielding to crystals to cutting both
physical
and emotional ties with the person who is the source of the energy.<o:p></o:p></span></>&nbsp;
      <><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><o:p><br>
      <br>
      </o:p>I
know this is not something that most ghost hunters or paranormal
researchers
are aware of but do not just dismiss it because we all deal with this
in our
personal lives from time to time so it inevitable that you will
encounter it on
a case as well.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One downside
to
thought forms is that this negativity being sent to an unsuspecting
person can
sometime get the attention of a real negative spirit or low level
entity and
then you can be dealing with much more than just someone having a
personal
issues being vented towards them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Law of Attraction states like attracts like and it&#8217;s real so people
under this
kind of attack need to have the problem rectified as soon as possible.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If you haven&#8217;t already realized,
there are
people that understand all this and intentionally send thought forms to
someone
with the intent of doing them harm.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
speak from personal experience with this and it did end up with my wife
and
friends taking me to a well-known paranormal researcher and the Priest
he
worked with to have an exorcism performed on me to break off the double
sided
attack I was then under.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></>&nbsp;
      <><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><o:p><br>
      <br>
      </o:p>Remember
we deal with unknowns in the field on a regular basis so just file this
info
away and hope you don&#8217;t need it but in case you do at least you may be
able to
help someone in need quicker and more completely by understanding how
the power
of thought and emotions can directly intersect ghost hunting and
paranormal
research.<o:p></o:p></span></>
