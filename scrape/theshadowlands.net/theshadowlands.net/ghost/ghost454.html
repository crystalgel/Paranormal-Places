<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My Personal Experiences</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: ahiruxfakirfan@yahoo.com</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>In the wooded area just behind my house, I have had three
encounters with a particular apparition.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>It appears to be the spirit of a rural resident, about
middle-aged.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>He is not harmful, although it can be unsettling to be by
yourself outside at night and see him standing there, staring at you, or
walking around. When he appears, the air becomes noticeably colder. I don't
know the history of the area, nor can I find it, but I strongly believe this
ghost was once a resident of Alabama who lived on the plot of land my family
owns now. Also, at times you can hear voices even though you're the only one
outside, and they always seem to be right next to you.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>In the past, I have seen several more ghosts. Once at my old
home, when I was about 11 or 12, I noticed my room was freezing despite it
being a warm night and the air conditioner was not on. Then, I saw a tall man
in a trenchcoat towering over my bed with this crazed look in his eyes. (next
to the bed, not over it)</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>After I assured myself I wasn't dreaming, I hid myself under
the covers and punched at the apparition. He disappeared, but I awoke with a
fever a few hours later. I know that my old house had several residents in the
past, so I believe it to be a long dead resident come back for his house. I've
also heard several footsteps at night before and a little after the incident,
and whenever one went to check the sounds no one was there to make them.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Also, at my old place of residence, I have seen the ghost of
an old woman who used to live in the house across from mine. When I was coming
home from school, I saw an old woman standing in the family driveway of my
home. It appeared my mom hit her with the van, but when I got out to check, the
elderly woman had vanished into thin air. This may have been the first ghost I
have ever seen.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>These are just some of my more notable experiences.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Our Nuisance Haunt Story</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By:
tyche37@gmail.com </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My family and I
have lived in our home since 1991, a small brick house in a suburb of Fort
Worth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house was built in the
seventies, and the area that we live in used to be a part of the lake, but they
drained forever and a day ago, long before the house was built.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We had always
noticed little happenings since moving in.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One night, we were all awakened by a dictionary that had been sitting in
the middle of our kitchen table for a month was swept off the table and slapped
on the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another time, a stack of
boxes that had been sitting in our den all summer long suddenly fell over while
we were watching television.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one was
near them at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The T.V.
mysteriously turned itself on and off all the time, the faucet would turn
itself on (We never left it on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom's
a science teacher and is very, very adamant about the environment and not
wasting water, electricity, etc.).<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It's been a bunch of little things like
this, growing up, until high school started and things started getting more
intense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night, I had woken up and
gone to go get a drink of water in the kitchen, and when I turned around to go
back to my bedroom, I saw someone move across the hallway into my parents' room
and lean over my mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sister has
asthma, so I thought it was her waking my mom up to tell her she was having an
attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I went in there to give her
her inhaler, there was no one in there except my mother and father, sound
asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went to my sister's room and
couldn't find her, so then I went and woke my mother up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said that my sister had gone to stay at a
friend's house after I had fallen asleep.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another time, my
dad was watching T.V. downstairs while my mom and I were out grocery
shopping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that he saw a young
woman walk across the doorway of where the kitchen leads into the den.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He thought that we were back and it was one
of my friends from school, but when he got up to help us put away groceries,
the house was empty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was on the swim
team in high school, and I had to get up at 4:30 in the morning and drive
myself to the local junior college so we could use their pool.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was always very dark when I left, and when
I was pulling out of my driveway, I saw someone behind my truck in the rear
view mirror.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a young woman with
platinum blond hair and wearing a yellow sundress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I looked back, she was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She wasn't a typical 'ghost' in that she
wasn't transparent, or wispy, but I saw her as you would see someone right in
front of you--solid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was in
December, and my neighborhood is mostly a demograph of forty and up, not a
whole lot of people with teenagers or young adults, so the chances of a young
woman walking around in a sundress in the middle of winter are very, very
unlikely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had to have been a ghost.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My mother and I
were playing Scrabble in the den one night when we heard someone key in through
the front door, come in, and slam it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
mom and I weren't expecting anyone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
dad was in Arkansas visiting his brother at the time, and my sister was also at
college in Arkansas, so it wasn't either one of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went upstairs to see who it was, but never
found anyone.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>September 11,
2001 happened during my junior year in high school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly after it happened, my dad was laid
off from work, had to have two surgeries, and my mom had to pick up two extra
jobs to make ends meet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was starting
to get stressed out about ACT's and college, and my sister had just left for
school, which was a big change.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
believe that is my entire family's stress as a whole that put out more negative
energy that fed whatever it is that seems to lurk in my home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Things started happening much more often, and
larger in scale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One night, we
were all awakened again by what sounded like someone tossing handfuls of nuts
and bolts down in the spaces between the walls.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A few weeks later, my sister was visiting home from college and was
talking on the phone in her old bedroom that we had turned into an office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She saw someone walk across the hallway from
the doorway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she described her
later, my sister said that she had light blond hair and was wearing a yellow
dress.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I'm a very, very
heavy sleeper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've slept through
tornadoes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So when I started being woken
up in the middle of the night by loud footsteps on the carpet and heavy
breathing, it bothered me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Things
continued to fall off shelves in the middle of the night, pictures on the walls
would tilt suddenly or fall off the wall altogether.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Around this time, I left for college in
Arkansas, and my mom and I would talk on the phone and she would tell me the
things that were happening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night,
she and my father were walking the dog down the street, and my mother, who is
something of a skeptic, smelled something really bad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said, "What is that awful
smell?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It smells like something's
rotting."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And my dad told her,
"I just saw a dead man."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
mother said, "What do you mean?"<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He said, "I don't know, I can't describe it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I just saw a dead man, leaning against
that fence."</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I graduated from
college this past year and moved back home, trying to find a job.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On one of the few nights when my mom didn't
have to work, we were in the den watching the news when someone pounded on the
other side of the wall, five times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
sounded like they were taking their fists and just hitting the wall with all
their might.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ran upstairs to make sure
it wasn't my dad banging his cane on the wall for help (he was recovering from
another surgery), but he was fast asleep.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Our dogs will
start barking at things in corners or in thin air, and watch things intently
that neither my parents or I can see.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
night, especially if I'm home alone, I can hear things moving around in the
kitchen--chairs scraping the floor, cabinets being opened and closed, voices
speaking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know it's not just my
imagination because the dogs will wake me up barking at the sounds.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I'm a highly
organized person, and due to the nature of my parents' occupations, I'm home
alone a lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So when things start
getting moved around, I notice, because I'm a little OCD and I don't like
things being moved unless I'm the one doing the moving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stuff gets moved around on my desk all the
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My favorite pens and drawing
pencils, charcoals<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I'm a Writing major
and a Interior Design minor, so I've got some pretty high-priced supplies)
disappear, get moved around, placed in different drawers so I have to hunt for
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Templates get knocked to the
floor, stories I've been working on get shuffled or papers go missing (I write
everything in longhand before I type it up, so this can become very frustrating
when I suddenly and missing a chunk of my story), things of that nature.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My dad used to
bowhunt, and he has a deer mount in his bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's been in there since we moved into the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night, Dad was out of town,
and I was sleeping in my mom's room to keep her company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We kept hearing a clicking sound, and then
something sliding, but we ignored it because it was 2:15 am and we both had to
be up at five.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the morning, when we
turned on the light, the deer mount had been turned completely sideways.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We turned it back, and it hasn't been
bothered since.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was in September.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The other night,
I was asleep (I mentioned that I was a heavy sleeper, right?) when I woke up
because my dad was screaming my name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
went into his room and said, "What is it?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He and my mother had both woken up because
they had heard something fall in the kitchen and break, and didn't know if I
was still up or not, so they wanted to see if it was me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went into the kitchen, but couldn't find
anything that might have fallen or broken.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So, yeah, nothing
truly frightening, just bothersome and interesting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom and I treat our ghost as more of a
humorous, nuisance presence than an actual threat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just wanted to share my experiences with
you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My theory is that she was a young
woman who went out for a day at the lake years ago before they drained it and
accidentally drowned, and doesn't know she's dead, and all the things that keep
happening to my family that causes us to produce negative energy (sickness,
stress over not finding a job and the economy, cancer, etc.) gives her more energy
to display more paranormal activity.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I have a terrifyingly true story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had been a fan of a popular website that
purports to share real ghost stories.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While reading this particular site about a Haunted Place in Gilroy, I
realized that I knew the answer to one of the Hwy. 152 mysteries. In 1977 I had
witnessed a horrific accident that definitely is the cause of the haunting of
the woman ghost who screams at truck drivers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I wrote to the site with my story.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nothing happened although the website shows that updates are made almost
monthly, the latest one being June 2008.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Strange I thought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely these
folks would want to know the reason for a perplexing haunting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I wrote again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My messages simply went off into the void of non-existence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile many more poorly-spelled,
grammatically obscene stories appeared on the website.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Very strange.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I can only assume that this web-site is not all that it appears to
be...claims of being authentic but no responses to supporters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps I have been writing to ghosts!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hereby testify that this story is
completely true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do with it what you
will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am sure it will go where my
other messages went...nowhere.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>True Ghost Story</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: valdean@email.arizona.edu</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I am now twenty years old and a university student, and have
always THOUGHT I've experienced paranormal activity at my parents' home in
Tucson, Arizona, but this past year was my first solid experience.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>When I was about seven years old, my family and I moved into
house that wasn't very old (probably built around the 1950s) but it definitely
had a creepy feeling to it. An old couple lived in the house before us, and I
remember visiting the house when we were thinking of buying it, and looking at
the room that was to become my bedroom. It looked as if it hadn't been touched
for years, and there was a single picture frame in the room containing a photo
of a young soldier. The room seemed to be a shrine, a tribute to him. The old
couple told us that was their son, and he died in battle.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Growing up in that bedroom, I'd always had weird sensations
and an overall creepy feeling, as if someone was always watching me. One night,
I awoke at about 3am to my usually very calm dog barking her head off at something
in the corner of my room. I immediately flicked on the lights, and she
continued to bark, her eyes locked on something that just wasn't there. I got a
very eerie feeling and slept on my parents' floor for the rest of that summer.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Other kinds of activity persisted in the house, but nothing
significant. This past year my great grandmother died of old age, and my mother
was her caretaker. Just a couple of weeks ago my mother was up late and was in
our family den watching TV. My brother and I no longer live at the house, and
my father was asleep in my parents' bedroom. My mother, who has no belief in
the paranormal, claims she heard my great grandmother yell her name. My mother
looked around and saw no one. She was terrified and ran to my father.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Last March I had my first sighting of a ghost. I traveled to
Belfast, Northern Ireland with a small college church group (including my
boyfriend). My boyfriend's sister was living in Belfast at the time doing
mission work, so we decided to take a trip out there for a couple of weeks to
work with her. We stayed in a local hostel, which seemed to be quite old. I
stayed in a room with three other girls. It was an extremely small room with
two bunkbeds. I was sleeping in the bottom bunk of one of the bunkbeds. One night,
I slept facing the wall, and I woke up in the middle of the night and as I was
shifting away from the wall to get more comfortable, I saw the figure of a
young man (probably around twenty years old) standing at the foot of the bed.
He had blue jeans, a green and white striped shirt, and no visible head on his
shoulders. I was in complete shock, and immediately turned back toward the wall
in terror and put the blanket over my head. Eventually I fell back asleep.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The next day we visited my boyfriend's sister at her house
across town. She lived in a narrow three-story house with three other
roommates. I told her about the ghost I saw and she was not surprised at all.
She told me that they have a ghost in their house as well, named Blaine
apparently. She said that her and her roommates had been hearing unexplained
noises including footsteps, but always ignored it. But one night, one of the
roommates brought a friend over who had experience with ghosts (apparently this
person spent his leisure time talking to ghosts in a Belfast cemetery). This
person, immediately upon walking into the house and having not been told about
the unexplained noises in the house, said to the roommates, "You guys know
you have a ghost living here right?" One of them said, "We figured,
but we just ignore it." After wandering the house a bit, the person told
them, "You don't have to call it an "it", it is a "he"
and his name is Blaine. He has a white beard and overalls, and he resides on
the second floor." This really freaked out my boyfriend's sister, but she
still tried to ignore it. However, one night, she was on the first floor in the
living room, waiting for her friend to pick her up to go to a pub.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>She was the only one left in the house because her other
roommates had already gone out for the evening. As she was waiting, she heard
footsteps slowly descending the staircase, which was out of her view. She knew
it had to be Blaine, so she immediately screamed, "NO, Blaine! Please
don't come down here!!! I'm about to leave, please just wait until I am
gone!!!" And immediately the footsteps stopped.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My boyfriend's sister is now back in Tucson and out of
Belfast, and none of us have had any paranormal experiences since Belfast.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>About twenty years ago, I had a very unusual
experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My parents were staying at
my house overnight so I gave them my bedroom and decided to sleep on the
pullout couch in my living room. My son, who was going to law school at the
time was studying in the kitchen which was adjacent to the living room with a
doorway set on an angle so that you could see only part of the living
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I watched television for a while
and then decided to go to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
sleeping on my stomach and just at that point between waking and being asleep
when the bed started to hum and buzz.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The noise got louder and louder and became deafening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I pushed myself off the bed as I felt like I
was getting a feeling of being shocked and at that moment I heard a very loud
crack followed by a puff of bluish gray smoke about the size of a child and
before I could do anything else it was followed by a second crack and another
gray shape - just a rough outline.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
the exact same moment my son and I ran toward each other as the shapes were
between us, they just disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
stood looking at each other in shock and then started running around the house
to make sure my parents and my daughter who was sleeping at the other end of
the house were okay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We checked the
basement and started feeling all the walls and we found nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We stayed awake the rest of the night and
told our family the following morning what had happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We all thought maybe it was something electrical
so we had an electrician check the house the next day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could find nothing to account for our
experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this day my son and I get
goose bumps when we discuss this and I have never had anyone else tell me of a
similar experience.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Once I was metal detecting in a field behind Beaverdam
Plantation main house. I was down digging something that I had detected and
someone asked me what was I doing? I told them I was trying to find the thing
that I detected with my metal detector. I got up to chat with them and there
was no one there. I looked all around and my friend was across the field. I
took my ear phones off and the only sounds I heard were garbled voices of years
past. This happened to me several times. This did not scare me off, I went back
to Beaverdam many times. </big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I want to share
something that happened to me when I was probably about 6-years-old. I grew up
in Lancaster, PA, which is where this took place. It was the very early 90's,
late spring or early summertime, around 11pm. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My dad and I had just gotten back from Hershey Park. When I
was this age I liked to play a game: pretend to be asleep, so dad will carry me
in. This is exactly what I was doing, only tonight my dad didn't come around to
get me- he left the car and went inside the house, figuring I'd wake up later
on my own. I was kind of mad, so I just sat there in the passenger seat pouting
for a few minutes. This is when I noticed something at the edge of the driveway
by the shrubs and the small trees that lined the beginning of the steep, wooded
hill that was our backyard. It was to the left, by the side of the house and
our back porch. What I saw was a slightly bright, glowing lime-green light that
reminds me now of sawmp-like, thick radiation gas (does that make sense?). It's
height was approx. three feet; width about one foot. I remember feeling very
confused, rubbing my eyes, knowing that there was no way this could be part of
the shrubbery. It didn't do anything spectacular- but I just sat there very
still, staring at it, and it began to look as if it was moving very slowly
closer to the edge of the driveway. I started to get scared, and forced myself
to get out of the car and run the few yards to my front door. When I got
inside, I told my dad what I saw. He went outside to check things out, but when
he came back in he said he hadn't seen anything. I might've been able to let
this memory become forgotten, if it hadn't been for what I saw the following
day. The next afternoon, I went to the spot where I had seen the light, and on
the ground was a small circle of dead or burned grass, I couldn't tell which. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>This experience may not seem very exciting or interesting,
but it is a memory that has haunted me for quite some time. I'm 24 now, but
this still bothers me. I'm wondering if there is anyone out there who may have
heard of something like this happening before. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I also have a few more (interesting) stories that have
happened to my mother and aunt, an ex-boyfriend, and my uber-skeptic fiance,
which I would love to share later!</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I lived<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in
Porterville</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>there is the ghost of a woman there</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>my friend saw her on the stairs, she said she was wearing a
floor length skirt and blouse, she was almost transparent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have seen shadows on our walls, lights
flashing in our bedroom and outside in the hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have seen flashes rush by me while at my
computer, out of the corner of my eye.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On mutiple occassions there has been strong smell of a females perfume
with no adverse affects to me (I am allergic to perfume) in my dining room area
where my computer is located.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where my
computer is located is off the living room (front door there) and a patio door
is off of the dining area that leads to a back yard with no access for others
to get to (the gate is locked and the only access is a narrow side alley way).</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Also there are many stories of the hospital (sierra view)
being haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I worked there for 5
years and have heard many stories.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
know that the old OB is suppose to be haunted with a baby crying, the old
surgical area on the first floor (there is storage and offices there I think
now) is suppose to be haunted by a woman who goes into rooms and if you follow,
there is no one in there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have heard
half a dozen stories or more but cant really remember them clearly.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Westminster, Carrol County, Maryland. Off of Rte 140,
Mayberry Road. I was heading east in my car, with a friend, just before dusk.
We were just fooling around, wasting time, and were always curious what was
down that way. Just before we got into the "village" (basically just
an old run down strip of homes on either side of the road), we came up on a
young girl. We both saw her, but not until she was at my driver side window,
pretty much just standing in the middle of the road. I thought i almost ran
someone over! It took us a second but we realized that something wasn't
"right" about her. She seemed to be wearing clothes from an older
time period, and just stared straight ahead as if my car hadn't just flew by
her face at 40 mph.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everything about her
was a greyed out color, Not "misty" or "transparent" just
grey. I looked in my rearview mirror, she took a step from where she was and
was completely gone. I have been pretty sensative to these things since i was a
child and the girl with me saw the exact same thing. I would love to find out
more about her. </big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>i dont know if i am psychic or something, but this is my
story.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>i am 13, and we live on a ranch... a long time ago, my
brothers were in their room, and my brothers lab started barking at the corner
of the room.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>well, now, that is my room, and i feel a presence in that
same corner. it is a protective grandmotherly feeling.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>one night, i was in my bed, and i heard two
guys talking.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>i muted my tv, and i still heard them talking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i walked out to the hallway, and the talking
stopped. i checked all the tvs, but none were on.....and as soon as i got back
in bed, i heard the talking again.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>my grandpa was italian, and he LOVED to cook......and i feel
his presence, and i KNOW he is in our kitchen. i am a singer, and my grandpa
was too. when i sing, for some reason, i am drawn to face the kitchen when i
practice. and i actually SEE his face! :/<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>but it doesnt freak me out
because i loved my grandfather. and sometimes, we will hear pots and pans
clinking, and the compactor will start up for no reason.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>i had a poodle, who was deaf and followed me everywhere. i
had her for nine years, and we had to put her to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>my aunt bought me a new poodle, but i can
feel my Tori (my old poodle)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>still
following<span style="">&nbsp; </span>me. and every one in a while,
Dolly (my new poodle)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>will bark or growl
at something behind for no reason. then she will follow it with her eyes..</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>and also, my great grandma is in my mom and dads room
protecting them above their bed.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>i know this because i feel it. my brother and me are the
only ones in our family that can.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>oh
yeah, and the grandmotherly feeling in my room, is some old lady that is
protecting me, but is SERIOUSLY FREAKING ME OUT because i can see her out of
the corner of my eye.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My Experiences with Ghosts</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: KimFematt911@msn.com </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I grew up in a small town in Minnesota. The house I lived in
was an old farmhouse which was moved into town. There was always odd things
going on which couldn't be explained. If you happened to be in the house by
yourself that's when you would hear things. One time while I was downstairs in
the basement (that's where my bedroom was) by myself I heard the front door
open and footsteps walk across the living room into the kitchen where the door
to the basement is located. I thought it might be a relative visiting so I went
upstairs and there was no one there. I looked around and then went back downstairs.
After a little time I heard the footsteps walk back across the living room and
the front door open and close. One time when my family and I were upstairs
watching tv we heard a crash from down in the basement. My mom canned a lot of
stuff at that time and it was stored on shelves downstairs so we thought one of
the shelves had given way. We looked everywhere downstairs and nothing was out
of place. Another night while watching tv we had dishes drying on the counter
in the kitchen. All of a sudden the silverware literally flew off the counter
across the kitchen. We all were in the same room so no one "living"
could have done it. There also was the feeling that you were being watched by
something every time you were alone. It tended to freak us kids out so my dad
started calling whatever it was "George" so that when things happened
we could just say "Oh, that's just George". </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My mother also told me about her great-grandmother's house
also being haunted. She told me that at night when everyone went upstairs to go
to bed that's when things would happen. There would be the sound of furniture
being moved around and someone scrubbing the floor. If you went downstairs,
sure enough, the furniture would be moved to a different spot. Also the sliding
glass door would open and close by itself. After I was born she and my dad went
for a visit. I was asleep in a crib in their bedroom and my mom woke up after
hearing a noise. She looked over at the crib and saw the side of the crib go
down and the mattress move like someone was bending over taking a look at me.
After a little time the side of the crib then went back up and the rocking
chair by the crib started to rock. She told me it was my Aunt Diana who had
died before I was born coming in to take a look at her niece.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My Mom is a skeptic to beat all skeptics, however the story
she came back from vacation with still makes the hair stand up on my neck.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My Mom, Grandfather, youngest sister Barbara and Barbara's friend
Karl went to Gatlinburg, TN for a week.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This has always been one of our favorite places to go as a family, and
we always stayed at the same hotel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
year the hotel did not have our usual rooms available, so they took rooms in
the new part of the hotel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is further
from the older section of the hotel, and up more in the woods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had been there a couple of nights, and
everyone was already sleeping, except Mom who had just showered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Granddaddy and Karl had one room, and Mom and
Barbara shared a connecting room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mom
laid down and turned off the light. Within a few minutes, she felt the bed go
down as if someone had pushed down on it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She called "Daddy" thinking he might be in trouble or wanted
something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No answer, so she assumed
Karl was messing around, trying to scare them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She rolled over and there at the foot of the bed was a small, very pale,
person with long white hair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The eyes
were like shark's eyes, and they were just staring at her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Childlike, but not a child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She put the covers over her head, and tried
to wake Barbara, to no avail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
about a minute, she peeked, and the specter was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She turned on the light, and you could see
where something had been sitting on the bed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My Mom was terrified because she saw it with her own eyes, didn't
believe in ghosts, and felt that it was not a 'friendly' visitor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rest of the week was uneventful, but we
have not been back for vacation.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>When I was 15-30 I lived in a house that was built just
before the Civil war, I never told anyone about this because I thought they
might think I was crazy till my sister said she had the same experiance. Late
at night after you would goto sleep I would wake up to my shoulders being shoved
deep into the bed and very heavy breathing in my ear, I had to almost fight to
sit up. This was in the old Rogers home place in Loganville Georgia located on
Hwy 78. One my Senior class ring disapeered for several years I thought a old
girlfriend stole it, it appered on a tv<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>probally 5 years later AFTER I flipped the house upside down.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: maddogx40@hotmail.com</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I am an Air Force Security Forces Member (Military
Policeman) assigned to Ellington Air Force Base in Houston, Texas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have been stationed all over the world, and
have come to expect that any base has its share of haunted areas, but just
yesterday, I finally experienced something that I could not explain.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I was doing a normal security check of one of the
maintenance hangars at around 11:00 am. I went into the building, which is
notorious for being a "creepy place" to the cops, being as they have
all heard or seen strange things inside.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I walked upstairs and noticed the door to the women's restroom was
open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought this was strange, since
I was the only one in the area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thinking
one of the workers left it open, I walked in to see if anyone was inside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>As I entered, I noticed a strong smell of what I can only
describe as human body odor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought
this was very peculiar, since this was a well maintained building, and, well,
women just don't usually let themselves or their areas smell like that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The more I walked in, the stronger the smell
became, to the point that I drew my weapon thinking a transient or drug addict
displaced from the recent hurricane may have broken into the building seeking
shelter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I cleared the entire restroom,
finding nothing out of the ordinary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
soon as I finished my walk, the smell suddenly went away and was replaced by
the usual smell of floor cleaner and scented air freshener that one would
expect in a military bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finding
this odd, I left the restroom and continued on my checks.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I entered the men's restroom and didn't see anything
strange.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While in the restroom, I head
the "call of nature" and decided to take a short break to take care
of business (hey, we cops are human, too!).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I finished I went to put my gear back on and suudenly heard the
sound of an older model dot matrix printer going off in the office next door.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Again, knowing I was the only one in the building, and also
knowing that we don't use those types of printers in the Air Force anymore, I
found this to be extremely weird.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went
into the adjacent office and was met with only silence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked around, but could not find a dot
matrix printer, or any other printing device for that matter. As I puzzled over
this, I suddenly heard a sound behind me that sounded like a "disapproving
sigh."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I spun around to face
whoever did it, but saw no one in the room but me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I then collected myself, headed for he door,
and left the building as fast as I could.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I went to the main gate of the base and discussed the
incident with a friend of mine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we
talked about it, a retired gentleman entered and asked for a base
registration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We asked him if he worked
on the base a long time ago and if he had ever heard of any strange stories
about the hangar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He smiled and said,
"You heard the printer, didn't you?"<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He chuckled and told us that there used to be a man that worked in that
office named Sgt. Reynolds, who died suddnly at work, and it is rumored that if
you are in the building alone, you can hear him up in his office, finishing up
hislast project we was working on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
gentleman also advised me not to go in there alone anymore, advice that I will
gladly take to heart.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: simon.skey@Teleperformance.co.uk</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Ive been a fan of the stories on your website for years and
always wondered whether I should place my own experiences on here, the first happened
when I was a young lad and isn&#8217;t a massive proof of a ghost story &#8211; though at
the time it was terrifying.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>When I was 11 (im now 27) I went on a school trip to Aston
hall in Birmingham England. During those days of the 1980s one of the things
they got you to do in those old house tours was write with quills, using proper
ink wells. This always led to a tremendous mess hands being covered in ink and
one lad who wiped it on his face by accident. Anyway myself and this lad
decided to try and wash our hands in the toilet to try and get this ink off
somehow. It was toward the end of the day and in January if I recall correctly
so it was already dark outside as we came out of the toilets after
unsuccessfully trying to wash the ink off. As we came out into the main hall we
noticed our class had already left the building to board the bus. I remember
the room as cold but this being January standing in a high ceiling old house
and me being a skinny 11 year old boy that could easily be explained away. I
never saw it first it was my companion, I felt a hand grip my shoulder and spin
me around. My companion was pointing his hand shaking. I followed his finger,
there was a staircase of some description and bobbing its way down was a pale
light like shape neither something like yellow/green in colour. What it was I
don&#8217;t know but I do know that we weren&#8217;t alone in the room anymore. Both of us
turned and bolted out of the doorway out of the house and back to the bus were
the teacher was immediately concerned as both of us were pale and shaking. I
only saw it for a second or two and certainly not long enough to ascertain a
positive identity. It may have been a light from upstairs (but that doesn&#8217;t
account for it moving) it may have been a torch but I couldn&#8217;t see a wielder of
it. Whatever it was scared me half to death at the time. That was enough.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My second experience and the one that made me decide to tell
you guys happened only a few weeks ago and was much more intense. I moved into
a new flat about four months and moved in with my dog which naturally enough
requires walking. I walk the dog early morning when its still dark as theres
not many people around and my dog is a big soft hearted coward. I take her out
the house to a large well lit park where she can run round and I can play
hurling. To get to this park I cut through a trail path that is lined either
side with trees. I have taken this route many a time. Im quite sensitive to the
supernatural not good enough to know who or what but definitely enough to know
when something&#8217;s there picking up a presence or feelings etc. I&#8217;ve always felt
this energy walking down this trail an oppressive feeling almost of being
smothered I have felt it on two separate occasions taking the dog out enough to
make me grip my hurl tighter and walk faster but nothing overly serious.
However I haven&#8217;t seen anything though I have felt the presence of some form of
entity. It was different though on a Thursday morning two weeks ago. As we had
just passed the entrance to the trail the dog stopped dead. Just stopped and
was staring down the mud path at nothing. She lowered her front half as if she
was about to pounce and growled actually growled, she has never growled before
barked yes but not growled. I looked down the walkway but couldn&#8217;t see anything.
But the feeling of oppression was back upon and it was stronger than the
previous times &#8211; much stronger. And I knew there was something there and I
could feel that it was coming closer towards me there was something in this
trail with me and it wasn&#8217;t pleasant I could feel it. But irish heads are
stubborn and I raised the hurley in my hand like a weapon and began to back
away whether this was the right thing to do I don&#8217;t know. My dog who has
cowered from cats before now didn&#8217;t want to go I had to pull her back forcibly
by the collar as she barked down the road. I muttered a blessing/prayer to
myself as I backed out onto the pavement proper. Once I was away from the trail
the feelings of oppressive rage subsided quite rapidly. None the less the dog didn&#8217;t
get her walk that morning and I havent been back down that trail since. I don&#8217;t
know what was in there with me, whether an elemental, or psychic residue or
ghost or whatever, I don&#8217;t know whether it was evil or whether it was just
angry at that particular point. I don&#8217;t know whether it would have hurt me or
not. I do know that ive never felt so scared in my life and I haven&#8217;t been back
down there since with or without the dog</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I lived in a farm house on 10 acres. Old man Cook built the
place and lived there until his death. He was also a drinker. We moved in the
place in 1980. Strange things happened from the time we moved in until the time
we moved out in 1986. Late at night things would move around in the garage like
someone was working on a car out there. Then you would see shadows of men pass
by the front windows, then the door knob would twist back and forth like
someone was trying to come in, but the storm door would be closed. You would
see shadows pass down the hall way during the day. The day we moved was a cold
March day I started a fire in the fireplace to keep my small children warm
while we packed the car. They started yelling at me telling me the puppies were
burning up. I came in and heard like a new litter of puppies whining. I told
them that was not possible as there was no way a dog could have her puppies
there. It emptied out into the garage. We heard cats meowing in the attic. I
would go and check and no cats would be there. This place was unsettling to say
the least. My daughters have been back out there in 2003 late at night they
said, there was a man standing in the door way. This place had been vacant and
partially gutted. Since then the place has been totally demolished. </big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>In the summer of 2007, I was visiting my boyfriend Angelo,
in Adelaide. We'd gone to Port Elliott one day and decided to book a room and
stay overnight at the Royal Family Hotel. The building was definitely old and
we opted for the basics with no ensuite bathroom. It was comfortable and
charming with a great band playing that night and we had an excellent time.
What was weird was that when we'd checked in that afternoon, we were given our
key and after putting our things away in the room, I told Angelo I was going to
pay a visit to restroom. Angelo waited outside on the second floor balcony
while I went off to the ladies room. I still had the room key with me and I'd
left my bag in the room so when I stepped into the bathroom stall I made it a
point to try to hang the key up on the peg on the inside of the stall door. The
ring was too small to hang on the peg so I carefully positioned in with the
oversized plastic tag on one side and the key on the other. It was a bit of
chore actually to balance it just right without it falling but I finally got it
to stay. I did what I had to do and collected myself and reached for the key
and it was gone! I knew for sure with no room for doubt that I'd put that key
there and I would have heard it if had fallen and hit the ceramic floor tiles.
No one could miss that! I was the only person in there as a woman had left the
stall next to me and washed up and left. I'd heard the key rattling but I
assumed it was her keys. I looked all over that bathroom, even going as far as
glancing into the toilet. They were way too big to get flushed down and I
thought I was losing my mind. Of course, I dreaded telling Angelo that I'd had
the keys 10 whole minutes and lost them, not to mention having to ask for another
room key from hotel management. I told the manager maybe someone had mixed them
up with their keys and took them cause I really thought he'd think I was
crackers! Angelo was amazed I could lose them so fast as I thought I'd surely
hear his thoughts on that and I did, rest assured, lol. Then it occurred to me
that being an old hotel, perhaps we had some playful ghosts. I'm an intuitive
empath so when I heard my inner voice tell me I should check the bathroom
again, I decided to give it a try. I came out of there with the keys in my
hand! They were positioned in the very same place and the way that I'd put them
there! I mean they were in the EXACT position in that stall as I had placed
them in with such difficulty before. No one could have known they were like
that but me and no one could have taken them while I had been in that stall.
Angelo and I were both a little freaked about it to say the least. As we walked
downstairs to the pub, we passed an employee who was coming up. I stopped her
and asked "Do you have ghosts here by chance?" expecting to hear a
giggle and a polite "no" with a head-shake but to my surprise she
said "Yes, we do actually. A little girl and a little boy." I asked
if perhaps they like to play tricks on the guest and the answer was "yes".
So, if you decide to stay in this haunted hotel, watch your keys and if
something comes up missing, most likely the children will return it if you walk
away and come back, who knows with these playful little imps. Tina Anderson,

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>These are my paranormal/ghost sightings, I guess, that I've
had in my life.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>On October 31, 1975 (Halloween, of course), my father died
of a massive heart attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was just
five years old, and he was only 36.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
and my mother had been divorced for two years prior to this, and it was a messy
divorce.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't see him very often
after that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The night after his funeral,
I had gotten up sometime in the middle of the night to use the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I was sitting on the toilet nearly falling
asleep again, I noticed something walking past the bathroom door, towards my
mother's and my own bedroom, which I shared with three of my sisters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew without a doubt it was my father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He wasn't actually "walking", but
more like "floating", very slowly, and I can remember I had this
overwhelming feeling he was very, very sad.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Right after this, I froze - and started to have awake flashbacks of some
of the times my father had done nice things for me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like, once my brother built a snow fort with
tall walls, and put me and my little sister in it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We couldn't get out because it was too tall,
but our dad rescued us and afterwards gave us each two of those little packs of
SweetTart candies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another flashback was
when some of the neighbor boys took the grate off of a sewer and put me and my
little sister in, then replaced the grate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We screamed forever, but again our dad rescued us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never told my mom or any of my siblings
about this experience, fearing they'd never believe me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But about 20 years later, my older sister and
I went on a weekend trip together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we
were about to go to sleep in our hotel room, out of the blue she asked me if
I'd ever seen our father's ghost after he died.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I relayed my experience, and she told me hers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, it was right after the funeral, and
she'd stayed home from school because she was ill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said that when she woke up from a nap,
she saw my father standing in the doorway of our bedroom, just watching her,
with a very sad, sorrowful look on his face.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She said he remained for maybe five seconds, and then
"drifted" down the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After this, we asked each of our other siblings if they'd had similar
experiences, and our older brother and sister had very similar experiences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My younger sister was only three at the time,
and denied ever seeing anything and told us all we were nuts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But our experiences were all very similar and
all happened right after the funeral, so we have no doubt of what we saw and
felt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of us who'd seen him said we
felt this incredibly sad feeling eminating from him, and we believe that he was
feeling guilty for leaving my mother for another woman, had all but stopped
seeing us kids, and left our mother basically destitute.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>In 2000, my grandmother died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After my father died in 1975, my mother had
her hands full with five kids, she and my grandfather became almost like our
second parents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We spent many, many
weekends with them at their house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
special treat for us was when we'd go to "The Dime Store", as it was
called in the '70's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Candybars were all
$.10, and there were many other treasures to be had for just $.10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every time we went to their house, we would
beg our grandparents to take us to the dime store, and they always complied
with pockets full of dimes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Very soon
after my grandmother passed away, I began finding dimes EVERYWHERE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In my car, on the school bus I drove, on the
sidewalk, on the street, in my house, just EVERYWHERE, and only dimes, not
pennies, nickels, or quarters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, I
asked my siblings if they'd been finding dimes as well, and sure enough, we'd
all been finding dimes in either common or really strange places, like in our
shoes, or in a cookie jar, or in a candy dish.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All places where my grandmother used to hide dimes for us to find.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My grandmother had wanted me to have her
prized mink coat after she passed away, and it hung in a cold closet for a long
time before I took it out one day and tried it on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In each pocket, there was a dime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My two children are also benefactors of
dimes, as that is by far the coin they seem to find most often, either in the
house or when we're out somewhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
all believe that Grandma has been tossing these dimes down from heaven, just as
a way to let us know she's still around, and we cherish every one we find.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Haunted Dog Kennels - Basrah, Iraq</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: JUNE12KALAYAAN@aol.com</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I worked in Basrah, Iraq from 2006 thru 2007 as a K9 Handler
on a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers program, located in a small camp that was
near the Basrah International Airport.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The camp itself was a fairly desolate place, surrounded by
tall concrete blast walls on all sides with look-out towers on each corner and
was located in a low-lying salt marsh area.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The bottom half of the camp would flood during the winter months, and
our "backyard" was littered with the wreckage of numerous armored
personnel carriers and tanks that were destroyed presumably back during the
first Gulf War.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The only permanent structure there was a bullet-riddled
concrete building that was being used as a maintenance shop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had apparently been the headquarters of an
Iraqi General during the war, was bombed, and then rebuilt and used by U.S.
forces for awhile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our dog kennels were
located in a secluded area behind this building.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The kennels themselves were made from an office trailer
(like you'd see at a construction site) that had one main doorway, with one
large room on the right, another one to the left, and a non-working bathroom in
the middle that we used as a storage area.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Each side of the trailer had four kennels that were made from metal bed
frames and long lengths of 1" square tubing welded together - making it
look something like a jailhouse from an old Western movie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The place was absolutely filthy when we moved in - a South
African company had originally been there, and had lost their contract after a
series of bad incidents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first being
that one of their dogs that was brought in from a different location had been
literally torn apart by the others there that roamed freely inside the fenced
in yard area of the kennel, and the second had been that one of their K9
Handlers had left his dog unattended inside the back of their truck while he
ate lunch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dog overheated, went into
seizures, and died en route to the nearest Veterinarian located at a British
military base in the area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both dogs
were buried near one of the observation towers (Tower #2), and the ground there
bore a distinct impression where the grave was dug.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>All in all, the kennels pretty much gave me the creeps, and
it just was not a place that you wanted to be after dark (partially due to the
fact that we received rocket and mortar attacks frequently around dinner time,
and there were several diesel storage tanks uphill from the kennels - and no
cover to be found anywhere!)</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Not long after we moved in, a strange series of events
began.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I kept my yellow Labrador
Retriever (an Explosives Detection Dog) in the right half of the trailer, and my
German Shepard (a Dual Purpose Explosives Detection / Patrol Dog) in the left
half, and the other K9 Handler vice versa with his two dogs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One morning as I was unlocking the front door
of the trailer, I saw through the opaque safety glass on the door a yellow
"blur" streak by.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inside
of the trailer was complete pandemonium -<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>one kennel door had been completely torn off of the wall and was still
latched to the door on the Yellow Lab's kennel, which was now completely wide
open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Water bottles and dog food were
scattered everywhere, and there wasn't enough time to clean up all the
mess.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We loaded all four dogs into our
Toyota Four Runner, and headed to the Front Gate to start our shift.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later on that day I got everything cleaned
up, and secured the Yellow Lab inside his kennel using a heavy chain and a
combination lock to keep his door shut.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>What I saw the next morning floored me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I "felt" something racing around
inside the trailer as I unlocked it, and opened to the door to see nearly an
identical scene as the day before!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
time the chain and the opened combination lock were laying on the floor, and
the Yellow Lab was free and running around all over the place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other dogs had gone crazy and their water
dishes and food bowls were scattered everywhere, and the place was in a
shambles.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Once again we loaded all four dogs up, and saved the mess
for later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I had time to return
later, I cleaned everything up and tried for a good 10 minutes to get the
combination lock to open by yanking on it and pulling on it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No luck - the lock worked as it should, and
remained locked no matter how hard I tried to force it open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I put the Yellow Lab away for the
afternoon, I checked and re-checked the chain and combination lock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was secure as could be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I spun the dial and checked again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everything was locked tight and I even said
out loud, "OK, Wiseguy... now try it!"</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Returning that evening, it had happened again - the Yellow
Lab was free and running around, and the lock and chain were laying on the
floor!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I simply couldn't believe my
eyes... </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>We had brought the locks with us from the U.S. and the other
K9 Handler was the only other person that knew the combination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had the truck that afternoon, so for him to
get into the trailer required him to leave his post at the Front Gate, walk a
few kilometers to the kennel, somehow unlock the outer fence door (I had the
only key with me) then walk across the yard, unlock the combination lock on the
outer door of the trailer, remove the chain, and then unlock the Yellow Lab's
kennel and set him free.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of it made
sense - the dog sure as heck didn't memorize the combination, and the other guy
had been too busy all morning to play any practical jokes...</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>We ended up swapping dogs around, and nothing ever happened
again - until we hired an Air Force K9 Handler to fill in so we could take
vacation time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One evening he went into
the trailer while I just outside the door, and he came right back out and was
literally pale as a ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
shaking and muttered a few expletives and finally told me what had just
happened... He said as he stepped into the small closet (the old bathroom) to
get a bag of dog food, he turned and the fire extinguisher that had been under
the sink somehow had moved itself right into the middle of the narrow
doorway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Listening to his story, I
absolutely believed that he was telling the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He knew nothing about the problems we had
with my dog getting loose under mysterious circumstances - and he sure as heck
would never would go into that closet again while he was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>After 16 long months, we were finally going home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On one of the last days there I was standing
in the doorway of the trailer talking to the other K9 Handler out in the
yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had just fed my two dogs, and
turned to see how they were doing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a
second I had no idea what I was looking at!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The door to the left half of the trailer was completely closed right
next to me - there was no sound, no motion, no nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Up until that instant I didn't even know the
door still worked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had been open just
a second or two ago as I walked through it and now it was unexplainably closed
for no reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The windows in the
trailer were stuck shut - there was no breeze inside, and try as I might I
couldn't get the door to shut on it's own again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was just another one of those "weird
things" that seemed to happen here periodically, and I could never shake
the feeling that someone or something supernatural was responsible for all the
mischievous events that we experienced there...</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>We had only lived there 2 months when I saw the first of two
ghosts. I was taking a nap in the back bedroom when I was awakened by
something, There was an old lady with white hair in a bun and she was wearing
an apron. She was standing in the door way, just staring at me. I gasp, too
scared to speak. She then just vanished. Another time about 10 years later
after the death of my husband I saw her again. Something woke me and there was
the same little old woman. I wasn't afraid of her but I was scared speechless
whe I was awakened by a man standing at the side of my bed he just looked at me
with a puzzled look on his face. He was wearing a green bomber jacket and a hat
, he was very tall and actually very hansome. When I tried to scream but
couldn't he just faded away still with the same look on his face. Well I always
felt as though someone was watching me. There was other people that saw people
including my grandson. Behind our home there is a family cementary and I later
sold the house and now the present owners see and hear voices and also say that
at night their bed shakes. This is a true ghost story. </big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I was a student at WIU from Jan 1974 thru Nov 1976 and was a
resident of Tanner Hall. The incident that was spoken of happened in Dec of
1973 and everyone in Tanner Hall was aware of it, since it had been so recent
at that time. The student was in a water fight/horseplay and hit the elevator
doors, which due to the impact and safety design, opened. It happened on the
top floor of Tanner hall and he fell all the way down the elevator shaft to his
death. There was a very eerie feeling all the time while in those particular
elevators, we witnessed a young man go into the bathroom on a women's floor and
disappear into thin air. Also a friend of mine and I were waiting on the ground
floor for a pizza delivery in Tanner Hall, and were chased upstairs to the 6th
floor by the same young man we saw go into the ladies room and he then vanished
again when we got to the 6th floor where we lived.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My friends and I just tried this one tonight, I just got
home a few minutes ago from the trip. We stopped on the train tracks and spread
a small bottle of baby powder all over the back bumper and trunk of the car. We
had to try it 5 or 6 times because of cars going by and each time we got out we
checked. There were a few interesting things about the night that we found.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>After the first drive by, one of us actually made a mark on
the bumper with just his fingertips to see how to powder would hold up while we
were driving, a few passes later, we blew it off so there wouldn't be any
confusion, its probably just a coincidence, but we found marks of full fingers
beneath it upon blowing it off. That was our second to last pass (note that we
checked after each individual pass, making sure that no one made any additional
marks before we got back in the car) on the way back to the tracks, we saw a
parked SUV along them, as we pulled up it drove off but reversed when we
stopped. Two guys in their mid twenties talked to us about it and said they had
visited a graveyard whos name I can't remember and they had actually found some
cool stuff. We gave them the tip about the baby powder and said we'd found
nothing here as of yet. Upon that, they said that we should turn the car off
but leave it in neutral instead of just stop, we did while we talked for
another minute. After that, a car was coming up behind them so they drove off
to do another lap and we decided to leave.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>We stopped again a couple hundred feet down the road to dust
off the baby powder because we didn't want to look sketchy with it while
driving driving back and found a set of small fingerprints about half the
length of an adult finger, they were very thin as well. To be safe we compared
finger sizes incase someone had made a mark but none of them matched (there
were 5 of us, all 17 year olds and only one even came close but his fingers
were still to thick) We took a couple pictures before brushing the powder off.
Another thing was, there weren't any distinguishable features about the prints,
on all of ours, we could see some trace of our actual finger prints, not just
where they had touched.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Note: The finger prints were definately very small, similar
to a childs no more than 10 or so years old, only one set was there, no
definate thumb mark present but it was hard to tell, this seemed to work best
with the car in neutral and turned off on the tracks. For us, it happened
facing toward Stearns Rd. If anyone seeks information, tell them that several
passes might be necessary and to bring enough powder to reapply if needed
because the driving can blow a good portion off. We only had a little bit so
there could have been more that we didn't see due to there not being enough
residue in some places. Theres also a wallgreens right by where it can be
purchased if need be.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>When I was a teenager I would have these dreams of my dad
dying on my birthday which this was very upseting cause our birthdates were the
same. I would dream every thing in great detail and it would be the same every
time and this would go on for weeks and then stop. My dad was my best friend
and when I had my last child she was born with special needs. So my dad told me
to stay at home with her and he would go back to work and see that I had what
we needed. Then in july of 05 he got sick and on sept. 4 he died not our bdate
but my anniversery. My mother asked me the other day if I remembered having
those dreams and wondered if it was somehow connected. My dad was a heavy
smoker and did not like the guy I married and when we have arguments I can
smell a strong cigarette smoke around me and my children.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My Ghost Stories</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: hollybear80@yahoo.com</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I have three ghost stories to share:</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>When I was 9 or 10 years old, my parents and two sisters and
I lived in an old house in a little town in northeastern Colorado.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I believe that it was built in the early
1900's and our landlord told us that an old lady had died in there, but I never
confirmed that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the main things
that happened was that our television would change channels and turn on and off
by itself; we took it in for repair and they told us that nothing was wrong
with it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night my sister and I were
sleeping in the room that we shared and our bedroom door swung open on it's own
- it had been firmly shut and latched that night since our parents had had some
friends over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one was there when the
door opened and it freaked us both out. A couple of times the water in the
bathtub turned itself on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The weirdest
thing that I remember was one day my sis and I had shut all the doors to the
kitchen and were bouncing a couple of rubber balls around to amuse
ourselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Out of the corner of my eye,
and dark, human-shaped shadow appeared in the corner of the kitchen and stood
there watching us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It disappeared and I
thought that I was crazy until my sis said, "did you just see
that?".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was glad to move out of
that house.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My second story is from many years later when I was in
college in Greeley, CO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I lived in a
big, old house with about 7 other people and I am convinced that whatever is in
that house is a really, really nasty and angry entity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a bedroom off the front porch, and I
would hear something bouncing a ball on the front porch when no one was out
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My best friend woke up one night
to see a grinning clown staring at her from across her bedroom and she was
absolutely terrified, she slept in the living room for a while after that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My other roommate was doing homework at the
kitchen table in the basement (the house had three levels to it) and she heard
children giggling from the end of the hall and saw a light bouncing around in
the hallway when she was the only one there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the basement, even when there were people around, you could feel a
nasty presence hanging out in the hallway by the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I talked to several people about this, and
people who didn't even live there brought it up to me at various points. Every
single person who lived there had at least one paranormal experience. I
absolutely hated that house and was really glad to move out and all of my
roommates felt the same way.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My last story comes from a tiny town in Iowa about an hour
east of the Iowa/Nebraska border.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
best friend and I went out to see her new twin nephews right after they were
born and her sister and BIL were living in an older farm house, probably built
in the 30's or 40's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The new mom and dad
were exhausted so my friend and I stayed up one of the nights caring for the
twins.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friend went outside to smoke a
cigarette, and after she went outside the kitchen/basement door started opening
and shutting by itself and the lights started going on and off in the kitchen.
I was in the living room and the twins were sleeping on the couch, and all of
the sudden I saw a dark male figure (wearing shorts and a t-shirt, no less,
that's how solid the apparition was) standing over the babies, watching
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hair on the back of my neck
stood up and I froze, I was absolutely terrified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day my friend and I got to talking
and she started telling me how she had felt a presence in the basement and had
heard something walking around in the attic.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She hadn't said anything to me the night before because she didn't want
to scare me, the same reason I hadn't said anything to her!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are pretty sure that the ghost was her
brother-in-law's deceased father - the apparition that I saw looked exactly
like the father's picture that was hanging in one of the bedrooms. Apparently
the dad and BIL hadn't gotten along when he was alive, so we think that he was
visiting to check out his new grandsons.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My Really True Ghost Story</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: janice143@verizon.net</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>When I was 25 years old, living and working in Washington,
D.C., in 1969, I was employed by a tax and estate attorney, Ira.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This attorney represented an elderly bachelor
by the name of Ryan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ryan owned a
Revolutionary War mansion called "Uplands" in Washington, D.C.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and owned an estate in Middleburg,
Virginia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>This story is convoluted, but I will try to put everything
in perspective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ryan died of a heart
attack in his estate in Middleburg, Virginia while I was working for his
lawyer, Ryan was only 63 years old.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Uplands had been rented out to an attorney who fell on hard times, he
abandoned the property and turned off all the utilities in the middle of one of
the most coldest winters in Washington, D.C. history.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Uplands was full of priceless antiques,
however, the pipes froze and burst, leaving ceilings caved in on the priceless
antiques, leaving a total mess.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
mansion sat unoccupied for a year, and that is where I came in.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Ryan left the mansion in trust to his only niece, Parke
Brady, the trust was tied up, and they could only afford sporadic security
police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Siegler said to me, why
don't you move in, you can occupy the mansion, they will do repairs to Uplands
so that it would be livable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did I
hesitate for a minute, not me!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Living
rent free in a three story mansion built right after the Revolutionary
War!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ryan was a very eccentric person,
they found chests of gold nuggets buried in the celler of his estate in
Virginia!</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>So, I moved in with a few of my friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the first day I was moving my things into
the house, on Halloween Day 1969, I walked into the front foyer, which was
covered with black and white squares of marble, with a beautiful crystal
chandelier hanging from the second floor landing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked up, and the chandelier started
swinging from right to left, for no absolute reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, what did I do, I went into the garage and
cried my eyes out until someone came home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I realized from day one that I had moved into a haunted house.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Come to find out, "Uplands" had been used as a
hospital during the Civil War.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
mansion itself was at the apex of Foxhall Road and Reservoir Road, one of the
most presigious addresses in Washington, D.C.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Foxhall Road, that was our address.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I wish I had pictures of Uplands, it was so beautiful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was your typical "colonial style
home, three stories, brick, with brick "covered patios" at each end
of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the top of these two
brick covered patios, were secret rooms.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first floor consisted of the three room kitchen, a dining room, and
a parlor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The entire width of the
original front of the house consisted of a library, with fireplaces at both
ends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the second floor, there were
four bedrooms, each with a fire place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All of these rooms were filled with priceless antiques.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The original front of the house faced down to Reservoir
Road, there were remnants of an old carriage road beyond a brick fence, where I
suppose people of old drew their carriages up and walked up the brick stairway
to Uplands.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Yes, I know this is about ghosts, and we had plenty of
them!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The front of the house was the
"library"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the entire width of
the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two fireplaces at both ends,
the entire library was stocked with first edition books.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day, we had some friends over, one of
them said, "good God, the entire hair on my head has stood up!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was freezing, but not having A/C in the
house, it was very warm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>And that's when things got really bizarre.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the top floor of the mansion was the
servants quarters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was old
furniture stacked in the room over the bedroom of my friend Judy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She woke us up one night about midnight, she
said "there is someone walking around in the room over my
bedroom."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one, but no one could
have walked around that servants quarters room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>On the second floor landing was a secret door, in the
paneling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If one had climbed the stairs
to the second floor, they would not have noticed that secret door, but we had
found it when we first moved into Uplands.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The secret door in the landing led up to the servants quarters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, here we were four scared young women
climbing those stairs, armed with a fireplace poker and little else.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>LOL<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nothing was up there, no one sneaking around, no one walking in a room
that was stacked to the ceiling with furniture.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>With regard to my most bizarre occurrence when I was living
there. The neice who inherited the mansion was staying with us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had my key, I had expected her to get
home from work before I did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
locked out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started knocking on the
front door hoping that she was there, I kept calling out her name, hoping that
she was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What did I hear
back?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some spectral voice calling out to
me "yes, I am here."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I kept
saying to her -- her name was Parke Brady -- "Parke" let me in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"yes, I am here."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This voice was so faint, I could hardly hear
it.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I jimmied open the kitchen window in the front of the house
and climbed in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no one in the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I fixed myself a vodka tonic, and
went into the library to just calm down.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Just then, I heard loud footsteps on the front walk, pause at the front
door and walk in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I jumped up, went into
the foyer, and no one was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of
course, the front door was locked because it could only be opened by a key in
the front of the door and at the back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Yes, Uplands was haunted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I know that for sure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How could
it not be with its history.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A Civil War
hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>After the episode with the footsteps, I called the
police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Georgetown police department
sent these adorable cops who just thought we were being harrassed by the German
Embassy who was right next door to us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They patrolled our home every four hours, and we had no more
"ghostly episodes."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did the
German Embassy just try to scare us out?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I think not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They wanted to buy Uplands,
but I do know that our home was haunted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>And what happened to Uplands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Germans bought the house, and demolished
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The antiques were sold and many of
them were donated to the State Department.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I remember one day around 1975, I was working in Georgetown, and I
decided to walk up to the intersection of Foxhall Road and Reservoir Road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There in front of me, was an empty lot, just
leveled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No more beautiful library, no
more 16th century teak door surrounds, no more crystal chandelier, no more
eight fireplaces, no more walk in safe in the kitchen, no more "servant
bells" in the kitchen, where, when we lived there, you could still see the
servants bells when Averill and his wife lived there in the 1940s.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>As an aside, I have to tell you about one of my room mates
who lived in the mansion, Teena.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
came from a very wealthy family in Washington, D.C.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was a good friend of Parke, that is how
she got to move into Uplands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In June of
1970, she had her engagement party in Uplands, her grandmother, Ethel, paid for
the party, had sent over her butler to greet people at the front door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ethel, who was dripping with old diamonds,
and was holding court in the dining room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was regaling me about the times she had been to dinner in the
1940s.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was just so happy to be talking
to Teena's grandmother in that fabulous home, I said to Ethel Garrett, "oh
Mrs. Garrett, I am sure you are so unhappy to see what has happened to Uplands
since you were there almost 30 years ago, you should see the kitchen, it is in
terrible shape."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And Mrs. Garrett,
after pulling herself up to me so that I could see her diamonds said to me
"my dear, I've never been in a kitchen in my life nor will I will ever
be."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yikes.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Teena died when she was 35 years old of alcolism, her brother
Mac, who was a good friend of mind, overdosed on drugs at the age of 23.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ethel purchased a column at the Washington
Cathedral for $500,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ethel's ashes
are entombed at the Washington Cathedral.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>So, I survived a haunted mansion, and I survived a very
unusual family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>And thanks for listening to my story.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: km528035@gmail.com</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I'll start by giving you a history of the house. We were
fortunate enough to know the original owner personally. The house was built in
the 1920's as post-WW I housing in McGregor, TX and was basically a kitchen and
a living area. The owner had 2-3 husbands that were both stone masons and the
first encased the house with natural stone and added a bedroom and bath in the
1940's. The<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he passed and she remarried
to husband #2 who added a hallway, bedroom and porch which was later enclosed
to make a laundry/sun room in the 1950's. Then eventually building a house next
door they moved out and began renting the property. Husband 2 passed and she
didn't marry again. The renter before me was an elderly woman in her 90's she
lived alone and had fallen. It was 3 days before someone found her. She her
last few weeks of life in a nursing home. The my family and i moved in.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>We lived there from 2001-2005 and during that time we
experienced much paranormal activity. I never felt afraid but there was a
strange sense about the place. Mostly my wife, daughter and myself would see
shadow people, a few times we saw a white misty form but none of us saw any
thing at the same time. It would only be one person. I, almost daily at times,
would wake up to find all the kitchen cabinets open both top and bottom. We
went on like this for a couple of years. Then one evening all of us were in the
family room and the doors of a large, heavy amoire, where our TV was, opened
all the way. We sat there with our mouths gaping and trying to figure out how it
happened. All I know is all doors and windows were closed, the floor was level,
and the doors had magnets to keep them closed.</big></big></p>
