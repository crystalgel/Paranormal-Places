happened to me is at night I smelled food being cooked but no one is

passed away his old car was parked out side in the street in the middle of the

called to us on the phone and let us know the police were called. How ever in
the time that this took place the neighbor view a man coming out of the shadows
and chasing the criminal away.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No one

Then i saw this image in the middle of the road. It was a boy he looked about
15 or 16 yrs old. He was wearing a american flag shirt with jeans and converse
sneakers and he had like reddish brownish hair. It looked like he was going to
give me a letter. Then all of a sudden a truck came went right through him and

late October to early November of 1985 or 1986, and for years I have searched
the Web and reading materials of WWII for information regarding the USS
Alabama. I gave up for a while, but recently my interest was aroused again, and
there is more information available now on this ship.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>I toured the ship with my
first husband and two other couples. No one else was on the ship except the six
of us, and each couple choose a different route. I believe there were three
painted lines: red, yellow, and blue at the beginning of the tour and each
route ran through the entire ship but just not together. Each couple chose a
different route and we did not run into each other again because the ship was
so large. A few minutes into the tour, I had the feeling of not being alone,
that other people were watching us and I kept turning around looking for
someone but no one was ever there. This continued throughout the entire tour
until my husband started questioning me on why I kept turning around. When I
told him, he just scoffed at me. I never heard any voices or saw
anyone/anything, but I just had the uncanny feeling of an unseen presence and
some sadness. The only noises I remember was something being banged on metal
which I attributed to &quot;settling&quot; of the ship. At the very end of the
tour just before we were to get off the ship, we saw a sleeping compartment for
some sort of lieutenant. I entered the compartment and sat on the bunk for just
a second or two. As I was coming out of this compartment, something snatched a
diamond earring out of my ear. Not much pain, but definitely a force and not
just the earring falling out on its own. I was upset because I thought even if
I was able to find the earring, I would have to go to a jewelry store to get
another back for it because I knew I would never be able to find the tiny
little back to it. When we found the earring, it was in a corner 10-12 feet
from where I had been standing and the back was still on it. I took this to
mean that there definitely had been someone/something else on that tour with us
and because my husband kept scoffing at me, this was the &quot;other
person's&quot; way of letting me know I had not been wrong.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

my imagination or maybe there could have been pictures of some of the officers
on the ship at the time I was there, I don't remember, but for years I have
carried the image of a tall, thin faced, blond officer in my mind. No name;
just his face. A few weeks ago when I began my search again for information on
the ship, one Web site had pictures and biographies of some of the commanders;
one is the face I have seen in my mind for years. Unless there were pictures on
that ship back in '85 or '86, there is no other place I could have seen that
face. None of books on WWII I have searched through had this man in them.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

cabin (circa 1920's) that's where all the adults slept and all of us kids were
put in sleeping bags up in the loft. Not too much time after going to bed I
felt a heavy presence and looked around to see if any of my cousins were
feeling this, whatever it was. Alas, they were all sleeping soundly, except for
me. After awhile I became very afraid and a man's face appeared right above my
sleeping bag-glowing like it was daytime (it was well after </span></b><st1:time

informed him in no uncertain terms that I had no desire whatsoever to have
anything to do with him. At being told this he took a softer attitude for
awhile and his whole glowing body had materialized by that time. He picked up
my jump rope lying right beside me and started swinging it close by my face and
saying he wanted me to hang myself from the rafters so I could be there forever
to play with him and how sad he was that he had hung himself on the rafters in
that very cabin years earlier and what a big mistake he had made in doing that.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I tried to convince him that I didn't know
how to tie a knot with the rope but he offered that he would help me.All night
long I laid there frozen in my sleeping bag unable to move and periodically
Charles's face would turn grotesquely distorted. and burst into flames and then
a moment later he would begin swinging the jump rope over my face touching it
at times. I was petrified out of my little mind. As soon as I heard any of the
adults moving downstairs making breakfast in the morning, I went flying down
those steep steps as fast as I could and told my grandmother what had happened.
When my parents got up my father insisted I had made this all up and he took me
to see the widow lady who owned the cabins. After I told her what had happened
the color went completely went out of her face and I described her late husband
to a T including a big mole on the side of one cheek. She told my father that
her late husband had hung himself from the rafters that us kids were sleeping
under back in the late 1930's and she could never figure out why she had so
much trouble renting out this particular cabin. So rather than being
reprimanded for telling a big fib, my father informed me that if I ever saw
anything like this again to keep it to myself. I can still smell the rotten breath
of Charles if I close my eyes for a few seconds. It was the creepiest thing I
had happen to me as a small child. If a young child tells you something they've
felt, please believe them. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

me and my sister were laying in our beds just waiting for &quot;santa&quot; to
come and give us our presants. I was just lying there when i sort of drifted
off into a kind of half awake half asleep feeling (but i swear it was real!)
anyway, i was sleeping sort of only with my eyes wide open when i looked into a
small corner of the room when i see little figures dancing as if they were at
some sort of party or something, so i think to myself &quot;okay i'm freakin'
crazy!&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and so i just put it to the
side of my mind. Then I was still dreaming (normally)<span

that i was being spun around in the middle of the room repitively; I woke up so
scared so i went to get a glass of water. When i was pretty well up the full
set of stairs i saw my mother sitting at the table having a glass of somesort
so i continued, Then just as i go to turn the light on in the bathroom i feel
this INCREDIBLE force push right through me i swear to this day i can still
picture it in my mind i can see myself standing there<span

at all i stood there and all i could think about was ... My grandmother who
past away about 3 years ago. I'm not sure who or what it was but all i know is
that it obveously wanted to tell me something that was very importent, i'm not
really sure what it was that the spirit or whatever it was i encounterd wanted
me to know? but i still get scared of even thinking of the word&quot;Ghosts or
spirits&quot; but yet it pulls me toward the thrill of them. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>I remember when I was a little girl, my
grandparents owned a colonial farmhouse that had been standing for at least 150
years. My grandmother thought the house may have been used for the underground
railroad, because it had a few little doors and rooms off of some of the
closets in the bedrooms and in the basement. I wasnt allowed to go into them
because they didn't have electricity and my grandmother was afraid that I would
hurt myself. Members of my family said that I wouldn't want to go in them
anyway, because there were ghosts there. Of course I didn't believe them, I
thought they were just telling me this to scare me. (As any 7 year old would.)
But that was all going to change one night when I spent the night there one
night. I was staying in their guest room, which had one of those little rooms
off of the closet. The little room was probably for extra storage, or maybe a
staircase because the back was all boarded up. and late that night, I woke up
because I thought I was being watched. I looked up, and noticed that the closet
door was open and a small figure was standing there, glowing bluish. I screamed
and ran into my grandmother's room, and wouldn't go back into that room. I
never saw that figure again, but I did see another ghost of an elderly farmer
on the property. I was nine this time and playing in the barn. I was upstairs
in the hay loft, burrowing around in the hay. (Again, lik I wasn't supposed to
be.) Again, I had that same feeling of being watched. I sat up and looked
around and in the corner, an elderly farmer was standing, watching me. At first
I thought it was my grandfather, but then I realized that his feet weren't
touching the floor. As soon as I noticed this, I screamed and ran out of the
barn. There have been many sightings of him since then, including one of my
brother seeing him floating outside of a second story window.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

actually lets go and sleeps, there is a place in between and it lasts only a
second, but that's when this thing happens to me. I can only speak for myself,
I don't know of any one else who has experienced this, but I've heard

MIGHT I truly believe I will never wake up again. While this is happening I am
frozen and cannot move, yet I am aware of my room, I am aware of things around
me and what is happening, I can even hear my TV. I can scream in my mind, and
hear barely an &quot;uuhhh&quot; come out of my own mouth. It takes ALL my
might and effort to open my eyes, but once I get my eyes open I can focus on
things in my room like my dresser or door anything and come out of it, but it
SO STRONG I sometimes feel I might not be able to fight it and that is why I
believe I never will wake up. The whole time this is happening I am frozen to
my bed and cannot move. Please note, it's hard to explain, it doesn't feel as
if it is pulling my body, it is pulling ME, deeper into &quot;sleep&quot;. One
time it was pulling me so strongly that when I did get my eyes open, I actually
could see my room, but it was as if looking through water, or fog.<span

WAS ONLY ABOUT FIVE OR SIX FEET FROM MOM AND DAD WAS A LITTLE FARTHER STRAIGHT
ACROSS THE PATIO FROM HER. I WAS TALKING TO DAD AND LOOKING IN HIS DIRECTION
WHEN, ALL AT ONCE, I HEARD THE SOUND OF CLAWS ON WOOD AS IF SOMETHING WAS

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>Me and my friends all have
strange things that happen at our houses. Ever since we where young we have
felt presences of other people and all have seen other people walking around
mostly at night. Recently my good friends family lost their house and had to
move to a new one farthur away. We all went together to check out her house and
to see what we could find. It was kinda creepy there (no other houses around,
in the middle of the woods, burnt down barn in the yard, just plain creepy) But
the thing that stood out the most was the door to her basment. The door had
been painted blood red and was the only door in the house like it. We all stood
around it and could feel that something wasnt right about what was down there.
We all decided to go down and check it out anyways just to make sure that it
wasnt our imaginations. The stairs where old and almost rotten through and when
we got to the bottom there was 2 rooms. The one didnt give us a bad vibe and
was actually kinda cool. It had a fireplace and an old table and a door that
led right to the woods but when we went near the other we all stopped at the
same spot before the door. Something didnt feel right and we couldnt go any
further in. It was dark in that room becuase there was no light for it and no
windows in it. All of the cornors looked so much darker then the rest of the
room though. They where all pitch black. We felt a big gust of cold air come
out of the room and saw a pair of eyes in the furthest corner of the room. They
looked like a cats eyes when they are hit by the light but there was no cat in
the house. We went upstairs and told her family about it. Her mom understands
stuff like that and put a cross on the door hopeing to keep what was down there
out.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>Since we felt such a strong
feeling down there we all decided to look around more in the house to see if we
got the same feeling but nothing more came from inside the house. We went out
to the old barn and felt that same feeling again that something wasnt right.
Half of the barn was gone due to a fire that happend in it but we could still
get up in the loft just not to the back end of it. Something felt really wronge
up there so we left right away. After a while we did some research on the house
and found that it was built almost a hundred years ago. The third set of owners
that had that house had a child that freezed to death in the woods when she was
5. The fourth person that owned the house hung himself in the barn. The people
that owned the house before my friend moved in where the ones that had the fire
in the barn and the article said there was no major loses but they did lose
their pet dog in the fire. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>We have seen more
disturbing things from that house since we found out what happend but we have
started to learn how to ignore them. They dont bother us but they still show up
once in a while and just watch us. We know that they dont want to hurt us so we
learned to live with them. Still no one goes into the basment becuase there is
something bigger down there that we arent ready to face.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

recently had an encounter with what I think is the elderly Lady that lived here
before us. My Mom and Step Dad bought this house about 2 1/2 years ago. The
lady that lived here before us, died in my little sister's room. About a month
or two ago I was up reading in my bed, when I started hearing scary noises and
freaked out. I got up and went into the living room and the TV was on! It was
turned off when everyone went to sleep. So I went into my sister's room
thinking she did it and she was sound asleep. I was scared stiff by now. I
turned around and her TV started to turn on and off. So I ran back into my room
and tried to ignore the voices and noises. I still here noises and voices, but
that was the first.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

freaked out about the paranormal, but I continue to torture myself by reading
about it all. By the way your website is great, keep it running!) So I guess in
a way, I was here for this one, but not technically. My best friend Betty's
(not her real name) mom looks after a bunch of kids after school. I am not one
of them, so keep in mind that I am not there. On this day, only Betty, my other
friend Kady, and another girl I dont know real well Kriss (not their real
names), were at Betty's house. Betty's mom was out shopping and the rest of the
family was at work or still at school. Betty and the other girls were in
Betty's room when they heard a thumping noise coming from in the closet. No one
was home, and my friends arent exactly the bravest people on earth, so of
course it freaked them out. Betty immediately called me because the thumping
kept going on and I lived on the next street over. She was crying so hard, and
I could hear Kady and Kriss screaming and crying harder with evey thump (I
could hear all this over the phone, thats how loud it was). I always see people
do this on movies, so I told them to tell whatever it was to knock once for
&quot;no&quot; and knock twice for &quot;yes&quot; I heard them say that and
then told them to ask it something. My friends were all too scared but I told
them to do it if they wanted to know the truth. So I heard Betty ask, &quot;Is
something in there?&quot;. A loud KNOCK KNOCK came from the closet. All my
friends screamed and cried harder. I moved away from my closet because that was
where I was near in my room at the time. Then Betty asked, &quot;Can you tell
us your name?&quot;. KNOCK! AHHH! Went everyone in the room. Then I couldnt
hear my friend anyomore. I started freaking out. But it turned out that in all
the excitement, my friend dropped the phone and it turned off. She called back,
but they left the room. &gt;From her living room, they could still hear
thumping, but it stopped 5 minutes later when Betty's momcame home. They told
her all this, and I dont know if she believed them or not. Betty and her family
moved from the house about5 months later, there were also some more stories in that
house, but I'll tell them some other time. So in closing, you can believe what
you want about that story, but I know that I was hearing everyone scream and
cry worse than you see in the movies. I trust my friend and know she cant fake
a cry like that. Now I suggest you all get the farthest you can from your
closets tonight and have sweet dreams...<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

about a young boy who was playing on a set of swings (which the local council
took away in 1989) and he fell off the swings. The swing connected him on the
back of his skull, killing him. This happened around 1967. Now, it's 1986, I

unknown since I was little girl.The only one in my family that really
understood me with this obsession was my father's mother, my grandmother. She
was very spirtual and I loved her dearly. She has had several experiences with
the unknow in her life time and had always confided in me. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>Well to start off<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>here is a little back ground information my
grandmother passed away on November 29, 2001at the age of 57, the day after my
husband 21st birthday. She had complained for about a year that she didn't feel
well that her stomach hurt. I told her everytime i talked to her that she
needed to go see a doctor. She had went and they told her it was an ulcer.
Which wasn't true she bleed into her stomach for about a year, she had a small
rip in her aorta valve in her heart. She died while she was christmas shopping
This was definately a devistating blow. I thought i would never recover from
this loss. I had so much anger towards her for leaving me. I hadnt seen her in
almost a year and was planning to come and see her the 2nd week in december.(
my husband and I live about1800 miles from her) Eventually I did recover from
this and about october of 2002 I was talking with my grandfather on the
phone.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were talking about my Grandma.
He decided to tell me that about a week before she died she had told him and
his friend Kenny that she knew that she was going to die and thier would be 2
more deaths in the family before the new year.( this did come true her second
cousin and my grandpa's best friend passed away before January)<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I then<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>questioned my grandfather on this.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Why wouldn't she have told me? We talked about everything. Why not
me?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We spoke for about 10 minutes longer
and both hung up.I decided the best thing I could do was go and get some sleep.
For the first year after my grandmas death I would always feel so depressed after
my conversations with my grandpa.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>So with this still weighing
on my mind I went to sleep. It was a very deep sleep which is not really normal
for me. I normally toss and turn.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>During
this time I started dreaming that I was in a large room with my grandmother. I
was questioning her, Why hadnt you told me, She just kept apologizing for this
not really answering the question. The dream was pretty long and drawn out but
for some reason I can't remember what else was said. She then said&quot; I have
to go but before I do I have something to show you.&quot; She opened a door on
the side of the room. I was standing in the door way and suddenly she was gone
and I was on the side of a highway with my friend Kelly. We we on the side of
the road apparently having been in a car accident. Her car was parked beside us
not really having or showing any damage. I was crying and I had Kelly in my
arms. She was covered in blood, I was screaming and crying as she died in my
arms on the side of that highway. As suddenly as it started it stopped and I
woke up. I was still crying. This just felt so very real I was sad because of
the situation that happened toward the end of the dream but I felt satisfied
with seeing and talking to my grandmother. I didn't really know if I was crying
over the loss of my friend or because I was able to talk to my grandmother one
last time. It had to have been the weirdest &quot;dream&quot; I have ever had.I
sat up thinking about this for awhile i am not really sure what time it was,
but it felt like forever before I fell back to sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>Even after I woke up the
next morning to get ready for work this dream was so vivd that it lingered with
me. Normally i cant remember any dreams that I have, atleast not<span

door to my job the first person I saw was Kelly. I immediately told her my
dream. She just kinda looked at me with a weird look on her face. She said her
fiance had the same type of dream last night. That she died in a car accident
on the side of a highway. We all bacisally just joked about it, it was just to
much of a coincedence.It was friday and we just kinda forgot with the upcomming
weekend. We went on for about the next week. I had called my father and told
him about it he said well death means life. About a week before halloween kelly
had called out from work said she was terrible ill and could not come in. She
had went to the emergency room and they told her she was pregnant. It was a
total shock for her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All of us were in

went to a window and moved the curtain aside to look out to the back yard.<span

the trains, cheating and conning their fellow passengers. Kate traveled by the
name of Miss Lottie A. Bernard. Her husband Tom went by the name Dr. M.C.
Anderson. Usually Kate would attract a male passenger and tell him that if he
wanted to continue seeing her that he must gain the approval of her brother. Of
course, her brother was actually her husband Tom. This would eventually lead to
a game of cards. Tom would then swindle the man out of whatever he could. Kate
would then dump the suitor and the young man would leave with little or no
money, and no girl. Tom and Kate would then keep moving with the trains. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

meet her there for Thanksgiving. She checked into the hotel on November 24th
and told the employees that she was waiting for her brother. Tom never did
arrive, and Kate never left. Kate was very depressed and tried to induce an abortion
by taking a huge amount of quinine. She also made a trip to town and purchased
a gun and shells. Five days after checking into the hotel, she was found dead
of a single gunshot wound to the head. Her body lay on an outside staircase
leading to the beach. Blood was found on the gun and on her hand. It was
quickly ruled a suicide. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>In 1990, a book called
&quot;The Legend of Kate Morgan: The Search for the Ghost of the Hotel del
Coronado&quot; was written by Alan May . His book refutes the suicide claim and
gives compelling evidence that Kate was murdered by her husband. A maid that
may have befriended Kate is said to have also disappeared at that time. Some
suggest that she was also murdered but the body removed by the hotel staff and
the story hushed up so as not to arise anxiety with the hotels guests. Since
Kates death in 1892 there have been many instances of paranormal activity at
the hotel. One of the hot spots of activity is Kates room, number 302 which is
now 3312. The activity is not confined only to that particular room though.
Voices are heard when no one is there. Objects seem to move by themselves,
lights flicker, TVs turn themselves on and off. There are unexplained noises,
strange unexplained smells, sudden temperature changes, strong drafts even when
the windows are closed and even sightings of Kate herself. One of the better
known cases is of a secret service agent that was staying at the hotel
protecting the president. The agent was staying in Kate's old room. He
complained to the management that there was too much noise coming from the room
above him. The only problem is Kates room is on the top floor.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

dead in my tracks.We had not changed either lady in the room because they
did'nt need it however the entire floor was covered in diaper fluff(the inside
of disposible diapers fall apart when wet and become a wet confetti) Also, the
floor near the nurse desk also had a trail of diaper fluff.I yelled down to the
nurse and other aide to come see this.They both stared at each other in
disbelief!No one was in the hall and yet there was this mess-how did it get
there?<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;

desk and the whislte started again then the door across from the desk had it's
own haunting before our eyes! The door knob started to shake as if someone was
trying to get out of the room.I got up thinking that maybe the cat was rubbing
against<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the door or perhaps the confused
lady in that room could't open the door.Of course the cat wasn't there and both
ladies were sleeping soundly.I shut the door and did'nt even take two steps and
the door knob started to shake profusely again,I jumped from that doorway the
way Scooby and Shaggy react.Me and the other aide were literaly sitting on the
same chair because we were so freaked out. I got up and went to get a drink of
water.While satanding at the desk I felt the presence of someone standing
beside me,then reach over and put their arm around my shoulders.I ran screaming
from that unit to the other side.Of course everything was quiet over there.When
I finally came back all three of us were ready go home.This assult continued
till about 5 am when the house keepers, cook and othe aides stared coming in.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

years and have never heard that whistle at any time in all weather

intercoms went haywire screeching and then on that same unit the fluff was in
the hall.As for that door knob it never shook again the residents in that room
did'nt either hear it or slept through it.I still work third shift and once in
a while we hear voices or a book will fly off a shelf with no one around but we
have'nt expeienced the terror we did that night.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>When I was 6 my parents and
I moved into a 3 bedroom house. I was really excited about having my own room
since we had been living with my grandparents and their kids and I had never
had my own room. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>Anyway, my parents got my
room ready and the very first night that I was to sleep in there I was really
excited. As soon as I got into bed I got a really creepy feeling that someone
was in there with me so I went to my parents room and got into their bed. I
never told them. This continued for quite some time until I decided (with my
parents urging)to sleep in my own room. I always felt uneasy sleeping there but
I kinda just got used to it. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>In addition to that there
were two other rooms in the house that made me feel very uneasy. One was the
third bedroom. It was bigger than my room but it was always cold for some
inexplicable reason. I hated that room. I sometimes would go in there to play
but I always felt as if there was someone in there with me that didn't want me
there. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>The other room I didn't
like was the basement. Again, it seemed as if there was someone down there. If
I had to go down there to get something I would always run back up the stairs
feeling as if someone were chasing me away. Once I became an adult and told my
Mom this story she told me that she, too, had that same feeling. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>It wasn't long after we
moved there that I began to sleepwalk. My Dad woke one night and found me
trying to unbolt the front door to leave. On another occasion I went halfway
down the basement stairs and sat on the step. I hated that place, I couldn't
imagine wanting to go down there.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>Soon after that I lost a
tooth. I went to bed with the tooth under my pillow. I had decided that I would
stay awake and see the tooth fairy. I hadn't laid there very long (and I am
100% positive that I was still awake because I couldn't get to sleep for a long
time afterward) when I saw a black shadow come in under my door. After it came
through the slot under my door it grew as tall as the door. It came over to my
bed and opened the drawer next to my bed as if it were looking for something or
leaving something. After it closed the drawer it went back to the door, shrunk
down and disappeared under the slot. I wanted to look under my pillow but had a
strong feeling that I wasn't supposed to look until morning so I didn't. I
don't remember what was under my pillow. I did believe that it was the tooth
fairy until I got old enough to realize that there is no such thing. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;

this and she shared a couple of stories with me. One of which someone pushed

mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>Back in December of 1990,
my grandparents were still alive and I was 7 months pregnant for my son. My
Aunt had taken them on a month long vacation to visit family, and my husband
and I house sat for them. The very first night we were there a 1' x 2' framed picture
of a leopard FLEW about 5 feet off the window sill over the side board stereo
at me and broke. This was startling because there was NO draft (it was December
in </span></b><st1:State><st1:place><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>New

font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>,
everything was closed up), and no one was near it! That Picture had been in the
same spot for years. Strange noises started coming from the attic after that.
My husband and I were watching TV one night and a loud rumble was heard by both
of us. We muted the TV and it sounded like there were upwards of 50 people in
the attic partying! It seemed as if what ever was up there knew we heard them,
so it stopped, and we began hearing footsteps down the attic stairs which were
directly behind us on the other side of the wall. We were also watching my
aunt's dog, Kristy, who went nuts at this point. She was jumping and barking
towards the attic door, then the laughter happened, a little child's voice,
laughing, at the dog, as if they were playing with each other. The following
day we checked the attic and found an ash tray with a single cigarette butt in
it and an empty beer bottle. NO ONE had been up there in years! Not to mention,
no one ever smoked up there.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>It doesn't end here. The
back door off the kitchen had a string of bells on it. The latch was broken so
my grandparents installed a dead bolt on it to keep it shut. It was the door
into the garage, not outside (again, all closed up), keep that in mind as I
explain the rest. On a daily basis, sometimes more than once, this door would
open and slam shut 7 or 8 times in a row (we were always aware of it due to the
string of bells attached to the door). We had friends visiting at one point
when it occurred, and they stood next to me and watched the door swing shut,
LOCK, then open again, and again, and again! Our visitors also spent the night
(skittishly, but they had no choice, the drive was too far that late at night
for them), and at about 3am all of us woke up sweating buckets, only to find
that the thermostat had been turned up to 90*!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>About that time every night the dog, who slept on a blanket on the floor
next to our bed, would jump up start barking and chase something through the
house, occasionally you would hear the child laughing when this happened. Our
friends chose not to come back, by the way. At one point my husband shared with
me that he would be disturbed every night by cold air, that appeared to only be
hovering about a foot over his body in bed. He woke me up that night when it
happened to witness it. As soon as I stuck my hand in that area I felt the cold
swoosh down to his feet and off the end of the bed. All of these events
reminded me of a mischievous toddler...<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>Now this always baffled me
because there is no history. My Grandfather built this house himself, in a
residential area. No one else ever lived there. And my grandparents said they
had never experienced any thing like this in the 40 plus years they lived
there. I often wondered if the ghost child had adopted them as it's parents and
was upset that they were gone. They never went anywhere for more than a few
hours until this point. All I know is that there WAS SOMETHING there with us
that month, and no one will convince any of us that experienced this that there
wasn't!<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

that I have submitted. This one is in the same house. I still dont feel that
there is anything to fear in our &quot;little&quot; spirit. We still hear it
going up and down the stairs. It still does the little pranks with the TV and
such. It isnt an overly active ghost. Sometimes nothing will happen for a few
days at a time. The other day though, that wasnt the case. Due to kids being in
school and various after school activities and my husband having commitments
outside the house, I was alone for the better part of the day and evening. It
started as soon as I got home from work. I was on the computer and I kept
hearing banging around downstairs. I would check every time, just to find
nothing. My son has a habit of turning on the window unit A/C even though it
isnt warm enough to warrant it. Before going up, I always turn it off. I
noticed it was back on when I went down to check things out. Not positive that
I had actually turned it off, I just turned it off not thinking anything about
it. The banging started again. I went down to check it out and the A/C was back
on. That was a bit unnerving. Still not scared, i just turned it off and went
back upstairs to bed. The banging started up again, but this time in the
computer room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I tu ed on the TV to tune
it out and the glitching started. I &quot;yelled&quot; at the spirit as always
to cut it out and it stopped. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>I was planning on going out
with some girlfriends that night, so after the kids went about their evening
plans, i was once again alone in the house. I showered, put on make up. I was
hearing things on the basement steps the entire time. I admit, after hearing
stuff and experiencing so much in that short period of time, i was getting a
bit spooked. We have a bar that we can get to via a footbridge that runs across
the creek in front of our house. I was finished getting ready and relaxing
until i got the call from the girls. I was sitting at the kitchen table reading
some mail when i distinctly hear giggling break out on the basement steps.
Childlike laughter. Cute actually but that was it for me. I said outloud
&quot;its time to go get a drink at the bar!&quot; I stayed over there until my
friends came to get me.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>I was invited to my friends
house, after telling him that I have some strange feelings and can sense what
could be spirits. I entered the home and noticed a burned area in the doorway.
I asked him about this spot. His family is Greek and it is tradition to
&quot;Smoke&quot; a cross on doorways at Easter for good fortune and blessings.
I entered the next room and felt a sensation on my neck, like a cold hand
brushing on me. I turned to see nothing behind me. After continuing on to the
most active room of the house it was as if every hair on my body stood on end.
IT wasn't a pleasant feeling, as the cold hand, but a sensation of evil. I
guess the cold hand was warning me not to enter that room, it was only a few
feet away. God, it gives me chills just thinking about that awkward feeing in
my body. I continued in the room and felt a tugging at my right hand, there was
nothing there to be seen. I soon left the room, still with hair on ends, as
soon as I left that particular room, everything was calm and pleasant again. I
have been in the house since that time and still get a cold chill everytime I
get close to the room. I honestly think there is a lost soul in that room, that
is tormented and in ill spirit. I have not been in there with my digitial
recorder or camera yet, but hope to very soon. I'm still new at investigations.
I hope this story sparks an interest in someones mind.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

appeared to be a dressing gown parting the the long grass with her hands as if
she was looking for something she looked up and we shouted what are you looking
for? she stood up and walked towards us she stopped about 15 feet from us and
just stood there in front of us looking us up and down she seemd as mesmerised
as we were .By this time we were afraid she was also afraid not of us but of
our torches it seemed she strode towards us again so we shone our torches at
her which made her panic turn around and run after about 20 feet she
completeley dissapeared we ran back to our parents inside colwick hall and
explained what had happened expecting not to be believed we were overheard by
the owner who told us not to worry as it was only mary .We made a pact that we
would never mention what had happened and we never did .As i grew older i often

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>I was asleep one night and
had a very strange dream where my face was very messed up. My nose was
apparently broken and it seemed as if I was beaten up very badly. In my dream
my wife is looking at me and is in awe as to how my face looks so horrible. She
is just crying and saying my name repeatedly and asking how this happened and
that I look really terrible. In this dream I keep asking her whats wrong with
my face? I am lying on our apartments floor in just a really weird daze. The
day after the dream I had another dream which did not really seem like a dream
because it felt like I really experienced it. I saw this dark figure which I
couldnt make out and a black shadowy hand reaching over to me over my bed, as
it was coming over to touch me I just went under the covers. I tried to shake
it off but I realized it may not have been a dream, it seemed like I was still
conscious when I saw this apparition. The days passed by and everyone in my
family came down with some sort of a stomach flu which started from my brothers
friends son. He ended up passing this on to my brothers son which soon got
passed on to my wife and then my daughter and than ME. I had no idea how
devastating this flu would become but my daughter was soon sick vomiting for
over a week and was very sick. Soon after she got better I ended becoming sick.
I had never vomited since I was a kid. I ended up vomiting continuously for a
span of 12 hours. I basically puked my guts out all night (some sort of nasty
stomach virus). When I woke up in the morning to go to the bathroom I ended up
vomiting one more last time but this time I didnt feel right. I got up from
the bathroom floor after puking in the toilet and I felt like passing out.
&gt;From the moment I left the bathroom to the time I reached my living room (I
was trying to hit the couch) I could not remember a single thing. Apparently I
ended up blacking out that whole episode. My wife said that I looked like a
zombie when I came out of the washroom and I was walking so fast towards the
couch in my living room that I ended up going head first into the wall (studded
wall not regular hollow type walls) missing the couch, I basically just dove into
it. All I remember was a loud bang and waking up a few seconds later on the
floor of my apartment like the way it was in the dream. My wife mentioned later
that it almost looked like someone had shoved me right into the wall from the
way I flew. Suffice to say I was ok, but I ended up with a deviated septum
(broken nose) and a lot of swelling. Initially when my wife saw my face she was
hysterical (just like in the dream) and I was asking her what was wrong with my
face as she was just in shock While I laid there the whole dream sequence came
into perspective and I was beginning to get scared. Was it a premonition or was
it a warning from something or someone from beyond? Not to sound too hokey
pokey but I like to make a joke out of this whole incident because it was
probably the most traumatic incident of my life as I have not really had too
many events like this happen to me ever, Ive basically pretty much led an
uneventful normal life. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>While I laid on the floor I
said to myself I actually look the way I looked like in the dream and this
scared me when I saw my face in the mirror my wife brought out to me. Anyways
since then nothing really weird like that has happened yet. I do still
sometimes see a black figure of some sort standing by my bedside here and then
but nothing has come about it yet! Also after I healed up I went to go see a
priest about this whole incident as my mom kept bugging me too, and the priest
told me to be aware as it is possible this incident may come again??? Needless
to say I will never take these dreams or premonitions lightly ever again.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

true story of real happenings that happened to my whole family.<span

the Big Bear mountains.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Where do I
begin....upon driving up the driveway. the curtains would move in the upper

downstairs watching tv, and there would be footsteps upstairs and they would
stop directly above the area where we all sat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The toilet would flush by itself, and the water would turn on.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(these are just the little things) There was
a trunk in the closet in a room where supposedly a woman burned up and the bed
is still in there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There's black hairs
still stuck in parts of the bedframe.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Anyway, the lid of that trunk would slam.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now let me get to the good stuff.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My uncle was up there alone, and someone,
something tried to smother him with a pillow.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He fled without his clothes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My
cousin looked out the back door window, and saw a sillouette of a devil
face.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Me and my sister were asleep in a
bed downstairs, and the bed moved violently, not just a little bit ok, but
literally bounced!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I rolled over and
told my sister to stop it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was
barely waking up, and started to tell me the same thing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We jumped out of that bed so fast and never
looked back.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then, my dad, on a dare
because none of us would sleep in the bedroom where the lady burned to
death,(he thought we were all a bunch of sissies) he slept in there, and a
woman he thought to be my mom walked in and he motioned her to sit on the bed.
She did, and her hair turned black!!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>(my mom's a blond).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My dad
couldn't get out of there fast enough.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We all left the next morning. I slept upstairs one night, in the
opposite bedroom, and woke up in a trancelike state.<span

my mom, who was awake at that hour(it was </span></b><st1:time Minute="0"

word, and went back upstairs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>During the
night, I screamed out something about a fish..?????<span

means, but my cousin dreamed about the same thing, in the same bed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A fish. Something would lock us out, and we
would hear voices,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>just alot of wierd stuff.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>I beleive that my house has
sprits that live in the basement. Ever since I was young, I never quite felt
safe down there. I always could feel a presense with me when there was no one
down there but me. When I am in the basement on the computor,(like I am now),
it always sounds like someone is walking around upstairs in the kitchen, when I
am the only one home. I know that I have seen them too. I either see a white
image or a black image. Sometimes I get good vibes and sometimes bad vibes from
them. My home sits about 800ft away from a Catholic church and school. I truly
beleive that there are children that play outside at night on the toys. I have
heard them. It is hard to hear because it is a faint sound, but i know that
they are there. I beleive that my house was built over some type of grave yard.
Probably one that was used hundreds of years ago. My mom passed away 7 years
ago, and I think that she probably stays with me when I am by myself. She was a
musician, and everytime, at night, when I play the piano, the light above the
piano flickers a little when I have played omething that she likes. I also
think that my cousin who died when she was only 8 years old comes and visits as
well. Also, the lights in my living room have been known to turn on and off
without anyone else being there but me. Or, i will leave with some lights on
and come home and they are turned off. I do not fear them because they have not
done anything to me. I just leave them alone in the basement and keep the door
closed when I am not down there. Oh, yeah, when I am in my room, which is
upstaris, sometimes it sounds like someone is opening and closing the door to
the basement. I think it is someone mischevious just trying to make the hairs
on my neck stand up. Oh well. So, that is just a taste of what my house is
like.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

things that I became privy to while working there, and trust me, many of us
refused to go into certain areas/buildings alone  and the camp director did
not force any of us (and he was a SERIOUS guy by nature). <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;

remember the name of the hall but its haunted.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There have been reports of hearing footsteps, things being shuffled around
and moved, moans, and groans, and loud cracking noises, like the floor is going
to crack open.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One night while I was
working there, one of the counselors in my cabin was having a private
conversation with another counselor of the opposite sex, in this building.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They needed a quiet place where they wouldnt
be interrupted.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The boy suggested this
building, since no one would go in there, and no one would expect them to be in
there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The girl wasnt too thrilled, but
agreed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They wound up in the only room
with a light, which was the bathroom.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They talked for a while and after a few minutes heard a rustling.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They opened the door and looked around, and
saw nothing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They closed the door and a
few minutes later they were interrupted again, with a rustling. This time the
rustling was getting closer and more prominent a sound, so they opened the
door, hoping the light would shine far enough so they could see into the
darkness, perhaps it was a raccoon or something.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But they saw nothing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This time, they left the door open, and they
continued to talk.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After a few minutes
they were interrupted by a terrible desperate low pitched moan and the sound of
a loud cracking noise from the floor boards.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The girl counselor told me she was so scared she thought it really
sounded like the floor was going to crack open, but the moaning noise was
unlike anything shed ever heard before, so low pitched and desperate.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She refused to go in that building for quite
a while, and I had to accompany her in there during the day time on at least
one occasion because she just didnt feel comfortable being in there alone.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>That particular building
was off limits to quite a few of the counselors, whod also had experiences.
Generally you might see a couple of generations/different years of counselors
whod had experiences, or whod heard of experiences of other counselors;
stories passed down from previous years, but there were quite a few counselors
during the year I was there, whod had personal experiences with that building.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The camp director had been involved with this
camp for many years and although he was a serious guy, there were a couple of
places on camp grounds he did not force anyone into alone, or if they just
couldnt handle it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was one of
those places.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Toward the end of the
summer I was told by one of the nurses that this building was the original
Physical Therapy building, and since the camp was started back in the
mid-1940s a LOT of children in pain were treated in this building.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Having worked with the physically challenged
population I can tell you that a lot of the campers that went to Pine Tree Camp
were in pain quite frequently, and physical therapy was not a happy time for
them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Moving stiff joints, or rigid
appendages is oftentimes unpleasant, very painful, and the only thing they know
for sure is theyll have to do it again tomorrow.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So this building probably housed a lot of
pain, frustration, worry, anger lots of emotions.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>Another paranormally active
place on camp grounds is the Overnight spot.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Each session each cabin gets one overnight at the overnight spot.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The campers get to load up into a pontoon
boat and head to the other side of the lake to get ice cream at the ice cream
shack, and then the pontoon boat comes back to the camp-side of the lake where
everyone is dropped off at the overnight spot for a night of sleeping in a
tent, cooking out by the fire, singing camp-fire songs and toasting
marshmallows the whole 9 yards.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
reality, the overnight spot is really not that far from camp at all. Its a 5
minute walk, however, the trip across the lake before hand gives the campers a
sense of being farther away from camp than they actually are. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

stories of<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Overnight Spot were
most heavily guarded of all the haunted places on the camp grounds.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Im imagining it is because of the location,
its isolation from the rest of the camp, and also because there was only 1 camp
counselor who worked out there, solo, when there were no campers around because
she was responsible for prepping the site for campers to arrive, and cleaning
up the site when campers departed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
the reason this story sticks with a lot of us is because the camp directors
wife experienced a paranormal event when she was a counselor in her teen years,
that was so traumatic, she had only been back there a few times since it
occurred.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Heres how the story was told
to me, as best as I can remember it (Lets just say we didnt sleep well that
night, nor did we go to the outhouse without having another counselor watching
our back and lighting the way with a flashlight).<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>Somewhere in the 1980s a
group of counselors and campers were out at the overnight spot.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Theyd done their normal routine of settling
in, eating by the fire, singing campfire songs and going to bed in one of the
two giant canvas tents.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As is routine
for the counselors, someone is off duty each night.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On overnight night, the counselors who are
off duty still had to stay with the cabin, they just had a choice of being able
to sleep under the stars, literally, on the beach, with only their sleeping bag
and no tent, or they could sleep housed inside of one of the tents with the
on-duty counselors as well as the campers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>Needless to say, the off-duty counselors sometimes chose to sleep out
under the stars.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And so on this
particular night there were 3 or 4 counselors sleeping in a line, like
sardines, out on the beach near the water, tucked into their sleeping bags
comfy and cozy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sounded blissful until
sometime late in the evening after the fire had died down and the counselors
had gone off to sleep, the future-wife-of-the-director was awoken to the sound
of chanting, off in the distance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She
sat up slightly, facing the water, looked around, left and right, but couldnt
see where it was coming from. She saw her friends were sleeping and she was the
only one up so she couldnt understand who would be making these sounds, so she
tapped the friend to her left, who was sleeping on her stomach  facing the
campfire  and awoke her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She asked her
Do you hear that? and waited for a response from her friend, but got nothing
in return but a fixed gaze toward where the campfire had burned out hours
before.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The future-directors-wife
turned around and saw for herself <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>a
blazing hot fire, dangerously high, and campers sitting all around the campfire
chanting and singing in eerie tones, rocking their bodies back and forth in their
wheelchairs and on the giant logs around the fire, the fire lighting their
faces dramatically and the tones and chants and motions of the campers getting
more desperate, almost more aggressive violent, with every passing second it
scared the life out of the counselors on the beach who had witnessed it, and
after that night they refused to go back there without an escort, and even then
their return to that place was extremely minimal in count.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As I said, by the time I was a counselor
there, she hadnt been a counselor for a good 8 to 10 years and shed only been
back there less than a handful of times.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>When I witnessed her at the spot she was very uncomfortable, arms
folded, in a hurry to leave<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>Hi my name is Nikki Nelson
and I have an experience to share with you. I am 23 years old and this
experience happened when I was about 14 years old. I had told three friends of
mine that I had a brother that had passed away before I was even born. To my
surprise, my friends did not believe me. I told them that I would take them to
the cemetary where he was buried. They agreed to go. We all jumped in my car
and went to the cemetary. As we got to the cemetary, we had noticed that nobody
else was there because it was starting to get dark out. We happened to park
about 50 feet away from my brothers stone. I showed my friends his stone and
they were shocked. They were amazed that I had told them the truth. I also told
them that I had a Great-Grandmother that was buried there. We walked over to her
stone so I could say some respectful word in memory of her. Her stone is
approximately 250 feet from my brother's stone. We were on our way back to the
car, when we all happened to look towards my brother's stone again. Like I said
before, there was absolutely nobody else around. There were also no lights in
the cemetary back then. When we all looked towards my brother's stone, we all
had seen a red flashing light that looked like it was right above his stone.
This light had flashed three times. The flashing kind of came across in the
S.O.S. code. I myself believe in ghost, so I wasn't afraid. When my friends had
seen the flashing light, they started screaming extremely loud. They wanted to
get out of there as soon as we could. They ran as fast as they could to the
car. I was not afraid so I walked to the car. They kept screaming at me to
hurry up. When I got closer to my brother's stone, the red light was ack and
started flashing again right above his stone. I at that time did not know what
to think of it, so I had gotten in the car and we had left. Ever since then, I
have felt as though I have this chip on my shoulder at all times, telling me
when something bad is going to happen or has happened. For instance, if
something bad has already happened, I can give you quite a few details of the
incident without knowing what exactly happened. These are the details that you
would not usually know. Now, is this just a freak incident or not? You tell me.

my bed reading one night totally calm just interested in what I was reading I
suddenly lucidly heard my dog bark at the front door(my room was right over
where the front door would be downstairs)he used to do this to go out.. he was
an old slow good natured dog that took no interest in people passing by or
dogs.. it would just go to the front yard and do his business at about 11:00 pm
I swear it was as clear as day.. its as if he was in the house for the few
weeks after his death and he was just saying his goodbye's and letting us
know(no one but me heard it it was eerie like he meant me to hear it and no one
else)anyway he didn't just bark once he barked a few times while I was reading
the book. it was his distinctive sound.. I couldn't miss it or mistake it for
any other dog.. anyway I took his death really hard. I guess that was just his
way of letting me know there is an afterlife and that he was ok or that he
didn't know the difference anyway(which is kinda sad) anyway that was my little
experience out of a few.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:white'>Hi, Just wanted to share a
bad experience I had encountered in our spare room.1 day my daughter had a
friend staying for the night but I had this uneasy feeling about this girl,she
just sent bad vibes in the our house.I told my daughter how I felt about this
girl &amp; was not happy when she stayed the night.To cut the story short,
about 2AM the following morning I woke up &amp; was thirsty so I got up &amp;
headed down the stairs when I<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>felt a
cold brush against me &amp; I<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>saw a dark
shaddow running down the stairs &amp;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>out the front door.It happened so fast that I didn't thinlk anything of
it.That following day when my daughter's friend left, my daughter said that she
had a bad dream about a tall dark shaddow hovering down on her friend &amp;
that she was screaming<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&amp; calling out
for me about 2AM in the morning.My hair on my body stood up big time as this
was the same time I had seen &amp; felt the shaddow ran out of the front door.I
come from a background of spiritualists family &amp; I have learnt not to be
afraid of this spirits that I had experienced in the past.I then convinced my
daughter that the shaddow we had both had seen was a warning to keep away from
this girl.This girl is now away from our lives &amp; she had been sleeping
around with whomever is available &amp; has dropped out of school,no respect
for her parents whatsover.Just to show that it seemed that this shaddow hovered
Nats friend,as if saying !!! your friend is already in the dark, but u don't
have to be.In short ? Keep away from her.Nat had never associated with this
girl again.Beleive me!! It is a true story,<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
