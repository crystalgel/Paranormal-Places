<P><B>School Music Room</B>

<P><B>By: ineverwasapartofyou@thefragile.com</B>

<P><B>My good friend, Peter, of many years, had an experience the other
night. Peter</B>
<BR><B>is a very skeptical person when it comes tot he subject of 'Paranormal'.
But I</B>
<BR><B>think that might of changed because he was really scared when he
told me what he</B>
<BR><B>experienced. He said he was walking his dog at around midnight,
he was walking</B>
<BR><B>by the music room when someone inside started playing a trumpet,
he said it was</B>
<BR><B>pitch black inside. As he moved towards the window the playing stopped,
he</B>
<BR><B>started to back away and said he heard the instrument drop, then
he said 'I got</B>
<BR><B>the hell out of there'. Now I went this morning and took a look
inside and there</B>
<BR><B>was nothing but a drumset.</B>

<BR><B>Something in my Room</B>

<P><B>By: sgarci@lincoln.navy.mil</B>

<P><B>this is the last experience i have had happen to me. it happened
not too</B>
<BR><B>long ago. it was when i went back home on leave for 3 weeks in the
end of</B>
<BR><B>may to the middle of june. i slept in a room at my grandparents
house</B>
<BR><B>because that's where i stayed when i went back home. i slept there
without</B>
<BR><B>any trouble for the first few nights. but then one night as i was
finally</B>
<BR><B>dosing off i heard a faint noise, like a voice in my room, so i
looked</B>
<BR><B>around and saw nothing. i thought it was my imagination and tried
to forget</B>
<BR><B>about it. then i was starting to fall asleep again when i heard
it once</B>
<BR><B>more. it sounded just the same and i couldn't understand what i
heard. but</B>
<BR><B>it sounded like a female voice. i got a little worried and just
stared at</B>
<BR><B>the window for a while, then i was falling asleep when i heard it
once more.</B>
<BR><B>i got up and didn't hear it again. so i got really worried and couldn't</B>
<BR><B>sleep for a while. so i stared at the window again and saw a shadow
go back</B>
<BR><B>and forth real quick. it couldn't of been the tree shadow because
i didn't</B>
<BR><B>hear a car pass by. so i was real scared then. but i just kept staring
at</B>
<BR><B>the window and didn't see it again. but instead of either of those
happening</B>
<BR><B>again i started hearing a sound like something vibrating on the
table by my</B>
<BR><B>bed. but it was low. so i looked around again and saw nothing. i
kept</B>
<BR><B>hearing it go off and on. so i got up and went to the table where
i heard it</B>
<BR><B>coming from. when i got to it i heard the sound as if it were right
in front</B>
<BR><B>of me, it was pretty loud,but nothing was there. and it didn't sound
as if</B>
<BR><B>it were on the table. it sounded like it came from behind the rocking
chair</B>
<BR><B>in the corner. i moved my hand around there and didn't feel anything.
soon</B>
<BR><B>after it just stopped and i was scared still. so i turned on the
lamp and</B>
<BR><B>slowly fell asleep. the next night i would hear little cracks in
the walls,</B>
<BR><B>but it wasn't the same as the ones you would hear in an old house.
so right</B>
<BR><B>after i heard that i turned on my light again and tried falling
asleep. the</B>
<BR><B>next morning i talked to my aunt, uncle and grandmother about it
because</B>
<BR><B>they asked me why my light would be on when they woke up. i told
them why</B>
<BR><B>and my aunt and uncle told me about stuff they would hear some nights
as if</B>
<BR><B>someone was trying to talk to them, but they would try to ignore
it. but for</B>
<BR><B>some reason it would only happen when everything was off and it
was really</B>
<BR><B>quiet. they even said that my grandfather would hear stuff, but
he rarely</B>
<BR><B>heard it. my grandmother just giggled at us and said she never heard</B>
<BR><B>anything. so for the next few nights i slept with my lamp light
on. then my</B>
<BR><B>grandfather came in one night and was spraying holy water around
the whole</B>
<BR><B>inside of the house. he later told me that he did it because he
heard about</B>
<BR><B>my nights in the room. he told me that as he was spraying the holy
water he</B>
<BR><B>could feel the hairs on the back of his neck stand up real hard
the whole</B>
<BR><B>time. but he kept doing it. he said after he finished going around
the house</B>
<BR><B>that it stopped and he didn't feel the hairs on the back of his
neck stand</B>
<BR><B>up anymore. after that night, i slept without trouble ever again.
i was</B>
<BR><B>still nervous, but didn't hear a thing.</B>
<BR><B>thaks for reading and thanks for your time</B>

<BR><B>Stories from Laos</B>

<P><B>By: Sn0okie1584@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>These are my mom's experiences. When she was a young girl, living
somewhere in Laos, she saw a neighbor's dead daughter. She told me that,
she was out by her self picking some sort of plant to give it to her friend
to make it into a necklace for her. She was alone at this time at the edge
of her village picking the plant, when she looked up she saw the girl walking
towards her and staring at her. My mom just froze there staring at the
girl coming closer to her. She finally started running back to the village
and told her mom.</B>
<BR><B>Another one was when her mom told her to go lock up the animals.
It was getting late and she didn't want to go alone so her little brother
went with her. They had a dog and when they got to the chickens the dog
kept barking towards a little ditch under the chicken coop. It stuck it's
nose down there and my mom said that it sounded like the dog got smacked.
She heard the smack and the dog cried out. Both her and her brother saw
the little creature run out of the ditch towards the creek by there house.
She told me that it looked like an old midget lady in raggedy clothes with
stringy hair. The dog chased her to the creek and I guess she smacked him
again kuz he cried out louder this time and ran back to my mom and her
brother. She swears to this day that she saw that little creature. Anyway,
it always freaks me out whenever she mentions that story...just to see
something like that.</B>

<BR><B>The Chair</B>

<P><B>By: nitalja@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>This story takes place in my old apartments. I was 4 years old. There
some really nice people that lived there. One was this lady I will call
Nina. She gave us this white dresser. It was so beautiful. A month later
she died. Me and my sister loved the dresser. One day my mom bought us
this little mini chair. It was so cute. A normal size person couldn't sit
in it, probably a 2 or 3 year could. Anyways, we sat it on top of the dresser
where it faced the window. One night I woke up, it wasn't normal for me
to wake up that late. At that instant I seen something in the corner of
my eye. It was the chair rocking back and forth. Since the the chair was
facing the window the moon cast a shadow on the wall, and there was a shadow
on the wall sitting in there chair. Even though I couldn't see it sitting
in the chair, it was there. I was so shocked and at the age I was I started
crying still looking at it. At that point the head of the shadow turned
and looked at me, it didn't have a face to it, but as it turned it seem
to say something. It was kinda going and coming with the wind. The voice
sounded just like Nina, but it was such a small body. She said "Shhhh,
don't cry, I'm not going to hurt you." At this point I knew I had the craziest
look on my face. Then she said " It's me, Nina. Hi honey" Her voice was
so comforting, I crawled out of my bed. I was shocked at myself for doing
that. That it not like me at all. It was like she was telling me it was
ok. That's when I finally said something I said "Nina, but.." Then she
said "I know, I'm not living anymore, but it doesn't mean I can't visit
you" That's when I asked "Why are you a little girl?" Then she said " It's
the chair, your mom bought the chair from a family who's little girl died,
and I'm her because it's sitting on top of my dresser" Then she vanished.
I stayed looking at the chair for a while, but decided to wake up my sister,
but as usual she didn't believe me. So I went back to sleep. The next morning
I woke up and walked up to the chair and seen a lot of strains of hair
sitting in the chair, none of ours. It turned out the girl who onced owned
the chair had Cancer and had Leukemia. We no longer have the chair, but
I know she is still with me.</B>

<BR><B>The Little Girl</B>

<P><B>By: Ginnypoo13@aol.com</B>

<P><B>There is a place called Tatem Springs in Willisburg, Kentucky. I
don't know if you've heard of it. At one time it was a hotel, and at one
time it ws a 4-h camp. Me, two of my sisters, and a couple friends went
up there one day, and we walked around inside and everything. When we came
back out there was another car outside. We went up there and they told
us a story that a few weeks ago they had taken a picture of the ballroom
and there was a figure of a little girl kneeling with her arm under her
chin, and there was a man standing behind her. They said that they did
some research and they found out that when it was a hotel a little girl
had drown in the river next to it. A few weeks later my sisters went to
this girls grave and there was a picture on top of it where the girl was
sitting in the same position as she had been in the picture.</B>

<P><B>The Other Me</B>

<P><B>By: stevens_babygirl420@msn.com</B>

<P><B>My name is Clarissa. I am 17 years old. When I was 11 years old my
mother</B>
<BR><B>and I lived in a huge trailer in Seabeck Washington. We both felt
someting</B>
<BR><B>strange about the trailer but we just thought that it was old. After
we had</B>
<BR><B>lived there for about 2 weeks my mom told me that she could feel
the</B>
<BR><B>presance of spirits with us. I was only 11 so of corce I got scared
to death</B>
<BR><B>so from then on my mom never said anything about it. This is where
it gets</B>
<BR><B>good. On a rainy day I was outsied playing with my dog. I heared
my mom</B>
<BR><B>talking to someone, I knew that it wasnt the T.V that I heared because
a big</B>
<BR><B>storm had hit a couple of days before so we had no power. We also
didnt have</B>
<BR><B>a phone at that time so I knew that she was talking to me or herself.
I went</B>
<BR><B>in the house and asked her who she was talking to and she said "you",
but I</B>
<BR><B>was outside with the dog. I told her that and she said that she
was just</B>
<BR><B>talking to me and that I had just walked into my room, shut the
door and</B>
<BR><B>then came in throught the front door. The front door was on the
other end of</B>
<BR><B>the trailer. She had asked me to clean my room before I did anything
so I</B>
<BR><B>did. After she had told me what she saw I went into my room and
everything</B>
<BR><B>was out of plae. The reason why I think that the person she saw
was the</B>
<BR><B>other me is because when my mom was pregnate with me she was supposed
to</B>
<BR><B>have twin girls but my twin sister died at birth. I think that that
might</B>
<BR><B>have been her.</B>

<P><B>Train Tracks</B>

<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>On your site there is a story about belleville. Near there there
are train tracks and if you put your car in neutral it will move over the
tracks. It's said that a little boy died there and it is him who is pushing
the car over the tracks. This was a few weeks ago some friends and I were
coming back froma Cardanals game when one of them started telling us this
story. We were near the exit so he took us to this place. At first he turned
the car off and we sat there. We started to hear all these noises as if
the gears wear trying to work. Then he turned the car on and put it in
nuetral. Sure enought we went over the tracks and half way down the road.
It was so odd we were in a jeep so it's not like we rolled by ourself.
So, we tried it agian. The same thing happened again. I don't know what
happened out there but something sure did.</B>

<BR><B>Was it a Ghost?</B>

<P><B>By: liltexasdreamer@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>My name is Ciara and I'm 16 years old . The house we live in isn't
exactly what I would call haunted . But we have had lots of things happen
since we moved in 3 years ago that we cannot explain . My mom is an amature
ghost hunter and she has taken pictures of some of the ghosts or spirits
in our house .I have personally had things happen to me . My bedroom is
really scary and freaky and I won't sleep in it at all . I sleep in the
living room on one of the two sofas in there .</B>
<BR><B>One night I was sleeping on the sofa by the windows directly across
from the couch that is against the wall that divides the kitchen and living
room . I was sound asleep when I woke up to the feeling that someone was
in the room with me and it was quite scary. I opened my eyes and looked
across at the other sofa and there was a really tall black misty smoky
looking , thing? When it turned towards me and saw me lookin at it , it
slinked around the corner into the kitchen . I pulled the covers over my
face cause I was afraid it was going to come back . Well, a few seconds
later I heard someone walking across the floor and then sit down on the
sofa by the wall . I took the covers away from my face and looked at the
couch no one was there , but I could see the indentations in the couch
as though someone were there . I was too scared to scream for my mom ,
so for the rest of the night I slept with the covers over my head . I didn't
take them off till I knew for sure that it was morning and the sun was
out .</B>
<BR><B>I told my mom about what happened and she right away got her camera
out and began taking pictures of me and the couch where that tall black
thing was . When she got the pictures back , there was something big black
and smoky , misty looking over my head and next to me in all the pictures
she took . But only the ones with me in them.</B>
<BR><B>I hope this is scary enough for all your readers cause it certainly
scared me and it is all true . It really did happen.</B>

<BR><B>White Rock Lake Ghost</B>

<P><B>By: sgarci@lincoln.navy.mil</B>

<P><B>hello once again. i am here because i have another story that happened
on my</B>
<BR><B>prom night. it wasn't to me, but it was to a friend of mine. it
was back in</B>
<BR><B>april of 2001 when it happened. me and my homeboy went to the prom
with our</B>
<BR><B>dates and one of their cousins. we had fun and all, then later on
that</B>
<BR><B>night, or in the early hours of the morning we had went to White
Rock Lake</B>
<BR><B>in dallas, tx. it was around 3 am or so when we got there because
i remember</B>
<BR><B>looking at my watch. while on the way there we were talking about
stories we</B>
<BR><B>heard fo a woman that is seen there sometimes late at night. sometime
she</B>
<BR><B>would be seen walking and given a ride, but when they would drop
her off</B>
<BR><B>there would just be a wet puddle in the back seat. others say they
have seen</B>
<BR><B>her right at the edge of the lake. anyways, we were there just bullshitting</B>
<BR><B>around and all. then we went down a steepe hill to a bench right
close to</B>
<BR><B>the edge of the water. we were there having a good time and tripping
out.</B>
<BR><B>when we sat there one of the date's cousin was with us. he sat next
to me</B>
<BR><B>and a few seconds later he had me look at a bush by the water. he
told me</B>
<BR><B>there was a lady in a white dress just looking at me. so i looked
and didn't</B>
<BR><B>see anything, so i told him to be quiet because i thought he was
just trying</B>
<BR><B>to scare me because of the stories we heard. but when i looked at
him he was</B>
<BR><B>serious and didn't make a grin or anytinhg. then again he tells
me to look</B>
<BR><B>because he said she wouldn't stop looking at me. i stared at the
bush for a</B>
<BR><B>while and still saw nothing, so i just forgot about it and was with
my date</B>
<BR><B>and was away form them for a while. then we went back and sat on
the bech</B>
<BR><B>while my date took a picutre of us. after that my boy's date asked
us all to</B>
<BR><B>come back to the bench so she could take a picture of us.&nbsp;
so we went and</B>
<BR><B>all sat at the bench. so we were looking at the camera waiting for
her to</B>
<BR><B>take a picture of us. while she was waiting for us so she could
take the</B>
<BR><B>picture she was standing by the lake with her back towards the water.
but</B>
<BR><B>right when she was about to, all of a sudden we saw her jerk forward
as if</B>
<BR><B>she was&nbsp; going to fall over. she dropped her camera and ran
up the hill</B>
<BR><B>screaming loud and didn't stop running until she got to the top
by the car.</B>
<BR><B>meanwhile we just stayed on the bench laughing at her the whole
time. we</B>
<BR><B>told her to come back and she wouldn't. so my homeboy got her camera
she</B>
<BR><B>dropped and we went up to her. we asked her what happened and she
asked if</B>
<BR><B>we saw that. we told her we saw her lean forward, but that was it.
then she</B>
<BR><B>told us that as she was about to take the picture when she felt
something</B>
<BR><B>just push her real hard from the back. we didn't take her serious
and we</B>
<BR><B>kept trying to get her to come back down. soon she came down a little
and</B>
<BR><B>then she just started crying and wouldn't stop. so we got in the
car and</B>
<BR><B>left. and that was the closest i came to the ghost at the lake</B>

<P><B>Voices in Sleep</B>

<P><B>By: daveburch@fuse.net</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Hi, here are some possible experiences with the paranormal i've had.Well,
sometimes in my sleep, I hear things whispering my name, or talking to
me, or to others. It's hard to explain, since i'm asleep and don't concentrate
that much on the details. It's just like people carrying on conversations
with each other or me, it's creepy!!! Sometimes, though not as much as
others, I am in that state where i'm waking up, but still asleep, almost
like those dreams you have when it seems you're awake, but you're still
asleep, but you like get up out of&nbsp; bed, and your room is in EXACT
detail as in real life.Well, sometimes I am ALMOST awake, and I seem to
hear myself talking to other beings that I have no recollection of conversing
with, like, it's another me or something, yet I KNOW that it's really ME!!!!
It's not really frightening, just very odd, sort of eerie, yet fascinating
at the same time. One time I can vividly remember, I was in that STATE,
and I heard people talking, seemingly from the other side of the room,
and they were talking about disaster, and a very lonely old woman. It was
very odd to me, and I wrote it off as a dream, and went about my days regularly
as if it had never happened. Well, about three or so months later, an old
lady down the street from me had her house burned down, and I heard my
parents talking to some closer neighbors to her, and they said that her
husband had died nine years earlier, and he had beat her, but despite them
telling her to take her children and leave him, she stayed and endured
the abuse. She had five kids, and we talked to three, her two sons and
one daughter ( only daughter) at her house, taking furniture and valuables
rightfully theirs in the old woman's will, and, anyway, she said that her
mother wasn't allowed any friends on account of their father ( a very controlling,
evil, angry man) and that she had been very lonely as long as they could
remember. The oldest son was 35, and the daughter, the youngest, 26, and
the daughter said she heard her mother crying a lot at night, and even
contemplating suicide. So, obviously, the woman was exteremely lonely,
and, being emotionally and physically abused, was probably leading a lonely,
cold life. She was 55, a quite young age to die at, and her late(r) husband
was 57. He was, by his children's word, in a fatal car accident, spent
a night in the hospital, and died. Sorry this was soo long, just wanted
to get in all the details, possible explanations FOR the paranormal of
these events. I knew the woman a little, i'll call her Mrs. Weavley, and
she was considerably a nice neighborhood elderly woman, very sweet to me,
but even in my younger years, she seemed lonely and depressed, since she
seemed to have no one to talk to, no childhood girlfriends, no one really
at all, that she could even grieve her considerably miserable life with,
and her children, by the time I was old enough to remember any of it today,
and to pick up any vibes, emotions from people, were grown and gone, and
had even made her a grandmother a few times. As a child, a few years before
her husband, Mr. Weavely, died, I spent a night or two there, when I was
maybe four or five, when her children babysat me ( her youngest daughter,
about 19, and her youngest son, 21, both still at home). Her daughter's
name is Melissa, and her youngest son is Joshua ( he hates "Josh" for some
reason). Her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Weavely, were often fighting, for some
reasons I didn't know, some I did. They never FOUGHT, like fists, but raising
voices in their room, things they never thought I could hear, but I could.
I know they fought a lot over Melissa, since she was pregnant at 19, and
they fought about it being on or the other's fault for not raising her
right, stuff like that. Anyway, I was there one night being all-night babysat
my Melissa, when she was just two or three months, not that big, still
able to get around and about to a four or five year old ( one of those
ages at the time) and I remember her parents being out at some meeting,
but I could still hear their screams, and it frightened me quite much,
Joshua, in his room asleep, and Melissa, asleep on the couch's pullout
bed, beside me, asked why I was crying one night ( when I was talking to
her recently) and said that I had replied " mama and papaw Weavley are
screaming too loud" ( I called them mama and papaw, since they were&nbsp;
like g-parents to me, since both mine lived in far away states.) She said
she told me that and then said " Kelli, sweetly, mama and papaw are both
gone, you must have been dreaming." Yet, from details I somehow kept this
long (i'm now 14) I remember hearing them while I was wide awake, wrapped
up in the pullout bed covers ( I was sleeping next to Melissa, since she
WAS my babysitter, and she needed and wanted to be with me at all times)
and being terrified, consumed by that same insecure feeling I often felt
while they fought, and not getting any sleep at all that night. I remember
being woke up again, by a shrill sound screaming across the room at someone
close to me, shouting " she's 19!!!! How the hell can that happen?? That
Matthew isn't going to be there for her OR that child!!! Christ!!! He's
18 himself!!!!" I remember waking up at about 9:30 the next day, and Melissa
and Joshua were already wide awake, Melissa making breakfast, Joshua eating
what was already made, before rushing off to his job. It must seem weird,
I know, but somehow I can remember all this, even after all these years,
even while I can't&nbsp; hardly remember what happenend only yesterday,
( lol, must be the teen in me). I asked her why mama and papaw and papaw
were yelling at her the night before (since I Was too young then to know
what a child was to a 19 year old) and I remember hearing her say "O my
GOD!!!! You heard it, too? Kelli, baby, I thought that was a DREAM!!!!"
She said some more stuff neither of us can remember today, and we ate our
breakfasts in total silence, except for, i'm sure, some comments from my
little curious mouth. Well, I spoke to her a few weeks ago, when she and
a few brothers were getting stuff from their mother's house, and I was
babysitting&nbsp; her little 7, going on 8 year old son, Christopher (
named after his step-father, whom Melissa married about three months after
the events that night, we went to the wedding, I have pictures, lol) and
her husband, Christopher Sr. told me some stuff that happened to him there
when Melissa, Christopher Jr., and he lived there for a few months after
Chris Jr. was born, and they didn't have a house yet. Well, on their wedding
certificate, it had their names, Melissa Lynn Larvette, Christopher Allen
Larvette, and it sat in a little homemade marriage-decorated frame Mrs.
Weavley made for them, a set that has their wedding pictures in it, too.
Anyway, it sat on the desk that Chris Sr. used to conduct his business
from home, along with some other pics of him, his wife, and his son (he's
always considered Chris Jr. his son). Well, he said that during the night,
he had gotten out of bed to go to the aid of little crying Chris Jr., since
Melissa was dead asleep, and he hated waking her up ( sweet, I know, lol)
and when he went to Chris Jr.'s room, he saw him rocking back and forth
in invisible arms just above the crib!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He said he was frightened
to death, almost fainted, and just as he thought he was dreaming, about
to faint, Chris Jr. was slowly lowered back down into his crib, and he
said he felt a very, very faint, mist-like feeling go past him, sheer his
arm comfortably, and then it was gone. He ran to Chris Jr.'s crib, picked
him up, and rocked him back and forth to sleep in the chair next to the
crib for the rest of the night. Well, got to go now.</B>

<BR><B>They</B>

<P><B>By: heathershaw78@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>I had just sent in two experiences last night that my mother had
had, and was discussing them with my sister when we reminisced about another
experience that had happened years ago in the house we grew up in. My sister
was about 3 and I was about 6 at the time. We were sitting at the kitchen
table with my parents, it was suppertime, when my sister started laughing
and pointing in a corner of the kitchen saying, "Look at that funny man!
Who is that funny man?" She kept laughing and saying look at the funny
man for several minutes while the rest of us sat there confused as there
was nothing in the corner at all.&nbsp; When we asked her "What man?" she
kept pointing in the corner saying, "Right there."&nbsp; She of course
has no recollection of this event.&nbsp; Another event, I was about 2 or
3, I don't remember this at all, my mother always tells me this story,
she was putting me to bed upstairs when all of a sudden I say to her, "Don't
worry mom, they won't hurt you." My mom replied,"who won't?" "They won't."
I said. After questioning me for a few minutes, to which I kept replying
"They won't hurt you." My mom said goodnight.This of course left her feeling
uneasy, but we never did find out who "they" were!</B>

<BR><B>The Watcher</B>

<P><B>By: grace_willson@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;This is a story of an old trialer I lived in in Southfield
Michigan a few years ago it's kinda long so please have a little patients.&nbsp;
When I first moved in, I had the bedroom in the front of the house and
slept great, but my room mate would often have her friends spend the night
because she didn't feel comfortable sleeping in the trailers bigger bedroom
alone.&nbsp; When people would pass down the hallway to get to the room
the hall would be freezing dispite the fact that the furnace was right
next to it.&nbsp; As time went on strange things started happening to my
roommate.&nbsp; Glasses would come flying across the room at her.&nbsp;
I had actually seen it once and began to tease her, "Maybe it's a ghost
and he just doesn't like you."&nbsp; Eventually we ended up having a falling
out and the events got worse.&nbsp; It seemed as if some one or something
really had it in for her.&nbsp; She ended up moving out and leaving me
in a lurch.&nbsp; I moved my bedroom to the back of the house&nbsp; because
it was a bigger&nbsp; room.&nbsp; I found that I couldn't sleep very well
in there as well. I would maybe get only 4 to 6 hours of sleep a night.&nbsp;
I had known she wasn't lying but I had figured it wouldn't bother me that
much thinking about the comfort a bigger room would give me. It started
off where I would feel like some one was watching me whenever I was in
the room particularly when the door was open.&nbsp; I tried to stick it
out detirmined not to be a chicken.&nbsp; Then it seemed to progress, I
would wake up in the middle of the night hearing a male voice saying my
name.&nbsp; Sometimes it was so loud that It would scare me half to death,
but it only seemed to happen when I was so sound asleep that I wouldn't
wake up to take my asthma medication.&nbsp; Then a man began to appear
sometimes at night.&nbsp; He was a young may that had short brown hair
and wore blue jeans and a blue collared shirt.&nbsp; I move out of the
room and started sleeping in the living room so I could sleep with the
television on and have some sort of light.&nbsp; I began seeing him in
the hallway.&nbsp; He would stand there and stare at me.&nbsp; He would
stay for hours on end.&nbsp; Eventually I got fed up and spoke to him,
I told him,"Alright, it's apparent we have to live here together so here's
my deal.&nbsp; You let me sleep at night and I'll find out how I can help
you."&nbsp; I never felt any animosity from him and he had never actually
thrown anything at me like he had my room mate.&nbsp; The sightings began
to stop but you could still feel his presence sometimes.&nbsp; I found
out months later that a man had been killed in that trailer while trying
to protect his girlfriend from a man who had broken into his house.&nbsp;
I couldn't find out much more because many of my neighbors were afraid
to say much about it.&nbsp; I had a guy friend spend the night one night
on my living room floor after a night of drinking, he had thought it was
funny that I wouldn't sleep in my own room.&nbsp; I woke up early and saw
him sitting white faced on the floor.&nbsp; He told me he had seen a man
staring at him angrily all night from the hall way.&nbsp; I told him about
the sightings that I had in the house and he proceeded to tell me some
of the stories that the rest of our group had told him from times they
had been over.&nbsp; It turns out most of them had seen him and had actually
experienced a little more than I had if I had left them at the house when
I was not at home.&nbsp; One of my friends wouldn't even stay when I was
not at home because she would constantly smell smoke comming from the furnace.&nbsp;
Well, none the less, this ghost and I ended up having a happy co-exhistance
untill an ex-boyfriend had moved in with me.&nbsp; Things similar to what
had happened to my ex roommate ended up happening to him.&nbsp; He had
even seen a man standing in the bathroom one day when he was showering.&nbsp;
The bathroom was in the same hallway as the haunting.&nbsp; Eventually
the bills got to be too much for my boyfriend and I and we decided to move
out.&nbsp; The events then reached thier peak.&nbsp; Lights would flicker
on and off constantly.&nbsp; Fans would turn on and off in the middle of
the night at speeds higher than the fan could naturaly go.&nbsp; You could
often hear yelling comming from the back of the trailer at odd hours of
the night.&nbsp; Banging could be heard inside the walls of the hallway.&nbsp;
We moved eventually.&nbsp; I kinda feel bad though.&nbsp; It was almost
as if he thought I was leaving him.&nbsp; Which I know is ridiuclous, he's
a ghost.&nbsp; Not to mention I still feel really bad that I hadn't found
a way to help him.&nbsp; That's my story, thanks for your time.</B>

<P><B>The Trestles</B>

<P><B>By: schickfu@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>My story happened at a railroad trestles bridge just</B>
<BR><B>out of town when I lived with my parents.&nbsp; I lived in</B>
<BR><B>a neighborhood that was decent sized, but right on the</B>
<BR><B>edge of town.&nbsp; 100 yards from my house our street</B>
<BR><B>turned to gravel, as it was the end of city road care.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;The road went between tall trees on either side and</B>
<BR><B>was spooky in itself.&nbsp; But a half mile down there were</B>
<BR><B>railroad tracks on a spooky trestle bridge.&nbsp; Over the</B>
<BR><B>years, town freaks would party there and spray painted</B>
<BR><B>nazi and satanic stuff all over it.&nbsp; They always said</B>
<BR><B>it was haunted, be we thought they were just freaks.</B>
<BR><B>But the story was all over town that the bridge had</B>
<BR><B>been used in the past by the KKK to hang blacks</B>
<BR><B>because of it's convenient out of the city limits</B>
<BR><B>placement.&nbsp; Any way, my friend and I were really never</B>
<BR><B>afraid and would go thee to hang out and talk, since</B>
<BR><B>it was so close to my house.&nbsp; We drove under it,</B>
<BR><B>turned around, and parked in a bulge in the road, then</B>
<BR><B>climbed up and started talking.&nbsp; It was a full moon,</B>
<BR><B>so we could see the white gravel very well, though it</B>
<BR><B>was very late.&nbsp; Soon we heard steps in the gravel, and</B>
<BR><B>thought a deer was close.&nbsp; We threw rocks towards the</B>
<BR><B>noise to scare it out, but the steps just stopped.</B>
<BR><B>For the next few minutes we talked, still hearing the</B>
<BR><B>steps, still thinking it was an animal.&nbsp; Soon we both</B>
<BR><B>stopped and listened, it seemed the sound was coming</B>
<BR><B>right in front of us, below on the road.&nbsp; We thought</B>
<BR><B>we should be able to see what it was by now, for the</B>
<BR><B>white gravel was very bright in the full moon.&nbsp; Soon</B>
<BR><B>we began thinking something was strange about the</B>
<BR><B>steps, then we realized what...they were very</B>
<BR><B>definitely coming from something with two feet.&nbsp; Then</B>
<BR><B>the freakiest thing happened, the noise sounded</B>
<BR><B>definitely as if it were just walking around the car,</B>
<BR><B>the muffled crunches as it went behind.&nbsp; We were</B>
<BR><B>freaked and had no idea what to do.&nbsp; We saw absolutely</B>
<BR><B>nothing there, but when we threw rocks by where we</B>
<BR><B>heard the noises, they would stop for a second.</B>
<BR><B>Finally we decided to bolt for the car and tear off..</B>
<BR><B>we really weren't listening for the steps then, and I</B>
<BR><B>unfortunately was too scared to look in the rear view</B>
<BR><B>mirror as we left.&nbsp; I say that because later a friend</B>
<BR><B>said he was driving down that road and as he was</B>
<BR><B>passing under the bridge he looked in his rear view</B>
<BR><B>and saw a scared black man chasing his car, yet he</B>
<BR><B>looked more like he was running from something.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>freaky thing was that my friend freaked and slammed</B>
<BR><B>the gas, but the apparition stayed exactly the same</B>
<BR><B>distance, about ten feet, from his car.&nbsp; He</B>
<BR><B>disappeared while he was looking at him.&nbsp; I now cannot</B>
<BR><B>stand to be there at night, and hardly at day.&nbsp; It's</B>
<BR><B>not as much what happened, which really wasn't that</B>
<BR><B>much, but the feeling that place gives me, I even felt</B>
<BR><B>it some before this happened.</B>

<BR><B>The Grinning Ghost of Olivas Adobe</B>
<BR><B>Ventura, CA</B>

<P><B>By: zacolby@earthlink.net</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>My encounter occurred around 1993. I was driving home late (around
2am)</B>
<BR><B>from work, down a road in my hometown of Ventura, CA. I didn't particularly</B>
<BR><B>like this road, due to it being several miles long, with no street
lights,</B>
<BR><B>on the outskirts of town, and runs between large golf courses and
hills.</B>
<BR><B>It's a connecting road between Ventura, and Oxnard Harbor. It's
a two lane</B>
<BR><B>road, with large deep ditches on both sides. These ditches begin
at the</B>
<BR><B>edge of the road shoulder, and stretch probably a good 10 feet or
more</B>
<BR><B>until the beginning of 30 foot high chainlink fences that guard
the golf</B>
<BR><B>courses. When you're driving through these particular parts, you
only have</B>
<BR><B>the moon, and your headlights, as the closest houses are several
miles away.</B>
<BR><B>I was cruising down the road, not thinking much of anything, listening
to</B>
<BR><B>my music, and looking forward to being home soon. Suddenly, approximately</B>
<BR><B>100 feet ahead of me, I saw a woman standing on the left side of
the road</B>
<BR><B>(my side). As I drew closer, I could see she was wearing a large
brimmed</B>
<BR><B>hat, and a long sun dress. I also vividly remember seeing her grinning
from</B>
<BR><B>ear to ear. She wasn't moving, just standing facing the opposite
side of</B>
<BR><B>the road, as if she were going to cross it, or something. Since
I was</B>
<BR><B>traveling close to 40mph, I only saw the woman for a few seconds.
Next</B>
<BR><B>thing I know, I'd passed her. I suddenly realized how strange it
was that</B>
<BR><B>there would be a young woman (about early 20's) STANDING AT THE
SIDE OF A</B>
<BR><B>DARK ROAD in the middle of nowhere!! I thought maybe her car had
broken</B>
<BR><B>down, or she was in trouble, so I instantly slammed on my breaks,
and stuck</B>
<BR><B>my head out the window as I was backing up. The red from my tail
lights lit</B>
<BR><B>the area behind me pretty well, and I could see there was noone
back there.</B>
<BR><B>I backed up a great distance (further than I'd traveled upon seeing
her),</B>
<BR><B>and STILL NOTHING. I turned on my brights, just to be sure. NOTHING.
I</B>
<BR><B>figured since it was late, and I was tired, it was most likely my</B>
<BR><B>imagination. I was kind of shaken, because I didn't remember being
super</B>
<BR><B>fatigued, and I saw her so clearly. I continued on my way home,
thinking</B>
<BR><B>really nothing more of it. Later, when I arrived home, a thought
occurred</B>
<BR><B>to me. She was so brightly lit, as if a spotlight were upon her.
I remember</B>
<BR><B>her being lit with a bright white light, including her hat, face,
body, and</B>
<BR><B>dress, from head to toe. Normally, when you shine headlights on
someone</B>
<BR><B>from a great distance, you cannot see them until the lights are
upon them.</B>
<BR><B>I remember seeing her WAY AHEAD of my headlight beams!! I then occurred
to</B>
<BR><B>me, that I'd seen a ghost. I never did see her there again.</B>
<BR><B>About two years later, I was home sick from work, and was watching
a talk</B>
<BR><B>show about teenage spiritual sightings. A girl that lived near the
East</B>
<BR><B>coast was talking about her first sighting. She said she was in
Ventura, CA</B>
<BR><B>at Olivas Adobe, for a wedding reception. I heard her mention my
hometown</B>
<BR><B>of Ventura, so it caught my attention!! While at the reception,
she said</B>
<BR><B>she kept seeing what looked like a semi-transparent figure of a
woman,</B>
<BR><B>quickly drifting through the trees, vanishing in and out of focus.
She was</B>
<BR><B>so convinced of it, she pulled up background history of that location,
and</B>
<BR><B>discovered a young woman was raped and murdered there, approximately
100</B>
<BR><B>years before!! Apparently, she managed to make it to the road, and
died</B>
<BR><B>while waiting for someone to come along. The woman on the show went
on to</B>
<BR><B>describe her dress, and how she seemed to be smiling... I knew she
was</B>
<BR><B>descibing the same thing I'd seen 2 years earlier.</B>
<BR><B>About a year ago (8 years after all of this), I stumbled on to The</B>
<BR><B>Shadowlands, and happened to see the brief mentioning of the ghost
woman at</B>
<BR><B>Olivas Adobe, in Ventura CA, under the Haunted Places Index. Between
my</B>
<BR><B>personal encounter, the woman on TV, and now Shadowlands, I'm ABSOLUTELY</B>
<BR><B>convinced my experience was 100% authentic. I'd never heard ANY
ghost</B>
<BR><B>stories for those golf courses, but I have one of my own now!!</B>

<P><B>The Boy and Others</B>

<P><B>By: sexydevilangel_69@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>I am 15 years old but I have had experiences with ghosts and spirits
since I</B>
<BR><B>was 4 years old. We used to live in a house in Sheboygan Wisconsin
and in my</B>
<BR><B>room...which was a little add on room that was once used as a den
or storage</B>
<BR><B>room or something...anyways...in my room it got really cold when
I was</B>
<BR><B>playing barbies and I didn't know why. I went into my closet to
get some</B>
<BR><B>more barbie stuff to set up my "house" and something tapped me on
the</B>
<BR><B>shoulder. I looked around and saw nothing. Then i saw a figure of
a young</B>
<BR><B>boy and that's when I saw a piece of paper. It was really weird
cause now I</B>
<BR><B>don't hear anything about a ghost communicating by paper. But on
this paper</B>
<BR><B>it said his name was Ben Porter. He was around the same age as me
but i</B>
<BR><B>can't remember what age he gave me...it was like 8 or something.
i asked if</B>
<BR><B>he wanted to play barbies with me and again i saw paper...it said
no. So i</B>
<BR><B>just went on with what I was doing and didn't really seem to care...but
as</B>
<BR><B>years went on i talked with him frequently. I don't know how i found
this</B>
<BR><B>out but one day i just woke up and knew how he had died. but i don't</B>
<BR><B>remember anything. i just know that his father had killed him with
a</B>
<BR><B>baseball bat or something. after that he kind of became something
that</B>
<BR><B>watched out for me but i don't believe he was my gardian angel.
when i was</B>
<BR><B>sad or something he was always there to comfort me and i only saw
him in my</B>
<BR><B>room. when i was 13 we moved to Plymouth Wisconsin and we had an
attic in</B>
<BR><B>this house and Ben followed us there. he stayed up in the attic
and i</B>
<BR><B>couldn't figure out why he didn't stay in my room like the other
house. but</B>
<BR><B>as time went on in the new house i realized that there was another
ghost</B>
<BR><B>occuping my room. she was an old lady who rocked in a rocking chair
in the</B>
<BR><B>corner of my room. she was a very sweet old lady and i would see
her figure</B>
<BR><B>often. Sometimes i would even wake to find my room rearranged, things</B>
<BR><B>missing, or my room cleaned up completely with everything put away
in the</B>
<BR><B>right spots. i went up to the attic one afternoon to ask ben why
he didn't</B>
<BR><B>stay in my room like he used to and again with paper...he said that
he</B>
<BR><B>didn't want to interfere with the lady in there. he said she needed
her</B>
<BR><B>space in the spirit world. i didn't quite understand that but i
let it be</B>
<BR><B>and i visited him in the attic. after a while the lady began humming
as i</B>
<BR><B>was falling asleep in bed at night...but only on the nights i had
trouble</B>
<BR><B>falling asleep or sleeping period. i felt as though she thought
i was her</B>
<BR><B>daughter and one night i thought i heard her say a girls name but
not</B>
<BR><B>mine...it was like kristy or something. I had friends sleep over
who said</B>
<BR><B>they would see figures moving about my house in the night if they
went to</B>
<BR><B>the bathroom. well months had passed and i started ignoring ben
more and to</B>
<BR><B>get back at me he would always turn off the upstairs bathroom light
on me.</B>
<BR><B>when i yelled for him to stop one morning when i was getting ready
for</B>
<BR><B>school he began turning it on and off constintly and then started
doing it</B>
<BR><B>to the rest of my family after that. he seems angry with me but
i didn't</B>
<BR><B>know what to do...one night i apologized and said that i would try
to talk</B>
<BR><B>to him more often. well we just moved into a new house still in
plymouth.</B>
<BR><B>ben didn't come this time...and i don't know where he is now. i
actually</B>
<BR><B>sort of miss him but now i don't have to worry about the lights
going out.</B>
<BR><B>but in my house now i feel as though i am watched by more than one
persons</B>
<BR><B>and one that isn't person at all. I feel as though the spirit of
my mom's</B>
<BR><B>cat Dustie is near all the time and follows me around the house.
When i am</B>
<BR><B>feeding the other cats it feels as though she is there waiting for
her food.</B>
<BR><B>my kitten cookee is really selfish and doesn't like to share her
food with</B>
<BR><B>the other cat so we have to have 2 bowls for each...well Soxs..our
other cat</B>
<BR><B>was on the other side of the room as cookee and that's when my kitten</B>
<BR><B>started to growl at something and she was trying to move her food
dish...i</B>
<BR><B>think that may have been dustie or something but it seemed odd to
me. i see</B>
<BR><B>Dustie every where i go sometimes too and i always dream of her.
one night i</B>
<BR><B>woke up in the middle of the night to a sound. my bed is positioned
across</B>
<BR><B>the room against the wall facing my closet door. when i opened my
eyes in</B>
<BR><B>the dark i saw my old cat Dustie standing in front of the closet
door. i was</B>
<BR><B>kind of spooked cause she had a look on her face like she wasn't
happy or</B>
<BR><B>something. the kind of look she got when Soxs made her mad before
she</B>
<BR><B>passed. i just thought to myself that she didn't approve of cookee
but she</B>
<BR><B>still loved us...i remember whispering in the dark "i love you dustie"
but</B>
<BR><B>nothing after that. as for the people...i see figures of people...black</B>
<BR><B>human figures of a short woman and a tall man. they seem to like

<BR><B>One of the owners of the B &amp; B was kind enough to pick up me
and my cousin from a restaurant and bring us back to the B &amp; B on our
last evening there. My cousin went to the kitchen to talk with the second
owner while I climbed the stairs to our bedroom. As I reached the top of
the stairs (our room was on the right and another bedroom to the left)
a young woman was standing with one hand on the doorknob of the partially
opened door to the left bedroom. The words popped into my mind She is
a 15 year old house maid and the owner said she and her husband did all
the work? She lied! The young woman had lovely creamy skin, dark eyes
and beautiful long, dark wavy hair hanging down her back. She also had
on a cap that was a circle of white cloth gathered by stitching 2 inches
from the edge and a long sleeved, long skirted high-necked plain black
dress. A painting of Martha Washington shows a similar cap and they date
about mid 1600-1800s. I smiled at the girl, said hello and went on into
our bedroom saying again to myself, Anna lied! I did not say anything
to my cousin.</B>
<BR><B>The next morning at the breakfast table again I asked the owner
if she hired any workers and again she said no.</B>
<BR><B>It was then that I knew I had seen a ghost as the bedroom was vacant.
I did not say what I had seen to anyone until late that evening when I
told the other owner. He did not make any comment but I received a strong
impression of be quiet.</B>
<BR><B>We left the next morning f or the seven and half hour train ride
back to Bristol, England and 2 days later flew back to our homes in the
USA</B>

<P><B>Reggie</B>

<P><B>By: amanda_trivett@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>Hi, here's is a story I thought your readers might like. It's not
scary, I actually think it's a very nice story.</B>
<BR><B>My mother is one of many - a typical Irish family -&nbsp; and grew
up in an old council house in Merseyside which is situated on the other
side of the River Mersey to Liverpool, England. At the time in question
she was the youngest child with so many older sisters and brothers, tended
to get a bit pushed out; wore all the hand-me-downs and was not allowed
to hang out with her older sisters. Her brother Reggie was much the same
and the two fought like cat and dog, but at the same time he would always
make time for 'little Shirley-Ann' and looked out for her.</B>
<BR><B>Reggie left one day as normal with his gang of friends, said goodbye
to my mum with a hair ruffle and a 'see you later our kid' and was never
to be seen again. He drowned in the Dee Estuary when he was eleven years
old.</B>
<BR><B>My mum and dad grew up a stones throw from each other and were dating
from school age (my Dad was West Kirby's first punk. My mum was - at the
time - a shy ginger wallflower before she became the firey Irish redhead
she is now, but it seemed to work for them) but from the very beginning
of their budding relationship my Dad had never been able to reach the upstairs
landing of my Mum's old house without feeling a sharp shove on his chest.
There was no threat in the shove, just an insistent reminder that he was
not welcome there. He never spoke of this to my Mum because she was still
very upset over Reggie's death and always would be, but he always felt
uncomfortable and unwelcome once he reached the top landing of that old
council house.</B>
<BR><B>On the day of their Wedding, he had to run back to the house to
collect a few bits and bobs and as he ran up the stairs (in his fly 70s
suit - I've seen the pictures. A work of art) he stopped dead on the top
of the landing. He says he felt the most intense feeling of pride and happiness
that it nearly dropped him. That the hands on his chest were no longer
threatening, but gentle and welcoming. Reggie had finally accepted 'Big
Triv' as having intentions that were honorable towards his sister and welcomed
him into the family. My dad says he cried like a big girl.</B>
<BR><B>I thought this was a nice story. My Mum has always been very sensitive
(stuff falls off the shelves when she's annoyed) and I've picked up a bit
of it. My Dad says, and I quote, that I was a 'F*cking weird kid' but it
appears to have worn off a bit now. My current house has a ghost but he's
cool, just randomly moves stuff about and appears in photos whether invited
or not. Its expected in a 100 year old house I suppose, the last guy died
in our living room and wasn't found for months (which our landlords take
pleasure in telling us from time to time)</B>
<BR><B>Anyway this is already too long and I'm on my lunchbreak so I best
go. If anyone wants to hear any other stories then by all means e-mail
me. Great site by the way. Keep up the good work.</B>

<P><B>THIS PLACE WAS BUILT I BELIEVE, IN 1918 BY A GERMAN GUY NAMED AGNEW,
AFTER THE ORIGINAL STRUCTURE WAS DESTROYED IN THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE OF 1912.
THIS FACILITY WAS CONTSRUCTED BY PEOPLE OF NAZI INFLUENCE. EVEN TO THIS
DAY YOU CAN STILL SEE SWASTIKAZ(I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SPELL THAT WORD)ENGRAVED
IN VARIOUS STRUCTURES THROUGHOUT THE GROUNDS. TO ME, THEY ARE NOTHING MORE
THAN SYMBALS THAT REPRESENT THE COUNTLESS ATROSITIES WHICH TOOK PLACE THERE.
THE POINT IS, I USED TO LIVE ON THESE GROUNDS AS A STATE WORKER. I AM TELLING
YOU THIS PLACE IS HAUNTED! I, AS WELL AS MY CO-WORKERS, WITHNESSED FIGURES
PASSING THROUGH HALLWAYS, THE SOUND OF FIENDISH LAUGHING AND SCREAMING
IN THE WALLS. ALSO, EXTREME COLD SPOTS, ESPECIALLY WHEN PASSING BY THIS
ONE ROOM WHERE THERE STILL SITS A LABOTOMY TABLE. I WORKED IN A CAFFATERIA
AS FOOD SERVICE WORKER AND WITNESSED FREEZER DOORS VIOLENTLY FLYING OPEN,
AS WELL, THE EJECTION OF IT'S CONTENTS.THE LADY WHO MANAGED THE PLACE TOLD
ME THAT SHE WAS THERE, ALONE AT 9:00PM ONE NIGHT DOING BOOK KEEPING TASK
IN THE OFFICE WHEN SUDDENLY ALL OF THE PAN THROWN FROM THEY'RE HANGING
HOOKS. THAT'S ALL IN ONE BUILDING! AFTER OBSERVING THESE CHILLING EVENTS,
I, AND A CO WORKER DECIDED TO EXPLORE THE REST OF THE BUILDINGS, AFTER
WORK ONE DAY. A DECISION, I STILL PARTIALLY REGRET. WHEN PASSING BY THIS
ONE BUILDING WE HEARD LOUD TALKING, ALMOST LIKE ARGUING. WE DECIDED TO
INVESTIGATE. ARMED WITH A THREE D CELL MAGLIGHT, WE PROCEDED UP THE EXTERNAL
STAIRWELL TO THE SECOND FLOOR. WHILE, WALKING UP IT GOT VERY COLD AND WE
HEARD A SCREAM. IT WAS PURE ADRENALINE WHICH GOT US TO THE TOP. WE THEN
WHERE OUTSIDE THE SECOND DECK DOOR WHICH HAD A LITTLE WINDOW. I FIRST LOOKED
THROUGH THE WINDOW WITHOUT AID OF MY FLAHLIGHT AND I COULD SEE CELL DOORS
SWINGINGALL THE WAY DOWN THIS HALLWAY. I WANTED TO SEE IT BETTER SO I SHINED
MY LIGHT THROUGH THE WINDOW. IN AN INSTANT ONE OF THE DOORS SWUNG OPEN
AND THERE WAS A SUDDEN BURST OF !LIGHT. WE RAN DOWN THE STAIRS SO FAST
THAT WE NEARLY BROKE OUR NECKS.</B>
<BR><B>WE HEADED BACK TOWARD OUR BERTHING WALKING BY OTHER BUILDINGS HEARING
EVERYTHING FROM LAUGHING TO WHAT SOUNDED LIKE A DOG BARKING BUT NO ONE
WAS AROUND. WHILE WALKING BACK WE WERE STOPPED A GROUNDS POLICE OFFICER
HE SAID THAT WE WEREN'T AUTHORIZED AROUND THE BUILDINGS. WE TRIED TO TELL
HIM ABOUT THE THINGS WE WITNESSED SO HE COULD GO MAKE SURE NOBODY WAS IN
THE BUILDINGS. HE RUDELY SAID THAT THEY'RE ALL LOCKED UP AND THAT NO ONE
COULD POSSIBILY GET IN. HE THEN STARTED TO ACCUSE US OF BEING ON DRUGS,
WHICH WAS NOT THE CASE. WE PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT HE NEW WE WERE RIGHT
AND WAS TOO FREAKED OUT TO INVESTIGATE. AFTER WORKING AT THIS FACILITY
FOR 6 MONTHS, I TRANSFERED TO THE MENTAL HOSITAL IN CAMARILLO. THE CAMARILLO
FACILITY STILL HELD PATIENTS AT THAT TIME. SO THAT WAS A WIERD ENOUGH EXPERIENCE
IN ITSELF. THERE ARE MORE INCIDENTS THAT I'VE EXPERIENCED. IF YOU WANT
TO KNOW MORE EMAIL ME BACK. I SWEAR ALL OF THESE STATEMENTS TRUE</B>

<P><B>The House I Grew up in</B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp; edwards4@surfglobal.net</B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>There was a house I grew up in that was over 200 years old in Hunlock
creek (now tore down) rr 157 Hunlock creek pa 18621 it was as haunted as
it gets with water shutting on and off ,(when you asked the ghost to turn
it of), strange things would always happen there like when my sister had
mono and had to sleep on the couch at night around Christmas time , we
would hang little Christmas balls up around the room and hang them from
the antlers of a deer that my father had mounted, in the morning they would
all be laying on the floor right next to the couch my sister slept in,
or maybe the time i was little and had bad asthma and was forced to sleep
with the window open, something woke me in the middle of the night and
i looked to the window(2nd floor) and saw a very pretty woman with a large
bun in her blond hair and a long flowing white gown shutting my window,
when she turned i pulled the covers over my head (and left them there)
the next morning my window was indeed shut and no one (alive)in the house
had shut it, then there was the time my brother broke his leg and we brought
his mattress downstairs for him to sleep on the floor with so he didn't
have to climb the 13 stairs to his room, one day we were all gone he was
lying on his mattress when our family dog started frantically barking and
running around and around his bed then he started hearing loud breathing
in his ear that would not leave him alone till he crawled on hands and
knees up stairs, also after my sister had her 1st child she still lived
at home, she was awakened one night to look out at the door entrance to
see a long flowing gown floating there with no body in it, this woman ghost
had also been seen looking out of an upstairs window when family members
were leaving the driveway, things would always be heard moving around downstairs
at night, musical mugs in the china cabinet would turn on at night for
no reason, and my father had a verbal meeting with this ghost one night
down the cellar the woman ghost told him to stop match making with a man
that he worked with and one of my mothers older friends she also told him
to not tell anyone that she spoke to him(he never told anyone but us several
long years later) but that it was very important that he stop there two
people from being together so my mom and dad kind of deterred them from
seeing each other and about a week later police came to where my father
worked and arrested the man that would have been "fixed up" it seems he
was on the run for the murder of his wife and children in another state,
it seems our&nbsp; friendly ghost" saved the older woman a lot of trouble,
the ghost also told my father other things but he refused to ever tell
us saying he would keep the promise he made to her, there were several
other happenings that always went on there (to many to remember) but for
the most part she seemed to watch over us, the only place that really ever
gave me a really bad feeling was our stair case and the cellar&nbsp; there
are 2 roads in Hunlock creek (some call pikes creek) called Hollawitch
road and Bearhollow road that on cold winter nights a woman in a light
old time summer dress walks beside the roads(dirt roads) and when you get
up along side of her she turns to look at you and then is gone, it is said
that a long time ago she was a new wife to an older farmer in the area
she was a lot younger than him and he was very cruel and mean to her she
met a younger man who fell in love with her and her husband caught them
together, after it is said that he beat her to death, cut her up in small
pieces and put her remains in a feed troth in their barn, I am not sure
what happened to her boyfriend, but who knows maybe the farmer killed him
also and buried his body somewhere else and this is what she is looking
for along these roads, all I do know is that a lot of people in this area
have seen her!</B>

<P><B>Experience from Florence</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>By: nutella42@snet.net</B>

<P><B>I lived and studied in Florence, Italy, on and off, from January
2001 until May 2003.&nbsp; During this time, I made some marvellous friends,
saw everything I had ever wanted to see concerning the Italian Renaissance
and had the occasion to live away from home and the dull university life.</B>
<BR><B>As mentioned above, I made some excellent new friends, some American
and some Italian, without whom this experience would have been unbelievably
difficult.&nbsp; One of the first people I met in Italy was one of my professors
at school, Nicoletta.&nbsp; She was a sweet, compassionate, loving and
charismatic individual who enjoyed mediating on the city buses and reading
philosophical works.&nbsp; As the term progressed and we became closer
friends, she told me about her difficulties with her right ear, which she
always kept covered by her dark hair.&nbsp; Back in 1989, she was diagnosed
with cancer in that ear.&nbsp; Towards the end of the term, she missed
a month of school due to severe illness and it was not until a few days
before I left Florence that she returned to school.&nbsp; After those couple
of days, Nicoletta returned home for the remainder of the summer term seeing
as she was so ill.</B>
<BR><B>When I returned home for a short time in the summer of 2001, we
kept in close contact via snail-mail (she was probably the most technologically
impaired person I have ever met).&nbsp; She explained more about her cancer,
which she tried to assure me everything was perfectly fine and there was
no cause to worry.</B>
<BR><B>I returned to Europe in September 2001 for school and often made
the fourteen-hour train ride from Paris to Florence to visit my friends.&nbsp;
Every time I visited, I made a particular point to see Nicoletta and make
sure that she was in good health.&nbsp; We spent a good deal of time together
on each trip and continued to get to know each other more and more.</B>
<BR><B>In June 2002, I returned home for a brief stay.&nbsp; A few weeks
later, one of my other friends and also an especially close friend to Nicoletta,
Isabella, e-mailed me to inform me that Nicoletta was seriously ill, not
attending school and refusing medical help (she liked to believe that doctors
((incompetenti)) knew absolutely nothing).&nbsp; Nearly 5,000 miles away
there was nothing that I could do but wait until my return to school in
September, when she was also due to come back.</B>
<BR><B>She did not return to school until October.&nbsp; When she did,
her face was horribly disfigured due to major surgery to remove her right
ear.&nbsp; It was painful to watch the person you love slip away like that
and refuse medical treatment.&nbsp; The last time I saw her, which happened
to be at the end of October, she was already completely gone and Nicoletta
was not the same person that I had known.&nbsp; The day after I saw her,
Isabella informed me that she only had, at most, three months left to live.</B>
<BR><B>Throughout the month of November, I tried to forget about Nicoletta,
and the possibility of not being able to say goodbye.&nbsp; I went on a
short break to the North and I attended classes as if nothing was wrong.&nbsp;
Towards mid-month, a friend and I went to a concert of one of my favourite
Italian bands, Tiromancino, and then the following evening we went up to
Fiesole for Indian food, something which I had never done despite all the
time I lived there.</B>
<BR><B>The following afternoon, I received a text message on my mobile
from Isabella notifying me that Nicoletta had passed away in her sleep
late Thursday evening.&nbsp; I do not really recall whether I was sad first,
then angry with her for not telling me immediately, but the following day
I discovered that Isabella attended the funeral the day she sent the text
message; I was not extended an invitation.</B>
<BR><B>I was so angry, denied my right to grieve over Nicoletta with her
friends and family that I had to take a week off from school to pull myself
together.&nbsp; I took lengthy train rides to local, yet hard-to-reach
areas in the middle of nowhere in Tuscany and Umbria, to try to forget
and understand what had happened.&nbsp; My flatmate even moved out during
this time so I could be alone in the apartment and cry myself to sleep.&nbsp;
One of these evenings as I lie in bed (sobbing), something that instinctively
felt like a hand was soothingly caressing my leg (I was turned onto my
side facing the wall) and this hand remained there until I fell asleep.</B>
<BR><B>Could it have been Nicoletta?&nbsp; I would like to believe that
she came to say goodbye to me; she always was a touchy-feely sort of person.&nbsp;
After that evening, I no longer felt the need to cry myself to sleep.&nbsp;
Then again, it could have been another entity in the house since it was
constructed in the 15th or 16th Century and seriously remodelled after
the 1966 flood.&nbsp; During my stay there, I never felt the presence of
anything other than that one night.</B>
<BR><B>Another interesting note to this story, Nicoletta died while I was
at the Tiromancino concert, her favourite group.&nbsp; The last time that
I saw her, she held up the CD I gave her before I left in 2001; she always
used it to teach students through song.&nbsp; I was wearing the t-shirt
from the concert when Isabella told me she had died two days prior.&nbsp;
Another strange incident was the Indian restaurant where I went with friends
the day after she died.&nbsp; Nicoletta loved with a passion, Indian food
(not necessarily a common trait amongst Italians) and always loved going
to there on special occasions.&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the only time I went
to there.</B>

<P><B>Possible Ghost</B>

<P><B>By: JHerkert@aol.com</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is John and last week I might have had
my first experience with a</B>
<BR><B>ghost. And if you do not mind, I would like to tell you about it.
First let</B>
<BR><B>me say that I have always been a believer, even with no personal
experiences.</B>
<BR><B>It just seems unlikely that thousands if not millions of people
who claim to</B>
<BR><B>see them are either wrong, or crazy or drunk or on drugs. I always
figured that</B>
<BR><B>there has to be some truth to some of it.</B>
<BR><B>I work at St. Claire's Hospital in Denville New Jersey. I had heard
of a</B>
<BR><B>spirit haunting the Pediatrics wing for a while. One night I was
talking to one of</B>
<BR><B>the respiratory therapists and she swears that she saw a shadow
of a full</B>
<BR><B>grown man behind the patrician that divides the beds. She claims
that she</B>
<BR><B>apparition walked through the wall.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, back to my story. Last week Pediatrics was closed. Not because
of any</B>
<BR><B>strange doings, there were just no children admitted to the hospital.
So the</B>
<BR><B>charge nurse in the floor I was working on asked me to goto Pediatrics
and get</B>
<BR><B>whatever juice and milk was left there. She also asked me to check
the rooms</B>
<BR><B>and make sure all the lights were off. No use wasting electricity,
right? So</B>
<BR><B>I go down there and get the juice and milk and put it out in the
hall leading</B>
<BR><B>away from the wing. Then I head back to turn off the lights. In
one of the</B>
<BR><B>rooms the patrician was moving back and forth, like there was a
breeze on it. I</B>
<BR><B>assumed that someone left the air condition on. As I walked past
the patrician,</B>
<BR><B>to get to the radiator, which was on the far side of the room right
by the</B>
<BR><B>window, the patrician stopped moving. I stopped in my tracks and
realized the</B>
<BR><B>air was in fact NOT on. I get out of the room as quickly as I can
because I was</B>
<BR><B>pretty freaked, and as I am about half way down the hall. Every
call light in</B>
<BR><B>Pediatrics goes off at once despite the fact that the rooms were
empty.</B>
<BR><B>However they did not go off in unison. The Pediatrics wing was filled
with bells</B>
<BR><B>going off at different times. I got real nervous then and left as
fast as I could.</B>
<BR><B>I would like to state that throughout it all I did not feel any
type of a</B>
<BR><B>presence.</B>
<BR><B>This leads me to another part of my story. Up on the fourth floor
we have had</B>
<BR><B>a running joke about there being a ghost up there. Whenever someone
presses</B>
<BR><B>the call bell in their room there are 2 phones on the unit that
have an LED</B>
<BR><B>readout and it says what room is in need of help. Since it's on
the 4th floor,</B>
<BR><B>all the rooms begin with a 4. Rooms 402, 404, etc. During the night
shift, about</B>
<BR><B>3 -5 times a night, the phone will go off at the nurses station
and it will</B>
<BR><B>say room 505. There is no 505 in the Hospital, nor has there ever
been. My</B>
<BR><B>experience in the Pediatrics wing kind of leads me to believe that
it's possible</B>
<BR><B>that there really is a spirit there.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, going through this led me to do a web search on Ghosts and
lead me to</B>
<BR><B>your site, which I really enjoy by the way. I have been having a
difficult</B>
<BR><B>time registering though. I fill out the forum and it says that I
should get a</B>
<BR><B>confirmation E-mail. I never did and I tried registering twice.
Any suggestions?</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, that's my story. Thanks for letting me tell it. If you have
any</B>
<BR><B>questions, please ask away.</B>

<P><B>Possible Ghost Siting</B>

<P><B>By: takeitback@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>I thought I might tell you about something i saw on a recent holiday
to the</B>
<BR><B>UK.&nbsp; I am from Australia, and was holidaying with my mother
in the UK last</B>
<BR><B>October.&nbsp; We arrived at the airport in Dublin, and after collecting
our</B>
<BR><B>luggage, picked up our hire car and drove out of the city in search
of a B &amp;</B>
<BR><B>B for the night as it was about 9pm at this stage.&nbsp; I was navigating
and</B>
<BR><B>thought we were heading in the same direction as we wanted to head
the next</B>
<BR><B>morning, but as it turned out we were not.&nbsp; We ended up on
a dimly lit road</B>
<BR><B>which I doubt was wide enough for 2 cars to pass.&nbsp; There were
tall buches on</B>
<BR><B>the right side of the road, and trees on the left.&nbsp; About 100
meters ahead I</B>
<BR><B>saw a man and a woman standing, half hidden by the trees.&nbsp;
I immediately</B>
<BR><B>became alarmed, thinking they were going to jump out in front of
the car and</B>
<BR><B>rob us ( I am a little paranoid like that I guess), so I straight
away said</B>
<BR><B>to my mother, who was driving "watch out for those 2 people standing
there".</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Her reply was "what two people?".&nbsp; I realised then she
hadn't seen them,</B>
<BR><B>and didn't reply to her question, but stared at these two people.&nbsp;
The man</B>
<BR><B>was behind the woman with his arm around her, wearing a suit with
a long</B>
<BR><B>tailed jacked, the woman was wearing a long flowing skirt with a
white apron</B>
<BR><B>around her waist.&nbsp; This struck me as odd, but because we'd
only just arrived</B>
<BR><B>in Ireland i didn't know if it was just the way people still dressed
over</B>
<BR><B>there in some areas.&nbsp; I didn't take my eyes off them and when
we were about</B>
<BR><B>10 meters away from them, they faded and disappeared.&nbsp; My mother
was</B>
<BR><B>laughing at me about ho I was seeing things, as I'd been quiet ever
since</B>
<BR><B>she said she hadn't seen the people, and I got a bit worked up because
she</B>
<BR><B>was laughing and told her details of what I'd just seen, and then
she</B>
<BR><B>believed me.&nbsp; The worst part was, because we were headed in
the wrong</B>
<BR><B>direction, we had to turn around and go back past the spot I saw
them, but</B>
<BR><B>nothing else occured.</B>
<BR><B>This is the only encounter I've had with anything strange, and I'm
not sure</B>
<BR><B>what exactly it was.</B>

<BR><B>Grandpa Comes To Visit</B>

<P><B>By: LaLunadeLuna@aol.com</B>

<P><B>I have been a sensitive since birth I believe.&nbsp; I try never
to use my gift because&nbsp; I must admit that even at forty years of age
it still unnerves me.&nbsp; My eighteen year old son has also inherited
this "gift."&nbsp;&nbsp; We live in Garfield, New Jersey.</B>
<BR><B>My Story begins a few weeks after my sons paternal grandfather died
in the September of 1999.&nbsp;&nbsp; My son and I were in the kitchen
preparing dinner together.&nbsp; My bedroom is off the kitchen but facing
in a way that when standing at the stove your back is facing to the door
of my bedroom.&nbsp; I was frying French fries so we closed the door so
grease smell would not go in my bedroom.&nbsp; My son and I were joking
as we cooked and were laughing so hard while trying to put dinner on the
table.&nbsp; I asked my son to please get something from the fridge.&nbsp;
Just then as he turned around, I turned to make sure he was going directly
to the fridge to get what I asked for.&nbsp; In a split second I saw that
my bedroom door was on a crack and the face of my sons paternal grandfather
was looking at us with a huge smile on his face.&nbsp; My son looked at
me, I looked at my son and he said to me "Mom did you just see anything"?&nbsp;
I said no because I did not want to scare him but asked him what he saw.&nbsp;
He said Grandpa P was just here smiling at us looking out of the crack
of the bedroom door.&nbsp; My jaw dropped because I realized then beyond
a shadow of a doubt that my son also had the "gift."&nbsp; I did not tell
him I saw his grandfather until many weeks later.&nbsp; But at the instant
he told me what he saw and what I knew I had seen myself were one and the
same.&nbsp; I would also like to note....My ex father-in-law had never
been to the house that this took place.</B>

<P><B>Grandpa's Car</B>

<P><B>By: LaLunadeLuna@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>This story begins back around 1970 in a place called Brick Twsp.New
Jersey.&nbsp; I was about Seven years old then.&nbsp; We had a Apartment
in the city and this was our "summer" home.&nbsp; My grandfather had purchased
the summer house back in 1963 just after I was born.&nbsp; Before my grandfather
died he and my grand mother used to take me with there even in the winter
for weekends.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My grandfather was a very dapper man always
in a suit and tie with wing tips.&nbsp; As I remember his most beloved
possessions were his1957 mint green Pontiac Star Chief and this summer
house.&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember so well his car and the sound of the motor.&nbsp;
The car&nbsp; had such a big power full sounding engine that it was a distinct
sound in my mind.&nbsp; Having heard the car come down the gravel road
so many times I would know that sound anywhere. The house as it were, was
not much of a house, more like a winterized converterd bungalow.&nbsp;
It consisted of just two tiny bedrooms, a small kitchen, bathroom, livingroom
and a sun porch.&nbsp; It was the last house on a dead end of a gravel
road which ended in woods for miles.&nbsp; It was though our summer place
to me, my brother, Mom and Dad as well as my maternal aunt, her two daughters,
her husband and of course my grandmother and grandfather (before 1970).&nbsp;
We were a tight fit for sleep arrangements but it was always fun when we
were there. As we grew up the girls always got the left bedroom off the
hall so my two cousins and I slept together.&nbsp; My grand and the rest
of the family were scatter though out the house on cots or couches.&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the time before we used air conditioners there we slept summer nights
with all the windows open.&nbsp; One night I was sun burnned and sleeping
poorly I could not get up out of the bed because other people were sleeping
so I laid there thinking, dozing on and off.&nbsp;&nbsp; All of a sudden
I hear the sound of a car turning into our street.&nbsp; Down the road
the car drove with the gravel crunching beneath the tires.&nbsp; The car
came to the end of the road and hung a left into the driveway.&nbsp; (which
at the time was full with two cars of the living)&nbsp;&nbsp; The car stopped
and I heard two doors slam shut and walking up the back steps and into
the house into the kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp; The chairs in the kitchen scrapped
across the floor as they were pulled out from the table and I suppose they
sat down.&nbsp; I heard mumbles of conversations but could not make out
the words.&nbsp; I prayed myself to sleep that night with the covers over
my head.&nbsp; For many years I had heard the same distinct sound of the
ghost car up the gravel road&nbsp; pulling into the drive way, the doors
closing and people coming into the kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Myself being young
and very unknowing of my "gift" I was scared to tell anyone about the sound
of the car coming up the road.&nbsp; As I got older I went there less and
less with the family and finally when I was twenty one they sold the house.&nbsp;
Sitting at the kitchen table my family and I used to talk about the fun
we had there.&nbsp; One time I got up the nerve to tell them why I hated
to go there as I got older.&nbsp; I told them that I used to hear strange
things in the night.&nbsp; My maternal Auntie got a smirk on her face a
mile wide.&nbsp; My two cousins looked at each other and I said what is
wrong?&nbsp; They said oh so you heard it too?&nbsp; I said I heard what?&nbsp;
They said oh just grandpas car driving up the street and pulling into the
driveway.&nbsp; Then he came in the house.&nbsp;&nbsp; Needless to say
we had all heard the car but no one said anything until we were about twelve
years older.&nbsp; It was a big relief to hear that they also heard it.&nbsp;
I was thinking all those years I was crazy.&nbsp; :)</B>

<P><B>Meriden</B>

<P><B>By: waite1116@cox.net</B>

<P><B>I used to live&nbsp; in Meriden. After me and my family moved out
some people had gone to look at the house. The family was browsing through
the house when the mother noticed her son was missing. So she walked upstairs
and heard her son's voice coming from my old room and she found her son
in the closet talking to himself. She opened the door and asked her son
who he was talking to. He said "I was just talking to Sonny." So i guess
the family got suspicious, and called City Hall. City Hall had checked
their records and found out that someone had been murdered in the house
way back in 1895 when it was first built. We got a call from the police
telling us about this story about a month after we moved out, and i thought
about it. At night, i always used to hear strange things like stuff being
moved around and faint voices coming from my closet.</B>

<BR><B>A Couple of my Families Ghosts</B>

<P><B>By: spittfire1@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;Here is one of our many experiences:</B>
<BR><B>In my family, it is no secret that we believe in ghosts.&nbsp; Almost
every person in my maternal family has had some dealing, in some way, with
a spirit or two during a rough time in their lives.&nbsp; The particular
story that comes to mind is one of my grandmother s, all though I, too,
was a witness.&nbsp; My great-grand mother was in perfect health the day
that she had her car accident.&nbsp; She was leaving Colquitt Memorial,
she was visiting a friend, when she was struck in the driver s side door
by a speeding and reckless driver. She went right back to Colquitt Memorial,
and being the kind of woman she was, she laughed through the pain and told
the nurses that she had just left from there.&nbsp; It wasn t long however,
before the concussion caught up with her and she passed into a coma. My
Gran and I spent a fitful night in her room and was awaken at 8:22 am by
my great-Gran s mumbling. From what I could understand, she was saying&nbsp;
All right Ray, I ll be there soon . A couple of minutes later, we got a
call from a friend down stairs saying that my uncle Ray (my great-Gran
s son) was being brought in to the emergency room, heart attack. He had
died at home with no recessitation during the drive in. Time of death:
8:25 am. Two days later we held his funeral.&nbsp; At the funeral, a few
of his co-workers showed up with the wildest story. It seemed that my uncle
had made a final trip to work the morning of his interment. The forklift
that he always drove crunk up by itself and slowly made it s way across
the lumberyard in a final farewell.&nbsp; Shortly after, my great- Gran
s condition worsened. I woke up that night, at home, to go to the bathroom.
As I was walking back across the hall I distinctly heard my great-Gran
telling my Gran that every thing would be all right and that she would
always be with her.&nbsp; Before I could get to my Gran s room, the phone
was ringing. It was the hospital calling to tell us that great- Gran had
passed.</B>

<P><B>A Scared Ghost</B>

<P><B>By: marzwolf@earthlink.net</B>

<P><B>This happened when I lived in Washington state.&nbsp; I was about
16 years old at the time and me and a friend of mine were invited to go
stay the night at my older brothers house in Bremerton, which was down
in some old apartments that he decided to rent because he had a good view
of the bay, and the price was right.&nbsp; It use to be called the old
Navy city area.&nbsp; Anyway, we were suppose to be going to the beach
the next day as my brother had the day off.&nbsp; He told me that he would
be going to pick up his check the following morning early and asked if
I would be kind enough to fix him some breakfast if he woke me up, and
I said yes of course, because I didnt want the poor guy to burn down the
house.&nbsp; Well to start off with, when I first walked into the house,
the hair stood up on the back of my neck as well as on my arms.&nbsp; I
felt just like someone had been murdered in the house and I went as far
as saying so.&nbsp; When hearing what I had to say, my brother took me
to his bedroom and asked if I felt anything in there.&nbsp; I did, and
it was a feeling of sadness and dread.&nbsp; (Im a Licensed Psychic by
the way, and now 30 years old.)&nbsp; My brother told me that he never
had slept in that room and that he always slept on the couch because he
felt something awful in there too.&nbsp; Well, because I had a friend with
me, we decided to sleep in the room that night because there was the two
of us.&nbsp; There was a lamp on a table right next to the bed that I was
sleeping in that night, and I shut it off and went to sleep.&nbsp; The
next thing that happened was that I was being shaken awake and there was
a brightness in the room as though someone had turned that lamp on, but
when I opened my eyes, thinking that it was my brother waking me up to
fix him breakfast, boy did I get the shock of my life.&nbsp; Sitting on
the bed side, still shaken me frantically and looking over her shoulder,
was a woman with nothing but a light for a face.&nbsp; Her face was just
like looking into a big light bulb, only more radiant.&nbsp; As soon as
she discovered that she had awaken me, she very sacredly let go of me as
if she had offended me or as if she didnt mean to be rude, and she again
franticlly looked over her shoulder as if she were being chased by some
monster or something and then she turned and ran and then vanished.&nbsp;
I noted that she had long strawberry blonde hair, stood about 5ft 4, She
had a yellow T-shirt on with one of the sleeves ripped, and blue-jeans
on.&nbsp; I honestly to this day, believe that she woke me up to let me
know that I was right about my feelings of someone being murdered and that,
that someone was her.&nbsp; Truly I was touched by her communication with
me as I felt like she put her trust in me, but at the same time it scared
the sh_t out of me.&nbsp; That was the night that I learned that ghosts
can touch you solidly, and it feels just like a normal living breathing
human being.&nbsp; I cant remember if I were cold, as I was too busy freaking
out on her existence.&nbsp; I honestly have had many experiences with ghosts,
since about the age of four but this is one that touched my heart, if you
can understand that.</B>

<BR><B>Boone Hutcheson cemetery</B>

<P><B>By: Ashley Hilburn</B>

<P><B>Hi.&nbsp; I am fairly new to this site and I became very interested
when I read that this site is for real people with real experiences.&nbsp;
I have a real experience to share with whoever will listen.&nbsp; It all
happened in the spring of 2001.&nbsp; At the time I was living in Greencastle
Indiana.&nbsp; My cousins and I were out looking for something to do when
someone suggested ghost hunting.&nbsp; There is an old cemetery located
in Greencastle called Boone Hutcheson Cemetery and has been in existence
since sometime in the 1800's.&nbsp; The legend goes as follows....A ghostly
police officer from the 1950's sits inside the graveyard along with a blue
light.&nbsp; There is also a cave under the cemetery with a grave near
the entrance.&nbsp; People have reported seeing a strange figure standing
in the cave when going in.&nbsp; Some witnesses have even reported that
bodies will fall out of their caskets into the cave (which is absoultly
true).&nbsp; One other occurrence involves sinister looking dogs with red
glowing eyes that chase people to their cars, then dissappear.&nbsp; This
is only half of the legend of the dog with the glowing eyes.&nbsp; There
is also an evil woman who owns the dog and unleashes him on trespassers
when the police officer is asleep.&nbsp; If you happen to venture out to
the cemetery and you see a blue light then you are safe.&nbsp; If not then
the evil woman is out and about.&nbsp; There is also a legend of an old
Indian burial ground located behind Boone Hutcheson in the woods but this
I cannot confirm.&nbsp; However, I can confirm the blue light and the dog
with glowing red eyes.&nbsp; Let me return the night in Spring of 2001.&nbsp;
My cousin's and I decided to head out to Boone Hutch.&nbsp; My cousin's
had never even heard of it before and i warned them that it really was
haunted and that strange and bad things could happen there.&nbsp; Well,
of course, they weren't believers.&nbsp; We had two seperate cars and we
got to the cemetery about 1:00 in the morning.&nbsp; We never shut the
cars off or turned off the lights.&nbsp; We drove up the hill (the cemetery
itself lays ontop of a hill and there is only one way in and one way out
and it has a circular drive) and went around the circular drive once and
then parked both cars on the downgrade of the hill going out of the cemetery.&nbsp;
There were two of my cousin's in the car with me and then another cousin
of mine and his wife in the other car which was parked behind mine.&nbsp;
Myself and my two cousin's that were in the car with me got out and we
went over to the other car.&nbsp; My video camera was in the back window
of the second car and when we all started discussing what to do next we
all heard a jingling sound that sounded like a bell on a cat's collar and
then the wind picked up out of nowhere and we all distinctly heard a man's
voice tell us to "get out".&nbsp; Needless to say the three of us that
were out of the car went running back to the first car so we could get
out of there.&nbsp; When we reached the car and got in, the radio had a
sound going through it and it sounded like electricity.&nbsp; It went all
through the car and then just ended.&nbsp; Well, I had had enough and we
took off out of there.&nbsp; My cousin Megan who was in the back seat of
my car started screaming that her back was fire and that we had to stop
and she had to get out of the car.&nbsp; When I thought we had a good enough
distance between us and the cemetery I stopped the car and my cousin that
was sitting up front in the passenger's got out with me and we had to pull
my cousin Megan from the backseat.&nbsp; At this point I was shaking and
scared to death.&nbsp; We lifted up Megan's shirt to see what was wrong
with her and she had what looked like claw marks on her back.&nbsp; And
I don't mean just one or two.&nbsp; They were all over her back.&nbsp;
And they were so bad that she was bleeding.&nbsp; We all got back into
the car and went back to my place.&nbsp; When we all got inside and settled
down somewhat, my cousin and his wife (that had been in the second car)
told us that the blue light followed them down the hill and out of the
cemetery.&nbsp; I didn't take any pictures of my cousin Megan's back although
I should have but I did get my video camera out and I got it on tape.&nbsp;
I still have the tape today if you would like for me to send you a copy.&nbsp;
The really weird aspect about the whole thing is that when we all started
to look at Megan's back in good lighting, we could see that the claw marks
strongly resembled M's.&nbsp; We don't know for sure what that meant, but
I suspect that it was the inital for her first name although I can't know
what it was meant for.&nbsp; That is my strange story about Boone Hutcheson
cemetery.&nbsp; There are many other accounts that I could include that
I have heard from other people.&nbsp; One more thing that I would like
to add here, and if it has any kind of relevence to this story I don't
really know, but I thought you may find it interesting.&nbsp; My husband
has family buried out there at Boone Hutch.&nbsp; Maybe that is why I didn't
get hurt that night?????&nbsp; Thanks for hearing me out.....have a great
day!!!!!</B>

<P><B>BAD</B>

<P><B>By: RvLy8@aol.com</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>This happened to me around the time I was 7 years old. My house used
to be an old girl scout camp and there was another house on that property
where the girl scouts did arts and crafts, and other stuff. We now call
that place the lodge. My sister and some of her friends desided to have
a Halloween party ,well I was trick-or-treating at my cousins house, at
the lodge. It was getting closer to Halloween so they were starting to
put out all of the decorations, but my sister and her friend ran out of
tape so they went up to my house to get some more.(they were the only ones
there!!) When the came back there was large lettering on the wall that
said "BAD!!!" that hadn't been there before. So they jus covered it with
a banner that said "Happy Halloween". My sister told me that the party
was great, but soon after my 4 year-old black lab, great dane mix had gotten
hit by a car speeding down the street at about 12:00am. She lived, but
suffered a leg injury. To this day she is still living. She is 6 or 7 years
old now, but continues to act like a puppy. Once I was wondering in the
woods on the property I lived on and I got lost. I was probably only 6
or 7 and I started to cry badly. So I yelled out "MORGAN HELP ME"(morgan
is her name) and soon after I heard the sound of leaves crackling and twigs
breaking. It sounded like more than one animal. Now I was crying harder
than I ever had. Since we did have coyotes living there. It was coming
closer. Soon I saw a black dog figure and a brownish dog figure. So I stopped
crying and called out "MORGAN!!" and then the crackling and twigs started
coming closer at faster speed and it turned out to be Morgan and the dog
who lived across the street and that fathered her puppies. They lead my
home and I have loved them more than ever since.</B>

<BR><B>Battlefield Ghost</B>

<P><B>By: lynnlamb@msn.com</B>

<P><B>I would like to tell you the story of what happened to me and a friend
of mine a few years ago.</B>
<BR><B>I am a Civil War re-enactor and had gone to a re-enactment of the
battle of Resaca Georgia in May of 1995. The re-enactment was being held
on the actual battlefield north of Atlanta, I can't remember if it was
the actual aniversary of the battle or not but it was at least the closest
weekend to the aniversary of the battle. We were camped on a small hillside
in the woods on the battlefield and we had camped further up the hill than
any of the other re-enactors. There were probably 2000 or so other re-enactors
camped on other parts of the field, as I said we were camped on the hillside
above the other re-enactors and sometime late that night I decided I would
go to bed, our re-enacting group did not pitch tents that night so we had
just laid our blankets on the ground. As soon as I had laid down and rolled
over to go to sleep it sounded like someone said my name right in my ear,
I turned to see who it was and there was no one there. I thought it was
just my imagination and didnt think anymore about it, but I had trouble
trying to go to sleep that night I could hear the other re-enactors below
us talking and laughing so I just laid there hoping I would go to sleep.
Sometime in the next couple of hours everyone else must have decided to
go to sleep because I could not hear any more talking but it wasn't long
before it sounded like someone walking around our camp just out the the
fire light, it would sound like they would walk to just outside our fire
light then stop and then they would walk away from our camp and then come
in from another side to just outside our fire light. Whoever or whatever
it was did this several times, I started to think that someone may have
been up to no good by trying to slip into camp and steal something, most
of our guys had leaned there guns up against trees and had gone to sleep.
I got up once and put another log on the fire just to let whoever know
that there was someone awake and maybe they would go away, but I just kept
hearing someone circle our camp. Finally I decided to get someone else
awake and let them know what I thought was going on.</B>
<BR><B>I woke up one of the other guys and told him someone was messing
around our camp, he asked what did I think they wanted. I told him I was
afraid that they would steal something, just about the time I said that
up the hill from where we were at I saw a small light going up the hill
at an angle away from us. I thought it was someone carrying a small light,
I told the other guy look there goes someone up the hill, he turned around
and called out. What do you want? It started down the hill toward us and
I kept expecting someone to step into the fire light but no one did it
was just a light. It came to just between the two of us and we were no
more than 3 feet apart and it just floated there. We did not say anything
we just sat there and looked at it and looked at each other for at least
15 seconds when finally it went back up the hill from where it had came
and we watched it untill it went out of site into the woods. Just about
the time the thing dissapeared into the wood one of the other guys got
up and wanted to know what was going on, we told him the story and his
response was ' I'm telling you I've been feeling it all night there are
ghosts out here'. Untill he said that that thought had never entered my
mind, I hate to admit it but I got just a little bit more than scared,
the other two guys went back to sleep but I couln't I must have sat up
a couple more hours before I could go to sleep. The next morning I got
up and felt pretty silly about being scared the night before and I thought
that I would really be teased by everyone about being scared so I thouhgt
I'll get this over and started over to where the one who had seen it with
me. He was standing with several of the others, I walked up to him and
didn't say anything I just looked at him. Finally he said. What was that
last night? I said I dont know. He said I think it was a lightning bug.
I said there were no lightning bugs out last night. He said I still think
it was a lightning bug. But I said. How many lightning bugs have you had
come to you when you called out to them? He said yeah that was kind of
weird. Sorry about this being so long but I just felt that it wouldn't
do any good to leave out anything</B>

<BR><B>Californian Ghosts</B>

<P><B>By: Hj_shortie@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>I am originally from a small city in southern California, but three
years ago I moved to Idaho to reunite with my soon-to-be husband and start
a family. Before coming to Idaho, I was living in the home of my father
and step-mother. I was sitting on the couch in their living room watching
Jerry Springer one night. After awhile I turned off the T.V. to get some
sleep. At this point, everyone else in the house was already asleep. About
to fall into a slumber I started hearing noises. First they sounded like
feet dragging across the carpet, just this heavy rubbing sound. It seemed
as though it was coming nearer and nearer towards the couch where I was
hiding beneath a blanket. That wasn't all. There is a hallway that leads
out of the living room. Not a very long one. On one side there are two
bedrooms, one belonging to my parents and the other to my younger brother
Danny. On the other side is a bathroom and closet. From my point of view
sitting on the couch, I could see the bathroom in which the door was wide
open. Suddenly I heard a faint water dripping in the sink. Though it was
faint it was quite distinctive and I realized that it had not been doing
so earlier. Then I heard a small creaking noise. It sounded like a cupboard
closing and opening repeatedly in the bathroom. At this point I was very
terrified and I didn't know what to do. So I did the most typical thing.
Counted to three and ran for my parents room. I came in and asked my step-mother
if I could sleep on the floor. With no questioning she oblidged and made
me a bed next to theirs. Towards the end of their bed, not to mention even
closer to where my feet lay, was another bathroom that connected to their
bedroom. I heard the same noises. The water dripping and the cupboard creaking.
But there was no sign of the carpet noises. With my parents beside me I
felt more comfort and to my relief, fell asleep. The next morning, I wanted
to tell someone about my experience because I couldn't keep it to myself.
I figured telling me father might anger him and he probably wouldn't believe
me anyways so I told my step-mother. The reason I tell you this story is
because of her response. She told not to worry and that I was not the only
one to hear these noises, but she had heard them before as well. I liked
to call this experience the beginning.</B>
<BR><B>After this I requested to sleep in a small trailer outside in our
backyard. For some reason and I cannot recall now, I thought I would be
more safe this way. So I did. So it has been quite awhile since that last
experience. One night, once again watching Jerry Springe, I wanted a little
snack. Everyone was asleep again so I decided to sneak in the house and
grap a Pepsi and a chocolate Ding Dong snack. The glory of this was us
"children" were not allowed to eat the Ding Dongs or drink the Pepsi's
This was because they were my fathers and they belonged to him. It was
just a house rule. So I crept into the house and into the kitchen. I opened
the refridgerator and took out a Pepsi and set it on the counter and went
to open the pantry to get a Ding Dong and I heard my father's loud strong
voice say my full name. I was still half way in the pantry and my back
was to where he would be standing. At this point, ghosts and what-not had
not even crossed my mind. Instead I was just picturing my punishment while
thinking to myself 'Oh crap, I'm in trouble. Without even turning around
I closed the pantry and put the soda back in the fridge. Then I turned
around expecting to see him standing in the doorway. Nobody was there.
I started getting a little freaked out so I started turning on every light
as I made my way through the living room to the hallway. Still, nobody
was there. I looked into my brother's room to see him in a deep sleep.
So I checked my father's room and both him and my step-mom were asleep.
I would have thought of it as a prank and gone in to double check, but
I knew if he really had been awake he would have said something about my
sneaking.</B>
<BR><B>So here I am a year later, pregnant with my first child and I am
sleeping over at a friends home. At the end of their hallway hangs a portrait
painted in blood by a man who died. That man who died was my friends father.
I can't recall the past history of that portrait other than that. All other
pictures of him are put away in boxes and stored in the garage to break
off painful memories. I was to sleep on the couch that night. I assume
that most of you readers have had a small experience of your own. Sometimes
you may not see or hear anything but you can just feel the presence and
you know they are right next to you. Well this was one of those times.
It didn't frighten me though because I knew who it was. I felt the cushion
at the bottom of the couch sink beneath my feet. I didn't move or runaway.
I didn't feel threatened, I actually felt comforted.</B>
<BR><B>So that was before I moved up to Idaho three years ago. This was
really no mental case that needed therapy or anything. It was just some
harmless experiences. So after they stopped happening for awhile after
the move, I stopped thinking of them. So almost two years go by and I am
blessed with my second child. On this day my first son is playing on the
computer in the living room while my new daughter is sound asleep in her
playpen in the living room as well. I am in their bedroom cleaning out
the closet. My son sleeps on the top bunk of a his bunk bed because the
bottom is practically decorated with stuffed animals of all sorts. They
are all neatly set up and positioned. With my back to the bed and my head
in the closet I hear one of the toys begin talking. I know it is a toy
because I recognize the voice. I heard the words "Are you done playing
with me yet?" It startled me because I know this particular parrot toy
is not programmed to say that. At first I thought I was hearing things
and all this cleaning was giving me a head rush. So I continue. Then I
hear "I'm talking to you." So now I begin to wonder. I picked up the parrot
toy and look at the power switch which is set to 'Off'. I turn it on and
it gives it's usual introduction. I turn it off and it says what it should.
I knew what I had heard. So I threatened it to leave and never come back.
It never happened again.</B>
<BR><B>I would say my troubles are over except for one last recent experience.
My fiance, children and I are all eating dinner. My fiance and I at the
coffee table in the living room, my son at the kitchen table, and daughter
in her high-chair. All of a sudden the lights completely go out. It wasn't
all the power because the T.V. and other appliances remained on. The only
other reason to believe it wasn't a regular power problem was because of
the odd pattern they continued to go on and off in. For about 5 seconds
was all it lasted. That same night when the children were both asleep,
my fiance and I were watching T.V. late that night and we heard something
fall in our bedroom at the end of the hallway. We heard a couple of crashing
noises. When we went into the bedroom to look, nothing was laying on the
floor or misplaced. Our first suspicion would have been our animals but
our dog was outside and boht of our cats were in the living room with us.
We don't know what had fallen or what exactly we had experienced.</B>

<P><B>By: DrEaMyChIcA69411@aol.com</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>First one happened to my aunt Linda while she and my uncle were visiting
his parents. She was unpacking her bags alone in the room her and my uncle
would be in for the vacation and all the sudden a lady appeared and she
was dressed in a pink night gown. my aunt scared ran into the kitchen and
imeadatly told my uncle and his parents about it. And they then told her
that the color of the night gown the ghost was wearing was the same color
that my uncles grandmother was buried in. and my next story was told to
me by my great aunt. I was recently visiting her in her home in Alabama
with my aunt and father. a month before our visit my great aunts husband
had died and she was sharing what happened to her that day. Well, she said
everyday after breakfast JD (her husband) would go lay down and take a
nap. Well, he got up like usual and cleaned his plate but he went up to
her and said "well honey IM gonna lay down I need my rest I love you" and
she expecting nothing said "well you do every morning" and he kept saying
well IM tired. He then gave her a kiss and walked into the bedroom which
is in view of the dining room. Like 30 min. later she said she saw her
father (who is dead) and he just looked at her. And she kept asking "Daddy?
Daddy what are you doing here" and he just turned around and went into
the room that my great uncle was sleeping in. She the just thought nothing
of it and later in the day someone stopped by to see my great uncle and
she went in there and he wouldn't wake up she then discovered that he had
died in his sleep. she now thinks that</B>
<BR><B>her father had come to take JD with him to heaven. But that's all
the stories that were told to me now IM going to tell u my experiences.</B>
<BR><B>First was when my older sister, my mother, and me lived in a small
duplex. I was about in the 2nd grade then and I slept in my moms room with
her b/c it was a two bedroom duplex. I was woken up every night by a white
figure at the end of my bed. I kept telling my Mom about this b/c being
a 6 year old I was frigtened. then one day my sister didn't pick me up
from school like she was told to do by my Mom and so I decided to walk
home b/c the school was only a block away from home. Once I got home I
called me my and told her I had made it home and she asked me to check
the mailbox. So I got off the phone with her and ran outside (no I swear
I left that door open) on my way back I&nbsp; going into the house I tried
to open the door and it was locked. Now I could be mistaken about leaving
the door open but there is no way it could have been locked b/c I had unlocked
it on my way in it when I got back from school. I later found out that
our land lords son had lived in that house and died in a car accident.
Which is weird but my sightings with a ghost at the end of my bed didn't
end there we moved into an apartment which I kept seeing the same thing
every night. But after that I never have seen it since. But every now and
then today I will wake up face down on my bed feeling like I cant move.
like IM paralyzed I don't know how to explain it. But I have one more thing
to tell you</B>
<BR><B>This all happened after my grandma died about two years a go. Well,
one night my sister called at two am crying hysterically saying she had
a dream grandma was saying she was OK now and then my grandma gave her
a hug and my sister then woke up but could still feel the hug of my grandma.
Now my grandma loved the beetles and my Mom has this lil clock radio at
her desk at work and a beetle song came on. But my Mom was leaving for
lunch with her friend Kristy and that's when my Mom told kristy aww my
Mom loved this song and then tried to turn it off b/c she was leaving but
it wouldn't turn off (IM not lying my Mom even has a witness) so my Mom
left it alone and when she came back from work it was playing another beetles
song.&nbsp; the next was with my aunt she was at my grandmas house and
was in her room looking at pictures when she started crying and thats when
she felt a hand on her face like a lil comforting touch. And I cant remember
everything b/c my grandma made lots of visits. And I only witnessed one
and it happen just three weeks a go. My grandpa (my grandmas husband) recently
had a stroke and has been in the hospital the past 4 months. So we are
remodeling the house for him. And my grandma had a sweet little habit of
keeping everything her 6 children earned. and grandchildren too. Well,
she had their priceless trophies on top of the entertainment center and
my uncle was talking about throwing them all out. that was then when my
grandmas music box had begun playing. I was totally speechless and that
was the last of my grandma I have heard of. And that's all my experiences
and thank you for letting me share them I hope you enjoy.</B>

<BR><B>Dousman House - Brookfield, WI</B>

<P><B>By: lordchaos@wi.rr.com</B>

<P><B>There is a house just off a main road, it's a historic site now which</B>
<BR><B>can be toured. It was active during the 1800s. What went on in this</B>
<BR><B>house to cause it to be haunted is a mystery. It's said that it
was a</B>
<BR><B>place where people were hung. I have seen people on the balcony
above</B>
<BR><B>the front door of the main house. The visitor center is a hot spot
as</B>
<BR><B>well. Doors have been known to slam as well as people walking past</B>
<BR><B>windows. My friend was looking in the front window and up the stairs</B>
<BR><B>because there was someone walking back and forth then thing flew
at him</B>
<BR><B>and scared him pretty white. Another incident happened to another
friend</B>
<BR><B>who was looking in the visitors center and a head popped up. While
my</B>
<BR><B>friend was looking at a window through his night vision camera we
saw</B>
<BR><B>orbs dancing in the window. I have collect several EVPs while we
were</B>
<BR><B>there. I have picture with unexplained lights as well.</B>

<P><B>Foster Falls - Major Graham Mansion</B>

<P><B>By: sweety_stephy03@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>On Major Graham Mansion:</B>
<BR><B>It may be true that the house is haunted, but the story that is
posted couldn't be any farther from the truth.&nbsp; I don't live far from
the mansion and I have been in it.&nbsp; There is one light in the house
that burns all of the time.&nbsp; It's in the room to the left after you
enter the house through the front door, the only entrance to the house,
I guess it would be considered the living room.&nbsp; The house does have
electricity, but it only works in that room.&nbsp; There is only furniture
in that room, couches, chairs, and tables.&nbsp; In the dining room, to
the right of the room in which you enter after entering the house, there
is a gorgeous chandelier hanging from the ceiling.&nbsp; In the room at
the front door, I guess it could be called a foyer, it is completely empty
except for the entrance to the basement and the staircases going up.&nbsp;
There are 3 floors to the house, I've only been to the second, there is
an owl that hangs out on the top floor, or so that's what it is said to
be.&nbsp; from the outside looking up there are 2 balconies one on each
of the top floors.&nbsp; The bathroom is in the shape of a wide U and possibly
3 feet wide with cut outs for the toilet, sink, andthen you walk straight
into the shower, only one way in and easily trapped in it, it's a creepy
place because it's a good distance from the door to the shower and there
is no light left coming in from another room.&nbsp; In the basement of
the house you go down the steps, and it looks like it stops there, but
you turn right to go further and to the jail cells and the shackles are
still on the walls.&nbsp; At the bottom of the steps to the left there
are bars, it's really freaky because you just except someone to reach out
grab you.&nbsp; Then there are the slave houses, shackles and jail cells.&nbsp;
I've been told that if you look around you can see bones and things but
parts of the ceiling had fell and I wasn't up for looking for any bones.&nbsp;
Oh, one thing I forgot, when you go in the front door, you have to have
a key (obviously, and yes I had the key, a bit of a cheater, but we won't
go into that detail) once the door is shut and you are inside you can't
just turn the knob to open the door, because there is no knob on the inside,
just a key hole.&nbsp; You're screwed if you get in there and expect to
go out the front door.</B>
<BR><B>Now, from outside when you are riding by:</B>
<BR><B>The road goes a long on the left side of the house and the front
of it.&nbsp; On the left side you see a light on the 2nd floor in the room
w/ the balcony (where there is no light on the inside) you can see this
shadow that looks to be peering out at you with their hand above their
eyes to reduce glare on the glass from the light.&nbsp; Then it will stay
there.&nbsp; You go around to the front of the house and there will be
a light on the second floor from a window above the front door and the
light coming through the glass on either side of the front door.&nbsp;
Shadows can be seen through the glass at the front doors, but it isn't
from items in the room, as I said, it is empty.&nbsp; So you turn around
and go back to the side, the person, or shadow (whatever it was) that seemed
to be peering out is gone.&nbsp; When you go back to the front of the house,
the light from the window is gone, the window now appears boarded up.&nbsp;
This is the way it happens almost every time we are there.&nbsp; It's so
much fun becaue you don't know if your eyes and mind are playing tricks
on you or if what you see if truly there.</B>
<BR><B>I just wanted to make sure the story was correct.</B>

<P><B>Friends House</B>

<P><B>By: GoodC1987@aol.com</B>

<P><B>I have had many stories told to me about ghost encounters and only
a few have happened to me.</B>
<BR><B>I stayed the night at my friends house many many times.&nbsp; I
knew that it was haunted for many reasons.&nbsp; She had told me stories
of her grandmother and of previous owners.&nbsp; One particular night was
the only night I had experiences.&nbsp; We had stayed up until about 10:30
because it was a school night and we needed to get some last minute homework
done.&nbsp; Well Tiffany dozed off really fast, but I couldn't sleep at
all.&nbsp; I guess about an hour past and I was awake even more so than
earlier.&nbsp; Well, I heard this heavy slow breathing on the couch across
the coffee table.&nbsp; I looked over knowing that it was the old man who
had died in the house of a heart attack about 20 years earlier, but the
sound got louder and he laid down on the bed between Tiff and myself.&nbsp;
The bed got really low in the middle and this woke my friend.&nbsp; She
said "George please go away for a while, until I wake up."&nbsp; (The man's
name was George.)&nbsp; I guess that he took that as a hint for a while
becasue he got up.&nbsp; I could feel him climbing over Tiffany and off
of the bed.&nbsp; Well later on that night, after I finally fell asleep,
Tiffany woke me up crying and I mean she was so upset that I couldn't understand
what she was talking about.&nbsp; She told me that a girl in a blue prom
dress was screaming at her to get up and do something.&nbsp; Well her mom
heard her crying and came in the room.&nbsp; She ended up sleeping with
us the rest of the night.&nbsp; Also her mom told us about a time when
she woke up to her mother sitting on the foot of her bed just to say that
she was ok (her mother had been dead 4 or 5 years by this time) and that
she loved her very much.</B>
<BR><B>Now my grandmother is like a magnet to these types of things.&nbsp;
Her mother was murdered when she was 16 and came bak some 14 years later
to tell her to go check on my aunt because a necklace was wrapped around
her neck and she was choking.</B>
<BR><B>Also there was this rocking chair that she bought in a yard sale
in the late 60's and it would move itself around the house and always back
to the kitchen away from the living room.</B>
<BR><B>In Louisville, KY, there's this house on First Street that is very
haunted according to her and the rest of her children.&nbsp; Closets would
have never ending black holes, doors would open and shut easily by themselves,
but if someone would try to open it, the door would drag the floor.&nbsp;
Also an old lady had hung herself in the living room and my grandmother
said that one day she looked in the mirror and the lady was standing next
to her smiling.&nbsp; I didn't know whether to believe her or not, but
her children have told me stories of the same sort.&nbsp; My father included.</B>

<P><B>From A Mom</B>

<P><B>By: saddleup@nefcom.net</B>

<P><B>I , not having this ability to see ghosts, am trying to keep an open
mind.&nbsp; For the last 6 years my son has told me that he sees shadowy
forms of confederate soldiers walking in the direction of the Olustee Battle
Field in Olustee Florida.&nbsp; We only live 3 or so miles away from it.&nbsp;
This was first told to me when he was 7 years old.&nbsp; At first I was
supportive but did not really believe him, thinking it was just his mind
playing tricks on him.&nbsp; But over the years my son has kept coming
to me and telling me, "Mom I saw them again".&nbsp; At 13 years old he
calmly tells me that he sees the hazy shadow like forms of Confederate
soldiers sometimes on but mostly several of them, slowly walking towards
sanderson (a little town in the direction of the battlefield), and sometimes
he sees them running in the opposite direction.&nbsp; Sometimes he heards
the screams of pain, or someone faintly yelling charge.&nbsp; I ask him
if it frightens him and he says no, it is just a part of his everyday life
and he is use to it.&nbsp; He has seen them on our property and sometimes
on my neighbors still walking towards the battle.&nbsp; What can I say,
I was a bit sceptical.. but now I am starting to rethink this.</B>
<BR><B>So I started looking into the history of our area.&nbsp;&nbsp; And
confederate soldiers did come across this property following the railroad
to the battle.&nbsp; This area is also listed under Lake City, Florida
as being haunted (at the battle field), but what is really eerie is that
the description of the ghosts on the web site matches exactly what my son
has been telling me for the last 6 years. I took him to the battle field
one day and all I can say is he did not want to stay there and kept telling
me we can go now...&nbsp;&nbsp; Just last night he saw them again and the
more I learn about this the more questions I have.</B>

<P><B>Bedford Iowa</B>

<P><B>By: vampbaby150@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;This is a house I used to live in. Bedford is a small town
with lots of history. This is house is a large, 2-story with an upstairs
room of 6 windows. The house was near to 100 years old. The old portion
of the basement was once used for coal mining. When cleaning out that part
of the basement, we found old tools and pieces of coal. The coal shaft
in the wall had been sealed shut. My older brother and I converted the
old portion to a game room. One night while down there by myself, my cat
(you'd been sleeping peacefully beneath the table) lept up with a screech,
jumped up (a good 5 feet) to the coal shaft, let out a final hiss and bolted
from the room. A chill went down my back and I froze. Then I bolted out
of the room and upstairs after my cat. I never went into that part of the
basement alone again and if I was in the newer, cement part of it, I made
sure the door connecting to that room was closed. I no longer live in that
house with my family. O!</B>
<BR><B>ther experiences happened infrequently: feelings, chills, shadows,
the presence of another, being watched in the basement, feeling something
was under the basement stairs. I seemed to be the only one who felt the
things.</B>
