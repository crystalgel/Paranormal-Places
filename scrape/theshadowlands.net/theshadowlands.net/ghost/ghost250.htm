<BR><B>&nbsp;The Trailer Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jasmyn83@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Well me and my cousin mike were at his grandmothers</B>
<BR><B>trailor in mount clemmens MI we were about 11 years</B>
<BR><B>old i'm 20 now and he told me a story about a</B>
<BR><B>fisherman that haunts the lake by the trailor we</B>
<BR><B>stayed in.</B>
<BR><B>So of course i did not believe him i didn't believe in</B>
<BR><B>ghosts at the time. Well my friend gary lived in the</B>
<BR><B>trailor park he was moving the next day so we hung out</B>
<BR><B>with him the whole day. Anyways he wanted to walk to</B>
<BR><B>the shed that the so called fisherman owned. So about</B>
<BR><B>10:30 pm we all decided to walk down the trail towards</B>
<BR><B>the shed witch was about a mile walk. We were already</B>
<BR><B>scared because it was very creepy out there and</B>
<BR><B>lightening was striking out a storm was moving our way</B>
<BR><B>pretty fast so we decided to jog alittle so we finally</B>
<BR><B>arrived at this little beat up shed and it was scary</B>
<BR><B>looking. I dared mike to go in he said no way so we</B>
<BR><B>dared Gary to go in there he said ok and then went in.</B>
<BR><B>We waited for him for like 15 minutes then finally he</B>
<BR><B>came out and he was white as a ghost he started crying</B>
<BR><B>and ran like a track runner towars his trailer.Mike</B>
<BR><B>and i stood there for a few minutes and said what was</B>
<BR><B>that about. So we started back to his grandma's</B>
<BR><B>trailer suddenly it started raining cats and dogs (not</B>
<BR><B>literally) it was raining hard and the thunder was</B>
<BR><B>loud. we started to get freeked out so we started to</B>
<BR><B>run back (remember this was like a mile walk) Anyways</B>
<BR><B>i looked in the lake to see what was a glowing</B>
<BR><B>lantern. So we stopped to see what it was. What we</B>
<BR><B>think we saw was a small 12ft fishing boat with a</B>
<BR><B>fisherman on it he was holding a lantern&nbsp; he was</B>
<BR><B>wearing a yellow suit with a yellow hat we could see</B>
<BR><B>him clearly this really freaked us out so we ran</B>
<BR><B>through the forest to get home all of a sudden we</B>
<BR><B>started seeing glowing lights in the forest i never</B>
<BR><B>ran so fast in my life. so we finally made it to the</B>
<BR><B>trailer and no one was there the power was out and the</B>
<BR><B>storm was really bad by then. All of a sudden we</B>
<BR><B>peaked out the window to see the man on the boat</B>
<BR><B>sinking with the lantern into the lake it took like</B>
<BR><B>ten minutes for him to sink underwater that really</B>
<BR><B>freaked us out. Right after that his grandma walked in</B>
<BR><B>and we told her what happened then she said i know</B>
<BR><B>people see him all the time especially during</B>
<BR><B>stormes.Well the next day gary was gone he moved and</B>
<BR><B>never he never said goodbye to us. I havent talked to</B>
<BR><B>him since. well Hope you liked it.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Uninvited Guests</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:emrickk@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I was just reliving this experience and almost finished my story
when my message suddenly shut down.&nbsp; I lost everything I typed.&nbsp;
I'll try again....</B>
<BR><B>In 1999 I was living in Southern Ontario, Canada on my own with
my two cats.&nbsp; I was starting my life away from all of my family and
friends on my own.</B>
<BR><B>My two cats are typically lazy and constantly longing for attention.&nbsp;
They only time I ever see them get excited is when I am feeding them or
a friend stops by for tea.&nbsp; Friends who have visited can tell you
that my felines will get under foot meowing and purring as they wait for
someone to give them the stroking they are longing for.</B>
<BR><B>As I said, I lived alone with the exception of my furry roommates.&nbsp;
I was settling to bed early as I had to work first thing in the morning.&nbsp;
My cats cuddled up on the bed beside me and seranaded me to sleep with
their contented purring as they usually do.&nbsp; I'm not sure how long
I was asleep when I started to become aware of the activity going on in
my apartment.&nbsp; My cats were meowing and repeatedly coming in and out
of my room and leaping up and down off the bed.&nbsp; As I tried to fully
understand what was going on as I woke up I could hear something in the
background.&nbsp; I could hear whispering.&nbsp; My heart immediately started
to pound so hard and loud I thought that the bed was vibrating in tempo.&nbsp;
I didn't move a muscle as I openned my eyes and looked out my bedroom door
searching for the source of the noise.&nbsp; Two figures were standing
in full view in my livingroom.&nbsp; My breathing started to increase and
I thought for sure that I was going to hyperventilate while I reviewed
my nightly routine.&nbsp; Did I lock the front door?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Did
I lock the patio door?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I told myself not to move.&nbsp;
Let them take whatever they want and get the hell out of my house!!&nbsp;
The figures were very clear despite how dark it was.&nbsp; I could see
a man on the right and a woman on the left.&nbsp; They looked to be in
their mid-twenties.&nbsp; I watched through wide eyes as the woman leaned
into the man and whispered to him.&nbsp; They were both moving around in
an odd manner, as though they were rubbing something all over their arms.&nbsp;
It made absolutely no sense to me!&nbsp; Suddenly I noticed that the woman
saw me.&nbsp; My heart continued to pound violently.&nbsp; I couldn't take
my eyes off her no matter how much I wanted to.&nbsp; She lean forward
as if to get a better look at me, raised her right hand and slowly waved
at me.&nbsp; Fear took full control of my body and I jumped out of bed
and turned on my lamp to confront the intruders!!&nbsp; I watched them
move swiftly out of my view into my livingroom towards my couch.&nbsp;
I rushed out of my room to meet them.&nbsp; I found myself standing alone
in my living.&nbsp; My mind was racing so I immediately called 911 to report
a home invasion.&nbsp; While I waited for the police to arrive I searched
my small apartment for any sign of another person.&nbsp; There was nothing.&nbsp;
The doors were locked, the cats were calm and I just stood there in my
PJ's trying to make sense of what had just happened.&nbsp; I'm sure the
police that came to my rescue got a good chuckle out of my experience because
when they came in to question me I saw an officer searching my cupboards.&nbsp;
I assume he was looking for some chemical reason for my allegation.&nbsp;
We both found nothing.&nbsp; Was it a ghost or a dream?</B>

<P><B>Visitation</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: TAFERRILL@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>A year and a half ago while my late wife was in the hospital near
death with brain cancer, I came home to an empty house after a band gig
and slept on the sofa in the living room. About 3 am or so, I woke to see
an amber colored swirling light in the bedroom where we usually slept.
I thought the room was on fire, and as I started to jump up to see what
was going on, I suddenly fell back into a deep relaxing sleep which I didn't
awaken from until the next morning. My wife passed away 5 days later. I
think it was her soul coming to experience the house one last time before
she moved on. This experience I will never forget. I was fully awake at
the time and alert being as I thought the room was burning.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Weird Experience in Outback Australia</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Shaynebrown@bigpond.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I found your website while bored at work and I noticed that there
isn't many experiences from Australia, if any. So I'd like to share a very
scary experience of mine. I've had a couple of paranormal experiences but
this one takes the cake, so to speak. I lived for many years in a small
outback town and dated a guy from the nearest town, about 79 kilometres
away. A bit of background information about the land is that it was a place
of white settlement and many missions for Aboriginal people were established
over the years although only two remain. The main tribal people in our
area are the Kamilaroi people.</B>
<BR><B>Many of the properties, or ranches as I believe you call them, had
Aboriginal settlements and workers on them back about a centuary ago up
til about fifty years ago. I was around eighteen years old when I went
with my then boyfriend Jody to his home town of Lightning Ridge for dinner
with his parents. He had an old panelvan car that we travelled everywhere
in and had never had a problem with. We stayed at the restaurant until
about 11:30pm before driving back to my home town where Jody now lived.
We were tired so there wasn't much conversation on the way home. I was
driving and we got about 15 kilometres out of town. On the road there are
several grids, which are grates with two thick barriers on either side
of the road so that cattle and sheep can't wander out of the area.</B>
<BR><B>About 15 kilometres out of town we crossed this grid and I started
to get a horrible feeling. I can't think of any other way to describe it.
The hair on the back of my neck stood on end and I got the eerie feeling
that I was being watched and that something bad was out there. I kept quite
because I thought I was just being silly but at the same time Jody and
I looked at each other and I said to him "Can you feel that too?" and he
nodded, looking really freaked out as well. Almost as soon as I said that
the back two doors of the panel van started making this horrible noise.
It sounded like something was on the back of the car trying to get in!!</B>
<BR><B>The back doors of the panel van used to have a handle but it had
falled off about six months previously and we hadn't got it fixed so you
needed to use pliers to open the door. I asked him "What the hell is that!?"
We looked in the back of the panel van (you just had to crawl over the
top of the bench seat to be in the back of the car) but the doors were
vibrating and making this awful loud noise and I felt totally sick. We
kept talking to each other trying to keep calm and Jody agreed that it
sounded like somthing bad was trying to get in. I just had an overwhelming
feeling that whatever was out there that night was evil and angry and didn't
want us there.</B>
<BR><B>A weird thing was that we saw no animals at all on the sides of
the road. Usually the road of a night is full of kangeroos, sheep, cattle,
rabbits, foxes and feral cats but there was nothing at all, and no traffic.
There is a lot of shooters on the roads travelling to and from properties
but there was nothing!! I have never driven so fast and so tensely!! My
arms ached from gripping the steering wheel so tight and my back hurt from
leaning forward as though it was going to get us there faster! Jody was
in the back trying to make the doors stop moving but nothing he did helped
at all. He was a huge skeptic and tried to rationalise, after a while,
that the doors weren't shut properly, but they were.</B>
<BR><B>About 15 kilometres out of Walgett, my home town, there is the last
grid before the town. The weirdest thing is that almost as soon as we crossed
it the feeling began to dissapate and the noise stopped. We started to
laugh out of relief more than anything. We were still too scared to go
back to our house so we drove out to my parents to spend the night. We
pulled up in the drive way and were gathering up our stuff when a flash
of light that lasted about three to five seconds illuminated the sky. It
was too long to be lightning and there wasn't a cloud in the sky. Does
anyone have any thoughts on this?</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;As Long as Everything is Calm</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Jdraege@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I have not actually seen the ghosts myself. I have heard them though.
I do</B>
<BR><B>believe that they can be contacted though my Grandmother probably
would rather</B>
<BR><B>not. They live in my Grandmother's house. She claims that they always
have been</B>
<BR><B>there. I do recall staying the night on a couple of occasions and
distinctively</B>
<BR><B>hearing plain as day someone whistling a tune, unfamiliar to me,
but a tune of</B>
<BR><B>some kind for sure. I was sort of scared for a while, but for some
reason not to</B>
<BR><B>much to keep me awake all night. I eventually fell asleep. There
have been</B>
<BR><B>sightings in the house. My uncle lives there and has experienced
some of the</B>
<BR><B>paranormal activity including an actual ghost. It was late at night,
of course,</B>
<BR><B>and he swears up and down to have seen a misty outline of human
shape. He was</B>
<BR><B>aw-struck! He said that it was non-hostile, though he was scared
to death. Other</B>
<BR><B>times things have been mispalce from there usual areas or spots
in the kitchen,</B>
<BR><B>and nobody claims to know why. A pair of pantyhose were strung along
a</B>
<BR><B>half-eaten pie left over from the night before on the kitchen counter.
The dog</B>
<BR><B>does play with someone or something in the house in the middle of
the night. She</B>
<BR><B>runs through the house and occasionally barks at it. The house is
a very old two</B>
<BR><B>story house with an attic and a basement. The floors sometime squeak
upstairs as</B>
<BR><B>if someone were walking on them. It sometimes spooks me, but my
Grandmother has</B>
<BR><B>grown used to it. She says "they don't bother me and I don't bother
them". I</B>
<BR><B>thought that I would share this with everyone, because ghosts have
a bad rap.</B>
<BR><B>They are associated with the negative side to hauntings, such as
purposely</B>
<BR><B>frightening the residents of the area. Not all ghosts or hauntings
are bad.</B>
<BR><B>These are souls of people who I feel are sharing the house with
my Grandmother</B>
<BR><B>and are in my opinion O.K. with that. Since I don't live there and
am not used</B>
<BR><B>to it, it spooks me to death! Everything I have shared with everyone
is true.</B>
<BR><B>Nothing listed in this story is fictional or false. I hope it has
been an</B>
<BR><B>interest to all. We plan to carry on sharing the house with all
ghosts as long</B>
<BR><B>as everything is calm. Thanks</B><B></B>

<BR><B>When I was Young</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: giselle@capital.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>my first recolection of being scared oout of my wits was when i guess
i was around 5. we were living in a trailer . I remember&nbsp; lying in
our bunkbeds (my sister amy 13 months older than myself) and all i remember
is i looked at the paneled walls and this glowing red face of a really
scary&nbsp; red devil with horns apeared . i dont remember antthing else
but that i was very frightened. well i found out later in my adult life
that my mom and dad had aquired a couch from a relative (i guess someone
that had passed), and we got the couch from my aunt bee(thats short for
beautrice). well the story goes that my dad and some friends were home
one night when my mom went out and my dad went to sit on the couch and
he was thrown into a wall and had a big egg on his head!&nbsp;&nbsp; can
confirn that the next thing he did was&nbsp; that he got his shotgun and
fired over and over again at the couch and then soon afer they took it
to the town dump,..... the end of that!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Well i can remember
growing up at the house my parents were buying . things there were never
dull.</B>
<BR><B>As you would expect&nbsp;&nbsp; a100 year old house and to hear
all</B>
<BR><B>kinds of footsteps upstairs. to this day my sister sara age 25 doesnt
care to go upstairs alone. She claims the room off our parents wich was
hers was evil.I cant blame her ! My sister amy will swear to this day that
she was in her room alone and sleeping all of a sudden she woke to something
smothering her she said it felt like a really heavy army wool like blanket
covering her, and a voice saying your a slut, and choking her . she said
some how she managed to push it off and break free. The same house i remember
one christmas my parents had a velvet picture of the devil, a glass of
champange, and i think a joint?? well we decorated the christmas tree ,
putt the angel atop and the next day noticed that the angel had turned
about face from the velvet wall hanging . my parents reaction was strange!!
the only other encounter&nbsp; i remember is bieng at my grandmas.She was
a 30 yr employee at the local ymca.I have&nbsp; to say that this is my
most how do i put it worst experience with the unknown. My grandma had
a house&nbsp; 2 stories&nbsp; at the local y i allways loved going there&nbsp;
french tost, ice cream...........it was only myself and grandma that night.
i only remember going to bed , waking up to the bed moving up and down</B>
<BR><B>vioently. it was so awfull, i went down sttairs and told gram what
had happened and she said .Dont worry you and i will just sleep doownstairs
tonightt. I think she looked&nbsp; at my expressions on knew i was talking
the truth. LITTLE THINGS HAPPEN NOW ,,, INTUITIONNS ,,, KNOWING&nbsp; A
COPS COMING&nbsp; LONG BEFORE THEY DOO. ALL I KNOW IS WHAT A RELIEF JUST
TO WRITE THIS TO SOMEONE..</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; What I saw!</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:chenoko@optonline.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I remember three years ago, I just gotten back from picking my wife
up from work.&nbsp; It was around eleven thirty at night and I was going
with my daughter to unlock the door, when I saw what appeared to be a large
dog standing betwee us and the house.&nbsp; I took in a big gasp and got
between it and my daughter.&nbsp; Then the dog disappeared.&nbsp; My wife
asked what was the matter.&nbsp; I told her and she&nbsp; said that she
had a rather odd experience a few days earlier.</B>
<BR><B>That day I was working overtime.&nbsp; She was fixing breakfast
and the kids were watching telivision, when they all heard what sounded
like me clearing my throat at the top of the stairs.&nbsp; This made my
kids and my wife jump. I came home about half an hour later.&nbsp; To this
day, we still don't knowwho or what it was that made the sound.</B>
<BR><B>We have moved since these things have happened, and we are still
waiting for another paranormal occurance.</B>

<P><B>I went on a tour of the Vilisca ax murder house, and something utterly
frightening happened. As I was about to walk into the room where the Stillenger
girls were murdered, I felt an icy blast of air on my neck. I was at the
back of the line, so no one was behind me. then as I walked around the
room, I felt another blast of air. Then my head got dizzy. I didn't pass
out, but I sure felt like I was about to.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Uncle</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: laundy@chariot.net.au</B><B></B>

<P><B>Dear Shadowlands, ever since I was little I have shared this house
with</B>
<BR><B>two ghosts, I got used to them. My grandparents lived over the road
and</B>
<BR><B>as children we often stayed over, I usually had the back bedroom.
That</B>
<BR><B>room always scared me, I always felt an angry or unhappy presence
next</B>
<BR><B>to the bed and always slept with the light on, but I never said</B>
<BR><B>anything, I was just a kid, who would believe me?., It wasn't until</B>
<BR><B>about ten years back, just before my grandparents died that I learnt
an</B>
<BR><B>interesting fact from my uncle. That back bedroom had belonged to
his</B>
<BR><B>brother, my uncle Noel until he was killed in a motorbike accident,
the</B>
<BR><B>day he was engaged, he was one month shy of his 22nd birthday. He
was</B>
<BR><B>killed not far from home by a drunk driver. I also learned that
he had</B>
<BR><B>been laid out in his coffin in 1953 in that bedroom. Now I knew
who it</B>
<BR><B>was and why he felt so angry, his brother told me he had never been
able</B>
<BR><B>to sleep well in that room either. Not long after the death of my</B>
<BR><B>grandparents the house was sold and I was never able to try and
make</B>
<BR><B>contact with Noel or tell him it was okay to move on. I don't know,
but</B>
<BR><B>he is probably still in his bedroom not realizing that he can go
to the</B>
<BR><B>light. I find it a sad tale of a beloved son who's life was cut
short</B>
<BR><B>when everything good was happening for him. My grandparents never
got</B>
<BR><B>over his death, and probably never knew he shared the house with
them</B>
<BR><B>until they passed on too.</B>

<BR><B>Truck Garage</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: dodgy@swamp57.fsnet.co.uk</B><B></B>

<P><B>I work in a truck garage in Derbyshire England, but I live 15 miles
away in Nottingham. ( where Robin Hood comes from).</B>
<BR><B>New years eve 2000 was going to be a good one, a big party for everyone
at work to be held in Derby. I asked a local taxi firm how much it would
be to take me home after the party; say 2am. They said about &pound;20.00.&nbsp;
But when I rang them at 2am new years day, they said they wanted &pound;40.00.
I didn't have that much on me, and I was pissed, so I walked to the garage
where I worked and broke in. (I'd been there a couple of years and knew
my way around... if you know what I mean...) I slept on the only carpet
in the garage, the boss's floor. After the holidays, I was telling a couple
of workmates what I'd done, and they looked at me in horror and said, "you
shouldn't have done that Phill." and I said, "what, cause I could get in
trouble???" and they said "No, cause the place is fuckin haunted!"</B>
<BR><B>THEN THEY TOLD ME THE STORY...</B>
<BR><B>A few years before, the guys in the workshop were unloading sheet
steel to make truck bodies from, and I'm not talking pick up trucks here,
I'm talking 42 tonne trucks. Well, the chain gave way and 14 sheets weighing
1 ton each fell on a man and crushed him to death.</B>
<BR><B>Before I go on with the story, it is important that you know the
layout of the workshop.</B>
<BR><B>There are 20 bays in a line like you'd find on any car park, but
these bays are 40 foot long and 18 feet wide. >From the roof, between each
bay hangs a chain at the front and a chain at the back with a length of
wood between, like a large child's swing, and it ends about 15 feet from
the floor. Stapeled to this wooden batton is a denim curtain to prevent
welding flash from one bay blinding people working in the next bay. There
are 18 of these heavy denim curtains hanging between the bays.</B>
<BR><B>OK, back to the story...</B>
<BR><B>The night after the accident, the foreman was locking up when he
heard a noise.</B>
<BR><B>"HELLO?"</B>
<BR><B>......nothing</B>
<BR><B>"HELLO???"</B>
<BR><B>....................nothing</B>
<BR><B>Then he heard someone running from one end of the workshop to the
other.</B>
<BR><B>Every time they came to one of the curtains he saw the imprint of
two hands push through it as it swang out of the way, WHOOSH....&nbsp;&nbsp;
WHOOSH...&nbsp;&nbsp; WHOOSH...&nbsp; but he saw no one.</B>
<BR><B>He locked the door and ran home........</B>
<BR><B>This thing, whatever it was, ran through truck bodies, heavy chassis
&amp; fuel tanks, but had to push his way through denim.</B>
<BR><B>WEIRD OR WHAT..........&nbsp;&nbsp; and true</B><B></B>

<P><B>Tombstone in the Back Yard</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: punkpoisonx@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My ghost story takes place in a farely large house in Buffalo, NY.
It was</B>
<BR><B>larger than the rest of the houses on that street. People often
came over to</B>
<BR><B>see the "Tombstone" that was in the backyard. Nobody knew what it
was, it</B>
<BR><B>looked like a tombstone, it had engraving on it and everything,
but my</B>
<BR><B>parents insisted that it wasn't a tombstone. On many nights, my
dad had to</B>
<BR><B>go downstairs with a baseball bat because he swore someone was in
the house.</B>
<BR><B>I did not pay much attention to this, until I saw the ghost in the
house. I</B>
<BR><B>was sitting in my room on a Monday night watching wrestling in late
1998. My</B>
<BR><B>little stepbrother was in bed in the room next to me. Something
drew my</B>
<BR><B>attention to outside my room...All of a sudden I seen this little
girl with</B>
<BR><B>blond pigtails, and blue overalls run past my room into the bathroom.
My</B>
<BR><B>first thought was "Why is Brett (My stepbrother) up? So I ran after
it into</B>

<BR><B>Not A Hoax</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:lindsay@myaccess.com.au</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is A.j and this is my story. One night I was staying at my
Nanna's house as my Mum had to work this particular night. I was sitting
on my Auntie's bed (because I was sleeping in that room) and felt a cold
feeling in that room. I ignored it and went to sleep. Then the next morning
as I woke up I looked in the mirror and saw a boy sitting on the end of
the bed. My brother is 22 so he doesn't live at home and I have no other
brothers or boy cousins. Panicking I turned around and there was no one
there. At breakfast I questioned my Nanna about this mysterious boy and
she new nothing about him. We cheked the house and there was no signs of
someone breaking in. Ever since I have seen that boy things have been broken,
moved and even gone missing from that room and all over the house.</B>
<BR><B>That WAS NOT a hoax and I have sound recordings of foot steps, voices
and whistling from that room.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The Warning</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: JJMUrrutia@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Moments before receiving a call from my sister confirming my father's
terminal illness, a glass flew out of my cabinet and smashed onto the countertop
with such amazing force that it reverberated through my body like a thundering
echo.&nbsp; I felt strongly that it was the presence of my late brother,
warning me of events that he'd hinted to in an earlier dream.&nbsp; He
was going to let me know when my parents would soon pass on...</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Silversmith Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: hofner@earthlink.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Silversmith Ghost</B>
<BR><B>This story is true, and concerns my first close encounter with a
materialized spirit.&nbsp; I have had other encounters of varying natures
which I will chronicle as time allows.</B>
<BR><B>In the summer of 1979, the manager of our band bought a pub, The
Silversmith, intending it to be a base of operations for us.&nbsp; He presented
it as a surprise as we came off a month-long gig at the now-defunct MGM
Grand in Reno; along with that surprise came the pronouncement that we
were also volunteers in the remodel brigade, a task destined to take several
months.&nbsp; The structure, while in good enough shape for a tavern, lacked
the proper feng shui for a pub as grand as our manager's imagination demanded.&nbsp;
It was an historical building, though not designated as such; serving first
as a train station, then a trolley station and numerous other businesses
before 'we' acquired it, the building had time to build up no small amount
of spiritual energy, as I was soon to discover.</B>
<BR><B>Having been involved in almost every aspect of the remodel, it naturally
followed that I became involved in every other aspect of the operation,
including acting as bartender.&nbsp; With the exception of the cigarette
smoke, I enjoyed the job, as it gave me the opportunity to meet people,
get to know the regulars and make some new acquaintances.&nbsp; Throughout
the course of this process, I began to spend more and more time there,
eventually acting as a manager and performing the usual managerial tasks
of doing receipts and closing the place at 2:00 a.m.</B>
<BR><B>It was a typical November Saturday evening at the pub. The band
had gone home, I had coerced the last regular into finishing the beer he'd
been nursing while enlightening me in the ways of life in general, and
had urged him safely out the door and into a cab.&nbsp; Locking the entrance
and exit doors, it was time to check the building to make certain I hadn't
missed anyone in the lavatories or anywhere else.&nbsp; I made my usual
rounds to find all was well; I was alone, free to clean up, upend the chairs,
"z" the register, restock the coolers and go home.</B>
<BR><B>With all of the tasks done except restocking the coolers, I went
back into the kitchen, intending to go to the main cooler for fresh beer.&nbsp;
Along the way, I noticed a small mess on the counter and stopped to clean
it up before continuing on to the cooler.&nbsp; As I was wiping the counter,
I noticed movement out of the corner of my eye, toward the main cooler.&nbsp;
A tall man in a brown plaid flannel shirt and Levis was standing there,
a mere 15 feet away, facing me, but looking to his left; this would have
him staring at the rear loading door, which was never unlocked except for
receiving and it was locked now, as I had checked it only minutes before.&nbsp;
I knew without a shred of doubt that no one could have been left in the
building after I locked the doors, as there was simply nowhere for anyone
to hide.&nbsp; It was as this thought coursed through my mind that the
man turned his head, looked at me, then faded to nothing.&nbsp; Of the
options available to me, I chose to find the nearest exit.</B>
<BR><B>Aproximately two weeks later and under much the same circumstances,
I had a similar occurrance, though this was a bit closer.&nbsp; While I
was cleaning up the sideboard in the kitchen, I turned around to wash out
the sponge I was using and practically ran into the same man.&nbsp; The
width of the kitchen was only about eight feet, and at least two feet on
either side was used as counter space and grilles, leaving four feet of
walkway, at most.&nbsp; This places this man no more than three feet in
front of me and approximately three feet to my right, as solid in appearance
as the grilles before which he stood.&nbsp; Not as startled this time,
I looked directly at him and asked if I could help him - I don't know if
what he did was in response to my question, but he turned his head, looked
directly at me, somewhat sadly, and began moving his mouth in such a way
as to suggest he was speaking.&nbsp; I heard nothing, and began to ask
again when, more slowly than before, he faded to nothing.</B>
<BR><B>I never told the owner, our friend and manager, about the encounter,
not wanting to tarnish his dream of owning a pub.&nbsp; As it was, he owned
it for another two years before selling it to the current owner.&nbsp;
I may someday enquire of him about any spiritual activity he may have encountered.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Piano Lady</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: stizzard@shaw.ca</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My wife grew up in a turn of the Century (1910) home in Charlottetown,
Prince Edward Island, Canada.&nbsp; The home is beautiful and typical of
the era in style inexterior look and internal design.&nbsp; There are but
2 like it built on the Island, and they are next door to each other.</B>
<BR><B>I began dating my wife when I was 17 years old. At that time she
worked as a concessionist at a local stage production theatre.&nbsp; My
future inlaws trusted me and would allow me to wait in their house, while
they were away, for her to return from work.&nbsp; She usually returned
around 11pm.&nbsp; In the meantime I would watch TV in their living room
next to burning hearth.</B>
<BR><B>One particular night I felt extremely uneasy for no apparant reason.&nbsp;
I am a very rational, logical thinking person and am not prone to suspending
my sense of disbelief. This night, however, made the hair on the back of
my neck prickle.&nbsp; I recall the following events:</B>
<BR><B>1.&nbsp; The sense of feeling stared at, funny enough, by a older
female</B>
<BR><B>2.&nbsp; Listening to the sounds of someone walking up and down
the wooden oak stairs</B>
<BR><B>3.&nbsp; Hearing the light switch "click" on and off</B>
<BR><B>4.&nbsp; Feeling a very cold chill of air on the right side of my
body as if a frisge door had been opened next to me.</B>
<BR><B>I was so unnerved that I had to leave the house and sit on the front
stoop to welcome my girlfriend home after work.&nbsp; She sensed my unease
and after some questions, I recalled the events that had unnerved me.&nbsp;
Please keep in mind, reader, that noone had ever spoken of these types
of events before.</B>
<BR><B>My girlfriend confirmed that she, too, had felt as though someone
were staring at her whilst she played the piano and from the same place
in the room that I felt someone staring from as well.&nbsp; She also told
me that she had heard the sound of furniture ( chairs from a table)&nbsp;
moving at night in the kitchen only to discover after investigating that
noone had been in the kitchen.&nbsp; Her Mom confirmed she had experienced
similar noises as well but though it was her kids having a late night snack.</B>
<BR><B>The spookiest item of my girlfriends story is the fact that she
once clasped a necklace around her nech whilst dressing in her bedroom
on the second floor.&nbsp; As she bent over the necklass fell to the ground
and was still clasped.&nbsp; Oddly enough,&nbsp;&nbsp; and this is what
really spooked her, is that the necklace was not long enough to fit over
her head once it was clasped!</B>
<BR><B>I never felt as though the entitiy was malevolent.&nbsp; In fact,
it seemed as though she was just curious or in fact enjoying company.&nbsp;
Although spooked. future events never unnerved me as I felt as though the
entity would not harm us.</B>
<BR><B>This relates my one and only weird experience.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Photo Album</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: WHOEVER@myexcel.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>A couple of days ago, I went to my friends house which she just moved
into a few months ago.&nbsp; She was telling me that she thought her house
was haunted because a couple of weeks before she had been unpacking a box
in her office and found a really neat old photo album that her grandmother
had given her and there was also a little blue book called Mysteries for
kids. Later that day she had gone down stairs to do laundry and told her
husband ("let me go get this neat photo album and show it to you")&nbsp;
she went back up stairs and it was gone.&nbsp; I was joking with her and
said ok, lets have a meeting with the ghost and tell them to give it back.&nbsp;
Me and my friend left and went to lunch.&nbsp; A couple hours&nbsp; after
when we returned I noticed that the door to the office was closed.&nbsp;
She had gone into the kitchen to do something and I thought (duh, just
open the door)&nbsp; I did and sure enough right in the middle of the room
on the floor sat that photo album and the little blue book, and there was
also a little box.I ran and got my friend and freaked out.&nbsp; I asked
her what the little box was and it was a box of her grandmas jewelry that
she kept down stairs in a dresser tucked away.&nbsp; TALK ABOUT CREEPY!!!</B>

<BR><B>The Old Man and Woman</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: krazylauren00@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello all! I was just reading through the stories here, and was reminded
of</B>
<BR><B>something frightening that happened to me when I was much younger.
(I'm a</B>
<BR><B>junior in college now). The experience (or experiences) took place
in the</B>
<BR><B>house where I spent most of my childhood, in the room that I shared
with my</B>
<BR><B>sister. My family bought the house brand new; we had it built, so
I know</B>
<BR><B>that I couldn't base these happenings on the house being over 100
years old</B>
<BR><B>or anything.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, I think I was about 8 or 9 years old. It was about 2 or
3 in the</B>
<BR><B>morning, and I woke up, choking and coughing, feeling like I couldn't</B>
<BR><B>breathe at all. When I finally opened my eyes, I saw a distinct
figure</B>
<BR><B>standing over me. From what I could make out in the darkness, it
was an old</B>
<BR><B>woman, wearing what looked to be a witch's hat. As soon as I woke
up, I felt</B>
<BR><B>her long, bony fingers come off of my neck...as if she had been
choking me!</B>
<BR><B>She quickly faded into the darkness but I was terrified,and too
scared to</B>
<BR><B>get out of bed. I felt like if I hadn't woken up at that exact moment,
this</B>
<BR><B>thing would have succeeded in choking me. And here's the clincher:
I know I</B>
<BR><B>wasn't making it up, because the next day, I had red welts on my
neck that</B>
<BR><B>even my mom commented on. Of course, she didn't believe me when
I told her</B>
<BR><B>(she thought my brother and I had been fighting again!)</B>
<BR><B>Fortunately, I never encountered the old woman again. But I did
have another</B>
<BR><B>frightening experience, this one involving an old man. This happened
around</B>
<BR><B>the same time as the did the experience with the old woman. My desk,
at that</B>
<BR><B>time, sat at the foot of my bed, along with the desk chair, facing
the bed.</B>
<BR><B>One night I woke up and saw the figure of an old man, sitting at
my desk</B>
<BR><B>chair. He was wearing an suit, and had his hands folded in front
of him on</B>
<BR><B>top of the desk. If that wasn't terrifying in itself, his eyes were
two,</B>
<BR><B>glowing red circles, glaring at me in the darkness. I was too scared
to</B>
<BR><B>move, and was afraid that if I did, he would come after me or something.</B>
<BR><B>Eventually, he faded away, but I never was able to get back to sleep
that</B>
<BR><B>night.</B>
<BR><B>Nothing has ever happened to me besides those two encounters.&nbsp;
I asked my</B>
<BR><B>sister if she ever experienced anything similar to me, since we
did share</B>
<BR><B>the same room.&nbsp; She said no, but she's about 4 years younger
than me, and</B>
<BR><B>that's to be expected. She's still in the room today, and has never
reported</B>
<BR><B>anything out of the ordinary.&nbsp; But I still think about what
happenend to me</B>
<BR><B>those nights, and wonder if the two figures are related in some
way?</B>
<BR><B>Whatever the case, I don't know what they wanted with me, but I
sure am glad</B>
<BR><B>I've never experienced anything like that since.</B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I am a nurse and I work in a haunted hospital.&nbsp; I feel that
this is totally normal since so many people die there why not a few spirits?
We have the spirit of&nbsp; a very popular physician who worked there he
makes himself known by his cigar smoke some of my alzheimers patients even
say that he tucks them in at night.&nbsp; Everything in our facility is
old.&nbsp; the call buzzers cannot be reset at the nurses station but have
a separate button in the restrooms to reset these.&nbsp; One night i was
helping on another floor when my aid called to tell me the men's and the
womens were both ringing i could hear them.&nbsp; Keep in mind that our
downstairs patients are all unable to get up alone.&nbsp; they are all
nursing home.&nbsp; When i went down the&nbsp; call buzzers were buzzing
angrily in both restrooms i went into each and the buttons in the wall
were pressed in in both places.&nbsp; On another occasion I turnedThere
is also a little white haired lady who is said to rock in the rocking chairs
at the end of the hall.&nbsp; One night I was checking on a resident and
the person looked past me and shouted 'get the hell out of here"&nbsp;
I turned to see who came in as this particular resident did not like the
male cna's but there was no one there i questioned the resident further
about it and was told "that guy is sneaking up behind you"&nbsp; This was
the only time i actually got chills working the night shift.&nbsp; On another
occasion a resident who was fairly new and not at all confused was heard
to be shouting out the back door "hey come here"&nbsp; The person had been
heading to the restroom and had seen someone looking in the back door.&nbsp;
We had a difficult time convincing him that there was noone there as there
is a patio out back with a very high fence around it and no gate.&nbsp;
Well, i hope you can use my stories I am not afraid of ghosts, they do
make me nervous when they sneak up behind me&nbsp; ha ha</B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>When I was a young boy, about the age of 6, I had a happening that
made me a believer.</B>
<BR><B>First of all I come from a small town in South Louisiana. We were
not to well off and things were pretty bad in some ways.</B>
<BR><B>One night we all gathered at my Grandfathers house because of a
terrible storm that was coming. His home was a small one with two bed rooms,
kitchen and livening room coma- nation. There was no bath room in the house.</B>
<BR><B>During the storm I had to go to the bath room. All we had was a
chamber pot under the bed. I took a candle and went into the bed room.
As I was bending down to get the pot from under the bed I saw a man lying
on the bed. What stuck out the most on his person was his tie. It was red
and white striped. I was so startled I ran from the room screaming because
there was not suppose to be anyone else in that room. As I ran from the
room a tree which was right outside the bed room was struck by lightning
and fell into the room. It just happened to fall on the bed right where
I was standing.</B>
<BR><B>My Grandfather took me back into the room and asked me just what
did I see. I told him and he took the lamp and shined it upon a picture.
I told him this was the person that I saw on the bed. He then told me that
was not possible because this was my Uncle who had been killed during the
Second War on the beaches of Normandy.</B>
<BR><B>I now know that the sprit of my Uncle saved me from certain death.</B><B></B>

time</B>
<BR><B>me and my younger brother were sitting watching tv in my livivng
room and my</B>
<BR><B>mom was down my basement cleaning out my guine pigs cage. I heard
loud</B>
<BR><B>footsteps coming up the basement stairs so i thought it was my mom.

and</B>
<BR><B>watched her having a conversation with someone i couldnt see. all
of a</B>
<BR><B>sudden she just looked at the window and was talking to someone.
she was</B>
<BR><B>saying things like yes my name is taylor, what is yours. than she

a</B>
<BR><B>conversation for 10 minutes with this person or spirit i should

<BR><B>The End of Childhood</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: nightghost@softhome.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Me and my friends, all around 13 years of age. It was the time really
close to adulthood where we have the desires of an adult with the wisdom
of children.&nbsp; We always had played near and on the railroad tracks.
This particular set of tracks run right down through the center of our
town. The search of my memory from the past reveals those railroad</B>
<BR><B>tracks have always been there. We never had a problem with themwe
were all pretty smart. We knew to keep a watch for a train and climbed
down from the tracks whenever we even thought we saw one coming.&nbsp;
We always went "down the tracks" to a special place. It was a good mile
or two down the tracks toward forest. It was a remote area, at least remote
in our eyes. It was a magical place, a place that seemed untainted and
very special. It was after walking awhile west out of town on those tracks
that you came to this magical place. It had an old viaduct made of stone
that the tracks crosses over. Even when I was very young and the first
time I had been to this place that viaduct looked old and seemed built
with massive stones that made me think of the pryamids. This place was
hard to see from the tracks you had to climb down a steep incline through
the woods.</B>
<BR><B>It was a rough climb down, but once you reached the bottom the trip
was worth it. It was like being in another world or traveling back in time.
There was a wide creek that flowed through the viaduct and pooled at the
entrances so you had a deep pond of water at both ends of the tunnel with
swift running water.&nbsp; Couple this with being in the middle of nowhere
and that soothing sound of running water in a natural setting and in the
middle of a forest and you have a scene right out of a mystical adventure.</B>
<BR><B>This place, this magical place was where I spent a lot of my time
as a child.&nbsp; I remember the last time, as a child, that I had went"down
the tracks" with my closest friends. As always we were talking about nothing
usually the latest comic book or the neat new tv show or movie. We went
to our place. We played war and did some discovering. We always found something
new whenever we went.</B>
<BR><B>I couldn't put my finger on it but there was something different
about today. It had been bothering me as soon as my</B>
<BR><B>foot had hit the stones that the tracks rested on. I acted as if
nothing was wrong and still did the fun stuff and had a good time as I
remember. There was still that gnawing in the back of my head that felt,
not was spoken, but felt that something was different or had changed. My
feelings seemed to be wrong as the day went smoothly, we played for hours
and rested by the creek. I loved to just sit and listen to the water running
over the small waterfalls that formed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
sky started to darken and we knew it was time to start heading for home.
I knew it would take a good half-hour to an hour for us to walk home so
we almost always timed it so we would get home right as the streetlights
would come on. We made the climb back up to the tracks and started to head
home.</B>
<BR><B>On the way home we have to pass by an old business that looks like
a foundry. It also looked as if the forest had</B>
<BR><B>claimed the land back. The foundry was overgrown and old and right
by the tracks. If any building looked haunted this one did. We walked by
it without incident though. We had just reached the edge of town and someone
shouted "TRAIN". We didn't panic though, you could get off the tracks virtually
anywhere so we didn't think anything of it, that is until we turned around
and looked.&nbsp; There was the light, I didn't see a train but we did
see the light.&nbsp; Well that's all it took, kids went everywhere everyone
started running for the lowest area to get off of the tracks, everyone
that is except for me. I was just staring at this light. It didn't seem
right to me. It didn't look like the headlight of an oncoming train, I
had seen plenty of those. No, It looked more like.... a lantern. It was
a lantern, I remember that it struck me as very strange. It looked like
one of those old style lanterns that you see in the old movies with a big
handle and fire for the light. So I stood gazing at this lantern that was
getting closer. It was then that the voice came it said "Please stay, come
back, don't leave". It was at that point I got very scared and took off
running. Now I was an overweight child and picture this overweight kid
catching and passing his much thinner counterparts beating them home.&nbsp;
I don't think I ever told anyone what I had seen or heard that day. I know
now why that day seemed so different. I don't think it was because of the
strange phemonena that I had witnessed and heard. It was the last day that
we as children had went down those tracks and just enjoyed the beauty of
what was there. It sure seemed as if that whatever spoke that day realized
that and the voice as I remember now had a sort of sadness to it.&nbsp;
I walked back to that magical place as a man of thirty-something. It hasn't
changed much. Except it seems shorter and some industries have sprung up
which have pushed the limits of town west a little bit so that magical
place is becoming a lot less remote. It still reminds me of my youth and
I will walk back there again. I did not see anything, but I sure felt like
I was being watched but I enjoy it there maybe someday I will know what
was there that day.</B>

<BR><B>The Boy ( my own true story)</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: SurfingFairy13@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I'm thrteen, and recently found out a story that happen to me when
i was three.</B>
<BR><B>I lived in an old two story house with my family in Nevada.</B>
<BR><B>When you frist walk into the house your in a large living room.
On the side is a brick fire place then a few steps, that lead up to a steap
staircase, to a door that led to my older brothers room.</B>
<BR><B>Undernieth the stair case, was my little hide out, which was always
dark, and my mother use to put toys in there for me to play with.</B>
<BR><B>Then there was a hall way&nbsp; that led to two other rooms, and
my mothers room, which was rather very large.</B>
<BR><B>On the other side of the hall way led to the kitchen, then a open
door way which led to the laundry room, and a back door to the back yard.</B>
<BR><B>Well since i was little my mom use to do laundry and cook, and i
use to follow her bringing my toys.</B>
<BR><B>My favorite place to play was in the laundry room, talking to someone
like my own age playing with each other. I would also go up to my brothers
and mother saying there was alittle boy in the laundry room.</B>
<BR><B>Of course they never believed me. Untill my mother found out the
history of the house. The family that lived their before us has a son about
my age. that use to play in the laundry room.</B>
<BR><B>Well one day the boy found his fathers gun, and started playing
with it. The gun went off. We think the boy died in the laundry room, but
my mother wasen't for sure.</B>
<BR><B>When we moved, i remember sitting down, and feeling a deep sadness
coming over me, like i'm forgeting something, forgetting a friend.</B>
<BR><B>I never remembered the boy, but i do remember playing in the laundry
room, and the sadness that came over me.</B>
<BR><B>Their's also another story about the boy. That him and his brother
were playing in the laundry room and the gun went off killing one of them.</B>
<BR><B>I also believe the stairs were haunted because two of my older brothers
fell from them and i. Which could of lost our blance but, it was kinda
werid how almost each one of us fell.</B>
<BR><B>Thank you for listening to my story.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: gromit@profile60.fsnet.co.uk</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Andrea and 22years ago my sister Susan died tragically
in a car accident. When she died I felt like my life was over too as we
were best friends, we did everything together.</B>
<BR><B>Eight years ago when I was going through a difficult time in a relationship
a good friend sent me 2 dozen red roses to cheer me up. I was arranging
them in vases and my best friend Debbie was in the room watching tv when
I began to walk into the room with the first vase of roses, suddenly this
figure walked passed me and through the room. Debbie screamed what's that
and then I can't really explain what happened next. I know I did not say
these words but words came out of my mouth saying " its Sue come to look
at the lovely roses ". I was still for a moment feeling so calm but I definately
know I didn't say those words. Debbie was very upset crying saying she
wanted to go home. I assured her not to be frightened I told her Susan
wouldn't hurt her. Since that day many things have happened which just
reassures me that she is with me especially when I need her.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:cangel1576@snet.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I used to be much more receptive and my many stories come to you
from over</B>
<BR><B>the years and families experiences.</B>
<BR><B>The earliest experience I can remember was when I was about eight.&nbsp;
Though</B>
<BR><B>my mother said I was always talking to people and they weren't just</B>
<BR><B>invisible friends.</B>
<BR><B>General happenings that were consistent as when I was young was,
shutting</B>
<BR><B>doors, squeaking floor boards, voices calling out your name when
no one was</B>
<BR><B>around and light bulbs always blowing out.&nbsp; The attic was a
full walk up</B>
<BR><B>attic and the noises up there alone were enough to send someone
packing.</B>
<BR><B>The hallway to the stairs was always ice cold and sometimes someone
would</B>
<BR><B>actually tap&nbsp; you on the shoulder.</B>
<BR><B>My first memory was around six years old when I woke up and saw
horses</B>
<BR><B>running through my room.&nbsp; I told my mother about this and she
believed me</B>
<BR><B>and told me to keep her informed if anything else happens.&nbsp;
Then when I was</B>
<BR><B>about ten years old I saw Native Americans sitting around a fire.</B>
<BR><B>As I got older things were more directed at me.&nbsp; Into my teens
I would wake</B>
<BR><B>up at night and my bed would be shaking.&nbsp; There was a little
girl that would</B>
<BR><B>often appear and she tended to scare other members of the family
if they</B>
<BR><B>harmed me.&nbsp; My sister one morning threatened me because I broke
something of</B>
<BR><B>hers.&nbsp; In order for me to get into my room you had to go through
my sisters</B>
<BR><B>room.&nbsp; Anyway, she woke up and saw a light and watched a little
girl start</B>
<BR><B>to walk to my room, only thing is the girl wasn't walking, but hovering
and</B>
<BR><B>gave her an evil look.&nbsp; My sister freaked out.&nbsp; Then later
another time we</B>
<BR><B>fought she sensed the girl above her and heard her laughing in an
"evil" way</B>
<BR><B>my sister couldn't open her eyes but saw a bright light hovering
above her.</B>
<BR><B>I have a thousand but will go on to tell you the most bizarre.</B>
<BR><B>I was about 14-15 when my sister and her husband at the time moved
back into</B>
<BR><B>this old haunted house.&nbsp; The back bedroom, lovingly dubbed
the green room,</B>
<BR><B>because of the green tiled carpet on the floor was the one that
always had</B>
<BR><B>the most "activity".&nbsp; My sister, her husband and I were sitting
downstairs</B>
<BR><B>playing cards when my sister expressed how tired she was so she
went</B>
<BR><B>upstairs to go to bed.&nbsp; They were staying in the green room
and had a</B>
<BR><B>mattress on the floor.&nbsp; With in two minutes we hear a blood
curdling scream</B>
<BR><B>and I ran upstairs, afraid that she was hurt.&nbsp; When I got upstairs
I turned</B>
<BR><B>on the light in the first room and then looked towards the door
to the green</B>
<BR><B>room.&nbsp; There was a haze and when I ran through the door there
was a feeling</B>
<BR><B>of being sick and a stench.&nbsp; My sister was screaming about
the bugs that HE</B>
<BR><B>was in the bugs.&nbsp; When I looked to the ceiling there was a
ton of black bugs</B>
<BR><B>and flies on the ceiling.&nbsp; I suddenly started screaming to
the door for him</B>
<BR><B>to leave her alone, leave her alone.&nbsp; My sister looked like
she had slipped</B>
<BR><B>into some form of insanity.&nbsp; I had never been so scared.&nbsp;
I yelled and</B>
<BR><B>screamed at the door way and finally I went up to the door in a
furious rage</B>
<BR><B>and screamed, "You are not welcome here go away."&nbsp; A gust of
wind blew</B>
<BR><B>through the room and suddenly the bugs were gone and my sister lay
their</B>
<BR><B>sobbing.&nbsp; She moved out the next day and refused often to even
come and</B>
<BR><B>visit.</B>
<BR><B>I have others and I will be more then happy to send you more.&nbsp;
If at all a</B>
<BR><B>possibility I will write it all out in MS Word.&nbsp; I have also
felt things and</B>
<BR><B>given messages to people.&nbsp; I would like to work on that skill
more, being</B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I have emailed you before about my experiences in my house. i.e.
my children when around the age of 2 1/2 yrs old became afraid of the hallway
and sat at the kitchen table and cried it's or he is there and wouldn't
go near the doorway.&nbsp; (ages of kids are now 5 and 8) I knew that no
one died in my house because the previous owners built it in 1965.&nbsp;
Well, I was telling my neighbor about the time my 8 yr. old (at the time
was 5) was in the bathroom just talking up a storm when I went in and asked
who she was talking to, she said the lady that lived here.&nbsp; I then
said WHO and she said, " You know the lady that lived here she died in
April.&nbsp; I was floored because my mother died in April '87.&nbsp; My
neighbor got white as a ghost when I asked what was the matter.&nbsp; She
then told me that the owners mother got ill around Christmas one year and
they brought her here to live and she died the following April.&nbsp; Since
the kids are older and within the last year I haven't really noticed much.</B>

<BR><B>Short Ghost Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: scott@aecon.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; My story is lame is comparison to those I have read on your
site but it</B>
<BR><B>did not seem so at the time.&nbsp; I think I was about ten at the
time.&nbsp; My</B>
<BR><B>family had moved outside Rochester, NY from California four years
back.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>house was not huge nor old by any stretch of the imagination.&nbsp;
It was a</B>
<BR><B>decent size, two-floor (plus a finished basement), middle income
house.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Well, the only place in the house that I felt creeped out
was in the</B>
<BR><B>basement, and only part of the basement at that.&nbsp; The basement
stairs cut</B>
<BR><B>the basement into two halves.&nbsp; As you went down the stairs,
which were</B>
<BR><B>straight by the way, the left side was finished and was used mainly
by my</B>
<BR><B>brother, my sister and myself.&nbsp; The right side was used mainly
for</B>
<BR><B>storage...but there was a small, unfinished room farther back that
had no</B>
<BR><B>door.&nbsp; This room was used to store my father's tools and such.&nbsp;
It also had</B>
<BR><B>no window and had a pull-string light, so you had to wonder into
the black</B>
<BR><B>space before you could turn on the light.&nbsp; It was only about
ten feet by ten</B>
<BR><B>feet big.&nbsp; I always felt very uncomfortable going into that
room.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;One wall separated the stairs and right side (or as I called
it the "dark</B>
<BR><B>side") of the basement from the left side (the "light side").&nbsp;
There was,</B>
<BR><B>however, a cased opening underneath the stairs that connected the
two sides.</B>
<BR><B>There was only a vinyl, accordion door to close the opening up which
was</B>
<BR><B>never used as we had boxes blocking it.&nbsp; This opening was just
in front of</B>
<BR><B>the tool room.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;One night, during a humid, summer night, I had a sleep over.&nbsp;
We all</B>
<BR><B>decided (about five of us) to sleep downstairs as it was cooler
and had more</B>
<BR><B>room.&nbsp; I am a light sleeper and tend to toss and turn a lot.&nbsp;
Well, from</B>
<BR><B>what I guessed we must have been sleeping a couple of hours or close
to it.</B>
<BR><B>The basement was very dark.&nbsp; I layed there listening to my
friends'</B>
<BR><B>breathing and I could tell they were all asleep, except for me of
course.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I lay there trying to fall asleep when I heard the vinyl,
accordion door</B>
<BR><B>open up.&nbsp; It was not quick but it sounded deliberate.&nbsp;
There was no</B>
<BR><B>mistaking the sound, and it was only about 12 feet away from me.&nbsp;
Needless</B>
<BR><B>to say that I was scared beyond description.&nbsp; Like everyone
else on the site</B>
<BR><B>seems to report, I just clenched my eyes shut and froze.&nbsp; I
could feel a</B>
<BR><B>presence of some kind but it just felt like having someone else
in the</B>
<BR><B>room...a stranger of some sort.&nbsp; It did not feel evil, nor
did I feel like</B>
<BR><B>it was some angel.&nbsp; I just lay there hoping it would leave.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;After a few minutes of no sound, only a feeling of a presence,
I felt I was</B>
<BR><B>about to burst.&nbsp; I finally decided to crack one of my eyes
to see if I could</B>
<BR><B>see anything, not knowing even what to expect or if I could see
in the dark.</B>
<BR><B>Nothing.&nbsp; Then, very suddenly, the presence lifted.&nbsp; It
was there and then</B>
<BR><B>it wasn't.&nbsp; I finally convinced myself that it must have been
my imagination</B>
<BR><B>and I fell asleep.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning I had more or less put the whole
experience out of my</B>
<BR><B>mind as me and my friends had breakfast.&nbsp; But soon after my
friends left (I</B>
<BR><B>did not say a thing to them), I went downstairs again to pick up
my sleeping</B>
<BR><B>bag.&nbsp; Thats when I remembered my experience the night before
and I looked</B>
<BR><B>over at the vinyl, accordion door.&nbsp; It was still open!&nbsp;
We always kept that</B>
<BR><B>door shut because you couldn't use it.&nbsp; We had storage piled
up in front of</B>
<BR><B>it on the "dark side" of the basement.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;That was it for me.&nbsp; I ran up the stairs, turned off
the lights and did not</B>
<BR><B>go back down for quite awhile.&nbsp; I forget how long it took me
but when I did,</B>
<BR><B>nothing ever happened again, though I was always a little uncomfortable</B>
<BR><B>going into the tool room.&nbsp; Thanks for listening.</B>

<BR><B>Shadows</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: heavenlystars66@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I once worked at the Will Rogers Hotel in Claremore, Oklahoma. This
was back in 2000. I worked in the kitchen as an assistant cook. One day
I was washing dishes when I saw a black shadow object from the right corner
of my eye. I went to look twice thinking it was one of the waitress' going
out of the kitchen. But, to my disapointment the swivel doors were standing
still. Needless to say noone had been in there. I left the Kitchen to ask
the waitress if anything had been going on there before? She went on to
tell me that she had been filling glasses and someone had called out to
her but noone was there. The owner has also seen things there before. She
was staying up late one night in the hotels lobby when she looked up to
see someone in a dark suit with an overcoat standing at the stairs. When
she took a second glance, the man was gone. Needless to say I moved on
to another job. To this day I believe the hotel to be haunted.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Scary Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: OLIVERY2K@bright.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was at my cousin, Keon's house. He's four years old, and I was
babysitting him, my other little cousins Lizzy, her baby brother Jimmy,
while our parents were at a party across the street. Lizzy was six and
Jimmy was about two years old. Well, they kept saying they were hungry,
so I called Keon's mom, and she said to order a pizza. When I picked up
the phone, I heard somebody say something like, "The fire will start in
the smallest bedroom on the 2nd floor." Then they hung up, whoever it was.
I got scared. I took my cousins across the street to the party. I told
Keon's mom what happened, and she went across the street to the house,
and stood on the front lawn. Nothing happened. Later, I found out that
before Keon's parents had moved there, something tried to start a fire
in that room, fell down the stiars, broke his leg, and died because of
all the smoke. He had tried to call his friend across the street. I don't
know how we got the call, but we weren't in any danger. I never stayed
in that house by myself again.</B>

<P><B>Real Ghostly Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>Before i tell you of this encounter i would like to inform you, the
names in this text are FAKE as i and my friend would prefer to remain anonomous.</B>
<BR><B>My mom and dad were out of town on this particular night so i asked
a friend round for company.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I asked my friend Dave if he wanted to come for a sleep over
at my house,he agreed as we are good friends and he arrived at around 7:00pm
that night, we watched some movies before going upstairs to bed.</B>
<BR><B>We laid in bed talking as friends do for about 1 hour and a half,
as i was drifting off to sleep Dave shook me violently as if in distress
and said that somebody had scratched his face and ran out of the room,
i didnt believe him but i turned on the light anyway and sure enough his
right cheek was bleeding.I thought at first that he had just caught it
on the light that hangs over the desk next to his bed, but the&nbsp; cut
was too deep, i noticed too that the room was very cold</B>
<BR><B>,i said jokingly that id escort Dave to the bathroom to clean himself
up,&nbsp; he went in the bathroom and shut the door but while i waited,the
hallway light flickered and died, at this point i was getting quite scared,
i told Dave and he just laughed and said it is just a faulty fuse, so i
went to the kitchen and got a new fuse and a stiff drink for myself and
Dave but suddenly the light in the kitchen also died leaving me in the
dark, i called for Dave but he obviously didnt here me as there was no
reply.</B>
<BR><B>Suddenly i felt something brush past me and then snatch one of the
drinks from my hand, i thought it was Dave fooling around so i swore and
told him to stop it, however it soon became apparent that this wasnt Dave
when i heard glass shattering on the kitchen floor, i froze believing i
was dealing with a burglar but suddenly the light s flickered back on and
i was alone and nothing could be heard apart from Dave shouting me, i checked
all the windows and doors but nothing was disturbed, suddenly it came to
my attention that my kitchen mirror which is horizontal and covers most
of the wall was hanging unaligned so i went to straighten it but out of
the corner of my eye i saw looking back at me a figure in a black vail
i turned but i was alone, it was strange that it was the anniversary of
my grandfathers death, to this day no other disturbances have happened
and the mirror has been removed from the kitchen .</B>
<BR><B>But it still remains prominent in our minds.</B>

that Murrieta Valley high school is haunted. Well I can tell you want I
say while I went there.</B>
<BR><B>Once when I was a freshman I was in the theatre and I saw a shape,
it was dark and see threw. I felt cold but not unwelcome.&nbsp; Then when
I was in the 11th grade I was again in the theatre and I was laying on
the stage and the lights above me were moving and as the schools lighting
tech I knew that they could not move under the power of wind. Some one
or thing was up there.</B>
<BR><B>Now the creepy one. My last year there we had a lot of things disappear
and then right in the middle of a production we found a hang mans noose
hanging from the cats walk. No one knew who would have put it there but
the teachers were all mad.</B>
<BR><B>There is lots of little thing that have happened in the theatre,
lots of things during shows would go missing and then reappear after the
show was over. Lights would move under there own power and other things.</B>
<BR><B>My ex girlfriend once told me that at play rehearsal she saw some
one, a person whom had died that previous fall and had just gotten in to
the theatre. One time I was visiting her and I felt this persons percents.
It was eerie but not unfulfilled.</B>
<BR><B>There are lots of other things that happed as well. Friends of mine
threw out my high school career would tell me that they would not go to

<BR><B>Quarantine Station</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Joy.Keegan@crsrehab.gov.au</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was about 4 years old we moved to a place in Sydney NSW called
the Quarantine Station. This was the place that any boats that had diseases
on them would go as they came into Sydney Harbour. Everyone was taken off
the ship, the sick people taken to the hospital and everyone else was placed
in sleeping quarters according to class.</B>
<BR><B>We moved there because they were restoring all the old buildings
and my dad was the foreman of the project, and just about everyone who
lived there over this period has some sort of story to tell about their
experiences with the paranormal.</B>
<BR><B>Our cottage was next door to the old superintendents cottage which
was vacant, run down and so creepy that I refused to even go in there.</B>
<BR><B>After we had been living there for about 6 months my pop got very
ill and had to have a triple bypass. My dad was in bed one night and started
to have really bad chest pains. He woke up and at the foot of his bed was
a little girl. She smiled at him and said "you'll be ok now"&nbsp; and
walked out of the room and his chest pains went away.</B>
<BR><B>About 12 months after this incident a psychic came to talk to the
people who lived there about the experiences that they had had. When my
dad told her his story she pulled out a photo and asked him if the little
girl was in it. Dad pointed to a little girl and said that it was her.
Upon later investigation it turned out that this little girl was the last
superintendents daughter and her and her father had both drowned when a
ferry overturned on Sydney Harbour. This story is still told by tour guides
on the ghost tours that they have there every weekend.</B>
<BR><B>Now for my story. Now don't ask me why but when we moved in I had
picked the room right at the back of the house, the furthest from my mum
and dad's. From the time we first moved there I was always talking about
the face that appeared in my window of a night time. It never scared me
but was more like he was watching out for me.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway after about 4 years we moved to Newcastle and built a house.
When I was about 12 I started to see a man in a long coat and hat in the
house whenever I was there by myself. i would catch a glimpse of this man
as he walked past the door. No one ever believed me until my parents both
saw him as well. Anyway one of mums friends was a physic and when mum took
me to see her see said that i had a spiritual guide who was standing behind
me. Mum and I have both come to the conclusion that both the spirit in
their house and the face in my window when i was a little girl are this
man. My guide has followed me to every house that I have lived in since
and I always feel his presence the strongest when i am stressed out or
alone.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The Little Girl In The Purple Dress</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>First off, let me tell you that I have the hall room closest to
the living room and it the kitchen directly across the hall. My computer
I am typing on right now is left wall, and if you look at my dresser (on
the North wall) there is a big mirror, if you have the door open you can
see out into the hall. On the day my experience happened my friend was
over, so I had an extra chair in my room from the kitchen table. There
is four chairs from the kitchen table, but only three when she was over.
So here is my story:</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; One day (about 2 days ago) I was on this computer reading
some "ghost stories", when out of the corner of my eye I saw what looked
like a little girl in a purple dress run by my room really fast I just
got a glimpse of her. It looked like she had brown hair, and looked about
6 years old. I asked my friend Taylor if she saw it and she just said "What?"
So by that time I was freaked out (this all took place in about 2 minutes),
but I decided to go see what it really was. I ran into the living room
and found my dog sleeping on her "chair". So I ran into the kitchen with
Taylor behind, and she is totally confused, and I ran to the back yard
slide door. It was open, but we ususally leave it open anyway. Anyway the
curtians were moving, and it was not windy. And Casey was sleeping on "her
chair". I ran into the back yard so quick so no one could possibly get
away. I have alot of friends who are boys who like to terrorize the neighborhood.
And they could have never gotten away so quickly! It was really cold, and
it was 81*F, so I had no explanation for why it was cold. I jumped on the
fence and looked over and down the street and into the other neighbors
yards and NO ONE could have gotten away so fast and easy! I went back inside
and stared in horror at the kitchen table. When I said there was 3 chairs
there because one was in my room where Taylor was siting, I meant it, but
right there infront of my eyes was the chair, and it was back where I got
it. I went back in my room, shut and locked the door and me and Taylor
chilled when I noticed that someone turned off my computer. I was totally
freaked out right now so I turned on some music. Oh, and me, Taylor and
my bro Nathan were the only people in the house at this time and Nathan
was working out, so he didnt move the chair or turn off my computer. I
went to go get something to eat. When I got back Taylor was reading my
diary ( I let her for some reason) and the music was turned off. I asked
her what happened she said she thinks the CD messed up cause it just stopped
playing. I checked the radio and CD and it was paused. I thought she was
playing a trick on me, which I later asked her about and she said she didnt
do anything it just stopped playing and she didnt touch it. I asked my
mom if she had experiences with a little girl in a purple dress and she
said yes. She said she saw her one night when my mom was going to bed.
She said the little girl was turning off the light, but my mom never saw
her face. Anyway I saw that girl only one time after that, and it was in
the back yard, and Casey was barking at her. She turned my way and smiled,
and disppeared. She was friendly, and I hope she went to heaven to be with
her family. I later found out that there was a house that burned down by
a stove fire before my house was built. Everyone in the family was killed
instantly, except a little girl, who died in the ambulance. My house is
only about 10 years old. I only pray she went somewhere better. Thanks

<P><B>By: FRITFRAM1@cs.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello, Just to tell you a story I encountered while on Oahu, HI.</B>
<BR><B>I was station at Schofield Barracks(Army station) and moonlighting
as a security guard at the Waikiki Trade Center back from April 97 to October
97. One night as a fellow worker of mine and I were doing our checks on
the 22 and 21 (22nd and 21st floors were free of tenants!)we were on the
20th floor exit well,when all of a sudden, the 22nd floor door opened and
slammed shut!! Now mind me, it was at midnight and there were no tenants
in the building at all!!!!</B>
<BR><B>After talking to a parking lot attendant, he told me that a older
lady had died of a heart attack about six years prior!!!</B>
<BR><B>Another time while trying to take the elevator from the six to the
1st floor, I went up to the 22nd floor!!!! I hit the first floor again
and went to the six floor! Afterthe third time, I finally went to the 1st
floor.</B>
<BR><B>There are many ghost stories I can tell you from personal experiences,
if you are interested, reply to me.</B>

<P><B>Papa</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: keasler@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Love the site. I have only recently gotten into this kind of thing
but I</B>
<BR><B>love reading about these experiences. I have never, to my knowledge,
been</B>
<BR><B>able to see or feel things like the ones described on your site,
and quite</B>
<BR><B>frankly I hope I never do. Anyway, on to my story. This happened
to my</B>
<BR><B>grandmother and my aunt. The first experience occurred not long
after the</B>
<BR><B>death of my Grandpa whom we called Papa. My grandma had some kind
of</B>
<BR><B>repiratory attack while alone at home, and some how managed to call
my dad</B>
<BR><B>on the phone. He then called 911 and he and my aunt wound up at
her house at</B>
<BR><B>about the same time. Later on, my aunt said that while the paramedics
had</B>
<BR><B>been "working on my grandma," that Papa was standing at the end
of the bed</B>
<BR><B>watching over them all. She said he was wearing pajamas as he stood
there</B>
<BR><B>and described the pajamas as the ones he was wearing when he died,
(died in</B>
<BR><B>his sleep) although she had not seen him the morning he died nor
had she</B>
<BR><B>ever seen those pajamas. My aunt has always claimed to see things
like</B>
<BR><B>ghosts or what not. Anyway, one more experience that just involved
my</B>
<BR><B>grandma. She said for a few weeks after Papa died that she could
smell his</B>
<BR><B>cologne all throughout the house. One morning she was lying in bed
and felt</B>
<BR><B>a light kiss on her cheek. After that she no longer smelled the
cologne.</B>
<BR><B>Maybe Papa was watching over her because it was the first time they
had ever</B>
<BR><B>been apart. Maybe they were just "seeing things." I don't know,
but I hope</B>
<BR><B>that wherever Papa is he is happy and in good health.</B>

<BR><B>Mysterious Knock</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:pcdp@brain.net.pk</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have been reading stories from your site for a while now and decided
to finally jot down a few stories I have heard and experienced. I was born
in Hampshire UK but am settled now in Pakistan. I have always been interested
in the paranormal and I think most women on my mothers side have some
kind of ability to sense things, including my mother. One of my mothers
aunties was a spiritualist though only an amateur one. My first real contact
with the paranormal was in a village called Bishopstoke, about 10 miles
away from where we lived. This is about when I was ten years old and a
friend of mine used to live in a big mansion called Bishopstoke Manor.
I am not sure of the history of this building but it was certainly 100
years+ old. It was built on many acres of land next to a river and was
a three-storey house with adjoining cottages and was quite an impressive
place. My friends grandfather was a doctor and used this mansion as a
private hospital where his wife worked as the administrator. The place
had a history of being haunted and once it even made the local papers when
the doctor and his wife observed an apparition. First the doctor saw an
old man disappear in front of his eyes in one of the ground storey rooms.
Thinking he was losing his mind (he way quite aged) he kept quiet until
his wife came to him one day saying that she though she was going crazy
since she had just seen an old guy disappear in front of her eyes. The
description and location of the encounter was exactly the same and somehow
the press heard about it and it appeared in The Echo though I can remember
which year this was.</B>
<BR><B>After the doctor died the family moved out of the mansion and into
a modern bungalow next to it and the building was turned into an nursing
home and as far as a know, no other apparition was observed. However, whenever
my mother visited she would get a headache and feel nauseous. The second
she left she felt fine. Very strange.</B>
<BR><B>Okay, now to Pakistan. I am a wildlife researcher and focus on the
outer Himalayas. These mountains have many folklore and stories attached
to them and they have a feeling of immense age. My team was working in
Ayubia National Park one spring when this incident happened. We where staying
in a small building which consisted of two rooms that formed an L-shape
and a verandah that completed the square. From the verandah you could look
left, straight out into the forest since the building was situated on the
edge of a cliff. Directly in front of the house was small lawn and to the
right of it was another building and another lawn about two feet higher
than the level of the building we were staying. To make it simpler for
you to understand, there was only one direction to enter the building and
that was straight in front across the lawn or you could climb a vertical
cliff in you wanted to and hop over the fence straight into the verandah.</B>
<BR><B>We were experiencing late snows in March and couldnt conduct much
wildlife surveys but were waiting for the weather to clear up. Since there
is not allot to do on top of a mountain in the evening, we usually slept
early. One night at about 2200 hours I was lying in the bed when I heard
a knock on the door of the other room. I heard the door open, then after
5 minutes or less it closed again. I was only half awake and thought nothing
of it, presuming it to be one of the local staff coming for a chat.</B>
<BR><B>The next morning I woke up, looked outside to be confronted with
on foot on fresh snow. We all got up and were eating breakfast when I remembered
about the knock on the door. I asked one of the staff who it had been and
he the first thing he asked me was whether I knocked the door, I replied
no and pointed out that it would have been difficult for me to open my
door, knock on his and return so silently. He believed me but was looking
pretty disturbed. On asking why he told the following. Being quite a heavy
smoker, he was up late having his last smoke. The rest of the team was
asleep when there was a knock on the door. He didnt think it was me because
when you open the door latch on both the doors they make quite a noise.
Since he was quite near to the door the time between hearing the knock
and opening the door was a matter of 15 seconds. When he opened the door
there was no one there. He checked if it was me but the lights were off,
the other thing that was starting to bother him was that he swore he heard
footsteps walk onto the verandah, and this is where he got worried. If
someone had come onto the verandah he or she would have crossed the garden
which was under a few inches of fresh snow. However, there were no foot-prints-none.
He looked around for any sign or anywhere someone could have entered or
could be playing a practical joke, but couldnt find anything. There was
no wind that night and the door rattled when it was knocked. To this day
we dont know who or what knocked on the door but I dont think it was
human.</B>
<BR><B>I have other stories but will leave them for another evening.</B>

<P><B>My Weird Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: AfAiNtWhisPeR66@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ive had some pretty weird experiences in my life, and when i found
this website, i had to tell them to you, here it goes...</B>
<BR><B>When i was about 11 or 12, i was in my room laughing and telling
scarey stories and dreams to my friend.&nbsp; Well, out of no where, my
radio just turns on to this weird station.&nbsp; It was fuzzy, but you
could make out the slightest hint of a mans voice then a low moaning sound
and then a mans husky voice again.&nbsp; My face pailed along with my friends
as i looked over to her and asked, "Did you turn that on? Is the remote
for the radio anywhere?" and she shook her head and we ran out of the room
as fast as we could.</B>
<BR><B>In my house, my Grandmother died in her room, which is down the
hall and to the left of my room. Well at night, it was a usual habbit that
my Grandmother would get up at 1 am and walked to the kitchen and open
the fridge to fill a cup with ice.&nbsp; Well, a few months after my Grandmother
had past away, my room would get colder than normal and i'd see shadows
passing by the foot of my bed and in my mirror's reflection.&nbsp; Then,
i would hear my grandmothers door open, and feet shuffling down the hall,
a fridge opening and then ice being dumped in a bucket. My heart stopped
and so did my breath as i'd dare to get up out of my bed and peek out my
door to find nothing there.</B>
<BR><B>Then, one night while i was lieing in my bed flat on my back, i
felt a hand go to my neck, and as if somthing was pinning down my hands
and knees. My eyes flew open, and i knew i was totally awake because i
could move my eyes around and see, but i couldnt move at all!!! i was so
scared as i tried to scream or move but i couldnt then i heard a whisper
and somthing let me go and i sat up quickly to find nothing there, but
i knew i senced a presence in my room...</B>
<BR><B>Right after that experience, i got up enough courage to lay back
down in my bed and sleep (I was 14 at the time, i am 15 now)...Well, i
layed on my side this time, curled into a half ball and tried to go to
sleep, but i knew i felt more than one presence in the room this time.
Then, my eyes flew open as i felt a force push me off my bed and&nbsp;
I hit my back against my wall and fell to the floor.&nbsp; When I got up,
i noticed all my covers were on the floor and so were my pillows and i
ran out of my room as fast as i could.</B>
<BR><B>Then, one night when i was 13, i have a lil dolphin music box/snow
globe think right on my nightstand beside my bed.&nbsp; I was in a deep
sleep, but i felt a stirring and i woke up and then my Music box suddenly
went off, playing a different type of music than it really did...and i
collect windchimes which i hang from my ceiling beam.&nbsp; No windows
were open and no wind was coming from anywhere, but i saw my windchimes
movies and making noise, and then more black figures passing the foot of
my bed.&nbsp; I covered my head with my covers and shut my eyes tight praying
they would go away.</B>
<BR><B>To this day, there are still some weird stuff going on in my house...</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Uncle</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: katherine.vanschaffel@ramstein.af.mil</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm in USAF and I live in Germany.&nbsp; When I first
was</B>
<BR><B>got here I received&nbsp; news that my uncle had passed away due
to an over dose.</B>
<BR><B>So my husband and I flew to Michigan to attend the funeral.&nbsp;
We had been up</B>
<BR><B>for over 24 hours by the time the funeral was over so we asked on
of my</B>
<BR><B>uncles if we could crash at his place.&nbsp; Well before we went
to bed I asked</B>
<BR><B>him to wake us up at 9 o'clock.&nbsp; Well when 9 o'clock rolled
around I heard</B>
<BR><B>someone say my name so I woke up.&nbsp; At the time I did not realize
it because</B>
<BR><B>I had fallen back asleep that there had been no one in the room
and my</B>
<BR><B>husband was still asleep.&nbsp; I brushed that situation off thinking
that my</B>
<BR><B>mind was playing games on me.&nbsp; So my husband and I went out
to my</B>
<BR><B>grandfathers to stay for the remainder of the time that we were
there.</B>
<BR><B>While at my grandpa's house My husband actually saw my dead uncle
while he</B>
<BR><B>was putting away groceries and I felt the stair case shake once
or twice</B>
<BR><B>while I was outside smoking.&nbsp; Okay so maybe my uncle just wanted
to say good</B>
<BR><B>by I could live, but once we got back to Germany strange things
began to</B>
<BR><B>happen we would hear voices and see a shape in the kitchen.&nbsp;
About a month</B>
<BR><B>after we returned my husband was called away so I was by myself
and for the</B>
<BR><B>majority of the time he was away nothing happened, but two days
before he</B>
<BR><B>returned I was in the living room and heard my name being called
from</B>
<BR><B>somewhere I went outside to check who had said it but no one was
there so I</B>
<BR><B>went back inside and sat down.&nbsp; All of a sudden the room went
cold and there</B>
<BR><B>next to me was my dead uncle.&nbsp; I was so scared that I went
to a friends</B>
<BR><B>rooms.&nbsp; After that night nothing happened maybe he did just
want to say</B>
<BR><B>goodbye.</B>

<BR><B>My Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: liztweet@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Here is my story.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've always believed in ghosts and
my husband always thought I was crazy for thinking that way, but he found
out for himself that I am not crazy about the things I've told him about
our house.</B>
<BR><B>We bought this house in August of 2001 and when we bought it the
whole second floor was gutted out and ready for remodeling.&nbsp; I had
to take pictures for the bank for our loan. And when I got the pictures
back I noticed "orbs" in almost all of the pictures, but the picture that
really caught my eye was the pic of our bedroom.&nbsp; On the wall near
the window, was a face, You can clearly see the facial features of this
person.&nbsp; And its not a reflection because the walls were bare down
to the wood lathe.&nbsp; After the remodeling started is when little things
started happening around here.</B>
<BR><B>I would go into the kitchen and find a cupboard door open,&nbsp;
At first I didn't think anything of it until one morning I walked into
the kitchen and all the doors were open.&nbsp; My dog barks like crazy
in the basement of the house.</B>
<BR><B>But this is what got my husband to beleive that something or someone
else was in the house too.</B>
<BR><B>He woke up in the middle of the night two nights ago and heard a
little girl laughing,&nbsp; At first he thought it was our youngest daughter
but when he opened his eyes he saw a little girl standing at the bottom
of our bed holding a doll in her arms.&nbsp; She looked at him and laughed
again and ran out the door and disappeared into the hallway.&nbsp; He got
up and went into our little girls room and seen that she was sound asleep
in her bed.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I have always heard things upstairs and when I would go up
there there would never be anyone up there.</B>
<BR><B>My middle daughter also heard a girl.&nbsp; First she heard her
scream and then start to laugh.</B>
<BR><B>And like I had said before,&nbsp; there are orbs in pictures of
all the rooms except for two rooms,&nbsp; the first floor bedroom and first
floor bathroom.</B>
<BR><B>The pictures of all the other rooms has an orb in it someone on
the picture.</B>
<BR><B>But as long as nothing bad starts happening to my family, He, she,
or they can stay here for as long as they want.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Son and His Friend</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: obies@mail.connectforless.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have a story to tell.&nbsp; I was just reading about children and
ghosts and would like to share my exsperiance.&nbsp; My husband and I bought
a home and moved in with our son David who was about five at the time.&nbsp;
After living in this house for several months we noticed that David was
talking to someone and he said it was his friend.&nbsp; Of course we called
this friend his imagenary friend for sometime until we noticed some strange
things about this friend.</B>
<BR><B>David said her names was Jerran and she was a little girl.&nbsp;
Now this didn't surprise me until he said that she had a last name too.&nbsp;
It was Keck.&nbsp; I thought okay I have never known of anyone that has
an imaginary friend with a last name and thought this was a little off.</B>
<BR><B>David also began going into details about what she looked like.&nbsp;
My son has always been crazy about girls with long blonde hair so I thought
that this is what she was going to look like but that wasn't the case.&nbsp;
She had long curly hair he said.</B>
<BR><B>This began to be a game with us and we started to believe that David's
friend wasn't just in his mind at all.</B>
<BR><B>We would ask him is she was there and sometimes he would say yes
and sometimes no.&nbsp; Often when we were in the car he would say that
she was right outside of his window going along with the car!</B>
<BR><B>At the same time I began noticing that my car keys would come up
missing just to turn up back where I thought they were.&nbsp; Often late
at night I would be in the bathroom with the door open and hear footsteps
going down the hall and when I went to ck it out and noone would be there.&nbsp;
But I dismissed all of this to my mind playing tricks on me.&nbsp; But
then something happened that made everthing come together and make a whole
lotta sence!&nbsp; I could look down my hallway and see into my sons room
at the end as well as our room.&nbsp; We had a lamp that you could also
see.&nbsp; I noticed one day that it was on and went to turn it off and
left.&nbsp; Only to notice a little while later that it was back on.&nbsp;
I was the only one in the house at the time but thought it wasn't anything
and shut it back off.&nbsp; But this time halfway down the hall I turned
back around to notice that it was back on!&nbsp; I was a little spooked
at the time but went ahead and turned it off again and it was back on when
I turned back around in the hallway.&nbsp; I then thSo now I believe and
everyone else in the family believes that David's friend is a ghost of
some sort.&nbsp; We then really started asking questions and over a period
of about a year we found out a lot about Jarren.</B>
<BR><B>David said that she lived in the walls of his room but that sometimes
she would go up a staircase into the clouds outside.&nbsp; One day he was
playing in his room and it seemed he was talking to more that one person.&nbsp;
When I asked him about it he said that Jerran has brought some of her friends
to play.</B>
<BR><B>When then got up enough nerve to ask David how Jerran had died and
he at first just told us that we didn't want to know.&nbsp; But eventually
he told us that she had been killed somehow with a blow to her head.</B>
<BR><B>We went on vacation that year and Jerran didn't come with us David
said that she had to stay at home.&nbsp; But as soon as we came back things
went back to normal.&nbsp; Jerran stayed with us for about a year maybe
longer before we noticed one day that David no longer spoke of her.&nbsp;
David told us that Jerran went away to California and wouldn't be back.&nbsp;
Things in the house had stopped moving and the walking in the hallway was
not heard agian.&nbsp; I truly believe that for whatever reason Jerran
was a spirt of a little girl that was fond of my son and like playing with
us sometimes too.</B>

<P><B>My Own Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: cpredhead@yahoo.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was in high school, I spent a lot of time at my</B>
<BR><B>friends place.&nbsp; She and her parents lived in a very</B>
<BR><B>old house in an older neighbourhood...not far from my</B>
<BR><B>childhood neighbourhood.</B>
<BR><B>My freind and her parents were told by neigbours that</B>
<BR><B>there was an elderly woman that lived in their house</B>
<BR><B>for many years, and eventually died in the house.</B>
<BR><B>There was some peculiar incidents that they told me</B>
<BR><B>about, such as occasionly being met with the odour of</B>
<BR><B>onions cooking in the middle of the night.&nbsp; But both</B>
<BR><B>my friend and I had experiences in the basement that</B>
<BR><B>neither of us will forget.</B>
<BR><B>This house had a typical spooky basement, complete</B>
<BR><B>with a cover well, a tiny coal room and old wooden</B>
<BR><B>stairs with no backs on the steps.&nbsp; One winter my</B>
<BR><B>friend a broken arm and didn't feel like going out of</B>
<BR><B>town with her folks, so I stayed at her place to help</B>
<BR><B>her out for a few days.&nbsp; On one of those nights, I</B>
<BR><B>went to go feed her two cats.&nbsp; The cat dishes were at</B>
<BR><B>the top of the basement stairs and the cat food was</B>
<BR><B>stored on a small shelf above the stairs... to get to</B>
<BR><B>it, you had to go halfway down the stairs.&nbsp; I did so,</B>
<BR><B>turned around while still halfway down the stairs and</B>
<BR><B>started putting food in the dishes.&nbsp; My friend was in</B>
<BR><B>the living room, both cats were in front of me, and no</B>
<BR><B>one else was home.&nbsp; All of a sudden I felt someone run</B>
<BR><B>up the stairs and stop on the step right behind me.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>quickly turned around and of course there was no one</B>
<BR><B>there, and of course I freaked out and ran up into the</B>
<BR><B>living room, cat food in hand!</B>
<BR><B>A few years later, my friend was out late one night</B>
<BR><B>and didn't want to wake up her parents going up to her</B>
<BR><B>bedroom.&nbsp; SO she tip-toed down to the basement where</B>
<BR><B>there was a spare bed set up for any visiting</B>
<BR><B>relatives.&nbsp; She crashed out on the bed, but was woken</B>
<BR><B>up about half an hour later by the sensation of a hand</B>
<BR><B>stroking her forehead and the sound of humming and</B>
<BR><B>"shhing".&nbsp; She opened her eyes, but didn't see</B>
<BR><B>anything....swung her arm around in the darkness and</B>
<BR><B>didn't feel anyone there!&nbsp; All she had the nerve to do</B>
<BR><B>was shut her eyes and will herself back into sleep.</B>
<BR><B>Sounds like the little old lady that spent so many</B>
<BR><B>years in that house was still around looking out for</B>
<BR><B>the younger people.</B><B></B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: moocow@mb.sympatico.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>At my mom's house, in a small town in Mantiboa was were this story
had tooken place.</B>
<BR><B>I was 17 and my little brother who was 13 had always told me about
ghost's in the basement him and his friends sometimes would come running
up the stairs in a panic. The only thing was they weren't really scared
so i never thought anything of it.&nbsp; I always thought that it was just
a prank they were trying to pull on me. It wasn't that i didn't believe
in them or anything. It was just because i never saw them at the house
we were living in at the time.</B>
<BR><B>But on Aug 17/02 I had stayed downstairs where they were sleeping
that night, (me and my brother have always been close friends) I came in
late and I don't even think they knew I was there. Why I slept down there
i really don't know. In the morning around ten I sat up from the couch
and the basement is really dark and I as I sat there i seen three people
in the middle of&nbsp; basement sitting (sleeping) area and no word of
a lie i woke up Dev and Bren (my bro and his friend) and said can you see
that!!? and they stay laying there and said "we told you." i sat there
staring in astonishment and I could easily see that the three were actually
two men and a girl and it looked like they were dancing.&nbsp; ( i know
it sounds wierd but honest)</B>
<BR><B>As I sat there staring and watching they started to move around
and one of the men came walking around me, that's were i froze and a total
fear of something came over me. Once I couldn't see him behind me I ran
upstairs crying and phoned my mom at work begging her to come home.</B>
<BR><B>After a couple of days my brother went on a trip to visit his dad,
and my mom believed that i saw something. Then the basement light started
to not work and only work when it wanted to. and I had to go throw something
in the washer and of course the light wouldn't turn on so I yelled wake-up
now and as I was shutting the&nbsp; basement door it sounded like a pop
bottle fell and then i quickly opened the door again and the light was
turned on. so i shut the door in fear and looked at my mom who was in the
kitchen and almost crying i said we have dead people in the house. Not
thinking nor meaning what I said.</B>
<BR><B>Now i definetly believe in ghosts and after that i finally had an
explanation for why our dog had never once went or tried to go downstairs.
or when we would bring strays home. Once a puppy and my friends slept down
stairs and in the middle of the night that dog/pup started yellping uncontroably
i even took him outside and he contiued (?)</B>
<BR><B>Now i don't live there but i have two little sisters who do and
they told me that they had saw a man wearing a red and black shirt sitting
on mommies bed. I hope they are friendly.</B>
<BR><B>I have many more experiences about that house that had happened
but this one's long enough.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My House is Haunted!</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: SweetandCuteGirl@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I am an average 13 year old girl, I'm 5'1, I weigh 114lbs, I have
blue eyes,</B>
<BR><B>blonde hair, I'm a cheerleader, oh yeah I almost forgot I live in
a two</B>
<BR><B>story, Victorian home that is painted tan, with green shutters,
and a white</B>
<BR><B>picked fence, and I have a little dog named Eddie,oh yeah my house
might be</B>
<BR><B>the most exspensive and biggest in our small town of Williamsburg,
but what</B>
<BR><B>you and a lot of other people dont know is that its haunted! No
I am not</B>
<BR><B>making this up! My grandmother has lived next to my house since
she was 2</B>
<BR><B>days old, my dad was raised in the same house my grandmother was,
and when my</B>
<BR><B>dad married my mom 25 years ago and they still are, he didn't want
to leave</B>
<BR><B>his mom behind so he bought the house next door, that way he could
still live</B>
<BR><B>and be close to his mom. Ever since I was 4 years old my grand mother
has</B>
<BR><B>told me of the horrific events that took place in my house. She
said it was a</B>
<BR><B>shock to her and the rest of our small town, you see a doctor named
David</B>
<BR><B>Smith lived in the house before we did, my grandmother was just
13 years old</B>
<BR><B>when it happened, David smith, was a 42 year old, doctor who lived
in my</B>
<BR><B>house with his wife Victoria and their 3 daughters, Emma, Rebecca,
and</B>
<BR><B>Elizabeth.</B>
<BR><B>Emma and Rebecca were identical twins the same age as my grandmother
13,</B>
<BR><B>Elizabeth was 2 years old, their nany Carolyn Howard. Carolyn was
from</B>
<BR><B>England, she was sent by David's father to take care of his 3 granddaughters.</B>
<BR><B>You see by during the birth of Elizabeth their mother VIctoria had
a hard</B>
<BR><B>labor and became very sick after her daughter's birth and when Elizabeth
was</B>
<BR><B>just 7 months old her mother died! Her two sister didn't know how
to care for</B>
<BR><B>a small child, so then David wrote to his father in need of advice,
and his</B>
<BR><B>father sent Carolyn to&nbsp; care for them. Carolyn treated the
children with love</B>
<BR><B>and kindness, so David asked Carolyn to marry him,and she did. After
they</B>
<BR><B>were married David became angery over the smallest mistake and beat
Ca rolyn</B>
<BR><B>badly. But Caolyn hide that from the children, because she did not
want them</B>
<BR><B>to know that side of their father! Time went on and the beating
became worser</B>
<BR><B>and worser until one night in a mad and drunken rage he killed Carolyn,
and</B>
<BR><B>Emma and Rebecca, and then turned around and took his own life!
Elizabeth</B>
<BR><B>surived because she had spent the night with my grandmother! They
say to this</B>
<BR><B>very day you can see the renactments of their bloody murders on
the</B>
<BR><B>anniversery of their deaths! And you can very October the 14th!</B>

<P><B>My Haunted House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: flstc97@ejourney.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My story is not as scary as some storis on here. I live in a little
town in Michigan. I am 12 yrs.old. I have always had a facination with
ghosts. I saw my first ghost when I was 8. It was the day my dog Penny
died. As I walked to my room crying I looked over in my brothers room and
saw Penny and my other dog that died when I was 4, Casper. I was not afraid.
When I blinked they were gone. The scary thing though is the night before
I dreamt Penny got hit by a car.It was a red car in the dream. When I told
my mom about the dream. She was amazed because the car that hit her was
red. Now since then I have had many other dreams but I'll skip to what
is happening now. In all of my dreams I see a lady in an old blue gown.
She never has a face though. and always waves her hand as if to say come
here but when I try I can't move. Other things that happen in my house
is that. When you sit on the couch someone shakes you and won't stop until
you look in the dining room. In my bedroom you can smell womans perfume
and my mom and sister and I don't wear that type of perfume. You also can
somtimes feel someone poking you. I do have an explanation. This town is
very old. Around my house there are 2 graveyards. 1 is an old indian graveyard
and the other is an old pioneer graveyard. In the woods behind my house
there is also an old logging town. I do not believe the spirits here are
bad though. I guess I will never know what haunts my house though.</B>

<BR><B>My Grandmother</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: brdldy962@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>It was a few years ago in 1999 that my grandmother passed away in
September.&nbsp; I had had a very bad month concluding with a suicide attempt.&nbsp;
I have suffered from depression all my life and was undergoing a double
depression which is a low grade depression combined with a deep depression.&nbsp;
The day after my attempt my grandmother passed away while my parents were
coming to the city I was living in to bring me home.&nbsp; They didn't
tell me about it until we were on our way back.&nbsp; I really couldn't
respond to her death at the time due to being numb and not knowing what
to think about anything at the moment.&nbsp; My grandmother had been going
down hill for over a year and I had been feeling bad about not being home
to help my mother with her.&nbsp; My Aunt had come into town to start putting
things together for the funeral.&nbsp; She was staying in Grandma's house
as I was in the extra bed at my parents.&nbsp; When she came into the house
everything was packed in her suitcases including her make-up kit.&nbsp;
After an emotional day of planning with my mother she went across the street
to go to bed.&nbsp; A few moments later she called over to us on the phone
in a bit of a panic.&nbsp; She had come into the house and turned around
to close the door and found some of her make up behind the front door.&nbsp;
There was no sign of entry into the house just a tube of make up behind
the door.&nbsp; I should also tell you that Grandma was very safety conscious
and had all the doors basically double locked except for the front door
which you could double lock from the inside with a flip latch.&nbsp; The
front door is also solid wood and there is no way anybody could get in
to the house through it with out the deadbolt key or unless they hack though
it with an axe.&nbsp; My Aunt was most upset with her discovery as she
had put her make up kit in the bathroom and she doesn't keep any in her
purse.&nbsp; We came over and were able to calm her down.&nbsp; She told
us that she was sure that it was Grandma who placed the make up behind
the door.&nbsp; We checked the doors and found all secure.&nbsp; I looked
over at the door and noticed that the corner by it seemed to be extra bright
and I got a feeling from it that said to me "wait" and then it faded.&nbsp;
I didn't tell either my mother or my aunt this and I am sure that it was
my Grandmother.&nbsp; You see I had had a question that I had asked when
I was at my lowest.&nbsp; "How can I be sure that death is just a door
to another life?"&nbsp; I believe I got my answer and even though I still
deal with my depression every day I am very content to "wait" as my Grandmother
asked me to as I am very secure in the fact that I am here for a reason
and the opening of that door will come in its own good time.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Ghostly Roommate</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: DisneyGal64237@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have lived in the same apartment for the past nine
years in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.&nbsp; When I first moved in I had some
experiences with lights turning off and on "by themselves".&nbsp; I told
my dad and he said to have maintenance look into it.&nbsp; They found nothing
wrong with the electricity.&nbsp; Over the past nine years my "ghostly
roommate" has made his presence known to me and my other (human) roommate
in several ways.&nbsp; I feel this is a male spirit who died in this apartment
at some point before I moved in.&nbsp; I have tried to get information
on the previous tenants from my landlady, to no avail.&nbsp; One night
my best friend and I were using my Ouija board and asked the spirit to
identify himself.&nbsp; We got the name Zachary and that he is/was 27 years
old.&nbsp; We asked him why he remains in the apartment and his reply was
that he had hanged himself in the closet and was very remorseful about
it.&nbsp; He is a friendly ghost and is not very active, but sometimes
will change the channels on the tv or the radio stations.&nbsp; I tend
to stay up late reading, and there have been times when he will turn off
my bedside lamp as if to say, "enough, time to go to sleep now".&nbsp;
He doesn't scare me or my roommate at all, rather, I like having him around,
but told him that he should try to move on.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Ghost Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: pjflory@woh.rr.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I had been watching some movie in my living room and fell asleep
on my couch. I woke up at 1:00 and turned the television off and went back
to sleep. I was woken by the sound of moving silver wear in my kitchen
and then running water from the bathroom that was right in front of me.
I just lied there trying to open my eyes and I couldnt. I figured I was
still asleep but I could actually hear the sound of running water. I just
lied there for a minute asking myself if I could really hear it and I could.
My dad had told me about this little boy that was found dead on Christmas
morning in the bedroom next to mine. I often heard foot steps and furniture
moving up stairs when there was no one there. I had once even heard him
whisper Is he asleep yet? The little boys name was David and he was a
cousin of mine that died before I was born. He just moved into this house
back in the summer. Back to what happened: I was lying there knowing that
there was a ghost in my bathroom and I was fine with it. Then all of a
sudden I felt a force push me into my couch just as every hair on my body
stood up. It wasnt like chills or goose bumps, I mean it was freezing
and you could feel each hair rise. It was the scariest thing I had ever
felt. It was like riding the Gravitron, even my face got pushed back. It
was so weird. I tried to scream but my mouth wouldnt open so I just made
this weird moan which made the little boy laugh and he took off running
up the stairs. I just lied there in silence with my eye closed wondering
what had just happened. After about a minute of being completely stiff
I began to cry. I felt as If I was going to have a heart attack it scared
me so much. I went in my dads room and got in bed with him which I have
never done before. I have never been that scared in my life. I cried for
at least a half an hour.</B>

<P><B>My Ghost Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:tlavigne@sprint.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>Where to start! Well for one thing it's started with my grandmother.
She used to have ghosts around her. One in particular was a man who used
to stand leaning against the door jamb of her room, smoking a pipe. This
went on until her parents changed her bedroom. Another was one time she
woke up yelling that the house was on fire.. her parents ran in and told
her everything was fine... a few hours later in a electrical storm a fire
ball hit the house and the house burnt down.&nbsp; Another time my mom,
her sister and their father went to the store, my grandmothe stayed home
to clean. When my mom, aunt and grand father returned, they found her pale
with a look of panic on her face... when they asked what happened, she
said she was dusting in the bedroom by the window, when she looked outside
she saw a floating hand waving and moving away, when it disapeared the
phone rang, her mother had just died and she had been asking for her!&nbsp;
Those are the major ones with my grand mother. I'm sure more happened but
she probably never talked about it.</B>
<BR><B>Now me and my mother. Things started a few months after my grandmothers
death. The first thing that happened was the swing moving on it's own.
I was in my room , and my mom called for me to come quick... she was in
the kitchen turning on the stove timer, then she took me outside. One of
our swing was moving by itself at a faily quick pace (20 mins according
to the timer). There was no wind, plus the swing beside it wasn't moving
at all... My grandmother used to love swingning with me.Where my mom lives
now is where more things are happening. There is a man and a woman ghost
that we know of. I have seen the woman, she walked by my bedroom door one
night. She had long black hair and she was wearing a wedding dress. The
man has been seen by a few people. He has an attitude problem! He's kicked
my mom's boyfriends chair, he's thrown a boot and a tape measure at my
cat, he's felt up my mom, he rips off the blinds in my moms room,&nbsp;
he's broken the humidifyer, he turns off lights, he's opened the window
in my brothers room where he has a tropical snake.</B>
<BR><B>We've had a friend of the family come over with her baby, she was
unable to go into the family room because he would stare in one corner
a yell. Our cats seem to freak out for "no apparent reasons". My mom smell
a cigar over her left shoulder every so often (I wonder if it's the same
man my grand mother saw!). When she works toilet flush by themselves, toys
appear in the middle of a room that she has just finished cleaning.</B>
<BR><B>I have two identical talking dolls (sleeping Ernie) , but one of
my dolls talks faster than the other one. one morning i woke up to the
both of them saying the same sentence over and over again at the same speed...then
when I moved to my dads, one of them started talking again by itself (on
only one occasion). Every so often I feel someone tap my shoulder.</B>
<BR><B>During the ice storm we had no electricity, we could hear&nbsp;
a man and a woman talking to each other upstairs, and walking around.</B>
<BR><B>We've had a gassy ghost!&nbsp; Sounds ridiculous I know, but it
happened.&nbsp; I was babysitting my brother, he was in bed. I heard a
loud BZZZZZZZ. I went around the house to try and figure out what it was,
couldn't find anything. I went to my room and sat on the side of my bed...
Then there was this loud farting sound... I ran into my brother's room
to get his display maschetee, and I sat in the hall upstairs holding it
until my mom got home. She said I looked pale when she got home,&nbsp;
she kept asking me what was wrong... I finally told her "The house was
farting". Well of couse she and her boyfriend started laughing... She wasn't
laughing anymore at 12pm when it started up again! every half hour until
7 am a loud farting sound. She came to bed with me. That morning I was
in the dinning room (the only thing behind me was the window, I was joking
about the farting sounds, when all of a sudden it did it again right behind
me really loud.... Well I never moved that fast in my life... into the
kitchen in less that 1 second.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well we have many other stories,
but I believe that is enough for now, if you want to hear more... e-mail
me.</B>
<BR><B>Love the site... keep up the good work!!!</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Ghost on Fort Bragg</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Madkatz101@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My family moved onto Ft. Bragg when I was about nine years old,&nbsp;
right before I had to go back to school.&nbsp; I never really liked the
house at first.&nbsp; It was an old apartment building with two stories
that were connected to seven other apartments that were similar to each
other.&nbsp; I first saw our unwelcome guest on some dreary weekend.&nbsp;
My parents were upstairs asleep and my brother was asleep on the couch&nbsp;
while I was left to watch some boring rollerblading show on cable.&nbsp;
When it was off, I went upstairs.&nbsp; I went up the first eight stairs
and got to the landing when I felt like someone was watching me, I figured
that I had woken my brother up, and he didn't want to be left alone.&nbsp;
I turned around and there was a man at the base of the steps just watching
me, and he disapeared a little while later.</B>
<BR><B>I never saw him again, because my family prayed around the house
numerous times, and we even had our pastor and youth pastor over.&nbsp;
At the time I didn't know why we were praying around the house, I had come
to believe that I was just seeing things, because no one else ever talked
about it.&nbsp; It turns out that both of my parents had seen shadows or
men at the bottom of the stairs, but they didn't tell me about this until
about four years later.</B>
<BR><B>Thank you for reading my story, I would like to visit that house
again one day and see if there is anything there.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Ghost Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: budro1978@comcast.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>After reading literally hundreds of stories from your web site, I
have decided to send you my paranormal experiences.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My first experience happened when I was about 5 years old. I had
my own bedroom, and it was down the hall from my parents room. I had one
window in my room, and it had no curtains or shades what so ever. The bottom
of the window was about 5 feet off the ground. The window itself from top
to bottom was about 4 feet. My bed situated directly across from the window
on the other side of the room. Now that I set the scene, let me continue
the story. I woke up one night when I was about 5 years old and for seem
reason felt like someone was staring at me. I rolled over, and saw something
that scared me down to my soul.&nbsp; Standing on the outside of my window
staring at me was a dark entity. It was black, and I mean black. From the
shoulders down, it looked like a well built male, but from the head up
was a different story. It's neck and head looked like and upside down bowling
pin. Also, it had no features. It looked 2- dimensional. The best to describe
it is to say that it looked like some cut out the shadow of a BIG man and
pasted it to my window. I could see the stars, trees, behind it but I couldn't
see trough it. Also, the image FILLED my entire window. It was about 8
FEET TALL!&nbsp; After seeing this horrible image, I ran to my parents
room and told them that there was a man in my window. They told me to go
back to bed because I was just dreaming. Well apparently, my dream didn't
know when to stop because when I tip-toed back down the hall and peaked
around my door and my dream was still standing there looking at me. Now.
This is where I got really brave or really stupid (I still can't figure
it out). I walked up to my bedroom window and looked this think in the
face. After about 5 seconds of looking this thing in the face, that it
didn't have, I had a sudden urge to run, and I did. I ran right back to
my parents' room and slept on the floor at the end of their bed the rest
of the night. I never saw the black entity again.</B>
<BR><B>My second story took place while I was in the Navy. I was stationed
at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center back in 1996-1997.&nbsp; I had
the midnight rover (moving security guard) watch at the Tech. Core building.
This building was built around 1945 and looked like a giant figure 8. Including
my self, there are only three people in this building. The duty chief was
in bed sleeping. The Petty Officer Of The Watch was at his podium (He can't
leave this podium unless I relieve him). As I roved (walked) the first
floor everything was going fine. I literally was whistling DIXIE.&nbsp;
However, as I started to walk up the north stair case, I started to get
this uneasy feeling in the pit of my gut (I would later realize that this
uneasiness is my 6th sense ghost detector, and learn to use it often).&nbsp;
I of course, at this time, didn't pay much attention to it. As I came of
the north stair case on to the second floor,&nbsp; I passed in front of
the U shaped male bathroom. Just as I was passing the door I heard a urinal
flush, so I stopped. At this point, I wasn't even thinking ghost. I was
thinking that some drunk sailor had come in the building to use the phone
and decided to take a quick bathroom break. I also thought that maybe it
was the plumbing. I mean that this building was about 52 years old, and
everything on it was old and falling apart, including the plumbing. I decided
that since I was on the far end of a barely lit building with no weapon,
that I would wait one minute. I figured that if it was a man, I would be
better off to have him run into me, than me into him. However, if no one
came out after that minute, then it must be the plumbing. Well, one minute
came and went and no man, so as I turned on the ball of my feet to keep
walking down the hall, I heard the sink turn on. Now I'm thinking that
someone is in there. I decided to stick with my original strategy of letting
them run into me, but after 3 minutes no one came out. So, I decided to
go in after them. I went in the left door (The side that the sinks are
on) but I saw no one. I walked around the end of the U to the side with
the toilets making sure to look at the sinks and urinals for signs of water,
but all were bone dry. After checking the toilet stalls I went out the
other door and looked down the hall. I saw nobody. Now I start to pay attention
to the feeling in the pit of my gut, and now I'm starting to think ghost.
I'm thinking ghost because I know I heard what I heard, and that there
was no way out of that bathroom without me hearing someone open the door.
The doors to that bathroom squeak so loud that it would take a case of
WD40 to get them to be quiet, but yet I heard nothing except when I went
in and out of the bathroom. As I started to walk down the hall I had the
feeling that someone was about 5 feet behind me looking at me. I couldn't
help but to keep looking behind me every few steps.&nbsp; I started to
walk faster and faster. It got to the point that I was almost at a run.
Why would I still be in this building after what I just experienced? Because
I still had to do my job. Anyway I finally ended up back at the same stair
well I came up on and then went up to the third floor. Even on the third
floor, I had the feeling like someone was right behind me following me.
I decided to cut my rove short on this floor my walking halfway down one
side and then cutting over and walking the rest of the way up the other
side. I went onto the landing of the south stair case. That's when I told
myself to stop and calm down. I decide that I was going to go up the last
flight of steps to the roof and get some fresh air, however, something
else had a different idea. I had never been lightheaded in my life until
that moment for every step I took, I could feel waves of dizziness hit
me like ocean waves. It got so bad that halfway up the stair case, I was
bent over holding onto the rail trying not to fall down. This is where
it gets real strange. That was when I heard a voice in my head.&nbsp; It
was in my own internal voice, but it wasn't my thought. It said, and I
quote "IF YOU TAKE ONE MORE STEP UP THIS LADDER WELL, YOU WILL FALL TO
THE BOTTOM AND DIE". Needless to say I didn't push the subject. I started
to slowly walk backwards down the stairs, all the while holding on to the
rail. Each step I took, I could actually feel the dizziness being pulled
off of me. When my last foot hit the landing I was totally fine. That was
when I said a few colorful words to my invisible host and RAN down to the
first floor.&nbsp; The second I reached the first floor, all the uneasy
feelings I had been experiencing disappeared. Needless to say I NEVER roved
above the first floor the rest of my time at the school. Several other
people had experiences after this but I will save those for another time.</B>
<BR><B>The third ghost experience happened in 2000 on board the USS Cowpens
(CG 63). It happened about a week after I had lost a very very dear friend
and shipmate (coworker)&nbsp; to an accident. It was about 03:00 (AM) and
I was standing the CSMC watch. I had the two water tight doors closed and
sealed. Now since these doors were water tight, logic only tells you that
voices don't come through these doors to easy. Anyway. I was in the room
talking out loud to my departed friend. I started to get upset and angry,
so I started to talk outloud to God. The more I talked the more angry I
got, so I finally ask, "CAN ANYONE UP THERE HERE ME?".&nbsp; Believe it
or not I got a verbal response. The response came as a males voice, in
a whispering tone, but loud enough to fill the whole room, it simply said,
"I CAN HEAR YOU".</B>
<BR><B>Well I hope you enjoyed my stories. Please rest assured that all
of these stories ARE TRUE.&nbsp; I have researched the paranormal since
I was a small child. It is my passion. I have other stories and things
that I decided not to include, but if anyone is interested please email
me and I would be happy to share them with you.</B>
