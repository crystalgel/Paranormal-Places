<p class="MsoNormal">150 Year Old House</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: dreamshepherdess@hotmail.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I grew up in a house in <st1:place>Franklin Park</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house was over 150 years old when my
parents purchased the house in 1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
family lived there until 1985.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During
the almost 30 years we were in the house, we experienced many paranormal
happenings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There were several spirits that lived in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A "soldier" guardian stood watch
outside my sister's and my bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There also seemed to be a young girl in the bedroom closet that was very
sad as well as frightened, we always had the feeling she had been locked in the
closet as a punishment.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There was a young couple dressed in evening clothes that
would regularly appear to my mother, and there was an "evil-tempered"
dog that lived in the attic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Often times objects would disappear from my sister's and my
bedroom, one year, Sue (my sister) received a transistor radio and took it to
bed with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon waking the next
morning it was of course gone...my mother unsuccessfully searched the room,
even changing all of the sheets on both of our beds in an attempt to locate
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother eventually stood in the
middle of the room and in a very loud stern voice said..."I don't care who
took the radio...but BRING IT BACK!"<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The next morning, Sue found her radio in bed with her.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After my parent were both gone, my sibling and I decided to
sell the house.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">NOBODY wanted to empty the attic....it meant having to go up
there.....we decided to leave it for last.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In our dining room, on the mantle was an old lithograph of a young boy
spinning a wheel down the street with a stick.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Along side of this boy was a dog that to a young girl's
mind...looked rather rabid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we were
bringing items out of the house in preparation for a yard sale, I brought the
picture off the mantle, and placed it on the ground leaning against the house
at a substantial angle to prevent it from falling and breaking the glass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went back inside for another arm full of
items and when my sister and I returned outside again, we found the picture
frame lying on the ground, the back of the picture lying approximately 2 feet
from the frame, and the picture of the dog blowing down the street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We returned inside the house - ran upstairs
and immediately felt the presence of the dog from the attic was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When one particular real estate agent came to
look at the house, she asked my brother if he knew there were spirits in the
house...he answered of course, we all grew up with them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(There are of course, many more stories I
could share)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My siblings and I have gone our separate ways but each of us
has upon occasion still felt the presence of spirits that have followed
us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether we are all sensitive to the
proximity of the entity or perhaps just open to the experiences, I don't know...but
I know a spirit when I feel or see one!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">thank you for reading my experiences, and please feel free
to contact me with questions.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I grew up in Far Rockaway, NY.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rockaway, originally named Reckowacky by
Indian tribes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I was a young girl,
my sister Patty, who was sleeping on the bunk above, was crying in the middle
of the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said she saw someone
standing by the bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She couldn't sleep
and was so upset no matter how my other sister and I tried to comfort her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She talked about it for days.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Some 8 years later or so, I was reading a book about
apparitions on <st1:place>Long Island</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was full of stories about Native American
sightings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I suddenly remembered my
sister's experience and how insistent she was.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On a hunch, I wrote her a letter and innocently asked her if she
remembered the time she saw a lady standing by her bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time I didn't mention the book I was
reading, nor did I tell her why I was asking.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I received her reply, I dropped the letter, I was so stunned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She wrote, "I'll never forget the time I
saw the lady standing by my bed...she had long, black braids, and she was
smiling."</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I believe she saw someone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I just came across this site today out of boredom and having
nothing else to read, and with it being a day after Halloween why not?!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any way this is a story about our deceased
pet (and family member) Duke.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got Duke
for my 16th birthday from a friend about 14 years ago now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was always there for me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He protected me from day one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On several occassions he even tried to attack
several of my boyfriends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a good
boy he was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When my current husband met
him for the first time 8 years ago he never, not even once, barked at him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He loved all our children in the same manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we would first bring them home from the
Hospital the first thing he would do is jump in the car, sniff them, then lick
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were such a happy family!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 3 years ago his health started failing,
but his love never died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He started to get
incontinent(un-able to control body function).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One day he started urinating in the floor and we quickly let him out to
finish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 5 minutes later someone
knocked on our door to tell us the horrible news: he had been hit by a speeding
car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He never suffered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think of as an act of God helping him to
stop suffering.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But since that day 3
years ago my husband and I always heard him whine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We never told each other till one day we were
just conversing about this and that and he mentioned it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked at him wide eyed and said " You
too?! ".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And we new he still
watched over us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has continued
since.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In June we got a puppy he looks
almost exactly like Duke.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 2 weeks
after we got the puppy the whining stopped.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But you know something else?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
puppy, who's name is Buster Brown,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>acts
exactly like Duke used to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the point
we even call him Duke!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This past weekend<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
went to <st1:place><st1:placename>Spokane</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Valley</st1:placetype></st1:place>
to visit a friend, and she informed me of the <st1:place><st1:placename>Spokane</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Valley</st1:placetype> <st1:placetype>Cemetery</st1:placetype></st1:place>.
I read about the 1000 staircase and felt like that can be a good challenge. We
got there in the middle of the day. We can feel the vibe there and it was
anything but good.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The cemetery is in 3 levels some parts older than the other.
One spot where the cemetery was unkept and very worn by time were the young and
sick were buried. Who was ever there did not want us there. We were sitting
there in the car when it went on by itself, her foot was no where near the gas,
I thought maybe it was just the car rolling but then it started to accelerate a
little whoever was there wanted us to go and did it themselves. We drove on the
other side of the road where the cemetery was more modern. You can sense the
change in the air. Much more peaceful and calm, almost a welcoming feeling
unlike the older side where it is cold and bone chilling.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was trying to find the staircase which I found camoflauged
in the trees off the side of the road. It definitely wasnt a 1000 steps but
certainly alot of them. I got out of the car and immediately felt a chill
telling me to leave, but I am in the navy and I have Irish in my blood and a
very stubborn man. I claimed up the stairs each time I made it to a landing I
wanted to turn and leave, but I wanted to reach the top. I made all the way to
the top to what looked like a crypt, but I looked inside it looked like
somekind of shed or something I peeked inside and had some street signs and
some tools and other little nicnacs.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Anyways that is my story so apparently I am number 3 or at
lease on record to make it to the top. Luckily I got a witness on this and she
try to do it herself but turned away. So I feel pretty good about that.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Stories from an Englishman</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: A.R.Waller@newcastle.ac.uk </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I've always been a big believer in the paranormal, and have
been lucky enough to have had ghostly experiences in the past.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought it was about time I shared a couple
of my stories with a wider audience as I really feel I've kept them in for too
long.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Experience 1</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I'm from a little town in the North East of England named <st1:place>Hartlepool</st1:place>
(part of <st1:place><st1:placetype>County</st1:placetype> <st1:placename>Durham</st1:placename></st1:place>)
which has been an established town for over a thousand years, as it was once
one of the main sea ports in the country.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There are plenty of ghostly stories and tales repeated around the area,
from the ghostly farmer who scythes corn in the farmland area of the town, to
the ethereal monks whose chanting and voices are heard on the site of an old
monastery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">However, the event that occured to me in <st1:place>Hartlepool</st1:place>
was a different kettle of fish, so to speak.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was the day of my final exams at secondary school (high school) and I
had decided to retreat to an old art classroom at the top of the building as I
knew I could get peace and quiet while I tried to revise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My school isn't particularly old and as I'd
never had any experiences before, I felt content and calm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I settled down to read through my notes when
a few minutes later I heard a sound.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Looking up, the noise stopped as suddenly as it started.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thinking no more of it I once again started
to read, only for the noise to occur again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Only this time it didn't stop. What I could hear were footsteps right in
front of me, footsteps I took to be from a little girl as they were small and
soft, and the definite sound of a high heel could be heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in shock and kept thinking I was
imagining it or the sound was coming from outside the class but as it continued
I knew it was only a matter of metres away and was getting closer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly it stopped and a feeling that I was
being observed swept over me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sat in
total shock as the footsteps started again but they soon got lighter and
lighter until they stopped once and for all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Looking back, I now realise it never scared me, more that I was
enthralled and enraptured than petrified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The sound was definitely coming from right in front of me there is no
doubt about that; it lasted for 20-25 seconds which gave me enough time to hear
and to determine where it was coming from.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The strangest yet most fascinating part was that when I
explained my story to my teacher, who had worked at the school for around 25
years, he told me that I wasn't the only one to have experienced this event,
and that two cleaners had even seen the little girl! I felt priviliged to have
had such an experience.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Experience 2</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A few years ago I went on a lads holiday to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Portugal</st1:place></st1:country-region>
for a week or two of being merry and having a really good time and to get me
away from the bleakness of <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After several days and nights of hard
drinking, me and a friend decided to take a break and spend the night in,
playing cards and having a good chat.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After a while we both felt tired and retired to our beds, which happened
to be in the same room, and I soon felt myself drifting off to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, around an hour later, I woke with a start.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could hear voices but in my grogginess I
couldn't tell what the voices were saying.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I sat back and listened to these voices until I could take in what was
going.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To my astonishment, the voices
weren't talking but singing!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I sat
and listened I could tell the language was Portugese and that rather than one
or two people singing, it was a whole choir!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They all sounded young; boys and girls mixed in together, but they had
the voices of angels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sat listening to
this beautiful music for a while and then turned my head to the side to observe
my friend and to see if he was awake.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His eyes were open with an astonished look on his face, and he turned to
me and said "Can you hear that?" to which I replied "Yeah I
can".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He got up and looked out of the
bedroom door and then out of the window, and remarked that if he stepped into
the living room he could hardly hear the voices but as soon as he went back
into the bedroom they were loud and clear again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We both wondered were the singing was coming
from, as we were staying in an isolated villa with no one around us for miles,
until we both decided that there was no rational explanation and that wghat we
were hearing was paranormal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Taking into
account this was the early hours of the morning, just what was going on? After
a while the voices got fainter and fainter until they just faded away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never heard the ghostly choir again for the
rest of the holiday, and me and my friend decided to keep the experience to ourselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on the plane back to <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
one of our friends remarked about the singing he'd heard on the last night and
if anyone else had heard it? At this, another friend also said he'd heard it
and had also woken up to find a young girl at the foot of his bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have no doubt that this villa in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Portugal</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was haunted, and I once again feel priviliged to have experienced something not
of this world.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It&#8217;s no secret that in my youth, I loved to hike or explore
the woods nearby my family house. After we moved out of the duplex
neighborhood, my parents moved us into our first house. Nice plot of land right
on the corner of the street, the largest yard in the neighborhood. A
neighborhood, at the time, that was surrounded by undeveloped wooded land.
Thick trees, with the absence of the sounds of cars and such. So naturally I
had to explore this new land. This was the beginning of my high school years,
so it was like starting a whole new life after getting this new house. My dogs
loved it, especially when I would take them through the woods with me. The
smallest of my dogs, Rory, loved hiking with me and I trusted his instincts and
nose when it came to trouble. This particular day, I decided to venture a
little further into the undeveloped areas of our new neighborhood. I guess the
company that bought the land kind of ran out of money and left this part of the
road up for grabs. It was a paved street that was blocked off by a keep out
sign like road block. I didn&#8217;t work too well, some kids who could drive would
sneak their cars through and use the empty back road for other &#8220;recreational&#8221;
means. So it was easy for a young teenager like myself at the time to roll in
on his mountain bike. Rory trotted closely behind following me eagerly. We
would travel a bit down the road stopping to check out a creek nearby and
possible trails to mark. Now from what I am told, this entire plot of land the
neighborhood now sits on belonged to one family, then they sold it to realtors.
But since the land was basically open, it was also used for hunting. I would
find old rickety wooden hunters towers built into the trees and what not. They
were so old though, it looked like they haven&#8217;t been used in years, but it was
still cool to explore. Rory and I sped our way to the end of the road where it
turned into a somewhat court. At the end of the road a small creek cut through
the woods right by a clearing. I couldn&#8217;t get passed the thick brush to reach
the clearing so I dropped my bike and continued on foot. Rory followed and
would occasionally dart ahead to sniff things out. It turns out the clearing
was a incomplete lot for a house. But the trail Rory and I found kept passing
through, and we followed it casually. The trees seemed to get taller the deeper
into the woods we got. Then one spot ahead of us caught my attention. It looked
so surreal that couldn&#8217;t believe it was in the woods. Rory and approached the
spot and I notices the trees in the spot are all dead. Not just dead as in no
leaves, but dead as in no lease and completely stone gray. I stood there trying
to understand what I was looking at. There were five tall trees in what I can
tell was perfect circle. In the circle, were leaves, just like in the rest of
the woods, but they were just as dead and gray as the trees. And the trees were
gray all the up as far as I can see. Rory sat at the outside edge of the gray
circle. I decided I wanted a closer look at this strange small plot of land and
stepped into the circle. The leaves cracked and squished loudly as I stepped
in. The air seemed cooler then the rest of the wooded land and the sounds
seemed to just stop. All could hear was my leaf crunching footsteps and Rory&#8217;s
wining. I looked back at Rory to call him to me, but just sat there on the outer
edge watching me. It was very strange and stagnant. I slowly sifted through the
leaves on the ground and found some old rotting two by fours covered by a layer
of rusting chicken wire. I tried lifting the debris but it was thick and the
noise the leaves made were so loud it was almost disorienting. Rory wined and
lightly wiped at me, so I decided to follow his advice and back off. We left
the spot intact and avoided it in the years that came. I would sometimes walk
by the spot on the road to see if there was any change. I could see the dead
trees sitting there, as though they wait for me to venture out there once more.
But I never took another step closer, especially after Rory died of old age.
Now several years much later, that part of my parent&#8217;s neighborhood is
completely developed. Houses decorate the once empty back road as this remote
neighborhood is now a fully active suburb. I went back to find the spot a few
years back, I&#8217;d say about five years ago. Now where the dead gray spot use to
be, a cute two story house sits there. Now I&#8217;m not sure what that spot was, nor
do I have any speculation of what it is, but what I do know is that nobody has
lived in that cute little house for too long. When ever my wife and I would
visit my folks, we would walk past the lot and see it up for sale, every time.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Visiting a Grave Yard</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: esmie@lawofficesoflhl.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I was 19 years old back in 1993, I was dating this
young man and I would go pick him up from high school from time to time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every time I would pick him up, I would drive
down this winding road and pass this old grave yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day after picking him up, he though it
would be fun to stop at the graveyard and take a look.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since, it was just after <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 p.m.</st1:time> I didn&#8217;t think anything could happen besides it
was morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we parked my car in
front of the grave yard and hopped over the small fence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, this fence was not very high at all
anyone could jump over with ease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well,
we started walking around this small graveyard and I mean small like about 10
graves only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we were walking we
noticed that a lot of these graves were really old (1800&#8217;s) and we also noticed
that one of the graves was empty (dug up).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I told my boyfriend that this didn&#8217;t look right (of course) my boyfriend
just thought I was being a girl and continued to look around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that point a heavy wind started to blow
where we were standing, I yell to my boyfriend for us to leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He thought that I was just scared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I then noticed that the trees across the busy
street were not moving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I yelled to my
boyfriend and told him that I was going to the car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I left and was waiting for him by the car and
I continued to yell &#8220;let&#8217;s get out of here&#8221;, I told him to look at me and for
him to notice that the only wind blowing is in the grave yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told him that as soon as I left the grave
yard, I no longer felt the heavy wind.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My boyfriend at that time realized that I was right and decided to
leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stayed the night with my
boyfriend and didn&#8217;t think about the grave yard anymore, until we were getting
ready for bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My boyfriend had went to
the bathroom that is located pass the kitchen and down the hall way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On his way back to the room I heard some
water running from the kitchen and when he arrive to the room I told him that
he left the water in kitchen running.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
boyfriend told me that he never went to the kitchen and he heard the water
running also.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got up and went to turn
the water off and as soon as I got the kitchen (the water was turned off).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I checked the sink and the sink was dry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went to the room and confirmed that he also
heard the water running.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, he just
ignored the incident and got ready for bed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While lying down, I was facing the wall and he was facing toward his
door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of a sudden my boyfriend
starts yelling at me (what?)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told him
(what?) my boyfriend then tells me that I was calling him &#8230;.I told him that I
never said anything and that I am facing the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we laid down again, and again my boyfriend
yells (what do you want?) I told him what are you talking about&#8230;.then my
boyfriend tells me to place my head on his pillow and listen.. As I laid my
head on his pillow you could hear someone talking in a static type voice,
trying to say something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We both got
scared and my boyfriend grabbed his pillow and threw it across the room and
that night neither one of use slept with a pillow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We started to pray and held each other until
the morning and decided not to ever visit a grave yard we are not familiar with
ever again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Even now we know we bought something or someone home with
use that day. In 2000, my boyfriend would tell me that his brother and sister
when they are by themselves that lights turn on when no one is home and they
hear the faucets running and no water and that his younger brother stayed home
one night and swears that<span style="">&nbsp; </span>while he was
watching t.v. in his parents room that he heard his mom and dad come home and
open the front door and they were talking in the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When his younger brother got up to talk to
his parents, no one was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His younger
brother ran across the street to stay with some neighbors until his parents got
home. We know whatever it was is still at their house and has made it there
home.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My big old house is situated just east of town about 4
miles, and was built around 1860 or before.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We moved in when my boys were small.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The youngest one was about 15 before he shared with any of us what he
saw in the doorway of his room every night - a woman in a white dress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also saw a man in a brown suit bent over
his brother's bed with hands raised and shaped like claws, reaching toward the
sleeping brother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Guests also awoke one
night and saw that man bent over the crib of their small child.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My mother also watched a woman holding a child follow my
brother into the living room one day.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">For the most part, I don't seem to be sensitive to their
presence, just a tingling skin once-in-a-while.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But I was a little shook one evening, while home alone, when a book flew
off the shelf...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I mustered up
enough courage to walk over and pick it up, I noticed that the cover showed a
woman in a long white wedding dress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Let me begin by saying BRAVO for this addictive web
page.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's not only interesting, but
therapeutic to read experiences had by other everyday, rational people, I
think.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Especially when it's easy and
convenient to write off odd happenings in one's own mind in order to maintain a
sense of safety or sanctity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
confirmation of others' similar experiences is a great thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I think everyone has seen things out of the corner of their
eyes, only to focus on it and see nothing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I, myself, tend to blow lightbulbs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At least 3 a week, usually more.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They flare up into a purplish blue flamelike burst and make a loud
popping sound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The unusual thing about
this, is that I am either tense or stressed, or I am entering an all-dark room,
and get an odd feeling right before I switch the lamp on (it's always
lamps).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the odd experience I'd like
to recount for you is concerning my 2 &amp; 1/2 year old daughter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was born "en caul", or with the
caul (water sac) intact around her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, she came out in a sort of water bubble.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have read that supposedly this condition
denotes a child who will have "second sight", or some type of
clairvoyance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then my Dr mentioned this
folklore to me, and told me to keep him informed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My daughter is a fiery, red-headed
child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She is a wonderful child, just
extremely willful and spirited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the
qualities that drive a parent crazy (but will hopefully make a good
adult).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, my daughter usually ends
up sleeping in my bed, between her Dad and I, and refuses to go to bed unless I
join her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, early one morning we were
climbing into bed, I with my back to a window, facing inward towards her and
her Daddy (who was pretty much passed out).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She sat up suddenly and pointed at the window behind me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"That's a guy, Momma" she
says.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sleepily ask her what.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then she says "That's a guy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ouchie head guy".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I froze, immediately awake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"What did you just say?" I ask,
trying not to let alarm creep into my voice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I nudged my husband awake and said "Tell Daddy what you
said".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She says "Look Daddy,
that's an ouchie head guy."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then
she laid down to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just sat
there, eyes locked with my husband's, unable to turn around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't feel particularly cold, or the
feeling of being watched.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew by the
look on my husband's face that there wasn't anything behind me but the thickly
curtained window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, around 3 days
later, while we were in the living room, she pointed into the corner behind the
front door (which was closed) and said "Ouchie head guy" again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course there wasn't anything there (or was
there?), but the suddenness of this was startling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One minute she was sitting on the floor
playing, and then she turned and pointed (almost behind her) and said
this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This happened around 6 months
ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My daughter just turned 3 years old
in August, and my grandmother died nearly a week later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My daughter had only seen her like twice,
both times in a nursing home for brief visits, other than times when she was a
small baby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She didn't know her, and
only recognized her as "Grandma" because that's what I call her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, one day, within the week after my
Grandma passed away, I was doing laundry with my daughter playing next to me on
the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a nickname, I sometimes
call her "Mama's Baby Girl" or "Baby Girl".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was chatting to me and I asked her if she
was Mama's Baby Girl.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She usually
replies "I'm Mama's Baby Girl".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But this time she replies "I'm Grandma's Baby Girl", with a
big smile on her face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was completely
astonished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had never brought my
Grandma up, or referred to her, especially without me talking about her
first.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I know that these, and my numerous other teeny experiences
(the kind I usually write off as coincidence or ignore altogether) are
incredibly common.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I am curious to
see where my daughter's gift goes, especially when she develops the vocabulary
to express the things she sees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just
hope diligently that she doesn't outgrow her gift, and discount her senses or
second-guess her experiences as we all do.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When we question and doubt the credibility of our senses, we rob
ourselves of the experiences we are all anxious to have.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Don't we all want to see...something?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We know it's there, but it's fear of the
unknown which protects our minds from it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It's hard to wrap your head around things that have always been just
stories or make-believe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Children have
no preconceived notions, and just see what they see.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I feel like I want to see, but am scared, and
this definitely holds me back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ignorance
is bliss, right?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>;-)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Experience</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: swaney05@cox.net</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i used to live in a house from the age of 5-17 that was very</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">evil (thats the best way i can describe it). there was a
evil</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">feeling. especially in my mother's room and her attached</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">closet and attic. i believe there at some point in the
history of that house, occult practices in that area of the house and the evil
spirits resided in that area. some times i felt the evil</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">in other areas of the house but never to the intensity as
the attic area. i have always wanted to know what happened there and what was i
picking up on. the house burned to the ground about 4-5 years ago and so it is
no longer there and i am thankful for that as no one else will experience the
evil in that home. one night i spent the night in that room with my mother. i
had "a dream"-seemed like reality - of demons crawling /swarming in
and out of the window in my mothers room that was over by the closet and attic.
they were small,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">about 12-18 inches and chunky and ugly and evil. i wonder if
my mom experienced any of the evil in that room. why could i feel it and no one
else in the house every seemed to be aware of it?. i guess i will never have
these answers until i pass on. i also felt the evil in my room at times (my
room was close to my mothers) it was at night and so i often slept with the
lights on. i hated my dolls as i felt them watching me at times and felt that
if i caught them i could get a glimpse of their heads turning or them talking
to me or moving. i have never experienced anything like this any other time of
my life and so i cant accredit it to bipolar or schizophrenia. there were times
at night that i would feel the presence and i would say something like" i
rebuke you in the name of Jesus. you must flee in the name of Jesus"</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">my mother has since passed on after much physical illness</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">(something i feel is related to the evil) and my brother has
since passed on (after commiting suicide). again i feel its is</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">related to the evil in that house. When him and i still
leaved at home there he told me "i wont live past 33". he shot himself
at 33. thank you for listening and if you could give me any insight at all<span style="">&nbsp; </span>pleas email me at swaney05@cox.net</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I am writing to you because I stumbled across your website
and found some stories on hauntings at <st1:place><st1:placename>Norwich</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My brother and I attend <st1:city><st1:place>Norwich</st1:place></st1:city>
and I can tell you without a doubt that there are ghost at <st1:place><st1:placename>Norwich</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Norwich</st1:place></st1:city>
is a <st1:place><st1:placename>Military</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and most of the stories regarding the ghost stem around the envieonment only
found in a military environment.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Alumni Hall is one of the dormitories on the <st1:city><st1:place>Norwich</st1:place></st1:city>
campus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the oldest Dorm located on
the upper parade ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THe bottom
floor of Alumni hall used to be a stable area during the time when munted calvary
was still in the military.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stable
areas used to be a popular place for hazing at the university and it believed
that the hauntings may be related to a hazing event in which a student died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THere is also a room that is bricked off in
Alumni hall, some believe that this room was bricked off after students in
consective years hung themselves in that room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have researched for articles relating to suicides at the university
and have come up empty handed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I lived
on the bottom floor of Alumni Hall my senior year, for unexplainable reasons
books would fall off the shelves, dooe knobs would rattle and doors would slam
shut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never saw a spirit but
constantly had the feeling of someone in my room univited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My roommate and I both felt this feeling, on or
own and also while we were in the room together.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Chaplain Hall is reported to have a ghost as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Norwich</st1:place></st1:city>
like other universities used to have tunnells between buildings to allow
students to travelback and forth without being exposed to the harsh winter
weather.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chaplin Hall is the last
building with evidence of these tunnells, there is a bricked up entrance to the
tunnels in the dark room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THe popular
beliefe is that a student by the name of Lawerence Stillman was killed in the
tunnels during an initiation into a secret organization called the Skull and
Swords.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sightings of spirits and
strrange happenings have dwindled since Chaplin Hall was revamped in the mid
1990s.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Students have also reported hearing horses at night on the
upper parade ground.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I hope this helps, I would love to know if any further
research has been done on <st1:city><st1:place>Norwich</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">clarification of ghost sightings Aberystwyth promenade</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: philbishop@ukonline.co.uk</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This may sound strange but here goes.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have fond memories of a holiday I once spent in the
picturesque town of Aberystwyth West coast Wales, staying at the Clarendon
Hotel on the promenade (1971 July 23). I do not know if the hotel still exists,
perhaps you could advise me on this.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Maybe it's just the fact that Halloween is looming upon us,
but my mind goes back to an event which has stayed with me and my wife all of
our lives and I would like to share it with you, perhaps to see if anyone can
enlighten us, or have had similar experiences.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I will continue in my wife&#8217;s own words : Apparently not
being able to sleep and looking out from our hotel window over the promenade
she saw a young girl leaning on the railings and looking out to sea, at first,
all appearing normal, she thought nothing of it. Then she saw a young male
running up the promenade, at this point she realised that these people were not
as they seemed, they were floating silently above the pavement level by about
1' or so, to this she awoke me frantically and I rushed to the window to see.
To my amazement I instantly saw that their feet were not in contact with the
ground, I could hardly believe what my eyes were seeing. The young male
continued to run towards the girl who turned towards him as if to greet him,
they both seemed very happy to see each other as the male embraced her
enthusiastically, but all of this seemed to happen in slow motion and not in
contact with the floor. I realised what I was seeing was unnatural and tried to
shout to them to catch their attention but was unable to utter a sound. I can
still see their attire. After a short time they ran up the promenade, hand in
hand, towards the beach access at the end of the promenade. I was still trying
to get their attention but only a whisper would come out. Then they disappeared
down the steps to the beach, into the sea at high tide, to our disbelief. We
waited to see if they returned for some time, to no avail. Disbelieving what we
had both seen we discussed this through a sleepless night. The next morning as
we were leaving the hotel we mentioned this to the hotel proprietor, who
dumbfounded and in amazement, disclosed that a young couple in the sixties some
time ago had got trapped by the incoming tide on the beach ,the other side of
the rock at the end of the promenade of which I do not know the name. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I am posting this account in the hope that someone may have
similar experiences or could shed some light on the events which transpired
that night. Please feel free to contact me philbishop@ukonline.co.uk if you
have any information either factual or rumoured</p>

in <st1:place><st1:city>Springfield</st1:city>, <st1:state>Massachusetts</st1:state></st1:place>.
I live in Windham Hall room number 133. When I picked this room I had no idea
that it was haunted. A few of the kids saw your website and reported it to me.
I thought nothing of this because words are just words. On <st1:date year="2005" day="25" month="10">October 25th, 2005</st1:date>, my roommate and a couple of
friends watched a movie. When it was over, we turned the channel to 6 and
watched the 11th inning of the World Series game. I passed out around <st1:time minute="30" hour="0">12:30am</st1:time>. I woke up at <st1:time minute="0" hour="3">3am</st1:time> on <st1:date year="2005" day="26" month="10">October
 26th, 2005</st1:date>, to the television on, but just a snowy/ fuzzy picture.
The sound was on and I think that&#8217;s what woke me up. Right when I looked up and
found out what time it was, (<st1:time minute="0" hour="3">3am</st1:time>), the
TV shut off. I looked at my roommate below me and he was sound asleep. The
television remote was no where close to either of us. It looked like someone
was sleeping on top of him and I thought nothing of it because he has girls
over sometimes. I ended up go<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ing right
back to sleep and not thinking too much about the situation. When I woke up
that same morning, I told my roommate and a few friends what had happened. My
roommate said that he had no one sleep over last night. He was sleeping on his
side and there was no way he could have had his knees in an upright position.
We turned on the TV and it was still fuzzy and it read channel 78. When I
pressed channel up or down, I noticed that channel 78 was not even a programmed
channel! When you go through the channels, it goes from 71-98 and visa versa.
When I would pe in 78 on the remote control, the same fuzzy screen would come
up. What was even scarier was that my friend Bernie said that <st1:time minute="0" hour="3">3am</st1:time> was the devils hour. I had done some
research and found out that <st1:time minute="0" hour="3">3am</st1:time> was
the inverse of <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3pm</st1:time>, which was the
miracle hour (the time when Jesus was crucified). I felt like it was a
combination of The Ring and the Exorcism of Emily Rose. (Two movies that my
friends had said stuff like that hap<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>pened in). I guess The Ring has the fuzzy TV and the little girl was
lying on top of someone to try and take them away. In The Exorcism of Emily
Rose, everything demonic happens at <st1:time minute="0" hour="3">3am</st1:time>.
I now believe that my room is haunted and I will update you on any more
occurrences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&gt;From &#8211; Mike Beck,
Roommate Justin Gorski and the rest of Windham One East (WOE) </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We had purchased this almost run down house from an old lady
Back in 2000. Ever since we moved in and had done so much work to the house and
yard...We may have disturbed something or some spirit with in the house. Many
nights I would wake up and at the end of the foot of my bed, I would see an old
lady about 80-ish wearing a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>White Victorian
style dress with a bun in her hair. She would just stand there and stare at me.
With in a blink of an eye, she would disolve in the <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> air. I could not really think of what was
happening. Was she checking us out? This is a 2 story house. Sometimes when my
husbad would walk down stairs, he could feel coldness, and shadows, and
whisperings. In the main living room, while watching tv, I had my hair pulled.
My husband swore that he did not do it. Sometimes the lights would come on in
the garage, It was always cold....Even when it was 90 degrees outside.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I had fell down the stairs twice...As if someone had pushed
me. .We had asked if anyone had died in our house, no one came tell us
anything. Just that the man who used to live there died, but he did not die
there. The yard is almost an acre. When you stand outside at night, you can
feel a thick energy around you. Sometimes you feel as if something is telling
you to go indoors. My house is now being rented....</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">From: Anonymous</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I just send you a little more info on the ghost at Brittany
Hall in NYC, which is a dorm at NYU.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
fianc&eacute;e and I lived in a <st1:place>Hollywood</st1:place> studio apartment at <st1:street><st1:address>1001
  Gardner St.</st1:address></st1:street> just prior to us being married. At the
time, I worked for a telephone company and left the house at around <st1:time minute="30" hour="4">4:30am</st1:time> everyday to get to work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, the story is told by her, but my own
personal accounts also reflect a eerie vibe I got from not only my studio
apartment but the building itself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Truthfully, I always got shivers and an uneasy feeling coming from the
bathroom in my apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Actually, I'm
getting goosebumps now thinking about the place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had already left the apartment one morning,
when my fiancee, was woken up by something coming out from the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this thing passed her on the futon/bed the
entity was crumpling paper and moved thru the studio apartment and around the
corner in to the kitchen.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My wife didnt actually see a ghost due to the fact that she
was just waking up when she felt something's presence move past her, but she
knew that she wasnt alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So she
decided to stay awake and keep the television on just to feel safe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We moved shortly after that.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Apparently, the apartment manager, who was an elderly lady
died in her bedroom years before I had arrived.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My neighbor just below my apartment liked to stay up until the early
mornings reading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The guy who lived next
to him was completely insane and would get into very heated discussions with no
one else.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this nut would rant loud
enough for his next door neighbor to hear him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One story is where the insane tenant actually admitted, I guess to
himself, to having entered the manager's apartment late at night and put a
pillow over the elderly lady's face and killed her by suffocation.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I cannot imagine a time when this guy wasnt nuts, but maybe
he was a murderer and was feeling shame or guilty that was really driving him
insane.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now, my story of this apartment was that I dreamt one night
where I was being flown thru the apartment building into the various tenants
apartment by someone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Someone dead but
still living in the building, we were getting into the apartment thru
electrical outlets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were traveling at
tremendous speeds when we arrived at my apartment we flew right into a smoke
detector which prompted the detector to sound itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now the instant I dreamt "we"</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">had arrived at the smoke detector and it started going off,
I woke up to the smoke detector going off by itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no fire, no smoke, nothing to give
it any reason for it to be going off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
started to punch the devise to turn it off, understand I just woke up and I was
completely freaked out about the dream.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The dector was knocked out of its wall base and the battery had fallen
out, and for a good two more seconds the thing kept on sounding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then it stopped and I was terrified standing
on my bed/futon fists clenched with my heart beating so hard and fast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I just remembered the room was
completely silent or empty, like something had left the room.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Im not sure what to think of this whole situation, but the
house that I lived in for 3 yrs and the house my good friend still lives in, I
believe has some sort of &#8220;activity&#8221; in the house. It is only in the hallway of
the house and in the spare room which used to be my 3 yr old god-daughter&#8217;s
room. I have been in the hallway bathroom in front of the sink and have seen a
man walk behind me, I may have been seeing things im not sure, but have had a
pic. Taken on a camera phone but the phone broke after that. I have also woke
up in the middle of the night and my god-daughter has been standing in the
living room screaming while our german shepard was on her bed and refused to
move, if I walked into the room to get her off the bed she would growl, she
knows not to do that and always listens to us. I have also seen black figures
out of the corner of my eye, not only at home but in public. I have had lights
turn on only when I talk about it at the house. I don&#8217;t really get freaked out
about it, its kinda like yeah ok something might be in here whatever but
sometimes when I walk in the hallway it gives me chills. I do not know who this
man is or if it even is a man or if my mind is playing tricks on me. I wish I
could find out why I can hear our front door open and shut when im home alone
and the dead bolt still be locked. I know im not crazy my friends have seen the
pic before the phone broke and half of them are too freaked out to come over to
stay the night. I hope you have some explanation b/c I don&#8217;t.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have been a fan of your website for years. I love to read
the new and upcoming stories that have been published on the page, as well as
the old ones. I used to not really believe in ghosts, like many, until I began
encountering them myself. My first experience was when I was right out of high
school and I was working at a Bed and Breakfast. I sent in that story when it
happened. :) I have since graduated from college and am now teaching in a quant
town called Woolmarket in <st1:state><st1:place>Mississippi</st1:place></st1:state>.
The school has been registered as being the oldest in MS, as well as one of the
oldest in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
In the 1800's the community was the center of the wool trade - hence the name
"Woolmarket". Eventually a school was built in 1910 by the people of
the community to help educate their children. It still stands and currently has
about 300 students post-Hurricane Katrina. Well 300 students we can actually
see. We are not sure how many attend after hours;the faculty and staff just
know it is more than one. This is my second year teaching and I absolutely love
it. The faculty are close, and some of us even stay after school on Wednesdays
to do lesson plans together. I was told upon being hired that it isn't the
safest place to be after hours, but I didn't realize what they really meant
until I started staying late to do lessons. The teacher I work with started
telling me stories of when she used to have a classroom in hte main building.
She said she used to come real early in the morning to get things set up in her
room before the children came and she would hear children lauging and giggling
in the hallway, but she was the only one at school. She said the intercom would
come on in her class and she would hear little children whispering through the
system, but when she walked up to the office it was locked. When I was hired on
the lead teacher told me she never sits at the school alone for the same
reasons. Well, doing the lessons at school was just a lot easier for me than
dragging all the books home and doing them, so my teacher friend and I began
doing them together to make the time go quicker. Usually when everyone had left
for the day and we had been settled in our seats for a good while is when we
began hearing strange noises. The door to the main building would open and shut
by itself and we knew no one was there. We would hear little children giggling
and running down hte hall. The intercom would come on in different classrooms
down the hall and we could hear a voice that was not familiar. We began hearing
what sounded like adult voices telling students to be quiet in hte hallway.
Last, but not least, desks would be heard moving and being rearranged in
different rooms. Including hte one I taught in. I would walk in and my desks
would be rearranged from the day before. When we would leave the school at
night, sometimes after dark, we would see lights flicker on and off in the main
building. Soon things began missing - my lesson plans that I would have placed
on my desk to be turned in hte following morning would show up in a strange
place I know I did not put them or never be found. Then when I began taking my
printed copy home, my lessons on hte computer screen would go in a sort of
"landscape" mode if you will, and would print out where the words
would go off the page. There was no way to unlandscape the screen for them to
print out correctly. My principal thought it was a joke and told me to fix it,
but when I showed her that it wasn't a setting on hte computer that was causing
it, she realized I wasn't kidding. When I started talking to the
"students" and telling them how much we enjoyed them being there, my
computer screen formatted my lessons back to it's original setting and I never
had that problem again. But, as for the giggling, desk moving, and door slamming~~it
continues. In fact, while I was teaching last week, I think one of the students
from the past wanted to sit in on my lesson. The door was shut and it just
opened completely by itself and shut by itself and a piece of paper flew out of
an empty desk up front. The students seemed to feel a chill in hte air and then
it was gone. The door opened again, by itself, and closed by itself. My first
graders call him <st1:city><st1:place>Casper</st1:place></st1:city> and don't
really mind if he pays another visit.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My principal says she has encountered similar occurances in
the school, she too refuses to stay at the school alone. She claims the police
officer at night refuses to go by the North Wing of the school where my
classroom, and several others, are located because he "sees strange
things". Many teachers feel they are the students who died while they were
attending Woolmarket. Their pictures still hang in hte office. OThers feel they
are students who attended the school when it was an agricultural school in the
1800's. Whomever they are they make themselves known to many who attend the
school now. We are not afraid of them, but the thought that they exist is kind
of creepy.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">After renting a house in <st1:place><st1:city>Longview</st1:city>,
 <st1:state>WA</st1:state></st1:place>, my grandmother informed me that their
very close friends owned the house before I was born and that they went there
quite often. On occasion, while watching television in the living room, I would
see a man in a brown suit walking down the hallway out of the corner of my eye.
When I looked directly that way, he would disappear. On my thirtieth birthday,
my sister-in-law had gotten me a black balloon with a tombstone on the front of
it with the saying, "R.I.P. Youth". About a week later, I had just
finished bar-B-cuing some steaks and was sitting down to watch the Seahawks
play a Monday Night Football game. With no wind to propel it, this balloon came
around the corner from the kitchen into the living room. It stopped halfway
into the living room and went back into the hallway towards the bedroom that
the man in brown seemed to be heading to. Halfway down the hall, it stopped,
reversed direction and came back into the living room where I attacked it with
a steak knife. After draining all the helium from it, I threw it away. Our
daughter would not sleep in the bedroom that the man appeared to be heading to,
saying she felt his presence and was frightened. We changed bedrooms with her,
but I had no feeling of his presence there myself. I saw this apparition on
numerous occasions, but never felt any dread associated with it. When I
described the estimated height and attire of this apparition to my grandmother,
she said it sounded like their friend, George. I never saw his wife, and
according to my grandmother, they were childless.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When I was about 13 or 14 years old, I witnessed something
that I will never forget to this day. Every night before I went to bed, my dad
always left the bathroom light on so that we wouldn't trip or stumble on
anything trying to get to the bathroom in the middle of the night. I knew that
the bathroom light was on before I closed my eyes. Usually if my dad forgot to
turn it on, I would do it myself. The light from the bathroom always shined
directly into my room and I would have my door cracked opened so that the light
would not be directly in my face. I am not sure what time it was when I woke up
but all I know is that every light in the house was off, including the
bathroom, and my door was open all the way. I was laying on my side looking
towards the door and I saw a black figure standing in the door frame. It looked
like it was leaning on the side of the door frame just looking at me. I could
not see the face or what kind of clothes it had on, it was tall and slender. It
did look like it was wearing a hat as well. It did not move one inch. The house
was dark but this figure was even darker than the room. I could see the shape
of the shoulders and the neck and i knew it was tall because the top of the
head was close to the top of the doorway. I was scared and at first I wanted to
get up and turn the light on but the light switch was next to the figure
standing in the doorway. So I thought I see if maybe it was my dad or brother
playing a joke on me and call out there name, but there was no answer. I knew
that it could not have been them because my dad and brother are not into
walking around the house in the dark. They are pretty jumpy when it comes to
haunted houses and going into dark rooms. Instantly, I had this uncomfortable
and frightened feeling inside me and I layed down in my bed then threw the
covers over my head. I began to pray to myself like my mom had taught me. I
waited about 10 seconds and then took the blankets off my head. It was gone. I
jumped up out of the bed and ran to turn the light on. Then I looked down the
hallway and in the bathroom. I turned on the bathroom light before I went back
to my bedroom. The next morning, I asked my dad if he was standing in my
doorway last night and he said no, I also asked my brother if he was there and
he said no. I am not sure what it was or what it wanted that night but to this
day, I have problems sleeping with all lights off or going into a dark room to
turn on a light.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It was about 2 years ago when I had a sleep over at one of
my freinds, who was recently has lost her cousin who was very close to her and
her familly though cancer. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We had been talking girl talk for the best part of 3 hours
and eating sweets that were in a normal 'sainsburys' plastic bag. Sitting on
the top of the double bed by the pillows we finished all the sweets before we
got onto the subject of her cousin and left the bag down at the other end of
the bed. My freind had been telling me about strange experiences that her
familly had been getting then to see and hear the plastic bag rise a couple of
centimeters about the bed cloves and rustle then to drop back down. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We were shocked and ran down stairs to my freinds parents.
After telling them what had happend we nervously went back upstairs and sat on
the bed in near enough the same positions. Then the tv started to make funny
clicking noises as if it had been switched on for a long period of time and had
just been switched off, but infact the tv hadnt been used for over 2 days.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I think that she was trying to tell us that she was here
with her familly and that she was ok.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When the D.P.T. of corrections took over the building, and
was in the process of turning it into offices for the prison. My husband had
the night shift. His job was to make sure the building was secure after the
contractors had finished for the day.This consisted of cheaking the doors &amp;
windows of the building on eack floor. Many times while on his rounds he would
feel ( walk through ) extremely COLD spots.Not being much of a beliver he
contributed it to the old building. But when he was sitting at his desk and he
could feel it roll over him completly &amp; feel the hair raise on the back of
his neck and arms it would begin to freek him out. He could smell tobacco smoke
now &amp; then, and would have to go and investagate; Nothing would be found
burning anywhere. The time he had to go in the kitchen on rounds, he heard keys
jingling; Knowing he was the only person in that building at that time,
needless to say he didnt doddle in there. There were whifs of perfume he would
detect ( and my husband is a smoker- so you know it had to be somewhat strong )
while at his desk doing paper work. He endured till it was completed; Then he
bid out of that job &amp; away from that building. But now he tends to belive
me when I tell him of the things I have seen &amp; heard, And I belive him too.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thank you for your time.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I have many stories from my childhood encounters with the
supernatural which I might share at a later date, but for now I would like to
tell you of my current home and the spirit which resides in it. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The home use to belong to an older couple, who as I have
been told by neighbors, were pretty much forgotten about by there own grown up
children. They had both passed away of old age and of course the house and
almost all of there belongings went up for sale. My Husband purchased the house
and we moved in. Since the birth of our children, (now six and four) the kids
and I have come to find that there is another &#8220;person&#8221; living in the house as
well. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It started when I was pregnant with my son&#8230; I would awake at
night to find my daughter sitting up in bed playing with a toy that I knew she
didn&#8217;t have in her crib when I laid her down for the night. I assumed my
Husband was giving her these toys off the floor when he would get home from
working 2nd shift. I asked him about it, and he assured me he was not even
walking into her room, let alone giving her toys in the middle of the night. I
started to watch her during her naps&#8230;just to see if she had found a way to
climb out of her crib and back in again. I never once saw her climb out&#8230;or into
it for that matter. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When my son was born, we moved him into the room with our
daughter (it&#8217;s only a 2 bedroom house). As my son grew older, we heard very
little from our resident spook. One night I had just gone to bed and was just
about to drift off when I saw &#8220;someone&#8221; dart down the hall to my children&#8217;s
room. I got up and peeked in, but no one was there and all was quiet so I went
back to bed. I laid back down under the covers and closed my eyes, and right next
to my ear I hear a older woman&#8217;s voice (rather loudly) say, &#8220;Check the boy
dear, he can&#8217;t breath!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, I jumped
to my feet and ran to the Kids room. My son was breathing, but it was very
struggled. I called my neighbor to come sit with my daughter and called my
husband at work while in route to the emergency room. It turned out that my son
had allergies to eggs which I had never realized and I had made omlettes that
evening for dinner. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Since then the visits to my kids are almost nightly.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We moved an old rocking chair into the kid&#8217;s room and when
the house is quiet at night you can hear it rocking ever so slightly. My
children have yet to ever awake from a bad dream in our home, and they both can
tell you exactly what the old woman looks like and the things they talk about
with her when they can&#8217;t sleep. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">They love to hear me tell stories about the spook we have
come to call &#8220;Granny Ghost&#8221;. When they go to bed at night they say there
prayers. In thoughs prayers they ask for Granny Ghost to watch over them and
keep them safe always. I must admit, I hope she stays around too&#8230;my son might
not be here today if it wasn&#8217;t for her. She is welcome to stay with us as long
as she likes. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">That is my story&#8230; Thank you for taking the time to read it!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Thanks so much for including our story of our favorite place
"The Hidden Cemetery" in Palmer, <st1:state><st1:place>Mass.</st1:place></st1:state>
(fondly named by us, since it is indeed hidden from main roads).</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">All that said, I would like to submit the following, based
on personal experience, since we (Or myself) have lived in these homes:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Palmer, MA: This home was owned by my husband since its
construction in 1927. Deceased family members often made their presence known
by pushing us, whispering, talking out loud, showing themselves in partial
form. Bagpipe music was heard in the basement of the home (my husband's
deceased grandfather), tiny shadows dancing on a bedroom ceiling were
witnessed, a dark shape flying through the basement on one occasion was seen by
my husband. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><st1:place><st1:city>Oxford</st1:city>, <st1:state>MA</st1:state></st1:place>:
I owned this home with my late ex-husband. He loved the house so much that he
swore he would never sell it during his lifetime. Soon after his death in 2001,
his voice had been heard by a neighbor, calling out to her in a happy greeting.
A fleeting glimpse of him had been seen through kitchen and livingroom windows.
The house was sold at auction in 2002, no word on whether or not his spirit has
been seen since.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><st1:place><st1:city>Dudley</st1:city>, <st1:state>MA</st1:state></st1:place>:
Built in 1839, this home has been the scene of many hauntings, witnessed by
both a former owner of the home and myself, as I had rented that house in 1983,
for six months. A baby who had died in an unused upstairs bedroom could often
be heard crying. The baby would pull blankets off of a bed in another upstairs
room. The creaking sounds of a rocking chair could be heard from the dead
baby's bedroom. The images of four men could be seen in the basement. Voices
were often heard from the basement. A white image was once seen, streaking from
the kitchen into the bathroom wall, which was formerly a pantry. Many cold
spots were felt even in hottest summer months. Some people who entered the home
usually felt an feeling of uneasiness, like they shouldn't be there. Footsteps
were often heard, the sound of a dragging foot. I later learned this was the
ghost of a former owner who had suffered a leg injury during the civil war. The
home was sold in the summer of 1983 to owners who claimed they never
experienced hauntings, but the house mysteriously went up for sale several months
after they had purchased it. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><st1:place><st1:city>Springfield</st1:city>, <st1:state>MA</st1:state></st1:place>,
my husband lived in this opulent home as a child in the 1960s. His entire
family witnessed spirits of a WW2 soldier (who had lived in the home before
dying during the war). Fatal wounds could be seen on his body when he thought
nobody was looking at him, but if someone caught sight of him and gave him
their attention, the bloody wounds would disappear. Other sightings included a
former groundskeeper, a small bright dancing light that may have been the spirit
of a dead infant, and the ominous form of an elderly woman who would glare at
living family members. A room on the unused third floor of the home held the
remains of a wooden bed, and iron<span style="">&nbsp; </span>rings
set into the posts of the bed, possibly to keep hidden a family member who had
been insane or mentally disturbed. My husband's family members described
disturbing feelings if they entered this room, as if a satanic spirit dwelled
there. After my husband's family moved from the home, the house burned to the
ground. A chain link fence was constructed around the vacant house lot, and
nothing was rebuilt in its place, as of 2002.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Scary<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Legends</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: RyanOnly92155@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I actually just remembered a story, I guess I blocked it out
because it scared me and it was so long ago, and I've added a couple of legends
from around here........when I was in middle school, I would stay with my
friend a lot, she was all into ghosts, witch craft, and all that. She lived in
the country, way way out. One night she told me a story about an old house up
the mountain. That a family used to live there, and one day their children (boy
and girl) were left unattended. The girl had an apple and a sharp knife so she
could cut it. They began running around and the little girl flipped over the
couch and well you can come the conclusion it wasn't good. She fell on the
knife and bled to death on the couch. My friend told me the couch was up there
still, and what she had experienced on trips up there. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Well being that it was so late there was no way I was
walking up a dirt road on a mountain up to a haunted house. So the next day we
started walking up there, we passed an old barn that was just spooky (you know
how you can just look at a house or structure and get a bad feeling from it).
So we continued up to the house, but we never made it in, as soon as the house
came into view I saw something in the upstairs window, I just brushed it off
though because I never experienced anything. We got up to the porch and could
hear children laughing, as soon as we got to the door the laughter stopped and
a little girls voice said "mommy?". After that I took the hint and
took off running leaving my friend behind, well it had also been raining
earlier that day. So needless to say the road was muddy, but you can bet I was
running so fast that I slid on my side most of the way back down the road. So
even though I am interested in hauntings and historical sites, I will never go
again unless I am with a group. Out of that experience all I got was a muddy
side and sore leg, and scared half to death. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I guess the little girl was wondering if it was her mother
returning home, since she never saw her mother again after the accident. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Another time I was at my cousins sleep-over birthday party.
Which she had in their basement apartment, so being like she is, she had a
ouija board. I know that ouija boards are really only games but this is what
happened. I wouldn't play with it, haha surprised? I was sitting on the couch
watching a few others play with it. There was a remote on the counter on the
other side of the room, all of a sudden it was like someone just pushed it off
the counter in a rage because it went flying all the way across the room. No
one was near it at all. So later when we were all trying to get to sleep, we had
about 3 portable heaters, because we were in the basement. Even with the
heaters on full blast, and all of us girls in the room(the more people, more
body heat, warmer room), the room was as cold as ice. So needless to say I
didn't get any sleep because it was too cold for comfort. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There are only a couple of haunted places around here, there
is the tunnel to nowhere, when the construction workers were working on it, it
collapsed and killed many. If you go at night, and you have the nerve to go
into the tunnel (pitch black cant even see your hand infront of you). As you go
deeper into the tunnel if you have a flash light count on it going out....and
count on breathing getting harder too do as you go further.(sure there are
explanations, but it's the story behind it that makes you want to believe it's
something else)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then there is Helens bridge, I'm not sure of the true story
behind Helen, but all the ones that I've heard can be summed up like this.
Something happened to Helens baby, she jumped off of the unfinished bridge to
kill herself. If you venture onto the bridge (which is closed to public now,
you have to walk quite a way).....if you walk towards the edge of the bridge
and say "Helen I got your baby" she appears and tries to harm you if
you're dumb enough to stick around.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Another thing I experienced really did give me the creeps.
Me and a bunch of friends were just out for a ride, they told me about a
cemetary that is "haunted", if you go through it at night, your car
supposedly turns around, and cuts off. Me being the chicken I am said
"forget that". Well they tricked me, they took me into the cemetary
another way, as soon as I realized it was the cemetary I started freaking and
put the car into reverse before I ventured further into the cemetary. Even
though I put the car in reverse, when I pushed on the gas I wouldn't move it
had been put into neutral. So I tried again, stepped on the gas went forward,
been put into drive. Well then I tried once more and it went right back into
neutral. (no one was touching the gear shift, none of them even knew how to
drive a stick), so finally and luckily because by this time I was pretty
freaked, it stayed in reverse and I went home and stayed shook up about it for
most of the night. Even though I didn't see anything, something was trying to
force me to enter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My best friend's husband committed suicide - in front of
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She has said he haunts their
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prior to that particular
residence, they lived directly across the alley in a second floor 2 bedroom
apartment.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I lived in that apartment
for 2 years.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">While there, her husband used to come and visit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would move things around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as I realized he was there, I spoke
to him and told him I wouldn't do anything to upset him, but if he ever hurt or
frightened me or anyone who was visiting me (particularly my 6 year old
grandchild who was friends with his children - and they all used to play in my
apartment), I would contact a priest and have him exorcised!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">From that time on, he would let me know he was there - at
times - by moving things around.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Especially at Christmas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
particular incident - I had a decorated Christmas tree and was sitting inside,
watching TV with all windows and doors closed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The only 1 ornament and branch started to move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as I started to talk to him,
everything stopped moving!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It was really interesting to be able to semi-speak with
someone on the other side!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I am writing in response to a crew chief that has had
ghostly experiences aboard Spook 50 the haunted KC-135 at Fairchild Air Force
Base in <st1:state><st1:place>Washington</st1:place></st1:state>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I used to be a hydraulics technician at
Fairchild from 1998-2002.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One particular
night on swing shift well after dark I happened to be on Spook 50.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a hydraulic technician, it is our
responsiblity to repair the air refueling boom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Spook 50 had been flown that day and had come down with an electrical on
the boom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The 4 of us hydraulic
technicians on shift went out their to see what was wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We put a boom tester on the end of the boom
and the check was ready to go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The 3
other techs on shift were on a maintenance stand with the tester while I was
running the test from the boom pod.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
4 of us were the only ones near the plane.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Anyways, while I was waiting for them to commence their part of the
test, I heard footsteps behind me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
seemed to come towards me until it got close to the boom pod and then alk
away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thinking nothing of it, I figured
that they needed something downstairs so I asked them what they needed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They said they had been standing on the stand
and had not moved and were ready to commence the test.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told them I thought I heard one of them
upstairs but all 3 said they hadn't moved and that it was probably my
imagination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wind was not blowing
but the fuselage floor had been sligthly bouncing as it does when someone is
walking to the back of the aircraft.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
realize now that I never heard the safety grate on the enterance come down so I
am sure that no living person was up there with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had to go back up there and finish the test
but since that day Spook 50 has always freaked me out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have heard other stories from friends but
that is my only personal experience.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I was at my friends place in <st1:place><st1:city>Pine City</st1:city>,
 <st1:state>MN</st1:state></st1:place> on several occasions and witnessed
spirits of some sort. Before they built there, a house with 3 children burned
down and it is believed that it is them. I witnessed<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a lamp that was not plugged in, go on, while
we sat at the breakfast bar, cupboards were opening and closing and our
beverages changed places right in front of our eyes. I never believed much
before that, that stuff like that happened, but there is no way it was just the
wind or someone hiding under a table!</p>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Hi, my name is Joe and this is my most recent
encounter {at least I feel it is an encounter}, I&#8217;m 33 I have a very open mind
to these such things and do try to look a both sides of the story before I go
telling my family {even though they would understand}.i also consider myself to
be on the sensitive side of &#8220;those feelings&#8217; [&#8220;being watched&#8221; &#8220;hairs standing
up&#8221; you know what I&#8217;m getting at] well here goes. It was about 2 years ago my
ex-girlfriend and I just rented a new place in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Malden</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">, Mass . Nice place not too old looking 2 floors and a
done over attic with two bedrooms up there very nicely done master bedroom
directly under one of the rooms{now that room had a storage space not finished}
it started on the night that our new furniture was delivered I was meeting the
delivery guys, I received the new goods and proceeded to start putting together
the dinning room table {I was alone that night} when suddenly and I do stress
suddenly I got that eerie feeling {and those of you who have had this happen to
you] I was being watched<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and I tell you
that was VERY unnerving, now I did have the radio on so it wasn&#8217;t dead silent
but didn&#8217;t matter I tried to you know shake it off singing having a grand ole
time telling myself &#8220;it&#8217;s just because your in a different place ,you haven&#8217;t
got comfortable in your new surroundings yet &#8221;, but It <span style="">&nbsp;</span>wasn&#8217;t working those feelings were getting
stronger, now mind you I&#8217;m putting this table together in the living room and
that feeling was coming from behind me and on the stairs like when someone sits
on the stairs and pokes their head through the dowels sort of like they&#8217;re in
jail kind of thing. Tried as I did the feeling wasn&#8217;t <span style="">&nbsp;</span>going away, so what did I do.. I got up off my
knees, looked at my watch told myself its getting late, said &#8220;that&#8217;s enough for
tonight&#8217; {trying to kid myself and left pretty quickly .now I didn&#8217;t say
anything to her about this since I just thought It was me {well I was hoping it
was just me]. so I&#8217;m a night owl, love the T.V. late, nice and quiet she&#8217;s
asleep next to me in bed its about say 1-1:30AM <span style="">&nbsp;</span>and I hear banging now not banging like
pounding banging but like general walking banging and a few thumps thrown in
coming from the daughters room above us and she was staying at the grandmothers
that night, so I mute the T.V. and cock my head to focus my hearing and it
stops I quickly dismiss it and un mute the T.V. no sooner I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>do that, there it goes again, now I&#8217;m getting
a little nervous {in the other room up there is her son and I <span style="">&nbsp;</span>know he&#8217;s not awake he&#8217;s 5 and was asleep eons
ago} so I shut the .T.V.. off <span style="">&nbsp;</span>put a
pillow over my head and go to sleep all the while wondering what the heck that
was, but it did stop and nothing else happened that night. Now mind you this is
only in a couple of days span so.. one week night [oh btw we had a mini chihuahua
}I was going in the basement to do laundry and the basement wasn&#8217;t finished but
it was still nice and had small box windows at about the outside grass
level<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and the dog was following me, at
about the time I got to the third step down I noticed he was still at the
threshold of the entrance way refusing to come down I called &#8220;c&#8217;mon its alright&#8221;
he whined and fled back up stairs so.. I started to do the laundry and it
starts again hairs on my neck stand straight up, goose bumps<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>start appearing on my arms and the feeling
of not being alone flood my body my &#8220;fight or flight&#8221; alarms are going off and
my nerves are starting to get shaky at best, and its not like I felt is was
right behind me it was more towards the other side of the room like something
was just &#8220;hanging around &#8220; &#8230;being curious, I finished putting the laundry in
the washing machine and start to go upstairs and I start getting a sense of
relief {now this could be my own mind playing tricks on me} but as I got to the
top step I felt it again but this time it was like it was watching me from the
bottom step just &#8220;looking&#8221; up at me as I left, when I got through the door I
felt fine and nothing else really happened the rest of the night. O.K. up to
now this whole experience was a little unsettling but nothing major until one
night about 2:00 or so in the morning I was playing a computer game my ex was
asleep {lol she was ALWAYS asleep when these thing happened} now the computer
room was small about 6x6sqft<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and it had
a doorway but no door the computer faces the back wall so when you sit by the
computer your<span style="">&nbsp; </span>back is to the very short
hallway and stairs so if you turn around you could see both very easily, so to
continue.. I&#8217;m playing, feeling comfortable and then the stairs creek {<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought it was just the stairs being that
they are kind of old you know &#8220;settle&#8221; a little more and dismissed it} and then
again creak now her daughter {and she was home this time} was know for trying
to sneak down stairs at night and watch T.V. and this second time I thought it
was her and turned&#8230;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and no one was there
.one creek fine &#8230; two.. and<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>nervous<span style="">&nbsp; </span>thoughts are creeping
in.. but no more creaks as I started to relax and continue to play all of a
sudden the room, even thought small, had an &#8220;open&#8221; air about it so if you sat
at the computer you could &#8220;feel&#8221; that there was no door and hence &#8220;open&#8221;, I
felt as if there was someone standing in the doorway making me feel &#8220;closed in&#8221;
just casually standing there watching me I could feel eyes upon me &#8230; I didn&#8217;t
dare turn around &#8220;just keep playing &#8220; I told myself then it happened and very ,
VERY quickly the hairs stood up again ,I started getting chills and I felt a
cold and tingling sensation and my right shoulder like a hand was being placed
on it , no pressure, just cold and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>about
as big as an adults hand and a head on my left side ,now when I say this I mean
like some one comes up to you and peers over you shoulder to try and see some
thing that&#8217;s<span style="">&nbsp; </span>right in front of you. this
freaked me out so much that shut the game down very quickly and went to bed,
like a 5 yr old whose afraid of thunderstorms .The next day I decided it was
time to say something to her and I told her and she looked at me like I had ten
heads but still had this look of belief and disbelief and asked her if she&#8217;s
EVER felt any of these feelings that I have had and her response was &#8220;no&#8221;. We
went outside to have a cigarette and the landlord Dave pulls into the driveway
we gave him a cheery &#8220;HI&#8221; and she blurts it out &#8220;Joe thinks we have ghosts&#8221; I
look at her with a look of disgust and he starts in, laughs a little, jokes
with me {he is a nice guy though} and says &#8220;so we do huh?&#8221; then I tell him
about what&#8217;s been happening to me and I ask if he&#8217;s felt anything his response
also a &#8220;no&#8221; {now this house is Dave&#8217;s first rental property and only the second
to live in here as opposed to the original owners} I asked him if he knows of
anything that has happened in this house and the age of it he said &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know&#8221; but he did say it was kind of dated {never did give me a time frame} well
to say the least I never got to find out any more about what &#8220;it&#8221; was because
we broke up and to this day I&#8217;m still convinced that &#8220;something&#8221; is in there
.Since finding your site and reading about other peoples&#8217; accounts I didn&#8217;t
feel so weird about mailing this to you<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I hope in the near future I will be able to mail you something about
this house as I&#8217;m going to the local library and do some researching .Thanks a
lot for posting this I hope it wasn&#8217;t too long and btw I haven&#8217;t<span style="">&nbsp; </span>had ANY feelings like that since. One more
thing<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;ve told this story to my fianc&eacute;
and she&#8217;s a scientist and man you talk about being skeptical {which is fine} I
also searched your Massachuettes<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>listings and I&#8217;ve been to the Danvers state hospital, not inside just on
the grounds, {about 8 yrs ago} and got those feelings of being watched there so
just to &#8220;get her in the spirit&#8221; I&#8217;m taking her and her friend up there to see
if she can get those &#8220;unnerving&#8221; feelings as well, she&#8217;s never had those
feelings before and I told her &#8220;that once you feel it you will NEVER forget
what it&#8217;s like&#8221; Thanks again for letting me share this<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and keep up the great work . <br style="">
