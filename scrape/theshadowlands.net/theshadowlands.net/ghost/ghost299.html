<p><b>The Copper Bowl Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Igotinkmom@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I live in the town of Anaconda, Montana and I used to work at the
Copper Bowl.&nbsp; We all used to joke around about "Wilbur" the previous
owner who haunted the place.&nbsp; At first it was just little things that
would happen, casino machines would all of a sudden have credits on them
when no one was there, which could be a mechanical malfunction.&nbsp; Things
would move from one place to another but nothing was as horrifying as what
happened one Saturday morning.&nbsp; It was earlier in the morning and
it was just the cook and I.&nbsp; He was telling me about the reflection
of a woman he had seen a few nights before in one of the windows but when
the spot where she was supposed to be was investigated, no one was there.&nbsp;
These kind of scarier stories where becoming more and more common place
and we knew that Wilbur wasn't alone.&nbsp; That morning we had gone over
to the bowling alley which is next door.&nbsp; It was always dark in there
until the owners came and always cold.&nbsp; In the dark you could here
someone walking across the boards which makes a very distinct sound.&nbsp;
Now what I mean by walking across the boards is that someone is walking
in the gutters or on the lanes themselves.&nbsp; You could hear the footsteps
coming towards us but there was no one there.&nbsp; You could also hear
jingling of keys.&nbsp; A little while later we were alone in the restaurant
and you could hear things next door getting louder.&nbsp; Not just footsteps
this time but other noises that we just couldn't explain.&nbsp; The cook
had to go over to the bowling alley to get ice and was gone for what seemed
like a very long time so I went over to find him.&nbsp; As I walked through
the door there was a really intense feeling, one that I've only had a few
times in my life and it was the feeling of 'get the heck out of here' but
I had to find my coworker.&nbsp; When I called his name the first time
I got no answer so I walked up toward the bar.&nbsp; As I walked up the
stairs I heard what sounded like a gurgling noise that comes from deep
in the back of the throat and I got the chills.&nbsp; I called his name
again and this time he answered me but it sounded very faint.&nbsp; I called
his name again and this time it was as loud as it should be considering
he was only 4 feet from me.&nbsp; A little while later we went over there
again to have our cigarettes and I saw a black figure at the other end
of the alley walk across, my coworker saw the panic in my face and turned
around, he then turned to me and told me we had to "get the hell out of
there."&nbsp; I found out that Wilbur had died when he had drown on a fishing
trip.&nbsp; Needless to say, I quit not long after that.</b>

<p><b>The Little Ones</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: potblackettle@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My better half and I were looking for a larger apartment to rent.&nbsp;
Because he works mornings and I work afternoons I ended up doing a lot
of our house hunting alone.&nbsp; I went to look at around 5 different
houses and apartments one day.&nbsp; They were all far to generic, little
boxes in apartment complexs, until the last one.&nbsp; This last house
was an old mill house, made into a duplex.&nbsp; It was huge, the ceilings
were 15 ft.&nbsp; the rooms were massive.&nbsp; It was a great house, about
90 years old and "oh so cool".&nbsp; My boyfriend came to look at it the
next day and also liked it, so we moved in.</b>
<br><b>It was little things at first.&nbsp; An odd pounding on the wall
that we attributed to our rambunctious neighbor.&nbsp; Cold winds that
that we thought were just the usual drafts of an old house.&nbsp; But the
cat, we couldn't explain the cat.&nbsp; Our kitty is a smart little beastie,
more so than the average feline.&nbsp; He wouldn't go upstairs without
one of us.&nbsp; If he was asleep on the bed and you left the room he would
go streaking past you down the stairs.&nbsp; He would sit and stare at
something in the corner.&nbsp; He would leap up from a nap and chase his
tail, like someone had pulled it.&nbsp; We didn't even really think about,
we figured the cat was weirded out by the move.</b>
<br><b>Then more concrete odd things began to happen.&nbsp; I would see
little figures out of the corner of my eye, quick shadows that were gone
before I could turn my head.&nbsp; Or I would hear laughter, but it would
vanish just as quickly.&nbsp; Sometimes I would hear crying as I walked
up the stairs.&nbsp; But these things were always short and soft enough
that I would think it was a trick of my mind.</b>
<br><b>My boyfriend and I were sitting watching a movie one night when
something happened that convinced me I wasn't insane or overly imaginative.&nbsp;
My boyfriend (who does not believe at all and is incredibly pragmatic)
suddenly stopped the movie.&nbsp; He asked me if I heard that.&nbsp; "What?"
I replied.&nbsp; He looked at me and said, "Children screaming."&nbsp;
I hadn't heard it, but I could see how upset he was.&nbsp; And more odd
things have happened since then.&nbsp; My boyfriend and I both love kids,
especially me, it's a running joke that I'm a baby magnet, kids love me.&nbsp;
We have several friends who bring their young children over to visit or
for me to babysit, so I have toys all over the house.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our kitchen
and living room are connected by a doorway with no door, so you can see
straight through.&nbsp; I was making a tuna fish sandwich a couple of days
ago and happened to glance into the living room.&nbsp; A small, brightly
colored ball rolled across the floor.&nbsp; At first I thought the cat
must be playing with it, and then I realized the cat was sitting next to
me, hoping to catch some floor bound tuna.&nbsp; I was the only one home.&nbsp;&nbsp;
My boyfriend swears that he saw a blond haired kid in our kitchen hiding
under the table.&nbsp; I was babysitting our friends toddler that day and
he figured it was Mikie.&nbsp; So he snuck over, planning to lift up the
tablecloth and play, "Peek a boo", but when he lifted the table cloth no
one was there.&nbsp; MIkie and I were two blocks away at the park.</b>
<br><b>I know I've gone through all this set up and nothing really freaky's
happened, so here's the clincher.&nbsp; It happened this morning, that's
why I'm writing this now.&nbsp; I woke up late, my boyfriend had gone to
work and I was planning to laze around the house and maybe do some yard
work.&nbsp; I laid down on our couch and decided to watch a movie, I apparently
dozed off.&nbsp; I woke up because someone was crawling up onto the couch.&nbsp;
Seriously.&nbsp; To anyone who has kids or spends a lot of time with them,
you know what this is like.&nbsp; You're napping and feel tiny hands on
the couch, then a little body crawls up and snuggles down next to you.&nbsp;
This has happened so many times that at first it didn't even faze me.&nbsp;
Then I realized that none of the munchkins I take care of were in the house.&nbsp;
No one was in the house.&nbsp; And when I sat up, the weight was gone and
no one was there.</b>
<br><b>None of this scares me.&nbsp; We rented the house because I told
my better half that it felt happy, like a home.&nbsp; The only thing I
can come up with is that the children of whatever mill worker lived in
this house are still around.&nbsp; And that's ok.&nbsp; I hope the like
us and our home, I'd rather have happy little ghosts than not so nice other
ones.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm so glad this site is here and I can tell someone
about these events.&nbsp; Our friends just laugh.&nbsp;&nbsp; Great work

<br><b>Suicide Bridge Project.</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Chanshaw3@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Trip. I'm a filmmaker and owner of a small independant</b>
<br><b>film company in Altadena, CA. I relocated to CA. from OH. about
a year and a</b>
<br><b>half ago to pursue writing and film making full time.</b>
<br><b>Recently, I finished a paranormal documentary film titled "Suicide
Bridge the</b>
<br><b>Documentary" set to hit the festival circuit mid/late summer.</b>
<br><b>When we started this project, I'm the first to admit that I was
sceptical of</b>
<br><b>ghosts and what the word ghost means. Now, after a year of being
envolved with</b>
<br><b>Suicide Bridge I'm the first to admit that what comes after this
"physical</b>
<br><b>life" is a passage to innumerable dimensions, and SO MUCH&nbsp;
hangs on our mental</b>
<br><b>ego in physical form.</b>
<br><b>Last March 2003 my writing partner (Misty) and I were in pre-production
on an</b>
<br><b>entirely different genre and film. One night, after working until
the wee</b>
<br><b>hours of the morning. Misty stopped to take a break. Thinking, some
fresh air and</b>
<br><b>a early morning walk would do her good she put a sweater on and
told me she</b>
<br><b>would be back in a half hour. I wasn't really worried due to Altadena
being a</b>
<br><b>very safe suburb of Pasadena.</b>
<br><b>After she had left I fell asleep in the cozy quite on the living
room couch</b>
<br><b>it was 2:35 AM. I awoke to the cordless phone ringing... ring...ring..
Glancing</b>
<br><b>at the clock the time was 3:45 AM. I called outloud to Misty as
I reached for</b>
<br><b>the phone that was laying on the living room floor. "HELLO" I said...
no</b>
<br><b>answer replied. The wrinkles on my forhead tightened. I said again
"HELLO..." This</b>
<br><b>time I heard a tiny voice on the other end it said. "Can you come
and get</b>
<br><b>me?". I said, "Misty?..."looking at the clock again "Its nearly
4:00 A.M. where</b>
<br><b>in the hell are you!?" In a distant voice and completely out of
character for</b>
<br><b>her she said. " I walked across Suicide Bridge...I think its haunted...</b>
<br><b>something or someone is trying to comunicate with me..." The words
Suicide, Bridge,</b>
<br><b>instantly hit me, I had never heard of such a bridge. I ask her
where she was</b>
<br><b>and she gave me directions on where to find her. When I picked her
up she had</b>
<br><b>lost the natural olive glow in her skin complection and she was
extremely</b>
<br><b>dispondent. Out of the ordinary things began happening immediately.
Starting with</b>
<br><b>the T.V. and other electrical appliances turning on &amp; off by
themselves.</b>
<br><b>Electrical surges that would fluxuate the lights in the house from
dim to bright.</b>
<br><b>Our cat disappeared into the air conditioning unit casing outside
on the balcony</b>
<br><b>and it would not come out. There were three seperate occasions returning
home</b>
<br><b>when a dead bolt was locked that could only be locked by someone
on the</b>
<br><b>inside and no body was there or had been there,&nbsp; I had to break
in through a</b>
<br><b>window. A couple of nights I thought awoke to a lady obseving us
asleep from the</b>
<br><b>hallway. But perhaps the most ironic paranormal evidence we gained
by this</b>
<br><b>encounter is a script we have written for a feature film. I know
what your thinking</b>
<br><b>how can a script be evidence? Let me explain... The day after Misty
paranormal</b>
<br><b>encounter I ask her to take me to this Suicide Bridge on the way
there she</b>
<br><b>explained that alot of people jump from the bridge and theres alot
of suspecious</b>
<br><b>death that surrounds the bridge as well. I thought WOW what a spooky
place</b>
<br><b>this must be... and it was, We arrived on the bridge the following
night around</b>
<br><b>12:30 AM. I don't know how to explain it really but the air was
heavy and its</b>
<br><b>almost like I could sence a presence but there was obviously no
one else</b>
<br><b>around. I walked the bridge alone that night, Misty was still shaken
from the night</b>
<br><b>before and declined to walk with me. When I return to the car I
had a</b>
<br><b>revaluation. I said "We have to make a movie about this place."
That very night we</b>
<br><b>put the other project on the back burner and began writing "Suicide
Bridge".</b>
<br><b>Strange occurences continued for the next 4 weeks as we wrote. When
we completed</b>
<br><b>the script it came to mind that there had never been a documentary
film about</b>
<br><b>this bloody bridge and making a documentary would be a great way
to introduce</b>
<br><b>the bridge and possibly find an executive producer for the feature
film. This</b>
<br><b>is where the SHOCK comes in. Starting in the archives we wanted
to know as</b>
<br><b>much as we could about the history of the bridge. We were flumixed
to find that</b>
<br><b>our script had factually dated the year the bridge was built, 1913
and a man</b>
<br><b>who had been buried alive in the bridge during its construction
and details of</b>
<br><b>the accident that we could not have known without extensive research.
I could</b>
<br><b>fill up another page if I explained all the coincidences in the
script that</b>
<br><b>took place in real life over the last century...</b>
<br><b>Things have returned to normal now, but for a while Misty and I
experienced a</b>
<br><b>true haunting with energy and thoughts revealed to us from some
other plain</b>
<br><b>of existance beyond our comprehension. The Documentary portion is
complete. The</b>
<br><b>incredible talents of&nbsp; Paranomal Pysicic Peter James shines
in this film as</b>
<br><b>he communicates and locates many spirits on the bridge not all of
them are</b>
<br><b>suicides. He confirms that Misty was haunted by a spirit named Myrtle
who threw</b>
<br><b>her child off the bridge and then jumped herself in 1937. Ironically
the baby</b>
<br><b>survived the 180 foot plunge unscaved&nbsp; she is know as the "Baby
the Angels</b>
<br><b>Saved" as there is no explaination how or why she survived the fall.
Peter said</b>
<br><b>that Myrtle somehow knew that Misty would be instumental in finding
her daughter</b>
<br><b>who is know 74 years old and bringing her back to the bridge. Misty
was</b>
<br><b>succesfull in locating the woman out of state and bringing her back
to the place</b>
<br><b>where her mom died and attempted to kill her as well. Suicide Bridge
the</b>
<br><b>Documentary captures happiness and tears and traggedy of this cursed
crossing and</b>
<br><b>brings it to life. The film will be for sale on line mid summer
also look for it</b>
<br><b>on cable T.V.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Shaking Bed</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: easilyamused611@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>this did not happen to me, but i was over at my aunt and uncles house
the weekend it happened. so it all started when my aunt and uncle were
sleeping the night that i was over and their window kept opening and closing
all by itself. my aunt thought that it was very strange considering that
there was no wind at all that night. so she got out of bed and before she
could shut the window it shut all by itself. so then she went back into
her bed thinking that it was quiet weird, but forced herself to sleep.
then about 20 minutes later my uncle wakes up to find that their bed is
shaking. not the house, but just the bed. the bed wasnt just like shaking
calmly, it was basically have a seisure. and its not like they live in
california or anything, they live in illinois and as far as i can trace
back illinois hasnt had any earthquakes. so the next morning my aunt was
putting new sheets on the bed, but before she could finish putting the
sheets on she decided to go see my uncle who went into the hospital that
day for kemo and she had took me with her. when we came back about an hour
later, she went back into her room to finish putting the sheets on, but
when she went into her room the sheets were set perfectly onto her bed
and the pillows were all put into place as well. our family thinks that
this spirit that is in their house is my aunt and uncles dead daughter
that just died about 1/2 a year ago.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Don't Wake the Dead</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dwhite143@kc.rr.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>When my mother took my brother and sisters and I to visit the cemetery
on Memorial Day is when I met him.</b>
<br><b>We were warned to behave and not to wake the dead. Our father didn’t
even go with us even though it was his own parent’s graves that we had
gone to put flowers on. Mother just said that he being “ funny” about going
to the cemetery. He acted like he would go then backed out at the last
minute, strange.</b>
<br><b>She also said that we kids made enough noise to wake the dead and
that we had better behave at the cemetery.</b>
<br><b>There was some little old lady whom we encountered at the cemetery.
She told us that we should not wake the dead, that they were in the grass
and in the trees and in the birdsong and we had better respect them. They
were her own ancestors who had come up the river from Mississippi to Missouri
in search of good farmland.</b>
<br><b>One of my sisters called her a ‘stupid old bat’ and my brother said
they were just bones and not real people anymore anyway and I declared
that if the lawnmower didn’t disturb them already there was little we kids
could do that would!</b>
<br><b>In the cemetery we children, (I think I was about 8 years old) put
dandelions and clover on graves of people we didn’t even know. We made
prayers for them. We ran around and I eventually decided to try to wake
just to test it out some to see if there was any truth to it and if it
could really be done, like the smart A I really was. I kicked a gravestone
hard enough to stub my toe. I said some insult and there was a flash of
yellow white light and suddenly there was this young man standing in our
midst.</b>
<br><b>He was wearing something like bib overalls, but they were really
just pants with suspenders and a white button up long sleeved cotton shirt,
and a straw hat with straw colored hair. He growled in a thick southern
accent “We don’t need you carpetbaggers coming around here! We don’t need
your dandelions we don’t need your clover and we don’t need your prayers!
So you had better pack it up and head on down the road!”</b>
<br><b>At the time that he appeared I felt an icy chill and it was a hair-raising
experience and we all ran back to our mother. I asked her what a carpetbagger
was and why that guy was yelling at us. She said she didn’t know.</b>
<br><b>As we drove away there was music from some car radio it was Three
Dog Nights’ Just an old-fashioned love song, blaring and no one was even
in that car to turn the radio on. Mother said that whoever owned that car
they were doing more to wake the dead than her own kids, and how dare that
lady talk to her about her kids that way! I knew though, that no one was
even in the car at the time the radio started blaring.</b>
<br><b>Mother said that she had thought we could behave but she should
have known better. We never went back there again. However I did develop
a pretend friend Steven who had drowned in the river after falling off
a boat at age 17.</b>
<br><b>When I was 17 I did not drown as he had at 17, but I had an accident
with a lawnmower and it cut part of the toe I had stubbed on the gravestone
off.&nbsp; I felt afterwards that there was some connection some otherworldly
retaliation against me for kicking a grave and waking the dead. I feel
guilty for it still even now.</b>
<br><b>We started a new family tradition of going camping&nbsp; in the
Ozarks for Memorial Day instead. We discovered an ancient Osage burial
ground and found souvenir stone tools and clay figures. I was often in
tears as we did so although I was the one who found the first arrowhead,
and in doing so, let the family know that they could be found there. I
felt cold spots, and like I was being watched the whole time we were there
picking up arrowheads axe heads spearheads and clay figures. I laughed
and cried and went through a whole spectrum of emotions and I knew of a
great many things that hadn’t happened yet. Like time was laid out before
me in such a way that I remembered both the future and the past. Even things
that happened before my own time. I kept one of the clay heads which evidently
had broken off a body we never found in my fish aquarium for some years
and I felt as though he were a friend or guardian spirit who watched over
me. I eventually gave it to my sister who lost it. The reason I know they
were Osage is because I once saw the same face from across a smoke filled
bar and so I went around and asked him what ancestry he was. The face could
not look so much the same if they were not related. He was half German
and half Osage Indian. Now there is a No Trespassing sign that says Archeological&nbsp;
Dig Site&nbsp; and some warning about a big fat fine if you go there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It really is not right to wake the dead. They won’t appreciate it. And
they really can and will retaliate. Please just don’t do it</b>

<p><b>Pilgrim Girl</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: easilyamused611@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have only had a few paranormal experiences in my life. This one
that I am going to talk about happened about 1 year ago (2003). One night
i was sleeping in my bed and the way that my bed is faced is where if I
was to open my eyes i can look directly into my bathroom. So i suddenly
woke up for no reason at all, I just did. So when i woke up it was chilled
in my bedroom and i rubbed my eyes to make sure that i was really awake
and not sleeping. when i looked over into the bathroom, i saw a little
girl that was dressed in colonial 1800 clothing. the little was semi-transparent
and had her hands reaching out towards me. the little girl started coming
towards me and i hid under my covers because i was freaking out. then a
few seconds later i took the covers off of my head and looked out to see
if the little girl was still there, but she wasnt. when i told my parents
the next morning they surprisingly believed me saying that my brother had
seen the same little girl about 2 weeks prior to me seeing it. i have never
seen the little girl again, but my brother still has occurrences with this
apparation. i guess this means that our house now has a ghost.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Haunted Hotel Room</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: mmayer71@rap.midco.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was surfing the web and came across your site.&nbsp; I am very
interested in ghosts, but a little afraid of them as well.&nbsp; I have
one experience of my own and one story of my sister's experience.</b>
<br><b>My husband and I live in Rapid City, SD and occasionally we like
to take a weekend vacation up to Deadwood, SD.&nbsp; We decided to go to
Deadwood one Saturday and just gamble for the day, not expecting to stay
there.&nbsp; A winter storm came in and we got stranded up there without
any reservations at any hotel.&nbsp; We checked around and found the only
room available was at the Bullock Hotel.&nbsp; Me being fascinated with
ghosts thought this was great, as I have always heard the Bullock is haunted
by Seth Bullock. who was the sheriff there in the 1800's.&nbsp; When we
got to our room, we opened the door and right away I got a very uneasy
feeling (I'm getting goose bumps now as I'm remembering this).&nbsp; I
chalked it up to excitement and we proceeded into the room.&nbsp; My husband
started checking out the bathroom (as that's the first room he always checks)
and we both noticed alot of dead flies all over the room and in the bathroom.
We went to the front desk and told them about all the dead flies and they
assured us that the room was just cleaned.&nbsp; We went back to the room
and at this time my husband started getting a very uneasy feeling as well
and we decided we didn't really want to meet Seth after all and we went
back to the desk and begged for another room.&nbsp;&nbsp; That was about
2 years ago and we haven't been back to Deadwood to stay since then.</b>
<br><b>My sister's story as she's told me goes like this:</b>
<br><b>My sister works at a gold company here in Rapid City and she has
recently been visited by the ghost that haunts the building.&nbsp; She
works in the mold section of the plant and she often hears footsteps and
sees shadows when she is working in the room by herself.&nbsp; She said
she was working on something one day by herself and all of a sudden the
room got cold and the hair on her neck stood up and she felt someone tap
her on the shoulder, of course she turned around and no one was there.&nbsp;
She also said sometimes her and her coworker will be looking for a mold
that was on the table one minute and gone the next.&nbsp; They have turned
the room upside down looking for the mold and can't find it anywhere, the
next day it will be sitting in the middle of her desk.&nbsp; The night
guards have also reported that when the plant is closed at night they will
often hear footsteps going up and down the halls but when they look on
the security camera's there isn't anyone there.&nbsp; She has said the
she isn't the only one who has had experiences and that other people have
felt cold spots and have heard whispering when no one was there.</b>
<br><b>Thank you for letting me share these stories, I have told people
about my experience before and they all act as if they don't believe me.
I am glad that there is a site out there like this one for people to share
there stories without having to be afraid of not being believed or made
fun of.</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Where do I start.&nbsp; I'm 16 years old and a junior in high school.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>nationality is Laos but I was born in Thailand and we moved to america
when I was only</b>
<br><b>4 or 5.&nbsp; If you guys dont know by now asian culture believes
in</b>
<br><b>ghost,supernatural,black magic and etc.&nbsp; I've had many encounters
with spirits or ghost if</b>
<br><b>you want to call them that.&nbsp; When I was growing up I would
always fall asleep</b>
<br><b>and sunddenly wake up and not be able to move,speak,or open my eyes.&nbsp;
The only</b>
<br><b>thing i could do is listen to whats going on around me.&nbsp; My
culture calls</b>
<br><b>this "Pee Um"&nbsp; which means alot of things.&nbsp; It means when
a ghost is messing or</b>
<br><b>playing around with you while your sleeping, it also means that
a ghost might</b>
<br><b>be tryin to posses you.&nbsp; Sure I know what your thinking if
a ghost can do it</b>
<br><b>while your sleeping why cant he just do it when your awake.&nbsp;
Well we believe</b>
<br><b>that when your sleeping you let your gaurd down and that lets them
do whatever</b>
<br><b>they want to you unless you have a dead loved one looking over you(
but thats a</b>
<br><b>story for another day).&nbsp; I'm pretty sure this has happened
to most of you but</b>
<br><b>didn't think much of it.&nbsp; But if this does happen and you feel
like something</b>
<br><b>isnt right and most of the time it isn't.&nbsp; FIGHT with all your
might and try</b>
<br><b>to move while praying to whomever you believe in and do not give
up until you</b>
<br><b>can move again.&nbsp; This has happened to me plenty of times when
i was growing up.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I would sometimes fight it until i could move but sometimes
it would be so</b>
<br><b>strong it can hold out for a 1/2 an hour at times and i would just
relax and</b>
<br><b>fall back asleep and then be fine again.&nbsp; But just recently
when i was 15 when</b>
<br><b>this "Pee Um" happened i was in the living room watching t.v. when
i dosed off</b>
<br><b>but i was used to it by now so i just started to fight it.&nbsp;
But the wierd</b>
<br><b>thing is i notice i could open my eyes and it didnt have any weight
on it.&nbsp; But i</b>
<br><b>was kinda scared because this is the first time i could ever open
my eyes and</b>
<br><b>i didnt want to because i didnt know what i was gonna and plus if
i did see</b>
<br><b>anything i wouldnt be able to do anything.&nbsp; But i slowly opened
it and as i did</b>

<br><b>me and her head turned facing me.&nbsp; I didnt get a good look
at her face because</b>
<br><b>i quickly closed my eyes oh and i forgot ot mention the t.v. was
on and thats</b>
<br><b>why i got such a good look at her body.&nbsp; I quickly prayed and
fought to move</b>
<br><b>and it didnt take long until i could move my body and she wasnt

<br><b>Terrified that it would happen again i went to my brothers room
and slept on</b>

<p><b>I Have a Haunting Sighting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: The HSPVA Vocal Student</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I attend HSPVA ((High School for the Performing and Visual Arts))in
Down town Houston, Texas. Just off the art hallway in the outdoor classroom
there is some kind of presence. The outdoor classroom is a large stone
courtyard with an old basket ball backet and an small wooded stage that
the theatre students use ocasionaly. It's said that before the school was
built a young women was burried there. I don't know if I believe that's
ture or not but when ever i walk through the outdoor classroom bymyself
I feel like somone is watching me or somtimes even follow me but when I
turn around no one's there. I've talked to some of the other students and
they feel the same way when they take that short class to the other classrooms.
So most students and even some of the teachers avoid taking it as a short
cut and walk all the way to the other side of the building to get in. Some
of the Art students are freeked out about the ghost and wont even go out
there when their teacher tells them to go and draw a still life picture
of the tree branches that extend out over the classroom putting it almost
compleatly in it's shade.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Experiences: True Life</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: wild19blond84@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I saw the shadowlands talking about the Travelers Rest area ghosts.
The only insane isylam(sp?) or TB Hospital or prison that was haunted in
or around the Greenville, South Carolina area WAS the one off of Rutherfordton
Road. I have personally experienced it myself; before it was burnt down
by a homeless man trying to stay warm. Or at least that's what the police
told the public. Since I was 10 I went to that place to try and be scared.
One of my best friends lived about 5 blocks away. We would walk over there
and get goosebumps just by feeling the cold breeze you feel as you walk
by. Then a few years ago it had been awhile since my friends and I had
been in there. We decided it was time to test our fears. That was the wrong
idea. It was Halloween at 12 a.m. We were dumb. We were so scared from
the lights and noises and shadows by the time we got out we never went
back; until the day I turned on the news and saw it burning to the ground.
It wasn't reported but a week before that one of the neighbors told me
that a small fire started and it had to be ghosts because cops were patrolling
like always and there could NOT be homeless people living there. Then it
burned down? No investigators or ambulances were ever there to take the
alive/dead homeless man to the hospital.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Railroad Line</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: riley.koti@btinternet.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Last night (about 9:15pm) I decided to cycle from my house in Meonstoke,
Hampshire, to my friend Pippa's house in Droxford, the neighbouring village.&nbsp;
It had been a long time since I had last cycled there using the back route.&nbsp;
I took a wrong turn and ended up going down the railway line.&nbsp; I thought
I could get off the railway line, but then realised I had gone far too
far and decided I had to turn back.&nbsp; As I started cycling back up
the track, even though Id past no-one apart from a middle-aged couple on
the way down, I could see a black hooded figure coming towards me.&nbsp;
I was cycling quickly, but I know what I saw was a ghost.&nbsp; It was
completely covered in a black robe, apart from it's face which was pale.&nbsp;
I find it very difficult to recall any features, only that it had quite
a large nose, and smokey eyes.&nbsp; It didnt make eye-contact as it went
past even though I looked at it.&nbsp; Also, it seemed to almost glide
or hover, and almost slid to the side to pass me.&nbsp; There was little
movement in its robes, which covered everything apart from its expressionless
face.&nbsp; I couldnt even make out hands or feet.&nbsp; I just cycled
non-stop until I came out onto the main road again.&nbsp; I must have been
somewhere near Newtown when I saw the ghost-a long way from Droxford.&nbsp;
My dad refuses to believe me, just saying that it must have been a tramp
and that my mind was playing tricks on me.&nbsp; But believe me,I was there
and I know what I saw.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Ghost in the Basement</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: nkittinger@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I live in Round Lake Beach, Illinois, which is north-east of chicago.
the neighboorhood i live in was built in the late '70s as summer homes,
but are now occupied year-round.</b>
<br><b>Since the house on the north-west corner of the intersection of
Heather Ter. and Williams Ave. was built, every family that's lived there
has had someone living in that house die. The belief here, is that those
people haunt at least two of the four houses on that intersection, the
one that's in the north-east corner, and the one in the south-east (my
house).</b>
<br><b>There are three known deaths that have taken place in the house
on the north-west corner: an older man drowned in the bathtub, a baby fell
out of a second-story window, and a little girl, whose death is unknown
to any of the people in the neighboorhood now. Each family moved away shortly
after each death occurred.</b>
<br><b>(note: the family currently living there has a son, who tried to
committ suicide, and would have succeeded, except he recieved a phone call,
and a family member went to look for him. they still do not know who called
for him; they have been unable to trace the number)</b>
<br><b>My family has lived here for 5, going on 6, years, and we perchased
the house from other family members. We were told then that there was "something
wearing parachute pants" in the basement. We were told of doors opening
and closing without anyone around, things falling over, strange things
of that nature. We thought nothing of it.</b>
<br><b>Soon after we moved in, my father went over-seas for work, and,
at the time, i was not living int he house, so it was jsut my step mother.
At night, she would hear the swooshing of parachute pants, and see lights
going on and off. She called the police more than once, only to have the
hosue and perimeter searched to find nothing, and no trace of anybody having
been there.</b>
<br><b>My father and i, after he returned, witnessed it, too. Both of us
were upstairs, and hears our VERY HEAVY garage/basement door open and shut.
It was during the day, so the idea of it being an intruder didnt even cross
our minds. He searched the house, i searched outside, we both came up with
nothing.</b>
<br><b>Our house is not the only one that has experienced things like this.
The house north of ours, directly across the street from the home where
each family has a member die, has a little girl in it.</b>
<br><b>Shortly after we moved in to our home, the owners of the home north
of ours, on the other side of the street, sold theirs. I befriended the
daughter of the family that bought it, and her and i had many sleep-overs
together, always hearing a little girl laughing, and whistling, in the
middle of the night, wihtout a tv on. As it turns out, the previous owners
had experienced the same sort of thing, as well as toys being moved, and
their dog barking wildly at idle children's objects.</b>
<br><b>perhaps the most convincing thing to happen lately is the energy
that can be felt in my basement. there are also cold spots, and when candles
are lit, they flicker wildly, no matter how new or old, hot cold, anything.
they always flicker. i spend a lot of time in the basement, and often hear
parachute pants, and it seems to correlate with lighting candles, like
that's what makes him come out to say hello. recently, a very close friend
of mine who didnt know about our haunting spent the night. we were sitting
quietly in the basement, with candles burning, and one began to flicker.
suddenly, my friend began crying, as if moved our touched emotionally.
he then said "don't be afraid, he's not mean. he's facinated with you.
not with humanity in general, but you in particular. he comes when you're
writing, and when you light candles." a few seconds later, the flickering
stopped. i asked my friend what he was saying/doing, and if it was some
sort of prank (although he's not the type to do that). he said that he
felt as if he were being "told" to say that, like he was channeling a thought.
to this day, i have not told said friend about the guy in the parachute
pants in my basement, nor have i decided whether or not it was actually
himt hat was speaking through my friend. taht can be for you to decide.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Struck by a Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: char_fukin_rocks@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>In the mid 1970s I was about 1 1/2 years old my parents rented an
apartment in a small town in upstate NY called Pavilion.&nbsp; My mother
was never a believer in hauntings and ghosts but that all changed.. The
young couple who lived there prior to us had a new baby and the father
worked nights.&nbsp; Being it was an old&nbsp; house converted to apatments
the living room in our apartment had a door with a chain lock.&nbsp; The
young mother thought the house to be haunted and while her husband worked&nbsp;
she would lock her and her baby in the living room until her husbands shift
was done.&nbsp; Well of course my mother thought she might be a little
nuts and thought nothing of it.&nbsp; Until one night my aunt and uncle
and grandparents were over playing cards.&nbsp; They were all in the kitchen
dining room area at the table.&nbsp; That is where the entrance door to
our apartment and the outside door for both apartments was, our door was
all plate glass and beyond that was the stairway leading to the upstairs
apartment.&nbsp; Well as they were playing cards they heard walking accross
the floor and dishes rattling in the upstairs apartment no one thought
anything of it.&nbsp; That is until they saw both upstairs tenents walk
in the front door, my father called to them before they went upstairs and
asked if they had anyone upstairs and they said no why? My father then
proceded to tell them about all the noise they had been listening to.&nbsp;
So my father and John that was the guys name , went and checked everything
out</b>
<br><b>and found nothing out of the ordinary.&nbsp; I began to talk when
I was nine months old and could talk full sentences by the time I was 1
1/2 years old.&nbsp; Well I had developed an "imaginary" friend named Steve.&nbsp;
I would talk about Steve to my parents and they shrugged it off as nothing.&nbsp;
Sometimes I would come to my mom and say Steve hit me tell him to stop
and my mom would do so jus to make me feel better.&nbsp; Well one day I
was in my playroom with "Steve" and my mother was doing dishes she could
see me perfectly from where she was when suddenly I screamed "no Steve
please don't hit me" and jus then my mother seen my fly backwards as if
I was struck.&nbsp; She ran in to pick me up and I wouldn't calm down and
begged her to yell at Steve and tell him to never hit me again.&nbsp; So
my mother yelled "Don't you hit my daughter again"&nbsp; and I calmed down.&nbsp;
She told me I never talked about him again.&nbsp; Some years later she
told me the story and I had memorys come back to me of the apartment layout
etc that proved the memorys were real (not immagined cause she told me
the story).&nbsp; And I discribed to her a man in a dark coat I wanna say
leather with glasses and yellow teeth leaning over me in my crib.&nbsp;
She had no recolection of any family or friends who fit that discription.&nbsp;
I get chills whenever I drive by that house to this day.</b><b></b>

<p><b>NEW HOME, NEW EXPERIENCE</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I MOVED INTO A DIFFERENT HOME ABOUT 3 YEARS AGO.&nbsp;
I HAVE SEEN GHOSTS IN THE TWO PREVIOUS PLACES THAT I LIVED IN. THEY WERE
NOT AN EERIE EXPERIENCE, JUST STRANGE. ABOUT A MONTH AGO, MY 15 YR. OLD
DAUGHTER WAS TAKING A SHOWER. I WAS AT OUR KITCHEN TABLE, WITH MY BACK
TO HER. SHE OPENED THE DOOR TO COME OUT AND I THOUGHT SHE HAD TRIPPED OR
SOMETHING. I TURNED IN MY CHAIR TO LOOK AND SAW A BLOND HAIRED BOY WALK
PAST ME.&nbsp; I DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF IT BECAUSE I HAVE A BLOND BOY.&nbsp;
HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO ONE THERE.&nbsp; IN FACT MY SON WAS STILL IN BED.
WELL, I DIDN'T WANT TO FRIGHTEN MY DAUGHTER SO I ASKED HER WHAT THE NOISE
WAS ALL ABOUT-DID SHE TRIP OR WHAT?&nbsp; SHE SAID SHE WAS JUST FIXING
HER TOWEL AND BUMPED IN TO THE DOOR.&nbsp; I LEFT IT AT THAT. A FEW MINUTES
LATER SHE SAID THAT SHE WASN'T FUMBLING WITH HER TOWEL, BUT SHE FELT LIKE
SOMEONE HAD RUSHED PAST HER, AND SHE HAD GOOSEBUMPS AND FELT WEIRD.&nbsp;
SO I SAID, TO BE HONEST, I SAW SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE MADE YOU FEEL
AS THOUGH SOMEONE HAD WALKED PAST YOU.&nbsp; WE TALKED ABOUT IT A LOT AND
SHE SEEMED TO BE OK ABOUT. ALTHOUGH SHE SLEPT ON THE COUCH FOR A FEW DAYS
RATHER THAN UPSTAIRS IN HER BED.</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Own Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: blueraindropsfallintotheoceansky@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I love your site its really awesome!!!Well i finally convince my
self to write all the experiences I had have through out my life.My name
is Tommy and I am from Chicago Illinois.It all started when i was around
7 or 8.I live in a apartment with my parents and my older brother.Everytime
I went to sleep it was always something new that I would dream about but
the ones that really scare me back then was that one night I had a terrible
dream.I woke up sweating I was so scare from the dream I had when I turn
to the wall.I saw the most ugly thing in my life which I think it was the
face of the devil because it was red and it had 2 horns.I look at it for
a moment and then cover up my whole face until the next day.Then it was
another time when again the same thing happen i woke up having a bad dream
but this time when I look around I saw in the corner of the wall someone
dress in all black just staring at me.Also its another thing that happen
to me in that same room.I woke up one night screaming and crying because
while I was sleeping I felt someone poking my face with needles over and
over again.I told my parents but they told me to go back to sleep they
didn't believe me.Then years pass and we move to a house of our own.Now
I'm 15.Well the first weeks the hou was fine I like it.But then at night
strange things used to happen.One night I was sleeping when I started to
hear foot steps, like if someone was walking around my bed.Then all of
the sudden they stop.But a few minutes later I hear the foot steps again
but this time they&nbsp; were heading towards the side of the bed&nbsp;
where I was.They stop right where I had my pillow.Then I felt this cold
hand touch my shoulder.This hand felt right if like the one from old man
kind of heavy.I was so scare I didn't want to turn around to see what was
that.I felt like I was going to pass out.Then again every night after 12
I heard foot steps around my bed.A couple of months later I remember it
was a sunday morning and it was around 7am.I was half way sleep when all
of the sudden someone touch my right hand and kind of pull one of my fingers.Thats
when I woke up so scare and look everywhere but saw no one but my mom putting
some make up and looking at the mirror.I ask her why she did that and she
say and swears that she never touch my hand while I was sleeping.Then weeks
pass by I still kept hearing foot steps and one night I was looking at
the wall for some reason I couldn't go to sleep and all of the sudden I
saw a red circle on the wall but I didn't pay much attention to it.A few
seconds I look at it again and when I gave it all my attention it started
to move all around the wall like in a pattern but I was surprise at this
because I didn't felt scare at all.Everything stop as time pass by.But
then last year I started to get scare again when my older brother who is
always serious about things and don't believe in ghosts or anything like
that woke up in the middle of the night screaming in this weird way.And
he stop until my mom went to wake him up.This keep happening.But he never
mention nothing about this until he finally one day told me what he felt
everytime he scream.He says that he saw this black shadow of a man standing
there looking at him.When all of the sudden this man starts to choke him
and his find h self trying to fight against this man.To be honest everytime
he screams in the middle of the night he sound just like if they where
choking him because thats not a normal scream, I mean you can tell the
difference of the way he screams at night.He also told me about the old
apartment where we used to live and he says that he always used to see
this white person standing right on the corner of the wall and look at
him but he never pay much attention.My mom never believe me until this
year when I told her everything that used to happen to me as I grew up.Thats
when my brother talk about his experiences.Well thats all I have to tell.If
there anyone that can really help me out and explain me why I had always
experience this weird things as I grew up.Thank you.</b>

<p><b>The Prank</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: maybmoody@adelphia.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>On my 20th birthday, my best friend Laur and I decided we would go
out to celebrate. So we did what we had to do, and then we just went out
and had some fun. Then around 11 o'clock, a friend called us up and asked
us to a party. Of course we agreed, and went happily. When we got there
our friends said we would play a little game. So they took us in the basement,
and told us a whole bunch of crap to freak us out. Then the three of them
went up stairs, leaving us alone. By this time it was already 2 in the
morning and we were'nt tired at all. We waited for about ten minutes before
deciding to go see what the girls were doing. We went up the stairs only
to find the door locked. Out of no&nbsp; where the electricity went out,
and we freaked. So we went down the stairs, and sat down. A storm had risen
and we were just waiting for them to end their prank. But it seems not
only 15 minutes after we had been down there, a shadowy figure appeared
in the window. We didnt think much of it, cause we figured it was just
our friends. Then we noticed, we could see through it! We ran as fast as
we could up the stairs and tore down the door. Only finding no one in the
house.</b>
<br><b>The next day we congratulated our friends on spooking us, and asked
how they did it. They looked at us puzzled and asked "did what?" We told
them to stop playing around and that we know it was them that was standing
outside the window. They seemed stunned at what we had just said, and told
us that every last one of them had left the house about five minutes after
they had went upstairs.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Guardian</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: HBPBX@hammockbeach.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was about eighteen years old a friend needed a roommate, so
I moved in. his name was Justin and he was always doing silly things or
making up stories. Well not long after I moved in started telling me about
the ghost that lives in his house, he said it was a young girl about fifteen
or sixteen with long black hair, and she always wore a long white dress.
He told me that she never said anything she just would walk through the
rooms of the house very fast then disappear. Now if that didn’t freak me
out already, he told me that the girl looked just like me. I didn’t take
him very seriously and blew it off.</b>
<br><b>One night I heard a scream in the middle of the night I ran into
his room and he was lying there in his bed with the covers up to his neck
pale as a sheet. He said he saw someone standing at the foot of his bed
and thought it was me , when he asked her what she was doing she just disappeared
into thin air. That night Justin would not sleep in his room he kept insisting
that I trade rooms with him. So that night we stayed up and switched bedrooms,
it took us all night. By the end of the night I was convinced that he pulled
this little show so that he could have the bigger bedroom.</b>
<br><b>One night my boyfriend and I were suppose to meet up after work,
but I had to stay an extra hour so I told him to go to my house and wait
for me while I finished up. When I got there Sean was sitting outside,
I thought maybe that he couldn’t find the key I had hidden outside. When
I got out of the car and walked up to him I noticed the worried look on
his face. I asked him what was wrong, why hadn’t he went inside? He said
that he did then got the crap scared out of him, I asked him what he was
talking about and he said that he went in and was laying on the couch watching
TV when all of a sudden the door opened up and this person walked in that
he didn’t recognize. He couldn’t make out their face. He said hello to
the person but they just ignored him and started walking towards the back
of the house. He said he got up and went after them since they didn’t say
anything he thought it might be some kind of burglary or home invasion.
When he caught them he put his hand on their shoulder and tried to stop
them his hand went right through the person back. Then they just faded
away and&nbsp; no one was there.</b>
<br><b>Nothing more happened for a long time after that. During the winter
that year our heater broke. One night the temperature went down to 20 degrees
it was freezing in our house. My boyfriend stayed over and we were sleeping
on our sides I had my arm and leg draped over the side of him trying to
keep warm. in the middle of the night I woke up because I was really hot
I was sweating and I could barley breathe . I started to tell Sean to get
off of me that I was hot he didn’t move so I said it again and told him
that he was suffocating me . When he didn’t listen I threw back my shoulder
and rolled over when I looked over my shoulder a girl was standing there,
not a really girl but a shadow of a girl she was all black. She yelled
“Nancy it’s only me, it’s only me Nancy.” Then she took off across the
room and jumped on to the wall, then ran up it and blended with the shadows,
and was gone. I could not believe what had just happened I have never seen
anything like that in my life, I thought I must have been dreaming, but
I looked over and Sean was still lying there sleeping. I convinced myself
that it was a dream and went back to sleep but deep down I knew it was
real, I thought people would think I was crazy.</b>
<br><b>Shortly after I moved back in with my parents I told my mom and
sister what happened they thought that maybe she was my guardian angel
trying to keep me warm or that it was the ghost and that she liked me or
that I was dreaming there’s just no telling</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tropicskittle003@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I'm 12 years old turning 13 in September. I've always wanted to have
a ghost experience because my mother was enthuisatic about ghosts. However
she died three days before my seventh birthday. I had a dream about her
the eve of my birthdate. We were in a attic of a resturant on Block Island,
RI. She was wearing her favorite outfit, a black wolf shirt, and a pair
or cut off jean shorts. A light was around, I asked her "Where are your
wings?" She smiled and said "Honey, I don't have them yet. Don't worry
about me, I'm happy now." Then I woke up. That was my first meeting with
the un-explained. After her death we moved into a old house, built in 1776,
it's had many renovations. A creek once ran through the basement, but the
people who owned it before got it covered with cement. There is a large
tunnel that extends a ways also. The house had many purposes, in my father's
room it was a corner store owned by my great, great, grandfather. In the
kitchen and den it was a tavern. The tavern was said to be haunted by the
devil, because a man saw the apperation and died shortly after. A man who
lived in this house also got decapitated in the mill behind my backyard.
Now, I believe something haunts here, actually two, one evil and one friendly.
When we first moved in, me and my friends were petrified to go past the
basement door, we couldn't speak loudly in the den, we whispered. Whenever
they would sleep over we would have to huddle together, scared out of our
minds, it was near halloween too. A odd smell would hang around also. Five
years later, I always here walking upstairs when I'm alone, even my cousin
has heard it, she ran outside almost in tears. Our story is the same; large
footsteps walks across, and then a sudden crash, then more foot steps and
a sudden crash. Then I hear something fall and break like glass, but when
I go upstairs there's nothing broken, a eerie silence fills the air and
I'm forced to run outside. One time, I was feeding my ferrets in the den,
when I froze with terror, a white orb flew from the stairway around my
head, and into the basement. Once it vanished a felt a sensation of someone
watching me and I fled up the stairs because I thought someone was chasing
me. No adult has ever heard anything they've mocked me, but you can ask
any child thats been in this house and they'll tell you.</b>

<p><b>A Junction of Hauntings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:largo@iol.ie</b><b></b>
<p><b>I’ve always been aware that my house was haunted, the first time
I saw anything was when I was 7 or 8.</b>
<br><b>I think It’s just unfortunate where my house is situated, it seems
almost unreal actually. I live in a house that is nearly 200 years old,
it is built on the grounds of an old prison, at the back of my house are
fields where there used to be an abbey but at one time the abbey was raided
and the monks were hung from trees round about, some of these trees are
still standing.&nbsp; On either side of my semi-detached house are 2 churches
and one graveyard, across the road was an old hospital, since demolished
but renowned for how haunted it was, just up from the site of this old
hospital is a famine graveyard that wasn’t’ discovered until some unfortunate
people built their house on it.</b>
<br><b>I believe there are at least 3 different spirits in residence in
my home.&nbsp; One is a lady, dressed in Victorian clothing.&nbsp; I’ve
only ever seen her on the stairs.&nbsp; We have wooden bars running down
my stairs so you can see all the steps. To go from the kitchen to the living
room you have to pass by the side of the stairs.&nbsp; One evening I was
going from my kitchen into the living room to watch the T.V. when I felt
the hairs stand up on my neck and for some reason got the urge to look
over my shoulder onto the stairs, there right beside me this lady was coming
down the stairs.&nbsp; I know these spirits wont harm me but it didn’t
stop me running out of the house into the back garden in the middle of
winter to wait for someone to come back before I’d go back in.</b>
<br><b>When ever I’m in the hallway at the foot of these stairs I always
fell like there is someone behind me, the phone is in the hall and I can’t
sit and talk unless my back is against the wall or I spend the whole time
looking over my shoulder. The second spirit I have never actually seen,
he is a regular in the house noise wise.&nbsp; We have a room at the foot
of the stairs where we keep our piano.&nbsp; We know at one time a german
man lived in the house probably the 3rd last person before us.&nbsp; He
apparently also used to have a piano in that room but at a different wall.&nbsp;
Every night at around 10 minutes to one o’clock the scrapping of wood on
wood can be heard in this room, I’m assuming he’s slowly trying to change
the position of the piano.&nbsp; Its been happening since my parents moved
into the house which was before I was born about 24 years ago.&nbsp; I’m
assuming he’s been doing this for a while because when my parents got the
house after the old lady who had lived there died that door was sealed
shut with paint and had to be broken in.&nbsp; This fellow is not very
scary as this is all he does.</b>
<br><b>The third resident that I’m aware of is not as pleasant as the other
two.&nbsp; Maybe he was one of the residents of the old prison I don’t
know but I do know that it is a man.</b>
<br><b>I have encountered him on many occasions mostly in my bedroom.&nbsp;
Once while I was about 12 I was standing in front of the mirror in my bedroom
pulling faces, as kids do, having tired of this I started to leave the
room, just as I did so I heard a man hoarsely whisper for me to stay.&nbsp;
The rest of my family were downstairs.&nbsp; He only succeeded in making
fly down the stairs faster then I ever had before. The next time I heard
him wasn’t until about 2 years ago.&nbsp; It was in the middle of the night
and I wasn’t really listening to him since he was only whispering so I
couldn’t make out what he had said.</b>
<br><b>I had 2 scary encounters with this man.&nbsp; Once while I was in
my brothers bedroom playing on his computer the hairs on my neck went up
and I felt a shiver, I recognised “the someones coming” feeling I suppose
you could call it and got up to leave the bedroom.&nbsp; When I tried to
open the door it was shut tight, strange since my house is very old so
even if a door is closed and locked it still rattles loosely.&nbsp; I got
very scared and started to scream and shout while flinging myself against
the door, after about 5 minutes the door swung open and I fell out since
I was banging against it.&nbsp; At the bottom of the stairs (which is directly
infront of my brothers bedroom) stood my brother, he was telling me to
shut up as he couldn’t hear the television down stairs with my screaming.&nbsp;
I ran down convinced that he had locked me in and told my mum.&nbsp; She
however insisted that he had only left the room once and that was when
he went to the bottom of the stairs to call me.</b>
<br><b>The second scary incident was when I was asleep.&nbsp; I dreamed
that a man was standing over me and was leaning on my chest restricting
my breathing but not choking me.&nbsp; Suddenly I woke up and everything
was how I’d dreamt it except I could no longer see the man but I could
still faintly feel his hands.</b>
<br><b>Apart from all this I’ve experienced the usual, lights being turned
on and off, footsteps, televisions being turned on and off etc.</b>
<br><b>I do think though that their presence makes my old rickety house
way more interesting.</b>

<br><b>My Mothers House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MrsShaggy2Dope76@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>-This story isn't about me, but it's about my mothers childhood home.
My mother and I are very close and she often tells me stories about a house
she lived in when she was my age. She lived with my Grandma and her 6 sisters.
This house is located in Honeybrook, Pennsylvania. It's a big 3 story house.
My grandma&nbsp; now lives in Virginia. My family (my cousins and aunts
and uncles) goes to visit her for 2 weeks every summer. I have a big family
since my grandma had 7 daughters. I have 19 cousins all together. My cousin
Josh and I are both 15 and are very close. One night last summer my family
went out to eat and my cousin and I stayed at home with my grandma. We
played video games for a while then I asked my grandma about the house
they lived in. She said at night she would hear tapping sounds on the wall
above her bed, and that the bathroom sink in her bedroom would often turn
on by itself.&nbsp; My aunt Loretta (Josh's mom) said that she used to
see a little girl in her room at night playing with her toys and told my
grandma about her. My grandma told us that she let Loretta sleep in her
room, and she slept in Loretta's room. The first night she didn't see the
little girl but the second night she did. She said she wasn't scared of
the little girl at all. After that night more weird things started happening.
There was only 4 girls living with my grandma at this time because my 3
oldest aunts had moved out and got married. My mom and my aunt Tracy shared
a room, and my aunt Loretta and my aunt Rose had their own rooms because
they were older. One night about a week after my granda seen the little
girl, my aunt Rose came downstairs crying and asked if she could sleep
downstairs. So my grandma let all the girls sleep downstairs that night
and play since it was saterday night. At about 1:30am they all went upstairs
screaming and woke my grandma up. They told her that they heard the pots
and pans in the kitchen being moved around. Then they said the curtains
in the living room started to open and close. So they all sat on my grandmas
bed or awhile and they listened to the sounds downstairs. When my grandma
heard them she decided it was time to move. She looked around for a new
house and found one she liked. About a month later she was packed and ready
to move. It was their last night at the house and my grandma was laying
in bed trying to fall asleep. Then she heard he door creek open but it
was to dark to see who it was. She figured it was one of the girls coming
to lay with her so she waited for them to get on the bed, and about 15
seconds later the cover flew off her. She turned the light on but no one
was there and the door was closed. I believe this story is true because
my grandma is a very serious person...and I've heard the same exact story
from all my aunts.</b>

<br><b>How can I ignore and trash the Unknown?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: RudyBM111743@msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have witnessed several incredible paranormal occurrences.&nbsp;
They continue to the present time and I can't describe enough how bewildered
I am each time they occurred.&nbsp; However, I still do not know what is
in these occurrences for me.&nbsp; Not knowing the why and the what for,
my indifference and loss of interest in them have begun to set in.&nbsp;
But how can I completely ignore these occurrences if they are so bewildering!&nbsp;
On May 22, 2004, I had just installed a new lock to a damaged door.&nbsp;
To complete the job, the plywood skin at the bottom of the door which had
peeled off the frame had to be glued back on.&nbsp; I applied some glue,
but the plywood skin stubbornly kept prying off.&nbsp; I was able to hold
down the skin at the corner of the door with a clamp but not along the
width; there was not enough space between the bottom edge of the door and
the floor for the clamp.&nbsp; So it needed to be tacked in with at least
three finishing nails.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this work place, we buy materials
as needed and do not stock supplies such as nails, so I did not know where
to find the nails that I needed as I entered the shop.&nbsp; There was
a plastic bin about half filled with wall (sheet rock) nails which looked
like newly bought.&nbsp; They may have been an excess or left over from
a recent wall repair job.&nbsp; I was mumbling to myself I'd be lucky if
I find three finishing nails in this bin of wall nails.&nbsp; So I grabbed
the wall nails in the bin two or three times, laid and spread them on the
table and started searching for luck!&nbsp; And luck there was!&nbsp; I
picked one piece of finishing nail after another three times during the
search!&nbsp; I was thankful and said I was glad you are with me again!&nbsp;
I set aside the three finishing nails, then grabbed the wall nails on the
table and returned them into the bin may be two or three times.&nbsp; I
went back to the job with the three precious finishing nails and nailed
the stubborn plywood skin.&nbsp; However, the minute I removed the clamp
from the corner of the door, the plywood skin would still pry itself off,
glue and all!&nbsp; So I needed one more finishing nail for the corner
which was about 4 or 5 inches away from one of the three nails I had just
hammered in.&nbsp; I was already talking to myself where I would find this
last piece of finishing nail as I again went downstairs and entered the
shop.&nbsp; I was sure the three nails I was so lucky to find after searching
the first time were all there was among the wall nails.&nbsp; So I said,
you have to give me this one last nail if you are really with me!&nbsp;
Again I started grabbing the wall nails in the bin.&nbsp; After two or
three times doing this, the bin was almost empty but for a few pieces of
wall nails.&nbsp; As my fingers grasped these remaining wall nails, there
it was, one lonely, last finishing nail was between my fingers!&nbsp; I
could not believe this incredible episode!&nbsp; I was thankful and really
bewildered (again), but had to go back to the door and finish the job.</b>
<br><b>To this writing I am still trying hard to convince myself that this
incident is nothing out of the ordinary.&nbsp; However I have yet to answer
some questions lingering in my mind to do so.&nbsp; Why is it that there
were exactly 3 nails when I was looking for 3 nails that I needed the first
time?&nbsp; Where did these three nails come from?&nbsp; Why were there
no other kinds of nails in the bin?&nbsp; If there had been, this would
have meant that the bin contained all sorts of left over nails thrown into
it - a very common way hardware materials, particularly nails, are kept
in any residential or commercial maintenance shops and therefore, the presence
of the finishing nails would leave nothing to ponder over.&nbsp; What about
the last, lonely finishing nail that I desperately needed to complete the
job?&nbsp; Could it be that I did not look hard enough in the bin the first
time I searched?&nbsp; Why didn't it appear the first time?&nbsp; And here
again, why were there 4 finishing nails in the bin, exactly what the door
needed, and not 0 or 5 or more?&nbsp; Lastly, if the wall nails that were
in the bin were newly bought, what is the probability that 4 finishing
nails would be mixed with them at the time that they were bought and sacked
at the hardware store?&nbsp; Wouldn't it be perhaps 1 in 4 million or more?&nbsp;
What answers to these questions will convince me that this episode can
be nailed as nothing but an uneventful coincidence?&nbsp; Please email
me some answers.&nbsp; It will help clear uncertainties and anxiety.&nbsp;
So, how can I ignore and trash this incident and the Unknown?</b><b></b>

<p><b>Fullerton Ca Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: alton.brook@centurytel.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Having graduated from college, I moved to Fullerton, CA to take a
new employment position with an</b>
<br><b>engineering company.&nbsp; I moved into an apartment just south
of Cal State Fullerton and started experiencing things immediately.</b>
<br><b>The weirdest room in the apartment was the bathroom.&nbsp; Everyone
who went into it</b>
<br><b>jokingly commented that they felt they were being watched.&nbsp;
It was so bad that you really didn’t want to close your eyes while in the
shower.</b>
<br><b>On two occasions, there was an outbreak of flies in just the bedroom…they
would not go into any other room.&nbsp; There was no trash or fruit left
out or new plants brought in that might explain such</b>
<br><b>an occurrence.&nbsp; I killed the flies and cleaned the carpet and
drapes but they returned once again about three months later.</b>
<br><b>The next thing that began happening is the gas wall heater would
seeming come on by itself in the</b>
<br><b>middle of summer.&nbsp; About three times a week, I would return
home from work to find the heater knob turned to high and the apartment
blazing hot.&nbsp; This went on until I moved.</b>
<br><b>A friend of mine moved in temporarily while he was looking for a
job.&nbsp; Since it was only a one bedroom apartment, he was sleeping in
the living room&nbsp; on the couch.&nbsp; One night I heard him talking
and went out to investigate.&nbsp; I asked him who he was talking to and
he said “you”.&nbsp; I told him that I had been in bed and he said that
I had been standing right in front of him in the darkened living room.&nbsp;
Because the room was so dark, he thought it was me and was asking what
I wanted.&nbsp; On a couple of other occasions, he would swear that he
saw a shadow moving by the dining area and going</b>
<br><b>into the kitchen. I didn’t own a kitchen table and put a desk in
the dining area by the front door.&nbsp; There were two wall lights behind
the&nbsp; desk and I would put my small drafting board on top of them to
get it out of the way.&nbsp; Because the walls were so flimsy,</b>
<br><b>the board would fall down onto the desk periodically when someone
used the front door.&nbsp; On one occasion, two friends of mine joined
my roommate and I on a weekend outing.&nbsp; As we left the apartment,
the drawing board crashed down onto the table and I commented not to worry
about it.&nbsp; When we returned later, my roommate and I went upstairs
and the other two people were in the parking lot.&nbsp; When we entered
the apartment, the drawing board was back up on the wall on top of one</b>
<br><b>of the lights.&nbsp; We ran to the window to get the attention of
my friends and tell them what happened.&nbsp; As we called down to them,
a pillow on the couch located on the adjacent wall was thrown across the
apartment toward the front door.&nbsp; The apartment manager was not very
helpful and I didn’t want him to think I was crazy.&nbsp; I moved out very
shortly after the pillow incident and have never experienced anything even
remotely similar.</b>

<br><b>My Aunt Came Back</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jc4653@sbc.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>As children growing up in Texas, we had a great Aunt we called NaNa.&nbsp;
She had no children, so she treated us like we were her own.&nbsp; She
lived in Laredo and we lived 150 miles north in San Antonio, so anytime
she came over for her monthly visits was a grand treat in itself.&nbsp;
We always knew that as long as she was there with us, our pockets were
always lined with change and our sweet-tooths were always satisfied.&nbsp;
About 9 years ago, it was determined that she was getting too ill to be
making trips back and forth, so we arranged for her to stay at my parent's
house the remainder of her days.&nbsp; She took over my room and I happily
resided in the living room.&nbsp; By this time I was a Junior in High School,
so I was able to research the illness that took over her.&nbsp; In the
end, she died peacefully of her complications due to Diabetes, but it was
still a tremendous loss.&nbsp; The funeral was in Laredo about a week later.</b>
<br><b>This past Friday, Memorial Day Weekend '04, I was in San Antonio
from Dallas visiting family and friends. On Friday, my buddies decided
to go to Mexico to enjoy cheap drinks and relive old partying rituals.&nbsp;
The trek down to Mexico was fun as always.&nbsp; Old stories and beer cans
were passed around as we made the 2 and a half hour trek south.&nbsp; As
we passed through Laredo, a somber feeling came over me.&nbsp; I started
to remember my Aunt, for whom I never came to lay flowers on her grave.&nbsp;
It had been almost 9 years since she was buried, and I never once made
the effort to come pay my respects or lay a wreath on her grave, and now
here I was, at a moments notice, loaded in a van with friends to enjoy
cheap drinks and women.</b>
<br><b>On Saturday morning we were enjoying breakfast at my parent's home.&nbsp;
My parents, and my two younger brothers were talking and enjoying each
others' company when I caught a white headed lady figure walk from the
living room to my old bedroom.&nbsp; I even heard the sounds of her slippers
rubbing against the hardwood flooring.&nbsp; What is strange is that my
brother heard it too. At first I thought it was my grandmother, who like
my aunt Nana (they were sisters), had white hair.&nbsp; I got up to see
if it was my grandparents, and realized we were alone in the house!&nbsp;
My aunt Nana must have come back home! The next night while trying to fall
asleep on the sofa, I heard dragging footsteps all night long, from my
bedroom to the kitchen.&nbsp; My Aunt Nana had come home, and apparently,
she was very thirsty!</b>

<p><b>Several Encounters</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jeannie84@earthlink.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, I am 20 years old, and my sister is big into the "hauntings"
and "spirits."&nbsp; She works as a Haunted Tour Guide for Houston and
tells me stories about several feelings she came across while at work.&nbsp;
Being the way I am, I became very interested in listening to her for several
reasons.&nbsp; My first real encounter, I would say would be when I lived
with my mom over my senior year of high school.&nbsp; My Mom and her husband
at the time would tell me about people seeing colored children and mothers
standing in the hall way.&nbsp; They said that before the house was built,
it used to be a plantation.&nbsp; Well, one night I was up late and I thought
I saw a figure of a little girl wearing a run-down dress in the corner
of the livingroom.&nbsp; Then, when I looked back, it was gone.&nbsp; So,
at the time I just shrugged it off.&nbsp; Well, I have not had any encounters
since about 6 months ago, when we moved into a rental house.&nbsp; It is
a highrise home with outside stairs to get up to the front door.&nbsp;
Come to find out, it was our landlords house when gro ng up.&nbsp; The
downstairs portion where our washer and dryer is, used to be a slaugther
house for cows.&nbsp; (kinda creepy if you ask me)&nbsp; Well, after we
first moved in here, late at night we would hear footsteps coming up the
stairs outside.&nbsp; One night, my husband was watching tv in the livingroom
and he woke me abruptly to get a shot gun, because he heard foot steps
coming up the stairs and onto the porch.&nbsp; The top stair is very distinct,
b/c it is partially broke, so it creaks when you walk up it.&nbsp; He went
outside and saw nothing.&nbsp; Then, a few days later, the light in my
bedroom burned out.&nbsp; I thought nothing of it but was out of money
and lightbulbs, so we just did not use it and used the lamp in our room.&nbsp;
Well, it was burned out for about a week, and around early morning, not
sure of the time really, the light turned on flourescent waking up my husband
and me.&nbsp; It was unusual, because I could sleep through a tornado or
sunlight, but it woke me up.&nbsp; Chris turned the light off and looked
and it was indeed burned out.&nbsp; Could a ghost be doing this?&nbsp;
Now for my last encounter.&nbsp; This one is really special to me due to
the circumstances.&nbsp; My husbands Cat of 10 years died earlier this
month due to bladder complications.&nbsp; Chris brought him home after
taking him to the vet to be put to sleep for they could not help him.&nbsp;
Chris loved on the cat and buried him in the front yard toward the fence
to the pasture.&nbsp; I was very torn apart since this cat was my bestfriend
over the past 2 years.&nbsp; He would always love on me and paw my bed
when he wanted to be loved on.&nbsp; Later that night, Chris was on the
couch, and I was laying in the bed crying, and all of a sudden it felt
like a cat jumped on my bed.&nbsp; I looked to see if it was the other
cat, and nothing was there.&nbsp; The other cat was in the livingroom with
my husband.&nbsp; I called my sister and asked if it could be wee wee.&nbsp;
She talked to her boss and said it pr ally was.&nbsp; Well, after telling
my husband, he got upset and told me to just let the cat go and be in peace.&nbsp;
I have done so for about a month now, and last night my husband and I got
into a fight, and I was sitting on the bed toward the headboard and crying.&nbsp;
All of a sudden I felt a pounce on the bed and it felt like a cat walking
and pawing the covers.&nbsp; I turned around to pet Bubba, the other cat,
and he was not there.&nbsp; I all of a sudden got a rush of happiness and
I emailed my sister to tell her my story.&nbsp; She told me it could really
be my husbands cat trying to comfort me like he always did when I cried.&nbsp;
I am not the only person who has felt his presence.&nbsp; My mother in
law has felt it on her bed too... she lives with us.&nbsp; I now really
believe that ghosts are about this house and that my husbands cat is still
here</b>

<p><b>An Ethereal Presence</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ROCKYTOPHOUND@cs.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>THIS IS A STORY HANDED DOWN IN MY FAMILY OF AN EXPERIENCE THAT HAPPENED
TO A FRIEND OF MY GRANDFATHERS IN TENNESSEE BACK IN THE 1920'S</b>
<br><b>BACK THEN THERE WAS A SIZABLE PORTION OF RURAL TENNESSEE THAT HAD
NONE OF THE NICETIES LIKE ELECTRICITY, CITY WATER AND SUCH. TRANSPORTATION
WAS DONE BY SHANKS MARE OR ON HORSEBACK MOST OF THE TIME AS MOST PEOPLE
COULD NOT AFFORD A CAR.</b>
<br><b>THERE WAS THIS OLD COLORED GENTLEMAN WHO LIVED WAY OUT IN THE COUNTRY
AND WORKED THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT AT THE ALUMINUM COMPANY. HE HAD NO CAR OR
HORSE SO HE WAS IN THE UNENVIABLE POSITION OF HAVING TO WALK TO WORK AND
BACK EVERY DAY, A DISTANCE OF ABOUT FIVE MILES EACH WAY.</b>
<br><b>ONE NIGHT, HE GOT READY AND STARTED HIS TREK TO WORK AS USUAL AND
EXPECTING NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY TO HAPPEN. UNFORTUNATELY, HE HAD
AN EXPERIENCE THAT AFFECTED THE REST OF HIS WORKING LIFE.</b>
<br><b>ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF THE WAY TO WORK, THERE HAPPENED TO BE A GULLY
THAT CUT SOME DISTANCE OFF OF THE WALK SO HE DECIDED TO TAKE IT THIS NIGHT.
HE HAD GONE A FEW HUNDRED YARDS WHEN HE SAW A TALL FIGURE COMING TOWARDS
HIM DRESSED IN A LONG FLOWING WHITE GARMENT. AT FIRST, HE THOUGHT THAT
IT WAS JUST ANOTHER PEDESTRIAN AND MOVED OVER A LITTLE ON THE TRAIL TO
LET HIM PASS. INSTEAD OF CONTINUING TO COME ON, THE PERSON?, STOPPED ON
THE TRAIL AND MOVED OVER TO HIS SIDE OF THE TRAIL BLOCKING HIS WAY. HE
STILL WASN'T OVERLY CONCERNED AS COLORED PEOPLE AT THAT TIME HAD TO PUT
UP WITH QUITE A BIT OF HARASSMENT SO HE MOVED OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE. THIS
THING THEN MOVED OVER TO THAT SIDE BLOCKING HIS WAY AGAIN AND THAT WAS
WHEN HE STARTED TO GET A LITTLE WORRIED. TO THAT POINT, HE HAD NOT TAKEN
A GOOD LOOK AT THE FIGURE AND HE DID SO THEN. THE THING WAS VERY TALL AND
WORE A LONG FLOWING GARMENT WITH A HOOD ON IT. HE THEN TOOK A GOOD LOOK
AT THE FACE OF THE THING, OR WHERE A FACE SHOULD HAVE BEEN, AND ALL THAT
WAS THERE WERE TWO RED GLOWING SPOTS WHERE THE EYES SHOULD HAVE BEEN. NOW,
HE WAS SCARED TO DEATH BUT HE STILL TRIED TO GO AROUND THAT THING SO HE
COULD GO TO WORK BUT IT WOULD NOT LET HIM PASS. HE FINALLY TURNED AROUND
AND WENT BACK HOME.</b>
<br><b>WHEN HE TOLD THEM AT THE PLANT OF HIS EXPERIENCE OF THE PREVIOUS
NIGHT, THEY THOUGHT TO A MAN THAT HE HAD HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK AND HE COULD
NOT CONVINCE THEM OTHERWISE.</b>
<br><b>WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS STORY ON THE SURFACE, YOU MIGHT THINK THAT
IT WAS A FIGMENT OF HIS IMAGINATION BUT ONE MORE THING HAPPENED THAT MAKES
YOU THINK THAT THERE MIGHT BE MORE TO THE STORY THAN THAT. AS I SAID AT
THE START OF THIS STORY, HE HAD TO WALK FIVE MILES TO AND FIVE MILES FROM
WORK EVERY NIGHT. AFTER THAT NIGHT AND FOR THE REST OF HIS WORKING YEARS,
HE CARRIED A DOUBLE-BARRELLED SHOTGUN WITH HIM EVERY NIGHT.</b>
<br><b>THAT WOULD SEEM TO ME TO BE A LOT OF EXTRA WEIGHT TO CARRY FOR SOMEONE
TRYING TO PULL A FAST ONE ON HIS BOSS AT WORK.</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Lizredsox17@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Though I have not have a paranormal experience in quite awhile, I
wanted to</b>
<br><b>write about a few that I have had in my lifetime. When I was younger,
about 8</b>
<br><b>or 9 I suppose, my Mom and I use to hear a baby crying in our old
house (not</b>
<br><b>where I live now) When everyone would go to bed, I use to hear a
tapping noise</b>
<br><b>every night. When I told my parents, they thought it was due to
an overreactive</b>
<br><b>imagination, but I defintely know that I heard it. I never did investigate
it</b>
<br><b>though....suppose at 9 I was a bit to scared to go down into the
basement</b>
<br><b>where I heard it!! Supposedly Indians lived where my old house was
built, so who</b>
<br><b>knows!</b>
<br><b>One of the best experiences I had was one afternoon I was sitting
in the</b>
<br><b>living room with my Mom. I was sitting on the couch so that I could
see down the</b>
<br><b>hallway. At the time I was not looking at the hallway and I heard
my Mom say</b>
<br><b>'Oh look, we have a visitor' and I thought she meant someone in
the drive way.</b>
<br><b>When I turned around to look at her and looked down the hallway,
I saw the</b>
<br><b>white, misty form float from my Mom's room to mine. It didn't really
have legs or</b>
<br><b>even a body really....just a misty white form. It didn't even seem
to notice</b>
<br><b>us. My Mom (as well as other women in my family) had the ability
to be</b>
<br><b>sensitive. Relatives have visited my Mom, Grandmother and my Aunt.</b>
<br><b>When I was in college, I remember one night I was driving my boyfriends
car</b>
<br><b>back to his house. It was about a 45 minute drive and it was the
dead middle of</b>
<br><b>winter. All of a sudden, the car just filled up with the smell of
fresh</b>
<br><b>flowers. As if it was the middle of summer!!! This happened a couple
of times as</b>
<br><b>well in my apartment.</b>
<br><b>In the fall of 2001 my best friend was killed in a tragic car accident
and I</b>
<br><b>took his death very hard. But the interesting thing was, about four
months</b>
<br><b>after his death, my room in the apartment would always be very cold.
Every other</b>
<br><b>room would be warm or comfortable. I remember saying 'Ok Harley,
I know you</b>
<br><b>are here...could we make it warm now!' And instantly the room would
warm up.</b>
<br><b>I've had other experiences with him as well, but that's for another
submission.</b>

<br><b>seems to watch us while we&sup1;re sleeping, it doesn&sup1;t seem
to want to harm us</b>
<br><b>but it just feels uncomfortable and creepy. Then myself and my partner
have</b>
<br><b>both seen a humanoid Œshape&sup1; pass our bathroom door heading
to the front</b>
<br><b>door of the flat, I have had this experience many many times, and
have</b>
<br><b>always shrugged it off. Until yesterday when my partner Sarah said
she had</b>
<br><b>seen it while brushing her teeth, (which is when I usually see it)
However I</b>
<br><b>have only got a very brief glimpse of a indistinct shadowy figure
passing by</b>
<br><b>rapidly, Sarah had a much better sighting and gave me a fuller description,</b>
<br><b>a woman, possibly the same figure that stands by the bedroom door,
early</b>
<br><b>middle age, about 5&sup1; tall and in monochrome like black and
white television.</b>
<br><b>Who this figure is I can&sup1;t explain, It does not appear to be
a family member</b>
<br><b>or friend who has gone on, not one we can identify anyway. There
has been no</b>
<br><b>previous buildings on the site, it was waste ground on the edge
of a housing</b>
<br><b>estate built in the Œ70s and had been orchards before that. The
only idea I</b>
<br><b>can come up with is that as Sarah is pregnant, it may be some kind
of</b>
<br><b>ŒGuardian&sup1; for the child, it is also well known that ŒSpirits
are drawn to</b>
<br><b>children as born out by the many many photographs of children with
orbs and</b>
<br><b>suchlike in them. This is not the only ghost we have, I have seen
my dog,</b>
<br><b>who died back in February aged 14, sitting on our bed as I walked
into the</b>
<br><b>bedroom, I didn&sup1;t think this was strange at all, I was used
to Ceilidh</b>
<br><b>sitting on the bed, I didn&sup1;t really take much notice, then
I suddenly</b>
<br><b>remembered that she was dead, and of course she wasn&sup1;t there
anymore. Sarah</b>
<br><b>has also seen an indistinct but colourful apparition on our ceiling
right</b>
<br><b>above my head, which she described as being Goblinlike. While these</b>
<br><b>intrusions are sometimes a bit uncomfortable, I do not feel scared
(yet) and</b>
<br><b>only want to see if they intensify in the coming weeks.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Great Aunt and Uncle</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: chermann@att.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I purchased a home that my great uncle had owned for more than 70
years.</b>
<br><b>Two years later I was helping a neighbor fix their bathroom. My</b>
<br><b>neighbors wife went to my house to use my bathroom&nbsp; because
hers was not</b>
<br><b>available. When she came back she described a man that had been
standing</b>
<br><b>in the hallway. She described a young version of my great uncle,
and</b>
<br><b>since he was young years before I was born I wasn't sure was to
say to</b>
<br><b>her. Later my mother found a picture of my great uncle that exactly</b>
<br><b>matched the man my friend had seen.</b>
<br><b>Later on when I was gutting the for the house, prior to restoration,&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>met my great aunt. I was tearing out the plaster above the space
where</b>
<br><b>her sewing machine was. Anyone who has&nbsp; bashed&nbsp; plaster
knows that it</b>
<br><b>has a bad smell, but when I was hammering the ceiling and dust and
dirt</b>
<br><b>was flying, I smelled a strong perfume smell and I knew my great
aunt</b>
<br><b>was there.</b>
<br><b>The house is in Frenchtown, NJ , and the ghosts never appeared after</b>
<br><b>those two incidents</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunted Church</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bjakennedy@supanet.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am a thirteen-year-old kid from a small town in the North East
of England. Everyone who I've told my ghost stories to have told me I'm
weird, but they are true.</b>
<br><b>At the bottom of the estate where I live, there is a methodist church
which has been abandoned for roughly five years. The inscription on the
front reads 'Primitive Methodist Chapel 1886' (I think it's 1886) and primitive
is the word. It is in a very poor state of repair. Anyway, there is no
graveyard directly connected with the chapel, but next door is a bar, then
there is a street down to some more houses, and then a river. Just along
from the river is a graveyard which is upon a site where there was a church
until World War 2 when it was demolished by enemy fire. The graveyard is
the only connection I can think of as to why ghosts have appeared. I have
to pass this chapel every day on my way to school and almost every day
I see a ghostly shape looking in a frustrated way at the surroundings.
I always sense that it is angry, but do not believe that it is an evil
spirit. I remember when the church was open that there was a ghost in the
same place, but it had the shape of a young woman looking sadly at the
graveyard. After the church closed and it started to deteriorate, the figure
slowly diminished to just a smoky form, and it's attitude definately changed,
but it is still there as strong as ever.</b>
<br><b>Once, some friends of mine broke into the old church as a dare.
They forced me to come with them. They led the way right up to the top
and all seemed ok. Then in the topmost section, I saw the ghost looking
out of the windows. None of my friends could see it but they all muttered
that they felt uneasy. Suddenly and with speed impossible for any ordinary
being, it turned, saw us and shouted in a deep, scary voice that echoed
around the room to get out. All of us felt our hair stand on end. The ghost
kept shouting and I am positive there was a force pushing us back. I never
wanted to be there in the first place and quickly ran out, with one of
my other friends following. We got out and ran all the way up the estate
to my house and stood in my bedroom shaking. Soon another one of my mates
came in white as a ghost and said that the other kid had been picked up
and thrown around the room, and then dropped out of the window. I did not
believe him (well, would you?) but as I went to school the next day there
was indeed a hole in the window big enough to have a person come through.
The kid was off school for weeks with severe head pains but x rays said
he was ok. I don't know what he told his parents. All three of these other
kids refused to talk about this except the first time we all met up again,
just talking about what happened. All three have since moved out of town
so I can't discuss it more.</b>
<br><b>My house I believe is not haunted. However I do think a ghost occasionally
visits it. Sometimes there are inexplicable cold spots. I don't know if
any of you know of the TV show Robot Wars (or Battlebots). A year or two
ago me and a friend were really into it and were building robots for fun
out of cardboard, and battling them by ramming into each other etc, using
pens and fake bullets for axes and two fake bullets on a circle bit of
cardboard for a spinning disc (quite powerful). Well one night I propped
up a cardboard panel to be used for repairs to Megalomaniac 2 (one of our
best ones) by the side of my bed. When I woke up it was at the foot of
my bed, under the covers. Neither of my parents had been in my bedroom
that night. Also one of the 'robots' had been slashed by the spinning disc
during the night time more than once.</b>
<br><b>There are some other stories which I haven't time to describe. No-one
knows about these (especially not my parents - I don't think they'd approve
of me breaking into the church) but I guess you lot know now.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Finally Got My Chance</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: steelslingger@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>All my life I have wanted to "see" something supernatural, well,
I got my chance--finally!&nbsp; On May 30,2004 I was in bed alone I started
to hear a "hissing" like noise and thought it was the fan that was on in
the room.&nbsp; I looked at the fan and focused my hearing on it, it sounded
normal.&nbsp; I layed back down and began hearing the "hissing" again,
this time it grew louder and more frantic.&nbsp; I looked up and saw a
dark, shadowy type being with a band of glowing orange around the top of
it's head.&nbsp; The being was about 8 feet tall (my ceilings are 9 feet).&nbsp;
The hissing grew very lound and frantic, almost changing to a growl.&nbsp;
Was this a ghost, a "shadow-person" or a demon?&nbsp; My only explanation
was that I was halucinating.&nbsp; See, I enjoyed a glass of Absinthe before
retiring.&nbsp; But, it was TOO real!</b><b></b>

<p><b>My First Ghost Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dolls_eyes15@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have been seeing ghost since I was at least 9 or 10. But I have
many experiences but I will tell you the first time I saw one and the dream
that I had which I believe was what opened my mind to that side. I will
try and tell this as short as possible.</b>
<br><b>We just moved my new bedroom set down from my grandparents house
and my grandma gave us a old box full of pics of family members from back
when to now..but anyways. I was sleeping one night and I had this very
intense dream..I had a dream that I was walking through what looked like
a mine shaft or some big industrial building, and I remember seeing all
these workers working on the side and I remember seeing at least 5 or 6
of some of the faces and they were all men and I remember on looking up
at me and he smiled and went back to his business and well one of the guys
pulled my arm and told me not go through that door cause it was haunted..
but I ignored him and kept on going and the hallway that I was in was never
ending it seemed like. And in front of me I could see what looked like
a hazy figure. And as I kept on walking it seemed like I could never reach
her. And then the figure started to get more and more clearer and finally
it shaped into a women, and she was floating and e had no feet and she
had a white dress on and she had her hair pulled back and it was wavy and
she had these big brown eyes and her face was shiny and pale..and then
she started coming to me and she grabbed my arm and she was trying to pull
me with her and then she started screaming bloody murder! And I was trying
to get away..then I woke up.. A couple of night later I always had my lights
turned off and well I woke up and I was sleeping with my head away from
my bathroom but I could see that the light was on and so when I turned
around I saw the same women that was in my dream floating in my bathroom
and the light was coming from her and she had this peachy white light around
her and she was smiling at me and I was so scared so I closed my eyes and
she would not leave until I was asleep. And so after that I would close
my bathroom door at night and well one night I was crying and I cried myself
to sleep (I can't remember why) and well in the middle of the night I woke
up and I saw her standing right by my bed and she was rubbing my leg and
telling me that everything is ok! I could feel her hand on my leg rubbing
my leg! and she smiled and stayed there until I went to sleep. That is
the last I saw of her but I always feel like she is always there. Bu that
is not the end of&nbsp; her....</b>
<br><b>After all of this happened I told my mom and she thought I was crazy
and was just making it up cause hey I was 9 at the time...and well she
wanted me to go and get that old box of pics so we could look at and so
I did, well when we were looking through them I saw this pic of the same
women I saw in my dreams!!! I have never seen the pic before and I did
not know she was related to me.. anyways I told my mom and she was like
are you sure and I was like yes! and we kept on going through and I came
across the pic of these 5 or 6 guys and well they were the guys from my
dream in the hallway working on the side and the pic is of them with my
great great grandfather and in the back ground they worked in a found y
and in the back you could see a hallway that was like in my dreams and
my great great grandfather was the guy that looked up and smiled at me....(I
did not know that at the time until I told my mom that he was the one that
smiled at me and she said that he was my great great maybe 3 greats grandfather
and come to find out that the women I saw was his sister!) So I still have
those pics and I love the fact that they watch over me.</b>
<br><b>Sorry this is long but I will send some more stories if you want...
Thanks for reading (you can post this if you want :) )</b>

<br><b>Was it an Accident?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: darksidebe@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Wouter and I live in Belgium.</b>
<br><b>I have stumbled on your page in search of some relaxed reading about
interesting stuff. I must say that your page is very interesting to read
and even though I am very sceptical about ghosts and paranormal things,
doesn't mean I deny that they exsist.</b>
<br><b>I might interest you with a story that has just happened. it's about
ghosts but not about a haunting. I told it to a few friends and they all
thought it was either 'freaky' or 'silly'.</b>
<br><b>ANyway, here it goes,:</b>
<br><b>I am 26 now and in januari my two best friends died in 2 weeks time.
The deaths were completely unrelated, one committed suicide, and one died
of a natural cause (a coronary vain attack). At least, that's what the
family, the police and his friends wanted me to believe. The person's boyfriend,
he was gay, and me, for knowing that he was gay, were kept away from everything
cause the friends and parents hated him. The night of my friend's death
the boyfriend had horrible nightmares of the boy shouting for help and
dying.</b>
<br><b>We all accepted the facts even thought we had a feeling something
was not right. In march, two months later, In a completely unrelated conversation
I received the business card of a policeofficer whom I had to do an interview
with concerning my dissertation (I am a last year student). Unfortunately
I lost the card and couldn't contact the officer anymore.</b>
<br><b>This seems unrelated, but here it comes. begin may I start having
dreams about my deceased friend again, nice dreams, but somehow preparing
me for something. In that week the businesscard falls out of my diary,
even though I've searched it completely after I've lost the card, and never
found it back. I've contacted the officer and asked him to have the interview
he promised me 2 months earlier. He was more than happy to talk with me,
so we made an appointment the day after.</b>
<br><b>I went to talk with the man and it was a good interview, but, like
it always seems to go, we wandered of the subject and started talking about
other things. I still don't know how we got to the subject about my friend,
but he turned out to be the officer who was leading the research concerning
his death. The officer allowed me to read te policefile (which is of course
strictly forbidden, but he saw that I still suffered and missed my friend
so much) and I found out what really happened. His death was not a natural
cause at all, but a mysterious accident of which they didn't find out whether
it was murder of suicide. Me knowing my friend very well, knew that it
was not suicide, as he lived for the day and really worked at his future..
Unfortunately the officer didn't believe me as my word is no proof and
that was the end of the interview.</b>
<br><b>Being back home I could call his boyfriend and informed him about
what really happened to our friend, and for us both it was some kind of
relief to know what really happened.. But we will unfortunately never know
who did that to our dear friend, who was the sweetest, nicest person I
have ever known in my life. Even my girlfriend couldn't comfort me in this
difficult period.</b>
<br><b>Being a pragmatic mind, it's difficult to think about what happened..
but it all seemed to fit too well to be a co&iuml;ncidence. Did my friend
try to let me know what happened so I could inform his boyfriend? this
is a haunting, as you can read.. but just a true story about ghosts and
real friendship I suppose.</b>
<br><b>I mailed this to you cause you people are interested in this. I
wish you all the luck with your investigations and with your homepage/community.</b><b></b>

<p><b>#1 Side Road</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: gafc@globalserve.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I’ve always had a healthy respect and interest in the spirit world.
I’ve been reading the stories on the web site for many years now and never
thought I would have a story to tell. Although throughout my life I’ve
secretly wanted to have ghostly experiences, I also feared the unknown
and wasn’t sure how I would react if I every came face-to-face with a spirit.
I can say that I still don’t know the answer to that question because I
haven’t had a face-to-face experience, as of yet. Anyway, on to my story.
Just this past February (04) I was driving home from work. I was using
the country sideroads as I often did because the traffic in this area is
always heavy and slow. Let me also mention that I grew up driving these
sideroads and used them frequently during the last 7 years going to and
from my work and have never seen anything out of the ordinary until this
evening. It was getting dark as it does in February in Canada between 5:30
–6:00 p.m. but not yet pitch black. I was driving behind two other cars
and only going about 60 km (40 mph for you yanks) when I noticed something
come out of the field on the passenger side just in front of the first
car. I know that they saw it because their brake lights came on. As it
reached the side of the road I initially thought it was an animal but then
it seemed to be very tall, skinny and black (shadow). I saw it reach the
side of pavement and commence to cross the road but did not see it cross
in front or into the first car in line. I have to mention that this happened
so quickly that it was only when reviewing the sequence of events in my
mind I was able to determine exactly what I was seeing. I didn’t think
too much about it except that I did mention it to my daughter when I got
home that I saw something strange on the drive home. It was only a few
days later that I was reading more stories on your web site when I came
across another person’s experience on this very same road - #1 Side Road,
Burlington, Ontario. You see there is an infamous serial killer here in
Canada by the name of Paul Bernardo who dumped the body of one of his victims
in the brush at the side of this road. I think what I saw that night was
her spirit maybe revisiting the scene where she was dumped by that brutal
animal. Kristen rest in peace, we love you.</b>
<br><b>Thank you for letting me tell my story.&nbsp; Your site is wonderful.&nbsp;
Don't stop now!</b><b></b>

<p><b>Ghostly Cats?and Spooky Music</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: nmille@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is about some wierd experinces my family and I had In an old
house we rented from1985-1988.This house was over 100 years old and was
one of the oldest homes in EastLynn.It had not been lived in for three
years before we rented it.Not long after moving in,my husband and I began
to notice these small cat like animals drifting around low to the floors
and usally hanging close to the walls.</b>
<br><b>At first we thought they were rats or opossoms but when we would
try to get close to them they would dissapear.Sometimes they would go behind
the TV or other fufniture and no matter how fast we would run after them
they would be gone when you looked into the're hiding place,even though
we never saw them run out.</b>
<br><b>They never made any noise,even a little mouse will make a small
scurring sound when it runs.I knew for sure it was ghostly the day I was
rocking my two year old son to sleep and one of them drifted right across
the living room.I got a clear look at it this time,it was a dark blackish
brown color and it was shaped a lot like a cat.It just floated right by
us,its feet touched the floor but seemed to skim over it,not making a sound.There
was no gait or body movment,like shoulders swaying or tail swishing.My
son saw it and yelled''A doggie'' as he called all animals doggies.So I
knew it was'nt my husbands and my imaginations,it drifted on into the kitchen
doorway and vanished right before our eyes.</b>
<br><b>We lived there for about four years and we saw these things quite
a bit.For the first two years our only pet was a large elkhound mix then
we added a solded black cat to our family,She did not look like the cat
thihgs we had always seen,She was much bigger and her pretty,shining black
fur was nothing like the dull mottled colors on those things,so there was
no way we could have just saw our pets moving quickly threw the house and
thought they were something else.</b>
<br><b>Another interesting thing about this house is that the lower back
part of it is built into the cliff behind it.Thats the reason we moved,water
started to trickle down the back part of the living room and kitchen wall.It
got so bad that the floord stayed damp all the time.Anyway,I've read theres
something about rock and water causing portels and elemental spirts use
them.So we moved and an old man bought the place,I don't know if he saw
anything or not.He was a recluse and did'nt have anything to do with anybody.The
house burned down in 2000,nothing is left but the outside storage building,by
the way ,we never saw those cat things in there or outdoors.</b>
<br><b>The other spooky place we lived in,in EastLynn WV was on the left
fork of LynnCrk rd,This all happened in 1996-99.Behind this trailer we
rented was a hill and on this hill was the Lewis Cemetery and there was
also another cemetary that was removed when the East Lynn Lake was built
because the goverment bought that part of the mountain.Well,not long after
moving there I started to hear muisic coming from upon the hill.I didn't
think much of it at the time,I figured it was kids partying and hanging
out up there.I did think it odd that the music sounded like gospel and
bluegrass,most kids like rock or rap for partying.My husband said it was
probably coon orfox hunters so I didn't think anymore about it,other than
wishing they;d shutup.[I cant sleep when any kind of music is playing,]</b>
<br><b>Then winter came and even though it wohld be below 0 and snowing
so bad that the roads were even closed a few times we could still hear
that muisc.Then one evening my oldest sons friend and his girl friend came
over with a ouja board she'd gotten for Christmas.They knew I had had previous
expierinces with the ouja and they wanted help working it.So we began to
work the board,we imedatly made contact with a liile girl named Cassie
Ramey .She said she died at age three because she was shot or didn't have
her shots[later she said it was no shots]she gave us her birth and death
dates,they were in the early 1920s but I cant recall the exact dates.The
next spring we were all walking our dogs on thehill behind the house,We
took the road on the left,oposite direction of the Lewis Cemetery.None
of us had been this way before as the road is pretty rough and muddy most
of the time.Not far into this area signs proclaiming it to be part of East
Lynn Lake appeared,then we found where the old cemetery had been.There
were deeep indentations in the ground where the graves had been disintered
and filled back up,pieces of old gravestones were lying around and over
the bank we found Cassie Ramey's complete headstone.The dates matched the
ouja had told us,next we tried to find where she had been moved to.The
ouja kept spelling Vaughn but when we went to the Vaughn cemetery she wasn't
there.Then I remembered that the new gov.cemetery was near a garage owened
by Vaughns,so we went there and after a long while of looking[its a big
cemetery]we found it.Shes on the right half of the cemetery near the drive
about half way up.Quet a few other children are burried near her,it makes
you wonder if there was some sort of epidemic back then.If anybody knows
anything about this little girl or has simular experinces please email

<p><b>Hauntings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: keys11@verizon.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>To preface this experience, I am psychic and have experienced paranormal
events since childhood; below is one that I think would be of interest.</b>
<br><b>North Carolina / Smokey Mountains 1961</b>
<br><b>My Mother and I moved to a home that was built by her Father in
the late 1920s.&nbsp; It was built on the side of a hill where there had
been an Indian massacre in the 1800s.&nbsp; The whole property was considered
holy ground by the Cherokee Indians.</b>
<br><b>My Grandfather died in 1940; my Mother’s step-Mother died in 1948;
there are no other records of any deaths in the house other than these
individuals.</b>
<br><b>August of 1961 I arrived in North Carolina and my room was located
on the second floor in what was my grandmother’s bedroom.&nbsp; During
the night, my bed was pushed and a voice said, “Why are you in my house?”&nbsp;
Knowing only my Mother and I were in the house I said, “Because I belong
here, I am a Keys.”&nbsp; Whatever it was left the room.</b>
<br><b>After getting settled in the local school, a group of us decided
to have quilting bees every Friday night.&nbsp; One Friday night the weather
got bad and the other girls stayed over.&nbsp; My Mother was out of the
house that evening and had called to say that the roads were bad and she
was staying in Asheville.&nbsp; All of us were having after dinner coffee
and all of a sudden footsteps were heard coming down the stairs.&nbsp;
I went to the staircase, turned on the light and no one was there.&nbsp;
I went upstairs and looked through all the rooms and nothing was there.&nbsp;
Went back downstairs and our conversations continued, but this time I left
the living room door open to observe the staircase.&nbsp; Well, we were
all talking and again the footsteps started down the steps and a female
voice said, “Toni, it’s time for bed.”&nbsp; I got up and looked up the
staircase and no one was there, but the hallway and staircase were cold.&nbsp;
I looked at the clock and it was 11:50PM&nbsp; which was on normal nights
past my bedtime.</b>
<br><b>This was, needless to say, unsettling since rumors about the house
were all about hauntings.</b>
<br><b>Well, brave hearts that we were, we decided to have a s&eacute;ance.&nbsp;
We used a break board and it commenced tapping yes and no answers, but
when we asked if the house was haunted, the bread board lifted up and came
down hard, 2 paintings fell off the wall and the hallway light went out.</b>
<br><b>All of us left the house and slept in our cars.&nbsp; My Mom came
in the next morning to find us in cars and inquired as to why; we told
her.&nbsp; She smiled and said that nothing can hurt you and we should
have gone to bed.</b>
<br><b>I eventually got married much to the disappointment of my Dad (parents
are divorced).&nbsp; After I had been married for 6 months, my husband
and I were living in the house with my dog.&nbsp; The house was big and
required constant cleaning which included the wrap porch.</b>
<br><b>The day was August 24, 1963 and it was a hot day.&nbsp; The house
was built that if all windows were open, the house had a constant cooling
in the summer and was warm in the winter.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was mopping the
porch and my dog came running outside screaming and the smell of fear was
beyond comprehension.&nbsp; I immediately thought, mouse.&nbsp; I picked
up the broom and went up the stairs.</b>
<br><b>At the top of the stairs, the hallway went around the staircase
and every room opened off the hallway.&nbsp; At the rear of the staircase
were windows and my desk.&nbsp; The windows were closed.</b>
<br><b>I reached the top of the stairs and it was ice cold and I immediately
thought, “okay, here we go – it’s too hot for it to be this cold”.&nbsp;
I turned around and saw a shadow of a man literally moving papers around
on my desk.&nbsp; The shadow set one paper aside.&nbsp; I said, “Hello,
what can I help you with?”&nbsp; The shadow turned and looked at me, pointed
to the paper and disappeared.&nbsp; The hallway became hot and I felt that
that paper was very important so, I went to the desk and it was a letter
from my Father telling me he didn’t approve of my marriage and said he
didn’t think it would last a year (it didn’t).&nbsp; That night, my husband
was awakened by something shaking his side of the bed and a man’s voice
said, “Get out of this house, you are not wanted here.”&nbsp; This went
on for several weeks and my husband moved to his Mother’s house.</b><b></b>

<br><b>A Story from Delaware</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ICPjuggalette2DopeJ@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hey. My names Jenna. I'm 15 years old and I live in Delaware. I have
had a couple of experiences with ghosts. I'm only going to share a few
with you because I'm sure you have many other stories.</b>
<br><b>-As some of you will notice from my E-mail address, I'm a huge fan
of the band Insane Clown Posse. My room is covered in posters, I have all
their CDs and I have 5 different T-shirts with their logos on them. I only
just moved to Delaware recently and I just got my room set up. Well anyways,
I was sitting in my room listening to ICP and playing X-men on my playstation
one night and I had my window open half way and I had some of my ICP cd
cases set up on the seal sort of like a display. Somehow the window closed
by itself and basically ruined my cases. So, I moved them onto the second
shelf in my closet. I went to get them a couple days later to see what
number a certain song was and they weren't there. I asked my dad and my
step brother if they had them...which i highly doubted because both of
them hate ICP. They told me they didn't so I went back to my room to look
around. Then about 4 days later on a Saterday night my step brother, Chris
took me to the movies and out to dinner. We got home around 10:30pm. I
went up to my room to find 3 of my ICP shirts in the trash can and my favorite
poster ripped off the wall. I was kind of freaked out by this point, but
I cleaned it up and layed down. I had my headphones on listening to ICP
of course and I looked over to see my closet door swaying just a little
bit. I didn't have my windows open nor did I have the fan on. I turned
my light on and went over to see if maybe my dog was in there and when
I opened the door...there layed my CD cases. I'm not sure if this is my
imagination or if I have a host who doesn't share the same interest in
music as me.</b>
<br><b>-Okay this it the last one, I promise. Anyway...I've never really
been a girly girl. I've never played with barbies and I've always had a
fear of dolls. I used to think they were possessed and on a mission to
get my soul. My family and friends knew this and never joked about it.
Well like I said I just recently moved to Delaware and the only people
living in this house is My dad, His new wife, My step brother and myself.
My step mom doesn't have any dolls and she knows that I hate them. Well
I went in the basement one day to wash my laundry and there was a glass
doll with blonde hair and bright blue eyes sitting on the dryer. I screamed
and ran up the steps to yell at whoever did that to me. They all promised
me that they didn't put it there, and when my dad went to get it and throw
it away it wasn't there. He came up the steps and asked me if I was positive
I saw one because there was nothing on the dryer. So I thought maybe I
was seeing things. A couple days later I was getting a towel out of the
hall closet and there she was again. So I said out loud if there was someone
else living in the house with us..if they could please knock it off with
the doll thing. I never seen it again, but every now and then my step mom
finds little toys in the strangest places. So we know that this ghost is
a little girl...and besides the whole doll thing I'm kind of happy to have
another younger girl in the house with me. If you have any comments or
advice for my first story you can email me at -ICPjuggalette2DopeJ@yahoo.com</b><b></b>

<p><b>Florida Haunts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: FloridaSquirt@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>We moved here when I was 7, going on 8yrs old. We ALL would see shadows
of people walking down the hall, a man in a suit in particular.&nbsp; I
always felt like something was chasing me down the hall...at one end was
the air conditioner closet, at the other end was the bathroom with a huge
mirrored cabinet.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Things got weird. It would get cold. It all started when I was 8
and continued until age 18 when I finally moved out.&nbsp; I'd turn on
every light. I'd see things quickly go under or out from under my bed...couldn't
make them out. I'd see something in the mirrow reflection when going to
the hall bathroom...chasing me...I actually screamed and slammed the</b>
<br><b>door (I was 16 and a girlfriend was with me babysitting my younger
brother...she came running). ALL of my friends..even from church... felt
very uneasy in the house.</b><b></b>
<p><b>One time we went on vacation to MO, and the lady next door came over
to feed our animals. She stayed the night one night ( can't remember why...)
and she awoke to see a spirit looking over her. She said it got VERY cold
when she went into the house to feed our dogs....&nbsp;&nbsp; she ewas
so scared, she filled two huge bowls with dog food and refused to ever
go into our house again, even if we were home!!</b><b></b>
<p><b>I had a dream one night in which I was awakened by voices coming
from the A/C closet... a female saying, "Should we do it now?" and a male
answering, "No, not yet." I awoke with my hand numb.</b><b></b>
<p><b>AFTER my dad passed away, things got worse... except the only place
that felt "SAFE" was the masterbedroom where he used to sleep.&nbsp; It
was the only room in the house that felt safe. I used to have weird nightmares
about demons and supernatural stuff, too...and would frequently awake sitting
straight up or screaming....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people who bought the
house after us still live in it... I've never ventured back to ask if they've
had any problems like that.&nbsp;&nbsp; We did learn that a man hung himself
in one of the rooms.</b><b></b>

<p><b>When I was about four years old, I shared a room with my baby brother.</b>
<br><b>He had one of those punching bag clowns with the sand-weighted bottoms</b>
<br><b>(they call them "boppers" today). I used to feel like something
was following me in the halls (this happened to me again when we moved
to another state).</b><b></b>
<p><b>I went to bed (I had those child safety rails on my bed) and the
clown punching bag was about 6 ft or more from my bed--nearer to my brother's
crib.&nbsp; I was trying to go to sleep, but was scared, and saw the bag
start to sway. I covered my head. I then heard scraping noise (we were
in an tile-floor apartment) and I looked from under the sheet and saw the
bag CLOSER to my bed! It happened again and was only about 2 feet from
my bed. I turned to face the wall and covered my head with the sheet, scared
to death.&nbsp;&nbsp; I then FELT something rub my left side. I tried to
scream but couldn't. I started praying for God to protect me and it finally
went away.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have not allowed those things in my house since. I am grown and
have kids of my own, and they have never had a clown punching bag. To this
day I do not like clowns and don't have any type of knick knacks or anything
with clowns on them.</b>

<br><b>Michigan Haunts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: FloridaSquirt@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was a child I lived on a base in MI. My older brother and
I would always hear voices calling our names. I'd go to wherever my mom
was and say, "What?, Did you call me?" and she'd say, "No." I used to see
shadows of people walking by or sitting next to me and when I looked, they
weren't there. My father told my mother after a couple years that HE saw
them too, but he didn't "go for that" kind of stuff, so he had kept quiet
about it.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I saw a black cat jump from couch to chair (we had no cats, I was
allergic to them).&nbsp; I awoke one night to see my dolls playing catch
with each other!!&nbsp; I always felt like something was chasing me down
the hallway.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Shortly before we moved (or after my dad confessed he was seeing
things, too) my father did some investigation and was told that our housing
(base housing) was built on top of an old Indian burial ground.&nbsp; None
of the spirits there ever harmed any of us, just made us feel uneasy and
like we were "losing our minds" seeing things and hearing things.</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Family’s Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: michelle5454@sbcglobal.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I don't even know where to begin.&nbsp; I guess I will start out
by saying that in 1979 my family moved into a house....2xxxx Lehigh in
Michigan.&nbsp; My mother said that the first strange thing she remembered
was having some friends over late one evening and there was a loud steady
knocking noise that lasted about 5 seconds that came from the upstairs
(which was my parents bedroom).&nbsp; She said that she looked at my dad
(who heard it also) and hoped no one would ask what it was because she
had no idea.&nbsp; That was the first strange thing.&nbsp; Over the years
many other unexplainable things happened.&nbsp; My mom would feel someone
lay there hand down firmly on her shoulder when she was doing the dishes
( this would happen on a regular basis) , she would feel something touching
her leg at night while laying in bed.&nbsp; She would often see something
out of the corner of her eye while in the living room, like someone was
standing in the hallway.&nbsp; She said this is the only place that she
would think she saw something, it was always in the hallway.&nbsp; We always
had electrical problems in our house.&nbsp; I know this sounds sick but
there was an area in the hallway where a group of houseflies congregated
and would fly in a tornado like pattern.&nbsp; We could not get rid of
them.&nbsp; The furnace broke down nothing ever worked right.&nbsp; My
mom was in the kitchen with a friend one day and a glass coffee cup sitting
on the counter burst and shattered by itself.&nbsp; It was not touching
anything and it was not near anything that was hot or anything like that.&nbsp;
I remember as a kid being in the basement with my mom doing the laundry,
my mom went upstairs and I stayed down there by myself, I was on my way
back upstairs when I saw a shadow of what looked like a old woman in a
rocking chair rocking back and forth.&nbsp; I was crying so bad for my
mom to come and get me I was so scared.&nbsp; I remember looking away from
it and then looking again hoping that it would be gone but it&nbsp; asn't.&nbsp;
It just kept rocking back and forth.&nbsp; I will never forget that image.&nbsp;
Late at night if we were up (there was always someone up late in my house)
you could hear what sounded like when you shovel snow and the shovel scrapes
the concrete.&nbsp; You could hear this while in the living room.&nbsp;
I remember numerous times just thinking what the hell is that!&nbsp; Everyone
was always trying to figure it out.&nbsp; Also another thing, my mom had
called a repairman to the house because of a high pitched noise coming
from the fridge.&nbsp; He couldn't find anything wrong.&nbsp; He had it
unplugged and said nothing was wrong.&nbsp; While he was there and had
it unplugged the noise started up and he said the noise appeared to be
coming from the wall and not the refridgerator.&nbsp; Everybody heard it.&nbsp;
We heard it all the time.&nbsp; There was never an explaination for it
or for the "shoveling noise".&nbsp; I remember when I was about 2 or 3
years old waking in the middle of the night and walking to my parents room
for my mom and seeing my mom elevated off her bed (about 3 feet) and she
had a glowing blue-ish light on her.&nbsp; I always assumed this was a
dream until I got older.&nbsp; I remember it vividly and why would a 3
year old dream about something like that.&nbsp; I now believe I really
saw this.&nbsp; She was not awake during the elevation, she was sleeping.&nbsp;
My family moved out around 1990.&nbsp; We have friends that still live
on that street and see the house when ever we are over there.&nbsp; Since
moving out numerous people have lived there and quickly move out.&nbsp;
Nobody has stayed there for more than 6 months or so.&nbsp; No one who
has lived there had been told of our families experience.&nbsp; One woman
told a neighbor that she went upstairs one day and it looked as if someone
had vacuumed a circle around the entire room.&nbsp; She moved out shortly
after.&nbsp; The house has remained empty for the past 3 years. The owner
who rents it out can't get anyone to sta there very long.&nbsp; The first
people to live there after we moved out got a divorce and filed for bankruptcy
after a year of living there.&nbsp; My family had troubles too, my parents
divorced, had financial troubles, and my mom got sick and eventually died.&nbsp;
Not sure if I there is a connection but I have heard that ghosts try to
destroy families.&nbsp; One other thing I remember was we had a cat who
one day we found in the basement in a violent rage.&nbsp; She was an otherwise
healthy cat who one day curled up in a ball and hissed and spit at anyone
who came near her.&nbsp; My mom described her as seeming like she was possesed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
She had to be put to sleep.&nbsp; I will never forget that house and the
horrible memories I have of living there.</b>

<br><b>Man in Black</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: gamefreak101@sbcglobal.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>OK i hope you will still read this but this thing that happened to
me does not make a good story..</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Ok. My grandparents owned a video store about 4 years ago. My friend
and I were Watching a movie and we left the room for a drink when we were
stoped by what at first looked like a shadow but i started to freak out
when i looked a little harder. It could not of been a shadow it was in
the shape of a man but a he had a hat and nice suite witch were both in
black. Whin I turned to run I saw my friend jaw dropped. I asked him what
he saw and he said "a man in black!" I said me too and we ran as fast as
possable. We ran out of the store and to the animal vet... We sat at the
the side walk talking about what we saw when on a nice day the lights in
the vet went out.. I believe that it was this man in black that we saw.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Thank you for reading this! I have wanted to get this out of my
mind for 3 years now! See my mam believes in ghosts but my dad and everyone
on his side of the family does not so they thought i was making up stories
so I would sound cool but I AM NOT making up stories! This is true!</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Grandpa’s Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: russndede@inil.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was about 4 or 5 years old, I saw my grandpa's ghost. I was
laying on my couch and my mom was outside talking to my dad because the
portal to my attic was open&nbsp; but no one had been&nbsp; in the attic
at all that day. All of a sudden I saw a pair of feet come down from the
attic. The figure was in the shape of an elderly man with glasses, dress
shoes, and a pair of dress pants on too. I wasn't scared because I could
tell that the ghost wasn't going to hurt me. The figure came over gave
me a kiss on the forehead and then went right through the front door. When
my mom came in, I told her about the incident and when I described the
figure, she went and got a picture of my great grandpa. When I saw the
picture I got all excited and said "mommy mommy that's him, that's who
I saw." I'm 11 now and I find it very comforting because my grandpa had
died when I was just a little baby and it's nice to know that he's watching
over me.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Ghost story in Bruning, NE</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: denisetheweirdo@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>In the 12 years of my life I have never experienced anything this
scary.&nbsp; I was visiting my cousins in Bruning, Nebraska and they're
town is very small. Around noon, I was in thier basement and I passed nearby
the farend and I felt a sudden cold wind come over me. It felt so strange
espically because the heater was on. I told my cousin but he did not believe
me. I just thought it was a chill, but then later at 5, my older cousin
came home and she noticed that her notebook was gone from her room, and
it was found in the computer room (which is on the other side of the basement),
I remembered, when it was noon, I had seen her notebook on her bed. Now
her bed was messed up. It really started to scare me. Espicially because
no one was downstairs. Then at night, my cousin and I were playing and
then we felt a cold rush. We turned towards the end of the basement and
we saw a pale boy that we could see through. We screamed and ran out. Then
we were forced to sleep in the basement and we were sleeping peacefully.
Until we heard around 2 am, we heard the keyboard from the CPU. Nobody
but us were there in the basement. We got so scared we ran upstairs screaming
and jumped in bed with our other cousin.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Brookside, Indiana</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Morriganlefey333@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi here is my 1st ever (there have been many) ghost experience. From
the time I was born until I was 10 we (my grandparents and I) lived in
a house on Parker Ave. on the East side of Indianapolis in a neighborhood
called Brookside.&nbsp; It was a 4 bedroom house and mine was 3rd from
the back. Well EVERY night from the time i was 4 until we moved i would
be awakened at like 11:45ish with this feeling that i had to get out of
my room and into my grandparents room. well when i was 6 i got the nerve
to look behind me and there at the end of the hall was a hovering lady
in all white with crazy hair and red eyes. she would slowly come down the
hall towards me until i was almost to my grandparents room when she would
speed up and on some occasions scratch me across my back (yes it left marks)
well until recently i disregarded these as half ghost story half childhood
imagination...until i met someone who was telling me about a house on the
OTHER side of Indy where he had the EXACT SAME EXPERIENCE. when i told
him that i had the same experience he hugged me and thanked me for proving
that it wasn't childhood imagination.</b>
