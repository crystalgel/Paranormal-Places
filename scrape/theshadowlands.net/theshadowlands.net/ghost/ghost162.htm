<p><b>Boarded Asylum</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: gondree@mciworld.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am just writing because I have some information that I thought
you guys might find interesting.&nbsp; i have written in some of my own
stories to you guys, and absolutely love your website! It is so amazing
and is put together wonderfully.&nbsp; I am currently writing from another
address, but you can reply to this one or to k_mattson@hotmail.comI recently
made a trip to Buffalo, NY with my fiance.&nbsp; His family is from there,
and he took me to meet them for the very first time.&nbsp; Anyway, prior
to the trip, my fiance, Eric, kept telling me how he wanted me to go see
this abandoned asylum that was in the city.&nbsp; He said it was really
creepy, and freaky, and he said that he and his brother had snuck out there
on numerous nights to see it. I was not aware what I was in for. The building
was something I had never imagined. It was like a huge, gothic castle!
Well, the first night we were there,&nbsp; he took me out to the asylum.
All I can say is, WOW!!!&nbsp; I have some pictures that I could send you,
but they in no way could show the architecture and structure of this massive
building. It was the length of about 7 blocks, and was just huge. The architecture
was definitely gothic, shown especially by the two twin towers in the front.&nbsp;
Most of the windows were barred, I guessed it was for the patients who
they didn't want committing suicide.&nbsp; It was built by the free masons
in 1872, and was one of the state psychiatric hospitals, definitely a place
where deaths occured.&nbsp; I got the weirdest creepiest feeling out there.
We went out there almost every night to take pictures, and well, just snoop.</b>
<br><b>Most of it was fenced so people couldn't get in, but we found ways
to get closer to the building, but all the doors or entryways were sealed.&nbsp;
Most of the windows were boarded up, but there were some you could see
right through. Anyway, alongside the asylum, were buildings such as a house
where the director probably lived, and a music hall, and another building
just known as the "angel house." All abandoned.&nbsp; My fiance and I were
looking at the director's house, taking pictures and stuff, when all of
a sudden I heard a woman's singing voice echoing from the building. I screamed
and made a run for the car. (I know, I am a baby) :-) Anyway, it was then
that my fiance informed me that we were standing right next to the music
hall. He didn't hear anything, though.Also, there was one night when we
were walking around the creepy castle, (that's what it really looked like)
and I noticed a tiny window with a light on. Eric seemed very interested.
He hadn't noticed that earlier when he had been there with his brother
in the past. We were very curious.&nbsp; Anyway, after that, we were determined
to find out&nbsp; what that light was. We</b>
<br><b>tried to get in (I know this is trespassing) but were only brave
enough to make it partway through the unmowed grass (which was as tall
as us) before getting spooked out of our minds. We just got the eeriest
feeling..like someone or somebodys were watching us.&nbsp; We were also
startled by a black cat who was creeping around the building. (Perfect
additon, huh?) :-)&nbsp; Anyway, we found a maintence man who worked in
the adjoining asylum.&nbsp; The new hospital is connected to the old one,
but is blocked off from it. So no one can go in the old one anymore. I
believe the historical society owns it now, but not sure.&nbsp; The maintence
man was very helpful. We told him about the light we saw, and asked if
anyone goes in there to check on things.&nbsp; He said there hasn't been
any working electricity in that building for years.&nbsp; There shouldn't
be any, he said, and recommended that we report it to security. Unfortunately,
we didn't, just because we thought it was cool! :-) We drove by there every
night afterwards, and the light still remained on. Except for the last
night we were there. It was off. Weird huh?</b>
<br><b>Anyway, I just thought you would find it interesting. And I know
you have a list of famous places that are haunted...this is one I would
definitely say was, even though nothing really really scary happened. And
unfortunately, some of our pics didn't turn out.&nbsp; We were hoping to
get some orbs or something. But nope.&nbsp; But we definitely felt a presence.
It was there. I have had experiences with something in my old house I used
to live in, nothing too scary, but enough to know when something is there.
If you ever get a chance to go to Buffalo, NY I would recommend this place!
It is a forgotten building.&nbsp; No one really notices it anymore. Eric
has lived there his whole life before moving out to Minnesota, and just
noticed it a couple years ago.&nbsp; It's like it's a taboo place to look
at or talk about. But that's just what makes it so much more interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I wish we could find out more about it, but we didn't get a chance to go
to the historical society.&nbsp; And I wonder if that light ever came back
on?? :-)</b>

<p><b>Ozark Glowing Ball</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: CelloAce@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mom and her best friend Tom like to go fly
fishing when my sister and</b>
<br><b>I are with our dad on the weekends.&nbsp; Tom had read about a creek
deep in the</b>
<br><b>heart of the Ozarks that is supposed to be great for trout fishing,
so they</b>
<br><b>decided they should make that there destination the next weekend
instead of</b>
<br><b>there usual spot at they Current.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well as fate would have it, my mom got them lost
on the way back.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>pulled off on to a dirt road to look at the map.&nbsp; Tom was asleep
at the time.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;As she was trying to find the name of the closest town on
the map, she</b>
<br><b>notice a glowing ball heading toward her.&nbsp; Thinking it was
a farmer that</b>
<br><b>heard about a tresspasser on his property, she stepped out of the
car to</b>
<br><b>explain the situation and possible get some help from him.&nbsp;
That's when the</b>
<br><b>ball came to a stop and after her eyes adjusted to the light she
noticed that</b>
<br><b>the light wasn't coming from any vehicle at all.&nbsp; It was just
glowing ball</b>
<br><b>hovering about three feet above the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp; She instantly
got back in the</b>
<br><b>car and shook Tom awake just in time to see the ball dart up over
the car.</b>
<br><b>Tom said he didn't see anything and when she got out to look, my
mom couldn't</b>
<br><b>find any trace of the ball.&nbsp; She sat in the car for a while
and retold the</b>
<br><b>events take just took place to Tom.&nbsp; Tom said that she was
probably just</b>
<br><b>tired and to let him take over the driving.&nbsp; She thought that
could be it and</b>
<br><b>put it out of her mind.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of months later, I was visiting my grandparents
and couldn't</b>
<br><b>help but notice an article in the Missouri Conservation they keep
around</b>
<br><b>about the Ozark Glowing Ball.&nbsp; I didn't know anything about
my mom's</b>
<br><b>encounter at the time, but when i showed her the article she went
pale.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>stories told by the people in the magazine&nbsp; were almost identical
to hers.</b>
<br><b>We're all convinced that she saw the infamous Ozark Glowing Ball.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Ring</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: biged@wvi.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello, my name is Angela S. . I have had many,many encounters with
the paranormal. I live in Oregon and have most of my life. My family is
from Oklahoma. In my family there are many psychics including myself.&nbsp;
I have had visions, seen ghosts, seen strange happenings in the sky. Nothing
seems to get passed me. Here's a true story but</b>
<br><b>the names have been changed...I went to a friend's house all excited
about a class ring I got...I was showing it off to everybody. When&nbsp;
I got to my friend Dave's house he liked my ring and wheeled himself to
the bedroom to get his.&nbsp; Dave's a bit older than me and he'd had his
ring for many years.</b>
<br><b>As soon as I touched the ring my mind blanked and I pictured a dark
place. this place seemed very cold as well. When I opened my eyes I looked
at Dave and said,"You lost this ring for a very long time didn't you?"</b>
<br><b>Dave said yes. He told me that the ring had been lost. Come to find
out the ring had been at the bottom of a river for a couple of years. A
friend that happened to find it and returned the ring to his mother. The
reason this story is strange to me because that is the only time I have
touched an object and had that kind of reaction.&nbsp; I found the experience
strange. It has never happened to me again and it can be frightening.I
hope others enjoy my story.....I have many more.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Deon the Love Ghost.</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: AndrewChild@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>We Meet Deon in the sixties . A lad in his seveteenth year of his
short life. At</b>
<br><b>this time we took in kids who were in trouble with the law. Not&nbsp;
bad trouble but</b>
<br><b>enough to be watched by the law. We were a christian family who
wanted</b>
<br><b>to help. We would take in teenagers and try to show them the right
way</b>
<br><b>to live. This was the sixties,a&nbsp; time of flower children and
w wild time</b>
<br><b>in our country. A time when anything was&nbsp; dome without thought
.</b>
<br><b>Some boys that we knew well brought Deon to meet us. We talked that</b>
<br><b>evening and&nbsp; were told that he had cancer. We suspected ,because
we that</b>
<br><b>his hair was very thin. Another thing was told to us in private.
He had</b>
<br><b>never known the love of a famly and didnt know how to take us.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We were</b>
<br><b>a happy groop. Something he was not experienced before. The true
love of</b>
<br><b>a christian&nbsp; family. After a few visits we ask him to stay
with us. We</b>
<br><b>knew that ,atleast there would be shelter and food in his stomach.
After</b>
<br><b>this we became a very close family.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He</b>
<br><b>stayed with us a little over a year. We were&nbsp;&nbsp; planning
a driving</b>
<br><b>vacation . He had his drivers&nbsp; license and we would share&nbsp;
the driving.</b>
<br><b>We sat down together and planned our vacation together . About a
week</b>
<br><b>prior to the trip his head&nbsp; began to hurt him so badly he would
scream</b>
<br><b>in pain. We knew his fathers telephone&nbsp; number. He had divorced
Deons</b>
<br><b>mother long before we met Deon. He begged us knot to call&nbsp;
his dad but</b>
<br><b>we thought he was just in to much&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pain. His father
came and took him</b>
<br><b>to the hospital. This was his final time. He died about a week later.</b>
<br><b>We felt his presence from then on&nbsp;&nbsp; Mom knew he was around
because h</b>
<br><b>would come behind her and tap her on her shoulder .We would hear
him at</b>
<br><b>night ,shuffling and dealing pichnocle&nbsp; cards he wore a heavey
class</b>
<br><b>ring that would klack on the table when he dealed the cards&nbsp;
He has been</b>
<br><b>seen twice by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some of our friends.&nbsp;
We wouldnt be frightened&nbsp; for we</b>

<p><b>Children of The House.....</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ghettofabulouz@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>back in January of this year, my sister and I began to rent out a
house on</b>
<br><b>Cape Cod, Ma. I have had many spiritual encounters throughout my
life, so it</b>
<br><b>is a pretty normal thing to me, and I can usually tell when "some
one else"</b>
<br><b>is inhabiting the house. Many of the houses on Cape Cod are over
200 years</b>
<br><b>old, or more, and are usually more like duplex apartmant buildings,</b>
<br><b>basically two houses, joined. Almost as soon as we moved in, I could
feel</b>
<br><b>their presence. But I knew they werent in our part of the house.
Probably</b>
<br><b>next door or in the basement. The first few nites I heard faint
laughing</b>
<br><b>sounds, I didnt really think anything of it. After&nbsp; a few days,
my sister</b>
<br><b>asked me if I had heard children laughing. She had heard them as
well. My</b>
<br><b>sister is a little more petrified of this kind of thing, so I didnt
tell her</b>
<br><b>from the start that I beleived the house to be haunted. That was
when I</b>
<br><b>mentioned it to her, and she felt the same. The laughing ceased
after</b>
<br><b>awhile, and I think they became more comfortable with us. We didnt
hear from</b>
<br><b>them as much, except when we fought. Based on their behavior, i
believe they</b>
<br><b>were young, and there were two of them. When there was commotion
in the</b>
<br><b>house is when they were most active, the dining room chairs would
slide</b>
<br><b>accross the floor, and the dishes would rattle in the sink and the
basement</b>
<br><b>door knob would turn. Very frequently, i'd hear them coming up the
basement</b>
<br><b>stairs and playing down there. Before long, they spent most of their
time</b>
<br><b>down there or in our half of the house. Id never paid much attention
to my</b>
<br><b>basement, but once noticed painted kids handprints on the floors,
and</b>
<br><b>drawings, etc. I recently moved out of state, but my sister still
lives in</b>
<br><b>that house. I told her they would probably be more active, knowing
that she</b>
<br><b>is alone, and they'd want to give her company. The same week I moved,
my</b>
<br><b>sister was bringing laundry up from the basement, and she tried
shutting the</b>
<br><b>door. But she couldnt. it was like someone was pushing it open at
her. This</b>
<br><b>went on for several moments, and finally she had to "scold" them,
saying the</b>
<br><b>door had to be shut, and reminding them that they dont have to open
a door</b>
<br><b>to get through it. The house I live in now is not haunted, and it
almost</b>
<br><b>feels empty. I kinda miss them, and many times, I felt like they
protected</b>
<br><b>us, and know they still protect my sister.</b><b></b>

<br><b>New London NH</b>
<br><b>Colby-Sawyer College.</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:Shannan@thespark.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>There is a lot of activity in this small town.&nbsp; The most apparent
hauntings are with the original Colby Academy.</b>
<br><b>Colby academy was established back in the 1800's and was an all
girls private Liberal Arts college.&nbsp; The Academy can be found just
down the street from the ever growing Colby Sawyer College, on the right,
next to the town Gazebo.</b>
<br><b>Colby Academy is rumored to be haunted by the original founder of
the College.&nbsp; Many esteemed Professor's from Dartmouth, and Harvard
have in the past been invited to stay at the Academy, which is now used
to house CSC Professors in bad weather or for conferences.&nbsp; After
spending one night, they refuse to return.</b>
<br><b>There are many legends about CSC.&nbsp; The most well known amoung
the students, including myself while I attended CSC was that of a young
woman named Sarah.&nbsp; In the early 1900's, Sarah was a freshman.&nbsp;
Back then, the Colgate Building, now used only for offices and classrooms,
was also used as a dormitory.&nbsp; (third floor)</b>
<br><b>The third floor contains two windows, facing each other at a 90
degree angle that are bricked off from the rest of the building, both outside
and inside.</b>
<br><b>Sarah, went out for a night with a few boys from Darmouth College,
located about 30 miles North in Lebanon NH.&nbsp; She did not return.&nbsp;
Instead, her body was found floating in Page Pond which can be found behind
the Hogan center parking lot.&nbsp; She was brutally raped and murdered.</b>
<br><b>It is rumored that Sarah's ghost could be seen through out the campus,
wondering lost, between the pond and Colgate building.&nbsp; It is also
myth that in the time of her death, her best friend committed suicide,
after having gone crazy from sightings of Sarah, and did so by throwing
herself out the 3rd floor window.&nbsp; Thus, reasoning for an already
uptight town, to barracade the two rooms, and the entire third floor of
Colgate Hall.</b>
<br><b>I atteneded CSC in 94-96, and even then, access to the third floor
was forbidden, and the windows to this day are bricked off as well as entrance
to the bell tower.</b>
<br><b>But that isn't even the beginning of the phenomina on this richly
historic campus.&nbsp; There is so much paranormal activity, that in 95,
Ken and Dianne Warren came to our campus.&nbsp; The Warren's are world
famous demonologists.</b>
<br><b>Chronicle, did a special about the lore of Colby-Sawyer College,
and the College itself published an article in the 1995 alumni book about
suspicions of a ghost in Colby Academy, with fantastic pictures of an 18th
century man in the window watching.</b>
<br><b>Gilbert Ross.&nbsp; Burned at the stake for witchery in the 1700's.&nbsp;
Now on that land stands Mckeon Hall.&nbsp; My freshman year at Colby, it
was all girls, and where I resided at the time.&nbsp; The dormitory housed
about 30 girls.</b>
<br><b>I think Gilbert was a playful spirit, although there were times
when I felt very uneasy in the dormitory. Whether it was his presence or
someone with him, there were two very difinitive entities living with us.</b>
<br><b>During the latest hours of the night, my friends and I were often
awakened by the sounds of slamming doors in the bathrooms, only to find
no one there, footsteps on the stairs, and things blaintently out of place.</b>
<br><b>I remember specifically the day my roommate left CSC.&nbsp; Her
glass mug, the kind you win in a contest or something, flew off the top
of her desk and across the room, a good distance of about 15 feet, hit
the wall, and landed on the floor, without breaking, and without either
of us touching it.&nbsp; She moved out that weekend and returned to Massachusetts.</b>
<br><b>One thing that we all came to grow very used to was the elevators
in Mckeon Hall.</b>
<br><b>They were 100+ years old, pull system elevators, that were only
used at 6am by the cleaning lady, to bring up her supplies.&nbsp; They
were not nearly strong enough to carry a person, and were kept locked up
very tight while not in use.&nbsp; We used to hear that thing running all
night long, dinging and stopping, then going again, then dinging....</b>
<br><b>Enough to make you crazy.</b>
<br><b>Every single building on the campus of Colby Sawyer College has
a story to tell, everyone of them viable enough to have brought demonologists
to check them out.</b>
<br><b>It's a wonderful place, something about the college draws you back
time and time again, maybe it's just the beauty of the area, or is it the
history and enigma....who knows, but it is sooooo worth the trip.</b>

<p><b>I Think I am Being Visited</b><b></b>

<br><b>someone needs to know the time and the broken clock begins to wind
up and the</b>
<br><b>iron coil inside starts to chime at the top of the hour without
any living</b>
<br><b>person helping it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other strange thing is a cold spot in the
basement of my house behind</b>
<br><b>the pool table and the store room.&nbsp; At times I have walked
into the store</b>
<br><b>room to find things for my mother and father.</b>
<br><b>I would always feel a cold shiver on my back but never saw anything.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>bedroom was right above this cold spot and sometimes I would feel
the sprit</b>
<br><b>visit me and watch me sleep at night...(well I pretended to sleep)
or turn on</b>
<br><b>my TV and catch up on the local news and some Letterman.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On different occasions I would be working on
my homework quietly at the</b>
<br><b>table with my sister. As we studied we would here pool table sticks
fall to</b>
<br><b>the floor. We had cement floors in the basement and we thought we
should pick</b>
<br><b>them up or to see if they were broken. When we got down the stairs
we noticed</b>
<br><b>that the pool sticks are up right in their stand and nothing was
out of</b>
<br><b>place.&nbsp; We would also hear the billiard balls hit eachother
on the table and</b>
<br><b>we would see the same thing...the balls were put away inside the
crate. My</b>
<br><b>sister and I know the sounds of these objects very well, so we know
that</b>
<br><b>nothing else would make the same sounds. When my parents would get
home we</b>
<br><b>would tell them what had happened. They shrugged it off and told
us it was</b>
<br><b>nothing.&nbsp; RIGHT!!&nbsp; After a while we got used to the sounds
and like it became</b>
<br><b>apart of our daily routine.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were away on vacation my best friend from
across the ally watched our</b>
<br><b>house for us and take care of the cat.&nbsp; She did and got a big
suppress while</b>
<br><b>she was watching TV in the living room.&nbsp; She heard someone
coming up the</b>
<br><b>stairs and looked to see if my cat found a new way in the house...but
no one</b>
<br><b>was there...the cat was outside on the mat waiting to be let in.&nbsp;
She let the</b>
<br><b>cat in and left in a big hurry. She later told me what had happened.
I told</b>
<br><b>her yeah our sprit likes to make sure no one is going to hurt our
home. She</b>
<br><b>wished I had told her about the sprit before...but I didn't want
her family</b>
<br><b>to think my family was nuts.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next year my parents and my sister, my friend
and myself were out</b>
<br><b>camping together at our favorite site. As we sat by the fire we
told our</b>
<br><b>stories and some of us finally confessed to some strange noises
and cold</b>
<br><b>spots as well.&nbsp; The funny thing about all this is, my house
is on Elm Street</b>
<br><b>I am sorry this is so long.&nbsp; Thank you for listening and if
you have anything</b>
<br><b>like this in your house......</b><b></b>

<p><b>This is a story that has been shared through my family for quite
a while.</b>
<br><b>My great grandmother lived in the mountains of Lexington,Kentucky
up untill her death a couple years ago,but this encounter happened sometime
in the 40s.....</b>
<br><b>Her house as well as all of her neighbors houses all had railroad
tracks less than 100 feet away from there front yards.</b>
<br><b>She had a neighbor named Edna that was a little on the mentally
challenged side,but she had a child none the less.</b>
<br><b>One day Edna's child (2yrs oldat the time) ran out onto the rail
road tracks and was killed when a train came through and ran over him.</b>
<br><b>A few weeks later ,my great grandmother was out side doing her laundry
when her oldest child came out to tell her that her baby (my great uncle)
was gone.</b>
<br><b>She immediately started a search and found him soon after in Edna's
home.</b>
<br><b>Edna's reasoning was that she thought since my great grandmother&nbsp;
already had six children she shouldn't mind giving her one since her only
baby had died.&nbsp; Of course my great grandmother refused.</b>
<br><b>A few days later it was storming terribly and that is when edna
had gone down to the rail road tracks and killed herself...</b>
<br><b>To this day every night that its storming really late ,you can sit
on my great grandmothers porch and see Edna walking the railroads searching
for her baby.....</b>
<br><b>Sometimes you can even hear her crying out his name ,"Joseph".</b>
<br><b>I've never seen her ,but my mother has and so has my aunt ,and of
course my great grandmother who used to love to tell this story on stormy
nights....</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .....and
then prove what she was saying was true.</b>

<br><b>Story from the Philippines</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:acevolleygrl@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Baguio City-Marcos Hwy</b>
<br><b>Stories have been told and a relative of mine has witnessed this
highway on the way to</b>
<br><b>the vacation resort, Baguio, is haunted.&nbsp; This was due to massive
earthquake that had happened not too long ago.&nbsp; The earthquake killed
many along the way because the roads were mainly on mountainsides.&nbsp;
Also one School was buried underground</b>
<br><b>killing many and other s buried alive that weren't able to be rescued.&nbsp;
There are lots of spirits that wander this peaceful place.&nbsp; People
that visit there hear cries or wailing noises.&nbsp; People say it's the
cries of the children that were buried alive underneath the ground, unable
to be helped because they were buried so deep it was impossible to get
them out.&nbsp; You just had to pray for their souls, I guess.&nbsp; Taxi
drivers have been main victims of hauntings on the highway, I guess due
to the fact that they drive alone.&nbsp; One situation when one taxi driver
was driving on the highway when he was stopped by a lady</b>
<br><b>who said she was lost and cant find her way back home.&nbsp; The
taxi driver let her in at no charge and as he drove he noticed after awhile
the lady was gone.&nbsp; There also have been situations when one would
drive on the highway and get lost.&nbsp; People say the spirits played
tricks on you to make it seem you've been driving around in circles in
a dense fog until this one bus passes by (lets call it a bus from heaven)
and thats when you see clearly your on the right path to the vacation resort
because you see the city lights and everything.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Spirits</b><b></b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it were only one spirit, it would be
different. It was like Grand</b>
<br><b>Central Station around here for a while. My son has seen spirits
other</b>
<br><b>places also. It seems to center around him. We've gotten use to
them. The other</b>
<br><b>nite he woke up and saw two Revolutionary War soldiers lying in
his bedroom</b>
<br><b>floor. One was in the closet, and the other one was beside his bed.
He said he</b>
<br><b>thought they looked like they might have been lying in a hospital
of some</b>
<br><b>sorts. I asked him how he knew what kind of soldiers they were.
And his</b>
<br><b>answer was their red uniforms. I always questioned him in detail,
so I could</b>
<br><b>tell if he was actually seeing something, or was making it up.Since
I have</b>
<br><b>seen a few of them too, I know he's not making them up. It's quiet
here now.</b>
<br><b>But you always feel a presence. My son has even seen my Mother (who
died 17</b>
<br><b>days before he was born). He saw her standing at our back door motioning
for</b>
<br><b>him to hurry and come into the house. He came inside and asked me
what I had</b>
<br><b>wanted, but it wasn't me at the back door. The only other person
who looks</b>
<br><b>like me was my mother. He said she looked like me but was wearing
a dark</b>
<br><b>blue dress..I've often wondered if he was in some sort of danger,
and she wanted</b>
<br><b>to save him. Before she died ,she promised me she would be there
when he was</b>
<br><b>born. She died that nite......I've always thought that the "Spirits"

<br><b>The Unseen Spirit</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Aries@theshadowlands.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>The ghostly experience I will be discussing took place approximately
five or six years ago. Keep in mind that I have always been intrigued by
the supernatural and the unknown, but have never been frightened by such
things.&nbsp; In fact, I am a bit of a skeptic when it comes to things
that go bump in the night.&nbsp; However, that all changed after what happened
to me on that dark and scary night.</b>
<br><b>It all began when my current wife ( we were just dating back then),
her friend, and I went to see a band play at a local bar and concert hall
in Greenville, SC where we live.&nbsp; Each of us were about 22 or 23 back
then, so we all still lived at home with our parents. I&nbsp; was the driver
for the evening and that meant that I had to go and pick everyone up for
the concert. Well, all of us arrived to the place in one piece and we all
had a wonderful time listening to the band play.&nbsp; The concert finally
ended around midnight though and everyone had to go home.&nbsp; This is
where my story begins. The first stop was to take our mutual friend home.&nbsp;
She did not live far from where the concert hall was, so it did not take
long to get to her house.&nbsp; To understand the situation, one needs
to know the details of the house we were going to.&nbsp; It was a large
foreboding turn of the century home at the edge of an old mill village.&nbsp;
At one time, the house served as the residence for&nbsp; upper management
in the mill's heyday.&nbsp; The house itself was massive with seven bedrooms
( six of them upstairs), a library, living room, kitchen, den, and three
bathrooms.&nbsp; I had been here many times before, so I knew the place
quite well.&nbsp; The house had something new in store for me tonight though.
Once we arrived at the house, all of us had to use the bathroom, so we
all darted inside.&nbsp; My wife claimed the bathroom adjacent to the foyer,
our friend ran to the one at the back of the house off the kitchen, and
I ventured up the dark staircase to the bathroom upstairs.&nbsp; As mentioned
earlier,&nbsp; I had been up here a million times, but something was different
that night.&nbsp; The minute I arrived to the second floor hall, an uneasy
feeling came over me.&nbsp; I could not put my finger on it. All I knew
was that it made me extremely frightened.&nbsp; The hallway was long with
three bedrooms on one side, three bedrooms on the other side, and the bathroom
at the end.&nbsp; I could see my destination straight ahead through the
darkness, but could not bring myself to move. I was frozen with fear as
the hall became icy cold.&nbsp; This was most unusual because it was the
middle of summer and the house had no central cooling system.&nbsp; I finally
brought myself to walk forward and it became colder with each step&nbsp;
I took. All the doors in the hall were open and I could feel something
watching me.&nbsp; I knew no one was up there</b>
<br><b>because my friend's parents slept downstairs in the master bedroom
,and they were long since retired for the night. My adventure seemed to
come to an end when I finally reached the bathroom door.&nbsp; I darted
in and slammed it shut.&nbsp; I had forgotten about the light switch being
on the outside of the door, so I started freaking out.&nbsp; I had to open
the door again and reach my hand out to turn it on.&nbsp; I felt something
cold touch my hand. At that same moment something disappeared into one
of the rooms, like a flash of light.&nbsp; I was absolutely paralyzed with
terror!&nbsp; I did not know why I had continued to the bathroom. I could
have easily ran back down the stairs, but something seemed to&nbsp; pull
me up there. I did not know what. After I was finished in the bathroom
I ran like the wind to the bottom of the stairs and told the others of
my experience. Our friend did not seem to be shocked at all by my story.&nbsp;
In fact, she went into detail of how a child died in the house many years
ago and strange things have occurred there.&nbsp; One such event was the
sound of a baby&nbsp; crying in the wee hours of the night, even though
there are no children in the house.&nbsp; Two of her closest friends would
not even spend the night there again after just doing it once. They would
not say why either. Had I seen or felt the spirit of that supposed child
that had died so many years ago?&nbsp; I don't know because I too have
never been back there since. This experience forever changed my attitude
towards the supernatural.&nbsp; I never actually saw the spirit except
for that strange flash of light, but I know something lurked in the&nbsp;
long dark hall of that mysterious house.</b>

<p><b>My experiances with "Old Hag"</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: animeted_girl@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have had some disturbing experiances with the "Old</b>
<br><b>Hag" back in 1993-1995 in my old apartment. What I</b>
<br><b>find strange, is that this has not re-ocurred after my</b>
<br><b>husband and I moved out of that apartment. I didn't</b>
<br><b>even know until much later that there was such a thing</b>
<br><b>on record, or that anyone else had seen it. The story</b>
<br><b>that follows is my worst experiance involving the "Old</b>
<br><b>Hag".</b>
<br><b>When I went to bed that night, there was nothing</b>
<br><b>strange or out of place. No creepy feelings, no</b>
<br><b>nightmares. When morning arrived, I had an experiance</b>
<br><b>I will never forget. I was laying down in bed, and a</b>
<br><b>tall dark man-shaped malevolent thing came into my</b>
<br><b>bedroom. It had a long black cloak with a hood that</b>
<br><b>covered up his face mostly from veiw. I say it was a</b>
<br><b>male, because that was the impression that I got.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, he put his hands over my mouth and nose and</b>
<br><b>proceded to try to kill me. I had a feeling like I was</b>
<br><b>either under water with ice blocking my exit, or a</b>
<br><b>glass like barrier. I tried to remove his hands, but</b>
<br><b>that barrier blocked my efforts. That face- it looked</b>
<br><b>hateful, and it enjoyed seeing me struggle and suffer.</b>
<br><b>I was so cold. My husband called to me from the</b>
<br><b>kitchen, and then went to check on me, and when my</b>
<br><b>husband was just outside the doorway, it turned around</b>
<br><b>to look over it's shoulder, then left through the wall</b>
<br><b>(the other side of that wall was the stairway outside</b>
<br><b>our apartment). I then felt like I broke through the</b>
<br><b>surface of the barrier, and gagged and gasped for air.</b>
<br><b>My husband didn't see anything, because he hadn't</b>
<br><b>entered the room when it left.</b>

<p><b>Hello, on your page you wrote to contact you if anyone has any questions.</b>
<br><b>well, i have one based on an ecpiriance i had a long time ago. I
am German</b>
<br><b>and English is my secaund language so please excuse all my spelling</b>
<br><b>mistakes.</b>
<br><b>there is a storie to it ofcause. All my live i was raised by my
mom to</b>
<br><b>believe and open myself up to the other side. i never saw anything
untill i</b>
<br><b>was 18 years old.With my mom's help we were able to get the "message"
i was</b>
<br><b>given at that time.</b>
<br><b>after i came to the US it really started happening. Spirits would
come</b>
<br><b>arround me all the time. At first i was scared to Death. I thought
i was</b>
<br><b>looseing my mind.And again with the help of my mom and friends i
was able to</b>
<br><b>somewhat get over that. To this day i am still a little affraid
of it. They</b>
<br><b>only "come" to me when there is something i am sepossed to know.
Anyway,</b>
<br><b>here is the one storie i have a question about. Even though i have
many very</b>
<br><b>true stories to tell but now is not the time.</b>
<br><b>I came over here to georgia in 1990. My husband, our 3 year old
son and i</b>
<br><b>lived with my husbands perants for about 1 year. We moved right
next door</b>
<br><b>into a Trailor. We started getting so many "visitors" that we were
ready to</b>
<br><b>put a sighn out front that said "GHOST MOTEL" one spirit only came
to me</b>
<br><b>when i was upset about something. He was a nice looking young man
that wore</b>
<br><b>a matching suit that was light brown and the stile suggested to
me that it</b>
<br><b>must have been from the late 60's early 70's. he always gave me
a warm</b>
<br><b>feeling and i knew somehow that everything would be ok. And it alwais
was.</b>
<br><b>At that same time doctores found lumps in both of my breast. That
had me</b>
<br><b>scarred as i'm sure you can imagine. The night before i was scatuled
to go</b>
<br><b>to the hospital for an oltrasound i was very worried about what
they would</b>
<br><b>find the next day, so i fell asleep on the couch in the liveing
room( my</b>
<br><b>husband worked nights at that time). In the middle of the night
i woke up</b>
<br><b>feeling a Hand touching and then going into my Chest. At first i
was</b>
<br><b>starteled but then i felt my "Friend" so i just turned over and
went back to</b>
<br><b>sleep. The next day i went to the Hospital for the test and nothing
was</b>
<br><b>found! All the Lumps were gone over night! THIS IS THE GODS HONEST
TRUTH!!!!</b>
<br><b>My friend continued to come to me and conford me. His name was Bill.
one</b>
<br><b>Night he came to me in a dream. I will never forget it! He took
me to "His</b>
<br><b>Room" he showed me pictures that he had hanging all over the place.
Beutiful</b>
<br><b>pictures of all sorts of things. we talked and he said that he felt
alone</b>
<br><b>and ugly. Noone wanted to have anything to do with him. I could
not</b>
<br><b>understand why he would feel that way he was handsom, tall. dark
hair that</b>
<br><b>came over his ears a little. He wore that same suit that i always
saw on him</b>
<br><b>before. I told him that there was no reason to feel that way, that
i thought</b>
<br><b>alot of him and he was anything but ugly. Then he showed me one
more picture</b>
<br><b>that was hanging from a desk close to the floor. I had to scuat
down to look</b>
<br><b>at it, he did the same right behind me and put both of his arms
arround me.</b>
<br><b>I laid back into his arms and we sat there "conecting" It was a
wonderfull</b>
<br><b>feeling. Then i woke up. I have never seen or felt him since. I
don't</b>
<br><b>understand why. This might sound crazy, but i miss Bill! This is
now about 9</b>
<br><b>years ago, and i still think about him from time to time and wish
i could</b>
<br><b>spemd more time with him.</b>
<br><b>Here my question: In your opinian, Why did he stop comeing to me?
I wished i</b>
<br><b>knew.</b>

<br><b>Strange Ocurrences in Stilwell, Oklahoma</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: godzilla00@earthlink.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have been to your website numorous times and think it's great.
The story I have to tell you is about my cousin Mike who lives in Stilwell,
Ok. He is currently 20 years old.&nbsp; The story begins in 1993 when my
cousin was only 13 and just moved to Oklahoma with my 2 grandparents. Mike
decided to live in Ok with his grandparents because he did not live well
with his alcoholic mother or her boyfriend in Chicago. He made friends
easily and they always came over in the summer. One night they were all
on the front porch when they noticed something in the woods which are right
next door to my cousin's house.&nbsp; There was something atop one of the
trees that was hard to distinguish since it was dark.&nbsp; It was a tall
human like figure that was'nt humanlike in any way.&nbsp; One, because
how could someone get to the top a huge tree and be able to stand steady
and two, because it had glowing red eyes. Everyone was very freaked out
and that's when it jumped off the tree and landed creating a huge thud!!!
At that point it took off into the woods disappearing into the darkness.
My cousin was curious so he did some</b>
<br><b>research with some of my family members and found out that there
are evil spirits that dwell in woods called Skillees.&nbsp; That is a Native
American word for the beast.&nbsp; That's not the only experience my cousin
had, yet no strange things happened inside his house only outside.&nbsp;
Another story involves my couisn again along with a wolf-like animal.&nbsp;
Several months after my cousin and grandparents moved in they got a dog
called Millie which is a Samoyed. Any dog expert knows that a Samoyed had
features similar to a Siberian Husky or wolf.&nbsp; They used to keep it
in the house as a pup but after a while it started</b>
<br><b>to stay outside.&nbsp; One day my cousin decided to go to his friend's
house who lived across the field from him. Mike took the shortcut which
was a small path alon the woods next door to his house.&nbsp; His friends
came over right after he took off and saw him. They wanted to go after
him but when they got to that path, they saw what looked like a white wolf
following him until they could no longer see him.&nbsp; They waited for
him and when he got back he was alone.&nbsp; They asked him "Hey where's
your dog at ?" Mike said that Millie didn't go with him and that she stayed
at the house.&nbsp; They checked and found her at one of her spots so the
thing following mike wasn't his dog but the strange thing is that he didn't
hear any footsteps or see anything behind him.&nbsp; I have been to Stilwell
many times and it is a great place and one night around 11pm I was outside
with Mike when I caught a glimpse of a black shape moving through the trees
and that was spooky for me.&nbsp; On another note the dog Millie will be
7(49 in dog years) in September.&nbsp; She never gets sick or hurt like
the other animals my cousin has and is perfectly healthy.&nbsp; I think
that there is some strnage force that keeps her alive and well for so many
years. Although she does miss my grandmother who passed away in 1997.&nbsp;
I will find out more supernatural experiences that have occured in my family
and keep you informed in the near future.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SuGaHz-@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>This really can't account as a ghost story, but more along the lines
of</b>
<br><b>a series of events. The earliest event told to me was that of my
mom</b>
<br><b>being awake in bed reading a Stephen King book in my old room. When
she</b>
<br><b>finished, she turned off the lights and suddenly, the closet door
flew</b>
<br><b>open. Needless to say, she slept with the lights on and covers up...
The</b>
<br><b>next events have to deal with my grandfather. It occured after a
snowing</b>
<br><b>and he, my mother and I were all in the kitchen. He was looking
out the</b>
<br><b>window in the back of the kitchen (Which looks out into our backyard
and</b>
<br><b>driveway) and he swore that a car had dropped of a "lady and a fella"
in</b>
<br><b>our driveway. My mom and I looked and tried to give him possible</b>
<br><b>explanations.. (i.e. the garden hose hanging on the back fence or
the</b>
<br><b>over-grown vines on the fence post) as we could see no man or woman
but</b>
<br><b>he would accept none of this..</b>
<br><b>He was cursing us and saying he could see them and wanted to know
why we</b>
<br><b>were lying to him.. Finally, with my grandfather watching from the</b>
<br><b>window, I walked thru the yard, stopping at all possible objects
that could be</b>
<br><b>mistaken for human forms... I even walked around in the driveway
seeing</b>
<br><b>nothing. When I got back inside, however; He wanted to know why
I hadn't</b>
<br><b>tried to talk to them... He went outside himself along with me,
but</b>
<br><b>according to him, by the time we got there... They were gone.. For
the</b>
<br><b>next couple days he kept asking "You all wouldn't lie to me about
them</b>
<br><b>people would ya?!" and we hadn't. My grandfather had also been the
first</b>
<br><b>to hear the voices. My dad was at work and my grandfather came</b>
<br><b>downstairs asking if "George" (my dad) was home, because he had
heard</b>
<br><b>him saying he needed into the bathroom to shave.. The next voice
event</b>
<br><b>occured with me. My dad was once again at work and I was at my sick</b>
<br><b>grandfathers'</b>
<br><b>bedside.. My mother was in the room beside us when I swore I had
heard</b>
<br><b>my dad yell either "Pappy!" or "Kathy!" (My mom's name.) I even
went to</b>
<br><b>ask her if he was home yet.. and he wasn't. (Sorry this is so long...)</b>
<br><b>Over the past couple of months every once in awhile I would hear
someone</b>
<br><b>call my name. Late at nite while I was still up I would hear it
while</b>
<br><b>everyone else slept.. and I even heard it one morning before leaving
for</b>
<br><b>school. I could never place the voice until recently. My mom was
asleep</b>
<br><b>in her upstairs bedroom and my boyfriend and I were in the kitchen</b>
<br><b>talking when we both stopped at the same time. We both heard someone</b>
<br><b>call my name and it sounded like my mom yet when I went to her room,
she</b>
<br><b>was sound asleep. I woke her up and asked if she had called for
me and</b>
<br><b>she said that she didn't know, she might have.. SO that explains
that</b>
<br><b>one.. But not the times after that when I heard the voice of my
mom</b>
<br><b>calling my name.. and she was NOT in the house.. I've heard it while
I</b>
<br><b>was here with just my grandfather.. and my boyfriend and I have
both</b>
<br><b>heard it.. when my mother is miles away at my dads house. The fact
that</b>
<br><b>"She's" calling my name, scares me to the point that when Im here
alone</b>
<br><b>at nite, I turn on every light and find myself constantly glancing
over</b>
<br><b>my shoulder. Another event dealing with me was when I walked into
our</b>
<br><b>front room that has a tight-fitting door out into a hallway. I don't</b>
<br><b>know why, but out loud I commented that I wished something "twisted</b>
<br><b>would happen" and just then that door popped ajar, sending me running
to</b>
<br><b>my mom.. LoL.. Once, during the winter my mom and I were out going
to</b>
<br><b>the store in her Kia, when the car filled with the sweet smell of</b>
<br><b>perfume.. We could both smell it, yet the windows were up and neither
of</b>
<br><b>us wear perfume.. The "Male" ghost of the house that sounds like
my dad</b>
<br><b>has been dubbed "Larry," by me and the "Female" is just plain called</b>
<br><b>"Larry's wife." Late at night, you can also find my cat running
up and</b>
<br><b>down the stairs seemingly terrified and he won't come off the attic.
The</b>
<br><b>fact that the female voice sounds like my mom, keeps me out of her
room</b>
<br><b>late at night when she isn't there..</b>
<br><b>We also have 2 dogs that bark at unheard noises and unseen things..
I've</b>
<br><b>even caught them directing all their attention to something that
seemed</b>
<br><b>to be floating on the ceiling.. and the last event I have to add
is that</b>
<br><b>after missing my mother, i climbed into her bed at 2 in the morning
2</b>
<br><b>nites ago and had ONE blanket on top of me because it was only chilly.</b>
<br><b>This bed was beside the closet and in the bottom of the closet was
a</b>
<br><b>furry blanket that during the night when I got colder, thought of</b>
<br><b>pulling up onto the bed.. Yet I never did. When I awoke in the morning,</b>
<br><b>however; the blanket was drapped across me and my mother denies
ever</b>
<br><b>doing it. It's 7:26pm now and Im sure that as soon as it gets dark,
just</b>
<br><b>because I forced myself to recall all these events, our electric
bill is</b>
<br><b>gonna be a bit higher.. LoL Thanks for letting me share..</b>

<p><b>Lucy</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: AndreaS@campbellco.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Well, this was actually a comical ghost experience.&nbsp; I was competing
at a</b>
<br><b>National level horse show and I was training with an equitation</b>
<br><b>(horsemanship) instructor whose barn was in southern Indiana.&nbsp;
My trainer</b>
<br><b>from Michigan and I were staying at a Bed &amp; Breakfast which
was known for</b>
<br><b>its paranormal resident named Lucy.&nbsp; (I wish I could remember
the name of</b>
<br><b>the B&amp;B but it was almost 8 years ago).</b>
<br><b>We were at breakfast and I was sitting against a window with wood
shutters.</b>
<br><b>I ordered my breakfast and started a conversation with my trainer
while we</b>
<br><b>waited for our food.&nbsp; As we talked the shutter closest to my
shoulder</b>
<br><b>started to slowly open.&nbsp; Not even paying attention and continuing
my</b>
<br><b>conversation, I pushed the shutter back into its folded position.&nbsp;
It</b>
<br><b>continued to slowly unfold several times, each time I would continue
talking</b>
<br><b>and push it back to its proper place.&nbsp; Since the window was
closed and there</b>
<br><b>was no draft, I just thought the shutter hinges were loose.</b>
<br><b>Our food finally came and again I found myself closing the shutter
so I</b>
<br><b>could place my plate on the table.&nbsp; As a joke, my trainer said,
"Hey, its</b>
<br><b>Lucy.&nbsp; And she's really trying to irritate you!"&nbsp; We laughed
and I pushed</b>
<br><b>the shutter back into its place, same as I had just done the last
five or</b>
<br><b>six times and jokingly said, "Alright Lucy...I'm hungry.&nbsp; Knock
it off!"</b>
<br><b>The shutter stayed in its place and never bothered me again that
morning!</b>
<br><b>The waitress later told us that Lucy loved to do stuff like that
and the</b>
<br><b>staff had gotten used to indulging her a few times in her mischievous
acts</b>
<br><b>before they told her enough was enough.&nbsp; That's the kind of
ghost I can</b>
<br><b>handle.&nbsp; I hope I never have a confrontation as scary as some
of the posts</b>
<br><b>at this site!!&nbsp; Although, I do believe that most of the stories
about "not</b>
<br><b>being able to move while something held down in bed" is a classic
case of</b>
<br><b>sleep paralysis.&nbsp; It happens to TONS of people and they often
report seeing</b>
<br><b>moving objects while it is happening because the brain has not snapped
out</b>
<br><b>of REM sleep but you are awake...hence you can't move.&nbsp; Those
suffering</b>
<br><b>should read about it...it is an actual, clinically documented occurrence.</b>

<p><b>Mitzi -- A True Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: eileen.loiacono@us.randstad.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;I have a true story</b>
<br><b>that I'd like to share with you and other believers in life after
death. My</b>
<br><b>entire family experienced this activity.</b>
<br><b>When I was growing up, we had a dog named Mitzi. She was a black
miniature</b>
<br><b>poodle and she was very attached to the family, especially my mother.</b>
<br><b>I believe the year was 1984. In May of that year, when Mitzi was
12 years</b>
<br><b>old, her life time of health problems finally took their toll. My
mom took</b>
<br><b>her to the vet and sadly put her to rest. She brought Mitzi's body
home and</b>
<br><b>we buried her in the back yard.</b>
<br><b>For three months after her death, Mitzi's presence was seen and
felt in the</b>
<br><b>house by my myself, my brother, sister and parents. Occasionally,
we would</b>
<br><b>see her sitting in some of her favorite places, such as at the end
of the</b>
<br><b>hallway looking over the landing, or sitting on her usual chair
in the</b>
<br><b>kitchen, resting her chin on the dining table. The sightings were
only for</b>
<br><b>an instant, but we all knew we saw her.</b>
<br><b>In life, Mitzi would get upset whenever my mother dressed for work.
She</b>
<br><b>would curl up on a lounge chair in my parent's bedroom and sigh
as my mom</b>
<br><b>dressed. My mom stated that she heard Mitzi sighing several times
but only</b>
<br><b>as she dressed for work, weeks after she had died. My sister stated
she</b>
<br><b>heard Mitzi's heavy breathing in the bathroom one day in July. Mitzi
liked</b>
<br><b>to lay on the cool tile floor when the weather was hot. The final
incident</b>
<br><b>occurred one evening in August, 3 months after Mitzi's "departure".
While my</b>
<br><b>whole family was having dinner at the kitchen table, all of a sudden,
we</b>
<br><b>heard Mitzi's distinct bark come from my parents bedroom. We all
looked at</b>
<br><b>each other because we all knew we had just heard Mitzi bark. No
other dog</b>
<br><b>had a bark like hers. After that, we never saw her or heard her
again. It</b>
<br><b>was as if&nbsp; that bark was her way of saying goodbye for the
last time.</b>
<br><b>I have another personal story of experiences that happened only
to me in the</b>
<br><b>same house, but I don't have time to write it now. I will try to
send that</b>
<br><b>story another time.</b>
<br><b>Just a quick note that may interest you:</b>
<br><b>My mom passed away in 1993. Shortly after her death, I had a dream
that I</b>
<br><b>was walking Mitzi. She was in a real hurry to get to her destination.
She</b>
<br><b>was really pulling me along. I don't know where I was or where we
were going</b>
<br><b>-- my surroundings were foggy. Then all of a sudden, Mitzi led me
into a</b>
<br><b>clearing, like a big field. I sensed people -- a lot of people --
talking</b>
<br><b>amongst themselves, all around the perimeter of this "field". I
knew in my</b>
<br><b>dream they must be waiting to go somewhere, but I didn't know where.
Then I</b>
<br><b>heard my mother call out my name several times, just as if she were
next to</b>
<br><b>me. Suddenly, I was standing next to my mom and she was talking
to some</b>
<br><b>people. I didn't see the other people and I really didn't even see
my mom,</b>
<br><b>although I knew she was standing right in front of me. She didn't
speak to</b>
<br><b>me -- she never broke her conversation with whomever she was conversing</b>
<br><b>with. I remember her extending out her hand and then I handed her
the loop</b>
<br><b>to Mitzi's leash. I immediately woke up. I felt that I had been
chosen to</b>
<br><b>unite Mitzi and my mom on the other side. But I wonder, why me?
(I also had</b>
<br><b>other dreams about my Mom before this dream -- that was the last
one I</b>
<br><b>remember having about her.)</b><b></b>

<br><b>Maine Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: TNegri@ginne.org</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I moved to Maine with my family when I was 14 because my mom was</b>
<br><b>transferred.&nbsp; My father is disabled and stayed home with us.&nbsp;
I have always</b>
<br><b>been "sensitive" to things in general.&nbsp; Knowing when I was
about 7 that we</b>
<br><b>would move to Maine someday and knowing very specific things about
my great</b>
<br><b>grandmother (my "Omah"), even though she passed shortly before I
was born.</b>
<br><b>I only had one previous experience w/ ghosts though and that happened
when I</b>
<br><b>was young.&nbsp; When I was approximately 5, I woke up late at night
and wandered</b>
<br><b>out to the living room.&nbsp; There on the couch was my father (he
usually fell</b>
<br><b>asleep on the couch while watching TV).; the TV was on but there
was no</b>
<br><b>picture, just snow so it must have been pretty late.&nbsp; When
I looked back at</b>
<br><b>my father, there were two small girls, about my age, sitting on
the couch.</b>
<br><b>I know I was awake, I turned off the TV and they were still there!&nbsp;
I told</b>
<br><b>the girls to get away from my father.&nbsp; They didn't budge but
something told</b>
<br><b>me that they needed a father too so I went back to bed.</b>
<br><b>Since that time, I hadn't had another experience until we moved
to Maine.</b>
<br><b>My parents bought a 6-bedroom farm house in Sebago, a small town
in the</b>
<br><b>Lakes Region.&nbsp; It had a connected barn, and about 20 or so
acres.&nbsp; I chose</b>
<br><b>the room upstairs in the farthest corner of the house.&nbsp; It
was small but had</b>
<br><b>a great view of our yard.&nbsp; The house was surrounded by woods
and the closest</b>
<br><b>neighbors were &frac12; a mile away.</b>
<br><b>After a couple of weeks I noticed a black shadow walk past me in
the morning</b>
<br><b>while I was getting ready for school.&nbsp; I saw it out of the
corner of my eye,</b>
<br><b>but I was sure that I saw something.&nbsp; No one else was awake
and no one</b>
<br><b>answered when I called out.&nbsp; Every morning for the 7 years
we lived there,</b>
<br><b>that shadow passed me in the morning.</b>
<br><b>That wasn't the only thing that was strange about this house, although
it</b>
<br><b>was the first indication.&nbsp; Talking could be heard throughout
the house.&nbsp; If</b>
<br><b>you were downstairs, it was upstairs and vice-versa.&nbsp; Strange
knocking and</b>
<br><b>rapping, lights going on and off, footsteps coming down the stairs
(these</b>
<br><b>were witnessed by several visitors to our house as well), doors
opening and</b>
<br><b>closing on their own (even my door which you would have to forcefully
pull</b>
<br><b>over the carpeting would open wide).</b>
<br><b>It wasn't all harmless parlor tricks.&nbsp; People were afraid to
be home alone,</b>
<br><b>including myself.&nbsp; I never saw much but I had been spoken to
frequently.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>came home one afternoon after basketball practice and I heard, plain
as day,</b>
<br><b>my father calling for me.&nbsp; He sounded pretty angry.&nbsp; I
didn't think anyone</b>
<br><b>was home and the voice was coming from the end of the house furthest
away</b>
<br><b>from where I was.&nbsp; Something didn't feel right so I stayed
in the kitchen.</b>
<br><b>I stayed there for awhile until my dad got home.&nbsp; He was just
as surprised</b>
<br><b>as I when he heard my story.&nbsp; He then told me a story of his
own.</b>
<br><b>When we first moved in, the last family (the only other family to
own this</b>
<br><b>property) had left some belongings behind.&nbsp; They only used
it as a hunting</b>
<br><b>camp (even though it was a huge house) and neglected to clear out
some lamps</b>
<br><b>and other small items here and there.&nbsp; My father was downstairs
and an</b>
<br><b>elderly woman appeared to him.&nbsp; She told him to put the shudders
on the</b>
<br><b>house because "they were coming".&nbsp; It so happened that my father
was</b>
<br><b>standing by 20 or so sets of shudders when he saw her.&nbsp; She
didn't stick</b>
<br><b>around to answer the question of who was coming though.&nbsp; My
dad was</b>
<br><b>dumbfounded.&nbsp; He never did put up those shudders; maybe he
should have.</b>
<br><b>So, the weekend ritual of staying up all night and talking was born.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>father and I, being night owls, stayed up and played board games
or just</b>
<br><b>talked while we drank tea.&nbsp; We went to bed around 5 a.m., when
my mother</b>
<br><b>would get up to go to work.&nbsp; During those nights we heard some
of the</b>
<br><b>strangest things!&nbsp; Horses galloping in our driveway when ours
were securely</b>
<br><b>locked in the stable, what sounded like a woman screaming, coming
from</b>
<br><b>outside.</b>
<br><b>A couple years after we moved in I was visited by something bearing
a</b>
<br><b>warning.&nbsp; It was around 4 a.m. (I can't be exact because the
power was out)</b>
<br><b>and I heard a man say "wake up and hear the storm".&nbsp; I was
awake by then</b>
<br><b>because there was a terrible electrical storm outside and the horses</b>
<br><b>whinnying caught my attention.&nbsp; As I groped around in the dark,
I was keenly</b>
<br><b>aware that someone had just spoken to me.&nbsp; I thought my dad
was there but no</b>
<br><b>one answered when I called out.&nbsp; The house was quiet as I made
my way</b>
<br><b>downstairs.&nbsp; I went outside and the horses were scared and
running around</b>
<br><b>the yard.&nbsp; It took me 2 hours but I gathered them up and put
them safely in</b>
<br><b>the stable.&nbsp; Had that presence tried to wake me to help my
horses?</b>
<br><b>Through the years we were plagued by disembodied voices, smudgy
hand prints,</b>
<br><b>sooty crosses marked on our skin, putrid smells, threatening voices
and</b>
<br><b>pranks.&nbsp; My brother was born when I was 16 and when he was
old enough to</b>
<br><b>talk he would say monster or would talk to some one we couldn't
see.&nbsp; We had</b>
<br><b>never uttered the work monster or mentioned the ghosts for fear
that he</b>
<br><b>might be frightened.</b>
<br><b>The last thing to happen to me in that house was when my boyfriend
and I</b>
<br><b>spent the summer at my house when college let out.&nbsp; We were
sleeping</b>
<br><b>upstairs in what used to be my father's room (he and my mother had
separated</b>
<br><b>and he moved out).&nbsp; My mother had already gone to work and
my younger sister</b>
<br><b>was at a friend's house.&nbsp; The wind was blowing furiously through
the house</b>
<br><b>but when we looked outside, everything was calm.&nbsp; We also heard
a banging</b>
<br><b>downstairs, like someone was trying to break in.&nbsp; We crept
downstairs w/ the</b>
<br><b>phone in my hand (you learn not to call 911 too fast when you live
in a</b>
<br><b>house like ours).&nbsp; When we reached the door to the kitchen
it was being hit</b>
<br><b>so hard it looked like it was about to come off the hinges if it
didn't open</b>
<br><b>soon.&nbsp; I reached out and opened the door (I was scared to death)
and there</b>
<br><b>was no one there!&nbsp; The noise had stopped and we didn't hear
anything for the</b>
<br><b>rest of the day.</b>
<br><b>There are more occurrences but I'll save them for another day.</b>
<br><b>So, to the events that occurred while I lived on campus (sorry this
is so</b>
<br><b>long).&nbsp; I moved into the oldest dorm on campus when I was 18,
nothing</b>
<br><b>eventful happened the first year (except when I went home).&nbsp;
The second year</b>
<br><b>I moved into my own room in a different part of the building and
that's when</b>
<br><b>things became interesting.&nbsp; The eerie feeling that I wasn't
alone was always</b>
<br><b>present.&nbsp; Footstep that would stop at my bed while I was laying
there w/ my</b>
<br><b>eyes scrunched closed and the ever-present footsteps outside of
my door (my</b>
<br><b>room was in a corner all by itself and no one ever walked past it).&nbsp;
I know</b>
<br><b>that it could have been a fellow student but I could see the shadow
of a</b>
<br><b>person standing outside my room when I looked under the door but
when I</b>
<br><b>looked out of the peep-hole, no one was there.&nbsp; I began sleeping
in a</b>
<br><b>friend's room.</b>
<br><b>Fast forward to my 1st apartment.&nbsp; When I was a senior, I got
my first</b>
<br><b>apartment w/ my fianc&eacute;.&nbsp; It was a cute 2 bedroom on
the west end of</b>
<br><b>Portland.&nbsp; We noticed things weren't quite right there.&nbsp;
Things would</b>
<br><b>disappear only to show up exactly where we had left them (a book
that was</b>
<br><b>placed on my trunk in the bedroom, disappeared for 3 days and then
showed up</b>
<br><b>on the trunk on the 4th day).&nbsp; The stereo would turn on by
itself (the CD</b>
<br><b>player would come on and you needed to turn a switch to do that).&nbsp;
The doors</b>
<br><b>would open by themselves and you could hear distinct footsteps at
all hours</b>
<br><b>of the day and night.</b>
<br><b>When my boyfriend and I broke up, I stayed at this apartment w/
my dog.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>still heard footsteps and she seemed to follow something around
w/ her eyes.</b>
<br><b>By then I was used to it and didn't feel quite so bad.&nbsp; It
felt more</b>
<br><b>comfortable than my old house (which had been sold by then) and
my dorm</b>
<br><b>room.</b>
<br><b>I got married last year and my husband and I bought an adorable
little house</b>
<br><b>together.&nbsp; The same stuff is happening there too.&nbsp; Things
shaking pretty</b>
<br><b>hard w/out any discernable vibrations.&nbsp; The sound of things
falling w/out</b>
<br><b>anything out of place, shadows that seem to move.&nbsp; My husband
has nightmares</b>
<br><b>every night.&nbsp; I haven't seen anything, nor do I feel afraid
but is it</b>
<br><b>possible that something has attached itself to me?&nbsp; Or am I
just picking up</b>
<br><b>various entities?&nbsp; I have many more stories but I'll save them
for another</b>
<br><b>time.&nbsp; Although some of this might seem fantastic, I swear
all of this is</b>
<br><b>true.&nbsp; I'm a fairly conservative, 25 year old woman who isn't
taken w/</b>
<br><b>flights of fancy.&nbsp; I did not embellish any of this.&nbsp; And
while I used to</b>
<br><b>actively hunt for ghosts, I am currently too busy w/ my job, husband
and 2</b>
<br><b>Australian cattle dogs to be bothered w/ it.&nbsp; If you have any
insight, it</b>
<br><b>would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; You may also post this if you
wish.</b><b></b>

<br><b>New Apartment Ghost</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: please2ns@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>After graduating high school, I decided that I needed to be independent
from</b>
<br><b>my parents care.&nbsp; I had saved up enough money to move in with
my two really good friends.&nbsp; We decided to rent an old beach apartment
for the summer before we</b>
<br><b>would head off to college.&nbsp; For weeks everything went fine.&nbsp;
My friend Kate</b>
<br><b>and I would share one room with two twin beds, while my friend Justin
would sleep in the much smaller room alone.&nbsp; One Wednesday morning,
I was left alone in the house.</b>
<br><b>I didn't have to work for the day, so I was still asleep at 9 am.&nbsp;
I woke up to see to my surprise that a strange man was sitting on the bottom
corner of my tiny bed.&nbsp; I thought he was a strange intruder.&nbsp;
He was a tanned caucasian with dark hair and in his thirties.&nbsp; I'm
not much of a screamer, but more of a delayed reactor.&nbsp; I just looked
up at him, unsure if this was a dream or not,&nbsp; I was still half asleep
after all.&nbsp; Before I could jump out</b>
<br><b>of my bed and run out of the room, he started to move his lips,
yet no sound came out.&nbsp; Luckily, the phone was on the other side of
the bed, so I decided to reach out and grab it, but when I turned back
to look at him, he was gone.&nbsp; After that, I left the apartment and
went to my parents' house for the rest of the day.&nbsp; I went back to
the apartment when Justin and Kate got back from work.&nbsp; I told them
everything.&nbsp; They suggested everything from a robber to a ghost.&nbsp;&nbsp;
At first I was positive that it was just some weird incedent with an intruder
and he left before I could turn back.&nbsp; But then I started to wonder
how he could move his lips as if to say something, but be unable to talk.&nbsp;
He looked completely harmless and really appeared as if he had something
important to tell me.&nbsp; On the</b>
<br><b>following week, my work routine was the same.&nbsp; I slept-in again
while my roomates were out and work.&nbsp; And I saw the same exact occurances
unfold before me.&nbsp; This time he moved his lips for even&nbsp; longer,
and was about to reach out and touch my leg, but then vanished.&nbsp; I
was positive this was a ghost, but I wasn't ready</b>
<br><b>to do anything about it. I left again after hanging around my house
for an hour because I knew he couldn't do anything.&nbsp; When my roommates
came home they were positive that I was making things up.&nbsp; I am known
for telling a good story that isn't&nbsp; true.&nbsp; But this time I was
honest.&nbsp; For the next two weeks I worked in the mornings, so I didn't
encounter the ghost.&nbsp; But on&nbsp; the second Wedensday, Kate had
the day off and decided to sleep in.&nbsp; When I left at 7 am, she moved
to my bed to get&nbsp; away from the cold ocean air, but I didn't expect
what would happen later would occur at all.&nbsp; I got home at around
2 pm, to&nbsp; see that she had been on thew phone, calling every one she
knew, whether they had any information about ghosts.&nbsp; She hung&nbsp;
up the phone and reiterated everything that had happened to her, just as
it had happened to me.&nbsp; When Justin came home,&nbsp; we all decided
that it was time to move out.&nbsp; We had a month to month lease, so we
could move out by the end of the week without paying for the next month.&nbsp;
We packed the next day.&nbsp; As Justin was cleaning the top shelves of
our bedroom&nbsp; closet, he found a picture frame with a man's photo.&nbsp;
He called me in to ask if I knew who it was.&nbsp; At that moment I screamed
and Katelyn ran in and did the same.&nbsp; It was out ghost.&nbsp; Clearly
it was a photo of him in the 1950's all dressed up, but&nbsp; with no name
anywhere on it.&nbsp; After that, we never bothered to look and see who
he was, but KAte still has the photo.</b>
