It&#8217;s not something you can easily find information about, but the
stories are there: People who see floating or ghostly eyes. Sometimes
the eyes are red, sometimes they are yellow. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
One empath who contacted me had this story to share: &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&#8220;I been working on raising my empathy abilities to help me with any
spirits. I have been, for past 6 months, seeing ghostly eyes watching
me when I&#8217;m outside at night. Odd thing is, they&#8217;re not human eyes. I
asked other psychic friends to help me get an ID of these beings, but
all they could come up with is animal spirits. But I was already
thinking that cause they look more wolf-like, but not jumping the gun
on that. I need to see their form. These are higher level spirits, so
kind of blocks any empathic visions. But wolf keeps popping up in my
head. I will try get correct ID on these spirits.&#8221;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Later, after several months, Harry gave me an update on his visitors.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been seeing ghostly eyes of about 10 spirits. Started with just
one pair of eyes, and grew from there. Not looking human.&#8221; He describes
these eyes as a &#8220;kind of yellow iris and outer lining and under the
eyebrows.&#8221; He added, &#8220;These look animal-like, like wolves. Well, now I
hear howling, so now I know that&#8217;s who they are. Watching me, and
following me wherever I go.&#8221;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
As rare as information about this ghostly occurrence may be, rarer
still is the ability to tell which kind of entity they are, or what
their intentions may be. In Harry&#8217;s case, as an empath, he was able to
figure out the nature behind his visitors. However, he is yet to
understand what their messages could be. &#8220;I try everything to
communicate with these spirits, but all they do is stare and blink.&#8221;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Another story about this situation came to my attention recently. &#8220;I
have seen what looks like floating eyes before,&#8221; Millie C. said. &#8220;I was
only able to tell they were eyes because of the eyelashes. I was laying
in bed and was wide awake and saw a shape of someone&#8217;s head, and then
the eyes came more into focus but looked really blurry and then they
started blinking kind of a lot, and I could tell they were eyes because
of the eyelashes. The eyelashes looked extra long. I remember thinking
it was (a friend&#8217;s mom) standing there, but the person seemed
light-haired and I realized that it was just a deranged figure. I asked
(my friend) the next day if her mom came in the room last night and she
said &#8216;no&#8217; and I told her what I saw. She said my eyes were probably
messed up form playing video games. I don't know what kind of video
games could make me see that.&#8221;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
As someone accustomed to seeing ghosts, Millie was unprepared and
perplexed by this occurrence. &#8220;I hadn't forgotten because I had never
seen eyes before on ghosts,&#8221; she said.<br>

(a case of seeing red eyes)<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The good news is, there is an explanation behind these visits. Martha
Jette (http://www.freewebs.com/paranormalbooks/ and
http://www.angelfire.com/planet/pwtd), a Canadian author and editor
who&#8217;s written books such as Talking To My Angel, Glimpses: True Stories
of the Paranormal and Glimpses 2: It Could Happen To You! Has spent
many years researching and investigating stories of a paranormal
nature. &#8220;First of all, the entity wants those who see it to focus on
the eyes and not a whole body or ethereal form,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Secondly,
red means anger, so I would imagine that the entity is very angry about
something that was done to him/her and glaring with those red eyes gets
the point across. From stories that I've read, this would correlate
with the fear that such a sight instills in those who see such a thing,
as well as the drastic drop in temperature that is usually evident as
well.&#8221;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
When asked about the possibility that Harry&#8217;s visitors were animal
spirits, Jette concurred. &#8220;I would tend to agree that yellow eyes are
likely that of an animal spirit, such as a cougar or mountain lion. It
could be that it was the person's totem animal and they didn't realize
it in the case you mention here and it is quite likely that there was
some message the creature was trying to relay, if not just to let the
person know of its presence (a frightful as that might have been).&#8221; <br>
&nbsp;<br>
If no messages or images are received by the person seeing the eyes,
perhaps the best thing to do is to give it some time. Perhaps there are
too many mental blocks impeding mental communication or emotions
disrupt the ability to receive any kind of message from the visitor. In
any event, people who see the floating/ghostly eyes can rest assured
they&#8217;re not necessarily &#8220;seeing things&#8221; and that the eyes are there for
a reason.<br>
