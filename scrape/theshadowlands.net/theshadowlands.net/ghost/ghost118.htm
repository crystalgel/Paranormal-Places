<b>LIFE EXPERIENCES WITH THE PARANORMAL</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: tdstover@mailhost.col.ameritech.net</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hi, my name is Jami Stover, and I would like to share with</b>
<br><b>you some of my life experiences with the Paranormal.</b>
<br><b>The first experience that I would like to share with you, I will
call</b>
<br><b>old man George.We moved in the house on Bradly in Indianaolis,In.And
I</b>
<br><b>had livd in the house since I was 4 years, my experiences started
to</b>
<br><b>occur when I was about 7 or 8 you know the time when you usually
get in</b>
<br><b>trouble for things like leaving the tv on, anyways I would here
foot</b>
<br><b>steps during all hours of the day and things would disappear and
then</b>
<br><b>reappear some where and the ghost would even get me inn trouble
from</b>
<br><b>time to time, because I would go to bed at night and when I got
up the</b>
<br><b>next day my step father would always be there to greet me and my
sister</b>
<br><b>and brother and yell at us because we were wasting electricity and
he</b>
<br><b>would say turn the tv off when you go to bed it costs money,"oh
how</b>
<br><b>those words still echo in my head to day" and our reply would be
as</b>
<br><b>always we did turn it off dad,but he would always look at us with
that</b>
<br><b>yeah right look and just walk off. This went on all through my teenage</b>
<br><b>years and once my boyfriend,(now husband) came over to spend the
night</b>
<br><b>and got to experience that on his own tv unplugged and this he could</b>
<br><b>verify awoke only to find the tv on in the morning and a dumbfounded</b>
<br><b>look on his face. To my knowledge Old man george still lives in
that old</b>
<br><b>house on Bradly and is still haunting it to this day.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My next experience took place in my moms trailer when I</b>
<br><b>was thirteen years old, now I went back and forth between my moms
and my</b>
<br><b>step dads houses all throughout life and I am of sound mind so non
of</b>
<br><b>this is made up so here it goes.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
From the moment I first set foot in the old trailer It</b>
<br><b>gave me the creeps, and I knew an old lady had lived there and I
am</b>
<br><b>pretty sure she died there,also.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It started right off the bat, It started with hearing my</b>
<br><b>name being called and my mom thought that I was on drugs because
I would</b>
<br><b>always ask her if she called my name when in fact she had not, and
she</b>
<br><b>would never hear a thing.then to make matters worse, I would be
there</b>
<br><b>alone and I would here it when no one was there I "ALWAYS FELT LIKE
I</b>
<br><b>WAS BEING WATCHED" and would get intense cold feelings and emotions
of</b>
<br><b>anger and jealously. I would feel like someone walked right through
me</b>
<br><b>and my hair would stand on end.I absolutely hated the place and
being</b>
<br><b>there by myself. I felt that whow ever or what ever it was did not
like</b>
<br><b>me at all and I had no trouble sensing that.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Later when I was grown and had moved out, my mother told</b>
<br><b>me that she saw an old woman standing in the door way of the back</b>
<br><b>bedroom more than once before she moved into her new trailer across
the</b>
<br><b>street. And my mother has even told me she has been visited by her
once</b>
<br><b>after she moved out.At a time of trouble the specter visited my
mother</b>
<br><b>and said not to worry she would take care of it and after that it
was.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For my last and final story that I will list on this</b>
<br><b>page takes place in the getto of Indy where my best friend at the
time</b>
<br><b>lived.She said she would here noise in the kitchen like if someone&nbsp;
was</b>
<br><b>doing the dishes also she said&nbsp; she would see a heavy set colored
woman</b>
<br><b>when she would be cleaning.but my experience is a bit more dramatic
and</b>
<br><b>it is the absolute most frightening of the experiences that I have
had</b>
<br><b>and is the one that I will never forget.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One night I was lying in the bed awake with my</b>
<br><b>eyes closed, and was just thinking that my boyfriend would be home
soon</b>
<br><b>and how I could not wait to see him. Then I felt someone get into
the</b>
<br><b>bed and lay down next to me, and I rolled over to happily greet
my</b>
<br><b>boyfriend,but when I opened my eyes there was no one there with
me,</b>
<br><b>however the impression of a body most undoubtedly a man was indented
in</b>
<br><b>the bed next to me, I immediately rushed up out of bed in a fit
of</b>
<br><b>terror and ran out into the living room where my boyfriend greeted
my</b>
<br><b>dumbfounded by my hysterical antics also very confused. I never
stayed</b>
<br><b>in that place again and that was the most frightening&nbsp; experience
that</b>
<br><b>maid all others pale by comparison.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I hope that you have enjoyed my experiences, I have</b>
<br><b>many more experiences that I could share but these will do for now.
I</b>
<br><b>think that I must be sensitive to the paranormal or they just like
to</b>
<br><b>scare the crap out of me.so long and I will put up more stories
in the</b>
<br><b>future, for I have plenty of them to tell.</b>

<br><b>My Ghost</b>
<p><b>By: SherryeCar@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Hello, my name is Christye. IM 17 years old. See, my great grandmother</b>
<br><b>died in Feb. of 99. We think she is the ghost that takes up residence
in our</b>
<br><b>house. Heres my story. One night while I was waiting for my boyfriend
to</b>
<br><b>come over, I was sitting in my living room. The light in my room
was on because</b>
<br><b>I was getting my newborn ready for bed. All the sudden the light
turned off,</b>
<br><b>then it came back on again. I didn't pay any attention to it, because
I</b>
<br><b>get scared very easily and I didn't want to get worked up over it
so I just</b>
<br><b>blew it off. Well, after my boyfriend came and went I fell asleep
on my couch.</b>
<br><b>About 4:30 in the morning my son woke up hungry so I fed him and
all the</b>
<br><b>good stuff. I then went and crawled in bed, and I sleep with my
radio on. Well,</b>
<br><b>all the sudden, it just turned off. I couldn't have rolled over
on the</b>
<br><b>remote, because my son was sleeping on my chest. The power didn't
turn</b>
<br><b>off, because when the power goes off, my radio resets itself. I
got all spooked</b>
<br><b>and finally fell asleep. Later that morning I woke up to someone
tapping</b>
<br><b>on my window. I got up to look, and I didn't see anything. As I
turned to go</b>
<br><b>back to bed, I heard it again. No one was there. I finally fell
back</b>
<br><b>asleep.</b>
<br><b>About 2 hours later, my mom called to wake me up. As we were talking,
she</b>
<br><b>said that something weird happened to her that morning. I said "me
too!".</b>
<br><b>I told her what happened to me, then she told me what happened.
she was in</b>
<br><b>her room, with the door shut getting ready for work. She said that
she heard a</b>
<br><b>person sneeze. It wasn't me because I was sleeping, and it couldn't
have</b>
<br><b>been my son because he was sleeping, and if he sneezed it would
have woke me</b>
<br><b>up. When she looked there was nobody there. Well, yesterday morning,
my</b>
<br><b>boyfriend woke up and left my house to go get me breakfast from
McDonalds. While he</b>
<br><b>was gone, I heard footsteps come down my hall, turn around, go back
down the</b>
<br><b>hall, come back, then turn around and leave again. I was scared
to death.</b>
<br><b>Then this morning my mom called again. See, we have a filing cabinet
next</b>
<br><b>to our computer desk that has a key, but the key is always in the
top drawer.</b>
<br><b>My mom came to get on the computer last night and the key was in
the key</b>
<br><b>hole. She asked me if I put it in there. I couldn't have because
I didn't even</b>
<br><b>know where the key was. My step-dad didn't do it because he didn't
know where</b>
<br><b>it was either. My mom thinks that the "ghost" isn't harmful, but
it still</b>
<br><b>scares me. Were now keeping dates when all the weird stuff happens
to us.</b>

<br><b>I'll See You in My Dreams!</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: SAPHYR6@ANGELFIRE.COM</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&nbsp; A little background on me;I'm 26 yrs old,&nbsp; french is
my first language so don't fuss over mistakes.I never confirmed to myself
that ghost exist but 3 things happen to me I can't explain and the following
story.so any of you got an explanations or opinions ...feel free to write.</b>
<p><b>This is 3 dreams and a really wierd coincidence that I had about
someone close to me. But first you have to know a couple of things . I
met Guy in '94 , through some mutual friends, in Vancouver(Canada). We
had something going on but we were to afraid ,I guess, to say that we had
some feelings towards each other. He had a problem with hard drugs, since
I had been on that road and knew well enough the consequences, I told him
that I could'nt be around that stuff and as long as he did it could'nt
be around him. He understood and went his own way for a while until he
went in detox and he called me back a couple month later. Well, something
I know about hard drugs is that it always calls you back so I told him
that it was great for him to make a step but maybe he needed more time
to know his limits and his weaknesses.....a couple months later he went
back to it!!</b>
<p><b>That went on for 3 years, totally broke my heart but the last year
he went in and out of the hospital where I went and see him. He never told
me what he had, I learned after his death from a friend that he had AIDS.
I never knew why he never told me.</b>
<p><b>Bare with me , this is revelent, I moved to Vancouver and lived there
for 4 years(love that city) but for personnal reason I planned in December
'97 to go back home in Montreal and bought the airplane ticket for the
next month, January 26, '98. I told Guy and he said " I'll be seeing you
in Montreal next month".</b>
<p><b>Well, that's when the dreams started( I was still in Vancouver).
The first one was in January '98, I was in a room.... kinda...(you know
dreams, weird!) Guy came to me, he looked good but sad. He told me that
he passed on and came to say goodbye, he hugged me and then......I woke
up crying and totally out of myself cause my roomate came in the room saying
" What's happening??"...first thing out of my mouth was; Guy 's dead!.
Thinking it was just a dream I blew it off, took my plane and for 3 months
waited for Guy in montreal. he never came....Physically!</b>
<p><b>I learned in march of '98 that he died in the hospital...that January.
I remembered the dream and I was disrupt.I wondered what day did he actually
died,
if it was in any way possible that my dream was "real". Well, they say
that the dead hears your thoughts so I said to myself; o.k., let me know
the date!</b>
<p><b>Guy had a childhood friend, they were almost always together doing
mischief and such. We called him (still do) Blatz.By the way this one is
not a dream. Blatz got caught doing something not important to the story
in '96 and went to the pen(where he still is).We lost touch with Blatz
until one afternoon 4-5 months after Guy's death. a brithly sunny warm
day, another friend and I decided to go cruising on his motorbike.He put
his bike keys on the kitchen counter and we got ready boots, coats, gloves
and helmets. He then went to grab the keys but they were gone,he search
his pants and asked if I had taken them , I said "no". We looked for those
keys everywhere bathroom, livingroom etc. for 15-20 minutes then the phone
rang, I answered and it was a collect call from Blazt in jail. Really surprise,
I talked to him telling him he was lucky to get me as I was going out the
door.He then asked me if I had heard from Guy, I realised that he didn't
knew what happened to him, so knowing they were best friend I tried to
tell him in a gentle way that guy passed on that January. All the while
my friend is still searching for his keys. We talked for a little while
then hang up. As I turned to search those damn keys, my friend came out
the bathroom towards me, at the same time we looked at the counter and
saw the keys. He grabbbed them and said "hum...I'll wait for you outside!
At that time the only thing I could think of is "thanx for delaying me
so I can talk to Blazt. But now as I look back I think Guy just made sure
I told Blatz what happened to him.</b>
<p><b>I didn't dream of him until the next January 12, 1999. In my second
dream, we had fun like we used to, we laughed, he told me he loved me but
couldn't say it while he was alive. I woke up feeling good and wrote it
down. That's why I think that's the date he left.</b>
<p><b>Since then, I dreamed of him several times . I write each dream down
, it gives me something to hold on to. My father died in '95, I dream of
him but it's not the same feeling of reality, connection like he's not
really there. My father uses the lights in my mother's home to make himself
known.With Guy it's different, I can actually feel the closeness, a sense
of reality and when I wake up, I feel so peaceful.</b>
<p><b>Two days ago I dreamed of us together , really together. He was showing
me around and we were so happy we hugged, we kissed and when I woke up
I was rested, VERY happy *L* and just plain peacefull.</b>
<p><b>It's funny because I look at the occurences, he comes whenever I'm
feeling lonely, sad or blue. I'm still skeptical cause maibe it's just
my brain playing tricks on me or just attribuing feelings or values that
I define to be him....you know dreams!!!.....but somewhere deep down,something
tells me otherwise.</b>

<p><b>LIFE EXPERIENCES UNEXPLAINED</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: BohuShaman@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&nbsp; My first unexplained phenomena occurred in my early teens.
While boxing a</b>
<br><b>pole/playing in the basement of our new home, I started thinking
about my</b>
<br><b>grandfather who had recently passed away. I felt a tap on my shoulder
that</b>
<br><b>felt like someone was standing behind me. It was broad daylight
outside and</b>
<br><b>the sliding glass door in the basement illuminated the room. My
body filled</b>
<br><b>with chills and I ran upstairs frightened.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; At the age of 26 my family and I moved our ill grandmother
into our home to</b>
<br><b>care for her. She died several months later inside the house and
after her</b>
<br><b>death made her presence still known in spirit. I personally awoke
late one</b>
<br><b>evening to a bluish/white glow radiating my entire bedroom, cleansing</b>
<br><b>everything. Caught between sleep, but certainly awake, I could feel
her</b>
<br><b>hovered over the foot of my bed singing a song called, " Over The
Mountain."</b>
<br><b>A few days later my mother told me that grandma's spirit appeared
to her and</b>
<br><b>sang her the same song. My brother and his girlfriend also reported
hearing</b>
<br><b>noises many nights of someone running up and down the stairs late
at night.</b>
<br><b>Our grandmother was confined to a wheel chair during the late stages
of her</b>
<br><b>life.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; A couple of years later my eldest and closest Christian brother
passed on.</b>
<br><b>My current roommate also knew him and after our friends' passing,
several</b>
<br><b>poltergeist like occurrences occurred inside our apartment. Pictures
would</b>
<br><b>fall off the wall, books would fall off shelves, objects set sedentary
in one</b>
<br><b>room would be found laying on the floor in another room. Even items
stored</b>
<br><b>high in my bedroom closet would be found laying on the floor in
the</b>
<br><b>livingroom. One night when feeling really depressed about my life
and</b>
<br><b>circumstances, I prayed and asked my deceased Christian friend to
give me a</b>
<br><b>sign on what I have to do inorder to make my life better. I pleaded
for an</b>
<br><b>answer and upon waking up the next morning discovered all of my
religious</b>
<br><b>books slung three feet off its book shelf, onto the floor. All other</b>
<br><b>non-spiritual books on the same shelf didn't budge an inch.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; On top of these, I have always felt I could read peoples'
character and</b>
<br><b>sense what they are going through.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; One last incident, as a teenager&nbsp; while walking down
a sidewalk, I suddenly</b>
<br><b>pictured a waitresses' face in my mind. Someone who I haven't worked
with in</b>
<br><b>quite awhile. When I turned the corner 30 seconds later, she and
I bumped</b>
<br><b>into eachother.</b>

<p><b>South African haunting</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: natasjavanstaden@usa.net</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>"The experiences i am about to write about are true and did happen
to me.I am</b>
<br><b>now 24 and the starnge things started when i was about 13 or so
can't remember</b>
<br><b>the exact age. I'm living in South Africa and was living in a house
where</b>
<br><b>someone had died of sickness several years before (+- 10)</b>
<p><b>One night i was laying in my bed asleep and woke up and on the left
hand side</b>
<br><b>of my bed i saw two figures in monks clothing kneeling at my bed
. the were</b>
<br><b>dressed in black and where the faces were supposed to be the was
just a black</b>
<br><b>hole. I felt evil coming from them. then as i looked at the right
hand side of</b>
<br><b>my bed i saw the same apiration only this one had white clothes
and a string</b>
<br><b>yellow white light surrounding it. I felt save with this one (maybe
an agel?)</b>
<br><b>Anyway i felt the danger as if the balck one was goiung to take
me , then the</b>
<br><b>white one&nbsp; lifted up his arm and the black ones dissappeared
into smoke . i</b>
<br><b>looked at the white one again and it pointed to the end of my bed
and there</b>
<br><b>was the image well rahter it seemed like flesh and blood the devil
himself ...</b>
<br><b>red face but extremely ugly with a devious grin and horns on the
head(yes i</b>
<br><b>know it sounds so childish) Once again the white figure lifted it's
hand and</b>
<br><b>the image of the devil dissappeared. (all the time there was a light
shining</b>
<br><b>thru my&nbsp; door and the door was open) Eventually when the white
figure</b>
<br><b>disappeared as well i sprang up and switched on my light ..Guess
what my door</b>
<br><b>were closed and we had no hallway light and no other kights were
on in the</b>
<br><b>house. Since then i got this gift - I could see things in advance.
From then</b>
<br><b>i "saw" three people in our family die and one having a accident.;Can
someone</b>
<br><b>maybe give me some more information as what happend to me then?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Just a</b>
<br><b>further note i felt no coldness jut the feeling of evil coming from
the black</b>
<br><b>figures and peace and a feelling of safeness from the white figure.</b>
<br><b>"I'm 24 now and these things happend about two years ago.I don't
like</b>
<br><b>recalling this memories cause it was really a terrible time in my
life and</b>
<br><b>don't like a reminder of it but seeing that other people had the
same</b>
<br><b>experiences.&nbsp; We moved to a new appartment (two stories) At
first nothing was</b>
<br><b>wrong but about a month after we moved in i was ordered to bedrest
due to a</b>
<br><b>difficult pregnancy. I was about to deliver. I was laying on my
bed reading My</b>
<br><b>bed rest against the nothern wall and the footend of the bed facing
the</b>
<br><b>southern wall with the door southwest of the bed. It was quiet a
big room .. I</b>
<br><b>thought it was my husband who came home from luch , i saw a man
walking into</b>
<br><b>the room but then realized it wasn't hubby, the man walked from
the door in a</b>
<br><b>straight line right thru the eastern wall . i could see him clearly
,brown</b>
<br><b>hair , and a flower shirt and shorts and some running shoes. he
just looked</b>
<br><b>straight ahead and walked. I couldn't feel change in tempreture
and wasn't</b>
<br><b>afraid. Since then strange things happend. Doors would slamme close
and when i</b>
<br><b>have a look none of the doors are closed. After i delivered and
got back home</b>
<br><b>with the baby this got at it's peak . lightbulbs would fall out
if i would</b>
<br><b>switch on the lights, things would fall in the bathroom and kithcen
and then</b>
<br><b>hubby would investigate and nothing would be out of place. One night
i was in</b>
<br><b>the toilet coming out and then in the door a few cintimeters from
me he</b>
<br><b>*ghost/figure* stood then i felt cold gossebumps and my hair rising.
I</b>
<br><b>screamed and hubby appeared ofcourse he saw nothing. I once saw
him in my</b>
<br><b>little boys room since then my boy doesn't wanted to sleep in his
room. The</b>
<br><b>touch lamp would go on and of as if someone was playing with it.
i went and</b>
<br><b>did some investigating and found that the guy who lived there ten
years before</b>
<br><b>shot himself because his wife and small son left him*getting the
connection?*</b>
<br><b>I saw a picture of the man *My hubby are in the police force and
had access to</b>
<br><b>mortury archives* The apartment was renovated right before we moved
in and the</b>
<br><b>bullet hole where is bullet hitted the wall was sealed up. this
seemed to have</b>
<br><b>triggered it*could it be something else?* anyway the last few weeks
before the</b>
<br><b>house was blessed i felt the evil and rage against me growing .
i even lived</b>
<br><b>down stairs for a while using the neighbors bathroom*they thought
i was crazy*</b>
<br><b>well this is my story..</b>

<br><b>Ghost in the Closet</b>
<p><b>By: cbarker@seidata.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I grew up in a haunted house, living there for 21 years.&nbsp; This
story is about a friends house.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have always been sensitive
to ghosts andvery aware when one was around.&nbsp; my friend wanted to
give his sister a combination birthday/halloween party as they were both
on the same day.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; The main part of the party was to take place in the red room.&nbsp;
the room had red carpeting, red drapes and red fleur-de-lis flocked wallpaper.&nbsp;
The furniture was massive and dark I had always sensed something was in
the room but I had never actually seen anything.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was supposed to hide in the closet dressed like a
witch, and at the appropriate time jump out and scare his sister and her
friends, the minute I entered the closet, I knew I wasn't alone.&nbsp;
The temperature dropped by about 15 degrees, and I felt something touching
me.&nbsp; i must add here that the closet was, when I entered it totally
empty .&nbsp; Anyway, I jumped out and told mark something was in there.&nbsp;
He laughed and told me to get back in the closet that his sister would
come in in just a few minutes.&nbsp; Reluctantly, I went back inside.&nbsp;
No sooner had the door closed that I felt very depressed, it was suddden,
too sudden .&nbsp; I turned around and saw a man !</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The man had a flannel shirt,&nbsp; suspenders, red
hair and a rope suspended from the ceiling around his neck.</b>
<br><b>I of course jumped out of the closet.&nbsp; Mark was aggravated
that I hadn't stayed in the closet, but by then his sister , her friends
and a chaperone were almost in the room .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I babbled to
Mark about what I had seen.&nbsp; I noticed one chaperone, instead of laughing
looked scared.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; later, she told me that she had lived in the house
next door all her life and when she was a child, she remembered the man
who used to live in the house, 20 years prior to Mark's family moving in.&nbsp;
The man had red hairusually wore flannel shirts and suspenders,and had
hung himself in the closet!</b>

<p><b>Stories from a 300 Year Old House</b>
<p><b>By: anjalyn69@yahoo.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>For ten years my family and I lived in a three hundred year old farm</b>
<br><b>house. There were many paranormal incidents to happen to my friends
and</b>
<br><b>I. I remember once, it was Christmas Eve, I had awoke from my sleep.
Not</b>
<br><b>by a noise, I just happened to awake. In my room the bed faced the
door</b>
<br><b>which looked upon our stair well. As I lifted my head up I noticed</b>
<br><b>someone walking up our stairs. It wasn't anyone in my family because
none</b>
<br><b>of than let off an iridescent glow. As I watched with scared amassment,
I</b>
<br><b>noticed that this figure appeared to be of a young girl in her late
teens</b>
<br><b>early twenties. She proceeded up the stairs, only to stop and sit
on the</b>
<br><b>top step. There she sat and opined a book of some sort. This is
when she</b>
<br><b>turned to look at me. In hr eyes there was a look of anguish and
fear.</b>
<br><b>Out of fright I ducked under my covers and refused to poke my head
out</b>
<br><b>again. That was not the last Tim I witnessed a paranormal experience</b>
<br><b>first hand. In order to understand this story you have to understand
how</b>
<br><b>our house was set up. On the top floor there were four bedrooms
and a</b>
<br><b>full bathroom. If you were standing in the bathroom, from the door
it is</b>
<br><b>easy to see straight down the stairs and into our lower hallway

<p><b>IN 1995 MY BROTHER WAS INVOLVED IN A CAR ACCIDENT IN WHICH RESULTED
IN HIM BEING TAKEN TO THE WESTMEAD CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ,WHICH WAS ABOUT
2 HOURS DRIVE FROM US, IN ORDER TO HAVE MICRO SURGERY&nbsp; TO REPAIR HIS
HAND. MY MOTHER AND I GOT A LIFT WITH A FRIEND TO THE HOSPITAL SO WE COULD
BE WITH HIM WHEN HE WOKE UP FROM THE SURGERY. WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE HOSPITAL,
THE NURSE AT THE DESK SAID "YOUR MOTHER WAS JUST HERE ASKING ABOUT HER
GRANDSON". MY MOTHER JUST FROZE. "MY MOTHER", SHE ASKED. "YES", SAID THE
NURSE. "WHAT DID SHE LOOK LIKE", ASKED MY MOTHER, "SHE WAS RATHER PLUMP,
WITH TIGHT CURLY GREY HAIR AND SHE WAS WEARING A PINK DRESS WITH FLOWERS
ON IT" REPLIED THE NURSE. MY MUM JUST FELL INTO THE CHAIR. WHY YOU ASK?
HER MOTHER HAD DIED 6 YEARS BEFORE, AND WAS CREMATED IN A PINK DRESS WITH

<br><b>The Figure in the Window</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: Sport1183@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night me and four of my friends were out
driving around trying to</b>
<br><b>think of things to do on a Saturday night. When we started talking
about the</b>
<br><b>haunted houses that our known of in our town. When I remembered
hearing about</b>
<br><b>a House near mine that my english teacher told my class about...so
we decided</b>
<br><b>to drive past everybody got a eerie feeling. So we went and got
a camera to</b>
<br><b>take pictures of the house..when we got back to the house we made
up a plan</b>
<br><b>to go knock on the door. So me and one of my other friends knocked
and she</b>
<br><b>backed off. I tried looking in the door window but it had cloth
over it and</b>
<br><b>their was no door handle and it had a pad lock on it so there was
no way to</b>
<br><b>get in not even another door... There was only one window that wasnt
boarded</b>
<br><b>up on the lower level so I looked in and took some pictures while
my friends</b>
<br><b>stood back away from the house. Then they all said Dana Dana come
away</b>
<br><b>hurry...and I told them to shut up and stop trying to scare me then
I</b>
<br><b>happened to look up towards the upstairs window and someone or something
had</b>
<br><b>the curtain pulled back and was starring down at us (it looked like
a black</b>
<br><b>shadow)....we took off running to my car and drove off very fast..
Well the</b>
<br><b>next morning me and my brother went back...and the window on the
door was</b>
<br><b>wide open and you could see in the house perfectly fine..and the
curtains up</b>
<br><b>stairs were closed... we walked around the house a few more times
when I then</b>
<br><b>looked up and the figure was lookin down at us again...its a dark
shadow</b>
<br><b>looking figure pale almost not there it had wide open eyes and no
hair...my</b>
<br><b>brother snapped a picture and we ran....I told my neighbor and he
took us</b>
<br><b>back over there...and in the back of the house theres a old window
that was</b>
<br><b>covered with wood you could pull the wood away from the window and
look in</b>
<br><b>and there was a rope hanging from the pipes on the ceiling.....one
end with a</b>
<br><b>slipknot and the other with a sandbag..like someone had hung themself.
I'm</b>
<br><b>not sure what the whole story is but I know never to go back</b>

<p><b>Voices From the Linen Closet</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By:terryc@mega.net.au</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I HOPE YOU BELIEVE THIS STORY. IT HAPPENED TO MYSELF AND FAMILY (AND
STILL IS) ABOUT 5 YEARS AGO. WE LIVED IN A YOUNG HOUSE, ABOUT 15 YEARS
OLD IN SYDNEY AUSTRALIA, FROM THE DAY THAT WE MOVED IN IT JUST FELT STRANGE
TO ME AND MY MOTHER. THERE WAS ALWAYS A "COLD SPOT" JUST NEAR THE LINEN
CLOSET IN THE HALLWAY. A FOUL SMELL WOULD SOMETIMES BE SMELT ALONG WITH
THE COLD SPOT. ABOUT 5 MONTHS AFTER WE MOVED IN, WE WOULD HERE KNOCKING
ON THE INSIDE OF THE LINEN CLOSET, AND SOMETIMES WE COULD HEAR VERY FAINT
TALKING, BUT WE COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY WERE SAYING. THIS SCARED
THE HELL OUT OF US, AND WE CALLED UPON A LOCAL PRIEST IN ORDER TO TRY AND
FIND OUT WHAT THE HELL WAS IN OUR HOUSE. THE PRIEST CAME AND BLESSED THE
HOUSE AND WE HAD NO FURTHER TROUBLE FOR ABOUT 3 MONTHS. NOW THE STORY TAKES
A TURN FOR THE WORST. LATE ONE AFTERNOON, I WAS STANDING WITH MY MOTHER
IN FRONT OF THE LINEN CLOSET WHILE SHE WAS PUTTING AWAY SOME LINEN. ALL
OF A SUDDEN, WE WERE OVERCOME BY THE MOST FOUL SMELL THAT ALMOST MADE US
THROW UP. IT WAS COMING OUT OF THE LINEN CLOSET, AND WAS LIKE NO OTHER
SMELL WE HAD EVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE. THEN, WITHOUT WARNING, A HIGH PITCHED
VOICE SAID " GET OUT OF MY F****** HOUSE".</b>
<br><b>IT WAS THE VOICE OF AN OLD WOMAN, A VOICE THAT WE WILL NEVER FORGET.
WE JUST STOOD AT THE DOOR DUMBFOUNDED. OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR SO, WE CALLED
UPON EVERY PRIEST IN THE DISTRICT, NOTHING COULD GET RID OF IT. MUM PUT
THE HOUSE UP FOR SALE FOR $20,OOO LESS THAN SHE PAID FOR IT, AND WE HAD
ABOUT 3 PEOPLE LOOK AT IT OVER 6 MONTHS. THIS WAS A VERY GOOD SUBURB, AND
THERE WERE PEOPLE ACROSS THE STREET WITH THEIR HOUSE UP FOR SALE, AND THEY
HAD PEOPLE LOOK AT THEIR PROPERTY ALMOST EVERYDAY! THINGS GOT WORSE, ITEMS
WOULD MOVE AROUND THE HOUSE, THE TOILET WOULD FLUSH (WHEN WE WERE ALL WATCHING
TV) AND YOU COULD SOMETIMES SEE THINGS LEVITATING NEAR THE CEILING! THE
VOICE WOULD TALK ALL THE TIME, DOORS WOULD SLAM IN YOUR FACE, AND YOU ALWAYS
FELT AS IF SOMEONE WAS WATCHING YOU. OUR SMALL DOG WOULD NEVER GO INTO
THE HALLWAY, AND IF YOU PICKED HIM UP AND TOOK HIM IN THERE, HE WOULD SCRATCH,
BITE, AND BARK AT YOU IN ORDER TO TRY AND GET OUT OF YOUR ARMS. SOMETIMES,
YOU WOULD HEAR SOMEONE WHISPER IN YOUR EAR, AND TOUCH YOU, EVEN THOUGH
YOU KNEW THAT NO ONE WAS NEAR YOU! IN MY OPINION, THIS HOUSE WAS TRULY
EVIL, I WILL NEVER FORGET IT! THE THING THAT SCARED YOU THE MOST WAS THE
VOICE, IT WAS HIGH PITCHED, AND WAS NOT OF THIS WORLD. AFTER YEARS OF LIVING
THERE, WE FINALLY SOLD THE HOUSE AND MOVED, I REMEMBER THE NIGHT BEFORE
THE VOICE CALLED OUT "I'LL BE BACK". I NOW LIVE WITH MY BROTHER, MY MOTHER
AND SISTER LIVE ABOUT 40 MINUTES DRIVE FROM US, AND SO DOES THE GHOST.
IT FOLLOWED MUM WHEN SHE MOVED! ALTHOUGH NOTHING LIKE WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE
HAS EVER TAKEN PLACE AT MY MOTHERS, SOMETIMES SOME THINGS ARE SEEN MOVING
ABOUT LIKE, MUGS, AND SMALL ORNAMENTS. WE KNOW THAT IT IS THERE. WHEN EVER
I VISIT MY MOTHER I KNOW THAT THIS THING IS WATCHING ME, AND I NEVER STAY
LONG. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS, OR WHERE IT CAME FROM, BUT WE HAVE NO
DOUBT THAT IT IS EVIL. WE WILL NEVER FORGET THAT HOUSE FOR AS LONG AS WE
LIVE. I HOPE YOU BELIEVED THIS STORY. I AM THINKING OF WRITING A BOOK ABOUT
IT, DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY IDEAS?</b>
<br><b>FOOTNOTE: OVER THE PAST 4 YEARS, THERE HAVE BEEN ABOUT 6 DIFFERENT
FAMILY'S WHO HAVE LIVED AT THE OLD HOUSE, NONE HAVE STAYED LONGER THAN
12 MONTHS, I WONDER WHY!</b>

<br><b>Snooch...</b>
<p><b>By: GibbsZT@SUPSHIP.NAVY.MIL</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Snooch was the family nickname for my great-grandfather, he died
in Nov 90.</b>
<br><b>At the time I was in tech school (military), it was the last week,
I had</b>
<br><b>finished all my training and was waiting to ship out.&nbsp; My friends
and I had</b>
<br><b>planned to spend four more days together in Florida.&nbsp; The two
nights before</b>
<br><b>we were to be released I dreamt about Snooch, he looked good...like
I</b>
<br><b>remember him when I was younger, he had been in the hospital when
I left for</b>
<br><b>basic training so did not look good the last time I saw him in the
flesh.</b>
<br><b>We were standing across from one another and I remember feeling
so good, so</b>
<br><b>loved, so light in spirit...I'm rambling but I want you to understand
the</b>
<br><b>great peace and serenity I felt.&nbsp; Snooch said that he wanted
to see me, that</b>
<br><b>he wanted me to know that he loved me very much and that he was
so proud of</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; I remember smiling and reaching for him and he said Baby
I have to go</b>
<br><b>but remember that I love you always.&nbsp; I had not told my Mother
about my</b>
<br><b>plans with my friends so the day I was released I called and told
her we</b>
<br><b>were on our way to Florida, she said that she needed me to come
home.&nbsp; Being</b>
<br><b>the headstrong person that I am I needed her to tell me why ...she
said that</b>
<br><b>they had not told me but Snooch had died two days before and they
had held</b>
<br><b>off on the funeral until I got there.&nbsp; That's when the enormity
of my dream</b>
<br><b>hit me I told her that Snooch had come to me to say Good-bye, I
told her the</b>
<br><b>dream and she just cried because she said that he asked her about
me the</b>
<br><b>same night he passed away.&nbsp; Needless to say I got that night
and the funeral</b>
<br><b>was held the next day.&nbsp; The story still does not end there,
I chose to wear</b>
<br><b>my uniform so that Snooch could "see" me in it and the suit he was
buried in</b>
<br><b>was the same suit that he had come to me wearing, a light gray suit
that as</b>
<br><b>always was just a little to big for him.</b>

<p><b>3 Experiences</b>
<p><b>By: jrspano@groupz.net</b>
<p><b>Hello I was reading some of your stories and thought I would send
you some of mine.&nbsp; I have three of them with only one of them being
comfirmed because it happened to me.&nbsp; One night i was sitting in the
office of my house on my computer.&nbsp; Directly behind me there is an
old office chair made of wood with metal joints that creaks often when
you sit on it or move around on it.&nbsp; This night while I was on the
computer the chair creaked for a split second.&nbsp; I turned around and
the chair back was toward me so if any one was sitting on it their back
would be to my back.&nbsp; It happeded again and I looked and the chair
was unmoved.&nbsp; When It happened the third time it was louder and longer.&nbsp;
When I turned around this time the chair was turned around like some one
was sitting on it and watching me.&nbsp; Needless to say I turned the computer
off and went to bed.&nbsp; One other thing that has happeded in the house
concernes our dog.&nbsp; My bedroom is at the end of a hallway.&nbsp; At
night I lock the dog in the room with me with a plastic see through baby
fence so he won't mess in the house.&nbsp; Some times he stares down the
halway and barks at something I can't see.&nbsp; The house is only about
25 years old and as far as I know nothing has happened in the house bad
or any deaths.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two stories I can't confirm are with my brother
and one of my dad's friends.&nbsp; One day my mom and my little brother(about
4 or 5) were in the car driving.&nbsp; He looked over at a graveyard on
the highway and said "Look at all the people mom."&nbsp; When she looked
there wasn't anyone there.&nbsp; My dad's friend that he works with says
he lives in a haunted house.&nbsp; The only thing the ghost does though
is take drinking glasses up to the attic and stacks them up into piles.&nbsp;
I don't think that they have ever seen or heard the ghost.</b>

<p><b>His Aunt's Goodbye</b>
<p><b>By: gayle_ferguson@hotmail.com</b>
<p><b>My mother told me a story about what had happened to my father when
he was</b>
<br><b>just a young man. He was born in 1908 in Missouri. She told me that</b>
<br><b>neighbors and family had come to my great-aunt's house to sit with
her</b>
<br><b>because she was treminally ill. In those days, that was what was
done in</b>
<br><b>the rural communities as hospitals stays were out of the question.
It was in</b>
<br><b>the wee hours of the morning when three of the men decided to go
out side to</b>
<br><b>have a smoke. Since it was summer it was cooler outside than inside.
As</b>
<br><b>they were talking, their attention was drawn to one corner of the
house where</b>
<br><b>the rainbarrel stood. A mist started rising out of the barrel and
took on the</b>
<br><b>transparent form of my Dad's aunt. The men hurried inside to tell
everyone</b>
<br><b>what they had seen. They were met inside with the news that his
aunt had</b>
<br><b>just passed away. She must have appeared outside as her way of saying</b>
<br><b>goodbye to those now in the room with her. I have other stories
to tell,</b>
<br><b>but they can wait till another time.</b>

<br><b>My Daughter's Deceased Siamese Cat</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: alan@quest-net.com</b>
<p><b>Just to let you know I've always believed in ghosts and</b>
<br><b>ghost stories - my mother lived in a haunted house in</b>
<br><b>Philadelphia.&nbsp; But this past September I agreed to house and</b>
<br><b>cat sit for my daughter while she was in Ireland helping</b>
<br><b>people at a new company for her employer for a month.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>has a lovely older cat named E.T. after the</b>
<br><b>extra-terrestrial in the movie - he's an orange and</b>
<br><b>delightful, about 13 years old.</b>
<br><b>E.T. is used to sleeping next to me against the other pillow</b>
<br><b>on my daughter's double bed.&nbsp; About the second week I was</b>
<br><b>staying there I finally realized the pounce that ET makes to</b>
<br><b>get up on the bed after I'm in it, and the footfalls</b>
<br><b>crossing over me and coming up to the pillow weren't E.T...</b>
<br><b>It was when I reached out from under the covers to pet him</b>
<br><b>and there wasn't anything there that I finally opened my</b>
<br><b>eyes and looked - to see Egypt, Debbi's deceased Siamese cat</b>
<br><b>retreating to the foot of the bed - only I could see right</b>
<br><b>through her.&nbsp; ET, I discovered later, slept at the foot of</b>
<br><b>the bed when Egypt was around and sleeping next to me!&nbsp; When</b>
<br><b>I told Debbi about this, she confirmed that Egypt often came</b>
<br><b>to her at night too, and she was surprised to learn that her</b>
<br><b>former pet had also visited me.</b>
<br><b>This was the first time I was even aware that there were</b>
<br><b>also animal ghosts.&nbsp; I've always welcomed and communicated</b>
<br><b>easily with animals, although I have no pets of my own at</b>
<br><b>present.&nbsp; This may be why it was easy for Egypt to contact</b>
<br><b>me and let me see her!</b>
