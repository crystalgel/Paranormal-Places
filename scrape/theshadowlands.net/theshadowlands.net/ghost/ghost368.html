<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: sawdon65@yahoo.com <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We bought my father-in-laws
house with the understanding that he was to stay with us so we could take care
of him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was in his mid 70's and not
in the best of health.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Before we moved in we turned
the 2 upstairs bedrooms into 3 bedrooms.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My husband was upstairs taking the panels off the walls and called me upstairs
to figure out how and where to move the heating duct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as I got to the top of the stairs my
husband hung his hammer on a nail that was sticking out of a stud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were standing right next to that stud the
whole time I was upstairs with him. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>We
were the only two upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we were
finished talking he went to grab for his hammer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was no longer hanging on the stud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We looked for it for about 15 minutes before
finding it under a pile of panels about 10 feet away from the stud it was hung
on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We just gave each other a raised
eyebrow look and didnt say anything about it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The TV would always turn off
and on by itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was my
father-in-laws TV that sat in the livingroom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was the only TV in the house that did that no matter what outlet it
was plugged into.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would turn it off
and by the time I would walk into the kitchen it would be on again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would have to say something like "I
dont have time to play right now" before it would finally stop.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I was at work the night my
father-in-law passed away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="3"><span style="font-family: Arial;">3 am</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;"> on a Monday morning when one of the high low drivers
broke a main water line that caused all the presses to be shut down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd been working there for 2 years and had
never seen or heard of all the press operators being sent home as there is
always something else for us to do, rework, cleaning...<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I went straight home and
straight into my father-in-laws room to check on him and tell him what
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had a close bond and talked
about everything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His estimated time of death was </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="3"><span style="font-family: Arial;">3am</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may have
been a coincidence, but MAN, what a coincidence!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After my father-in-law
passed away I experienced only one more thing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was up in my room and heard my son call me from the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was at the top of the stairs and he was at
the bottom of the stairs when we met up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He asked me what I wanted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
asked him what he meant because I heard HIM call ME.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He just shook his head and said "Oh, not
this again."<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I came home from work early
again one night, about a month after my father-in-law had passed away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I walked into my sons room to see if he was
home yet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was laying in his bed with
the blankets over his head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My son was
18 at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I whispered "Are
you still awake?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He popped his
head out from under his blanket and told me he heard footsteps in his room just
a few minutes before I got home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Could
have been the cat, I told him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nope,
definately human he said, but when he looked to see who it was there was nobody
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My oldest daughter heard me and
her brother talking downstairs and came down.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She told me about an hour before I got home she thought she heard
someone walking around downstairs, she thought it was her brother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She heard footsteps from his room to the
bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She went downstairs and peaked
her head in his room, not in there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
walked to the bathroom but the door was standing open so she knew he wasnt in
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was spooked so she went
upstairs and didnt come back down until I got home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We moved to a big old farm
house in 2004.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

clean the room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Although there was a

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My own personal experience
is i was in a home/shelter a few years ago and on the second floor is where i
slept.Well i was lonely and couldnt sleep so i decided to stare out of my
window.I was at first looking at the tall buildings of tulsa being lit up and
beautiful,but then discovered someone walking across the basketball court.I
thought it was someone who had exscaped and there are two buildings cornered
from each other and the court was in between.This person who looked like a girl
was wearing a white night gown and looked like she was floating.Well she went
down some stairs as i watched her in fear she turned towards a door and
disapeared,The door never opened she just went right through it! It was so
scary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Timothy Dalton<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Earlier this year I attended a camp in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Rabun County</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">GA.</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> There I was told the story of Timothy Dalton. The
story is that in the late 70's, the Daltons lived in a rural area of Habersham
County, GA. Supposedly Timothy was about eleven years old, an only child, and
his parents didn't really like him. They abused him in every way possible and
kept him in the basement due to them not thinking he was worthy of a room
upstairs. This wasn't even really a basement more just like a cellar with one
small window that was about 2 feet in length and half a foot up. Mr. Dalton's
wood workshop was down there so at night Timothy would work on whatever he
could. His father didn't quit mind him working with his wood because his father
would take what ever Timothy made and sell it with out giving Timothy any of
the money. Well, one day Timothy was at home alone weeding the field when the postman
came. His parents had gone off into the next city over to get supplies for the
upcoming fall. Now, Timothy knew that there was such a thing as mail but since
his parents didn't tell him where it came from and neglected to send him to
school he never knew what it honestly looked like. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The postman approached
Timothy and asked him if his father was around. When Timothy answered no the
postman handed over a package, he had never ever seen a package before and was
informed not to open it or even shake it. It was his fathers and not his.
Timothy went inside the house and set the package down on the kitchen table. He
couldn't stop thinking about it so he opened and made sure that he could seal
it again. Around this time power tools started to come out and Timothy's father
figured that he should have one since he does work on wood sometimes. Timothy
saw that it was a power drill and was in awe. He couldn't wait until that night
to start to make something. So, for the rest of the day he just went around and
collected logs and sticks so that he could make something. Once he found them
he set them by the window and at night would open it and pull them in. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">That night once his parents
locked him down in the basement, he started to work. He worked and worked for
about three hours until he came up with this beautiful rocking chair. He had
never seen something this beautiful and never been this happy about something
like this. So every night threw the summer and the fall he would sit and rock
in it until he would fall asleep. Well, a horrible blizzard blew threw and it
was a horrible site. All the crops of Habersham had died and nothing was left
of them. So one day Mr. Dalton told Timothy to go and find fire wood for the
fireplace since they didn't have electric heating. Timothy knew that all the
fire wood would be wet but decided not to fight with his father. After about
two hours Timothy had found some dry pieces to possibly hold them over for the
night. So he turned back and started to walk back towards the house. As he
approached the end of the woods he noticed that there was smoke coming out of
the fireplace. He found this very odd and didn't quit know why his father would
send him out to find firewood if he already had some. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">So Timothy walked into the
house and as soon as he walked in he was horrified. He saw his rocking chair,
the only thing he had ever been proud of, chopped up in the fireplace burning
to little bits. Timothy snapped.that's all to say. He didn't start to yell at
his dad or anything. He just mentally snapped. So he sat down the fire wood and
did his chores. Before he was locked down in the basement he managed to sneak
some chicken wire under his shirt. So he took it down to the basement and was
locked in there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After about an house he knew
that his mom and dad had just turned off the light to go to bed and he go to
work. After maybe three hours he had constructed this power drill into this
killing machine. He had found an Exacto Knife and bound it to the power drill
so that when the turned the trigger on it would spin around and around. So he
used some chicken wire to unlock himself and walked up the stairs to his
parent's room. He slowly bound his parent's hands and feet to the bed post and
foot board. It took him about an hour just to do this without either of them
stirring. So once that was done he just stood over his father staring him dead
in the eye with his hand and power drill behind his back. As soon as his father
awoke he started yelling at Timothy calling him a freak and wondering what he was
doing there. So Timothy didn't do anything just pulled out the power drill and
jammed it straight into his father's heart and turned it on. His mother was
screaming bloody murder. So he pulled it out of his father and slowly walked
around the other side to his mom. She was crying and was in hysterics Timothy
looked at her then revved the power drill once and shoved it straight into her
neck. He just dropped everything didn't wash his hands didn't even try to clean
up. He didn't care if he was caught all he cared about was that rocking chair.
So he went over to the fireplace and sat down in front of it and stared into it
for three days until the police got suspicious and noticed that they hadn't
seen them for a while. When they came to the house they didn't even have to ask
any questions they knew what had happened. So they admitted Timothy into the
Habersham Psyche Ward where he stayed until the late 90's when he escaped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Now, you need to know that
to know this strange experience that happened to me. When I was with my camp
our cabin of twenty boys and girls were on a bus headed to Helen to go tubing
on the Hooch. It was really rainy so they didn't want us going in the water so
they took us to go bowling in </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;">Habersham</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;">County</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">. The night before we had hiked up </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;">Blood</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;">Mountain</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> and was told that story. So we were all pretty
freaked out. Well, me and my friend Kelly and her boyfriend Jake decided to go
walk around the bowling building since a lot of the counselors already were
back there. So as we're walking back there, there was an old man with slightly
grayish hair standing out there smoking. We had been informed that if you see
anyone outside of camp that you kindly say hello, don't say your name, and only
tell where you're from (camp wise).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
man did what any other person would do ask us our names. We sat down on a curb
that was parallel to him but the length of a car away from him. We told him
that we were from CHH Lake Burton and that we were here with a camp.
"Well, that still doesn't answer my question." He said. Kelly spoke
up," I'm sorry sir but we're not allowed to tell you our names." He
looked at her and laughed a little," Well, Kelly, my name is Tim." We
were all completely shocked and confused. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">"How do you know our
names?" I asked. He laughed again and put out his cigarette. "Let's
just say that I know a lot of things. Habersham is a very quiet town and as of
last night for you guys it was a very innocent town too." We were all in
shock and awe. How did he know that we knew about the murders? We all got
spooked and Jack led the way back round the building. But every crazy person
has some parting words," Just remember this," he said to us as we all
halted to stop, "I wouldn't have had to kill him if he just kept his eye's
closed." To this day it still haunts me, the wheezing laugh of that man
and the wondering of the story. Is it honestly true?<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Wake Up<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In my former residence where
myself, my husband and my teenage son lived, there were lots of paranormal
happenings. All three of us experienced strange things. But the one that was
the most bizarre happened while I was asleep in my bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband had gone away on business for few
days, so I was alone this particuliar night. My son was asleep in his room down
the hall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I owned a large male cat
named Bing. Who almost always spent the night on my bed. I also had a hampster
that was kept in a cage in my son's bedroom. The cage door was broken so we
tied it up with baggie ties. She had escaped once or twice, so I had planned on
buying a new cage the next day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As I lay sleeping in my bed,
I can remember hearing someone yelling in my ear"WAKE UP" several
times. I then found myself standing in the hallway and to my disbelief, my cat
had the hampster cornered and was about to pounce. I screamed for my son and he
came to the rescue before anything could happen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Someone had made sure that I
would wake up in time that's for sure. I know I heard those words "WAKE
UP", repeated several times.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I was not terribly afraid at
that time because, I figured that this entity had to be friendly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A few weeks ago, my
grandparents and I went to a Mormon pioneer cemetery a few miles from where I
live to get a picture of an ancestor's gravestone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While driving into the cemetery, I noticed a
particularly tall gravestone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as
I saw it, I got the chills.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Normally, I
am not scared of cemeteries or things like that, at least not in the day
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we left the cemetery, my
grandmother pointed out the creepy head stone<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She said it was her grandaunt grave, and that this lady had crossed the
plains to come to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Utah</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;"> when she was about 8. She later went north to help
settle the town of </span><st1:City><st1:place><st1:PersonName><span style="font-family: Arial;">Rich</span></st1:PersonName><span style="font-family: Arial;">mond</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Utah</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then grandma
told me the following story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When my aunt Andrea was
about 15, she was home alone in the kitchen, right after school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She heard a womans voice and turned around.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>She saw an elderly lady in a long,
old-fashioned style dress with her hair in a bun. Andrea ran out of the house
and to a neighbors, where she called my grandmother at work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Grandma thought she was just trying to get
attention, but told her she could stay with the neighbors until she got home
from work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same thing happened twice
more over the next two weeks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My grandma
requested a picture of a great-aunt from my great-grandmother, so she could
copy it and hang it up on the mantle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was lying on the counter the next day when Andrea came home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as she saw the picture, she
jumped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She asked grandma who it was of,
then told her it was the ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Andrea
never saw the women again, but says it wasn't scary. More like a lady that
wanted to help.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I am a 16-year-old boy from
a small city called </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Malden</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Massachusetts</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">. My parents moved into my house when I was only a
few months old. Now the story behind my house, is that it is quite old, and
belonged to my great grandparents, my mother's grandparents. They lived here
for MANY years, my great grandparents moved in when they were young newlyweds;
they had a number of children, and were quite happy living in this house. My
great grandmother or "Great Grammy" as we called her, died at a
fairly young age due to heavy smoking; I sadly never had the pleasure of
meeting her myself, as she had died many years before I was in the picture.
With his wife gone, my great grandfather lived in this home all by himself,
until he grew to old and could no longer care for himself, so he entered a
nursing home. When he left the house, and we moved in, we kept things how they
were for a number of years, but eventually my mother began to do some
renovations to the house, little things here and there. Then when I was around
9 or years old and some discussion of remodeling the kitchen (which had been unchanged
since the house was built) some strange things started happening. It began
small, my mother, my father, my older sister and I would be sitting at the
kitchen table having dinner, and a plate that was sitting in a rack drying off
(we had no dishwasher at this point) would randomly fall over. No one really
thought anything of it because it only happened roughly once a week. But after
about 3 weeks it began to happen more frequently, no one really had any idea
what was going on when one night after it happened my father said to us, &#8220; Hey,
Maybe it&#8217;s Great Grammy paying us a visit.&#8221; We all laughed it off, but then the
next day after the plate tipped over, the door to the basement (located in the
kitchen) popped open then suddenly slammed shut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this point we all began to reconsider
the statement about the possible visits from great grammy. Soon the tipping of
the plate, and the movements of the basement door were happening every night,
and it occurred only during our dinner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We all believed it was great
grammy, so every night after the &#8220;show&#8221; my mother would say, &#8220;Oh, Hey Gram&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">very kindly. One night,
after the visit, my sister asked my mother, &#8220;Hey mom, why is she visiting us?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">and my father replied, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know, maybe she is just looking for Great Grampy&#8221;. We grew very used to
these visits as they happened every night, and one night before dinner, I was
in the basement searching for a bottle of soda, our basement is not finished,
the floor is half concrete and half dirt, but there is a refrigerator down
there for extra storage in case the one in the kitchen fills up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyhow, I was down in my basement and as I
rummaged through the fridge I felt a little strange. I backed away from the
fridge and looked down to the other end of the basement, I thought I saw
something colored gray and white, but it had disappeared within about 2 seconds
of my seeing it, I figured I was seeing things. I called up to my mother whom
was in the kitchen, cooking dinner &#8220;Mom! I think I someone is down here!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;WHAT?&#8221; she cried nervously, &#8220;Yeah, I saw
something but it disappeared.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I yelled up. She then
replied with a giggle, &#8220; Oh, It&#8217;s Just Grammy&#8221;. Now I was quite scared, even If
I was just seeing things. I quickly went back to the fridge, grabbed a bottle
of Pepsi and closed the door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I was heading for the stairs, and I stopped
and took another look, I saw nothing to my disappointment, but I turned back
toward to the stairs when I heard a deep sigh coming from directly behind me. I
quickly spun around, but saw no one. I thought to myself, it&#8217;s just grammy,
it&#8217;s just grammy, say hello to her. I was very scared and I said out loud, &#8220;
H&#8230;Hel&#8230;.Hello Grammy.&#8221; I heard nothing, but there was a thud from a little ways
into the basement and an old scratched up baseball rolled into my path. I began
to shiver in fear; I quickly walked over to the ball and picked it up. It felt
peculiarly warm for something sitting on a cold dirt floor for god knows how
many years. I took my soda and the ball and I ran back upstairs. We had dinner
and the usual plate tip and door actions took place. I showed the ball to my
father and he was inspecting it and he said, &#8220; WOW! Take a look at this!&#8221; he
held the ball to my face and in blue ink scratched in the bottom and slightly
worn away was the name &#8220;Wesley&#8221; which was the name of my great grandfather.
Then the night soon came to an end. The next day was my grandfathers 93rd
birthday, and the entire family was going to visit him in the nursing home.
They had put pictures taken all during his life up on the walls of the room
that we were having the party in. My father was with me as I looked at the
pictures, there was one of him and my great grandmother and she was wearing a
large white sweater, and next to it was another picture of my great grandfather
standing in my backyard, with a baseball bat in his right hand and a baseball
in his left. I felt very strange seeing as how I think I had that very same
ball, so I decided to stop looking at pictures and get back to the party. 2
days later my great Grandfather died peacefully in his sleep. He was buried
with his wife, and the very day he was buried the actions with the plate
tipping and the basement door opening and slamming stopped completely. We never
heard from her again. I believe she was simply lonely and searching for her
husband, when they were reunited, she could finally rest in peace. I am now 16
years old, and I have never had another ghost experience, but I still get a
shiver when I enter my basement, and I have kept the ball in my room since the
very day I found it. Until the day I die I will remember my experience with The
Ghost of &#8220;Great<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I write to tell you of a
site which will stay with me for life. my friend and I where returning from a
duck hunting trip in Dunmrry when we decided to have a look in the river to
check for ducks on the of chance of a last crack before we crossed the fields
to home. we made are way across the M1 motorway at Dunmurry,shush tad illegal,
and when climbing the bank on are homeward we loaded are guns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I put my last shell up the spout I
noticed a tall light tan coloured figure of to my right it seemed to be about
7ft tall and of the ground by about 2ft, this scared the xxxx out of me I couldn't
speak to warn my mate all I could do was brush his shoulder as he stride closer
to it, but it was enough to turn him round his first words where what the fxxxs
wrong with you, I could only motion my eyes towards it and when he turned he
started backing up asking what in goodness names that, well words to that
effect. first instinct was to point our guns at it but I urged him not to fire
encase we only angered it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember
saying don't run just back up slowly and walk away, I was afraid in case he could
out run me, this we did for about five paces and my so called mate was off with
me hot on his heels, turned out he had ask me to wait for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This happened about 14 years ago and neither
of us went hunting at night again. Iasked him later why he asked or how he new
to ask what was wrong with me, he said it was the shear look of terror on my
face. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I told a friend of mine this
story only yesterday and he explained that a figure not unlike a monk had been
reported on the motorway from as far back as thirty years ago, wish sum1 coulda
told me<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My name is Josh and I am new
to the experience of the phenomenon, but have always been interested in the
paranormal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So then it is no shock to me
when things happen that you cannot explain.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My experience actually took place last night (9-16-05) as I was online
late doing research....It was in the 2nd bedroom that I use as a computer
room....I remember having the feeling that I was being watched...so I checked
the windows and saw nothing, so I sat back down.....moments later...the feeling
returned but it seemed that it was more intense..like something was there with
me....My heartbeat a little elevated...I continued to work...knowing that this
was't my mind playing tricks on me......it was when I felt it move from my neck
to my shoulder that brought me out of my chair....I spun around only to find
the room much darker than I remember and feeling a great pressure inside my
head and very confused....moments later it was gone and everything was
normal....I live in a 2 bedroom duplex, and have always suspected of having
"house guests"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>or the
possibility of something else residing in the same dwelling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Things have happened that you can't explain
away as the house settling, or bad plumbing....things move from where you put
them that you swear w e there a minute ago.......doors open and close in the
night....things fall that shouldn't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
have been co-existing with my "house mate" without contact..until
last night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My husband and I had a
couple of strange experiences on the Queen Mary in July of 2005.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our first night staying on the ship was
fairly uneventful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We enjoyed the
ambience, but were a little disappointed that nothing "ghostly"
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On our last night we were with
a friend who lived in the area and had come to the ship to meet us. Both my
husband and his friend had worked on the ship in the A/V department about
twenty years prior to our present visit. We were heading to our cabin to pick
up a camera for a ghost hunting expedition,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>my husband in the lead, Julie and me following.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just as Julie passed<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a set of open fire doors in the corridor, one
of the doors slammed shut, hitting her in the back and then opened again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon retrieving the camera, we continued our
unauthorized tour of the ship, looking for more spirits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing more occured and Julie finally had to
go home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We passed a peaceful
night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next morning we were leaving
the ship to head home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had put on a
new halter blouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My neck soon became
irritated by the knot of the top.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I kept
pulling it away from my neck, but kept it securely tied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While we were going down the elevator to the
dock, my husband and I were the only ones in the elevator and he was standing
facing me, I felt a tickle at my neck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
reached up to see what the tickle was and found the knot was untied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband said it was a friendly ghost as it
seemed it know how much discomfort I was feeling from the knot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If nothing else, it was a helpful
spirit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: nechigrrl@yahoo.ca.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have been reading many of
the stories with great interest, and feel compelled to share two experiences.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Before I continue, I must
say that this is an excellent site! I am part Native, and part White; my mom is
Cree and my dad is German. Much of the traditional teachings I received with
regards to spirits are very similar to the information on this site. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The first and scary
experience happened almost 20 years ago. I was in college, and not getting
along with my parents, so I moved out. I ended up moving in with a roommate
into a small 2 bedroom bungalow in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Kamloops</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">British Columbia</span></st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:country-region><span style="font-family: Arial;">Canada</span></st1:country-region></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">. This bungalow was a little dilapidated but it was within in my meagre
student budget. I always felt 'creeped out' in the house at night, like there
was something watching - something not all that friendly. About a month or two
after I moved in, my roommate informed me that there was a small, old graveyard
across the road, hidden behind a tangle of brush and weeds. EWWWWW! One night,
my roommate, a friend and I were playing cards. My roommate looked at me and
said out of the blue (no previous mention of ghosts), "Do you ever get the
feeling this place is haunted, like you're being watched?" I immediately
and emphatically said, "YES!!!" I never noticed physical
manifestations like objects moving, taps turning on, or lights flashing, but
just an overwhelming creepy feeling of being watched. I would run from the
bathroom to my bedroom at night as though I was chased by hell hounds. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Well, one night during the
winter I was in my bedroom with a candle lit, trying to figure my life out. The
window was shut and my bedroom door was closed. The candle did not flicker or
waver like flames do when there is a breeze; the candle simply went out, as
though extinguished by someone or something. Well, this spooked me, to say the
least. So, I turned on my bedside light. The bulb make a 'pop' noise that bulbs
make when they burn out. There I was, sitting in the dark and extremely
agitated; I needed to get out of my room immediately. I tried to open my door
and the doorknob came off in my hand! The terror rose exponentially at that
point. My bedroom door wasn't a regular inside-the-house kind of door, but it
had a window in it, like an older kitchen door. I had hung a little curtain
over the pane for privacy. Without even thinking - like an instinctive response
- I smashed my fist through the pane of glass to be able to reach down and open
the door from the outside. I bolted from my room and fled to a friend's house. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Very soon after that, I
reluctantly moved home. I sure wasn't going to live in that little creep-fest
hovel anymore!! I suppose one could explain some of that night away given that
the house was old and in not very good shape. So, it's not surprising that the
door knob came off in my hand; I'm was in such a state of terror that I
probably used a little too much force trying to open the door. And, being a
student on a limited income, many of my belongings (including my bedside light)
were second-hand, so malfunctions wouldn't be that unlikely. But, the series of
events - candle, light, door knob - and the absolute terror convinced me that
there was a nasty spirit there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">More than ten years after
that, I was living in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Vancouver</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">British Columbia</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> when I had another experience that was not at all
frightening. I was living in an apartment with a roommate and two cats. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After a while, we both
noticed that there seemed to be a third cat living with us - a cat you could
feel but not see. Either one of us would be doing the dishes and feel a cat
brush up against our legs but see nothing there. Or, one of us would be working
on the computer and feel the cat's tail brush against our legs as it apparently
walked under the chair, but see nothing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The other two cats seemed
completely at ease with this. I had cats before as a child, but that had been
quite a few years before these occurrences. I had no idea who or what this
spirit was, or why it suddenly moved in with us. We were never frightened by
this, but I decided to 'smudge' the apartment anyway; 'smudging' is a
traditional cleansing ceremony that includes burning sage and prayer to the
Creator (known as God in the Christian faith). The cat spirit left and I have
never felt it again. I have had other experiences with people and pets passing
on, as well as some premonitions, but I will save them for another time. Be
well. All my relations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I,m a big believer of ghosts
but when you see or experience<span style="">&nbsp; </span>things
that you really know can,t be ,you start to think its all in your head.I have
lived in the same place for 5 years now and I,m not sure but I think we have
some sort of entity.Well I have a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>6,13
and 14 year old but for some reason my 6 year old and I are the only ones that
have had things happen to us.When my daughter was about 4,we were sitting
around watching TV I just happen to look at her (sitting on the floor) she
looked like she was following someone cross the floor in front of her and walk
down our hall.She says to me "mommy who's that man" I told her that I
didn't see a man and she informs that she did.I on the other hand am not liked
very much I don't think cause it locks me out of the house,I know what your thinking
but I have even changed the locks thinking the doorknob was the problem but it
didn't help, it cant be the kids either cause it happens when they are not home
as well. The first time it happened it was 10:30 at night and about - 30 F I
let our dog out to do her thing and shut the door then went to open it and it
was locked thinking now what do I do I started bagging on it in hopes one of
the kids will wake up to let me in. After about 20 min they did and let me in,
it has happened a few more times. Now I don't EVER shut the door when I go out
for a sec but it still locks on me, I just laugh and say you didn't get me.I
also saw something I cant explain, the kid got up before I did one Saturday
morning and they were in the living room watching TV .I got up<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and walked down the hall to the living room
the kids were standing at the entrance to the living room ,(I swear I was wide
awake) I saw this red T shirt (at least that's what my brain registered)
standing next to my kids then walk into the other room by the front door.I
asked the kids who was here they looked at me like I had finally lost my mind
and said no one,I know I saw it so I went to look who was here and I didn't
find anyone and the front door didn't open either.So that's my story and I
swear its true.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When I was 11 years old I
lived with my mom, my sister and my uncle </span><st1:PersonName><span style="font-family: Arial;">Rich</span></st1:PersonName><span style="font-family: Arial;">ard (Who was only 26) in my grandparents house. My sister and I shared a
room upstairs between my uncle's room and my grandparents room and my mom had
the basement to herself. One day I faked sick because I didn't want to go to
school, what a big mistake that was. My uncle </span><st1:PersonName><span style="font-family: Arial;">Rich</span></st1:PersonName><span style="font-family: Arial;">ard came home that day, complained of breathing problems and died in our
upstairs bathroom that we shared with him. I was hiding behind the door in my
room and my grandmother was downstairs in the living room (She has MS and
cannot walk) I saw everything, the paramedics eventually saw me and made me go
downstairs. When they took him out he was blue and his arms were hanging down.
It was very traumatizing and I think that experience of seeing him die was what
opened the door to everything I experience now. Anyways, the morning after he
died we all got up and had breakfast together, my grandfather asked if anyone
had taken a shower around </span><st1:time minute="30" hour="6"><span style="font-family: Arial;">6:30 am</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;">. No one did, but we all heard the shower running. </span><st1:time minute="30" hour="18"><span style="font-family: Arial;">6:30</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;"> was around the time my uncle would have been getting
ready for work. After that nothing really happened for a while until they
cleaned out his room, which was a couple of months. I decided I wanted to have
his old room so I moved all of my stuff in there and then weird things started
happening. Anyone who knew my uncle would tell you that he was a prankster. He
loved to play tricks on people and I think that's what he was doing to me. It
was always freezing cold in my room, the power would go out just in that room,
my clock was never right no matter how many times I set it and the curtains
would open by themselves in the middle of the night. It frightened me at first
but then I realized he was just him trying to play tricks on me, eventually I
found it comforting and enjoyed when those things would happen because I knew
it was him and I would talk to him and tell him how much I missed him. One time
when I was talking to him it felt like there was arms around me hugging me. The
Christmas after he died my aunt Julie and my cousins came to visit, we had not
seen them in a while so everyone took a lot of pictures. In almost every
picture, on different cameras and different rolls of film there was a white
blur, we all believe it was him spending the holiday with his family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do not live there anymore and have not
lived there in about 8 years and I miss the experiences I used to have there. I
have many stories of things that have happened in my new house, that I know
aren't my uncle </span><st1:PersonName><span style="font-family: Arial;">Rich</span></st1:PersonName><span style="font-family: Arial;">ard but that's another story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My grandparents used to own
a home in New Hartford, CT. until about 5 years ago... It was a huge house,
mostly built by my Gramps, and it sat centered on about 4 1/2 acres of land. It
was really nice... In the daytime, anyhow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It was a 2 story house, with
a huge attic, and a basement as well. There were a total of 5 bedrooms in the
main part of the house, and there was a 2 bedroom apartment connected to the
house. Now, just as a bit of background, my Gram and Gramps were some cool old
people. They traveled a LOT. In fact, they've been to many different countries,
and have been to all 48 continetnal states, plus </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Alaska</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">, in their RV. A few years before I was born, they
went to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Haiti</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-family: Arial;">... And, they bought this FREAKY little wooden
statue.. Ever since I was a little girl, any time we went up to CT to visit
them, I HATED that statue. A giant pillowcase used to have to be put over it so
that I couldn't see it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">One night, when I was about
13, I was sleeping in the bedroom that was converted into my Gram's
needlepoint/sewing room. I woke up to go to the potty. The little freaky statue
man had the customary pillowcase pulled over him, and was standing in his usual
corner across the short, squared hall from "my room." I went potty,
and came out. First thing I always did, was I had to check and make sure that
the little man hadn't moved. I ended up wetting myself when I looked and saw
the pillowcase on the floor in the corner where scary statue man was, and then
looked at the corner by my door, and he was there. I was only in the bathroom
for 2 minutes... And, that statue was WAY too heavy for anyone to move it and
me not hear it. Everyone else was asleep anyhow. My older brother (the only one
who would have been sick enough to pull a mean prank like that) was not at my
grandparents' home... He was in Bark Hamsted (sp?) with my cousin Sean at my
Aunt Joanie and Uncle Jim's house. As soon as I saw that Mr. Man was waiting
for me by my door- probably waiting for me to walk by so that he could grab me
and eat me or something- I immediately took off running down the stairs (which
was an incredible feat for me in and of itself, if you've never seen a fat
13-year-old girl run before), and ran through the family/living room, through
the kitchen, into the foyer, and up the 2 steps to the attatched apartment
where my mother was sleeping with my little sister Hannah and my baby brother
Ryan. The next morning, bright and early, we went upstair to invesstigate...
And, where was the statue? Back in the corner it was supposed to be in, with
the pillowcase pulled over it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">i have had many encounters
with the paranormal since i was about 5-6 yrs old i have seen ghosts and i have
seen and heard and felt honest to gods demons. i wanted to share two of
these<span style="">&nbsp; </span>experiences with you. people can
think what they will but i take these things very seriously and know beyond a
shadow of a doubt that they are real and walk among us. the first ghost to ever
cross my path was that of a woman i was 5 at the time and had gone into the
kitchen to get a drink while my family was watching a movie on the hyda bed. i
was standing there drinking my water ,when i see in my peripheral vision a
woman in a white dress floating down the hall from my aunts room right into the
room occupied by my mother and myself. being as i was a child a thought only
that this lady didnt belong in our house. well i for some reason threw a
kitchen knife at it and you guessed it the knife went right through it. my mom
always said to me that the boogie man was in the closet so be careful. you know
what she was right only that it was the boogie woman. it was about two night
afterward that i saw the door to the closet bow outward as though someone or
something were trapped inside and was trying to get out. that door actually
splintered in a few places. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">my second encounter was with
a phantom miner sounds wierd huh but let me just say that this was in
sacremento </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">california</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;"> where gold was discovered. sutters mill was about
10-15 miles from our house. i saw the spectre in our back yard digging in the
ground. he was dressed as a miner would have dressed in the 1840s he even had a
mule with him loaded down with things. it was at night at about </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="22"><span style="font-family: Arial;">10 pm</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;"> i guess he found what he was looking for because he
pulled something out of the ground put it in a pack grabbed the mules reins and
started to walk away about 3 seconds later he had vanished from sight. the
thing that was odd to me was that a water pipe that was in the spot where this
phantasmal miner was searching had that very next morning mysteriously began to
leak.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My name is Mari.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After reading some of your stories, I decided
to share mine with you- just as an example to those who may not believe in
beyond natural beings........<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">About 2 years ago, I lived
with my parents and I slept in a 2 bedroom attic- ever since we moved there, my
mother had seen a little girl running from room to room--- and at night you
could feel something creeping around the bed but there was nothing there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">One night for some reason I
was really scared, so I slept with my lamp on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was awakened by my "mother" she came really up close to my
face and screamed at me- she said "I'm going to turn that light off
whether you like it or not".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it
really scared me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The next morning, I asked
her why she did that- she said "Mari, I slept all night, I didn't go upstairs
at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>if it wasn't her than who?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its something to think about.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I used to work there, and
rumor has it the building burnt down years ago, before it was a Gap.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in the back stock room in the basement, it
still smells like charred wood, and no one will go in there alone. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">creepy noises and other
wierd things have happened in there (boxes moved, etc.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">also..next door is an Urban
Outfitters where many of my friends worked, and apparently the ghosts there are
more bold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>people have seen apparitions,
soda cans have overflowed without being touched, and people have been locked
into rooms, among other things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">the offices of both of these
buildings are downstairs, but most people won't be in there alone, as there is
always kinda of a feeling of being watched, noises, and just a basic feeling of
not being alone when you are.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I thought i would share this
story, since it concerns information on this page. This past week I went over
to a brand new (roughly 5 years old) apartment complex off Jackson Rd. Near Zeeb.
Upon visiting the complex with a roommate of mine, we found it to be a very
excellent complex and even seemed to be a decent neighborhood. I had a little
bit of an uneasy feeling about this place but attempted to shrug it off in
interests of a nice apartment close to work. As we talked to a person in the
office, the feeling grew, and continued as such that by the end of the showing
of the unit, it was so uncomfortable that i had to leave. Little known to me,
but at the end of the tour, an impression of something very WRONG hit my
roommate "like a ton of bricks" as he put it. This impression was so
strong i passed on this complex, however i could NOT shake the feeling i had
gotten from that place for several hours afterwards. I tried doing some
research after a friend had told me there was a Commune right next to the
place, and that she had gotten a strange feeling from that location as well.
Taking a guess that there had to been some sort of rash of violent muders,
defiled graves, or possibly a haunting, I came across Shadowlands. I remember
someone showing me this site before, but now it felt like there was a reason i
came back. I saw the blurb on the </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;">Mercywood</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hospital</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> and read about it's former location. I couldnt believe that this should
have been an issue, but it was too close to not be a coincidence. researching
further, i only found very brief blurbs on the Sanitarium and mention of a stay
by Theodore Roethke, but then i noticed a relief/survey map that had
lat/longitude coordinates for where the hospital stood, and much to my
discomfort, it was shown as being DIRECTLY across the street on </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Jackson</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, roughly a mile north from this complex. reading
this information and getting the feeling i did, i cannot believe that anyone
could possibly live there. I did find that the hospital was torn down in 1987
and now there resides a car dealership, but any information about the history
of the hospital itself other than Roethke's stay, and it's expansion has been
totally wiped from the annuls of every corner of the net. Is this haunting
simply from the disturbed minds of its patients? or did something else take
place at that location to cause it's closure and eventual demolition? Either
way, this revelation has caused me to be highly critical of places in the immediate
vicinity and it also illustrates just 'HOW' distressed the Spirits of that
location are. If there's any further information on this place, i would be
highly interested in knowing, as simply reading about the hospital only answers
a few questions, and poses so many more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Okay. I am fourteen years
old and I am in high school. I live near the town of </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Waco</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">. I live in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Lorena</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">Texas</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">. Anyway, when I was in sixth grade, I heard weirds
things. Mind you, this only happened twice. I went to bed one night and before
I fell asleep I heard this weird tapping on my window. I doubt it was a tree
branch because the tree branches are not long enough to touch my window. They
were long enough to scratch the metal roof though. ( I sleep in the second
story of my mom's house) I was freaked out. I think it happened again the next
night or after. I heard the same tapping again on my window. It stopped and
right before I thought the tapping was gone for the night, I heard this huge
bang. It sounded like something hit my window. Sometimes my windows upstairs
rattle when it is windy but there was no wind that night. It scared me. I did
not notice until maybe a few days later there were scortch marks on the roof.
My mom always said we lived on ancient Indian burial grounds. Later on my uncle
told me we live on a battle field. When my family first moved onto our land,
they found cannon balls and fifty calibur bullets. I also found a railroad
spike. Maybe the noises I heard might have been the battle or maybe I was
imaging things. Thanks for listening to me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Jewelery store. I worked there for 10 yrs and several things happened to me and
some other employee's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Co-workers and I
have both heard our names being called on more then one occasion. Things being
hid and moved things turning on and off like lights and machinery. I was
touched by a unseen hand and old broken clocks would chime. Once four of us
were standing at the counter talking, and there was a fountain on the counter
next to me and as we were talking the stones in the fountain would fly out and
hit me. We just joke about it because something was always happening especially
to me. We think that the spirit is the spirit of an old man that used to work
at the store.He always helped me out before he died and I think he is still
helping us out<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in death, all you have to
do is just ask Him to help and he will help. He has found many things for me.
But that's a whole other story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">There is one place that has
not been put in your hauntings, back home where I'am from we have a haunted
casino many people don't belive that we do but I have worked there for over 3
years and have heard the stories of the buffet being haunted. After the buffet
would close down for the night you would hear pots and pans being moved around,
also the water would run. One time the secruity was informed of a mess in the
kitchen, they investgated the kitchen and found things have been thrown around
but there were no employee in the area. In their report they wrote that the
buffet staff did not clean the kitchen after closing it down, that was found to
be untrue cause the supervisors said they check the kitchen before anyone is
allowed to leave. Until this day no one knows what or who causes the mess but
it has happened 5 more times after that. The other part of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the casino that is haunted is the hotel, room
312 or 307 has been reported as haveing little ghosts such as small children
pulling the covers off of the guest and turning on the water. One guest
reported that they could not sleep cause of<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the children running in the hallways and doors slaming in the middle of
the night. Only once has it been caught on tape by the survalliance camera but
no one would believe that ghosts haunt the place. This casino was said to be
built on Indian prayer grounds and was told not to have it built but the people
back home went ahead and had it built any ways cause would bring new jobs for
their people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have worked there but not
have heard or seen any of it was only told the storys. I really don't want to
name the place cause I'm afraid of being in trouble our people but if they did
not want any one to know about this they should have not built the casino, I
have been told that employees still hear and see the ghost. Back home there
alot of haunted places but I find this one to be the most, They say the hoff
man is yet to visit this place cause he has visited the old casino before this
one was built. The old one was built in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">St.Michaels</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">ND</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> and now the new one is built 5 miles from the old
one. The Spirit Lake Casino and Resort was opened in June of 1996 that is when
I started there, in the buffet. If you have any question please email to the
above address its my husbands email.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: GOM@webtv.net<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I've sent several stories to
your site regarding some of my experiences, when I was a teenager, living in a
housing development in northern </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">New Jersey</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The entire
development was built on a former farm of the Holt family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The original but refurbished farmhouse still
sits on the property till this day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
farmhouse appeared to be built in the mid to late 1700's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cellar contained a maze-like collection
of windowless cubicles with manacles for hands and feet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was a set-up, I was to find out later,
which was a common way for landowners in the north to house their slaves at
night because they didn't have large spreads as did landowners in the
south.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was more than a hellish way to
live, I'm sure. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I used to babysit for the
many young families who resided in the development.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One family, I'll call then the
"Pecks", were a particularly sour lot, especially the man of the
family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This man had altercations with
just about every other family in the development of approximately 20 families. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I did not babysit for this
family very often but it was an unsettling experience whenever I did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Pecks had only one child, a son of about<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">8 or 9, who was a very
quiet, frightened-looking boy (frightened, we all thought, by the sour Mr.
Peck).<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Mr. Peck kept what was his
"library" on two shelves in the rec room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">There was nothing much of
interest to read from this collection.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One book though, which was prominently displayed, was a copy of
Hitler's, "Mein Kampf".<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Whenever I was there I would
see small, scurrying shadows along the floor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I put it down to feeling tired.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, after about an hour in the creepy Peck house, I would begin to
feel very sleepy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On one occasion,
possibly the last one in which I babysat for them, the small shadow
"animals" were so numerous that I put my feet up on the couch to
avoid them!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were so many in front
of me on the rug that they resembled hundreds of grey rats on a feeding frenzy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">With the exception of the
old farmhouse, this was probably one of the creepiest houses in the development
in which I babysat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For what it may be
worth, this development was very close to some high voltage power lines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

inmates were heading back to their cells I could hear a few inmates in the
bathroom finishing up.(I could hear their sneakers squeaking) I opened up the
bathroom and their was nobody there.I also heard other staff saying they could
see a human<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Form running when they are

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hello,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I'm sure you get a lot of
stories, but if you have time, can you please read and post mine?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thanks!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Six years ago, my husband,
infant son, and I moved into our first apartment in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">San Antonio</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">TX</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was nice,
and was our very first place of our own, so we were excited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everything was fine until 3 months later when
it was broken into.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We signed a 6-month
lease, so we waited till the lease was up, and the apartment manager was nice
enough to move us to a different apartment (upstairs) as we renewed another
6-month lease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is where strange
things happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I never saw nor heard
anything, but I always felt odd, like I was being watched, and strange things
happened, mostly every time, when my son and I were there alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first event happened when my husband was
home, but was not in the same room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was in my son's room on the carpet playing with him, while my husband was in
the living room watching T.V.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In my
son's room on top of his dresser sat a Rugrats piggy bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was one of those that moved and played the
Rugrats theme whenever a coin was inserted, or if the button was pressed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were nowhere near the thing, and it all of
a sudden started playing!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I freaked,
needless to say, and couldn't move a muscle!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I got chills, and couldn't speak for a few minutes after it
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't think I'd ever been so
scared in my life!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My son was too little
to think anything of it and still played.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I called out to my husband and told him what happened, and he said there
was probably just something mechanically wrong w/it, no big deal, so I shrugged
it off.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The next event happened
while my husband was at school in the evening, so I was alone with my son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was about 13-14 months old and
walking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in my room, and he was
playing in his.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he came running in
my room, crying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He took my hand, and
was leading me to his room, like he wanted to show me something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He didn't talk, but he pointed to the corner
of his room, right next to the dresser the Rugrats piggy bank was, and just
grunted, like he was pointing something out to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't see anything, but he kept pointing
and grunting, and he seemed scared.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After that, I started to think he saw something I could not, and the
place might be haunted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">There were times my husband
would stay out late with his friend while I was home, so I'd keep the chain
lock unlocked so he could get in so I wouldn't have to get out of bed to let
him in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many times he wasn't able to get
in, because everything was locked, when I knew before I went to bed, the chain
lock wasn't locked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would knock until
I got up to let him in, and he would say how he couldn't get in, and of course,
all the locks would be locked...weird!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Another time, I was getting
ready for work in my bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, I
was alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband was already at
work, and my son was still asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had
my bedroom door closed, but not all the way.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Something made me turn to look at it, and I saw it moving slightly, as
if someone was on the other side, looking through the crack, but it didn't open
any more than it was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought the door
was gonna fly open any second, but it didn't.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was so scared, but I tried to ignore it, and go back to what I was
doing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">That's all I remember about
the apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thank God we moved out
after our lease was up!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">At the time, I was a tenant
of one of the apartment buildings at 31st and </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-family: Arial;">Grand Ave</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-family: Arial;"> in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Des Moines</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">IA.</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
apartment building was once a mansion and then a funeral home, as I found out
the history of the house from the owner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I am not sure when it was made into an apartment building. But there
were two identical houses right next to each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mine and another one which was also a mansion
and then a funeral home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">One early morning, about 2
or 3 AM, I awoke from sleep (or half asleep and half awake) hearing voices in
the room with me and saw hovering over me two people (ghosts or apparitions)
and they were discussing how I died and how I looked peaceful and rested,
etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They thought I was dead and were
apparently at my funeral.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also heard
voices out on the front porch talking about my death and when I went to look
out the window to see if anyone was there, there was no one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But yet the talking kept on going, and I saw
a group of ghosts (as I will call them for a lack of another term) on the front
porch mourning my death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This was a very frightening
experience for me and I still remember it to this day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both the houses have been torn down now and a
huge condominium built in their place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But was this an experience of ghostly encounters for me?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am still trying to figure out what exactly
happened that one early morning about three years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This happened years ago,
when I was about six or seven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
playing at my grandparents house with my sister and my cousin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My grandmother had recently died of cancer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I believed in ghosts then, and convinced my
sister and cousin to put a doll in my grandmothers old room to see what would
happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a battery-powered Tommy
Pickles doll from Rugrats.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We turned it
off, placed it where her head used to go, and left, locking the doors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We came back after dinner, knowing that we
had the only key to the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we
opened the door, not only was the doll on a different part of the bed, but it
had been turned on!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was mumbling
words that it had never said before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
cousin gasped, and the doll turned over to look at us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It stopped talking, and just stared at us with
wide eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I picked it up, looking at
the control panel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had been off the
whole time!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We ran to our grandpa and
told him what happened, but he told us that we had had too much food and were
seeing things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know about you,
but I think it was a ghostly expirience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I lived at my parents' house
until about two years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They and my
brothers still live there, and I now live nextdoor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have owned the house for 20 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ever since I was young, I could remember
strange things happening there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fans
would turn on by themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
basketball once rolled itself across the room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Another time I was going into the living room to get a cassette my
mother asked to me to get, and it was on the floor, away from all the others,
as if it was left there for me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As time went on, things were
still creepy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night my bed shook for
no <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">reason, waking up me and my
boyfriend.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But one night was truly <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">unbelievable, and to this
day, talking about it scares me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
great to have a place to share it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This was about 2 years ago,
and at that time I slept in the basement of the house, which my parents had
made into a small apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I woke up
thirsty, and sat up to take a sip of water from a glass I had next to the
bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked up and saw a girl standing
at the top of the stairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">She was wearing a red and
white flowered dress, had long hair, and was facing the top of the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It looked so real, I was about to say
"who are you?" thinking maybe my brothers had a friend over or
something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She proceeded to fall
backwards down the stairs, and disappear into thin air.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Terrified, I jumped out of
bed, turned on the light, and ran upstairs, where I sat trembling on the couch
in the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could hear a faint
sound of singing (which i had heard in the house before) and it sounded like a
man and young girl.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I figured that my
parents upstairs had their radio on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
had no tv or radio on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My brothers then
came home and I told them what happened.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They sat up with me which helped me calm down, and I eventually fell
asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day I told my parents
the story, and asked if they had had the radio on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father's response was no, and that he had
heard beautiful voices singing and thought it was something I had been
listening to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We also saw that the light
at the top of the basement stairs, where I saw the girl, along with the lights
directly above it on the first and second floors all went out, and the light
bulb in each had actually broken.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Luckily, I was due to move
into an apartment nextdoor weeks later, and I never slept in the basement
again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I still live nextdoor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few times on Sundays, the tv has gone on by
itself, and it is always a broadcast of a catholic mass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At night, I will wake up to find the basement
door opened and the light on, when I know it was turned off when I went to
bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only weeks ago, the bedroom door
slammed shut for no reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The windows
were all shut so it could not have been wind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It troubles me that these
things are still happening although I have moved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">If anyone has any insight to
share, it is appreciated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hi Dave my name is garrett
and it would be so kind of you if you would submit a ghost story for me.The
thing I have to tell you about is there's a sort of spirit in my woods or
atleast i think there is, it's a creature that takes shape as a 6-foot tall
male completely coated in shiny black. Me and my friend Charlie were going in the
woods one night about 2 years ago and when my house was out of sight we were at
this intersection in the path were 4 mappel trees were I shined my flashlight
up in the top of one of the trees and saw it.It jumped down at us and knocked
me over the only facial features were its shining yellow eyes. Right when we
thought we were going to be killed the creature looked over to the left then
looked at use then took to the trees and ran off. We didn't know what scared it
off,but i learned that my great grand father died in those wood so maybe his
spirit was protecting us from this creature. Also it attacked me and my friend
sam in broad daylight once and i have never seen it since.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A certain teacher at my
school who is still teaching today, used to sleep in the "main
building" (not Boyle Hall. -there are three buildings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>left-modern school<span style="">&nbsp; </span>middle-now abandoned "main
building" abandoned since 2001. and right- Boyle hall, oldest and original
school building also abandoned.) He slept on the fourth floor which used to be
a dormitory for nuns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was in his room
when he heard footsteps coming down the hall towards his door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The footsteps stopped, then the doorknob
started to jiggle to be opened.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>immediately the teacher yelled "go away" and immediately ran
to open the door to confront his intruder. no one was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he looked up and down the hallway. no
one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a person would've ran to the
staircase which could not have been reached in a full sprint by the time my
teacher looked into the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>all
other doors in the hallway were shut and he didnt hear any of the doors open
and shut in order for the intruder to quickly hide in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if there was a person in one of the
other rooms, he was too petrified to search.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When I was little I used to
spend the night with my grandma every Friday night. She lived in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">New London</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> (a very small town in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Indiana</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">). Where she lived there was a graveyard across the
street and a church next door. Well we were getting ready for bed and got to
talking and we decided to take a little walk. We went outside and crossed the
street and walked through the graveyard. It was almost dusk so we were looking
at the gravestones and talking about what we thought the people were like and
things like that. We came to this one gravestone and it had a picture on the
marker of the little girl who was buried there. I can still remember what she
looked like. She died about 12 yrs. old. I remember that because I was 12 yrs.
old. I told my grandma how awful to die so young. Well by then it started to
get dark so we went home. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The next morning we woke up
and ate breakfast. I suggested we go back to that little girls grave to have a
better look at her picture. When we went back we couldn't find it anywhere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I recently took my kids
there and we looked for it. To this day I cannot find that gravestone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I asked my grandma if she
remembers that night. She told me she did. I was surprised. I thought maybe I
dreamed it. But she confirmed it was not a dream.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My family and I lived in
this house between 1983-86 and our family would encounter many strange events. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We had a big tree that had
strips about 5 " wide and 7-10 feet long<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>3 side by side, like a huge cat or something was trying to clime it, the
bark was laid out in a neat row leading to the old milk barn for the 2 cows we
kept. We had a tree specialist come from </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Mankato</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> to examine the tree, we were very curious. My father
would joke and say that it was a 10,000 pound putty cat and he could sleep
where ever he wanted to. The specialist called back about two weeks later and
said "well there was no spontaneous lighting activity and there are no
signs of a natural gas in the tree samples, our conclusion is about the same as
your husband"<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">10,000 POUND PUTTY CAT.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Other strange events would occur, missing
items that would show up a week or so later in the same spot you thought you
left it in. Our dog's would sit at the end of the driveway and viciously bark
and snarl, you would have to drag them away. Our Dairy cows would evade there
milk path in a panic when there was nothing there that we could see. Foul odors
that only one person could smell when there was three people in the room at the
same time, and the smell would pass to the next and you could not smell it
anymore, horrific odor, smelt like burnt hair and rubber and other things that
you could not even describe. We would try to decorate by putting on wallpaper
or paint, but when we would wash the walls to prep before, they would ooze a
crude red liquid and then the odors would start up again. I remember my sister
saying "Mom!! The walls are bleeding". <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We noticed that everything
we brought in new, it would not work. Like our Lawn mower, brand new try to
start it on the lawn and nothing would happen, not even a sputter. We took it
back several time only to be embarrassed when the guy would start it with one
pull and look at us like idiots. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I started the lawn mower on </span><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Co.</span></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">
rd 43 and made a run for the lawn after it was started, my persistence paid
off. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We started putting King
James Bibles on anything that would not work and believe it or not it worked. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">There is another family that
lives there now and I am concerned about from time to time. I see many cars
that look like they should work but do not ever move in the yard. I hope that
no one is hurt or worse yet<o:p></o:p></span></p>
