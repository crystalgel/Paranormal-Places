Haunted House in Alaska<br>
<br>
By: NRai5@aol.com<br>
<br>
When I was 14 years old my family moved into a nice house just about a
mile outside of a little town in Alaska. We only stayed in the house
for a little over a month. I believe that my dad found out that the
place was haunted, got scared and moved us out. Although he never told
us if he had ever seen the ghost as I had. Now that I am 44 years old
and I look back at what happen I don't see ghost as something to be
afraid of, They seem to be like us. They act and talk the same as they
did as when they were alive. I will not say names or places in this
story. It was 1975 when we moved into that house. Some time before that
an old man and his wife lived there. The house and all the land around
there belonged to them. One day he died in his sleep, Not a bad way to
go to the after life. But this left the old women alone as their only
son had died in WW II. She placed the old guy in a nice spot in the
grave yard and put a fence up around his resting spot and the one next
to him where she planed to send the rest of time with the man she had
loved all of her adult life. But soon some of the greedy towns people
had befriended her. In a few years they made her a will that had
divided all her land up between all of them. She must have thought they
were real nice people. But one day she got real sick and the small town
doctor could no longer care for her so he sent her to a bigger town far
away where the doctors there could. But it was to late. Lonely and
wanting to be with her husband she past to the after life. The greedy
towns people that had been her friends did not bring her body back to
rest for all time with the man she loved. With only thoughts of her
money, house and land they left her to be berried in the bigger town by
the state. But she returned to haunt the house, which I found out years
later when my family moved in. All of the old womens stuff was still
there packed in boxes in the only room that was up stairs. One day my
three bothers and I unpacked the boxes and left the stuff all over that
room. We didn't think anything about it. You know how teenage boys can
be. We were mostly looking at old pictures of her son in the war. The
next day I was home alone. Playing some John Denver tapes when all of a
sudden I heard an old womens voice coming from that room up stairs. She
was saying " G-- Damn those kids, I'll show them not to get into my
stuff." I heard foot steps coming down the stairs so I looked up. I saw
a cloud looking figure shape at the foot of the steps. It stopped
talking and moving when we noticed each other. When the shock was gone
I remembered what she was saying and how mad she sounded. Noticing that
she was not moving, I thought maybe she don't think I can see her so I
reached over and turned off the John Denver tape got up and slowly
walked over to the door. When I got outside I ran the mile back to
town. I never said anything to anyone because I didn't want people
thinking I was nuts. I went back to that little once about 15 years
ago, I went to the grave yard and that's when I notice that only the
old man was berried there with an empty spot next to him. I felt sad
when I realized&nbsp; that the old women would always be haunting that
old house and she would never rest in the spot next to her husband.<br>

My Own Haunted House<br>
<br>
By: wv2hillbillies@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Iam a firm believer in ghosts, after living in this house when I
was seven and eight years old. This house also had evil elements there
too. So much happened there, I'm not sure where to start.I'll start
with location. This was an old 2 story farm house in rural Indiana,
near Tipton. It sat way off the road, with a long driveway, and a fence
all around the yard, with a big front porch. We were renting it. My
mother, grandmother and 6 brothers and sisters. My little brother, who
was 3 at the time, would run around the kitchen table, screaming that
he wasn't going in the basement with the little boy. We all just
dismissed it as an imaginary friend until I saw him myself. Alittle
blond headed boy, dressed in knickers, suspenders and a white shirt,
and he also tried to get me in the basement.<br>
There were two bedrooms downstairs,and three up. My mother slept
downstairs, as did my grandmother. My mother would be asleep at night,
feel someone push on her back, as to scoot over. She thought it was
just one of us kids wanting in bed with her, so she would move over,
and she could feel the bed move, as if someone was getting in bed, but
when she turned over to see who it was, noone was there!<br>
One of my older sisters, who was 14 at the time, was upstairs in her
room, the rest of us were downstairs. We heard her scream , and yell
for help, we ran upstairs, along with my grandmother. Her bedroom door
seemed locked ( although it did not have a lock on it) It felt warm to
the touch, and there was a red glow under the door. My grandmother
yelled for her to open the door, she said she couldn't. She said the
devil was in there with her. My grandmother started crying, and said "
In the name of Jesus Christ, leave this house". All then went quite,
the door flew open and my sister came running out,crying . She was
never quite the same again for a long while. Would not sleep in that
room. We moved not long after that.<br>
Another thing&nbsp; ppened that unerved us all. We were in the living
room, watching tv one night. when we heard something heavy falling down
the stairway. the stairs were the old type that had a door at the
bottom, which was shut and opened into the living room. When the
"thing" got down to the bottm, the door flew open, but nothing was
there!<br>
We would hear footsteps on the front porch, at night, with all of us in
the house and accounted for, a knock on the front door, but noone was
there. we would see " mists' like fog, but with a human shape. We were
never so glad to move in our whole life.<br>
30 years later, as a grown woman, my 2 sisters and I decided to drive
out to see the house. The house was no longer there, the barn was, but
not the house. We went down the road to the neighbors, and asked them
what happened to the house. They said the owners decided to just tear
it down, because they couldn't get any one to the live in it more than
6 months or so, because it was haunted. We told them we know it was
because we used to live there as kids. They also said that there were
human bones found in the basement in the crawlspace, one was a child.<br>
Sorry for the long story, but there was lot that went on in that house
that I wanted to share. Some of you might say, "yeah right" but it is a
true story.<br>
Hope you have a good day! &gt;From the transplanted WV Hillbillies!<br>

Dear shadow lands<br>
, my story is not so much one of a haunting but of a guardians angle story , My name is Emily and im 20 years old<br>
when I was about 4 I witnessed&nbsp; the passing of my grandfather he
had been ill for years with cancer he was a big part of my life I
remember there where days where we would go to the shop give the guy
50c and buy a bag of lollies my favioute was the teeth I had lost my 2
front teeth and he had fake ones so we both used to pretend that that
was my teeth well to cut a long story short after he died I didn't get
to really say good bye I missed him allot . I don't remember anything
directly when I was younger bout his guiding then but as I got older I
started to notice them the biggest one was that I was going through a
few difficult times in my life where I didn't know what to do , but
some how I used to feel this presence which I just new was him behind
me and I knew exactly what to do&nbsp; if the problem was major I would
smell the smell of the teeth lollies and his tobacco pipe and&nbsp;
would feel comfortable, the day that it stopped happening was the
day&nbsp; met my previous partner and we went and paid our respects it
was the saddest feeling in my life to realise I would never see him
again or until I passed on . I do feel that he was a big part in saving
me life when I all I wanted to do was die<br>
I hope that this story brings hope to many cause I believe that he is
happy and finally at rest I do miss him but one day we will meet again<br>

A recent Ghost Story<br>
<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
<br>
My mother was given a cross by a very religious, very nice man a few
years ago.&nbsp; He was a devout catholic and his hobby was collecting
crosses. He was in the nursin home where she works and handed her the
cross off the wall, it was one of maybe 75.&nbsp; He died a year or two
of complications of the flu (pneumonia).&nbsp; we hung it in the
bathroom of our trailer.&nbsp; It was fine for a while, then there was
a lot of activity where a ceramic cat was thrown violently against the
door ( it was closed) when we would go to bed and thrown&nbsp; clear
out in the hallway. My ex-husband blamed the cat we brode it in a
million pieces and threw it away,&nbsp; Now I live in a nice little
house with my boyfriend and mother.&nbsp; We hung the cross at the back
door to protect the house.&nbsp; The second week we were here, we heard
heavy walking across the kitchen floor like a 359 pound person was
walking, and none was there. the cross was hanging on kithchen wall.
The boards creaked like a real person sas there.&nbsp; This was
followed by a loud banging on the kitchen wall right beneath the
cross,&nbsp; like someond hitting the wall very hard, with the flat of
their hand.&nbsp; Nest&nbsp; my boyfriend would hear my voice calling
him like I was in distress. Im upstairs, hadnt said a word, hes
downstairs.&nbsp; Then I heard a good imitation of&nbsp; my mome voice
speaking from the dardened living room while I was going thru the
brightly hall to bathroom.&nbsp; She was sound asasleep in
bedroom.&nbsp; She would here me clearing my throat( had cold) and
calling her while I was gone to work.&nbsp; Then I heard boyfriends
voice come into bedroom and tell me to get up and fis breakfast and
don&#8217;t lie in bed.&nbsp; He was asleep in his room downstairs.&nbsp; I
broke the cross in a million pieces and threw it away, so far its been
quiet (two weeks) and a minister is coming to bless
house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

Footsteps and Sounds<br>
<br>
By: nitalja@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
This story takes place in my old house. We just moved out about 4 years
ago. Anyways one night while my parents were at work,they both work
graveyard, me, my little sister, my big sister and my little brother
were all sitting in the living room watching some late night tv. All of
a sudden we heard a plastic cup drop in the kitchen.We ignored it at
first thinking that maybe someone sat a cup down unleveled. Five
minutes later we heard another cup drop. We were getting curious. So
me, being the little tomboy I was, got up and looked in the kitchen. I
couldn't see anything because the light was off. So, I ran to the other
side of the kitchen and flicked on the light.To my surprise there were
no cups or anything on the floor. That night me and by sisters and
brother slept together until our parents came home. <br>
Another experience we encountered were footsteps. My dad is a very
heavy walker, so you can hear him before you see him. But this night he
was at work again. We were all sleeping when we heard some hard
footsteps.They would lead from the front door to the kitchen. Never
towards the room.Then every time one of us would get up and look, they
would stop.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Also another experience. There were these little tiny footprints on our
wall. They look like little muddy boot marks. But they were SO tiny.Me
and my little sister would scrub them off, but a few days later they
would appear back but not in the same place. That house was the
freakiest house I ever moved in. We would see black figures in the
corner of our eyes but when we would look, they would disapear. FREAKY <br>

Carousel<br>
<br>
By: babyshane24@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
My name is Carol and I want to share a story with you about a house I
lived in as a child. It all began one day when I was 12 years old in a
house in Hayden Indiana. I was at home alone while my parents ran some
errands in town.I was told to stay inside and clean my room due to the
fact that I was grounded. That meant no playing with the neighbor kid
in the house to right of us and no playing with the kids to the left of
us.So I began my cleaning. No radio or no television was allowed. After
some long ,exstensive deep cleaning I decided to lay down on the floor
next to my bed to take a break. I thought maybe that would also give me
the oppertunity to check under my bed for lost items. As I lay there on
the floor I realized that I was hearing music. It sounded like the
music that is played while riding a carousel at an amusement park. I
checked my room but found nothing. I checked the entire
house.......still nothing. I called to the neighbor's house on both
sides of us......they weren't home. I went outside to each of their
houses to double check that their existance was truely lacking there
and also listened around their homes and no music was found of any
kind. I returned home and went back to my room to lay on the floor and
discovered that the sound was definately coming from my room. The lower
to the floor I got ,the louder it could be heard. It seemed utterly
impossible considering I stayed on the lowest floor of that house which
was made with a concrete floor with very little padding. There was no
basement nor an attic. I was getting pretty scared by this point. I
listened again with one ear smashed against the floor and my finger in
the other. There was no doubt that the sound was flowing from beneathe
me! It played and played . After a short time that seemed like days my
parents arrived. And when they came into the house, the music ceased. I
told them about it but they really didn't believe me. That is untill 3
years later when we were moving.My mother was grabbing the last of our
belongings from our room and heard the same thing I did only this time
she heard it from the other side of my room, but was still indeed from
the floor. She called to my father and he had heard the same. They
looked at each other with puzzled but startled disbelief. They vowed
with only their eyes not to make a scene of it and just quickly get out
of that house. My father left the room and my mother and I started
bringing down the curtains off my windows. I was standing to the right
of her when my mother had asked me to pick up the curtain tie off the
floor which had fallen.I was busy too so I was delayed for a few
minutes . My mother was hasty and decided to do it herself. As she
turned to her left to snatch it up she came eye to eye with a little
girl&nbsp; that had dark hair and appeared to be the age of nine or so
and was quite obviously a ghost considering we could see right through
her.She looked sad . She waved goodbye and when she disappeared the
music stopped. My mother had been screaming in fright and I had been
stareing in pure shock. It didn't take long for us to be on the road
with the last of our things after that. We all looked out the windows
of the car at the house as we drove by for one last look at the home we
had recently dwelled in with the ghost. To our shock once again the
little girl&nbsp; showed herself at the window of my room and in
addition to her was an elderely woman whom appeared in the window of
the room my parents had and another little girl who looked similar to
the first one watched out the room my brother used. I remember
wondering after we had been on the road for a half hour or so , if the
"ghost ladies" were then in my room dancing to the carousel music. I'm
29 now and sometimes I have the urge to go to that house to see if they
might still be dancing.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

Another Experience<br>
<br>
By: beanhead36@juno.com<br>
<br>
A few nights ago(Jan. 2005) I was doing a google search on my sister
inlaw. She was murdered in October(2005) in Pace, Florida, and every
few weeks I will check the local papers to see if there are any new
reports.<br>
&nbsp;To keep a short story short, I was sitting here at my desk, my
children were in the other room. My son likes to try to sneak up on me
and scare me, especially while I am reading these pages~So when I heard
someone breathing hard, four quick panting like exhales, and felt the
hair move on my neck I just assumed it was him. I jokingly threw my
hand back(thinking I'd catch him by the shirt) and said "Okay, that's
it!!!I'm gonna knock you out!" My daughter called out from the other
room "Mom...Who are you going to knock out?"<br>
The hair on my neck started to stand up as I turned in my chair. They
were both sitting on the couch reading Calvin and Hobbs...IN THE OTHER
ROOM!!!<br>
I just replied "I guess...umm...nobody."<br>
I told them what happened. My daughter asked if I thought it was Auntie
Pamela, or if it was our other ghost. I said I did not know, but
whoever it was sure spooked me.<br>

A Story for the Archives<br>
<br>
By: emma@towerhouseconsulting.com<br>
<br>
This story was told to me by a friend whose family own a kind of
building/house renovation service. Both her Grandfather and Uncle were
asked to do some work on a house somewhere in the countryside of
Hampshire, England. They family who owned the house knew them, and
asked them to carry out the work whilst they were away on holiday to
prevent any disturbances for them. Accordingly, the Uncle and
Grandfather were entrusted with keys to the property. <br>
It so happened that one afternoon they drove past the house on their
way back from another job, and decided to go in and view the work that
needed doing, so that they might get a head start when they returned
the next day. As it was a winter&#8217;s afternoon, about four o&#8217;clock, it
was beginning to get dark as they drove up the driveway. They entered
through the back door using the set of keys they had been given, and
into the kitchen, as this was the first room that the family had
requested they work on. After examining it, they mounted the stairs and
walked along an upstairs corridor to a small bedroom, the other room on
which they had been asked to carry out work. <br>
They unlocked the door to this room using their keys, and switched on
the light, as by this point it was quite dark outside. As they both
stood in the room, each man began to feel very uncomfortable, and could
sense something strange. Both tried to ignore it for as long as
possible, and neither man wanted to admit the fright he was feeling.
Eventually however, the feeling grew so intense that they both felt
forced to leave, and removed themselves as fast as possible, turning
off lights and locking doors in a hurry. <br>
They left the house, and as they walked to their car, both began to
feel slightly silly for reacting as they had. That is, until they
turned to look back at the house. The light was shining in the bedroom.
Both paused, trying to remember if they had left the light on in their
hurry to leave. Feeling a responsibility towards the property, and not
wanting to run up the owners&#8217; electricity bill in their absence, they
both steeled themselves and unlocked the door to the kitchen, went up
the stairs, and along the corridor. There, they found the bedroom door
standing open, and the light on. Hurriedly, they switched off the
light, locked the door, descended the stairs and left the house,
locking the back door behind them.<br>
They walked towards the car, and looked back. The bedroom light was on.
Both stood in the dark drive way, uncertain of what to do. Eventually,
driven either by stubbornness or curiosity, they once again let
themselves into the house, and mounted the stairs. This time however,
as they walked along the corridor, the bedroom door was shut. The
Uncle, who had the keys in his pocket, felt for them to open the door.
They were no longer there. The grandfather, disbelieving of what was
happening to him on an otherwise perfectly normal day at work, tried
the door-handle. It turned, the door was unlocked. However, he had
great difficulty in opening it. Both men leaned hard against it, and
slowly it gave. They squeezed themselves around it into the room, and
were able to see that a large chest of draws had been pushed against
it. And as they scanned they room, they realised with horror that all
the furniture had been moved around, so the lay-out of the room in no
way resembled the way it had looked when they first entered it. Worst
of all, on a chair in the middle of the room lay the keys which the
uncle had used only a few minutes earlier to lock the back door. This
time, neither was concerned about looking a fool. They grabbed the keys
and scrambled from the room, leaving the light on, the door unlocked,
and fled through the back door, just about stopping to lock it. They
threw themselves into the car and the uncle, who was driving, backed
them out the drive as fast as possible. <br>
The grandfather looked back at the house one last time as they backed away, only to see the bedroom light switch itself off.<br>
Thank you for reading my story!<br>

A Possible Haunting in my Apartment<br>
<br>
<br>
By: lisaboatman@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
This serves two purposes: one, to find out if my apartment is haunted,
and two, to post my story to your ghost stories so here goes...<br>
My husband and I moved into an apartment 8 months ago. I figured we had
no presences of any sort because both my sister and I are especially
sensitive to them (though we have never seen them) and have never felt
anything here. I started to second guess that though when my closet
doors would be open in the morning when I was almost positive I'd shut
them before going to bed. Then I started seeing things out of the
corner of my eye and started feeling like someone was there who wanted
to talk to me. One morning I woke to the sound of my husband locking
the door to our apartment (he was leaving for work). I distinctly saw a
dark shadowy figure bending over as if it were tying it's shoes. I
rubbed my eyes thinking I was just tired, and when I opened them again
there was nothing there. I was so uneasy I went out to the living room!
I didn't have a fearful feeling like I would have if it were an evil
apparition, but I'd just never seen anything like that before so I was
understandibly uneasy. Every morning for about a week after that I had
the same uneasy feeling in the morning right after my husband went to
work because I could feel something was there in my bedroom with me.
Not long after, we had to put my Grandma in a nursing home and brought
home her cat to live with us as she could not have a cat in the nursing
home. I thought that if something was in my apartment, he would
definatelly let me know, but to this day he never has. He does,
however, play with his tail as if someone is tugging on it. Maybe he is
just playing though. Well, recently lost my job and I cannot find a new
one so my husband and I are moving to the twin cities in Minnesota. He
has already gotten another job and we had been talking about subleasing
our apartment. It was then the funny stuff started to happen. I brought
my husbands clock radio that was in storage so I could listen to a talk
radio discussion while preparing dinner. I was home alone at the time,
and after the discussion was over, I turned the radio off. Not long
after, I heard people talking, and thinking they were our neighbors and
being the nosy neighbor I am, I went to eavesdrop. But as I walked
through the kitchen, I realized it was the radio, which I distinctly
remembered turning off. I turned it off and blamed it on faulty wiring.
That evening, we were getting ready to show our apartment to the people
who were thinking about taking over our lease for us. All of a sudden,
a small table lamp had started flickering. I thought nothing of it and
screwed the bulb in more, and for the time it stopped. When the men
came close to the light though, it flickered again. I checked the cord
and nothing was wrong, and the bulb was tight. I still thought nothing
of it though. Today, however, my radio turned on all by itself again,
and I hadn't had it on all day. I turned it off, and asked my husband
if he'd ever had problems with the radio turning itself on by itself
before. He said no, so I kinda wonder if we don't have a ghost who
either doesn't want us to leave or doesn't want these new people to
move in. I told the ghost that may or may not be there that they could
come with us to our new home seeing as though it didn't bother us at
all, but we'll just have to see if anything else happens. I almost hope
it does because if this is a ghost, it is obviously a kind one.<br>

Hi all&nbsp; nothing too scary here,not long after we were married my
wife and i purchased an 8 room house,we had two siamese cats,i would go
to bed early due to my job.After getting into bed,i would&nbsp; feel
one of the cats jump onto the bed and feel her walking across the bed
and lay down,i would open my eyes and look no cat was there,thought i
was imagining things until one day my wife mentioned the same thing was
happening to her.Sometimes one or both cats would be sitting at the
bottom of the stairs just staring upstairs,and you could tell just by
their movements,that they were sorta scared,one would sometimes start
to venture up the steps only to get about halfway and quickly come back
down.After my wife passed i would frequently smell a body powder she
favored-the smell would be strong and last awhile-There was a night
light in the kitchen which shown into a hall<br>
mirror and the light reflected onto a wall in a front room,i would <br>
see a shadow on the wall as if someone or something was passing between
the light and the mirror,i would also see very tiny lights floating
around the front room.<br>
We had friends who we would visit in Maryland,shorty after moving into
the neighborhood, a neighbor asked her if the elderly woman she sees in
the rocking chair at a second story window was her mother,<br>
the neighbor replied there is no one here but my husband and
children.She would come home from running errands and find the front
door standing open,she would call her husband home from work,he would
find nothing amiss,he would tell her she just wasn't being careful and
she was not making sure the door was locked when she left,one time she
called him home and the two dobermans and a german shepherd just
started whining and refused to go upstairs,he could not even drag them
up.Not long afterwards they went upsatirs like nothing ever
happened,they also had the missing items&nbsp; the items would show up
somewhere else,one day the wife went for her car keys as she need to
get the kids to school you guessed it car keys were nowhere to be
found,She started scolding whoever or whatever was doing this,she said
i need my keys i have to get the kids to school,she heard a jingle in
the dining room and when she went in there were the keys big as life on
the dining room table,breaking light bulbs and the usual things like
that went on there on a regular basis,they have moved long ago from
this house.<br>
I live a very short distance from Gettsyburg,Pa so i might have some more ghostly stories later<br>
Thanks for listening<br>

VA Haunting <br>
<br>
By: camelotsmaiden@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
First let me say, I love your website!.&nbsp; I read all the stories on
here and now I would like to add an experience of my own.&nbsp; I swear
that every word of this story is true as best I can remember
it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many, many moons ago, when I was 12 in the early 70's
we (my mom, dad and 2 sisters) moved from a suburb in Maryland to a 2
story farmhouse in the small town of Lancaster VA.&nbsp; The house gave
me and my sisters the creeps right from the jump but my Dad assured us
that it was just because it was old and that we would get used to
it.&nbsp; Well, I never did 'get used to it' and by the time my parents
moved out some 10 years later, neither did they.&nbsp; I think I was
the first to notice strange things happening in the house. Doors
opening by themselves, cabinet door opening and closing, the typical
stuff but I'll never forget this night or several others as long as I
live.&nbsp; I was somewhat of a night owl even though my parents made
me go to bed at 9:00 pm.&nbsp; I rarely fell asleep before 11:00
(unlike my sister that I shared a bed with who fell asleep almost
immediately).&nbsp; I always heard weird noises throughout the house
when I would wake up late at night.&nbsp; I told my parents about it
and they said it was an old house and it creaked and stuff due to age
and settling.&nbsp; Being only 12, I bought this for awhile but then
things began to get creepier.&nbsp; My first major experience with one
(that's right, I was later to discover there was more than one ghost in
this town) of the ghost was when I was about 13.&nbsp; My sister and me
had gone to bed as usual at 9:00pm and as usual, she was sound asleep
while I laid there. It had to be around 10 -10:30.&nbsp; It was pretty
light in our room bec se of the full moon shining through the two
windows but for some reason I remember feeling kinda scare or nervous
which was not really unusual for me because like I said, never really
felt comfortable in that house.&nbsp; Anyway, I was lying there trying
to fall asleep when my sister suddenly sat up and yell "Why did you hit
me on my back"&nbsp; Of course, I hadn't hit her.&nbsp; I hadn't even
touch her.&nbsp; We shared a double bed and we always slept back to
back.&nbsp; She faced to the hallway and me to the window.&nbsp; I
hadn't even accidentally bumped her.&nbsp; I had been lying perfectly
still.&nbsp; Of course she didn't believe me and yelled at me to cut it
out.&nbsp; I yelled something something back and turned back toward the
window.&nbsp; But the more I laid there the more scared I got.&nbsp;
Who could have hit her?&nbsp; I knew for sure I hadn't and since her
back was to me facing inside the room it wasn't like someone could have
come in and done it.&nbsp; As these thoughts were going through my head
something touched me.&nbsp; 'He' tapped me 2 times in succession on the
back of the head.&nbsp; tap tap pause tap tap.&nbsp; The feeling was so
distinct I could feel the fingernail.&nbsp; I literally froze.&nbsp; I
didn't know what to do.&nbsp; I was almost positive it was not my
sister because in order for her to do it she would have to move and I
would have felt the bed shift (she was a somewhat large girl).&nbsp;
The taps were on the back of my head so the 'person' would have had to
be directly behind me in order to hit me there.&nbsp; I didn't move and
prayed that it would go away when it started again.&nbsp; tap tap pause
tap tap.&nbsp; This time I bounced out of bed and spun toward the
door.&nbsp; Nothing! no one!&nbsp; Okay, now I'm petrified.&nbsp; I
knew what I felt, that coupled with what my sister had accused me of
doing had my mind whirling.&nbsp; I settled back in bed but of course
sleep was out of the question.&amp;n p; I decided to lay on my back so
that 'it' couldn't touch the back of my head and pulled the blankets to
my chin (why we think and thin piece of cloth can protect us, I'll
never know but I was only 13).&nbsp; As I laid there, I didn't close my
eyes all the way.&nbsp; Instead I left them just opened enough so I
could see.&nbsp; Within about 5 minutes or so I saw him.&nbsp; At least
I believe I did.&nbsp; He was a tall lanky older man with brown baggy
pants, sort of like they wore in the 30's or 40's and a white shirt
that was half tucked in and half not.&nbsp; He wasn't solid but not
exactly transparent either but he did have a 'glow' about him.&nbsp; He
was at the foot of our bed making his way from my sisters side of the
bed toward my side.&nbsp; At this point, I was soooo scared I could
hardly breathe.&nbsp; I watched him make his way to my side of the bed
and I saw his hand reach for my leg, I kicked my leg out and he
instantly vanished.&nbsp; I started shaking and crying and covered my
head under the blanket.&nbsp; How I feel asleep that night I'll never
know but when I woke up in the morning and told my parents, they told
me it was just my imagination but I promise you it was not and before
they finally moved out of that house they believed me too.&nbsp; I
later saw a picture of the man who we bought the house from and it
looked similiar to the man I saw that night.&nbsp; Come to find out,
the previous owners were 2 brothers and that the one brother had passed
away and that's why the house was being sold.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are
many more detailed events that I could tell you but I'll save those for
another day as this has gotten very long.&nbsp; Thanks for giving us
somewhere to share our experiences and feel free to post this because
every word of it is true.<br>

Experience on a Gravel Road<br>
<br>
By: Jcreason1988@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I had a Christmas gift exchange after school one day. I was taking one
of my friends home afterwards. She lives in the country on a gravel
road, just past some railroad tracks. We got to her house just fine.
After I dropped her off and backed out of her driveway and passed the
tracks, I felt as if I didn't have control of the wheel, like someone
also had their hands on the wheel. I glanced in my rearview mirror and
saw that the back window had fog covering it. There was no fog before I
passed the RR tracks. I turned the corner, and suddenly I felt like I
had control over the car again, and the fog was gone! <br>

Ilion NY<br>
<br>
By: SNY48002@Allstate.com<br>
<br>
hello:&nbsp; I have submitted a couple stories here before about the area I live in and grew up in.&nbsp; <br>
This story happened probably around 1977-78 as I was just a kid.&nbsp;
This is absolutely true and I have not thought about it in years which
is odd as I'm always reading these stories and watch all the shows I
can on TV.<br>
In Ilion there is a old dairy.&nbsp; I myself never seen it open and
for some reason the building fascinated us kids.&nbsp; We were always
thinking about ways to get in it and explore.&nbsp; Nothing
destructive, just explore. There were 6 or 7 of us from the neighbor
hood on our little bikes. Most of them with "banana seats" (remember
them? LOL).&nbsp; The building was a couple blocks and across a ball
field from our houses.&nbsp; We were down there doing the usual, and
riding around the broken and time worn parking lot of the place.&nbsp;
Suddenly upon looking up in the window we saw a woman.&nbsp; She had on
a high neck, puffy shoulder top and her face was deathly white and her
pitch black hair was puffed on the sides and a bun right on top.&nbsp;
She seemed not too be looking at us but staring ahead.&nbsp; Well let
me tell ya folks out there, I don't think any of us ever peddled
faster, in fact I think I beat my bike home.&nbsp; <br>
We got to Chris's house and found his older brother Dave and told him
what we seen and he said it was probably a derelict.&nbsp; Now, after
explaining what that was too us, we let it go and never went back to
the building again.<br>
Now that I'm older I am convinced it was a ghost.&nbsp; I know what I
seen, and why would a derelict (or in today's terms, crack head), be
dressed in 1800's garb?<br>
I have the old body goose pimples writing this and can see her plain as
day.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know the history of that dairy and wish my dad
was still around to ask.&nbsp; I will try to look it up one day.&nbsp;
Thanks so much for letting me share another central NY story.&nbsp; I
have seen a few others posted here also.<br>

More to Tell<br>
<br>
<br>
By: dorothymphillips@comcast.net<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Hi, this is the second time I have had a story to tell about my house.
The first time around I heard something along with a flash of light and
my cat was seeing things. This time my brother and I are hearing things
and I FELT something. Ok, my brother and I were talking about some of
the weird things that happen when we are alone at the house. We both
have said that we heard our names being called when no one was actually
calling us. I could be upstairs in my room and swear that I heard my
mom's voice calling me from the bottom of my stairs, only to go down
and find that no one called me or that she wasn't even in the house. It
has also sounded like my brother a couple of times but no one is ever
there. My brother has also had this happen to him. We also hear
footsteps in the attic which is directly above the computer room. It
sounds like someone is stomping around up there but we usually just
ignore that. My brother also told me that he was in the computer room
one day and was playing a video game when he heard footsteps coming
down the steps about to come into he room where he was. He said it
sounded like it was almost half way down and he just turned off his
game and left before he could see anything happen. Thats freaky because
those are the stairs to my room! And the last thing that happened,
happened to me. I was all alone in the house except for my cat. I was
in the living room downstairs and I was standing up cutting paper for
invitations I was making. As I was standing there, all of a sudden I
felt something poke me in my back. It literally felt like someone took
their finger and poked me in my back. It didn't feel like back pain or
a muscle spasm or anything like that, it felt like a quick poke. It
really spooked me and I DID NOT want to turn around. But of course I
had to, and when I did, nothing was there. So I just decided to sit
down on the couch so that nothing could poke me again. Well thats all I
have this time. Hopefully I will not have anything else to tell!<br>

Chilly Sensation<br>
<br>
By: danny@houseofgraphics.com<br>
<br>
My experience was short but scary,i was about 14 or 15 years old it
took place at the house i grew up in, my parents bought it in 1976 but
it was already about 30-35 years old!<br>
now even though my parents were told that the previous owner was an old
man who passed away in the kitchen it was not his spirit.<br>
i woke up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and the
whole house was pitch black,so i went and headed back to my bedroom the
door way faced our hallway, so as i was about to climb back into bed
and looked down the hallway to see a figure which appeared to be a
women maybe in her mid 20's to early 30's.<br>
i wasnt able to see her face as she was walking away from me she was
wearing somekind of football jersey as a night gown and socks and had
shoulder lenth wavy hair,i grew up with only brothers so the only women
in the house was my mother but she has long straight hair and doesnt
own a football jersey of anykind,i also noticed the further it got the
more transparent it became, the only room at the end of the hall was
the bathroom which i had just comefrom and for the timing that took
place there is no way anyone could have walked by me,plus i shut the
door after i used it and as i layed there under the covers scared i
didnt hear any door or see anylight go on. <br>
i am now in my late 20's but i still remember that chilly sensation i
got when i saw that&nbsp; some never believed my story fully,but for
those who have experienced a ghost know what i mean!<br>

Old Hollomans Road<br>
<br>
By: Allxstar07@cs.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Hi, my name is ashleigh. I am 16 and live not too far from old
Hollomans road in mesquite. The road is near a old school that was
built 2000 or so ( Horn High School. ) The entry way is very close to
the school, but as you mentioned has been closed off. If you go around
by Lawson road, there is a near field right off the road where you can
park and cannot be seen. If you walk over a bridge and down into a
ditch the other entry is there, also blocked off, but you are able to
climb over. We walked down, and we heard rustling in the trees, and
such. When we looked to the left there was a field of cows all running
the opposite away. We stopped by a old entry way to what looked like a
old house or something. There was pure black, and we heard footsteps in
the leaves about 50 yards away, but it is nearly impossible to enter
through the other entry, we were so afraid we walked back to the way we
came, and never looked back. Also, some friends went out there the
night before. We saw a old tree that had been broken down in the path
of the road but they said it wasnt there when they went. <br>

Security Guard<br>
<br>
By: jakebetty@milwpc.com<br>
<br>
I was a security guard at a former school, convent church gym all in
the same building.&nbsp; It was being converted into
condominiums.&nbsp; One night, in broad daylight a window was
shattered.&nbsp; It faced a courtyard no one could reasonalby get
inside.&nbsp; Later on that night about 3am I saw in the former convent
a form, not a figure. I was dumbfounded.&nbsp; I couldn't move. I was
in a cold sweat the hair on my arms stood up.&nbsp; I have no idea what
i saw, but it was definitely a paranormal experience.&nbsp; An
apartment building that I used to live in had something go and unlock a
door in the unit next to mine.&nbsp; no one stayed in that unit very
long.&nbsp; Other tenants saw somone walking around the corner, I would
hear something beating on the dryer and racing down the stairs opening
doors etc.I would also find screws on the floor without any place for
them to be.&nbsp; While I don't believe in ghosts there must be
something to all of this.<br>

When I was Little<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
<br>
When I was a little boy, we had a ghost in our house, and her name was
Sara. She died at the hospital in town and followed us home when i was
born. She thought that i was her son. She would pick me up at night and
cradle me until i fell asleep. When my cousin babysat me, she would
torment me like lock me out of the house, and Sara didn't like that.
She would scare my cousin and she got the picture that there was a
ghost in the house. Sara would jiggle the doorknob when i would be in
the same room as my cousin, and i was asleep. One night, my cousin was
asking herself what was doing that, and i heard her, and i said THE
LADY IS DOING THAT. My cousin didn't bother me again.&nbsp; So about 2
weeks ago, my mom hired a person to come over to cleanse the house, (I
would rather not disclose any names), and Sara came back to tell me
goodbye when she found out that her son was waiting for her on the
other side. We also decided to go over a psycic's house, and she told
us that I was her son from the "past life". This story is 100% true,
and i even experienced it myself.<br>

The Evil One<br>
<br>
By: jbrown@dap.com<br>
<br>
<br>
When I was in college I lived in the off campus dormitories, in New
York.&nbsp; The dorms were set in a very secluded section&nbsp; of
Riverdale ( I think) . My girlfriend and I were told that the dorms
were haunted by an entity they called " the evil one". There are many
stories and rumours about how it came to be haunted, but one
instance&nbsp; stands out in my mind.&nbsp; A group of about four of us
were in one room just hanging out one night. The window to this room
faced the front of the building and in front was one very tall lamp
post. The driveway entering the area was a great big circle and this
lamp post was the only one on the street. Well, as I said we were all
just hanging out, none of us were drunk or high or anything at all. One
of the guys, Jason calls us over to look out of the window and there on
the ground below the lamp post was the clear, unmistakable shape of a
skull ! By some freak happenstance either the lamp post or the moon
light cast a shape on the ground of a skull, complete with eye sockets,
nose socket, everything! It was very clear and detailed. From where we
were we tried to determine if perhaps the shape had been drawn onto the
glass of lamp, but both the height of the lampost and the detail that
the actual shape contained convinced us that wasnt the case. It was as
if the skull was there to confirm the presence of "the evil one"

Things that go Bump in the Night<br>
<br>
<br>
By: sassy3220042001@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Hello, im new to your site and very interested in the supernatural, I
want to tell you a story about when i was a child. My earliest memories
of the things that happened was when i was 7 or 8. My mom being a
single parent had to work alot and we(being my older sister and my
younger brother) were left at home alot to take care of each other.I
never really saw anything but man the noises we would here! I remember
falling asleep on the couch one night and hearing this popping noise
and it was the sliding glass door locking and unlocking that really
scared the crap outta me! My mother has a picture of my uncle in her
romm and he died before i was born she keeps it on her dresser.<br>
&nbsp;One night when i was alittle older i was home alone my sister and my brother went <br>
to stay at friends and i once again fell asleep on the couch again and
i heard this strange noise in front of me and at the time my moms house
hadnt been built onto and the fireplace was in front of the couch i
fell alseep on, when i sat up to see what the noise was i looked at the
mantel on the fire place and there sat the picture of my uncle that had
past away, facing me like he was looking at me.<br>
&nbsp; When my mother came home, she was mad at me cause she thought
that i had put the picture there and it i started crying it wasnt me it
did it by itself. Of course she didnt believe me! That was just the
start of things to come! Then me and my siblings would be sitting in
the living room watching tv and all the sudden the dryer would turn it
self on! Then it would go off, and we would just sit there scared to
death cause we didn know what to do.Then as time past the toilet
started flushing on its&nbsp; own.<br>
&nbsp;We finally realized that what ever it was, wasnt gonna hurt us or
atleast never tried, when the things would happen as we got older we
would just laugh and say guess who ever it is needed to do their
laundry or had to go to the bathroom.<br>
&nbsp;Then when i was about 16 i guess my brother being nine years
younger was sleeping in the new addition in the house and he said he
woke up and saw a man dressed all in black sitting beside him just
looking at him.My mother who never believed&nbsp; us told him he was
just dreaming and to go back to sleep, then my sister who by this time
was married and had come home to visit one morning woke up scared to
death and said oh my god did you see that my dressed in black! Well no
one had told her about what my brother had saw and when my brother
heard her he said i have saw it to! At that time my mother had started
to believe us! Cause how could 2 of them have seen the same image but
at different times, me myself have never seen it, All i have had happen
is hear all the scary things.<br>
&nbsp;I am 34 years old and still when i go and visit my mother ion the
same house i hear things from times to time, i never get scared anymore
its almost like an old friend.<br>

It All Starts Again<br>
By:&nbsp; victoria@vprice61.wanadoo.co.uk<br>
<br>
So it all started when I was 5, now 20 years later nothing has changed.
My family still has to live with the paranormal. I now life with my
husband and 2 children in a very nice small house not more then 5 miles
from where I lived with my parents, brother and sister.<br>
I have lived in this house now for more then 2 and a half years and it
seemed ghost or spirit free until about 3 months ago when things
started to happen. As you may have read from my 3 previous encounters
that I have written about you will know that we always seem to
experience the paranormal around our family, and yes before you start
to wander about the authenticity of these stories, they are real. The
first encounter was approached by the police authorities and was
snatched up by a national news paper. After this it has just continued.<br>
My mother is or was very ill and was taken to a local hospital about 3
years ago.When they could not help her she was then moved to a hospital
towards the south east of England. Unforchenutly this was no good for
my mother either so she was then moved to another hospital up in
Liverpool. After my mother left there house 3 years ago my father told
me that the ghostly movements, sightings and sounds was slowly fading.
He said they were happy, that they seemed to have settled. This I could
not understand but left it at that.<br>
In June this year my father declared his love for my mothers best
friend, movedin with her and asked for a divorce from my mother, still
stuck in hospital and still very ill. You see my mother is a manic
depressive and was bought down a lot of the time by my father the
control freak &#8220;GOD&#8221; as we nicknamed him<br>
Now as I mentioned at the beginning of this entry I have been
experiencing strange things in my house for the past 3 months, but not
just me also my husband. We first started seeing a figure walking up
and down the stairs in the hallway of the house. Where we sit in our
front room you can see onto the stairs. We would be watching TV and see
a figure out of the corner of our eye. This could have been our
imagination and as a skeptic I like to see things right in front of me
rather then start to think silly things were happening in my house.
Stuart my husband went upstairs to get the dirty clothes from the
landing, He told me that when he was leaning over to reach the clothes
that he was startled by the sight of legs walking quickly past him.
When he came down stairs he was white and couldn&#8217;t believe what he
thought he had seen. Trying to believe him I then walked upstairs to
check on the children to see if it could have been either them but they
were sound asleep in there beds. Plus our floor boards creek so if one
of them had of been on the landing it would of made a noise<br>
After that more things started to happen. I was singing in my front
room to myself and this box that my little girl had made me at school
fell off the shelf and all of its contents came out. Again this could
have been anything but this wasn&#8217;t the first time that this would
happen. I had just come home from work and I started the fill the
kettle up for a coffee when I crapped myself as a bottle from the top
kitchen curbed fell and hit the dirty plaits, as I went to see what had
fallen I noticed that the cubed door was open. Now in our house we
always make a point of shutting the doors as we have 2 cats. I had not
even got myself a cup and the door was open. Yes I do think to myself
could it of been me but still I can not remember opening that cubed
door.<br>
About a week later I was brushing my teeth in the upstairs bathroom and
a jug I use to bath the cats fell and hit the toilet seat with what
seamed like great force. I tried to imitate it by dropping the plastic
jug again but could not achieve the loudness of the sound it had mad on
its own.<br>
Also that week I had my best friend over for a coffee on evening. Meg
was sat by my fish tank and I was sat by the computer (the other end of
the room) reading my emails and my phone hit the floor. I was near Meg
but I know she would not of done this on purpose as she hates anything
to do with ghosts. So far there had been lots of things falling and not
enough evidence to show me there was something in my house until Boxing
Day morning.<br>
For Christmas this year, as a stocking filler we bought my 4 year old
son a batman clock with a batman style pendulum from Woolworths. Half
way through the day I knocked it off the living room table and it hit
the floor. The pendulum didn&#8217;t work after that. I felt so bad for my
son as he had really loved that clock. My husband took it apart and
tried everything he could to get this thing to work. The clock part
worked fine. Stuart took it up to our bedroom and put it on his bedside
table. Feeling really bad for my son I sat there for a while trying to
get it to work, to click like it had before I broke it, but nothing.
Every time I tried to get it to move it got stuck one side so I gave
up. Stuart and I went to bed that night so tired and so ready for
sleep. We must have been tired as I don&#8217;t remember my head hitting the
pillow. I was then woken up by a clicking noise at about 3am and
without thinking told Stuart to put the bloody clock away as the
ticking was really loud. He woke with the noise too and put his finger
on the ticking pendulum to stop it from moving as this had worked when
the clock had been working that day. He tock his finger from it and it
continued to move. Now we were seared as the clock was well and truly
broken, so he put the clock away in one of his bedside draws. I&#8217;m not
kidding when I say I wanted to leave the house when I realized what was
going on, but Stuart cuddled up to me and we went back to sleep.<br>
The next day I went upstairs to see if it was working again but when I
pulled the clock out of the draw it was that same as it had been when I
tried to fix it. I just didn&#8217;t work. A few days ago Stuart went
upstairs to fetch some dirty washing from our room and as he went in,
before he turned on the light he herd the ticking noise again, and as
he tells me the pendulum was ticking. I then went upstairs to see for
myself but as I entered to room it was no longer ticking.<br>
<br>
I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on in my house, do you? I phoned my mum to
ask her what she thought and she say as my dad has moved out of the
house that they lived in, it has moved on to me. So does this mean it
will get livelier? I don&#8217;t know, but what I do know is, what happened
in my parents house was not something anyone should have to live with.
I really hope it doesn&#8217;t get as bad as that.<br>

Belle Isle Station<br>
<br>
<br>
By: whizbangokie@sbcglobal.net <br>
<br>
My daughter currently works at one of the retail buisnesses in the
Belle Isle Station (OKC, OK) and she has told me about many occurances
that have happened in her building.&nbsp; They have one ghost that they
refer to as Charlie.&nbsp; They have only seen him once but have had
many interesting things take place overnight.&nbsp; One night, the fire
alarm went off and as a requirement ADT has to call a member of mgmt to
respond along with the police and fire department's.&nbsp; On this
particular night two members of mgmt arrived at the store to notice
that there was no fire.&nbsp; ADT was called to find out how the alarm
was activated.&nbsp; An ADT rep stated that the fire panel in receiving
had been pulled.&nbsp; The store has the type of fire alarm boxes that
you have to grip from the bottom and pull up to activate.&nbsp; The
were no signs of breaking and entering so the police asked to watch the
video.&nbsp; While watching the video, the police, firemen, and members
of mgmt saw a white flash near the fire panel and then the alarm
sounded.&nbsp; This was the one of the first of many events that have
happened in the building.<br>

Haunting<br>
<br>

<br>
We have a haunted site to add to the Chilhowie, Virginia<br>
Our home is Apperson House, built in 1869 by a Civil War doctor, Dr.
John Apperson.&nbsp; At least one spirit occupies the formal dining
room, and childrens toys left in the room turn themselves on in the
middle of the night and cannot be turned off until the batteries are
removed and the toy is removed from the room. It is definitely not a
hostile spirit! They like to close the heavy swinging door to let me
know they are there.<br>
Another sighting of a woman in a blue dress was reported when the house
was for sale. She is upstairs in the gallery and turns lights on in one
of the bedrooms. She appeared to a couple looking to purchase the home
and frightened them so badly the house was taken off the market and
sold privately.<br>
The spring house here is the oldest known structure remaining in
Chilhowie. We believe, but cannot confirm, that the house was built on
an even older foundation. My (non ghost-believeing) husband reported he
saw the upstairs ghost last week when he looked where our young son was
pointing.<br>
Incidentally, the Abijah Thomas house (Octagon house) is being restored by new owners at this time.<br>

Rosamond, Calif. One early morning sitting on the patio a black figure
of something flew across the top of our back fence. The dog reacted but
not with a bark just nolegement of something there.<br>
No sound was made just movement that was faster then anything living could make.<br>
In our home on the same lot I had put about a dozen small garden flags
away and when I went to change the one that was hanging my dozen were
gone. Have looked everywhere no where to be found.<br>
My husband (same house) took his favorite sweat shirt out to wear then
decided he was going to wear another one instead. Left the first one
folded on the bed and we left for the day. Came home not thinking about
it being left on the bed, but went to put it on a few days later and it
is no were to be found. <br>
All my life I have been aware of other things out and about. But it&#8217;s those pesky one&#8217;s that<br>
Drive me nuts. We have only lived there for a year.<br>

A Time to Remember<br>
<br>
<br>
By: medic5329@optonline.net<br>
<br>
As a kid I my mother had a rocking chair that I was told someone died
in, I always felt strange toward that chair as if it had a presence in
it.&nbsp; As I got older I forgot a lot of the strange things that
happened to me. Tow years ago I rekindled my weird senses.&nbsp; My
kids wanted to go to Salem Mass. and as one into the strange I said
"let's go" so a week before Halloween we went on a road trip that would
change the way I viewed the world.&nbsp; As a retired Paramedic I dealt
in the real world of absolutes but this would change.<br>
I loved the town of Salem the moment we set foot in it but I also felt
a bit of sorrow.&nbsp; While going through town I took a lot of photos
with my new digital camera.&nbsp; My middle child, a girl, saw two
joined tombstones and said "look Siamese Twins".&nbsp; I told her they
were husband and wife and since she was so pulled to them I took a
photo along with a bunch of others.&nbsp; The photo before this one and
after are clear as a bell with no orbs or streaks on them but this one
was wierd.&nbsp; The stone has what looks like a finger print of
glowing white but the next photo taken moments later without me
touching the lens or camera is of an old faded Buick dealer sign and it
is totally clean and right.&nbsp; I didn't look at the time at the
photos but that stone kept drawing my attention.&nbsp; I noted the name
and wehen I got home and looked at the photo I was stunned by the orbs
etc..&nbsp; I did somne research and the stone is of Bridget Bishop
[one of the women accused of witchcraft and hung] daughter and son in
law.&nbsp; No wonder the wierd energy.&nbsp; <br>
After looking at the photos I spoke to my sister in law who went with
us and she showed me a photo taken with her film camera of my middle
daughter again an orb or floating whitish object is in it between the
photographer and us.&nbsp; I have taken many photos with this camera
and have gotten so spectacular shots of energy or whatever but this
nioght opened the door to something that would scare the daylights out
of me.<br>
While researching ghostly stuff I started to smell cigarette smoke,
sinbce we moved in I would smell it on and off but no one else seemed
to notice.&nbsp; The smell would get more rgular and usually late at
night while on line.&nbsp; No one in the house smokes and the child of
a reforemd smoker who is alergic to smoke I am sensitive.&nbsp; The
smell was there but not the wattery eyes or runny nose.&nbsp; The
former owner was a heavy smoker and part of what killed her was the
smoking, her room is next to the computer room.<br>
I smelled the smoke then got the feeling of being watched.&nbsp; It got
really strange.&nbsp; I got thrown off line 4 or 5 times but only as if
the ISP dropped me.&nbsp;&nbsp; The screen didn't flicker just loss of
the internet and I had to reconnect and annoyance at best.&nbsp; I said
out loud "Show yourself danm it". <br>
I never knew they would do it.&nbsp; The lights went off/on 3 or 4
times, I kept getting thrown off line but the screen never
flickered.&nbsp; It was as if they wanted me not talking about
them.&nbsp; If there were a power issue my screen would have flickered
of someother thing would have happened but only the lights as if
someone flicked the switch 3 or 4 times.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Spooked but excited I went to the old owners bedroom, next door, and
took photos, then I went around the floor in other rooms.&nbsp; What I
found shocked me.&nbsp; In a poster for the movie Titanic there are
folds as if a face pushed it's way from the wall and in the photo it
looks like a whitish woman's face.&nbsp; Not only was it seen on the
poster but the reflection is on the glass of one of my kid's
caracture.&nbsp;&nbsp; I still get unnerved thinking of that
night.&nbsp; I finally said "go away and leave me alone " , and things
settled down.&nbsp; The poster has the rinkles or creases easily seen
yet the poster never was damaged or folded.&nbsp; <br>
This night led me to find a local hot spot and take more photos but that is a story for another time.&nbsp; <br>

So about 4 1/2 years ago i was a senior in highschool about to graduate
so spring was on its way. It was about 4 a.m. when tornado sirens were
going off in my town and firemen and police cars were flying down my
neighborhood roads yelling into their loud speakers and turning on
their sirens warning people to wake up and take cover. As i was growing
up in this town we'd always have one or two tornado warnings every
spring and summer but they were never really made out to be such a big
deal. So because of all the sounds and the color of the sky i was
extremely scared. For comfort before i ran down to the basement I
grabbed my rosary that was hanging on my lamp next to my bed and
slipped it into my pocket. Im not catholic but my highschool sweetheart
at the time was and had made it for me in an art class he took at his
catholic school. Well long story short the whole ordeal was overwith
the tornado ended up touching down in the next town over after it had
blown ovr my town. So I went back to bed. Still scared that the
warnings would come back i held the rosary in my hand until i fell
asleep again. When morning came and it was time for me to get ready for
school i woke up and did my routine which was head straight to the
bathroom. Once i woke up enough i realized that i had fallen asleep
with the rosary in my bed so i went back to find it and put it up where
it wouldnt get lost. well i couldnt find it anywhere! i had checked to
see if it had snagged on my pajamas or fallen off of them on my way to
the bathroom. i looked everywhere. my mom even helped me look.&nbsp;
well i had to get ready so i gave up and decided to look again when i
got home after school. just before i walked out of my bedroom for the
last time that morning i saw it. it was hanging on my cordless phone
cradle that was hanging on my wall right next to my bed. It looked like
a commercial photographer had hung it there for a photo shoot it was
hanging so perfectly. the cross was down in the front and the rest of
the beads were draped elegantly around the antenna. i know that there
is no possible way i could or even would have done that on my own in my
sleep. <br>
what or whom it could have been can be up to you.<br>

Help from Beyond<br>

<br>
I sustained a bad injury and had to retire from a job I loved.&nbsp;
the injury was to my back and with he pain I would get cramping of the
back that would at time double me over.&nbsp; Many times on the stairs
fro the 1st to the 2nd floor I would feel either a spasm or slipping
only to feel a hand push me and keep me from falling down the
stairs.&nbsp; At the top of the stairs is a door with a slit of about
1/2 inch you can see under and to the left is the upstairs bath.&nbsp;
Many nights i swear to have seen a set of black shoes like the kind
worn by Italian widows , you know the old women wearing all black, and
they were always in the same place.&nbsp; It was kind of comforting but
also kind of fearful.&nbsp; <br>
The woman who owned the house I live in died in the house in the room
next to the computer room.&nbsp; She was elderly and a heavy
smoker.&nbsp; Her husband too died in the house that they owned for
about 45 years or more.&nbsp; One fo the sons supposedly died of an OD
but I don't know if in the house.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
At times I get the feeling of being watched or someone looking over my
shoulder but the stranges is the smell of cigarette smoke and only in
the room next to her bed room.&nbsp; <br>

House Party<br>
<br>
<br>
By: tmanz@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
Hi. This is my second story submission to this site. (I'll have many more to<br>
come!)&nbsp; This is a short story about I house I went to only
once.&nbsp; In was invited to a party by a friend that was taking place
at the house of one of her friends while the parents were away in
Europe.&nbsp; This was in Willow Glen, CA.&nbsp; I don't remember the
street or address, but Willow Glen is an old, small little 'burb that
is now completely surrounded by San Jose, CA.&nbsp; The street was
lined with Victorian houses, my favorite!&nbsp; Upon entering the house
I felt "different" but I couldn't put my finger on it until I tried to
enter the hostesses bedroom where many people were hanging out.&nbsp;
When my friend opened the door to enter I was assaulted by a voice or
feeling in my head screaming "Get out! Get out! Get out!!!!"&nbsp; I
entered the room for a minute, everyone seemed fine in there, but I
couldn't get the "Get out!" <br>
feeling out of my head.&nbsp; I had to leave the room and apologized to some <br>
people nearby for my abrupt departure.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was then that I was told "it's <br>
ok, there are some people who don't like to be in here" and they went
on to explain that supposedly a schoolteacher hung herself in the room
many years <br>
back.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am still amazed to this day how that girl could live/sleep in that <br>
room, it was so overwhelming for me in there.<br>
That was one of the strangest houses I've ever been in.&nbsp; After
leaving the bedroom, I wandered the house to look at all the
collectibles etc.&nbsp; It was a beautiful house with beautiful antique
collections.&nbsp; They had several cats who were also the strangest
looking cats I'd ever seen...because their eyes were as big a saucers,
(you know, when it's dark or a cat is excited &amp; ready to pounce on
something the black part of their eyes gets really big and you can see
almost none of their iris/colored part of the eye) and their eyes
stayed that big no matter what light they were in, even some of the
rooms that were brightly lit.&nbsp; So odd.&nbsp; The rest of the
evening consisted of hearing stories from the brother about how
creepy/haunted his basement bedroom was, (but I was able to be in there
with no problems) and a bunch of us going upstairs with people daring
each-other to get some toys/games out of an attic crawl space that made
everyone nervous.&nbsp; A very odd night for sure, not what I had
expected to encounter at all.<br>
Thanks for reading my sotry.&nbsp; If anyone emails me please put
"Shadowlands Ghost" in your subject line or I will delete as junk mail.<br>

Loyola University of Chicago<br>
<br>
By: N0103E@comcast.net<br>
<br>
When I moved to Chicago to go to college, I found that it had a lot of
easily accessible haunted locales.&nbsp; While I had always been an
ameteur ghost hunter (exploring areas believed to be haunted according
to local legend with my friends), I'd never had an opportunity to
explore the location of a "known" haunting.<br>
That changed when I enrolled at Loyola University.&nbsp; Right on
campus, there was a piece of ghost legend.&nbsp; The Skyscraper
Building (formerly Mundelein College) is said to be haunted,
specifically it's thirteenth floor.<br>
Now, the legend goes that a priest and nun had an affair, the nun got
pregnant and hung herself when the priest wouldn't run away wth
her.&nbsp; Now there have been more than a few affairs between priests
and students at the school (two of my former professors were defrocked
for that very thing) so this story may have merit.&nbsp; However, I
don't know anything about the "true" story behind the nun's ghost.<br>
What I do know about is her footlocker.<br>
The theatre department is situated on the ninth floor, the uppermost
useable floor of the skyscraper building (unless rennovations have
fixed the "electrical problems" on those floors) and as a theatre major
I was often asked how I could take night classes with the ghost walking
around (it was often assumed that theatre classes were held on the
"haunted" floor).<br>
I didn't really pay it any attention until a friend of mine dragged a
prop home with her from the prop room.&nbsp; The prop was an old
footlocker that was used as a treasure chest in a play.&nbsp; It looked
enough like a treasure chest on it's own that it hadn't been touched by
the propmaster.&nbsp; The chest supposedly belonged to the nun of
legend and it, along with most of her property was still in the
posession of the school (on a later investigation, a friend and I would
find her old room with all of the furniture like new...the only real
"shock" on our amateur ghost hunt).&nbsp; The propmaster, director,
lighting designer, and stage manager all warned her that she should
probably just leave the chest alone.<br>
The next day, my friend brought the chest back to the prop loft.&nbsp;
She said that the chest was ice cold and that she woke up several times
to see a hooded figure, looking much like a nun, in a corner of her
room.&nbsp; In fact, the chest was still cold to the touch which is
quite a feat when spending a humid night in an un-air conditioned
Chicago apartment in august.<br>
If anyone wants the chest, the theatre staff may let you have it.&nbsp;
As recently as two years ago, another student tried to take it home
with similar results.&nbsp; It hasn't been used as a prop since and is
just taking up space in the storage area blow the theatre seats.<br>
P.S.&nbsp; Loyola's Kathleen Mullady Theatre is haunted by two
ghosts.&nbsp; One, a woman in blue who watches the play from the light
loft (believed to be Mrs. Mullady Herself) , and a shadowy figure that
falls from the catwalk to disappear in midair.<br>

My "Experience"<br>
<br>
<br>
By: Xo0deftones0oX@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
ok just to start this off, my name is Erin, i'm 17 years old, and live
in brookhaven, Ms. i've never believed in ghosts, iv always just been a
skeptic. even after what happened a couple of years back and in my room
a couple of nights ago.<br>
instance 1..::<br>
me and my grandma were VERY close, and when she died when i was 12, i
was devastated. the cause of death was cardiac arrest, but i believe
different. months and even weeks before she died her and my grandpa
would have really bad falling outs, and they would get so bad, she
would sleep in what used to be my room. To fully get what im about to
tell you, youl have to know the layout of her house. when you walked in
her front door, to the immediate left was her dressing room (her own
little private quarters i guess you could say) and a little ways down
but not too far on the right was her and my grandpas bedroom. almost
directly across the hall was the bathroom, and maybe a ft down was the
kitchen. the kitchen, my old bedroom, living room, and dining room were
all connected, then the dining room ran back into the hall. thru the
kitchen was the back door. so anyway, to the story. <br>
like i said, we were very close. when i was little,&nbsp; we lived
right up the hill from her, and i used to go there everyday to tell her
hi. we lived in natchez when she died. immediatly after her death, we
moved back to where we used to live. she died on a saturday, and until
her funeral and even after, i wouldnt say anything to anyone. when we
finally got setteled into our old house, i decided to walk down to
grandmas house. my granpa had it locked up because he moved in with
some other woman who he's now still living with and is about to get
married to. i walked down the hill, thru the gates, and past the circle
driveway, tears in my eyes the entire way. when i got to the front door
, it was of course locked, so me being as small as i was i slid in thru
the side door. (he didnt have it locked, just had a door stop holding
it shut so no one could get in.) as soon as i walked in the house i
started crying more, and didnt notice the deadly silence. i walked in
the livingroom, and layed down on her couch, cuddled up to a pillow,
and cried. This is where it gets weird. <br>
when my grandma walked around her house, she always had slippers on.
ALWAYS. she wasnt a very light woman, then again she wasnt incredibly
big either. kind of average. but she dragged her feet when she walked.
i needed to let you know that to tell you this next part. i had stopped
crying for a little while, or tried to, because my head was hurting,
and i sat up on the couch. i started looking around, noticing things,
when all of a sudden i heard footsteps coming down the hall. not heavy
ones, but light, slides. it freaked me out but i stayed, thinkin it was
just my 12 year old imagination gettin the best of me. i called out..
"hello?.. whoevers there needs to say something" no answer. then, her
light came on. the one at the very end of the hall, her dressing room.
i know no one else was in that house, it was too quiet. so being me, i
got up and slowly started down the hall to the room. the whole way it
wasnt cold, but it wasnt exactly warm. and more than usual, bein in her
house, i smelled her. like she was just right there in front of me.
again, didnt think anything of it. when i got to the room the lights
all of a sudden flicked out, and when i tried to turn them on again
they wouldnt. i walked to every room in the house and none of them
would turn on. which makes it creepier because if the lights were cut
off how did that one come on? well, after that, i heard the footsteps
again, felt a little breeze, and ran out of that house as fast as i
could. when i got back to my house, i busted thru my door and said mama
somethin just happened. and being that was the first thing&nbsp; id
said in a couple of days my mom kinda blew it off as my being
dilusional. then the next morning, she came in my room and asked
exactly what had happened, and when i told her she looked down. i asked
why and she said " i had a dream about your grandmother last night. she
told me to tell you everything would be ok and dont worry about a thing
and she loves you, and be her gone or not, your still her little
bandicoot." (that was her nickname for me because i loved crash
bandicoot) thats all she said and walked away.<br>
instance 2..::<br>
another instance.. was just the other night. like i said, im a skeptic,
and to me theres an explanation for everything. even when theres not.
but i was on this site, reading ghost stories. at about 1:00 i decided
id go to bed, and my cat, shaggy, decided to join. so i laid there for
a second, paranoid as hell because of the stories. i dont know why
because like i told you, i dont really believe. ive never had a reason
to. anyway, all of a sudden, my inscence fell of of my computer desk.
and this was VERY weird, because they were against my computer, there
was no way for them to fall off the direction they did, and my cat was
in eye sight dead to the world. i tried to blow it off but it was stil
in the back of my mind. right when i was dozing off i heard a low,
deep, moan. now this, theres many ways to explain. but when i looked in
the corner where my closet was i saw this grotesque monkey looking
thing. but it was in the shadows and it might have been something else
but theres nothing in that corner. then i thought i saw red eyes and i
just decided nope, im sleeping with mom tonight. but i didnt get to.
she once again passed it off as me being dilusional and went back to
sleep. and eventually i did too. <br>
those are my stories. you dont have to believe them, they might not
even sound believable because im not good at his whole story telling
thing. but yeh. i just need to know if it really IS just paranoia. and
if its not, theres no way ill end up believing that ghosts or spirits
exist unless i see them. personally, i do want to see one to end the
suspision. but maybe one day, and if not, id love to know how. thanks
for readin.<br>

My Ghost Experiences<br>
<br>
By: sprat40@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
in my childhood home there is i believe 2 spirits, one of a nice nature and the other more darker.<br>
when i was 6, i was up early one morning (4:30 ish) and i was watching
television, now the tv stood behind a thick heavy glass door which was
the end of our hallway. we had termites and whenever someone would walk
down the hallway there would always be a distinct creak. this
particular morning i heard footsteps down the hallway and the familiar
creek that usually accomponied. automatically i looked to the glass
door (which was a transparent glass) expecting to see my dad or mum but
the hallway was empty.. i had a kinda sick feeling in my stomach as i
looked down the hallway then the door, to my utter shock slowly opened
and then slammed shut very violently. it left the glass with a huge
crack down the middle. well i did what any 6 year old would do, scream
my lungs out and wake everyone in the house. they didnt believe me of
course and blamed me for the crack in the glass door. i slept with a
lamp in my room till i was 14 because i heard those footsteps every
night, seemingly coming towards my room. another morni when i was a bit
older i was in one of those deep sleeps where you dont dream, something
so cold touched my leg that i went from a laying down posistion to bolt
upright in under a second, you know how when you wake up and your all
groggy and it takes a bit to wake up properly? well i was as awake as a
person can be. it scared me but at the same time i got the feeling of
calm and like i was being watched over. the darker spirit, i had a very
scary encounter with that i still havent forgotten. i was 14 at the
time and i was home alone this night, i was watching tv and had the
feeling i was being watched which got me totally paranoid so i called
my mate for someone to talk to, i told him my thoughts of being watched
and he just told me i was being stupid and i made a passing comment
along the lines of "yea im not scared of this stupid peice of crap"
well id done it then. all of a sudden i felt very threatened, like i
was being attacked. my stomach felt like ice and i panacked, i ran
around the house but couldnt shake the overwhelming feeling that i was
being chased, attaked, every sense told me that i was in danger. a bowl
that was sitting on the bench exploded as i ran past it sending bits of
glass everywhere, i bolted out of the house and down the street where i
waited till i saw my parents car go into the driveway. i swear these
events are 100% true and my experiences in that house have spurred me
on to research the subject and thats how i found your site.<br>
