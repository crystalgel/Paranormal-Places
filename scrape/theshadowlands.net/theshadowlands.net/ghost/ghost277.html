<P><B>Eville/Ghost House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Wendy3170@webtv.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;Im not the best at writting stories, but ill do my best.Between
the</B>
<BR><B>years of 1992 &amp; 1994(or there abouts) My husband my 3 year old
and</B>
<BR><B>myself</B>
<BR><B>(plus i became preg. with our son)Rented us a house a couple of
blocks</B>
<BR><B>from Bosse field.</B>
<BR><B>At first there were subtle things that happened on and off.Our 55
gal.</B>
<BR><B>fish tank started a slow small leak&nbsp; that just did it&nbsp;
off and on for</B>
<BR><B>about an month.Then stoped without harm.</B>
<BR><B>My husband and i were on the outs, so he went to stay at his parents</B>
<BR><B>house and we stayed there.(this was early in our relashionship)As
i said</B>
<BR><B>little things would happen, but that we had no explanation for.
I stayed</B>
<BR><B>gone because I started noticing weird smal things goen on.Such as</B>
<BR><B>pictures comming up missing sounds from my basement stares(as if
someone</B>
<BR><B>was standing on them)etc.</B>
<BR><B>One day i came home and My back door was bolted shutt! I was starting
to</B>
<BR><B>think someone(like a bum) was stayen in my basement.My daughters
bed at</B>
<BR><B>the time wasent put together very well. And the bottom fell out</B>
<BR><B>occasionally.One evening, it sounded like the bed fell in and when
I got</B>
<BR><B>to it, it hadent.In the duration of all this time id had friends
there</B>
<BR><B>off and on. Who all have claimed to see shawdows are figures&nbsp;
here and</B>
<BR><B>there, and at the time I hadent told any one of the strange happinings.</B>
<BR><B>I showed my sister in law which I did tell after awhile how if&nbsp;
I put a</B>
<BR><B>chair against the back door, and left when i returned home later&nbsp;
it was</B>
<BR><B>moved a few inches away from he basement door.She never came back.I
had</B>
<BR><B>my brother and 2 of his friends come over(i called him up balling)
and</B>
<BR><B>*WE ALL*, went down to the basement to have a look around. We wanted
to</B>
<BR><B>see if in fact there was a bum slippen in and out of my basement.My</B>
<BR><B>bother brought a gun.</B>
<BR><B>So here we are quiet, tryen to listen when just as plane as&nbsp;
day&nbsp; we ALL</B>
<BR><B>looked up at the same time and eyes followed as it seemed someone
(not</B>
<BR><B>real, real, loud) ran across the floor&nbsp; upstairs. We all ran
up there.</B>
<BR><B>As we already knew nobody was there. Let me say also this was a
quiet</B>
<BR><B>street for the most part.</B>
<BR><B>So myself and my babys returned home one evening and as I was maken
my</B>
<BR><B>son his bottle.(My ketchen sink is next to the basement door)I could</B>
<BR><B>hear someone standing on what sounded like *always* The top stairs.
I</B>
<BR><B>quietly grabbed up my children, my son was in a bassanet carrier
grabbed</B>
<BR><B>the front door handle to get *the hell* out of there.And The Front
door</B>
<BR><B>was bolted shutt..Here we couldent get out.</B>
<BR><B>I called my mother whom everytime she was there she says nothing
ever</B>
<BR><B>happened.(even though she couldent explain the doors or any of it)She</B>
<BR><B>crawled through my bed room window.Slept on the couch and still
claims</B>
<BR><B>heard or seen nothing.Never the less That weekend we got outta there.</B>
<BR><B>Weve checked off an on throughout the years, and&nbsp; nobody stays
there for</B>
<BR><B>long..Im talken within just a few months.</B>
<BR><B>Now just last month i ran in to some old friends of mine who have</B>
<BR><B>recently moved in to THAT HOUSE. They told me they have been there
less</B>
<BR><B>than 2 months. They never knew about this house.Or that i lived
there.</B>
<BR><B>So when they were explanning where they moved.I finished the directions</B>
<BR><B>real quilck when the said by Bosse Field. I said omg that house
is</B>
<BR><B>haunted.They laughted.So I said had any weird crap happen to you.
They</B>
<BR><B>said no, but in the same breath said they just put a new washer
in the</B>
<BR><B>basment.Just about 2 weeks ago. And it just stopped working for
some</B>
<BR><B>reason..</B>
<BR><B>I said,&nbsp; Thats what Im talken about..</B>
<BR><B>I will get my nerve to go visitate with them soon.</B>
<BR><B>Maybe, but then again maybe not.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Im afraid it may leave with me</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
this time..........</B>
<BR><B>The oldest and strongest emotions of man kind is fear.</B>

<P><B>One of my Ghost Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: marklebo@comcast.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have submitted a story on this site before but since then I have
had another experience, here it goes.&nbsp; I'm in my late teens and during
the summer I stay home alone.&nbsp; One day around 11:00 am I used the
computer and out in the hallway out of the corner of my I saw a completely
black figure about 6 foot 5 inches tall and very skinny.&nbsp; When I glimpsed
around to make sure no one was in the house the figure was gone.&nbsp;
It happened to me about 4 more times over the next two weeks.&nbsp; I started
calling them The Shadowmen.&nbsp; Then one day when I was in the kitchen
I saw another shadowman, but this time when I looked around my shoulder
a can of soup fell onto the floor and the window was closed and the cat
was in the basement.&nbsp; Then one day I was with my friends in the woods,
keep in mind these are small woods and there are never any hunters or trappers
there, we were talking about ghost stories and I told them about The Shadowmen.
A minute later we heard a rustle in the bushes and out of the corner of
my eye I saw a Shadowman out of the corner of my eye, then when I turned
around to catch a glimpse it was gone.&nbsp; I asked my friends if they
saw that and one of them said yes and the rest looked at me like was crazy.&nbsp;
I'm not sure if these are spirits or just an overactive imagination, but
usually I don't imagine things like that.&nbsp; Since the experience in
the woods I haven't seen a Shadowman since, but you never know.&nbsp; I
could see one again anytime.</B>

<BR><B>The White Dog and Black Cat Figures</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: miss_attitude001@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>hello agian...my name is kara, and i have another story i would like
to share, this..encounter or whatever its called...took place in the kitchen...it
was about midnight or one in the mornin....my mother was asleep,i was on
the computer playing brian-teaser or something,and my dog,suzie (a collie)
was laying next to my chair...as i was playing my game, suzie started to
make a noise in between a bark and a growl....i looked to see what she
was staring at and she was looking in the kitchen (our house is little
but cozy) i couldnt see anythingso i took it as attention seeking and hushed
her...about 10 minutes later suzie was sitting in the corner directly across
from where i sat, and she made a deep growling noise that was unaturaul
to me and she bared her teeth..not at me, but towards the kitchen...i didnt
want to look for ( i admitt..fear) i thought i would see some one like
a burglar of some sort, i looked out of the corner of my eye, i saw a very
very large white dog, looked like a wolf-dog to me because it was so large...it
had eyes as blue as the sky and fur as white as snow...it didnt look threating..but
intimadiating...it just laid there by the recycling bin staring at me...suzie
whimpered and cought my attention...i looked at the corner of my eye and
the dog had gone...that night everything was so still...quiet....freaky
the way nothing seemed able to move..like a pause button had been invented
to freeze the noise after the dog had vanished....i went to my room to
lay down..but my room was piled with clothes,books,etc. so i decided to
go to my mother's room to sleep since her bed was a king size and clean...the
time passed me by as i laid there...1:30 am, 2:30 am, 3:30 am,all the way
to 4:30 am...i just stared at the wall with a back ground of my mother's
snores..i glanced at my mom's door for a second and there...perched on
the door was a dark cat figure...it had evil green eyes,fur as though it
had cought the dark glistening of night time...i stared at it for no more
than 10 minutes...i rubbed my eyes..it was gone...and it seemed as though
some one played the sound agian like the mute button wouldnt work...i looked
out the window on my left and saw a cat crossing the street and i decided
to dayz off...but something didnt seem right...it was like the tempature
dropped 20 degrees in the room...i didnt like it and neither did suzie
(she sleeps at the foot of mother's bed) she gave a very low growl&nbsp;
and came over to lay next to me...i pet her for a minute and glanced at
the hall way and saw what appeared to be a over grown house cat...i fell
asleep 10 minutes after that....i still dont know the connection between
the dark cat figures and the white dog...but if you happened to know i'd
like to hear from you...sorry if this is too long of story hope you enjoyed
reading it...</B>

<P><B>The Unexplained Footsteps</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: thatspants_007@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>One day last year me and my friend where in my house on our own.
I decided</B>
<BR><B>to make noodles for us to eat so I started to prepare them when
we heard</B>
<BR><B>noises upstairs but we just continued chatting. About 2 mins later
we heard</B>
<BR><B>it again and ignored it once more thinking it was just the floorboards.</B>
<BR><B>Suddenly about 5 mins later we heard it again but louder. The sound
was like</B>
<BR><B>there was someone in my house walking around upstairs and opening
and</B>
<BR><B>shutting doors but we were home alone so we thought we would go
and check</B>
<BR><B>but we were a little scared so we both got knives in our hands just
in case</B>
<BR><B>it was an intruder and crept up the stairs.</B>
<BR><B>When we got up we checked everywhere even behind doors and under
beds but</B>
<BR><B>there was no one!</B>
<BR><B>We were now really freaked out so we went downstairs and turned
some music</B>
<BR><B>on but we turned it up really loud and started to eat.</B>
<BR><B>Again about 10 mins later we heard footsteps but this time coming
up and</B>
<BR><B>down the stairs but not actually walking into the kitchen. Just
on the</B>
<BR><B>stairs.</B>
<BR><B>Now we were getting really scared so we went outside with knives
in our</B>
<BR><B>hands just to check our next door neighbours weren't in(I live in
a semi</B>
<BR><B>detached house) just in case it was them making the noise but then
i checked</B>
<BR><B>and remembered they were at their caravan for the weekend so it
couldnt be</B>
<BR><B>them!</B>
<BR><B>So we went inside again and immediately after we sat down again
we heard a</B>
<BR><B>loud drop as if something had been dropped and hit the floor but
we weren't</B>
<BR><B>going to go upstairs again so we went outside again and found my
friends mum</B>
<BR><B>and she came in and checked the house with us.</B>
<BR><B>We checked everywhere for about 5 mins. When we were convinced there
was no</B>
<BR><B>one there she asked me if anythign was missing and I said no, but
later that</B>
<BR><B>night I was going to bed and I noticed that one of my cuddly toys
was</B>
<BR><B>missing(yes i still have a cuddly toy) but what happened earlier
that day</B>
<BR><B>didn't cross my mind and i just assumed it was down the side of
my bed but i</B>
<BR><B>was too tired to look and i just forgot about it.</B>
<BR><B>The next day I was in the attic looking for something when my eye
came</B>
<BR><B>across something. I went to look and to my amazement it was my cuddly
toy! I</B>
<BR><B>am convinced i never had it up there because i had only been up
there a few</B>
<BR><B>times before and never took my cuddly toy up!(I am not insane!)</B>
<BR><B>I am still convinced to this day that it wasnt just me and my mate
in my</B>
<BR><B>house that day but another person as well!</B>
<BR><B>Just recently a new boy moved in and has since become my friend.
I never</B>
<BR><B>told him about that day but one day he came up to me and explained
that he</B>
<BR><B>was sitting downstairs the night before and had heard what sounded
like</B>
<BR><B>footsteps upstairs and it stopped but about 5 mins later he heard
a bang</B>
<BR><B>that sounded like sonething had been dropped and landed on the floor!
Then</B>
<BR><B>he went up to check and noticed his computer was turned on and,
logged him</B>
<BR><B>in, signed him into msn and started downloading a song! The only
problem was</B>
<BR><B>he had never heard of the song before and he was home alone. He
asked his</B>
<BR><B>parents if they knew anything and they both had never heard the
song either.</B>
<BR><B>His sister is disabled so she couldn't have done it!</B>
<BR><B>We checked the internet and found a site that had the death records
iof our</B>
<BR><B>area. We checked it out and typed in our street and it found results
of</B>
<BR><B>three people. Two of them were mother and son and the other one
was a girl</B>
<BR><B>who lived with her parents but the boy the girl and the boys mother
had been</B>
<BR><B>out walking one day when they had been hit by a car and all three
died. The</B>
<BR><B>son and mother lived in my house and the girl lived in my friends
house. It</B>
<BR><B>had their intersts and&nbsp; we checked them out and one of the
childrens</B>
<BR><B>interests had been listening to the band whose song had started
to download</B>
<BR><B>on my friends computer.</B>
<BR><B>We now believe our houses were haunted but now the spirits have
moved on and</B>
<BR><B>they only stayed because they wanted to have one last look at what
used to</B>
<BR><B>be there childhood house!</B>

<P><B>The Scream</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Brisen46@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; I have been reading through everyone's stories and I decided
that maybe I should go ahead and share one of my experiences...I am 30
years old now....this happened when I was 4 years old....my mother and
father and I where traveling to Oklahoma City to visit my moms sister....mind
you this is a short story but definably very eerie...anyway....on the night
before we arrived at mu aunts home, we stayed the night at a hotel, my
mother is not one to be inconvenienced, she needs her own space, so as
to stay at my aunts house she put in to stay at a cheap motel. My father
obliged her....now mind you I did not know about what happened that night
until I was about 15 because my mother was so freaked out about what had
happened that night that she did not tell me about it until then, and only
then, did it come out in conversation..... she sd that sometime during
the night while her and my father where asleep on one bed I was sound asleep
on the other...and about 3-4 in the am I sat straight up and proceeded
to scream.....she sd that my father tried to console but but I would not
stop and the worst about it was she sd that I did not sound like a small
girl, she sd I sounded like a grown woman in agony.......after a second
or two of my father trying to speak to me, to calm me down, nothing seemed
to work, so he had no choice but to slap me straight across my face, they
sd I looked at them and laid back down like nothing happened..Mom sd her
and my dad stayed up the rest of the night and all was well...... However
when we arrived at my aunts house during dinner my mother brought up the
subject and she explained to my aunt in detail what had happened, mom sd
my aunt froze and looked across at my uncle.....see my aunt was a teacher
at an elementary school at the time, and of course new everyone pretty
well at the school, she asked my mother what motel it was and mom told
her..her face dropped even worse and told my mom that the previous week
a fellow teacher found out her husband was leaving her for another woman
and that he would not be coming back to her.. So with the knowledge of
her husband leaving her for good she locked herself up in one of the motel
rooms and committed suicide...and I believe to this day that&nbsp; It was
her grieving soul experiencing her pain through me once again......what
convinced them was that I was just a little girl and could in no possible
way sound like a grown woman, but for that one time, I did.........</B>

<BR><B>&nbsp; The Man in Black</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: vballa2003@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This story is just a collection of experiences I've had and I don't
know if they go together or make any sense at all. The first was when I
was about 8 and me and some of my friends were out in my backyard telling
ghost stories. All of the sudden we heard a deep voice slowly calling our
names, it seemed to come from behind a shed in the backyard and we all
ran away from it. We ran into the house and then calmed down thinking it
might have been my father, but then I realized my father was at work and
all of our neighbors were pretty up there in age, and I doubted they even
knew our names. We were calming down in my room when I looked out the window
and about 200 feet away in an empty field I saw the outline of what seemed
to be a man but was totally black, but it was in the middle of the day
I couldn't even speak I finally yelled as it was walking away and I think
when I yelled it turned and looked back at me. I never saw it again and
even writing about this is bringing tears to my eyes.</B>
<BR><B>The other experiences I had where in the same room in my grandma's
house. When I was young I used to sometimes go to my grandmothers and stay
for a weekend or a night, one night I was sleeping and I got up half asleep
in some sort of confusion of hearing something in the hallway, I looked
out in the hall and there seemed to be a shadow of a tall man against the
curtains with moonlight shining through them. I wasn't scared like the
first time I actually felt like this man was watching over me and for some
reason I had a weird feeling it was my great grandfather. The other time
was when I was about 16 I was actually living in that room because I had
moved out of my parents house temporarily, it was a typical night, I laid
down to go to sleep, but was having some trouble. I finally started to
get drowsy and I rolled over onto my other side and then out of nowhere
I hear my name whispered urgently into my ear, I even felt the air. I jumped
up and no one was there. I had the door closed, but my grandpa was somewhat
of a jokester, so I thought maybe he was pulling a prank. So I got up and
looked down the hall and I saw him and my grandma in bed watching tv, he
may be a prankster but I doubt he can run that fast. I'm 18 now and I haven't
seen or heard anything weird since, but I also don't spend very much time
at my grandma's house anymore</B>

<P><B>The Lifeless Choke</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ckeohane@sympatico.ca</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I was in my room listening to music when I felt hungry so I headed
to the kitchen to eat something. Half way down the hall I heard choking
like none other. It sounded eerie...like far away yet ...here in a sense!
I got a shiver down my back that made my hairs stand on end and made me
feel sick. I thought : Travis!!!!!!!! my little brother was always trying
to get to the candy drawer! Mabe he had! I ran so fast and madly I felt
like my body was spliting with my soul! But just when I reached the door
to the kitchen I remembered that my mom and Travis went to the store. Who
was it???? I opened the door and saw a litttle gurl. Well...sort of. She
was a little see through but you could tell the colours. Black hair. blue
eyes. Blue and purple face!!!!! I wanted to save her/it! But my feet were
planted to the floor. All I heard was "cough cough choke plubbbck" then
it disappeared. 2 days later I finally got the courage to tell my friends
and they said "well duh" didn't you know!" It turns out 5 years ago a girl
named angi died of choking so the people moved to get over the loss and
4 years ago I moved in! Im still afraid that I will here that chokeing
again even though it has been 2 years</B>

<BR><B>The Ghost in my Room</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: salenalc@mhonline.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I believe that I have a ghost living in my bedroom. He isn't noisy
or violent. He's actually kind of funny. He moves things around. I say
"He" because I get this feeling that the ghost or sprit or what ever you
call it is a teen age boy. He also makes my wind chime move late at night.
I know he does this because I don't have my fan on, and the windows and
door are closed and it chimes.</B>
<BR><B>One night I had been watching the movie Gremlins in my bed room
before I went to sleep. At 12:01 I wake up to my furby (which looks JUST
like a gremlin) saying "ME HUNGRY!!!!!!". And you know that you NEVER feed
a gremlin after midnight!</B>
<BR><B>Another time one of my friends was spending the night and he turned
on my lava lamp and made it move around the table that it was sitting on!
Scared my friend half to death! I told him to cut it out and the lava lamp
turned off and stopped moving.</B>
<BR><B>I'm not afraid of him in the least bit. I feel conferrable with
him in my room. I also think that he takes care of me. At night I'll fall
asleep with out my covers on and then I'll wake up with them around me
like someone had lovingly put them there.</B>
<BR><B>The only thing is I don't know of anyone who died in this house
and I don't know any teen age boy that has died! I don't know who he is
or how come he is haunting my room. But I don't mind him being there. I've
invited him to stay.</B>

<P><B>The Early Years</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ShakerToes@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I've been pondering where to begin, and which experiences to prioritize.
I've decided to begin at the beginning, and submit separate accounts of
my experiences chronologically. In other words...I've got many stories
to share. I've read nearly half of the stories on this site, which is really
a worthwhile forum, and I hadn't realized that much of what I've brushed
off for whatever reason is something that matters to others enough to write
about it. My experiences are not Earth-shattering compared to what many
have endured, but I think they're worthy of reading about.</B>
<BR><B>When I was about seven years old, my mother became involved with
her friend's Jehovah's Witness study group. Now that I look back on it,
I might want to mention that this was in the mid-seventies, and my parents
and these friends (a couple) were classic longhaired hippies, and they
did their share of the "stoner" scene. My mother and Grace (her friend)
were in a study group with Grace's mother in law and all older white-haired,
straight-laced women. They eventually ended up at our house to study, but
I'm getting ahead of myself.</B>
<BR><B>The theory is this: My mother, who was raised strictly Catholic,
was going to become a nun only to do as her grandmother (Granny) wished.
They were very close, and my mother wanted to make Granny proud. (Lol...my
mother a nun! Yeah, right!). That all went out of the window when she met
my father. She thinks that the opposing forces seem very interested in
having her on their side, kind of like vying for her soul. I know it sounds
far out, but I kind of believe it from witnessing and experiencing the
darker aspects of it as a result. She also had many, many, many things
happen to her all of her life that make my stories seem lame. It is prevalent
on the maternal side of my family to have had experiences with the other
worldly beings.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, shortly after my mother started fraternizing with this study
group, something sickening started happening in our house. We had the fold-up,
pulldown type of stairs to the attic in our living room ceiling. There
was a door at the top of them, but it wasn't at the head of the stairs,
as this area was open. Instead, for some reason it was opposite. If one
were to walk around to the back of the attic, open this door, and proceed
through it they'd fall into the living room through the opening in the
ceiling. Well, this door started to be slammed with a force that shook
the entire house. It scared the living hell out of us. It was really that
horribly violent. My parents pulled down the stairs, and this door was
ajar. They shut it. It kept happening often. They somehow tied the door
shut by the knob. It still happened, but worse. The windows literally shook.
Pull the stairs down...it was still tied shut.</B>
<BR><B>One day during the late summer the group was over at our house doing
whatever prayer stuff they do. My father was at work, and my older brother,
Grace's kids, and I were outside playing. We heard screaming coming from
in the house. We ran inside to hear the attic door slamming beyond what
any door should sound like, and this horrid guttural growling noise coming
from up there. It just sounded that awful that no one can convince me that
whatever it happened to be was EVER human. Everyone ran screaming out of
the house to their cars and they were telling my mother to get us two and
get out of that house. Well, we left for a little while, but my mother
decided we couldn't be homeless. So, we went home. (Not my idea of a good
time). It continued to happen, usually lasting five or so minutes. It happened
at least once a night.</B>
<BR><B>Well, my mother had an experience shortly after we had gone back
to school. She claims that when she was home alone in the living room with
the windows open the air just went silent. No birds chirping, no chipmunks,
no locusts buzzing...nothing. We lived in the country, away from any other
houses. She said she started hearing this sound like a vacuum cleaner.
It got louder and louder and seemed to pulsate. It filled the room, and
the walls looked as if they were buckling and waving. She smelled this
horrid, rotting stench, and she kind of knew she was in for something pretty
awful. She ran into her room (I'd have run the hell out of the house!),
and jumped into her bed. She pulled the covers over her head. She said
she heard something walking slowly across the livingroom toward her doorway,
which was open. She was just praying, not daring to look. It sounded to
her as if it were dragging a heavy cloak behind it, and it was breathing
extremely heavy. It was nearly at her bed, and she was just about dying
of fear when apparently our school bus pulled up, and it dissipated</B>
<BR><B>She'd apparently had enough. She took any religious material she
had brought into the house from the group (Not including her bible that
she had from Granny, which she kept) and burned it in the fire pit out
back. I remember being upset when she took both my brother's and my books,
which I guess you would say were like kid's versions of bibles. They were
small, pink, hardcover books, and they had pictures and were easy to understand
for me at that reading level. I absolutely loved to read, and it didn't
matter what it was. I cried, but they got burned anyway. Well, I got over
it right soon, as nothing more of that nature ever happened at that house.
It left as quickly as it came. It was evil, ( I strongly believe demonic)
and it seemed like "IT" was satisfied that my mother quit the group and
burned the literature associated with it. It was not associated with the
house. It came with a purpose, and left having achieved it's goal.</B>
<BR><B>The only other thing I associate with this battle of good/evil of
my mother happened when I was in seventh grade. I was trying to sleep (totally
different house), but I swore my bed was shaking. I just figured I was
being stupid, but it got worse. Still, I tried to dismiss it. It got bad
enough to where I became scared crapless. I got up and went out to the
livingroom. I startled my mother. She asked me what was wrong. I told her,
and she got these big, weird looking eyes...like she was spooked. She said,"
Oh my god, I was just reading the bible." She rarely opened it, for fear
of bringing something on. Well, I was just fine with her NOT reading it,
if it was going to target me to get to her. I just wanted to be left out
of the whole thing. I know that probably sounds ignorant, but I truly felt
it was demonic, and it scared me out of my mind. After what happened, I
felt anything bad might just pop up at anytime. Even though I'm not close
to my mother, (haven't spoken to my family in about 14 years) my heart
does go out to her on whatever her spiritual fate is to be. She's not the
best person, but she isn't inherently evil, just a broken, miserable woman
from years of abuse by both her father and my father.</B>
<BR><B>This experience added to my straying from any traditional religion.
All I knew of Christianity was what my mother told us as kids, and some
of what I read in my pink bible-like book, and it wasn't much. I'd always
had my own thoughts about the whole heaven/hell concept, but I was afraid
of burning in this "hell" if I strayed from it... It just didn't sit right
with me. It always scared me, including the concept of "God." My concept
of "him" was that "he" was very quick to punish anyone who had their own
free thoughts, and let people roast at the drop of a hat. I always felt
spirituality shouldn't be a frightening experience, but I didn't have the
hair on my *** when I was young to explore my inner beliefs. I was never
baptized, and I suppose I'm pagan, if anything. It's confusing, but as
much as I don't adhere to the whole bible concept, I can't dismiss it for
others. I think all religions are a reality for their followers, and they
are fated accordingly. It just isn't my calling, although I respect others
who do follow spiritual paths that aren't mine. It's just a shame that
the reason I know that there must be a "God" is because I'm sure I've seen
and experienced the "devil" side of it. I'm obviously grown now, and I've
transcended those limited childhood concepts, thank Goddess.</B>
<BR><B>To end this story, I just want to thank you for taking the time
to glimpse into my reality. I also have to acknowledge that some of you
may have had the thought that much of it was due to my parent's use of
weed, but myself and all of the others didn't imagine something so wretched.
Rest assured, the ladies of the study group wouldn't have been altered.
The very last thing noteworthy of my mentioning in accordance with this
subject is that I did later independently (and most unwillingly) encounter
another demon-like thing, when I was 19. Yes, quite another story. Please
tune in...</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Crosses</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: wingo86_9@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I know that many of you may be sceptical about te appearances of</B>
<BR><B>ghosts,apparations,ect... and so was I until one year when I went
to spend</B>
<BR><B>the summer with my father in Grand Coulee,WA.I didn't ever even
think about</B>
<BR><B>ghosts until I had to babysit for our neighors in an apartment complex
that</B>
<BR><B>my father managed.I put the kids to bed(one was 3,the other 2 and
there was</B>
<BR><B>also an infant child I was looking after. I had put the 3 and 2
year olds in</B>
<BR><B>their beds for the night and the infants crib was down in the living
room</B>
<BR><B>with me. I had just layed him in his crib when I heard a loud bang
and then</B>
<BR><B>footsteps running across the 3 year olds room. Now she had a tendency
to not</B>
<BR><B>do as she was told,but she normally stayed in her bed at night,but
when I</B>
<BR><B>heard the footsteps i assumed it was one of her crys for attention.
So I</B>
<BR><B>made my way up the stairs,trying to be as quiet as possible so I
could catch</B>
<BR><B>her in the act. When I got to her room she was sound asleep in her
crib. So</B>
<BR><B>i went back downstairs thinking it was my imagination,but about
10 minutes</B>
<BR><B>later I heard the same thing. When I went back upstairs she was
still in her</B>
<BR><B>crib,only this time she was sitting straght up talking to someone
on her</B>
<BR><B>window seal. When she saw I was in there,she turned around and lifted
her</B>
<BR><B>sippy cup up and said,"Kenny want a cuppy too." I started feeling
a little</B>
<BR><B>uncomfortable about this so I called my dad from the upstairs phone.It's
not</B>
<BR><B>what she said that made me do&nbsp; that though. Its&nbsp; what
I saw. Now the setup</B>
<BR><B>of the house has a light in the stairs hallway so that the only
shadow cast</B>
<BR><B>is at the bottom of the stairs.I was seeing shadows of a little,what
looked</B>
<BR><B>o be a boy,at the top of the stairs and I was the only one in the
house</B>
<BR><B>besides the girls and the baby boy. The girls all have fairly long
hair and</B>
<BR><B>the shadow had very short hair.This shadow kept on dancing in a
ritualistic</B>
<BR><B>indian manor(there are a lot of indians in Grand Coulee,and the
people I</B>
<BR><B>babysat for are indians).Anyway...my dad told me to get the kids
and go</B>
<BR><B>outside and he would meet me there.He was sceptical as you might
be ,but as</B>
<BR><B>soon as he stepped foot in the house he heard what I was hearing.He
checked</B>
<BR><B>things out and when he and my stepmom got upstairs, she emidiatly
noticed</B>
<BR><B>something that made all of this a little scarier.You see, Roma(the
lady i</B>
<BR><B>babysat for)was catholic and hung crosses above each bedroom door.
When I</B>
<BR><B>was up there they were fine, but when they got up there,all the
crosses were</B>
<BR><B>turned upside down. Now what many dont know is that an upside down
cross is</B>
<BR><B>the sign of the devil or his demons.Later when she got home she
informed us</B>
<BR><B>that she had been trying to get rid of this spirit for years.She
tried</B>
<BR><B>moving,but the ghost must have attached itself to someting in the
house or</B>
<BR><B>maybe even one of the children. So finally she had a priest come
bless her</B>
<BR><B>home. That only made it angrier than it already was I guess,because
about</B>
<BR><B>1.5 years later her new house caught on fire killing the infant
I once</B>
<BR><B>babysat ,who we liked to call puddles, and her new born child. The
police</B>
<BR><B>could not find the&nbsp; cause of the fire,but the only thing that
survived were</B>
<BR><B>the crosses above each door. The 2 girls' and Roma doorway crosses
were</B>
<BR><B>fine,but the crosses above the infants rooms were turned upside
down once</B>
<BR><B>again. Perhaps the first time was a warning,or maybe he was just
plaing</B>
<BR><B>games with us.... I'll never understand. The only thing I know is
that I</B>
<BR><B>wont ever tamper with the other side ever again!</B>

<BR><B>Sounds on the Stairs</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Aerogurl998@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Most people have a hard time believing me when I tell them what happened
to me. I was sitting at the kitchen table while my sister did laundry in
the basement. We were the only ones home and it was about 8pm. The basement
stairs are right next to the kitchen, but they can't be seen from the table
because the fridge partially blocks them from sight. It was pretty quiet
since I was reading a magazine. All of a sudden I heard creaks on the basement
stairs. I walked over and looked down them and saw the lights on in the
basement, I knew that my sister was down in there so it wasn't a surprise
to see the lights. I called her name, but had no reply. Not really thinking
anything odd about it I went back to the kitchen table and sat down. After
maybe 10-15 minutes I heard another sound on the stairs and leaned back
to see who was coming up. I saw a black cloud and it started floating towards
me. I ran out of the kitchen and saw it was pursuing me. I stopped looking
back and ran through the hallway and into the bathroom then shut the door.
Nothing happened after that. Eventually I came out of the bathroom and
returned to the kitchen. My sister had just gotten to the top of the basement
stairs and was walking through the kitchen. I asked her if she had heard
anything unusual or me calling her and she said no. I thought it very odd
that she had not heard me running since I was very loud and we have wood
floors.</B>
<BR><B>This happened a few years ago and its been semi quiet since then,
but I still do have the occasional unexplained thing happen.</B>

<BR><B>Sleep Paralysis</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: eric2003@frontiernet.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have not really told anybody this before.Due to the fact that is
hard to believe and plus it happend to me when i was young.I do not know
if you would consider it a ghost encounter or not.But i am going to tell
you the happenings to me anyway.I live in W.V and when i was 9 years old
my brother and i shared a bedroom.We had two beds in the room seperoted
by a window in the middle of them.We had setteled down for bed this particular
night to go to sleep.I could not have been asleep long when i awoke to
a rapping like sound at our window.I laid there in my bed not moving a
muscle for some reason i just could not move.I tried my best to move and
even scream my brothers name but could not.And the weird thing is what
was going to happen had not even happened yet.While i was going thru this
state of mind i guess i could here a knocking on the window from the outside.Whatever
it was wuold knock twice on the windowb wait a minute and knock twice again.After
this went on for awhile i was finally able to move and when i got up to
look out the window to see what was knocking all i could see were to big
red circular eyes looking right back at me.I was petrified i went right
back in the state were i could not move it was like those eyes had me hipnotizied.When
i was finaly able to move i just laid back down.The whole night the knocking
continued two knocks at a time and a few minutes later the same thing.This
went on for nights and the same thing was there every night when i wuold
look out the window there would be those two big red hipnotizing eyes.This
went on for about a week and then all of the sudden just stopped.And it
never happend again after that.When i got older i started hearing stories
about a creature in point pleasent W.V.They called it the Mothman,and every
time i would here one of these stories it would be described as having
big red eyes.Then there was really no doubt in my mind that what was visting
me and my brother all those nights was in fact this creature.Because when
i was 9 we lived in Blufield W.V.To this day i have never forgotten those
nights when i was vistied by what i believe is that creature.</B>

<BR><B>Several Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: miss_penguin035@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Here are several expirences with the paranormal that happened to
me or my</B>
<BR><B>sister. Everything is as true as it gets, 'cause I beleive her.
Somethings</B>
<BR><B>are at my Grandmother's house, and some happen at the house I used
to live</B>
<BR><B>in. I am 15 years old, and I don't beleive I have any kind of physic</B>
<BR><B>ability, but I beleive what I see. (Sorry, its kinda long ^^; )</B>
<BR><B>We'll start at the beginning. About ten years, or so, ago I was
asleep at my</B>
<BR><B>Grandmother's house. There was only two bedrooms so me and my sister
(6 at</B>
<BR><B>the time), had to share a bed in the 'front bedroom' as it is called.
There</B>
<BR><B>is a large window at the other end of the bed room that lets just
enough</B>
<BR><B>light in from the moon and stars that there was no need for a night
light,</B>
<BR><B>but we still had one, a light in the shape of Mary holding baby
Jesus. Well,</B>
<BR><B>my sister was asleep, but for some reason I just couldn't. I was
stareing at</B>
<BR><B>the celeing for some time before my eyes became adjusted to the
darkness.</B>
<BR><B>But something was odd to me. In the far right corner of the room
there was a</B>
<BR><B>shadow that just wouldn't go away. As I stared at it, it slowly
took shape</B>
<BR><B>into the form of a cat. I looked around for something that could
be causing</B>
<BR><B>it, but I found nothing. Suddenly, it moved, slinking along in the
soft glow</B>
<BR><B>of our little lamp. For some reason, it terrified me. I was a normal
child</B>
<BR><B>with a great love for animals, and would have just loved being visited
by a</B>
<BR><B>kitty cat to snuggle while I slept, but this one was just creepy.
It crept</B>
<BR><B>closer and closer, along the angle where the celeing met the wall.
I was</B>
<BR><B>terrified into silence, and I kept still in hopes that it hadn't
seen me.</B>
<BR><B>Suddenly, with no warning at all, it lept straight at me. I finally
screamed</B>
<BR><B>loudly and my hand shot over to the much brighter lamp that sat
on the table</B>
<BR><B>beside the bed. Instantly it vanished, as if it were a real shadow.
My</B>
<BR><B>Grandparents came in to investigate, but, of course, found nothing.
That was</B>
<BR><B>the birth of ShadowCat, a now laughed opon joke in my family. To
this day I</B>
<BR><B>still beleive what I saw.</B>
<BR><B>Several years later, me and my sister were now teenagers and have
had no</B>
<BR><B>expirences with ghosts or anything out of the ordinary that were
to bad. I</B>
<BR><B>was going into a Christian school for my middle school education,
but my</B>
<BR><B>sister opted to go and stay with my Grandparents and go to school
there,</B>
<BR><B>because there was no sort of P.E. in teh Christian school (something
I was</B>
<BR><B>very happy with, I might add). She stayed there for several months,
but then</B>
<BR><B>came home. She and I both transfered to the same middleschool because
of</B>
<BR><B>complications that I had at the school I was attending. One night,
my sister</B>
<BR><B>told me about the terrifing expirences that finally drove her back
home. She</B>
<BR><B>said as she laied in bed at night, (in the 'front bedroom' again)
as she</B>
<BR><B>drifted between wakefulness and being asleep, she would see things.
No, not</B>
<BR><B>like "I see dead people...", more like, I see solid black creatures
with red</B>
<BR><B>glowing eyes. Sound corny? By the look on her face I could tell
that she</B>
<BR><B>wasn't makeing it up to scare me. She described their voices, but
I was to</B>
<BR><B>freaked out to remember how she described them. They called to her,
calling</B>
<BR><B>out her name repeatedly, calling her to come. She would struggle
to move or</B>
<BR><B>open her eyes, but she couldn't. The only way she could get away
was if she</B>
<BR><B>screamed prayers in her voice that didn't quite work. She would
wake up with</B>
<BR><B>a sore throat alot. Eventually she had to stop sleeping in that
room.</B>
<BR><B>Another scary thing, there was an old doll house in there, a very
pretty</B>
<BR><B>white one that seemed handmade. But the furniture in it was excatcly
like</B>
<BR><B>the furniure in the movie "The Exorsist". Or so my sister says,
I've</B>
<BR><B>personally never seen the movie. (Yes, I'm a chicken...)</B>
<BR><B>Now, a couple of years ago I watched a show on T.V. that was talking
about</B>
<BR><B>ghosts. I love things like that. That's what drew me to this site
in the</B>
<BR><B>first place. Well, anyway, it was talking about dreams, and how
ghosts</B>
<BR><B>communicated with you through them. That's when I began to peice
together</B>
<BR><B>the events from my old house. I had three dreams about three different</B>
<BR><B>ghosts. One had a little girl who had long brown hair, and was about
seven</B>
<BR><B>years old. My dream self found her at a friend's house and, for
some reason,</B>
<BR><B>invited to her come and stay at my house. I don't really beleive
that's how</B>
<BR><B>she got there. She wore a very pretty dress, no wrinkles or anything.
Her</B>
<BR><B>name was Mary something, I don't quite remember. It wasn't a bad
dream,</B>
<BR><B>probably just her telling me not to be afraid, as if she could sence
that I</B>
<BR><B>get scared VERY easily, lol.</B>
<BR><B>The next dream had a little girl, very pretty curly blonde hair,
around the</B>
<BR><B>age of three. My dream self went to a random house, and found the
sad little</B>
<BR><B>girl, who was still alive. She was crying because her 'Father' wouldn't
let</B>
<BR><B>her play. I told her that I could rescue her, help her, and so on.
I felt so</B>
<BR><B>bad, as I dearly love little children. She smiled at me, but her
'Father'</B>
<BR><B>came in, and told her that it was time for her to go. My dream self</B>
<BR><B>registered that this was why she was crying, and what that ment.
I tried to</B>
<BR><B>stop him, but I was unable. He injected her with something, and
she screamed</B>
<BR><B>and cried, as if in alot of pain. I stood in the corner, sobbing,
because I</B>
<BR><B>was unnable to do anything. Somewhere in the back of my mind I knew
it was</B>
<BR><B>only a dream, but it felt so real! The man who was very obviosly
not her</B>
<BR><B>father left, and I slowly walked over to her. She was very pale,
and no</B>
<BR><B>longer crying. I took her hands in mine and told her that she would
be</B>
<BR><B>alright, and that she could still come with me, that she would be
safe with</B>
<BR><B>me. We were suddenly outside, and still holding hands. We went floating</B>
<BR><B>higher and higher, as if she was going to Heaven. The girl was quickly</B>
<BR><B>becomming transparent, and the coldness was seeping up my arms.
Slowly, my</B>
<BR><B>own arms began to turn transparent as well. I yelled, told her that
I had so</B>
<BR><B>much left to do in my life. Sadly, she pulled the coldness back
into</B>
<BR><B>herself, and whispered that she would wait for me. I told her that
she would</B>
<BR><B>always be safe with me. I took her back to my house as well. When
I woke up</B>
<BR><B>my arms were numb with coldness.</B>
<BR><B>The last dream was the shortest, because this little tidbit was
all I could</B>
<BR><B>remember. Usually my dreams are silly, consisting of herds of hippos
at my</B>
<BR><B>Grandmother's house, or being able to turn into some kind of animal.</B>
<BR><B>Anyways, I was sitting in the bathroom floor, for some odd reason,
and I was</B>
<BR><B>tieing my shoes. The door was closed. I was on the far side, sitting</B>
<BR><B>paralelle with the door. Suddenly, it slammed open, and standing
there was a</B>
<BR><B>dark figure of a huge man in a top hat. Just like ShadowCat he was</B>
<BR><B>terrifing, but he didn't appear to be a shadow. He was just dark,
with</B>
<BR><B>little sparkles of light that danced around in him. That's all I
remember,</B>
<BR><B>except I always got the feeling that someone was going to sneak
up behind me</B>
<BR><B>while I was in the bathroom. I absolutly can't stand that feeling
now.</B>
<BR><B>Things started to get really bad when we were moving. About a week
before I</B>
<BR><B>was home alone, my family having gone out to see the new house again.
There</B>
<BR><B>was a show on T.V. that I wanted to see, so me and my dog sat down
in the</B>
<BR><B>living room to watch it. OK, I should explain how my living room
was set up.</B>
<BR><B>Its basicly square, with a tv on the far wall, and a big couch that
curves</B>
<BR><B>around it. The recliner faces the T.V. and behind the recliner is
a small</B>
<BR><B>glass thingy, then a small wooden old hall, and the front door.
Like I said,</B>
<BR><B>I was home alone, so the door was locked. Well, I was sitting there,
T.V.</B>
<BR><B>on, pop corn beside me, and my dog in my lap. Suddenly, the door
behind me</B>
<BR><B>unlocked. I thought it was my family, home early, even though I
heard no</B>
<BR><B>voices. The door opened slowly, and my dog started barking like
mad. My dog,</B>
<BR><B>a little jack russell terrier, is very high strung, but is generally
afraid</B>
<BR><B>of people. I turned around quickly, terrifed that someone had just
broken</B>
<BR><B>into my house, but no one was there. The floor creaked, and my dog
followed</B>
<BR><B>something with her eyes, growling angrily. Like I said, she was
afraid of</B>
<BR><B>people, but protective of me. That really scared me.</B>
<BR><B>The day we moved, we took pictures all over the house, to remember
it. If I</B>
<BR><B>had a scanner, I would send those as well, but, sadly, we don't
have one</B>
<BR><B>yet. But, I remembered to take some especially of the places where
we have</B>
<BR><B>felt things the most, such as the kitchen, the little wooden hall
that leads</B>
<BR><B>to the front door and suchs. In all of them there were brightly
colored and</B>
<BR><B>large orbs. No lie. I'm going to get a scanner soon, and will send
those to</B>
<BR><B>go with this story.</B>
<BR><B>Well, that's my story, my whole story so far. Sorry it was so long,
but I've</B>
<BR><B>had alot of expirences, lol. Things things really scare me, and
I'm not at</B>
<BR><B>all happy that they've happened to me, but in a way, I am. Its fun
to be</B>
<BR><B>scared, that's why people go sky diving. But, when its acually happening,
I</B>
<BR><B>often wish I were somewhere else.</B><B></B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Alot of weird things go on around our home. My grandparents' home
is also a little strange. I've experienced many things numerous times at
both my house and my grandparents' house.</B>
<BR><B>First of all, when I was 6 years old, I was awakened by a raspy
humming sound. I sat up in my bed, wiped my eyes and looked to the left
of my bed. Sitting there in a rocking chair with a baby was a woman dressed
in an old-fashioned type gown. She was also wearing a bonnet and had her
face turned toward the baby. I thought it may have been my mom, so I whispered,"Mom"
and when the lady in the chair looked at me her eyes glowed red so I yelled
louder for my mom to come to me and when she came to the door the woman
disappeared but the chair was still there, very faintly, and rocking slowly.
I never told anyone except my mom about this and when my younger cousin
was 6 she reported seeing the exact thing to me.</B>
<BR><B>One winter when the electric was off my cousin accompanied me as
I went to take a shower in the old house, because it was the only one with
a gas water heater. I ran nothing but hot water into the bathtub and got
in. The water wasn't scalding hot, but very warm. I heard whispering and
asked my cousin if it was her. She said no. I heard it again, only louder
this time. I became alarmed and listened more closely. This time it was
very loud and very clear. The whispering was the Lord's Prayer. I was very
scared and I couldn't make myself move. The water became very cold and
the whispering grew louder. I told my grandparents and parents what happened
and they shrugged it off.</B>
<BR><B>My grandparents reported hearing gospel music, preaching, the Lord's
Prayer, and the 23rd Psalm in the old house. My Papaw was going to take
a nap one day and felt the bed move and saw an indentation as if someone
were sitting beside him on the bed.</B>
<BR><B>Many other things have happened but these are only a few. If anyone
is interested I'll post more later.</B>

<P><B>Out of Here</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: archangel64735us@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I do believe the place that I am staying at might have</B>
<BR><B>a ghost, due to the things happening in the last few</B>
<BR><B>days. Me and my girlfriend are moving to her moms</B>
<BR><B>house, because we both can't find any work in this</B>
<BR><B>town. And my mom is moving up north to take over a</B>
<BR><B>friends business when he dies. And it seems the ghost</B>
<BR><B>does not want to be alone. And is mad so it is</B>
<BR><B>starting to do things maybe to scare us. I have tried</B>
<BR><B>to take a photo of the ghost (maybe at the wrong time</B>
<BR><B>of day). I am some times up late on the computer, and</B>
<BR><B>hear a noise coming from somewhere. I think the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen next to my moms room. It sounds like a cabinet</B>
<BR><B>door closing a little too hard. The sound happens at</B>
<BR><B>about 2:30 at night, and it seems only to happen when</B>
<BR><B>everyone is in bed asleep, but me. This has been</B>
<BR><B>happening ever since I got back from Job Corp. We</B>
<BR><B>don't have mice, or a rat, or any other animal in the</B>
<BR><B>house. Once, at supper time me and my girlfriend was</B>
<BR><B>in the kitchen fixing something to eat, she had just</B>
<BR><B>got a plate out of the cabinet and left the door open.</B>
<BR><B>I was standing right next to her (just a foot away</B>
<BR><B>from the cabinet) talking to her faceing the cabinet,</B>
<BR><B>and a few dishes came flying out of the cabinet hit</B>
<BR><B>the counter then hit the floor. They had not been</B>
<BR><B>touched at all, and had been sitting there for</B>
<BR><B>sometime after she had gotten the plate. Also, Just a</B>
<BR><B>few days later. I think it was the ghost knocked off a</B>
<BR><B>small wooden stick shelf that was hanging on the wall</B>
<BR><B>(just fine hanging out on the wall) some how came off</B>
<BR><B>the wall. I at the time was just in the other room at</B>
<BR><B>night on the computer. As soon as I heard the noise I</B>
<BR><B>went see what the noise was. My girlfriend was in the</B>
<BR><B>same room asleep in bed. I came in and asked if the</B>
<BR><B>noise I heard was her, she said no it was not me. And</B>
<BR><B>that the noise had woke her up. I - We have not seen</B>
<BR><B>anything like a ghost, but these things that have been</B>
<BR><B>happening I have seen or dealed with myself. I must</B>
<BR><B>note to you that in the last few days before typeing</B>
<BR><B>this even today, it feels like someone or something is</B>
<BR><B>playing with my hair or my neck. Mostly my hair. As</B>
<BR><B>for me and my girlfriend and my mom We all are out of here.</B>

<BR><B>Old Friends</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Holdplz@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have been reading your stories for about four years now and always
enjoyed them.&nbsp; During this time I lost four very dear companions and
friends--my cats Tommy, Bootsie and T. J.&nbsp; and Abby (a mini dachshund)
Tommy was nineteen years old at his passing.&nbsp; He and I had spent many
years together, through good times and bad.&nbsp; His personality was very
unique and almost human in some ways.&nbsp; Since his passing he has visited
me at least 3-4 times.&nbsp; He only comes to me and never to my husband.&nbsp;
Each time he visits I am alone in the bedroom.&nbsp; He meows one or twice,
and nothing more. He had a very unusual meow and voice, so I know it is
him.</B>
<BR><B>Hours before his death each of the other cats came to say good-bye
to him.&nbsp; Tommy was laying on the couch and they would hop up and sit
or lay by him for several minutes, then get down.&nbsp; He was "the boss."&nbsp;
He ate first and had all the best spots to nap in.&nbsp; No one challenged
him.&nbsp; He is buried in the backyard, I plan on having his remains cremated
when we move out of state.&nbsp; I have spoken to him as well as three
other pets that we lost to let them know we will be moving, and to please
come with us.&nbsp; We will be returning to a home that we all shared together
previously, so they are all familiar with the house and location.</B>
<BR><B>One of the pets we lost was our female mini dachshund, Abby.&nbsp;
She was especially close to my husband, Larry.&nbsp; She was his "baby."&nbsp;
He has told me that several times as he sits on the bed getting dressed
in the morning, he will feel footsteps behind him on the bed and he knows
it's Abby.&nbsp; (Laying on the bed was one of her favorite things to do.)&nbsp;
He will then reach behind him and "scratch her back."&nbsp; Both my husband
and myself believe that our four-legged family does come and visit with
us from time to time.&nbsp; Abby's lifetime companion Oscar (male mini
dachshund) mourned her passing deeply, he loved her very much.&nbsp; Oscar
mourned her for several weeks and to this day his personality is not a
happy as it once was.&nbsp; Larry came home one day after her passing and
found Oscar was howling mournfully for Abby.&nbsp; It took Larry several
minutes to settle him down.&nbsp; A month or so after Abby's passing, we
got Oscar another companion, a mini dachshund puppy by the name of Millie.&nbsp;
He has formed a strong bond with Millie but not as deep as with Abby. Oscar
never wanted to lay on the bed alone when Abby was living and now he begs
to lay on our bed.&nbsp; So, we believe that he can sense or see her spirit
and wants to be with her.&nbsp; It is a comforting thought that someone
you care for so much is still here with you.</B>
<BR><B>My thoughts are that all living things have a soul and when they
are loved so deeply they respond in like.&nbsp; My wish is that when it
is time for me to pass that my friends and family (two and four legged)
will be there to greet me on the other side.</B>

<P><B>My Whole Family</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: charlotterocks@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi I love your site and I've been trying to get my stories on there
for about two years so I really hope that you put it on. Well, my family
has had the strangest things happened to them like my aunt not being able
to buy a hotdog but that's another story. Anyway, the first thing that
happened to my family happened to my Mom. When she was about 12 or 13 her
and my Grandma where making her bed. when all the sudden her lamb on her
nightstand lifted of the nightstand about 2 feet in the air and smashed
into a million pieces on the wall behind them. That was the first but certainly
not the last. Then when I was about 4 I was at my Grandma's house in Simi
Valley Ca. she lived in a housing tract called Wood Ranch. We were the
only two people in the house she was upstairs typing and I was downstairs
playing. I heard this very creepy noise like a soft screech so I proceeded
to walk up the stairs to tell my Grandma and when I reached about the 5th
step I looked up and saw a women walking down the stairs. She had a white
dress on and had long black hair when she got to about three steps in front
of me she disappeared. I was so scared I ran up the stairs as fast as I
possibly could. Then when my aunt and uncle where moving out I saw her
in the mirror in their room. But before they moved out my cousin J said
she would wake up every night at the same time in a panic for no reason.
The tv would go on and off, my grandma's bird Elmer would go nuts for no
reason and my grandma would have to take him out of the room and put him
in the kitchen. The folding chairs in the kitchen would collapse all the
sudden by them selves and the table would slide across the kitchen. We
would get phone calls and when we picked them up it would be static and
growling on the other end .My other cousin C was about 2 or 3 and she was
in the upstairs bathroom for the longest time and all the sudden she started
screaming bloody murder my aunt A , my mom , and my grandma all ran over
and the door was locked but the really creepy thing was the door didn't
lock! finally they got the door open and my aunt asked her what was wrong
and she said the red monster would not let her leave! Now that's just in
one house , the house after that still in Simi weird things would happen
there too. My Granddad would be working on his computer and he would hear
crying coming from the little attack rite across from him. The stain glass
window would swing back and forth really hard, and one time me ,my mom,
and my two brothers C and J spent the night there and everyone was asleep
but me and&nbsp; I was watching MTV (what else) and I heard someone whisper
R**** my name in a weird voice and I thought it might be my uncle messing
with me so I looked over and there was no one there. Then in the morning
we were all in the living room and it sounded like every dish and pan fell
out of the cupboards and smashed on the floor we all went running in to
see what happened and nothing. Not one little spoon was out of place and
my uncle's was the first room to the left of the kitchen and he had his
door open and he didn't hear anything. Then my cousin C was in her room
and she through a pair of jeans down on her bed and it looked like someone
picked them up and through them on the floor on the other side of the bed.
My Grandma had to move because a truck plowed into it no one was hurt but
it caused allot af damage. Then in the house after that nothing much happened
there except when she was first moving in I was helping her and we were
trying to hang a pictures at the top of the stairs and we backed away to
see what it looked like and it came flying down at us. Not like the nail
bent or came out of the wall it lifted off the nail floated a few seconds
and came down at us and landed at our feet. My baby cousin would also walk
upstairs and start screaming and crying cause he was scared of something.
Now for the house she's in now I saw a shadow of and old women in the kitchen
when I was the only one awake and I saw it again in the back yard when
my Grandma was in the same room with me. My cousin C saw an old women in
the bathroom mirror when she was washing her hands and she went running
out screaming. when they where first moving in we were taking a break and
C walked into her room and I thought I would join her so I knocked on the
door ,cause it was locked and I heard what I thought was her at the time
say "go away"! So I said it was me cause I thought she thought it was her
little brother and she didn't say anything and so I left thinking she was
in a bad mood . I walked down the hallway and her and her dad came walking
out of the computer room and I told her what happened and we went to go
"investigate". The door was not locked anymore and there was no one there.
One time my aunt was taking her baby to bed and there was no one ells was&nbsp;
up and he waved to nothing. My aunt N was asleep on the couch and she said
if felt like some one was fanning her. Now I know this is pretty long but
so much stuff has happened to my family this is just the tip of the iceberg.
Now my Aunt N's house I'll only tell you one of the stories because there
is allot of stuff. Well. a few months ago my cousin S and my two aunts
and my uncle were up late on night watching tv my baby cousin was in the
other living that no one goes in because it's haunted and he comes running
in to my cousin S and he never goes to anyone but his mom but she was the
closest to him he was crying saying there was a mean man in the living
room and he kept pointing to where he was and he just kept saying mean
man mean man. The next morning they went to the mall and they passed by
a window with a whole bunch of manikins and one didn't have a head and
he got really scared again saying mean man and they asked him if that was
what the man looked like in the living room and he said yes. Well, I guess
I should stop but I still have allot more stories I guess I'll send them
in another time</B><B></B>

<P><B>4 Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: shawn_f74337@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I actually have four stories. three take place at she same place.
in mazie Oklahoma there's a factory called Jackson clip and there's a house
right next door. supposable there use to be an old nursing home where the
factory and the house sit now. many years back my grandparents and a few
of my aunts lived there. One night my grandma woke up and saw something
by the wall where she had on old antique vanity with the mirrors and the
little bench you could sit on there was an old woman wearing a white gown
brushing out her long gray hair. I don't know what happened after that
as far as how she left or what grandma did next. later on (ma by months
or weeks I don't know) my grandpa woke to find to find the same woman hovering
over his head and she just disappeared through the wall. now lets skip
ahead about 15 years. my aunt worked at Jackson clip she arrived early
one morning and began her shift before anyone else had arrived. she was
standing in front of something reflective such as a window or large peace
of sheet metal when she saw a man wearing a black stocking cap walking
up behind her .thinking it was one of her male colleagues going to goose
her she watched till she thought he was close enough to goose her she jumped
up and turn around in hopes to scare him and there was no one there.</B>
<BR><B>now my own story I worked security at the R.L.Jones Jr. airport
near junks not quite a year earlier there was a security guard that had
died of a heart attack in the maintenance building break room. now when
I first started there my supervisor told me that people had seen his ghost
around there sometimes he would be beside the buildings watching the foxes
that play near the railroad tracks just on the other side of the fence
he would also be seen on occasion in front of the gazebo just across the
street from the maint. building watching the planes take off and land.
well having been told this I would always Waite till everyone had left
and then before dark I would turn on all the lights in the shop to include
the break room lights and the restroom lights. you have to walk by the
break room to get to the restroom so I ceartny always kept the light on
and the door open to the break room. there was at least one occasion that
i knew for a fact that i had turned on the lights to the break room and
opened the door went and did my reports and when I would go to the restroom
before made a patrol of the premises that the lights would be off and the
door would be shut but only to the break room. now I had never left the
building so I know that no one else had entered the building except me
because I would have seen them or at least heard them. then a few weeks
or months later (I forget) I was walking around the building to get back
into my patrol vehicle to pull it into the maint. building when i came&nbsp;
around the building I was looking at the ground Once around the corner
after a few steps I looked up to see a man watching over by where the foxes
play near the railroad track and leaning up against the fence that surrounds
some equipment connected to the maint. building. then as quickly as I saw
him he looked over at me and just disappeared if it had been a real man
there's no way he could have left without me seeing him I never took my
eyes off him he was just there one second and as quickly as I could blink
he was gone. I spent the remainder of the 45 min. of my shift at the front
gate clear on the other side of the airport till my releif showed up.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Mother's Warning</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: shawne.kelly@citigroup.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was 24, my beloved mother died suddenly of a heart attack.
Five years later, my brothers and sister and I were gathered at the hospital
after my father's second open heart surgery. He was not doing well and
we feared the worst. I was dozing (I think) in the chair in a corner of
the waiting room, when I saw my mother standing in front of me. I said
"Mom, what are you doing here? You're dead" (as if she didn't know that
already) She just smiled and said "I know dear, I've come for your father.
He's coming with me now" I remember I sat straight up in my chair--unable
to speak for a few minutes. Within minutes, the doctors came to tell us
our father had passed away. I believe my mom came to me to prepare me for
what was to come.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: joelh1025@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Here is my ongoing ghost story. I will start off with a history of
my house.</B>
<BR><B>I live in a huge old New England farmhouse on the top of a hill.
It is about</B>
<BR><B>7,000 sq.ft., and it is very creepy. We have about 180 acres of
woods</B>
<BR><B>surrounding us, and your lawn is about 6 acres. My house was built
in 1820.</B>
<BR><B>It was first a working farm. Around 1900, it was turned into a hotel.
In</B>
<BR><B>1930, there was a hurricane, and all but the brick shell of the
main house</B>
<BR><B>was destroyed. It lay abandoned until about 1960, when it was bought
and</B>
<BR><B>restored by an elderly couple. My parents bought it in the 1970s,
and in</B>
<BR><B>1988, they expanded it with an addition of two bedrooms, two bathrooms,
a</B>
<BR><B>living room, and an extended&nbsp; basement. I have had many eerie
experiences in</B>
<BR><B>this house. The first one happened when i was about 7 years old.
I slept in</B>
<BR><B>the one bedroom on the first floor. One night, in January, i was
awakened by</B>
<BR><B>something climbing up the end of my bunk bed. It was shaking my
bed. Then</B>
<BR><B>the "thing" started jumping up and down.... I was scared half to
death... I</B>
<BR><B>thought it was my brother being mean, but after about 2 minutes
of jumping,</B>
<BR><B>i caught a glimpse of it out of the corner of my eye. It was a young
boy,</B>
<BR><B>about 4 years old. Then it suddenly stopped. Not much happened for
another</B>
<BR><B>year or two, until one night in February, 1998. I was in bed, getting
ready</B>
<BR><B>to asleep, around 9:30 at night. My bedroom faces the garage and
driveway.</B>
<BR><B>We have lights that illuminate the driveway from the outside of
the garage.</B>
<BR><B>I had shades over my windows to block the light, but there was still
an</B>
<BR><B>opaque glow coming through. I was staring at the the shade when
suddenly,</B>
<BR><B>the shadow of a man wearing a cap passed by my window. I didnt think
much of</B>
<BR><B>it, I assumed it was my father. But the next morning, there were
no foot</B>
<BR><B>prints in the snow outside my window. A few days later, i was reading
a book</B>
<BR><B>on my bed in the mid-afternoon. The overhead light in my room was
on.</B>
<BR><B>Suddenly, it went out. I assumed that a bulb had blown, but i flicked
the</B>
<BR><B>switch and it went right back on. Nothing much happened for a few
more</B>
<BR><B>years, until November, 2000. I was home alone around 5:00 PM, when
the phone</B>
<BR><B>rang. I answered it, to find that it was a horrible screaming noise.
I</B>
<BR><B>dialed *69 to find the number, but it said that the last number
called had</B>
<BR><B>been a call from my dad, around lunch time. Things were quiet for
a few</B>
<BR><B>months until July, 2001. Over the course of July and August, 2001,
doors</B>
<BR><B>would randomly open and close in my house. We all naturally assumed
that it</B>
<BR><B>was breezes coming from open windows. But over the past year or
so,</B>
<BR><B>including in the winter, DOORS HAVE BEEN OPENING AND CLOSING!! Even
with no</B>
<BR><B>windows open anywhere!&nbsp; I thought that I might just be over-reacting.
But, a</B>
<BR><B>few weeks ago I was talking to my best friend, and he told me that
he had a</B>
<BR><B>few similar experiences. Since that talk, and I dont know why, I
sometimes</B>
<BR><B>hear footsteps when no one is home. I was in the new&nbsp; basement
one day,</B>
<BR><B>using the pool table, when i heard hevy footsteps above. I assumed
my dad</B>
<BR><B>was home, so I went upstars. No one was there. My friend once took
a picture</B>
<BR><B>of my house from a helicopter, and a person showed up in the garden.
Nobody</B>
<BR><B>was home when he took the picture, we were all at the beach, 40
miles away!</B>
<BR><B>Just the otherday, I was talking to our neighbor/friend who cleans
our</B>
<BR><B>house. I asked her if she had any odd experiences in the house,
and she had</B>
<BR><B>all the same as me. She once was cleaning the house with her daughter
and</B>
<BR><B>she had to quickly run home and get food out of the oven. When she
drove up,</B>
<BR><B>she found her daughter sitting on the front lawn. To this day, she
refuses</B>
<BR><B>to go in the house. She told me that one of the long-time residents
of the</B>
<BR><B>town said that a crazy girl used to live in the attic, and that
one day she</B>
<BR><B>escaped from the nurse's watch and hanged herself in one of the
trees in our</B>
<BR><B>backyard. Underneath the spot where this supposedly happens, no
grass grows.</B>
<BR><B>Sometimes our dogs stare into space and growl at something that
isnt</B>
<BR><B>there.... Or maybe we just cant see it.&nbsp; ..... On June 6, 2003,
my beloved</B>
<BR><B>dog Cloud was run over by my dad. Since then, the car has sometimes
a</B>
<BR><B>feeling of dread and sometimes a feeling of happiness. .. There
are</B>
<BR><B>mysterious problems and rattles on the side of the car that hit
him..... And</B>
<BR><B>it is a brand new BMW, so it isnt anything mechanical. Also,our
other dog</B>
<BR><B>sometimes licks thin air in the same way he licked cloud......</B>

<BR><B>My Grandmother</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Matt</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Growing up, I always had a very special relationship with my grandma.
My grandma and I got along famously, while my brother was really close
to my grandpa. It was great, we each were the "favorite" grandchild to
a grandparent!</B>
<BR><B>In 1991, my grandma was diagnosed with cancer of the pancreas. The
chances of surviving are pretty much zero. Needless to say, I was very
upset, and I knew we only had a very short time left to see her.</B>
<BR><B>Over the course of the summer, I spent as much time as possible
up at my grandparents house. My family comes from Minneapolis, and my grandparents
lived in a very tiny town in Northern Minnesota, that was several hours
away. So we did the best we could, travelling 3 or 4 times a month up to
their house.</B>
<BR><B>On what would turn out to be the last visit, it was a very special
time. I knew my grandma was getting worse, but amazingly through it all
she still kept a great sense of humor. The two of us would even joke about
how she was on so many pain-killers! She said if she had known how great
they made her feel, she might have started taking them sooner! HAHA! She
was also being very generous with her money, just shelling it out left
and right to anything and everybody. I'm sure she wanted to see us enjoy
ourselves, while she still had the chance.</B>
<BR><B>As we were preparing to leave, my grandma called me into the living
room. It was just her and I, and she pulled me close to her and said, "Be
good while I'm gone, kiddo," and gave me a kiss on the cheek. We just hugged
for a couple of minutes crying, and then I left.</B>
<BR><B>One week later, my grandma died. She had asked my grandpa to help
her up to get into bed, and on their way to the bedroom, she died in his
arms.</B>
<BR><B>So, we packed up some things and went back up for the funeral. I
managed to hold myself together pretty well, but when I had to say the
final goodbye at the cemetary, I just lost it. It was just too much, it
all seemed to hit me at once. I just sobbed and had to walk in the woods
around the cemetary for a few minutes just to get myself together.</B>
<BR><B>After the funeral, we went back to the house. It was really weird
being there without my grandma. There sat her favorite chair, empty. Everyone
was in the kitchen and dining room, chatting, cooking, having guests over,
etc...the usual stuff you do after a funeral. Since I was not feeling even
remotely festive, I just sat in the living room by myself thinking.</B>
<BR><B>As I was sitting in the living room, I noticed the clock on the
wall had stopped ticking. This clock had the most annoying ticking sound
in the world. It was a constant background noise that you got used to,
but most certainly you would notice if it stopped. As soon as I looked
up at the clock, I turned my head to the left, and there she was: my grandma
was sitting in her chair, painting her fingernails!!</B>
<BR><B>At first I sort of blurted out some laughter, because I was thinking,
"Ok Matt. You've been through a traumatic day. GET A GRIP!" But then she
just kept sitting there, painting her nails, like she always did. She then
looked over to me and said, "Tell your mom everything is going to be OK.
I'm so happy now. I'm so proud of who you are and what you will become."
With that, she smiled and gave me her little wink that she always did,
and said, "See you later kiddo!" and she was gone.</B>
<BR><B>Of course, I didn't tell my parents right away what happened, because
they probably would have thought I was worshipping the devil or something.
They are extremely religious, and think anything supernatural that happens
is evil. So, I did tell them, "I'm sure grandma is happy and in a much
better place," but I left out the little detail that she actually visited
me.</B>
<BR><B>Since then, I have seen my grandma only a couple of other times.
But I certainly feel her around me, especially when I'm really going through
something tough. The last time I saw her was the very last night I ever
spent in their house, around a year after her death.</B>
<BR><B>It was a really stormy night, and the lightening was just awesome.
I remember waking up, and feeling compelled to look out the window. My
grandparents house was on this huge hill, overlooking a lake. I looked
out the window, and there was this "projection" of my grandma, in a boat,
on the lake. I know it just sounds crazy, but it was like in "The Wizard
of Oz", when Dorothy is in her house inside the twister and she sees people
floating by outside of her window! As I'm staring at this image of my grandma,
she's rowing the boat, smiling and waving to me. I know she was saying
something, but I couldn't hear what it was, because the thunderstorm was
so loud. So, she just kept waving and smiled, and rowed right out of sight.
I'm not really sure what all of that meant or what it was, but it left
me feeling very good about leaving that part of my life behind.</B>
<BR><B>Thanks for letting me share this experience. It's certainly not
a scary event, but what happened to me really helped me out, dealing with
death and all that comes along with it. I really believe that we have loved
ones watching out for us, and there is nothing wrong with admitting that
or sharing it. I'm glad I found this website. It's great to have a place
to share our experiences. Thanks for listening, and I've learned so much
from reading about other people's experiences.</B>

<P><B>Lathom Hall</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: IanSndwn@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi. My name is Ian Macleod.&nbsp; I have a short story for you.&nbsp;
This happened in 1967 and I have 3 other people that were there with me.</B>
<BR><B>We were sat in the local coffee bar discussing ghosts when Neil
said that there was a place quite nearby that had a history !. He told
us that he had heard that there was a ghost there. We, of course did not
belive him and he said that he did not belive it either !! After a while
we decided that we would go and see the layout of the place. So we went
to my house and filled up a couple of flasks with coffee and off we went.
The place was called Lathom hall and was the scene of a battle during the
civil war. There was just one wing left but it was quite large. It was
being used as a cattle shed there being a herd there, chewing on some hay.&nbsp;
We went up an old flight of stairs whick creaked alarmingly. At this time
it was quite light, it being summer, so we found a room which was large
and suitable for being checked out. The room had four walls so we sat one
to a wall, each of us facing the centre. We sat for hours or so it seemed,
then suddenly a banging started from the floor and went up the wall across
the ceiling, down the wall and across the floor filling the room with dust.
We panicked and started to run out of the building. Neil at six foot six
was the biggest of us yet little Ray climbed over his head when we went
down the stairs. It was then we realised that it was dark, pitch black
!!!&nbsp; Night had fallen but we had not realised it ! We could not see
a thing ! For in about twenty seconds it had gone so dark ! But how ??
We were staggering about in cow dung and straw, cows were running round
like there was no tomorrow, panic had set in. Eventually we got back to
the car and got out of there. How had it happened ??&nbsp; How had it got
dark in so short a time ? What was the banging, it was so loud ? To this
day we never figured it out. Lathom hall has been altered now and is a
different place so I guess we will never know !</B>

<BR><B>Haunted Bathroom</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: natasha6101@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My daughter must have been 3, maybe 4 at the time.&nbsp; We lived
in an end apartment which made the living room bigger.&nbsp; When you walked
in the door there was a walkway with a sort of bar.&nbsp; Then it was the
living room and off to one side the kitchen.&nbsp; You could take two ways
to the bathroom, one through the kitchen or through the living room.&nbsp;
You could only position your table at one spot in the kitchen or I guess
if you wanted it could be in the living room, but that would make the whole
room look silly. Anyway, with the kitchen table sat where it was, you had
a straight shot of the bathroom. So, one night we were sitting down to
dinner and my husband and I had our backs to the bathroom, so my children
were facing the bathroom.&nbsp; My oldest daughter would not eat her food.&nbsp;
She kept looking into the bathroom and&nbsp; laughing and smiling.&nbsp;
When we would tell her to eat she would act as if we weren't even there.&nbsp;
After asking her a few more times to eat we started to get irritated.&nbsp;
My husband rose his voice and asked why she would not eat.&nbsp; She said
it was because there was a funny monster hanging from the "shower curtain",
then she started laughing again.&nbsp; We thought she was just making up
stories, so we asked her to eat before her dinner got cold, again, she
ignored us.&nbsp; My husband finally got up and shut the bathroom door,
my daughter immediately started eating as if nothing had ever happened.&nbsp;
The experience totally freaked me out.&nbsp; After that we could swear
we would hear the children running barefoot through the kitchen, when we
would investigate the children would be sound asleep!!!!!&nbsp; We have
heard the apartment complex itself is haunted and after moving into 3 different
apartments here, I believe it.</B>

<BR><B>Ft. Phantom</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: wdbishop9960@sbcglobal.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I'm actually sending this story from a friend's computer. I'm 19
years old and I live in a small West Texas city called Abilene. One of
this city's main tourist sites is the old Ft. Phantom. Although there is
little more than ruins and a cemetary, our main source of water was built
very near this area. Along the shores of the lake there are many old cemetaries
and mysterious houses. One such place is about a mile away from the shore.
Rumor has it that this certain cemetary has been closed down since the
early 1980's, when the owner died. Anyway, my child's father and I and
a couple of our friends stumbled upon this place a couple years ago. It
was after midnight in August, and we were looking for a camping spot. After
a couple wrong turns, we came on to the gate of the graveyard. It was old
and rusty and standing wide open. My boyfriend and his friend tried to
show off by going in. My friend and I, both being sensitive to the paranormal,
saw the same image at the same time--a dead woman carrying a dead baby.
(Kinda freaky, considering I was pregnant for the first time and didn't
even know it, and I miscarried two months later). Of course we all jumped
into my friends car and took off. But the road seemed three times longer
leaving. We couldn't find our way out. Suddenly the pick-up just stopped.
Of course, I thought it had stalled, but that wasn't the case. My friend
had the gas pedal pressed all the way down, the wheels were spinning, and
we weren't moving. Finally, we began moving again. We high-tailed it home
and really freaked out. We hadn't been stuck in mud and the rear bumper
and the tailgate were messed up. They were in perfect shape until the incident.
Of course, there are many stories related to Lake Ft. Phantom, so I did
some research. It seems the last person buried in this certain cemetary
was in 1901. It was a pregnant woman. I don't know if the loss of my pregnancy
a couple months later was related, but to this day I won't go near that
part of the area. The very sense of malevolence is still so heavy it's
hard to breathe.</B>

<BR><B>Deja Vu</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: RABIDMONKEYNO6@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; This isnt really a ghost story but it still freaked me out.</B>
<BR><B>I was about eleven and I had a dream. Of course everyone has dreams
but this one was seriously odd. It felt like a dream but it didn't look
like one. I was floating above this city, I'm pretty sure it was Quincy,
and there were these buildings. Normal buildings, but they had a dreamyness
about them that I can't really explain. There were several men in the parking
lot, and they were fighting. One of them pulled a gun and began to empty
a clip, without aiming at all. I zoomed in on this and saw that the building
that they were in front of was a McDonalds. There were some very specific
details that I dont want to leave out.</B>
<BR><B>Bordering the parking lot was a row of hedges, low enough for the
men to jump over, which they did. The next building was a sad-looking,
grey bank. The men turned around the side of the bank and disappeared.
The police arrived with their lights flashing, then the ambulance, then
the fire trucks, in that order. I saw myself in the Mickey D's with my
mom and my friend and then I woke up.</B>
<BR><B>I forgot about the dream and continued in my normal life. A few
weeks later those mini Beenie Babies came out and my mom insisted that
we go imeadiately to the nearest McDonalds and acquire as many as possible.
At the time there was no McDonalds in my town so we went to the one in
Quincy or Braintree, I really cannot remember. While driving through the
town something tickled my memory and I realized this was the place from
my dream. I got scared but didnt tell my mom, because&nbsp; I knew she
wouldnt beleive me and neither would my friend.</B>
<BR><B>Whilst we dined, a group of men gathered in the parking lot. I began
to get really scared and asked my mom if she or my friend needed to use
the facilities. They both did, and since we were done eating we didnt worry
about someone stealing our food.</B>
<BR><B>I didnt really have to pee, but that was okay. While my friend was
washing her hands we heard sirens. I ran out and saw the police pulling
up, then the ambulance, then the firetrucks. I looked at our booth and
saw several bullets holes in the glass. If we had been sitting there we
could have died.</B>
<BR><B>Since then I have had a few psychic expiriances, but nothing to
set up a hotline over. Just predicting what people are about to say, or
if my teacher will be in class that day. Freaky, huh?</B><B></B>

<P><B>Creepy Childrens' Laughter</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jaznhunnie_84@yahoo.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>I've never really seen a ghost or anything like that and sometimes
I tend to doubt that 'they&nbsp; even exist. However, something strange
happened to me that I have often wondered as to wether it was just the
figment of my imagination or something else entirely different. It all
started in the new house that I am now living in with my family. It's brand
new and we've only lived in it for about a year, this particular 'incident'
that I am about to relate happened about 5 months ago so it is quite recent.
I was up late one night as usual because it was the weekend and I often
tend to be on the internet throughout the night chatting and surfing. It
must have been around 3 am when 'it' happened. My whole family by this
time were already asleep. I was the only one who was awake. It was dead
silent, the kind that occurs only during the very early hours of the morning.
I was, however, oblivious to all of this, being totally absorbed in what
I was doing. Then suddenly, this deep silence was broken by the sound of
a dog barking off in the distance. By this time, I became aware of the
noise outside and became attuned to it. The dog's barking somehow seemed
to be a warning of something sinister approaching. I know it sounds stupid
and it does seem ridiculous, but at that time the whole thing was very
eerie and I remembered telling myself to 'stop being scared. It's only
a stupid dog and you're just letting your imagination run away with you'.
Bearing this in mind, I tried to resume chatting again. However, what happened
next has got to be one of the most frightening experiences that ever happened
to me. Even thinking about it now still gives me the shivers though it
all seems like just some sort of a nightmare. Before I continue, I need
to add in a few more details for the reader to truly comprehend my story.
Our computer is located right next to the window in the family room. The
window reaches all the way down to the floor. During this particular incident
the blinds were drawn shut and the windows were firmly closed, yet you
could still hear noises from outside since it was so quiet. So anyway,
there I was by the computer, chatting away, when I started hearing this
soft laughter. Actually, it sounded more like children giggling. I tensed
up, wondering 'what the hell is that?' and thinking that it might be the
neighbour's kid having a sleep-over or something. It seemed really close
though, as if the kids were right next to the window. So I stood up, trying
not to think anything of it and peeked outside the window. Everything was
dark, including the neighbour's house. I tried listening for the noise
again but it seemed to have disappeared. It was completely silent and still.&nbsp;
Thinking that it might have been my mind playing tricks on me since I was
quite sleepy, I sat back down again and continued to chat. Unfortunately,
the creepy giggles returned. This time, they were much louder. At that
point I was convinced that the sounds were coming just right outside the
window. I could feel my heart beating faster by the minute yet I continued
to ignore them. I kept telling myself 'it's just your imagination. Calm
down. Ignore it. You're just being paranoid. Don t over-react', even when
the sounds didn't go away. As a matter of fact, they just seemed to be
growing louder and louder. It was only when I heard a child's voice ask
quite clearly and plainly&nbsp; what are you doing?' then more giggling
that I really panicked. I screamed as loud as I could and ran to my dad,
who had fallen asleep on the couch. I woke him up and my mum also woke
up since I yelled so loud. When I told them what happened, they thought
I was just imagining it. Yet I was really shaken up. I was too frightened
to go near the window or the computer and I still haven't had the guts
to go back to using the computer all by myself late at night or in the
wee hours of the morning. By the way, I'm not the only one who has experienced
this incident. My sister told me that it also happened to her in a different
occasion. She was also right near the window when she heard the sound of
children giggling and it occurred at around 2 am or so, quite similar to
the time that I heard the giggles. I don't have any idea on why my sister
and I heard those children laughing and who or what they really are. I
do know for a fact that my neighbour s only child is not the kind of person
who would pull pranks like that. In fact, she s always very quiet. Plus,
her parents are quite strict and she seems well-mannered and disciplined
so I very much doubt that it could have been her.&nbsp; I thought that
they maybe ghosts or something but I'm not so sure about that either. Maybe
some of you could explain what I heard and why it happened, and please
share your story if you've also experienced this.</B>

<BR><B>Can Animals Have a Sixth Sense</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: katieschieffer@excite.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Dear Shadowlands Ghost PageHi. I have been a big fan of your page
for a long time now, and had added a few of my stories some years back.
Nothing has happened to me since, until last nightLet me start off by saying
that I am married now, and expecting a baby in 4 months. My husband and
I rent out of an apartment that belongs to a friend of mine. It is connected
to their home, and is built on top of their garage.&nbsp; We've lived there
for about 2 years, and nothing really strange happened there until recentlyWe
used to have a dog, but she had to leave because she was causing some problems
in the house (I do miss her a lot) and she did once in a while act strange,
whine for no reason, or just bark at the ceiling, corners of the apartment,
etc.&nbsp; But I didn't think much of it, except that maybe there was something
there but no big deal, since I do believe in spirits and are not afraid
of most of my experiences with themOf course, my husband is a major skeptic.
He doesn't believe in any of that, but recently he explained to me that
he has had some weird but small things happen to him. He told me that when
he leaves the apartment sometimes, he swears he turns all the lights off
and the air conditioners. Upon returning home, (while I'm not there) the
lights are all on and so are the air conditioners. He thinks it's odd,
but kind of cracks it up to being his imagination, like maybe he didnt'
turn out the lights or whatever. I just smileAnyway, onto my story about
last night. We now have had a cat about 1 year old named Patches. She is
a sweet cat, lazy, and doesn't play much or respond to stimuli much like
most cats. Lately,though, she's been staring at the ceilings, chasing things
that are not there, and seems kind of in a trance like state sometimes.
Anyway, last night, I got home around 11 pm. I was tired, and my husband
was out late with some guys from work. He called me to tell me that he
would be home later, not too late, though. I got into my PJS and got a
drink of water and sat down on the couch for a few minutes just to wind
down before getting into bed. All of a sudden, I heard Patches playing
in the bedroom, I heard her bell on her collar, and heard her meowing.
I got up (granted it's getting harder to get up with the big belly :))
and went into the bedroom to check it out. But Patches wasn't there. I
called her name, walked back out into the living room and saw the oddest
thing. I had never seen her act like this before. There she was, laying
as close as possible to the front door, her paws tucked under, her nose
actually touching the door she was so close, but her eyes were locked on
the doorknob as if waiting for it to turn.&nbsp; I went up to her and asked
her if she was waiting for my husband to come home, even though I had never
seen her do this before. yea, maybe a dog waiting for you, but a cat? And
that close to the door? And why did I swear I heard her in the bedroom?&nbsp;
My cat begs for food all the time, so I got some cheese (her favorite)
and called her over. Usually she'd sprint right to me, but she seemed so
fixated on that doorknob. She didn't hardly look at me or the cheese. So
I just shrugged it off and went to bed. I awoke suddenly in the night,
saw that my husband wasn't home yet, and looked at the clock. It was 4:30
am. Curious, (and a bit worried because he hadn't called) I got up and
went out to the living room to see if maybe he was on the couch or something.
No one. But Patches was in the same exact position by the door! It was
so odd! So this time, I went over to her, shooed her away, (it took some
time) She kept looking at the ceiling then and meowing. I didn't feel any
real cold spots, it was a little cool, (the air was not on) but nothing
too out of the ordinary.&nbsp; I looked up though, and there were a swarm
of bugs on the ceiling by the door I had never seen before. What kind of
bugs were they? Grossed out, I got a broom and began killing them. Then
they were crawling on the wall. They had literally come from nowhere. Before
I had went to bed, there were no bugs because I would have remembered.
After killing most of them, I went to put back the broom. ALl of a sudden,
the kitchen shade on the window went flying up, and I jumped and screamed.&nbsp;
Wondering what the heck was going on, I continued to the front foyer area.
Patches of course was right back there, her nose pressed up against the
door and staring at the doorknob.&nbsp; And this time I noticed (gulp)
an array of flowers I have above my china cabinet had fallen oddly to the
floor. But I hadn't heard them fall. Perhaps because the kitchen shade
had made noise going up? (That was about the 3rd time in a couple weeks
the kitchen shade has just gone up and startled me).&nbsp; I was worried
about my husband too, so I called his cell phone. No answer. I wondered
if Patches knew something was wrong, or if something like a spirit was
there. Or maybe she was just waiting for my husband to come home. I just
had never seen her act so weird.&nbsp; &lt;br>&lt;br>I went back into the
bedroom, trying to sleep some more, but couldn't.&nbsp; I left Patches
to her comfy position by the door. All of a sudden, the alarm clock went
off. I jumped again! The alarm hadn't been set, especially for 5 in the
morning or so. I found that weird, too, but just shut it off. By this time
I was really getting irritated, so I went out into the living room again
and told the spirit that if it was there to knock it off because I was
tired and worried if my husband was coming home or not. Then I went back
to the kitchen to get some water. Another odd thing: One spot on the kitchen
floor was burning hot! I jumped back and almost burnt the bottom of my
left foot. Now I've heard of cold spots, but hot spots on the floor? Can
you or anyone explain this? There was nothing there to make the floor hot!
Especially something that hot. It almost burnt me.&lt;br>&lt;br>Patches
was still at her place by the door, fixated STILL on that dang doorknob.
What was with her? She meowed once in a while as if to be seeing something.
I always thought animals went a bit crazy when spirits were around, but
she was quite calm, just almost in a trance state. Anyway, I ended up falling
asleep and woke to find my husband had come home at 7 am. (MEN!) :) But
thank God he was home safe and sound. I didn't explain to him what had
happened that night, because, like I said, he is a skeptic and would have
blown it off. I'm not sure if there was something there last night, or
if it was just a coincidence that this stuff happened, or what. But that's
my story, I guess you can take it however you want! Thanks for letting
me share it.</B>

<BR><B>Bedford ghost from Tangi Ferrell</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tangi67@sbcglobal.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>You have to bare with me on this story because it happened about
20 years ago but the spirits are etched in my mind forever. I lived with
my family(twin sister, brother, mom and a dad) in Bedford Texas in a nice
middle class neighborhood. The house was built for us so no one else had
lived in it prior. For some reason that house, more specifically, the game
room always gave me the creeps. It always felt like some one was watching
me through the window in the door. I found out that my feelings where right.</B>
<BR><B>One night I was asleep and was awaken by something but I do not
remember what. As I turned my head to look out my bedroom door to my twin's
room across the hall I noticed two kids standing beside my bed. I remember
that the one spirit was a girl wearing a bonnet and a long dress (kind
of like the costumes of Little House on the Prairie) and the other spirit
was a little boy shorter than the girl so I assumed he was younger. They
both where standing beside my bed staring at me. I immediately sat up and
turned on my light. When my light turned on they were gone. The next morning
I asked my mom about it and she told me I must of dreamed it all. Well,
about 6 years later we moved out of that house to a ranch in the country
(Boyd, Texas). One day my mom asked me if I remembered when I saw the two
kids beside my bed one night. I said yes, my mom then tells me that it
was not a dream and that we had a spirit living in that house. My mom then
tells me that she would hear the front door open and close a couple of
times and then my dad would check the door but to find it was still locked
and no one awake to open it. Now to open this door you had to jerk on it
because it was a 2-3 inch solid oak door. The door being opened happened
frequently through out the years we lived there but my mom said she did
not tell us because she did not want us to be scared Also things would
be moved in the house and the reappear.</B>
<BR><B>Now on a lighter note.......While my husband was on patrol (as a
deputy in Virginia) he was dispatched to a old empty building that used
to be a hospital. The dispatched said a called claimed there was someone
in the building and was opening the windows and making alot of noise. My
husband and two other cops went inside the building but found nothing.
So they decided to have a chat standing on the second floor in the middle
of the night in the this building. Well, as they were talking they started
hearing foot steps coming towards them. All three stopped talking and watched
as&nbsp; "nothing" came towards them but you could hear the steps. When
the steps stopped right next to them and there was nothing there my husband&nbsp;
said they ran out of that building and refused to ever go bake in. If I
could have been there to see three cops run that fast away from something
(probable cussing), it would have been amusing.</B>
<BR><B>Anyways there have few other encounters I have had but my husband
says he still does not believe in ghost but will not talk of his encounter
anymore (only that one time he told me). Thanks for reading this.</B><B></B>

<P><B>An Experience in St. Paul</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mahanfan@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This happened over a decade ago, when I was a senior in</B>
<BR><B>high school, and I've had neurosurgery since, so please</B>
<BR><B>forgive any misspelled words or the like.</B>
<BR><B>In any event, the school I attended had a mandatory program</B>
<BR><B>where seniors, for the month of May, had to design a</B>
<BR><B>project outside of the classroom environment and present it</B>
<BR><B>in some form or another (artwork, music, research papers,</B>
<BR><B>whatever).&nbsp; Now, to no-one's surprise at the time, my</B>
<BR><B>project involved working as an intern at the Minnesota</B>
<BR><B>Historical Society, which at that time was headquartered in</B>
<BR><B>the James J. Hill house, as the History Center had not yet</B>
<BR><B>been built.&nbsp; I should explain for any readers that I enjoy</B>
<BR><B>history a great deal, and am, in fact, planning on grad</B>
<BR><B>school for it as quickly as possible.</B>
<BR><B>Right!&nbsp; Back to the story!&nbsp; In any case, my supervisor
was</B>
<BR><B>the stepfather of a friend of mine, and he (my friend) and</B>
<BR><B>I were also involved in a dramatic production together that</B>
<BR><B>had rehearsals after normal school hours, so we'd jaw about</B>
<BR><B>what had been happening at school/at the MHS and what-not.</B>
<BR><B>So, I'm working by myself over lunch on the third floor of</B>
<BR><B>the Hill House, in a small office writing over a table, and</B>
<BR><B>have been for some time, when I decide to stretch and give</B>
<BR><B>my arms a break.&nbsp; I half-turned towards the door, and saw a</B>
<BR><B>gentleman dressed in 19th Century attire walk past the</B>
<BR><B>door.&nbsp; "He" was hazy and indistinct, but I could see what</B>
<BR><B>appeared to be a coat and suggestion of a cane, as well as</B>
<BR><B>a suggestion of facial hair (sideburns and a beard).&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>apparition was looking down the hallway, which the logical</B>
<BR><B>part of my mind thought odd, as it dog-legged and</B>
<BR><B>dead-ended in offices (which happened to be empty).</B>
<BR><B>Meanwhile, the slightly-less-rational part of my mind was</B>
<BR><B>screaming "IT'S A GHOST, STUPID!"; oddly, I wasn't afraid,</B>
<BR><B>or even chilled or any of the other phenomena "usually"</B>
<BR><B>associated with ghosts-"he" just walked by the door.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>know it wasn't any of my co-workers; as I said, I was alone</B>
<BR><B>on the third floor, and, thanks to hardwood stairs, I'd</B>
<BR><B>have heard anyone returning.&nbsp; Instead, I walked down to the</B>
<BR><B>front desk and reported what had just happened, and they</B>
<BR><B>commented that "no-one had reported that one before".&nbsp; THAT</B>
<BR><B>sent a little shiver down my spine.</B>
<BR><B>The denouement was rather funny; I relayed this story to my</B>
<BR><B>friend on the Thursday it happened at play practice.</B>
<BR><B>Friday, he took me aside with a wide grin on his face and</B>
<BR><B>told me he'd told his family what I'd said at the supper</B>
<BR><B>table, and Phil (his step-dad) slammed his fist down on the</B>
<BR><B>table and exclaimed, "G-d d@mmit!&nbsp; I've been working there</B>
<BR><B>for THREE YEARS, and I haven't seen S--T, and he comes in</B>
<BR><B>for less than two weeks and sees a ghost!"&nbsp; Apparently it</B>
<BR><B>was, and perhaps still is, a badge of honor...</B>

<P><B>2 Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: chisspa@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Me and my big mouth</B>
<BR><B>Well this happen like three years ago, I was living in Guadalajara
(Mexico) at the time, in September I was going to a small town located
in Guanaguato, this town is San Miguel de Allende, we were going to the
pamplonada, you know the pamplonada is an major event here in Mexico is
like the one in Pamplona (Spain) this event is were they close the streets
of the down town and let the bulls lose and people run in front of them,
anyway I was riding with four other friends 2 guys and 2 girls, I was the
copilot, we hit the road at 6 pm and headed to San Miguel when it started
to get dark proximally like 2 hrs leather we started to talk about this
things you know ghost stories, I dont know why but in every road trip
when its getting dark you always tell ghost stories, I think is human
nature to do that, ok so like half an hour before reaching San Miguel,
Juan and I we wanted to take a leak but the problem was that exactly 60
Km before reaching San Miguel is were the high way ends and you take a
rural road and is very dark and the road is full with curves, so thats
why I say its a little bit danger, well as a good human that Im I was
telling them to stop that I couldnt hold it any more and so was Juan and
the girls didnt want to stop and all the sudden I dont know why I said
it but I did, I told them, whats the worst that can happen that appears
to us the lady in white at that time we took a curve an there she was
standing on the side of the road, on my side exactly, I remember her perfectly
it was a young woman in a white dress and I remember that she stood there
staring at us while we were passing her by, the tow girls and the guy that
was driving scream as laud as they could, I just got this chili feeling
and like three kilometers after we stop and Juan and I took that leak,
as we returned to the car the only thing that they told me please dont
say anything in the rest of the road, this is one of the worst experiences
that I ever had. Good night and sweet dreams.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My house experiences</B>
<BR><B>This was the last house that I lived in Guadalajara, the first encounter
that I had was the first day that we moved in, I was there with a roommate
and his girlfriend and another friend, we were standing in the living room,
Guti and Jimena were standing with there back to the stairs and Rodo and
I were standing in front of them, we didnt have any furnisher in yet so
we were talking there and all the sodden I saw a shadow walk down the stairs
and stopping in the middle and the it disappeared I turned to Rodo and
told him did you sow that and he told me the same thing at the same time
but no one believe us, then like one year leather it was like 4 am and
I was with my girlfriend seating in the living room talking and all the
sudden she just steer at the stairs and went pail and told me I didnt
believed you but I just saw it.</B>
<BR><B>One night I was with Red in my living room we were seen some movies
at night, in the living room theres a window that goes from the floor
to the sealing and you can see in the reflection of the up stairs, thats
the hallway of the rooms because theres no wall on it you can see the
three doors, we were the only two persons in the house and then we heard
one of the doors open up so for a reaction I look at the window and I
saw a shadow walking from Gutis room to Robs room and then that room
door opened, it took us like a minute or two to react and told Red hey
were are the only ones in the house arent we and the he told me yes did
you saw it two, yes he told me he saw a person trough the reflection and
I told him a saw a shadow but we concurred we saw some one go from one
room to another then he told me maybe its Shatos girlfriend but two minutes
leather she came in from the street, we didnt tell her anything so she
didnt get scared so she went up stairs to Shatos room that is next to
Robs room and the she ask us if there was some one up there and we told
her that no ones is up there and she told us that she was hearing things
in Robs room and run down stairs, so I went to check things up and there
were no one in any room.</B>

<P><B>My Stepmother</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: anonymous</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Well I should tell you that I am now 62 years old and I was just
a young</B>
<BR><B>man when we, my father my stepmother and me lived a good life.&nbsp;
I went</B>
<BR><B>to school and they were happy.&nbsp; Well it seems good things all
come to an</B>
<BR><B>end and one night, I later found out the reason, when I came home
from</B>
<BR><B>school I found my stepmother was gone.&nbsp; I found out later that
my Father</B>
<BR><B>was having an affair with another lady from town.</B>
<BR><B>Me and my father sat alone for three nights after eating leftovers
and</B>
<BR><B>waiting on&nbsp; word where she was.&nbsp; She took nothing that
my Father could</B>
<BR><B>see with her. On the third day my Father and I smelled a horrible
smell</B>
<BR><B>and after several hours found my Step-mother dead.&nbsp; We lived
in a big</B>
<BR><B>two story house and found my step-mother in a room we called her
sewing</B>
<BR><B>room.&nbsp; She was not in the room though, she was in the crawl
space beside</B>
<BR><B>the room.&nbsp; We assumed she crawled in there after she took the
pills so</B>
<BR><B>she wouldnt be discovered in time.&nbsp; It was awful.&nbsp; The
room was a</B>
<BR><B>smaller one with the sewing table and machine.&nbsp; the closet
and at the</B>
<BR><B>bottom of the closet was a small opening with a little door to the
crawl</B>
<BR><B>space.&nbsp; Thats where we found her.</B>
<BR><B>Well it all went to hell after that, literally.&nbsp; And I should
tell you</B>
<BR><B>that all the memories of my step-mother were good, she was never
mean to</B>
<BR><B>me.&nbsp; The police officer with the coroner that was called out
that night</B>
<BR><B>to pick up the body got the job of getting the body out of the crawl</B>
<BR><B>space.&nbsp; She was curled in a position and they didnt know if
they could</B>
<BR><B>get her out.&nbsp; So I remember the cop taking off his belt and
crawling in</B>
<BR><B>with his flashlite and giving the most scarest scream I have ever
heard.</B>
<BR><B>It scared me so bad that I wet my pants.&nbsp; He came out yelling
and went</B>
<BR><B>down the stairs almost falling down them and outside.&nbsp; I went
with my</B>
<BR><B>father out to him.&nbsp; He had a blooded whelp on his cheek.&nbsp;
And he said</B>
<BR><B>she scratched him.&nbsp; Well the coroner sent him away and made
a call for</B>
<BR><B>an assistant of his.&nbsp; The coroner told my Father that the cop
must have</B>
<BR><B>gotten scared in the small space and scratched himself on a nail
from</B>
<BR><B>the roof or something.</B>
<BR><B>So to make a long story short.&nbsp; My father and the coroner got
her body</B>
<BR><B>out of the crawlspace that night after alot of work cutting on the</B>
<BR><B>opening.</B>
<BR><B>Nothing happened for weeks.&nbsp; Then my Father had the other woman
over for</B>
<BR><B>the weekend she came friday night and cooked supper for us.&nbsp;
Then</B>
<BR><B>Saturday night she brought her things and was spending the night.&nbsp;
She</B>
<BR><B>was taking a bath in the bathroom right across from the sewing room.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>was told to stay downstairs in the living room where I was at. this
was</B>
<BR><B>because there was no exhaust fans back then and we would have to
leave</B>
<BR><B>the bathroom door open to take a hot bath.&nbsp; So me and my Father
hear her</B>
<BR><B>scream and run tripping down the stairs naked.&nbsp; She screamed
at my</B>
<BR><B>Father to take her home.&nbsp; He did and left me home.&nbsp; I
later heard her</B>
<BR><B>account that she had seen my step-mother standing in the doorway
across</B>
<BR><B>from the bathroom, the doorway of the sewing room staring her.&nbsp;
At that</B>
<BR><B>moment she said the mirror on the medicine cabinet shattered.&nbsp;
This did</B>
<BR><B>happen with the mirror we saw after my Father came home.&nbsp; Nothing</B>
<BR><B>happened the rest of that night.&nbsp; The next night things were
terrrible,</B>
<BR><B>I ran to my Fathers bed crying because I had been awakend by crying
and</B>
<BR><B>moaning from someone else in the house.&nbsp; I was terrified.&nbsp;
My Father</B>
<BR><B>woke and heard it too.&nbsp; We walked into the hallway and heard
it</B>
<BR><B>distinctly coming from the sewing room.&nbsp; My father went to
the room and</B>
<BR><B>then I followed scared to be to far away from him.&nbsp; No one
inside.&nbsp; He</B>
<BR><B>and I walked into the room and the crying and loathing was coming
from</B>
<BR><B>the opening to the crawl space.&nbsp; That was the first time I
ever saw</B>
<BR><B>tears run down my Fathers face.</B>
<BR><B>The next which happened to be a Saturday I think.&nbsp; My father
and I went</B>
<BR><B>to the Lumber Yard and he bought wood and nails and a few buckets
of</B>
<BR><B>splaster of paris.&nbsp; We went home and my Father proceeded tear
out the</B>
<BR><B>door to the sewing room and to frame and lathe it and plaster and
later</B>
<BR><B>paint it as if it was never a doorway.&nbsp; He did not remove anything
from</B>
<BR><B>the room which was items and clothing belonging to my dead step-mother.</B>
<BR><B>He sealed it up in the room. There was a single window in the room
to</B>
<BR><B>the outside.</B>
<BR><B>I was around 8 years old then and to this day I have never spoken
of my</B>
<BR><B>step-mother, she was from the decatur area and her parents were
her only</B>
<BR><B>family besides us and they had died before she met my Father.&nbsp;
So I</B>
<BR><B>guess it was easy to forget.&nbsp; My Father has long since past
away and I</B>
<BR><B>being his only son own the house.&nbsp; I was gone spending a career
with</B>
<BR><B>Army, it seems like a lifetime ago now, and came home to my Father
just</B>
<BR><B>when he came down sick.&nbsp; He past away after about a year.&nbsp;
We never</B>
<BR><B>spoke of the past.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Truck in the Driveway</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: j_billman@loveable.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi, this is my experience. One night i was staying the night at a
friends house just 3 houses down from mine. Keep in mind that it was in
the country so the houses are kinda far apart. But it was still walking
distance. But my friend and i had to walk back to my house because i forgotten
something there. Nobody was home at my house so there were no cars in the
driveway. How my driveway is set up you can only enter and exit one way.
The rest of it is surrounded by trees. But we were halfway there and a
truck passed. It turned into my drive circled the tree and parked.( there
is a big tree in my driveway that you have to circle, there's no way of
not circling it.) But the dog started barking and the motion light came
on. We made it there after a&nbsp; few minutes. When we got there, nobody
was there. The truck was gone. But no other vehicles passed us on the road.
And nobody left the driveway. I'm not too much of a believer of ghosts
and stuff but there is no other explaintion. I ha</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;ve a few other things that happened to me , stuff like having
the feeling that someone is watching me and hearing people walk around
and talking when nobody else is around. But feel free to email me if you
would like at j_billman@loveable.com. Thank you for reading my story.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Park</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: wingo86_9@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>somewhere in between grand coulee and wenachee there is a park right
beside</B>
<BR><B>a lake where i heard your not supposed to ever sleep. my friend
from</B>
<BR><B>washington said that she spent the night there with her grandma
one time and</B>
<BR><B>there was a small knock on the window of their suberban window and
they</B>
<BR><B>heard a light whisper "look at me". her grandma said "kids,get under
the</B>
<BR><B>blanket and dont listen to it. dont look at it."</B>
<BR><B>then again there was a knock "look at me" this went on for about
3 min.</B>
<BR><B>without it changing its tone, but then it(whatever it was) started
getting</B>
<BR><B>angry.the knocks got louder and harder and instead of a light whisper
the</B>
<BR><B>voice turned into a scream "LOOK AT MEEEE!" then all at once it
went away.</B>
<BR><B>she said they stayed under the blanket the rest of the night and
when they</B>
<BR><B>woke up and got out of the car,right beside the window,the gravel
by that</B>
<BR><B>certain window was cleared out in a perfect circle. later that day
she asked</B>
<BR><B>her grandma why they couldnt look and she told them of a story about
2</B>
<BR><B>teenagers who were doing the same thing they were (camping out in
their car</B>
<BR><B>in the same place) who that same exact thing happened to only one
of them</B>
<BR><B>looked.that young man was found the next morning with his eyes wide
open and</B>
<BR><B>sitting straight up.he had died of a heart attack at the age of
18&nbsp; even</B>
<BR><B>though he was n perfect health. its said that the other boy is now
in a</B>
<BR><B>mental institution since he awoke to his friend that way. supposedly
the</B>
<BR><B>only thing he said when they found him was "i told him it would
get him if</B>
<BR><B>he looked." some say it is a ghost,others say a demon. Either way....
not</B>
<BR><B>many people s tay at that park anymore.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Office</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:Anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was in high school I got a job cleaning the local title company
once</B>
<BR><B>a week (it was a very small town in northeastern Arizona).&nbsp;
My sister worked</B>
<BR><B>there as one of the agents, and I knew the other employees very
well.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>company rented an old house in the oldest part of the tiny town
I lived in,</B>
<BR><B>and as far as I know still use it today (this was ten years ago).&nbsp;
None of</B>
<BR><B>the women working in the office would ever stay after dark, even
to get work</B>
<BR><B>done if they were behind.&nbsp; All of them swore that it was haunted.</B>
<BR><B>I must add that as a teenager I was fearless and thought that I
was</B>
<BR><B>immortal.&nbsp; Not much ever scared me.&nbsp; I was fascinated
by the "idea" of</B>
<BR><B>ghosts, but didn't really believe in them at that time.&nbsp; I
would come in</B>
<BR><B>after school in the evenings, when everyone was gone.&nbsp; I had
a set routine</B>
<BR><B>for what I was supposed to do, and I took my time doing it the first
couple</B>
<BR><B>of times.&nbsp; That is until I kept getting these weird feelings.&nbsp;
The office</B>
<BR><B>was VERY cold and I kept getting the chills - the kind where your
skin feels</B>
<BR><B>like it's going to crawl right off of your bones.&nbsp; And I kept
hearing the</B>
<BR><B>front door open.&nbsp; Because the house the office was in was so
old, the door</B>
<BR><B>made a distinct creaking noise whenever it opened.&nbsp; Thinking
someone was</B>
<BR><B>there to work after hours I went up to the front office.&nbsp; No
one.&nbsp; The door</B>
<BR><B>was shut and locked just as I had left it when I came in.&nbsp;
I thought that</B>
<BR><B>was strange, but no big deal. Figured I was hearing things. Went
back to</B>
<BR><B>cleaning.&nbsp; Heard the front door open again.&nbsp; Went and
checked.&nbsp; Again there</B>
<BR><B>was nothing.&nbsp; I kinda felt that was weird but didn't want to
let my</B>
<BR><B>imagination run wild so I just kept working and tried to distract
myself</B>
<BR><B>with other thoughts.&nbsp; Then I heard someone knocking on the
door.&nbsp; I went to</B>
<BR><B>peek out (the door had a big window on it) - it was dark outside
except for</B>
<BR><B>the porch light (which eventually quit working).&nbsp; Not a soul
stirred</B>
<BR><B>outside.&nbsp; I figured someone was trying to play a joke on me
and I found</B>
<BR><B>myself wishing the the window on the door had curtains so that no
one</B>
<BR><B>outside could see in.</B>
<BR><B>After a few weeks the noises never changed and though they bothered
me, I</B>
<BR><B>kind of got used to them.&nbsp; I added a radio to listen to so
that I could</B>
<BR><B>escape the noises.&nbsp; I was becoming more jumpy - and the chills
were still</B>
<BR><B>around.&nbsp; By this time the porch light wouldn't work anymore
and it was so</B>
<BR><B>dark outside when the knocking would begin that I wouldn't even
go to the</B>
<BR><B>door to look outside anymore.&nbsp; I just made sure I locked myself
in when I</B>
<BR><B>started working, and ignored the sounds.</B>
<BR><B>I would sing along to the radio at the top of my voice, it made
me feel</B>
<BR><B>better.&nbsp; Until one day the radio switched stations by itself!&nbsp;
I went up to</B>
<BR><B>it and switched it back to the right station - with goosebumps all
over my</B>
<BR><B>body.&nbsp; It wouldn't stay.&nbsp; So I just turned it off and
sang to myself.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>noises picked up in frequency and the feeling of being watched became
more</B>
<BR><B>intense.&nbsp; I had the creeps constantly in that place and found
myself</B>
<BR><B>dreading my weekly cleaning visits.&nbsp; I started asking my mom
or my sister to</B>
<BR><B>come with me.&nbsp; They were always busy with other things.&nbsp;
I couldn't wait for</B>
<BR><B>my mom to pick me up at night.&nbsp; I hated waiting in that place
for her to</B>
<BR><B>come and get me.&nbsp; Eventually I got my own car and was dreading
being there,</B>
<BR><B>but also dreading making the long dark walk down the sidewalk to
my car when</B>
<BR><B>the cleaning was done.&nbsp; I didn't tell anyone my feelings, I
didn't think</B>
<BR><B>that they would believe me.</B>
<BR><B>My boss started complaining to my sister that I wasn't doing all
of the</B>
<BR><B>chores I was supposed to.&nbsp; Apparently after I would dust a
desk and</B>
<BR><B>straighten things up or empty and take out the trash - they would
come into</B>
<BR><B>work the next day and everything would be a mess again.</B>
<BR><B>There was an old cellar in that building.&nbsp; And I could never
get the door to</B>
<BR><B>stay shut.&nbsp; I used to have to go in the room where the stairs
were to get</B>
<BR><B>the cleaning supplies and that damn door would always be open no
matter how</B>
<BR><B>many times I shut it.&nbsp; I began to hear footsteps follow me
from room to</B>
<BR><B>room - see things move out of the corner of my eye.&nbsp; And a
rising feeling to</B>
<BR><B>flee - though I managed to keep that under control.&nbsp; My right
mind knew that</B>
<BR><B>there was no one there and I was NOT going to leave simply because
I was</B>
<BR><B>afraid!&nbsp; I just switched my shift to Saturdays, cleaning during
the day when</B>
<BR><B>it was light outside.</B>
<BR><B>I was actively involved in a lot of clubs and events in school and
I picked</B>
<BR><B>up another job at the local theater.&nbsp; So Saturdays weren't
always possible</B>
<BR><B>for me.&nbsp; I had to go whenever I could make it.&nbsp; One day
I showed up and as I</B>
<BR><B>was cleaning I became so sleepy and time just stood still.&nbsp;
I kept dropping</B>
<BR><B>everything and spilling everything and what normally took me an
hour was</B>
<BR><B>turning into a 2.5 hour ordeal.&nbsp; I just couldn't seem to think
clearly or</B>
<BR><B>get anything done properly.&nbsp; It was weird.&nbsp; I went into
my boss's office to</B>
<BR><B>empty the trash and as I was leaning down to pick up the trash can
I heard</B>
<BR><B>the usual footsteps and creaking floorboards. All of a sudden the
blinds on</B>
<BR><B>the window came flying off the wall with such force!&nbsp; They
narrowly missed</B>
<BR><B>my head!!&nbsp; Absolutely scared the crap out of me.&nbsp; I did
the best I could to</B>
<BR><B>remount them on the wall, but my hands were shaking so badly I didn't
do a</B>
<BR><B>very good job.</B>
<BR><B>So I just got the heck out of his office and went to the front office.&nbsp;
Off</B>
<BR><B>the front office was a little dark room with tiny windows and a
dirt floor.</B>
<BR><B>It sat lower than the rest of the house, and that was where they
kept their</B>
<BR><B>files.&nbsp; I needed to go in there, but certainly did not want
to, that room</B>
<BR><B>was so cold and wet and creepy.&nbsp; But as I turned the knob to
that door, the</B>
<BR><B>phone rang.&nbsp; I turned to go and get the phone when the door
to that little</B>
<BR><B>room flew open with such force that it slammed into my face and
split my</B>
<BR><B>eyebrow open!!&nbsp; I was bleeding everywhere!&nbsp; My eye swelled
up and I couldn't</B>
<BR><B>see.&nbsp; The person on the phone was my mom and she came and got
me and took me</B>
<BR><B>to see if I needed to get stitches.&nbsp; I quit after that.&nbsp;
No more!</B>
<BR><B>The women at the office always said that it was haunted.&nbsp; But
they would</B>
<BR><B>never tell me why.&nbsp; But I have the scar on my face to prove
it!</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Duplex</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: vehicle@ticon.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I know at least once in my life I've had what I think is a paranormal</B>
<BR><B>experience.&nbsp; Back in 1997, I lived with my boyfriend for a
while in a duplex in</B>
<BR><B>Madison, Wisconsin.&nbsp; This was not the greatest neighborhood
but the house,</B>
<BR><B>itself seemed perfectly normal to me.&nbsp; It looked fairly new
but as I later</B>
<BR><B>discovered this house was actually an old house that had been remodeled
so much</B>
<BR><B>inside and out that it looked practically brand new and was converted
into a</B>
<BR><B>duplex. The first strange thing that I noticed was that I had been
having very</B>
<BR><B>vivid nightmares every night I stayed there.&nbsp; I would wake
up feeling very</B>
<BR><B>shaken with a depressed state of mind each morning from these awful
dreams.</B>
<BR><B>What makes this so odd is that I've never had nightmares until I
slept in this</B>
<BR><B>house and now that I'm no longer living there, I don't ever have
any nightmares</B>
<BR><B>now. If I do dream at all, I have weird dreams but nothing that
terrifies me</B>
<BR><B>like the dreams I had in that Madison duplex.&nbsp; I even remember
a dream that I</B>
<BR><B>had while taking a short nap on the couch in the living room while
living</B>
<BR><B>there.&nbsp; I dreamt that I was being chased through a huge house
with a winding</B>
<BR><B>staircase by a man with a knife.&nbsp; My boyfriend also had things
of his taken.</B>
<BR><B>Once he could not find his driver's liscense and after months of
searching, he</B>
<BR><B>gave up only to find it with his landlord in the crawlspace upstairs!
Our</B>
<BR><B>landlord had told us about a woman who lived in the house at one
time who</B>
<BR><B>practiced witchcraft.&nbsp; I oftem wonder if that had anything
to do with the</B>
<BR><B>strange occurances in that house.&nbsp; The night we went to move
the last of our</B>
<BR><B>things out of the house, I remember feeling an extreme hatred directed
at us by</B>
<BR><B>some invisible force.&nbsp; I couldn't stand to be in there any
longer so my</B>
<BR><B>boyfriend finished bringing our belongings out himself.&nbsp; I
told him about why I</B>
<BR><B>had been so anxious and tense only to find out that he also sensed
a</B>
<BR><B>malevolence that night too. I have more to tell but I don't want
this story to</B>
<BR><B>be too long!</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Aunty's House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Louiseeb@iprimus.com.au</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This story
is no way near as scary as some of the other ones that</B>
<BR><B>I have read on this site. It is about my Aunty and Uncle's house.
My parents</B>
<BR><B>and my older brother moved from England to Australia before I was
born. Because</B>
<BR><B>all of my relatives still live in England we make sure that we visit
them</B>
<BR><B>quite regularly and it was on one of these visits that I found out
about</B>
<BR><B>Mr.Sully. My Aunty and Uncle live in a nice house in a town quite
close to</B>
<BR><B>Oxford. It is in a busy street and not your stereotypical scary
setting,</B>
<BR><B>this is what made Mr. Sully more surprising. There have been a lot
of super</B>
<BR><B>natural things that have happened in this area, I think because
it is situated</B>
<BR><B>between a prison and a military base but you wouldn't guess it because
the</B>
<BR><B>town is just so beautiful.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Anyway I found out about the ghost in my Aunty's house named
Mr.Sully when</B>
<BR><B>one night of our stay there my friend and I, who were sharing a
room downstairs</B>
<BR><B>while everyone else was upstairs, woke in the middle of the night
to hear</B>
<BR><B>a strange drumming noise coming from what sounded like between the
walls.</B>
<BR><B>In my sleepy state I asked my friend to shut up and she replied
that it was</B>
<BR><B>probably my Uncle playing the bongos upstairs. For some reason I
was satisfied</B>
<BR><B>with this rediculous answer and fell straight back asleep. In the
morning</B>
<BR><B>we were laughing about it because it was like we both had been sleep
talking</B>
<BR><B>to each other and my Aunty overheard. It was then that she told
us about</B>
<BR><B>the ghost that had been living with them since they had moved in
20 odd years</B>
<BR><B>ago. Of course we made her sit down and tell us every detail. My
Aunty's</B>
<BR><B>house is a quaint two story house, my two cousins who at the time
were 19</B>
<BR><B>and 23 had bedrooms on the second floor and the ground floor was
just their</B>
<BR><B>basic living area. Out the back at the bottom of there garden is
a granny</B>
<BR><B>flat. Before they had moved in Mr. Sully's body was found in the
granny flat,</B>
<BR><B>nothing gruesome he had just died of old age.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;My oldest cousin Will seemed to have a special relationship
with Mr. Sully</B>
<BR><B>when he was very little my Aunty would see him staring, pointing
and laughing</B>
<BR><B>at something behind her she was always to scared to turn around
and look</B>
<BR><B>to see what it was. Other things happened as well but nothing that
would</B>
<BR><B>scare them or make them move. Will seemed to grow out of Mr.Sully
and my</B>
<BR><B>other cousin Charlie never seemed to be bothered by him. They would
hear</B>
<BR><B>clanging and banging in rooms that were empty but they would just
know it</B>
<BR><B>was Mr. Sully. He became like part of their family. The only time
that he</B>
<BR><B>would cause trouble would be when they were renovating or moving
things around,</B>
<BR><B>I think because he thought that they were moving away. He was quite
active</B>
<BR><B>before we came to visit because they had been doing magor renovations
in</B>
<BR><B>preparation for us to stay, things would fall off shelves and there
would</B>
<BR><B>be banging in the walls, My Aunty and Uncle literally had to sit
down together</B>
<BR><B>and talk to Mr. Sully explaining that they weren't going anywhere
and that</B>
<BR><B>my Uncle was doing the renovating himself. After that it was all
quite again</B>
<BR><B>until we heard him that night in bed. We weren't scared of him because
he</B>
<BR><B>seemed quite friendly I feel a little bad now that maybe he thought
that</B>
<BR><B>we were intruders.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Touching base with my Aunty and Uncle every so often we have
learned that</B>
<BR><B>the latest Mr. Sully episode happened when Will and his girlfriend
were up</B>
<BR><B>in his room and his girlfriend saw Mr. Sully sitting next to Will
on his</B>
<BR><B>bed. I am not sure why she could see him and Will couldnt but it
gives me</B>
<BR><B>a warm feeling that even though my cousin can no longer see his
companion</B>
<BR><B>he is still there watching out for him.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Thanks for reading this and I would love for anyone who wants
to to get</B>
<BR><B>back to me to e-mail me. I would love to hear from you!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Find Help</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: wingo86_9@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>again,when i went to see my dad that summer in washington i went
to spend</B>
<BR><B>the weekend with my friends in wenachee. we had to take 2 cars.
one with me</B>
<BR><B>and ruth-anne, the other with sarah,roma,the 2 girls and the baby
boy.on the</B>
<BR><B>way home we got to the bottom of the bridge and there was a man
hitchiking</B>
<BR><B>in a pair of bluejeans, a green t-shrt and a blue hat.we were gonna
pick him</B>
<BR><B>up, but we decided it was a little crazy cause we heard stories
of murderer</B>
<BR><B>hitchikers and thigs so we decided to keep on driving.but when we
got to the</B>
<BR><B>top of the hill there he was again.there is no possible way he could
have</B>
<BR><B>got there before us.and when we looked back he was gone. the creepy
thing</B>
<BR><B>about this is that the car load behind us(roma sarah and the kids)
told us</B>
<BR><B>the same exact,when we got back, story we just encountered. later
we found</B>
<BR><B>out that there had been a big truck driving accident about 5 years
back at</B>
<BR><B>the bottom of that hill and the truck driver was found dead at the
top. it</B>
<BR><B>looked as if he was trying to walk and find help.</B>
