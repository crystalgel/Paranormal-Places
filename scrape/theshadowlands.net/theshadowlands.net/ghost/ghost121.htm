<b>Mother's Experiences with Paranormal</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Reload8476@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hi Dave! My name is John.&nbsp; I myself have always been interesed
in the</b>
<br><b>paranormal, and am disappointed that parapsychologists, and ameteur
gho0st</b>
<br><b>hunters are not treated with more respect then they are.&nbsp; There
is stuff</b>
<br><b>going on out there, and to think that only the tangible is what
is real is</b>
<br><b>arrogant to say the least.&nbsp; the following are a few experiences
my mother has</b>
<br><b>had.&nbsp; She has always been prone to 'feelings' whether that
be ESP or</b>
<br><b>intuition, I cannot say.&nbsp; Unfortunatly (or fortunatly?) I have
never had any</b>
<br><b>real paranormal encounters, with the exception of walking through</b>
<br><b>unexplainable cold spots.&nbsp; But enough about me.. this is my
mom's</b>
<br><b>account..feel free to correct mistakes or fix it up in any ways
you deem fit</b>
<br><b>for your page.&nbsp; (incidently, how did you survive your experiences?
If I had</b>
<br><b>been in your place, I don't know what i would have done!)</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When my mother had just graduated business college,
she moverd in and out</b>
<br><b>of several appartments in her home city in Nebraska.&nbsp; The first
was in an</b>
<br><b>overall run down portion of town with many old buildings.&nbsp;
She came across an</b>
<br><b>old house where the upstairs was converted to two tiny appartments.
One</b>
<br><b>night, a week or so after moving in, she woke up around 3 am and
felt very</b>
<br><b>strongly, a presence.&nbsp; For some reason, the presence radiated
a coldness</b>
<br><b>(literally) and a hostility she couldn't put a finger on.&nbsp;
My mother is very</b>
<br><b>inquisitive, almost to a fault.&nbsp; She also does not scare easily.&nbsp;
But when</b>
<br><b>she consiously tried to move to turn over to see who could be in
her room,</b>
<br><b>she found she could not open her eyes or turn over!!&nbsp; She was
consiously</b>
<br><b>trying, but couldnot investigate.&nbsp; She was starting to get
scared now, but</b>
<br><b>she just layed there hoping whatever it was would go away.&nbsp;
She must have</b>
<br><b>drifted off, because she awoke in the morning only to find she was
alone.</b>
<br><b>She chaulked this up to a dream.&nbsp; But the next day, when she
got home from</b>
<br><b>work, she tried to walk into her bedroom, only to find that the
same eerie</b>
<br><b>cold and forboding prevailed.&nbsp; It was almost like she couldn't
walk into her</b>
<br><b>room!!&nbsp; She had had enough and she went to a hotel for the
night...She sent</b>
<br><b>some co-workers over to the appartment to gather some things from
her</b>
<br><b>bedroom, and never returned.&nbsp; Her co-workers reported a strange
cold in the</b>
<br><b>room, while the thermostate read 70 degrees, far from chilly!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A later experience she had, again in an apartment,
albeit a different one</b>
<br><b>was when she was cooking dinner for herself.&nbsp; She felt a quite
real and very</b>
<br><b>solid 'punch' on her shoulder, as she descirbes it.&nbsp; Almost
as though someone</b>
<br><b>bumped into her like at a busy store or airport. She turned around,
and saw a</b>
<br><b>man.&nbsp; He too turned from facing the opposite direction, as
though they were</b>
<br><b>walking opposite directions. He was all in grey, and was only visible
from</b>
<br><b>the waist up.&nbsp; Mom said that he was dressed in Colonial era
soldier's uniform</b>
<br><b>with a tri-cornered hat.&nbsp; Apparently he looked almost as surprised
to see my</b>
<br><b>mother.&nbsp; She reports she did't feel the least bit threatend,
more curious.</b>
<br><b>Also she had the strangest sensation of not being in her own time.&nbsp;
But she</b>
<br><b>could still see and feel her tiny kithcen surrounding her.&nbsp;
The figure then</b>
<br><b>rapidly faded to nothing.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her latest and so far final experience was when
my dog died( probably not</b>
<br><b>the most teramatic of events, you might think, but none the less
it hit our</b>
<br><b>family hard)&nbsp; We had gone for a drive to collect our thoughts.
I got out to</b>
<br><b>go for a walk to have time to myself. As I returned to our minivan,
my mom</b>
<br><b>had a look of happiness on her once sad face.&nbsp; She said that
whileI was gone,</b>
<br><b>my dogs face appeared in front of here in the van, appearing as
he once did</b>
<br><b>several years ago when he was younger and healthier.&nbsp; She got
the impression</b>
<br><b>in her mind of the words " I'm o.k.&nbsp; I'm happy".&nbsp; The
dog wasn't 'mouthing'</b>
<br><b>these words, like in a castoonish way, but my mom received this
in her mind.</b>
<br><b>She felt a lot better after that.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following three accounts are true as near
as I can figure them.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>trust my mom in these matters, and do not doubt her testimony in
the</b>
<br><b>slightest.&nbsp; I do realize your opinions of these stories are
your own, and I</b>
<br><b>can't change them.&nbsp; But please do give them an open mind.&nbsp;
We don't even know</b>
<br><b>all there is to know about our world, much less any others.&nbsp;
Thanks!</b>

<br><b>Strange Happenings</b><b></b>
<p><b>BY: Dougieheath@email.msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My first experience ever was after I bought a house in Milan Illinois.
It</b>
<br><b>started when we were doing some remodeling in my house. painting
etc. I was</b>
<br><b>full of paint &amp; left my clothes &amp; a pair of shoes in a pile
to take care of</b>
<br><b>the next morning. The next morning my shoes were gone. About 2 weeks
later</b>
<br><b>my finance's brother came to stay with us &amp; I took a pile of
blankets down</b>
<br><b>to the basement to make him &amp; my son a bed where they insisted
on sleeping.</b>
<br><b>When I got down to maybe the 3rd blanket in the pile my shoes were
wrapped</b>
<br><b>up in the blanket. Oddly enough to say you don't use winter blankets
in the</b>
<br><b>middle of June or July to where I could have mis-placed my shoes.
A few days</b>
<br><b>later I had opened a brand new bag of 20 lb dog food for a new puppy.
He was</b>
<br><b>only eating about a cup a night &amp; the next morning I went down
to feed him</b>
<br><b>again &amp; the entire bag was gone. I searched everywhere because
I knew ny 6</b>
<br><b>week old pup would not have eaten it all. Again about a week later
the bag</b>
<br><b>was found w/ the top rolled down as far down as it would go &amp;
shoved into a</b>
<br><b>cupboard hanging on the wall that we haven't used yet. My fiance's
hat had</b>
<br><b>disappeared &amp; we had thought that my son had taken it to summer
camp &amp;</b>
<br><b>possibly lost it. This time it was about a month later, I came home
from</b>
<br><b>work &amp; the first thing I ever do is come upstairs &amp; check
my answering</b>
<br><b>machine &amp; there was that damn hat laying on my pillow case.
With both of us</b>
<br><b>working &amp; my son at the sitter's there was no explanation on
how that hat</b>
<br><b>got there. Weird huh? Well, aug 14th abt 1:30am we heard the normal
creeking</b>
<br><b>on the floor in our hallway. we woke up &amp; Johnny hollared for
my son--which</b>
<br><b>was not there-he ran downstairs &amp; started our cam corder &amp;
we got about 4-5</b>
<br><b>hours of noises &amp; voices talking--we didn't see nothing move,
but the voices</b>
<br><b>were enough to make me run out of this house &amp; wanted to sell
the house. I</b>
<br><b>cried for several days &amp; did nt want to come back in here. Like
I said I</b>
<br><b>never believed until now &amp; I have also recently heard about
the entire</b>
<br><b>history of the house. The guy I bought frm inherited the house from</b>
<br><b>grandparents that both died in the house, 1 by suicide, then this
guys 1st wife was</b>
<br><b>dying of some disease &amp; he hired a nurse to come live with them
so she would not have to go</b>
<br><b>to a nursing home. He decided to have an affair with this lady &amp;
later married her</b>
<br><b>after the 1st wife died. We thought the ghosts were gone because
we stopped</b>
<br><b>hearing the creeking of the floors &amp; things stopped disappearing
until the</b>
<br><b>other night I was sitting on my living room floor helping my son
with a school</b>
<br><b>project when something flew off my wall &amp; hit me in the head.
I've tried seeing</b>
<br><b>where this object should have fallen if it had just fell &amp; it
would have landed on the</b>
<br><b>couch but I was sitting 2 feet in front of the couch-it flew as
though a force</b>
<br><b>made it.</b>

<p><b>The Church of Eden</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: msg004@home.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I guess I was in the 11th grade when this experience happened to
me.&nbsp; I have never told this story to anyone before, nor has the people
that were with me that night.&nbsp;&nbsp; A friend, two girls, and I were
out riding around one summer night looking for something to do.&nbsp; One
of us suggested that we go visit the haunted church just outside of town
in a community called Eden.&nbsp; We have always heard strange stories
from other people about the church, one of the oldest Methodist church's
West of&nbsp; the Mississippi River.&nbsp; The church is a small woodframe
building with a Victorian style structure.&nbsp; I have been to the church
before, with other friends and didn't see or hear anything, but this night
was different.</b><b></b>
<p><b>We all decided that we should be at the old church at midnight.&nbsp;
Me and my friend thought that this would scare the girls.&nbsp; So we pulled
into the dusty gravel road to the church at 5 till midnight.&nbsp; We have
been told by other people that if you shine your vehicle lights down the
road you would see a woman walking down it. We saw nothing.&nbsp; So we
pulled up to the church and waited till midnight. When the clock in the
truck showed midnight Me and my friend decided&nbsp; that we would go inside
the church.&nbsp; The girls said that would not get out, and they would
wait for us.&nbsp; My friend and I went inside the old building. We entered
the front door an with the head lights from the truck shinning through
the windows, we could see that there was only a single walkway with a pews
on each side.&nbsp; We also notice that as soon as you enter the building
there was a rope that went up to a bell.&nbsp; We decided that&nbsp; we
would ring the bell and run out acting scared, telling the girls that we
didn't do that.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Well im at the time I was about 5'8' 130 pounds and my friend was
6'6" over 300 pounds.&nbsp; I said I would pull the rope and he would then
go out the door with me behind him running scared to fool the girls.&nbsp;
I pulled on the rope, nothing happened.&nbsp; I pulled again, same results.&nbsp;
My friend made some remark about me being weak and he came over and pulled
on it.&nbsp; After he pulled a few times, with the rope coming down 4 or
five feet and almost touching the floor.&nbsp; We decided that the bell
must not be in the steeple anymore.&nbsp; So we then walked back outside
to the truck and as we got off the front steps of the church the bell rang
once.&nbsp; We both ran to the truck and the 4 of us have never been back.</b>

<p><b>The Ghost of my Junior Year</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By; Brighty18@Hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following takes place
in Tacoma, WA.&nbsp; During the 1990-1991</b>
<br><b>school year I lived with five friends in a home owned by the university
we</b>
<br><b>attended.&nbsp; The house (probably built in the 1940's) was of
moderate size:</b>
<br><b>five bedrooms, two of which were in the partially finished basement.&nbsp;&nbsp;
In</b>
<br><b>fact, the basement was divided roughly into thirds.&nbsp; One third
of which was</b>
<br><b>an unfinished storage area that contained our washer/dryer (along
with</b>
<br><b>several odd, locked closets), another third was occupied by a bathroom,
tiny</b>
<br><b>bedroom and linen closet, and the final third was one enormous bedroom
which</b>
<br><b>ran the entire length of the house. That was the room I shared with
my</b>
<br><b>roommate, Kristy.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were six people with
six different schedules and sleeping/waking</b>
<br><b>times.&nbsp; As I mentioned earlier, we were all good friends, but
soon after we</b>
<br><b>moved in,&nbsp; we&nbsp; each began to be annoyed by the excessive
amounts of noise my</b>
<br><b>other roommates were making. I had no classes until 11:00 am, but
two of my</b>
<br><b>upstairs roommates appeared to be stomping around, slamming doors
and</b>
<br><b>generally being loud VERY early in the morning.&nbsp; Kristy would
hear it, too.</b>
<br><b>Sometimes (usually in the proverbial "wee, small hours of the morning"
)&nbsp; we</b>
<br><b>would hear somebody walking in the upstairs hallway. The soft, heavy</b>
<br><b>footsteps seemed to pace back and forth for a few minutes followed
by total</b>
<br><b>silence.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried to be understanding
and said nothing. Meanwhile, the</b>
<br><b>roommates who lived upstairs were bothered by the constant stomping
and</b>
<br><b>banging the "basement dwellers"&nbsp; were making at night.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Kris and I would</b>
<br><b>also hear the occasional heavy walking, doors opening, etc. in the</b>
<br><b>downstairs portion of the house, but we thought it was part of a
regular</b>
<br><b>household routine.&nbsp; One or two evenings I would awaken around
3:30 am to a</b>
<br><b>heavy thus from the ceiling above me. It always sounded as if it
came from</b>
<br><b>the far end of my room (which was beneath Laurie's room).&nbsp;
Incidentally,</b>
<br><b>that spot often felt very cold for no apparent reason.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We grumbled about the noises, privately blaming various</b>
<br><b>roommates,&nbsp; until Spring Break.&nbsp; I was in the university's
concert choir and</b>
<br><b>we were leaving for a week-long tour the Monday after break began,
so I</b>
<br><b>spent the weekend alone.&nbsp; Oddly, I awoke each morning to the
same footsteps</b>
<br><b>stomping about on the upper floor.&nbsp;&nbsp; This both scared
and relieved me (the</b>
<br><b>latter only because I loathe anger, hostility and irritation). Later
in the</b>
<br><b>week, Laurie, an upstairs roommate, stayed in the home by herself
to do her</b>
<br><b>student teaching. She&nbsp; noticed that the downstairs&nbsp; noises
continued.&nbsp; In</b>
<br><b>fact, they seemed to grow louder.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There were other disturbing occurrences as well, most of which</b>
<br><b>seemed to center around the upstairs bedroom next to the kitchen
- Laurie's</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp;&nbsp; Strange click-clacking sounds (similar to those
made by a manual</b>
<br><b>typewriter) would emanate from the room when empty. This usually
occurred in</b>
<br><b>the late afternoons/early evening. Laurie was also paranoid about
other</b>
<br><b>people "borrowing"&nbsp; her things, so she would often lock her
door when she</b>
<br><b>left the house for the weekend. Whenever she did this, we could
hear what</b>
<br><b>sounded like a person pacing about, opening drawers, typing, rummaging</b>
<br><b>through boxes, dropping objects, etc.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Guests were even more sensitive to the occurrences that the</b>
<br><b>roommates were.&nbsp; In fact, one girl, Cherie, absolutely refused
to go near</b>
<br><b>Laurie's room at all. Laurie's family visited us frequently.&nbsp;
Laurie's</b>
<br><b>mother, Patricia, once claimed she heard a distinctly, male&nbsp;
voice coming</b>
<br><b>from that room. She assumed that it was John, Laurie's brother,
but then</b>
<br><b>looked out the window to see John talking to me in the driveway.
Nobody else</b>
<br><b>was home at the time.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Upon rare occasions, something would be moved or would move</b>
<br><b>by itself. Once we all came home to find a melted container of ice-cream
on</b>
<br><b>the kitchen floor and a spoon carefully balanced on top of it. (Each
of us</b>
<br><b>still denies doing this to this day.) Another time, when I was alone
in the</b>
<br><b>house, the stereo suddenly went on and&nbsp; my "Dark Side of the
Mood " tape</b>
<br><b>began blaring.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The presence seemed agitated, but certainly not malevolent.&nbsp; To</b>
<br><b>make ourselves feel better about it we gave him a name (Theodore)
and a</b>
<br><b>persona (suicidal Philosophy major who hung himself before he finished</b>
<br><b>typing his thesis and still wants to do so).&nbsp; However, this
was entirely a</b>
<br><b>joke - we have no idea who or what it actually was.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The house had been</b>
<br><b>purchased by the university about five years before we moved into
it and had</b>
<br><b>been occupied by various students ever since.&nbsp; It was torn
down in 1995 to</b>
<br><b>make way for a new soccer field. We never had a chance to contact
anyone</b>
<br><b>else who lived in that house to see if they had any similar experiences.</b>

<p><b>The Ghost that Saved my Life</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Blondychic24@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people tell me I have a big imagination and</b>
<br><b>that I believe in the unexplained but on the other hand I really
didn't</b>
<br><b>believe it until one night I was sleeping in my bed, in Buffalo
New York. I</b>
<br><b>heard this noise under my bed scratching. I turned on my light.
It wasn't</b>
<br><b>coming from under my bed it was coming from my basement. I figured
it was</b>
<br><b>nothing so I went back to bed. About min. later it started up again,
even</b>
<br><b>louder. I tried to sleep, but I just couldn't. I turned on my light
again,</b>
<br><b>went to my basement door, and started walking down the steps. They
are not</b>
<br><b>solid steps, they have an opening in the back. About 3 more steps
something</b>
<br><b>grabs my leg and makes me go flying down the stairs. It was hard
for me to</b>
<br><b>get up, while I was focusing I saw this white figure of a lady in
a gown. I</b>
<br><b>wanted to run but I could barley move! When I was almost to the
top of the</b>
<br><b>stars I looked behind and there were white beauty eyes all over
the place</b>
<br><b>looking at me. I ran to my mom about to tell her what happen, but
I thought</b>
<br><b>she was going to think I was crazy. I'll tell her tomorrow night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next night my mom came in my room barley
able to walk. She was out of</b>
<br><b>breath while she was telling me what happen. I told her it happen
to me too.</b>
<br><b>For the rest of the night I slept with her with the light on. I
tried not to</b>
<br><b>fall asleep. At about 3:25 I saw the lady again. I was about to
wake up my</b>
<br><b>mom but she didn't move I heard something come from the lady, she</b>
<br><b>said,"Beside~ ~ Fire. She said, Follow", she repeated. I started
to follow</b>
<br><b>her. She brought me back down stairs next to the furnis. There was
a word on</b>
<br><b>the furnis that said beside, I opened the latch on the furnis. There
was a</b>
<br><b>leak and the house was about to blow up. I ran to turn down the
heat and turn</b>
<br><b>the furnis off. I went back down stairs to say thankyou but she
was gone.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dont know if this was my gardein angel or just
my imagination, but all</b>
<br><b>I know is it saved me and my moms life.</b>

<p><b>Edgefield Manor Update!</b><b></b>
<p><b>BY: DAllen1738@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hello once again. I have written before about my home Edgefild manor.</b>
<br><b>Yesterday I had another experience. This time I was actually frightened.
I</b>
<br><b>arrived home from work at about 8:36p.m. Of course at that time
it was dark</b>
<br><b>already. I parked my car in the garage and walked inside the house.
Once I</b>
<br><b>walked inside it felt like something was different. This has never
happened</b>
<br><b>to me before. I did not think anything of until 10:39p.m. I was
sitting in a</b>
<br><b>chair next to the fireplace in my bedroom. Just reading a book and
listening</b>
<br><b>to music as usual. I then had that odd feeling again. I immediately
froze in</b>
<br><b>my chair and looked around the room. I saw nothing. I then glanced
towards</b>
<br><b>the hallway across the room and I saw "it." Normally the things
I have seen</b>
<br><b>in my home are just shadows of people or small apparitions. What
I saw</b>
<br><b>yesterday WAS NOT. It looked almost like what they call a Hag. It
was an old</b>
<br><b>woman, with sores on her. All it did was wander down the hall and
into the</b>
<br><b>other room. It did not even look up at me. This scared the Hell
out of me!</b>
<br><b>After this I went to a local hotel and spent the night. Well,...all
I have to</b>
<br><b>say is I wonder what is going on? I hope to get some answer.</b>

<p><b>The Lullaby</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: mckenna@utahconnect.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I came upon this site from another site called
castles of spirits.&nbsp; I had an experience when I was 10 years old.
I am now 27...it has been 17 years since I have reacounted this story to
anyone, other than my family.&nbsp; I was afraid that people would look
on me as though I was making the whole thing up. However, it was real and
non-illusional.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wrote out the story in my journal...I tried
to get every detail that I could.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been seventeen years since I have told
this story or have even written it out in writing.&nbsp; To this day, I
feel that if I would have told others of the story, they may have thought
I was fabricating the entire experience in my mind.&nbsp; I testify to
you, it was real.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mom was big on garage sales and wouldn't miss
a Saturday morning to get me out of my deep slumber to go along with her.&nbsp;
My neighbors were having their annual garage sale along with three other
families. My mom caught a glimpse of the 3 foot porcelain doll before I
did.&nbsp; She decided to purchase it for me, since at the time, I was
a doll collector.&nbsp; I had never owned such a beautiful masterpiece.
She stood tall, showing an aire of confidence.&nbsp; Her dark, human like
hair, hung in loose curls around her almost angelic face.&nbsp; The attire
consisted of a formal evening gown, emmaculate in detail.&nbsp; The dark
material formed&nbsp; nicely around&nbsp; the torso, and then flared out
from the waist down into a full skirt of deep green velvet trimmed with
fine lace. I was ecstatic with the new edition to my collection and spent
the remainder of the day showing her off to my friends.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to bed that night feeling contentment.&nbsp;
I set the doll, which I had named Sarah, onto the shelf alongside of my
other possessions.&nbsp; I turned off the light, and fell asleep almost
instantly.&nbsp; It seemed only a couple of minutes, when I was awakened
by a voice singing.&nbsp; It was a high soprano voice, almost like a voice
of an angel. It was singing some kind of a lullaby...a lullaby that a mother
would sing to her new born child.&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat straight in my bed,
not sure where the voice was coming from.&nbsp; I ran over to the light
switch and turned it on.&nbsp; The singing stopped immediately.&nbsp; I
remember catching a glimpse of my clock on my bedstand...it read in large,
red numbers 12:00.&nbsp; I stood, frozen in my stance. I thought for a
minute that I must have imagined the singing. So I turned off the light,
and went back to my bed.&nbsp; Within another minute, the singing began
once again. That was it.&nbsp; I flung the blankets off of me, and ran
to turn on the light switch once again.&nbsp; Before I did, I tried to
listen more closely as to where the voice was coming from. It was coming
from the doll.&nbsp; I turned on the light, and as predicted the singing
stopped. I picked up the doll and at first thought, "Wow! A singing doll...how
cool!!"&nbsp; I then turned the doll over onto it's front, and undid the
back of the dress. I checked to see if there was some kind of battery station
or switch. There was none to be found. The fear once again took over my
body.&nbsp; I took the doll into my mom's room, and shook her awake, explaining
what I had witnessed. She didn't beleive me and sent me back to my bedroom.&nbsp;
I kept the light on and I didn't hear the lullaby again that night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to school the following day, but did not
recount a single detail, in fear that they would laugh at me.&nbsp; Again
that night, it happened. I looked at my clock and it read 12:00.&nbsp;
This time, I didn't feel as frightened over it. I sat and listened.&nbsp;
I don't remember the lyrics, but it was very calm and peaceful to listen
to. After a week or so, I finally told me mom again. I told her that she
should sleep in my room with me, and then she would know what I was telling
her was true.&nbsp; She agreed, and wasn't completely prepared for what
she heard. It didn't take her long to beleive.&nbsp; The next morning,
she took the doll to the garbage can outside, telling me that the doll
was possessed with some kind of spirit.&nbsp; When I returned home from
school, the doll was back in my room on the shelf.&nbsp; I asked her if
she had changed her mind about the doll and replaced it back into my room.
By the look on her face, I took it as a definite no. She asked my brothers
if they had removed the doll, and they all swore that they hadn't. When
my dad got home, my mom described the experience to him.&nbsp; He took
the doll, and for some reason or another, he detached the head from the
body, in his own way thinking that it would help the situation.&nbsp; He
put it out in the garbage once again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While leaving the house to go to school, I glanced
at the garbage can.&nbsp; The head of the doll was peering out of the top,
exposing her face. A chill came over me, and I quickened my pace.&nbsp;
When I came home from school, I again had to pass the garbage can. I glanced
towards it once more. The eyes followed me while I was walking by her.
I thought that I was seeing things, so I repeated it. No, I was not seeing
things.&nbsp; I ran into the house in hysterics.&nbsp; My dad happened
to be home, and hardly being able to get the words out, I told him what
had just happened. My dad immediately called the Bishop and he came over
and got the doll.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To this day, I do not know what came of
the doll. I don't&nbsp; know what type of spirit possessed the doll, but
I feel that it wasn't out to hurt me in any way. From time to time, I think
about the lullaby, but can't remember the lyrics that were sung...no matter
how hard I concentrate. I never questioned my neighbors about the doll,
so whether they experienced the same thing, I will never know.&nbsp; Since
that day, I let go of collecting dolls.</b><b></b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When I was in the 8th grade we moved to a small town in Missouri.&nbsp;
After a year</b>
<br><b>of living in an apartment, we were lucky enough to find a cute,
two bedroom</b>
<br><b>bungalow for rent in a nice quiet part of town.&nbsp; We had no
idea what the house</b>
<br><b>was really like.&nbsp; From the moment I first stepped foot in it
I did not like it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;There was something very ncomfortable about it.&nbsp; The
basement, though, was the</b>
<br><b>worst.&nbsp; My mom and my sister could never smell or sense anything
unusual (that</b>
<br><b>they would admit), but I know something happened down there.&nbsp;
There was always</b>
<br><b>an overpowering stench of decaying flesh.&nbsp; That is why it was
confusing to me</b>
<br><b>that no one else could smell it...it was so strong.&nbsp; I would
refuse to go down</b>
<br><b>there to get the lawn mower or even the cat when she would sneak
down there.</b>
<br><b>Besides the unbearable smell, there was a horrible feeling that
someone was</b>
<br><b>watching me down there and that they weren't the least bit friendly.Aside
from</b>
<br><b>main room of the basement, but there were also two small rooms on
the west side</b>
<br><b>of it.&nbsp; In the northern most one there was a wooden bench,
about the size</b>
<br><b>of a bed coming out of the wall.&nbsp; This room seemed to unnerve
me the most when I</b>
<br><b>had to go down into the basement.</b>
<br><b>Aside from the basement, the rest of the house was uncomfortable
as well, though</b>
<br><b>not nearly as bad (at least in my opinion).&nbsp; It seemed that
no matter how much</b>
<br><b>we tried to brighten it up, it was always dark.&nbsp; There were
many, many windows</b>
<br><b>in the house, bright and cheery flower print wall paper, white lace
curtains...I</b>
<br><b>even went as far as painting the edging to the four windows in my
bedroom white,</b>
<br><b>but it did no good.&nbsp; The house always seemed to be dark.</b>
<br><b>Upon entering the house, the lighting was not the only thing that
would grow</b>
<br><b>dark.&nbsp; My sister and I would be coming home from school, chattering
along in</b>
<br><b>perfectly happy moods, but the second we crossed the threshold we
were at each</b>
<br><b>other's throats.&nbsp; My mother even observed this change.&nbsp;
I know there is a</b>
<br><b>certain level of sibling rivalry, but when you're getting along
perfectly fine</b>
<br><b>one minute, enter the house, and then want to beat the snot out
of the other</b>
<br><b>person, something is definately wrong.&nbsp; My mother has only
admitted to noticing</b>
<br><b>one other thing.</b>
<br><b>One early morning when she was getting to work, the bathroom door
that led to my</b>
<br><b>sister's room swung open fully.&nbsp; Mom looked up expecting my
sister to walk in to</b>
<br><b>the bathroom, but nothing was there.&nbsp; Mom went over and peered
into my sister's</b>
<br><b>room, but she was fast asleep.&nbsp; Thinking it may have been me
she checked my</b>
<br><b>room, but I was out like a light bulb.&nbsp; As a last resort she
searched for our</b>
<br><b>cat Misha, but she was curled up asleep on the living room couch.&nbsp;
The thing</b>
<br><b>that perplexed my mom was that that door was extremely hard to open.&nbsp;
Apparently</b>
<br><b>the bathroom was not origionally carpeted and when they did carpet
it, the</b>
<br><b>bottom of the door would scrape along making in completely impossible
for it to</b>
<br><b>swing open of it's own accord.</b>
<br><b>My experiences in this house have long been poo poo'd by my sister.&nbsp;
I used to</b>
<br><b>wake up in the middle of the night scared more than I have ever
been in my</b>
<br><b>entire life.&nbsp; I'd wake up and know that something was in the
room, something</b>
<br><b>that did not like me being there.&nbsp; I was so frightened that
all I could do was</b>
<br><b>sit up, pull my blankets tight under my chin and hope that whatever
was there</b>
<br><b>would go away.&nbsp; Often times I would fall asleep like this and
wake up the next</b>
<br><b>morning horribly tired and drained.&nbsp; At these times, I would
also hear footsteps</b>
<br><b>waking from one side of the attic to the other.</b>
<br><b>I have to admit, that I probably would have sided with my sister
had our cat not</b>
<br><b>noticed strange things also.&nbsp; Misha would constantly perch
on top of the tv and</b>
<br><b>stare up at the ceiling as if she was watching something.&nbsp;
Sometimes she would</b>
<br><b>be watching the ceiling and then jump down from the tv as though
something had</b>
<br><b>frightened her and disappear behind the couch or on to the screened
in porch.</b>
<br><b>Other times she would look up to the ceiling and walk through the
house as if</b>
<br><b>she was following something.&nbsp; I know that something odd was
going on that she</b>
<br><b>could sense because when we moved out two years later, her staring
contests with</b>
<br><b>the ceiling ended.</b>
<br><b>I spoke with a friend of mine right before we moved out and asked
her if she</b>
<br><b>knew any history on the house.&nbsp; She told me that she had another
friend who used</b>
<br><b>to live there. (I can vouch for this as I found the person's name
carved</b>
<br><b>underneath the edging of the front porch)&nbsp; She told me that
her friend's parents</b>
<br><b>were told upon purchasing the house that a man murdered his wife
and toddler son</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; Now whether there is any truth in that or not I don't
know.</b>
<br><b>Unfortunately I was not able to research the house's past.&nbsp;
It would certainly</b>
<br><b>explain the unbearable stench in the basement, the angry, hateful
spirit in my</b>
<br><b>bedroom and the heavy footsteps in the attic.</b>

<br><b>3 of My Personal Ghost Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ElfinW0LF@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hello my name is Sherry and 4 years ago, I had an experience with
several</b>
<br><b>ghosts. The first occurred at about 3AM, I awoke and saw a boy of
about 16</b>
<br><b>bending over me where I lay in my bed. I was understandably startled
and sat</b>
<br><b>up, when I sat up the apparition vanished though it left me with
a very</b>
<br><b>strange feeling. The second one also happened at night, it was about
3 or</b>
<br><b>4AM. I awoke because my husband was pushing me off the bed, I sat
up and saw</b>
<br><b>a small girl sitting on the corner of the bed on his side. I would
guess that</b>
<br><b>was why he was scooting over. She was about 6 or 7 yrs. old, dressed
in faded</b>
<br><b>overalls and had long black hair tied up in braids. I reached out
to her and</b>
<br><b>she threw up her hands as if to protect herself and vanished. The
third</b>
<br><b>incident happened at about 7 or 8PM. I was headed down the cement
steps into</b>
<br><b>our basement carrying a laundry basket loaded with dirty clothes
down to the</b>
<br><b>washer in the basement. The stairs always made me feel creepy for
some</b>
<br><b>reason, but tonight it seemed worse. As I hesitated at the top of
the stairs</b>
<br><b>I felt two hands on my back that pushed me hard down the stairs.
I landed at</b>
<br><b>the foot of the stairs on top of the laundry basket and luckily
was only</b>
<br><b>scraped and bruised.</b>

<br><b>A House</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: colobongj@navsta.rota.navy.mil</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;It seems that throught the whole stay in that house, everyone
had</b>
<br><b>felt that someone was looking at them, watching them, particularly
from the</b>
<br><b>upstairs rooms. from what they say, they never felt as if they were
in any</b>
<br><b>danger, just the eerie feeling that someone was always there. My
wife</b>
<br><b>apparently also heard faint whispers sometimes, to the point where
she</b>
<br><b>refused to go up there alone or in the dark. shes says that she
would sit on</b>
<br><b>the porch outside if she was alone it the house. Funny thing ws
that each of</b>
<br><b>the three sisters had experinced this but had told no-one else so
they all</b>
<br><b>thought they were imagining things. While I stayed there, I noticed
that</b>
<br><b>when the whole family was there, there would be no problems, but
the night</b>
<br><b>that it was just me and my wife, the house dog would just go nuts
and start</b>
<br><b>staring and the same particular corner and growling. she repeated
this</b>
<br><b>several times throughout the night and I never found anything there
anytime</b>
<br><b>i went over to look. I know from my short visit to the house, it
was not the</b>
<br><b>most comfortable feeling place.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;There were several other things which had happend in that
house,</b>
<br><b>probably the most unnerving was that her 10 year old sister had
mentioned</b>
<br><b>that she had talked to her (now departed) grandmother up there (second</b>
<br><b>floor) before. I was just wondering wehter this sort of thing was
common in</b>
<br><b>households or maybe a product of too many horror movies? do you
know of</b>
<br><b>anything similar happening anywhere near the location at all? they
no longer</b>
<br><b>live there having just recently sold the house, but I am still curious
about</b>
<br><b>occurences such as these.</b>

<br><b>Angel</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: MrJCordova@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When I was about eight years old I woke up one night to see an angel,
spirit,</b>
<br><b>or ghost, what ever you want to call it, sitting at the edge of
my bed. She</b>
<br><b>was beautiful. She looked about in her twentys, had long blond wavy
hair and</b>
<br><b>she was wearing an all white long flowing dress. She glowed a bright
white</b>
<br><b>light. At first I was scared and pinched myself to make sure I wasn't
just</b>
<br><b>dreaming. I scared to death asked," What do you want?" She spoke
and sounded</b>
<br><b>so sweet,loving and calm. She said," I've come to tell you not to
worry about</b>
<br><b>anything. I am all ways here with you watching over you. Everything
will turn</b>
<br><b>out okay. I am all ways here to protect you."</b>
<br><b>I all ways felt distant and out of place with every one, even my
own family.</b>
<br><b>This angel I felt so connected to. I felt like some one from were
I was from</b>
<br><b>finally made contect with me. I all most felt as if this being of
light was</b>
<br><b>me in the future coming back to help and protect me. I knew this
was my</b>
<br><b>gardian angel.</b>
<br><b>After that every once in a while I would see her in my mind and
I knew I</b>
<br><b>could relax and not worry so much. The last time I saw her was when
I was</b>
<br><b>seventeen. For a year I kept having dreams of satanic rituals. I
saw people</b>
<br><b>being killed and sacrificed. I got to the point were I didn't want
to go to</b>
<br><b>sleep. One night I had a dream that they finally saw me watching
them. They</b>
<br><b>grabbed me and tied me. They layed me on my back on a big flat rock.
The</b>
<br><b>leader of the group was a man in his mid late fortys. He had short
dark hair</b>
<br><b>and a mustache and goatee. He wore a big red robe. He held a big
knife over</b>
<br><b>me. Just as he was going to stab me a bolt of lighting struck him.
He shook</b>
<br><b>and lit up bright white. Smoke came from him and he fried to death
right</b>
<br><b>before me. Everyone that was there ran from me in fright. Then my
angel</b>
<br><b>apeard. She untied me and said run home now and I will take care
of</b>
<br><b>everything. I ran down the hills back home. I woke up in the morning
thinking</b>
<br><b>it was just a dream but my ankle hurt and there were scrapes on
my leg from</b>
<br><b>running threw the hills. I still tryed to think it was just a dream
but a</b>
<br><b>couple years later I found out there were satanic rituals going
on in the</b>
<br><b>hills by my house at the same time I had the dreams.</b>
