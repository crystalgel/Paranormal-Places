</H3><P><B>by OB ne73@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>   Hi I was very happy to read that I am not alone in this whole "Haunting"
thing. My name is David I am 23 years old and am Haunted by "ghosts". It
all started when I was about 10 years old the Dog we used to have would stare
at a corner in my living room for hours and just sit there and bark we always
thought that was weird but never thought about it. Then that was all for
years until I started messing around with Books on "ghosts" and things like
that when I was 16. Things started to happen. I had "dreams" or "Visions"
if you will, of three Victorian lady's in old dresses They were ghostly figures
floating in my house! well They would only appear until you realized they
were there and then when you blinked your eyes and looked again they were
gone. So for a While I just thought I was going crazy I didn't tell anyone
about it Until one day My sister woke up in the middle of the night crying
and ran into my niece Hayles room and said There were 3 Victorian Lady's
In Long Dresses Trying to get Hayley they kept saying "They just wanted to
hold her" And My sister prayed and then they were gone. She Didn't tell me
this at the time it happened so I still Thought I was The Only one going
through it. Until One night me my sister and my mom and brother in law were
watching a show on ghosts and they showed some "Victorian Ghosts" And My
sister said to my mom" That looks like those Ghost lady's I saw trying to
get Hayley"  At that instant I freaked out Then My brother in law said "What
ghosts I had a dream about 3 Victorian ghosts in long dresses" I never said
anything but just heard all of them comparing story's and describing what
I saw personally and never told anyone about!!  Well a few years went by
and I still never said anything but did alot of research and started trying
to communicate with them I got all of my friends into it and when I had the
house all to myself I would try to establish contact and did successfully
a number of times in the form of things moving,sounds,tempeture change,and
just plain old gut feelings. After a while I started to get very "uneasy
about the whole thing" and just wanted it all to stop,but it didn't it just
got worse. I was 20 years old and engaged to be married soon and me and my
wife to be were in the living room and started messing around and calling
more ghosts into the house taunting and teasing them until my Fiancee started
to freak out to the point I thought she was possessed. It was a long night
and to this day I am not sure if she was faking but I really think it was
for real. she said a name when I had an old paster come and pray over her
she said the name "Asmodious" over and over again kind of scary but still
dont know what that means sounds old to me but anyways she still denys the
whole thing and doesn't remember a thing about that night. After that she
changed alot she just wasent herself  we got married and then 6 months latter
separated then divorced. I blame it all on that one night. Anyways I now
live in Victorville With my Dad Stepmom and Stepsister And I feel Like the
ghosts are coming back for me I am starting to feel that gut feeling again
and starting to notice weird things. &lt;U&gt;&lt;B&gt;Can Anyone Help me
I am very serious and Would like to talk with someone about this! please
write me back!! If you know anyone that has comments or questions or any
help for me tell them to write me back PLEASE thank you very much</B>

<H3><A NAME=tommy>Tommy</A>
</H3><P><B>by David.Zumbrun@Ebay.Sun.COM </B>
<P>
<P><B>This is an experience that my wife had with her son years ago</B>
<P><B>before I met her. I'll try and tell the story to the best of my
knowledge.</B>
<P><B>She doesn't like to talk about it, and her son now 24 yrs. old doesn't
really</B>
<P><B>remember much about the experience, but it is true. He was about 3
or 4 at the</B>
<P><B>time.</B>
<P>
<P><B>They had rented a trailer and moved in nothing out of the ordinary,
until</B>
<P><B>one day her little son announced that he had met a friend. His mother
wasn't</B>
<P><B>sure what he meant because she knew that he hadn't met any kids in
the </B>
<P><B>neighborhood yet. She kind of let it go as children have great
imaginations.</B>
<P><B>He mentioned the friends name "Tommy" and asked if Tommy could eat
dinner with </B>
<P><B>them. She figured out that he had an imaginary friend and his name
was Tommy.</B>
<P><B>Not strange considering alot of kids have imaginary friends as
children.</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is where things start getting weird. At night she would put her
son to bed </B>
<P><B>and close his bedroom door. Some time would go by and she would be
watching t.v. </B>
<P><B>and all of a sudden hear the sounds of laughter and noises that sounded
like</B>
<P><B>kids playing with there toys, rolling toy cars across the floor and
just the </B>
<P><B>noises you hear as kids play with toys. She would think that her son
got out of </B>
<P><B>bed and was playing. She would go down the hall open the door only
to find her </B>
<P><B>son asleep and the room silent. The next morning her son said that
he couldn't </B>
<P><B>sleep very well because Tommy kept waking him up and wanting him to
play. She </B>
<P><B>asked where Tommy was and he took her in his room and pointed at the
closet. His </B>
<P><B>mother opened the closet and of course found nothing, except when</B>
<P><B>she moved some clothes that were hanging in the closet she saw what
appeared to</B>
<P><B>be a childs hand print on the back of the closet. The kind of hand
print when a </B>
<P><B>child traces around the outside of the hand with a crayon. Over the
next few </B>
<P><B>weeks at night things started getting worse. She would put her son
to bed and </B>
<P><B>then the sounds would start after she left the room. By now her son
would not </B>
<P><B>sleep and was getting scared of Tommy. Her son would sit in bed and
start crying </B>
<P><B>for his mother to make Tommy go away. Her mother experienced the the
noises and </B>
<P><B>grandson crying also. It kept getting worse, so bad in fact that when
she heard</B>
<P><B>her son screaming and crying and all the noises from inside the room
because he </B>
<P><B>was so frightened, she could not get up the nerve to go and even open
his door </B>
<P><B>to see what was going on. </B>
<P>
<P><B>One of the mornings after this she asked her son what Tommy looked
like. He said </B>
<P><B>a little boy but he is green. He said that Tommy was getting madder
because his </B>
<P><B>parents were outside the window and wanted Tommy to come with them,
but he </B>
<P><B>didn't want to go because his parents were mean and hurt him. She didn't
know </B>
<P><B>what to do so she went into her son's bedroom and said is this the
window that </B>
<P><B>Tommy see's his parents through and her son said yes. The mother threw
open the </B>
<P><B>window and shouted "Tommy if you can't play nice with (her son) then
you have to </B>
<P><B>leave, you have to leave anyway your parents are waiting for you. The
strangest </B>
<P><B>thing then happened, she looked at her son and said where is Tommy
now? The </B>
<P><B>child looked at his mother and said he jumped out the window and his
mom and dad </B>
<P><B>have him now. The incidents ceased and they never heard from Tommy
again.</B>

<H3><A NAME=bob>Pastor Bob</A>
</H3><P><B>by claundry@concentric.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is a true story that happened to my friends priest.I'm assuming
he </B>
<P><B>didn't lie to us when he told it, because he's a priest. </B>
<P><B>	Pastor Bob was walking home from the school where he studied to </B>
<P><B>become a priest. He felt this strange presence, like someone was </B>
<P><B>following him. He turned around and saw a man dressed in sixteenth
</B>
<P><B>century clothing walking about twenty feet behind him. He hurries to
the </B>
<P><B>dorms and told his room mates about it. They just shrugged it off and
</B>
<P><B>told him to go to bed. The same thinghappened to him the next night
he </B>
<P><B>was walking home. This time the man was closer and the young priest
ran </B>
<P><B>home frightened. His room mates thought he was just seeing things because
</B>
<P><B>of the demonic classs he had to learn about. The next night he turned
</B>
<P><B>around and the man was staring into his face. He ran home and his friends
</B>
<P><B>still didn't believe him. That night the priest had a dream that a
</B>
<P><B>skeleton was standing over his bed with a dagger held over his heart.
He </B>
<P><B>said,"In the name of Jesus Christ, I command you to be gone." The </B>
<P><B>skeleton vanished and he went back to sleep. His friends woke up and
woke </B>
<P><B>him up to, he was talking in his sleep and they told him that they
</B>
<P><B>believed him now. Because when they woke up they saw the skeleton staning
</B>
<P><B>over his bed with a dagger in his hand, held over the young priest's
</B>
<P><B>heart.</B>

<H3><A NAME=3>3 stories</A>
</H3><P><B>by 	shayne@atl.mindspring.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>In the late 1980's my husband and I were vacationing in New</B>
<P><B>Orleans.  We tend to walk alot in new citys so we can get the feel
of</B>
<P><B>life there.  This happened in the french quarter.  We were walking
on</B>
<P><B>the sidewalk and it was crowded.  About 12 feet from us we both
noticed</B>
<P><B>an interesting young man--the very sort of person you would picture</B>
<P><B>living in New Orleans.  He was tall and thin, wearing a medium grey
suit</B>
<P><B>of a light wool.  His hair was a sandy shade of red, cut in a punky</B>
<P><B>asymetrical 'do.  His skin was pale and very freckled.  He had an</B>
<P><B>angular sharp feature face.  As he came level with us, he stared at
us</B>
<P><B>and gave us a smarmy, snarky grin. We went a few feet down the
sidewalk,</B>
<P><B>and suddenly, there he was again, the same distance from us as
before,</B>
<P><B>and as he passed us he flashed us the same know it all grin.  We
turned</B>
<P><B>to follow him with our eyes in the crowd but he nor his twin were in</B>
<P><B>sight.  We wondered if he had somehow doubled back to play a trick
on us</B>
<P><B>but there wasn't time between the first time we saw him and the second.
</B>
<P><B>Would there have been twins?  Maybe, that seems most likely I guess,
but</B>
<P><B>the whole thing was a bit of a brain teaser.</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Next story;  The apartment we lived in in 1980 in Denver had been the</B>
<P><B>sceene of a violent murder--a gay woman named Rosalee Trujillos was</B>
<P><B>stabbed to death on Christmas Eve by a bi-sexual woman who was her
lover</B>
<P><B>in some sort of jealous quarrel. The case was news at the</B>
<P><B>time--1976--and the apartment which was in a building on Layfeyette
and</B>
<P><B>18th that I lived in, had always been vacant.  We were extremely
broke</B>
<P><B>and our rent was more than we could afford.  Our landlady let us have</B>
<P><B>that apartment dirt cheap.  It was much better laid out than our</B>
<P><B>previous one, and I was happy there. Everybody we knew said they
heard</B>
<P><B>stuff---singing and dishes breaking in the kitchen, and interestingly</B>
<P><B>enough, my 7 year old daughter awoke from a night mare screaming I've</B>
<P><B>got Aces and Eights, which, of course is Known as The Deadman's hand.</B>
<P><B>Once, a witch-y friend came and tried to communicate with her  , and</B>
<P><B>said she wanted to talk to me, but I didn't accept the
charges--ha-ha!</B>
<P><B>One night my husband and I were asleep and we heard a big huge
bounding</B>
<P><B>noise all the way down the narrow hall.  My hubby said it sounded
like</B>
<P><B>the noise in that great old film the Haunting--anyone who hasn't seen
it</B>
<P><B>you are missing out. It went down the long narrow hall and came back
up</B>
<P><B>again.  We both heard it, but Shane woke up completely, and I stayed</B>
<P><B>half asleep.  He was scared and ask me if I could hear it and I told
him</B>
<P><B>that it was just King Kong playing basketball in the courtyard.  Then
he</B>
<P><B>made me wake up all the way of course.  I didn't scare me, maybe
because</B>
<P><B>I gave my sleep fogged mind what I thought was a rational</B>
<P><B>explaination--noise esplained I could then go back to sleep.  But I</B>
<P><B>think maybe it wasn't meant to scare me.  By the way we thought there</B>
<P><B>might be big fireworks on Chistmas Eve, but All quiet.  The woman who</B>
<P><B>killed Rosalee escaped from Fort Collins, a Colorado mental institution
</B>
<P><B>while we lived in that apartment with the help of a female orderly.
We</B>
<P><B>were on the lookout but she didn't show, thank heavens!</B>
<P>
<P><B>Last Story:  In 1974 I wasn't quite 20.  I am from the south but am
not</B>
<P><B>close to my Flauknerian family.  We had been living in Denver for 2</B>
<P><B>years.  My husband decided to move us back south.  I was pregnate,</B>
<P><B>scared, and we were staying in a small town on the futherest
outskirts</B>
<P><B>of Atlanta--though anyone who knows Syrmna now will hardly belive how</B>
<P><B>small and isolated it was.  We were staying with a married couple who</B>
<P><B>were friends of his .  The girl was nice, but we had little in common.
</B>
<P><B>the man was ok too. He just thought women should stay at home.  He
and</B>
<P><B>my husband would go out after work and I wouldn't see him again for</B>
<P><B>hours--I had no transportation.  I was bored and lonely and very
nervous</B>
<P><B>and insecure.  We were arguing alot.  The house was small and old</B>
<P><B>fashioned. There was a hot little room with one window that we slept</B>
<P><B>in.  I would lie in there and read and feel sorry for myself when he
was</B>
<P><B>out on the town late.  I began to hear a constant hammering sound
from</B>
<P><B>the wall beside the bed--more like a mattress on the floor--Everyone</B>
<P><B>could hear it.  My husband and his big buddy looked in the
crawl-space</B>
<P><B>and in the attic.  They found nothing that seemed to be causing it.
 I</B>
<P><B>became use to it. it happened so much and went on forever when it</B>
<P><B>started.  I called it the Builder.  I miscarried twins on </B>
<P><B>April Fool's day and soon after we found our own apartment.  the
Builder</B>
<P><B>moved with us and tapped on the wall behind the couch for a couple
of</B>
<P><B>weeks, and then went away forever.    Even at that young age I
thought</B>
<P><B>the banging to be a manifestation of my own fear and feeling of being</B>
<P><B>trapped.  I guess I haunted myself!</B>

<H3><A NAME=cousins>My Cousin's House</A>
</H3><P><B>by name withehld by request</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was having problems at home so, my distant cousin asked me if I'd
like </B>
<P><B>to stay with them for a while until things cooled off.  I asked my
mother </B>
<P><B>and she thought it would be a good idea.  I would be moving from my
</B>
<P><B>reservation (Wisconsin) to another which was located about an hour
away. </B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>My cousin was renting a house from an old friend of hers.  The house
was </B>
<P><B>fairly new, it had a nice yard, and was somewhat secluded and private
</B>
<P><B>from our neighbors.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I remember the kids at school asking me where I was from and where
I </B>
<P><B>lived.  After I would tell them where I was living they would always
say </B>
<P><B>something like, "Oh yeh, I heard about THAT place."</B>
<P><B>I didn't understand what they were talking about so, I ignored the
</B>
<P><B>stories and rumors.</B>
<P>
<P><B>A couple of weeks after arriving, my cousin was planning a trip to
go and </B>
<P><B>visit her boyfriend who lived a few hours away.  I had to much school
</B>
<P><B>work so, I told her I'd stay behind and keep an eye on the house. 
She </B>
<P><B>didn't see a problem so she packed up her and her two daughters and
left </B>
<P><B>for the weekend.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I got off the bus and started to walk up the driveway.  I remember
</B>
<P><B>looking up at the house and seeing the living room curtains moving
</B>
<P><B>around.  As if the windows were open and a harsh breeze was blowing
</B>
<P><B>through the house.  I stopped dead in my tracks, I felt an uneasy feeling
</B>
<P><B>come over me.  For some odd reason, I didn't want to go in the house.
 </B>
<P><B>But, I didn't believe in "stuff" like that...</B>
<P>
<P><B>I walked into the house and imediately checked to see what the heat
was </B>
<P><B>on-it wasn't.  The dial pointed to "OFF".  So, I went over by the window
</B>
<P><B>to see if the windows were cracked open, but I had remebered to shut
and </B>
<P><B>lock them that morning, before going to school.  I double checked anyway,
</B>
<P><B>and they were shut and locked.  </B>
<P><B>I looked around the house wondering what in the world would make the
</B>
<P><B>curtains move like that.  I even thought about searching the house
for a </B>
<P><B>cat-there were no cats that I knew of around the neighborhood.  So,
I was </B>
<P><B>stumped and gave up thinking, "Oh well."</B>
<P>
<P><B>I cooked dinner and sat at the table with all my attention fixed on
the </B>
<P><B>T.V.  Suddenly, I heard a horn "honking" outside of the house.  I got
up </B>
<P><B>and looked out kitchen window but, there wasn't a car out in the </B>
<P><B>driveway.  Then, I saw headlights turning off and on.  I imeadiately
knew </B>
<P><B>where the headlights and "honking" were coming from...my cousin's old
</B>
<P><B>station wagon which was parked on the side of the house.  I thought
</B>
<P><B>someone was sitting in the car but, when I ran over to the door and
</B>
<P><B>looked out the window to see if anyone was in the car-nobody.  Seconds
</B>
<P><B>later, the "honking" and flashing lights stopped.  Soon, it was </B>
<P><B>completely calm and quiet outside.  </B>
<P><B>I was so afraid, I called a friend of mine to come over and visit for
a </B>
<P><B>while.  She said she'd be right over.  </B>
<P><B>About 20 minutes later she pulled up.  I let her in and told her what
had </B>
<P><B>happened.  She just looked at me and stared.  With the blank look on
her </B>
<P><B>face, I knew she wasn't telling me something. I questioned her and
she </B>
<P><B>simply told me that about a year ago a man and his wife died in the
</B>
<P><B>house.  The man died in his sleep from cancer, and the woman died of
</B>
<P><B>lonliness.  I was floored.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>The weekend came and went with things starting to happen right and
</B>
<P><B>left. Unexplainable things, like objects being moved from one room
to </B>
<P><B>another.  The bedroom I was staying in was always extremely cold-due
to </B>
<P><B>the fact that it was summertime and seeing your breath in my bedroom
</B>
<P><B>isn't very common.  As soon as you'd walk through the doorway, it would
</B>
<P><B>be normal summer, humid temperatures. </B>
<P><B>Now to rule out the fact that I wasn't going crazy, I didn't tell my
</B>
<P><B>cousin our her older daughter what had happened to me during the weekend.
</B>
<P><B>I kept a smile saying everything was quiet and I just talked with friends
</B>
<P><B>on the phone and watched T.V. until two in the morning.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I wasn't going crazy, things kept on happening.  My cousin was getting
</B>
<P><B>frustrated because she kept "misplacing" her thesis paper.  A box </B>
<P><B>containing about 260 pages of hard work, along with her Webster's </B>
<P><B>dictionary and, her 5 other text books.  I helped her carry it to the
car </B>
<P><B>before, and it weighed about 15-25 lbs.  I knew she wasn't misplacing
it, </B>
<P><B>how can someone misplace something that big?  A few times she found
it </B>
<P><B>outside her daughter's bedroom window-dumped all over.  (her daughter
was </B>
<P><B>grounded a few times, constitantly saying she wouldn't do something
like </B>
<P><B>that-I believed her)  We even found it under my bed, I know I didn't
</B>
<P><B>shove it under there and my cousin's older daughter wasn't even home
</B>
<P><B>during the week that happened.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>My cousin finally sat us down and talked to us about the "weird" stuff
</B>
<P><B>that was going on in the house.  I confessed to the scary events that
</B>
<P><B>happened during the weekend they'd left to vistit her boyfriend and
the </B>
<P><B>unusual temperature in my bedroom.  </B>
<P><B>My cousin reported to me the stuff her younger daughter (2 yrs.) was
</B>
<P><B>doing.  She'd laugh at "invisible images" in the closets.  Or she'd
wake </B>
<P><B>up screaming staring at the air in front of her and telling "it" to
leave </B>
<P><B>her feet alone.  She was even playing hide and seek and being "tickled"
</B>
<P><B>when she was "found".  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Many other stories were exchanged in that conversation.  Completely
</B>
<P><B>perplexing.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>It wasn't more than 2 days later we had a medicine man travel from
out of </B>
<P><B>state to come over to the house and "chase" out the bad spirits.  The
</B>
<P><B>medicine man didn't know the history of the house, he didn't ask </B>
<P><B>questions and was never briefed about who lived there prior to us.
</B>
<P>
<P><B>One of the spirits was hiding in my closet.  (maybe that's why my room
</B>
<P><B>was so cold...)  The other spirit was hiding behind the couch in the
</B>
<P><B>living room.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Before the medicine man left he spoke in broken english and said, "You
</B>
<P><B>know, he was a good man-loved to play with your daughter.  The woman
on </B>
<P><B>the other hand, she was mean and didn't like your family...that's all
I </B>
<P><B>know."</B>

<H3><A NAME=boy>The Boy in the Basement</A>
</H3><P><B>by AirJordanM@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi, my name is Brad.  I live in Minnesota.  I am 18 years old.  This
story is from when I was about 5 or 6 years old.  My parents had just divorced
and I was caught going back and forth every-other wekend from my dads and
my moms.  My father lived in a town called Farmington.  All of my memories
of this ghost are very clear considering I was 5 or 6.  When I would go over
to his house on the weekend, in the basement, where I would sometimes play,
I could see a small boy, about my age at the time.  He would be jumping across
the boxes, like he was playing in his own way.  I would sit down there and
talk to him like nothing was wrong.  My dad would come down and say "who
are you talking to?".  I would say "the litttle boy over there, can't you
see him.?"  I distinctly remember pointing at him jumping across the boxes.
 "No, I can't" he would say.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>There are 2 reasons why I am absolutly posotive that this wasn't just
a 6 year olds imagination.  The first starts off with my father telling me
to pick up my toys because it was time to go back to my mom's house.  Now,
my dad is a perfectionist to this day so I am absolutly positive that my
toys were picked up when we left.  When he came home my toys were scattered
over the house.  To this day I can still remember telling the little that
he could play with my toys.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The second reason is perhaps the most convincing.  My dad wrote a paper
on this story also for college.  I got to read it.  In the paper I found
out that my dad was talking to a neighbor about what I was seeing and talking
to nothing and stuff like that.  And told him that I was seeing it in the
basement.  My dad told me almost fainted when the neighbor told him that
a while back there was a fire in the basement and a little boy, about my
age, had died in it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have since become very intersted in ghosts and ghost stories.  I
went to the city hall in Farmington and got a copy of the fire report.  I
would scan it and send it with this letter but I have no scanner.  If you
would like me to tell you more about this story drop me a line.  I would
be happy to go into more detail for you</B>

<H3><A NAME=campus>SUNY campus</A>
</H3><P><B>by 	alperreault@juno.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Until about 1 week ago, I worked in the oldest, I think, kitchen on
a</B>
<P><B>SUNY campus in Central NYS.  I had heard that this particular building
was</B>
<P><B>haunted, but didn't believe it 'til I saw the apparitions myself.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I might add here that I worked in this kitchen for about 10 years.
 For</B>
<P><B>the first couple of years I never saw the ghosts, but saw evidence
that</B>
<P><B>something odd was happening.  At first, I would see footprints on the</B>
<P><B>grill in the A.M. when I was preparing to cook breakfast -- I was one
of</B>
<P><B>the first people to arrive and it was my job to clen and season the
grill</B>
<P><B>before we started -- at least 3-4 times a week I would end up trying
to</B>
<P><B>clean the foot tracks off the grill.  It happened so often that we
began</B>
<P><B>to expect to see them -- when we didn't, we thought that not seeing
them</B>
<P><B>was odd.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Our kitchen was on the ground floor of the original cafetieria --</B>
<P><B>actually the second floor with the dock area and a snack bar on a
lower</B>
<P><B>level.  One day I was making a pot of coffee when i had the strange</B>
<P><B>feeling someone was watching me.  I turned to see a man standing at
the</B>
<P><B>head of the stairs leading to the lower level.  He stood there long</B>
<P><B>enough to let my eyes focus on him.  He turned to his right and
walked</B>
<P><B>down a very short hall toa break room which was right off the kitchen.
</B>
<P><B>Not recognizing him, I followed him into the breask room to see what
he</B>
<P><B>wanted -- he was not there!! This break room was about 12'x15' and</B>
<P><B>furnished with a desk and two sets of cabinets and there was nowhere
he</B>
<P><B>could hide!!!!!  Now, there are 2 door to this room, so I proceeded
to</B>
<P><B>the other door thinking he had exited that way and gon into a
smaller,</B>
<P><B>faculty dining room.  That door was locked and can be opened from
either</B>
<P><B>side without being unlocked.  Thinking that he may have gone into the</B>
<P><B>rest romm which is right off the small hallway, I went in THERE to
find</B>
<P><B>him, but he wasn't THERE, either.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>On other occasions, a ghost has  moved utensils around the kitchen,</B>
<P><B>turned equipment on and off,  TALKED loud enough so that my
co-workers</B>
<P><B>and I could hear him, jimgled keys, etc. and made all sorts of other</B>
<P><B>noises.   I'm sure there are more than one ghost in the place -- I
have</B>
<P><B>seen at least three.  I recognized one of them as the deceased former</B>
<P><B>executive director of auxiliary services.</B>
<P>
<P><B>These hauntings occurred so often that we just started taking them
for</B>
<P><B>granted and didn't even worry about them.  When they happened we
didn't</B>
<P><B>realizw what was going on 'til they were all over.  For a while, I
was</B>
<P><B>the only person in the kitchen to see them.  Recently 2 other
co-workers</B>
<P><B>began to see them also.</B>
<P>
<P><B>While these hauntings don't seem to be very dramatic or
sensationalistic,</B>
<P><B>they did make it kind of eery to be working alone in that kitchen.</B>

<H3><A NAME=house>Our House</A>
</H3><P><B>by MM22877@SWT.EDU</B>
<P>
<P><B>I'm not sure if I really want to believe that there are other beings
</B>
<P><B>sharing our earth with us but I guess I have to because of some </B>
<P><B>unexlained occurences that has happened to my family. We believe that
</B>
<P><B>the house that everyone grew up in(where I still live) is haunted.
The </B>
<P><B>reason for this is that everyone in my family has had something happen
</B>
<P><B>to them. </B>
<P><B>	I think I'll start with the experience my mom had. Some time ago I
</B>
<P><B>guess about ten years ago we had my brother and his wife living there
</B>
<P><B>with us. My mom was you usual early bird, up at five starting in on
</B>
<P><B>her housework after getting ready herself. Well, one morning she had
</B>
<P><B>gotten up at her regular time and everyone else was still asleep. She
</B>
<P><B>had gotten ready to do the dishes from the night before when she heard
</B>
<P><B>someone walk across the kitchen floor and into the living room. When
</B>
<P><B>she turned she caught a glimpse of a white night gown. Thinking </B>
<P><B>nothing of it she continued to do the dishes. She thought that it was
</B>
<P><B>my sister-in-law, at the time, that had gotten up to go to the </B>
<P><B>bathroom or something. She was expecting to see her walk back across
</B>
<P><B>but after 20 minutes of doing her kitchen things she realized that
my </B>
<P><B>sister-in-law hadn't returned. She then went to look for her in the
</B>
<P><B>living room and the bath room but didn't see her. About two hours </B>
<P><B>later   my sister-in-law got up and my mom asked if she had gotten
up </B>
<P><B>and she replied "No." This was only one encounter with someone in a
</B>
<P><B>white night gown. </B>
<P><B>	Another experience that my mother had was a few years later. We had
</B>
<P><B>some stairs that went up to the attic. My mom was sitting on one of
</B>
<P><B>the steps while talking on the phone. The rest of us were in the </B>
<P><B>kitchen talking. I was there with my two brothers and my sister. We
</B>
<P><B>heard my mom yell "Stop pushing me!" and told whoever she was talking
</B>
<P><B>to on the phone that my brother, who was in the kitchen, that my </B>
<P><B>brother was trying to come down and was pushing her. We heard her and
</B>
<P><B>told her that it wasn't my brother because he was with us. She stopped
</B>
<P><B>talking and hung up the phone without a good-bye. Her face had lost
</B>
<P><B>all its color and she was speechless. As she started getting up she
</B>
<P><B>felt another push and when she got up and down the stairs she turned
</B>
<P><B>and saw nothing. She had terrible time after that and so has everybody
</B>
<P><B>else, sitting on those stairs again. </B>
<P><B>	We have all had something strange happen to us like hearing footsteps
</B>
<P><B>in the attic or hearing someone calling from outside or seeing a lady
</B>
<P><B>in a white night gown. I still live there and get spooked only when
</B>
<P><B>I'm by myself or real late at night. Nothing really bad has ever </B>
<P><B>happened, or at least I don't think or nobody has told me. Any way
</B>
<P><B>whatever is there has not really bothered me or I it. So far we've
</B>
<P><B>been living in peace together. Well that's all the time I have for
now </B>
<P><B>hope to write some more later.</B>

<H3><A NAME=husband>My husband's and My Experiences</A>
</H3><P><B>by Cliamhksf@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My husband and I have some experiences that we can't quite explain
but feel that no matter where we move each place has a different kind of
spirit with us.  We are not sure if one of us is welcoming these experiences
or if it is a coincidence that they happen to show themselves whenever we
are around.  I have always been open and have read about ghosts, poltergeists,
my psychic abilities etc. for years.  My husband seems to be naturaly very
psychic in many ways.  Anyway on with my experiences:  In our first apartment
together 5 years ago we started to experience some activity. It was quite
playful and never harmed either of us nor did I ever really feel scared but
this spirit or poltergeist would turn our fan on in the middle of the night
while we were sleeping and face the fan on us, we could not hang any kind
of picture over our bed or it would come crashing down in the middle of the
night, three times in the 3 years we were there there was this horrible stench
that came from where all the activity took place.....our bedroom.  It was
unexplainable we even pulled up the carpet but found virtually nothing. 
As quick as the smell was there it would be gone!  Poof!!   Our cat of course
sees whatever it is and stares at it and chases it. There was another time
a glass of wine was teetering in a circle on the table but managed to not
fall over.  I called our landlord and asked if they knew about any murders
or deaths in our unit or building and they did not know of any.  The wall
that the picture would crash off of was a wall to the street so we know it
wasn't our neighbor.  </B>
<P><B>In the second apartment one week after we moved in we had all the lights
off and were watching a video on tv.  I was on the couch and my husband was
sitting beside me.  All of the sudden my husband says look at the cat, what
is he doing? My cat had all of his hair sticking up on end and was sniffing
like crazy walking sideways toward me really slowly obviously very disturbed
by what he is seeing.  I kept trying to snap him out of it by calling to
him and snapping my fingers etc.  He never blinked but kept coming towards
me, the next thing I knew the hair on the back of my neck was sticking up,
I got this overwhelmingly scary feeling and began to cry not knowing why
and my body went sort of limp and tingly, I got up really fast and started
walking around and my husband could see something was happenning to me and
was freaking out asking me what was going on.  Then the feeling slowly went
away and the cat seemed normal again.  I really believe something tried to
pass through me or something.  Well I was always frightened of it happening
again and since it happened the cat would not go anywhere on or near the
couch.  Well almost exactly a year later my husband was home by himself and
he saw the cat do the same thing toward him and he remembered when the cat
did that before and got up and started walking around and he too felt tingly
and very scared.  When I got home that night he was white as a ghost and
I asked him what happened and he said I think the same thing tried to pass
through me too.  We tried not to think about too much while we lived there
but you constantly are wondering if it's ever gonna happen again.  Onto our
third place together a house, a couple of days after we moved in while we
were sleeping we had this fan on that was sitting in the middle of an armoire
and for no reason whatsoever it completely came flying off of the armoire
onto the hardwood floor and scared the crap out of us.  Then a few days
later.....we were sitting in the living room watching tv and my cat's hair
stood up on end again and he was sniffing looking straight at the stairs
and trying to touch with one of his paws very gingerly at the bottom stair
but was looking up at about the 3rd stair.  Again we couldn't snap him out
of it and he stayed their staring for about an hour and a half and my husband
and I just stayed where we were and didn't dare go near the stairs.  Since
then, nothing has really happened. By the way the cat will now jump on the
couch periodically and even lay there.  Before if you tried he would quickly
run away.  We can't explain it, but I have been doing a lot of research lately
and have been trying to deal with the option of maybe having the house blessed
or confronting the spirit or whatever it may be.  Im afraid of making it
angry.  We don't even talk about this spirit in the house outloud any longer
for fear that this thing can hear us.  We feel like by us just talking about
it or thinking about it one of us is welcoming it into our house.  We are
open to this world however I am also very scared.  I am about to have a baby
in a few months and do not want to run into something in the middle of the
night and be caught off guard.  I think its fascinating yet kinda scary too.
 We keep wondering if it could be my father trying to contact me or one of
my husbands passed on relatives.   Anyway, I was hoping from some of the
details you may be able to tell if it is the same spirit following us?  Or,
if we are sensitive to what may already be there wherever we move.  At this
point Im not sure what to do.  Do you have any guidance or clues as to what
these may add up to be?  Thanks for your help!  </B>

<H3><A NAME=baby>Baby, Come Upstairs</A>
</H3><P><B>by 	mikepace@mail2.nai.net</B>
<P>
<P><B> This is a true story, and the only experience i have had with the</B>
<P><B>supernatural which other people can verify; When I was two years old</B>
<P><B>i was at my cousin's house located in New Milford Ct., a nice 18th
cent.</B>
<P><B>relic of a house. It was the holidays and my whole family was gathered
</B>
<P><B>in the living room, I was playing on the floor by myself. I vividly
</B>
<P><B>remember crawling to the two folding doors which opened to the hallway
/</B>
<P><B>staircase. I passed through the doors into the darkness and that is
where</B>
<P><B>my memory draws a blank. What I do remember is running back into the
</B>
<P><B>living room and jumping behind my aunt, terrified, and crying. It took
</B>
<P><B>a couple of minutes for me to come to my senses. When my family finally
</B>
<P><B>got me to talk, the only thing I could say was "goken yellow people";</B>
<P><B>this translates into "broken white people" (in my primitive stages
of</B>
<P><B>language, goken=broken and I often confused white for yellow). Upon
</B>
<P><B>furhtur interogation (ie, "What happened?",What did they say to
you?")</B>
<P><B>My reply was "Baby come upstairs". Needless to say my mother and I
got</B>
<P><B>the hell out of there.I was too young to lie, and too young to know
what</B>
<P><B>a ghost was, this experience wasnt a figment of my imagination.
Furthur,</B>
<P><B>the house has also found it's items rearranged or misplaced, and dogs</B>
<P><B>have been known to bark at the same corner of a downstairs room on
</B>
<P><B>several occasions. Unfortunately I am the only person to have seen
these</B>
<P><B>ghosts, and was too traumatized by the event to clearly recollect
wether</B>
<P><B>they were white or actually yellow.</B>

<H3><A NAME=the>The Shadowman</A>
</H3><P><B>by 	doghead@mlode.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>When i was 4-5 years old, i had just learned how to talk. We lived
in a </B>
<P><B>Very small house in Sacremento,CA, I started telling my mom and dad
that </B>
<P><B>there was a "Shadow Man" in my doorway every night, according to my
</B>
<P><B>description, he was tall, wore a trench coat, and a short top-hat.
 At </B>
<P><B>first my parents dismised it a gibberish, but every morning for
months</B>
<P><B>i would tell my parents about the "Shadow Man" they were starting to
</B>
<P><B>discuss it more seriously when my father saw the shadow man too.</B>
<P>
<P><B>     He had just gotten home from a softball game and he was on his
way to </B>
<P><B>the dentist, when the phone rang.  It was my uncle, then while they
were </B>
<P><B>talking, my dad saw a shadow of what looked like a man, he then realized
</B>
<P><B>it was the description of my "Shadow Man" He picked up his bat and
charged </B>
<P><B>the shadow, in an instant it disappeared, reappearing as it ran up
to the </B>
<P><B>attic. My dad followed it, he was scared out of his wits but he followed
</B>
<P><B>it. He said it was like walking through a dark horror movie scene.
</B>
<P><B>However, there was no trace of the man.</B>
<P>
<P><B>  That was all we ever saw of the "Shadow Man" After that, we moved
to the </B>
<P><B>sierra navada's, I then found your webpage and i decited to write
this.</B>
<P>
<P><B>   I hope you believe this, because it is all true, my parents often
tell </B>
<P><B>me this story and although i don't know what it means, i know it is
true. </B>

<P>
<P><B>My husband and I lived off campus in a fairly new subdivision , our
</B>
<P><B>house was only about 10 years old at the time . The occurence happened
to </B>
<P><B>both of us , in differing fashions . I had fallen asleep but Dan was
</B>
<P><B>still up reading in bed when he noticed that our bedroom door , which
we </B>
<P><B>kept ajar , pushed open as if someone had just entered slowly . The
</B>
<P><B>clothes on the rack at the foot of the bed swayed as if just being
</B>
<P><B>brushed past as well . </B>
<P><B>     At precisely the same time he is observing this , I began whimpering
</B>
<P><B>and mumbling in my sleep , so he naturally dismissed the oddity he
was </B>
<P><B>winessing to check on me . I awakened from a disturbing ,though brief
</B>
<P><B>"dream" and proceeded to tell him about it . I "dreamed" that we were
in </B>
<P><B>bed , him reading and myself just watching the room , and I saw a </B>
<P><B>beautiful cherub-faced boy enter the room and stand by the clothes
rack </B>
<P><B>near our bed . He seemed about 5 yrs. old , had on a striped shirt
, had </B>
<P><B>the most precious , rosy , chubby cheeks , beautiful blue eyes and
golden </B>
<P><B>curly hair , that tussled on his forehead . But as I admired this </B>
<P><B>beautiful child , I noticed that under his curly bangs were two grey
</B>
<P><B>horns protruding near his hairline (I just got the darned goose-bumps
I </B>
<P><B>always get when relating that part of the story !)He "smiled" at me
at </B>
<P><B>that point - and his angelic features took on almost a maniacal quality
, </B>
<P><B>which seems like an excessive description but is quite accurate ! At
this </B>
<P><B>point I was already frightened in the "dream" and began the whimpering
</B>
<P><B>which made my husband wake me . Of course he told me what he had just
</B>
<P><B>witnessed  at the same moment that my "dream" was taking place , and
</B>
<P><B>needless to say , though we didn't run screaming in fear at the time
, we </B>
<P><B>did leave all the lights on that night!</B>
<P><B>     It wasn't until we moved out a year later that anything else occured
</B>
<P><B>in relation to that single event . As we were clearing out the basement
, </B>
<P><B>Dan came across a box wedged under the stairs - it was packed with
little </B>
<P><B>boy's clothes ....</B>
<P><B>     We do not know any history of the house , so are still curious
to </B>
<P><B>this day . It was a repossessed home , so we can only speculate on
the </B>
<P><B>circumstances that the previous owners left under . Nor do we have
any </B>
<P><B>children of our own who that "spirit" might be attached to somehow
.  My </B>
<P><B>questions are: how could one so young seem so malicious ? Why the horns
</B>
<P><B>hidden in the cherubic features ? Any ideas ? -

<H3><A NAME=show>Show me the Upstairs</A>
</H3><P><B>by clendaniel@earthlink.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>I was house sitting for a family of friends and i allowed myself to
fall </B>
<P><B>asleep on the couch in the living room after studying and watching
tv. </B>
<P><B>Around 4 o'clock I was asked by this stranger to show him the upstairs.
</B>
<P><B>I thought that I must be dreaming and tried to go back to sleep and
told </B>
<P><B>the guy that there was nothing upstairs but the usual--a couple of
</B>
<P><B>bedrooms and a bathroom. He would not let me go back to sleep and kept
</B>
<P><B>insisting that I show him the upstairs. I began to get impatient when
he </B>
<P><B>changed his request and said that he had something he wanted to show
me </B>
<P><B>upstairs. Although light was just beginning to show in the morning
sky </B>
<P><B>outside, when I looked up the stairs I could see absolutely nothing.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I told this apparition that I was very tired and that I was going to
go </B>
<P><B>back to the sofa and lie down and go back to sleep. He followed me
from </B>
<P><B>the foyer at the bottom of the stairs into the living room and when
I </B>
<P><B>laid back down and tried to hide my face he touched me on the foot.
At </B>
<P><B>that point I was fully awake and began to try and scream. He moved
</B>
<P><B>toward one of the windows as though he was backing away from me and
</B>
<P><B>slowly faded away.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Although he had no visible features--he was just a mass of gasses it
</B>
<P><B>seemed ("fog" or cold air), I knew that he was the young man from the
</B>
<P><B>farm house behind the property where I was. He wanted to show me </B>
<P><B>something about the way he died and I did not want to know. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Later that day I realized that all the times I had spent in the house
</B>
<P><B>staying with my friends and housesitting for them on other occasions,
it </B>
<P><B>had been almost a regular behavior for me to wake up at the about the
</B>
<P><B>same time every morning--between 3:45-5:00 a.m. I usually felt some
</B>
<P><B>noise had woken me and I was often upset. The night before this incident
</B>
<P><B>when I had slept upstairs, I woke up terrified and sweating from head
to </B>
<P><B>toe. I do not consider myself nor does my family consider me to be
a </B>
<P><B>person who has night terrors. And since I have not stayed in that house
</B>
<P><B>since that incident I have never again woken up sweating like that.</B>
<P>
<P><B>On other occasions I have felt and heard various presences, but this
was </B>
<P><B>the only time I have ever seen a ghost. I have often thought about
this </B>
<P><B>experience: how it started out alright and that I wasn't afraid of
the </B>
<P><B>young man; how I became frightened from his insistance that I go with
</B>
<P><B>him upstairs. I hope that if I do indeed have an experience in which
I </B>
<P><B>actually see another apparition that I will be fair and do it and myself
</B>
<P><B>the justice of being open minded and unafraid.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Thank you for the opportunity to share my story. Each time I do I gather
</B>
<P><B>a little more understanding of the incident and what happened.</B>

<H3>     <A NAME=frisco>The Frisco Townhouse</A>
</H3><P><B>by Jayney@mail.rogersu.edu</B>
<P>
<P><B>My favorite cousin was raised in a typical SanFrancisco townhouse -</B>
<P><B>typical in every way except the haunting I suppose ! The ghostly </B>
<P><B>occurences happened to just about every member of the family that stayed
</B>
<P><B>there , so I'll give you some individual accounts .</B>
<P><B>My Uncles experience :</B>
<P><B>    It began with the "usual" sighting - a shadow seen on several </B>
<P><B>occasions standing at the foot of the bed . Yet it intensified with
time. </B>
<P><B>Eventually , the shadow manifested into a stronger image (how? why?-
did </B>
<P><B>it gain power ,or did they become more open to that other plane of
</B>
<P><B>existence ?...) My uncle was finally awakened not just from the usual
</B>
<P><B>discomfort that accompanied the presence ,but because he was being
shaken </B>
<P><B>violently by his legs from what appeared to be a heavy-set sailor who
</B>
<P><B>seemed not simply angry , but malevolent ! </B>
<P><B>    Well , as if that incident hadn't already scared the heck out of
</B>
<P><B>Uncle Romy , the presence began manifesting in other intimidating ways
. </B>
<P><B>He would come home from work (earlier than every one else) only to
often </B>
<P><B>see the same man glaring at him from the living room window . He must
</B>
<P><B>have been successful at ignoring the presence initially for it resorted
</B>
<P><B>to another tactic which finally worked .Uncle Romy let himself in from
</B>
<P><B>work this last afternoon , and headed back to shower and relax from
his </B>
<P><B>day . Once in the bathroom with the door closed behind him , a series
of </B>
<P><B>horrendous pounding began on the walls of the hallway , accompanied
by </B>
<P><B>the sound of angry stomping down the hall and towards the bathroom
. His </B>
<P><B>first instinct was to get out quick , only to find that the door would
</B>
<P><B>not open , and seemed to be held tightly shut from outside ! After
about </B>
<P><B>15 minutes of the poundings and stompings , the house went quiet and
Romy </B>
<P><B>took the opportunity to flee from the house - he sat in the driveway
in </B>
<P><B>his car for two hours until the rest of his family came home , and
made </B>
<P><B>sure never to be there alone again !</B>
<P>
<P><B>MY COUSINS STORY:</B>
<P><B>     Rommel was only 5 when the family lived there , and this was the
</B>
<P><B>only time in his life that he had the "problems" that were so frequent
in </B>
<P><B>this house . He became a chronic sleep walker/talker - so much so that
</B>
<P><B>you couldn't tell he was sleeping . Often times he was found in the
</B>
<P><B>living room talking to someone , or just whimpering with the front
door </B>
<P><B>open . He never remembered what he was dreaming , and of course was
</B>
<P><B>always disconcerted when awakened and finding himself not in his own
</B>
<P><B>room. The scariest occurence of this type took place in the middle
of the </B>
<P><B>afternoon . My aunt , my cousin Rachelle and myself were in the kitchen
</B>
<P><B>making sandwiches - Rommel was out playing in the living room . We
were </B>
<P><B>panicked by the sudden sound of his boyish voice hitting the high pitch
</B>
<P><B>that hysteria causes as he screamed "HE'S IN HERE ..HE'S IN HERE ..THE
</B>
<P><B>BAD MAN IS IN HERE...!!!!!". My aunt dashed in to grab her son , despite
</B>
<P><B>the fact that obviously someone had broken in , only to find Rommel
</B>
<P><B>sitting straight up on the sofa in the otherwise empty , with front
door </B>
<P><B>locked ,room ! She tried to shake him out of his hysterics , for he
</B>
<P><B>seemed wide awake , but it literally took a slap to the face to snap
him </B>
<P><B>out of it .(No , she is not an abusive parent !). Of course he was
calm </B>
<P><B>upon waking , with no recollection of the "dream" , or remembrance
of the </B>
<P><B>"hysterics".</B>
<P>
<P><B>THE FAMILY'S STORY;</B>
<P><B>     My cousins had a small dog during the time they lived in the </B>
<P><B>townhouse , who of course was ALWAYS  "barking at nothing" - the walls
, </B>
<P><B>the hallway , the bedroom door ... (No wonder considering what manifested
</B>
<P><B>to the people of the house !). It died under highly unusual circumstances
</B>
<P><B>in that townhouse . The family had all gone out for the evening , and
</B>
<P><B>upon returning home were surprised to not hear their pet yipping at
their </B>
<P><B>arrival . The doors and windows were all locked , nothing was out of
</B>
<P><B>place  - except that the dog was gone ! They searched all the rooms
, </B>
<P><B>under beds , anywhere he might be within the house . Finally by uncle
</B>
<P><B>chose to open the door to the basement to check it out too , only to
find </B>
<P><B>that "the dog" had somehow managed to open the basement door , put
it's </B>
<P><B>leash on it's collar , and wrap the leash around the banister in order
to </B>
<P><B>hang itself from the stairway .... Obviously the dog could not do any
of </B>
<P><B>these things , yet the house was entirely secured . I just figure it's
</B>
<P><B>lucky that the presence so bent on scaring my relatives didn't find
a way </B>
<P><B>to put an end to them and not just the dog !</B>

<H3>	<A NAME=shotgun>Grandpa Rides Shotgun</A>
</H3><P><B>by 	CldFire@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I'd like to share an experiance that happened to me many years ago.
 I haven't thought about it much lately, but after reading through the stories
on your page it's been on my mind lately.  I was 17 at the time, I'm 29 now,
and living in North Dakota, where I had been born and raised.  I had just
purchased my first car, and part of the deal I had made with my father was
for me to take a job to pay for gas and anything else the car needed.  The
job I got was at at a recreation hall in town (my parents farm was 16 miles
from town)  Most weekends I worked the late shift, closing the hall and getting
home around 2:30AM.  </B>
<P><B>About two weeks after I got my car, a 1978 mustang, some friends of
mine borrowed my car and smashed in the drivers side.  Well, in order to
get the car fixed and keep my job, I needed transportation.  I ended up borrowing
my gradfathers 1966 oldsmobile while my car was getting fixed.</B>
<P><B>Let me give you a little background about the car.  It was purchased
by my grandfather new.  He loved to go driving around in his "hot rod" as
he called it.  My grandad would go for long drives every Sunday until 1974
when he got cancer.  He was VERY ill and wasn't able to drive due the medication
he was on.  Fortunately, the illness didn't last long and he passed away
in the early part of 1975.  Now some people might not view this as fortunate,
but with the amount of pain he was in, death was actually a release for him.
 As a matter of fact the only joy he said he had was playing with his grand
kids and when my dad would drive him around town.  After grandpa passed on
my grandmother mothballed the car.  She wouldn't drive the car, but every
once in a while when we came to visit we'd find her just sitting in the car.
 She said she felt closer to him in the car.  </B>
<P><B>Flash forward 10 years.  After a little tuning up, the car ran great.
 My dad was amazed that it ran so good, considering it hadn't been started
in 10 years.  About the third day I had the car, I had to close at work again.
 As I was driving home I was very sleepy.  Out of the corner of my eye I
saw a shadow in the passenger seat of the car.  Thinking it was just a trick
of light I didn't pay much attention to it.  But to keep myself awake I started
talking to the shadow and pretending it was my grandfather riding shotgun
with me.  I told him what was new in my life and how my day went. I asked
him how he was and basically just talked to the air all the way home.  This
started to happen every time I drove home late night.  I'd just start a
conversation and keep "grandpa" up to date on what was happening with me
and my family.  Some nights I don't remember most of the drive. It was almost
like I'd fall asleep, but I made it home safe every time.  It became a joke
with my friends and myself.  If someone else rode with me I'd always tell
them to ask permission before sitting in grandpa's seat.  We'd all get a
good laugh and go where ever we were going.  I even started talking to grandpa
when I drove alone during the day.  Jump forward 3 months.  My car is repaired
but I haven't paid my parents back for the repair yet.  It really didn't
matter as I was growing to love that old 66 Olds.  I was at work until almost
2am one night.  As soon as I got into the car I noticed that grandpa's shadow
was darker than normal and no matter what angle the lights hit the car the
shadow never changed.  Not that this really bothered me.  We started our
"chat" and I headed for home.  Here's the freaky part.  About 5 miles into
the drive the shadow's head turned and looked straight at me.  I then heard
someone tell me to STOP!  Needless to say this scared the hell out of me
and I hit the brakes.  About five feet from where the car came to a stop,
a friend of mine had ran his car off the road.  He was walking up out of
the ditch just as I hit the brakes.  If I hadn't stopped the car I would
have killed him.  There is no doubt in my mind that grandpa saved my friends
life that night as well as my sanity.  If I would have killed my friend I
don't know if I could have lived with myself.  After that night my friends
and I didn't joke so much about grandpa's seat in the car.</B>
<P><B>A couple of last things.  </B>
<P><B>1. My grandfather came to America with his parents when he was 6. 
He would lapse into german many times when he was talking, especially when
he was excited.  In the last paragraph I said I heard "STOP".  After I thought
about it later, what I actually had heard was "HALTE".  Guess what language
that is.</B>
<P><B>2. Everyone in my family I've told this story to has told me it was
just my imagination, except for one person, my grandmother.  She's told me
she saw and talked to my grandfather constantly from the day of his death.
 As a matter of fact, the only time she said he wasn't around was the six
months I borrowed the car.  He returned the same day I returned the car.</B>
<P>
<P><B>From the day my grandfather "talked" to me I felt his prescence with
me almost constantly up until 3 years ago.  3 years ago last January my
grandmother died.  I had been living in California for 4 years when I got
the call informing me of my grandmothers illness.  I made plans to go back
to see her, but the next night I had a dream.  In the dream my grandpa came
to me and told me he was leaving.  He said he was proud of me and what I'd
done with my life.  Suddenly my grandmother appeared beside him.  They told
me they loved me and I'd see them again someday.  And then they vanished.
 My roommate woke me up saying I was yelling in my sleep.  The time was 130am
pacific time.  My grandmother died at 325 central standered time.  The exact
same time I was having my dream.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I've only had one other instance where I've experiance the paranormal,
and it was definitely not a nice experiance.  Maybe I'll share it with you
later.  Thanks for your web page.  It's nice to share my story with other
people who've experiance the type of thing I have.</B>

<H3><A NAME=visitors>Visitors</A>
</H3><P><B>by 	Janet_Castillo@ccm2.hf.intel.com </B>
<P>
<P><B> About 5 years ago, my then husband and I moved into an apartment.
 Our </B>
<P><B>     bedroom was directly over the livingroom which had a back door
that we </B>
<P><B>     used instead of the front door.  My husband always went to work
at </B>
<P><B>     5:30am and I would stay in bed until it was time for me to get
ready </B>
<P><B>     for work.  One morning about 10 minutes after he left, I heard
him </B>
<P><B>     come home and turn on the tv.  I then heard him come up the stairs
and </B>
<P><B>     at the top of the stairs it sounded like he was scratching the
rug </B>
<P><B>     like a dog.  I was not asleep, but I was unable to move.  I can't
</B>
<P><B>     describe what I felt.  I was terrified and there was a feeling
of </B>
<P><B>     evil, like I'd never felt or imagined before.  When I finally
could </B>
<P><B>     move, the scratching had stopped and there was no one in the </B>
<P><B>     apartment, just me.  The tv was not on and the back door was locked.
 </B>
<P><B>     </B>
<P><B>     Every morning after my husband left for work, I would have these
</B>
<P><B>     "visitations."  And each time I was unable to move.    One time
there </B>
<P><B>     were 3 tall, skinny people dressed in black standing in the doorway
</B>
<P><B>     whispering and looking in my direction.  The final straw was the
same </B>
<P><B>     3 people visited again and one came and stood directly over me.
 He </B>
<P><B>     looked at me and finally whispered to me, but to this day, I can't
</B>
<P><B>     remember what he said, I just remember it being threatening. 
</B>
<P><B>     </B>
<P><B>     My husband and I were in the middle of getting ready to move.
 After </B>
<P><B>     the last incident, I broke down and told my husband what had been
</B>
<P><B>     happening every morning after he left.  I told him I was scared
</B>
<P><B>     because I felt that if the people ever figured out we were moving,
</B>
<P><B>     something horrible would happen to me.  He laughed at me and said
I </B>
<P><B>     had imagined it all, but luckily we moved the next day.  Maybe
he was </B>
<P><B>     right and I did imagine it, but I don't think I could imagine
how I </B>
<P><B>     felt, and I hope I never feel that way again.</B>

<H3><A NAME=basement>The Basement</A>
</H3><P><B>by cgjurns@servtech.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>I don't know whether this is a haunting or not, but a lot of things
have </B>
<P><B>happened at my grandmother's house that we (my family and I) can't
</B>
<P><B>explain.  </B>
<P><B>  First off, there's the basement.  When my grandfather was  alive,
he </B>
<P><B>was an alchoholic, and would spend most of his evenings in the basement,
</B>
<P><B>drinking and smoking cigarettes.  Anyways, one time i went into the
</B>
<P><B>basement to get something from the downstairs fridge, and all the sudden
</B>
<P><B>I smelled cigarette smoke! It really freaked me out, so i called my
dad, </B>
<P><B>and he came downstairs, and he smelled it too. the basement's walls
are </B>
<P><B>cement, so its not like they are wood and can absorb the smell.  another
</B>
<P><B>thing, when my grandfather would get drunk, instead of going to the
</B>
<P><B>upstairs bathroom to throw up in the toilet, he'd throw up in the </B>
<P><B>stationary tub downstairs.  Well, a couple of months ago, my grandma
went </B>
<P><B>downstairs to do some laundry (the washer's in the basement) and found,
</B>
<P><B>um, throw- up in the stationary tub! The doors had all been locked,
and </B>
<P><B>she hadn't gone out recently, so there's no way someone could have
gotten </B>
<P><B>into the house.  </B>
<P><B>also, I swear i've seen things- shadows- out of the corner of my eye.
 Of </B>
<P><B>course, this could be just imagination, but you couldn't pay me to
spend </B>
<P><B>a night in that house alone!  My mom (who is 45 years old) won't even
go </B>
<P><B>into the basement during the day!</B>

<H3><A NAME=door>The Slamming Door</A>
</H3><P><B>by debbie@cse-inc.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>I personally have had two paranormal experiences in my life, and both
of them occurred in</B>
<P><B>1978.  Before I relate the first story, I should explain that my paternal
grandfather died of</B>
<P><B>cancer in 1967.  I was four years old at the time, and I remember missing
him terribly.  I</B>
<P><B>wondered why he had left forever without saying goodbye.  My family
lived in the country, and</B>
<P><B>my grandfather's property was nearby.  In his will, he asked to be
buried on a hill above my</B>
<P><B>house.  From there he had a great view of the valley, and the backyard
where I always played.</B>
<P>
<P><B>In 1977, my parents divorced, and when our property was sold in August
of the following year,</B>
<P><B>my grandpa had to be moved to a cemetary 30 miles away.  The trouble
started the night after</B>
<P><B>he was exhumed.  My father had moved out of our house several months
earlier, so my mother and</B>
<P><B>I (and my cat Tasha) were living alone.  That night, I was awakened
just after midnight by the</B>
<P><B>slamming of the front door.  My bedroom window was adjacent to the
heavy wooden door, and when</B>
<P><B>it slammed shut the impact rattled my windowpanes.  My cat almost jumped
out of her skin.</B>
<P><B>The noise also woke my mother, whose room was on the other side of
the house.  I heard her</B>
<P><B>come out of her room and walk down the hall to investigate.  When I
joined her, we searched</B>
<P><B>the place, and found the doors and windows all locked.  We could find
no one hiding inside or</B>
<P><B>outside, so we went back to bed.  The slamming door continued to wake
us up at the same</B>
<P><B>time for the next four nights.  On the fifth night, we waited in our
rooms for the door to</B>
<P><B>slam, expecting to go to sleep afterwards.  But after the noise died
away, I heard another</B>
<P><B>sound:  footsteps.  Immediately, my cat jumped down off the bed and
hid underneath it.  This</B>
<P><B>scared me even more.  Someone was walking down the hall.  I heard the
boards creak in front of</B>
<P><B>my mother's bedroom, and the footsteps continued on down the hall towards
me.  I couldn't</B>
<P><B>breathe at this point.  Whoever it was stopped right inside my doorway.
 I could feel the</B>
<P><B>presence in the dark and knew I was being stared at.  I was just about
to say "Grandpa,"</B>
<P><B>hoping it was him, when my mother opened her bedroom door and turned
on the hall light.</B>
<P><B>Nobody was there.  We searched the place again and found no one on
the property.  After that</B>
<P><B>night we were not bothered again.  No more slamming door or mysterious
footsteps.  We decided</B>
<P><B>it must have been my grandfather.  He was just letting us know before
he left that being moved</B>
<P><B>from his chosen resting place had made him unhappy.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The following November, my mother and I moved into the new A-frame
house she had had built.</B>
<P><B>Right away strange things started to happen.  At first we thought that
my grandpa had followed</B>
<P><B>us.  But we soon gave up this notion.  This ghost -- if that's what
it was -- was different.</B>
<P><B>It didn't seem to like me.  I was constantly being locked out of the
house.  Every time I</B>
<P><B>walked out on our high front deck, which had no stairs, I couldn't
get back inside.  We had</B>
<P><B>all our doors and locks checked and changed a few times, which didn't
help.  One day, my</B>
<P><B>friend Pamela came home with me after school to spend the night.  We
went out on the deck</B>
<P><B>together for awhile, and then found ourselves locked out.  We had to
wait an hour for my mom</B>
<P><B>to come home from work.  I never told Pam about the other weird stuff
that was going on.  We</B>
<P><B>also had to have the wiring checked and rechecked.  (The electrician
and locksmith thought we</B>
<P><B>were crazy, or paranoid.)  All our lights kept going on and off by
themselves.  And always in</B>
<P><B>the middle of the night.  We saw the side door, which led into the
living room, open by itself</B>
<P><B>many times.  Right afterwards, the living room would be filled with
the smell of cigarette</B>
<P><B>smoke.  (My grandpa never smoked.)  All these occurrences continued
for about a year, and then</B>
<P><B>gradually stopped altogether.  To this day, I think about the haunted
new house and wonder</B>
<P><B>who, or what, my mother and I were living with.</B>

<H3><A NAME=eve>Christmas Eve</A>
</H3><P><B>by 	mladouce@citenet.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>This story is very personal, but it left me with a greater sense of
what</B>
<P><B>is beyond this existance.  The Christmas of 1990 heading into 1991</B>
<P><B>proved a very trying holliday for me.  A very close friend of mine
died</B>
<P><B>of Meningitice which spread quite a scare throught the town.  He was</B>
<P><B>only 12 or 13 years at the time of his death which was the day of</B>
<P><B>Christmas eve.  That day I spent my time getting shots and taking
pills</B>
<P><B>and being stuned with my friends.  That night I went to my
grandparents</B>
<P><B>for supper.  I Left their house befor my parents.  I just wanted some</B>
<P><B>time alone to think about my friend.  I got changed and went to bed
at</B>
<P><B>about ten or eleven and quickly fell asleep. about and hour later I
sat</B>
<P><B>up in my bed and opened my eyes and there he was.  Just standing
across</B>
<P><B>the room from me.  I said nothing and I made no movements.  I geuss
I</B>
<P><B>was just too afraid to move or even yell.  He looked at me turned to</B>
<P><B>face the wall beside me and walked out of the room.  I quickly closed
my</B>
<P><B>eyes and feared what would be there if I opened them.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I've never seen him since.  I guess the only time I ever do is in my</B>
<P><B>dreams.  After that experience I've opened my mind to spirits and the</B>
<P><B>world beyond.  I anticipate and fear the next time I experience</B>
<P><B>somthing.</B>
<P><B>That is If I live to experience again.</B>
