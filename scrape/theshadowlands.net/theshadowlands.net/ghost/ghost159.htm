<p><b>Footsteps on the Stairs</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; gmpjmp@mindspring.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My parents bought and old brick home built in the 1800's the house
was devided into wings. While visting , I was in an upstairs guest room
in one of the wings, no one else except my mom was in the house. I decided
to make up the bed before going downstairs to have a cup of coffee, I was
facing away from the doorway tucking in the sheets, when I heard footsteps
comming up the&nbsp; two sets of wooden stairs and walking down the hardwood
floors, the steps paused at my doorway, still facing away from the door,
thinking it was my mother, I said" that I would be finished in just a second".
I then heard the footsteps continue down the hall, and another bedroom
door open and shut. Thinking it odd that my mother didn't reply when I
spoke to her, I then went across the hall and opened the only other bedroom
door on the wing, the one I heard the door open and shut. The room was
empty. Wondering how on earth my mom had passed me to go back down the
hall, I leaned over the&nbsp; stairs and called her. When I got no answer
I went down the stairs to the other end of the house to find my mother
sitting at the kitchen table reading the paper, she was puzzled when I
ask her why she had come upstairs and had left&nbsp; without speaking to
me.......she said she had not been upstairs all morning. Months later&nbsp;
the children would never play upstairs</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;in a playroom in another wing of the house, when we asked
why they would not play in this lovely playroom, they said that&nbsp; the
footsteps scared them, and that the lady they had seen on the stairs would't
speak to them and it scared them. We had never mentioned what had happened
to me that morning. My parents soon sold the house, Never have I been so
sure of what I heard that morning, The footsets I heard were crisp and
clear on those hardwood floors.</b>

<p><b>Ghost in my Favorite Room</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Nanunanu27@cs.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My house has always had extra "company".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's been
13 years since we moved</b>
<br><b>in here and for a while there were some really odd things happening.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>ten years old when we moved in and fell in love with the huge, empty
attic</b>
<br><b>upstairs.&nbsp; I would bring my toys and my little sister up there
to play with.</b>
<br><b>She was eight at the time, so we had a lot of fun together.&nbsp;
We brought our</b>
<br><b>dollhouse up there and would spend hours making up stories and having
fun.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>would go up there and read by myself a lot because it was quieter
than the</b>
<br><b>rest of the house.&nbsp; Nothing out of the ordinary ever happened
while my sister</b>
<br><b>and I played up there and I felt very comfortable.&nbsp; In the
far end of the</b>
<br><b>room there wee racks where clothing must have hung before.&nbsp;
One day I was up</b>
<br><b>there alone playing when I discovered this old fashioned looking
gold purse</b>
<br><b>with a painting of a dear in a meadow on it, and being a lover of
old things,</b>
<br><b>I was psyched--&nbsp; I brought it to my mother and she said it
looked like a</b>
<br><b>pocketbook from the 1920s that her grandmother used to have-- sort
of a</b>
<br><b>flapper type style.&nbsp; We hung the pocket book in the back of
the closet to</b>
<br><b>keep it out harms way.&nbsp; About a year later, my father and a
friend of his</b>
<br><b>transformed my attic-playroom into a bedroom for both me and my
sister.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>father left a quarter of the room where the pocketbook had been
found alone</b>
<br><b>and put up a wall and a door seperating the rest of the bedroom
from that</b>
<br><b>area.&nbsp; My sister did not like her bed being up against the
wall of the "back</b>
<br><b>room".&nbsp; Then, what I felt next was unexpected and unbelievable.&nbsp;
I was lying</b>
<br><b>there with my eyes open, frozen with fear.&nbsp; I felt as if someone
was watching</b>
<br><b>me, but I was afraid to move.&nbsp; I had never felt like this before,
and was</b>
<br><b>never afraid of the dark as a child.&nbsp; My sister said, "Can
I please come over</b>
<br><b>and sleep with you?"&nbsp; Now, I susally said no to this and stop
being a baby-</b>
<br><b>but I wanted her to come over-- pretending to be reluctant I said,
alright</b>
<br><b>but don't hug me-even though I realy wanted to be--&nbsp; She ran
over and</b>
<br><b>squeezed me and I sqeueezed back and she said I'm scared and I said,
"me too"</b>
<br><b>and then&nbsp; BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM!!!! 4 loud knocks right on the
wall which our</b>
<br><b>heads were practically up against.&nbsp; I could actually feel the
virbations from</b>
<br><b>the wall. Then my sister crying said, "WHAT was That??"&nbsp; "Me"
I said "don't</b>
<br><b>worry"-- I was trying to tell myself that it was me when it happened
again</b>
<br><b>BOOM, BOOM BOOM BOOM!! We both jumped up and ran downstairs at this
point--</b>
<br><b>into my parents' bedroom and my father went up to see if there was
anyone</b>
<br><b>hiding up there-- no one was, however and my sister refused to go
back up</b>
<br><b>there and slept with my parents.&nbsp; I, however, went back up
there scared,but</b>
<br><b>mad that my favorite place was trying to kick me out-- I felt almost
betrayed</b>
<br><b>and hurt, so I stayed up there for the whole night, refusing to
leave, but</b>
<br><b>hoping it would not try to scare me-- it didn't--My sister would
make make</b>
<br><b>attempts to sleep up thre later, but would always run downstairs
at some</b>
<br><b>point.&nbsp; I couldn't blame her since most of the time, I really
wanted to join</b>
<br><b>her, but-- never would.&nbsp; Over the next several years I often
heard whispering</b>
<br><b>and an the door knob being wiggled as if someone was trying to get
in,at</b>
<br><b>first-- then it became a game.&nbsp; The dooor knob would wiggle
really fast and I</b>
<br><b>would say-- I'm trying to sleep-- and it would stop- and then I
got used to</b>
<br><b>the weird noises-- It's 13 years later and in that time I've had
many friends</b>
<br><b>tell&nbsp; me that they heard whispering or tapping on the wall
or someone</b>
<br><b>breathing in their ear-&nbsp; to which I say, I told you there was
a ghost in my</b>
<br><b>house--&nbsp; but it sparked my interest in the paranormal in which
I am an avid</b>
<br><b>believer because of my ghost-buddy-- I don't know if the purse actually</b>
<br><b>belonged to the ghost, but the house was built in 1940, after the
flapper</b>
<br><b>times- but my mother did tell me that the old man who used to occupy
the</b>
<br><b>house had two wives who both passed on-- whether or not either of
them died</b>
<br><b>in this house, i don't know.&nbsp; The purse may have belonged to
one of them---</b>

<br><b>My Parents Old Haunted House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: GookeyMay@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I just wanted to ask if you knew why or what could cause such paranormal</b>
<br><b>experiences.&nbsp; My parents old house was very haunted, but it
seemed more like</b>
<br><b>someone was protecting us if anything.&nbsp; Well after my brother
and I moved</b>
<br><b>out, my parents experienced more scarier phenomenons.&nbsp; Whomever
was in the</b>
<br><b>house, started doing things that were really freaky.&nbsp; My poor
father claims</b>
<br><b>that he had a voice in his ear tell him he "had no soul".&nbsp;&nbsp;
That really</b>
<br><b>scared him and he does not like to talk about it.&nbsp; My dad is
a wonderful</b>
<br><b>person and he is not crazy, so to speak.&nbsp; So I believe him,
but felt for him.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Gave me the chills when he told me.&nbsp; They used to hear
the phone ring, but</b>
<br><b>it wasn't their normal ring.&nbsp; It was a quiet ring, really distinct.&nbsp;
When</b>
<br><b>they answered it, they could hear a womans voice through a dial
tone.&nbsp;&nbsp; But</b>
<br><b>it sounded far away and they couldn't understand what she was saying.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>poor mother seen a man standing in the doorway and then he dissapeared.</b>
<br><b>Scared her because she thought it was someone in her house, then
she realized</b>
<br><b>what it was.&nbsp; Somone, or something used to tie their shoe laces
in knots</b>
<br><b>while they were sleeping.&nbsp; They always speek of whispers in
there ear at</b>
<br><b>night.&nbsp; Someone would say their name in their in hear.&nbsp;
My parents are now in</b>
<br><b>their mid 40's so I am sure they are not suffering from illusions
that come</b>
<br><b>with being elderly or anything of the sort.&nbsp; They are wonderful
parents and</b>
<br><b>would not exagerate ever.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once someone slamed their
bedroom door and they</b>
<br><b>couldn't get it open for hours.&nbsp; Just weird and scary things
that happen</b>
<br><b>their.&nbsp; As I teenager, I remember hearing someone run up and
down my steps,</b>
<br><b>very loud in the middle of the night.&nbsp; Never anyone there.&nbsp;
So my parents</b>
<br><b>went through hell in that home.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now they moved and live
close to me and</b>
<br><b>have a wonderful, quiet home.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for listening
to my story, if you</b>
<br><b>can explain any of this to me, like why this happen, please do.&nbsp;
I have a</b>
<br><b>great story of a restaurant, about 3 blocks from my parents old
house which I</b>
<br><b>managed that would blow your mind.&nbsp; If your interested, i will
tell ya the</b>
<br><b>story sometime.&nbsp; I live in a suburb outside of Detroit MI.&nbsp;
Hope you can help</b>

<p><b>Lab Visitor?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: altered_st@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This is a continuing and ongoing experience taking</b>
<br><b>place in the lab I work in at CSU Fullerton in</b>
<br><b>southern California. It began in the Fall when I'd</b>
<br><b>stay late perhaps 4 nights a week to work on projects</b>
<br><b>- I often got the feeling that I wasn't alone - that</b>
<br><b>"hair on end, I'm being watched" sort of thing. I</b>
<br><b>sometimes felt something touch the hair on the back of</b>
<br><b>my head, which is VERY CREEPY when you know you're the</b>
<br><b>only one in the room (perhaps even the entire floor) @</b>
<br><b>1:00 a.m.! This even happened/happens when others are</b>
<br><b>in the room. The presence went away in the Spring (or</b>
<br><b>at least I didn't notice it) with the hustle and</b>
<br><b>bustle of classes and students moving in and out of</b>
<br><b>the room (not to mention that I didn't stay late more</b>
<br><b>than once the entire semester) - but now it's summer</b>
<br><b>and nobody is around, and it's happening again. I</b>
<br><b>often see flashes of light and notice sudden movements</b>
<br><b>in my peripheral vision - but when I look up, nothing</b>
<br><b>is there.</b>
<br><b>The latest is the motion-sensitive lights turning on</b>
<br><b>when nobody is there. This never used to happen - and</b>
<br><b>began only a few weeks ago. This lab and an adjacent</b>
<br><b>room have such lights. I'll be working at a computer</b>
<br><b>in the lab (with lights on), and the lights in the</b>
<br><b>other room will be off (the motion sensor times out</b>
<br><b>after 15 minutes). For no apparent reason, the'll</b>
<br><b>suddenly come on - as they do when someone enters the</b>
<br><b>room. The problem is that nobody is entering the room</b>
<br><b>- the only ways in are through the room I work in, and</b>
<br><b>a locked door. Keeps me on my toes to say the least.</b>

<p><b>My New Haunted House</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>By: otis167@juno.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I built my new house house on top of a spooky sand dune near Lake</b>
<br><b>Michigan in Indiana. I payed only 1500 dollars for the lot, and
figured</b>
<br><b>that there must have been something wrong with it.&nbsp; There was.&nbsp;
The plot</b>
<br><b>needed about 3000 dollars worth of bulldozing to stablize it; otherwise</b>
<br><b>the house would have collapsed down the hillside.&nbsp; May be that
would have</b>
<br><b>been for the best.&nbsp; I found out later that the house was built
on an old</b>
<br><b>Indian trail and I bet you all can guess what happened.</b>
<br><b>I moved in on a dark and stormy night (no</b>
<br><b>kidding).&nbsp; When I opened the drapes on the sliding glass doors
and turned</b>
<br><b>on the outside lights, I was jolted.&nbsp; My beautiful view of
the forest</b>
<br><b>looked like the set from the film, Bride of Frankenstein.&nbsp;
The stunted</b>
<br><b>oak trees had all lost their leaves and moaned in the wind.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The house had no telephone and was very isolated and I was
feeling</b>
<br><b>very spooked, so I had a large glass of wine for my nerves and went
to</b>
<br><b>bed.&nbsp; I had nearly gotten to sleep, when the front door blew
open with a</b>
<br><b>loud crash. I jumped out of bed with my heart pounding and crept
towards</b>
<br><b>the door, switching on the hall light.&nbsp; I saw the eerie figure
of a man</b>
<br><b>in the large window and nearly had a stroke.&nbsp; I soon realized
that this</b>
<br><b>was my own reflection and tried to calm down.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I managed to get to sleep, but was awakened by a noise.&nbsp;
This time I</b>
<br><b>heard foot steps walking around the house --&nbsp; disembodied foot
steps.</b>
<br><b>Needless to say, I didn't get much sleep that cold October night,
but</b>
<br><b>finally dozed off just before dawn.&nbsp; I was later awakened by
more foot</b>
<br><b>steps.&nbsp; Thank God it was only the phone man!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I lived in the house for nearly seventeen</b>
<br><b>years with only the occasional visit from the other world.&nbsp;
The house</b>
<br><b>that I live in now is fairly quiet.&nbsp; Perhaps, like many Viet
Nam Era</b>
<br><b>veterans, it is I that is haunted and not my houses.</b>

<p><b>I am a Strong Believer Now!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Fran414081@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hey, you guys can call me Kat, I guess.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, since as long as I can remember I have believed in ghosts.&nbsp;
When I</b>
<br><b>was little I'd play with dolls and sometimes I'd pretend that one
of them</b>
<br><b>died then came back to life or something.&nbsp; It's been the same
with aliens and</b>
<br><b>all that supernatural stuff.&nbsp; I;ve been a believer but never
a strong believer</b>
<br><b>.&nbsp; Well, I believed that they existed but I didn't believe
that they could</b>
<br><b>actually come down and contact with people, actually with me.&nbsp;
Well, here is</b>
<br><b>one part of my story.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know when this was, maybe Novemeber or
something, but I was 12</b>
<br><b>and I was at this very computer that I'm at now and I was on AOL
like I am</b>
<br><b>now looking at one of my favorite sites.&nbsp; My computer was on
a surge</b>
<br><b>protector and if it was moved the comptuer would shut down.&nbsp;
That happened</b>
<br><b>before because I kciked it and I had no problem with it.&nbsp; It
happened because</b>
<br><b>the surge protector wasn't pluged in enough.&nbsp; So I was sitting
at my comptuer</b>
<br><b>with one of my legs tucked under adn the other wrapped around the
base of the</b>
<br><b>chair.&nbsp; CLICK.&nbsp; The comptuer tuns off.&nbsp; Sometimes
it turns of by itslef but</b>
<br><b>not this time. I get down on the floor and the surge protector was
plugged in</b>
<br><b>all the way and I had to turn it on again.&nbsp; When I switched
it on I was in</b>
<br><b>tears and I heard that same click I heard when the computer went
off.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>didn't tunr on my computer for about 4 days after that.&nbsp; I
was to afraid.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once I was in bed and I felt my bed shanking.&nbsp;
I'm like "oh my God this</b>
<br><b>isn't happening."&nbsp; Everytime I would sit up it would stop but
when I would</b>
<br><b>lay back down it would start again, especially on my back.&nbsp;
I ended sleeping</b>
<br><b>on my side that night.</b>
<br><b>Thursday&nbsp; October 7 (I'll never forget this date)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was one day before we got out for Thanksgiving
break and I brought my</b>
<br><b>rats home.&nbsp; My science class was doing a project in groups
on different</b>
<br><b>animals and my group chose rats.&nbsp; Don't ask.&nbsp; Ok, so I
brought the rats up to</b>
<br><b>my room and I set them down near my CD player in my bedroom.&nbsp;
I decided to</b>
<br><b>turn on a little Backstreet Boys Millennium for them.&nbsp; So it
was playing and</b>
<br><b>then my mom called my down to take my dog Ali (Oli).&nbsp; So I
was outside and it</b>
<br><b>wa about 5pm or 5:30pm but no later.&nbsp; My dog has these slippers
that he loves</b>
<br><b>and he was running around with it and I was trying to catch him.&nbsp;
Then I hear</b>
<br><b>tap tap on a window, and upstaris window, my window.&nbsp; I look
up and I see</b>
<br><b>this woman standing there.&nbsp; "Oh it's my mom".&nbsp; I kept
my eyes on the window</b>
<br><b>thinking "When is my mom gonna open it and call me in" because she
has</b>
<br><b>before.&nbsp; I kept moving back and forth and then sometime I realized
that this</b>
<br><b>woman was very tall.&nbsp; So then I was walking back and forth
back and forth and</b>
<br><b>then I glance down in the kitchen and I see my mother making dinner.&nbsp;
I look</b>
<br><b>up, the woman is gonae and I run into the house crying.&nbsp; I
asked my mom if</b>
<br><b>she was in my room and she said "no" and I started crying even harder.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>so freaked.&nbsp; I decided to go up and check on the rats.&nbsp;
Now I have a CD</b>
<br><b>player and the it's hooked up to a tuner and the tuner has to be
turned on to</b>
<br><b>CD in order to hear the CD music.&nbsp; Now I can hear music coming
out so I'm</b>
<br><b>thinking "everything is ok" until I open the door.&nbsp; Not only
was the tuner NOT</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;on CD but on radio, the radio was going on and off and the
CD player was</b>
<br><b>still on.&nbsp; I ran downstaris screaming and then my mom called
the police.</b>
<br><b>They came and they checked everywhere.&nbsp; I would have perferred
they found a</b>
<br><b>man crouched in a corner with a knife ready to kill my family then
NOTHING.</b>
<br><b>For months at least 3, maybe more, I didn't go to sleep with out
the light</b>
<br><b>on.&nbsp; Till this day when I get into bed I try and not to look
in front of my</b>
<br><b>to my window but rather at the celing or burry my hea in the covers.&nbsp;
I'm 12</b>
<br><b>and I was 12 then.&nbsp; It was Thanksgiving vaction.&nbsp; I didn't
get a lot of</b>
<br><b>thanks that was pleasureable.</b>
<br><b>This is a ture stoy and I'm not kidding.&nbsp; All of this scared
the heck outta</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; I'm not afarid as much any more.&nbsp; The funny thing
is that this all</b>
<br><b>happened in less then 5 months when my mother and I were fighting
a lot.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>rather see these "happenings" as signs that my gaurdian is watching
over me</b>
<br><b>and will protect me.&nbsp; After thinking about it a while, that
woman, that tall</b>
<br><b>woman, had my grandmother's tall broad body (Nano is what I called
her).&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>died of lung cancer.&nbsp; She quit smoking when I was apoted cold
turkey.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>don't remember much about her but what her outlin was and one Christmas
when</b>
<br><b>she came.&nbsp; That's all and her funeral when I was 6.</b>

<br><b>London Ghost Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: steven@bradleyrees.freeserve.co.uk</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi my name is Ben (i am 11) and resently my dad took me on a couple
of ghosts walks in the haunted city of London. There</b>
<br><b>were many exciting stories and at one time when we were in a cellar
of an old prison i though i heard strange noises of the poltergiest 'Fred'
which, my i add none of the adults heard.</b>
<br><b>One story that i found really exciting was the one about 50 Barkley
Square.</b>
<br><b>First story:</b>
<br><b>Everyone knew that this house was haunted and one night a man and
his friends were in a pub where they made a bet. The bet was for one the
the men to stay in the top room of this house while the others were in
the celler. If the man did this he would have won &pound;200 which was
alot of money in the 1800s. if by any chance he was in danger all he had
to do was ring the bell which was attached to the celler.</b>
<br><b>Later that night the bell rang violently sending the friends up
to the top floor. then they saw it. Their friend lying on</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;the bed with his lip curled over his teeth and his eyes popping
out. Most people say he died from fright but then again who knows?</b><b></b>
<p><b>Second story:</b>
<br><b>One night, 70 yrs later a couple of sailors needed a place to stay
for the night so they broke into the haunted house. they stayed on the
top floor. later the men heard something. one men got away but there was
something in the way of the door so the other man had no way out other
than the window with many metal spikes in the way...</b>

<br><b>&nbsp;The Nurse Loved the Kids</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: danae@entermail.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>It seems I might have a ghost story to tell.</b>
<br><b>I live in Pennsylvania and have been in the medical field for over
20 years.</b>
<br><b>At one facility that I worked, we had our own resident ghost.</b>
<br><b>Her name was Mrs. McClain and she use to be one of the nurses that
took care</b>
<br><b>of the low functioning mentally retarted kids that lived there.
You could</b>
<br><b>always tell she was around by her smells. She either smelled like
breakfast</b>
<br><b>foods(cinnamon toast and&nbsp; bacon) or this god awful fruity perfume
that</b>
<br><b>sheuse to wear.</b>
<br><b>It seems that she was coming home from work one night and got into
a car</b>
<br><b>accident. but it seem that her spirit was so dedicated to these
kids, that</b>
<br><b>she helps take care of them still.</b>
<br><b>I was privy to her one day when I was giving the kids their daily
bath. We</b>
<br><b>had bathe tubs in their rooms and</b>
<br><b>would pick them up and bathe then. Then we would carry them back
to their</b>
<br><b>beds and finish dressing them.</b>
<br><b>One child was VERY wet and I knew that I would be bathing that child
next.</b>
<br><b>While I was bathing another child, I felt as if someone was snapping
at my</b>
<br><b>ear lobe. I turned a round, but no one was there. This happened
several</b>
<br><b>times over several minuets and I finally yelled for her to just
stop and I</b>
<br><b>would get to the child when I was done with the one I was working
on.</b>
<br><b>When I was done with the first child, I turned around and the second
one</b>
<br><b>that I knew was drenched and in his night clothes, was clean and
dresses. No</b>
<br><b>One else was in the room with me and No One could have come in without
my</b>
<br><b>knowledge since there was only one entrance and they would have
had to get</b>
<br><b>past me to get to the child.</b>
<br><b>I think I thanked her, but I didn't want her doing my job.</b>
<br><b>She helped myself and others on occasion.</b>
<br><b>She's one of the most friendliest ghosts that I have seen.</b>
<br><b>If you would like more stories on her or others the I've met, please
let me</b>
<br><b>know.</b>

<br><b>collection of stories. It was the story about Carson or the Dominguez
Hills</b>
<br><b>in Southern California. This story is very true and if you live</b>
<br><b>in the area you know that this story is past down from generation
to</b>
<br><b>generation, in the city of Carson there is a very old adobe home
which is now</b>
<br><b>a museum, it's called the Dominguez Ranch Home Museum and has a
very violent</b>
<br><b>past. One story is of the "hopping" man and the sighting of the
hopping man</b>
<br><b>is sometimes reported on seen on Del Amo and Wilmington Ave. and
also on</b>
<br><b>Victoria Blvd. near the University. If you have a chapter of investigators
in</b>
<br><b>So. Cal it would be of some interest to see this old museum. it
is also</b>
<br><b>located several blocks from an also very haunted spot the Banning
Residence</b>
<br><b>Museum in Wilmington. But check out the Dominguez Ranch Museum because
I know</b>
<br><b>from friends and relatives in the area that the place is haunted.</b>

<p><b>Haunted Windchimes</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LilWoman520@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have enjoyed your stories so much!&nbsp; It's a wonderful feeling
to know that</b>
<br><b>you're not the only one experiencing these things.&nbsp; I do have
a couple of</b>
<br><b>stories, but will only share one at this time.</b>
<br><b>My first husband and I married on September 5, 1992.&nbsp; We had
our honeymoon on</b>
<br><b>Cape Cod, Massachusetts.&nbsp; While shopping at a Tradewinds Gift
Shop there, we</b>
<br><b>purchased windchimes, made of brass and wood.&nbsp; When we got
home we hung them</b>
<br><b>outside our front door on the light fixture.&nbsp; It was a beautiful
sound, but</b>
<br><b>at night, it seemed creepy to me, and I would often bring them in
and lay</b>
<br><b>them on the floor on a towel by the front door to be hung up again
the next</b>
<br><b>morning.&nbsp; At first nothing happened, then a few days later
I was home alone</b>
<br><b>in the late afternoon, around 5pm.&nbsp; And the windchimes were
doing there</b>
<br><b>thing, chiming.&nbsp; Anyway, for some reason, although it was still
sunny out, I</b>
<br><b>was getting creeped out by the sound, and decided to bring them
in.&nbsp; I laid</b>
<br><b>them on a towel by the front door and proceeded back the the kitchen
to do</b>
<br><b>some dishes.&nbsp; Suddenly, I stopped and froze.&nbsp; I could
still hear them</b>
<br><b>chiming.&nbsp; I thought that maybe the sound had stuck in my head.&nbsp;
And that</b>
<br><b>maybe it was my overactive imagination.&nbsp; But this went on for
about a half</b>
<br><b>and hour, until my husband returned home.&nbsp; I told him what
happened, and he</b>
<br><b>confessed to me that at night when we were lying in bed, he often
heard the</b>
<br><b>windchimes too, after we had brought them in and laid them on the
towel.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>asked him if it was possible that the sound was just in our heads
cause we</b>
<br><b>were hearing them chime all day.&nbsp; He said it was possible,
and we just</b>
<br><b>ignored it.&nbsp; Also, at that time we investigated the neighborhood
around us to</b>
<br><b>see if someone else had windchimes, and maybe we were hearing them.&nbsp;
But no</b>
<br><b>one did.</b>
<br><b>One night, on a Saturday, we couldn't sleep, because we both heard
the</b>
<br><b>windchimes.&nbsp; I decided to test it, and we started humming the
same tune at</b>
<br><b>the same time.&nbsp; We started getting real creeped out, and decided
to get rid</b>
<br><b>of the chimes.&nbsp; We both went down stairs, the front door being
at the bottom</b>
<br><b>and picked up the chimes, drove to a gas station and dumped them
in the trash</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; This was around 1am.&nbsp; We got home and listened
intently, but there</b>
<br><b>was no more sound.&nbsp; The next day we were at church, and the
Pastor began</b>
<br><b>preaching about spirits.&nbsp; He related a story about windchimes,
and that in</b>
<br><b>some countries when they make them they pray a prayer over them
to send a</b>
<br><b>spirit along with them.&nbsp; All I know is that we never hear the
sounds again</b>
<br><b>after that night.&nbsp; thanks for listening!</b>

<p><b>Night in Gettysburg</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: GIJOE163@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is my friend, Travis' account of a night
in Gettysburg.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me and a party of friends and family members
went to Sachs Covered Bridge</b>
<br><b>near Gettysburg, PA, for a ghost hunt and picnic. When we got there,
we went</b>
<br><b>in and ate our food from McDonalds. After we were done, we decided
to show</b>
<br><b>the disappearing act that happens on the bridge. Some people stand
on one</b>
<br><b>side of the bridge, and one or two walk down through the bridge.
As they got</b>
<br><b>further down the bridge, heavy fog sets in and they disappear. Then,
some</b>
<br><b>people came with flash photography digital cameras. As they entered
the</b>
<br><b>bridge they took a picture, and as the picture showed up in the
monitor on</b>
<br><b>the digital camera, it showed that the bridge was covered in ectoplasm.
So,</b>
<br><b>they took some more pics, and later on, when they took more, they
found orbs</b>
<br><b>in their pictures- energy orbs. We found a cold spot in the bridge,
Me and my</b>
<br><b>friend stood there as it seemed the cold spot moved back and forth.
First we</b>
<br><b>thought, it was the wind. But as we extended our arms, the center
of our arms</b>
<br><b>were cold and the tips of our hands and upper arms were warm. There
in fact,</b>
<br><b>were no breezes, and it was roughly 80 degrees. When the people
left with the</b>
<br><b>flash photography didgital cameras, me, dad and my friend Joe heard
what</b>
<br><b>sounded like marching- and a rebel yell. Gettysburg, in 1863, had
been the</b>
<br><b>sight of a terrible battle that took the lives of 51,000 men. Sachs
Bridge</b>
<br><b>had been a bridge Union and Confederate soldiers used. Then, we
heard what</b>
<br><b>sounded like chains clanking, which was what would have been artillery
being</b>
<br><b>moved. Also, we heard horses walking across the bridge. The hoof
beats were</b>
<br><b>hard to miss on a wood floor. Strange things had happened before
too. Steve,</b>
<br><b>another firend, had had experiences here too. His dad had sais ,
"All we need</b>
<br><b>now is a cat jumping up on my shoulder," and as If on cue, a cat
flew up</b>
<br><b>through the wooden boarded floor, and landed on his shoulder and
disappeared.</b>
<br><b>But then, back at present at the bridge, we heard something that
vaguely</b>
<br><b>sounded like a meow. As we looked into the shadows we saw a cat
run off into</b>
<br><b>the night, My friend's dad turned his lights on, and the cat had
disappeared</b>
<br><b>into the woods. We figured that we should leave with all this creepy
stuff</b>
<br><b>that happened. We hopped in the van except for some of my friends.
Then we</b>
<br><b>smelled wet, sweaty horses. And then, one of the adults said "They're
not</b>
<br><b>using the bridge- they're using the water!!!!" Then, in the grass,
we seen</b>
<br><b>what looked lika beat out Porsche trail. As we hopped into the van,
we</b>
<br><b>remembered what the lady had said to us when she was taking pictures
at</b>
<br><b>Spangler's Spring (Also in Gettysburg, which is now a national park)
She'd</b>
<br><b>taken a picture of one colleagues standng on a rock. When the picture
came</b>
<br><b>up, there was two hundred orbs floating around her in a box of red
ectoplasm.</b>
<br><b>Before we left, my dad and I were standing near some bushes, and
we heard</b>
<br><b>cracking. The gravel which lines the bridge path down into the woods
was</b>
<br><b>being kicked up.My friend's dad said if you are there pick up a
rock and</b>
<br><b>throw it. After that a rock came rollng up to his foot. Then he
said You can</b>
<br><b>do better than that. All sorts of rocks were being thrown up in
the air. Then</b>
<br><b>we left- Quickly.</b>

ago, I was</b>

it was very dark,</b>
<br><b>although it was 7 in the morning.&nbsp; You have to pass the kitchen
in order to</b>
<br><b>get to my bathroom.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I was all dressed and ready
to go to school, but I</b>
<br><b>had to brush my hair. I was running a little late, so i ran to the
bathroom,</b>
<br><b>whizzing by my kitchen and glancing at the kitchen table.&nbsp;
I stopped abruptly</b>
<br><b>because I had just seen my grandfather, even when he was miles away!&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>so scared, but I slowly went back to the kitchen, and the apparition
was gone.</b>

<br><b>John</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jessicareyes@email.msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>In order to understand fully I must let you in on some info. I lived
in a small city outside of San Antonio, Texas. My neighborhood consisted
of eleven houses, it was a wooded neighborhood. I met my best friend when
I was nine years old&nbsp; she lived up the street from me. About three
years later my parents built a house next door to her. She had one older
sister and two older brothers. Being the only kids that lived in the neighborhood
we were always together. I have one brother he is two years older than
me and he wuld always hang around with her brothers.</b>
<br><b>I've always felt safe there. Her older brother John was very suicidal.
He use to get really scared and tell people that the devil was after him.
One night when I was about thirteen she was spending the night at my house,
when John tried to commit suicide by hanging himself&nbsp; of there roof.
We heard the dogs barking so we all went outside to see if my dad and uncle
had gotten home from the store,but it was him.He jumped and we just saw
him hanging. Thank god that he was unsuccessful the rope snapped and he
just fell. He ended up running to the neighbors yard and hiding in their
chicken coop.He said that the devil was chasing him.Years went by and things
were normal John seemed like things were so much better for him. He got
a job with my dad after finishing high school. My dad took him to work
everyday . When I was 15&nbsp; John ended up hanging himself to death.
We were all devastated. We thought he was okay, but I guess his problems
ran deeper than we thought.</b>
<br><b>Now here comes the weird part. Saturday night's at my house were
poker nights my uncle's and aunts would come over and sometimes john's
parents. Well&nbsp; this time it was just family. I went to my room around
11:30 p.m. and without turning on the light; turned on the radio, and laid
down on my bed.&nbsp; I looked by my feet and there was John standing there.
I frieked,I couldn't even blink I just stared at him, then he went away.
I jumped up and ran to the kitchen where everyone was at.&nbsp; I didn't
tell anyone cause his father was sitting there playing cards.</b>
<br><b>That night I had a dream&nbsp; he told me that he was okay and not
to worry about him.&nbsp; He wanted me to take care of his family and to
tell them that he loved them.&nbsp; When I woke up in the morning I told
my mother what had happened, and she told me "Last night&nbsp; a year ago
was when John died".</b>

<p><b>Many Experiences, Many Ghosts?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Auburn278@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first glance my house looks like your average
middle class single</b>
<br><b>family home.&nbsp; It's a two story with a basement, a front porch,
a deck, a</b>
<br><b>decent sized front yard, a pool in the backyard, and kids always
running in</b>
<br><b>and out the front door.&nbsp; During the day my house is warm and
inviting, full</b>
<br><b>of windows that let in the light, and even the basement is non threatening</b>
<br><b>during the day.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But sometimes at night I am scared, lying in
my bed with my door closed</b>
<br><b>and locked, the covers pulled over my head and the TV on with the
volume</b>
<br><b>turned down.&nbsp; Now mind you, I am now 20 years old, still living
here with my</b>
<br><b>parents, and I am still scared sometimes.&nbsp; I know that it isn't
my</b>
<br><b>imagination because it has been going on for so long.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's a little background to make it easier
to understand where the</b>
<br><b>activity is taking place:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My house was built after
World War II as housing for Bethlehem Steel,</b>
<br><b>and some say Fort Holabird (Baltimore, MD).&nbsp; It was constructed
quickly along</b>
<br><b>with many others in the neighborhood.&nbsp; My neighborhood is known
as Gray</b>
<br><b>Manor/Northpoint and is in Dundalk, a suburb of Baltimore County,
Maryland.</b>
<br><b>Here there was a famous local battle in the war of 1812, called
the battle of</b>
<br><b>Northpoint.&nbsp; The British landed in a cove (now where Fort Howard
Park is) and</b>
<br><b>marched up Northpoint Road towards Baltimore City, clashing along
the way</b>
<br><b>with American troops.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you first walk in the front door you are
in the living room.&nbsp; In the</b>
<br><b>far right corner of the living room is a door that leads to the
kitchen, the</b>
<br><b>far left leads to a hallway in which there are doors to the bathroom,
my</b>
<br><b>parents room, and the steps to the basement.&nbsp; When you close
the front door,</b>
<br><b>behind it is the hallway where the door to my room and the steps
upstairs</b>
<br><b>are.&nbsp; The basement consists of one large room and a smaller
storage room.</b>
<br><b>The large basement room can be divided into the old side and the
new side.</b>
<br><b>The old side is where the furnace is and is the original crawl space
under</b>
<br><b>the house.&nbsp; The new side was added about 25 years ago by my
parents and was</b>
<br><b>originally intended as a club basement/party room.&nbsp; The new
side has the</b>
<br><b>computer desk, the washer and dryer, a large freezer, a mini tv
room for the</b>
<br><b>kids, and storage space behind the walls (running behind all the
walls, about</b>
<br><b>2 feet thick and running the length of the walls).&nbsp; The old
side is prone to</b>
<br><b>flooding and is used for storage and also includes the smaller room.&nbsp;
The old</b>
<br><b>side isn't as well lit as the new side and can look really creepy.&nbsp;
Upstairs</b>
<br><b>has two bedrooms and a large room at the top of the stairs that
acts as a</b>
<br><b>guest bedroom and storage.&nbsp; Running behind the length of the
entire back wall</b>
<br><b>is an attic space that reaches back about 6 or 7 feet and is gabled.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now on with my stories.&nbsp;&nbsp; First for
the common occurances:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a bay window in my living room facing
the street, the small</b>
<br><b>window closest to the door will often open on it's own.&nbsp; I
have witnessed it</b>
<br><b>flying open myself.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Late at night I'll hear the sound of someone
opening and closing the</b>
<br><b>cabinets or refrigerator, sitting glasses on the table, or moving
chairs</b>
<br><b>around in the kitchen.&nbsp; A few times I have gone to investigate,
only to find</b>
<br><b>that no one else is awake.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have heard someone walking around in the living
room when I am home</b>
<br><b>alone, even when my bedroom door is open (which looks right out
into the</b>
<br><b>living room) and I can see no one in there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have heard the sound of boxes moving around
in the attic.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have heard knocking coming from the storage
space behind the walls in</b>
<br><b>the basement.&nbsp; It's as if someone is knocking with their fist
on the paneling</b>
<br><b>that encloses the storage space.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Window air conditioners have turned on even when
they are not plugged in</b>
<br><b>or have turned off when the switch is in the on position (they are
constant</b>
<br><b>run, not energy saver).</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now for a few specific occurances:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night when I was about 14 or 15 I had two
friends spending the night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;We decided to sleep in the large upstairs bedroom because
it has a double</b>
<br><b>bed and a twin bed (in my room I only have a twin).</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had the TV on and were watching music videos
when suddenly the TV</b>
<br><b>picture turned to snow and then the TV just shut off.&nbsp; I freaked
out because</b>
<br><b>there is no way that could have happened with the whole room being
on one</b>
<br><b>circuit.&nbsp; Just as suddenly as it had shut off, it came back
on, but on a</b>
<br><b>different channel.&nbsp; I unplugged the TV and turned on the radio
because I was</b>
<br><b>beyond unerved.&nbsp; My two friends found it really neat that this
had happened.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night we all went to sleep in the big double
bed and kept on a night</b>
<br><b>light.&nbsp; We also kept the radio playing really loud.&nbsp; Suddenly
during the</b>
<br><b>night the radio started playing really loud.&nbsp; I jumped out
of the bed and</b>
<br><b>turned off the radio, thinking that the alarm had been set, but
then it</b>
<br><b>occured to me that it had been on all night.&nbsp; I glanced at
the clock and</b>
<br><b>noticed that it was about 3am.&nbsp; I thought this funny, because
many times I</b>
<br><b>had awakened to wierd noises around 3am.&nbsp; Only recently have
I discovered</b>
<br><b>that most paranormal activity carries a pattern of 3.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another night, more recently, I was home alone
and sleeping in my parents</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; I had the door closed and the AC on.&nbsp; I had just
fallen asleep when I</b>
<br><b>heard the door open.&nbsp; I looked up and saw it swing open very
slowly.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>didn't think anything of it at first, until I realized that there
was light</b>
<br><b>in the other room.&nbsp; I had turned out all the lights before
going to bed.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>sat up very quickly and looked through the door into the living
room.&nbsp; The TV</b>
<br><b>was on and so was the large overhead light.&nbsp; Normally we only
turned on the</b>
<br><b>two wall lights, not the large overhead one.&nbsp; Also, the ceiling
fan was on</b>
<br><b>and the bathroom light was on.&nbsp; I got up and turned everything
off.&nbsp; On my</b>
<br><b>way back to bed I noticed it was just after 3am.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day I woke up around 9am and made myself
breakfast and then went</b>
<br><b>over a friend's house.&nbsp; The events of the night before had
me a little</b>
<br><b>unerved and so I decided to go out for the day.&nbsp; My friend
came back to my</b>
<br><b>house with me a little before 2pm and we put in a movie.&nbsp; About
an hour later</b>
<br><b>we heard a loud bang from the kitchen.&nbsp; We both looked at eachother
and then</b>
<br><b>got up and walked into the kitchen.&nbsp; Two of the kitchen chairs
were laying on</b>
<br><b>their sides in the middle of the floor and the oven door was open.&nbsp;
I grabbed</b>
<br><b>my car keys and we left the house.&nbsp; I spent the night over
my friends house</b>
<br><b>and didn't go back home until my parent's came back.&nbsp; They
didn't mention</b>
<br><b>anything about disorder in the kitchen.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My parents haven't really mentioned any strange
experiences, but one day</b>
<br><b>in conversation they mentioned the fact that when they were redoing
the front</b>
<br><b>porch they found a cross facing towards the house under the front
steps.&nbsp; A</b>
<br><b>cross should be facing away from the house to ward of evil.&nbsp;
By facing</b>
<br><b>towards the house it was a sign of evil.&nbsp; They dug out the
cement cross and</b>
<br><b>had a minister friend bless the house.&nbsp; I thought this interesting,
since</b>
<br><b>this happened when I was about 7 and stuff is still happening in
the house.</b>

<p><b>By:&nbsp; mtallman@ncn.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>On Aug. 16,1893 Martin &amp; Helena Schultz were murdered for their
money!</b>
<br><b>The story of their demise has been told a thousand fold, since their
deaths more than 100 yrs.ago.</b>
<br><b>It's a story, similar to our modern "Urban Legends", except it took
place on a farmstead in the middle of nowhere.</b>
<br><b>The Schultzs were a strange pair, having been rumored to belong
to a sect of some odd ball religion that believed that all work must be
done at night. All the house work, and all the farm work was carried on
in the darkness of night.People reported, that when they rode in their
buggies past the Shultzs' farm at night, they would see Martin working
in the fields. Illuminated only by his lantern light, as he tended his
crops.</b>
<br><b>It was commonly known by his neighbors that Martin didn't trust
the banks, and that he hid his money on the farm. In places that only he
and Helena knew about.&nbsp; The years passed, and their farm prospered,
but Martin &amp; Helena had not been blessed with any children. In 1893
Martin was 60 yrs. old, and felt that he needed to hire a farmhand to help
with the chores.</b>
<br><b>A young man, a ( transient ) in the area was hired by Martin, and
came to live on the farmstead with them. Likely the farmhand lived in the
Schultzs' original farmhome, which was a small one room log cabin. While
the Schultzs lived in a well constructed 2 story home.&nbsp; The farmhand
had worked for the Schultzs for a few months. And he had come to learn
of Martin's distrust of the banks.&nbsp; Having heard from the neighbors
that Martin hid all their money on the farmstead the hired man decided
he was going to look for it. But he never was able to find any of the money.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Growing ill-tempered at the lack of his ability to find the
money! The hired man decided to murder the Schultzs as the only place he
hadn't looked for the money, was in their home. And he was not allowed
in there.</b>
<br><b>As per their religious beliefs, Helena would arise in the dark of
the night to start her chores such as churning the</b>
<br><b>butter. Which she was doing that fatal night.&nbsp; The hired man
quietly walked up behind Helena and with a quick blow to her head, with
a sledge hammer, he killed her instantly. She didn't even have time to
gasp!</b>
<br><b>He then strode quietly to where Martin still laid asleep in bed,
having not yet risen for the night's work. The farmhand took a few quick
swings with the sledge hammer, and crushed Martin's skull, leaving him
dead where he lay.&nbsp; Then the farmhand feverishedly plundered the farmhome
in his attempts to find their money. The hours passed quickly, and as day
approached he fled the farmstead, and leaving behind him the majority of
their fortune, and the grissly murders of the Schultzs!</b>
<br><b>Neighbors discovered the murders the next day, and as the farmhand
was no where to be found he became the main suspect in the murder case.He
was shortly there after arrested in a neighboring town, and brought back
and held in jail while the investigation continued.After a couple of weeks,
the Sheriff still had no hard evidence to tie the farmhand to the murders,
so he had to release the man. The farmhand quickly fled the area, never
to be seen again.&nbsp; The Sheriff noted in his investigation, that they
too were unsuccessful in finding all of what had to be the Schultzs' amassed
fortune. But had the murderer looked inside their bible, he would have
found 800,&nbsp; one dollar bills. Each tucked in between the seperate
pages of the bible!&nbsp; A year had passed since the Schultzs' murder.
When neighbors noticed that on the north side of the Schultzs' tombstone
the image of a face could be seen in the grain of the stone. It was the
face of the farmhand, that was suspected in their murders. And the face
looked north to the site of the Schultzs' farmstead as it bordered the
cemetery on the north.&nbsp; Neighbors and townfolk alike felt this was
a reminder from the Schultzs as to who had killed them. The Sheriff attempted
to track down the farmhand, but his trail was cold, and he never was found
again.&nbsp; To this day the face can still be seen on the side of the
tombstone, but it has begun to fade!&nbsp; As has the farmstead, last year
it was bulldozed under and is now just a bean field.</b>
<br><b>I intend on returning to the Mt. Pleasant cemetery on Aug. 16,2000;
to see if the Schultzs will return one more time, to gaze upon their farmplace
and to lament it's demise, aswell as their own!&nbsp; Should you choose
to go to the city of Mt. Pleasant and stroll through the city's cemetery
looking for the Schultzs tombstone, you will never find it! For you are
at the wrong end of Iowa! The Mt. Pleasant cemetery is one of hunderds
of such rural cemeteries that dot the landscape of north west Iowa.</b>

in the</b>
<br><b>livivg room. I woke up to the sound of my dog growling, i had a
feeling</b>
<br><b>someone was watching me so i looked over by the chairs. I seen a
face</b>
<br><b>peering at me. It&nbsp; looked like the face of my brother so i
said "devin</b>

<p><b>My Cousin Joni</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Megan_Shelby@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>She had just turned 17 when she died in that terrible car accident.
I was only 7. She was my favorite cousin and always spent time with me
or took me with her when she went anywhere. After her death, I wrote her
letters to her and prayed to God that she would answer me.&nbsp; She never
did until about a year ago. I was in my sister's room reading a magazine
on her bed. I looked up&nbsp; and at the top of the stairs. There she was
standing in her favorite sweater and a pair of jeans.</b>
<br><b>I blinked in disbelief and she was gone. About a week later I was
in my mother's bathroom premping and I looked across her room into the
hallway. There she was again in the same outfit looking at me. It never
scared me. I told my mom about this and she said she was there telling
me that everything would be okay. At this time I was going through some
problems with my father and it was causing me a lot of stress and pain.
Now I'm 15 and sometimes I'll see other people in my house I don't even
know, but I do know there are there for some particular reason and that
I don't need to be scared.</b>

<p><b>My Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: parrish@localline.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was like, 4 or 5, maybe even 6, I saw a ghost. I was at my
uncle's house and we went fishing. When we came back, I looked inside the
window, and there was an old lady sitting there sewing. She was wearing
a bonnet, and a dress. She looked like somebody from the 1800's or early
1900's. Anyway, I ran inside to see her from a closer view, and she was
gone.&nbsp; The cross-stitch was still there, but I can't remember what
it was or what it said. The ghost was in black and white. My cousins say
they've saw ghosts and heard voices there too. But then they moved to another
old house closer to us, and it'snot haunted, so that's the end of that.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Visiting Grandmother</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: manteena@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>The experience that I had, I'm not ever sure about.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>had it, but my eyes could also have been playing</b>
<br><b>tricks on me.</b>
<br><b>My grandmother died in June of 1989 when I was 12 in</b>
<br><b>Portugal.&nbsp; I live in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.</b>
<br><b>One night, when I was about 13 or 14, I had gotten out</b>
<br><b>of the shower and it's about 5 steps away from</b>
<br><b>bedroom.&nbsp; I went into my bedroom and turned on the</b>
<br><b>lamp on my night table.&nbsp; When I turned around, there</b>
<br><b>was my grandmother.&nbsp; I had closed the door and she was</b>
<br><b>standing in the corner where my door and wall meet.</b>
<br><b>She was only there for a second, and then was gone.</b>
<br><b>I'm not sure if I was just tired, or if in fact, she</b>
<br><b>was really there?&nbsp; What could've been the purpose for</b>
<br><b>her visit?</b>

<p><b>Disappearing Dark Visitor</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: TerriP40@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I married young, at the tender age of 17. 10 months later, I had
a baby girl.</b>
<br><b>3 months later, she died of crib death. I was lost and heartbroken.
After the</b>
<br><b>funeral, I started having a visitor that I could see out of the
corner of my</b>
<br><b>eye, It was dark and when I would look, it would disappear. This
scared me</b>
<br><b>and I didn't know what it was.</b>
<br><b>3 years later, I had a son. This dark figure stayed with me until
Chris, My</b>
<br><b>son was almost 6 months old. then it disappeared and I've never
seen it</b>
<br><b>since. I'm not sure if it was my daughter who was watching over
me or not,</b>

<br><b>Grandfathers Walking</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mandipooh18@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Hi i thought i would send u my experiences with ghosts.</b>
<br><b>My Grandfather lived with us when i was around the age of 3 or 4.&nbsp;
He was</b>
<br><b>paralyzed from the neck down and could not move.he got worse and
was put</b>
<br><b>into the hospital where he died in 1991. Just days after he died
my mother</b>
<br><b>woke me up one night crying. I could smell the cherry tabacco he
always</b>
<br><b>chewed.Then i heard his voice coming from the living room. I looked
in there</b>
<br><b>and HE said *look amanda i can walk again*. He sounded so happy
and he just</b>
<br><b>smiled at me. he told me he loved me and goodbye. But this wasn't
the last</b>
<br><b>time i saw him. For many nights after his death i would see him
in my room</b>
<br><b>watching me sleep. Then about a month after he died my aunt got
a weird call</b>
<br><b>on her answering machine. We went to listen to it. Well first let
me tell u</b>
<br><b>this...My aunt and Grandfather had made a deal years before when
she was</b>
<br><b>still a little girl that whoever died first would let the other
know if</b>
<br><b>there was life after death. My aunt said there was and my Grandfather
said</b>
<br><b>there wasn't. Well anyways we listened to the message it said this</b>
<br><b>exactly(we still have the tape) *Marteen(my aunt) u was right* then
u here a</b>
<br><b>low chuckle just as my grandaddy had then nothin...no click where
the phone</b>
<br><b>was hung up or anything just a peaceful sound. Also many nights
when i would</b>
<br><b>stay with my aunt her tv would just shut off or come on by itself.
LIghts</b>
<br><b>would do the same thing but most of the time u could smeel cherry
tobacco.</b>
<br><b>Til this day i still see my grandfather from time to time. I will
wake up</b>
<br><b>with him looking at me smiling and shaking his head. Or i will see
him walk</b>
<br><b>by outside but by the time i get to the door he's gone. He came
to me once</b>
<br><b>in a dream and told that he loved me dearly and that i was growing
up to be</b>
<br><b>a fine young woman. then i woke up in time to see my bedroom door
close. I</b>
<br><b>think he wants to see me grow up finally and be on my own. He always
told me</b>
<br><b>he would be there if i ever needed him. And i think he always will
be.</b>

<p><b>The White Mist</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: VVMaleVamp@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My expierence started in 1992. My parents bought a ranch style 3
bedroom</b>
<br><b>home, and there was 5 of us. I was 18 at the time we moved there.
My step dad</b>
<br><b>built me a bedroom in the basement, because we needed it. About
a week or 2</b>
<br><b>after my 19th birthday in 93 I woke up during the night to use the
bathroom,</b>
<br><b>and when I did I saw this white mist type stuff in my room. I literally
just</b>
<br><b>froze there. The mist did have a shape that looked like a head because
it was</b>
<br><b>rounded at the top, and for 5 mins we both were staring at each
other not</b>
<br><b>moving, then it was gone. Where it was I could feel a cold spot
because it</b>
<br><b>was hovering over a chair I had by my stereo there. I think it had
to see if</b>
<br><b>I was friendly or harmful since I was a new person in the home.
I told my</b>
<br><b>family, but they didn't believe me. It always came to my room a
few nights a</b>
<br><b>month, and I just let it be there, and it didn't harm me or did
I harm it.</b>
<br><b>Then in 97, I moved away, but it didn't follow me to my new residence,
but</b>
<br><b>when I would go over to visit and do laundry, I sensed it being
there. Then</b>
<br><b>last year after my sister came home from college there was an incident
of</b>
<br><b>great proportions. My parents were having well problems, so my step
dad had</b>
<br><b>to dig a new well. Then my mom told me, that when they all came
home from an</b>
<br><b>outing, all my sister's things were thrown all over what used to
be my</b>
<br><b>bedroom, but all the other rooms in the house were untouched. They
always</b>
<br><b>lock the doors when they go somewhere My step dad must have harmed
my ghost</b>
<br><b>friend, and when it realised my stuff from the room, and I were
gone it must</b>
<br><b>have gotten upset and did that. So, I said I better come over, and
when I did</b>
<br><b>I felt the spirit's presence, and it was angry, so I told my step
dad he</b>
<br><b>better close the hole, and he did. After that I felt a touch on
my shoulder</b>
<br><b>in the laundry room and when I turned around no one was there. I
still feel</b>
<br><b>the presence everytime I go there. I don't know what it wants or
what.</b>
<br><b>Thanks for reading, and maybe you can explain how I can only sense
it, and</b>
<br><b>what it wants. These events are real, and not a fabricated story.</b>

<br><b>would say about a year old i would be talking in my crib my mom
would come up</b>
<br><b>and ask me who i am talking to and i would either point or say my

<br><b>over the year as my vocabulary got bigger and more understanding
i finally</b>
<br><b>one day came out and told my mom when she asked me again i finally
say</b>
<br><b>george. george lived in my house before he passed away my bedroom
now was his</b>
<br><b>room but he would haunt or i should say the baby's room (mine) or
living room</b>
<br><b>or kitchen and basement. one time when my mom put me to bed i had
just fallen</b>
<br><b>asleep when all of a sudden are banister to the stairs would start
rattling</b>
<br><b>cuz of coarse my grandfather built the house and that was one of
a few many</b>
<br><b>things that wasn't done right but anywasy george would shake the
banister</b>
<br><b>louder and louder each time my mom told him he was going to wake
the baby so</b>
<br><b>finally he got my mom so maD&nbsp; he finally stop. other times
george would hide</b>
<br><b>things and throw coffee cups around pull the blinds up and other
little</b>
<br><b>stuff. but for the past five years he hasn't been very active cuz
i guess</b>
<br><b>he's getting tired or the fact we got a dog and befor that we had
cats but i</b>
<br><b>don't think he likes dogs so all we get now and again is a missing
objected</b>
<br><b>or some little noises&nbsp; to shake the dogs up. there was a time
though which i</b>
<br><b>thought i was going crazy i was done in my basement with the quija
board and</b>
<br><b>i had candles and then i did whatever i did then i went up stairs
blowing out</b>
<br><b>the few candles i lit and it was all gone so i went upstairs and

<p><b>Dreaming????</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; g.madaus@gateway.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My greatgrandparents had recently died (I'm 12 by the way) and they
had built an old colonial house back in the 10's or 20's and it was writtren
in their will that someone was to look out for it. So, me and my dad went
up to the house (it was in Cape Cod and at the time we were living in Boston)
and did some minor repairs. By the time we were done it was very late and
we were really tired, so we rolled out our sleeping mats on the floor in
one of the rooms and soon were fast asleep. Around 1:00 I woke up and I
was really thirsty so i got up and got a glass of water. When I got back
to my mat I could not for the life of me get to sleep. I felt suddenly
full of this weird energy and it wasn't the kind you get after you wake
up in the morning, eat breakfast, and watch TV. It was somehow different...
intangible. Then, I noticed something odd about the room; it was a little
brighter than it was before and the brightness got even brighter. I was
suddenly really scared, terrified. I went to wake up my dad but I barely
got out of the covers when suddenly, before my eyes was the unmistakable
image of my great-grandmother... only it was different. She was transparent
and kinda foggy but it was her alright. I wasn't scared anymore. I felt
a certain peace... sereness. She seemed to smile and then she disappeared.
The brightness vanished and once more it grew dark, and the weird energetic
feeling vanished. But I still couldn't sleep. Not that I was scared; the
peaceful feeling lingered, but it just felt so inappropriate to go to sleep
after I saw a</b>
<br><b>ghost. The next day I told my dad about it but naturally he didn't
believe it. He told me as any parent would that I was just dreaming. Maybe
he was right.......but I doubt it...</b>

<p><b>Country Scare</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>By: melanie.miller@bt.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Melanie, and I live in the very north of Scotland.&nbsp;
My parents,</b>
<br><b>when I was 14,(5 years ago) moved into a very large old farmhouse,
way out</b>
<br><b>in the country.&nbsp; To give you an idea of the scale, when you
entered the</b>
<br><b>door, if you turned to the left there was a kitchen area which used
to have</b>
<br><b>a staircase leading to the room above (the servants quarters).&nbsp;
In the years</b>
<br><b>prior to us moving in, these stairs were removed, and the only access
to the</b>
<br><b>servants quarteres (my room!) was via the bedroom next to it.&nbsp;
I thought the</b>
<br><b>history was kindof cool, so this is why I wanted the room.&nbsp;
Because the</b>
<br><b>staircase was removed, to get from the kitchen to anywhere else
in the</b>
<br><b>house, you had to turn right at the front door, and walk along a
corridor.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, I often felt an uneasy presence in the house, and I did
not like the</b>
<br><b>corridor.&nbsp; Especially when I was standing in it, and the living
room door</b>
<br><b>slammed shut, with a very loud bang.&nbsp; It had already been shut,
and I was</b>
<br><b>the only one in the house!</b>
<br><b>The main thing about this house, though, was the footsteps in the
kitchen.</b>
<br><b>I often heard them very late at night, along with the sounds of
bolts being</b>
<br><b>shut, and doors, very quietly, being shut.&nbsp; I always felt it
was the spirit</b>
<br><b>of some servant who used to work in the house.&nbsp; After all,
who else would</b>
<br><b>have been tidying up the kitchen at 2am?</b>
<br><b>No-one in my family believed me, but I heard these sounds night
after night.</b>
<br><b>They never scared me, this ghost (unlike the one in the corridor)
was a good</b>
<br><b>one.</b>
<br><b>Finally one morning, I met my brother-in-law, who was staying with
us, and</b>
<br><b>he looked white as if he hadn't slept.&nbsp; he told me he had heard
someone in</b>
<br><b>the kitchen late at night, and had been watching tv, so he listened
for</b>
<br><b>hours waiting for them to walk past his bedroom (the entrance to
which was</b>
<br><b>in the corridor, and was the first room outside the kitchen) but
no-one</b>
<br><b>came.&nbsp; Needless to say, at least one person believed me after
that!</b>
<br><b>I hope you find this interesting.&nbsp; I have lots more stories
to tell, if</b>
<br><b>anyone is interested, feel free to contact me.</b>

<p><b>My Personal Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; snooger82@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Ever since I can remember, I have felt a distinct presence in my
house.</b>
<br><b>When I was little, fear of the unknown caused me to spend many an
hour on my</b>
<br><b>front porch, because I wanted to escape that feeling.&nbsp; Since
then, I have</b>
<br><b>come to think of my ghost as friendly, almost brotherly.&nbsp; My
sister and I</b>
<br><b>have discussed our guest, and while she has never seen anything
out of the</b>
<br><b>ordinary, she agrees with me that there is a very masculine presence
in the</b>
<br><b>house, and we both sense that his name is Michael.</b>
<br><b>I have only clearly seen him once, about 6 years ago.&nbsp; I was
on my front</b>
<br><b>porch, on a beautiful spring morning, waiting for my ride to school.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>remember that it was warm, the sun was shining brightly, and the
lilacs were</b>
<br><b>blooming.&nbsp; I saw a bright light from the corner of my eye.&nbsp;
I turned to face</b>
<br><b>it.&nbsp; The light materialized into a man of about 25.&nbsp; He
was wearing a</b>
<br><b>mid-19th century styled fawn-colored riding suit.&nbsp; He had very
fair skin,</b>
<br><b>and clear blue eyes.&nbsp; The apparition smiled at me, and them
faded.</b>
<br><b>A few weeks later, I was in the kitchen eating breakfast, when I
heard paper</b>
<br><b>rattling behind me.&nbsp; I figured my cat was curling up in the
newspaper on top</b>
<br><b>of the dishwasher, as he often does.&nbsp; When I turned around
to see if it were</b>
<br><b>him (I was planning on holding him) I saw the newspaper floating
in the air,</b>
<br><b>and the pages were turning as if someone were trying to find a particular</b>
<br><b>article very quickly.</b>
<br><b>Over the next five years or so, only little things happened.&nbsp;
My hair brush</b>
<br><b>would disappear and then reappear a week later in a place I had
already</b>
<br><b>looked for it.&nbsp; I would occasionally see a ball of light out
of the corner</b>
<br><b>of my eye, or I would just feel the hairs stand up on the back of
my neck</b>
<br><b>and know that my friend was close by.</b>
<br><b>Then, last summer, for some reason that I don't remember, I was
lying on my</b>
<br><b>couch, crying, and I felt a cold hand brush the hair off my forehead.&nbsp;
It</b>
<br><b>startled me, but I know that the gesture was out of kindness and
perhaps</b>
<br><b>brotherly affection.&nbsp; Nothing has happened since then, and
everything has</b>
<br><b>slowed down.&nbsp; I rarely even feel his presence.&nbsp; I think
that it might be due</b>
<br><b>to my boyfriend.&nbsp; I think that perhaps Michael feels that I
don't have room</b>
<br><b>for both of them in my life.</b>
<br><b>I've tried to figure out exactly where he came from.&nbsp; The best
I can figure</b>
<br><b>is that he must have been attached to the property our house is
on.&nbsp; Our</b>
<br><b>house was built in 1917, and as I have made a study of costume history,
I</b>
<br><b>know that his clothing dated to about 50 or 60 years before then.&nbsp;
I am sure</b>
<br><b>that I am not mistaken about his clothing.&nbsp; I have many antiques
in my</b>
<br><b>house, all of them family heirlooms, but I know he could not be
connected</b>
<br><b>with them, because there was never a Michael in my family, and no
one fits</b>
<br><b>his description.</b>

<p><b>Different Things</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Winkle613@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am from Kansas. My house is an old farm house.My grandparents and
their</b>
<br><b>parents and a family that worked the farm lived there at one time.
My house</b>
<br><b>was tied to the underground railroad. Anyway I felt safe with the
ghost in my</b>
<br><b>home altho I was very scared when it first made noises. I would
be paralized</b>
<br><b>with fear. I never really felt cold spots but the clock in my living
room</b>
<br><b>would change volume from nothing to very loud ticking. My table
and chairs</b>
<br><b>have banged and I have seen things appear running down the hallway.
I have</b>
<br><b>had things spin from the trees in my front yard. (bird feeder, wind
chime)</b>
<br><b>but there is no breeze rustling the tree itself. My daughter has
talked to</b>
<br><b>whoever it is. I think it maybe my Grandmother. The static in the
baby</b>
<br><b>monitor has changed volumes for no reason. My mother thought I was
nuts.</b>
<br><b>Until she was tapped by the person or spirit in my home. I gutted
this house</b>
<br><b>and rebuilt. I am very curious about this matter. The strange thing
is that</b>
<br><b>it only happens when there are just women in the house. I feel safe
with it.</b>
<br><b>I hear footsteps I have talked to the spirit explaining its startling
to hear</b>
<br><b>them but would like to know who they are. I am guessing like I said
I believe</b>
<br><b>it is a family member. Maybe you could shed some light for me. I
thank you</b>

<p><b>Haunted Steelshop</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: k.m.dillon@worldnet.att.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>The first thing I would like to say, is that</b>
<br><b>the story I'm about to tell you is true. It is</b>
<br><b>very hard for me to tell it. My name is Matt.</b>
<br><b>I'm a 30 year old Ironworker from Delaware</b>
<br><b>County, P.A. This experience happend to me in</b>
<br><b>the fall of 1989. I was working at a steel</b>
<br><b>fabrication shop in Chester P.A. One of my</b>
<br><b>duties was to cut steel plate on a large shear.</b>
<br><b>On this morning I was cutting quite a bit of</b>
<br><b>it. The building is set up in two sections, the</b>
<br><b>shop area and the warehouse area. The shear is</b>
<br><b>in the warehouse area. I took a break around</b>
<br><b>10;00 a.m. I was standing by the shear when, I</b>
<br><b>had a strange feeling, sort of a mixture of</b>
<br><b>nervousness and being watched. I started to</b>
<br><b>hear a clicking sound, slow at first,then</b>
<br><b>faster.it was coming from a corner of the</b>
<br><b>ceiling but I could not see anything! The sound</b>
<br><b>traveled toward me very fast. I felt something</b>
<br><b>grab my arm and it started pulling me toward</b>
<br><b>the oppisite side of the shear. I grabbed the</b>
<br><b>shear to stop it from pulling me. I struggled</b>
<br><b>for what seemed to be about 20 seconds.It took</b>
<br><b>all my strength to break loose, and when I did</b>
<br><b>I ran for the shop area with the clicking noise</b>
<br><b>chasing after me. As soon as I crossed into the</b>
<br><b>shop area, the noise stopped. I ran over to the</b>
<br><b>only other coworker in the building and tried</b>
<br><b>to explain what had happened,but he looked at</b>
<br><b>me like I was nuts!! I left work and went home.</b>
<br><b>The owner of the company fired me the next day.</b>
<br><b>I know this story might sound crazy, but it</b>
<br><b>really happened to me.I have only told about 3</b>
<br><b>people this story. It was the most terrifying</b>
<br><b>experience I have ever had. It bothers me to</b>
<br><b>think about it. I hope for someone to someday</b>
<br><b>give me some insight on what it was. Thank You,</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Doctors Office</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: DotRinear@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Several years ago I worked in a doctor's office in Porterville, Calif.</b>
<br><b>This office was on Putnam street across from the Sierra View Dist.</b>
<br><b>hospital. This office was in a group of Dr. offices all within separate</b>
<br><b>buldings.</b>
<br><b>I had occasion to work there some nights alone.</b>
<br><b>One night as I was filing and the office had been closed for a few</b>
<br><b>hours, I heard the sound of a person sliding off the examining table
and</b>
<br><b>the sound of feet hitting the floor.&nbsp; Of course I was surprised
as I</b>
<br><b>knew I was there alone. I went to that room and no one was there..I
then</b>
<br><b>checked all the rooms and they were of course empty.&nbsp; I was
perplexed</b>
<br><b>but soon went back</b>
<br><b>to work and a little while later I heard the sounds of instruments
being</b>
<br><b>taken from a stainless steel pan in that same room..I was very familiar</b>
<br><b>with this sound so I knew what it was. I went to investigate but
nothing</b>
<br><b>was there. By this time I was beginning to get frightened and decided
to</b>
<br><b>leave.</b>
<br><b>The next day I told everyone but they thought I had imagined it
and no</b>
<br><b>one would take me seriously.&nbsp; About a week later I was alone
again</b>
<br><b>working at night by myself when I heard the refridgerator door open
and</b>
<br><b>shut....this was in the very last room by the back door, I went
to</b>
<br><b>investigate but found nothing there.&nbsp; I went back to work up
front when</b>
<br><b>I heard the bathroom door open and close...well by this time I was</b>
<br><b>thoroughly frightened and ran outside to find some one who would
go</b>
<br><b>inside with me to lock up.&nbsp; I never went there again at night
to work.</b>
<br><b>Everyone would kid me about my "ghost" untill one night when the</b>
<br><b>receptionist had to work late by herself and as she was working
she</b>
<br><b>heard the back door open and steps coming up to her desk, she looked
up</b>
<br><b>expecting to see her husband but no one was there!&nbsp; It got
to the point</b>
<br><b>where none of us would stay alone in that office even at lunch</b>
<br><b>time..each of us heard things pertaining to our type of work...I
would</b>
<br><b>hear medical things being as I was the the nurse there and the other</b>
<br><b>girls would hear filing doors being opened or the click of light</b>
<br><b>switches, things like that.&nbsp; Later when the office closed I
talked to a</b>
<br><b>girl who had worked there before us and she said she had similar</b>
<br><b>experiences also.&nbsp; I recently went back to that area but the
buildings</b>
<br><b>were gone and a street put through that area. We never knew what
it was</b>
<br><b>but let me tell you it made us all aware of strange things that

<br><b>My Supernatural Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: DHorton42@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I enjoy
your page very much. I would love to tell you about my</b>
<br><b>haunting experiences however, I'm not&nbsp; a very good writer.
It probably won't</b>
<br><b>be very entertaining or be in the words that would describe it best..
But</b>
<br><b>I'll try...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My ghost experiences started when
I was about 12 years old. My Father</b>
<br><b>(who has passed away) and my mother purchased an old house in a
small town in</b>
<br><b>Kentucky. The house was over a hundred years old built from old
yellow</b>
<br><b>popular boards and was heated with a coal stove. It had one electric
wire</b>
<br><b>that ran from the kitchen were there was one outlet for four appliances
to</b>
<br><b>the other rooms were each room had one light switch and light fixture.
The</b>
<br><b>house faces away from the road that runs by it for it was built
facing the</b>
<br><b>old stage coach road that no longer excists.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; After we moved into the house I began to have these
dreams. They were of</b>
<br><b>this beautiful young black haired woman that I had never seen before.
I was</b>
<br><b>always at her funeral in a small church. When I first began to have
the dream</b>
<br><b>I had just moved into the town, knew nothing about it at all. After
several</b>
<br><b>months of the re-occuring dream I could even tell you were the church
was</b>
<br><b>located just a few streets over from were we lived. The church was
no longer</b>
<br><b>there but when I began to inquire about a church being on that street
I was</b>
<br><b>told that, that was so and so's house it used to be a church years
ago. My</b>
<br><b>dreams were always in color, the casket was in front of the church
with</b>
<br><b>flowers all around and I am walking down the isle towards the casket
between</b>
<br><b>two rolls of pews of people. The dream was always like real, like
I was</b>
<br><b>actually there and always about her funeral never a dream of her
being alive</b>
<br><b>so that I could learn what type of person that she was.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; The first couple of times that I had the dream I just considered
it to be a</b>
<br><b>nightmare, however after several weeks of the re-occuring dream
I didn't want</b>
<br><b>to sleep in my room anymore and I was affraid to go to sleep at
night.</b>
<br><b>Everytime that I told my Mother and Father about the dream the felling
that I</b>
<br><b>got was one of embarrassment, After all I was 12 years old and someone
my age</b>
<br><b>shouldn't be afraid to go to sleep at night. So I stopped telling
them about</b>
<br><b>the dreams even though I was having them night after night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then something freaky happened. My Father
began to remodel the house and</b>
<br><b>the dream changed it wasn't of her funeral any more it was about
my father</b>
<br><b>tearing out some old closets that ran all along one wall of the
house. The</b>
<br><b>closests consisted of tall doors about two foot wide with smaller
ones above</b>
<br><b>them for storing quilts and things I suppose. In front of these
closets was</b>
<br><b>the coal burning stove, and one of the closets was used to store
wood and</b>
<br><b>buckets of coal for burning. In my dream my mother is standing with
her arm</b>
<br><b>around my shoulder and we're watching my Father tear out the closets
and the</b>
<br><b>black haired womans body falls out into the floor in front of us.
It also</b>
<br><b>became a re-occuring dream.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then finally it happened my father began to tear out
the old closets, I</b>
<br><b>was so scared. My Father had never mentioned to me that he was going
to do</b>
<br><b>this yet I had that dream. I went to my mother and told her how
scared that I</b>
<br><b>was and about the dream and everything. She was like there's nothing
to be</b>
<br><b>scared of let's go and watch, and she is standing there with her
arm around</b>
<br><b>my shoulder while we are watching the closets be torn out just like
in the</b>
<br><b>dream which scared me even more because I couldn't think of one
time when she</b>
<br><b>had ever stood beside me with her arm around my shoulder before.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dad had finished tearing the closets out,
there was no body and the</b>
<br><b>dreams ended that very night. I was so very glad the next morning
when I</b>
<br><b>awoke. However, that was the beginning of events instead of the
end. The</b>
<br><b>frightening experiences were now in the physical realm instead of
my dreams.</b>
<br><b>My bed began to rock every night as I would try to go to sleep.
Doors would</b>
<br><b>open and close, lights would go on and off, objects occationally
moved</b>
<br><b>around, there was organ music and singing, people walking around
at night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that night of my Mother putting her arm
around me I felt like she</b>
<br><b>was open to my fears and I began to tell her everything. She moved
my bedroom</b>
<br><b>into another room and the bed actually stopped rocking and I was
able to</b>
<br><b>sleep peacefully from there onward. She still didn't quite believe
the things</b>
<br><b>that I was saying, she just keep saying that it was my imagination
and</b>
<br><b>things. Until she began to experence some things for herself.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; One day she began to ask me about my dreams and stuff
and was suddenly</b>
<br><b>very interested in what I had to say. I knew by the way that she
was acting</b>
<br><b>that something had happened and then she told me that she had actually
seen</b>
<br><b>her. My Mother was walking down the hallway towards the kitchen
and she saw a</b>
<br><b>woman standing in the hallway that she described as being young,
beautiful</b>
<br><b>and having black hair. She said that she looked real and she thought
that</b>
<br><b>someone had walked into the house through the kitchen door. She
said that she</b>
<br><b>asked her, "What do you want and what are you doing in my house?"
and the</b>
<br><b>woman moved her mouth like she was answering her, but no words came
out. Then</b>
<br><b>she simply vanished.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman was seen in the house on several occations.
I've seen her myself</b>
<br><b>one time walking down the hallway, and it was just like my mother
said she</b>
<br><b>looked real, she wasn't transparent, a orb or myst but looked as
real as you</b>
<br><b>and me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We later found out that the woman that the house
was built for had died</b>
<br><b>in the house one winter during child birth. They found her body
in the</b>
<br><b>closet. They thought that she might have been trying to keep the
baby warm.</b>
<br><b>She was described as being very young and beautiful and having black
hair..</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also I think that it is interesting to
point out that before she was</b>
<br><b>seen my father had rewired the house. He wasn't an electrictian
and hadn't</b>
<br><b>done anything like this before. He got his wires crossed somehow
and ran a</b>
<br><b>powerline into the ground, not the ground wire, but the earth ground
that</b>
<br><b>protects the house if lightening were to strike a line. His electricity
bills</b>
<br><b>were very high and he couldn't figure out why. It was at this same
time that</b>
<br><b>we were seeing this young woman. As far as I know she has never
been seen</b>
<br><b>again since the electrical problem was fixed. This may have nothing
to do</b>
<br><b>with the sightings at all. However, this might be worth investigation</b>
<br><b>further...</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><b>Now I'm a Believer!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ridge_kan@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I've had a few strange encounters but allways</b>
<br><b>chalked them up to imagination or being half asleep.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I assure you this was no dream. The reason i</b>
<br><b>decided to share this story is that the being in my</b>
<br><b>encounter resembles one from another story on your</b>
<br><b>site. I'll tell my story first.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I lived in a southeast kansas town at the</b>
<br><b>time(about 5 miles from the misourri line) and drove</b>
<br><b>about 20 miles to some friends of mine who have a farm</b>
<br><b>in the misourri countryside. We visited and watched</b>
<br><b>some movie till around 1am. When i left that night i</b>
<br><b>took dirt roads home instead of the highway i usually</b>
<br><b>took. I knew if i zig zagged south and west i would</b>
<br><b>eventually get to where i was going. After several</b>
<br><b>different roads i made a right turn onto another road.</b>
<br><b>After i made the corner i saw what appeared to be a</b>
<br><b>large dog in the middle of the road up just a bit. I</b>
<br><b>thought i'll just go around it. As i got closer i</b>
<br><b>realized it was no dog and it wasn't any animal i've</b>
<br><b>ever seen before. By now i'm stopped in the road and</b>
<br><b>am looking at this beast that i can only describe as</b>
<br><b>half bear half werewolf. The instant feeling i felt</b>
<br><b>was that it was waiting there for me. It had the most</b>
<br><b>evil face i've ever seen and it's eyes were as red as</b>
<br><b>fire, not glowing, just red. It was just pure hate.</b>
<br><b>This creture must have been at least six feet tall and</b>
<br><b>it was hunched backed with large fangs(very rabid</b>
<br><b>looking)and its hands hung to its knees. After the</b>
<br><b>momentary shock wore off, i sped backwards to the</b>
<br><b>intersection and made a prompt exit from the area.</b>
<br><b>when i arrived at my grandmothers house where i lived</b>
<br><b>at the time, my grandmother knew somthing was wrong( i</b>
<br><b>guess i had a look of terror still on my face) and i</b>
<br><b>told her the story and she did believe me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; This creature reminds me of the thing the kids saw</b>
<br><b>in the cemetary in one of your stories. I dont think i</b>
<br><b>could ever bring myself to go camping out in the woods again.</b>

<p><b>One Last Time Before You Go</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: AJM6468@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>On an old dirt road there are 2 houses. One belonged to my parents
and the</b>
<br><b>other to my Grampa.&nbsp; I grew up in both.&nbsp; When I was 19
my Grampa and I had a</b>
<br><b>misunderstanding&nbsp; and we never spoke to eachother again. I
will regret that</b>
<br><b>for the rest of my life! He died 2 years later and a man bought
the house, my</b>
<br><b>parents moved and as fate would have it, I married the man that
bought</b>
<br><b>Grampa's house. One evening I was talking to a friend in the livingroom
about</b>
<br><b>the misunderstanding, I got so upset about it I started to scream
at my</b>
<br><b>deceased Grandfather. I said "DO YOU HEAR ME!" and just then some
noise came</b>
<br><b>out of the end of the room as if someone was stomping their feet
to let me</b>
<br><b>know they were there-louder and louder!! My friend got real scared
and begged</b>
<br><b>me to leave the room but I kept pushing the issue with Grampa screaming
how</b>
<br><b>sorry I was. Finally I demanded he come to see me. The room got
cold and loud</b>
<br><b>with stomping footsteps but I could not see him. My friend grabbed
me and ran</b>
<br><b>up the stairs screaming-everything stopped.&nbsp; Months later I
had my cards read</b>
<br><b>and was told of that night by the reader. He said "he won't show
himself</b>
<br><b>because you'd have a heart attack if he did and he knows this".
The reader</b>
<br><b>saw my home, my Grampa and some events without a word from me. Sometimes
I</b>
<br><b>see things move about the house, I hear the stomping and often I
can feel a</b>
<br><b>hand on my head and my shoulder.&nbsp; It is comforting so I talk
to him as if</b>
<br><b>he's next to me. I only wish I could have changed the last day I
saw him and</b>
<br><b>every once in a while I ask "Grampa for the chance, one last time
before you</b>
<br><b>go"</b>

<br><b>Sleep Tight</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:jennifer_golden@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have had two experiences with what I think was a ghost. the story</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;starts about six years ago when I was seven, my friend and
I where in the big field a short walk away from my house. we were marking
out a couple of dens among the blackberry bushes. we use blue tape as markers.
we had marked out about four or five dens when I had to go home to ask
for more time. my friend said she would find some more places while she
was waiting. so we set out in opposite directions, I was almost clear of
the field when I herd a voice calling my name.&nbsp;&nbsp; the voice was
faint, but I stopped thinking it was my friend. I was just about to continue
home when the voice called my&nbsp; name again, and again I stop. a few
minutes later my friend ran up to me asking if I had shouted her name.
I hadn't and told her so, then I asked if she had called mine, she replied
no. that's when we both felt really scared and ran out of the field and
back to our homes. to this day I have no idea who had called my name. for
the next six years there was nothing, then about a month ago I was ill,
lying in my bed I felt a soft kiss on my cheek I turned round to see who
it was. no one was there. a week after that I had burred my self under
my blanket after reading a extremely frightening story. I was paralysed
with fear and wide awake. after about twenty minutes I turned over to look
at my alarm clock the time was nine minutes past eleven, that's when I
felt this pressure on my shoulder blades, pinning me down. there was this
mild feeling of suffocation, and what felt like strong arms around my waist.
at first I was worried by this, but a few minutes later I was drifting
of to sleep. the next night I felt the same felling of suffocation and
arms around my waist but not the pressure on my shoulder blades. it weird
at first it friend me to think that I could fell invisible arms around
my waist. but now that I think about it who ever it was, was trying to
help me sleep peacefully. I know my story may sound hard to believe but
its true. my only wish is that you believe me, because I wouldn't lie to
you.</b>

<p><b>hi again, as I was looking through the web site I remembered one
or two other strange things that have happened to me. I remember once have
this one three minutes happening to me on four separate occasions. I don't
remember what happen I just remember that it did. there was this other
thing a few weeks ago I was drawing these faces on a peace of paper. only
one of them was good. a few weeks later someone drove past me in a car

<p><b>Paranormal Phenomena</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sabha@satyam.net.in .</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;Came upon your&nbsp; website quite by accident. My ancestral
home is in a town called Allahabad in India. About 15 years back an unusual
occurance started taking place there. As evening began, it started raining
stones. These were not too big at first and came from one direction only.
No onew was hurt but everyone was understandably a worried. A thorough
personal investigation by my employees, and other friends revealed no positive
clues. The stones continued falling. They would stop just as it got dark.
Then, the press got the story and since my family is a well known one,
the police landed up in full force. My house was literally taken over by
the cops and they were all set to put a bullet into anyone they caught
in the act. This resulted in the stones getting bigger and bigger till
they became huge. About the size of a human fist or sometimes larger. They
would come with such force that they'd shatter after hitting a wall. Yet
no one was hurt. This naturally sent the cops diving for cover. Then they
came up with the novel solution of just grabbing a couple of guys from
my locality and breaking their hands and legs just so that the culprit
would get the message. I naturally did not allow this.&nbsp; Then someone
told me about a Muslim gentleman who could help me. I approached him. He
told me outright that I should not suspect any human hand in this. He made
out an amulet on a piece of paper and told me to paste it in the direction
facing</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;the fall or these stones. I did so and thereafter the phenomena
ceased to take place.&nbsp; India is a landf where such</b>
<br><b>occurances are not uncommon. As this is a personal one I thought

<p><b>PATRICIA</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bongalicious@webtv.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I lived with my mom,and her fiance` Arthur</b>
<br><b>in his parents old house. Arthur had a sister</b>
<br><b>younger than him,who had died about 5 years</b>
<br><b>before his parents left the house.And we moved in pretty much after
they</b>
<br><b>moved out ,and we had just been there about a year. My room</b>
<br><b>was the one beside the one that was hers.</b>
<br><b>As you know her name was Patricia. One night</b>
<br><b>at around 12:00 irronically,I was saying goodnight to my boyfiend
on the</b>
<br><b>phone in my</b>
<br><b>room,I saw what was glowing green eyes&nbsp; on the right of&nbsp;
my bedroom</b>
<br><b>door.I was already</b>
<br><b>under the covers with the light off. I looked again and told my</b>
<br><b>boyfriend what I saw.</b>
<br><b>Then I leaned forward to see what it was,and</b>
<br><b>whatever it was backed away quickly. I was</b>
<br><b>so scared and I was on the phone this whole</b>
<br><b>time.Then I saw another translucent figure of a girl with long curly</b>
<br><b>hair,and what looked like a sheet wrappedaround her.She was coming</b>
<br><b>towards my room and past me and thru the wall.&nbsp; Thats when
I hung up and</b>
<br><b>yelled for my</b>
<br><b>mom,and then the green eyes were gone.She told me how Arthur's younger</b>
<br><b>dead sister had long curly hair and that she had come to</b>
<br><b>chase off the green-eyed demon or whatever it was. And I know now
that</b>
<br><b>it was definetely Patricia.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Playful Ghost in Dallas</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lisarose@gateway.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have enjoyed reading the stories here and would like to submit
one of my</b>
<br><b>experiences. This happened to me when I was playing drums in a band
in the</b>
<br><b>Dallas area around 1990 or so.</b>
<br><b>The band had arrived at the club early to set up. We were the only
people</b>
<br><b>there except for the woman who owned the bar. She was behind the
bar</b>
<br><b>cleaning glasses and we were on the other side of the large dance
floor</b>
<br><b>setting up our equipment.</b>
<br><b>I finished setting up my drums and walked across the dancefloor
to ask the</b>
<br><b>bar owner for a glass of water. As I stood waiting for her to finish
drying</b>
<br><b>a glass, I felt something poke me in my ribs on both sides. It was
very</b>
<br><b>distinct, but not painful and it made me jump. I began to laugh
and turned</b>
<br><b>around quickly, sure that I would find one of my band mates behind
me. No</b>
<br><b>one was there. I immediately began to look under the bar stools,
etc. to see</b>
<br><b>if one of them had tickled me and then was hiding. Still....I saw
no one. I</b>
<br><b>then looked back up to the stage and saw that all of them were still
there</b>
<br><b>setting up their gear. There is no way they would have had the time
to do</b>
<br><b>that to me and run back across the dance floor.</b>
<br><b>I must have looked a bit taken aback, because the bar owner asked
me what</b>
<br><b>was wrong. I jokingly replied, "I don't know. You don't have ghosts,
do</b>
<br><b>you?"</b>
<br><b>She stopped what she was doing and studied my face carefully, then
asked me</b>
<br><b>why. I explained to her exactly what had happened to me.</b>
<br><b>She asked me to follow her back to her office. She took a picture
out of her</b>
<br><b>desk and handed it to me.</b>
<br><b>There was the exact corner of the horseshoe shaped bar where I had
been</b>
<br><b>standing. The picture had been taken during a party at the bar.
There were</b>
<br><b>two girls sitting on barstools smiling and holding drinks...having
a great</b>
<br><b>time. But, behind them, there was a cloud-like figure standing there.
You</b>
<br><b>could clearly see a young man with a moustache standing behind them.</b>
<br><b>The bar owner told me that very often while people were standing
at that</b>
<br><b>spot in the bar, they would be pinched, tickled, or gently pushed.
I guess</b>
<br><b>this ghost still liked to frequent his favorite bar and tease the
girls!!</b>
<br><b>I know this is long already, but I must add on to this. A few days
later I</b>
<br><b>was sitting at the at home with the bass player and we were watching
TV. We</b>
<br><b>were talking about my ghostly incident and I excalimed, "oh, this
gives me</b>
<br><b>the creeps! I hope he didn't follow me home!" The instant I said
that, all</b>
<br><b>of the electricity went off. Needless to say, we were both scared
out of our</b>
<br><b>wits. When we were able to move, we hit the light switch and everything
came</b>
<br><b>back on.</b>
<br><b>I oftern think of that incident. I know that the bar no longer exsists.
But,</b>
<br><b>I often wonder what is there now and if they have any visits!</b><b></b>

<br><b>Several Ghosts in One House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: JemScout7@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I never could decide if I believed in ghosts or not, and quite honestly,
I</b>
<br><b>didn't ever want to know for sure.&nbsp; Now I have no choice but
to believe in</b>
<br><b>them.&nbsp; I had two experiences in one house that convinced me.</b>
<br><b>This house belonged to my then-fiance's parents.&nbsp; They had
two dogs who often</b>
<br><b>stared at a roll-top desk, fully alert, as if someone were talking
to them.</b>
<br><b>I didn't think much of it.&nbsp; I probably should have paid closer
attention.</b><b></b>
<p><b>My first experience happened while the owners were out of town.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>staying in the house to take care of the dogs while they were gone.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>sleeping on a futon on the living room, and was just waking up in
the</b>
<br><b>morning.&nbsp; It was already light out -- probably around 7:00
am.&nbsp; I was just</b>
<br><b>about to open my eyes when I heard a man's voice.&nbsp; I listened
for a moment,</b>
<br><b>and realized I was hearing a conversation between two men.&nbsp;
I knew I was</b>
<br><b>alone in the house, and there were no near neighbors because the
house was</b>
<br><b>one almost two acres of land.&nbsp; The voices seemed to be coming
from the</b>
<br><b>hallway near my head.&nbsp; I opened my eyes, and the voices disappeared.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>figured I was just dreaming, I closed my eyes again to get just
a few more</b>
<br><b>minutes of rest.&nbsp; The voices returned.&nbsp; I realized they
weren't talking to</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; It sounded as if they conversation had been continuing
while my eyes</b>
<br><b>were open, but I just hadn't heard it.&nbsp; I tried this opening
and closing my</b>
<br><b>eyes thing a few more times, then got pretty scared.&nbsp; I got
up, forced myself</b>
<br><b>to stay long enough to take a shower and dress, then left the house.</b>
<br><b>Interestingly, the dogs did not seem to respond to these voices
at all.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>mentioned it to my fiance's mother when they returned.&nbsp; I just
told her that</b>
<br><b>I had heard some voices having a conversation.&nbsp; She asked me
if they were</b>
<br><b>men's voices coming from the hallway, and said that she has heard
them a few</b>
<br><b>times, too.</b>
<br><b>The second incident happened in the middle of the night a few months
later.</b>
<br><b>I was walking from one of the bedrooms to the bathroom across the
hall, and</b>
<br><b>saw a light-colored female figure sitting on the couch facing me.&nbsp;
I saw this</b>
<br><b>out of the corner of my eye, so I didn't get a very close look.&nbsp;
I chose not</b>
<br><b>to look.&nbsp; I was scared enough that I didn't really want to
know for sure if I</b>
<br><b>was seeing a ghost.&nbsp; It was gone when I left the bathroom.&nbsp;
I found out later</b>
<br><b>that 3 other people staying in the house had seen her.&nbsp; One
was my</b>
<br><b>then-fiance, who had also seen her on the couch a few weeks later.&nbsp;
The other</b>
<br><b>was his mother, who had seen her reflection.&nbsp; She had been
at the kitchen</b>
<br><b>sink and saw a reflection of her walking through the living room
when she was</b>
<br><b>looking in the kitchen window.&nbsp; The third was a family friend
who was a</b>
<br><b>devout non-believer.&nbsp; He got up in the middle of the night
for a glass of</b>
<br><b>water and saw her walking across the front yard.&nbsp; She appeared
to be a</b>
<br><b>full-grown woman with blond hair, wearing a light-colored dress.</b>
<br><b>I hope you find these experiences interesting.&nbsp; This happened
about two years</b>
<br><b>ago, but I have included as much detail as I can remember.&nbsp;
It's one of those</b>
<br><b>things that you don't easily forget.&nbsp; Thanks for your interest!</b><b></b>

<p><b>Squeakers</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: madiantsr@email.msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>A few years ago, my husband Managed a pet store in Southern California.&nbsp;
At this particular pet store, there was a store "pet", which was a cat,
named Squeakers.&nbsp; After a couple of months, my husband arrived at
work one day to find that Squeakers was very ill, and he called the owners
of the pet store, who asked him to take Squeakers to the veterinarian next
door.&nbsp; He did, and sadly was told that Squeakers had some type of
incurable disease (I forget the name of the disease).&nbsp; He was told
it was a painful disease and that it could be spread to other animals,
and that Squeakers would need to be put down.&nbsp; He was pretty saddened
by it all, he'd really liked Squeakers, who was a very sweet cat that many
customers would come into the store just to say hello to.&nbsp; Before
this happened, Squeakers had a habit of running down the center rack of
dog food (you've seen the large racks of dog food in pet stores, metal,
very tall, which allows bags of dry dog food to be stored one on top of
another, nearly to the ceiling)?&nbsp; The center rack was about 4' high,
and as people would walk down the dog food aisle, Squeakers would follow,
running along the bags of dog food, the little bell on her collar softly
jingling.&nbsp; It was an unmistakeable sound.&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after
she was put to sleep, my husband called me from work and said "I just heard
squeakers."&nbsp; I'm like "What"?&nbsp; He said, I was walking down the
dog food aisle and I heard her!&nbsp; There's nobody in the store but me".&nbsp;
I thought "Yeah, right", although I've always like "spooky tales" (no pun
intended!), so I thought the story was entertaining enough.&nbsp; That
is until soon after, extra help was needed at the store, and I began going
in 2 days a week, on my husband's days off, to help out.&nbsp; As it was
a small store, and didn't get too busy too often, I was the only one there
all day.&nbsp; I hadn't given another thought to Squeakers, aside from
explaining (dishonestly) to small children who came in with their parents
to say "Hi" to Squeakers, that she'd gone to stay at one of the other store
locations.&nbsp; I'd been told to say this, as apparently, the store owners
did not want customers becoming nervous, since the disease Squeakers had
gotten, apparently could have left behind some type of contagious germs
(or something like that!).&nbsp; Anyway, one day, I was walking back to
the restroom for the hundredth time that day (I was 6 weeks pregnant, you
know how it is!), when I HEARD SQUEAKERS!!!!&nbsp; I at first thought nothing
of it,</b>
<br><b>forgetting Squeakers was gone, when it dawned on me what I was hearing
and where Squeakers REALLY was!&nbsp; It wasn't frightening at all, just
strange.&nbsp; Later, my husband told me that his boss had confided in
him that she, too, had heard Squeakers following her down the aisle.&nbsp;
He also told me of arriving at work in the morning to find merchandise
off it's hooks or shelves, in the center of aisles, when he'd been the
last one to close at night, and the first one back in the morning. Sounds
silly, but it's entirely true!</b><b></b>

<br><b>Can't Breathe</b><b></b>

<p><b>My mom told me this story one night.&nbsp; It happened a few years
ago,</b>
<br><b>when my little brother used to get up in the middle of the night
and</b>
<br><b>come into my parents' room.&nbsp; One night, my mom awoke to see
someone</b>
<br><b>standing at the side of her bed.&nbsp; Thinking it was my brother,
she</b>
<br><b>asked, "What do you want?"&nbsp; At that, whatever it was jumped
onto her</b>
<br><b>chest, and she couldn't breathe.&nbsp; She started screaming "I'll
never</b>
<br><b>do it again!" over and over until it released her.&nbsp; She doesn't
know</b>
<br><b>why she said that, or what it was that jumped on her chest.</b>
<br><b>She also told me that my dad was sleeping on the couch one night
and</b>
<br><b>woke up to see a woman standing across the room looking at him,
and</b>
<br><b>then she vanished.&nbsp; I haven't seen anything, and it has been

<br><b>Paranormal Experience?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Karen Caruso [karencaruso@earthlink.net]</b><b></b>
<p><b>This happened more than ten years ago but I can still remember it.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>was around 7 years old when we had to stop traveling for the night.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>family and I, with our cat, had been driving all day and were very</b>
<br><b>tired.&nbsp; We got the last room at a motel in Seven Springs, Pa.</b>
<br><b>We brought our bags from the car and when everyone was in, we unpacked.</b>
<br><b>Once inside, my mom was afraid of something, she got a bad, uneasy</b>
<br><b>feeling and she took a chair and leaned it up against the front
door.</b>
<br><b>My dad talked to her, but she didn't look any better.&nbsp; My dad
was in the</b>
<br><b>military and, like most dads, didn't show any fear.&nbsp; So it
seems strange</b>
<br><b>to me that his military training didn't give her any comfort.</b>
<br><b>Our cat was in the travel kennel and would not come out.&nbsp; He
crouched in</b>
<br><b>the corner of his kennel and made howling noises and cried all night.</b>
<br><b>When my mom went into the bathroom, she had seen a man in the mirror,</b>
<br><b>who wasn't my father.&nbsp; After that, she revised the sleeping</b>
<br><b>arrangements.&nbsp; My mom slept in my bed, and my younger brother
slept in</b>
<br><b>my dad's bed.</b>
<br><b>I did get a bit of sleep but something kept jumping from my bed
to my</b>
<br><b>brother's bed.&nbsp; My dad yelled at the cat to stop the jumping
but the cat</b>
<br><b>had never come out of the kennel.&nbsp; Earlier in the night, before
lights</b>
<br><b>out, my parents had shut the door to the kennel.</b>
<br><b>We checked out very early the next morning and nobody had gotten
any</b>
<br><b>real sleep.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Unusual Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: christina.thomsen@get2net.dk</b><b></b>
<p><b>I had a very unusual experience when I was 16. An experience I&acute;ve
often been</b>
<br><b>wondering about since then, but still I have no idea of what happened.
But I clearly remember every second and feeling of it. Well, in 1986, I
went to Barcelona with my family as my uncle was about to&nbsp; get married
there. We stayed in the flat of his wife&acute;s family.</b>
<br><b>One night, as I was lying in bed I had trouble falling asleep. I
had my eyes closed but there was no way I could fall</b>
<br><b>asleep. Then, all of a sudden I was gribbed by a very intense angst!
In seconds it got so severe that I couldn&acute;t</b>
<br><b>move, couldn&acute;t open my eyes -or anything. I was totally "frozen".
It was as if I was _sure_ somebody stood behind me, but I was locked! I
just could not move my head around to see if it was true. Then, what followed
was as if somebody/-or something was breathing slowly but accelerating
into my right ear. -And then, the anxiety slowly vanished, -and I could
open my eyes. Nothing was there behind me. Except for the wall.&nbsp; I&acute;ve
never experienced anything close to it since. But it was strange. And a
scarry experience.</b>
<br><b>I am still curious about what happened.</b>

<p><b>The Devil Guy</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: RIDGERUNNER2@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I'm going to tell you this story that you probably won't believe
because no</b>
<br><b>one else does. But me and my friend were there. I saw it i believe
it.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>live in a small country town called Clearbrook located in the Shenendoah</b>
<br><b>Valley of Virginia. There is a dirt road back in the country beside
my house</b>
<br><b>that leads about 5 miles out into the fields and comes to a creek.
For all</b>
<br><b>the years i and all my local friends can remember there has been
a strange</b>
<br><b>man that has 2 very strange dogs i have 2 saint bernards and they
are small</b>
<br><b>in comparison. The dogs were white always dirty and mean they both
had</b>
<br><b>different colored eyes and a red colored substance around their
mouth. Blood</b>
<br><b>who knows? As for the man he had a very old truck no license plates
no</b>
<br><b>stickers he would set there all afternoon by himself and all night.
This is</b>
<br><b>all true i have been down there as late as 3 in the morning and
as soon as i</b>
<br><b>round the turn there he is staring right at me he always just stares
never</b>
<br><b>says or does anything just him and the dogs. We spent alot of my
childhood</b>
<br><b>years ther swimming and playing. Alot of people would go there just
to drive</b>
<br><b>their 4x4's through. When i was 18 i bought a bronco and one of
my favorite</b>
<br><b>things to do was 4x4.&nbsp; After i got my bronco his sightings
increased he was</b>
<br><b>there every night 7 days a week i would round the corner and if
he was there</b>
<br><b>i would quickly turn around and leave he would stare angrily until
i was</b>
<br><b>gone. One night not long ago me and my friend were heading home
at about 2am</b>
<br><b>we decided to see if he was there. We rounded the corner in the
bronco ready</b>
<br><b>to turn around as usual and he was gone it was very quiet no crickets
no</b>
<br><b>nothing. I was starting to turn around because i felt something
i just didn't</b>
<br><b>like. But my friend kept insisting so we drove through like so many
times</b>
<br><b>before. We got to the side turned and was heading home as soon as
my front</b>
<br><b>tires touched the road it shut off the key was on and the lights
and</b>
<br><b>everything died i was pretty scared because that just dont happen
so were</b>
<br><b>there in the dark all silent miles from anyone and all the sudden
from the</b>
<br><b>other side headlights appear but no vehicle sound they pulled to
the edge of</b>
<br><b>the water and went out my friend shined the flashlight across the
creek and</b>
<br><b>there he was staring. I was terrified as soon as we turned off the
light the</b>
<br><b>whole bronco caught fire underneath and on all sides the gas tank
and all was</b>
<br><b>burning. My friend got out into the water and ran out into the road
i stayed</b>
<br><b>in trying to start it but it was dead fire was all around me. Then
it started</b>
<br><b>trying to start it was shooting fire from the exhaust i remember
looking in</b>
<br><b>the mirror and seeing his face every time the fire would light up.
Then the</b>
<br><b>headlights came back on and the truck backed up again no sound and
drove</b>
<br><b>away. As soon as he went over the hill the fire just sucked into
the bronco</b>
<br><b>it started and drove off really fast. When we came out the next
morning there</b>
<br><b>was no sign of burn marks on the car at all. Lately i have seen
strange red</b>
<br><b>lights there and when i get brave enough to go down there they are
gone he</b>
<br><b>isnt there any more but my friends say he is. I havent seen him
since and i</b>
<br><b>hope i never I don't have an explination for this but it is all

<br><b>The House On West Bel Air Avenue</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Carlnsc1@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1992 I moved into my own apartment in Aberdeen,
Maryland.The brick,</b>
<br><b>colonial style house was built in 1920, and was eventually divided
up into 4</b>
<br><b>apartments.On the 1st floor was the manager's apartment.The second
floor had</b>
<br><b>2 apartments&lt;1 being mine>, and the 3rd floor had 1.My apartment
contained a</b>
<br><b>very large living/dining room in the front part of the house with
a fireplace</b>
<br><b>and windows all along the west wall.This was the original master
bedroom, a</b>
<br><b>large bathroom with the old fashioned claw foot tub, a bedroom &lt;the
master</b>
<br><b>sitting room> in the back of the house, and a small galley kitchen
that</b>
<br><b>must've been a walk in closet at one time.There were the original
hardwood</b>
<br><b>floors, and the ceilings were 15 feet tall.The trim around the ceilings
in</b>
<br><b>all the rooms were made of plaster.The entry to the 2nd and 3rd
floors was in</b>
<br><b>the back of the house off the driveway.There was a large covered
wooden deck</b>
<br><b>that led down into the back yard, and to the side were the steps
to the</b>
<br><b>outside door of the basement which was never locked, because that's
where the</b>
<br><b>laundry room was located.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first time I went into the laundry room to
wash clothes, I got the</b>
<br><b>feeling that there was someone else down there with me, but no one
was</b>
<br><b>there.The basement was completely open to the laundry area, and
everyone kept</b>
<br><b>extra stuff stored there.All 4 walls had 3 windows in them, and
it was a</b>
<br><b>nicely sun-lit area.The next few times I went there to wash clothes,
I would</b>
<br><b>get a feeling that if I didn't leave soon, something bad was about
to</b>
<br><b>happen.After that I started driving to the laundry down the street
and paid</b>
<br><b>to have my laundry done.I never went back into the basement again.Any
time of</b>
<br><b>the day or night when I walked past the steps to the basement to</b>
<br><b>go into the house, I felt like someone was watching me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My upstairs neighbor, John, was in college
at the time, and was working</b>
<br><b>in the evenings after classes.I could hear footsteps going back
and forth</b>
<br><b>over my head for hours at a time when he wasn't home.On weekends,
he would</b>
<br><b>stay with his girlfriend and the footsteps would start anytime day
or night.I</b>
<br><b>could hear them in any room I was in, like I was being followed.I
would just</b>
<br><b>turn up my stereo or tv to drown it out.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my apartment, at times, I would feel very
uncomfortable like someone</b>
<br><b>was there with me.I would get the feeling I was being watched from
the</b>
<br><b>doorway to whatever room I was in.The bathroom was the most uncomfortable</b>
<br><b>place for me.Every time I went in there, I couldn't wait to get
out.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to paint my apartment some bright,
cheery colors to give the</b>
<br><b>place &lt;me?> a different mood.I started in the living/dining room.The
windows</b>
<br><b>had tarnished brass latches on them, so I took them off and started
cleaning</b>
<br><b>them before I painted.After cleaning them, I put them in a box on
the top</b>
<br><b>shelf of the closet.After I had painted, I went to get the latches,
but I</b>
<br><b>couldn't find them anywhere.I asked the apartment manager if he
or anyone</b>
<br><b>else was in the apartment, but he just said not that he was aware
of.I went</b>
<br><b>to the hardware store and bought replacements and put them up.After
about a</b>
<br><b>week, I came home from work and found the box of latches sitting
on the</b>
<br><b>dining room table.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to move after about 1 1/2 years.I wasn't
getting any sleep, and</b>
<br><b>I just dreaded going home.The last week I was there, I spent most
of the time</b>
<br><b>packing.I finally got finished and I went to bed after 1 am.I woke
up to the</b>
<br><b>feeling of something in the room with me.The room was pitch black
as usual,</b>
<br><b>but I could see an outline of something tall standing near the foot
of my</b>
<br><b>bed.I felt only hatred coming from it, and I knew if I turned on
the light I</b>
<br><b>would see what it was.I pinched myself silly to see if I was dreaming.I</b>
<br><b>started praying to God to protect me.At that moment, about 8 feet
away a very</b>
<br><b>warm-feeling glow appeared in the shape of a woman.The glow came
to the side</b>
<br><b>of my bed and sat down.I felt very safe.The form took my hand and
I watched</b>
<br><b>the dark shadow sink into the floor.The feeling of hatred was replaced
with a</b>
<br><b>feeling of peacefulness.I went to sleep with the glowing form still

<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While living there, I didn't ask questions about

<br><b>just afraid to find out what the history was like.After moving out,

to the</b>
<br><b>original owner of the house.The man had hung himself in the master

<br><b>&lt;my bathroom> after his wife and children left him.Apparently

<p><b>The Myrtles, St. Francisville, Louisiana</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>By: CarolMcCoggins@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>During one of our frequent trips to New Orleans, my husband and I
decided to</b>
<br><b>stay in one of plantations in St. Francisville.&nbsp; I love that
little town with</b>
<br><b>its beautiful old homes and incredible antique shops.&nbsp; We chose
"the Myrtles"</b>
<br><b>because I remembered it from my childhood -- I had grown up in a
plantation</b>
<br><b>down the road called "Avondale" in Clinton, Louisiana.&nbsp; We
were actually</b>
<br><b>lucky to get a room, not having made prior reservations.&nbsp; The
Myrtles had</b>
<br><b>just had a cancellation, and in one of their premier rooms, the
Master</b>
<br><b>Bedroom on the ground floor by the staircase.</b>
<br><b>We met the other guests during dinner.&nbsp; They were giddy and
giggling.&nbsp; All 5</b>
<br><b>of the ladies were schoolteachers out for a fun weekend, and had
chosen the</b>
<br><b>Myrtles because of its haunted reputation.&nbsp; They could not
wait until 2:00</b>
<br><b>am, the witching hour, according to our host, so they could experience
the</b>
<br><b>famous ghosts of the house.&nbsp; They were staying the a bedroom
that habitually</b>
<br><b>moved furniture about.&nbsp; It was across the hall upstairs from
the room where</b>
<br><b>two children died from poisoning after eating their birthday cake
laced with</b>
<br><b>oleander leaves and prepared by the ousted house servant who had
had her ear</b>
<br><b>cut off by the master of the plantation for eavesdropping and then
who hanged</b>
<br><b>herself.&nbsp; The ghosts stories in this house are amazing, well-documented
and</b>
<br><b>frequent.</b>
<br><b>The week before our stay, the owner of the house had put it on the
market for</b>
<br><b>sale.&nbsp; He had then endured several attacks, one where the top
of his</b>
<br><b>Victorian bed headboard lifted off and dropped on the pillows where
his head</b>
<br><b>had been.&nbsp; The spirits at the Myrtles are particular about
the house's</b>
<br><b>caretakers.</b>
<br><b>The maintenance crew there turn off running faucets every day in
unoccupied</b>
<br><b>rooms.&nbsp; They will not work alone on the grounds, and most of
them will not</b>
<br><b>remain after dark, ever.</b>
<br><b>My husband and I went to bed around 10:00 pm.&nbsp; The house has
no central air,</b>
<br><b>and the room was stifling hot.&nbsp; We lay flat on our backs with
no sheets or</b>
<br><b>covers over us and just tried to breath.&nbsp; I sleep in long,
very full cotton</b>
<br><b>gowns.&nbsp; I dreamed I was trying to move forward, but was being
held back by my</b>
<br><b>gown.&nbsp; I remember struggling and pushing forward until&nbsp;
I was almost sitting</b>
<br><b>upright -- and then I was pushed back hard on the bed when I awoke.&nbsp;
The bed,</b>
<br><b>an old-fashioned spring-mattress affair, was still vibrating from
the</b>
<br><b>contact, and I had the feeling on my shoulders that someone had
just pushed</b>
<br><b>me hard.&nbsp; And I was thirsty.&nbsp; My husband was still asleep,
and I woke him to</b>
<br><b>get me a glass of water because I was scared of getting up.&nbsp;
He stood up and</b>
<br><b>walked around the bed to go to the bathroom sink and said, "Why
is it so cold</b>
<br><b>in here."&nbsp; And he was right.&nbsp; Until then I didn't realize
that the</b>
<br><b>temperature in the room had dropped so severely.&nbsp; We actually
had to pull</b>
<br><b>quilts over us in the middle of June when we went to bed in a dead
sweat from</b>
<br><b>the heat.&nbsp; And one more thing.&nbsp; When my husband was getting
water, I tried to</b>
<br><b>sit up again, and again had to work myself into an upright position.&nbsp;
My long</b>
<br><b>nightgown was completely and tightly tucked up under the mattress
in a manner</b>
<br><b>that would have been impossible for me to have done.&nbsp; My husband
actually had</b>
<br><b>to help pull and pull some more to get my gown untucked.</b>
<br><b>The next morning our host asked if anything had happened.&nbsp;
The contingency of</b>
<br><b>teachers were disappointed in the lack of activity in their room
-- they</b>
<br><b>thought they had been gypped.&nbsp; I was hesitant to tell my story,
but after</b>
<br><b>recounting the events, our host casually said that this was a common</b>
<br><b>occurrence, though not often in the Master Bedroom.&nbsp; "Usually,"
she said,</b>
<br><b>"the Nurse will tuck in children in the nursery."&nbsp; That was
the first time I</b>
<br><b>had heard of that story.</b>
<br><b>My husband and I ate breakfast, took a short tour of the plantation
and heard</b>
<br><b>all about the unusual and frequent occurrences of the Mytles.&nbsp;
Then we packed</b>
<br><b>our bags and left, having been required to pay the night before
prior.</b>
<br><b>Evidently, this bed and breakfast too often has guests fleeing the
premises</b>
<br><b>in the middle of the night.</b>

<p><b>Lily-My Friend</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: abbieb_limited@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was about two years old I had a friend called Lily who no-one
could</b>
<br><b>see or hear except me.&nbsp; My mum and dad just thought I had an
over-active</b>
<br><b>imagination, but my mother has told me that she used to have to
set the</b>
<br><b>dinner table for Lily, and if ever anything got broken I always
used to tell</b>
<br><b>my mum it was Lily's fault......</b>
<br><b>......She stayed my friend for a further 2 years and as I got older
my mum</b>
<br><b>would be able to hear me chatting for hours and hours and if she
asked me</b>
<br><b>who I was chatting to I'd say "Lily of course."</b>
<br><b>When I was four, my sister was babysitting for me and it was close
to</b>
<br><b>midnight when I came rushing down the stairs in my nightgown.&nbsp;
My sister</b>
<br><b>jumped from shock especially when she saw the state I was in.&nbsp;
I was crying</b>
<br><b>hysterically and could not be consoled.&nbsp; Eventually she got
it out of me</b>
<br><b>that Lily had told me she had to leave and I wouldn't be seeing
her for a</b>
<br><b>while.</b>
<br><b>Naturally my sister was petrified, she couldn't understand what
was going</b>
<br><b>on.&nbsp; From that day onwards I never brought Lily's name up again.</b>
<br><b>Throughout the years my parents often asked me about Lily, but I
had no</b>
<br><b>recollection of her, all I knew, was I had been friendly with this
imaginary</b>
<br><b>person and then one day she had gone away.</b>
<br><b>When I was nineteen I went to see a clairvoyant for the first time.&nbsp;
I had</b>
<br><b>actually gone because my grandma had recently died and I wanted
to make some</b>
<br><b>contact.&nbsp; This clairvoyant was chatting away when all of a
sudden she said</b>
<br><b>"I have someone with me who is extremely keen to talk to you - she's
a</b>
<br><b>friend of yours and says you know her well - her name is Lily."</b>
<br><b>All the hairs stood up on the back of my neck!&nbsp; I could not
believe my ears.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I asked her who Lily was and after having her own conversation
with the</b>
<br><b>spirit world the clairvoyant told me Lily had died in a freak accident
at 13</b>
<br><b>and had been my guardian angel when I was a little girl, but she
wanted me</b>
<br><b>to know she was always watching me to make sure I am okay.&nbsp;
She explained</b>
<br><b>that when I was four - I was old enough to understand that it was
time for</b>
<br><b>Lily to move on and that's what she had been explaining the night
my sister</b>
<br><b>babysat for me.</b>
<br><b>I was in tears and couldn't wait to tell my parents.&nbsp; Lily
was REAL!</b>
<br><b>I hope this is of interest to you.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Young Girl</b>
<br><b>By: g_squish@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>One night when I was 12, I had a bunk bed and I leaned over the end
of it</b>
<br><b>to switch off the light. As I was leaning over I got this wierd
feeling. I</b>
<br><b>looked down and there was a little girl there. She had dark hair
and eyes,</b>
<br><b>and was dressed in a white dress, which was old fashioned. Her hair
was</b>
<br><b>past her shoulders and hung loosely. After a second or two, she
kind of</b>
<br><b>flattened, and got sucked under the bed. When I say sucked I mean
kind of</b>
<br><b>like in Jumanji when that guy gets sucked into the jungle. She dissolved</b>
<br><b>and I've never seen her since. But my family has a history of ghost-seeing.</b>
<br><b>My grandpa saw his mum in the garden in her favourite spot, when
she was</b>
<br><b>dead. She smiled at him. Also, I woke up in the night and saw this
black</b>
<br><b>sillouhette of a man. He was right next to my head. I got a cold
feeling.</b>
