<b>White Light Works</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LASSIE@xtra.co.nz</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Larissa and Ive got a story to share with you.</b>
<br><b>It might not be exciting to some but it was pretty freaky to me.</b>
<br><b>About 5 years ago, I was getting to understand spiritulism, and
how things worked. I loved it all, meeting mediums, understanding life
after death, guides, lost souls you name it, I lapped it up.....after all
it just made sense.</b>
<br><b>However I could not get my head around, that if I asked for whitelight
to protect me it would. Surely I would have to do more than This worried
me for weeks as I was beginning to progress through meditations and lots
of interesting things were starting to happen. Then one night, I dreamt
I was sitting on a grassy bank and behind me, a poker game was in progress.
There were three men and the fourth I can only describe as being a pure
evil entity, and it was beackoning me to go to it. I was terrified but
even though it was only a dream I knew what to do, so I called for white
light and the thing vanished. The next morning I woke and thought "my guides
had shown me that the power of whitelight works so just go with it"&nbsp;
Cool. Now this is where things get weird.............................Late
one night.....</b>
<br><b>I was pretty tired and excused my self to bed whilst my husband
stayed up to watch cricket on t.v.</b>
<br><b>I got into bed, layed down and looked at the time 11.02pm closed
my eyes and fell asleep.............the next thing I know is a rushing
sinking sensation, not unlike when someone is falling in a dream except
my eyes are open and I cant move a muscle, the only thing I can move is
my eyes,&nbsp; I tried to scream out to my husband but not even my mouth
could move, everything was in slow motion. At this stage I looked up at
the roof and saw a black shadow, that was blacker than black, darker than
pitch, move across my ceiling&nbsp; as though it was blood dripping down
a wall.&nbsp; I could sense evil all around me and the room suddenly felt
cold.........something had&nbsp; decided that it was gonna try me on, only
thing it didnt count on me getting angry, so in my head I shouted "LORD
SEND ME WHITE LIGHT AND SEND IT NOW!!!!!!"&nbsp; With that it halted and
shot back from where it came, suddenly I could move and</b>
<br><b>called out to my husband who came running. It was then I looked
at the time...........11.05pm. He asked what was wrong and because he doesnt
like this kind of stuff I told him I had had a bad dream.........</b>
<br><b>The things that freaked me were, the time frame especially since
I thought I had been asleep for hours, the shadow itself, it was truly
nasty but rest assured I got rid of it after that, I hurled obsenities
at it and told it never to return and it didnt. Did my guides show me through
dream perhaps knowing I would encounter this entity or was this its second
attempt who knows,&nbsp; But I can assure everyone.......protect yourself
in whitelight and love...It really does work.</b><b></b>

<p><b>What Was That?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Amanda.Terwey@usa.alcatel.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This may be nothing, but it was quite unusual. My Godmother, whom
I was</b>
<br><b>rather close to, died about 3 or 4 years ago. I don't know how long</b>
<br><b>after her death it was, but I was watching a talk show in my parent's</b>
<br><b>bedroom. It was one of the more reputable talk shows. It was a sunny
day</b>
<br><b>out, so I didn't have the overhead light or any other lamps or lights</b>
<br><b>on. And strangely enough, the guest was John Edwards, the guy who
talks</b>
<br><b>to ghosts. I was watching, and all of the sudden, the overhead light</b>
<br><b>flashed on. And it was just the one. No others came on. It didn't
strike</b>
<br><b>me as unusual the first time. I mean, who hasn't had their lights</b>
<br><b>flicker and such? It's a common occurrence. Even if it isn't storming</b>
<br><b>out. Power surges are a fact of life.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, while watching the show I started thinking about my recently</b>
<br><b>deceased Godmother and wondering if she was watching over me. That's</b>
<br><b>when the light flashed on and off. I didn't think much of it, till</b>
<br><b>closer to the end of the show when it happened again. It was the
exact</b>
<br><b>same thing. Just the overhead light and no others. I stared up at
the</b>
<br><b>light in anticipation. But nothing else happened. I've never had
any</b>
<br><b>kind of supernatural experiences before, so this could've been pure</b>
<br><b>coincidence. Or was my Godmother trying to send me a message from
beyond</b>
<br><b>to let me know that she knew I was thinking about her? I don't know,
but</b>
<br><b>I do believe in angels and I wouldn't be at all surprised if she
were</b>
<br><b>watching over me. :)</b>

<br><b>Still OUR Home</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: axlow@juno.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This is a true story about my house.</b>
<br><b>We live in West Virginia.Where nothing to dramatic ever happens,but
one cold morning in</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;1988-89 I &amp; my mother were up&nbsp; because I had school
that day.</b>
<br><b>It was about 5:15 a.m. and we were setting in the living room getting
everything</b>
<br><b>ready to go .My mom was standing by the woodburning stove and I
was setting</b>
<br><b>on the couch not 5 feet from her when all the sudden the stove glove
that we</b>
<br><b>used to open the stovedoor just lifted up off of the pile of firewood
that was stacked there</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;beside the stove and IN ALL HONESTY just lifted up off</b>
<br><b>the woodpile and slowly I mean soo slowly just floated up the wall
and knocked off a wicker decoration</b>
<br><b>plate down into the firewood pile then the glove just fell</b>
<br><b>right back down where it came from faster than you could blink.</b>
<br><b>And I know this sounds so utterly unbelievable but I will never
again doubt that</b>
<br><b>there are things walking this earth other than what you can see
with your eyes...</b>
<br><b>I asked my mom if she just had saw what happened and she said yes.
And</b>
<br><b>believe me you cannot get my mom to agree to anything that isn't
real.I'm so</b>
<br><b>glad that she was there with me at that moment because I knew noone</b>
<br><b>would believe me and now that she agree's with me that she also
saw the</b>
<br><b>glove moving the rest of my family is more willing to believe me.</b>
<br><b>But I haven't ever seen anything there since and it's still our
home.</b>
<br><b>I haven't got words for what I seen those many years ago and I cannot</b>
<br><b>explain who or what it was just that My eyes have seen something
that</b>
<br><b>few will ever experience..</b>

of it, just that i</b>
<br><b>must have been daydreaming or something.&nbsp; but then i feel a
strange feeling,</b>
<br><b>my room gets cold and i feel someones presence around.&nbsp; then
i look down at</b>
<br><b>my dog and hes staring at the corner of my room, then he started
growling and</b>
<br><b>then whimpering.&nbsp; i look into the wall and i dont see anyhitng,
but i feel</b>
<br><b>like the man i had been tlaking to was standing there watching me.&nbsp;
then i</b>
<br><b>feel as if i moved form there.&nbsp; i looked around my room searching

<br><b>thought it could be.&nbsp; somehow i instantly knew what to do.&nbsp;
i shut my eyes</b>
<br><b>and somehow i found where the spirit was standing. thne it moved

<p><b>The Whispering Ghost</b><b></b>

<p><b>When I was a senior at Hope College, I had an</b>
<br><b>on-campus apartment with a girl who had gotten an NEH</b>
<br><b>grant to translate Latin over the summer.&nbsp; She lived</b>
<br><b>in the apartment all summer, and I moved in in late</b>
<br><b>August.&nbsp; I guess I'd been there a couple of months</b>
<br><b>when I had my only experience with our resident</b>
<br><b>"ghost."&nbsp; My roommate wasn't home, and I was just</b>
<br><b>falling asleep - you know, while you're still aware</b>
<br><b>that you're falling asleep, but everything else has</b>
<br><b>faded away - when I heard a sigh just above my ear and</b>
<br><b>FELT a warm breath on my cheek.&nbsp; I sat up and, fueled</b>
<br><b>by my lifelong interest in and compassion for ghosts,</b>
<br><b>I said, "What?&nbsp; Do you need help?"&nbsp; Nothing happened.</b>
<br><b>I went back to sleep.&nbsp; In the morning, I told my</b>
<br><b>roommate about it, and she was REALLY freaked out.</b>
<br><b>She said that she had been having the same thing</b>
<br><b>happen all summer, only that it said her name instead</b>
<br><b>of sighing.&nbsp; I think it happened to her a couple more</b>
<br><b>times, but I never heard the ghost again. I think it</b>
<br><b>just got a kick out of freaking her out.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Corner</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: desertsands@onetel.net.uk</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was a baby there was a area of the living room i would always
stare at fascinated. My mother said I would</b>
<br><b>laugh and chuckle and continusly smile in the corner but there was
nothing there to see.&nbsp; My mother said she could</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;see my eyes following something around the room and the look
on my face was of utter pleasure and delight.&nbsp; She said&nbsp; I appeared
totally relaxed and still believes to this day it was my great grandmother
looking down on me.&nbsp; It stopped&nbsp; soon after my 2nd birthday.
I am now 15 years old. The funny thing was that it was as if something
was entertaining&nbsp; me and protecting me and it definite wasn't the
average babies eyes wandering technique (I have it taped on camera.)</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember i was making dinner, and i heard a
weird sound coming from my hall way by my kitchen. So, i put down the spoon
i was stiring with ON THE HANDLE OF THE POT, and went to go see what the
noise was. It was nothing. So when i came back, the spoon was sitting on
the counter, BESIDE the pot. I thought "what the hell?!" when i turned
around, i saw a lady with blonde curls and a white gown on with a white
see-through, long-sleeved dress on over top of that. She just kind of whisped
away, and i never saw her again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few nights before that, i had smelt roses in
that same spot where she appeared. The smell was so strong, but we did
not have any roses in the house at the time. And since then, every once
in a while, i would hear a lady scream my name at the top of her lungs
and i would come running to see what is wrong, but my parents say that
they did not say or hear any thing.</b>

<p><b>New Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cuddle173@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hi. My name is Sunny. I live in Flagstaff, AZ. My</b>
<br><b>story is about my experience with a new ghost that</b>
<br><b>lives at the Monte Vista Hotel. I don't know if any</b>
<br><b>one else have seen this ghost but she is pretty new.</b>
<br><b>The people who work at Monte Vista Hotel didn't even</b>
<br><b>know about her, or so they said when I talked to them.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Well, one night me and a friend, I'm not going to</b>
<br><b>mention her name, were walking around downtown.&nbsp; Now</b>
<br><b>her brother was with us so we weren't to scared about</b>
<br><b>being attacked. Now we were in front of the Monte</b>
<br><b>Vista Hotel, when I noticed my shoe was untied. So I</b>
<br><b>bent down to tie it.&nbsp; When I looked up, my friends</b>
<br><b>were about 5 or 6 feet away.&nbsp; I called out to them and</b>
<br><b>they stopped after a few minutes of wondering what I</b>
<br><b>was saying.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I then went back to tieing my shoe. When I stood back</b>
<br><b>up, there was a young girl.&nbsp; She couldn't have been</b>
<br><b>more than 17. Her dress was an old dress. Like it was</b>
<br><b>from when Flagstaff was just getting started. Simple,</b>
<br><b>yet beautiful.&nbsp; It had a button up front, which went</b>
<br><b>all the way up to her chin. And the bodice it self was</b>
<br><b>layered, with lace on the edges. Her hair was a</b>
<br><b>tangled mass, and covered in something like molasses.</b>
<br><b>And when she looked at me, she had a look of sadness.</b>
<br><b>I also got a feeling that I knew her some how. I could</b>
<br><b>have sworn she had blood on her face.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Well, I'll never know if she did. Because, just as I</b>
<br><b>was really starting to get a good look at her, she</b>
<br><b>disappeared. Not like she was there one minute, and</b>
<br><b>gone the next.&nbsp; It was more like a wind came and</b>
<br><b>slowly blew her away like sand.&nbsp; It was seriously</b>
<br><b>creepy.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I hope you like my story.&nbsp; enjoy.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Spirits of the School House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: gowland@mc.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am 13 1/2 right now, and I still sense an presence in my house,
but not as often as when I was younger. I know my house was an old school
house in the late 1800's to early 1900's. My sister and I used to see a
little girl walking through the house. None of us ever knew who she was
and we didn't know if it was a ghost. My mom later found a picture of one
of the first classes at the school house. When My sister looked, she gaspeed
and showed me. She pointed a t a little girl at the side. That was the
same girl we saw.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another thing I know about my house was
about a crazy woman with a butcher knife ran away on a killing spree. She
ran to the school yard in an attempt to kill some of the children. Before
she could do any harm, she was caught and sent to an insane asylem. A little
sooner tha school closed down. When I was about six years old, I could
not sleep (note:this is not a dream because I didn't sleep this night)
because I heard footsteps from the basement. I tried not to think about
it, but soon, the doorknob turned, and the door opened wide open. I said
hello, but no oe answered. I tried to ignore it, but I shouldv'e known
better to shut the door. It was getting cold, and I looked and there was
a white lady holding a butcher knife at the foot of my bed. I screamed,
and she disappeared in thin air. I still think my house may be haunted
because I still hear and see things. It all started to fade away, but after
my dad died, I can sense his presence following us. My friends say that
they can see my dad sometimes when they pass by my house. Today, I woke
up with two cuts on my neck, wondering if it was that woman with the butcher
knife. Anyways, I try to study what these spirits are doing here, but all
I can do is accept their company.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to tell me what you think about
these happenings, or your theries, you can email me at Molo333@go.com .
Thank you.</b>

<br><b>Gentle Spirit</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: nrburn@isgroup.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>The ghost at our house seems to be a gentle spirit. Never really
shocking or scaring anyone. It has to be very still and quiet. The ghost
is so casual about his presence. He( We think that it is a he ) can be
heard walking&nbsp; about the house in a slow wondering way as though he
was just taking in the scenery. This happens whenever we bring in something
new, a cabinet, a bed or move furniture. In my family every generation&nbsp;
has a member that can see ghosts. I was not the one in my generation. That
was supposed to be my younger brother. As for as seeing a ghost I have
never seen one, yet I feel they do exist. It is sort of like, you know
they are there but it has never been a big thing. I for one do not believe
that you have to add a personality to the spirit to make it more real.
I try not to ponder too much on who or what the spirit is. He has never
bothered us and he is accepted as part of the household. Friends that spend
the night have also heard the slow and ambling foot steps.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Haunted Shelter</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: CFuller250@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I have worked for a domestic violence shelter for approximately
seven years.</b>
<br><b>While I personally have never seen anything, there are always odd
sounds and</b>
<br><b>unusual occurrences. Let me start at the beginning. The house is
two-story</b>
<br><b>with an attic and a basement and over 100 years old. I really don't
know much</b>
<br><b>else about its history. The local domestic violence center purchased
the</b>
<br><b>building, which had been uninhabited for a number of years, did
some renovations, and</b>
<br><b>began operating an anonymous shelter for battered women and their
children.</b>
<br><b>Over the years, there have been numerous sightings of a young couple.
A woman</b>
<br><b>in a long, flowing dress can be seen periodically walking up the
long</b>
<br><b>staircase. A man in dark, old-fashioned clothing has been seen in
the living room and at</b>
<br><b>the top of the stairs outside the attic door. It is usual for all
who into</b>
<br><b>the attic or the basement to feel uneasy and "not alone". Recently,
the sightings</b>
<br><b>seem to have increased. A church group came over the holidays to
sing</b>
<br><b>Christmas carols to the residents and a young boy pointed to the
ceiling</b>
<br><b>and said, "Look, there's an angel." The only thing seen by others
in the</b>
<br><b>room was a hazy, grayish fog that wasn't in any particular shape.
A few</b>
<br><b>months later, one of the employee's daughter was in the living room
alone</b>
<br><b>working on a school project and looked up to see a gray, transparent
figure</b>
<br><b>looming in the doorway. She screamed and her mother raced in to
see the</b>
<br><b>figure moving slowly upstairs. It was as if the ghost was just checking
in</b>
<br><b>and didn't mean to frighten the young girl.</b>
<br><b>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this haunting is that the
couple</b>
<br><b>together (fitting the same descriptions of the man and woman seen
in other</b>
<br><b>places of the house) have been seen in one bedroom upstairs. To
my</b>
<br><b>knowledge, at least three residents in the last year have been awakened</b>
<br><b>at night to see the woman sitting on the edge of the bed with the
man</b>
<br><b>standing behind her. The couple has been described as comforting
and</b>
<br><b>reassuring to those who have seen them in this manner. These apparitions</b>
<br><b>have seemed to know when these residents were about to face a particular</b>
<br><b>trying experience: one woman was going to court the next day for
an order</b>
<br><b>of protection, one lady was facing a decision about the custody
of her new</b>
<br><b>little baby, and one woman was about to embark on the dangerous</b>
<br><b>underground trying to change her identity in order to hide from
the husband</b>
<br><b>who tried to kill her. All three of these women felt as though the
ghosts</b>
<br><b>were trying to tell them that everything was going to be all right
and, as</b>
<br><b>it turns out, the dire situations facing each of these women worked
out in</b>
<br><b>their favor.</b>
<br><b>I, personally, find their presence reassuring as well. The women
and</b>
<br><b>children who come through this shelter are very often depressed,
sometimes</b>
<br><b>hopeless, scared, insecure, and anxious. I think that the fact that
they are</b>
<br><b>comforted by these spirits is a sign that these are good spirits
who seem</b>
<br><b>to approve of the work being done in their house. They have never
tried to</b>
<br><b>scare anyone. Sure, lights often turn on and off by themselves and
the</b>
<br><b>dishwasher is forever turning on by itself. Maybe they are just
trying to</b>
<br><b>figure</b>
<br><b>out what these gadgets are. I do not know anything about the history
of</b>

<p><b>The Ghost of the Green Glass Building</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: seymourbirkoff@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have a few family stories to submit, but I will send those later.</b>
<br><b>After reading some of the other stories, this evening I am reminded
of a</b>
<br><b>legendary haunting from when I was at Naval Training Command (NTC)
Great</b>
<br><b>Lakes, IL. I am almost surprised that no one has written in about
this yet,</b>
<br><b>seeing as how it was quite a popular story on base.</b>
<br><b>Throughout the base there are several buildings set aside for Rating</b>
<br><b>Training. Of these buildings several tend to stick out a little-one
building</b>
<br><b>in particular is rather large and made of green glass and is used
to train</b>
<br><b>Gunner's Mates. The idea of training someone with a missile weapon
inside a</b>
<br><b>glass building was one of the more popular jokes on base, but it's
been used</b>
<br><b>for that purpose for at least half a century I think.</b>
<br><b>The story is that late at night someone will be working on one of
the</b>
<br><b>mounts, troubleshooting or working on some kind of maintenance.
The</b>
<br><b>technician runs into a rather difficult spot and finds that he can't
get</b>
<br><b>past whatever step he is on. Heavily engrossed in his work, he barely</b>
<br><b>notices the chief (E-7) standing behind him until the man offers
a few</b>
<br><b>pieces of advice.</b>
<br><b>The technician instantly finds that whatever the chief suggested
was exactly</b>
<br><b>what he needed to get through the task and turns to thank him. Only.
. . he</b>
<br><b>finds that he is totally alone-and there are no exits close enough
for</b>
<br><b>someone to run to in those few seconds. Upon further reflection
of what he'd</b>
<br><b>seen in peripheral vision, he starts to realize that the chief had
actually</b>
<br><b>been wearing an older uniform that hadn't been issued for a good
20 years or</b>
<br><b>so.</b>
<br><b>Apparently, some time ago, there had been a training accident in
that</b>
<br><b>building. Actually, I believe there have been several, but the one
in</b>
<br><b>question had taken a life. Someone had been working on one of the
mounts and</b>
<br><b>had fired off a dummy round into the building, killing the instructor
that</b>
<br><b>it hit. The popular belief on base, and amongst those who had worked
in the</b>
<br><b>building, is that the deceased instructor still wanders the building,</b>
<br><b>offering assistance to fellow technicians.</b><b></b>

<br><b>A Haunted House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: CFuller250@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Several years ago, I helped some friends move into a house in Kingstree,
SC. I</b>
<br><b>think we knew from the beginning that there was something strange
about this</b>
<br><b>house even though we never heard any stories or anything. It was
a large two-</b>
<br><b>story house in the middle of town, one bedroom downstairs with an
adjoining</b>
<br><b>bath, a screened porch in the back which opened into the house right
outside</b>
<br><b>the basement door, a kitchen, dining room, and living room completes
down-</b>
<br><b>stairs. The large staircase leads to two large bedrooms with walk-in
closets</b>
<br><b>and a bathroom in between the rooms. Several families had lived
there</b>
<br><b>previously, but none for very long and we never have found out why.
However,</b>
<br><b>the experiences of my friends may lead to an educated guess about
the</b>
<br><b>reason.</b>
<br><b>Thins started happening almost immediately. Things would get knocked</b>
<br><b>over in the kitchen. Doors would open and close by themselves. You</b>
<br><b>could hear someone walking around upstairs when you KNEW everyone</b>
<br><b>was downstairs. The basement door, which my friends kept locked
at all times,</b>
<br><b>would unlock and open by itself. The basement was rather small but
the</b>
<br><b>stiarway leading down to it always reminded me of the Amityville
Horror</b>
<br><b>basement, which is scary enough. There was always a strange, foul
odor</b>
<br><b>in the downstairs bedroom closet and bathroom...it was a constant
odor,</b>
<br><b>you only smelled it when you were alone and all of the sudden felt
like</b>
<br><b>you weren't alone so that the hair stood up on the back of your
neck. In</b>
<br><b>the bathroom dowstairs, I always felt like I was going to see something
or</b>
<br><b>someone standing behind me when I looked in the mirror.</b>
<br><b>My friends, the family living there, was composed of a mother and
four</b>
<br><b>daughters aged 22 to 16. There were no young children or pets in
the</b>
<br><b>house. The girls would often hear someone in another room, assume
it</b>
<br><b>was another family member since they heard footsteps, doors opening,</b>
<br><b>and sometimes humming or whistling, only to find themselves talking</b>
<br><b>to air...alone. Two incidents stand out in my mind when I think
about</b>
<br><b>the four years my friends lived in this house. One night, the youngest</b>
<br><b>girl and a friend were home alone. They were in the living room
with the</b>
<br><b>TV on talking about their night out. They heard the basement door
unlock</b>
<br><b>and open. Then they heard some items in the kitchen fall into the
sink.</b>
<br><b>Then the channels on the TV started changing by themselves. There</b>
<br><b>was no remote control to the TV and the channels were not changing
in</b>
<br><b>numerical order...they were changing by odd numbers very quickly...3,
5,</b>
<br><b>7, etc. Well, my friends left immediately. They ran out the front
door,</b>
<br><b>jumped in the car, and drove directly over to my house. They were</b>
<br><b>shaking and too scared to go back until daylight. When we returned,</b>
<br><b>all the lights and the television were off. There was no sign of
the things</b>
<br><b>that had fallen in the kitchen; everything was where it should have
been.</b>
<br><b>The basement door was shut and locked.</b>
<br><b>The other incident occurred about a year later. I had been out with
my</b>
<br><b>friends and we had had a couple of beers. There was a house full
of</b>
<br><b>people that night so I ended up sleeping in the downstairs bedroom,</b>
<br><b>where there was a bed but no one usually slept there. I guess, my
mind</b>
<br><b>wasn't on the ghostly experiences that evening. Sometime during
the</b>
<br><b>night, I reached over for my glass of water on the nightstand and</b>
<br><b>something grabbed my wrist and tried to pull me under the bed. I</b>
<br><b>remember fighting and pulling back determined not to go under the</b>
<br><b>bed. Finally, I fell back against the bed out of breath. I laid
there for</b>
<br><b>what seemed an eternity before I stood up in the bed, jumped as
far</b>
<br><b>as I could toward the door, and woke up my friends to explain what</b>
<br><b>had happened. Together, we investigated the downstairs bedroom and</b>
<br><b>found nothing...except my spilled glass of water on the floor. I
swore</b>
<br><b>that I would never set foot in that house again after dark and I
would</b>
<br><b>never spend the night in that house and I never did.</b>
<br><b>Shortly after that experience, one of my friends told me that they
had</b>
<br><b>searched for some answers and found out that an elderly man had</b>
<br><b>died of a heart attack in that downstairs bedroom. According to
the</b>
<br><b>town stories (an advantage of being in a small town), this man had</b>
<br><b>been a judge and was not very well-liked...in fact, he was described</b>
<br><b>as mean and many townfolk were glad when he was gone. I guess,</b>
<br><b>he wasn't really gone and death did not change his disposition.
All</b>
<br><b>I know for sure is that I will never be going back to that house
again.</b><b></b>

<br><b>One Year Anniversary Reminder</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One Sunday I went to my

<br><b>Preppy Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: claire766@home.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My daughter and I were living in England at the time. That has to
be one of the most haunted places to be. We lived in a converted stable
on the grounds of Clermont Hall. The house was L shaped and the bedrooms
and bathroom were in one wing and the rest of the house was in the other.
I'm not sure how old the house was but I would guess about 250 years. That
is not so old for England as they tend to preserve rather than tear places
down. Anyway, we were watching TV in the living room and my daughter was
sitting on the couch so she could see down the hallway to the bedrooms
and bathrooms. I always slept on the couch because I did not like the feeling
I had in my room. She looked down and said, "Mom, I see a man standing
down by your room." I got chills and asked her what he looked like. She
said he was wearing khaki slacks and a button down shirt and had his hair
tied back. She said he was just standing there with his arms crossed and
she didn't feel scared. When I got up to look she said he disappeared.
She also would hear murmering from the kitchen, like people were talking
but she couldn't hear what they were saying. It was two women and a man.
I never felt bad there, just uncomfortable, and I was glad when we moved.
I am very interested in the paranormal and wanted to see what she saw but
I never did. I am still hoping to see something one day and I continue
to watch and read anything I can having to do with the paranormal.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Big Snow of "73"</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: TimandTam21@email.msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>In Orangeburg, SC, we had what was called "the big snow of '73".&nbsp;
This small South Carolina town had three feet of snow.&nbsp; At the time
I was nine years old.</b>
<br><b>In addition to the front door, our living room had a side door leading
to an open porch.&nbsp; The door was never used, and was blocked off by
furniture on the inside.&nbsp; In the middle of the snowstorm, we heard
a loud pounding on the blocked side door.&nbsp; My father opened the front
door and called out to the visitor to come around to the front.&nbsp; The
visitor was a young man who stated his father was on the roadway dying
of a heart attack.&nbsp; My father and a neighbor went to assist.&nbsp;
The man and his father had become stranded on the road, and were making
their way through the snow looking for assistance, when the father had
his heart attack.&nbsp; He died on the roadway in front of our house that
day.</b>
<br><b>The following spring, my cousin and I had been playing in the neighborhood
and returned home to find the house locked and my parents away buying groceries.&nbsp;
My cousin and I sat in some chairs on the side porch to wait for their
return.</b>
<br><b>Suddenly, we both heard a loud pounding on the side door.&nbsp;
The sound was so loud we both leaped off the porch and fled screaming out
of the yard.&nbsp; To me, it sounded just like the pounding I had heard
during the snowstorm.&nbsp; I know no one was home, and I cannot explain
who or what was knocking on that side door.</b>

<p><b>Some of My Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Yevette</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>My husband ( refered to in this story as M) and I have had some odd
things happen over the years. Here are some of those happenings.</b>
<br><b>PARENTS PLACE</b>
<br><b>When I was in my early teens things would end up in strange places
in my room. I would leave the room briefly and come back to see awards
that were on my desk now lying in a row on my bed on the other side of
the room. This happened with many objects. Once I saw the antique bottles
on the shelf above my desk jump off the shelf one at a time and land unbroken
on the floor. Each one came off and joined the line on the floor.</b>
<br><b>These kind of things happened in other rooms in the house but as
my room was the most neat and tidy these things were more noticeable. This
was the only time I actually saw anything move in front of me. My brother
had a seance and the glass flew into the air and shattered. I was not there
at the time.</b>
<br><b>This kind of thing stopped happening after a couple of years.</b>
<br><b>LADY AND THE BOOK</b>
<br><b>M shared a house with a number of other uni students. It was a huge
house, about 100 years old. Ms bedroom was huge. The room was devided by
bookshelves. Everytime the door opened the string of bells attached to
the handle would ring.</b>
<br><b>One night M was reading in bed when the door to his room opened.
The bells did not ring. A young (15-25) woman walked into the room and
without looking at M she walked behind the book shelf. M threw the book
he was reading over the bookshelf. The book came flying back over the shelf.</b>
<br><b>In the morning when he got up the nerve to look behind the shelf
there was no one there. But all the pictures and posters on that side of
the room had been turned upsidedown.</b>
<br><b>RENTED HOUSE</b>
<br><b>We shared a house with 2 other people in a suburb of Melbourne.
This was one of the first homes built in the suburb. It had an outside
toilet ( common to this area) with a wood shed next to it. I never experienced
anything in this house, but the others were terrified of the outside toilet.
Wood would be thrown against the wall shared by the woodshed and toilet.
One huge piece was thrown so hard it imbedded itself in the wall.</b>
<br><b>PIZZA SHOP</b>
<br><b>As well as his regular job M worked in a pizza shop. The shop would
have been built about the time of the first world war, or maybe a little
after. Unlike many of the nearby shops this was a single story without
a dwelling attached.</b>
<br><b>Being a pizza shop it functioned at night.</b>
<br><b>The voices of children at play could be heard most nights. Everyone
heard it. Customers would sometimes admonish workers "Those kids should
be in bed, its well past bed time." There was no way kids could have been
in the back of the shop. The door was locked. it was early morning and
no children were nearby.</b>
<br><b>Things would often get messed up in the store room. One example
is- M put new toilet rolls away and locked the store room door behind him.
Minutes later he unlocked the door and went in. The packets had been opened,
the rolls unravelled and thrown around the room. There is no way anyone
else could have got into the room.</b>
<br><b>One night he returned from a delivery to find the new cook sitting
out the front of the shop as he didn't want to go back inside alone.</b>
<br><b>He had commented about the sounds of children playing but everyone
else in the shop was used to it so they had forgotten to warm him about
it.</b>
<br><b>When he was alone in the shop he started to walk past the pool cue
rack. One pool cue jumped out of the rack and fell in front of him. Then
another. Then another, the whole rack one at a time.</b>
<br><b>That was has first and last night at the shop.</b>
<br><b>OUR HOUSE NOW</b>
<br><b>I had recently returned from hospital after surgery and was inclined
to think what was happening was my imagination combined with pain killers.
That is until M saw it as well. M used to work nights so I went to bed
alone. Almost every night something would crawl up the bed. I could see
the quilt move as if something was under it. The shape would move up the
bed and then settle against my body. The pressure of something there would
slowly dissipate. It was about the size of my terrier, but he was asleep
with our other dog in another room.</b>
<br><b>One night M was home, watching late night TV.I was in bed and it
happened again. This time I gathered this thing up in the quilt and carried
it out to M. We could both feel a heart beat in the quilt, but when we
unfolded it there was nothing there.</b><b></b>

<br><b>OUR HOUSE</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Saturn_2001@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Greetings to you all reading this,</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am now 22 yrs old and live far away from my family back in texas.
I love in a nice apartment that only gives me most of the time positive
feelings, and I'm very comfortable here with my husband.</b>
<br><b>I used to live with my parents back in texas. My parents now have
built their own house out of city limits and reccently we went to go visit
and it seems like such a nice home.</b>
<br><b>Well, the old house located in front of a jr. high school and in
a good neighborhood is the house where we experianced some things.</b>
<br><b>Moslty it was my mom, sister and I that ever heard, saw or felt
something. My dad was always at work. OH yes and my dogs as well.</b>
<br><b>Thinking back now to when i was small like 5-9yrs old I experianced
a lot of things, but my mom always comforted me by saying it was just my
imagination and that I watched too many scary movies. I know that I was
always afraid of the middle room in that house. It was a 4 bedroom home,
and I (at first) was stuck in the middle room. I hated this room so much.
I would hear something sratching at the window, I never had the nerve to
look from under my covers to see what was making the noises. I remember
playing with my toys, usually stuffed animals...and i would line them up
according to my most favorite to least, and I would go to the kitchen,
come back, and my animals were all rearranged. I was the only child at
this time in this home myolder sister was off at school. Well, many times
I had to go sleep with my mom and dad since i was so scared. I even got
my own little mattress and would sleep on the floor, this was when i was
around 9. Of course i couldn't sleep there forever, so my parents and I
switched rooms. I got the big room and they got the middle room. Around
this time parents also started being foster parents. I remember that at
one time there were 5 kids including me in this house. I remember one of
the girls telling me that she had seen a face come out of the middle room's
wall (by this time my parents were sleeping in room #4 and 2 kids were
in the middle room). She was very scared because she said the face looked
very mean, and almost evil, so to make her feel better I put a religious
pic on that wall. I remember later in the years as I went to highschool,
we had 2 children in our home, the boy told me that often times he would
see figures moving about in the hallway and that made him very scared he
said they were like little black things but they looked like people. I
didnt know what to say, but the only thing was telling him to call for
me next time he saw them and if I wasnt home to pray for protection from
God and nothing would hurt him.</b>
<br><b>I would still experiance events even in my new room, even up to
the date I moved out. I remember a photo rising from the floor as i went
to go pick it up. I remember one time I even saw a lady at the foot of
my bed looking out of the window, funny that i thought it was my older
sister, but next morning i knew it wasnt her, also since i had my own bathroom
sometimes I would hear someone in my room but when i opened the door there
was no one there, sometimes the perfume bottles my mom and i collect would
gently be knocked over as if not to break them. That was when i started
talking to my mom about these events, probably when i was around 16. And
she told me that she had seen things...usually out of the corner of her
eye.</b>
<br><b>There were so many events in this house but there are 5 events that
i remember very well. I dont remember now in what order they occured but
in know that the one with my dog was the last event. I remember one time
that I was in the kitchen and as usual i was opening the fridge to see
what i can munch on, and the fridge is positioned in a way that you can
see the the dinning room and the hallway and the entrance to the living
room. Well as i was opening the fridge I saw something jump from the entrance
of the living room and into the hallway and go towards the rooms. I thought
i was my mom, wondering what she is doing jumping around like that, and
i called her. Well I got her answer but from the backyard..she was outside
with my dad. I didnt tell her anything about that event. Well it so happens
my mom had the same experiance, but she thought it was me jumping from
the entrance of the living room to the hallway, she called my name out
thinking i was doing something sneaky. I was outside inthe back yard when
i heard her calling me, i thought i was in trouble, when i walked in from
the back, she was stunned to see me and she told me what she had seen,
and thats when i told her that it happened to me also, seems it happened
a lot more to my mom. The next event i remember was when my mom and I were
in my room looking for some photo albums, and my sister was in the kitchen
washing the dishes. Well while we were searching we heard a huge crash
that seemed to come from kitchen. I sounded like all the pots and pans
and dishes...everything fell down. We arrived in the kitchen asking my
sister what happened, well she looked at us really puzzled and said nothing,
we told her about the crash we heard and she said she didnt hear anything.
I even opened the cabinets where the pots and pans were and they were all
in order nothing out of place. The next event involed the four of us (mom,
sis, dad and me although my dad was too into the show on tv). We were in
the living room and watching tv, by this time i was away at university
and I was home for the weekend and I liked to spend my time with my family.
Well my dad and sis were on the couch facing the tv, i was on the side
laying on the floor watching tv, and my mom was sitting on the floor in
front of the coffee table and watching tv. Well she was also blocking the
path to get to the hallway/dinning room/kitchen, so if you wanted to get
up you had to jump over my mom. Well for some reason I took my attention
from the tv show and looked at my mom, i felt a strange feeling come over
me, and my mom at that instant, sat up and got out of the pathway and looked
around wide eyed. And she said that something jumped over her and as we
looked a sort of gray smoke thingy ( dont know what to call it) was jumping
from the entrance of the living room to the hallway. My dad didnt see it,
he was too involved with the tv, but my mom was really shook up. One other
event involved Finally I remember when one of my dogs (rottwieler), Yuri,
was playing on the porch with the other dogs, and i had the screen door
closed but i was sitting in the dinning table doing some homework and my
mom in the kitchen and sis in the living room, well i was enjoying myself
wathing her be silly when she stopped playing and walked to the screen
door and looked inside the dinning room, sat down, and began to howl. It
was like she was howling at something inside the house. We got so freaked
out because she had never dont that before, and she never did that again.</b>
<br><b>Like i said there were so many things going on there. My mom once
told me of some things that happened in that house when i was a baby.</b>
<br><b>I remember when i started reading about ghosts,etc...and I was home
for the weekend I said outloud in my room, because we concluded it was
the previous owner of the house who was there, I told her (the ghost) that
she was welcomed to stay because we heard that she loved the house, but
never to harm anyone or show herself. Things got quiet after that.</b>
<br><b>I wonder now if the new owners of our home are experiancing anything.</b>

<br><b>Not Bothered</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: tuggles47@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;I started to see ghost when I was in the 5th grade. That was
like 6 years ago. Well it was the middle of the night and i got up to get
a drink. Well then I heard someone calling my name. So I got scared and
ran back to my room. The next day I asked if anyone called my name and
they said no. Then like 2 years later I was home alone with my little brother
and he wanted me to read him a story.&nbsp; All of the the doors and windows
were locked. As I was reading We heard a chair move across the floor, and
then we heard footsteps, it sounding like a mans. My little brother was
6 at the time. Then we heard the frontdoor open and close. Well at this
point we were freaked out. So we took bats and went down to see what it
was and the frontdoor was locked. And there was another time when my friend
spent the night and it was 4:30 in the morning. I woke up and looked into
the hall way and I saw a girl, I could only see the outline of her. So
I woke up my friend and I told her that there was a ghost in the hall way
and it was coming towards us. She couldnt see it. But we turned on my light
to look around and after we turned the light off she was gone. And there
was this other time when another friend sent the night and right before
she went to sleep she saw two blue and white balls of light in the hall
way. Then the night after I saw a blue and white ball of light following
me. And ever since I always feel like I'm being watched, and I'll feel
stuff sitting on my bed. It all started when I move into the house that
I live in now. But I have lived here for 7 years and i have gotten use
to it. And I still see stuff but it doesnt borther me anymore. And out
of all the people that live in my house it only happens to me.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Spirits That I have Seen</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ou81two@alltel.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, I'm really not new at this whole ghosts things. I've lived at
several places with sprits. Like now I'm living with a 72 year old man
who loves my children to death. All night long he messes with my son and
daughter things. Like for instants, my daughter has toys that plays music
or other noises if you touch them. Oh he loves things that make noise.
My sons baby monitor, he likes to change the channel on it. One time we
came home and he played a joke on my husband, He changed the time on his
alarm clock. Luckly, when he went to bed he checked his alarms first, and
they were all messed up. We like are ghost and It's kinda fun to have him
here. I'm not afraid of him but, still sometimes he might catch me of gaurd
and give me a fraight. Like seeing him out of the corner of my eye.</b>
<br><b>The one place that I will never go back to is my brothers house.
He has 2 sprits with him. And I have a sense that one is not good.The first
I'm going to tell you about is george. The reason why I know what his name
is because he was the last owner of the house and died there. The other
one that I believe that is not good is a younge boy who was treated terrible
when he was alive. I first saw george when I was babysitting my neice and
nephew. Around 9 o'clock some one kept going through the drawers and things
in the kitchen. Then you could hear him go up stairs to my nieces room
open the closet and then it all stopped. About 10 minutes later it would
start up all over again.Later on that night he made himselve really know.I
was upstairs in my nieces room sleeping in her bed, and she was on the
floor. Later on that night something just woke me up, and there stood goerge.
He was holding the handle of the door, and was like reaching for my niece,
I did'nt know what he was doing and I finally worked up enough courage
to say some thing, and he looked at me and all of a sudden he was gone.</b>
<br><b>The little boy that lives there is up in the upstairs closet. He
was locked in there because he done some thing wrong. You hear him crying
all the time. The reason why I know his story is because my mom's alittle
pyshic and she told me that he's saying, I'm sorry I did'nt mean to do
it, Please let me out, I'm hungry, it's so hot in here, I can't breath,
plese let me out.</b>
<br><b>That's the one that I don't really care for . Those are only a couple
sprits that I know of. And I'm sure they won't be the last ones.</b>

<p><b>My name is Megan. I am 13 years old. My story is very strange.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My great uncle died two years ago. My grandmother
has grieved and still is. My great uncle had a massive heart attack while
help David and Ben, his brothers, paint David's brand new house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day my grandmother went to Davids for a get-together.
She was sitting on a couch, which was the exact spot my great uncle died.
She says she felt someone put thier hands on her shoulders and whisper
"It is alright!" Then she said she could not breath and my aunt helped
her up and made her lie down on the bed. The next incident happened to
Davids wife. She was cleaning up the bathroom and knocked off an angel
figurine, about that time the dryer buzzed. She thought that she would
pick the angel up min a minute. She ran to the dryer and on the way to
the bathroom she thought she heard something she ran to the bathroom and
the angel was right back where it&nbsp; was before it fell.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a strong believer of ghosts, as young as
I am, and will be for the rest of my life.</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One year my grandma died and we were all really

I tried to</b>

I gave up</b>
<br><b>and put my blanket on the floor (frustration). I laid down without

<br><b>shivering and all of a sudden, I felt a cold, soft hand (A hand

<br><b>My Scary Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lisawest@intrstar.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>At my 13 Brithday/Slumber party me and 3 of my friends all had a
very real very true ghost encounter. It was about 3:00 in the morning and
we were sitting up talking and sundenlly we all heard the front door slam
shut and someone run thourgh the house and stop outside my bedroom door
then we heard a little girl singing and when we got up to see who it was
there was no one there and my little sister was spending the night with
a friend but the weird thing is that the front door both of them were locked
my mom was asleep and so was my brother. After that we whent back to my
room and started talking again then at 5:00 we heard 3 solid knocks on
the wall right beside my bed and it could'nt have been my mom or brother
because we would have heard them run because they both are on the very
ends of the house and my room is on the end and none of us have been able
to find out what happened. Anthore time at my camp I had the same experince
3 Nights in a row. I woke up because it all of a sudden got Cold and I
mean very cold and I looked up to see some kind of black figure standing
infront of the door it just stood there for a moment and looked around
then it sort of floated to the end of the room and and back and then it
just glied out of the door. The funny thing is that it always no matter
what it always vanhished in the middle the 3rd night I sleep with a friend
who happened to be in the middle of the cabin and I got the same cold feeling
at about the same time but this time I couldnt see it. My bed was right
near the door too but hers wasnt.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Paranormal True Experiences:</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: carlosmeen@prtc.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These experiences started in Cidra a few year
ago; continued in New York and is continuing in Juncos.These have been
brief. In Cidra the following experiences have occurred to me: a) Woke
up in the middle of the night. b)I saw a white ball over my closet. c)This
closet faced my feet stance. d)I became curious what it was',stood up,
walked&nbsp; over;and extended my right arm to feel it. e)Before I could
to, it went throught the ceiling. h) while I would sleep or rest on my
bed it would be shaken daily and violently. H) While I was watching T V
I was pushed repteatedly by my left shoulder, T) I saw a white outline
of a human figure sped past side of house, P)&nbsp; while I was laid down
on my bed, I felt waves that rolled from my head to the toes and back again
under my bed sheet, U) As a result of this waving, I could not sleep. I
did not want to reliquish my bed to an invader by moving to other place
to sleep. Tired as i was of it, i decided to drive this ghost or what ever
it was from my bed. Next time I showed this thing , I swored to my Imyself.
As&nbsp; I have schemed I laid down this wavering began-&nbsp; this time
with a new addition ,shaking- I reached for a 32 bat, stood up and began
pounding my bed all over. The ghost exited throught the wall with a loud
bang. This fight continued for a week or so. Finaly, this entity gave up
this shaking and waving thing. In fact, it did not bother me again in Cidra.
In New York, this entity reappeared. While I was bedidng down face up eyes
shut on my bed I felt feet have landed on my stomanch ,which has pushed
me into an indention in my matress. AS I&nbsp; was bounced back I did not
realized what has happened. Later ,I realized the ghost was back.... I
was not bothered again in New York. In juncos, there are three entities
that live in my house. The first one is giant black outline of a human
being.I saw him while I was meditating in my porch at night. That is, I
turned my neck toward my lit room and I saw it. I remained calm and ignored
it. I returned my head again and it was gone. The second ghost resembled
a dead uncled of mine. I encountered it after I have gone to padlock the
gate to my carpot and headed toward the main door. It met me there, looked
at me, backed up few steps, turned around and ran into my house. I was
able to see its black face wirh all the detailes to it, and it was about
5 feet and 4 inches tall. His cloths were a unbuttened shirt andf blue
jean. I did not see his hands or feet. I was shaken for first time. The
third ghost is a towel like mist.I saw it after a collopsed power left
my house in darkness, the power was restored later ;enterd my room to reset
the eletric alarm radio and looked up to the middle of my room. It just
floated for a few seconds. Somehow I departed my eyes for less that a fraction
of a second and ....it was gone. I am continuing to experience planks if
you will in this town. Like by example padlock opened, main door opened
after it was locked, pulled by my feet while sleeping, misplaced items,
disapperances of my objects to be found stached elsewhere and others. To
top this diclosing off, as I typed these stroies a strong smell of gas
invaded my nose. I traced it to my left hand. I did not kwon how it smeared
on my hand. for I did not deal wiht gas. I think these experiences are
not funny, are bothersome, and stupid.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Own Ghostly Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MARIEANG1@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I love your website.&nbsp; I have always been fascinated by&nbsp;
the</b>
<br><b>supernatural.&nbsp; Although</b>
<br><b>I have never seen a ghost,&nbsp; I have had some strange experiences
that</b>
<br><b>defy explanation.&nbsp;&nbsp; It usually&nbsp; has to do with a
family member or</b>
<br><b>someone that I was extremely close to in life.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;For instance,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My cousin, Tara, lost her brave battle with&nbsp; cancer a few</b>
<br><b>years ago, We were close in age, and she&nbsp; had&nbsp; just married
prior to</b>
<br><b>becoming sick.&nbsp;&nbsp; My sister and I have two beautiful boys
who were just</b>
<br><b>babies at this time.&nbsp; Tara longed for children, but it was
not ment to</b>
<br><b>be.&nbsp; She did say however, that&nbsp; once she got to the other
side, that she</b>
<br><b>would be guardian&nbsp; angel to our babies.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's
a promise I believe she</b>
<br><b>kept.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; A few days after the funeral, both my sister and I
, unknown to</b>
<br><b>eachother at the time, experienced&nbsp; paranormal events.</b>
<br><b>I was ironing in my son's room, when the</b>
<br><b>musical mobile started up by itself.&nbsp; It played an entire song
from</b>
<br><b>start to finish, much to the delight of my 2 year old. no one touched</b>
<br><b>it, no one was near it. As my</b>
<br><b>son grew older, he always spoke of a "lady in the corner" right
where</b>
<br><b>that mobile stood.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've had window shades fly</b>
<br><b>up, before exiting my living room.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And things at my sister's house were even
more bizzare.&nbsp;&nbsp; footsteps</b>
<br><b>heard over the baby monitor,&nbsp; wind up toys would walk across
the floor,</b>
<br><b>and&nbsp; talking bears would start chattering of their own accord.</b>
<br><b>Porch lights would turn themselves on at night, which living in
a high</b>
<br><b>crime area wasnt a bad thing.&nbsp; One night, after returning home
from</b>
<br><b>work,&nbsp; my sister noticed strangers&nbsp; loitering near her
darkened house,</b>
<br><b>suddenly, the porch lights went on, and my sister, made a mad dash
for</b>
<br><b>the front door.&nbsp; The car with the strangers&nbsp; quickly drove
off.&nbsp;&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>was about to thank her husband.&nbsp; but he wasn't at the front&nbsp;
door</b>
<br><b>waiting for&nbsp; her, he was up in their bedroom, sound asleep.&nbsp;
The lights</b>
<br><b>went off.&nbsp; and&nbsp; she whispered a thank you to what we believe
to be our</b>

<p><b>My Grandmothers Visit.</b><b></b>

<p><b>This takes place in Collingwood, Ontario in the summer of 1983, my
mother and I were visiting my grandparents which was my mothers folks.
It was in June that my grandmother had just died and I was around 20 years
of age,&nbsp; I called her Nana and one morning at around dawn I heard
the bedroom door open and heard nana say to Mom Muriel its time to get
up and I heard mom say Ill be up in a few minutes Mum well I open my
eyes and I saw her come in and then leave. So when I did get up I asked
Mom why did nana call you so early? And she said I dont know then we
realized that nana is dead, so from that time on we just dropped the subject.
But I knew that a mothers/grandmothers care will always beat the grave.&nbsp;

<p><b>My Mothers Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MFBush78@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>In the summer of 1994 my sister and I moved to Hawaii to live with
our</b>
<br><b>father.&nbsp; While we were gone our mother moved into an apartment
to save money.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Right away strange things started to happen.&nbsp; Her two
cats would never enter</b>
<br><b>the bedroom of the apartment, choosing instead to sleep in the living
room.</b>
<br><b>They would claw and bite if you tried to carry them in there and
run quickly</b>
<br><b>away.&nbsp; Mom only spent one night in the room and then opted
for the living</b>
<br><b>room as well.&nbsp; She didn't see anything but felt as if someone
was watching</b>
<br><b>her or that someone was in the room.</b>
<br><b>A few weeks later she returned home from work to find her disposable
razor</b>
<br><b>disassembled on the bathroom counter.&nbsp; Even the twin blades
were removed and</b>
<br><b>the whole apparatus was laid out in a straight row.&nbsp; The next
night my</b>
<br><b>cousin, Stacy, and her husband, Mitch, went to stay over at my Mom's
with</b>
<br><b>her.&nbsp; (They were in from out of town, not going over to ease
her fears.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>wasn't scared yet.)&nbsp; The two of them argued with Mom over sleeping</b>
<br><b>arrangements and she assured them that she never slept in the bedroom
anyway.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;That night my mother woke to hear Stacy and Mitch screaming
in terror.&nbsp; Mom</b>
<br><b>ran into the room to find Mitch trying to pull Stacy off the bed.&nbsp;
She was</b>
<br><b>screaming to get her off the bed so Mom started pulling too.&nbsp;
Once they got</b>
<br><b>her to the floor, Stacy said that it felt like someone was sitting
on top of</b>
<br><b>her and she couldn't breathe.&nbsp; And while it was all going on
she could see a</b>
<br><b>teenage boy in the corner laughing uncontrollably.&nbsp; The three
of them decided</b>
<br><b>to drive to my grandma's to spend the night.</b>
<br><b>Fast forward to Christmas break when my sister and I came home to
visit.&nbsp; Our</b>
<br><b>first afternoon at the apartment we heard a loud crash from the
bathroom.</b>
<br><b>All people and animals in the house were accounted for in the living
room, so</b>
<br><b>we went to check it out.&nbsp; Everything from the cabinet under
the sink was out</b>
<br><b>on the bathroom floor.&nbsp; It wasn't all tipped over however,
it was lined up in</b>
<br><b>a straight row.&nbsp; After that Mom told my sister and I about
all of the strange</b>
<br><b>things that had occurred.&nbsp; My sis and I were thrilled...thought
it was really</b>
<br><b>cool.&nbsp; Mom said we were more than welcome to sleep in the bedroom
if we</b>
<br><b>wanted to, so we did.&nbsp; Early the next morning I woke up and
thought I saw</b>
<br><b>someone standing in the walk in closet.&nbsp; The sun was just starting
to come up</b>
<br><b>and I thought for sure it was my sister playing a trick on me.&nbsp;
When I looked</b>
<br><b>over in bed she wasn't there.&nbsp; Instead there was a guy, maybe
teens or early</b>
<br><b>20's with shaggy black hair and no face...in bed with me.&nbsp;
He reached out for</b>
<br><b>me and I literally wet my pants running into the living room.&nbsp;
I woke my Mom</b>
<br><b>and sister (who had moved during the night, said she had the "creeps")
and</b>
<br><b>attempted to tell them what happened.&nbsp; Mom told us to get our
stuff and we</b>
<br><b>left.&nbsp; Later that afternoon I recited the story to Stacy and
she said the guy</b>
<br><b>I described was the one she saw laughing at her.</b>
<br><b>Mom went to the leasing office a week later and asked to be moved
to another</b>
<br><b>apartment.&nbsp; All the leasing agent had to say was that no one
had lived in</b>
<br><b>that apartment longer than 4 months.</b>

<br><b>Mississippi River</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Cattails40@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When I was in my early twenties a friend and I decided to rent a
house</b>
<br><b>together. We found a lovely old house near the Mississippi River
and I was</b>
<br><b>immediately drawn to it. After we moved in we both began to notice
banging on</b>
<br><b>the walls and lights blowing out constantly. The lights we attributed
to bad</b>
<br><b>wiring and the banging I truly believed was my friend and she truly
believed</b>
<br><b>it was me. The layout of the house was one we had never seen before.
There</b>
<br><b>was a hallway that led from the front living area to the back bedroom
areas</b>
<br><b>that was at an odd, slanted angle. I always felt uncomfortable going
down</b>
<br><b>this hallway and found myself going around by way of the kitchen.
After some</b>
<br><b>months my friend and I decided to take in a third roommate to help
with</b>
<br><b>expenses. During the next month or so after this third roommate
moved in we</b>
<br><b>noticed an increase in frequency to the noises, banging, and lights
going</b>
<br><b>out. We also began to notice that every month (and this is really
weird)</b>
<br><b>right around the time that all three of us began our menstrual cycles,
a very</b>
<br><b>large stain began to appear in the middle of our living room floor.
We tried</b>
<br><b>constant shampooing but it would always reappear immediately. Then
after our</b>
<br><b>cycles were finished, the stain would disappear on its own only
to reappear</b>
<br><b>the next month. Our third roommate then became very withdrawn after
only a</b>
<br><b>short time of being in the house. She began to go directly to her
bedroom and</b>
<br><b>never came out except to go to work. Her personality also changed</b>
<br><b>drastically. She went from being very funny and outgoing to a complete</b>
<br><b>loner.She would also say inappropriate, weird things to us. We had
known this</b>
<br><b>girl for some time and her behavior was quite unsettling. She finally
told us</b>
<br><b>that she was not comfortable in this house and was moving out and
she did so</b>
<br><b>that very day.</b>
<br><b>Shortly after she moved out the banging noises began in earnest
and we</b>
<br><b>started noticing our things being rearranged. We began to laughingly
(and</b>
<br><b>nervously) admit to each other that something was not right in this
house.</b>
<br><b>However, neither one of us ever felt threatened by any of the weird</b>
<br><b>happenings and in fact, I personally actually felt almost protected
by it. We</b>
<br><b>started to call our "ghost" George and would talk right to him whenever
the</b>
<br><b>banging would begin. If we were trying to watch something on tv
and George</b>
<br><b>would start banging or knocking, we would say "Please George, not
right now-</b>
<br><b>we're trying to see this". And he would actually stop! At least
until the</b>
<br><b>show was over. Unfortunately, no matter how much we begged him to
stop</b>
<br><b>putting the stain on the floor every month that never ended. In
fact, It got</b>
<br><b>bigger and darker the</b>
<br><b>longer we lived there. One kind of amusing episode happened to us
one</b>
<br><b>memorable evening. I decided to let my boyfriend at the time stay
over night</b>
<br><b>with me although I didn't usually do this. Just as we were dozing
off a very</b>
<br><b>loud bang sounded coming from the hallway. My boyfriend sat up and
asked what</b>
<br><b>the **ll was that? Immediately a knocking began at the far end of
the hall</b>
<br><b>and rushed towards my room very fast knocking louder and louder
the closer it</b>
<br><b>came. My boyfriend said "That has to be your roommate being funny."
I just</b>
<br><b>laughed and tried to explain about our ghost and that I thought
he might be</b>
<br><b>angry that I had a male friend overnight. He said that was bull
and got up to</b>
<br><b>investigate. Just as he came to the hallway the knocking began again
all</b>
<br><b>around him. Needless to say my brave 6 foot 4 inch (naked) boyfriend
ran</b>
<br><b>straight out the front door and never came back in the house.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, after a few years my roommate and I decided we were going
to move to</b>
<br><b>a cheaper apartment closer to where we worked. As soon as we started
packing</b>
<br><b>the noises and especially the lights going out began to get really
bad. I was</b>
<br><b>even starting to get a little frightened. One day as we were finishing
up</b>
<br><b>packing we decided to go check in the basement and see if we had
left</b>
<br><b>anything down there. While we were down there we decided to go in
the old</b>
<br><b>fruit cellar since neither one of us had actually looked in it.
We found some</b>
<br><b>old fishing equipment and an old frog gigger. We also found an old
shirt box</b>
<br><b>that was sealed with tape and felt kind of heavy. So we brought
it upstairs</b>
<br><b>and opened it up. Inside was a bunch of old pictures. Most of the
pictures</b>
<br><b>were of a young man of about 25 or 30. In many of the pictures he
was in our</b>
<br><b>house and standing on the porch of&nbsp; the house. There were also
some antique</b>
<br><b>glass slides with pictures of him in a military uniform. We dated
the stuff</b>
<br><b>around World War II. We decided to call our landlady, an elderly
woman around</b>
<br><b>80 yrs old to tell her we had found the box. When we called her
and told her</b>
<br><b>what we had found she hung up on us. We called back and her daughter
answered</b>
<br><b>and said that they didn't want that stuff anymore and we could have
it or</b>
<br><b>throw it away. We thought it was very strange since normally our
landlady was</b>
<br><b>a sweet old lady. So we decided that some of the stuff in the box
might be</b>
<br><b>worth some money and we would sell some of it. Some war medals and
even an</b>
<br><b>old stock certificate. That night I put the box on the kitchen table
and we</b>
<br><b>went to bed. In the morning we were going to move the last of everything
and</b>
<br><b>as we were preparing to go I asked my roommate what she had done
with the box</b>
<br><b>of stuff. She said she hadn't touched it. We looked everywhere and
couldn't</b>
<br><b>find it. Finally, around lunch we got hungry and decided to cook
a frozen</b>
<br><b>pizza. We turned on the oven and immediately began to smell something</b>
<br><b>burning. When I opened the oven- there was the box. Oookaay- I swore
my</b>
<br><b>roommate did it and she swore I did it. So we left the box on the
table again</b>
<br><b>and left to move some things to the new place. When we got back
the box was</b>
<br><b>gone again. This time we found it immediately in the kitchen pantry.
So we</b>
<br><b>kind of laughed it off and put it back on the kitchen table. About
ten</b>
<br><b>minutes later I walked into the kitchen and it was gone again. I
decided the</b>
<br><b>heck with it and decided to just go finish the bedroom closet I
had just</b>
<br><b>minutes before been working on. When I stepped up on the chair to
wipe off</b>

<br><b>Mesquite Tx Stories</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: thelightsareon@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Ok, this is the first time I have ever done this and I'm not much
of a story teller, but I'll try so please bear with me. This is a long
story (and may need to be split up into several stories, but I will title
them Mesquite Stories 1,2 and so on. As I said, it is a long story as it
spans the 40 year period of my life. My story takes place in Mesquite,
Texas, which is a suburb of Dallas, and actually begins in 1973 when my
mother married my stepdad and we moved into his house. When they got married,
we, my mother, myself, 2 sisters and brother (my mother had 4 children
and he had 2) moved into his 2 bedroom mobile home in the older part of
Mesquite. Since his sons had the smaller bedroom, the 4 of us had to sleep
on roll-away beds in the living room, but later they built on some extra
bedroom to accomodate the large family. To protect them I will change their
names and hope if they ever read this they wont kill me! Lol! OK, now to
the story. For the first few years nothing ever really happened, or perhaps
med out and sounds of kitchen drawers could be heard opening and slamming.
Worried, Lou locked her door and the next morning when she came out, Cassie
didnt remember anything. Another time I was sleeping in Cassies bed as
she had fallen asleep on the floor. Ok, I guess a description of the house
is needed for this part. Picture a long mobile home with 2 extra rooms
built onto about half of one side of it, adjoining to the main house by
one door off of the sons bedroom. Anyway, Cassie had moved into the sons
bedroom as they had both moved out (my step brothers) and my younger brother,
whom Ill call Jr. was in the front part while Lou was at the back bedroom.
Anyway, I had just laid down in Cassies bed and as I said before, she was
asleep in the floor next to me. My brother Jr was in his bed and Lou was
in her room. We heard a noise from outside so we automatically jumped up
when Cassie jumped up and looked in the direction as well. I got freaked
out because I could see through the wall and was looking directlyis way
around he didnt bother turning on the lights. On his way back he noticed
a greenish blue light emanationg from his room. As soon as he stepped through
the door, he saw Cassie hovering about 6 inches above her bed and this
light was all around her. Scared, almost to the point of screaming, he
ran to Lous room and tried for a long time to wake her so she could see,
but she would not budge. So he crawled in bed with her and stayed there,
awake, the rest of the night. Of course when he told my mother, she laughted
and chalked it up to dreams or over active imagination. Fast forward a
few more years with nothing but lights flickering, doors opening and slamming
shut and only minor occurances. I was married, had a 2 year old daughter
and had rented a mobile home on the same street as my mother. My brother
and sisters spent a lot of time at my house. One day Lou and Cassie were
there with me and my daughter. We were in my bedroom as the central ac
had gone out and the window unit was in my room. I had been li that house.
We went to stay at my mothers until my husband got home. We told him what
had happened and though I dont think he believed us, he went along with
it. He walked me home and stood guard while I tore the head, legs and arms
from that doll and put it in a trashbag. The next morning we BOTH took
it out and watched the garbage man put it in his truck. The next night
it was back sitting on my bed. I freaked, but since my husband was there
I put on a brave front and started tearing the doll apart again. This time
I placed each piece in different boxes that we had stacked on top of one
another on my daughters bedroom closet. Then I closed and locked the door
thinking there was no way it could get out. Wrong. The next day it was
back. Needless to say, we packed up everything and moved to California.
Several years passed with nothing strange happening. When we came back
to Texas, however, that changed. My husband got a job as truck driver so
I had to spend a couple of months with my mother. About 2 weeks law!!!
Anyway, without a word, Cassie got up from the floor and walked over to
the other couch, laid down and began masturbating. In front of everybody!
We were all too stunned to do anything for several seconds but finally
I went over and told her to stop it, and she threw her hands up in the
air and denied doing anything like that. I know I didnt imagine it, we
ALL saw it. Fast forward a few more years, My husband and I are divorced
and I am living with another man whom Ill call Lee. I realized too late
that he was not the type to work, but once in the relationship I was too
afraid to leave him. He drank a lot of was abusive. At this time we were
living in a rundown motel with kitchenette. Lou was staying with us as
she could not get along with my stepfather. This "room" was more like an
apartment as it had a living room, 1 bedroom, kitchen and bathroom, in
that order as you came in the door. There was 2 doors in the living room,
both leading to the samed he went to prison. Anyway, I was remarried. My
then husband and I rented an apartment and everything was wonderful for
the first year. One night we were arguing and it was almost like he became
possessed. He got violent and then tried to rape me. Being the stubborn
woman I am, I was trying to fight him off. All of a sudden the phone started
ringing so I managed to get away and ran to answer it. As soon as I picked
it up, I started crying, then my husband did too. We suddenly realized
that we didnt have the phone turned on yet. I even grabbed the cord and
brought it up to show him, it was not plugged into the wall. He apologized
for his behavior and swears he doesnt know what made him do that, but I
know God or an angel was protecting me that night. We talked about everything
and straightened everything out. As soon as we got back into bed, the rocking
chair in our room began rocking. I thanked "whatever was there" and the
chair stopped suddenly and everything was back to normal. Ok, fast forward
a few more makes. She slept in one of those old day beds made of brass.
You couldnt touch that bed without hearing those sounds. Anyway, I stormed
into her room and stopped dead in my tracks. My daughter was in bed fast
asleep. I searched under her bed, in her closet, everywhere, but nothing.
I immediately ran into my room to check on my youngest daughter who was
then about a 1 1/2 years old. She seemed fine but I could still feel my
heart beating in my throat! I went in and told Lou what had happened and
she blamed it on the horror movies we were watching. Nothing else ever
happened there. Fast forward another year. I got a job as an apartment
manager in Richardson, Tx. Lou was still living with me as we both hoped
to be able to save some money since I didnt have to pay rent. Though unmarried,
we were both pregnate at this time, but I later miscarried mine when I
fell down a flight of stairs. Anyway, one night after the girls were asleep
I went into my room to read for a little while. I know I wasnt asleep because
I w I tried to see in the darkness but couldnt see anything but a shadow.
All of a sudden I heard a noise that sounded like tiny feet running on
wood and saw something solid on the desk I kept in my bedroom for personal
use. Since the light was on the other side of the bed I yelled for Lou
who came running. I never took my eyes off the dark object and when Lou
turned on my light, I was staring at a Beetle Juice doll that belonged
to my oldest daughter. How it got into my room and on my desk I have no
idea, but there it was. As with the other doll, I threw it away, but this
one did not come back! One night a friend and his wife came to spend the
night. In the middle of the night he heard someone talking and went to
investigate. He told me my oldest daughter was sitting up on her bed, facing
the closet, telling whoever or whatever she was talking to, to "go away,
all you do is get me into trouble." When I asked her about it the next
morning, she didn't know w the first experience we had there was on our
second night. About 1 am my oldest daughter came to my room crying. She
said a snake was after her. Being afraid of snakes I let her sleep with
me and had my brother check it out the next morning. He didnt find anything
but my daughter still refused to sleep up there. She later told e the snake
had disappeared right before her eyes. The next night, also around 1 am
I was awakened by the most horrible smell. It reminded me of really strong
cigar smoke and that sickly sweet smell of a funeral home. I guess it would
be death masked by flowers. Anyway, I tried to sit up to see what was causing
the smell, but I couldnt move, except my head. It was so cold I could see
my breath but never saw what was causing these things to happen. It felt
as though someone were holding me down. Panicking, I fought the invisible
restraints until finally they left and so did the smell. I sat up and ran
to check on the kids, but they were sound asleep. Needless to say I was
up for the resust have been a Friday night, I was in my living room on
my computer and Michelle was in her room on hers. Our computers are connected
by a lan cable so I have to be online in order for her to be able to chat
or check her mail. She loves to go into a kids chat room, which I will
not say the name. Anyway, we both have Yahoo Instant Messenger. Now for
those of you who have it, you know that a name is always beside the message
so people will know who is saying what. Right? Well one night we were online
and all of a sudden she came in here and told me that someone was calling
her a "B" and telling her to "get the F!@# out!" I asked her who said that
and she said she didnt know as there was no name, just the window. My first
thought was that a hacker had figured out how to do that, but why would
anyone want to torment a child like that? Besides, Im not ever sure if
that can be done. Since then lights have been turning off and on, my bedrooim
door and the bathroom door refuses to stay open and you can "feel" it in
down and freaked! Thankfully she did it, not knowing what that meant She
thought a cross was a cross reagrdless of its position. I put it back in
place right side up and thankfully it is still there! There are times when
you can smell bread rising. I guess its the yeast that gives off that aroma,
but it is unmistakable! I have always heard that spirits are stationary
in a house or personal item, but I dont know that I believe that. I have
seen and heard too many things to think almost every place I have ever
lived was haunted. My story may not be as scary as some I have read here,
but when odd things happen all your life, it becomes less noticable. One
other thing! I and my siblings have always kept mother informed of our
"strange happenings" and she has never believed. She is retired now and
has moved to East Texas to live in the country. I went to spend the weekend
with her a couple of weeks ago and after I left she told me that the tv
in her bedroom turned itself off twice! She thought it was my nephew (shhe
ligth, sparks started flying from the fan sitting on my dresser. I jumped
up to turn it off, then unplugged it. I believe that "someone or something"
was protecting us that night. If I had been allowed to go back to sleep,
our apartment would have burned up, possibly me included as I am a sound
sleeper.&nbsp; I have enjoyed this board and the many hours I have spent
here, lurking and reading other peoples experiences. Thank you for listening
to my story and if anything notewotry happens, I'll let you know.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Madge</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: glenn.southall@btc.com.tr</b><b></b>
<p><b>It started some years ago and, I am happy to say, been over for some</b>
<br><b>considerable time. I am confident that I am no longer being followed
by</b>
<br><b>'Madge', but I would like to share my experiences with you and if
you can</b>
<br><b>provide any insight or better understanding of what happened to
me, I would</b>
<br><b>be most happy.</b>
<br><b>Some years ago I was sleeping over at a friends apartment. I went
to bed and</b>
<br><b>lay there alone with my thoughts until (I think) I fell asleep.
I was awoken</b>
<br><b>by three sharp knocks, similar to somebody knocking on a solid wooden
door</b>
<br><b>and turned my head to the bedroom door which was three yards away
to my</b>
<br><b>right. The door was closed, yet within in the door frame was a figure.
To my</b>
<br><b>eyes, the figure was 'shimmering' and vivid with colours, without
any real</b>
<br><b>human form, yet to my senses I was certain that it was a woman,
that she was</b>
<br><b>extremely tall and that she was wearing jewellery. I 'perceived'
her with an</b>
<br><b>absolute clarity that my eyes were unable to support.</b>
<br><b>I opened my mouth to yell, but could not. It lasted only a few seconds
when</b>
<br><b>the door opened and my friend entered the room. The vision was gone.</b>
<br><b>I said to my friend, with a detached calmness, that I had just seen
a ghost,</b>
<br><b>but this of course was met with indifference. I did not press the
matter as</b>
<br><b>I was already beginning with self-doubt.</b>
<br><b>By the end of a mostly sleepless night I had managed to convince
myself that</b>
<br><b>it was a dream, or at least a product of that period between sleep
and</b>
<br><b>wakefulness. Within days, the whole episode was forgotten.</b>
<br><b>Some 6 months later I was at home with my parents and decided upon
an early</b>
<br><b>night. I had a lot on my mind that night and needed some space and
some</b>
<br><b>quiet for contemplation. I was lying on my single bed in my small
bedroom,</b>
<br><b>lost in thought, when I heard the three knocks again. My heart leapt.
From</b>
<br><b>my bed I can see ahead of me and to the right, the bedroom door,
which was</b>
<br><b>open, and the landing is accessable by three ascending steps. Through
the</b>
<br><b>door I can see about 3 yards of the landing until the angle of the
door</b>
<br><b>frame cuts off the view. There, just at that farthest point, was
the same</b>
<br><b>vision. The same shimmering colours. She was much clearer this time
and</b>
<br><b>there was no doubt that my eyes were seeing a woman. She was so
tall that</b>
<br><b>she had to bend her head to her left until it was almost resting
on her</b>
<br><b>shoulder....like a body hanging without the noose. But she was looking
at</b>
<br><b>me, her eyes (although I couldn't actually 'see' them) were fixed
upon me</b>
<br><b>and there was malice in them I had no doubt. Then, in an instant,
she came</b>
<br><b>along the landing, down the three steps and right up to my face.
So quickly</b>
<br><b>and so aggressively she brought her face to within an inch of mine.
I could</b>
<br><b>make out her eyes and nose....but to this day I cannot be sure if
I saw them</b>
<br><b>or 'experienced' them. I could not separate her emotions from her
visage</b>
<br><b>which seemed to be one and the same in my mind. It is difficult
to describe,</b>
<br><b>but I 'saw' her face and features along with&nbsp; her hatred and
despite.</b>
<br><b>I opened my moth to scream, but nothing came. Eventually she disappeared.
I</b>
<br><b>have never been so terrified in all my life...never has fear removed
my</b>
<br><b>capacity to utter or to move a single muscle and yet this was the
case. I</b>
<br><b>lay rigid for some time, at least until the room was light from
daybreak. I</b>
<br><b>was absolutely sure that I had not fallen asleep, but yet over time
I</b>
<br><b>managed to convince myself that this was indeed the case...this
is how I</b>
<br><b>came to terms with it.</b>
<br><b>Over the next year I saw no more of her and she was reduced to an</b>
<br><b>entertaining story for friends.</b>
<br><b>Then I married and moved to set up house with my wife. The third,
the last</b>
<br><b>and the unequivocal sighting was during the early days in my new
home. It</b>
<br><b>was a bright, warm Sunday afternoon and I was sitting on a chair
to watch a</b>
<br><b>television programme (an old episode of Bonanza, as it happens)
when I</b>
<br><b>became 'aware' of another presence in the room. I turned to the
door behind</b>
<br><b>me, fully expecting my wife to be there, but she was not. As I turned
my</b>
<br><b>head back to the TV, to my right was a settee and, sat in the middle
was the</b>
<br><b>woman again. This time she was sat on the edge of the settee, with
her head</b>
<br><b>forward, cupping her chin im her hands and her knees were also together</b>
<br><b>under her chin. She was leaning forward in this position contemplating
me</b>
<br><b>amusingly (or mockingly, I cannot decide).</b>
<br><b>There was much more clarity about her features and the room was
bright,</b>
<br><b>which she seemed to reflect. There, in front of me was a woman,
about 25</b>
<br><b>years old, very sharp features, very tall and very thin. Her bright
colours,</b>
<br><b>her har and her jewellery reminded me of a 'punk rocker' although
this was</b>
<br><b>not so....she was, I am sure, from a time long before that era.
I was not</b>
<br><b>afraid and, emboldened by the daylight, I simply and calmly asked
her what</b>
<br><b>she wanted. There was no response, no answer....she simply faded
away and I</b>
<br><b>have not seen her to this day.</b>
<br><b>Compressing my research into a short paragraph, I went back to the
place of</b>
<br><b>the first sighting and asked my friend some questions. It transpired
that</b>
<br><b>she was 'haunted' by a spirit many years previously who would disturb</b>
<br><b>household objects. An 'expert' was brought in, who ascertained that
they</b>
<br><b>were being haunted by a malevolent spirit who was called Madge.
It was not</b>
<br><b>possible to get rid of her, but to hope that she leaves of her own
accord.</b>
<br><b>This happened in my friends home town, some 300 miles from where
I live.</b>
<br><b>My theory is that Madge came with my friend to my home town and
took a</b>
<br><b>liking to me, thereby follwing me to both my parents home and onward
to my</b>
<br><b>married home. I don't know who has provided the vehicle for her
to leave my</b>
<br><b>house, but I hope that she has gone for good.</b>
