<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">Now, before I start
I am only eleven years of age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet I
have had more paranormal experiences than most.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The setting for all of these stories is Knox county, TN.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first experience I had was when I was five.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My family had just moved and me and big
sister were at my Granny's house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
sitting in the dining room playing with a deck of cards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt someone enter the room so I looked up
there was a little girl about two with curly brown hair and green eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She looked a lot like my cousin Adrian so I
started talking to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Asking questions
like "I didn't know you were here" and "Did Aunt Cindy drop you
off".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sister came in who at the
time was nine and asked who I was talking to I told her <st1:city w:st="on">Adrian</st1:city>
was here and she said <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Adrian</st1:place></st1:city>
wasn't there she was at a doctors appointment today.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">My next experience
happened when I was ten.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was again at
my Granny's house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in the living
room watching television.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I looked
at the doorway that leads to the front door, the hall, and the dining
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Standing there in the doorway was
a man that looked about 45-55, he was smiling at me lovingly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had light red hair and one of those long
mustaches that curl at the ends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also
had on a nice brownish colored suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was kind of hard to tell because he was kind of faded like he was taken out of
an old photograph.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition to that
he was very tall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I called for my Granny
to come to the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I described
the man to her and she went over to the shelves that held some photographs of
her family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She picked up a really old
one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she showed it to me it had the
man I just saw, the little girl that looked like my cousin, a girl that was
about 5 with long brown hair, a boy about 9 with short red hair, a girl that
was about eleven who looked like me (long blond hair and blue eyes), and a
women about 47 with long blond hair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
asked her who they were.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said they
were Greenberry, <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Elizabeth</st1:place></st1:city>,
Dorsy-lee, Yale, Rebecca, and Ruth.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Greenberry was my great-grandfather.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Elizabeth</st1:place></st1:city>,
Dorsy-lee, and Rebecca his children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
Ruth his wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ruth was surprisingly my
Granny's name and that was her family and the reason she wasn't in the picture
was because she was very sick at the time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Also she mentioned the reason I was named Rebecca was because Granny had
showed her that picture right before I was born.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was shocked that I looked so much like
people I never new.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The I remembered
that the man was smiling at me I told my Granny and she just sighed and said he
always loved Rebecca, he loved us all but Rebecca was like a miracle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was born with bad breathing and they
thought she wouldn't make it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He always
did that and I know why she was like an angel it was always herself last and
others first.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dad always admired that in
a person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">5/28/07<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">I had a very strange
thing happen to me this past memorial day weekend. <o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">I am a dental
hygienist,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have worked for 20+ years.
I am currently<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in the <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Philadelphia</st1:place></st1:city> area working. My home is in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Johnstown</st1:city> <st1:state w:st="on">Pa.</st1:state></st1:place>
I am a home owner and go back on the weekends mostly to maintain my yard by
cutting the grass, and things that most people do outside their homes
particularly in the summer time.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">For years I had been
taking the grass clippings, in the woods, behind my house. We had some new
neighbors move in and place no trespassing signs along the edge of the woods.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">Last Summer I had
started taking<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the grass clippings out
to the North Fork Dam area. It is a heavily wooded area . There is a tiny graveyard
at the lower end of the Dam 15 or less headstones. "Becky's Grave" is
what I can remember this place being called. <o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">After i cut the
grass on Saturday evening this past weekend sure enough I drove out to the
North Fork Dam area near the graveyard to dump my grass clipping. <o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">There is a tiny
bridge at the entrance and a gate across the beginning of the path that leads
to the grave site.. <o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">I decided to go for
a walk on the path that leads to the graveyard out of curiosity, is 5 or 10
minute walk. I was standing in the graveyard at 9:00 pm when I saw a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can describe it as a white, glowing, shadow
of a man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a very old man with a wrinkled
face, a hooked nose , and a pony tail with a small bow tie on the end of it. He
was wearing a night shirt with a ruffled collar and buttons down the front.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">He walked right past
me 20 feet in front of me on the edge of the woods along the path. He turned to
look at me without any kind of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>emotions.
and then kept walking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I normally don't
see things like this The entire thing lastly about 10 seconds .<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">I wanted to send you
this email<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">Birthday Wish From
Grandma?<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">My wife and I had
something very strange happen. Last November on her 30th birthday, she was in
the bathroom getting ready to go out. She has her grandmother's jewelry box
that plays music. Her grandmother died on January 1, 1994. This jewelry box
hadn't been wound up for at least 3 years or more (we had to replace the
missing wind-up key). It would play briefly a few times after we wound it up,
but I assumed that it was just a small amount of force left on the notched
drum.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">For some reason, it
began to play briefly on her birthday last year and then stopped. It hasn't
done that since then. I wonder if it could have been a birthday wish from her
grandmother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">Mind you I'm only
eleven years old but, I've had an abundance of supernatural experiences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My first encounter I can remember was when I
was three years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in my
Parent's room an the computer playing a game while my Dad was getting ready to
go out somewhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When my Dad tried to
walk out the door it shut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He opened it
and tried again but, it shut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He called
for my Mom to come to the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she
walked in Dad tried to walk out but, the door shut again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My Mom said "Grandma Kelly doesn't want
you to leave," she was just playing around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then she said "Grandma Kelly let Ben
leave it's alright."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My Dad tried
to walk out and the door didn't shut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
asked Mom who Grandma Kelly was and she said that she wasn't my real Grandma,
just an old lady that used to live in our house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also the chair on the front porch would rock
back and forth for no reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Turns out
that was "Grandma Kelly's" rocking chair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">My next experience
happened when I was five.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My family had
just moved to a new house near the older house where the previous occurrences
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My Mom was rocking me to sleep
in our red recliner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked at my
bedroom door and saw a foot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wanted to
tell my Mom but, I just couldn't bring up the courage to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">The next
supernatural experience occurred when I was seven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was playing by myself with a soccer ball
just kicking it back and forth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I kicked
it to hard and it rolled behind the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I started to go get it the ball came flying from behind the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought it was my sister so I
called her name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I thought it might be our neighbor Charlie
who at the time was eleven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I called his
name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I walked to the back of the house and on the
back porch was a girl that looked about ten.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I ran into the house and didn't go outside for a week.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">My last experiences
happened this year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in my room
listening to my new mp3 player.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had this
cool recording thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried it and
listened to it but, my voice didn't come through but, I heard people in the
background.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then in about April I was
listening to music on the computer when the music would skip and go all
weird.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt something in the
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought of the name Vince
because I know nobody with that name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
said "Vince, quit that it's not funny." It never happened again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">Last but not least
last week I was text messaging my friend JT and then I had no bars so I thought
I should go outside to try to get bars.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I walked out on the back porch I was holding my phone up trying to
get a signal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I must have looked pretty
stupid because I heard giggling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
turned around and there was the little girl I saw when I was seven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had long blond hair and really blue eyes
she was about 4'8 so I was about 7 inches taller than her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She continued giggling and pointed to the
holly bush.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I walked over there and I
had all bars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked to where the girl
had been to say thanks but, she wasn't there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have had more experiences but, they are mostly noises in the house and
seeing things in the corner of my eye.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>See I have had too many experiences when I was young and now I am very
paranoid about my surroundings.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">We bought this house
in 1993.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were numerous large
scratches on the door frames, from the previous owner's large dog.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">Everything was fine
until we started to put in a pool a few years later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the first day of digging, a large black
or brown dog was visible from the corner of your eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would follow my son whenever he was home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whenever I was home alone, it would follow
me. <o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">We finally filled in

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">One of your stories
reminded me of this one.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">In 1947, my dad was
working for a small electrical company in north central <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Arizona</st1:place></st1:state> called The Arizona Power
Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This company had been around
the Yavapai County area for a good fifty to seventy years; had brought
electricity to most of the townships between Route 66 to the north, and Phoenix
to the south, as well as cities in the western part of northern Arizona to as
far east as Winslow and Holbrook.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
World War II receding into memory, the company began looking forward with an
eye toward expansion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two or three other
small companies rebuffed their advances, but one, the Flagstaff Electrical
Company, was receptive to being acquired. <o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">Dad had been working
in an area east of our home in <st1:city w:st="on">Prescott</st1:city>, called
the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Verde</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">Valley</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The company had been engaged in a savage battle with the Federal Rural
Electric Agency for the past eighteen months for the right to supply
electricity to the residents of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Oak
  Creek</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">Canyon</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
Sedona and several other small communities, and had only recently been awarded
the contract for electrical construction in those areas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One Friday, he came home a bit agitated, yet
excited, and told mom that he had been offered the foreman's position at
Flagstaff, but as there were loose ends to tie up, our family had about a month
to consider the offer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">Mom wasn't too
pleased as we were just getting our house built.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had just gotten running water into the
kitchen, and we were working on the bathroom, putting fixtures in as they were
offered on the market.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1946 and 1947,
the country still had not fully converted to civiian goods, and everything was
at a premium.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was also the
question of me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was a junior in high
school, was doing fairly well, and had just acquired my first boy-friend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wan't too enthused about moving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My brother was in first grade, and he was
considered moveable. <o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">The folks talked
about it over supper, and decided to take the company up on its offer of a
month to decide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was just so much
to work out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Early the next day, a heavy
pounding on the kitchen door awakened all of us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dad went out to find that it was his boss,
who had big news.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dad was to report at <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Flagstaff</st1:place></st1:city> the following
monday, and we were to be moved up there, kit and kaboodle within two
weeks!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dad's protests were brushed
aside, so we got ready to move. <o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">He went on up the
following monday; mom, my brother Lorin and I went up the next day to look for
a house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What a nightmare!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No houses anywhere, and the only way a person
could get into a local apartment complex was to be working for the
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No exceptions. We finally
found a one-bedroom, summer cottage outside <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Flagstaff</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It had a wood stove, no heater, an outhouse, a woodshed, and we had to
haul our own water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Primitive, but
turned out to be one of my favorite homes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">We moved on election
day which was a stormy, gloomy day, and I started school the next day, but the
folks agreed to keep looking.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">One day, a few
months after moving to <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Flagstaff</st1:place></st1:city>,
mom happened to be driving down a street she hadn't tried before in her house
search.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She found one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A very nice, frame house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A penciled sign tacked to a stake in the
front yard stated it was for rent, those interested were to call a particular
telephone number. Needless to say, mom was elated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was close to town, close to the high
school as well as the grade school that Lorin attended. She was so excited, she
didn't wait for the school bus to pick Lorin up, but picked him up herself,
then went down to find dad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">All three of them
went back to the house, parked<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the car,
and then walked around the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
about two bedrooms as far as they could tell, a large living room, a big
kichen, and I believe it had a fireplace.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mom was overjoyed to see it had hardwood floors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a large garage in back, and all in
all, it was perfect!<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">We were a happy
group at supper that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was happy
because living five miles out of town put a damper on my social life, and Lorin
was happy to be able to walk to school.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mom fairly flew through her housework the next morning, because she
wanted to get to town to rent the house before it was taken from under us. <o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">She decided on the
way into town to drive by the house to check the telephone number. There was a
problem.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No house. Only a vacant lot.
Disbelieving her own eyes, mom drove around the block, in fact, she drove around
several blocks, trying to make sure she had the right one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each time, she circled back to the block in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Same thing. No house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No sign in the yard, nothing.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">Dad and Lorin were
stunned that evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had walked
around the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had peeked in the
windows, in fact, Lorin was saying recently that he could still
"feel" the window sill on his fingers when he leaned on it to look
into the house. <o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">A few years later, I
married a boy from my high school class at <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Flagstaff</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He had lived in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Flagstaff</st1:place></st1:city>
all his life, and mom asked him about the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both she and dad described it in detail to
him, but to their surprise, he could not remember there ever being a house on
that lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His dad was a local carpenter
having had built most of the houses in Flagstaff, and to make sure, my husband
asked his dad, giving him all the details my folks had provided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His reply was that that particular lot had
never been built on, and he knew of no plans to ever build on it. <o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">It that is so, what
did the folks and Lorin see that day?<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">My brothers &amp; I
have raised over 60 dogs the past 23 years. We like dogs ;O) <o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">It was 1987,,, at
the time we had mostly Redbone Coon Hounds. One day some of them got out of the
yard by accident. We got them all back immmediately except for the mother
"Sundance". I searched high &amp; low for her for weeks. When a hound
showed up at the local dogpound,,I'd be there only to be disappointed that it
wasn't her. I searched for her non-stop except when it was raining because I
knew that she would not step out into the rain,,that was just the way she was.
I was determined to find her,,we had her kids at home also. She used to curl up
in the chair in the corner of the kitchen &amp; sleep. That was her spot that
she liked. One day I was sitting at the kitchen table talking to Martin who was
sitting across from me,,behind him in the chair I saw my Sundance. It was like
she had been sleeping &amp; woke &amp; slowly lifted her head &amp; looked
right at me. It was incredible.I could see her red coloring but could also see
right thru her &amp; could see the brown chair behind her. She was transparent.
I did not imagine this &amp; it wasnt like I thought I saw her out of the
corner of my eye,,I DID see her clearly &amp; for about 12 seconds or so. When
I looked at Martin &amp; looked back,,she was gone. I think that was her way of
telling me to stop looking for her because she had come home.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">We've rented a house
in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Middleburg</st1:city>, <st1:state w:st="on">PA</st1:state></st1:place> for almost four years now. The house was
built in the 1800's by our landlord's grandparents.(Our land lord is close to
his 80's)<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">The upstairs is VERY
haunted. EVERYTIME we use the staircase to come down, it is second nature to
look back at the top when you reach the bottom because you can feel something
staring at you. We have a "feeling" that it's a young girl. Even
strangers who come to our house for the first time express this same feeling.
Once, without being told about the presence before hand, a friend was touched
on the arm by it. <o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">Also, one time it
locked by husband upstairs with it! The door that accesses the staircase can
only be locked/unlocked on the outside of the door by using an old skeleton key
which we keep hung on the wall (INSIDE the staircase) I remember him pounding
on the door to let him out. The door had been locked on the outside but it was
3am and myself our three year old son was asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">All the
"regular" stuff happens to. We hear walking upstairs, sometimes
crashing up there. I'll be in my study upstairs, reading, and I'll be so
annoyed at the noise I'll walk out to yell out my husband to find him outside
in the yard.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">I've heard rumors
the the house, in particular our attic, was a cival war hospital. I'm not sure
if that's true but I definitely know it is haunted.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">The odd thing is,
that while you get that creepy feeling whenever you walk down the stairs or
hear something walking upstairs, you're comforted by it at the same time. Like
I said, we've lived there for a number of years so we've come to accept it as a
daily part of life. I often wonder though, who the entity is, what their story
is.....<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">I was 16 at the time
and this happened at my own home. Not sure if this is still an occurance or not
at this time but when me and my family lived in the house we encountered some
very evil spirits. The back bedroom was unable to be slept in because of how
strong the pressence was. There were nights that either me or my parents were
awaken from a dead sleep and seen aparations above the beds which looked like a
person holding a knife or object of some kind. And there were nights that we
would wake up to see a line of dead people outside the window. My father even
encountered the face of the devil in the back room. There was a night when I
was either 16 or 17 that my mother sent me and my father outside after a broom
she left by the 16 ft flat bed trailer we had and when we went out there I
myself felt a strong evil presence and when I turned around I looked a demonic
figure in the face. I can't discibe the figure but the face was that of a
man/beast. The house is now sold to another man which is now living there if
you would like to know more email me back and I will try the best I can to
answer your questions. <o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">This happened to me
when I was about six years old so I cannot remember every detail, but I know
that it happened and to this day freaks me out. I went to this family reunion
and as a kid I just remember being really bored and not knowing anyone there
really. I decided that the crowds and all the noisiness was really bothering me
so I went into this back room of my great grandfather's house. I remember
playing with my Pokemon action figures and I heard someone open the door. I
looked up and a woman had entered the room. I remember talking to her and us
introducing ourselves. I only talked for a short while and she said that she
had to go and left. I don't remember thinking anything of it until I saw my
parents horrified faces when I told them that I had seen my aunt Monica. They
got a picture album and made me find which one was her and I showed them. Then
they told me that it was impossible for me to have seen her that she had
committed suicide years before I was born. I had known nothing of this
previously so needless to say I was very scared. There was nothing unusual
about the meeting that I remember, but I have no spoken of it since because it
is very strange to me.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">Well It seems that I
have more than one to tell so I will tell the very first one. When I was very
young and still using a crib, myself and my family lived in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>. One
day my mother came into the room only to find my brother, who is 18 months
older than me, and myself laughing hysterically. She looked above my crib to my
wind up mobile and found that it was wound up so tight it was playing fast. My
mother asked my brother what was so funny and he replied "Big man with
ring-a-ring". Which ment the big man with an earing. Well she knew that my
brother nor I was able to reach that mobile to wind it up and she was the only
other one in the house.. A few days later she was talking to some of the
neibors and they told her not to worry that it was the old <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">gardner</st1:place></st1:city> and he loved to play with the
children. And he had been dead for about 100 or so years.....<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">this is my ghost
story i hope you will add it.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">when we first moved
into this house, there was a large blood stain on the garage wall. my parents
said it was paint, but i didnt listen to them. i firmly believed it was blood.
maybe a year or two later i was in my garage with the big door open, when i
heard a laugh.it was evil-sounding, but at the same time it sounded like a 6
month old.I got outta there really quick! i was home alone so there is no way
to explain that laugh. i heard one time the next day, only fainter, as i was in
there. i stayed that time. two days later i walked into my room. it was messed
up! someone had taken my two year old brother's cd(he slept in my room) out of
my radio, and the radio station had been changed. i put the cd back in and
changed the station back to my normal one.i left it on. 15 minutes later, i
went and the cd was playing! assuming it was one of my brothers, i turned it
off. that afternoon i went in with my book (im a bookworm)and laid down on my
bed to read i had not noticed it but it was off when I came in though no one
had been in there. About five minutes later it turned on. I was surprised but
though it must have been a freak thing. That night however I saw a second
person in my brother's crib I began to pray to god and it immediately
disappeared. I haven't seen anything since and don't want too but it is my
belief that someone died in the garage and is was haunting our house<span style="">&nbsp; </span>but its gone now and I definitely don't plan
on getting it back!<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">Hi, I come from a <st1:place w:st="on">Caribbean</st1:place> family mostly catholic but as you all may know
in the island's culture the occult forms part of our religion as well. The
women in my family seem to have a special connection and special way of seeing
things. Since my great grandmother and I'm sure before her as well. My mother
and I used to talk about spirits all the time and one day I said to her mother
you know I am very scary so if you are going to contact me in anyway after you
die make sure you do it through my dreams. She laughed and said ok. My mother
passed away at the age of 47, still young due to cancer. Almost a year after
she died one afternoon a decided to go home early from work because I did not
feel good. When I got home at 3:00 PM I laid down on the sofa and was almost
sleep. It was almost like I was sleep in the outside but awake in the inside
and suddenly I saw my mother standing there in front of the sofa just looking
at me smiling,not saying anything she looked like she used to look when I was
little she had her bid sunglasses on like the ones used in the late 70's. And
she was giving me two things. One was a triangular rock with a symbol on it and
a red white and turquoise feather. At the same time I knew she was dead but I
was crying and trying to reach for her from the couch suddenly I woke up when
my body slammed on the couch I was suspended on the air. It was a very weird
experience. All I could think of was that she wanted to contact me and she did
not want to scare me. But till this day I don't know the meaning of my dream.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

Taylor and I live in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Kokomo</st1:city>,
 <st1:state w:st="on">Indiana</st1:state></st1:place> and my husband chris' dad
died about 4 years ago in an apartment building. Well we moved into the same
apartment building this he passed in (only downstairs from the actual
apartment). One night i was up kinda late and I saw my husbands father walking
down our hallway and into our bedroom, I followed him but when i got to the
room he was gone. well the next night i went to bed early with my children and
woke up the next morning to my hair (which was down past the middle of my back,
i hadnt had a hair cut in 3 years) 6 inches shorter then what it was when i
went to bed. The strange thing about this is we had just moved in and i didnt
have any siccors in my apartment at the time. I knew he was there because of
his son and his grandchildren but did he really have to cut my hair. Alot of
strange things happened there, my heat would get shut off in the middle of the
night and it would be freezing in the house in the morning, my husband would
set his alarm clock to go off when he had to go to work but it would go off at
4:39am which is the time Bill (my husbands father) died. I just thought i would
share my story with you. Needless to say i moved out of there about 8 months
after i moved in. It really freaked me out. Thanks for taking the time to read
my story, Email mr back if you have any questions or comments.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">I have had several
dreams of past relatives that have past but this dream was reoccurring. Let me
start from the beginning. <o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">My father in law and
brother in law were fishermen for many years and their boat was lost out at sea
long before either my now husband were married. My husband in fact was in high
school at the time. The boat or the bodies were never found so it left a lot of
questions for the family. <o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My husband never got over the guilt of not
meeting them at a harbor some where down the coast line to make sure they got
there because before they left the had to replace the fuel pump. <o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Just keep in mind even though i and my
husband were married I had never seen a pic of either one of them. My mother in
law kept them packed away.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Well years later of being married to my
husband I started having a dream about a man standing on the shore above the
boats. He looked grotesques and I knew hew was not of the living because his
skin was green a slimy looking. He was wearing a black stocking cap, Jeans a
flannel and a fisherman thick jacket. I would get frighten and wake up. The
same dream kept on happening till finely through fear I asked him what he
wanted. <o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly I was whisked away which felt like
an out of body experience, and I was standing on a rock in a hidden alcove
along the shore. The tide was out and there were several of these rocks were
sticking up out of the water. I looked around then down on the rock I was
standing on and I see two skeletons lay on the rock. <o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Next thing I knew they came together and
forming 2 skeletons. In awe and frightened, I started to see there mouthes move
but heard nothing in my ears but heard them speaking in my head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They told me to tell everyone that they are
fine and happy and to make sure I told the family to stop wondering and to move
on with their lives and that one day they will see them again. Next thing I
knew, I realized it was my father in law and my brother in law. After speaking
to them and receiving the message they fell apart and rested on the rock that
they were standing as if they never came together. Heart racing I was shown the
path to a trail in order to climb up and out of the cove half way up I awoke. <o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It took me a few days to sort things out and
tell my husband what happened. At first I described the man on the docks the
one with black stocking hat, jeans ect. He said that it descibed his dad the
day he left for his final fishing trip. Remember I had not seen a picture of
him yet. I told my husband what he told that they were ok and happy now. I told
him t the details of where I was standing and what the cove looked like. He
said that the coast guard<span style="">&nbsp; </span>looked in a
spot as described<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in my dreams but never
found any bodies or the boat. <o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>After telling my husband I have never had a
that dream again. I have always known I helped my husband close a chapter of
guilt that had been eating him for years. i believe the main message was for my
hubby. I just recently finally got a good picture of my father in law and it
was him in my dreams. Just looking at the picture took my breath away. <o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

lived there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the article stated that one
thursday night around 11pm he came in out of the fields. He heard the ball
bouncing against the wall and flew into a rage.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>he went upstairs and killed his children then when confronted by his
wife he hung her and then killed himself with a shotgun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the investigators at the time thought that he

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">In 2005 of November
when I was in 7th Grade my Grandfather passed away and I never got to say
good-bye to him. Me and my Mom were supposed to visit him in the hospital but
we never got the chance to. A couple weeks had passed and one night I was
trying to go to sleep but something kept me awake. I smelled something by my
vent that is by my bed. It smelled like smoke. So I checked every single room
figuring where the smell was coming from, but nothing. So I went back in my
room and the smell was still there. When I went back to bed, I realized that my
grandfather used to smoke cigars. I didn't really tell anyone about that night.
A couple days later from that experience, i had a dream about my grandfather in
a store with my mom, but I was the only one that could see him. That i told my
mom about and she just told me that he was making sure that I was okay. Since
now that my grandmother passed away in March of this year and I didn't get to
say good-bye to her, I hope that she comes and visits me once in awhile, too.
Well that's my story of my encounter and that i hope that someone can relate to
my story somehow.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">Dear Dave last night
while at work myself and a coworker experienced what we believe to be a person
communicating with a departed loved one. The person in question does not have an
altered mental state. We were doing rounds and we were checking on our
patients. We got to the door of Lillian's room and she was very peaceful lying
in bed when she began to gesture with her hands to a force or being we could
not see. As we watched silent from the door she began to speak. After several
minutes I approached Lillian and asked who her friend was she turned her head
to me and with an expression as if in a trance she said this is my husband and
he has been away driving a truck. I thanked her for the information and she
turned away and continued with her visit. We continued to stand at the door and
watch several more minutes passed when the curtain by her bed moved on it's own
as if someone were pushing it out of the way. To come closer to her bed. She
continued to gesture as if the person or spirit were now standing right next to
her bed and holding her hands. I felt nothing fighting and if this was the
spirit of her dead husband then his spirit was only there to comfort her . We
left continued our rounds. When I checked in on her later she was in a peaceful
sleep. I thought you might be interested in my story.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">This is an
absolutely true account of what happened to me, my brother Darren and our
friend Lee. At Sharpley Rd in Loughborough, UK.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">We were all sleeping
on the floor of my room as lee was staying over, because our mums were working
at the local pub together. It was about 1 am and Darren and I were just getting
to sleep when we heard this scraping coming from the bedroom of the adjoining
house. It was like someone was digging a spike high up in to the plaster on the
other side then dragging it down in an arc to the floor boards. This would just
happen again constantly, to the point where you thought it might actually come
through!!<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">Like I said, we were
awake but Lee, who was sleeping at our feet, was out cold. We tried to wake him
by shaking him but nothing worked. Then the smashing started, it was like a grown
man throwing dinner plates at the wall, one after another!<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">Then banging and
crashing started, all the time the other noises continued until it all built up
in to a crescendo of noise!!<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">The next thing to
happen would haunt me even to this day; we heard a very loud, piercing scream!
The only way I can describe it is a scream that was in the film
&#8220;Trainspotting&#8221;. In it a woman&#8217;s baby dies in its cot, and when the mother
finds it she screams. Well take that scream and times it by a 100!! Lee would
still not wake up, through all of this, which was strange on its own!!<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">Anyway, we were that
worried, we got our mother up who promptly rang the police who arrived shortly
after.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">They could here all
of this from the outside but with all their combined efforts to get somebody to
the front door nothing worked! They ended up breaking the door down, and that&#8217;s
when all of this got super spooky. They found nothing, the house was empty, and
there was no smashed cutlery, no mark down the wall. Nothing.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">The police left and
it all stared again. This time Darren and I were terrified, still lee would not
wake up.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">We just lay there
wide awake waiting for sun-rise. When it finally came, as if on cue, the first
bird we heard that Sunday morning ALL the noises stopped instantly, and at the
very same time Lee woke up. Wondering what all the fuss was about!<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">This story is 100%
true! Thanks for reading.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">I live in an old
house in Lisbon. We occasionally hear strange noises, one person will hear other
people having conversations when no one is around. We also have cold places in
the house. On occasion the living room or the downstairs bedroom will be four
or five degrees colder then the other rooms of the house. Sometimes my husband
claims that he sees strange blurs and movements out of the corner of his eye.
If we do have ghosts I don't feel that any of them or threatening. The other
day I was sitting in the living room watching TV when I swear I heard someone
yell from the kitchen. They said, "I'm waiting....!" as if someone
was in the kitchen and waiting for someone to finish getting ready to go and
they weren't moving fast enough and they where getting fed up with waiting. I
said 'what's your problem?' because I thought it was my husband getting home
from work and he wanted me to go someplace with him. When I got up to check it
up there was no one in the kitchen and my husbands motorcycle wasn't in the
garage as he had taken it to work that morning. My kids, 12 and 14 will come
down from their rooms and ask us what we wanted when neither my husband nor I
have called them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have a dog and she
doesn't seemed bothered one way or another.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">My Family and
friends used to live in an Apartment complex call Cape Meadows. During our two
years of living there we all experienced a number of unexplained experiences.
In our building there were 6 units, however only four were rented and livable,
the other two were damaged severely, they were used for storage of misc. items
through the years. In my particular apartment, my little girl started doing
strange things, she was talking to her closet one night, I asked her who she
was talking to, she said "Bobby," I asked her who "Bobby"
was, she told me he lived out back, by the bushes and the sand box. Soon after,
my daughters TV started turning on by its self, even when she wasn't home. We
would hear something coming from her bedroom, and when we opened the door her
TV would be on, so I turned it off and closed the door, sure enough I heard the
noises again, and went back to the room, TV was on again. This happened quite
often.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another time, my husband and I were asleep
and my daughter was sound asleep and my husband thought he felt my daughter
crawl in bed with us, when he turned over to get her and put her back to bed,
she wasn't there. He went to check n her and there she was out like a light.
Later that night our bedroom door slammed open and we saw what we though was my
little girl run around our bed, however there was nobody there again, we got up
to check on her again and the gates in the hallway started rattling and it was
very cold in the hallway and my little girls room, i checked the thermostat to
see if the heat was on and it was running and set on 70 like always, but the
temp gage read 35 degrees. My daughter was still sound asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another incident was my husband was sitting
in the living room with the front door wide open, he saw out the door in the
hallway a Smokey figure of an old black man wearing torn overalls, he turned to
me and said check this out, when he turned back, he was gone. That same night
we went down to our neighbors apartment and told them what my husband had seen,
and my neighbor described the same man sitting in his computer chair. At that
same neighbors apartment, my family and our friends from across the hall were
visiting and on the keychain hoder next to the door was a keychain floating in
the air as if someone was taking it iff the hook, but you couldn't see anyone,
my neighbor said "Hi Bobby," and the keychain fell.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>At my neighbors apartment below me, she was
sleeping one afternoon when her bedroom door started knocking back and forth
and the door handle was shaking, she thought it was the wind circulating
through the apartment causing this, but when she got up, on the outside of her
door was what looked like little wet handprints, but you couldn't wipe them
dry, and the never went away.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>At my other neighbors apartment, it was a
basement apartment and the two apartment above them were the damaged
apartments, but quite frequently we would hear footsteps and what sounded like
people moving furniture up there, these apartment were always locked and never
gone into by anyone. <o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>At my apartment, we would sometimes leave for
the weekend and go to my parents, when we would leave we turned all the light
out except for a lamp in the living room. When we would return home all the
lights would be on except for the lamp we had left on and we never locked our
deadbolt, because we had trusting neighbors, we would only lock the handle
lock, however when we returned the deadbolt was locked every time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was baby-sitting my neighbors daughter one
day, and when her parents came to pick her up we were looking for her shoes she
took off in my daughters bedroom, she pointed to the middle of the floor by the
bed where she left them, but they were not there, we looked under the bed, in
the closet, all over the apartment, no shoes. I told them I would keep looking
they would turn up somewhere and I would bring them down when I found them, so
they left and went home, I started looking again for her shoes in my daughters
bedroom, and sure enough, they were in the middle of the floor. They were not
there 10 min. prior.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had told our landlord about what we had
experienced and that my little girl was always talking to this
"Bobby" person, and that she told us he lived out by the bushes next
to the sand box, he told us that in the 70'S a little boy about 7 years old
drowned in the swimming pool where the sand box is now, he said that after the
little boy drowned the pool was filled with dirt and sand was laid out over it
to make a sand box, and the little boys name was Robert. He also told us that
the grounds the apartments were built on was an old slave community, which
might explain the black male in torn overalls.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>We experienced a lot of unexplained
occurrences here but none life threatening.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>
