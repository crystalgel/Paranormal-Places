Masonic Hall<br>
<br>
By: meerkat_life@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
<br>
This Masonic hall facing Wiseman park on Gipps st Gwynneville witch is
a small inner city suberb of wollongong had a man electrocuted in the
main room to the north of the top floor in 1971. his body found on the
Masonic print in the middle of the room with a huge smile on his face.
if you go to the Masonic hall strangely enough during the day you can
see him walking towards you with the big smile not saying a word just
staring at you and smiling as he walks towards you. the ghost is
blackened by the electrocution. also in a small concealed room accessed
by the main stairwell in the middle of the 1st and 2nd floor were a man
was killed by the explosion of a generator has loud noises coming from
it and if you walk past the small opening on the stairwell and look
into it you can see a small figure behind the generator screaming in
agony. This place is very intense to visit and I advise that no one
goes in there because No one has stayed long enough to see what this
smiling ghost will do everyone who has gone into this place and seen
these hunting&#8217;s has sworn never to return. also residence from
Catharine St (The street directly behind this hall) have claimed to
have seen blue light flashing from the room in the top floor during the
day time. This building is now abandoned and is being nocked down in
the next few years but teenagers going in there have come out
traumatised.<br>
I know this because me and a group of friends went in there at about
midday and went to the top floor and we saw this ghost. We ran out of
that place faster than we had ever run before We asked around and did
some research and found out a man had been electrocuted in there in
1971. And that the owner of this place and others who curiously went
into the abandoned building had seen this ghost. With the screaming man
behind the generator I believe this is true I went into this room
before going upstairs there was a burned out generator but I did not
personally see or hear this ghost from behind the generator screaming
but others that have been in there have told me of this ghost behind
the generator. And as for the residence from Catharine St seeing these
blue lights I know this because I can see the windows of the top floor
from my bathroom and I have seen them flash with blue lights I have
asked my neighbours they have also seen it (It can not be lights or
anything because electricity was cut to the place when it was abandoned
around 2005)<br>

The Ghost of&nbsp; Dr. William Fithian,&nbsp; Fithian, IL.<br>
<br>
By: tooearly@mchsi.com<br>
<br>
In the early 1980&#8217;s I was invited by a friend to come and visit them in
Fithian.&nbsp; They had purchased a large, old, 3 story house there and
were in the process of renovating it.&nbsp; The guest bedroom was on
the ground floor and that was the room they assigned to me.&nbsp; The
first evening I was there, we decided to&nbsp; go out for a late dinner
and dancing.&nbsp; We had gotten into the car when, at the last moment,
I decided that I should bring along a jacket.&nbsp; I went back inside
the house through the kitchen door, through the dining room and living
room and into the guest bedroom.&nbsp; As I hurried back out of the
room, I clearly saw a small gentleman in an old fashioned brown suit
standing behind&nbsp; the wing backed chair in the living room.&nbsp; I
hurried a bit faster and joined my friends in the car.&nbsp; Later that
evening when we returned to the house, I told them what I had
seen.&nbsp; It was then that they told me they knew the house was
haunted.&nbsp; They had heard phantom footsteps and had other strange
noises and activity.&nbsp; They had assumed the ghost to be that of the
builder of the home, Dr. William Fithian.&nbsp; They showed me a photo
of Dr. Fithian and , indeed, it was the gentleman I had seen.<br>
The town was named for Dr. William Fithian in the 1830&#8217;s.&nbsp; He was
a&nbsp; physician, served in both the Illinois House of Representatives
and the Illinois Senate and was friend and supporter of Abraham
Lincoln.&nbsp; The downstairs of the home had housed his
practice.&nbsp; The small downstairs bedroom&nbsp; was the exam
room.&nbsp; The room I saw him in was used as the waiting room.<br>

Mount Olivet Cemetery<br>
Watertown, CT<br>
<br>
By: viper_1550a@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
This is a true story.&nbsp; One night, back in college, my girlfriend and I were looking for a place to go and "make out."<br>
We decided to try Mount Olivet Cemetery, since it was out of the way
and we figured we wouldn't be bothered.&nbsp; We drove into the
cemetery parking lot and we parked the car in the back.&nbsp; It was
foggy and dark.&nbsp; Within a minute or so, a car pulled up behind
us.&nbsp; We thought it was a police car, since who else would bother
us at night in a cemetery?&nbsp; However, no one got out of the car at
all.&nbsp; As we took a closer look, it wasn't a police car.&nbsp; We
couldn't exactly tell what it was, but it was something bigger than the
Nissan I was driving.&nbsp; <br>
Then, the car started pulling out and passed by us.&nbsp; It was an
older model (70s or early 80s) station wagon (kind of like the one in
the Brady Bunch).&nbsp; The car seemed to disappear almost into thin
air.&nbsp; At this point, we were scared.&nbsp; I turned the car around
and headed for the exit.&nbsp; <br>
All of a sudden, headlights appeared in front of us.&nbsp; It was the
same car and it was about to pass us.&nbsp; As it did, we saw a glimpse
of the driver.&nbsp; It was unbelievable.&nbsp; It appeared to be a
male, but very pale.&nbsp; His eyes were wide open and you could see
his teeth smiling.&nbsp; It almost glowed in the darkness.&nbsp; We
were both in shock as we literally peeled out of the cemetery.&nbsp; <br>
I haven't gone back since.&nbsp; This was absolutely the scariest moment in my life.&nbsp; This summary doesn't do it justice.<br>
By the way - The other story in Watertown, CT with the suicide was in
1992.&nbsp; His father was incredibly tough on him.&nbsp; It's a shame.<br>

Haunted House<br>
<br>
By: wid2rz@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
When I lived in the house in Morrisonville, it was noticeably haunted.
Sometimes we would hear heavy boots on the stairs, or voices of a party
of men discussing and women haggling, and mischievous laughter.
According to a now deceased old timer in the town, who told my partner,
it used to be a brothel at the turn of the 1900's and earlier. On
occasion, my partner or I would feel the light touch of a hand on our
backs or shoulders, and at times would smell a strong scent of roses
near the bottom of the stairs. There have been incidents where the
"ghostly occupants" would actually fondle my partner or myself, much to
our amazement, and most notably one time a guest sleeping in another
room rushed out late at night, obviously just awakened, accusing
someone of "playing with (her) goodies". My partner and I couldn't help
but to giggle and tell her about the haunting.<br>
There were other times we were awakened late at night by friends
leaving the bar, wondering why we had not invited them to "our party."
My partner would answer the door at these odd intrusions, still half
asleep, and inquire as to the reason for waking him. The "offended"
friend would say they could hear the loud music, see lights and forms
through the windows, and wonder why they weren't invited.<br>
The key seems to be, they are active when there is a flurry of sexual
energies and activities in the household, but hide quietly throughout
times without these stimuli present.<br>

Haunted House Addition for Ohio<br>
<br>
By: kimandlilyv@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
there is a house on Prospect Upper Sandusky Road South outside of green
camp ohio that is haunted by the ghost of the evil person who is buried
on the property.&nbsp; The grave is right beside the house (on the
right side if you are looking at the house from the street.&nbsp; The
story is that this person was so evil they put a white fence around his
grave and a planted a tree at all four corners of the grave to keep him
in it!&nbsp; <br>
The house has a two toned doorbell when you ring it both tones will go
off, if you slam the door the second tone only will go off.&nbsp; There
are times when if you are sitting in the front room you will hear the
door slam and the tone go off even though you are looking at the door
and nothing happened!&nbsp; ALso if you are sitting in the front room
reading you will feel someone walk past you quickly.&nbsp; My brother
and I used to live there as children/teenagers.&nbsp; I distinctly
remember a few different times when we were in that room on the couch
reading and would both look up startled at the exact same time by the
"ghost" as he walked past us! <br>
The ghost has also been known to knock/tap on the window of the front
bedroom (no trees or bushes near it that could have done the persistent
tapping).<br>
Also anyone walking or playing close to the grave that is on the property will get nauseated and have to back away!<br>
these are all things that have happened to me when i lived there between 1985-1992 <br>

My encounters with the supernatural<br>
Brooklyn, New York<br>
<br>
By: bayviewboy@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
My first encounter with the supernatural happened when I was just a
toddler. My parents and I were living in a small apartment on the first
floor of an old two-story house in Brooklyn, New York. I remembered
being in a crib and looking at the wall opposite my crib. I could see
something that appeared to be a window to another world. I could see a
beautiful landscape of green grass and trees and rolling hills with
people walking around. I would see this on separate occasions. I cannot
remember any specific details or who the people were but they would be
moving around this landscape continuously. I don&#8217;t remember feeling any
fear from what I was seeing. When I related this to my mother as an
adult she said that now she knew why I was always pointing to that
wall. To this day I can find no explanation for what I saw and why.<br>
As a teenager living in a three-story brownstone house on Bergen Street
I remember one night being wakened up and hearing my mother choking in
bed. She was trying to tell us that she could feel two ghostly hands
trying to choke her to death. As she struggled with this unseen force
she would kick and try to scream. My father being an ordained minister
at the time started to fervently pray out loud over her and after what
seemed an eternity the unseen hands let my mother&#8217;s throat go and my
mother was able to breathe and calm down. We later learned that a woman
who was renting a small room upstairs had her room full of all kinds of
idols, candles and occultic paraphernalia. Needless to say she was
politely asked to move the next day. <br>
Puerto Rico<br>
As a pre-teen I occasionally would take trips to Puerto Rico with my
mother to visit my grandmother and aunt. They lived in a small country
mountain community called Monte Bello which in English means &#8220;beautiful
mountain&#8221;. One night I stayed at my aunt&#8217;s house and slept on a couch
in the living room. The house was mostly made of wood and faced a main
road. The couch I slept on was very near the front door of the house.
All of a sudden in the middle of the night I was awakened by noises of
chairs being moved in the kitchen. Everybody was asleep and the only
other two people in the house were my aunt and cousin. The noises
stopped and I quickly went off to sleep again. I then was awakened one
more time to noises of chairs being moved around. This time the sound
was coming from the front porch of the house. I remember peeping
through a small hole in the door leading to the front porch and seeing
no one out there. The next few nights I started getting these asthma
attacks that didn&#8217;t go away until I left Puerto Rico. <br>
Viet Nam<br>
I was stationed in a little support base in the mountains of&nbsp; Duc
Pho way up north of South Vietnam. I worked in the Colonel&#8217;s mess hall
that prepared meals for the officers of the base. It was part of the
Jungle Brigade of the Americal Division. It was an infantry unit that
had helicopter support for troops going out on patrol. We lived in what
were called &#8220;hootches&#8221; surrounded by piles and piles of sandbags for
protection from incoming rockets and mortars. It seemed like a ghost or
malevolent being was haunting our compound. There would be shadowy
figures lurking around, reports of rapping&#8217;s, whispers and things that
went bump in the night. On one occasion as I was taking a shower in one
of the stalls I heard someone come in the door, turn on one of the
showers but when I went to look around there was no one there.&nbsp; We
were in total darkness when we saw this white glow in the shape of a
person hovering above the table. Needless to say everyone ran out of
there except for one soldier who was having a conversation with his
&#8220;dearly departed mother&#8221;. With all the death and dying and pagan
religions of that area it was no surprise that these manifestations
occurred on a regular basis.<br>
San Antonio, Texas<br>
While living in San Antonio I worked for a group called the Criminal
Justice Information System. This group developed a system that was
similar to the NCIC Criminal Justice Information System used on a
national basis. I had been assigned to the county jail to code
information from the files of the identification section onto the
computer. I later trained new people on this coding system in an old
building across from the Bexar County Courthouse. This building was
known as the Legal Professional building which in the 1920&#8217;s used to be
a police station. One day as we were taking a break from the class I
remember sitting at a desk and my hand suddenly took a life of its own
and grabbed a pen that was nearby. It started writing under its own
power on this sheet of paper. It wrote only one word: &#8220;MANGEL&#8221;. To this
day I don&#8217;t know what the word meant and have found no one that did.
Perhaps it had something to do with the history of this old building.
After this I never had another bout of automatic handwriting.<br>
Vineland, New Jersey<br>
One day while living on East Avenue in our old house we were watching a
special program on Hollywood ghosts in our basement. This part of the
show was featuring the hosts of the show with some guests in a live
s&eacute;ance. Apparently they were trying to conjure up some old
Hollywood ghosts. All of a sudden we heard this crashing popping noise
come from upstairs. We all ran up the stairs to find that one of the
bulbs in one of the lamps in the living room had burst. There were
pieces of glass all over the place. I later read that this is usually a
sign of Poltergeist activity. Somehow by watching that show it opened
up a doorway to demonic forces. We never again watched this type of
show in our house.<br>
On another occasion I came home from work around 1:30 in the morning.
Everyone was asleep and I had the habit of lighting a scented candle in
the dining room. We had a small dog that slept in the kitchen adjacent
to the dining room and sometimes his scent drifted into the dining
room. Well after I lit the candle I went downstairs to my room to take
my clothes off and prepare for a shower. When I walked through the
dining room I noticed the candle was no longer lit. I thought maybe it
was a draft coming into the dining room that blew it out. This was an
old house and was very drafty. I proceeded to light the candle again
and went to the bathroom to take a shower. When I was done with my
shower and came through the dining room again the candle was no longer
lit. So not thinking about anything I lit the candle again and went
downstairs. I came upstairs again and lo and behold the candle was out
again. I finally gave up lighting the candle and said to myself that
someone or something didn&#8217;t want that candle lit. So after that day I
never lit another candle during the night again.<br>
One day in the same house I was outside doing something in the yard and
I remember standing just outside of one of the dining room windows when
all of a sudden I hear a woman call me by my childhood name that only
my mother and wife knew. The voice was as clear as if someone had been
standing right beside me or in the window. I turned around and saw no
one. My mother lives in Florida and my wife wasn&#8217;t home.<br>
Another time I was half awake in bed in the bedroom in the basement and
I had my left foot exposed. I felt someone very gently touch my big toe
with their thumb and forefinger. When I looked up there was no one
there.<br>
Minnesota<br>
My wife Julie was the one that experienced what I&#8217;m about to relate to
you but since I was in the same room I decided to include this
too.&nbsp; It was on a bus trip that we took with a local church group
that we had this experience. We were visiting the Mall of America and
we were staying at the Thunderbird Inn motel. The theme and decor was
all Native American and it was located right across from the mall. Well
one night as I was sleeping soundly my wife who was in the next bed
with my daughter said she felt someone sit down on the edge of the bed
on her side. She thought that my daughter or me had gotten up for some
reason and sat next to her. To my wife&#8217;s surprise we were both in bed
fast asleep. As she looked in the direction of where that someone was
sitting what she saw horrified her. She saw this black thing sitting on
the edge of the bed. She described it as a shadowy black hooded figure.
My wife being a devout Christian blurted out the name of Jesus. No
sooner had she said this that the figure got up and just went right
through the door (without opening it). Needless to say it took her a
long time to fall asleep after that even with the lights on the rest of
the night.&nbsp; <br>

I lived in a house&nbsp;&nbsp; it a yellow house. My children and I
have experenced thing in this house. I lived there for 11 months and
the neighbors told me I was the longest person the stay in the house.
Neighbor's that have lived in the area for a while told me some time in
1996 that a woman was murdered by her husband, it is said that in the
middle of the night he ran upstair and chased his wife out of the
bedroom with a knife and killed her in the back room as she tried to
flee out the back door. While I lived there one night around 3am
between april and june I cant recall the exact month I was awoken by
heavy feet running up the stair. I really started me and I just yelled
get the F*** out of my house and then it got real quite it took my
several minutes to compose myself. I grabbed a screw driver and started
making a sweep of my house to make sure no one had broken in. I went
down stairs all the doors were still locked and windows also and my
children were still asleep since there were scared to sleep in there
own rooms they always slept with me. There was no one else in the house
but the 3 of us. There were times that my kids and me would be
downstairs and we would here this heavy thumps upstairs in my sons room
as if something was thrown to the ground and afer checking the room out
nothing would be out of order. In the bathroom on the right hand side
of the tub from the corner of your eye you can see a bright white light
but when you face the light it stops and when you turn your head away
from it again the light continues until you look again. In the attic
you have a feeling of being watched. Just like when your alone in the
living room you get the same feeling. There is something in the house
that is unexplainable. After I moved out I went back to clean the house
and while scrubbing the floor the door leading to the back room started
to shake as if someone was trying to open it. That was all it took and
I just left and haven't step foot back in that house. It had been 2 and
1/2 years since I lived there but I drive past the house every once and
a while and every six months the house is up for rent again. No one
ever stays long.<br>
In conclusion my daughter was 1 and half and refused to walk in that
house she was terrified to even stand if you attempted to put her on
her feet she would scream all while looking behind you. But when she
was at other people house away from that place she would practice her
walking less then a week after moving out of that house and living in
my new place my daughter was walking and running. Something is in that
house I wanted to leave a warning note for the new tenants I knew would
be moving in but I was afraid the management company would persue legal
actions against me. In the day time the house feels peaceful but once
it's dark there is a uneasy feeling there.<br>

Personal Experiences<br>
<br>
By: jeanette@nyfreightliner.com<br>
<br>
<br>
Hello.&nbsp; I love your site. I&#8217;ve read many of the stories and decided to write you on my many experiences. <br>
1st experience:&nbsp;&nbsp; My first encounter with the unknown was
when I was pregnant with my first child.&nbsp; My husband and I stood
over my parent&#8217;s house because it was a snowy night and very bad to
drive.&nbsp; My husband and I were sleeping in my old room which was
between the living room and my sister&#8217;s room.&nbsp; The apartment was a
railroad apartment, meaning that the set up of all the rooms were
straight.&nbsp; If standing in the kitchen with all doors open, you can
see the entire apartment. <br>
Well, for some reason I opened my eyes.&nbsp; It must have been around
5am.&nbsp; I began to hear footsteps in the room walking back and forth
from the living room into my room.&nbsp; At first I thought it was my
dad because he usually got up to check the locks on the doors and the
stove, etc.&nbsp; This thing continued to walk back and forth and
violently and loudly lock and unlock the locks on the living room
door.&nbsp; It will then walk through my room and do the same&nbsp;
with the lock on my door that led to my sister&#8217;s room. (My husband
closed the door before we fell asleep).&nbsp; I was petrified because
the footsteps did not sound like my dad&#8217;s.&nbsp; My dad where&#8217;s
slippers and these footsteps sounded like bare wet feet.&nbsp; Almost
like a slapping sound every time it would walk by.&nbsp; This continued
for about 5 times.&nbsp; <br>
I tried pinching my husband to wake him but nothing worked.&nbsp; The
way I was lying in the bed, on my side, my back was towards where the
noise was coming from not that I would have turned around or opened my
eyes to look anyway.&nbsp; I was very afraid.&nbsp; All of a sudden the
noises stopped and I felt someone right next to me.&nbsp; About 5
seconds later, that something let out a big screech right in my
ear!&nbsp; I jumped a bit but refused to open my eyes.&nbsp; That was
the last of this thing.&nbsp; Thankfully I did not experience anything
that close again. That was really scary. <br>
2nd experience:&nbsp; At this same apartment my parents used to tell me
that they would wake up to a very loud noise coming from my sister&#8217;s
room. They described the noise as the closet falling over. That&#8217;s how
loud the sound was.&nbsp; <br>
3rd experience:&nbsp; My sis and I were up pretty late one night joking
around.&nbsp; We were on her top bunk when all of a sudden we heard the
faucet in the kitchen turn on by itself.&nbsp; At first it was very low
and faint but then it sounded like whatever turned on the faucet had
turned it on all the way.&nbsp; We freaked out and stood very
still.&nbsp; The faucet then shut off by itself and we forced ourselves
to sleep.&nbsp; We were so shaken up that we didn&#8217;t dare leave the bed
to run into our parents&#8217; room and tell them what had just
occurred.&nbsp; That night we both slept on the top bunk.&nbsp; <br>
4th experience:&nbsp; My husband had started a job that required him to
work nights 3 days a week, this was one of those nights.&nbsp; It was a
Halloween night.&nbsp; My son and I were on his bed watching a movie on
television called &#8220;Bats.&#8221;&nbsp; First of all, I was already afraid of
being home all alone at night but especially on Halloween and watching
a scary movie didn&#8217;t help me much.&nbsp; Well, my son fell asleep and I
remained on his bed watching this movie.&nbsp; All of a sudden I hear a
loud knock coming from the wall in front of me.&nbsp; It was very loud
as if someone was in the room with me.&nbsp; I became paralyzed with
fear because that was something I just could not explain at all.&nbsp;
I don&#8217;t know how but after about 2 minutes or so I found the courage to
get up and walk towards the wall to take a look behind it.&nbsp; There
was nothing there, not that I expected something to be there and boy
and I glad there wasn&#8217;t.&nbsp; I was petrified of being home alone
after that.&nbsp; <br>
5th experience:&nbsp; These are recent events.&nbsp; My parents-in-law
decided to move away to their mother land and my husband and I decided
to continue to pay their mortgage and take care of their house.&nbsp;
From the very first day that my mom and aunt helped us move in, they
both said that my house creeped them out.&nbsp; They never really gave
a reason other than they just felt weird there.&nbsp; Due to my past
experiences, hearing this from them was not comforting at all.&nbsp; A
few months after my husband and I decided to buy the kids a
puppy.&nbsp; We brought the puppy home and from day one my puppy was
freaking out!&nbsp; He constantly barked at the walls and stood on top
of the steps looking down and barking like mad.&nbsp; The way he barked
scared us all because he showed all his teeth and grew really mean at
whatever it was he was barking at.&nbsp; Every time he acted this way
we would tell him to relax and that it was okay.&nbsp; It took months
before he grew calmer towards whatever he was seeing.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure he
sees things we cant see.&nbsp; He still barks from time to time.&nbsp;
There have been incidences where we are asleep and he&#8217;ll wake up and
bark or get up leave the room running towards the step and then
downstairs, almost as if he is following something.&nbsp; <br>
6th experience:&nbsp; This happened recently, I would say about 5
months ago.&nbsp; My husband and I were just getting home from shopping
one Sunday afternoon.&nbsp; The kids were not at home.&nbsp; My husband
put the key in the first door and opened it.&nbsp; I was right behind
him.&nbsp; He stepped one foot into the entrance of the house when we
heard &#8220;Johnny.&#8221;&nbsp; We both stopped &#8230; dead in our tracks!&nbsp; It
sounded like our daughter calling our son!&nbsp; The voice was loud and
very clear and it definitely came from inside the house or from right
in front of us.&nbsp; We looked at each other and said &#8220;Did you hear
that?&#8221;&nbsp; We both agreed that it sounded just like our girl.&nbsp;
It was our daughter&#8217;s voice to the T!&nbsp; It was so real and so clear
and loud that he walked right in saying, &#8220;is someone in here? Guys&#8230; is
that you?&#8221;&nbsp; He thought that our kids had come home.&nbsp; There
was absolutely no one here.&nbsp; As he continued to ask if someone was
in the house I told him that there was no one there.&nbsp; That what we
heard was not the kids.&nbsp; Ever since this happened I have grown
very afraid of being home alone or getting up in the middle of the
night to use the restroom.&nbsp; I have also become very concerned with
the kids especially my son.&nbsp; I have no idea as to why that voice
said my son&#8217;s name.&nbsp; That was really scary for me.&nbsp; I have
consistently said to my husband that I feel like there is something in
the house.&nbsp;&nbsp; The channel on the cable box in our bedroom has
changed on its own a few times throughout the years.&nbsp; It actually
happened the other night.&nbsp; I came back from the bathroom and a
movie was playing that I didnt request.&nbsp; He likes to blame it on
the dog but I know its not that our dog is stepping on the
remote.&nbsp; Also, a few weeks ago I sent my son to the basement to
put away the dog&#8217;s toys.&nbsp; He ran upstairs like his butt was on
fire.&nbsp; He told me that right before he closed the door he heard a
screech directly in his ear.&nbsp;&nbsp; I refuse to go down there
alone.&nbsp; I always get a creepy feeling when I&#8217;m down there.&nbsp;
If you can come up with a reason as to why my son&#8217;s name was said by
this spirit or whatever&#8230;. Please let me know.&nbsp; That experience is
with me every day.&nbsp; <br>
Thanks for letting me share my stories.&nbsp; I have a few more but
these were the only ones I could think of right now.&nbsp; And
please.... feel free to post on your site.&nbsp; It's great to know
that people arent alone.&nbsp; :-)<br>

My story starts October 11, 1996.&nbsp; My older brother, Jason, was
with a friend celebrating his 21 birthday.&nbsp; On the way home the
friend lost control of the vehicle and hit a telephone pole killing my
brother.&nbsp; Since that day weird things have happened.&nbsp; It
started a couple years later at my parents house.&nbsp; We had this
game that we used to play alot and it would just all of a sudden turn
on.&nbsp; The TV would go on and off all by itself.&nbsp; My Aunt who
was very close to my brother had a very strange dream just a couple
days after bringing her newborn home from the hospital.&nbsp; In it my
brother visited her just so he could check on the new baby.&nbsp; It
felt so real to her that she moved her bedroom to the downstairs of her
house.&nbsp; I never really thought much of these little incidents
until just a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp; I was working midnights and in
the morning after working all night I was taking my daughters out to my
mom and dads to visit and so I could get some sleep.&nbsp; Well about
15 minutes into the trip I could feel myself getting sleepy.&nbsp; Of
course I had the radio on and doing everything in my power not to fall
asleep.&nbsp; Well I felt myself doze off just then my radio blared
really loud waking me up.&nbsp; When I looked there was a truck coming
the opposite direction.&nbsp; My radio returned to normal for the rest
of the trip.&nbsp; When I gathered myself I looked over to the
passenger seat and simply said "Thank you Jason."&nbsp; Thanks for
reading my story.&nbsp; <br>

My Annoying Puzzling and Sometimes Helpful Earthbound Spirit<br>
<br>
By: deborah_giraud@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I spent my teenage years in&nbsp; Atlanta, Ga and had several
experiences both at home and at a friend's house.&nbsp; One day my
friend Lynn called me and asked if I would spend the night, as the
household was having strange events for the past couple of days, ever
since her father had been in the hospital.&nbsp; Her two siblings also
had invited friends over so there were 6 or 7 teenagers and her mother
in the house.&nbsp; It started sometime after dark -- banging around
the house as if someone was striking the house with something.&nbsp; It
kept up for hours.&nbsp; Also, her glass door in the carport was struck
every 2-3 minutes for hours, but nothing there - nothing on the ground,
no visual sighting through the glass of anything.&nbsp; That was the
last experience I had for many, many years until approximately 1982
when I was living in Santa Monica, CA.&nbsp; I lived in a very small
single apartment on 17th Street and across the way lived an old man by
the name of Jamie.&nbsp; He was a "bag man", old, decrepit and
lonely.&nbsp; I felt badly for him and would bring him groceries (after
he died they found several bank accounts totalling more than $150,000
in his apartment).&nbsp; He would bring me things that he found in the
trash - an old purse, a hat, a pair of shoes, etc.&nbsp; I always
thanked him nicely and threw them away somewhere else later.&nbsp; The
day after Jamie died I came home and found an old dirty red sash
hanging over my towel rack in the bathroom - just the sort of thing
Jamie would give me.&nbsp; That was the beginning of my long treck with
what I believe to be the earth-bound spirit of Jamie.&nbsp; He comes
and goes - sometimes he's gone for several years and then he comes
back.&nbsp; He follows me from house to house - even to the grocery
store (I'll explain that one further on in this strange
narrative).&nbsp; <br>
I left my little single apartment in Santa Monica shortly thereafter
and moved to a bigger apartment in West L.A.&nbsp; I lived there for
four years and had one truly inexplicable experience.&nbsp; I was
sitting on my sofa watching T.V. and next to my right leg sat my
cat.&nbsp; All of a sudden I felt something wet and warm enter my right
leg, exit it and then enter and exit my left leg.&nbsp; I would say
that perhaps it was my imagination except for the fact that my cat
freaked out.&nbsp; She flew to the other side of the room, sat there
with her teeth bared, hissed and her fur stood up.&nbsp; She would not
come near me nor the sofa for at least an hour.&nbsp; <br>
I next moved to a house in Culver City and got a roommate.&nbsp; I had
several things happen during the four years I lived there - nothing as
unusual or creepy as the warm, wet experience, but still
puzzling.&nbsp; I came home one day and found dirt spread all over my
kitchen floor - actual dirt from the yard.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another day my
roommate knocked on my door at 7:00 a.m. asking if I had taken his keys
from the table which he had left there the night before.&nbsp; I had
not taken them.&nbsp; I then found them in the very bottom of my
laundry basket in my room.&nbsp; Things would go missing and then show
up in a completely different place.<br>
I then moved to San Diego and lived in a rented house for about 1-1/2
years - no experiences whatsoever.&nbsp; I then bought a house with my
new husband and about two years after we moved in it started again and
has only stopped for several months at a time.&nbsp; One day I was at
home alone and I smelled dog poop.&nbsp; I looked everywhere for it and
could not find it.&nbsp; My nose eventually lead me to an antique
dresser.&nbsp; I pulled it away from the wall and there on the floor
under the dresser all the way in the back near the baseboard was a huge
pile of very smelly and wet dog poop.&nbsp; The space under the dresser
is no more than 5 inches, if that.&nbsp; No dog put that there.&nbsp;
It is a mystery that has never been solved.&nbsp; He loves stealing
things - sometimes gives them back - mostly not.&nbsp; One day he took
my wallet.&nbsp; I thought it had been stolen - had to call the bank,
cancel my credit cards, debit cards, close my accounts.&nbsp; Three
days later I opened up the drawer that I keep my ipod in to go work out
and there sat my wallet - the same drawer that I had been in at least
five or six times since my wallet disappeared.&nbsp; I thanked him for
giving it back and asked him if he was going to take anything in the
future that it not be something as important as my wallet or
money.&nbsp; He has done a few helpful things.&nbsp; One night I awoke
around 3:00 a.m. and remembered that I had left a pot of chicken parts
cooking on the stove for my dog.&nbsp; I jumped up to turn it off and
it had been turned off already - the pot was still extremely hot so it
had not been turned off for long.&nbsp; I thanked my husband the next
morning for turning off the pot and he said "huh - what pot?"&nbsp;
Most of the experiences I have with him are mundane - no levitating
objects, shadows, scary sounds - I'm actually not afraid of him at
all.&nbsp; I feel he is totally harmless - just a practical joker who
likes to stir things up.&nbsp; Except for one night.&nbsp; I was sound
asleep in bed and I felt something tap my forehead three times.&nbsp; I
woke up screaming telling my husband that something had touched my
forehead.&nbsp; He told me I was dreaming and to go back to
sleep.&nbsp; I said I was not dreaming.&nbsp; I still felt the sting on
my forehead.&nbsp; He's never touched me again - maybe he realized that
it scared me too much.&nbsp; <br>
One day i went to the grocery store.&nbsp; I got my cart (which was
empty) and proceeded to shop.&nbsp; I went to the checkout counter and
started to unload my basket and there sat two items that I had not put
in my basket.&nbsp; He must really like cherry tomatoes.&nbsp; One day
he turned the T.V. on in my daughter's room 4 times during the night
while she was asleep.&nbsp; One night around 3:00 a.m. I was up,
couldn't sleep.&nbsp; And all of a sudden the smell of rotten eggs
(sewage smell) just surrounded me.&nbsp; I was in the living room away
from any pipes.&nbsp; It lasted about 10 seconds and was gone - I have
never smelled it again.&nbsp; He's taken the socks right off my feet
while I was sleeping - never to be seen again.&nbsp; He's even stolen
temporary fillings out of my mouth.&nbsp; This is one of the more
bizzare and inexplicable events,&nbsp; I had to go to the dentist and
have two crowns installed.&nbsp; I hate dentists and took a sleeping
pill to get through the procedure.&nbsp; I came home and went to
bed.&nbsp; I woke about two hours later and felt with my tongue what
had been done to my teeth.&nbsp; Both molars were hollowed out with
nothing in them.&nbsp; The teeth were sharp and kept cutting my lip
everytime I chewed.&nbsp; Terrible food trap.&nbsp; My husband told me
I should go back to the dentist and have it fixed and I said no way
I'll wait the two weeks until the permanent crowns are in.&nbsp; I went
back to the dentist and he said "Oh your temporary crowns fell
out"&nbsp; I told him I didn't have any temporary crowns and he said of
course you did.&nbsp; We argued back and forth and he finally put his
foot down and said of course we put the temporary crowns in, we would
never let you go out the door like that.&nbsp; I decided to stop
arguing with him and then I thought back to the procedure and I
remembered him putting them in.&nbsp; They just disappeared.&nbsp; I
didn't swallow them or break them - nothing whatsoever to indicate that
those temporary crowns were ever in my mouth.&nbsp; <br>
Well, that's about it.&nbsp; I left out a bunch more mundane
stuff.&nbsp; I would love to hear from anyone who has experienced
anything that might resemble what I've been going through.&nbsp; Thanks

Haunted House<br>
<br>
By: denisehlee@mac.com<br>
<br>
I read your account of living in a haunted house with much interest.<br>
In 1999 I bought a large Victorian House in Wiltshire, I had owned two
old houses previously and was well adversed in dealing with just "plain
old ghosts" which I had never found to be a particular problem<br>
and in fact found that they even seemed to add a certain ambience to the place.<br>
But on buying this place things were much different, the House was in
need of considerable refurbishment, and quite soon after moving in, I
realised that I was dealing with an entirely different type of entity.<br>
The House was divided into 4 levels, with the basement in particular a big problem, but also the attic rooms.<br>
The basement had two definite spirits, one you could actually see, as a
black incarnation, hovering near the inner connecting door, this was
quite easy to shift, but the other was very powerful.<br>
It was not Human and despite spending 7 years trying to shift it,
including smudging, smoking, prayers, water spraying and even enlisting
the help of a member of the Healer and Medium society<br>
who wrongly assured me the House was clear, all these things failed and
so after being spiritually and physically drained, I found that the
spirit together with the stress of doing the work were<br>
beginning to take a toll on my health.<br>
In the attic the "hauntings" were limited to just turning off the
lights and seeing horrible and disfigured faced looming out of the dark
continuously (I was not the only one to experience this)<br>
I know this sounds rather imaginative, but I can assure you was quite real.<br>
Anyway after suffering from Chronic Fatigue and Fibromyalgia in 2006, I was forced to sell the place.<br>
Which actually has come as somewhat of a relief!!<br>
I truly believe that if I hadn't sold the place, that it would of put me in an early grave.<br>

A Tale to Tell,<br>
<br>
By: erte4879@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
Read all these great stories thought I would include one myself:<br>
I was always, to a fault, interested in ghostly matters. Even if it
cost me my sleep and reason. I was one of those kids that begged their
Grandmother (a Mexican Grandmother to boot, for those that don't know,
they have some WHOPPER ghost stories to tell! Let me tell you!!) to
tell another story despite my Mother's wishes to the contrary. I don't
blame her protesting, since she was the one who's bedroom &amp; sleep I
would invade when I got the inevitable "willies."<br>
Anyways, it was well known our house in Mexico, especially the second
story and the animal quarters/stables (which were never used passed the
early 60's) were inhabited by something other-wordly. Stories abounded,
almost every family memeber had a tale to tell. I had none. Maybe one
odd event, but nothing to shout about at all. Even our home here in Los
Angeles gives people the "vibes" of being spooky. Years later my
friends would tell me just why I was never able to have a successful
slumber party. No one ever came because it gave them the spooks. I
loved that house and never thought it was strange. I guess I was just
used to it. Sure my Mother thought she saw a man with a starched white
shirt once in my bedroom, big deal. Sure, I ran into a green light
coming down my dark hallway one night as I hurried to get ready, so
what! Those don't count.<br>
I<br>
'll get to the real story now:<br>
Right out of high school, I graduated in 1997, my friends (Trevor &amp;
Feliks) and I decided to take a little weekend/road trip. It was either
'97 or '98 that we took this trip. We decided on San Felipe. A small
fishing village just 8 hours from Los Angeles on the edge of the Sea of
Cortez in beautiful Mexico.<br>
Our reasons were purely immature and superficial. There we could drink at bars! Not 21 yet you know.<br>
So off we go. We get there and rent a room in this very small motel,
just off the main drag. You went up these steps and the door to the
room was to the right. If you face the door to the room on the
immediate right was a large window. That was our only window, save for
a small one in the bathroom. <br>
Now upon opening the door to the room you see immediately on the right
against the wall with the large window the first bed. Next to that bed
farther back was a nighstand with a lamp, farther back the other bed.
Against that bed was a wall to the restroom. Small but adequate.<br>
Boy did we have a blast and then some!!!<br>
The second night of our young revelry we go up to our room ready to
call it a much overdue night. Well, rip roaring Feliks was not having
it! He still had more party in him! Against our better wishes and
utilizing Trev's and my exhaustion he got his way. Off he went into the
remaining night, like a real trooper.<br>
I had called the bed by the front wall with the window when we had first checked in so I plopped myself on that.<br>
Trevor plopped himself on the one by the bathroom he was supposed to
share with Feliks, well that hadn't worked out as planned and we
banished him to the sofa-bed in front of the restroom on the count of
his horrendous snoring.<br>
So there we lay, I kept telling Trev. about how I was a little worried
about Feliks out there by himself. That maybe we should go find him.<br>
Instead we both knocked out.<br>
Fast forward a couple of hours!<br>
For whatever reason I wake up from the veritable realm of the dead.
Ladies and Gents I was passed out! I open my eyes. I can just start to
see that weird purple-y light the night takes on like 2 hours before
daylight coming through the curtains. Like the sun's is coming but it's
still considered night. You know, what I'm talking about, I know you do.<br>
Any how, that light was coming through the very slightly opened
curtain.&nbsp; Curtain just parted&nbsp; ever so slightly. As I was on
my left side facing the window I could see it quite clearly, my eyes
having adjusted to the lights poor quality.<br>
I was on my left side but curled a little in bed so my vista was the
window/curtain and down towards the foot of the bed and the door.<br>
That's when I saw him.<br>
It was the dark sillhouette of a man, about our age. 18/19/20ish. It
was like one of those sillhouettes that our Aunts and young Mothers had
done in the 70's, when they were teenagers that you frame up and put in
your hallway or photo album. With the eye-lashes and everything. You
know what I mean? A perfect side sillhouette of his face, head, and
neck. No hint of color. Looking out the window. He had short hair.<br>
I'm watching him look out the window. Very still, not moving an inch. I
got the impression he was waiting intently for something. He didn't
move at all, he was a veritable statue!<br>
He didn't look at me. I looked at him looking out. He wasn't holding the curtains, just looking out of the part in them.<br>
I'm thinking this whole time it's Trevor looking out the window waiting
for Feliks to come rolling in from his drinking and galavanting. I was
sure it was! <br>
Felik's was/is a big guy, rowdy too, we would have definately heard him
come in. We would have heard his snoring for sure! Trust me!!<br>
So I lay there watching Trev. wait for Feliks. He probably had gotten
as worried as I was afterall. I was JUST about to ask him what time it
was........<br>
Then I hear it.<br>
I hear this soft rhythmic breathing from behind me. From the bed behind me.<br>
It's Trevor sleeping. He's doing that breathing people do when they're sleeping, not snoring, just sleep breathing. You know.<br>
Um, if that's Trevor......then who is this looking out the window at the foot of my bed?!<br>
I lay, I think, I do this over calculated lighting quick roll to my right to turn on the lamp on the nightstand.<br>
On it flicks! I whip back around.........and nothing.<br>
Just a window and a door.<br>
I turn around towards Trevor and I see him squinting at me from his bed.<br>
"Trevor, where you looking out of the window just now?"<br>
"Uh, no."<br>
Just then, as if on perfect timing Feliks stumbles in drunker than a goldfish in a vodka bottle and say's, er slurrs out:<br>
"What are you guys doing still up!?"<br>
Ladies and Gentlemen I didn't sleep a wink after that!<br>
I am speaking the God honest truth that this happened.<br>
Never miss a thing. Make Yahoo your homepage.<br>

Ellison/Stewart Home<br>
<br>
By: Juanita_Harrison6@MSN.COM <br>
<br>
<br>
We bought two houses on one lot about 5 years ago to restore.&nbsp;
During that time we have had several encounters with unusual visitors
and strange happening.&nbsp; When working in the dirt basement on the
house at the back of the lot my my husband heard footsteps and someone
taking to his dog.&nbsp; He immediately came out, it has a outside
entrance by the door to the house and went in.&nbsp; The dog was alone
looking at the door.&nbsp; No one could have gotten in or out either
door without being seen.&nbsp; This small house is said to have been
moved to Green River from either an old mining or railroad settlement
that was closed down in about 1900 to 1910.&nbsp; It was common at that
time to buy one of these small houses for about fifty dollars, and live
in them while building a larger home on the front of the lot.&nbsp;
Since finishing the small house we haven't had any more visits.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The front and larger home is still not done but it
has been many strange goings on.&nbsp; I, myself had been looking at
the back of the house during the day and saw a man looking out what use
to be the second floor back porch.&nbsp; I looked away for a second and
he was gone.&nbsp; I went through the entire home never found
anyone.&nbsp; The construction lights in the attic turn on during the
night.&nbsp; The neighbor has mentioned it to us but we have never
found any sign that anyone has gotten into the home. My son and I were
leaving the house one evening, we had together&nbsp; turned off the
kitchen lights, it was dark in the house, as we went downstairs to the
back door.&nbsp; We spoke for a minute in the door way.&nbsp; As we
were waking away I turned to look back at the house and the kitchen
light was on.&nbsp; We also have found power tools sitting on the floor
running, .&nbsp; My husband has even unplugged them and found the
plugged in and running on the next visit.&nbsp; Many people have heard
a dog walking upstairs when our dog is not there.&nbsp; I have to say
that it isn't a scary feeling place just seems like it has some unusual
visitors&nbsp; Thanks <br>
PS although something seems to like to play with the power tools I have never gotten them to do any work.&nbsp; <br>

Ghosts and Angels<br>
<br>
By: jdmarinkovic@student.ysu.edu<br>
<br>
Ever since I was little, I have had things happen to me. I have seen
things, I have heard things, and I have felt things. My mother said
when I was a child that I didn't have to go outside and play with the
other kids, and that I was completely content with using my
imagination. It wasn't like I didn't go out and play with other kids, I
just had a very vivid imagination. I guess that it is safe to say that
is when I was just a toddler things were going on. When I was about 3
or 4 years old is when it all started. <br>
We used to live in a double wide trailer, and I remember I would get up
in the middle of the night screaming. I would walk down the hall to my
mom and dad's room and just lay in front of the door, screaming and
crying for them to help me. I remember feeling like I was being watched
or followed. It got so bad that I used to hate sleeping in my room,
because my closet always seemed to have light in it, when in fact there
was no light in my closet. Imagine waking up in the middle of the
night, finding your son sleeping in front of your bed room door. It got
to the point where my mom and dad would let me sleep with them, this
went on, sad to say, up until I was about 6 1/2 years old. They finally
got me a water bed, which is what they had. They felt that if they got
me a water bed that I would sleep in my own room. It worked! But that
was just the start of it, that was the start of something that would
last for the next 20 years. <br>
Things really didn't happen after that, because half the reason that my
parents bought me a bed was because my mom at the time was pregnant
with my little brother. She said that it was time that I started to act
like a big boy, and just sleep in my own bed. <br>
Finally in 1994 my little brother was born and I think he kept the bad
things, or ghosts away because he would cry all night, real late at
night. I remember I used to lay in my bed, and just say to myself,
"please cry, please just until I fall asleep." <br>
Then in 1997 we moved out of the trailer, and into a big house just a
few blocks away. Up to this point nothing had been happening. I liked
the idea of getting out of that trailer, because a few years later my
father told me things that happened to him there too, but that is for
another time. We had moved into this new house, it was owned by a lady
who's husband just died. He didn't die in the house, but the fact that
he had just died scared me. <br>
Things were pretty good for a few years, then in 2000 my grandmother
died of lung cancer. I would have to say that this is where things
really took off. After she died I started to have horrible dreams that
she was chasing me. It was grandmother, but at the same time it wasn't
my grandmother. Something had been different. The whole family would
smell her brand of cigarettes in the house in certain places. I saw her
one night standing in the doorway to my house, and she looked so evil. <br>
I told my uncle about all of this, the smell, the dreams and seeing her
as well. He told me to go to her grave and tell her about these things
and tell her that I wanted them to stop. I thought that this was
insane, and he told me that if I did it, it would work. The next day he
took me to her grave, I sat down and told her about everything. Ever
since then, the dreams, visions, and smells stopped. <br>
When I was in 8th grade I dated this girl. I fell in love with her, and
trust me young love sucks so much. Because it turns out horrible, and
trust me, what happened to me, no one wants to go through. When she
broke up with me, I was devastated. I locked my self in my room all the
time, I wrote horrible stories about people that had been shunned away.
<br>
I can tell you right now, I lived in darkness for 3 months. I was not
myself, and my family noticed this as well. I would come home from
school, and go straight to my room. I hung a black curtain in my window
to keep out sunlight. I am telling you now, if you ever slip into
depression this deep seek help immediately. I would come home, go to my
room, do my homework in my room, come out and eat dinner, and go
straight back to my room. This went on for three months. I would only
come out to go the bath room and to take a shower. <br>
By the second month, I had started to hear voices. They weren't really
anything audible, but every once in a while I would hear someone say my
name. It was more or less gibberish that I couldn't understand. It got
so bad in that second month that I was walking to pick up my brother at
the bus stop, and I literally screamed out loud for them to stop. After
I did that, they stopped for about a week, and then picked up again ten
times stronger then before. I was really nasty, and mean to everyone. I
listened to nothing but sad music, and watched nothing but sad movies. <br>
Finally my mom and dad tricked me one night, they told me we were going
out to dinner. When we were in the car and driving, she turned around
and said that they were getting me help. I can tell you this right now,
that I knew I wasn't myself because of what I said to my mom and dad. I
love them very much and I would never say to them that I hated them. <br>
But when she told me that, my response was, "I hate you both!" I knew
it wasn't me talking, and that I had something terribly after me. <br>
After a month of help, I was back to myself. I removed the black curtain from my window, and everything changed. <br>
The next 3 years of high school, I had seen more paranormal things that
I had ever seen up to that point. One summer, my family from Florida
was up to visit us. We were all sitting in the down stairs family room
watching TV, and I swear to this day that a ghost of a women walked
right into the room, in front of the TV, and then down the hall only to
disappear. No one in the room saw it, I had been the only one. That
same night, I was taking my dog outside, and I saw an outline of an
angel in the sky. <br>
The next summer we were having a bon fire outside, and I came back into
the house to get something. No one was in the house, and everyone was
in the back yard where the fire was. All the windows were open in the
house, and I was standing in the kitchen, and I looked and saw someone
standing outside the window. Then I heard them say, "Hey, Josh, come
here I want to show you something!" It was such a creepy voice, and
plus I knew it wasn't anyone I knew because the person didn't look like
anyone and it sure as hell didn't sound like anyone I knew. <br>
My last and most frightening thing to happen to me when I was in high
school was on a night that I will never forget. It was the first, and
not the last time I saw this. It was my first encounter with a demon,
or elemental as a lot of my friends seem to think it was. <br>
I was laying in bed one night, and my room is with out a doubt the
hottest room in the house, it was in the winter time so I had the heat
on pretty high. I was laying in bed, just about to fall asleep when the
temperature in my room went from 70 degrees, to a dropping temp of 30
degrees. I could see my breath in the room, and I couldn't move. <br>
All of a sudden I heard something outside my room, so I closed my eyes. <br>
This was a bad idea because I couldn't open them after I had did this. <br>
I tried to scream for my parents but nothing was coming out of my mouth
but my breath. I tried so hard to open my eyes, and just when I finally
did, I heard something run through the kitchen, through my wall, and
into my room. It slid on my bed facing me, finally as it did this I was
able to open my eyes. What I saw was simply freakin terrifying. It was
a demon or elemental. It was only about 3 foot tall and it was all
gray, with red eyes, and glass shard teeth, with pointy ears. It looked
at me, smiled, and then said, "Hey Josh, what's going on?" I freaked
out and I started praying my hardest, and when I said, "The Lord Jesus
Christ..." it freaked out, screamed and then vanished. My room went
back to 70 degrees real fast, and I had been able to move again. That
was my tenth grade year in high school. <br>
That same year I had worked at a local restaurant. I hated the
basement, it always felt like something was down there watching me. We
had a big walk in freezer and every once and a while it would slam shut
on me. All you had to do was push it open, but it still scared the crap
out of me. <br>
One night I was working, just about to get off work and they sent me
down to the basement to do some things. This was the worst it had ever
been. I felt like I was being followed everywhere I was in the
basement. I finished what I had to do quick and then punched out and
got the hell out of there. By the time I got home I was telling my
parents about this, and I noticed that my back was burning real bad. It
started from the middle of my back to my left shoulder. I went to the
bathroom to take a shower, and I took off my shirt. I looked at my back
and I noticed that I had 4 big scratches from the middle of my back to
my shoulder. It looked like someone had dug their nails in my skin and
scraped my back. I ran to show my parents, they thought this was
weird.&nbsp; <br>
They asked me if I had bumped up against something at work, and I told them I didn't because I hadn't. <br>
Nothing after that happened to me... until now. In 2005 my grandfather
died of a blood disorder. I loved him very much, he was the rock of our
family. I took his death very hard. Three weeks before he died he gave
me one of his guitars, he loved to play guitar and seeing as how I was
the only grandchild out of many that showed interest in playing guitar,
he gave me the one he played all the time. Three weeks later he
died....I knew that very day that he was going to go sometime soon. <br>
The day he died, I had to work at crappy McDonalds... and I was in the
back room washing things in the dishwasher. I remember feeling his
presence next to me, but as quick as it came it left. <br>
A few months later I was downstairs on our family computer. Our
computer was up against the stairs so you could look up and see the
very top of the steps. One night I heard someone walking through the
house upstairs. I thought that it was someone just getting up to get
something to drink and then going back to bed. But I know my mom, dad,
and brothers footsteps... and trust me it wasn't either of them. As I
listened it sounded a lot like my grandfather, but I knew that he was
gone. Then I looked up at the top of the steps and saw him standing
there, just his feet and his pants. But I knew it was his because he
was the only person that wore leather penny loafers and dress pants. <br>
This went on for many weeks, it got so bad that it would last for 15
mins, and I got scared. So I would shut the door at night, well one
night I forgot to do this, and it happened again. I just told him to
rest, and that everyone was fine. I heard and saw him back away, and I
heard him walk through the kitchen, and then his footsteps lightly
vanished. <br>
In 2006, my friend and I wanted to start our own little paranormal
investigations, and so far they have proven to work. But I was doing
research on equipment one night, and I was the only one down stairs,
everyone was upstairs. I heard a voice say my name in my ear, and it
felt like someone was right beside me. I screamed and my mom thought
something happened, I told her what it was and she just let it go like
always. <br>
Now brings me to this year, I go to Youngstown State University. I go
home on the weekends cause I don't live that far from home. So far up
here I have had two experiences in the guys bath room up here. The
first one I had a cold chill, and I got the hell out of there quick. <br>
The second happened just the other day, I heard someone from the
cleaning staff walk into the bath room. I was in one of the stalls with
the door shut, and I knew it was one of them because I heard the keys,
and the boots. When I opened the stall door the footsteps stopped mid
step, and there was no one in the bath room. I freaked out and got the
hell out of there again. <br>
My dog just got put to sleep 2 weeks ago, and he was my pal. I miss him
so much, but I had not been there the week they did it. He had bone
cancer and he couldn't walk anymore, so they had to put him down on
such quick notice. I couldn't make it home in time, I was busy as hell
here at school. <br>
I went home last weekend, and the house is different. It is very quiet,
not that he made much noise but you can tell that he isn't there
anymore. I was doing my laundry real late, it was around 2:30 am and
everyone was sleeping. We have hard wood floors in our basement, it is
a finished basement. But when I would be home from school, late at
night my dog and I would chill downstairs and watch TV. He was also a
big part of all the paranormal things that went on in my life, cause
anytime something was about to happen, he would look at something that
I couldn't see, he would growl and bark at things that weren't there. <br>
His hair would stand on end... so anytime something was about to happen
I knew because of his reaction. Well I was doing my laundry, and I
heard his nails all of a sudden clicking on the floor. I just closed my
eyes and was like, "This is not happening." As soon as I said that, I
felt him walk up and rub himself against my leg. I started to cry and
told him that I was sorry that I couldn't see him one last time. I told
him that I loved him and I missed him so much. After that his feeling
went away. <br>
So now that leaves me to my future. What will continue to happen? I
know that the paranormal activities that happen to me will still
continue. Sometimes it goes, sometimes it's around for a while. For
some reason spirits feel drawn to me, good and bad ones. I help the
good ones as best I can and shun away the bad ones. Things will
continue to happen, I just have to be ready. <br>
I can tell you now, if you ever encounter anything, the first
experience will be terrifying. It will be something that you will
remember for the rest of your life. I don't wish this kind of "Curse" <br>
or what ever you wanna call it on anyone. It can be very, very frightening at times. <br>
I have gone through a lot of dark times in my life, and without the
help of family and friends I would be lost. What my family did for me
when I went through that whole depression state in my 8th grade year
was the best thing that could have ever done. At the time as I was
angry, and said things to them that I would never say because they
aren't true. But you have to remember something... I was not myself for
three months. <br>
If you ever come across a spirit, help it find its course. Tell it that
it isn't welcomed, even good or bad. If you ever shun away a spirit
good or bad, and you feel bad for doing so... never and I MEAN NEVER
EVER tell it to come back. Because it will come back and bring more
with it, and trust me it won't be nice even if it was before. <br>
With that said, I hope you enjoyed my stories. As you can tell I have a
lot, and I have been meaning to write these all down, so this gave me a
chance to do so. I still have stories that I would like to write, they
are more about what has happened to my family with paranormal activity.
<br>
But that is for another time. I hope you gain some knowledge from my
stories, and remember spirits are lost souls just looking for their
home. <br>

My Mothers Ghostly Room Mate<br>
<br>
By: kuramasfoxymiko@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
My name is SheVaun (or Joan, as my name is translated in
English).&nbsp; I'm 20 years old and I live in Central Texas.&nbsp;
I've never had much of an experience with the paranormal until I was
staying with my mother at one of her old apartments in North Austin one
school day (I was still in middle School or Junior High at the
time)&nbsp; after my morning Dentist appointment.&nbsp; It was in the
afternoon and I was watching my favorite Japanese Samurai cartoon (Or
was is the ThunderCats?) on Cartoon Network, in my mother's
bedroom.&nbsp; I was just enjoying my show when I saw the glimpse of a
Shadow in the hall from my mother's vanity mirror (it was placed at the
opposite wall of the door).&nbsp; <br>
I froze for a moment until I thought it was my mother, but when I asked
her in the living room she said that she hadn't got up from her seat
for anything.&nbsp; Next I had thought it was my uncle (by marriage)
but I remembered that he hadn't returned from one of his many
outings.&nbsp; It was then that my mother told me that the small
apartment building had ghosts.&nbsp; <br>
After that, she told me of her experiences at her old apartment, which
was diagonal from the one I saw the shadow.&nbsp; They started
happening sometime after she went through a bad breakup with boyfriend
of 4 years.&nbsp; At times, the lace curtain she used for her bedroon
door would sway ever so slightly, like someone had walked past her
door.&nbsp; But she was alone, the windows weren't open, and the AC
hadn't turned on.&nbsp; Another night, she was laying on her bed after
a long day at the office (my mother was a Dental Assistant) and just as
she was about to fall asleep, she felt someone massaging her
scalp.&nbsp; When she woke up no one was there.&nbsp; At other times,
the kitchen light would turn on by it self.&nbsp; <br>
One time, when she lit my 2-3 month pregnant sister stay with her, my
mother saw the shadow of someone walking by her bathroom from under the
crack of the door.&nbsp; After doing her business, she called my
sister, who was in the kitchen at the time, to come into the bathroom
with her.&nbsp; My sister did so, and a little while after my mother
shut the door, the both saw the same shadowed feet walk by the
bathroom.&nbsp; <br>
In that one apartment, the hauntings were quite frequent to my mother
when alone but after moving into the apartment I saw the shadow, the
hauntings had leveled down trememdously.&nbsp; She understood that they
were not malicious spirits and never felt threatened by them but they
did bother her at times.&nbsp; At first she thought that it was the
spirit of her Deceased brother who had died in his teens but she
started to think otherwise when she saw the shadows of a broad
shouldered man.&nbsp; <br>
Some years had passed since then and My mother had planned to look into
the apartment building's history or the history of the property but
never had the chance.&nbsp; But when she does, I plan to help her in
looking into this.&nbsp; <br>
Thank you for hearing this story, even though the majority was my mother's.&nbsp; <br>

My Personal Experience at Listed Haunted Place<br>
<br>
By: mhansen@lhup.edu<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I am a student at Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania. I went on your
website to look to see what your website had to say about my school. I
would like to update you on a couple personal experiences my friends
and I have had in one of the most infamous buildings on campus.<br>
Last year I was a resident of Russell Hall and I lived in room 307, the
room Mary (the girl who hung herself in the bell tower) supposively
lived in.<br>
The first experience I had in Russell Hall was during the day time
while I was taking a shower in the bathroom. I remember the day was in
late October when the weather was very cold outside. I would also like
to remind you that there is only one way to walk in and out of the
room.&nbsp; While I was taking my shower I had an urge to look out of
the curtain. As I looked out of the curtain I saw the the back of a
girl walking towards the other side of the room. I thought nothing of
it and continued taking my shower. It was only later that I realized
that the girls clothing was not the type of clothing girls would wear
in this day and age, nor was the weather appropriate for what the girl
was wearing. The girl that I saw was wearing a tied-dyed sphegetti
strapped shirt and corduroy green shorts. I also realizes that she was
walking straight towards the wall which lead to a dead end, and I never
saw her walk back to leave the room. That whole day, and throughout the
semester, I never saw any girls on my floor ever wearing that outfit.<br>
My guess would be that the outfit the girl was wearing came from the
1970's era, around the same time Mary was found dead in the buildings
bell tower.<br>
Girls on my floor would also talk about seeing foot prints from the
water in the shower room appearing on the floor in front of their eyes,<br>
In our room my roommate and I had bunk beds. I slept on the top bunk
and she slept on the bottom bunk. One night I woke up and saw, who I
thought was, my roommate sitting at her desk. I noticed that there was
nothing on at her desk and she was only sitting there looking straight
ahead at the wall. I thought it was a little weird but I just shrugged
and went back to sleep. The next morning the first thing my roommate
said to me was "Were you sitting at my desk last night?" All I could
think to say was "I thought that was you sitting at your desk!!" We
both found it very creepy and odd that we both saw someone sitting at
her desk at the same time.<br>
Other occurrences that happened in Russell Hall was that we would both
hear whispering in our ears to wake up if we were about to over sleep
before a class. Objects would move across our room. <br>
Other students would complain of being scratched while they were
sleeping. At one point in the year the Resident Assistant of our floor
had to have a meeting with the residence to tell us to stop quigi
boarding because they were starting to hear strange screaming noises
coming from both sides of the hallways when nobody was awake late at
night.<br>
Other students, and professors who have offices in the basement, have
told me about hearing the pianos in the basement being played, and then
once somebody goes to investigate the music stops and nobody is in
sight, nor could run out of the basement that fast.<br>
Russell Hall is now closed and is only open during the daytime because the offices on the ground floor still operate. <br>
I still talk to the resident director of Russell Hall who stills lives
in the building. She told me that she hears running and boxes falling
over on the locked up hallways above her room but it does not bother
her. <br>
I would also like to let you know that there is a rumor that, Mary, the
girl who hung herself in the bell tower, was actually murdered by her
boyfriend and was hung in the bell tower. There apparently was a court
case that proved this last year, but I am not 100% sure on this, so
that could be something you might want to look into.<br>
I just wanted to let you know this so you could add more information on website.<br>

Cass River Yacht Club<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp; thieme55@charter.net<br>
<br>
A male ghost haunts Cass River Yacht Club, a neighborhood bar in
downtown Bridgeport.&nbsp; The owner, Jill tells this chilling story:<br>
I purchased the bar in 1989 and immediately night employees would tell
me about an eerie feeling that someone was in the building late at
night.&nbsp; One employee in particular, Cheryl who was a night closer
stated that she saw images of the ghost several times as he moved from
the kitchen to the back storage room.&nbsp; This always happened very
late at night after all the customers had left and the doors were
locked as she was finishing the night closing chores. <br>
When I asked if she could describe what he looked like, she said he was
wearing blue clothes and had some sort of uniform on like a mailman or
a security guard.&nbsp; Other bartenders who were working alone late at
night also claimed to hear strange noises, look in that direction and
see a blue shadow. <br>
I didn&#8217;t think much about it and simply wrote it off as an over active
imagination . . . . . . until 10 years later.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
It just so happened that one day I was visiting with Larry, an elderly
gentleman who had just recently started frequenting the bar.&nbsp; He
was sharing the history of the bar, which had many previous
owners.&nbsp; Almost 30 years ago, he told me that he was a regular
customer at this location.&nbsp; Then he shared a story with me about
one unfortunate night he will never forget.&nbsp; <br>
He was in the bathroom, using the stall behind a closed door when 3 men
rushed into the bathroom to use the sink.&nbsp; They did not know he
was there.&nbsp; The 3 men were shouting obscenities at each other and
saying, &#8220;I think you killed him!&#8221;&nbsp; It was soon obvious by the
splashes of blood on the wall, floor and paper towels that they were
cleaning blood off of themselves. <br>
Later that night a body was discovered under a car in the parking
lot.&nbsp; The victim had been brutally beaten and kicked to
death.&nbsp; The young man who died that night was on leave from the
army.&nbsp; He was wearing his uniform.&nbsp; <br>
Months later the 3 men in the bathroom were in court, accused of
homicide.&nbsp; Larry, having been in the bathroom was called as a
witness.&nbsp; He never did see their faces and there wasn&#8217;t sufficient
evidence to convict anyone of the killing.&nbsp; The murderers went
free.&nbsp; <br>

Skeleton Riding the Bicycle<br>
<br>
By: tzsunny@hotmail.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This falls into the category of creepy stories, and it did in fact happen to me.<br>
When I was in high school, junior or senior year, I had an evil and traumatizing dream.<br>
I dreamt a lot growing up, but never had one as horrifying as this one.<br>
As some background info, I grew up in a small American town, population 2,000.<br>
The dream begins immediately on some random tiny street near downtown.&nbsp; It was a street I hadn't been on <br>
in years because it was off the beaten path, and only had 3-4 houses on it.&nbsp; In my dream it is night, and <br>
competely dark out, save for the street lights that dot each little intersection.<br>
The terror in my dream started immediately, because the first thing I remember was I had hit the ground running <br>
from the skeleton on the bicycle directly in front of one of the houses on that tiny street.&nbsp; The skeleton<br>
was wearing a black top hat and a black tuxedo jacket.&nbsp; He was not large in stature, but as big as I was, which<br>
was big enough to make a presence, it struck me as an evil male
presence.&nbsp; I ran in the darkness to the end of the street, took a
right turn and another right turn<br>
onto a very long straight road that was going uphill and headed
south.&nbsp; In my dream, I never stopped running, but would constantly
look over my shoulder to see the skeleton pedaling (as fast as any
adult would be able to pedal uphill)... it continued to chase me
and&nbsp; remained within 50 feet of me.&nbsp; Near the top of the
hill, I went down a street to the right and immediately into the house
that belonged to a friend in school.&nbsp; Of course, as luck would
have it, no one was there.... no one seemed to <br>
be anywhere in town that night, I never saw another living soul, and
all the house lights were off... only dim street lights at the blocks'
intersections were illuminated.<br>
After entering my friend's dark house and realizing there was no one
there to protect me, I decided to run out to the backyard and around
the house to the street again, and hoped that the skeleton on the bike
did not know where I was.&nbsp; As I ran out the back door, he was
rounding the corner and continued chasing me to the street.<br>
I ran and ran down the street now heading west and onto a main street
heading to the west end of one of the main drags.&nbsp; I eventually
turned left heading south again and was about a block from my high
school in the dream when I woke up.&nbsp; <br>
I have to say I thought about the fact that in my dream, I was aware of
the fact that I was headed someplace besides my high school, even
though it was the most well known landmark near the location of where I
ended up running.<br>
&nbsp;Upon waking the next morning.&nbsp; None of it made any sense to
me, it was creepy, and disturbing, realistic and hard to shake for
weeks after..... but it never really had much significance at the time.<br>
&nbsp;That is... until about 3 months later.<br>
&nbsp;Horror struck our quiet little town one night about three months
after my awful dream.&nbsp; A woman, single mother of 3, was murdered
in her home one night while the town slept.&nbsp; The murder took place
at the EXACT house from which my dream began.&nbsp; The killer, her
ex-husband, then proceeded to go on a rampage, second victim that night
was the murdered woman's best friend...my friend's mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yes, you guessed it....&nbsp;&nbsp; She lived at the second house that
the skeleton in my dream chased me to.&nbsp; The third house this
killer ended up going to <br>
that night after the first two, was the residence of one of our
prominent townsmen.&nbsp; And yes, his house just happens to sit
directly behind the high school on a beautiful quiet loop drive.<br>
It sickens me that I had this dream.&nbsp; I don't understand why it happened to me.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;*Both the second and third victims did survive, thank goodness.<br>

My Sister-In-Law<br>
<br>
By: rkvermette@yahoo.ca<br>
<br>
I have a few ghost stories. A couple of stories I got from my mother
and a few I can tell you first hand. The first one I grew up hearing
about was&nbsp; my grandparents on my father's side&nbsp; who lived in
a haunted house that was across the street from a graveyard.
Apparently, there used to be footsteps heard in the rooms upstairs.
There was one little problen with that, the house at that time had no
upstairs.&nbsp; But footsteps would also be heard going up and down the
non-existant stair case as well. The house was vacate for many years
when it mysteriously burned down its self. My grandmother who was
sensitive would have the most unusal way of knowing a death in the
family was going to happen; when she looked out the window at the
graveyard and see a black figure over her father's grave she knew&nbsp;
there was doing to be a death.<br>
In the year 2001, my cousin took his own life and since then I feel
that he visits me. He was a joker in life and now I believe that he is
still joking with me. If some thing like my keys or other items all I
have to do is say his name and ask them to be returned and they are
very shortly found. Over the years I have been in a few houses where I
have stayed overnight and have had spirits talk to me untill all hours
of the night!! That is loads of fun. For as long as I remember I have
felt a ghost following me around.<br>
My in-laws have had family members&nbsp; appear after death. We have
had a recent lost of my sister-inlaw and she was also a good freind of
mine as well. She died of liver cancer in Nov. of 2007. But before she
was really sick I told her to come to see our recently moved into
house. I believe that she did com to visit us for a couple of days
after she died. We have a rocking chair with a squeaky rocker and for a
couple of days that rocking chair rocked at night on its own. So my
sister-inlaw did make a visit after all.<br>
