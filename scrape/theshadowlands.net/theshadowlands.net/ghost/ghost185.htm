<b>The Office</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kym36@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello, I love your site!&nbsp; I have always been very interested
in the</b>
<br><b>paranormal and have become somewhat of a walking encyclopedia of
ghost</b>
<br><b>stories.&nbsp; I have only a few stories that I know are true beyond
a shadow of</b>
<br><b>a doubt because they happened to me.&nbsp; This is just one of them,
but it is by</b>
<br><b>far the creepiest to me simply because of the circumstances.&nbsp;
I work for the</b>
<br><b>state in Children's Services and sometimes my job requires me to
work late</b>
<br><b>into the night, sometimes just to wait for a fax or a phone call,
but I have</b>
<br><b>to be here.&nbsp; Anyway, when I first started working here, I was
told that this</b>
<br><b>building is haunted and not to be surprised to hear things at night.&nbsp;
Of</b>
<br><b>course, me being the way I am, I thought this was pretty cool.&nbsp;
Until I</b>
<br><b>experienced something first hand.&nbsp; One night, I was working
pretty late but</b>
<br><b>I wasn't nervous because two other people were in the building with
me.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>heard the first leave around 6:30 but the other was still here.&nbsp;
I kept</b>
<br><b>hearing her walk up and down the hall and going into the copy room.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>called out to her a few times but she didn't answer so I figured
she was in</b>
<br><b>the bathroom.&nbsp; I finally left work at 10:30 that night after
listening to my</b>
<br><b>co-worker pace the halls for hours.&nbsp; I was kind of surprised
not to see her</b>
<br><b>anywhere when I came out of my office, but again, I figured she
had gone to</b>
<br><b>the bathroom.&nbsp; Now, the reason I knew who it was, is because
I had taken a</b>
<br><b>break and gone outside for a cigarette and saw her car out back
of the</b>
<br><b>building where she always parks.&nbsp; The next day, I had to work
late again.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>kept hearing someone pace the halls and this time I stepped out
of the</b>
<br><b>office to see another co-worker.&nbsp; He was surprised and said
he had kept</b>
<br><b>hearing things so he just had to figure out if anyone else was there.&nbsp;
He</b>
<br><b>asked why I kept using the bathroom on the other side of the hall
when I had</b>
<br><b>my own.&nbsp; I hadn't used that bathroom!!&nbsp; No one else was
in the building.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, the next day, we were up front laughing about scaring each
other the</b>
<br><b>night before and I started telling everyone about how my other co-worker
had</b>
<br><b>paced the halls so long two nights earlier.&nbsp; She got this strange
look on</b>
<br><b>her face and said she hadn't been there.&nbsp; I told her I knew
she was because</b>
<br><b>her car was out back.&nbsp; She said that she had left her car at
work and gone</b>
<br><b>home with her sister.&nbsp; She didn't pick her car up until midnight
that night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; NO ONE ELSE WAS THERE!!!&nbsp; So what did I hear and what
did my other</b>
<br><b>co-worker hear the night before?&nbsp; I have had to work several
nights since</b>
<br><b>then and I always hear someone walking the halls...even when I know
I am the</b>
<br><b>only one in the building.&nbsp; I recently found out that this office
used to be</b>
<br><b>a doctor's office and I can't help but wonder if something unfortunate</b>
<br><b>happened here or if someone is just working late right along with
me.</b>

<p><b>Zol or Sol and other silly stuff</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tango@tango93.freeserve.co.uk</b><b></b>
<p><b>my experiences seem slightly silly but never the less strange. A
few years ago after finishing dinner and&nbsp; cleaning away the dishes
I noticed on the dining table a gravy spill in the image of Queen Nefertiti
of Egypt.</b>
<br><b>I did take a photograph just for curiosity value and then thought
no more of it,except to show it around now and again.</b>
<br><b>Last year after finishing a meal I noticed&nbsp; on the edge of
my plate the drawing of a young child who appeared to be walking.</b>
<br><b>I pointed this out to my family but they just sort of dismissed
it has dad being dad so the dishes were washed and the image lost, not
thinking to take a photo of it.</b>
<br><b>A few months ago yet again whilst preparing dinner I was using a
cutting board to prepare some rather dusty potatoes. I turned my back to
go to the sink and when I came to clean the cutting board another image
had appeared.</b>
<br><b>I was amazed by this as it was a drawing of the same child who had
first appeared on the dinner plate I mentioned earlier, only this time
he or she was being held in the arms of an elderly man. I said it was silly&nbsp;
has I have no explanation for it.</b>
<br><b>I did this time take a photograph and also kept the board with its
original&nbsp; drawing</b>
<br><b>My neighbour recently asked if we have had a young child staying
with us at home because she told me that she has seen a young child skipping
around our garden in the early hours of the morning.</b>
<br><b>Also I was reading a book in my bedroom when a young child sort
of danced in I asked him who he was,he said his name was little Sol or
Z0l I'm not quite sure. I asked him what he was doing here and he seem
to skip out of sight behind me I then became rather agitated because I
couldn't see what he was up too.</b>

<br><b>The Ghandi Monster</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Jennifer Richard</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is a true story.&nbsp; This happened to me when I was 8 years
old.&nbsp; I'm now</b>
<br><b>28 with 3 kids of my own.</b>
<br><b>It happened in my home town of Sauk Village, IL.&nbsp; Which is
known to be a</b>
<br><b>place that Indians passed through using Sauk Trail to get to other</b>
<br><b>destinations.&nbsp; At least that's what the *offical* story is.&nbsp;
There are</b>
<br><b>others, like myself, who believe more.&nbsp; We believe that Indians
actually</b>
<br><b>settled there ..if only for brief periods of time.&nbsp; There's
always been talk</b>
<br><b>of bones being found when a pool was dug up or a garden was put
it in.&nbsp; But</b>
<br><b>most say it's just that ...talk.&nbsp; Not me.&nbsp; I believe it.&nbsp;
I also, not only</b>
<br><b>believe, but KNOW, that the ground that Sauk Village is residing
on is....</b>
<br><b>SOUR.&nbsp; Cursed.&nbsp; Beyond anybody's wildest dreams.&nbsp;
And I have many stories to</b>
<br><b>support that belief.&nbsp; But, for now, I will start with my first
story of</b>
<br><b>*proof*.</b>
<br><b>It was a cold *normal* night in the season of autumn.&nbsp; Cold
enough to keep</b>
<br><b>you inside your house and snuggled under a blanket.&nbsp; I was
doing exactly</b>
<br><b>that.&nbsp; An eight year old can only do so much during these times
and I chose</b>
<br><b>to do my homework so I could read later.&nbsp; I had been listening
to a Rick</b>
<br><b>Springfield album on 8 track.&nbsp; I was playing it on my 2XL robot
toy.&nbsp; This</b>
<br><b>was a toy that you could put 8 track cartridges in that was made
by the</b>
<br><b>company to be a sort of trivia game.&nbsp; You'd play the cartridge
and it would</b>
<br><b>ask you questions and tell you jokes.&nbsp; It had two big red robot
eyes that</b>
<br><b>flashed red when you were correct.&nbsp; It had 3 buttons you could
push to answer</b>
<br><b>your questions.&nbsp;&nbsp; 2XL could also play normal 8 track music.&nbsp;
And of course</b>
<br><b>it's red robot eyes flashed in time with the music.&nbsp;&nbsp;
So it was doing exactly</b>
<br><b>just that, on that cold autumn night, flashing it's eyes to Rick</b>
<br><b>Springfield.&nbsp; And I was quite contented.</b>
<br><b>My bedroom was on the second floor of my house and faced north.&nbsp;
Along with</b>
<br><b>my bed.&nbsp; I had a window north of me and east of me.&nbsp; Of
course it was dark</b>
<br><b>outside but it was so warm inside and so very comforting.&nbsp;
Every now and</b>
<br><b>again I'd look up from my homework and just look out into the darkness.&nbsp;
No</b>
<br><b>reason.&nbsp; It was just something I did.&nbsp; Well, this was
the last time I ever</b>
<br><b>did that again in that house.</b>
<br><b>As I was sitting there ...all of a sudden ...I felt instantly cold.&nbsp;
And</b>
<br><b>every single hair on my body was raised.&nbsp; My blood felt like
it had ran cold</b>
<br><b>and decided to just stop pumping through my body.&nbsp; My heart
was racing.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>was perfectly terrified.&nbsp; And I didn't even know why.....yet.&nbsp;
My 2XL was</b>
<br><b>suddenly stuck and it kept playing the same verse from Rick over
and over :</b>
<br><b>"Hole in my heart...hole in my heart ..hole in my heart.." and it's
eyes</b>
<br><b>weren't flashing anymore.&nbsp; No, they were just burning bright
red.&nbsp; Blood</b>
<br><b>red.&nbsp; Then I felt this magnetic pull.&nbsp; Like something
was pulling me to my</b>
<br><b>right.&nbsp; I turned my head right and looked out the East window
and saw</b>
<br><b>*something* that has haunted me for the rest of my life.</b>
<br><b>Sitting just barely outside my window, levitating, was the most
horrifying</b>
<br><b>image I will ever see in my life.&nbsp; A creature.&nbsp; About
2 feet tall ..but</b>
<br><b>sitting Indian style.&nbsp; His skin was snowy white and you could
see the</b>
<br><b>outlines of his bones because he was THAT skinny.&nbsp; He wore
some sort of white</b>
<br><b>cloth draped sideways on his body.&nbsp; (This is why I later named
him the Ghandi</b>
<br><b>Monster.&nbsp; My young mind thought his skinny body and his white
cloth looked</b>
<br><b>like the real Ghandi's did.) This *creature's* head was too big
for his</b>
<br><b>body.&nbsp; But he was completely bald.&nbsp; His two horrible,
big, dark eyes were</b>
<br><b>piercing my soul as he stared at me.&nbsp; He opened his mouth and
grinned a grin</b>
<br><b>at me that haunted my dreams for years.&nbsp; His mouth was full
of long, snarly,</b>
<br><b>razor sharp looking teeth.&nbsp; Dripping with blood.&nbsp; I don't
know how a mouth</b>
<br><b>could fit so many nasty teeth into it.&nbsp; But it did.&nbsp; I
watched as the blood</b>
<br><b>dripped from his teeth and slid down his chin and onto his white
cloth</b>
<br><b>"diaper" shorts.&nbsp; He raised his hands and reached for me.&nbsp;
The fingernails</b>
<br><b>were at least 4 inches long, gnarled looking&nbsp; and sharpened
to points.&nbsp; Also</b>
<br><b>dripping with blood.</b>
<br><b>I wanted to scream.&nbsp; I wanted to run.&nbsp; But I was locked
into place by his</b>
<br><b>piercing eyes.&nbsp; I couldn't breathe. I felt as if my brain was
being scrambled</b>
<br><b>and my soul was being raped.&nbsp; His grin became larger and he
opened his mouth</b>
<br><b>wider.&nbsp; He kept looking at me.&nbsp; As if he knew me.&nbsp;
As if he had been waiting</b>
<br><b>for me.&nbsp; He started to lift his arms more and it looked as
if in seconds he</b>
<br><b>would actually be INSIDE my room and not just outside my window.</b>
<br><b>All traces of reason disappeared and my mind snapped.&nbsp; I still
don't know how</b>
<br><b>I did it but I managed to tear my gaze away and leap off the bed
and out my</b>
<br><b>bedroom door. Screaming with every inch of my soul!&nbsp; All in
like 2 seconds.</b>
<br><b>I could feel him pulling me.&nbsp; I could feel that horrible stare
penetrating my</b>
<br><b>back as I screamed down the hallway to my mother.</b>
<br><b>Of course when her and my father and younger brother came back ..IT
was</b>
<br><b>gone.&nbsp; But they knew I saw something and they did not try to
tell me it was</b>
<br><b>my imagination.&nbsp; They comforted me and taped up all the windows
in my room.</b>
<br><b>They actually had to pull down all the shades and seal all sides
with duct</b>
<br><b>tape.&nbsp; I couldn't sleep in that room for almost a year.&nbsp;
The whole family,</b>
<br><b>Mom, dad, and my brother and sister know about this experience.&nbsp;
My brother</b>
<br><b>even remembers coming into the room with my parents afterwards.&nbsp;
The Ghandi</b>
<br><b>monster was a story we didn't tell often.&nbsp; But it always brought
fear to</b>
<br><b>speak of it.&nbsp; To us and to others.&nbsp; My parents never spoke
of it again</b>
<br><b>either.&nbsp; As I grew up I tried to face my fear and sleep in
that room.&nbsp; But</b>
<br><b>never did I sleep with my back to a window.&nbsp; Never.</b>
<br><b>18 years later I moved to Florida with my own little family and
have found</b>
<br><b>peace within myself.&nbsp; But I will never forget that creature.&nbsp;
And I will</b>
<br><b>never sleep or sit with my back to a window.&nbsp; And I will never
forget the one</b>
<br><b>thing I "heard" it say to me in my mind as I was running out of
my bedroom</b>
<br><b>door.</b>
<br><b>"Someday, I'm coming back...."</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Footsteps: My mother's true story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Geninarose@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My mother was 22 at the time of this experience. She lived with my
dad, aunt,</b>
<br><b>grandma, and uncles in a house in Mineola, New York. While living
there, she</b>
<br><b>and my father lived in the basement. My sisters were just babies
( I wasn't</b>
<br><b>even thought of yet). It all started one day when everyone left
for work. She</b>
<br><b>was going about her daily chores when out of nowhere, she heard
a knock on</b>
<br><b>the upstairs front door. She ran up the stairs to see who was there
but</b>
<br><b>nobody was there. This happened three times. When my grandma came
home from</b>
<br><b>work, she asked her if she was expecting anyone and that she had
heard knocks</b>
<br><b>on the door. My grandma told her she hadn't expected anybody to
come over.</b>
<br><b>The next day, she was again doing her chores when, this time, she
heard the</b>
<br><b>knock and someone step inside the foyer. This kept on happening
but the steps</b>
<br><b>went, eachday, from the foyer, through the living room, then into
the</b>
<br><b>kitchen, to the door that leads to the basement apartment. During
these</b>
<br><b>events she was scared to death because she all alone with my twin
sisters.</b>
<br><b>Finally, she told her friend about what had happened. Her friend
agreed to go</b>
<br><b>to her house and have dinner. During dinner nothing happened, but,
while they</b>
<br><b>were doing the dishes, my mom heard footsteps coming down the stairs
leading</b>
<br><b>to the upstairs bedrooms. She turned to her friend and said, "Gloria,
do you</b>
<br><b>hear that"? Her friend replied, "Yeah, I hear it". My mom called
out to my</b>
<br><b>dad and said, "Ron, is someone walking down the stairs"? He replied,
"No".</b>
<br><b>After that the footsteps minimized and finally disappeared. She
still wonders</b>
<br><b>about what really went on at the house. And is still scared.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Fishy Vicar</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:sedge@btinternet.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hey, I'm in my mid teens and I've experienced ghostly encounters.&nbsp;
The one that really freaked me out was when me and my family&nbsp; moved
to Scotland, for a few months we lived in chalets, me and my older sister
shared one on our own. A few weeks after we moved in we began to feel uncomfortable
and felt as if we were being watched there was also a threatening atmosphere,
we told our parents and they said it's just because we were next to the
graveyard.&nbsp; A few weeks later I was lying in my bed with the door
open when a tall dark figure stood leaning over me, I didn't think at that
particular moment but it wasn't until my sister asked me if I felt somebody
was in my room the previous night.&nbsp; We started to talk and she too
felt as if someone tall was leaning over her.&nbsp; I then started to sleep
in my sisters room and the figure didn't return so I moved back into my
own room, but then again the figure retuned this time it was kneeling beside
me.&nbsp; The next morning I told my sister and again she felt the presence
of a tall man, our dad told us that the large house next to us was where
the vicars used to stay until the house was sold. One night my mum came
in and she was holding two necklaces with crosses on, me and my sister
aren't religious so our mum thought it had something to do with that.</b>
<br><b>So we went to bed holding the crosses, that night it was very uncomfortable
in both rooms, after that we haven't felt the presence of the tall man.</b>
<br><b>The figure that visited did so on a few occasions, each time it
felt as though it was getting closer and more angry.&nbsp; When the crosses
were given to us that night the figure seemed very angry it's face was
literally pressed into mine, and it felt as if he was gritting his teeth
at me.&nbsp; My sis also had this very uncomfortable, menacing figure,
who was pressed into her face.&nbsp; All you could do was hide under the
quilt, closing your eyes really tight and hope you'd fall to sleep quick.&nbsp;
Since that last visit nothing has returned, and we've moved since then,
and nothing, we don't use the crosses either anymore.</b>
<br><b>Other things that we didn't think of as being connected at the time
now do seem connected.&nbsp; Such as, the chalet that mum and dad were
in, although the same was different in feeling.&nbsp; Because Mums and
dads chalet always had a comfy feeling, yet ours didn't, whether it was
because there was just me and my sis alone in there, and it was our imaginations
or not, we don't know! (Although in mums and dads chalet there was only
one more person over there)</b>
<br><b>From the moment we stepped into the chalet it was always cold, even
with the heaters on.</b>
<br><b>Plus there was often a bad smell wafting around, alot like fish,
rotten.&nbsp; This was only in my bedroom, (possibly me!, my sis says)</b>
<br><b>Also in my room, there was a strange noise of scratching, as if
some one was sketching or writing.&nbsp; This noise accompanied the presence
of another figure, smaller in stature, and of the female sex. My sis also
felt the smaller presence, but not the noise.?&nbsp; She only came once,
very different, not menacing, quiet in nature and much older, she was almost
a comfort.&nbsp; But it's still not nice to be watched over at night by
ghostly figures.</b>
<br><b>It's strange because we didn't actually see anything, yet you get
so much from these feelings, the sex, age, angry, happy etc.&nbsp; Plus
we get almost exactly the same feelings.</b>
<br><b>But is it just our imagination?</b>
<br><b>Are we certifiably insane?</b>
<br><b>Are we demented?</b>
<br><b>NO!</b>
<br><b>We definitely feel we had a visitor?</b>
<br><b>Previous to this experience, my sister had not really believed in
it, ghostly visits and such, but know I think she has had a change of mind.&nbsp;
Me myself I had always believed, my mums granddad often visits, a kind
presence, bringing good luck.&nbsp; Such as when having problems he visits
to let us know everything will be ok!&nbsp; He often visited when we were
babies watching over our cots. Our dad also saw what appeared to be him,&nbsp;
when ever he visits we know him by the distinct smell of putty? He used
to repair windows.</b>
<br><b>So really we are used to visits, although my sister had never experienced
any, until now.&nbsp; Unfortunately it wasn't a happy experience, one not
to forget.</b>

<p><b>Testimonial to "Resurrection Mary"</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: jmckirah@ivy.tec.in.us</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Happened to surf onto your website and I just wanted to let you know
that I</b>
<br><b>saw "Resurrection Mary" in Justice, IL back in October of '92.&nbsp;
After</b>
<br><b>getting off of work at 3:00AM from a chemical plant (Witco Corporation)
near</b>
<br><b>51st and Central in Chicago, I was driving by that particular cemetery
at</b>
<br><b>about 3:30 AM on my way home from work. Driving by but initially
not</b>
<br><b>thinking much of this site as there was a night club with "women
of</b>
<br><b>ill-repute" nearby, I saw a woman in a light blue or white prom
dress</b>
<br><b>standing by the trunk of what looked like a black parked limosine
at the</b>
<br><b>front SW cemetery driveway off Archer Ave. to the cemetery.&nbsp;
I slowed down</b>
<br><b>quite a bit to get a better look at the odd sight but then drove
off. I</b>
<br><b>thought it was probably a prostitute with her john. However, looking
back in</b>
<br><b>my mirror maybe a second later, the woman and the limo were gone.&nbsp;
Let me</b>
<br><b>assure you that there was no way that I would have missed the limo
driving</b>
<br><b>off in that second that it took me to look back in the mirror.&nbsp;
They weren't</b>
<br><b>on the road or in the cemetery because I looked for taillights.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>cemetery gates are pretty large and it would have taken great effort
and</b>
<br><b>time to open both of the cemetery gates for the car to get through.</b>
<br><b>I did not think much of the incident until a few days later talking
with</b>
<br><b>some of my employees that lived in the area near the cemetery that
two of my</b>
<br><b>employees mentioned that I had probably seen the ghost called "Resurrection</b>
<br><b>Mary."&nbsp; I did not much believe in ghosts until that incident
and I am still</b>
<br><b>somewhat skeptical, but I cannot fully explain what I saw that night.&nbsp;
That</b>
<br><b>incident is still vivid in my memory and kind of creepy to think
about it to</b>
<br><b>this day.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Strange and usual story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp;&nbsp; Alana80@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever since I could remember I have always had
an interest in ghost stories.That is why I am writing you this letter.No</b>
<br><b>I don't have a ghost in my house.A friend of mine told me about
this place at least 10 months ago.I was so amazed at this story I asked
if he would take me to this place.No one really ever goes there.</b>
<br><b>I guess cause it is so dark and creepy looking at night but during
the day it is ok nothing strange</b>
<br><b>happens.Well first before I tell you more about this place let me
tell you the story of why it is</b>
<br><b>so usual.The city is called Lake Forest ,California.They call it&nbsp;
Canyon Creek, I guess because it is nothing but Canyon and wide open spaces
of&nbsp; nothing but rocks and wildlife.The story goes back</b>
<br><b>30 years ago that a&nbsp; lady who was in here 40's know one new
what her name was.She lived alone with her two great dane dogs. She was
very rich and owned all of the Canyon.Which is like miles and miles of&nbsp;
land.This lady never married and had no children.It was just her dogs and
herself.She lived in like this trailer park home it was not a pretty house
you could say.Well about 6 years later the story goes that someone it was
said that a Police officer got a call about the lady and her dogs . The
officer went to the lady's home and knock at the door and no one answered
will he broke down the down and it is said that the police officer found
the lady dead nothing was left but bones and laying next to her where her
to dogs both dead as well.That is where the usual and strange things start
to happen . People who have never been to this place don't know what to
expect if they come to this place.Sometimes nothing happens if you are
there other times strange things happen.Like here is one thing that has
happen to someone who was driving down the canyon man one night was driving
by himself and the story goes he saw the lady standing at the side of the
rode with her two dogs with her tumb out trying to get a ride to her house.The
man did not stop at all to give the lady a ride he just keep going.This
other story was told by my friend.My friend told me that His Ex Girlfriend
and her boyfriend went up there one night to check it out.They stop from
what I was told where the lady 's house was.They were only there about
15 minutes they were just taking and listing to music.Then all of the sudden
they heard a knock on the side door of the driver's seat.They both turned
to look and they saw the lady standing there knocking on the window She
was in the white and covered in blood&nbsp; .They saw the dogs near by
as well on the hood of the car they saw out lines of little children.They
sat there in shock for 45 minutes just looking at the lady.For some reason
the</b>
<br><b>lady was still knocking at the driver's side of the window.They
both said she must have been there about 45 minutes.After that my friend
said they never returned back there.That is not the only story&nbsp; like
that to happen to anyone.There are far more.What I would like know is who
is this lady and why is she doing this.There is something more to why she
has to hunt people who have done nothing to her.Maybe it is because she
does not want anyone on her land that she loved so much? what could it
be.Here is my E Mail address if you have any questions please feel free
to get a hold of me.Alana80@hotmail.com. I would at least like somekind
of feed back on this story.</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;Wondered About</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: JonesBlueeyes@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have a story that I have often wondered about.&nbsp; Back in 1990
my mother had</b>
<br><b>taken a cruise on a luxury liner and met a man who lived in Oregon.&nbsp;
He had</b>
<br><b>invited her to his place, and naturally I had been skeptical because
of the</b>
<br><b>fact they had only known each other for 7 days.&nbsp; I myself and
my husband at</b>
<br><b>that time felt that we should go with her just incase this man was
a maniac</b>
<br><b>or something.&nbsp; I had just had a baby a couple of months prior
so all of us</b>
<br><b>went.&nbsp; Anyways, this man had a house on top of a mountain and
naturally in</b>
<br><b>the winter months it gets snowy, &amp; icy.&nbsp; His wife at the
time had driven down</b>
<br><b>the mountain her car went off the road into a tree and killed her.&nbsp;
That</b>
<br><b>gives you some background.&nbsp; The first day upon arriving I went
downstairs to</b>
<br><b>take a shower my husband and moms boyfriend had left to go to the
grocery</b>
<br><b>store.&nbsp; This left mom, myself and my 2 month old baby.&nbsp;
Anyway, not knowing</b>
<br><b>this was the shower his deceased wife used, I went and started taking
my</b>
<br><b>shower, all the sudden someone knocked on the bathroom door, 3 knocks
to be</b>
<br><b>exact.&nbsp; I yelled at my mom what she needed, noone answered.&nbsp;
I continued</b>
<br><b>taking my shower when it happened again.&nbsp; I got out of the

<br><b>&nbsp;Someone in our House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: encrodge@swbell.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Here is my experience with the "unusual".</b>
<br><b>Last July, my wife and I bought a house in Corpus Christi, TX.&nbsp;
While waiting for our furniture to arrive, my wife and I slept on an air
mattress in the den, and my oldest son slept next to us in a sleeping bag.&nbsp;
My son told me he had seen a light in the hall one night, and my wife said
that she had felt another presence in the room with us.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I later "purified" the
house with some sage, and went through every room and around every window
and door burning the sage and asking the entity to leave us in peace and
be at rest. I Could not cleanse the master bedroom closet due to it being
blocked.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We started to remodel
the house and while work was in progress, little things would come up missing.
Once we had made progress and the house started looking nice again, the
things stopped disappearing.&nbsp; Pretty much everything turned back up
later. But now for the really strange part. Nothing else in the house,
but I have been "goosed" on my butt twice in the last four months.&nbsp;
No one else in the yard with me. I wasn't scared, just really un-nerved
me.</b>

<p><b>The Shafter Schoolhouse Children</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: wicatawi@mindspring.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My husband and I were finally able to make a trip to Shafter, Texas
the week of Dec. 15-20, 2000.&nbsp; It had been 2 years since our last
trip to Presidio, Texas to visit with Bob Tucker and Karl Downing.&nbsp;
Karl had passed away in March, so restoration on the newer schoolhouse
had pretty much stopped.&nbsp; My husband and I had never stopped in Shafter
and Bob graciously consented to allow us to stay with him even though it
would be a busy work week for him.</b>
<br><b>My husband and I fell in love immediately with the solitude of the
place and all the possibilities of renovating such a glorious building.&nbsp;
I was especially fond of all the windows and the light streaming in, my
husband was more taken with the high ceilings and we both loved the spaciousness
of the rooms.&nbsp; Bob put us in the back room which still housed Karl's
bed knowing we would not mind sleeping there.&nbsp; Now, my husband and
I come from Fort Worth, Texas and are used to a lot of nightly noises,
and knowing that Bob prefers the quietness of the night we brought along
our own portable noise maker which we set on the bedside table.&nbsp; This
device had been working perfectly at home, however, there it would not
run longer than 30 minutes and then someone would turn it off!!&nbsp; It
works perfectly fine again, now that we have it at home.&nbsp;&nbsp; It
has a timer on it, but we did not set it, we let it run all night at home.&nbsp;
On the second and third nights we couldn't get it to stay on at all, it
would just flip back off, we both sat and watched it turn off.&nbsp; We
tried playing our radio in the same electrical socket and it would play
just fine.</b>
<br><b>Bob has known me for several years now and is used to me talking
about unexplained encounters, or unexplained encounters according to the
general public, I usually know who or what phenomenon I run across in the
course of my day.&nbsp; It might be others emotions, or a touch, sometimes
a whisper,&nbsp; perhaps even a quick glimpse of those who no linger need
their earthly bodies.&nbsp; Often dreams will impart a truth about the
past or future, encouraging me to track it down and prove what was spoken,
if only to myself.&nbsp; The ways in which our ancestors make themselves
known is as varied as the individual making contact.&nbsp; I believe everyone
has these experiences daily, most just may not understand their experience.</b>
<br><b>This trip to Shafter was one occasion in which I was driven by a
dream of two little girls who had been killed by a miner with dark curly
windblown hair.&nbsp; One girl was about 8 with blond hair and the other
about 11 with longer dark hair.&nbsp; It was one of those dreams I had
waited over a year to verify, but it just kept popping into my head.&nbsp;
I had originally thought it had taken place in the newer schoolhouse because
I was obsessed with the year 1940.&nbsp; But, nothing triggered a memory
in the newer school, however my husband and I both heard the distinct footsteps
of two children walk across the floor in the back bedroom.&nbsp; This occurred
on the first and third night we stayed with Bob.&nbsp; The old building
and the new one are separated by a small courtyard and both buildings have
a door that opens into this yard.&nbsp; I wondered if they were coming
in from the old building and walking straight across to the next courtyard
door, it is a straight path.&nbsp; You can see the newer courtyard door
in the background picture, it is the one on the right.&nbsp; We were not
afraid, just felt especially blessed to have little visitors.</b>
<br><b>Sunday was Bob's only day off and he took us on a tour of the grounds
and the old schoolhouse.&nbsp; I would love to get into the restoration
of the old building and the two separate water closets.&nbsp; The building
is rectangular and divided into four equal classrooms.&nbsp; We entered
the school by the front door and stepped into a small room with two doors
opening off it.&nbsp; The back classrooms are accessible by walking straight
through the first rooms or by a door on each side of the building.&nbsp;
It was the fourth room Bob showed us that had such a profound effect on
me.&nbsp; The back classroom on the right side of this building filled
me with such terror I could not cross thru the door!&nbsp; The fear and
whispers were so overwhelming I stopped and couldn't take a step.&nbsp;
That rarely happens to me, and it took a while for me to force myself over
the threshold.&nbsp; Exactly what happened in that room may never be proven,
but violence to children at the hands of a curly haired man permeates that
spot!&nbsp; The feeling has been so great I have continued to try to find
out what might have transpired there.&nbsp; I have spent every day searching
through the internet for what records I might find, but so far no luck.&nbsp;
My husband and Bob said they'd not felt anything special in the atmosphere
of this classroom, but I sensed it was the core of the dream I remembered
of the two young girls being murdered.&nbsp; Bob said none of the residents
remembered anything unusual taking place in the old schoolhouse during
the period of 1885-1942.&nbsp; However, I need no convincing, but feel
compelled to try to trace it down.&nbsp; Perhaps these two girls are different
from the two children that can be heard walking through the back room of
the newer school, there have been several reports of others who have stayed
there who heard them as well.&nbsp; No one has seemed to pick up on any
fear, or pain, from the children we heard, as a matter of fact the newer
school is a very welcoming place.&nbsp; It is possible the experience I
had in the old building was an entirely different pair of children.&nbsp;
It is so much easier for the earthly side of me to speak of gifted knowledge
received from unseen sources, when someone else has experienced it also.&nbsp;
To date I have never been pressed to unravel what my universal mind knows
and been wrong.&nbsp; In time I will know, if only for my own satisfaction...</b>
<br><b>As we strolled around the grounds of Shafter we could see what a
booming town it had once been.&nbsp; The walk along Cibolo Creek was spectacular,
I could spend all day down there just listening.&nbsp; On one spot I was
even overcome with the strong desire to just lie down, curl right up and
never leave that warm spot.&nbsp; Many of the old ruins still hold memories
of those who lived there and the two schoolhouses ring with the voices
and footsteps of a special time in our Texas history.&nbsp; My husband
and I were blessed by another shared incident just before we had to come
home.&nbsp; We discovered a dusty footprint on the bottom corner of our
bed.&nbsp; None had been in the house and Bob, Jerry, and I all denied
stepping up on the bed, indeed we all had on tennis shoes with treaded
bottoms and this shoe left a nice smooth print, just one though, a right
one to be exact.&nbsp; Jerry insisted it was a boot print, Bob only smiled
and said not one word.&nbsp; I'm sure he is quite used to his visitors
and my husband and I were grateful he chose to share them with us.....</b>

<br><b>Phantom House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SpiritWalker1042@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This experience happened to me when I was nine or ten years old.
I grew up in</b>
<br><b>Sacramento and was living in the Creekside apartments with my mom
and sister.</b>
<br><b>One day me and a bunch of other kids that lived in the apartments
decided to</b>
<br><b>go and explore the field that was next to the apartments. We walked
down to</b>
<br><b>the edge of the field and found a well worn trail in the grass that
went off</b>
<br><b>into the oak trees that were scattered around that side of the field.
We</b>
<br><b>wandered down the trail to see where it went. As we made our way
down the</b>
<br><b>trail an uneasy feeling came over us and we didn't know why. The
trail</b>
<br><b>suddenly opened up into a grassy area with an old delapidated house
sitting</b>
<br><b>in the middle of it. The house hadn't seen a drop of paint in years
and the</b>
<br><b>front porch was sagging,&nbsp; and looked like it could fall off
at any moment.</b>
<br><b>There was an old rocking chair sitting on the porch that looked
as old and</b>
<br><b>tired as the house. There was only an old screen door on the front
door and</b>
<br><b>the rest of the windows had the same old dark screens on them. We
dared each</b>
<br><b>other to go up and knock on the door and see if any one lived there,
but</b>
<br><b>decided to play somewhere else instead. A few days later we all
decided to go</b>
<br><b>down and look at the house again and this time we were gonna knock
on the</b>
<br><b>door. We walked down the trail and when it opened up into the grassy
area, we</b>
<br><b>couldn't believe what we saw. The house was gone. We looked all
over the</b>
<br><b>place and couldn't find anything. There wasn't a trace of anything
that</b>
<br><b>indicated a house had ever been there. Six or seven of us kids all
saw that</b>
<br><b>house. So we knew it wasn't our imagination.</b>

<p><b>Raised on the Supernatural</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;i have no problem believing stories such as these since not
only was i raised on them from my aunt, i lived through one my-self,&nbsp;
keep in mind i have no history of the house,&nbsp; actually the location
now throws me,&nbsp; all i remember was that it was a half steet.</b>
<br><b>when i was 8 years old my aunt and grandma took my sister and my-self
on a trip to my great-grandmothers.&nbsp; we did the food stops and even
paid a visit to the winchester house in san jose.&nbsp; wwhen we reached
my grandmothers house in hanford,ca i had cousins to play with and we explored
the lands which included an orcid and the house.&nbsp; in the back of my
grandmothers house was a bedroom my uncle was using at the time.&nbsp;
everytime i walked into the room i was cold, to the point i avoided the
room for the rest of the trip.&nbsp; one night it came about that two of
my great-aunts were coming to to see us cuz they haden`t seen ther sister
in awhile.&nbsp; the one who lived in new mexico flew to sacramento to
meet my other aunt and drove to hanford.&nbsp; i knew they were coming.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;about two oclock in the morning i heard someone knock on the
door.&nbsp; since i was sleeping in the livingroom i answered but no one
was there.&nbsp; i thought i dremt it&nbsp; and went to bed.&nbsp; not
ten minutes later i heard the knocking again so i got up to answer but
realized my grandmothers dogs weren`t barking.&nbsp; i opened the door
again but no noe was there.&nbsp; the third time i heard it i was spooked.&nbsp;
i was sure it was my great-aunts and the dogs weren`t barking because they
knew my aunts.&nbsp; when i opened the door again there was no one there
but i heard a little girl giggling.&nbsp; i slammed the door and woke my
aunt who was there and told her what had been happening.&nbsp; she came
insyantly wake to listen me then told me that there was a spirit of a little
girl in the house .&nbsp; she told me that it was years before my great-grandparents
bought the house alittle girl lived there with her family.&nbsp; she ended
up becoming really sick and died in her room, the back bedroom.&nbsp; the
only reason my aunt believed me was it also happened to her when she was
about my age and didn`t stop until i visited the house my first time when
i was a few months old.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;the last time i`ve visited my great-grandmothers house was
when my first born was less then a month old.&nbsp; i went to the back
bedroom thinking it was just my imaganation when i was younger.&nbsp; i
was wrong.&nbsp; the room was colder than i remember and i coudn`t stay
in there for more then a minute.&nbsp; thats my story.&nbsp; i know that
i was young but i will swear it`s the truth.</b>

<p><b>Not In My Head!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: amie_jannetto@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I don't know if this is in my head or not.&nbsp; It just seems weird
to me.&nbsp; Then</b>
<br><b>a friend of mine found your website.&nbsp; Which I have really found
interesting.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I was just wondering if you could answer a few questions
for me.</b>
<br><b>My husband and I live in an apartment in Minnesota, I feel like
there is a</b>
<br><b>woman's presence&nbsp; in our apartment.&nbsp; But my husband thinks
it's all in my</b>
<br><b>head.&nbsp; Nothing really weird ever happens, but it started about
a month after</b>
<br><b>I moved in with him.&nbsp; Which was in July of 1999 (we got married
in October</b>
<br><b>of 2000).&nbsp; But it seems that when I am watching TV in our living
room that</b>
<br><b>something is standing in front of our bathroom in the hallway just
staring</b>
<br><b>at me.&nbsp; Not doing anything.&nbsp; Or when I lay in bed and
watch TV that the same</b>
<br><b>thing is staring at me in the doorway to our walk-in closet.&nbsp;
But I always</b>
<br><b>feel like it is staring at me.&nbsp; Then, although I'm not all
that organized, I</b>
<br><b>do know where I put my clothes.&nbsp; Even though a lot of them
are on the floor.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; But I'll be talking on the phone to a (any) girlfriend.&nbsp;
If I state what I</b>
<br><b>am going to where that night before I go out.&nbsp; I can't find
either the top</b>
<br><b>or the pants or some part of the outfit.&nbsp; Then when I come
home it's always</b>
<br><b>sitting on top of my hamper.&nbsp; My husband thinks I just over
looked it.&nbsp; When</b>
<br><b>I know I didn't.&nbsp; Now I am pregnant and I almost feel like
she's there more</b>
<br><b>often.&nbsp; Almost like she's jealous sometimes.&nbsp; I've never
seen anything ever.</b>
<br><b>Still back when this all started happening.&nbsp; My husband called
me one</b>
<br><b>morning after I had left for work, telling me he had a weird dream.&nbsp;
Or what</b>
<br><b>he then thought it was a dream because he was talking to me.&nbsp;
But he said he</b>
<br><b>knew I had gotten up for work that morning (he works goofy shifts
so</b>
<br><b>sometimes he goes in later than I do) and thought that he heard
me leave.</b>
<br><b>But he said he felt me come back to bed.&nbsp; That I had even kissed
him and</b>
<br><b>said good morning.&nbsp; But then when he opened his eyes I wasn't
there.</b>
<br><b>Looking at the clock I had left at least an hour before that.&nbsp;
That night</b>
<br><b>was the first time I felt I was not alone in our home.&nbsp; Even
though my</b>
<br><b>husband (then fiancee) was not home from work and we had no roommates.</b>
<br><b>Do you think it could be in my head?&nbsp; Like my husband says
- just an over</b>
<br><b>active imagination. Could there really be something there?&nbsp;
Why doesn't</b>
<br><b>anybody feel its presence?&nbsp; I've never seen anything.&nbsp;
Besides my clothes</b>
<br><b>disappearing for a few hours.&nbsp; I've never heard of anything
like this</b>
<br><b>happening before.&nbsp; I've always been up for a good ghost story.&nbsp;
This even</b>
<br><b>seems weird to me.</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp;My Haunted Domain--the Story of my Haunted House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: preapare4defeat@netscape.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My house is haunted. I know that they are human spirits and that
there is more than one because of various experiences. There was an old
lady who died in the house right before we moved in when I was about 3.
Before that, a fairly wealthy family lived in the house in the 1890`s (no
one really moved then so they probably lived and died there). I began to
levitate in my sleep and have vivid dreams of floating and looking down
on things. When I woke up, I would fall back down on my bed as if I had
been on a tour of Earth from heaven and it abruptly ended. Sometimes my
bed shakes at night and I hear footsteps in the attic. Little balls of
light which I later found out as a result of curiousity, were orbs that
flew across my room, my brother`s room, and in the hallway at night. Things
always seem to disappear from places too. Ironicly, these things only seem
to happen to me. I only recently found out why: Remember when you were
very little, and you lived in that house with the old !</b>
<br><b>lady in it that no one else could see? You would wake up in the
middle of the night and see that little boy standing there and you began
to talk and your mother comes in to see who in the world you`re talking
to but the boy has vanished, and no matter how many times you try to tell
her, she reasures you it was only your "vivid imagination" and tells you
to go back to sleep.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;This is what happens in the young childhood of a non-believer.
Even if it really is an imaginary friend and your parents tell you Fred
doesn`t exsist, they are teaching you to block out images you can now see
but you will eventually train yourself to believe that they don`t exsist.
You will never know the emotions of a ghost presence, nor sense them, making
you completely unaware that they are among you.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;This is how my younger brother and my mother were both taught.
That is why it happens to me and me alone. From an e-mail I received while
I contemplated about a presence in my home, I found out the "haunted house
test" concluded "positive."</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Some of my most recent experiences have occured over the past
year or 2. I don`t think the activity level increased, but that I began
to pay more attention to the subject and things going on. I think the reason
for this is that I have, over the past year, wondered about the topic,
and did some serious thinking. I am a student, but we are supposed to know
what we want to do for a career. I have always been interested in the paranormal
so that is what I decided to take on. This made me think back on my own
personal expieriences. That`s when I noticed it.</b>
<br><b>I began to notice the orbs, the footsteps, the shaking bed and not
only that but things I didn`t notice before. I began to see things; Mists,
vortexes, figures... I also began to see them become clearer and more visable.
I noticed them more &amp; more. That was when I saw it. That was when I
saw a full bodied, detailed apparition.</b>
<br><b>My room and my brother`s room are almost exactly across from one
another and outside of my door frame, you can make out my brother`s whole
room. One night, my brother wanted to sleep in my room even though he`s
kind of big, but I said yes anyway because it was comforting I guess. Now,
he sometimes stays up and annoys me so when he acts up, I threaten him
by saying get out, but of course, he is unruly. As a response, I pretend
to go downstairs and tell my mom that he came in my room and he won`t get
out. On this particular night, he was acting up ans I was going to pull
my usual response. I was outside my door, my brother was in my bed, and
there it was, a vivid, detailed, misty blue transparent form. It was sort
of like a scarecrow, no nose, and wearing some sort of hat that was completly
unlike anything else I have seen in my life. It was the figure of a boy,
sitting up in his bed, smiling at me. Personally, I was too freaked to
look at every detail, but the form was crystal !</b>
<br><b>clear to make out. I DID NOT want to stick around and find out whether
it was solid or not, so I became faster than a speeding bullet and able
to leap tall buildings.&nbsp; Whatever I could to get away from it as fast
and far as I could. I bolted back in my room and LITERALLY dove on my bed
and underneath my covers.</b>
<br><b>Another thing that happens is that I got this keyboard over Christmas
where the keys light up and it demos if your not playing it for a while.
Anyway, I don`t think that it`s supposed to turn the switch back on by
itself (that you have to PHYSICALLY move!) and play songs with no sound
coming from it when I know that when I last used, it I had the volume on
three and now it`s on zero. This is why I moniter myself after I`m done
using and make mental notes that I have turned it off. Once or twice, I
have unplugged it, and it is on again after I walk back into the room.
My reactions to this are mixed. Sometimes I get a little spooked but usually
I find it cool that it can and does do that.&nbsp; Sometimes it annoys
me because it sometimes doesn`t shut it off when the spirit is done using
it.</b>
<br><b>I had another recent experience that was positive; a feeling of
recognition; a feeling of significance. I was babysitting my brother and
my mother`s boyfriend`s son one Friday night. By 1:00 a.m., I was tired
from chasing around 2 little kids all night long. Aaron, My mother`s boyfriend`s
son slept on the couch. He is afraid of the dark so he makes me sleep downstairs
with him. I stayed up late working on a website on my pc when my brother,
Chris, came downstairs. It was so late for him, that he fell asleep on
the chair in my living room watching me. I decided that it was late, and
soon after, I went to sleep on the end of the recliner open. Then, as I
was almost asleep, I felt a gentle pat on my lap. I opened my eyes but
the only sign of someone was that next to me, there was a basin shape in
the blanket as if someone invisable was sitting next to next to me. I was
not cold, but instead, I felt warm inside as if someone is watching over
me. I think the pat was to say good job!</b>
<br><b>. It made me feel loved and needed.</b>
<br><b>My mother thinks I`m crazy, my brother thinks I`m crazy and you
might even say I`m crazy, but I know I`m not. I know there are residents
seen and unseen. It can be&nbsp; a little spooky at times but the bottom
line: Ghosts live amoung my house and it is facsinating to know that you
can communitcate after death and that there is a presence, within my haunted
house.</b><b></b>

<br><b>He's Walking</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: darno@peoplepc.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was married my wife and we would hear him walking upstairs
when we were in the basement.&nbsp; She saw him in the middle of the night,
once leaning on the chest of drawers (she could see his silhouette against
the window) watching us sleep.&nbsp; Once again she woke me screaming "he's
in the doorway, he's in the doorway", as she scooted farther and farther
against me scared to death.&nbsp; I have heard his footsteps pass the couch
as I sat on it and could feel the cool draft.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once my wife
and I were in the basement,&nbsp; our dog and cat were on the a small landing
at the top of the stairs.&nbsp; As we heard his footsteps and both watched
the ceiling above us following the sound of his footsteps,&nbsp; the cat
and dog looked up to the door above them where he would have stopped.&nbsp;
The cat arched his back and hissed.&nbsp; I'm divorced now, but he has
been active again recently.&nbsp; I have been awakened by a loud bang at
my bedroom door.&nbsp; I had had it closed , mostly because I'm not too
comfortable with this guy.&nbsp; I don't know what made the noise.&nbsp;
when I looked nothing was laying on the floor or anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;
About a week ago I heard a radio alarm go off in the other bedroom.&nbsp;
It first it came on very clear and then starting getting staticy as if
someone was trying to change channels.&nbsp; On top of that the touch lamp
was on.&nbsp; Three days ago I went into the spare bedroom again, found
the door to the closet open and closed it.&nbsp; When I went back out into
the livingroom I heard something hit the floor.&nbsp; When I went back
in I found the radio on the floor.&nbsp; It would not have been an easy
task to get that radio off the table since the cord was somewhat wrapped
around the raised edge.&nbsp; I'm getting a little concerned. He seems
to be gaining strength.&nbsp; I have thought about calling a priest, hoping
he could bless the house.&nbsp; I'm checking your website hoping that I
might find a way of dealing with him.&nbsp; Hoping to find out what he
may need or want.&nbsp; Charles, Hamilton, Ohio.</b><b></b>

me believe I have a ghost living here with me was when I was 6 years old
and we just moved in the house. I was wide awake and I saw this face in
my mirrior and I had just woken up from a nightmare and I screamed for
my parents becuase they sleep on the other side of the house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second was when I was 7 and I was siting
up and I felt a bug crawl on my leg and I flip the bed sheets over and
there was bugs all over the bed. I screamed for parents and my dad came
in and asked what was wrong. I said "Bugs lots of bugs" and I look down
and they were gone and I said " they were here daddy" and he said "go to
sleep" so I did. And that did it for me I became a beilever so fast.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then later on when I was 10 my mom told me something.
She told me that I have E.S.P. . And me and her both can hear and see things
that my brother dad can't. Me and her work together and we get scared all
the time by these unsual sightings. I remmber when I was 11 I woke up with
this dark and cold and evil feeling. I stayed in my bed scared for about
2 hours then I ran out of the room to my parents full speed (thanks to
that I ran into the wall) I got up and ran to thier bed side. My mom woke
up right a way when I stood there. Then I said "there is someone else in
the house" and my mom shot up so fast . (when i was 5 a man broke into
the house and that news terrified her stiff) She woke up my dad and he
got up and looked around and I started to cry and say " There is someone
here I didn't see them but I know they are here make them go away" . My
mom got even more terrified becuase I never cry (i am those tough cookie
girls that are so stuborrn they don't ask for help when they need it) My
dad walked to us irrated by this and said "there is no one here go back
to sleep" and my mom walked me to bed and I didn't go to sleep and I got
the feeling again and I stayed up crying the whole night till dawn.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I have had alot of experiences and I am having one right
now as we speak . I can hear whispers in the back ground right now and
the bathroom light is not turing on or off it has that click noise when
you turn it off or on over and over again . I have gotten use to some but
others have left me screaming in terror and running out of the house&nbsp;
in fear.</b>

<p><b>Strange Voices</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: rtarantelli@SYGMAnetwork.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Unfortunately, I do not have much of a paranormal experience to</b>
<br><b>share.&nbsp; About the closest thing to come to mind was about 7
years</b>
<br><b>ago when my brother in-law and I went to a cemetery late one night</b>
<br><b>and left a tape recorder on a tombstone for about an hour.&nbsp;
We</b>
<br><b>retrieved the recorder and went home to hear the tape.&nbsp; The
tape</b>
<br><b>had some very strange noises that we could not identify.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>heard a lot of what sounded like branches falling and breaking,
we</b>
<br><b>heard a very noisy truck that sounded like it was driving right
next</b>
<br><b>to the recorder, and we also heard what sounded like muffled</b>
<br><b>voices.&nbsp; The strange thing about the noises were there were
no</b>
<br><b>trees or branches anywhere close to where we left the recorder,</b>
<br><b>and the closest road was about 1/2 mile away.&nbsp; We played the</b>
<br><b>tape for my brother in-law's girlfriend and her son, and they were
so</b>
<br><b>shaken by the noises they made us shut off the recorder.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>brother in-law has the tape and I was looking for it about six</b>
<br><b>months ago and unfortunately he couldn't locate it.</b>

<p><b>Just Some Weird Stuff</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mraines@insurancemasters.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, well I don't know if this counts but I do have some weird</b>
<br><b>experiences, things my neighbors had told me, and stuff a old friend
had</b>
<br><b>experienced.</b>
<br><b>Well I am from Chicago now living in Las Vegas and a long time ago
in my</b>
<br><b>old house some weird stuff happened.&nbsp; My room was in the basement
and my</b>
<br><b>water bed faced this little stained glass window that was high up
on the</b>
<br><b>wall.&nbsp; The streetlight from outside was one of those orangey
colored</b>
<br><b>ones, well I woke up with this feeling of terror and at the end
of my</b>
<br><b>bed outlined in orange was the silluette (might be spelled wrong)
of a</b>
<br><b>man in a cowboy like hat and a cape.&nbsp; I ducked under the covers
and</b>
<br><b>waited in terror.&nbsp; It could have been a dream, but it felt
so real.</b>
<br><b>Another weird experience is, in Chicago there was a kids show called
the</b>
<br><b>Bozo Show, about colorful clowns and Bozo buckets well anyway, I
had a</b>
<br><b>doll that looked alot like Bozo and never really liked it when I
was</b>
<br><b>young.&nbsp; It was kinda like the clown doll in the poltergeist
movie, well</b>
<br><b>I was chilling in my room and heard a sound at the door like tapping
and</b>
<br><b>shuffling, I looked out there thinking the cat might want in, and</b>
<br><b>nothing was there.&nbsp; So a little bit of time went by and the
sound came</b>
<br><b>back and when I went out there, the Bozo doll was proped up against
my</b>
<br><b>door.&nbsp; It really freaked my out so we had a very old dishwasher
upstairs</b>
<br><b>that didn't work and I locked the doll in there.&nbsp; It might
be in there</b>
<br><b>to this very day.&nbsp; My dad was the only person home and he is
not much of</b>
<br><b>a prankster, but one of the cats could have dragged it all the way</b>
<br><b>downstairs but it was a big doll.</b>
<br><b>My neighbors used to live on Elm street (figures) and a old house
of</b>
<br><b>theirs was haunted and probably still is.&nbsp; My friend said at
night she</b>
<br><b>would look up and watch the stars on her ceiling when she was a
little</b>
<br><b>girl.&nbsp; Her mom wouldn't talk about the house.</b>
<br><b>Then in highschool I had a friend that had a chiwawa called brownie,
it</b>
<br><b>died soon after I met her, supposedly her and her brother and sister</b>
<br><b>would still see the dog run through the house at night and also
a black</b>
<br><b>cat.&nbsp; And her little brother when he was young would point
at the corner</b>
<br><b>of the ceiling and say Gama Gama (Grandma).&nbsp; They say his dead</b>
<br><b>grandmother would float in the corner and watch over him and his</b>
<br><b>family.&nbsp; Scary.</b>
<br><b>So here are a few stories of mine, I love your website and read
all the</b>
<br><b>stories, I don't really know what to believe but I do know I get
chills</b>
<br><b>reading and picturing these stories.&nbsp; If you use mine, tell
me.</b><b></b>

<p><b>I Always Seem To Be Alone</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: patmarie@attcanada.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>When i was growing up I lived in a mobile home in nova scotia. Things
began happening after we moved the mobile home to some land my Dad had
purchased.&nbsp; Whenever I was alone I would feel like someone was watching
me and I would feel nervous. I was about 8 when I first moved there.&nbsp;
I have several stories but I guess the one which affected me most was on
an easter morning when i was 8 years old.</b>
<br><b>I was asleep when all of the sudden i felt cold wind on my face...this
was impossible because the windows had been shut up with plastic in between
the frames to keep out the cold...so i remember thinking "where is the
wind coming from?" then i felt my bed being raised and i felt like i was
spinning even though there was not enough room in my bedroom for me to
be spinning...i was keeping my eyes shut because i was so scared i thought
i would have a heartattack if i saw what was happening...then i felt as
though i was dropped and there was silence i thought it was over and i
wanted to see if i was alone so i took a deep breath and peeked my head
out from under the blankets where i was hiding...I could not believe my
eyes it was a large egg shaped flourencent type orb right in between my
body and my wall...I put my head back under the blanket...and started to
hyperventilate...then i felt something jump on the bed...i held my breath...it
began actually walking up my body it had very little feet whatever it was
but when it got to the top of the bed i suddenly felt my chest being crushed
under a lot of weight I knew i could not stand it anymore i ripped the
blankets off my face and all there was was a greyness as though i was blind
it was not dark it was just grey...</b>
<br><b>i began screaming hysterically and my mother appeared in the doorway
and i could suddenly see and the lights in the hallway were on...my mother
told me that it was just a dream and that it was probably my cat...all
i knew was what i felt and with all the other things that happened besides
that night that i was not alone...i got a night light after that and i
would stay up reading all night until i passed out...i seemed when these
things happened that it was as though the entire household was breathing
in and out like the volume was on high...</b>
<br><b>When i was 10&nbsp; years old my parents divorced and my dad continued
to live there...i had other things happen right up until i was 18 years
old when my dad bought a house...then my dad rented out the home to friends
of our family who right away came to us with their stories and only then
did my father admit his encounters which matched mine of seeing a child...t.v
turned on and off...lights turning off...noises...i guess the ghosts has
become harmful now and they are getting a priest to come...I am just happy
that I was really not alone...but i sure felt like it at the time...I have
had spirit encounters in most other places i have lived at but the one
there was the most connected to myself...i have come to think of there
being more that one spirit and someday i may discover what the story is
behind them...sometimes I think that the little spirit may have become
lonely when i left and stopped reading out loud every night...she may have
missed our bedtime stories...</b>

<p><b>&nbsp; Family Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Jaskatjad@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello My name is Kelley...Before I got on with stories that actually</b>
<br><b>happened to my family..Mikey and I are deaf parents of four hearing
children.</b>
<br><b>We live in townhouse that is behind Main St Restaurant in Cape Cod,
Mass..</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I have several experince to share with you all... This place
we live in now</b>
<br><b>is a place that used to be for people who just came out of prison
and in need</b>
<br><b>of place to live in while trying to make some living.This place
is owned by</b>
<br><b>former policeman who likes to help ex- inmates to earn their living
and he</b>
<br><b>also owns factory that which he will hire inmate to start off with
jobs to do</b>
<br><b>to earn some money.. Anyway, one of those guy got depressed and
hung up in</b>
<br><b>one of those four apartments which I do not know which one..</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;When the activties of ghost appeared, I had two small children
with me.. I</b>
<br><b>was in hurry to leave the place to go somewhere.. I searched thru
out the</b>
<br><b>apartment for my son Jason's shoes. I couldn't not find it..as I
would like</b>
<br><b>to add that I love to read anything about true ghosts stories. I
jokingly</b>
<br><b>told my place as I left that they are to help me look for Jason's
shoes for</b>
<br><b>me and put it where I can find it before I come home.&nbsp; I left
and one hour</b>
<br><b>later I came back with kids in tow..As I open the door, of course
yu can</b>
<br><b>guess&nbsp; there is Jason's shoes in middle of living room that
I can't</b>
<br><b>impossiblily miss it..</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Mikey's experince...He took all of kids upstairs one night
to brush their</b>
<br><b>teeth before going to bed at night. He went into his bedroom to
take</b>
<br><b>something out.. He saw in mirror which he can see into hallway ..just
in time</b>
<br><b>to see Jason running into his room. He was not too pleased that
Jason ran</b>
<br><b>into bedroom with toothbrush in his mouth. He walked quickly to
bedroom to</b>
<br><b>call Jason to come to him.. He felt tap on his back to see Jason
looking at</b>
<br><b>him.. He asked him&nbsp; if he did just run into bedroom from bathroom.
He say no</b>
<br><b>He was in bathroom in whole time. MIkey swears that in mirror he
did see boy</b>
<br><b>that looks like my son Jason run into bedroom and there is no way
that he</b>
<br><b>overlook Jason run back into bathroom from bedroom.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night I got violently sick and
went to bed early to sleep it off.</b>
<br><b>I felt my bed being bumped (I cannot hear sounds soo I relay heavily
on</b>
<br><b>vibration to let me know what is going on in my small room) as someone
walked</b>
<br><b>by. I ingored it thinking it was Mikey or kids coming in my room
to check on</b>
<br><b>me. As I laid down with my back to where the bumping occured. Then
I felt</b>
<br><b>someone rubbing my back as to say that I will be okay and it was
reassuring</b>
<br><b>rubbing..I woke up to acknowledge that I appreicate their concern.
No one was</b>
<br><b>there for me to thank to..For some reason I was not scared at all..
I just</b>
<br><b>went back to sleep. Later that night...for strange reason my son
Jason age 6</b>
<br><b>woke me up crying that he can hear voices.. I was scared that someone
could</b>
<br><b>be breaking in and I cannot hear what is going on..Thinking its
breaking in</b>
<br><b>so I woke up Mike of course being the man to check and guard us
all from</b>
<br><b>predators. He checked all thru out the house.. Nothing is out of
order or</b>
<br><b>anything at all that could be making some kind of noise that we
forgot to</b>
<br><b>turn off. We assured Jason that he will be okay...He went back to
sleep..</b>
<br><b>After we woke up in morning.. I asked my son for more clear specific
answer</b>
<br><b>to my question on what sound he was hearing. He explained to me
that he heard</b>
<br><b>voice talking to him right in above of his bed..and also voice moved
to his</b>
<br><b>sleeping brother. It sounded like it was being flying all over the
room and</b>
<br><b>voice saying Ill get you as if he was joking around. I got chillies
up my</b>
<br><b>spine..Also one more thing&nbsp; when I took picture in digital
camera for my</b>
<br><b>freind Carljo..there was some strange bright orange ball in front
of her when</b>
<br><b>I took picture of her. Digital Camera usually don't make those kind
of</b>
<br><b>mistakes. I am sorry it doesn't too scarey or too common.. That
is how I got</b>
<br><b>my experinces.. That is not my only experince too as I used to live
in</b>
<br><b>dormority school for the deaf in Washington DC. I get all those
ghosties</b>
<br><b>touching and poking me around in there..</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hauntings at the Elkhorn Lodge</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bullsix6@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>i live and work at the elkhorn lodge, the oldest continuosly operated
lodge in colorado. during the summer of 2000 my wife and i had just returned
to the lodge at around 1030 p.m. . we noticed a group of people standing
around the front door to the lodge. i went to investigate only to discover
a rather large man (6'4"&nbsp; 300lbs) in the doorway with just the sheets
from the bed around him. thinking this was strange i asked him what was
going on? he told me he had gone to bed when suddenly the door to his room
opened, jumping up he ran to the door and looked down the hall. seeing
noone he returned to bed thinking someone was playing tricks. this time
he made sure the deadbolt was secure and the door was shut tightly. just
as he lay down the door opened and closed, grabbing the sheets around him
he bolted for the front lobby. this man had arrived planning to stay just
one night, he stayed for a week hoping for a new encounter.</b>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hospital in Raleigh</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: BarbiG16@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My mother works at what used to be the old Hospital in downtown Raleigh,
NC</b>
<br><b>and she hasn't nessicarily had any experiences there, but a few
of her</b>
<br><b>friends have. They all know that I'm really into ghosts and stuff
so they</b>
<br><b>feel that they'll share it with me, I guess I'm kind of a game,
maybe to see</b>
<br><b>if they can scare me or not, but just going to her office gives
me the</b>
<br><b>willies.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It wasn't that long ago that one of the ladies
who works on the floor</b>
<br><b>with my mother, which by the way used to be the section where they'd
keep the</b>
<br><b>patients who just had heart surgery or something like that. Well,
one day</b>
<br><b>before everyone came in to work my moms friend was dropped off by
her</b>
<br><b>husband, the only other people there were the security guards who
were on the</b>
<br><b>first floor at the door. She took the stairs up to the second floor
and she</b>
<br><b>walked into her office, she decided to do some work awaiting her
coworkers to</b>
<br><b>come b/c she didn't feel all that wonderful being up there alone.
No one had</b>
<br><b>ever talked about the place being haunted so there was no way she
could have</b>
<br><b>come up with this due to another story. She was working at her desk
when all</b>
<br><b>of a sudden she heard a squeaking, she looked out the door into
the hallway</b>
<br><b>and heard nothing, so she went back to filling out the paper work,
when she</b>
<br><b>heard it again. It sounded almost like a wheel on a grocery cart
that would</b>
<br><b>wobble back and forth. She was starting to get a little nervous,
but thinking</b>
<br><b>maybe it's just my imagination she stepped out into the hallway
and looked</b>
<br><b>towards the end closest to her office and saw nothing. When she
turned around</b>
<br><b>she saw an old stretcher sitting out in the hall at the opposite
end from her</b>
<br><b>office. She freaked out and bolted to the stairs, running down to
security,</b>
<br><b>she asked them if there may possibly be any stretchers left from
when the</b>
<br><b>office used to be a hospital. The guard answered no, there's none
left here</b>
<br><b>they were all taken out and either given to the mental institution
or taken</b>
<br><b>to the dumps. She was to scared to go back upstairs until more people
in the</b>
<br><b>office got there, well when they all went back upstairs it was gone,
and I</b>
<br><b>know it goes without saying that u know she didn't go back to work
early EVER</b>
<br><b>again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are more stories about my moms work such
as another ladies'</b>
<br><b>picture frame that had the Lords Prayer was up on her office wall,
it was a</b>
<br><b>private office, and when she came into work one day she found it
laying on</b>
<br><b>her floor. She picked it up, put it back on the wall, and sat down
at her</b>
<br><b>desk...the picture literally FLEW off the wall and hit the corner
of her</b>
<br><b>desk. She thought it strange but put it back up and called her mother
who was</b>
<br><b>a very strong Catholic. She told her daughter to let it go for a
little while</b>
<br><b>and see what was going on and if it happened again to call her.
Well, they</b>
<br><b>didn't have to wait b/c the picture flew off and hit the corner
of the desk</b>
<br><b>again, the mother said for her to hang up some rosary beads over
the picture</b>
<br><b>and see what happened. The next day that's just what she did and
sure enough</b>
<br><b>it never fell off the wall again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure if there's just one spirit there
or more than one there at</b>
<br><b>her office, but it wouldn't suprise me that maybe they're still
hanging</b>
<br><b>around there b/c that's where they died. Spirits have been known
to haunt</b>
<br><b>where they died simply because they know no better. But if u ask
me, maybe</b>
<br><b>the ones who are still there have some reason they're angry at the
building</b>
<br><b>or something, either way, it gives me the creeps to walk in there
when I want</b>
<br><b>to go see my Mom, I don't see how anyone could stand to work there!!!</b>
