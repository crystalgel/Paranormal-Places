<P>
<P><B>Ok, I have two, but they aren't in much detail since they happened
when I</B>
<P><B>was little.  I will also include other experiences that my family has
had,</B>
<P><B>seeing as that my Grandmothers house is haunted.</B>
<P><B>When I was about 2, my parents took me up to "Honey"  my mothers mothers
</B>
<P><B>house.  Located in a remote part of Connecticut, it is nestled deep
in the </B>
<P><B>woods  It was built about 30 years ago, by my mothers parents.  On
that</B>
<P><B>first day, my father took me up into "Honey's"  room, which is said
to be the</B>
<P><B>heart of the house.  Spooky things happen there, but since my Gramma
is almost </B>
<P><B>deaf, she can't hear anything.  He lay me down on her bed and began
to</B>
<P><B>change my diaper, when I said, very clearly</B>
<P><B>"Daddy, why are all those faces looking down at me?" </B>
<P><B> He looked at me and said "What faces sweetie?"  And then shot a</B>
<P><B>cautious glance over his shoulder.  </B>
<P><B>"The faces!"  I shrieked and began to laugh.  "The faces!  The </B>
<P><B>faces!"</B>
<P><B>He took me out of the room right away and we still look back on </B>
<P><B>"the faces" and wonder what exactly I saw that day.</B>
<P>
<P><B>STORY #2</B>
<P>
<P><B>     Ok, this is kinda about all the different things that have happened
at </B>
<P><B>my gramma's over the years.</B>
<P><B>   At my grandmothers house, many things happen.   Door slam when </B>
<P><B>there's no one upstairs, and when you go up to look, not a door will
be</B>
<P><B>shut. </B>
<P><B>  You can hear footsteps running down the halls, ghostly apparitions
float </B>
<P><B>through the halls, making themselves known to few select people, and
a </B>
<P><B>mysterious light wanders the house.  But these ghosts are friendly
and they </B>
<P><B>never hurt anyone. </B>

<P><B> GHOST STORY</B>
<P><B>By:    Regmedasst@aol.com&gt;</B>
<P>
<P><B>My home has a ghost. I know this because it has been seen, it doesn't
bother </B>
<P><B>us, infact it watches over us. one day my husband and daughter left
for work </B>
<P><B>I was still asleep, I guess when they left one of them didn't close
the door </B>
<P><B>properly,. after a while with the wind blowing the door opened, I kept
</B>
<P><B>hearing someone calling my name to wake up, i woke up and just lyed
there in </B>
<P><B>bed wondering who could be calling my name since i was alone, again
i heard </B>
<P><B>my name being called as if the person was right there in my bedroom.
I </B>
<P><B>finally got out of bed to look around. As soon as I left my bedroom
to go </B>
<P><B>down the stairs I realized my front door was wide open. Anyone could
have </B>
<P><B>walked in. I believe that the ghost  was warning me, trying to let
me know </B>
<P><B>that the door was open. There have been other instances Similar to
this. I </B>
<P><B>believe it looks out for me and my family,</B>

<P>
<P><B>When I was younger I was asleep and I woke up. I looked at the clock</B>
<P><B>and it said somewhere around 3:28 am. I turned my head slightly to
the</B>
<P><B>left and I saw a girl, I would say she was in her early teens, she</B>
<P><B>looked very blury and yet clear at the same time. she was moving in
slow</B>
<P><B>motion it seemed like she was underwater or something. She had a long</B>
<P><B>nitegown on and it was blowing very slowly. She was holding a short</B>
<P><B>candle stick and her hair was a long reddish-brown color. She looked
at</B>
<P><B>me and I looked back at her. I was suprisingly calm. I got up to tell
my</B>
<P><B>mom what I had seen. The next morning I woke up and I asked my mom
If</B>
<P><B>she saw the lady and she said "What lady?" could this all have been
a</B>
<P><B>dream I'm not sure. I've been deeply confused about this since.</B>
<P>
<P><B> Glowing Red Eyes</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:  rite2u@go.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>In 7th grade I moved to a new school and soon met a girl my age and
we</B>
<P><B>quickly became best of friends.  A few months into our friendship she
began</B>
<P><B>to confide in me about the problems going on in her house.  She claimed
it</B>
<P><B>was haunted by the spirit of a young girl.  A modest, 1 story house
I</B>
<P><B>estimate to have been (at the time of the hauntings 1971-74) maybe
25-30</B>
<P><B>years old.  She lived there with her mom, 5 yr old sister &amp; 4 year
old</B>
<P><B>twins.  Without giving away the precise location, I will only say it
was in</B>
<P><B>a suburb of Los Angeles. I've told this story to my children and a
few</B>
<P><B>years back we were in the L.A area and sure enough the house still
stands.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Anyway, my friend told me how stuffed animals and similar toys
floated</B>
<P><B>across a room then suddenly drop, the family's personal items would</B>
<P><B>dissappear only to turn up in a crawl space in the top of her
bedroom,</B>
<P><B>knocking was heard on the walls with no apparent physical cause,
nothing</B>
<P><B>was there to do the knocking.  What made this more bizarre and chilling
was</B>
<P><B>the movie The Exorcist had come out during this time period.  My
rational</B>
<P><B>mind said, okay, someone in the house is making this stuff up!    </B>
<P>
<P><B>After putting up with these disturbances for what I was suppose was
6</B>
<P><B>months to a year my friend's mom brought in a priest to bless the
home.</B>
<P><B>Being 12 yrs old at the time she was telling me these things, my
memory</B>
<P><B>fails me on exact details. Please forgive me where I am not entirely
clear</B>
<P><B>in my descriptions.</B>
<P>
<P><B>After the blessing had been done is where I entered this friendship,
so I</B>
<P><B>don't claim to have personally seen toys floating or being around
when</B>
<P><B>things were dissappearing.  I spent days and nights in this home after
we</B>
<P><B>became friends, but yet nothing out of the ordinary occurred. Or should
I</B>
<P><B>say, "nothing that I was aware of".  My friend told me that though
the</B>
<P><B>house had been blessed, (there were rosary beads in every doorway),
she</B>
<P><B>said whatever was causing the problems hadn't left.  Yes, it had
quieted</B>
<P><B>down, but things were still dissappearing and she heard "noises". 
Her</B>
<P><B>mother was certain that the blessing had solved the haunting (or so
she led</B>
<P><B>us to believe she believed this).  The happenings prior to the blessing
had</B>
<P><B>upset her mom greatly (naturally!) so she wanted to keep the
continuing</B>
<P><B>incidences from her mom.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>What scared me about the house initially was the bathroom. A
unnerving</B>
<P><B>feeling came over me when I entered this room. A small bathroom with
an</B>
<P><B>ancient clawfoot tub and fixtures that I'm sure were from the 50's,
more</B>
<P><B>than anywhere in this house the bathroom gave me an eerie feeling
that</B>
<P><B>someone/thing was there, and it didn't want me there.  In fact, I
never</B>
<P><B>took a bath in that bathroom the entire 2 years we were best friends
(I</B>
<P><B>bathed at home!)  When it was necessary to use the bathroom I got out
as</B>
<P><B>quickly as I could!  Even if I wanted to stay in there longer, it was</B>
<P><B>almost as if an unseen prescence forced me to leave the room.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Apparently, I wasn't wrong in feeling this way about the bathroom.
 The</B>
<P><B>story I was told was that a 5 year old girl was drowned in this very</B>
<P><B>bathroom and tub by her father.  This happened decades before my friend
and</B>
<P><B>family moved in.  She was the little girl who was haunting the
family.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The first of 2 incidences that I can personally attest to happened
during</B>
<P><B>a sleepover at her house  when we were up late, as usual, perhaps 3
in the</B>
<P><B>morning.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>We were in her room when she said something to me that I don't
exactly</B>
<P><B>recall, or why she even knew, but she told me to just listen.  Well
I</B>
<P><B>listened and what I heard I will not forget.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Her room faced the living room and through the closed door came the
sound</B>
<P><B>of voices.  Many voices, like a large crowd of party-goers.  I
couldn't</B>
<P><B>make out words, they were all talking at once.  I could hear walking
around</B>
<P><B>on the floor.  If you could imagine turning up the volume from silence
to</B>
<P><B>loud, this is what it sounded like.  But there was no one out there,
let</B>
<P><B>alone a crowd of people in her living room at 3 in the morning! As
suddenly</B>
<P><B>as it began it ceased, to total silence.  There was no else up in the</B>
<P><B>family, they had been fast asleep for hours.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>The 2nd incident happened to me during the daylight hours.  Her mom
was in</B>
<P><B>the kitchen, my friend and the younger kids were in the backyard of
the</B>
<P><B>house.  I had gone to my friend's room to get something.</B>
<P><B>Her mom was a big fan of these pull-down shades that darken a room,
I</B>
<P><B>guess to guard against the heat of summer.  Therefore, the room was
quite</B>
<P><B>dark.  I had gotten whatever it was (don't recall what) I went there
for</B>
<P><B>and was getting ready to walk out the door</B>
<P><B>when I felt someone was looking at me.  I was compelled to turn back
to</B>
<P><B>face the room as I opened the door.  Low on the floor near the bed
were a</B>
<P><B>pair of red, glowing eyes, staring back at me.  Because of the low
position</B>
<P><B>to the floor at first I thought it must be a cat.  But I kept looking
at</B>
<P><B>these glowing, flame red eyes and it was as if I was arguing with my
mind,</B>
<P><B>saying no, a cat's eyes don't light up like that!</B>
<P>
<P><B>As I continued to be frozen in place it became clearer to me what I
was</B>
<P><B>seeing.</B>
<P><B>My eyes adjusted and I was able to make out the face of a small girl
who</B>
<P><B>appeared to be age 5 or so.  She was in a crouching position, which</B>
<P><B>explained the low position on the floor. The two of us were locked
there,</B>
<P><B>and those eyes were so evil, it gave me the feeling it did not like
me</B>
<P><B>there.  Slowly, remaining in her crouched position she made her way
to the</B>
<P><B>closet that connected with my friend's mom's room.  With her back to
me she</B>
<P><B>glanced back at me with those glowing, red eyes, then dissapated into
the</B>
<P><B>darkness of the closet.  Not an article of clothing moved.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I've forgotten many things, but I do remember aftewards I went into
the</B>
<P><B>kitchen and asked my friend's mom where the little sister (5 year old)
was.</B>
<P><B> Of course she was playing in the backyard where she had been all the
time.</B>
<P><B> I was looking for some rational explanation, but could not find one.
 I</B>
<P><B>only know what I saw.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Today I am a mother of teenagers, just an average person who isn't
really</B>
<P><B>a big believer or disbeliever in ghosts. I can't say that I've had
any more</B>
<P><B>hauntings as sensational as this one was for me, though I have had
smaller</B>
<P><B>ones, not worth mentioning. </B>
<P>
<P><B>I would be interested in reading story from  someone who had an
experience</B>
<P><B>of seeing something like this with red, glowing eyes. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Thank you for listening to my story.  Hope it wasn't too long!</B>

<P><B> 'Granny'</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:  goodnomore@yahoo.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I've submitted several stories to your site so far,</B>
<P><B>and as promised... here's yet another one for your</B>
<P><B>consideration. (And if you ever get tired of hearing</B>
<P><B>about our personal encounters, please just let me</B>
<P><B>know....  frankly, it's refreshing to have finally</B>
<P><B>found a place that I can share our experiences with</B>
<P><B>believers.) This story is very long... please feel</B>
<P><B>free to edit or split it if necessary. </B>
<P><B> This particular encounter happened over a period of 2</B>
<P><B>years... but was never witnessed personally by me. The</B>
<P><B>reason for that will become apparent as I tell you</B>
<P><B>what happened, and WHY it happened. These events</B>
<P><B>occurred in an old 1-1/2 story farmhouse on McCreery</B>
<P><B>Rd, outside Gaston, Indiana. (And for those of you who</B>
<P><B>pore over these stories as much as I do, this is the</B>
<P><B>same site as the 'Earth Spirit' sighting.) This</B>
<P><B>particular house was unique in the fact that it was</B>
<P><B>over 100 years old, but had never been lived in by an</B>
<P><B>'outsider'... members of the same family had always</B>
<P><B>inhabited this house. Until our friend John managed to</B>
<P><B>talk the current owner into letting him move in just</B>
<P><B>to 'fix it up', in exchange for free rent. The house</B>
<P><B>was a typical old farmhouse. Sagging floors, creaky</B>
<P><B>ceilings, and very old plumbing. It had been empty for</B>
<P><B>several years prior to John's moving in - for some</B>
<P><B>reason, no family members wanted to live there</B>
<P><B>anymore. </B>
<P><B> My husband and I were both very avid amateur</B>
<P><B>re-modelers, while John was licensed for electrical</B>
<P><B>work and was a quite proficient carpenter. We</B>
<P><B>volunteered to help him, simply for something to do on</B>
<P><B>the evenings and weekends. Slowly but surely, we began</B>
<P><B>to get that old home looking happy again. </B>
<P><B> From the first time I entered that home, I knew that</B>
<P><B>we were not alone there. There was a very cold spot in</B>
<P><B>John's bedroom, against the staircase wall. (There was</B>
<P><B>a closet built-in under the stairwell... typical</B>
<P><B>construction.) I could sense someone/thing watching</B>
<P><B>us, but never got any 'bad' feelings about it. Just a</B>
<P><B>sense of being watched. </B>
<P><B> While the two men did the heavy remodeling, it was</B>
<P><B>left up to me to decide on color schemes and wallpaper</B>
<P><B>designs. I spent hours poring over wallpaper and paint</B>
<P><B>samples... just couldn't ever seem to find the one</B>
<P><B>that felt right for that home. I was getting</B>
<P><B>frustrated - we had redone several homes, and I had</B>
<P><B>never encountered the indecision I did with this</B>
<P><B>home... I somehow just knew that I would find the</B>
<P><B>'right' scheme. Late one evening, we had gone to help</B>
<P><B>John install some brace beams on an interior wall. He</B>
<P><B>was in the process of installing an opening between</B>
<P><B>the living room and small room, to begin the process</B>
<P><B>of getting the wet bar in working order. </B>
<P><B> While the men were busy grunting and slaving over the</B>
<P><B>measuring and cutting, I glanced down at the wallpaper</B>
<P><B>book I had brought along and one page seemed to stick</B>
<P><B>out further than the rest. Of course it caught my eye,</B>
<P><B>so I opened the book... and there was the perfect</B>
<P><B>wallpaper sample. A light creme color, with a very</B>
<P><B>faint floral design on it. I called John over to look</B>
<P><B>at it, and when he saw it, he wrinkled up his nose.</B>
<P><B>"Looks like sissy stuff to me, but you're in charge." </B>
<P><B>I went the very next day and purchased all I would</B>
<P><B>need to do every room that was to be papered. </B>
<P><B> That weekend, I was in the home alone, hanging the</B>
<P><B>wallpaper. Single rolls, not pre-pasted. Anyone thats</B>
<P><B>ever hung wallpaper knows what a pain in the butt it</B>
<P><B>can be. I was anticipating a very slow process, and</B>
<P><B>had mentally prepared myself for the worst. I started</B>
<P><B>in the kitchen - all the cabinets had been pulled down</B>
<P><B>and were in the process of being refinished. The room</B>
<P><B>was virtually empty, so I thought 'get the easy stuff</B>
<P><B>out of the way first'... and easy it was. It seemed as</B>
<P><B>though I had an extra set of hands helping me. I would</B>
<P><B>cut the length, lay it out to roll the paste onto the</B>
<P><B>back of it, and then climb back onto the stepladder to</B>
<P><B>begin the painstaking process of getting it lined</B>
<P><B>up... only it was as if the wallpaper installed</B>
<P><B>itself. No air pockets, no crooked strips... very</B>
<P><B>painless job. And the whole time I was working, I felt</B>
<P><B>this very peaceful air around me. Definitely not the</B>
<P><B>stressful situation I had pictured it to be!</B>
<P><B> Within two days, I had all the paper hung, and</B>
<P><B>painting finished. The house was beginning to look</B>
<P><B>like a home again. And the house itself felt</B>
<P><B>different... happy, somehow. While I was hanging paper</B>
<P><B>and painting, I would catch glimpses of a 'shadow' out</B>
<P><B>of my direct line of sight. I knew it meant me no</B>
<P><B>harm, so I just continued with the task at hand. But</B>
<P><B>the more I got done, the more the shadow moved... it</B>
<P><B>was almost as if it was excited that the home was</B>
<P><B>being restored into something to be proud of again. </B>
<P><B> Fast forward again:  Middle winter in Indiana. Brutal</B>
<P><B>weather, very deep cold. John was still unemployed,</B>
<P><B>and while my husband and I helped him as much as</B>
<P><B>possible, we were also beginning to try to put a</B>
<P><B>little distance between the three of us. </B>
<P><B> John's personality began to take on a very mean</B>
<P><B>streak... he told me one night (while he was ripped on</B>
<P><B>Jack Daniels) that the house was 'being mean' to him.</B>
<P><B>I pressed him for specifics, and he told me that over</B>
<P><B>the period of the last two months, a cabinet door in</B>
<P><B>the kitchen had slammed shut on his hand, he had found</B>
<P><B>himself locked out of the house twice after going</B>
<P><B>outside to get wood for his stove, and his Akita</B>
<P><B>refused to go into any room except the kitchen. After</B>
<P><B>a few more questions and answers, he finally leaned</B>
<P><B>forward, looked me dead in the eye, and said, "you</B>
<P><B>aren't gonna believe this, but there's an old woman in</B>
<P><B>that house. I've seen her standing in front of the</B>
<P><B>woodstove glaring at me three times now." Of course I</B>
<P><B>believed him. I couldn't understand WHY she was</B>
<P><B>pulling these stunts on him... until I asked him a</B>
<P><B>couple more questions. It seems that John had run out</B>
<P><B>of wood for his stove (only source of heat) so instead</B>
<P><B>of going out and cutting more, he went into the pole</B>
<P><B>barn behind the house and started pulling down the</B>
<P><B>interior walls to use as firewood. Simply put, that</B>
<P><B>made her mad, so she was simply expressing her</B>
<P><B>displeasure with him.</B>
<P><B> John then told me that he was about to leave the</B>
<P><B>state. He had had a job offer in Florida (this was</B>
<P><B>right after the storm in '93) and he was leaving</B>
<P><B>within the week. </B>
<P><B> As soon as my husband got home from work, I told him</B>
<P><B>what John had said. We both said the same thing at the</B>
<P><B>same time... let's buy the house! We had fallen in</B>
<P><B>love with that place, and it just felt like home. That</B>
<P><B>very next day, we called the owner of the home, and</B>
<P><B>asked if he'd consider selling the home with a lease</B>
<P><B>on the actual property it sat on, which is a very</B>
<P><B>common occurrence in Indiana. He never even thought</B>
<P><B>about it - his answer was an immediate YES!  We began</B>
<P><B>moving in that next weekend... the paperwork was being</B>
<P><B>drawn up for the contract, and we couldn't wait to get</B>
<P><B>into that home. </B>
<P><B> Our kids were put into the two upstairs bedrooms, and</B>
<P><B>we took over the one bedroom downstairs - the one with</B>
<P><B>the constant cold spot in it. I usually always kept</B>
<P><B>our bedroom arranged in a specific layout - no matter</B>
<P><B>where we lived. But this home was different. It was as</B>
<P><B>if I was being told where the bed should go, which</B>
<P><B>wall the dresser should be located... and it was the</B>
<P><B>same in the living room. Certain pieces of furniture</B>
<P><B>just seemed to locate themselves. Definitely not how I</B>
<P><B>would have arranged them, but it just felt right once</B>
<P><B>we were moved in. </B>
<P><B> Within a week, I had everything unpacked, and never</B>
<P><B>once had I even seen the shadow that had helped me</B>
<P><B>hang wallpaper. It just seemed to be a normal old</B>
<P><B>home. The owner of the home called me during the week</B>
<P><B>to tell me that he had the papers ready for our</B>
<P><B>signature, and if it was okay, he'd bring them out on</B>
<P><B>the weekend... he said he was curious to see the old</B>
<P><B>house again. Apparently he hadn't been in it since his</B>
<P><B>grandmother died there. We agreed on a time, and ended</B>
<P><B>the conversation. </B>
<P><B> Weekend arrives, and so does the owner. He walked</B>
<P><B>thru the back door (in the kitchen) and just stopped</B>
<P><B>dead in his tracks. His mouth literally dropped open,</B>
<P><B>and he just stood there, looking into both my bedroom</B>
<P><B>and the living room. I asked him if something was</B>
<P><B>wrong, and it took him another couple of minutes to</B>
<P><B>answer me. When he did, it was in the form of a</B>
<P><B>question: "How did you possibly restore that</B>
<P><B>wallpaper? I can't believe it!" Yep... you guessed it.</B>
<P><B>Almost identical wallpaper to the kind his grandmother</B>
<P><B>had when she had lived there. Same color paint, and</B>
<P><B>even the lace curtains I had hung over the windows</B>
<P><B>resembled the ones she had. He was in shock, and I was</B>
<P><B>feeling quite proud of myself. </B>
<P><B> Papers were signed after I gave him a tour... and he</B>
<P><B>just kept telling me it was the eeriest thing he had</B>
<P><B>ever seen - even the furniture was in the same place</B>
<P><B>as his grandmother had hers. (My bed was in the</B>
<P><B>identical place hers was - against the staircase wall,</B>
<P><B>and she died in bed.)</B>
<P><B> Fast forward again: Several months later, I had a</B>
<P><B>friend staying with me. My husband was working out of</B>
<P><B>town during the week, and Rachel needed some emotional</B>
<P><B>support... so I offered to let her come stay with us</B>
<P><B>for awhile. Because of the emotional problems she was</B>
<P><B>having, she was often up in the middle of the night.</B>
<P><B>She'd go thru my bedroom to use the restroom, then</B>
<P><B>into the kitchen for a drink. It became an almost</B>
<P><B>nightly occurrence for her to walk around, and I</B>
<P><B>learned to just ignore it. But every night, she'd run</B>
<P><B>into something in the dark. After about a week of</B>
<P><B>this, she finally had had enough. She ran into the</B>
<P><B>corner of my roll-top desk, and it hit her at</B>
<P><B>hip-level. She turned loose with a string of words</B>
<P><B>that would have embarrassed the devil himself, and in</B>
<P><B>particular, said something about 'hating this d**med</B>
<P><B>old house!' As soon as she said that, the cold spot at</B>
<P><B>my head turned icy...  I just laid there, wondering</B>
<P><B>how the old women would choose to punish Rachel for</B>
<P><B>her words. Didn't have long to wait, because as soon</B>
<P><B>as Rachel returned to the living room, she began</B>
<P><B>screaming her fool head off. Seems the old woman was</B>
<P><B>standing between her and the couch, and had a vicious</B>
<P><B>glare on her face... directed straight at Rachel. To</B>
<P><B>be honest, I started snickering... whispered "way to</B>
<P><B>go, Granny", and just rolled over and pulled the</B>
<P><B>covers over my head, still chuckling. Rachel packed up</B>
<P><B>and left the very next morning. *laff*</B>
<P><B> Fast forward again: (and this is the last time,</B>
<P><B>promise!) Several months later, and my husband and I</B>
<P><B>were having a very difficult time in our marriage.</B>
<P><B>Okay, truth. He was having an affair, I caught him,</B>
<P><B>and he was trying to lie his way out of it. I went to</B>
<P><B>bed angry, and as I laid there trying to calm down, I</B>
<P><B>began talking to 'granny'. Told her that I wished I</B>
<P><B>had lived in her day, when men didn't do things like</B>
<P><B>that. Just said some very emotional things under my</B>
<P><B>breath. As I talked, the cold spot began warming up,</B>
<P><B>until I was completely wrapped in this feeling of</B>
<P><B>warmth and peace. I drifted off to sleep, anger-free. </B>
<P>
<P><B> When I woke the next morning, I found my husband</B>
<P><B>sitting on the couch, staring across the room. It was</B>
<P><B>obvious he hadn't slept all night, but I didn't feel</B>
<P><B>sorry for him. I was actually pleased that he was</B>
<P><B>apparently feeling some kind of remorse for his</B>
<P><B>actions. At last that's what I thought it was, until</B>
<P><B>he started talking to me. He informed me that right</B>
<P><B>after I went to bed, he saw a shadow begin forming on</B>
<P><B>the wall across from him. As he watched, the shadow</B>
<P><B>took on a definite shape... of an old woman. He said</B>
<P><B>he kept rubbing his eyes, thinking it to just be a</B>
<P><B>hallucination, and had almost managed to convince</B>
<P><B>himself of that, until she started walking across the</B>
<P><B>room towards him. He said that it was if he was frozen</B>
<P><B>in place. He opened his mouth to call out to me, but</B>
<P><B>no sound would come out. He tried to jump off the</B>
<P><B>couch to run into our bedroom, but he couldn't move.</B>
<P><B>All he could do was just lay there and watch as</B>
<P><B>'granny' got closer and closer. He said when she got</B>
<P><B>next to him, he could actually smell a scent of</B>
<P><B>vanilla (women dabbed vanilla behind their ears as</B>
<P><B>perfume in her day) and that he could see her plainly.</B>
<P><B>No mist, no fog. She appeared completely real and</B>
<P><B>human to him. He said she was glaring at him...</B>
<P><B>obviously very angry. </B>
<P><B> What he told me next had me laughing... she</B>
<P><B>apparently beat him up. He said she pinched his cheeks</B>
<P><B>very hard, slapped him several times, and then grabbed</B>
<P><B>hold of his earlobe and put her face against his...</B>
<P><B>and whispered something in his ear. He refused to tell</B>
<P><B>me what she had said, but whatever it was made a</B>
<P><B>believer of him. Sorry, but I had no pity for him. I</B>
<P><B>was laughing so hard I had tears pouring from my eyes.</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B> He obviously wasn't quite as amused as I was, and</B>
<P><B>informed me we were moving out of that 'demon house'</B>
<P><B>right away! Uhmm... wrong thing to say. I felt the</B>
<P><B>cold spot come thru the wall right behind me... it</B>
<P><B>wrapped itself around my face for just a moment, then</B>
<P><B>it moved. Straight to him, apparently. He got a look</B>
<P><B>of sheer terror on his face, and just sat there,</B>
<P><B>frozen in place for at least 5 minutes. He broke out</B>
<P><B>into a cold sweat (pardon the pun), and just stared at</B>
<P><B>me, as tho begging me to help him. I figured he</B>
<P><B>deserved whatever she was doing to him, so I just</B>
<P><B>walked into the kitchen to start coffee. </B>
<P><B> No... we didn't move. Not then, anyway. We lived in</B>
<P><B>the house another 1-1/2 years with no more sightings.</B>
<P><B>He was a good boy and behaved himself at all times. At</B>
<P><B>least while he was in our home he did. I guess he was</B>
<P><B>afraid granny would make herself known again?</B>
<P><B> We ended up divorcing, and the day I left that house,</B>
<P><B>my kids and I sat on the floor where my bed had been,</B>
<P><B>and talked to 'granny'. We explained to her that we</B>
<P><B>loved her, and would miss her, but we had to go now.</B>
<P><B>She already knew, tho. As we walked out of that back</B>
<P><B>door for the last time, it was as if that house</B>
<P><B>sighed. A sad, mournful sigh... it, and she, were </B>
<P><B>alone again.</B>
<P><B> One last footnote: About 3 months after 'granny' got</B>
<P><B>hold of my husband, we went to the old owner's house</B>
<P><B>to pay off our home. As you walk in his front door,</B>
<P><B>his entryway was covered with old family pictures. As</B>
<P><B>we stood there wiping our feet, my husband began</B>
<P><B>staring at one of the pictures. He pointed straight to</B>
<P><B>a woman, and said "That's her!" We finished our</B>
<P><B>business, and on our way out the door, I asked who the</B>
<P><B>woman was. The answer? His grandmother. The same one</B>
<P><B>who lived and died in our home. </B>

<P><B>Haunted Dreams</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: ANGIE1613@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I am 21, and ever since I can remember I have had lucid dreams.  The
weird</B>
<P><B>thing about the dreams is that thepeople are usually unfamilar and
always</B>
<P><B>try to convince me I am not dreaming.  The most of vivid of these
dreams</B>
<P><B>happened in the summer of 1996 when I went with my family to
Washington,</B>
<P><B>D.C. We stayed with my step-dad's sister's family in an old turn of
the</B>
<P><B>century house in Alexandria.  I slept in the oldest daughter's room
which</B>
<P><B>was downstairs.  I dreamt of a party going on in the house, and I was</B>
<P><B>dancing with blond young man. He was a stranger to me.  All of a sudden
I</B>
<P><B>realized I was dreaming and told him so.  He tried so hard to convince
i</B>
<P><B>was not dreaming that I ran from him back into the room where I was</B>
<P><B>actually sleeping.  It was as if he really didn't want me to wake up.
 All</B>
<P><B>the people I encounter in these dreams try to convinve I am not
dreaming.</B>
<P><B>Anyway, I woke up feeling very uneasy and had to make my come come
sleep</B>
<P><B>with me.  If anyone has any input on these!</B>
<P><B> dreams or the supernatural trying to contact people through lucid</B>
<P><B>dreaming i would really like to hear it.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Also I live in a fairly new house with my best friend right now in</B>
<P><B>Valdosta, GA.  We have had very strange things happen since we moved
into</B>
<P><B>the house a year ago. WE always here noises and bumps.  Sometimes we
find</B>
<P><B>the water on after we are sure we turned we off.  Needless to say my
cat is</B>
<P><B>always staring at and batting at invisible things.  The wierdest
thaat</B>
<P><B>happened involving the cat was i was sittin gon the couch painting
my</B>
<P><B>toenails when the cat come and sat right in front of me. She stared</B>
<P><B>intently around my head moving her head as if she was watching
something.</B>
<P><B>She began to meow really wired and then ran off.  It scared me so much
I</B>
<P><B>left the house right then.  Also it always saound liek the TV is one
after</B>
<P><B>we go to bed, like muffled voices, whenit isn't.  the source of the</B>
<P><B>soundsand feelings seems to be the bedroon my friend moved out of.
 She</B>
<P><B>swears she felt uneasy and watched until she moved into the spare room.
I</B>
<P><B>don't know if this had anything to do with the dreams,!</B>
<P><B> but we are moving soon and I will let you know if "it" follows us.

<P><B>Haunted House</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:  lashmore@bellsouth.net</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I'm a on the verge young haunted house reseacher and I've seen my
fare</B>
<P><B>share of ghosts. I saw my grandfather the night he died 2 or 3 hours</B>
<P><B>later. He was walking down my hallway and my grannie was sitting in
my</B>
<P><B>mothers chair which is now in my room and i get freaked out to have
it in</B>
<P><B> my room because it rocked one night. Everytime I go past there house
he looks out and waves to me but</B>
<P><B>black people live in that house now and the've seen him and my grannie
too. Another ghosts</B>
<P><B>I've never seen but felt. I go to my grandmas house ( the only grandparent
I have left) and every</B>
<P><B>time I go in the shower and thats where it begins to get freezing cold
in really warm</B>
<P><B>water and I never stay in there but for 3 minutes. It has to be an
</B>
<P><B>indian because the town was named after the muncie indians which
lived</B>
<P><B>near my grandmas creek. Because we find arrowheads and stuff. In my</B>
<P><B>towns history we have a house called the Ezeikel Harris house today</B>
<P><B>because it has been owned by 4 generations of Harris'</B>
<P><B>but long ago it was called the Mackey Trading house. The story goes
back</B>
<P><B>to one of the kings captains who was tarred and feathered in Augusta
in the</B>
<P><B>middle 1700s and they paraded him through town to be shamed and
laughed</B>
<P><B>at. He returned to Augusta during the Revolutionary War to complete
his revenge. He captured 13</B>
<P><B>patriots of Augusta and he held a hanging in that house and 2 of the
younger ones</B>
<P><B>mother cried and tried to stop him but he wouldn't and they shot and</B>
<P><B>killed her to shut her up. He layed in a room so he can see them hanged
perfectly. He was killed later</B>
<P><B>in the war( he payed for his sins) but to this day if you go up three
steps and count</B>
<P><B>back from 10 you'll feel a nuse wrap around your neck. Also the room
where the man</B>
<P><B>watched from has the light turn on and off during the night and they
don't know how.</B>
<P><B>Also if you go by at night you can hear that mother still crying and
begging him to</B>
<P><B>stop the hanging of her boys. </B>
