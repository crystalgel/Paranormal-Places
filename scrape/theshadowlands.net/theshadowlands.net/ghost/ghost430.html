<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Desert Angel</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: Keith.Woyach@generalmitchell.af.mil</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I was a Sergeant in the Air Force temporarily stationed in
the <st1:place w:st="on">Middle East</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My first week there I was getting the 1st
class tour of the base and let me tell you it was huge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One part called Viper Area where they kept
most of the munitions and missiles was I&#8217;d say about 45 minutes to drive around
and was almost all desert accept a small road that went around the
perimeter.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An Airmen was showing me
around the grounds when we stopped at small pile of stones stacked about 2 to 3
feet high with a ring of stones surrounding it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I also noticed a set of dog tags set on top along with a pack of
cigarettes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked about the strange
sight and was told it was a monument for female airmen who was killed in that
exact spot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently a group of troops
were messing around playing water tag in Hummers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The young<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>airmen was racing in her vehicle and hit a ditch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Hummer flipped over and landed on top of
her crushing and killing her instantly. After her funeral, her fellow troops
built that monument and placed everything she had in her pockets on it.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ever since, troops have clamed to have seen
her ghost patrolling in that area every now and then making sure everyone was
driving safe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now I being the skeptic
didn&#8217;t believe much in ghost stories but it kind of freaked me out a
little.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One very dark night I was in
charge of a squad in the Viper area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
and another Sergeant were driving around checking on sensors when young female
airmen named Nichole at the command post radioed stating that she had just
picked up a vehicle on the inferred camera resembling a Hummer driving near
sensor 312.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were checking sensor 522
at the time so we really had to punch it to get over there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we arrived on scene, we found nothing,
not even a vehicle track in the sand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
informed Nichole that we found nothing and to double check the area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She came back very excited stating she saw
the same Hummer now near sensor 102.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
began to doubt Nichole&#8217;s senses because it would take at least 20 minutes to
get from 522 to 102.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We jumped in and
raced over to 102 and once again found nothing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No tracks, no vehicles&#8230;nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
started getting upset because I thought Nichole was messing with us and was
about to tell her so when she came back on the radio claiming to have seen that
same Hummer now near sensor 425.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now I
was very angry because not only was it impossible to drive that far in that
short of time but now we would have to drive all the way across the area to
investigate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I radioed back practically
yelling that she better stop screwing around and that her jokes weren&#8217;t funny,
but she called back almost in tears that she wasn&#8217;t kidding and everything she
told me was true!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hearing the sincerity
in her voice I really hit the gas wanting to find out what was going on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I must have been doing close to 50 when my
head lights picked up a female airmen on the side of the dirt road waving her
arms up and down in a slow down motion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I hit the brakes to go find out who that was and that&#8217;s when I noticed
the 3 foot wash out in the road up ahead. At the speed we were moving, we would
have been killed if we hit that wash out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My partner and I went back to investigate and thank our guardian angel,
only to find there was no one in sight.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I even used my thermo imager which would pick up any kind of moving heat
in the area and still nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
then, I started to think back to the story of the young female airman who died
in the Hummer crash and chills began to run down my spine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Could this really be her ghost and she&#8217;s out
here on permanent patrol duties kind of watching out for us?<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I gave my partner a look of disbelief and he
shouted back at me saying &#8220;Don&#8217;t even think about telling this to nobody
because they&#8217;d throw us in the Looney bin.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We walked back to the Hummer just in time to hear Nichole radio back
saying you guys aren&#8217;t going to believe this but that Hummers back at sensor
329.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With a sigh, I grabbed the radio
and just said one word, &#8220;Disregard.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My Story In Shuyler Falls NY</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: bates.kristin@gmail.com</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My name is Kristin. I'm 22 years old, and when I was growing
up (ages from about 4 - 7 or 8, I'd say) we lived in a green house in <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Schuyler</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Falls</st1:PlaceName>,
NY which is right outside of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Plattsburgh</st1:place></st1:City>.
That area has a couple of old cemetaries in the woods and my stepfather owned
about an acre of land, with the main house and the shed on it, plus plenty of
room. At the time, I lived there with my brother who is two years younger than
me, my mother and my stepfather. I was thinking about that house today and
tried to research it, to see if I could find anyone else who'd had experiences
there. I know I'm not the only one, because that house is somewhat legendary in
the small town. I was talking with an old friend from school and he was shocked
that I'd lived there, because he'd been in that house (after we moved out of
it, it became one of those local hanging out places, where kids went and
partied and vandalized) and it had scared him to death. Which is saying something,
because he's the type of hot-shot guy that is afraid of nothing.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Anyway, I'm writing to tell you my story in hopes of finding
someone else who knows something about the house. What happened there, and if
anyone else has had similar experiences. I've been thinking about it since I
was a little girl, and have wanted to return but it's presently occupied.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Several things happened while I lived in the house, here is
what I know:</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>1. My mother found, in the basement, a very small ring. It
was wedged between two of the bricks, so it was actually in the wall. She took
it out to keep it; it was a simple, pretty band, but too small for her to wear
on her hand. This is when, by her estimation, things in the house started to
get worse.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>2. We were excavating a large part of the backyard - it was
too hilly and my parents wanted to build a deck, maybe put in a pool. So as
they were digging, they found a tombstone. It was broken in half, and digging
stopped pretty much immediately after that, as they didn't know how to proceed.
They certainly didn't want to dig up any bodies or anything like that!</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>3. At the time, I was having a lot of dreams and I spent a
lot of time alone. The only real vivid memories I have are from walking in the
woods behind the house. I spent a lot of time in the graveyard there - it was
all little children's graves, for some reason, and I guess I just felt a
connection to them and to the cemetery. In some respects, I was the only person
not 'targeted' by the things that happened in the house. My mother was
tormented by giant rats, my brother's bedroom became covered in insects. I
don't know whether or not my stepfather was bothered by the things that
happened, because he had a heart attack and died in bed one night.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>4. There would be sounds moving when no one was there, TV
and lights coming off and on. My brother's bedroom was covered with ladybugs
one day - no other place in the house, only his bedroom. My mother got rid of
the bugs, re-caulked the windows, and it wasn't a week later when flies infested
the room again.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>5. My grandmother was visiting one weekend and two things
happened when she was there - first, she was in my bedroom cleaning and poking
around, and she swears to God that one of my dolls moved on its own and lifted
up out of its bed to stare at her. Then, she was talking with my mother in the
kitchen (I was eavesdropping from the stairway, because I was a nosy child),
and a light that was over her head - one of those tube-shaped fluorescent bulbs
- swung down behind her (as if one side of the brackets came undone) until it
was perpendicular to the ceiling, and then shattered. The bulb part was facing
away from her, so she wasn't injured by the flying glass, but it was still
quite a shock.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>6. My uncle came to fix some roofing for us. My family left
to do some shopping, and he was fine with working on his own. He had a twelve
pack and a hammer, it was all good, you know? We came back to find him sitting
outside, visibly shaken and almost ghost white. He said he was never going back
in that house and left. He never said what happened to him in there. After this
happened, my brother and I were afraid (and so was my mother, I suspect) so my
mother called the family priest to come see the house, help us say prayers,
things like that. I don't remember what happened, exactly, but my mother tells
the story like this: in no uncertain terms, the priest told my mother to leave
the house, sell it, get out now.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>7. Finally, one night, it all became too much for my mother.
She was fixing a late night snack of toast, and when she turned around to get
it, there were two giant rats on the countertop, staring at her. She said they
had evil eyes; no matter how much she screamed, they did not leave. She is
deathly afraid of rats, so this was finally the last straw. She packed us kids
up and left - we stayed with our grandmother until we found a new place. Not
long after we left the house, my uncle died in a car crash, so we never found
out what he saw in there.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>That's it, that's my story. I'm really curious about that
house. No one in my family believed in ghosts before that house.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Sam</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Hello, I've written in before, about Jasper and other
spirits, well there is a latest edition.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>On sunday the 18th of November, the family car died, his
name was Sam.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Sam was 14 years old, and much loved, and now missed.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>anyways back to the story &gt;.&lt;</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The day after he died, my mum heard Sam 'Slurping' or
grooming, then a sneeze, which he did ALOT as he had a cold before he died.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The day after I heard a meow, and rustling of paper, on a
stool which he sat on alot.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>But things got weirder, whenever I talk to my boyfriend Kyle
[who is 18, so I cannot tell my parents about him] the spare room goes cold and
I hear rustling, also I have started hearing footsteps in the attic and doors
slamming, there are no doors in the attic, so I don't know where the sounds
come from.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Also I have found that one of your 'ghosts in the news'
stories is connected to my family, It's the story about the hauntings on a navy
ship[i think]<span style="">&nbsp; </span>with the two faces or
three showing up, one of them has the second name 'Meehan' Which spookily is my
second name, I have also found that he is on my dads side of the family, and of
Irish blood, ever since I found that out, I have felt like somethings watching
over me, protecting me.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Several Different Stories</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: MFetscher@goebelrealty.com</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I met my now husband in August of 2000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I moved in with him in February of 2001.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would occasionally stay he night with him
before I moved in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had a roommate at
that time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We would have strange little
things happen, lights flicking on and off, doors slamming when everyone is in
bed and the front door is locked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
night my husband and I went to bed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nothing unusual had happened that night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We both woke up about the same time somewhere between 2-4 am.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a dream that we heard the front door
slam. In my dream my husband and I got up to go &#8220;investigate&#8221; and found
nothing, we were walking back to the bedroom and I happened to turn around in
the doorway of the bedroom and behind him stood and old woman with frazzled
gray/white hair in a white nightgown holding a butcher knife above my husbands
head getting ready to strike and that is when I woke up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband woke up just a few minutes after I
did and said he had a nightmare about a crazy old lady in white who was trying
to kill him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Scared the crap out of
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Also, out by where we used to live is an old church that
people turned into a house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I first
started dating my now husband he was telling me about this house and that it
was used for satanic worship etc., I of course didn&#8217;t believe him, he took me
out to this house, I rolled down the window of the truck and first of all this
(corny) black cat appeared out of nowhere and meowed so loud, then you could
hear chanting coming from inside the house, needless to say we high tailed it
out of there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>We used to go for hikes in the woods in the same area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On occasion we would find an odd bone here
and there, we just chalked it up to animal bones but now as watching all these
crime shows I am not so sure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had
been on several occasions to the same spots.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We went on a hike one day and came upon an old cemetery from 1889, there
were fresh flowers on the grave and it was completely fenced in with no gate,
someone would have had to hop the fence in order to place the flowers where
they were&#8230; I was totally creeped out.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Recently my mother in law passed away (April 2007)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We brought home some things from her house
before it was sold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We brought home this
toy slot machine, (she loved to gamble) it worked the first couple of times the
kids played with it after that the lights just stayed on, they are still on and
it is November 2007.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rose we took
from her funeral has not fallen apart or turned black, it simply dried up. His
mother was a very religious woman, who had total faith in God.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She very much believed in angels and was a
dear and wonderful woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I feel her
presence and my husband and oldest son have dreams about her almost on a daily
basis. I have asked her for signs of her presence and on occasion do receive
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The day after she died I had to go
to her house to pick up some things and was there alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was never afraid of her, but as I was
leaving her bedroom where she passed I knew she was there watching me go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the days before her death, she would be
staring off into the corner of the room and one day she made a very odd
comment, &#8220; I didn&#8217;t know they wore uniforms&#8221;.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I assume she was speaking of angels as silly as it sounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like I said she was very religious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So much so that when the Nun came to give her
the last rites, she said &#8220;I am not afraid&#8221; and didn&#8217;t speak another word before
she died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did however, wait until
all of her children were there with her before she finally let go. She wanted
all of them around her and to be in her own home. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When my middle child was born, she couldn&#8217;t sleep in her
crib, (in the same house as the crazy old lady) not fifteen minutes after I
laid her down she would be screaming. I think the crazy old lady woke her
up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband and I moved out bed to
the smaller room when my daughter was born and moved the kids into the big
bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn&#8217;t sleep if the closet
door was open I felt like someone was staring at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since we bought our new house we haven&#8217;t seen
her.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One night while I was pregnant I
was home alone because my husband was working third shift and, I saw headlights
in the driveway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They went out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought my husband was home early and
waited for him to come in the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
a few minutes nothing, so I went and looked out the window and there was no car
there. About an hour later I heard knocking at our back door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We didn&#8217;t use the back door at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everyone that had been to our house knew
that. I was sooooo scared I thought someone was trying to get in, and at that
time I didn&#8217;t really know any of the neighbors well enough to go to their house
and was at least an hour from my mothers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I know this was long but I had to get it out.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The Baby Ghost</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: nechgan@yahoo.com</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Back in 1993, I was buying my first home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The oldest son of the woman who owned the
house was acting as executor, so he was at the closing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My first son, at the time was 2 years old and
I had left him with my mother while I went to the closing to sign off on all
the paperwork for the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all
the paperwork was signed, the man who was the seller, said to me that his
youngest sister still lived there and would be getting all of her things out in
the next few days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told me not to
mind her, that she was a little strange and that years before, she had found
her baby upstairs in that house dead in a "pool of coca-cola".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had no idea what he meant and frankly
thought that was a strange thing to say to someone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, my son and I moved in and started our life
in our new place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had forgotten all
about what that man had said to me until about a year later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a Saturday morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I always had to get up very early on the
weekday mornings for work, so on Saturday mornings, I would sleep in until my
son would come wake me to make breakfast, usually around 7 AM.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This particular Saturday morning, I woke up
on<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my own to find it was 9 AM!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was a little upset because I felt like I
was a bad mother for sleeping so late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
ran out into the hallway and said to my son, now about 3 1/2 years old,
"why didn't you wake me up? are you hungry?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He answered me "it's okay, mommy I was
just playing with the shadow of the baby".<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Needless to say, I instantly remembered what
that man had told me a year ago at the closing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My son went on to describe what the "shadow" looked like and
how tall it was and how he wasn't afraid of it at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said when I got up, it ran into his
bedroom and disappeared into his<span style="">&nbsp; </span>chest
of drawers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>So, we got over that and even totally forgot about it
because it never happened again.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the
meantime, I had gotten married and had another son when my first son was 8
years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both my first son and I still
had no thoughts of this ghost experience whatsoever and had totally forgotten
it had ever happened<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>until one Friday evening when my second son
was now about 3 years old, which puts the time line about 8 years after the
first experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My first son and my
husband were out at the store and my youngest son and I were getting ready<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for bed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was already upstairs in the bathroom and was calling my youngest son
to come brush his teeth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Remember, there
is NO way he knew anything about this ghost story because I happened way before
he was ever born and my oldest son and I had totally forgotten about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, I call him to come up and brush his
teeth and he<span style="">&nbsp; </span>comes running full blast up
the steps, past the bathroom and into my older son's bedroom laughing and
yelling "mom! mom! it's a baby! and I'm chasing him! look!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a baby mom!" I followed him into my
older son's room and my younger son was standing in front of the chest of
drawers, pointing to it and saying "the baby went in here, mommy, the baby
went in here"!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, at that point
the whole memory of what that man had told me at the closing of my house all
those years ago and what my older son had experienced all those years<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ago came rushing into my head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Could this be the ghost of the baby that had
died here in this house?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We never saw it
again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wonder if it only shows itself
to little toddlers.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Experiences in My New Home</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: canuck1787@yahoo.com</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I've written here before about my friends house and my
childhood house in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Ottawa</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Illinois</st1:State></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At 15, my family and I moved to <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Oliver</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Springs</st1:PlaceName>, <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Tennessee</st1:place></st1:State>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We bought a beautiful brick house that was built about 20 years
ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From what I know, our previous
neighbors didn't have any experiences they would consider paranormal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only thing I remember my dad telling me
that was odd was the wife of the family who previously lived here broke out in
hives one day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She tried everything to
get rid of them, but nothing would work.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I believe this went on for several months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After months of having these hives, the
husband took the wife to a local church and asked the reverend to baptize her
and say a cleansing prayer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hives
stopped after that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After we moved in my
mother began breaking out in hives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
has had hives before when we lived in our previous house, but they were
minor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hives she experiences now are
severe, sometimes the size of a grapefruit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don't know if this has anything to do with the paranormal, but it is
quite interesting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I myself, have not had too many experiences here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever experiences I have had, started
almost immediately after we moved in. One experience I do recall also included
my mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was 2002, and I had just
come home from school.To have the story make sense, I have to explain the
layout of our house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The way our house
is constructed, there are two levels.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The bottom level contains the recreation room, the laundry room/bathroom
and the door leading to the connecting garage.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We then have the foyer with two sets of steps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second set of steps leads to the top
level.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When you reach the top of the
stairs, the kitchen it straight forward, the living room/dining room is
immediately on the left and on the right is the hallway which leads to the hall
bathroom, and three bedrooms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I got
home, I walked up both sets of stairs to the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I came into the living room, about 3 feet
with my back facing the stairs and stair railing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother was on the couch facing me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we were talking, I noticed out of the
corner of my eye a dark, shadowy figure walking down the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not look like a normal person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was pitch black, but the shape of it made
it look like a tall man, around 6 feet with a long-brimmed hat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned around, and it was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned back to my mother, thinking it was
an illusion and she said, "did you see that?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was amazed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had never had an experience with someone else in the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told my mother I saw it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She described to me what she saw and it fit
exactly what I saw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My sister told me that one day while she was in the kitchen,
she looked out the window which faces our backyard and our neighbor's
backyard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said she saw a figure,
which looked like a man in a bright yellow raincoat with a yellow hat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said it disappeared as soon as she saw
it. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>As I stated before, I've never experienced anything
paranormal with another person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
mother believes in spirits and ghosts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My grandfather, my mothers father, died of lung cancer in 2004.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother was very close to her father and
was there when he died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 6 months
after he died, we began to have problems with the phone and phone jack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While we would be on the phone, the phone
would cut out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This happened quite
often.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One time, after the phone cut out
while she was talking, my mom went to check the phone jack. The phone jack for
the living room is actually in the kitchen and is on the wall, about 5 feet up
from the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she went into the
kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the cord was pulled out of the
jack and the cord was hanging on the jack from the small piece of plastic that
you push in to release the cord from the jack.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no way the cord could hang like that if it fell out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had to be put there like that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This happened several times over the next few
months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over time, it became a
joke.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We would say, "grandpa Zirkle
pull the cord out again".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About a
year after it started, it finally stopped.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I've not really had any other experiences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have had a strong sense of being
watched.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This has occurred for nearly
the entire time I've lived here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I
first moved in, my bedroom was on the lower level in the recreation room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would hear things, but I could never say it
was abnormal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would also see dark
black blobs on the ceiling which I always shrugged off as my eyes playing
tricks on me. A few instances while I was in the downstairs shower, I would
hear objects falling to the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
I would check to see, there would be a shampoo bottle, shaving cream, just random
things that fell to the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 3
months ago, I moved to one of the upstairs bedrooms which used to be my twin
sister's room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the beginning, I had
not noticed anything strange.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sister
said she used to have bags fly around the room and experience other strange
noises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've not seen anything in that
room, but I have heard some noises which were unsettling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But what is the most unsettling is the
constant feeling of being watched.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I am terrified of paranormal activity and I do not want to
experience any of these things whether they be peaceful or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If anyone has any information on this or
could tell me what it means to have the being watched feeling, feel free to
e-mail me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Ghost Story of My Dad's</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: ShaneSwafford@wmconnect.com</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I would like to tell you about a ghost sighting my dad had
when he was a little kid. He told me that one time, when he was a youngster, he
was lying in his bed at night when he noticed an old man walking across his
room and disappear behind the chiffarobe (a large, box-like closet seperate
from the wall.) As he walked by he looked at my father. He said it scared him
so much that he put his pillow over his head and slept that way the rest of the
night. Perhaps the strangest part is he learned the next day that the old man
who lived across the street from him had died the previous night. He thinks his
ghost was what he saw walking across his room. The event put such an impression
on him that he sleeps with his pillow over his head to this day, although now it
is out of habit rather than the intense fear which originally caused it.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>House I Lived In</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: marylou.washburn@cnitd.com</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I spent the first 20 years of my life in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Tishomingo</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Oklahoma</st1:State></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last house we (my parents and I) lived in
had something going on there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were
told that the property used to be an old Indian cemetery and also that the big
tree in our front yard was the &#8220;town hanging tree&#8221;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The occurrences we experienced are as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Weekly and sometimes 2 or 3
times a week,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>noise could be heard
starting in the area of where the attic entrance hole in the ceiling was
located.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This hole was located over the
east wall of our &#8220;back bedroom&#8221;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then it
sounded like someone walking or shuffling their feet and the noise would always
come to where ever my Mother was in the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It sounded like the &#8220;person&#8221; or &#8220;apparition&#8221; was wearing either
moccasins or house shoes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our house
faced West.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As you entered the front
door, the living room was on the right (or South side), our bedroom to the left
(or North side).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a short hall
going thru the living room back to the back bedroom which was located in the
Southeast part of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our kitchen
was in the Northeast part of the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We had a small screened-in back porch attached to the east side of the
kitchen and our bathroom was attached to the east side of the back
bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes in the hot weather my
Mother (my Father died when I was 13) would move her bed into the living room
because there were more windows to open and it was cooler in there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had no air conditioning back then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But regardless whether my Mother slept in the
living room, bedroom or occasionally on the screened-in back porch, this &#8220;shuffling&#8221;
sound always went to where she was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
always happened at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes
early evening and sometimes in the middle of the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our house was old and drafty so during the
cold months she would close the bedroom doors going into the hall to keep the
heat from our open heater more into the bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this door happened to be closed, we could
hear the shuffling and then the door would swing open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our dog would first start pricking his hears
up when he&#8217;d hear the noise start and when the door would swing open by itself,
he&#8217;d jump up, bark and look very confused because there would be nothing
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had many overnight visitors
and most of them heard these episodes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Several of our relatives were scared to spend the night with us after
hearing all of this or by what other relatives told them they heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>We sold this house in the middle 1960&#8217;s.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have no clue if the buyers experienced any
of this or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were afraid to tell
them before we sold it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We figured we
wouldn&#8217;t be able to get rid of it if we did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This &#8220;thing&#8221; never hurt anyone and we could never see anything but we
definitely heard plenty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some folks
tried to tell us it was my Dad trying to get a message to my Mother but that
isn&#8217;t true since a lot of this happened before he passed away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house has since been demolished, the tree
cut down and the hill they both were on has been leveled down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>In 1998 or 1999 I lived in the upperstairs apartment of this
house. I lived by myself in this 2-bedroom apt. There were many nights where I
was up late at night watching TV in the living room and I felt like someone was
watching me. I've only experienced that in one other house that I've lived in.
After about 2 months of living there I was sleeping in the bedroom just off the
living room when something woke me. I had not been drinking, or doing any
drugs, or anything. My bedroom door was wide open and I knew something was
there, but I couldn't see anything. I was lying in the direction where I was
facing the door. The only light in the room was an alarm clock which was also
facing toward me. The next thing I know a transparent image came toward me and
a face appeared in front of me within a foot or two and disappeared within a
few seconds. It scared me but I actually went back to sleep. The next day I
told a few people at work and a couple friends and family. The more people I
told the more I felt crazy for telling people. So I stopped telling people. I
lived there for about a year and never saw anything else. I ended up moving
into the downstairs apartment and lived there for about 2 years and never had
any problems.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I know the person who moved into the apartment right after I
moved out. I never told him about my experience. He lived there for about a
month, when one day he stopped by to talk and said that the place was a little
strange. I just said "yep" or something like that, but still didn't
tell him. About two weeks later he stopped by again and told me that he saw
something the night before and explained it to me the exact same way that it
happened to me. The only difference was that he was sleeping in the living
room.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I don't know the history of the house or anything, but I am
interested to find out if anyone died there. I'm not sure how to find that out
though.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>After several witnesses reported strange happenings our
group, Alabama Haunted ,was asked to come and investigate.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span>One witness was local
plumber who was working on some of the pipes in the basement. He chatted with a
man that was standing close by till that man disappeared as he talked to
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another witness was a lady who was
attending a wedding at the hall. She was in the powder room and turned to see
another lady in the mirror watching her. Thinking she was in there alone she
looked around and saw no one else in the small room. And one of the waitress
had a heavy door to opened and then close for her as she carried trays out to
the dining room. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Shadows have been seen moving in one of the corridors in the
day time by others. And someone speaking with a heavy German accent can be
heard sometimes.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Upon investigating we had several personal experiences
including equipment being turned off constantly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Heavy footsteps on wooden ramps, and no one
there. We could account for all members of the team at that time and no one was
in the immediate area. One of the EMF meters was laying on a wooden table as we
were setting up a camcorder and it started registering something near it. After
checking the area at this table , there were no electrical outlets or wires
close by.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>In 1989 my husband lived on North Wall Street. He and
several other contractors shared this house for several months. There was a
lady dressed in circa 1930-5 clothing loved strong perfumes, and hated for the
doors and windows to be shut. After numerous times of returning from work to
find the house open and windows open, the owner nailed the windows shut. The
next night when they returned from ABX the doors and all the windows were OPEN.
My husband saw her several times. I have a letter he wrote to me at the time
and we had several telephone conversations about her.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The Historical Society were I worked has several spirits.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A Civil War solider, a small girl, are two I know about.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Contact me for more information.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The town is full of hauntings but the locals dont talk much
about them. The Wickersham home on <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">South
  South Street</st1:address></st1:Street> just south of Truesdell is active
with sightings of Mr. Wickersham. He was a local builder and this was his home,
in the 1800s.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When I read about the unknown ghost at Mapes it sent a chill

that she was going to take up residence there. I used to laugh when<span style="">&nbsp; </span>she told me that . I will laugh no more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was on social security and old age
pension and never had enough money to make ends meet. I would drive from <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">San Francisco</st1:City></st1:place> to spend a
weekend with her and she would take $20 go with me to Mapes and she always and
I mean Always<span style="">&nbsp; </span>won at least 100.00 to
200.00 dollars on that trip. She always played a certain machine,a dime machine
by the door. This was the only time she would gamble,on the one weekend I would
drive down to go with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I feel better
now knowing that she is happy in her after life because I believe it is Mickey
that is in that casino.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Strange Experience</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: rhonda10558@yahoo.com</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Hi, my name is Rhonda. I worked in the operating room,
assisting an orthopaedic surgeon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
surgery usually started around 7:30 am, I live about 30 miles from the
hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got a late start that
morning so I was speeding down the road. I was passing by a county park that
was enclosed by a fence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was this
huge catipilliar truck that took up the entire area from the road to the
fence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was an older man with white
hair . gold t-shirt, and blue jeans on, waving his arms up in the cab.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I assumed he was tring to slow me down. Then
as I aproach him I think maybe he was having a heart attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that point I was beside him and could not
see up into the cab , it was too high so I was looking out my side mirror
hoping to be able to see up into the cab as soon as I cleared the
equipment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as I cleared it and
could no longer see the yellow f the equipment I looked in my mirror again and
he was gone as well as the one ton piece of equipment I just cleared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stopped my car in the middle of the road,
got out of my car to look down the road. Nothing, there ws nowhere for him to
go, as the park is half a mile long, with a fence all the way around it.
Needless to say I totally freaked out. I called my mom cring and she told me
not to go to work that it might be a sign I could be in an accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this day, I don't know why this
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did go onto work, but did
not get over<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ten miles an hour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've had other experiences ever since, I was
about six, so I totally belive in ghosts and Angels, but this was pretty extreme.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A Mother's Story</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Well, I have been reading your site-wonderful by the way!
But I digress, I have an experience to share with you.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I was a single mother living with my sister in a four
bedroom house in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Copperas Cove</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">Texas</st1:State></st1:place>. My infant son and I shared
a bedroom. My son was prone to ear infections and upper respitory infections
when he was younger, when he was sick I would put him on the bed between me and
the wall to check on his breathing. One night I was drifting off, holding my
little baby's hand-when I felt like someone was crawling up the bed. I had a Siamese
cat who slept on my pillow up until her death (at the ripe old age of 14,) but
I had thought it was her who was coming to curl up on her pillow. I glanced up
above my head and there was my cat with all of her fur standing on end! Than I
felt a paralysis crawl over my entire body. I couldn't move even my toes! To
say I was terrified for my baby and myself was an understatement! </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Now I have not been what you would call religious my entire
life, but that night I remembered every single prayer I could think of. I
repeated the Lord's Prayer, the major Psalms, and four Our Fathers. Think I
even said a few Native-American and Hebrew prayers too. I kept feeling
something trying to rip my hand away from my baby. After saying these prayers
in my mind-I commanded whatever was holding me to leave-it wasn't invited-to
depart my dwelling. I looked at the end of my bed and there was a shadowy
figure staring at me and my baby with such malice that thinking of it still
makes my heart shudder. The figure turned and walked out the window. After this
figure departed, I turned on every light I had in that bedroom. I checked on my
son and he was blissfully sleeping. The room smelled like burnt matches, and
burnt hair. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I yelled for my sister, she came running thinking something
was wrong with the baby. I told her what I have just written here, we both went
to the window and on the floor was a set of foot prints burned into the parquay
wood floor, along with hand prints on the oak windowsill. I am 30 years old
now, and I still remember the feeling of something traveling along my body,
trying to break the hold I had on my son's little hand. My son is 9 now, and I
check on him frequently. And get every house I live in blessed.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Well when I was is 4th grade my friends and I were obsessed
with paranormal. Now<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the bathroom in our
school was supposedly haunted so being the kids we were we went in there a lot.
During lunch my friends would go to the bathroom in pairs they would come back saying
that they heard whispering.So one day I decided to be brave with my friend. so
while I went to the bath room my friend was washing her hands so she asked me
if I was singing something. I said no then later she said she saw a person and
I walked out and saw nothing to find my friend scared to death.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>my great-grandmother &amp; father owned it in the early
1900's, and my grandmother grew up there- they used to bed in her in a drawer
in the sideboard so they could keep an eye on her while they ran the lower
floor of the inn!</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>my grandmother visited in the 80s, the owner was a charming
woman who had many stories of the place being VERY haunted. the spirits were
all benign, but there were audo, visual, and physical manifestations - the most
interesting being a room where the bedcovers were always rumpled as if someone
had laid on them- no matter that no one had been in the room, or how many times
they were straightened. they also saw a women in long old-fashioned skirts
walking the halls that they nicknamed 'the white lady'. my grandma did not know
who that spirit might be.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>a few months later my family took a trip up there and
visited as well. we took along an aunt on my father's side (that lived in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">tacoma</st1:City></st1:place>) who turned out to
be quite sensitive to the place. she sensed all sorts of weird anomolies &amp;
'cold spots' and was traumatized to no end by the courtyard (my grandma later
said when she was very little a fire broke out in the henhouse, and she watched
dying chickens burning alive in the courtyard. i guess her horrified feelings
stuck there for many years)</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>we took a long &amp; interesting tour of the place,
including the 'rumpled bed' room, had lunch with the owner, and left. once
outside, my mother, with her ever present super-8 camera, took a slow panning
shot of the hotel exterior, lingering for a bit on the haunted room...the
furthest window to the right looking at the hotel from the front. everything
seemed normal when she took the film (we were directly across the street, our
whole party of six was looking while she filmed it, and saw nothing unusual)
but when we got the film back and watched it at home...there was a white figure
of a woman in period dress relaxing with her arms on the windowsill. well you
can imagine how much we TRIPPED when we saw that...i think we almost burned out
the film watching that section over and over again.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>after that my mom started doing a lot of research,
ransacking old family photos and spending hours searching old newspaper
microfilms at the public library- and she found out who the 'white lady' was.
it was her great-grandmother addie, who was quite famous in her time. she was a
designer for butterick patterns, and known as 'the angel of sing-sing' because
she helped save her beau from death row after he was falsely accused of
murdering his employer (the death turned out to be accidental). she later
contracted cancer and died in the hotel in- you guessed it- the 'rumpled bed'
room where we filmed the ghostly gazer. apparantly my grandma was too young
when it happened to remember or possibly not born yet...can't quite remember
myself.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>after my mom figured it all out she sent copies of all the
articles and photos to the owner of the place and she said YES, that was
definately the spirit she had seen there.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>the current website for the hotel is
http://www.hotelplanter.com/index.html and it looks like the present owners are
promoting it as a far more upscale and genteel place than the quaintly antique
and haunted place it once was.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Haunting at Redwood Elem in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">FOntana</st1:City></st1:place> Ca.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: gos_92325@yahoo.com</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I am a custodian in the fontana school dist, I was a
custodian at Redwood elementary from 1999 to 2001, This happened in a span of
one week before I transferred out of redwood elem to alder middle school.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span>It was winter time
but I cant remember what month. My work partner and I were monitoring restrooms
at the end of the day, to keep kids from going in messing up the restroom
before they go home.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>we were standing on both sides of the door when two little
boys asked if they can use the restroom we said OK but be quick. as we are
standing there the whole school seemed to empty out, but the two kids in the
restroom. So, we opened the door and shouted in the restroom for the kids to
Finnish up. after a couple of minutes, no one came out. So, both of us went in
and said time to get out but there was no one in there. We looked at the floor
in the stalls and saw no feet. So, we thought the kids were playing and
standing on the toilet seat. There were three stalls. So, we opened the first
stall no kids, then the second stall, no kids so on the last stall we opened it
quickly to scare them but there was no kids. So, my partner said I saw nothing
and left the restroom. since it was my restrooms I started to clean them.
Latter on that night we were in the staff lounge eating lunch. when my partner
crys out ouch stop that I said what wrong he said I hit him with a advil pill.
I said how can I hit you with a pill I am sitting right next to you.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Just as I finished that sentence an other pill beamed him in
the head. And a fan in the top right corner turned on all by its self but it
wasn't plugged in and then it turned off. My partner got up and left the
lounge. I stayed to Finnish my lunch. The last thing that happened that week
was towards the end I think it was a Thursday. We were in the staff lounge
again eating lunch and it was raining outside when we heard a scratching and
taping at the back right door on the south side of the room. it started lightly
but got louder. So, my partner and I thought it was those two kids playing with
us. So, we stood on both sides of the door waiting for them to make the noise
again. And once they did we swung the door open to scare them but there was no
one there my partner took off after them I he saw them running around a
building. I saw nothing but when he took off all I could see was his foot
prints in the rain and no others. He swearers he saw the boys But I didn't see
a thing. I just heard the scratching and tapping on the door. After that we
both left that school for different schools.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Stories I have Experienced</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: DreamFortune@aol.com</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I grew up in a house that was full of layers of ghosts
dating from the early settlers of western <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Virginia</st1:place></st1:State> forward. It had been a log cabin on
the frontier of <st1:State w:st="on">Virginia</st1:State> on the old Wilderness
Trail that Daniel Boone took to <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Kentucky</st1:place></st1:State>.
Later this became the Carolina Post road for the post coaches of the later day.
It had been added to 3 times---and the original cabin walls were visable in the
basement under the newer and oldest part of the house.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>As a child I did not ever want to be alone and was very
aware of them in our end of the house---used by the post coaches in poor
weather as a refuge for passangers and coachmen. The original was built by a
minster who came to teach the indian children. There was a graveyard in the
woods---and a ghost or 2 on the grounds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>We left the house behind in 1957 and I never went back---but
I dream of it often!!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wonder if the
current residents who have altered it so much from our time there have visitors
and particularly the man at the garden entrance---who seemed to be actually
mean and vindictive!!!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I wish Taps
could investigate it or some other group of ligitamite investigators---or a
good team of physics.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Each house i have lived in has had a presence---the most
evident and maybe validated being a 1 Golf Course Drive, Tuscaloosa---but I
think he was a personal ghost sent to help me in a hard time of my life. The
funny thing was the neighbor's reaction when I described him as I saw him quite
clearly. They gasped and said it was the former owner's stepfather who had
lived there and was just as I described him when he died of TB!</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I hope you have a great success with your site and will refer
others as I was referred!!!</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Impressionable Experiences</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: Anonymous</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Several impressionable experiences:</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When I was around 5 or 6 years old my family had moved from
VA. Beach, VA to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Danville</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">VA.</st1:State></st1:place><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We moved into a small house off of main street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sisters eventually moved in with us and we
needed a bigger house so Mom found one right on <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Main St</st1:address></st1:Street>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was a very old house with a large front porch and an open kitchen
under the house it was really a neat house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My bedroom was once I believe like a sitting room, it had no closet<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My older sisters had a bedroom at the very
back of the house. I had to walk thru my Mom &amp; Dads room to get the the
hallway which led to the back of the house and the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night I woke up needing to go to the
bathroom and saw shadows against my bedroom wall. The shadows disappeared under
my bed as they approached the side of it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was scared and was like in a trance while they approached and I could
not move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I finally was released from
the trance like state and was able to get out of bed and go thru M &amp; D's
room to go the the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I was
walking down the Hall I could see into my sisters bedroom where there was a
beautiful light glowing in an Aqua color, as I walked closer to the door to the
bathroom I could see into my sisters bedroom where I saw this beautiful small
fairy like figure floating over my sisters head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I really thought I was sleep walking but this
was just too vivid.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I did mention this
to my sisters later and they do not re call any unusual occurrences at that
house.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Other encounters I have had:</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My husband and I had bought a small trailer in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Chesapeake</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">VA</st1:State></st1:place>
off of <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Military Hwy.</st1:address></st1:Street><span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we moved in it was just me and my
husband, but eventually our children from previous marriages moved into our
small trailer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So noises and sounds of
walking down the hall would be heard when we were in the shower or our back
bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well one day my husband and I
was taking a shower together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The kids
where out side either at friends houses or riding bikes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband and I both heard foot steps coming
down the hall towards the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Well of course we thought one of the kids had come home and didn't think
anything about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we got out of
the shower we called out to see who was home and received no reply. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Okay so we thought they came home and left
again no big deal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well another day we
again were taking a shower together and heard the foot steps again coming down
the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well this time all the kids
where not home they were away for the weekend.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My husband climbs out of the shower and wraps a towel around him and
opens the bathroom door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one is
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This happened on many
occasions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Taking a shower hearing the
steps getting out to check if someone was there.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>So<span style="">&nbsp; </span>then we thought we
may be hearing sounds from our neighbors but it was so loud and you could feel
the trailer per say vibrate as the steps came down the hall way.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Well one night my husband and I were watching TV in the
living room .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our TV was set against the
Half wall between the Kitchen area and the living room area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We could see thru to the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We both were watching TV and out of the
corner of my eye I see the upper kitchen cabinet over the stove open slowly and
then it closed slowly. I turn to look at my husband and he is turning to look
at me and at the same time we<span style="">&nbsp; </span>said
"Did you see that?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it really
freaked us out.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>On another occasion the kids were home and had friends
staying with them over night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were
sitting in the Living room about 6 of us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And one of my tennis shoes that was on the floor did a 360 degree spin
right in front of us all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was amazing
to us all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The shoes were on shag carpet
no way they could just spin and no one I mean no one was around them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And only one shoe turned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just a few minutes later a glass ash tray
that was setting on the coffee table broke in half.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I mean this ash tray was clean (thank good
ness or there would have been a mess to clean up). And no one was smoking or
had used it.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Our Sons friend, was scared to death he said he was going
home and he would not spend the night ever again. (From here after we were the
people who lives in the haunted trailer)</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Well we would call our ghost George and when things would
come up missing we would blame him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
kids loved that they would not get in trouble if they had mis- placed
something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All they had to do was say
"George did it"</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Well we eventually moved from the trailer and moved to a 3
bedroom brick home in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Chesapeake</st1:place></st1:City>
also.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Nothing happened at the house until I lost my best pet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I loved this Chow so much!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was a beautiful Black Chow with long
glossy fur I called her Onyx. We took her to <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">North Carolina</st1:place></st1:State> to our camp house.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She died while we were there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We wrapped her up and brought her back to our
house and buried her in the back yard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was just the best dog I had ever had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Well a few weeks went by and I was in the kitchen cooking
and out of the corner of my eye I see a black flash from the hall to the
kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was like I did not see
that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I knew it was my beloved
Onyx.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did not say anything to my
husband for I didn't think he would believe me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Well Onyx would wake me up in the morning by nudging or licking my
hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several morning's I would feel
this and think she was still with us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
had even seen her in our back yard and also seen her walking<span style="">&nbsp; </span>towards the back door from the yard.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>One day I was in the living room and my husband had gone to
the back door to let our other Chow in.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Cinnamon is cinnamon in color and no way you can mistake her for a black
chow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband was going to let
Cinnamon in the house and he saw a black chow about 20 feet away from the back
door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He turned to me and said
"Honey I know you are not going to believe me but I just saw Onyx in the
back yard".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was like "You
did?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I then told him that I had
been seeing her in the house and the yard and she also was still waking me up
in the morning like she used to do when she was alive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also let me know he had been seeing her ,
but didn't want to let me know because he knew how heart broken I was over her
loss.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The next time I saw her coming up to the back porch I told
her how much I loved and missed her and let her know she should go into the
light (Per Sylvia Brown) and I would reunite with her when it was my time to
go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Some times I wish I had not sent
her into the light so I could still see her)</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I now have another Chow we call her Diamond she is a light
color reddish brown, when she was born she had a Black shaped Diamond on her
tail (I love diamonds and have a nice collection of them) .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told my husband that Onyx was reincarnated
into Diamond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was when Diamond was
first born.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Well Diamond is now a year
old and she does have a lot of mannerisms that Onyx had. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I would like to say I love your site.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the many contributions of story's that
you allow us to submit and share with others that are believers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thank you for letting me share.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My Family's Experiences with the Supernatural</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: proud_pinoy7193@yahoo.com</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The Ukeleles</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>This experience was shared to me by my dad and his brothers.
</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My grandpa one night brought home three ukeleles for my dad
and uncles. They were around 10 to 11 years old at the time. They enjoyed the
little guitar-like instruments so much. One night, my dad suddenly got up and
woke up my uncle. He asked him if he heard the ukeleles playing, and my uncle
said yes. But he just told my dad to just go back to sleep. Then my dad got up
again; this time the chilling melody of the ukeleles were louder, like they
were playing outside their room. My dad, without hesitation, ran to my his
oldest brother. But my uncle suddenly got up and told him, "I know, I hear
them too." They just prayed and slept.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The Mirror</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My granduncle had this experiences in the same house
where<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my dad's ukeleles were playing on
their own. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>One night, my granduncle had to use the bathroom. He was
sleeping on the second floor of the old house and there was only one bathroom
and it was on the ground floor. To get to the bathroom, you have to pass by
this fairly large mirror. So now, my granduncle was headed for the bathroom,
when he passed by the mirror, he saw this blurred, dark image and he was sure
it wasn't him. After using the bathroom, he passed by the mirror, and now he
can see what he saw earlier clearer. It was some man with red skin, long black
hair and was bleeding all over. He just ran back up to his room and slept,
scared.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Party much?</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>This one occasion happened in the same house where the
ukelele and mirror events occured. This happened before right around I was
born.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My uncle and my dad have moved out and had their own
families. My dad's oldest brother stayed in the house with his new wife. They
didn't have kids yet back then. My aunt (uncle's new wed wife) had a little
chat with their neighbor who happened to be my second degree aunt. She asked my
uncle's wife how come they weren't invited when they had a party last night. My
aunt was surprised because they didn't have a party. Her neighbor described
what heard. SHe told my aunt that she heard a lot of footsteps and stomping,
like there was atleast a hundred people. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Later, on my aunt finds out from a pastor that their house
was infested by angry spirits who were trapped in it. She had the house blessed
and prayed.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>NOTE ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE HOUSE: The house is located at
a compound. Long ago, around the time when the japanese left the <st1:country-region w:st="on">philippines</st1:country-region> (BTW, the house is in the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">philippines</st1:country-region></st1:place>),
a huge warehouse stood on the same spot where the compound is now. Townspeople
said that the warehouse was a place where many people were murdered and women
raped. Up to this day, the new owners of the house (who happens to be my dad's
cousin) can still feel spirits. Door knobs locking on their own, doors banging,
sudden change in temperature and such.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Now we can get started with my own experiences</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Ma'am are you there?</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Back when I was in fifth grade, I didn't go on the school
buses because my dad will pick me and my brother up. One afternoon, my dad
failed to pick us up at exactly 4:00 PM, his usual pick up time. He had too
much patients as a doctor and one of his patients was giving birth. So I waited
at the gate where the security guards relaxed. I got thirsty but the drinking
fountain was far from the gate. But I decided to suck it up and walk all the
way to the other end of the extremely long hall. In my school, there was this
tri-level building where the technology rooms are located. When pass by this
open hallways, you'll see the balcony of the building. Then I saw a glimpse of
a woman, leaning over the railing like she was looking down. I thought it was
one of my teachers I said hi, but I was wrong. It was some one else. It was a
lady; with long flowing dress, her hair big and her face white...all white. I
was scared and it seemed like everything stopped and I forgot about my thirst.
I ran back to the gate where my dad, the guards and my brother were sitting,
waiting for me. I never told them about the lady until a week or so. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>ABOUT MY SCHOOL: My school is located along a busy avenue in
<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Quezon City</st1:City>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Philippines</st1:country-region></st1:place>. People said that
before the building was built, there was a field there with really,really tall
grass and women was said to have been raped on that field. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>NOTE: I thought I was the only one who had supernatural
experiences around the school, but so did my friends. My best friend, AJ, was
playing on our soccer field, behind the building. While he was playing with his
soccer ball, he saw a lady in white, walking around the field. She was
wandering, walking in circles, looking up into the sky like she was waiting for
justice. AJ looked closely and he knew that the lady was the ghost of the
building because she was atleast a foot floating above the ground. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>We now call her Ms. Benitez, from the name of the building
where she lurks. The building's name is <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Tomas</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Benitez</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Building</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I am a full time student at Sage College of Albany, where
people have experienced paranormal activity. I have also experienced it at the
school, but not in the building that is listed on your website. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I frequently go to the library on campus. The second floor
of the library is usually empty, or only one or two people will be there. The
first time I experienced activity was in September 2007. There was one other
person on the second floor, but no where near where I was sitting. I kept
getting a feeling that someone was looking at me or right next to me, and I
could hear what sounded like breathing close to me. I took a look around and
there was no one. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The second time I experienced activity was today, November
7, 2007. I was on the second floor of the library again, and this time there
was absolutely no one except me. As I sat there working on a paper I heard
movement behind me, and something dark came up to the side of me. I turned
around to look, but once again there was no one to see. I went back to my work,
and a few minutes later there was a scraping sound against the floor, as if
someone was moving a chair around. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I left the library immediately- I didn&#8217;t want to find out
who or what else was up there!</big></p>
