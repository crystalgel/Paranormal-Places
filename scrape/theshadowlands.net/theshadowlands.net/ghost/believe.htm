Me!</font></font></b>

<p><br><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arrus BT">We all have our own beliefs and disbeliefs.
To try and convince someone who is a non-believer that you saw a supernatural
event is very hard.&nbsp; The job becomes easier if you have the documentation
down as to what, when, why, and how.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arrus BT">Skeptics and non-believers play an important
part in the supernatural world. They help us to be rational about our experiences.&nbsp;
They also help us by trying to find natural causes for events that may
seem unnatural.&nbsp; They bring up serious points that we may not always
think of ourselves and help us to keep our feet on the floor.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arrus BT">The questions that a skeptic asks are questions
that we should ask ourselves and think about when the events are occurring.&nbsp;
The gathering of information needed to answer these questions will help
us determine whether there was an actual supernatural occurrence or just
a series of coincidences that led us to belief that supernatural forces
were at work.&nbsp; It is also best to keep a record of events and how
you followed through with them to prove they were</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arrus BT">unnatural.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arrus BT">If you feel a cold spot check for possible
drafts.&nbsp; Write down or try to remember when and where it happened
to see if it is a regular occurrence or just a fluke. If you see a shadow
orb or mist check for any tricks of light,</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arrus BT">reflections or smoke that might have caused
the sighting.&nbsp; Again keep an record of time and place to see if there
is a pattern. Don't assume it is a spirit when you misplace things. Keep
records of what was missing, where and</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arrus BT">when it turned back up and where you thought
you left the item to begin with. Same with unexplained noises. Keep a record
of what was heard, where , and what time.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arrus BT">Always try to find a natural cause. If you
don't a skeptic or non-believer will!&nbsp; Sometimes the truth can be
stranger then any supernatural cause. I once heard a story about a woman
after having some work done to her house,</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arrus BT">kept hearing voices in the basement. It was
really scaring her.&nbsp; She heard it for a few days when it abruptly
stopped.&nbsp; She of course thought that whatever it was in her basement
must have moved on. Turns out a workman</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arrus BT">when pouring her new cement floor had dropped
his portable radio in the cement. Rather then try to dig it out. He had
smoothed it over and left it there. The radio had been on a talk radio
station.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arrus BT">So the point to all this is to become your
own skeptic, investigate what you feel may be unwanted company so you have
the information available to answer the questions from skeptics, believers
and non-believers alike.&nbsp; Also there will always be at least one non-believer
in your life that no matter what evidence you present will not believe
. Sometimes it takes them to have an experience of their own to believe,
sometimes not even that will sway them.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arrus BT">These are just my opinions. I welcome yours
in email, or on the message board.</font></b>
