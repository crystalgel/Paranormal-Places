Milford Mill Swim Club Sighting<br>
By:&nbsp; depps962@gmail.com<br>
The Milford Mill swim club is an aquatic club in Randallstown,
Maryland. It houses an indoor swimming pool and an outdoor quarry. In
the late 1980&#8217;s I attended a swim party there. I had been inside having
a great time dancing, partying and enjoying myself. After dancing I
started feeling hot and needed some air so I went outside with a dance
partner to chill out for a minute. We found a bench near a dark and
deep looking swimming hole. It looked like a large hole that had been
roped off. It was very dark and you could barely see anything inside it
but I clearly saw that it had been closed by management. The owners
obviously didn&#8217;t want any of the partygoers to go into that area and
get hurt. As me and my dance partner were sitting there talking I
noticed a young woman dressed in a long white dress in the swim hole
area. When I saw her I thought that it was really strange that she
would be in that closed area. I watch her descend into the swimming
hole. It looked like she was floating down stairs. We both saw her and
questioned each other wondering where she was going because it was
extremely dark down there. During the time that we sat there, we never
saw her come back up. I remember having a creepy feeling in seeing her
going into the hole. I guess because we had both had a few drinks and
were having a good time, we joked about her probably being a ghost and
continued having a great time at the party. As years have gone by I&#8217;ve
always wondered about that strange sighting. <br>

A Haunting as told by a Scared Teenager<br>
By:&nbsp; momndeege@att.net<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;I'm a teenager living at home with my mother, and I've been <br>
experiencing some strange things. I apologize now, as my story becomes
very long, but even then, <br>
some parts have been paraphrased. I also understand if this seems
far-fetched, but please, bare with me <br>
and my story. Trust me, I have never believed in "possession", by any
means. I always thought it was <br>
something people faked for attention. I know now that this could not be
the case. <br>
All my life, I have been around the paranormal. I never truly realized
it until recently, but ghosts and <br>
supernatural beings have been following me ever since I was small. I
can remember seeing dancing lights in my grandmother's hallway, and
being deathly afraid of being by myself in two bathrooms of one of the
many houses I've lived in when I was young. More recently, as in the
past two or three years, my <br>
hauntings have become much more malevolent. They rarely targeted me,
however. I would walk into a <br>
room and see a violent image of a gray, skeletal woman with her
talon-like hands reaching for me, and I <br>
ended up sleeping in the living room for a good part of my teenage
life. <br>
As I said, though, they rarely targeted me personally. But if I had
guests over, something would always <br>
bother them. We would be reading over my friend's Wicca books together,
and he would suddenly jump <br>
from the chair and say, "Something just grabbed my hair." We asked him
if maybe it got caught on the <br>
chair or something, and he said, "No, something GRABBED it." <br>
Another evening, I had a different friend over who was going to go on a
small roadtrip with me and my <br>
mother the next morning. Thanks to the frightening occurences, I've
become somewhat of a night owl <br>
and don't usually go to sleep until dawn. So, as I was sitting in the
recliner with the TV off, my friend <br>
suddenly whimpered in what I assumed was her sleep. I thought she'd
been having a nightmare, but when we got up in the morning, she pulled
me aside and told me that she heard the fan turn off (which it hadn't),
and something sat on her body and snarled in her ear. I thought it
might be sleep paralysis, but that doesn't usually include audio
hallucinations, does it? <br>
Time goes on, and we move to a new house (for financial reasons). This
house is less "haunted", but I do <br>
get grabbed a few times here. Nothing VERY severe. I still refuse to
sleep in my own bedroom. <br>
We move again not even a full year later, into the house we're
currently living in. HERE is where <br>
everything becomes horrible.<br>
My mom's boyfriend becomes very aggressive (he's always had a sort of
violent behavior, but it <br>
escalates during and after the move). I become stressed out from this,
and end up hiding in my bedroom <br>
often. About two weeks into the house, I hear strange noises in the
hall. I go out to see if it's simply my <br>
mother and her boyfriend duking it out, but they're both asleep with
their bedroom door closed. I go <br>
back to my room, and don't hear the noise again.<br>
As time goes on, I start to have friends over. When they stay for the
night, we would all usually sleep in <br>
the living room as it has all the couches and chairs. <br>
My first friend, Darlin, stayed up longer than I one night. When I got
up, she said that she saw shadows <br>
ducking in and out of my kitchen and hallway all night long, even after
she turned the TV off. <br>
Soon after that, I had my friends Braedon and Tayler over. Tayler is a
presumed "psychic", and can <br>
communicate and channel the spirits. She's younger than I, so we try to
keep a limit on what she does <br>
and how often, so something doesn't get in and hurt her. <br>
Anyway, they stayed the night, and in the morning, Tayler said she saw
shadows in my house all night. <br>
Mind you, I did not tell her about what Darlin had seen. <br>
Things progress. The noises get a bit louder and more frequent, and I
start going over to my friends' <br>
houses more than I used to, just to get away from it. And when I
couldn't, I brought friends over, for <br>
protection and a distraction.<br>
At some point, I brought a male friend of mine over. He had been
watching a bit too much anime, which <br>
are very dramatic, usually Japanese, cartoons, and said he had a
strange urge to come home with me <br>
after I had told him all of the things that had been happening. He was
feeling protective, he said. <br>
So he (his name is Stephen) comes over, and we quietly mingle about my
room. Browsing the Internet, <br>
talking about the occult, normal dark teenager things. <br>
After a few hours, Stephen says he'd like to meditate and work on his
spiritual self. So he sits in the <br>
corner of my room and meditates while I draw in my sketchbook quietly,
so I don't disturb him. <br>
About ten minutes into it, I suddenly feel nauseated and my vision
darkens, into what my friend Braedon <br>
told me later was "tunnel vision". I sat up, disturbed by the fact that
it happened. Stephen was <br>
completely silent, and his eyes and feet were twitching slightly. I sat
in the farthest corner from him, on <br>
my bed, and just stared at him. I don't quite remember why I didn't
wake him up, but I should have. <br>
A moment after my strange symptoms, Stephen stood up and edged his way
towards me, eyes shut. He <br>
expertly moved over my TV and past a clothes pile on my floor, still
not opening his eyes. Then he <br>
stood with his knees to the edge of my bed, just an inch from my legs.
As he got nearer, my sick feeling <br>
became worse. Stephen then suddenly shouted, "Get out of here!" so loud
and so abruptly that I <br>
flinched. I almost cried, out of sheer and uncalled-for terror. He said
something else, but I don't quite <br>
remember, and then the next hour was extremely blurry. I remember bits
and pieces, parts where Stephen <br>
was saying "let me talk to Deege" (which is my nickname), and "are you
Deege?" I answered yes, and my <br>
voice sounded rough even to my own ears, like I'd smoked several packs
of cigarettes. I also remember <br>
that whenever he touched me, it felt like he was putting a hot iron to
my skin. (To this day, I will not let <br>
him touch me, as it hurts and aggravates me.) <br>
At some point, I "woke up" completely. Stephen told me what had
happened - that I had took on a <br>
completely different voice and personality, and snarled obscenities to
him, damned his god, thrown a <br>
bible at him, clawed his arm to the point of bleeding, and challenged
him to a fight several <br>
times. Stephen then told me in a solemn voice that he was going home. I
didn't want him to leave, as I <br>
was confused and extremely scared, but I let him go. <br>
The next day at school, we told Braedon and Tayler, and Stephen showed
them his arm. I was shocked <br>
when he displayed the several long, shallow cuts, and said that "I" had
done it, when I was "possessed." <br>
Braedon and Tayler became extremely concerned, and spent as much time
as they could with me and <br>
Stephen. We took the lunch together in the school's theatre by
ourselves so we could talk without being <br>
interrupted. Braedon decided that it would be better for us, as a
group, to be with each other as much as we could.<br>
The next few days (the original incident occurred on Monday, and this
happened on Tuesday) were, <br>
summarily, hell for me. Stephen came to my house again on either
Wednesday or Thursday, despite <br>
Braedon's warnings, and the "demon" came out again and continued its
minor string of hate towards <br>
Stephen. He did, however, get a name out of it - Six, as in the actual
number 6. <br>
The weekend was normal, and the following Monday was simply a talk day,
where I spent time with my <br>
friends at school but brought no one home. <br>
Tuesday, after school, Braedon, Tayler, and Stephen all come to my
house. Braedon has decided he <br>
wants to do research on this "demon", and wants to see it for himself.
I, being as dumb as they come, <br>
agreed. I wanted them to learn about it so they could get rid of it,
since they were far more into the occult and supernatural, having dealt
and presently been dealing with a possession of their own. <br>
They come over, and Six shows his face while we're crammed into my
bedroom. Braedon has Stephen <br>
leave the room (as Stephen is the instigator in almost ALL cases, for
some unknown reason), and then <br>
calmly talks to Six. Six apparently dislikes talking to him and answers
his questions ("what's your name?" <br>
"why are you here?") rudely and sarcastically. But he enjoys talking to
Tayler, who politely refuses to <br>
exchange much conversation.<br>
Around thirty minutes into it, Six recedes and Braedon tells me that
we're all going out to the park, where the "energy is less crowded" (we
have a very large park near my house, with plenty of side areas where
we wouldn't be disturbed). We go out to the park and sit on a secluded
area, out of the sun, and just talk amongst ourselves. Tayler tries to
teach Stephen how to astral travel (a failed lesson) while Braedon and
I talk about our "demons". He tells me what his has done, and suggests
that they may be connected.&nbsp; Once Stephen gives up, Braedon has
Tayler try to read everything that's going on in my body, with the
"demon" and all. We lay back on the blanket that we brought and she
enters my mind or what have you, and talks gently to Six.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
am not a person who believes in this sort of thing, or at least without
some skeptic doubt. I myself am empathic, and take pride in that I have
mild psychic ability. But I don't really think highly of people who
claim they can get into others and read them that way. And I wouldn't
mention this event, if it had not been that at some point, I woke up
and Braedon and Tayler were calling my name. They said that Six had
taken over again, and whenever Braedon would ask a question, Tayler and
"I" would say the same exact answer at the same exact time, instantly.
These questions weren't previously discussed, and were different than
ones he had asked of Six before. There was no way Tayler and I could
have synced so well like that. <br>
Braedon took Stephen for a walk to discuss things, and Tayler stayed
back to comfort me. At some <br>
point, the line between myself and Six became blurred, and I felt
ultra-sensitive to everything. I grabbed <br>
her hand and felt her fingers, and said, "You've played an instrument
before." I tapped my fingers, like I <br>
was playing either a trumpet or a very short piano key. She nodded and
said, "A trumpet, when I was <br>
little. But I didn't play for very long, and I wasn't very good." She
never told me this information before. I <br>
grabbed her hand again and said, "I hear motorcycles. Your dad's and
yours." Her dad, who has been <br>
deceased for fifteen years, did own a motorcycle. But what she hadn't
told me was that she herself had <br>
a small toy motorcycle when she was younger, that she obviously didn't
have now. <br>
Braedon and Stephen came back, and we concluded that I was spending the
night and Braedon and <br>
Tayler's (who are a couple, might I mention). They called Tayler's mom,
and she picked us up from the <br>
park.<br>
After picking up some things from my house (clothes, school things) and
dropping Stephen off at his <br>
house, we went to their little home. I did a bit of my laundry there,
then we played some Truth or Dare <br>
until the laundry was done. I took a shower (very quickly, as their
bathroom was haunted and you can just feel yourself being scolded for
being a stranger to whoever was in there), changed into my fresh
clothes, and went back to the bedroom. They were quiet and laying on
the bed, and I asked if they took a nap while I was in there. Tayler
responded rather flatly, "No", then got up. They went together to take
a shower. I laid back on their enormous bed and accidentally fell
asleep (by now it was 11 o'clock at night), and woke up to Tayler
getting dressed. "Where's Braedon?" I asked sleepily. "Still in the
bath. He's going to stay a bit longer." She sounded a little mad, so I
didn't press on the matter. Braedon finished and got dressed in the
bathroom, nd we all settled into bed. Braedon was against the wall,
Tayler in the middle, and I was on the edge.I had drifted off to a
light sleep when Tayler suddenly whimpered. I jolted awake and looked
over. "It's just me," I heard Braedon say. "I'm just saying runes."
(He's Asatru, a Viking-like religion.) He coaxed Tayler into relaxing,
and I fell asleep again. <br>
Around 1:30 AM, I awoke again to Tayler murmuring, "Braedon?" <br>
In response, there was a soft, hissing growl. I instantly tensed up,
knowing that she was not talking to <br>
Braedon.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was some conversation exchanged in the
pitch-black dark of her room, where she tried to talk to whatever was
inside Braedon. He responded in a terrifying voice, soft and menacing
and hissy at first. Then there was an animalistic snarl, and I heard
Tayler be dragged up under him. She called out for me to grab him as he
scrambled over the bed, and I grabbed tightly onto him. We dropped to
the floor in a heap and I clambered over to try and pin him down.
Tayler swung her body over his legs, and we both screamed for her
mother. The door bursted open and the light switched on, and Tayler's
mother came in.&nbsp; She saw Braedon snarling beneath us and commanded
that we sit on him to keep him down. I straddled his upper back, and
Tayler sat on his legs. Tayler's mom (Debbie) then talked to the thing
inside Braedon. Well, they argued, really - exchanging hateful, hurtful
things. He mocked her life, and she laughed in his face over it. <br>
"Braedon" then turned his head to look at me, and said, "I know Six is
in there." (We hadn't told Debbie <br>
of my own "demon", for fear of her overreacting.) My body instantly
tensed, and that line that separates <br>
me from Six began to blur. "Braedon" called out to Six, to try and get
him to perhaps assist in his <br>
escape (as he was trying to get out of the room, and the house), but
Debbie called my name and broke <br>
me out of it. I went back into panic mode as "Braedon" began to thrash
Tayler and me off of his body. <br>
He dug his teeth into my right arm, and kicked his legs, before shoving
himself up. I toppled off at the <br>
movement, and he wrestled Tayler off instantly. I looked up at him to
see what was happening, and he <br>
twisted his body and slammed his fist into the side of my face. For a
split second, I couldn't see, and <br>
dropped back in shock. I heard the three of them screaming and yelling
at each other and barreling <br>
through the house. "Braedon" managed to careen through and get outside,
and after I got myself <br>
together, I ran out after him, Tayler, and Debbie. Tayler was trying to
get him to come back (he was <br>
walking slowly, like a zombie), and Debbie waved her hand at me and
told me to call his dad. I ran back <br>
to the bedroom and grabbed Braedon's cellphone, and called his dad. <br>
Twenty minutes later, we had the normal Braedon with us in the bedroom,
with his dad sitting on the bed with him. I was on the floor with
Tayler, nursing my own new black eye, and carefully inspecting her <br>
bruises, while we talked over what had just happened. We spent the next
few hours discussing causes <br>
for Braedon's "possession", and protecting the house using an Asatru
ritual (which has worked far better <br>
than any Christian blessing I have ever seen). Debbie mentioned my own
thing to Braedon's dad, and he <br>
nodded to it and didn't speak of it for the moment. Braedon finally
proclaimed he was too tired to stay <br>
up any longer (by now it was 5 AM and I had watched the sun rise) and
he and Tayler went to bed. <br>
Braedon's dad took me home so I could grab some things I had left
behind, and just be around my mom <br>
for a comfort thing. <br>
This happened around the beginning of June, on the last week of school,
this year. Since then, I've had <br>
horrible nightmares of the experience, and I still have the noises in
my hall. (They have, as I've been <br>
typing this, been going off even now. Not extremely loud, but loud
enough to be heard.) I have since <br>
"gone under" only twice with Six, and the last time I nearly strangled
my friend Stephen. Braedon says <br>
that while his dad's ritual has kept his "demon" from causing harm, the
"demon" has been regaining <br>
power slowly, and has been hiding their things and minorly terrorizing
them. He hasn't hurt them, but he is making his presence known.<br>
I'm sure this isn't the end of my story, but I felt it had to be shared
now.<br>

Ghost Story<br>
By:&nbsp; dancing.ghost67@gmail.com<br>
<br>
Hello. I visit your website "the shadowlands" quite frequently as a
friend and I are planning a trip <br>
to investigate some of the haunted locations. We live in Florida in the
Ormond Beach - Daytona <br>
Beach area and we are relatively new at ghost hunting. We have visited
a few cemeteries in <br>
Ormond Beach and Deland but we found nothing. Right now, we only have a
digital camera and <br>
a flashlight. We are working on saving for a better camera that can
take videos. The Sony <br>
handycams are the ones we were looking at for video evidence. We also
would like to each own <br>
a voice recorder to document voices from the "great beyond". My digital
camera is capable of <br>
taking videos with sound but the issue is lighting. I think your
website is great and there are a lot <br>
of cool and unusual ghostly activities at a lot of the locations. It's
a shame that some of them <br>
have been torn down or changed such as the Jacksonville "Greenbriar
Light". The road change <br>
made this ghostly light go away for good unfortunately. Anyway, I have
had several unusual <br>
things happen to me personally - only me - in my house. Nothing happens
when I have friends <br>
over or if my mom is home. I haven't had anything unusual happen lately
but these are my <br>
stories. <br>
The first ghostly activity that happened was when I was in my first or
second year of high <br>
school. It was around 1am and I was listening to music on the computer
via headphones so I <br>
wouldn't wake my dad. He was sleeping on the couch. My dog Scout was
laying next to me <br>
[update - I now have him and two other dogs]. I suddenly heard a loud
bang on the French doors <br>
just next to me. The porch is screened in. I don't know what could have
done it but I looked <br>
outside as soon as it happened and saw nothing. My dog stared out the
doors and laid in front of <br>
them til I went to bed. The second thing I can remember is, a small
painting on an easel fell <br>
around 11pm. I've seen the light in the kitchen flicker off and stay
off. I've seen it flicker on and <br>
stay on. At one point, it kept flicking off and on and stopped when I
looked up. That same night <br>
actually, the broom fell over and almost hit me. Okay, actually, I said
the activity only happened <br>
when it was just me but on the rare occasion ... my friend witnessed
the light flicking off and on <br>
and the broom falling. I've seen each of my three dogs - at all
different times, never at the same <br>
time - appear to be watching something. They've also began barking for
no reason. In the <br>
hallway, we have a hutch and you touch one of the hinges to have the
lights inside it come on. <br>
There are three settings - dim, a bit brighter and brightest. Tapping
it a fourth time turns it off. I <br>
had it on the dimmest setting and later I see it turn off. Thinking the
bulbs burned out, I got up <br>
and tapped the hinge once. It came on instantly. I sat back down and
not even a minute later, the <br>
newest addition to my family of dogs got up from her sleep and ran
around the house barking. <br>
This light has turned off a few times before. It's not on a timer as it
doesn't happen every time. <br>
The last strange occurrence happened in Tennessee after my grandpa
died. He loved the snow, <br>
the mountains and trains and he was to be 77 had he made it through the
rest of February. In <br>
Tennessee, he is buried by train tracks. A train had gone by while I
was there seeing his grave. If <br>
you look behind the train tracks you can see the mountains. Before we
left the cemetery, we <br>
counted the headstones to the left of my grandpa's and behind it. He
came in at number 7 from <br>
the left and from the back. 77. My grandpa's name was Jim. On our way
back to my grandma's <br>
we saw a car license plate that said JIM.&nbsp; Later that night, it
snowed. Those are my ghost stories. <br>
The latest was the touch sensitive light turning off which has not
happened lately - at the end of <br>
last year I believe was the last time it happened. My friend and I have
named the ghost Phoenix <br>
after a member from our favorite band.<br>
I also have a few locations in Ormond Beach and Daytona Beach that you
can add to your site if <br>
you'd like to. The first is the Pilgrim's Rest Cemetery. In the 1800s a
black man was hung for <br>
crimes he was thought to have committed. After his hanging, he was
found innocent. At the time <br>
of his hanging, the Pilgrim's Rest Cemetery was not a cemetery. An
apparition hanging from a <br>
tree near the back of the cemetery have been reported. There is a photo
online - I believe the <br>
Daytona Beach Paranormal Society captured it. You can see the noose and
all.<br>
The second location is in Daytona Beach - 111 Silver Beach Avenue, the
Lillian Place, close to <br>
the Orange Avenue Bridge. The ghost of Lucille is believed to haunt it.<br>

and <br>
locked the door going back to bed when he heard a very loud sound
outside his <br>
front door like if the person was clawing his way thru the door, the
guy got <br>
so scared that he yelled out. Go Away. next thing you know he heard
footsteps <br>
running towards the side window and was doing the same thing. his baby
was <br>
crying and he and his wife were terrified what was happening to them.
within <br>
minutes the thing stoppped and had left. the guy stepped out of his
place and <br>
had courage enough to go to his neighbor and told him his horrified
story, <br>
when his neighbor opened the door he saw him as pale as the milk. when
he <br>
bought the neighbor to see his door and window three distinctive marks
were <br>
clawed to the door it was so thick that you could see the inside of the
<br>
apartment. footsteps were found running away from the apartments shaped
of <br>
hoofs. yes hoofs, needless to say the men stopped and had this strange
feeling <br>
something was going to happen later. when his two friends were going to
the <br>
store they had spotted some type of figure following them corner to
corner it <br>
follwed them. he had gone in to the convienient store and was buying a
bottle <br>
of beer when he felt something aint right here, he put the beer down
and left <br>
the store. within seconds not far from the store a lady was hit by a
car and <br>
flew ten feet away and her body was laying in front of the store. the
guys <br>
were so scared that they had left the store and went back home instead.

about scary some say things cause this for a reason, who knows what
happened. <br>
well thats the end of my story. well thats the end of my scary event
till next <br>
time i will tell you some more.<br>

Council Bluffs, Iowa&nbsp; Squirrel Cage Jail<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
<br>
&nbsp;The feelings of goings on at the jail that are other than mortal
dates back to well before the 123-year-old structure's use as a museum.
Bill Foster, who worked as the jailer in 1950's, opted not to use the <br>
fourth floor as his apartment, "because of the strange goings-on up
there." He reported hearing people walking around on a floor that had
nobody on it, a sensation sufficiently concerning to motivate him to
bunk on the second level prisoner floor instead. <br>
The spirit may actually date back to the jail's origin. A former jail
tour guide claimed she believed the ghost to be that of J.M. Carter,
the man who oversaw the building's construction. Mr. Carter was the
first resident of the top floor apartment and, according to her theory,
has never left, continuing <br>
to watch over the one-of-a-kind building to this day. <br>
There have also been reports of a full body apparition on the fourth
floor identified as Otto Gufath, also a former jailer. Museum staff add
whatever spirit is present, it is friendly; despite an occasional door
that opens by itself, strange lights, or peculiar noises, no one has
ever felt frightened or <br>
in any danger.<br>
There has been some evidence of a female spirit as well. A few years
ago a woman working on a project in the building after hours had been
experiencing peculiar sensations. She walked through the building and
was shocked to see a little girl with a very mournful expression
dressed entirely in gray... inside <br>
a cell whose bars were locked with no way in or out. Occasionally,
visitors have reported feeling that something was tugging at them,
reported a great feeling of sadness in some of the cells, or simply
felt that there was a presence there beyond those visible. The feelings
or being watched of followed <br>
have been most frequently noted on the third and fourth floors.&nbsp;

Haunting at Kells<br>
By: gloriouswaygirl@gmail.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
so my family and I were at a restaurant and pub in Seattle called
Kell's. <br>
while I was there I was taking pictures in the bar. (it was around3 in
the <br>
afternoon no one was allowed to be in there.) i took a picture facing
the back <br>
room, which at one point was a room where they held fuinrals when the
building <br>
was a mortuary. while i was eating lunch I kept feeling as if i was
being watched and my moods <br>
kept changing. a few hours later my friends and i were at a hotel
looking at <br>
pictures from Kell's, when we looked at the photos from the direction
of the <br>
back room. we looked at it closely and saw what looks like a fireman.
the side <br>
of his face was clearly covered in ash and we could tell he was tall
with <br>
black hair.exactly two weeks after the visit to Kell's i had a dream
where i was standing <br>
in the bar and the man walked up to me, put his hands on my shoulders
and said <br>
"Thank you Mykal, thank you for proving my death" i woke up in tears
and <br>
sweating. that morning i was competing in a horse show and all of a
sudden <br>
people started asking me about the picture=<br>

Irene Stops by for a Visit -ORB<br>
By: Lisa.Buck@visitorlando.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<br>
I was married for twenty-five years to an older Jewish man. The
marriage was great up until we moved from our home in Pennsylvania to
Florida. The marriage fell apart and I ran away from home to live in my
own apartment in downtown Orlando. It was 2003 and I was devastated at
the turn of events in my life.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was afraid, tired, angry
and mostly disappointed in the separation. I remember having a long
conversation on the phone with my sister in NYC giving her the most
recent update on Allen&#8217;s behavior. I quoted his mother, Irene as
saying, my Allen is such a &#8220;gut a ne shimer&#8221;&nbsp; Yiddish, meaning my
Allen is such a good soul.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the phone call I sat
quietly thinking about my situation when form behind me I heard a
unique sound like a cigarette lighter flick in a sucking sound.
Turning, I see an oval amber orb float 5&#8217; in the air right pass me
across the living room and out the pair of opened French doors in a
serpentine fashion. The entire event lasted 7-10 seconds.&nbsp; I sat
there with my mouth wide open and in disbelief.&nbsp; Later that week I
went for a reading at the metaphysical shop with a well respected
medium. Dikki-Joe. Without telling her a thing, she told me the orb was
my Mother-in-law. That Irene was showing her an apron around her neck.
I knew that it was Irene because she had the shingles, they were so
painful to the touch, that the only thing she could wear was an apron
around her neck! <br>
Irene told her, she was angry at both Allen and I, very disappointed
and that she never saw this divorce coming. It was totally unexpected.
The marriage had become terribly materialistic and that she was
particularly upset with her son. And that she was very worried about
me. That I must forget the marriage and move forward with my life! All
these things were so true and it helped to give me a new start.<br>

Labady Mansion<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sweetestgirl1994@aol.com<br>
<br>
The labady mansion is actually located just outside of Copan not
Bartlesville. While the Copan locals all <br>
know about it many have their own stories and are usually more than
willing to share them. I visited the <br>
Labady house 2 times once at night and once during the day and both
trips were uneventful. My <br>
stepfather went with a group of friends in highschool to the labady
house and by then his friends were <br>
very drunk. They went to the labady family cemetery down the road from
the house. When they arrived <br>
there a femur bone was lieing on the outside of the first set of gates.
One of his friends saw the bone <br>
and picked it up and proceded to throw it off into the field. Soon
after his friend threw the bone a growl <br>
began to come from the woods to the left side of the cemetery. Needless
to say they all sprinted to their <br>
car and got out of there as soon as they could. When a few friends and
i visited the cemetery we took <br>
evps and the session was reletivaly quiet, but when we went over the
recordings we heard a cackling <br>
after my friend asked the presence if the local legend of Catman was
true. <br>
If one is to go to the Labady house they should be extremely
respectful, because it is indian land and a <br>
family lives around a hundred yards down hill from the house<br>
