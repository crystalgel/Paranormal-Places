<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Twenty
Years Ago</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Anonymous</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My
story took place&nbsp; almost twenty years
ago. My husband and i bought an old house on the grounds of old
highland
plantation that burned in the early 1900's. Strange things began to
happen soon
after we moved in. Tv would change channels, water would run, objects
would be
moved. Pots and pans banged in an empty kitchen. My daughter was ten
months old
at the time. Being the granddaughter of 2 baptist preachers, i opened a
bible
and it seemed to die down. When my daughter was 2 we were taking a bath
and i
heard a mans voice. I called out to my husband thinking he had made it
home
from work. My 2 year old daughter tells me.. "thats not daddy. Thats
choppy."&nbsp; i asked who is
choppy?&nbsp; She replied..the man that lives
behind the tv. I begin to question her and she said he was nice and was
her
friend. About a week later we were riding down the road and she began
to talk
about choppy again. She told me she loved choppy. She said "choppy was
a
save but he got out!" i said.. Ashley, did you say slave? She said uh
huh.. I said is choppy a white man or a black man? She said he is a
black man.
When my two year old said the word slave, oh my god i almost wrecked. I
knew
she had never heard that word! I have since divorced and left my ex
husband
live happily ever after with choppy!&nbsp;&nbsp; </big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>A
Terrifying Night</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I
have never had any experiences with "beings" in my house, and I was
never a believer in such stories until it happened to me.&nbsp; One
night, I was awakened by something
touching my leg that was hanging over the bed.&nbsp;
I tried to pull my leg away, but could not move it one inch.&nbsp; I
immediately woke up to get out of this
horrible nightmare only to find that my leg was still being touched.&nbsp;
I tried to scream for my husband who was
right next to me but was instantly told by something at the foot of my
bed that
he would not help me, no matter how hard I yelled. There were 3-4
beings in my
room by now and they were cloaked in black with no faces.&nbsp; They
came in and out of our window.&nbsp; They laughed at me, they touched
me, they
slowly pulled the covers off of my starting at the foot of the bed and
then I
felt tremendous pressure on me like someone was sitting on me.&nbsp;
This whole thing continued throughout the
night, I was paralyzed, with enormous pressure on me all night long.&nbsp;
I screamed and screamed, I was soaking wet,
even my hair and I was hoarse with yelling.&nbsp;
It was not until the light of morning came trickling through the window
that they left, as quick as they came.&nbsp; I
could move. I screamed at my husband and he jumped up.&nbsp; He looked
at me with total shocked eyes.&nbsp; I was a mess, soaking wet hair,
swollen eyes
from crying, and totally exhausted.&nbsp; I
asked him why he did not help me and he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"I heard you groaning and thrashing so I woke up and looked at
you......I thought you were dreaming, so I let you sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
was furious, but then I remembered one of
the "beings" told me to stop yelling because even if he heard you, he
would look at you and think you were dreaming".&nbsp; I would not sleep
in my bed for a few days,
and when I did, I had to switch sides with my husband.&nbsp; I have
never been so scared in my life.&nbsp; It haunts me to this day.&nbsp;
I have not had anything since.&nbsp; </big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>A
Very True Story</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
wind.shock@yahoo.com&nbsp; </big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The
day before DisneylandI'm going to try and make this short. While I was
in high
school I belonged to the Granger high school concert choir of 1980. I
had many
friends that I grew up with were who were also in the choir. We had
just had
the time of our lives, spending two weeks touring Utah, Arizona,Nevada,
and
California. We had arrived in Anaheim California late one night, with
three
days left to go before going home. I had the pleasure of having the
company of
a very good friend at the time, his name was Earl. Earl and I had been
bunk
mates, and we had just spent two weeks spending time with the sponsor
family's
that we stayed with throughout the trip. Late that night we arrived at
this
Church House, even though it was late, there stood the Families waiting
for us.
Earl and I were chosen to go with a bigger group of guys, that was cool
by us. A
returned Missionary, whose family were gone on their vacation, took us
into
their house to spend the next two days. Me and Earl would talk about
this
later, that after the first day there something changed with the
feeling of the
house. When the both of us slept it was in a converted garage made to
be
another living room, and we both felt this eerie feeling, that we did
not want
to stay in that room this night, but we put it in the back of our minds
and
forgot about it.We went and sang our show, and after our group went to
the
movies, we saw Stir Crazy and Blazing Saddles, Two very funny movies.
After,
everyone was in high spirits, the show went well, the movies were
great, now we
had the rest of the night to just hang out it was 7:00 PM in the
evening of the
day before Disneyland. After we got settled the Missionary and a couple
other
guys said they were tired and were going to go to sleep, we looked at
them like
they were crazy, it was only 7:30 pm. We started to play cards and talk
about
scary movies. My friend Mike says he's getting a headache and gets up
to go to
his luggage in the other room to get aspirin, the garage room. After
about 30
sec. Mike shows back up and he's as pale as can be, then he says, guys
I think
there is something wrong with that room.. Earl and I looked at each
other and
then we all looked back towards the dining room table and the kitchen,
were we
saw a huge shadow come through the kitchen and into the dining room and
wrapped
itself around the table and the dining light. All of a sudden the guys
had this
idea to start praying. Once again I looked at Earl and we both got this
bad
feeling that we were going to piss off whatever it was but we said
nothing and
bowed our heads. As soon as we closed our eyes I felt the sting of ice
fingers
pressing on my shoulders, I couldn't move or open my eyes. The guy
saying the
prayer could not speak, finally I was able to open my eyes and
everything was
still the same. It was still there. The guys in another great idea
decided to
start praying again, Earl and I kept our eyes open this time. There
were two
household cats, one was asleep under the table, but the other one was
sitting
bolt upright looking at the both of us, and then we heard something say
HOW
DARE YOU. Well needless to say Me and Earl were on our feet running
from the
house, the other guys followed. We stood there in the front yard and
started
talking about it and eventually decided to go back in. Everything was
back to
normal. Me and Earl decided we were going to sleep with the other guys
tonight
but we needed to go and get some blankets in the other room, so I
volunteered
to go get them. Earl followed a little but stopped short of the
kitchen, as I continued
to the door to the other room I noticed the cats were back to normal
and were
acting hungry but as soon as I opened that door the cat's hissed and
ran from
the kitchen. As I looked into the room the light was on and it seemed
really
bright, as I stepped into the room I felt instantly cold, but I focused
on the
blankets and walked to them, picked them up, and as soon as I turned
around to
leave I was once again frozen and could not move. As I was looking
toward the
kitchen I saw Earl standing in the doorway waving at me yelling for me
to get
the hell out of there. All I could do was stand there and as I did so I
saw
great huffs of cold breath shooting over my shoulder, something was
right
behind me. I saw Earls eyes get really big and he started waving at me
again, I
finally was able to move and ran for the door and literally dove
through the
it, whatever it was? Was on my tail until I hit the door. Earl and I
never said
a word to the other guys about that. The next morning the missionary
and the other
guys who went to sleep early were normal, they never heard a sound, I
don't
think it was supposed to happen to them.Disneyland was a drag, most of
the good
rides were closed. And we sang a very bad show.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Ghost
at Dad's House</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>One
day I was sleeping over my Dad's house.&nbsp;
I could not go to sleep.&nbsp; Everyone
in the house was asleep.&nbsp; Next thing you
know, it sounded like someone was walking heavily down the hallway.&nbsp;
Then I was staring towards the hallway and it
looked like someone came out of the hallway and ran across the opening
between
the hallway and the kitchen. When the ghost got into the kitchen it
walked
heavily in the kitchen, opened the basement door, slammed it and walked
heavily
down the stairs and started coughing.&nbsp; The
history about my Dad's house is about a guy named Gavin who went
downstairs to
do laundry.&nbsp; Gavin had a heart attack and
died right in the middle of the basement. The coughing in the basement
is most
likely him dieing right there in the basement, and the sound of the
banging is
probably him trying to get someone's attention.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>This
happened a couple of months back. I have not seen the spirit, but I did
hear
its voice. I was babysitting and had two little kids in the room with
me. We
were playing "This little piggy went to market." I was playing with
the youngest one, and as I was reciting the childhood rhyme from years
before,
I heard a childish voice imitating me. I asked my sister, who was
babysitting
with me, if she had been playing with me. She said that she hadn't. I
knew it
couldn't have been the kids we were watching, because the two older
ones were
in the living room watching a movie. And the voice didn't sound like
two kids I
was playing with. But it has only happened once. It seems kind of
weird, but I
have heard voices like that before, so I'm not really surprised.&nbsp; </big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Haunted
House</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
c.rodgers290@yahoo.com</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>This
house has been in the family for several years. All I know is that when
I was a
child growing up in this house several weird and unusual things
happened.&nbsp; You could hear heavy footsteps of someone
walking around up in the attic. (My mom told me that this was her
grandfather.)
You would hear men playing pool in the cellar - you would hear men
talking and
pool balls cracking on the table. ( My uncle brought home a pool table
for us
to play pool) I believe that the pool table is no longer in the house.
The
second floor everything would rattle like there was an earthquake.
(this was
very scary) My Dad could smell the heavy scent of women's perfume. My
bed used
to shake. ( I used to yell to my parents stop shaking the bed, they
weren't in
the room) I am sure that there is many other things that have happened.
This
house to me growing up was very scary. I now see that it is on the
market and I
wouldn't purchase this home ever.&nbsp; I
recall my parents telling me that the house isn't haunted or there is
nothing
there. Not until recently they have told me that YES, everything that
you
complained about it true -----all the noises.</big></big></p>

jbullard@gibraltar1.com</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I
believe I wasn&#8217;t so much haunted by 1 spirit but many in a house.&nbsp;
15 years ago we lived in a house that was
built in the late 1800&#8217;s and was owned by a doctor that passed before
we bought
it.&nbsp; During the remodeling we found many
notes and old magazines that showed the house&#8217;s age on the walls.&nbsp;
I am unsure of how many times I saw the
spirits.&nbsp; Some were rather frightening.&nbsp; A homeless man
peering down at me or a shadow
man motionlessly watching me at the end of the bed were the more
frightening
encounters.&nbsp; Some were comforting like a
being of light that would float above shelving next to my bed.&nbsp;
There were many times my family would
experience frightening dreams that were quite similar in nature.&nbsp;
I haven&#8217;t experienced any phenomenon since
and now live in a house where the man died.&nbsp;
I still haven&#8217;t experienced anything more than regular old house
sounds.&nbsp; Thank you for listening!</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My
In-Laws Creepy House</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
dee.rae@hotmail.com</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Hi,
I'm Deanna, sending in stories, this time they happened to me and my in
laws.
This has taken place at my mother in laws in Saskatchewan, Canada. All
these
stories happened at my boyfriend's mom's house. Which is in a wooded
area.
Story 1: This was when me and my boyfriend have started dating (Fall
2006), and
this was around midnight. I was hungry, and asked my bf to get me
something to
eat. So he went upstairs while I waited downstairs in his room. Before
he left,
I asked him to close the door, because I always have this weird feeling
of
someone staring at me. Anyways, he's been up there awhile, I guess he
was
making me noodles lol. I was on my cell texting my friends, sitting on
the bed.
All of a sudden I hear shuffling on the other side of the door, like
someone
throwing clothes around. I shrugged it off and figured it was my mother
in law
sorting out the laundry. But then I thought "why would she be doing
laundry at this time of night?". I turned the TV to mute, and listened
for
awhile. I still kept hearing this noise, and I kept telling myself
"it's
probably somebody, you're just hearing things". Then the noise got
louder,
and this time I heard what sounded like scratching on the door in one
long
stroke. I was like "holy crap", my heart kept beating really fast. I
looked down to see if there was a shadow, and sure enough, there was.
:O Oh my
god, I couldn't believe my eyes, I kept thinking "is this really
happening?". Then I heard footsteps coming down the stairs, as soon as
the
footsteps got closer to the bottom, that shadow moved away from the
door. Here
my bf opened the door, and I said in a scared tone "is your mom or
anybody
else down here?", and he said "no, why?". I then told him what
had happened to me, and he told me that everyone was already sleeping
when he
got up there. Story 2: Every time we stop by to visit my in laws, they
always
have a story for us to hear. She told us stories like, one night she
was
sleeping with her daughter in her room. She got up for no apparent
reason, she
looked towards the closet and she seen a dark shadow, which looked like
a very
tall man, she said it must have been at least 7' tall. She thought it
was just
her being tired, or it must have been a dream, but she realized it was
real.
That shadow looked like it was staring at her. She was really scared,
then
turned to her left side, and not taking her eyes off of this thing. It
then
moved towards the door, made it's way down the hallway, then just like
that, it
was gone. That was all she had seen that night. No noise. She then
asked my
father in law the next morning if anyone came into her room, or if
anyone was
up. He then said "I was sleeping, I didn't go to your room". She had
asked everyone in the house the same thing, but nope, everyone was fast
asleep.
Story 3: Here is another story my mother in law told us. One night, my
father
in law went sleep downstairs in the big open area, because it was hot
upstairs.
This was during this past summer '09. As he was laying down in bed, he
had just
fell asleep, when out of nowhere he heard what sounded like loud foot
steps on
the stairs. He looked around, while laying in bed, he looked towards
the
stairwell, when he saw a lady's head peeking towards him behind the
wall of the
stairwell. He got really scared, but then thought "maybe it's Melina
(my mother
in law) trying to scare me". He then tried to go back to bed, but he
had
this feeling of being watched, when he looked back to the same place,
he then
saw that same woman again, this time she moved her head back as if it
were
trying not to get seen. He freaked out, looked away, then looked back,
she was
there again. Finally he got fed up, he got up from the bed went to the
stairs,
but nobody was there. If someone was there, he would have heard
footsteps
running away. He found it odd, so then he went upstairs and he seen
that lady
(all in white) walk towards my mother in law's room. He thought it was
her, but
when he got in her room, she was out like a light. He woke my mother in
law up,
and asked why she was downstairs looking at him, she replied "what are
you
talking about? I was sleeping this whole time". He then freaked out,
because my mother in law was wearing a red shirt, and grey shorts. This
woman
he had seen was wearing white, like a night gown. It would be
impossible for
someone to get changed that quick, when he was following this thing not
even 3
seconds behind it. This doesn't stop there. Story 4: This happened
either in
the fall or winter, I don't remember, but it was last year '08. My in
laws dog
had given birth to 9 puppies, and my bf's little sister was always
outside
playing with the little pups. One day she was outside in front of the
house,
playing around with the puppies, she was petting them and whatnot. She
was
telling the puppies of how cute they were. Then right behind her, she
heard a little
girl say "aww, those puppies are real cute". She didn't recognize the
voice, so she looked back and nobody was with her. She got really
scared, then
went running inside to tell her mom. Her mom told her nobody was
outside or
visiting. Story 5: My boyfriend was visiting his parents, and I stayed
back
home. There were 5 of them playing texas hold 'em one night, back in
Winter
2007. It was around 2 in the morning, they were all having a good time,
when my
bf's little brother came to my mother in law complaining of a tooth
ache, so
then she went to his room and comforted him. My bf happened to glance
towards
the hallway and looked back at his cards, when he saw at the corner of
his eye
a tall shadow walking to the living room. He didn't think much of it,
he
thought it was his dad, but then he remembered that he was sleeping in
the
other room. He freaked out, and asked his relatives if they saw it, but
they
said no. About 10 minutes after that happened, his relatives went home
because
my bf freaked them out. Then he later went to his room and fell asleep.
The
next morning he was talking to his mom, she then asked if he came
upstairs
later that night, and he said "no, why?", and then she replied
"I saw a tall shadow standing at my door looking at me". After she
told my bf that, he freaked out, he then told her what he had seen the
night
before. Story 6: Sorry for taking so much space, but these all occured
at the
same house and I wanted to share these with you. [January 2007] My
sister
started going out with my bf's best friend, and they both slept over at
my bf's
house. I was back at home. This was after midnight, when my bf and
brother in
law were playing game when they were interrupted by what sounded like
the couch
upstairs move. They paused the game, and then went upstairs to
investigate.
They then found out everyone was sleeping, and the loveseat looks like
it was
moved. Because it was facing the TV(which was south east) before they
went
downstairs earlier, and when they saw it, it was facing directly south.
They
freaked out, goosebumps and all. During this time, my sister was
downstairs in
my bf's room (which is below the living room). When out of the blue she
woke
up, and looked towards the tv and saw my bf playing game, then asked
him
"where's ron(my brother in law)??", then he said "just go back
to sleep" in a mean tone. She found it weird because why would her
brother
in law talk like that towards her. She faced the wall, and started
panicing,
because she knew it wasn't him. She then looked back and it was gone.
(keep in
mind, this happened to my sister when my bf and brother in law were
upstairs
investigating the sound). Then my bf ran downstairs to find my sister
crying,
he asked what was wrong, and then she told him. They went upstairs, and
all
talked about what had happened. My sister was freaked out the most,
because she
could have sworn she had seen my bf.(my sister has a gift, but I won't
get into
details, that's another story). This still gives me the creeps to this
day.
Story 7: My bf's little brother Brayden aka BJ (who is 7 by the way),
always
tells my mother in law that he always sees a little boy in the basement
around
the age of 4 or 5 who wants to play with him. This happened at least 7
or more
times. My bf also seen this little person while me and him were
cleaning the
basement for his mom. Also his little sister has seen it a few times.
This is
the freaky part, one night we slept over at the same house, in my bf's
old
room. He had a dream about a little boy coming into the room,crying,
with his
arms open, coming towards him. My bf described him having short black
hair, no
shoes on, old style pants that was worn out, either a gray or white t
shirt,
and in his dream, this boy had the creepiest eyes, which were all
black. This
is creepy. My bf then described of how this boy looked like to BJ, and
BJ said
"yeah, that's how that boy looks. The one I see". ugh, gives me the
creeps. We (as in me, my bf, and brother) slept over at my in laws one
weekend.
We thought it would be a cool idea to try some EVP's in the room we
were in,
and leave a video camera out in the big open area of the basement. We
didn't
think we would catch anything, but when we reviewed the tape, we heard
someone
talking in the background with us in the room. This freaked us out,
because we
were telling scary stories, and everyone else was quiet except for the
one
telling the story, but we couldn't make out the voice that was talking
in the
background. It was neither of us. We found some orbs on the video tape,
and
heard thumping noises upstairs, like someone banging their feet on the
floor.
We didn't hear this when we were in the room, and everyone else was
sleeping
upstairs. We were all scared sh*tless when we heard all of this.&nbsp;
Story 8: Last one I promise. My bf was
babysitting his siblings, and they had visitors over that evening. This
must
have been around 9 pm. He was in his room in the basement, watching a
movie. He
heard little kids laughing and whispering like they were beside the
other side
of the door. He looked at the bottom of the door, and saw shadows of
people
standing there. He didn't think much of it, he thought it was his
sister and
her friends fooling around. Then he told them to leave him alone, and
to go
upstairs, when all of a sudden he heard 2 loud blows to the door. He
got fed
up, and then went running to open his door, when he opened it, it
sounded like
footsteps running upstairs. He then went upstairs to ask the girls why
they
were bothering him, and banging on his door. Then they told him they've
been
upstairs in the room playing dolls the whole time. He noticed the
serious look
on their faces, and knew he experienced something out of the ordinary.
This
freaked him out big time. Wouldn't you be scared if you thought your
little
sister and her friends were bugging you, when they've been upstairs the
whole
time? Thanks for taking the time in reading this. These are only little
of the
stories of what has happened here.&nbsp; </big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Back
in 77 after my parents divorced my sister &amp; I&nbsp; along with our
mum moved into a large 2
bedroom apartment. Now my sister &amp; I shared the bedroom. On a few
occasions
I had seen people in my bedroom @ night when everyone else was asleep.
I
remember one night I had trouble sleeping so my sister let me sleep in
her
bed,however on this night I couldn't fall asleep as I laying in bed
awake a man
was kneeling @ the side of the bed where I was laying. He had long
black hair
with face painted white with black &amp; red stripes on his cheeks
wearing a
black cloak made out of silk. Now he was solid and I didn't know who or
what he
was I was only 3 but I knew in my mind that he wasn't supposed to be in
our
room. Well he appeared multiple times that night but the weird thing
was he
kept touching my stomach with his finger. this whole time I am trying
to wake
my sister up but she's in a deep sleep, finally I gave up &amp; ran out
and&nbsp; into my mums room and she insisted I
had a nightmare but let me sleep in her room. The next experience was
when I
was the only one awake as I stayed in bed playing with my stuffed
animals late
@ night. As I was playing with my stuffed animals I saw a woman in a
wedding
like dress walking into our room, now she looked over @ my sister as
she was in
the doorway then when our eyes met she had a look of shock that I was
able to
see her. I remember dropping my woody woodpecker doll on the floor as I
went to
reach for it she was nearly @ the foot of my bed,so I put the covers
over my
head. I remember her tugging the sheets gently to get my attention,
finally I
screamed , after that she looked confused &amp; proceeded to walk
towards the
doorway watching me the entire time till she walked out the door.&nbsp;
The last experience actually happened while I
was alone in the apartment which I was only 4 @ the time. I was in my
mums
bedroom sitting on her bed &amp; this time it was during the day. As I
looked
in the direction of the doorway I saw a woman standing there watching
me. I
remember her wearing a green sweater &amp; a long black dress. For some
strange
reason I remember having a box of aluminum foil by my side which I used
to hide
my eyes, hoping the woman would be gone, but when I moved the box away
from my
eyes she was still there but slowly walking into the room. Out of fear,
I threw
the box @ her, which pissed her off cause she grabbed&nbsp; &amp;
slammed it down on the nightstand,
letting out an angry grunt.. Now mums bedroom door was a swinging door
which
entered the kitchen, as I went to open the door there was a tall man&nbsp;
with curly black hair&nbsp; standing there trying to put the hook into
the whole to lock me in which he didn't succeed. The lady went to reach
out for
me &amp; I remember running into my bedroom and climbing out the window
&amp;
ran into the corner store in which was the front of our building.&nbsp;
We moved out of the apartment when I was 5.
Even after 30 yrs I still remember everything as if it were just an
hour ago.</big></big></p>

Story</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
llovingjulie@aol.com</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>It
was a rainy November day , Bored and depressed.Grey raining days always
affected my moods. My husband&nbsp; asked me
if I wanted to go for a drive in the country, I&nbsp;
never really liked going anywhere when&nbsp;
it was&nbsp; raining, but today I felt
I needed to get out, maybe this would get me out of my grey mood. I got
my
camera ready, hoping to get some nice photos of&nbsp;
the mountains .As my husband was driving , I imagined that we were on
our way to Nashville- or maybe to my sisters in Arkansas&#8230;.I have really
been
missing those days when we use to go out of town for the weekend&#8230; seems
like
these days we don&#8217;t ever do anything by ourselves anymore&#8230; 2 hours into
the
drive- I asked my husband if he would pull over somewhere so I could
smoke a
cigarette- since he is a non-smoker, I don't like him breathing my
cigarette
smoke. He&nbsp; got off the highway and&nbsp; pulled up in front of a
civil war cemetery..
I lit my cigarette and we started walking inside the cemetery, I&#8217;ve
always
liked reading the names on the tombstones, I thought Chris was by me,
he
wasn&#8217;t,&nbsp; he was about 5 tombstones away
from me, He looked as though he was spaced out or something, talking to
someone
, but I didn&#8217;t see anyone there&nbsp; with
him. I walked up to where he was&nbsp; and
called his name- but he didn&#8217;t even hear me&nbsp;
and I was&#8217;nt that far from him&#8230; &#8220;Hey&#8221; I yelled out to him, &#8220;I have been
calling you-&#8220; &#8220;What is wrong?&#8221;&nbsp; he was
touching his head, saying that it hurt really bad, I started taking
pictures of
him- He usually doesn&#8217;t like me doing that- but&nbsp;
this time he didn&#8217;t get mad, or say anything about me taking his
picture. I thought to myself&#8217;This isn&#8217;t like him&#8221;He was still being&nbsp;
quiet and in a daze, then suddenly he snapped
out of it&nbsp; and told me that he felt like
something went inside of his body&#8230; he said&nbsp;
his head starting hurting really bad, and that he felt a lot of anger&#8230;.
I told him that we had better leave and get back on the road&#8230;. As he
was
driving&nbsp; I kept thinking about what had
just happened at the cemetery, It really scared me- I never saw him act
that
way before&#8230;..We finally got to the blue ridge mountains, and they were
as
beautiful as ever- The trees&nbsp; still had
their fall color, and the mountains looked like they were on fire-&nbsp;
I was so glad that my husband suggested we go
on this trip. We hung around there enjoying the view and breathing in
the fresh
mountain air, I didn&#8217;t want to go back home, But we had to, since it
was Sunday
and tomorrow was back to work&#8230;..I took a lot of pictures&nbsp; on the
way up there and back, I couldn&#8217;t wait
to upload the pictures to our computer when we got back home&#8230; We were
almost
home, and I thanked&nbsp; Chris for taking me
to the mountains&#8230;.. We got to the house, and I went up stairs to load
the
pictures up&#8230;&#8230;What I caught on my camera, totally shocked me , I
couldn&#8217;t
believe what I was looking at.!!- To me it looked like a man with a dog
by it's
head&nbsp; and the man carrying something... I
have tried to edit the picture&nbsp; but
couldn't, anyway I t ook a few more this is the only one I have&nbsp;
at my work computer the rest are at home .
The other one was&nbsp; of a man with a big
mustache&nbsp; looked like a civil war soldier
with his cap&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; a horse. It is weird!!&nbsp; My
husband&nbsp;
has this gift&nbsp; that when he is
around&nbsp; some places&nbsp; like&nbsp;
cemetaries or&nbsp; other places&nbsp; he can feel&nbsp;
things and have a ghost spirit get inside of him..&nbsp; My story "
November day is made up- We
were really at Loretta Lynns Ranch in Hurrican Mills Tennesee when this
happened ....&nbsp; I hae lots more pictures
that i took at her ranch , which&nbsp; is
haunted ....&nbsp;&nbsp; </big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Of
Demons and Werewolves</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
andrewwallentine@yahoo.com&nbsp;&nbsp; </big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I
actually have a lot of stories to tell pertaining to the paranormal. I
might as
well start with my first experience with what I can only describe as
"demons." At the time I was 16 years old and I had went to live with
my father (my parents are divorced) after living with my mother for
most of my
life. My father lived on an old hay farm, with about 4 families
(including my
own) living in the area. It was Autumn when it occurred, at around 4 or
5 pm. I
was taking a walk down the dirt road from where I was living, to a
house my
father had started building 15 years ago, but never finished. The
unfinished
house was where I kept my weights for working out and such. I stayed
for about
an hour working out, until it started to get dark. I decided it was
about time I
went back home, so I put away the weights and went outside. There was a
nice
breeze outside so I stopped and stood for a second enjoying it. That's
when I
heard a noise to my left, coming from inside the woods. (I guess this
would be
a good time to mention that the farm had a lot of trees that surrounded
most of
the area, a small forest if you will) It sounded like something
swinging, back
and forth slowly. I didn't pay much heed to it, I just decided to start
walking
home. Not more than a minute of walking, an eerie feeling came over me,
as if I
was being watched, or followed. I looked around and saw nothing out of
the
ordinary, except I noticed the swinging noise once again, but in a
different
spot. I suddenly found myself afraid, for a reason at the time I
couldn't
explain. I started walking faster, my breathing quickened with the fear
that
gripped me. Suddenly, an image came into my mind so very clear, almost
real. I
saw a figure hanging by its neck from a tree. The figure was covered in
bandages, between the gaps of the bandages was discolored skin covered
in
gashes. One of it's "eyes" was not covered by the bandages, it was
totally black. It only seemed like a second that the image came into my
mind,
yet the second my attention strayed from the image, I suddenly found
myself
running as fast as I could in the woods. I stopped and looked around,
still
quite freaked out. While trying to determine exactly where I was, I
noticed the
sound again. From somewhere in the woods, the sound of swinging echoed
around
the trees. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. The image came
to mind
again, a ghastly figure hanging from a tree, and the sound of swinging.
What I
heard next made my heart sink. I heard a thump, like something fell to
the
ground. I froze, until I heard what sounded like feet sliding through
the
fallen leaves. At that point, I believe I screamed, before running in
the
direction I believed-- I hoped-- my house was. As I ran, I could hear
the steps
become faster behind me. I wasn't about to look behind me, but while
running, I
had this dreadful feeling that whatever was chasing me was catching up.
I'm not
sure how long I was running for, but at one point I noticed the sound
of
running was gone. Needless to say, I didn't stop running. That is,
until I saw
something ahead of me. I came face to face with the figure in the
image,
hanging by a tree. From what I remember it didn't move, but I sure did.
At that
point I was too scared to even scream, I just kept running. From where
I was,
it didn't take me long to get home. Let me tell you though, I did not
stop
running when I came to my house, or even once I got inside. I said
nothing to
my father or grandmother, I ran straight into my room and stayed there
for the
remainder of the night. The second incident I will write happened much
more
recently, I believe it was 3 months ago (I am currently 20) or around
it. That
day I went to visit my best friend who lives at the border of my town
and the
next one over. We made plans to do what we have been doing for quite
some time
now, "demon hunting." Both of us have been quite "aware" as
we like to call it, of paranormal activity. After the episode I
described
above, somewhat similar incidents began occurring more frequently. Now
I
imagine that such things didn't just start happening more, but that I
had just
become more aware of them, and in turn, they became more aware of me.
Anyway,
to the story. My friend and I hung out til nightfall, then we went for
a walk
down the dark and empty streets nearby. We had done this plenty of
times
before, we would usually see what people call "shadow people/beings",
which have been a pretty common sighting for me for about 3 years.
Aside from
them, we also would see other kinds of apparitions along the roads at
night.
Sometimes we'd he noises, such as one night, when we heard what sounded
like a
cross between a crow and dog, crow-howl in the distance about three
times, and
other strange things. This night was different though. We made our
rounds,
visiting the most active places, yet we saw nor heard anything unusual.
We were
a little disappointed, so we started heading back to his place. About a
half
mile from his house we heard what we thought was a coyote in the
distance,
maybe a mile away in the direction of a patch of woods. Coyotes are
quite
common around that area, as we have had more than one run in with them.
We
stopped to listen, hoping we wouldn't have to come across a pack of
coyotes.
However, what we heard didn't exactly sound like coyotes. We did hear
howling,
though knowing how coyotes sound, along with all the yips and other
noises they
make, we noticed they didn't really sound much like coyotes. My friend
and I,
being quite fond of wolves, fancied us the thought that the howls might
be from
wolves, and not coyotes. With a little discussion, and no thinking
whatsoever,
we decided it'd be cool to howl back. Smart thinking, right? I was the
first
one to do so, followed my my friend doing his best howl. Immediately we
were
answered by a howl in the distance, which excited us a little. Then
came
another howl, and another. We quickly noticed that the howling became
more
frequent, as well as louder. Soon our excitement turned to nervousness
at the
thought that they might be coming after us, as if we just issued some
sort of
challenge. We looked to each other, silently deciding to continue
walking.
Before we took too many steps though, we heard a howl that made us
freeze.
Among the many howls rose one that sounded 10 times louder than the
rest. It
was a deep yet piercing howl, one that filled our very souls with
dread. That
single howl must have lasted for a full 30 seconds. I can only explain
it by
saying that it is probably the closest thing to what a werewolf might
sound
like if it howled. We just stood there in complete fear, shaking and
speechless, all from a single howl. A paralyzing howl that sounded
otherworldly, perhaps demonic. Coming to our senses, we wasted no time
and
began sprinting toward my friend's house. It wasn't long though before
the
howls sounded close, too close. We could even hear paws racing through
the
grass. While running we came to a house, and were going to run past it,
but for
some reason my body wouldn't allow me to keep going, I was frozen at
that
house. The next howl brought us to realize that they were just behind
that
house. Fear had a tight grip on us, but I managed to run over to the
house, and
began banging on it wildly. Two men cam out, asking why there was
banging on
their door at such an hour. Shaking and studdering, we explained
ourselves to them.
To our surprise, they didn't label us crazy, in fact, they told us they
had
heard a dreadful shriek come from the woods one one or two occasions
before,
though it didn't seem like it was what we heard. If they heard what we
did they
probably would have moved away. While my friend talked to them, I
realized that
I had heard nothing since the two men came out. I looked all around and
saw
nothing, didn't even hear a low growl. I wondered if they could be
lying in
wait. About that time the two men offered us a ride to my friend's
house, which
we accepted, quite relieved. We both looked around as they drove us to
my
friend's place, though we saw nothing. It didn't take long to get
there, and we
thanked them as they drove off. We both sighed in relief as we walked
to his
front door. That is, until we heard the howls suddenly pick up again,
not even
15 seconds after the two men had driven off. That followed us! My heart
nearly
pounded right through my chest as we dashed to the door. Because we
expected to
stay out all night, his mother had locked the door for the night. He
didn't
have a spare key at the time, so we began banging on the door and
yelling. With
not much time to spare, his mother came and opened the door, yelling at
us for
making such a racket. We payed her little attention and ran into the
house,
shutting the door and locking it. We explained to his mother, who
didn't
totally believe us, but seeing us shake like we were, she didn't
dismiss our
story either. She told us to get some rest and went back to bed, but we
weren't
going to get any sleep that night. We stayed up, watching the windows,
fearing
that any second something might come crashing through. Luckily for us
nothing
did. Though, at one point I saw a large gray blur dart between the two
vehicles
outside.&nbsp; The next morning, after the sun
had been up for a while, we decided it's be safe to go outside. We
looked all
around the area for tracks of our pursuers. Tracks we found, canine paw
prints,
much larger than what would come from a wolf or coyote. The prints were
about
the size of an open hand. It was around this time that we truly
realized
exactly how lucky we were to be alive. We still remember that night, as
vividly
as when we experienced it, along with that ungodly, paralyzing howl.
These are
the two most frightening stories I have to tell, though there are many,
many
more. In case you were wondering, I live in the state of Maine. My
friend and I
see and feel both what we call spirits and demons often, and keep each
other
posted on such matters. From what we've noticed, such occurrences are
happening
more and more. Whether this is because we're just become more aware, or
if this
means something is happening, we do not know. I just thought I'd share
some of
what I've seen with you all. Believe it or deny it, that is up to you,
though I
swear both stories are true. And to follow up on the first story, the
demon I
encountered still resides in my woods, though it seems to be unable to
leave
them. Now and then if I'm near the woods at night, I can hear it
swinging,
sometimes it moves and swings in a different spot. My friend has also
heard and
felt its presence, and we both believe that it cannot take form, but
creates
images and sounds in order to frighten victims and steal energy. I
would go
into detail about "energy", or what people might call ki/chakra, but
that's a story for another time, and perhaps even less believable than
what I
have just posted. Anyway, if you have any questions or anything, feel
free to
e-mail me. </big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[jlreed5909@aol.com</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The
house my husband and I live in now has been in the family for many
years, close
to 70.&nbsp; It was built in 1903, and we
don't know anything about who lived in the house before my family. The
house,
it goes without saying, needs a lot of TLC and has had many updates
over the
years and it is big with four huge bedrooms that we keep shut off. I
got
married in May of this year, the recession caused my husband to be out
of work
and had to move out of our home, so we were forced to move into this
old house.
It sat empty for 3 years before we moved in.&nbsp;
At first, we only heard music playing.&nbsp;
Old, country music.&nbsp; It seems to
play at random times with no particular schedule and it always seems to
come
out of our dining room..&nbsp; My great
grandmother died in the dining room in the 70's unexpectedly before I
was born,
but from what I hear about her, this spirit (or spirits) doesn't feel
like
her.About a week or so ago, we decided to check out the attic to see if
there
is room up there to put in an upstairs.&nbsp; The
attic, it turns out, is as big as the entire house.&nbsp; To get to it,
you have to go in through our
bedroom closet (incidentally the only closet in the house) and climb a
wooden
ladder through a small opening.&nbsp; It is
very dark and naturally very creepy.&nbsp; I
decided to let my husband do the exploring, and I came back down to
wait in the
closet and I made an unexpected discovery, a narrow, four foot high
door to no
where..I happened to look very close at that particular section of wall
because
it looked different than the rest of the closet, and I noticed there
was a door
that had been boarded shut.&nbsp; I called my
husband down and he unboarded it, revealing nothing but a concrete wall
behind
it.&nbsp; That is creepy enough, but what
happened last night scared the crap out of me.I am a chronic insomniac,
I am
usually up late at night and very early in the morning.&nbsp; Last
night, I was sitting on the couch with
our dog and I heard what I thought was my husband walking around in the
bedroom,
which is right off of the living room.&nbsp; I
checked on him and he was asleep.&nbsp; I was
pretty uneasy but I went back and sat down, I even turned on a movie
but I
heard&nbsp; the footsteps over the
television.&nbsp; They sounded like they were
coming from the front porch this time, which is just outside the living
room
and the bedroom.&nbsp; It's a covered front
porch and the attic goes over the porch as well.&nbsp; I turned on the
porch light, and peeked out
the door, sure I would catch someone messing around out there, but
there was no
one..Again I tried to brush it off, I tried to convince myself it was a
dog but
I know that dog footsteps do NOT sound like that, even a big one.&nbsp;
This sounded like a grown man, and a heavy
one at that, slowly pacing on the porch or maybe even in the attic
above the
porch.&nbsp; I turned up the volume and tried
hard to get into the movie and I was convinced I wasn't going to hear
it again
when I did, and this time it was running.&nbsp;
Like someone was running from the other side of the porch to the window
that the couch sits in front of, then abruptly stopping.I turned the TV
off and
went to bed, and my husband told me he thought he heard someone outside
but he
figured maybe I went to walk the dog.&nbsp;
When I told him what I had heard, he checked and found no one outside,
like I knew he would.After I went to bed, I didn't hear anything else
until the
middle of the night when our dog, a 4 year old pug who is very polite
and NEVER
barks, even when someone is outside, woke us up having a barking fit.&nbsp;
I think whatever was making the footsteps
scared our dog last night.Our house seems to be having a paranormal
flare up.</big></big></p>

Family and Friends Experiences</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
dee.rae@hotmail.com</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I
have sent a story last month, and thanks for posting it. I'm going to
tell you
more personal experiences, and stories I have heard from my family and
friends.
Story 1: This has happened to my dad while he was attending a community
college
named Blue Quills, near St. Paul Alberta, Canada in January or February
1998.
Keep in mind that he was a skeptic, like I would tell him "scary"
stories, and he would ALWAYS try to debunk it. Anyways, there was this
janitor
who told my dad that he hears the piano playing in the storage room
near the
cafeteria, when he cleans up at night. My dad, did not believe him.
Until my dad
was in the cafeteria getting something to eat, out of nowhere, he heard
the
piano playing. He thought it was someone practicing. So he went to
investigate.
To his surprise, nobody was in that room. He heard no footsteps, or did
not see
anyone walk in our out of that room. He was a believer from then on.
Story 2: I
live on reservation, and like all reservations, in a wooded area. This
time, me
and my mom saw something. We were visiting my grandpas this one
afternoon, I
must have been around 14. Where my family lives, there are 4 houses
that are
walking distance. They decided to put their houses like this, closer to
each
other lol. And they're about maybe 250 yards apart from each other.
Anyway,
before I ramble on, after me and my mom were visiting my grandpa, we
were walking
to our car, and I looked over to my grandma's house. I saw my grandma,
or which
appeared to look like her, then I said "Look mom, grandmas looking at
us". So we waved at her, then she waved back. So we drove to her house,
and to our surprise, she was in her room and just got up from a nap. My
mom
then asked her "were you sleeping?", then my grandma said
"yeah", and said "why?". My mom replied "we thought we
seen you waving at us from the kitchen window", then my grandma said
"nobody else is in the house except for me and Owen (my uncle). And
Owen
is in his room taking a nap". Then I thought "What the hell were we
waving at?". ugggh, gives me the creeps. We could have sworn, we saw an
old lady with braids (like my grandma does) at the window looking at
us, then
waved back us. Gives me the creeps when I think about this. &nbsp;&nbsp;Story
3: This story took place in the place I
mentioned above (my grandpa's house). We used to live there before we
got our
new place which is 3 kms west of my grandpa's house. Anyways, this
happened
when I was about 11. I was always into recording stuff back then with
our old
cassette player. We had a basement that you can only get into from
going
outside. One afternoon, I was playing in the basement with my 4 other
cousins,
and my sister, I don't remember what we were playing, but I took the
stereo
tape recorder downstairs to play with. All of us were running around,
going to
the stereo making funny noises, then run around, and so forth. About a
week
later, I was playing the cassette tapes to see if I can re-record music
on them
or whatnot, then I came across to the tape we were playing with that
day in the
basement. I was laughing at how we sounded, and then out of the blue, I
heard a
baby crying. I honestly remember, there was definitely no baby with us
down
there when we were playing. Plus there was no baby in the house at all
at that
time. I freaked out, and kept playing it back, and then I showed my
sister. She
was pretty freaked out as well. I asked if her or any of our cousins
were
making baby noises while they were by the stereo, and she said no. I
believed
her because she stayed by the stereo the whole time. Now that's scary.
Story 4:
This happened in the same house, I was about 12 when this happened. I
was
babysitting, and had some cousins from next door visiting. There were
about 10
of us there LOL. I was babysitting my 2 younger brothers, and younger
sister
that night. My parents went out to watch a movie I think. But anyway,
my sister
was doing her homework on the kitchen table, and underneath the table
theres a
vent that leads downstairs, and you can hear anyone talking if someone
were
down there if you sit by it. This was around 10 pm. So, I was in the
living
room watching TV, then I noticed my sister aiming her head towards the
vent, as
if she were trying to hear something. Then she said "Shhhh, do you guys
hear that?". And I said "what?", she said "I hear a baby
crying". The youngest one in the house was my brother who was 2, and he
was in the living room, watching tv, and not crying. Then all of us
were
leaning towards the vent, and shockingly, we ALL did hear a baby
crying. We got
scared and started phoning someone from next door to come over. Nobody
came
over, they were busy. Then finally my parents came back, and they asked
what
was wrong, because we were crying. We told them. That's not the first
time I
heard a baby cry in that house. There's 5 people I know of that lived
there
before us, and they were our family. Not sure who lived there before
them, but
it was built almost 40 years ago. Again, I was 12, same house. This
time there
were adults with me to hear it. Back then we were so into WWF lol, we
ordered
it on PPV, and my uncles from next door came to watch. This was during
the day,
around 3 pm. As we were getting into the wrestling match, I got up to
get a
drink, and walked towards the kitchen. My mom was washing the dishes, I
stopped
halfway, I thought I heard a baby crying. I stood there to hear it
again, sure
enough, that same cry. I walked to my mom, and asked "mom, do you hear
that baby crying?", she said "you hear it too?". I was
surprised. I then walked back to the couch, I could still hear a baby
crying, I
asked my dad "do you hear that dad?", he muted the TV, and listened.
He said "check on your brother". I went check up on him, he was fast
asleep, and I could still hear that baby crying. I told my dad "he's
sleeping", and then said "what is that then?", I said "I
don't know!". So yeah, that house still gives me the heebie jeebies. My
grandpa still lives there to this day. Thanks for reading, I'll be sure
to post
more! :D </big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>&nbsp; Along a road on Long Island
,N.Y.is a small
cemetery that would have gone unnoticed if not it's paranoraml
happenings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Cemetery is Pine Hollow in a town of the
same name.&nbsp; This is a very strange place
in deed.&nbsp; I have had a few expeiences
there that tell me it is haunted but not by a bad spirit or spirits.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The first time I went looking I passed it
and went tot he end of the road , turned around and came back still not
seeing
it. I went home and went on Google and looked for info and found an
overhead
map [Google Earth] with the stores acrossthe road and all. The next
time I went
with my son and we saw a long road up a hill so we walked it, and
walked it and
walked it.&nbsp;&nbsp; We went to the end of the
road and no cemetery so we&nbsp; went back to
the car. The hill was a lot like a ski slope it was very steep so when
we got
to he car I was quite tired.&nbsp; I said I'd
go down the road a little and if not find it turn around and never come
back.&nbsp; I drove around a quarter of a mile
and suddenly I looked in my mirror and there was the entry signpost.&nbsp;
I do not know what made me look in the mirror
and if I hadn't I would have missed it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We turned and went into the front parking area , if you can cal it
that.&nbsp;&nbsp; We went inside and looked
around.&nbsp; I was looking for a specific
grave and found it so I knew I was in the right place.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nothing happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is until I looked at the many photos
I
took and found one with a strange glowing orb in it.&nbsp; I had the
sun to my back so it was not any of
the obvious kind of things it could have been.&nbsp;&nbsp;
My son walked talking to the dead as I took photos but nothing special
happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few days later I went to
find out who the 7 Civil War soldiers were.&nbsp;
I knew they were African American , or as the official files show
US&nbsp; Colored Volunteers, but wanted to
know more.&nbsp; As I entered the cemetery I
go the chills, the hair ont he back of my neck stood up and I felt I
was being
watched.&nbsp;&nbsp; I went up to the old area and
made rthe ledft turn to go to the 2 unmarked soldier's graves and as I
got
about 10 feet in I again felt the preesence and the hairs on the3 back
of my
neck stood up and again I go the feeling of being watched.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I walked a few more steps when out of the
corner of my eye I saw a man standing looking at me as if he were
already in
the cemetery but I was alone.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was
startled and looked for others.&nbsp; As I did
this he disappeared.&nbsp; I was not afraid
just startled. &nbsp;&nbsp;I took 2 more steps and
again the same feeling and again he was there.&nbsp;
About 6 foot without a head just a body wearing a jacket and cape top
cover.&nbsp; I knew the clothing as an amateur
Civil War historian it was a "greatcoat" or overcoat worn in the
Civil War.&nbsp;&nbsp; I took photos and nothng
else happened so I left.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next
weekend at around 11 AM I went back with my son.&nbsp; He was upset he
said things never happen to
him and why does all the good stuff happen to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
cemetery was quiet and very peacefulso I
took a bunch of photos and as we were going to leave I was looking
toward thw 2
unknown soldiers graves when he said " WOW did you see that"!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I asked what and he said a black round ball
fly over one of the known soldiers's grave.&nbsp;
I was looking right in line of flight of the ball but saw nothing.&nbsp;
There were no birds flying, no bugs and
certainly no one throwing a ball or a ball.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We left wondering what happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The next time I went back I was looking again at the soldiers
particularly and taking photos of the 5 known graves to look up on line
the
units etc..&nbsp; I met the caretaker fromt he
church and we&nbsp; spoke for a while.&nbsp;&nbsp; He told me thew
whole history of the
cemetery and some of the grave areas.&nbsp;
The care taker was James, for the life of me I cannot remember the last
name but he was 70 years old and an ex Marine.&nbsp;
James and I spoke for at least an hour and as we spoke I saw a cat
suddenly appear 30 years from us in the middle of the field I was
looking at.&nbsp; I took out my camera and took 2 photos one of
the cat sitting and one as he started walking.&nbsp;
The cat was jet black and took 3 steps or so and disappeared not into
the woods but gone&nbsp; It walked toward us
then vanished.&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked James if he had
anything happen to him and he said not really. &nbsp;He knew&nbsp;
a lot of the people bgurried so I asked him if he talks to them and he
said yesw.&nbsp; I asked if he heard voices
and he said slightly coyish yes.&nbsp;&nbsp; I went
home wondering what happened as I felt I knew James a long time even
though I
just met him.&nbsp; He told me the story of
the ledger of buried souls and how 26 years ago the pastor had a
nervous
breakdown and burn all the histories of the church so burial sites and
names
are lost forever and he was very interesting, had an easy way of
talking as if
he were a tour guide of sorts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
next time I went I looked up the history of the soldiers, units time
served,
rank etc..&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to each grave and
said thanks for your service, then the name and regiment etc..&nbsp;&nbsp;
As I was leaving I wnet to take a couple of
photos more.&nbsp; I went tot he gate and took
a photo through the gate but didn't like the view so I wnet to the back
near
the overgrown weeds.&nbsp; As I lowered the
camera suddenly leaves fell but they fell 10 feet or more from the
nearest
overhead branch.&nbsp; Thye fell like
confetti.&nbsp; I looked to the trees nearby,
at the level and higher.&nbsp; It was dead
still, no air movement at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went
back into the cemetery and thanked them for the show and went out to
take a
couple parting shots.&nbsp; Again the leaves
fell and again the trees from my level to the highest trees were dead
still.&nbsp; It happened like before, just as
I loweered from the first shot.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again I
went inside and then went to leave but this time just left not looking
back.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have yet to go back
but
still wonder if James was a person or soemone fromthe great beyond and
who
those 2 unknown soldiers are.&nbsp; Finding
the names is something I will try for a long time, they fought
descrimination
and a war and just lie unknown it is all so unfair</big><span
