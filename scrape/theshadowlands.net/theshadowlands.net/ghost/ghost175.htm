<b>Haunting at the Cottage</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: doug.engstrom@sympatico.ca</b>
<br><b>My friends and I were up at the cottage for a party.&nbsp; Around
dusk, three of our group went to the abandonned cottage up the road.&nbsp;
I stayed behind with my other friends.&nbsp; Later on we heard their voices.&nbsp;
We also saw a white t-shirt and went to see them.&nbsp; When we got there
there were no people.&nbsp; The we saw them running up from the lake.&nbsp;
They had been at the pit.&nbsp; Then they said that they had seen a bush
moving while going down to the pit and then they heard giggling coming
from there.&nbsp; We had never been near the pit that day.&nbsp; After,
we sat in the pit and talked about what we had been doing and then these
faces started to appear.&nbsp; Everyone saw amore than one face all over.&nbsp;
We ran back to the cottage.&nbsp; Then I saw a white mist that had poped
up out of nowhere and then just disappeared.&nbsp; Then my friend saw the
same thing outside her window.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Haunted Toronto</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ramsalot@interlog.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Colborne Lodge, Toronto.&nbsp; I was suprised to hear this one...hadn't
heard it and I pass it everyday!</b>
<br><b>You might want to point out to folks that the lodge overlooks Grenadier
pond. It is atop a small hill in woods but the pond can be seen through
the trees.</b>
<br><b>Animation House, Parliament Street, Toronto&nbsp; I have heard a
story about someone who hanged themselves in the building which was a church
before it was tuned into an animation studio that makes TV commercials.&nbsp;
I heard this report years ago...and now I am working there as a freelance
animator.&nbsp; I was told years ago by a collegue that worked there, that
the third floor and the basement have been areas of apparitions and strange
noises. I work on the third floor and will let you know if anything happens.
So for now i cannot confirm the reports but will ask co-workers...consider
me your "man on the inside", I will let you know if anything happens.</b>
<br><b>Also, I will share with you a strange incident at my hometown residence
the day my mother was buried. Not so much a haunting as a personal presence
incident.&nbsp; The day my mother died of cancer, my son was born in Toronto.
Knowing she hadn't long to live I raced&nbsp; to my parents home in Sarnia
as soon as the doctors said my wife was fine and it was okay to do so...they
knew about my mother's situation.&nbsp; I was too late by a couple of hours,
it is a 3 1/2 hour drive to Sarnia, Ontario, Canada(north of Detroit) from
Toronto.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The day we buried mom, a family friend volunteered
to house-sit for us to prevent burglary (burglars assume everyone leaves
a house to go to weddings and funerals). He was in the kitchen when he
heard a thump from the family den. he noticed nothing. When we returned
from the funeral my father noticed the back sliding glass door had been
struck from the inside causing it to crack in a pattern as if some object
had struck the glass slightly higher than a human's head.</b>
<br><b>The glass door was two panes of glass and vaccuum sealed-no air
in the 'weather-barrier' space between the panes. No dead bird or thrown
object from outside could be seen outside and a thorough search of the
patio outside turned up no object capable of impacting the door and "bouncing'
to a hidden location.&nbsp; The door repairman was also baffled when he
arrived and stated that he doubted that the hot sun could have done it
with an uneven heating and cooling. The weather was sunny, warm with a
cool light breeze off the lake.&nbsp; At any rate the inner glass pane
was the one that was dammaged and that had everyone wondering. No household
object was out of place and no glass had fallen to the carpet.&nbsp; The
pattern, to me, resembled the kind of damage that might be incurred if
a human of short stature approx. 5'6" height had struck with all their
might at that spot overhead, causing the glass to</b>
<br><b>"spider-web".&nbsp; This incident occurred shortly after May 26,
1994, probably the 28th or 29th. The 26th was the day of her death.&nbsp;
I do not recall the date of her burial but I could ask my father.</b>
<br><b>While it is not an actual haunting, it does fall under the peculiar
category of supernatural incident, as I think it was my departed mother
expressing her sorrow that she could not see the baby or learn of her</b>
<br><b>becoming a grandmother.&nbsp; Other than that, I have no explanation.
Currently the house is unoccupied but sold to a local buyer. My father
lived in the house for six years moving to a smaller place this year and
has reported no further incidents.</b>

<p><b>Haunted Truck</b>
<br><b>By: val1@mindspring.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>A couple of years ago, I bought the truck of a deceased mechanic,
who was a bit eccentric. If he had his way, and had lived, noone would
have gotton any of his possesions. When he passed away, he had no family,
and his estate, full of old vehicles, was auctioned to the public. I never
really new this fellow, but my Dad knew him quite well.</b>
<br><b>I bought the truck from a friend that bought it at the auction,
so I never really visited this home site. Well, one day after I brought
it home, I was working on it, and being a 1956 model truck, you can imagine
the state of disrepair.</b>
<br><b>I should mention, before I go on, that the mechanic's name was Sidney.
That is what summoned him, I think.</b>
<br><b>I was working, under My Dad's garage rewiring the truck from one
end to the other, when I found that Sidney had wired the brake lights with
lamp cord. Aggravated about that, I said"That damn Sidney!" At that time,
I should mention the fact that it was very overcast, and becoming dark
outside. When I said that phrase, I felt a presense behind me, and looked
under my outstretched arm to see someone standing behind me. I naturally
looked around to see a short, fiftiesh man, with a dirty khaki work uniform,
with horn rimmed glasses on. I turned to him, and quickly turned and did
a double take back to where he was standing, and he was gone. I walked
around the back of the house, then to the front, and no sign of anyone.</b>
<br><b>I then went in and asked my Dad if he had seen an old man in the
yard. Puzzled, he said "No.", and then proceded to ask me to describe him.
When I did that, my Dad turned pale white, and said the hair was standing
up on the back of his neck. He said, "Son, you just described Sidney Moore!"
I then had those same hairs stand up on the back of my neck. He did not
try to harm me, nor frighten me, and honestly, I have not seen him again.
But, it does make you wonder!!</b>

<br><b>Haunted Shorehouse</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: goprendek@triversity.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Around 1985 or so, myself, my girlfriend at the time and some friends
went for a</b>
<br><b>vacation in Ocean City, NJ. We had rented a house about a block
off of the</b>
<br><b>beach. Once we got there and settled in my girlfriend went to lie
down in our</b>
<br><b>room. She came down about an hour later and said she couldn't sleep
because</b>
<br><b>something kept hitting and banging the bed from underneath. We were
all saying</b>
<br><b>that she were dreaming it. Something happened later that night that
made me</b>
<br><b>believe her. We went to bed around 2 am. My friend and his wife
took the attic</b>
<br><b>room. As we lay in bed we heared someone walking up the first floor
stairs and</b>
<br><b>stop outside of our door. The person(?) then proceeded to walk up
the second</b>
<br><b>floor stairs to the attic room. We heard him(it) walking around
for a while and</b>
<br><b>then would drag a chair around. It would then come back sound stairs.
This went</b>
<br><b>on all night. Up the stairs, up to the attic, drag things around....
etc. The</b>
<br><b>next morning I had asked my friend "What's the matter, couldn't
you sleep last</b>
<br><b>night?". He looked at me and said "I slept fine. What are you talking
about?" My</b>
<br><b>girlfriend and I then related the story to them and they seemed
shocked. They</b>
<br><b>both said that they slept soundly and heard nothing. When I told
them about a</b>
<br><b>chair being dragged around they told us that there was a chair up
there. My</b>
<br><b>girlfriend and I had never gone to the attic, we didn't know for
sure if there</b>
<br><b>was a chair up there or not. Little things kept happening during
the rest of our</b>
<br><b>stay that week. A chandelier suddenly would start swinging, sounds,
etc. I only</b>
<br><b>heard the walking man briefly once after that. Needless to say,
we couldn't wait</b>
<br><b>to go home.</b>

<br><b>Haunted Property and Cars</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: stuwanna@optusnet.com.au</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am not a believer in the supernatural but something occured that
has made</b>
<br><b>me open my mind. Just for fun a friend and I drove past a house
that was</b>
<br><b>supposedly haunted late one night. The car was in perfect condition
but when</b>
<br><b>we drove past the property the oil light lit up on the dash. We
quickly</b>
<br><b>drove to the shops nearby where there were street lights to check
the oil</b>
<br><b>even though we were sure that there was oil in it. And sure enough
there was</b>
<br><b>oil in it. (The oil lamp went off as soon as we left the road that
the</b>
<br><b>property was on). This is the truth with no exageration but the
oil light</b>
<br><b>has never lit up before because my boyfriend is a mechanic and the

<br><b>WIMBLEDON THEATRE among others</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jane@tutssel.freeserve.co.uk</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>WIMBLEDON THEATRE , at The Broadway, Wimbledon,</b>
<br><b>London SW19,&nbsp; built in the early 1900's.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I worked here for several years, and there are several ghosts.&nbsp;
The pleasant one was an old lady actress who died on stage, she returns
when there is a 'get-in' for a new show/play and is seen moving about in
the seats of the Gallery making sure everything is going alright. ( I have
seen her.)</b>
<br><b>One on stage is the ghost of a young male actor who used the time
while not on stage during a play to go out robbing nearby. The police pursued
him back to the theatre, and he jumped from the stage to a box, then fell
and died. Mostly he is heard as a falling body hitting the stage very hard.
( I have heard him.)</b>
<br><b>The third one is a real horror. No one was able to find out the
origins of this, or why the theatre was being plagued by it. In the 'ice
cream room' where there were three large chest freezers full of lollies
and ice creams, the plugs were found ripped out of the wall, and the still-frozen
lollies etc., were smashed to pieces, the usherettes going up to the room
to collect ices were shoved on the narrow stairs and hurt, one girl was
pushed</b>
<br><b>downstairs and broke her arm, and most strange.... the two co-managers
were</b>
<br><b>called back to the theatre one night by the police, as all the alarms
in the</b>
<br><b>place had gone off...all at the same time, they had been triggered
by</b>
<br><b>something crossing the beams of light ( there was no fault found
with the wiring</b>
<br><b>etc,)&nbsp; there was an awful smell in the place, with no apparant
cause.</b>
<br><b>Under the seating for the Circle and Gallery seats there is what
is known as</b>
<br><b>a 'void', caused by the upward rake of the seating, both voids were
empty, and</b>
<br><b>the only doors to enter them had been nailed and boarded up, to
prevent anyone</b>
<br><b>leaving rubbish in the voids, (Fire regulations)&nbsp; the doors
were BOTH open,</b>
<br><b>having been violently smashed open from INSIDE the voids. There
was an awful</b>
<br><b>atmosphere in there that night and even the Police were not at all
eager to</b>
<br><b>enter the voids to search. Before they went in the voids, they remarked
that</b>
<br><b>no footprints were visible in the considerable dust on the floors
inside.</b>
<br><b>Nothing was found, all tests on the alarm system found it to be
working</b>
<br><b>perfectly. I have had to go across the Rehearsal Room, into which
the gallery</b>
<br><b>void door opens, at night, while I worked there making costumes
in what had</b>
<br><b>been the gallery bar.&nbsp; ALWAYS, my light to illuminate the Rehearsal
Room was</b>
<br><b>left on for me by the electricians on the switching room board,
No one in the</b>
<br><b>place would walk across that room in the dark, and the Backstage
staff were</b>
<br><b>NOT a bunch of scaredycats.&nbsp; The atmosphere in that room was</b>
<br><b>awful.</b>
<br><b>Also, there is a much pleasanter ghost in Leighton</b>
<br><b>House, off Kensington High Street, near the Commonwealth Institute.</b>
<br><b>The house is a wonderful Victorian building made</b>
<br><b>for Lord Frederick Leighton, a fine sculptor and painter and a military
man</b>
<br><b>of note. It is now a museum, open to the public. There is a large
dining room</b>
<br><b>and beautiful reception rooms, as Lord Leighton was a very hospitable
man and</b>
<br><b>loved entertaining, but preferred everyone to go home afterwards...
there is</b>
<br><b>only one small bedroom, his !&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a wonderful atmosphere
of</b>
<br><b>welcome there when you enter, and Lord Leighton has been seen, recently,
in</b>
<br><b>dressing gown, with the morning papaer under his arm, descencing
the stairs,</b>
<br><b>by the cleaners.&nbsp; They were not aware that he was a ghost,
his prescence was</b>
<br><b>so solid and affable., and he greeted them pleasantly.&nbsp; I was
drawing one</b>
<br><b>of his sculptures one day, in his vast summer studio upstairs, and
was very</b>
<br><b>aware of an encouraging, warm prescence as if someone was looking
over my</b>
<br><b>shoulder, and enjoying watching me... since the drawing was going
well, I did</b>
<br><b>not look round and try to get rid of them, I just glanced over my
shoulder,</b>
<br><b>and there was noone there, I like to think it was Lord Leighton
approving of my</b>
<br><b>drawing...</b>

<br><b>Haunted Houses</b>
<br><b>By: mmelnick@telusplanet.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>About 29 yrs. ago I had moved to a new city in B.C. Canada&nbsp;
I &amp; my 2 young sons</b>
<br><b>(They were 4 &amp; 6) were staying with friends. Houses were hard
to find at a rent</b>
<br><b>I could afford.&nbsp; I finally found one in the paper and went
to see about renting</b>
<br><b>it. A&nbsp; Holding Co. was looking after the rental as the property
was owned by a</b>
<br><b>Bakery Co. in another province.&nbsp; I was told the reason the
rent was so cheap was</b>
<br><b>the house had been vacant for about 5 yrs. it had electricity &amp;
cold running</b>
<br><b>water</b>
<br><b>(no hot) since the house was on&nbsp; the lakeshore &amp; it was
summer I thought this</b>
<br><b>would be perfect&nbsp; for a temportary accomadations while I looked
for a better</b>
<br><b>one.&nbsp; The night before we moved in I dreamed about an old lady
in a blue flower</b>
<br><b>print dress with a kerchief on her head telling me she didn't want
me living in</b>
<br><b>her house.&nbsp; The next day we moved in.The house had a large&nbsp;
screened veranda as</b>
<br><b>you went through the door a&nbsp; small bedroom was to the right
&amp; to the left was a</b>
<br><b>small unfinshed room(just bare boards on the wall)</b>
<br><b>a&nbsp; doorway from that room led to the master bedroom and another
door from the</b>
<br><b>master bedroom led to the kitchen.&nbsp; We settled in. In the small
unfinished room</b>
<br><b>there&nbsp; were nails in the wall.&nbsp; I used this room to put
the boys toys in.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>nails in the wall were perfect&nbsp; to hang some of their toys
up.&nbsp; Just one little</b>
<br><b>problem everynight everything on the walls were thrown on the floor
and no</b>
<br><b>matter how fast I tried to get to the room I couldn't find out how
it was</b>
<br><b>happening.&nbsp; I began to wake up at night with the feeling something
was pressing</b>
<br><b>on my chest.&nbsp; The dog &amp; cat (who had always slept with
me) would not enter that</b>
<br><b>master bedroom.&nbsp; About 2 weeks after moving in I happened to
meet the lady next</b>
<br><b>door.&nbsp; As we talked I mentioned the dream I had had and described
the lady in my</b>
<br><b>dream.&nbsp; My neihbours face went white and I though she was going
to faint, I had</b>
<br><b>described the old lady who had owned the house&nbsp; perfectly.Then
the neihbour told</b>
<br><b>me the story of the house.&nbsp; The elderly lady had lived&nbsp;
in that house all her</b>
<br><b>married life, when she was unable to care for herself anymore her
son placed her</b>
<br><b>in a nursing home where she resided for 5 yrs. During this time
she refused&nbsp; to</b>
<br><b>allow her house to be rented.&nbsp; She didn't want anyone living
in her house.&nbsp; When</b>
<br><b>she died&nbsp; the son inherited and two weeks after she had passed
away I was living</b>
<br><b>in her house.&nbsp; I am happy to say shortly after I found new
accomadations and was</b>
<br><b>more than happy to move and leave that house to it's original owner.</b>

<br><b>My Haunted House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: addisons2@msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I grew up in a haunted house. I am an adult now and even though I
was terrified to go to sleep at night, the house is a part of who I am.
That may sound strange but I lived in that house for 19 years. We moved
in when I was 1 and the first experience I had was when I was 3 years old.
I had a ball of light and voices visit me when I was taking a nap and I
was paralyzed with fear. This happened to me two times. Meanwhile my father
was hearing footsteps upstairs and when he would get to the top of the
stairs they would stop. As I got a little older I can remember the toilet
flushing by itself all the time and also the water turning on in the tub,
full blast, by itself. The sink faucets would turn on full blast by themselves
and the whole time I lived there I could feel a "presence" of some sort
at the top of the stairs. A lot of people that came to visit felt the same
way. The house was about 90 years old. I can remember when I was around
12 or 13, I came upstairs and as I was walking up the stairs I could see
my light go off in my bedroom. When I walked into my bedroom the light
switch came back on. It was the old kind of light switch that you can hear
because it takes a heavy finger to push it on and off. That completely
freaked me out. I would go to bed at night praying for God to not let the
evil presence get me. It was a horrible way to grow up. I was always afraid.
I later found out that from older neighbors that lived in the neighborhood
for years, that a young teenage boy had committed suicide right outside
my house in the yard. When I was a teenager, my best friend came to spend
the night with me while my dad was out of town and in the middle of the
night we heard footsteps outside, we smelled burned toast in the kitchen
and we even heard pots and pans banging right in front of us, but there
weren't any pots and pans.We were crying, hugging each other. We heard
groaning noises in the bathroom. If we try to tell anyone what we experienced,
they look at us like we are crazy, so we don't even tell anyone. I have
quit trying to explain my experiences with people. When my family moved
out of the house almost every tree in the yard died. The people that moved
into the house after us reported it being haunted and the house is vacant
now.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Haunted Hospital</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Lisa Wright [lmhs@earthlink.net]</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My name is Lisa&nbsp; and I have seen or heard several ghosts at
my place</b>
<br><b>of work.&nbsp; What is strange is that other people have seen or
heard these as</b>
<br><b>well as I.</b>
<br><b>I have worked in several hospitals but this one hospital is the
only one</b>
<br><b>that I have seen or heard ghosts.&nbsp; It is a small community
hospital, that</b>
<br><b>only treat 100 people in a week.&nbsp; Most of the occurrences have
been on the</b>
<br><b>north side of the hospital and on the second floor where TCU was
located.</b>
<br><b>When I first started working on 2 North we had little occurrences
that we</b>
<br><b>dismissed, things like the light coming on or the call light turning
itself</b>
<br><b>on down the hall&nbsp; in rooms that were for storage only.&nbsp;
That all changed</b>
<br><b>one night when we only had 6 patients on the floor( all across from
the</b>
<br><b>nurses station) and one was on a ventilator.&nbsp; The one that
was on the vent</b>
<br><b>had been comatosed since admission and had his wrists tied to the
bedframe</b>
<br><b>to prevent him from pulling out the tube.(just in case he did wake).
The</b>
<br><b>nurse taking care of him needed mor information on the vent and
asked that</b>
<br><b>If I saw the Respiratory Therapist let her know.&nbsp; Well, we
were both</b>
<br><b>sitting at the station when the light went on in the vent pt's room.&nbsp;
We</b>
<br><b>went in the room expecting to find the RT but the room was empty
except for</b>
<br><b>the pt.&nbsp; The light cord to turn on the lilght was still hanging
from the</b>
<br><b>overbed light againist the wall.&nbsp; There was no way this pt
could have</b>
<br><b>pulled it.&nbsp; Later that same week in the same room and pt, I
was helping the</b>
<br><b>nurse pull the patient up in bed when I felt and saw something go
behind</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; I quickly turned my head in that direction to see who
it was and no</b>
<br><b>one was there.&nbsp; The nurse asked me why I look back that way
and I said I</b>
<br><b>thought I saw some go behind me and she said she saw it also.</b>
<br><b>At one point of my working there we heard someone in slippers walking
down</b>
<br><b>the hall near the nurses station.&nbsp; We only had 4 pts that night
and they</b>
<br><b>were on complete bedrest, so we went to each room to get that person
back</b>
<br><b>in bed.&nbsp; All of the pts were asleep. When we returned back
to the nurses</b>
<br><b>station the sound of the slippers started where they had stopped
( at the</b>
<br><b>nurses station) and continued down the hall.&nbsp; When our supervisor
made</b>
<br><b>rounds that night she asked me to go down the hall with her because
she saw</b>
<br><b>a man in black pants and a grayish/white shirt on go down the stairs.&nbsp;
She</b>
<br><b>went to the storage room from where he come out of and the door
was locked</b>
<br><b>we went to the stairs and looked around and found no one.</b>
<br><b>Many other things had happened while we were there but nothing that
hurt</b>
<br><b>anyone.&nbsp; Just sightings or things moving around or turning
on.&nbsp; As far as</b>
<br><b>the lights coming on we tell the pt that it is due to an electrical
problem.</b>
<br><b>I have also experienced things in our house that we bought 5 yrs
ago.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>is over 30 yrs old and as far as I know only 2 families lived here
before</b>
<br><b>us.</b>
<br><b>The first problem I encountered was with my second child that is
now 5 1/2</b>
<br><b>yrs old.&nbsp; She was about 2 yrs old when were sitting at the
kitchen table</b>
<br><b>eating dinner when she got upset and started screaming.&nbsp; "
he's there."</b>
<br><b>she was pointing to the hall that leads to our bathroom and bedrooms.&nbsp;
She</b>
<br><b>would not calm down, I tried to say there is nothing there but she
just got</b>
<br><b>more upset.&nbsp; We ended up downstairs where she finally calmed
down.&nbsp; This</b>
<br><b>happened several more times&nbsp; until I finally remembered what
my mother had</b>
<br><b>always said.&nbsp; Believe that GOd will protect you and say it.&nbsp;
On the last</b>
<br><b>time this happened with her screaming I took her back in the hallway
and</b>
<br><b>she pointed that it was in the bathroom the whole time she is screaming
and</b>
<br><b>tring to get out of my arms.&nbsp; I didn't see anything but it
didn't feel</b>
<br><b>right either.&nbsp; I basically said ." I know you are here and
thats fine but</b>
<br><b>you need to go.&nbsp; The Lord will protect us."&nbsp; She never
had any problems</b>
<br><b>again but when my 3rd&nbsp; child was born I was cleaning up downstairs
and had</b>
<br><b>just cleaned the table off when I turned around with more toys and
found</b>
<br><b>that the table was covered again!&nbsp; I agian stated I new it
was there and it</b>
<br><b>needed to leave.&nbsp; No problems until my 3rd child was about
1 1/2 yrs old</b>
<br><b>and he did the exact same thing that my second child did.&nbsp;
He started the</b>
<br><b>screaming and pointing from the kitchen to the hall.&nbsp; At this
point my</b>
<br><b>husband and 16 yr old felt uneasy and believed that something was
indeed in</b>
<br><b>our house.&nbsp; My third child only had 3 of the episodes but my
16 yr old says</b>
<br><b>that something was in my bedroom moving the bags around.&nbsp; At
first he</b>
<br><b>thought it was our cat but the cat was downstairs with me.&nbsp;
Again I said it</b>
<br><b>must go and haven't heard or seen anything since which I hope it
stays away!</b><b></b>

<br><b>HAUNTED HOME</b><b></b>

<p><b>When I was a little girl growing up in Connersville,IN. the home
we lived in</b>
<br><b>had some strange things go on there. When my grandfather died a
few months</b>
<br><b>later,in my room would come some strange noises and since my parents
were</b>
<br><b>deaf I was the one they relied on. one night I was alone in my room
and this</b>
<br><b>strange knocking could be heard I couldn't figure out where this
was coming</b>
<br><b>from and it was frightning&nbsp; to me it continued every night
till I finally</b>

<br><b>well we had a plumber come check and he could not find anything
wrong and he</b>
<br><b>said it was probably from my overactive imagination well it didn't
stop till</b>
<br><b>finally I was so scared that I shouted who's there, it stopped.
I begged my</b>

more noises</b>
<br><b>was heard in that room. I have had encounters with things I could
not explain</b>
<br><b>nor could I see, like footsteps ascending the basement stairs but
never</b>
<br><b>reached the top of the stairs, also our phone would ring in the

<br><b>Haunted Football Field</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: PatsyMac25@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, the enire high school was said to be
haunted.&nbsp; when the school</b>
<br><b>was built, a family cemetary was located on the section af land
that was used</b>
<br><b>for the football field.&nbsp; when the school was built, the graves
were relocated</b>
<br><b>to the cemetary in the center of town.&nbsp; in my four years of
high school, my</b>
<br><b>friend and i had several strange happenings occur.&nbsp; the first
one was our</b>
<br><b>sophmore year.&nbsp; we were picked to stay after school to help
get things ready</b>
<br><b>for a fall festival.&nbsp; by the time we were done, it was well
after all the</b>
<br><b>teachers and students had gone home.&nbsp; we went out the front
doors to sit on</b>
<br><b>the steps and wait for my father to pick us up.&nbsp; as we sat
there, we heard</b>
<br><b>the main doors behind us open and close.&nbsp; figuring it was someone
else</b>
<br><b>getting ready to leave, we turned and looked, but no one was there.&nbsp;
this</b>
<br><b>happened several more times.&nbsp; we watched the doors open and
close by</b>
<br><b>theselves, as if people were going in and out.&nbsp; i thought it
was possibly</b>
<br><b>someone playing a joke on us, and grabbed the door the next time
it swung</b>
<br><b>open.&nbsp; nobody was in the front lobby.&nbsp; i let the door
close then tried to</b>
<br><b>open it, but at night the doors automatically lock when they are
shut.&nbsp; the</b>
<br><b>only way to open them is from the inside.&nbsp; my friend and i
were standing</b>
<br><b>about 3 feet away from the doors when it happened again.&nbsp; it
freaked us out</b>
<br><b>and we ran to the end of the driveway to wait on my dad.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; another thing that happened was also at night.&nbsp;
our Junior year, the same</b>
<br><b>friend and i were on a field trip close to Christmas-time and we
got back to</b>
<br><b>the school after dark.&nbsp; as we sat in the car waiting for it
to warm up, we</b>
<br><b>noticed people walking around under the bleachers.&nbsp; we were
parked facing the</b>
<br><b>back of the home side of the bleachers, so i got her to turn her
bright</b>
<br><b>lights on.&nbsp; when she did, the figures were gone.&nbsp; she
turned her lights off</b>
<br><b>again and several figures reappeared, walking back and forth.&nbsp;
needless to</b>
<br><b>say, we practically flew out of there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these are just a few things i personally saw/felt.&nbsp;
another friend of</b>
<br><b>mine was in the men's restroom and was locked in a stall for 20
minutes.&nbsp; he</b>
<br><b>said it felt like someone was leaning on the door from the other
side...it</b>
<br><b>would move a few centimeters and then stop.&nbsp; he finally crawled
under the</b>
<br><b>partition to the next stall and went out that door.&nbsp; when he
looked back, the</b>
<br><b>stall he was originally in was standing wide open.&nbsp; another
friend was an</b>
<br><b>aide in the library in the morning.&nbsp; she would go in, and put
all the new</b>
<br><b>magazines and newspapers on the rack in the corner.&nbsp; several
times after</b>
<br><b>doing this, she would leave and come back to find the papers she
had just</b>
<br><b>placed on the racks were thrown all over the floor.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there was a lot more that happened when i was
there, and now that i have</b>
<br><b>2 neices at the same school, i have heard even more stories.&nbsp;
my husband and</b>
<br><b>i live in a small house less than half a mile from the high school,
and</b>
<br><b>typing about it is giving me cold chills.</b>

<p><b>Haunted Family Home</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Bailey7435@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>House background: My mom now lives in her childhood home on North
11th St,</b>
<br><b>about 4 blocks away from where I currently live. After my Grandfather
and</b>
<br><b>Grandmother married, they were renting a house on 13 1/2 St. My</b>
<br><b>grandmother's father and his wife later bought the home as a Christmas
gift for my</b>
<br><b>grandparents. The house was then moved to it's current, large location
on</b>
<br><b>two lots on North 11th St.</b>
<br><b>My grandfather, Paul, passed away at the age of 56 suddenly on May
9, 1970</b>
<br><b>when my mom was pregnant with me (I was born on January 7, 1971-even
though</b>
<br><b>I was due on December 8-the doctors think I was born so late because
the</b>
<br><b>Stress my mom went through losing her father). He was driving a
car about 4 blocks</b>
<br><b>away from the house (my grandmother and his young son, who was 10
yrs old</b>
<br><b>were with him) and had a sudden heart attack, which killed him instantly.
My</b>
<br><b>grandmother had to steer the car to the side of the road to avoid
an</b>
<br><b>accident during the heart attack. I recently found out from my mother
that one of her</b>
<br><b>brothers had a terrible fight with my Grandpa right before he had
the heart</b>
<br><b>attack-they had not made up when he died.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My mom and my family moved into the house when I was 14 years
old, when my</b>
<br><b>grandmother moved out. The entire attic area used to be my grandmother's</b>
<br><b>artist studio. Later on one of my uncles lived up there when he
was in his</b>
<br><b>twenties (the same one that fought with my grandpa). When we moved
in, my</b>
<br><b>younger sister and I shared the attic space as a large bedroom and
separate</b>
<br><b>dressing room area. There are very steep wooden stairs that lead
to the open</b>
<br><b>attic space. There is only one window on the attic floor.</b>
<br><b>First sign of activity observed by my younger brother, Rick, approximately
8</b>
<br><b>years ago:</b>
<br><b>My brother was home alone one evening. He was sitting on the couch
in the</b>
<br><b>living room (the steep wooden stairs leading up to the attic were
on the</b>
<br><b>other side of the full wall where the couch was located). The TV
was on and</b>
<br><b>he was chatting on the phone with his best friend, Dave. All of
the sudden,</b>
<br><b>my brother heard the heavy sound of a person racing down the wood
stairs. He</b>
<br><b>was terrified and the sound was so loud that his friend could hear
the noise</b>
<br><b>through the phone. Dave immediately told my brother to get out of
the house</b>
<br><b>(my brother had recently come home from Dave's house and Dave thought</b>
<br><b>someone had broken into the house while my brother was gone). My
brother raced out</b>
<br><b>the house through the living room door and Dave's family called
the police.</b>
<br><b>My brother waited outside until the police arrived. A search of
the house</b>
<br><b>showed all other doors were deadbolted from the inside and the windows
to</b>
<br><b>the house were secure and no one had exited the door my brother
left open when</b>
<br><b>he fled. While the police were seaching the house, my mom's boyfriend,
John,</b>
<br><b>returned home. John told the police (2 officers) they could continue</b>
<br><b>searching, but that he was sure no one was in the house. He thought
my</b>
<br><b>brother was imagining things.</b>
<br><b>2nd know occurance with Rick: That same year, my brother was asleep
in his</b>
<br><b>bedroom (one wall of his bedroom shares a different wall with the
living</b>
<br><b>room). The entire house has wood floors and the doors are very noisy
and</b>
<br><b>creak when they are opened. My mom's bedroom is directly across
the hall</b>
<br><b>from my brother's bedroom and both of them have always slept with
the bedroom</b>
<br><b>doors shut. My brother and I are extremely deep sleepers, but my
brother</b>
<br><b>woke up late one night because his door was creaking open. He raised
his head and</b>
<br><b>saw a shadowy/filmy figure (which he then called "Darkman") standing
in his</b>
<br><b>doorway. This figure was filmy and was not the figure of my mom
or her</b>
<br><b>boyfriend. My brother was terrified and had no way to get out of
the room,</b>
<br><b>so he pulled the covers over his head and stayed that way until
morning.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>did not tell anyone (except Dave) because he did not think anyone
would believe</b>
<br><b>him.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;3rd known occurance, observed by me: I first of all need to
let you know</b>
<br><b>that I was away at IU when the first events happened and I *did
not* learn about</b>
<br><b>my brother's experience until after my own.</b>
<br><b>I returned from IU for the summer and I was working a night shift
job and my</b>
<br><b>brother was attending college classes, my mom and her boyfriend
worked</b>
<br><b>during the day, so I was the only person home during the day. For
lunch, I was</b>
<br><b>preparing mac &amp; cheese. I filled a pot of water to boil. I turned
the burner</b>
<br><b>on to heat the water, and then the phone rang. I answered the phone
in the</b>
<br><b>living room and it was my fiance, John, (now husband) calling. I
sat in a</b>
<br><b>recliner chatting away with him for about 10 minutes when I remembered
I</b>
<br><b>left the burner on under the water! I asked John to hold on and
raced into the</b>
<br><b>kitchen-the burner was turned off and the water still had bubbles
at the</b>
<br><b>top-I had never gone back into the kitchen to turn the water off
and it was</b>
<br><b>NOT even close to boiling when I left the room! It had obviously
boiled and</b>
<br><b>somehow the burner turned itself off! The burner on the stove was
the type</b>
<br><b>where you had to twist the handle almost 360 degrees to go from
HIGH to OFF,</b>
<br><b>so there is no way the burner handle "slipped" and turned itself
off.</b>
<br><b>I was very shaken and told my fiance what happened when I got on
the phone.</b>
<br><b>Since he knew I was on the phone in the living room, he could not
figure out</b>
<br><b>how the burner turned itself off.</b>
<br><b>When my mom and brother, Rick, came home from work, I told them
what</b>
<br><b>happened. Shortly after, my fiance arrived to take me out. We all
started</b>
<br><b>comparing stories and realized something strange was happening in
the house.</b>
<br><b>We realized that at times we all heard someone walking on the wood
floors</b>
<br><b>through the house late at night and we each assumed it was someone
living in</b>
<br><b>the house, when it was not. My brother was leaving to take his girlfriend</b>
<br><b>out that night. John and I were going out on a date. I think my
mom was scared</b>
<br><b>to be alone, so my brother named the ghost "Oliver" (we told my
mom he must be</b>
<br><b>a "good" ghost to turn off the stove burner and my brother gave
him an</b>
<br><b>innocent sounding name to asssure my mom). Looking back, I would
have never left my</b>
<br><b>mom, but I was in my early twenties and looking forward to a party
that</b>
<br><b>night.</b>
<br><b>4th occurance, experienced by Rick: About a year after the first
incident,</b>
<br><b>Rick's best friend Dave was attending IU. He called my brother from
IU and</b>
<br><b>and jokingly asked how "Oliver" (the name our family gave the ghost)
was</b>
<br><b>doing and if he had showed himself lately. My brother happily said
Oliver</b>
<br><b>must have left the house, since no strange events had happened lately.
They</b>
<br><b>were joking around about "Oliver" over the phone. After the phone
call and</b>
<br><b>later that night, my brother felt someone smack (a light tap, not
harmful)</b>
<br><b>him on the back of the neck, even though when he turned around,
no one was</b>
<br><b>there (Rick immediately puled the covers over his head again). My
brother</b>
<br><b>and I both feel that Oliver was just letting my brother know that
Oliver was</b>
<br><b>still around.</b>
<br><b>Looking back in hindsight, I think there are plenty of signs the
house was</b>
<br><b>haunted, but until these incidents Rick and I personally experienced,
we</b>
<br><b>did not pay attention to a few things because we never dreamed the
house was</b>
<br><b>haunted. Here a few examples of what happened that stand out:</b>
<br><b>1. When my Grandma moved out and my family moved in : My younger
sister (by</b>
<br><b>10 1/2 months) and I shared the attic as a bedroom-I was 14 at the
time. The</b>
<br><b>first day we moved in, my sister went to plug in a bed light in
an outlet.</b>
<br><b>The lightbulb exploded and sparks flew out of the outlet-my sister
was given</b>
<br><b>a slight shock through the lamp. We were both freaked out (my best
friend</b>
<br><b>that helped us move witnessed this event) and the outlet was inspected.
It</b>
<br><b>was fine. A new bulb was placed in the lamp and we never had another
problem</b>
<br><b>with the lamp/outlet.</b>
<br><b>2. The summer I was home from IU after the boiling water on the
stove event:</b>
<br><b>My mother's boyfriend was a triathele (sp?) and they frequently
traveled on</b>
<br><b>the weekends to events out of town. My brother usually stayed at
Dave's</b>
<br><b>house</b>
<br><b>when my mom was out of town. I would come home from work or out
with John to</b>
<br><b>find different lights on then what I left on in the house. One time
I came</b>
<br><b>home and no lights at all were left on. I assumed my brother had
come home,</b>
<br><b>but I later found out that from Dave's family that they never brought
my</b>
<br><b>brother back by the house. Other times: The TV would turn off when
different</b>
<br><b>family members were watching it-we thought it was a short in the
remote, but</b>
<br><b>the remote always worked fine.</b>
<br><b>3. The Birds: my mom and her boyfriend own two birds-an African
Grey and a</b>
<br><b>Parrot. Their cages are covered at night in what we call "The</b>
<br><b>Breezeway/Family Room". The cages are covered at night and the birds
do not</b>
<br><b>speak if they are covered unless someone comes into the room and
makes a lot</b>
<br><b>of noise or talks to them. From all areas of the house at night,
we have</b>
<br><b>heard the parrot cry "Hello" or "Who's there"-things they only say
when</b>
<br><b>soneone is in the room with them or talking to them.</b>
<br><b>4. The Parrot. Mom's parrot is named Jose. When I was home from
IU and</b>
<br><b>everyone was at work during the day, Jose somehow escaped his cage
one day</b>
<br><b>(this was after the boiling water incident). I heard a strange noise
in the</b>
<br><b>kitchen and was scared until I saw Jose swinging from a house plant.
Jose</b>
<br><b>had been known to escape his cage previously, so a lock had beeen
put on the</b>
<br><b>cage. Jose was out of his cage, lock still in place. I had to call
my mom at</b>
<br><b>work (she was the only one that had a key to his cage) to come home
from</b>
<br><b>work to unlock his cage and put him back in his cage.</b>
<br><b>5. Strange calls: When I returned from IU for good, I was living
in the</b>
<br><b>attic of my mom's house by myself. I had to get up first in the
house to get ready</b>
<br><b>to go out of town. One Saturday morning (I was 23 years old), the
set alarm</b>
<br><b>rang and I switched on the light in my bedroom to get up. As soon
as my</b>
<br><b>light was on, the phone in my bedroom immediately rang, although
there was</b>
<br><b>silence/static on the line when I picked up-the there was only one
window</b>
<br><b>into my room and the phone rang as soon as the light switched on-not
gving a</b>
<br><b>person outside enough time to call if they saw the light.</b>
<br><b>A few times during the week when my mom would leave, the phone would
ring</b>
<br><b>And no one would be on the line again. I was still working nights
at the time</b>
<br><b>And I completely broke down and cried at work one night because
one of the times</b>
<br><b>the phone rang and was full of static was as soon as my mom and
her</b>
<br><b>boyfriend pulled out of the driveway to go out of town one weekend-I
was convinced</b>
<br><b>someone was watching the house and knew when I was alone. That was
enough</b>
<br><b>for me...my fiance and I were convinced someone was watching the
house and I</b>
<br><b>finally left the house and moved in with my sister and her husband.</b>
<br><b>6. The Dresser falling on my best friend, Lana: About 2 years after
my mom</b>
<br><b>and family moved into the house (I was 16), it was my junior year
in high</b>
<br><b>school. My best friend's parents were moving to St. Louis and my
mom was</b>
<br><b>given guardianship of Lana so she could graduate high school here.
Lana came</b>
<br><b>home trashed one night (only my mom and her boyfriend were home
sleeping</b>
<br><b>that night). My mom woke up to a huge crashing noise in our attic
bedroom. She</b>
<br><b>raced upstairs and found Lana pinned naked under a double sized
dresser-my</b>
<br><b>mom's boyfriend had to help lift the huge dresser off Lana, it was
so heavy.</b>
<br><b>Lana had apparently been trying to change clothes when the dresser
toppled</b>
<br><b>over on her. Lana was not seriously hurt, but my mom put her a downstairs</b>
<br><b>bedroom and called me (me, my future fiance/husband John, and two
friends,</b>
<br><b>Bill and Molly, were playing cards at Bill's house)since Lana was
very drunk</b>
<br><b>and my mom was upset. We immediately went to my house and could
not figure</b>
<br><b>out how the dresser fell on Lana, since the drawers all pull out
and even</b>
<br><b>then, she did not have enough strength to pull a huge double dresser
on top</b>
<br><b>of herself. Unfortunately, Lana was so drunk she did not even remember
how</b>
<br><b>the dresser ended up on her. The dresser was full of clothes and
it took</b>
<br><b>three of us to even rock it back and forth, let alone topple it.
Was the</b>
<br><b>dresser falling on Lana a paranormal event?</b>
<br><b>All of us kids have been out of the house for years. My mom, my
brother,</b>
<br><b>Dave, my husband and I have always been convinced the house is haunted.
My</b>
<br><b>husband absolutely refuses to go into the basement of the house
(strange,</b>
<br><b>since a lot of the activity happended in the bedroom where I used
to</b>
<br><b>live-the attic...no signs of haunting in the basement at all). My
mom has since</b>
<br><b>convinced herself that the house is NOT haunted-I think she is convincing</b>
<br><b>herself of this so she can continue to live in her childhood home
in peace.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My grandmother who originally lived in the home is still alive
and she is</b>
<br><b>going to be at a party at my house next weekend. I'm going to ask
her if she</b>
<br><b>experienced odd events in the home while she was living there.</b>
<br><b>I am hoping that if there is a spirit in the home, it is my grandpa,
whom I</b>
<br><b>never knew, watching over all of us (ex.turning the boiling water
off so I</b>
<br><b>did not burn his home down). I see his visits with my brother as
playful</b>
<br><b>events and a reminder to his first grandson that he is around. However,
if a</b>
<br><b>dresser was crashed onto Lana (the first non-relative living in
the home</b>
<br><b>since Grandma and Grandpa lived in the house), I am concerned for
other non</b>
<br><b>relatives who may eventually live in the house.</b>
<br><b>Since Mom has convinced herself that there are no ghosts or spirits,
I am</b>
<br><b>interested in exploring the realm of spirits when she is out of
town, since</b>
<br><b>I take care of the house while she is gone. Also, is there anyway
I can tell</b>
<br><b>If this spirit is my Grandfather or someone else? Since the house
was moved, I</b>
<br><b>do not know the history of the land, although I am going to check
with my</b>
<br><b>mom to see if she has the abstract for the land.</b>

<p><b>Haunted Coach-house??</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: scl411@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My experience occurred 21 years ago, when I was 7.&nbsp; My family
had booked a</b>
<br><b>break in an old coach-house in Cornwall (UK).&nbsp; The building,
from what I can</b>
<br><b>remember, was beautiful - typical Olde English and dated from the
mid to</b>
<br><b>late seventeen-hundreds.</b>
<br><b>The first thing that I remember thinking was that the house was
very cold,</b>
<br><b>even though it was the middle of summer (ok, so that's not saying
much in</b>
<br><b>England!).&nbsp; It was so cold in the evenings that we had to light
the log</b>
<br><b>fire.</b>
<br><b>I was sharing the upstairs bedroom with my sister and her boyfriend,</b>
<br><b>sleeping on the floor, as there were only two beds!&nbsp;&nbsp;
Because it was a</b>
<br><b>"strange" house, I was allowed to leave a small nightlight on, incase
I woke</b>
<br><b>up.&nbsp; One night I remember waking up.&nbsp; My sister and her
boyfriend were</b>
<br><b>asleep and it was very quiet.&nbsp; I remember being scared for
some reason and</b>
<br><b>couldn't get back off to sleep.&nbsp; After a while, the nightlight
began to dim</b>
<br><b>and the room seemed to get even colder than it was already.&nbsp;
On the wall, to</b>
<br><b>my right, was a small hatch that lead into the loft.&nbsp; As the
light faded,</b>
<br><b>the catch on the small loft door began to rattle and lifted up.&nbsp;
The door</b>
<br><b>itself began to open at which point I started to cry!!!&nbsp; This
woke my sister</b>
<br><b>up, at the same time, the loft door closed and the catch re-set
itself.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>nightlight also returned to its normal level.&nbsp; My sister's
boyfriend had a</b>
<br><b>look in the loft but it was completely empty.</b>
<br><b>Several nights later, my sister said that as she was sitting in
bed reading,</b>
<br><b>she felt somebody sit on the end of the bed and although there was
nobody</b>
<br><b>there, the quilt "bunched up" and slid off.</b>
<br><b>I'm sure there may well be perfectly reasonable explanations for
these</b>
<br><b>occurrences but, from that day on, I've been sure that the supernatural
is</b>
<br><b>indeed for real.</b>

<p><b>Found Me?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LCO LODGE [eiWMLssp@win.bright.net]</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I wrote to you a few weeks back about an experience I had when I
was a child. My promise at that time was to return and share with you an
experience I had within recent years that became known publicly. In the
year 1993 my girlfriend (at the time) and myself was renting an older two
story duplex in a not so famous part of Minneapolis Mn.</b>
<br><b>One late evening as my mother, older brother and myself were playing
cards. My girlfriend was sleeping in a bedroom connected to the living
room.</b>
<br><b>At one point during the course of the game my mother started giggling
and sayed, "She is a funny girl isn't she?" I said who, and mom replied
Sheila. Not knowing what she meant...I continued playing cards. A little
while later my brother told me to go and tell my girlfriend to stop peeking
at him, as it was starting to irritate him.</b>
<br><b>I went into the bedroom only to discover she was sound asleep and
was lightly snoring....every once in awhile she blew through her mouth,
a good indication she was totally asleep.</b>
<br><b>I then re-entered the living room to tell my brother it wasn't her.
She was asleep.</b>
<br><b>During the remainder of the evening, all three of us would see movement
stemming from the bedroom, but upon closer inspection, there would be nothing.</b>
<br><b>Nearly three months later, My girlfriend and myself were sleeping
in the same bedroom. Now I am a sound sleeper. Not even Shiela could wake
me up. At one course during the evening...I woke up to something rubbing
up against the bottom of my feet. (My feet always stick out of the blanket.)
I knew it wasn't Sheila as I could feel the warmth of her body next to
mine and could hear her exhale. I sat up in bed and through the dim light
of the yard light I saw a solid form with glowing red eyes standing at
the base of the bed. Immediately my body froze in complete terror. I could
feel the goose bumps! My first thought was to protect my loved one so I
jumped up out of bed at which point the thing "scurried" across the living
room floor. It was moving fast so I quickly dove at it hoping to use my
body weight to land on it and disable it. It moved way too fast and I saw
it disappear...it actually disappeared in the kitchen!!!! In the gloww
of the night light in the kitchen I saw it head straight for a wall and
vanish.</b>
<br><b>I was still terrified of what it was. My girlfriend Sheila then
startled me from behind by asking "What's the matter? I almost attacked
her because I was still in shock and thought she was that thing. At this
point I began crying and told her what I had just went through.</b>
<br><b>The very next day we consulted a local spiritual leader for Native
Americans who confirmed our hauntings. He told us the house was open to
bad spirits due to previous occupants who used drugs and had most likely
dabbled in "Bad Medicine".</b>
<br><b>I myself went with him from room to room as he blessed the house
with prayer and sweat grass. At certain point in the house we would encounter
cold spots in which he would then ask me to leave. Afterwards he instucted
us to vacumm all the corners of the rooms and to use sage.</b>
<br><b>In a final note....the thing I saw recently and the thing I saw
as a child looked to be the same type of "creature", but how could it have
followed me even after all these years? But even a better question is...what
is this thing?</b>

<br><b>I HONESTLY cannot SAY THAT WHAT I EXPERIENCED WOULD QUALIFY AS A
"GHOST&nbsp; STORY" BUT I CAN SAY I WILL NEVER FORGET IT. MANY YEARS AGO

WHEN I WOKE UP I WOULD</b>
<br><b>PASS IT OFF AS JUST A BAD DREAM, BUT IT STARTED HAPPENING EVERY

SAFE TO SLEEP. UNFORTUNATELY, I COULD NOT HAVE MY BOYFRIEND STAY OVER EVERY

<br><b>Grisley Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: robin@mccomb27.freeserve.co.uk</b><b></b>
<p><b>I had a Grisly experiance one day. I was in my school alone after
it had shut for the day.&nbsp; I was trying to play a prank and ended up
getting scared out of my boot's.&nbsp; There is a tale of a young boy who
tried to jump the whole way down the stairs pretending he was Superman.
He hit his head off the top of the stairs and killed himself. The story
goes that he was doomed to spend eternity Jumping off the stairs until
he got it right and landed at the bottom.&nbsp; Anyway i was in the school
and i went to the toilets.&nbsp; The stairs where the boy died was right
behind the toilets when i heard a noise from the top of the stairs. I looked
around to see the ghost of the boy jumping off the stairs and getting killed.&nbsp;
His face was covered in blood and unrecognisable and his neck was mangled
out of shape.&nbsp; I was so scared that i started to run.&nbsp; It was
at this time that i noticed the ghost had got up and started to walk down
the corridor i was running down.&nbsp; It freaked me out so i just ran
like hell down the corridor and got out of the school.&nbsp; I didn't go
to school for the next week instead feigning illness so i didn't have to
go. Well i hope you enjoyed reading about my experience and i look forward
to coming back to your site some more.</b>

<br><b>watching over me. Even though you are probably a lot</b>
<br><b>older than me I hope that we can become good friends.</b>
<br><b>I saw where you worked and it seems very interesting.</b>
<br><b>If you're willing to, tell me a little about what you</b>
<br><b>do with your work, I'd like to know. Although I have</b>
<br><b>not come into contact with any orbs, I know for</b>
<br><b>positive that I have come into contact with unseen</b>
<br><b>spirits. I have a Quija board and I need your advice,</b>
<br><b>should I throw it out? Here is my story, if you think</b>
<br><b>it is good enough to be put on your site, please do,</b>
<br><b>and if I could, I'd like to talk to you more about my</b>
<br><b>experiences with spirits, ghosts, or whatever I come</b>
<br><b>in contact with. My story is: One night, in the summer</b>
<br><b>of 1999, a year after my mother had died, when I was</b>
<br><b>11, I turned on the T.V. at 3:00 AM. I had to go to</b>
<br><b>the bathroom so I walked through our dark hallway and</b>
<br><b>came back to find out the T.V. had been turned off. My</b>
<br><b>grandparents were asleep in their room. I got scared</b>
<br><b>and the next day, while eating breakfast, the garage</b>
<br><b>door flew open and the cap on the milk flew into the</b>
<br><b>air and then dropped to the floor. I knew it was my</b>
<br><b>mother trying to tell me something. The next night I</b>
<br><b>looked into my mirror, and saw my mom's reflection</b>
<br><b>staring straight at me. She was "supposedly" standing</b>
<br><b>right behind me. I quickly turned around and she was</b>
<br><b>gone. That night I prayed for her not to haunt me</b>
<br><b>anymore, I said that I loved her, but for her not to</b>
<br><b>visit me anymore. She belongs in her world now. From</b>
<br><b>that day, I was free from her "visits".</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Grandparents died in 1977, but they never left me. They have

<br><b>The most recent was is 1998. I had over dosed and in my unconciesness</b>
<br><b>I called a close friend in Colorado and told her what I had done.

<br><b>Grandmothers picture</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: penandjen@netzero.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My grandfather died recently and I moved into his house. My
grandmother had passed away some fifteen years or so earlier. I was happy
to take over their home because I had had many wonderful times there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;While I was decorating, I found a box of pictures of my grandparents.
I didn't have many of my grandmother because she was a bit overweight and
hated to have her picture taken. Many times she would take a pen or marker
and draw around her body in the picture to make herself look thinner. Like
drawing on the sides of her legs or indenting her waist. We would always
laugh about it but I didn't like her doing it because she would ruin the
rare pictures that I would get of her.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Well, I found a picture of her taken many years ago sitting
on the beach with her brother and his wife. It didn't have any marks of
any kind on it and I was thrilled so I stuck it on my refrigerator so that
I could see her everyday.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;That night my friend was over and we were talking about spirits
and wondering what happens when you die... I wondered if my grandfather
was now with my grandmother. I looked up and asked out loud for my grandmother
to please give me a sign that they were still out there somewhere. I asked
her for a sign that couldn't be disputed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Two days later I went to the refrigerator and looked at the
picture and nearly fainted. My eyes got so wide and my mouth dropped open.
I couldn't speak. My grandmother's waist and legs had been outlined in
red! Just like she had always done when she was alive!</b>
<br><b>It looks like red magic marker but when I took a red marker and
drew a little line in the corner of the same picture it left an iridescent
mark when you tilt the picture. The marks around my grandmother look like
they're in the picture.</b>
<br><b>Many people saw the picture before the red marks so I know I'm not
crazy.</b><b></b>

<br><b>This happened to my mom.&nbsp; My moms house was built in 1902.&nbsp;
A few years ago</b>
<br><b>my mom went out back to put some things in storage in the grainery.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>steps going into the grainery were really bad, crumbling, some almost</b>
<br><b>completly gone.&nbsp; When she came back out she slipped on the
steps and almost</b>
<br><b>fell.&nbsp; She felt someone grab her arm to support her and help
her get her</b>
<br><b>balance.&nbsp; There wasn't anyone there.&nbsp; She didn't think
any more about it,</b>
<br><b>until she saw the handprint on her arm.&nbsp; The handprint&nbsp;
was in a spot where</b>
<br><b>she could not have done it herself.&nbsp; Freaky I think.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Grandfather's Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tejanita1@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Since I recently found your site, I've been back a few</b>
<br><b>times.&nbsp; I've always been interested in the paranormal.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Ghost stories don't scare me very much, but I don't</b>
<br><b>know what I'd do if I ever had a first hand</b>
<br><b>experience.&nbsp; What I'm writing to you about was not</b>
<br><b>experienced by me, but by my grandmother, who lives in</b>
<br><b>different state than I do.&nbsp; My grandfather died from</b>
<br><b>heart complications approximately 12 years ago.&nbsp; When</b>
<br><b>my father was young, before he went into the military</b>
<br><b>and subsequently to Vietnam, he built a rocking chair</b>
<br><b>for my grandmother.&nbsp; It was also one of my</b>
<br><b>grandfather's favorite places to sit, along with the</b>
<br><b>dog, which they had for several years, that my</b>
<br><b>grandparents had before my grandfather died.&nbsp; When my</b>
<br><b>grandmother visited us a few years ago, she told me</b>
<br><b>and my mother that about six months after my</b>
<br><b>grandfather had died, she was sitting in the living</b>
<br><b>room of their home, watching television.&nbsp; The only</b>
<br><b>ones in the house were my grandmother and the dog.</b>
<br><b>All of a sudden, the dog, who had been sleeping on the</b>
<br><b>couch next to my grandmother, jumped off the couch and</b>
<br><b>went to lay down in front of the rocking chair where</b>
<br><b>he would sit with my grandfather all of the time.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>dog curled up in front of the rocking chair, and then</b>
<br><b>the rocking chair started rocking back and forth as if</b>
<br><b>someone was sitting in it.&nbsp; Occasionally, the dog</b>
<br><b>would look up at the rocking chair.&nbsp; No windows or</b>
<br><b>doors were open to let in any wind that might have</b>
<br><b>done this and the chair wasn't near any other source</b>
<br><b>of air that could have caused it to move.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>grandmother said she didn't feel frightened, she felt</b>
<br><b>almost calm, as if my grandfather had come to visit</b>
<br><b>her to keep her company, since she was basically alone</b>
<br><b>after his death.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Gone For Good</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: plwangel@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am curious as to how to stop an haunting at my mother-in-law's
house.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>house was been rented to an Bulgarian family and one man was shot
(killed</b>
<br><b>instantly) by police in the driveway of the house on Oct. 2nd of
this year.</b>
<br><b>A week went by before strange things began happening at the house.&nbsp;
We'd see</b>
<br><b>shadows going by in various parts of the rooms of the house and
not be able</b>
<br><b>to find anyone in the house.&nbsp; The house is locked up tight
as well as the</b>
<br><b>windows.&nbsp; Windows are never opened.&nbsp; Doors would open
and shut by</b>
<br><b>themselves.&nbsp; We wouldn't see the doors open/shut, but we'd
hear it and find</b>
<br><b>the doors either opened/shut.&nbsp; A number of people have experienced
this</b>
<br><b>along with us.&nbsp; We never had this haunting happening until
the shooting.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>husband has a pickup truck with the driver's door unworkable.&nbsp;
You cannot</b>
<br><b>open it because the door handle and the latch is broken.&nbsp; You
have to enter</b>
<br><b>and exit the truck thru the passenger's side.&nbsp; My husband stopped
by the</b>
<br><b>house to drop off a friend to watch the house since it's empty.&nbsp;
They both</b>
<br><b>went inside the house to discuss something.&nbsp; When my husband
got ready to</b>
<br><b>leave he noticed the cabin light was on in the truck.&nbsp; He looked
closer and</b>
<br><b>saw that the driver's door was wide open.&nbsp; The friend heard
nothing, I say</b>
<br><b>this because prior to the door breaking, it'd make a loud squeaking
noise</b>
<br><b>when you opened/shut it.&nbsp; We both feel it's the man who was
shot causing the</b>
<br><b>haunting.&nbsp; We'd like to know how to make him go away.&nbsp;
I've tried saying 'go</b>
<br><b>towards the light, you do not belong here, go to the light' but
nothing</b>
<br><b>worked.&nbsp; We are afraid that the future tenants will be haunted
by this</b>
<br><b>incident.&nbsp; Even this friend who has been house sitting says
it's been spooky</b>
<br><b>staying in the house with the doors opening/shutting and strange
things</b>

<p><b>Cheney's Graveyard</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:jeremiah025@hotmail.com</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>North Carolina-Gold Hill-Cheney's Graveyard-just down hwy 52 south
about 15</b>
<br><b>or so miles from interstate 85, there is a graveyard in a small
backwoods</b>
<br><b>town called Gold Hill. Its very hard to find and has been one of
those high</b>
<br><b>school legends that not many people hear about or really bother
to follow up</b>
<br><b>on, but youll get the occasional group of kids that go to validate
its</b>
<br><b>realism, and they usually get what they are looking for. Thats probably
why</b>
<br><b>its not visited that often...We decided to check this place out
about 1991,</b>
<br><b>my junior year in highschool, after hearing the usual gossip about
the place.</b>
<br><b>we found the cemetary after about 2 hours of driving around the
area in and</b>
<br><b>around the town, which was only 10 minutes from our home town, but
we were</b>
<br><b>fairly turned around from all those backroads. by this time it was
pretty</b>
<br><b>late and it was a starless, moonless night. we could just make out
the old</b>
<br><b>rockwal poking up from the weeds in the field of brush and occasional
dead</b>
<br><b>trees. now t!</b>
<br><b>he story was that a heretic woman back in the late 1800's bore a
devil child</b>
<br><b>with cloven feet and a forked tongue. the local people took the
infant,</b>
<br><b>drowned it in a horse trough, and put it in a small tomb type grave
that was</b>
<br><b>above the ground and sealed up with a big granite slab on the top.
the tomb</b>
<br><b>was there in the middle of the graveyard sticking up all by itself
with no</b>
<br><b>markings, with some earth inside of it and some weeds growing out
of it. thr</b>
<br><b>were deep gouges in the sides of the granite coffin that looked
to be as old</b>
<br><b>as it was. after we had decided we had seen enough and were headed
out of the</b>
<br><b>cemetary back to our vehicles parked way away at the road there
started a</b>
<br><b>shreiking that made our hair stand on end. animal or human we could
not</b>
<br><b>determine which. i said that is a fox scream...im sure of it but
what i meant</b>
<br><b>to say was lets get the hell out of here. in scrambling to get out
of the</b>
<br><b>graveyard and over the wall in the thick brush of the field we had
lost our</b>
<br><b>sence of!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;direction and had no clue which way we had came. we were very
panicked by</b>
<br><b>then and being that i and my friend were the only two men there,
it was hard</b>
<br><b>for us to maintain our wits. two of the girls started to cry and
get</b>
<br><b>hysterical after about 10 minutes of searching for our root in and
the</b>
<br><b>terrible noise getting ever closer. one other girl had completely
stopped</b>
<br><b>communicating and just sat right down on a stump and would not budge.
i told</b>
<br><b>my friend jeremy to stay with the girls and i would find the jeep
and get us</b>
<br><b>all out of there. i told them i was going to be right back and just
dont move</b>
<br><b>and keep the lights on so i could get to them. i ran straight through
the</b>
<br><b>woods in the direction that i thought we had came from and after
about a</b>
<br><b>quarter of a mile or so broke through the thick brush onto the dirt
road that</b>
<br><b>we drove in on. i took off towards the direction that i knew we
had parked</b>
<br><b>our vehicles and all the while the awful noise seemed to be right
beside of</b>
<br><b>me just in the wo!</b>
<br><b>ods. i stoppe once and heard the brush and dead sticks crackin a
little ways</b>
<br><b>in and heavy breathing and lost all&nbsp; coherance and began to
scream get away</b>
<br><b>go away you bastard quickly realizing i must be making it even worse
for my</b>
<br><b>companions stuck in the field. i sprinted the rest of the way which
was at</b>
<br><b>least half a mile down to the jeep where i jumped in and started
it up and</b>
<br><b>turned on all the four wheeling kc lights i had outfitted it with.
i turned</b>
<br><b>the jeep towards the wood line slowly to see if i could get a glimpse
of what</b>
<br><b>i was hearing but nothing...i floored the gas pedal then straight
through the</b>
<br><b>woods towards the cemetary knocking down saplings and small dead
trees as i</b>
<br><b>went bouncing up and down and driving like a maniac to get to my
friends. i</b>
<br><b>launched out of the woodline into the field and throwing up dirt
and weeds</b>
<br><b>behind me began to make my way to where i had left my group. i saw
the lights</b>
<br><b>flashing and waving for me and got there just as everyone seemed
to feel as!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;if the terrible thing that we could not see was about to be
upon them. with</b>
<br><b>6 people in the small jeep i spun around and charged back the way
i came</b>
<br><b>through the woods and out to the road. we sat in silence for a minute
trying</b>
<br><b>to hear if it was safe to get out to load up jennifers small honda.
after we</b>
<br><b>determined it was ok me and jeremy got out first to check and see
if the</b>
<br><b>coast was clear. no more shrieking was heard and after checking
under and</b>
<br><b>around the car we opened up the door to check inside and what we
saw still</b>
<br><b>makes my blood run cold today. the interior of the car had been
slashed and</b>
<br><b>gouged with stufing from the seats strewn all over the inside. the
dash was</b>
<br><b>marked and clawed as if a wild animal was let loose inside. needless
to say</b>
<br><b>we left the car and came back for it at daylight. i suggest if you
ever want</b>
<br><b>to validate my story, do not leave your doors unlocked and make
sure you have</b>

<br><b>Not To Frighten</b><b></b>
<p><b>BY: GRANDMASARK@email.msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>i'm not really sure if i would really consider this a ghost story.&nbsp;
what i consider to be a ghost story is:&nbsp; a story true or untrue that
is ment to scare you this is not ment to scare anyone.&nbsp; it is more
so to educate people that we are not the only beings, physical or non-physical,
on the earth.&nbsp; And weather you belive in gohsts or not you should
be aware of this.&nbsp; so her is my experiance.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when i was born my parents and my older brother
lived ona farm.&nbsp; and like most one family farmers we didn't have much
money.&nbsp; we lived in a trailer house that was pulled over the old foundation
of the farm house that used to set on the property.&nbsp; i am aware of
the fact that people find it unusual to remember anything before the age
of five, but as uncomman as it is i remmber things from aboutnthe age of
two. i can rememer that ener sence i can remeber i have been able to sence
when someone else is in the room.&nbsp; i can turn sround and some one
would be standing there.&nbsp; but the weiredest thing is when nobody is
standing there.&nbsp; okay i know that everyone has felt that before.&nbsp;
but this would get to the point that when i felt someone stading there
and i knew that theren was no possible way that any one could be.&nbsp;
like when i was sitting in a chair that was up against a wall and i knew
that there was no possilble way that some one caould be behind me, but
i could still feel the presence behind me.&nbsp; or when i would wake up
in the middle of the night for no reason and i knew that everyone else
in the house was asleep and could fell it.&nbsp; i know very few people
that can honestly say that this happens to them.&nbsp;&nbsp; well now i
have learned that i have a close tie to the spiritual side of the world.
i have a friend that is a medium and has informed me that of this bond
between me and the spiritual would, but she has no idea the purpose of
it.&nbsp; i never realized thst the way i can feel persence in a house
or area to be a close tie with the spiritual world.&nbsp; when i was younger
i thought the everyone could feel it. nothat i am older i know that everyone
does not feel it, especialy as strong as i do.&nbsp; i can walk into a
house for the first time and tell you if there is a osht present at the
time. weird yeah i know.&nbsp; adn believe me there are time that i wish
i couldn't do it.&nbsp; but there are a lot of things that about life that
people don'e like and just have to deal with anyways.&nbsp; well enough
about myself.&nbsp; the house that i lived in was well as people haunted.&nbsp;
what i am about to tell you my whole family and the people that witnessed
parts of it will say it to be true.&nbsp; no one was ever hurt and nothing
was ever destroyed mabe broken but not distroyed.&nbsp; one night when
i was probably about four years old i had my first encounter with the unseen
well somtimes seen but not usually.&nbsp; i was going though this stage
where i loved cardboard boxes,.&nbsp; i was in them all the time i would
make play houses out of them, eat in them, sleep in them, whatever.&nbsp;
well on this night for some reason my mother didn't let me.&nbsp; so i
took all the blankets that i had had in my rerigerator box and took theminto
my room and made my little "nest" on the floor to go to sleep.&nbsp; it
was probably about three or four in the morning when my mom and dad and
my brother came running onti my room because i was screaming a the top
of lungs.&nbsp; when the entered my room i was lying on the floor still
asleep mumbing something thrugh my tears that they were unablr to understand.&nbsp;
in my arms was this teddy bear the pink care bear with the rainbow that
was put on the top shelf because it was falling apart and i was no longer
allowed to play with it.&nbsp; there would have been no way that i wuld
have been able to reach or climb to get this bear wide awake let alone
in my sleep.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; another incident is that we had the ld cubord
door that you had to push the litle button to open.&nbsp; in the middle
of the night you could hear someone enter the house through the back door
and then walk down the hall way past my rooom and into the kitchen and
opent he cubord.&nbsp; the cubord being the way that they we had a very
distinct sound and you knew that it was what you were hearing thta is the
only thing that makes that noise. and then the water in the kitchen would
turn on and you would hear a glass being filed with water and then set
on the counter.&nbsp; my mom had gone too the kitchen in the middle of
the night thinking it was one of us kids and no one would be there.&nbsp;
the one thing that only happened a few time i never wittnessed was some
that just my mom would wittness was that when she was still awake and us
kids were asleep and my dad was out inthe barn at night.&nbsp; the hot
water in the bath tub turned on.&nbsp; the first time tht this happened
my mom heard it and once again thought it was either me or my brother up
at night.&nbsp; but when she went back to the bathroom the water would
be running and no one in the bathroom.&nbsp; she said that she checked
to see if we were asleep and we were.&nbsp; i can say in complete honesty
that i have never went into the bathroom at night and turned the water
on in the tub.&nbsp; when she told my dad what had happened he said that
it was probably jut the plumbing and mom had said that it wasn't because
she had gome in there and turned the water off.&nbsp; if it was a plumbing
prolblem the water would not have turned off by just turnig the knob.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the one thing that is the most distubing that
the my mom says that she has seen the ghost that was in our house or least
one of them i belive there to more than just one.&nbsp;&nbsp; when the
had moved into the house there was just two bedrooms.&nbsp; me and brother
who were still very yound had shared a room until my parent built the wall
in our rather large living room to make their room. and my aprents had
what was going to be my room.&nbsp; my mom being a light&nbsp; sleeper
was awoken bya noise and looked in the door of their rooma nd saw a shadow
in the door way.&nbsp; she said my dad names thinking that it was him,
and then realezed that he was still in bed.&nbsp; when she looked back
to the door way the figure was gone.&nbsp; she said that she really doesn't
remember what the figure looked like but she knew it was a man. just for
the record i would like to tell you that my mother is a strong beliver
in god and lives by his word which is no stealing obeying and her main
concern is no lying.&nbsp; i know you have no way knowing this except by
what i tell you but i do.&nbsp; there was other things like things coming
up missing and never ever being found and you cuold always hear people
walking in the hallway, day or night didn't matter and the pase and presure
og the steps would always change that is why i beliave that there was more
than one gohst in that house.&nbsp; we have longsence moved from that house
but the wierdest thing is that i feel the presence in the house that my
mom dad two addopted sisters and brother live in now.&nbsp; i know it is
the presence that i felt in the old house don't ask me how i know i just
do and there will be unexplained noises and thing missing or being moved
from time to time and the only person that realizes what it is, is my mother.</b>

<p><b>"GO TO THE FRONT DOOR NOW!"</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: JBanttari@ecx.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have been reading everyone else's stories and I thought I would
post mine.</b>
<br><b>I have had a few occurences happen to me starting as a child which
ended</b>
<br><b>after moving and nothing&nbsp; until a few years ago.&nbsp; This
event occurred 4</b>
<br><b>years ago but I often wonder what it was:</b>
<br><b>I decided one evening that I would go out with a friend and shoot
a little</b>
<br><b>pool and do a little drinking (I don't usually do this).&nbsp; Anyway,
we ended</b>
<br><b>up getting pretty wrecked and decided to call it a night.&nbsp;
We drove home (at</b>
<br><b>that time I lived in an apartment complex and my friend lived there
as well</b>
<br><b>down the way) and since her daughter was babysitting for me she
came</b>
<br><b>upstairs to my apartment and collected her daughter and went home.&nbsp;
I went</b>
<br><b>straight to bed and fell asleep.</b>
<br><b>I don't know exactly how long I had been asleep for but all I remember
was</b>
<br><b>being awakend by a very audible, loud, forceful voice and I will
never</b>
<br><b>forget the exact words.&nbsp; It said GO TO THE FRONT DOOR NOW!.
I don't remember</b>
<br><b>being frightened, I just remember that I felt that it was urgent.&nbsp;
I got up</b>
<br><b>and went to the front door and it was wide open.&nbsp; I went out
on the front</b>
<br><b>porch and looked down the stairs and my youngest son (who was then
only</b>
<br><b>about 2 yrs old)was going down the steps.&nbsp; I grabbed him as
he was about</b>
<br><b>half way down and took him back to bed with me.&nbsp; I remember
that it was</b>
<br><b>about 2:30 or so in the morning.</b>
<br><b>I installed a flip lock on the door and have been paranoid about
him doing</b>
<br><b>this again ever since. He never has. The reason that I explained
that I had</b>
<br><b>been drinking that night is that I don't believe that for any intensive</b>
<br><b>purpose, I should have woke up.&nbsp; I believe that I should have
been too</b>
<br><b>schnockerd!!.&nbsp; I did NOT dream this.&nbsp; I remember it clearly
as if it was</b>
<br><b>yesterday and wish I knew who/what it was.&nbsp; The apartment complex
that we</b>
<br><b>lived in at that time was a very bad neighborhood and was right
by major</b>
<br><b>streets and a freeway.&nbsp; What scares me to death is the thought
of what would</b>
<br><b>have happened had I not woken up when I did?&nbsp; That terrifies
me more than</b>
<br><b>anything else.&nbsp; Hope you enjoyed and thank you for letting
me share my story</b>
<br><b>with you.</b>

<p><b>THE GREENWOOD HILLS CEMETARY</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lilone@transport.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My second story takes place at a small cemetary not far from where
I live, the Greenwood Hills Cemetary. It's located in West Portland, Oregon
and sits next to a bigger cemetery, the Riverview, which overlooks the
Willametter River.</b>
<br><b>Back in 1987 I think it was, my two friends, Diana and her cousin,
Christine had told me about an old, abandoned cemetery around the corner
from where their aunt lived and they'd expressed interest in checking it
out, just for fun, so we did.</b>
<br><b>At the time it was in shambles. The grass and weeds had grown up
over headstones and with vandalism and natural wear and tear like moss,
had made some of the headstones nearly impossible to read. We walked around
the area and really felt bad that this cemetary had been left to look as
it did. These were people who&nbsp; time had forgotten. We had this crazy,
naive idea that we would try to fix it up, but soon discovered we had neither
the time nor the resources to do it.</b>
<br><b>The cemetery, to describe it, isn't fenced in..it's surrounded by
tall shrubs at the front area; you turn onto a dirt road as you enter the
cemetary to the left and there's a white house just off to the immediate
left as you enter, which has been fixed up considerably over the years
but seems to be for rent more often than not. I'll get to that though.
To the right of the house and back&nbsp; a little bit, maybe 400 feet,
is the crumbled remains of a small barn or shed and beyond that to the
right, is the cemetary itself. The dirt road in the cemetary is in the
shape of a lazy figure "8" and the road will take you all around the front
area, down a small hill, by a swamp-area and back to where the old cemetary
meets the Riverview's kept up cemetary (my two friends grandparents are
buried in this area). As you continue around the tiny road, big enough
for one car, it's flat until you come back by the swamp. The road then
goes up to the right and past the "boys in blue" section, which is where
several policeman, military, and according to the sign, a few Civil War
heros are buried. Beyond this area, is the old barn reminents and that
white house I'd mentioned.</b>
<br><b>We've gone to this cemetary quite a bit over the years to explore,
visit my friends' grandparents, and even do a graverubbing or two. It's
been fixed up considerably thanks to a society that had donated their time
to come and mow the grass, fix up the headstones, and remove some of the
overgrowth of trees and brush that was choking this area. Prior to all
this fixing up though, strange things have happened to us there and several
others as well over the years.</b>
<br><b>We've learned that the white house on the corner of the lot was
once owned by a family (I don't know the name) that ran the cemetary for
generations I suppose (I'm gonna have to research this and get back to
you). There's a door toward the backside of the house, in the basement
area that you can see from the road; they used to embalm people in the
basement and wheel them out to be buried in the cemetary. There's still
a drain in the floor down there today. I've not seen this but when the
house went up for rent a few years back, my friend went with her then boyfriend
to look and saw the drain in the floor. She said she felt creepy in the
basement and promptly left. Her father, when he was a teen in the 50's,
I guess knew the family that lived there and only spent the night once..he
refused to talk about it but said the experience scared him to death.</b>
<br><b>Now to share our strange experiences:</b>
<br><b>-my friend and I dared each other to look in the windows of that
white house when it was for rent and closed up. For the next three nights,
both of us had the exact same dream of being locked in that house, trying
frantically to get out and something was chasing us. These dreams were
identical, down the last detail.</b>
<br><b>-if you walk through the cemetary in the daytime or at dusk, you
can hear voices that are barely audible but sound as it they're muttering
in your ear. It sounds like 2 or three people but I've never been able
to make out any of the dialogue and there are areas where on a warm, summer
day, I've felt suddenly very cold.</b>
<br><b>-the spirits seem to like red cars. My friend's husband a few years
ago had a little junker pickup, a five-speed that would always die. When
he took the truck into the cemetary at night, he could put it in neutral
and not touching the foot peddals or the gear shift, the truck would drive
itself around that figure "8" drive, going down the hills, around the corners,
up the hill, etc. with no help from him what so ever. He said the truck
would die when it reached the hedges at the front entrance. He has several
witnesses that will back this.I drive a bright red '90 Geo Prizm and have
had more than one occurance where I've let my car be driven. We were leaving
late one night and I had followed my friend and her husband in their car.
They pulled out and continued around the road&nbsp; to the main entrance.
I got into my car and started it. It died at first, which it never did
before and it's an automatic.&nbsp; I started it up again and felt the
car lurch forward right as I put it into gear and saw the steeringwheel
move without my assistance. This is a flat area so the grooves in the road
don't explain this away because there are no grooves. The hair on the back
of my neck stood up and I suddenly felt like I wasn't alone. It was getting
very dark where I was on that stretch of road and I wanted out of there.
I finally muttered , " Fine. If you want to drive, just keep it on the
road." I took my hands off the steeringwheel and my foot off the gas peddal
and the car drove itself out of there- the steeringwheel moved by itself,
going all the way around when it needed to make a curve and the gas peddal
moved when it needed to! I called my friend later when I got home and told
her about this and she said, "I wondered why you drove so slow". She then
told me about her husband's truck.&nbsp; I've taken several people in there
to witness my car driving itself and have many witnesses, including my
own husband, who doesn't want to go back in there any time soon. He'd asked
at witnessing this first-hand, "My God, are you doing that?!" I asked him
how I could be if I wasn't touching anything!</b>
<br><b>-We've seen orbs flying around also...amber, white, red. I thought
they were my headlights but I make sure to turn my headlights off when
I enter the cemetary after dark. I also turn off my radio and encourage
my passengers that go with me to "open their eyes and open their minds".
They've seen them too.</b>
<br><b>-I've picked up many a ghostly passenger as well and I've got witnesses
to this too. We've all talked about feeling a presence in the back seat
when there was obviously no one there. We've deduced it's the spirit of
an older female who means no harm, but just wants a ride and maybe some
company.</b>
<br><b>-One night my friend Christine decided to drive through the cemetary
with myself and skeptical friend, Ann. This was in 1991, I think, shortly
after 2a.m. and were daring ourselves to drive in and see if anything would
happen. (I wasn't driving and Christine's car was yellow). As we got even
with the shrubs on either side of the front entrance, I noticed a sudden
feeling of ...I guess you'd call it hatred, evil. I told Christine, "My
God, do you feel that?!" She looked at me and said, "Yeah, it's coming
from the Boys in Blue section. It doesn't want us to be here."&nbsp; I
looked toward that section and saw a blue, glowing light, which was strange
because there are no street lights back there and aren't for miles in that
direction. My friend in the backseat, Ann started to whimper, "We gotta
get out of here! Please! Let's just go! It's coming!" (Remember, Ann is
a skeptic.) Christine looks at me and yells, "I think she's right!" She
put the car into reverse and we sped out of there but...it followed us.
I remember looking out the side mirror and the blue light was over the
car!&nbsp; I started shaking, "It's still here!" I was yelling and Christine
was whispering, " I know."&nbsp; Ann is hysterical at this point and we
had to tell her to shut up, we were almost home. When we got to Christine's
apartment, it was still there with us. We all yelled, "Run and don't look
back!" We got into her apartment and huddled together on the couch til
it finally went away.</b>
<br><b>The Greenwood Hills Cemetary has been fixed up quite a bit over
the years and looks like a nice, well kept cemetary but I wonder...I recently
went back in the daytime but experienced nothing. I'm itching to go back
at night. I'll keep ya updated.</b>

<p><b>FROSTY</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lilone@transport.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Is it common to be visited by the spirit of a dead pet? We had a
pure white cat with green eyes when I was younger (ages 10-13) named, Frosty.
My brother and I had each got to pick out a kitten from my father's aunt's
cat since we'd just moved from an apartment into a house. I chose a long-haired
orange cat and my younger brother chose Frosty. To try to condense this
story, my cat eventually ran away and Frosty, who was very skittish of
everyone but me, stayed with us for three years. He was an outdoor tom
cat and like I said, was very skittish. I was the only one whom he'd let
me pick him up as he trusted only me.</b>
<br><b>We went to Disneyland that summer and right before we left, I noticed
Frosty had a giant sore on his head but thought he'd just been in a scrap
with another cat. I felt guilty for leaving him but we had friends who
would feed him and the prospect of Disneyland pushed the thought from my
head.</b>
<br><b>Needless to say, we never saw Frosty again....alive anyway. I'd
say about 3 months or so went by and I was very worried about him. I wondered
if he was dead or just making his tom-cat rounds and was taking a longer
time about it.</b>
<br><b>One night, I was in bed, just drifting off to sleep when I felt
something jump on my waterbed. I thought it was strange because we didn't
have any pets at that time (my orange cat had since ran off) but I wasn't
really scared, just curious. I opened my eyes and saw Frosty sitting there
on the rail of my bed looking at me. He was sitting there with his feet
curled up under him and he didn't have the sore on his head anymore and
his fur wasn't the dingy-white color of an outdoor cat. It didn't even
register at the time that I hadn't seen him in months and no one could
have let him in and not told me. I remember muttering, "Hi, Frosty." He
then, sat up, and walked past me, along the padded rail of the bed and
darted behind my headboard where he jumped to the floor. That's when I
jumped up and turned on the light to see if I could find him. I searched
all over that room and never found anything, not even cat fur. I asked
my parents if they'd let Frosty in that night but they looked at me so
funny that I never brought it up again. Was he coming back to let me know
he was okay? I still tear up at this memory.</b>

<p><b>Ghosts!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:acook_nz@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi I just came across your sight and it is very</b>
<br><b>interesting,I'm down in New Zealand(bottom of the</b>
<br><b>world).I've got a couple of things I'd like to tell</b>
<br><b>you.Now I'm not nutcase and I consider myself to be a</b>
<br><b>healthy resonable thinking person.When I was about 14</b>
<br><b>one night I woke up with a very disturbing fear I had</b>
<br><b>a sense of something very bad was happening,this was</b>
<br><b>around 3am,I could almost describe it as terrifying,it</b>
<br><b>was like I could see the outline of two figures in my</b>
<br><b>room(there was no substance) and the light was very</b>
<br><b>much on!!,the next morning when I went to school it</b>
<br><b>was announced that two of our pupils had commited</b>
<br><b>suicide,it was a little later that I found out it was</b>
<br><b>250 metres from where I live,across the street there</b>
<br><b>are houses which back onto a creek and on the other</b>
<br><b>side of the creek there is a dirt road,It appears they</b>
<br><b>got high and then gased themselves in the car.I can</b>
<br><b>look straight out my window and see where this</b>
<br><b>happened.There is no doubt in my mind that some kind</b>
<br><b>of ESP or what have you took place,it is something</b>
<br><b>that has always bothered me.</b>
<br><b>Ghosty stuff part 2</b>
<br><b>About five years ago strange things started to happen</b>
<br><b>at home,doors slaming,bathroom light turning on,tv</b>
<br><b>turned on(was not plugged in!!!!!!)I thought it was</b>
<br><b>just me until my sister turned around and</b>
<br><b>said"something is in this house" all this heightened</b>
<br><b>when a friend of mine commited suicide and continued</b>
<br><b>in a strong fashion for a couple of months,I could</b>
<br><b>often here a noise like someone was walking and</b>
<br><b>wearing</b>
<br><b>canvas pants(that sound of when they rub together)but</b>
<br><b>the thing that got me the most was when I was at the</b>
<br><b>end of the hallway and my dog was at the other end in</b>
<br><b>the doorway of the living room,it started to bark at</b>
<br><b>something in the corner of the room as if someone was</b>
<br><b>there(all the lights were off)then it just stopped and</b>
<br><b>whimpered alot and jumped in bed with me,but something</b>
<br><b>had spooked it,I often wonder what did it see!!.</b>
<br><b>LESS SPOOKY PART 3</b>
<br><b>We live near a creek that connects to a freshwater</b>
<br><b>river that connects to the open sea,when I was about</b>
<br><b>five we always played down at the river(my brothers</b>
<br><b>etc)One day we saw something move up and to the</b>
<br><b>surface just beside the bank,it was the most amazing</b>
<br><b>creature I have ever seen and in my memories it became</b>
<br><b>burned as a mythical creature,well it took about</b>
<br><b>twenty years to find out what I saw was about a three</b>
<br><b>metre oarfish,a great memory and not something you see</b>
<br><b>everyday..</b>

<p><b>Ghosts or Imagination?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bambi@hdtinfo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>We moved into a house we were renting. I was 11 or 12 at the time.
My sister</b>
<br><b>was on a date and I was babysitting. I got home around midnight
or so and</b>
<br><b>went in to my parents bedroom to let them know I was home and going
to bed.</b>
<br><b>I was lying there in bed around 12:30 a.m. or so, I heard someone
coming up</b>
<br><b>the stairs, I just assumed it was my sister. I rolled over and listened
for</b>
<br><b>her to head to her room. The footsteps were light and getting closer,
(my</b>
<br><b>room was at the top of the stairs). The footsteps stoped at my door,
I</b>
<br><b>rolled over and said "yes, what do you want?" I got no reply. I
thought she</b>
<br><b>was trying to scare me, so I turned on the light, noone was there.
I shut</b>
<br><b>the light back off and laid there staring up at the ceiling. I heard</b>
<br><b>someone, or something, walk across my room, my fan, which was across
the</b>
<br><b>room on my dresser, came on all of a sudden, it turned onto medium
than off,</b>
<br><b>than to slow than fast and back off! I sat straight up in bed and
flipped</b>
<br><b>the light, thinking, boy I've got you know you little stinker. There
was</b>
<br><b>NOONE there!!</b>
<br><b>About an hour later I heard footsteps again, this time I hid under
my</b>
<br><b>covers. The light came on in the hall way, my sister was standing
there</b>
<br><b>looking into my room. (I was never so happy to see her). She asked
if I was</b>
<br><b>ok.. I must of been white as white could be. I said yes.. She asked
me to</b>
<br><b>turn the light off once she got to her room and flipped on her switch.
I</b>
<br><b>said ok..</b>
<br><b>Later that night I heard footsteps go by my room and walking towards
my</b>
<br><b>sisters. I figured it was one of my parents probably coming up to
make sure</b>
<br><b>my sister was home. About 15 minutes later I heard my sister get
up and come</b>
<br><b>into my room asking what I wanted? I looked at her blankly and asked
"what</b>
<br><b>do you mean, I've been here all night, in my own bed!" She got a
startled</b>
<br><b>look on her face and asked if I wanted to sleep with her (let me
just say</b>
<br><b>this, my sister is 5 yrs. older than me and she was scared!! this
is new...)</b>
<br><b>I got up and went into her room and slept in her bed with her, listening
to</b>
<br><b>all the noses. As we were lying there talking we heard footsteps
coming up</b>
<br><b>the stairs. She looked at me and said "you here that?" I said "yep,
how can</b>
<br><b>I not here it". A figure appeared in the door, we both jumped alittle.
My</b>
<br><b>sister said "yes, we are both in here". The figure turned and walked
away.</b>
<br><b>The next morning when we went downstairs, my parents had asked when
everyone</b>
<br><b>had gotten home. I said around midnight, my sister said around 1
or so. My</b>
<br><b>parents looked at my sister and asked why she came in the house
and left</b>
<br><b>again around 11:30 or so? My sister looked at me and looked at my
parents</b>
<br><b>and said, I didn't. My mom proceeded to tell us that they heard
someone come</b>
<br><b>in around 11:30, but noone came into their room, so dad got up to
see which</b>
<br><b>one of us girls was home. He said he didn't see shoes or anything
in the</b>
<br><b>door, so he went upstairs and saw noone. So he figured it had to
be my</b>
<br><b>sister, and she came home to get something. My sister and I just
looked at</b>
<br><b>each other and said "what else did you hear?" My mom looked at us,</b>
<br><b>strangely, and said, "well I thought I heard one of you girls go
upstairs".</b>
<br><b>The hair on the back of my neck stood straight up on end.</b>
<br><b>>From that day on, my sister and I always heard someone walking
around</b>
<br><b>upstairs and coming downstairs. Needless to say, there were a LOT
of nights</b>
<br><b>we slept in the same bed, hiding under the covers. To this day we
don't know</b>
<br><b>if it was our dad, who was killed in a car accident 2 yrs. earlier,
or the</b>
<br><b>man who had lived there before us, who died of a heartattack. The
figure, a</b>
<br><b>mans figure, never bothered our step-sister. It was like this man
was</b>
<br><b>checking up on my sister and I.</b>
<br><b>To this day I hear a man's voice. I swear he had followed me. I
am married</b>
<br><b>with 2 girls of my own. If I sit with the baby monitor on to hear
my</b>
<br><b>youngest, I can here a man talking softly. I can't hear what exactly
he is</b>
<br><b>saying, but I can hear him talking. I guess I will never lose this
ghost, he</b>
<br><b>has never tried to hurt me, but he makes himself known. I have seen
objects</b>
<br><b>move, heard him talking to my oldest and youngest and felt his soft
hand on</b>
<br><b>my face as I sleep.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ghosts in my Bedroom</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Boyerjb@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was about 4 or 5 years old (1978/79) I lived in a trailer
park.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>remember one night I was or thought I was dreaming.&nbsp; (I still
don't know to</b>
<br><b>this day weather it was a dream or not.)&nbsp; In my "dream" there
were white</b>
<br><b>figures standing beside my bunk-bed.&nbsp; They were the size of
an average person</b>
<br><b>in height and size. (I always slept on the top bunk.)&nbsp; I remember
talking to</b>
<br><b>them but the only thing I remeber actually saying was asking them
if they</b>
<br><b>would catch me if I rolled off the bed.&nbsp; They replied to me
with a nod.&nbsp; They</b>
<br><b>may have also said yes, I'm not sure though.</b>
<br><b>I then rolled off the bed and the white figures started to pass
me down to</b>
<br><b>the ground.&nbsp; If I remember right there were shorter figures
also.&nbsp; They may</b>
<br><b>have been children or they may have been kneeling.&nbsp; While they
passed me to</b>
<br><b>one another I felt happy and safe but then it occured to me that
I was being</b>
<br><b>held by "ghosts" so I screamed.&nbsp; I hit the ground infront of
my closet that</b>
<br><b>was probably about 4 or 5 feet away from my bed.&nbsp; I "woke up"
when I hit the</b>
<br><b>ground and started laughing.</b>
<br><b>The next morning my dad told me that he had heard me scream.&nbsp;
He said he</b>
<br><b>jumped out of his bed, ran down the hallway, which was probably
about 10-12</b>
<br><b>feet long maybe longer and got to my room before I hit the floor.&nbsp;
He said</b>
<br><b>when I hit I was almost inside the closet.&nbsp; I had bounced and
then rolled the</b>
<br><b>last few inches into the closet laughing.</b>
<br><b>I do not remember this conversation with my dad the next morning
but I have</b>
<br><b>asked him about it on numerous occasions just because I still can't
beleive</b>
<br><b>what happened.</b>
<br><b>Here is another story</b>
<br><b>My Sister</b>
<br><b>This one did not happen to me and since I still don't think that
my dad has</b>
<br><b>told me the whole story I can only give you what I know about it.</b>
<br><b>I was 7 years old, my sister was 2.&nbsp; We were now living in
a two story house</b>
<br><b>that my parents had bought after my sister was born.&nbsp; My parents
slept</b>
<br><b>upstairs and me and my sister were downstairs.&nbsp; One night I
remember my dad</b>
<br><b>running down the stairs past my room and into my sisters room.&nbsp;
I jumped out</b>
<br><b>of bed and went to see what was wrong.&nbsp; My dad was holding
my sister and she</b>
<br><b>was crying.&nbsp; I asked him what happened.&nbsp; He told me that
my sister was</b>
<br><b>choking on a small ring that she had left in her bed.&nbsp; I still
think that my</b>
<br><b>dad had some sort of vision or visitor that brought this near tragedy
to my</b>
<br><b>fathers attention.</b>
<br><b>The main reason that this freaked me out was because my room was
right next</b>
<br><b>to hers and my parents room was upstairs on the other side of the
house and I</b>
<br><b>had not heard anything.</b>
<br><b>The weirdest thing about this is that my entire family on my mothers
side has</b>
<br><b>brown hair and brown eyes, including me.&nbsp; My sister and one
of my cousins</b>
<br><b>both have blonde hair and blue eyes, they are the only exception.&nbsp;
The same</b>
<br><b>thing had happened to my blonde/blue cousin when she was 2, only
she had</b>
<br><b>choked on a penny not a ring.</b>
<br><b>There are too many coinecedences that have happened to my sister
and my</b>
<br><b>cousin to remember.&nbsp; I only remember this one because my sister
almost died.</b>
<br><b>My blonde/blue cousin had a set of twins a few years back and since
then I</b>
<br><b>have jokingly told my sister that she would have a set of twins
someday.</b>
<br><b>This past summer I found out that my grandmother on my fathers side
was a</b>
<br><b>twin and that twins on my fathers side of the family skip a generation.</b>
<br><b>There are no twins on my mothers side of the family at all except
for the</b>
<br><b>ones that my blonde/blue cousin has.&nbsp; I'll let you know if
my sister ever has</b>
<br><b>twins.&nbsp; I'm sure she will.</b>

<p><b>Ghosts Follow Me</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jvparker1@email.msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was little I lived way out in the country. The area I lived
in had a spooky sense to it. The house next door had been built by an aunt
&amp; uncle of mine who later abondoned it; next door to it was a cemetery.
About 1/4 of a mile back livedmy greatgrandparents. They had a farm; my
greatgreatgrandparents are buried on this farm by a creek with flat rocks
for tomb-stones. I was always theone you would find trying to scare myself,
I thought mothing could scare me.One night on our way home from a school
play I saw a white shadowy figure in the drive-way of the cemetery. The
next day I went to the cemetery to see if I could spark my memory of detail.
I walked over there and read every tomb-stone; when I came to the very
last one I remembered the whole appearance of the ghost - and more. She
was wearing a white dress, like from the 1800's, she had on a white crochet
bonnet and I later discovered her name, but it's best not mentioned. That
day I called one of my friends and she said this ghost was kind of a peice
of town history, alot of people had seen it. I kept on seeing her, even
now when I go out there I see her. I moved to a large town in the summer
between 5th &amp; 6th grade, but not before i had seen ghosts even closer
to home. One night - afew months before I moved - I went outside, I don't
know why I went outside, I just did. I walked out in past the 12ft. bush
and the trailer that had served as my parents' factory afew years before.
I looked over towards the abondoned house, there were no cars in the driveway,
no lights on downstairs, no way to safely get to the house-much less inside.
Then, I looked up towards the 2nd story window, I saw a light on (the power
in the house had been cut off), I saw black figures in the window sipping
something from tall glasses and laughing. I've been in the yard of that
house one time since. When I was about seven, there was a tornado watch;
we all went up to my greatgrandparents' house. That night me and one of
my cousins spent the night there. She's only 2 months younger than me.we
slept in a bed that had an old black and white picture above it. Wee, we
laid. We couldn't sleep that night. We both felt some strange, creepy feeling
that we had never got before in that bed. Afew years ago,my stepgranddad
died in a recliner at his lakehouse. I got abunch of books that were his.
when I opened the box, It was like I opened memories that came with a cold
feeling that hasn't left since. Even last week when it was 90degrees outside
I was shivering from chills down the back of my neck. Lately it's gotten
worse. Afew weeks ago at school we were taking pictures and I posed by
this tree/memorial of a boy that died there last year. In the sixth grade
I beacme great friends with a substitute teacher. she died when I was in
the 7th gr. I see her almost everywhere. Strangest part is I run into ghosts
everywhere I go.</b>

<p><b>Ghosts Everywhere</b><b></b>

<p><b>I moved to Minnesota when I was 14, I'm 15. My family owned a plantation
in</b>
<br><b>Louisiana, and that's where my Mom, my dad, my sister, and myself
lived.</b>
<br><b>naturally plantations are going to be haunted, but not quite like
ours. I</b>
<br><b>think my first experience with a ghost was when I was 5. I was taking
a bath,</b>
<br><b>and my Mom had gone to get a towel from the dryer. I dunked my head,
and when</b>
<br><b>I came back up, there was a very faint lady sitting on the toilet.
Very</b>
<br><b>old-fashioned looking, she was smiling at me. When my Mom was walking
up the</b>
<br><b>stairs she vanished. I've had Numerous experiences with them, but
the one</b>
<br><b>that sticks in my mind is this. my Mom had two statues of angels
in the</b>
<br><b>parlor. One of me, and one of my sister. Whenever one of us did
something</b>
<br><b>bad, someone or something would turn it backwards to tell my Mom.&nbsp;
I was</b>

<p><b>Ghosts at a Wilderness Camp</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jgrit@brinet.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was living and working at a year-round, therapeutic wilderness
camp for teenage boys in Tennessee and had several different experiences
with ghosts and ghost-like phenomena.&nbsp; I had never believed in ghosts
before these experiences.&nbsp; I was among the skeptics, until about a
year ago in July of 1999.</b>
<br><b>It all started one night when my female co-counselor and I were
putting the kids to bed in their tents.&nbsp; After the kids were down,
she turned to me and asked if I had heard the voices.&nbsp; I didn't know
what she was talking about, and she went on to describe the voices that
she had heard, coming from the woods several yards behind our tent.&nbsp;
I laughed at her and attributed "the voices" to wasps flying around or
the wind rustling the trees.</b>
<br><b>About a week later, when my male co-counselor and I had finished
putting the kids to bed, I was sitting on the front porch of my tent (the
tents were permanent structures, kind of like army field tents) playing
my guitar.&nbsp; My co-counselor had walked off down the trail into the
darkness, toward the main campsite area and the service road.&nbsp; I began
to hear people talking, so I stopped playing to listen, thinking that the
kids were awake and fooling around.&nbsp; However, the talking was not
coming from the tent area, but rather from behind me, back into the woods.&nbsp;
It sounded like two men carrying on a conversation in low tones, and I
could almost make out what they were saying, but I couldn't quite hear
it.&nbsp; About 20 minutes later my co-counselor returned, and I asked
him what he and our group supervisor had been talking about.&nbsp; He looked
at me like I was crazy and said that he had left campsite altogether and
that he hadn't even seen our supervisor.&nbsp; At that point, I began to
wonder.</b>
<br><b>The experiences continued.&nbsp; About a week later I was lying
on my cot in my tent, getting ready to fall asleep, when my female co-counselor,
covering the group with me, and I both heard talking again. I shot up and
looked over the side of the tent (the walls were only about 3 feet high,
so there was a gap of about 4 feet to the ceiling) and looked straight
in the direction of the sound.&nbsp; The voices continued, but this time
there were footsteps coming up the path toward my tent, which passed me,
and headed directly for the first kids' tent, then disappeared off into
the woods.&nbsp; I heard the footfall on the packed dirt and leaves but
never saw a thing in the dim light of the night fire.&nbsp; I was scared
spitless and cowered under my covers, just like in the Scooby Doo cartoons.</b>
<br><b>The next night, as my co-counselor and I were preparing for bed,
we were laughing and joking around about her stuff that was strewn all
about the tent.&nbsp; She commented that she would straighten it in the
morning.&nbsp; When we woke up the next morning, the first thing she did
was thank me for straightening her things.&nbsp; I told her that I hadn't
touched them; I had been sound asleep all night, but her backpack was packed
neatly and propped in the corner.</b>
<br><b>The following week, my female co-counselor and I got switched to
another group, living in a campsite about 500 yards away, down into a ravine,
from our original site.&nbsp; The group that we had been in left property
altogether to go on a 3 1/2 week wilderness trip.&nbsp; One night, as we
were having the last pow-wow bonfire with our new group, my co-counselor,
who was sitting directly across from me, shot her head up and looked intently
in the direction of our old campsite, which you could just barely see at
the top of the hill.&nbsp; She looked at me, wild-eyed, and motioned with
her eyes that I should look up there.&nbsp; I did; the night fire was burning,
but no one had been there to light it for about a week.</b>
<br><b>Two nights later, again after the kids had gone to bed, my co-counselor
and I were up writing performance profiles on the kids and evaluating about
our group, when we heard a truck drive past out campsite on the service
road and head up toward the dead end, about a 1/4 mile away, where there
was a third group campsite.&nbsp; We assumed that it was our supervisor
checking on groups, as he often did this time at night.&nbsp; After awhile,
we heard the truck again, heading back toward our campsite.&nbsp; He stopped
directly in front of the main path leading into our site, about 30 yards
away, got out of his truck, and walked down the dirt path toward our tent.&nbsp;
The footfalls stopped right next to the tent.&nbsp; Our heads shot up over
the side of the tent to greet him, but he was not there.&nbsp; Immediately
my co-counselor jumped over the back of the tent and ran down the path
to check the service road.&nbsp; The truck was gone.</b>
<br><b>Several months later, after I had been switched to another group
on the other side of our camp property, one of the kids from my original
group was moved over to my new group.&nbsp; One night we began talking
about different things, and the conversation led to fears.&nbsp; He began
to tell me that ever since he had been living in my first group, he never
went to the bathroom at night.&nbsp; He went on to say that the reason
was because one night, when he got up to go, he saw a man dressed in confederate
Civil War-like dress walking back and forth across my tent porch, like
he was pacing, and then disappear off of the porch into the woods.&nbsp;
He saw this man on several different occasions when he would wake up in
the middle of the night; sometimes the man would stand over the night fire
and just gaze at it.&nbsp; Other times he would pace back and forth on
my porch, or walk up the path and disappear into the darkness.&nbsp; Once,
he said, he was joined by another man in a union uniform, and both of them
stood next to the night fire and stared directly in the direction of his
tent.&nbsp; I had never once mentioned my own experiences to any of the
kids, and I can attest to the fact that, while this teenager was in my
new group, I never heard him get up to go to the bathroom in the middle
of the night.</b>
<br><b>How real was all of this?&nbsp; I can only testify to my own experiences
for certain, and they were very real.&nbsp; On several occasions, before
and after my own experiences, I would have conversations with other counselors
in various other campsites that would share similar experiences.&nbsp;
Of course, before I heard anything myself, I would laugh at them and think
that they were foolish.&nbsp; I know now that they were not so foolish,
because my own experiences were too real for me to believe otherwise.&nbsp;
Later on that year, as my responsibilities changed and I was the one going
around checking groups, I would often walk the trails at night with no
flashlight (I had discovered that my senses were greatly heightened with
continuous lack of artificial light), and when I passed certain spots along
the trail, particularly near the two "haunted" campsites, I would experience
cold chills and the eerie feeling that there was something else there.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I compared notes with another counselor who would do the same thing.&nbsp;
He happened to be deeply into spiritualism, and he would get similar feelings
at the exact same places.</b>

<p><b>Ghosts Around My Family</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: BonnieWalsh@webtv.net]</b><b></b>
<p><b>Dave, I dont knowif you can help me or not. I believemyself as well
as</b>
<br><b>some of my other family members have some sort of ability in being
in</b>
<br><b>contact with ghosts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will give you sme background
information o</b>
<br><b>myself and my family. First my family. In the 1950`s my grandfather
was</b>
<br><b>working at a factory, he had his fingers on bot hands cot off. In</b>
<br><b>another state his mother woke up screaming, shehad seen in her dream</b>
<br><b>what had happened. This was my great grandmother. She had a nephew
that</b>
<br><b>was working for neutragena soap as a&nbsp; inventor. He gave all
fo us in the</b>
<br><b>family soap. Well when I was 10 years old ( this was in the 1970s)
My</b>
<br><b>mother called me into the bathroom, she asked me to look at the
soap, to</b>
<br><b>tell her if I saw anything. I told her it looked like a skull and
cross</b>
<br><b>bones. She said thats what she had seen. I then told her that grandma</b>
<br><b>had died. She told me she knew that. ( grandma had died) One year
after</b>
<br><b>that I hadnt seen my grandfather and kiss him good bye since&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the</b>
<br><b>weekend( I spent every weekend with him, and my grandmother,( this
was</b>
<br><b>on my fathers side) since I was an infant). I said he was going&nbsp;
die</b>
<br><b>becouse I didnt kiss him .About 4pm my mother got a ca ll&nbsp;
that he was</b>
<br><b>at the hospital. She got me a babysitter. I started to cry . Mom
sad</b>
<br><b>alwould be fine.I said no grandpa died. He had died. He came&nbsp;
me to me</b>
<br><b>that night. He touched me, then stood at the end of my bed. He told
me</b>
<br><b>he didnt die becouse I didnt kiss him, that all would be fine, and
that</b>
<br><b>he loved me. My mother told me that one day befor he died she dreamed</b>
<br><b>her room turned into a funeral parlor, that inside the casket was</b>
<br><b>grandpa. During both my mothers and my lives, everytime a picture
fell</b>
<br><b>off the wall, or a bird hit the window, and died, someone we knew
would</b>
<br><b>die.If the bird didnt die, someone was just very sick.The most recent</b>
<br><b>thing to hapen was we had a photo of a map on the wall fall on the
floor</b>
<br><b>and shatter. I knew someone had died. It was my uncle who along
with my</b>
<br><b>grandfather (my mothers side) owned Twin Pines Milk. He was from</b>
<br><b>roseville , the map was a roseville map. My whole life I go into</b>
<br><b>certain old places .For instance&nbsp; I livein Holly Michigan (
its full of</b>
<br><b>old buildings, 2 stories or more) I went to 2 old buildings that
were</b>
<br><b>turned into antique shops, I went in and started to feel sick to
my</b>
<br><b>stomach. each floor I felt worse. By the time I&nbsp; came to he
3rd floor</b>
<br><b>the hair n my arms were standing up, I was told I looked green,
I felt a</b>
<br><b>breeze that made my hair move , but no one saw or felt it. Im notable
to</b>
<br><b>go to that store any more, I even felt like someone was squeezing
my</b>
<br><b>chest. I&nbsp; feel like somethings following me. When I lived at
another</b>
<br><b>location I was in another room watching a movie with my family ,
we</b>
<br><b>heard a noise, I went into the kitchen to see, a bottl of my mdication</b>
<br><b>hat I set on he sink had blown its top off, and the pills were all
over</b>
<br><b>the floor. That same night my brother had lost a tooth, he set it
on the</b>
<br><b>sink near my pills. It was a back molar. We sat down to watch the
movie</b>
<br><b>again. We heard a noise again, this time it was my brothers tooth,
it</b>
<br><b>had exploded into to 2 pieces One ended up onthe floor, while the
other</b>
<br><b>was on the floor. They were both on thir sides, and each looked
like the</b>
<br><b>number 3. Now for the rest of my story at my present location. I
live in</b>
<br><b>the country, across from a state park, I have a small lake , and
a bit</b>
<br><b>of property. Certain parts of the property I get a strange feeling
like</b>
<br><b>someones watching me. I turn, at tmes I see a black blurr.I have
some</b>
<br><b>antique furniture In one room , Its this room that We seem to have&nbsp;
some</b>
<br><b>problems. My son sees blood red eyes that chase him. He also sees
small</b>
<br><b>balls of light that go all over the room. He wont go in that room
at</b>
<br><b>night, or even past it with out all the lights on and someone with</b>
<br><b>him.(hes 11 and told us what he saw since he could talk). We hav
a</b>
<br><b>family room that has 3 walls . One wall has&nbsp; a fire place,
while the</b>
<br><b>other 2 have large windows. My son, my mother and myself see a man</b>
<br><b>walking past the windows, he is tall, thin, with a long black coat,and</b>
<br><b>black hat. We cant see his face. We also see some small black thing
go</b>
<br><b>fast from this room to the room I spoke of earlyer . we all have
asked</b>
<br><b>if our own cat was running around. But it was this black thing.
When I</b>
<br><b>walk down a hallway the photos move, or fall off the wall. When
Im with</b>
<br><b>someone I can tell if they will soon die.We now for over 2 years
have</b>
<br><b>had phone problems, the phone company has given up, The phones burn
out,</b>
<br><b>as do the cords, The phone rings, and dosnt show up on the caller
id.</b>
<br><b>weve had light bulbs explode. Weve even had the electric company
come</b>
<br><b>out. They cant find a problem. Weve gone through at least 25 phones,</b>
<br><b>plus cords.Were at our witts end.&nbsp; We had a garage sale this
year, a</b>
<br><b>woman said she was drawn to ` this house, that she saw a horse pulling
a</b>
<br><b>wagon full of stones. That a stone house was built near here, she
also</b>
<br><b>saw a man in the wagon with the same decription of the man we see.
That</b>
<br><b>we have a strong magnetic field,that we live on a vortex, that people</b>
<br><b>from the oter side are constantly pass through. I investigated about
the</b>
<br><b>stone house. It was located where the state land is now located.
We</b>
<br><b>found parts of the house, and piles of rocks. We also have a radio
that</b>
<br><b>comes on by itself. All this plus more things continue to happen
to us.</b>
<br><b>Im really getting upset. Anything you could to or tell me would
help.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ghosts are All Over</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: d_martin@wmur.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello there. My name is Derek. I have experianced the paranormal
ever since</b>
<br><b>I was a little lad. I'm now 25.&nbsp; I could write all day about
experiances but</b>
<br><b>i'll sum it down.&nbsp; It all started where I was born, Queens
NY.&nbsp; Our old</b>
<br><b>house there always kept us buisy. Constant doors slamming shut,
noises such</b>
<br><b>as people talking, even noises you can't explain Visual sightings
were big</b>
<br><b>as well. Take for instance the spring day when my mother was going
down the</b>
<br><b>basement to do the laundry. (standing at the top of the staircase
you could</b>
<br><b>see a window before you then turn to go down the rest of the stairs.)
Well,</b>
<br><b>she was going downstairs not paying much attention and noticed the
curtains</b>
<br><b>in the window were blowing. Not thinking about it she passed the
curtains</b>
<br><b>and felt a breeze thinking it must be chilly today. She got to the
bottom</b>
<br><b>and the stairs and it clicked in, there are no curtains in the window.
She</b>
<br><b>turned around and nothing was there. Things like that happened alot.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>spirits, I used plural because they were distinctive attitudes in
them like</b>
<br><b>one was an older gentleman and one was a playful girl and i'm sure
there</b>
<br><b>were more. They seemed to follow my brother alot. My brother when
he was</b>
<br><b>little always saw uneplainable things such as peoples auras, he
always knew</b>
<br><b>when my parents were mad by seeing red around them and if they were
relaxed</b>
<br><b>he'd see blue. He used to tell my parents what color he would see.&nbsp;
Another</b>
<br><b>gift he had was seeing things before they happened. Although these
things he</b>
<br><b>saw he saw happening to him. He supposidly didn't know how to use
these</b>
<br><b>powers so someone said he must grow into them. He never really cared
to .</b>
<br><b>But for example, We were in the backyard of our house playing and
he ran</b>
<br><b>into the house crying. My mom finally calmed him down and he said
that a</b>
<br><b>plane was going to crash in our back yard and kill us. Ironically
a plane</b>
<br><b>out West in the news that night said a plane crashed in the back
yard of a</b>
<br><b>farm house killing two children playing and all on board . Another
incident</b>
<br><b>was at our home now in New Hampshire. Up to a few months ago I was
living in</b>
<br><b>Londonderry. I recently got married and i'm now elsewhere in New
Hamshire</b>
<br><b>not far. Anyway, There are apple orchards in my back yard and my
friends and</b>
<br><b>I dirtbiked back there faithfully everday. One day in 1989 my brother
told</b>
<br><b>me don't go back there today. He would not let me go until I promised
him</b>
<br><b>that I would not go back there. I finally prmiced him. That day
there was a</b>
<br><b>man murdered back in the very spot we hung out during our dirt bike
breaks.</b>
<br><b>He was shot over what was belived to be drug related. So now when
he tells</b>
<br><b>me stuff I will listen. Any, back to the ghosts. In 1992 Our high
school</b>
<br><b>band participated in the Rosebowl parade . The time time of my life
I tell</b>
<br><b>you. When I got back my mother told me they're back. Then she proceed
to</b>
<br><b>tell me about what happened. Back then My dad worked weird hours
and he</b>
<br><b>would come in late and he had the habit to check up on us. We always
knew</b>
<br><b>when he got home because he always wore a million keys on his belt
and you</b>
<br><b>could hear them jingle. Well, like clockwork my brother heard those
damn</b>
<br><b>keys which he called them. He was acting like he was asleep so dad
would let</b>
<br><b>him be. Then he felt my dad sit on the bed. What the @#@#@ he thought.
Then</b>
<br><b>it dawned on him that side of the bed was against the wall. At this
point I</b>
<br><b>would of been out of that room with my feet never touching the ground
but my</b>
<br><b>brother tured his light on and there was an indent on his bed as
though</b>
<br><b>someone was sitting there then the indent popped up he heard the
keys for a</b>
<br><b>second and all was quiet again. What would you do if that happened.
Well, my</b>
<br><b>brother went back to bed and told the story when he got up. He is
not</b>
<br><b>spooked very often. I think it's because he was used to it in the
other</b>
<br><b>house. Well that night you damn well know thank's to my brothers
story I</b>
<br><b>couldn't sleep. You know your mind goes crazy and you think of good
things</b>
<br><b>as much as you can before yor fear takes over again such as your
thinking of</b>
<br><b>a beautiful girl in you glory then your fear cuts her head off or
something.</b>
<br><b>Anyway I couldn't sleep. After that happened to my brother the ghost
let us</b>
<br><b>all know he was there. My mom saw him a few times , so did my dad
and my</b>
<br><b>brother. Me on the other hand have heard him walking up the stairs
and he</b>
<br><b>tends to open the side door going to the mud and if we lock it it
upsets him</b>
<br><b>sometimes and he'll bang loudly on the door until someone goes to
check it</b>
<br><b>out. After a few sightings and by the way the reason why I haven't
seen the</b>
<br><b>ghosts is because that first night back home I welcomed the ghosts
but asked</b>
<br><b>them to please not show themselves to me and the funny thing is
that they</b>
<br><b>respected that request.One day when I was in the local library I
looke</b>
<br><b>through some maps of Londonderry. Just as I thought. The cemetary
about four</b>
<br><b>acres from the house was bigger than it is. According to the map
the</b>
<br><b>cemetary touches my neighbors and our house. Pretty weird. Well
I better go</b>
<br><b>for now and to let everone know all is well since my wife and I
have moved</b>
<br><b>and my parents say the ghosts are quiet but nearing Halloween i'm
sure</b>
<br><b>they'll be at my parents saying hi to all the trick or treaters
and the</b>
<br><b>family. I'll be that night for a while. And from what mom says she
thinks</b>
<br><b>thaey miss me and my brother. but that's o.k.&nbsp;&nbsp; Until
next time :) peace and</b>
<br><b>god bless.</b>

<p><b>Ghostly Voices</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; mlj1mcp@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This happened to me in 1980 when I was 16 years old in the San Fernando</b>
<br><b>Valley north of Los Angeles.&nbsp; My brother, our mutual friend
and I were</b>
<br><b>watching a documentary on TV about psychic phenomenon.&nbsp; One
segment had a</b>
<br><b>ghost hunter who used a tape recorder to record graves and he would</b>
<br><b>supposedly get voices on tape.&nbsp; Being typical boys and always
looking for a</b>
<br><b>new adventure, that was all we needed to hear.&nbsp; So we grabbed
a tape</b>
<br><b>recorder and drove over to a local pioneer cemetary that was founded
back in</b>
<br><b>the nineteenth century in our town.&nbsp; We placed the tape recorder
on several</b>
<br><b>graves and recorded for several minutes at a time while we stood
a few yards</b>
<br><b>away.&nbsp; But each time we played the tape back we could only
here the ambient</b>
<br><b>noise around us and an occasional dog barking in the distance.&nbsp;
Finally, we</b>
<br><b>found one grave at the back of the cemetary that had no headstone
(there was</b>
<br><b>a lot of vandalism that happened for a number of years until the
city</b>
<br><b>finally closed the cemetary to the public a few years later), so
we had no</b>
<br><b>idea who was buried there.&nbsp; We did our normal routine of placing
the tape</b>
<br><b>recorder on the grave, pressing the record button, then standing
silently by</b>
<br><b>a few yards away while it recorded.&nbsp; After recording for several
minutes, we</b>
<br><b>played the tape back.&nbsp; About halfway through the playback we
heard&nbsp; a faint</b>
<br><b>yet unmistakable human voice that spoke in a whisper.&nbsp; It seemed
to be</b>
<br><b>female and she said, "I'm dead.&nbsp; Help me!"&nbsp; Our friend
began to freak out</b>
<br><b>and wanted to get the hell out of there, but my brother and I were
intrigued</b>
<br><b>and wanted to see if we could get more.&nbsp; So I placed the recorder
back on</b>
<br><b>the grave, pressed the record button, and walked away.&nbsp; Keep
in mind that</b>
<br><b>this took place in broad daylight and the tape recorder was always
only a</b>
<br><b>few yards away in plain sight!&nbsp; Anyway, after several minutes
we walked back</b>
<br><b>over and rewound the tape.&nbsp; You could here the click of the
button as I</b>
<br><b>turned the recorder on, then my footsteps crunching on the ground
as I</b>
<br><b>walked away.&nbsp; Just as my footsteps faded out a young woman's
voice, sounding</b>
<br><b>slightly echoey as if spoken in a tight enclosed room, said quite
loudly and</b>
<br><b>clearly, "It isn't finished!"&nbsp; By that time we were all very
freaked out and</b>
<br><b>scared, so we decided to leave.&nbsp; We played the tape for our
family and</b>
<br><b>friends, but no one believed us.&nbsp; I have always been tempted
to repeat that</b>
<br><b>experiment, but I've decided against it as I am afraid of messing
around</b>
<br><b>with something that I really know nothing about.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ghostly Priest</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi my name is Sean and I live in Yardley, Pa. I work at a small Catholic</b>
<br><b>Church rectory (where the preists live) and one night my Parish's
Pastor went</b>
<br><b>out to dinner leaving me with I thought was a retired preist living
there. So</b>
<br><b>at around 7:00 PM I heard a door shut, the open and after that I
heard</b>
<br><b>footsteps comming down the rear stairs. So I went to the stairs
to great the</b>
<br><b>Retired Priest. I was shocked to see no one there, so I assumed
that he was</b>
<br><b>going down to get something then went back up the stairs. At around
8:00 he</b>
<br><b>had a call, I buzzed his room, no answer, I buzzed the other priest,
no</b>
<br><b>answer so finally I just took a message. At 8:30 I heard coffing
and an</b>
<br><b>elderly man's voice. I started walking to the stairs again only
to look up</b>
<br><b>and see an ghastly old figure standing at the top of the stairs
so I ran into</b>
<br><b>the sitting room and locked the door. After awhile i got bored and
went</b>
<br><b>looking through the parish directory from before I was born.&nbsp;
I saw a picture</b>
<br><b>of an old priest who looked excactly like the figure at the top
of the</b>
<br><b>stairs. I just shook it off and waited for the pastor to come home.
When he</b>
<br><b>came home I showed him the picture and he said he was the pastor
before me</b>
<br><b>and he died in 1986. Then he said to me hope you didn't have any
problems</b>
<br><b>being here alone.</b>

<p><b>Ghostly Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: PhonixVF@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Vincent. I am 30 years-old. I married
my high school</b>
<br><b>sweetheart when I was just 21. She already had a kid from a previous</b>
<br><b>marriage, but we were like one big happy family. I was already in
the</b>
<br><b>Marines, so we had to find a house to live in, in San Diego. We
started</b>
<br><b>renting this home on a bumpy street near Downtown. We hadn't experienced
any</b>
<br><b>paranormal activity yet. But my wife Diane said that she would see
things</b>
<br><b>moved form where they were before. I thought nothing of it because
I was a</b>
<br><b>sceptic. One Sunday we were getting ready for mass, but Diane couldn't
find</b>
<br><b>Ruthy's(our daughter) other nice show. Well I just about torw the
house apart</b>
<br><b>from end to end looking for that damn shoe. When I came back into
one room</b>
<br><b>that I had already checked, in the middle of the room was Ruthy's
shoe.</b>
<br><b>Another time, Diane and Ruthy were going to pick me up at the airport
because</b>
<br><b>I had left to visit my family on the east coast. Anyway, when we
got back</b>
<br><b>from the airport, all three TV's and the radio was turned on full
blast. No</b>
<br><b>one had gone in, and no one had left the house.&nbsp; I bet you
can imagine how</b>
<br><b>scared we were. But I'm a Marine. I'm not scared of anything....</b>
<br><b>On another occassion, out neighbors from nextdoor came by to drop
off some</b>
<br><b>tupperware they borrowed. Diane and I were standing with our backs
towards</b>
<br><b>the inside of the house while our neighbors stood in the doorway.
All of a</b>
<br><b>sudden, the woman screamed. We asked her what's wrong, and she said
that a</b>
<br><b>frame on a shelve behind us moved off the shlef and levetated in
the air for</b>
<br><b>a second then dropped to the floor. When we looked, the picture
was on the</b>
<br><b>floor and all of the rest of the pictures on the shelf were faced
down.</b>
<br><b>The last thing that finally made me decide to move out, was one
night. Diane</b>
<br><b>and I were sleeping, and Ruthy in her crib in out room. I awoke
to the sound</b>
<br><b>of the kingling of a doorknob. It was coming from the living room.
I got up</b>
<br><b>and grabbed a bat from underneath my bed. I was making my way slowly
to</b>
<br><b>hallway when I heard a door swing open and hit the wall. I ran to
the living</b>
<br><b>room to see the front door wide open. I searched the place and outside
as</b>
<br><b>fast as I could. Nobody. When I came in and went to close the door,
I saw</b>
<br><b>that the knob locked as I had left it before I went to sleep, but
it was just</b>
<br><b>open now.</b>
<br><b>We moved out the following week. It was an interesting few months
in that</b>
<br><b>house. I don't know why it happened, but I know it will make a good
dtory on</b>
<br><b>your website.</b>

<p><b>When I was about 6 I lived in a house that was haunted.My 3 older

happened in that house that was BIG was when I was 1 1/2.&nbsp; My Grandmother
was about to die but it wasn't her time.&nbsp; The owner of the house's
mother appeared in the room but she had died about 15 years before that.&nbsp;
She shook my grandmother's bead and told her it wasn't her time to go.&nbsp;

<br><b>Ghost?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: meli_mel79@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have always believed in ghosts, and all my life, odd little unexplainable</b>
<br><b>things would happen.&nbsp; Footsteps, lights, seeing shadows out
of the corner of</b>
<br><b>my eye.&nbsp; But nothing had ever happened that scared me as badly
as what</b>
<br><b>happened to me about three years ago.&nbsp; I was visiting a friend
out of town</b>
<br><b>where she was attending college.&nbsp; I stayed with her in her
apartment which</b>
<br><b>she shared with her son, who happened to be out of town staying
with his</b>
<br><b>grandparents (he was about 7 yrs old at the time).&nbsp; Anyway,
I ended up</b>
<br><b>staying in his bedroom which was right across the hall from my friends</b>
<br><b>bedroom.&nbsp; Let me explain the layout of the apt.&nbsp; You walk
in the front door,</b>
<br><b>and to the right was the kids room, to the immediate left is my
friends</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; You walk down a short hall and you are in the living
room.&nbsp; Standing</b>
<br><b>in the living room, there is a door on the left to the rest room
and door on</b>
<br><b>the right to the kitchen.&nbsp; A very small apt.&nbsp; So, on one
night we both went</b>
<br><b>to bed about 11pm.&nbsp; I felt from the very beginning that the
apt was a little</b>
<br><b>creepy feeling, but i kept it to myself and slept with head phones
on to</b>
<br><b>drown out any odd noises I might hear. So, we went to bed and i
fell asleep</b>
<br><b>quickly.&nbsp; Sometime later I woke to the sounds of someone walking
into the</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; Thinking it was my friend coming in to check on me (she
is more like</b>
<br><b>an older sister than just a friend) I stayed facing the wall thinking
she</b>
<br><b>would walk right back out seeing that I was alright.&nbsp; But a
few seconds</b>
<br><b>turned into minutes and what ever was behind me stayed there "watching"
me</b>
<br><b>for the longest time!&nbsp; Not only could I feel it standing there,
I felt</b>
<br><b>feelings of the most intense hatred and evil I had ever felt in
my life!&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>could sense that what ever was behind me did not want me there and
I did not</b>
<br><b>dare look back to find out what it was.&nbsp; Something tells me
I should be glad</b>
<br><b>I didn't turn around! I could also feel this intense heat "covering"
my</b>
<br><b>entire body-kind of like when you sit to close to the fire place.&nbsp;
Finally,</b>
<br><b>after what seemed like forever, but was probably only around five
minutes it</b>
<br><b>left the room.&nbsp; The next morning my friend asked me if I had
found</b>
<br><b>everything okay because she heard me get up and walk to the rest
room (her</b>
<br><b>restroom had one of those fans that turns on when you flip on the
light) and</b>
<br><b>come back to "my" bedroom in the middle of the night. I just stared
at her</b>
<br><b>knowing I hadn't gotten up, especially after my little late night
visitor,</b>
<br><b>and told her what had happened.&nbsp; She swore she had not gotten
up during the</b>
<br><b>night either, having only woken up when she heard "me" walking around.&nbsp;
We</b>
<br><b>were the only one's in the apartment. It was then that she told
me of other</b>
<br><b>events in the apartment, like feeling someone brush by her while
sitting on</b>
<br><b>her couch studying, a little white orb floating by her bed at night
and then</b>
<br><b>floating off down the hall, among other things.</b>
<br><b>I know this is long already, but I want to tell you of just one
more</b>
<br><b>experience that happened in my own home that was similar,but not
quite as</b>
<br><b>scary.&nbsp; Two of my aunts had come to visit my mom and dad and
they were all</b>
<br><b>sitting in the living room.&nbsp; I wasn't feeling well so I stayed
in my</b>
<br><b>bedroom, I wasn't feeling much like visitors.&nbsp; The living room
and my room</b>
<br><b>shared the wall, but the door was in the hallway around the corner.&nbsp;
Well, I</b>
<br><b>was lying on my bed again with my back to the door just listening
to their</b>
<br><b>muffled voices.&nbsp; All of the sudden there was a soft knock on
the door of my</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; I just wanted to be left alone, so I closed my eyes
and pretended I</b>
<br><b>was asleep.&nbsp; I heard the door open a bit then soft footsteps
on the hardwood</b>
<br><b>floor.&nbsp; Kind of like when someone tiptoes around.&nbsp; Anyway,
i was a little</b>
<br><b>annoyed that they would walk in after I hadn't answered but i just
kept</b>
<br><b>pretending to be asleep.&nbsp; I felt whoever it was lean over me
as if checking</b>
<br><b>if I were asleep,then straighten back up, stand there for a second,
then tip</b>
<br><b>toe back out the door and close it softly.&nbsp; Later after my
aunts left, I</b>
<br><b>asked my parents who the rude one was who went into my room.&nbsp;
My parents</b>
<br><b>insist that they nor the aunts had gone near the bedrooms the entire
time</b>
<br><b>they were here.&nbsp; The only time anyone had even left the living
room was when</b>
<br><b>my aunt went to get more water in the kitchen, which is in the opposite</b>
<br><b>direction of my bedroom. Luckily, whoever was checking on my this
time was</b>
<br><b>not all evil like the one in my friends apartment.&nbsp; I have
many more</b>
<br><b>experiences that occurred in my home and other places, but I will
send them</b>
<br><b>in some other time.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Scary Stuff</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sarroin@attglobal.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So all of you think you're safe in your nice little
home? Well</b>
<br><b>you're not !!! All the ghosts are out to get you !!! Nah I'm just</b>
<br><b>kidding. But for me there has been some pretty scary stuff goin'
on. I</b>
<br><b>just moved in this nice little town with all this rich houses and
a</b>
<br><b>brand new town , but i don't know what has been here before !!!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our house is fairly big , and I go to high school.
I love to party</b>
<br><b>and do the normal teenager things. Anyways , after a night out with
my</b>
<br><b>friends he wanted to come over and crash , so why not ? So any ways</b>
<br><b>we're just chillin at around 2 in the morning and we get sleepy.
So we</b>
<br><b>decide to just crash...After about 10 minutes of settling down ,
we here</b>
<br><b>footsteps up stairs. Now i have 2 cats and they can make some noise
but</b>
<br><b>i mean you can tell the difference between a human walking and cats
,</b>
<br><b>and it couldn't of been my parents cuz well they wouldn't just wake
up</b>
<br><b>at 2:15 in the morning and not lights went on plus this lasted for
about</b>
<br><b>5 minutes. Ignoring this , thinking it was just the settling of
the</b>
<br><b>house , i've gone on with my life...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now my mom has heard some pretty WEIRD things
goin out , like</b>
<br><b>creaking in the house and so on. Again all this seems a little strange
,</b>
<br><b>but i go on. Then this is when everything starts getting weird.
I've had</b>
<br><b>my 93 year old great-grandmother spend the week-end. So on a saturday
my</b>
<br><b>friend wanted to stay over so i thought no problem , better than
doin</b>
<br><b>nothing. So anyways, the next morning my mom told me how about my</b>
<br><b>grandmother woke up in the morning and saw people downstairs !!!
She</b>
<br><b>asked if it was me and my friend , and well it wasn't us. My mom
after</b>
<br><b>said she was hallucinating , but i mean my great-grandma woke up
and</b>
<br><b>walked all the way downstairs and then saw the people , so i doupt
it.</b>
<br><b>By the way you know when you see things in the corner of your eye
, well</b>
<br><b>its happened to me. And my mom once heard a crash downstairs , but
then</b>
<br><b>she went to go look she found nothing.And the feeling that you are</b>
<br><b>always being watched and someone is watching you.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey all I'm saying is there some weird things
goin' on , but what do</b>
<br><b>you think ? A string of continuous weird and coincidental events
, or</b>
<br><b>maybe haunted house ??? You be the judge...</b>

<p><b>10 Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: evangelionunitrt@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;This is my first time coming into a place like this so I may
be sketchy</b>
<br><b>with my accounts.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the spirits, ghosts as you say, I've
encountered as a child</b>
<br><b>on up to my teens. For the record there are 10 ghosts I've know
for an</b>
<br><b>extended period.</b>
<br><b>The 1st ghost- murderer, very demonic, encountered at age 5 in the
last</b>
<br><b>room of one military home I lived in, always appeared at night,
a one</b>
<br><b>night stand ended the haunting.</b>
<br><b>The 2nd ghost- feminine presence, appears in mirrors always in ethereal</b>
<br><b>clothing, very happy, keeps contact to this day, also speaks in
Norse</b>
<br><b>for some reason.</b>
<br><b>The 3rd ghost- peculiar, always a perching crow or raven, leaves
items</b>
<br><b>in visible places for me to find, seen every occasion.</b>
<br><b>The 4th ghost- native american Sioux, elderly, shaman maybe, in
forest</b>
<br><b>areas that I go to often, taught me some things.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; All the other ghosts I didn't mention due to absence
of their</b>
<br><b>presence.( Possible crossing-overs or due to location of).</b>

<p><b>By: ldeiter@juno.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>First some background info.</b><b></b>
<p><b>We have been living in our current home for 8 years and have experienced</b>
<br><b>various forms of&nbsp; phenomena. Personal items have disappeared
only to</b>
<br><b>reappear at a later date in a different location. Items in our home
have</b>
<br><b>been lifted and dropped, ( kind of tossed not thrown) examples are</b>
<br><b>candles from a mantel and a toy snoopy dropped on a table. Once</b>
<br><b>eyeglasses were lifted off the counter about 6 inches and dropped
on the</b>
<br><b>floor, the man they belonged to put them in his jacket pocket. He
spent</b>
<br><b>the night and the next day we found them in the dishwasher when
we</b>
<br><b>unloaded they were pretty hot but ok. There are constantly doors
opening</b>
<br><b>and closing upstairs but no one has ever seen them you just hear
it</b>
<br><b>during the day if you are home. We also hear people walking around</b>
<br><b>upstairs.&nbsp; The upstairs bathroom shower curtain rod is constantly
being</b>
<br><b>tossed on the floor or in the tub. Several of us have seen and felt
a</b>
<br><b>presence in the dining room and in the bathroom upstairs. Downstairs</b>
<br><b>seems to get more frequent near Christmas and in the bathroom the
shower</b>
<br><b>curtain will move and stay moved while you are watching it in the
mirror</b>
<br><b>over the sink. There don't seem to be any specific times for a lot
of it.</b>
<br><b>This has been witnessed by at least 6 people. My husband came across
old</b>
<br><b>photos in a dresser built in to the attic closet, he doesn't know
what</b>
<br><b>made him search but one day he felt like pulling all the drawers
out and</b>
<br><b>he found an old photo album, some sheet music with the name Lorraine</b>
<br><b>written on them-it also happens to be my name. The pictures are
dated</b>
<br><b>from the 1920's. Several times we have been totally broke and have
had</b>
<br><b>$10. bills appear once on the upstairs bathroom radiator and the
second</b>
<br><b>time in the middle of the living room floor.&nbsp; We were all home
and had</b>
<br><b>walked over the area repeatedly getting ready for work and school
that</b>
<br><b>morning I needed bus fare for work called my mom&nbsp; from the
kitchen walked</b>
<br><b>to the living room and found a 1935 silver certificate just laying
in</b>
<br><b>front of the fireplace. I have never seen one before and actually
asked</b>
<br><b>my husband if it was real. I am also the one who found the money</b>
<br><b>upstairs. We did have a ten dollar bill disappear later that week
and</b>
<br><b>have never found it. We know the house foundation is over a hundred
years</b>
<br><b>old and that the rest of the house was built over it. According
to our</b>
<br><b>Home Insurance agent it is one of the first if not the first house
built</b>
<br><b>in this area and it was started in the 1800's.</b><b></b>

<br><b>"Ghost Waking Me Up"</b><b></b>

<p><b>I'd like to submit this story to your website as well as find out
if this</b>
<br><b>could have been a possible ghost encounter or just a "waking nightmare".</b>
<br><b>One night a few months back I was sleeping sound and secure. I don't</b>
<br><b>remember having a nightmarish dream that night, but then I just
suddenly</b>
<br><b>woke up.. I didn't hear my alarm or anything. I just opened my eyes.
And</b>
<br><b>then I swear that I saw a dark shape.. right in front of my face!
It seemed</b>
<br><b>to be the same size as my own head, and I thought it was a face.
Boy was I</b>
<br><b>frightened.. I actually screamed out and yanked the covers over
my head.</b>
<br><b>That was actually the second time this happened to me.</b>
<br><b>The first time was similar, but the dark shape wasn't right up in
my face. I</b>
<br><b>was sleeping at my grandma's house when I woke to the sound of the
toilet</b>
<br><b>gurgling. I don't know why the toilet gurgled.. but when I opened
my eyes</b>
<br><b>and looked forward past the end of the bed I swear I saw a tall
dark shape.</b>

<br><b>Woman See Them</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: rachelleerickson@angelfire.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is a true story. A couple years ago, we moved into a new house
in Hanford, CA. When my six year old son Brian was in his room, I heard
banging noises, like something being thrown. I went in there, and it's
obvious that his toys had been thrown across the room. I assumed he had
done it, and told him not to. He claimed that they had flown across the
room all by themselves. I assumed he was just making up this lame excuse
to avoid punishment. This continued happening off and on for months. It
was only near my son, and only when he was alone. We thought about getting
him some sort of counseling.</b>
<br><b>Then one night when I was alone, I was in my bedroom. Then in the
mirror, I saw someone behind me. I looked behind me, and there was no one.
The person in the mirror was a blonde little about nine years. She was
totally nude. She had a Victorian hairstyle with her hair in curls. I was
absolutely shocked by this. I didn't know if I had imagined. However, later
I would hear a little girl giggling when there was no one there. Then one
time when I was in the backyard I saw another little girl about nine years..
This was different girl. She had black hair in a Victorian hairstyle. She
was also completely nude. When she saw me, she ran around the corner, and
when I turned the corner, she was gone. Also, I noticed that pictures taken
at our house often have bright white circles or other lights on them.</b>
<br><b>The abuse my son suffered worsened. He started having bruises on
his body. He claimed the girls were throwing things at him. He never actually
saw the girls but could sense they were there. I was very reluctant to
mention this to anyone because they would think I was crazy. Then one of
my neighbors told me that she had seen a nude little girl with her brown
hair in her kitchen. When her husband walked in, she vanished instantly.</b>
<br><b>I decided to try to get to the bottom of what was happening. I went
to the library, and looked at microfilm of old newspapers. I discovered
the following incident. In 1873, two sisters Carolyn, 12 years old, and
Sarah 9 years old, and two of Sarah's friends, Rebecca and Abigail, both
9 years old, went skinnydipping in a canal.</b>
<br><b>When they were swimming, a group of boys spied on them, and stole
all of their clothes. They decided that Carolyn would go get clothes for
them. Carolyn left the canal, and ran through the adjacent walnut orchard.
Carolyn stole clothes from a neighbor's clothes line, and then returned.
When Carolyn got back, there was no sign of the other three girls. Later,
they found their bodies. The three 9 year old girls had drown. There were
pictures of them in the newspaper, and they were the same girls I saw.
Sarah was the blonde girl, Rebecca had black hair, and Abigail had brown
hair. The location of the canal was exactly where our house is today.</b>
<br><b>Since then, I've talked to other people who have seen these ghosts.
They are only ever seen by females because they are shy about males seeing
them nude. They have a particular vandetta against all little boys since
it was boys that spied on them and stole their clothes. The ghosts are
also associated with walnuts because the canal was right near a walnut
orchard. The ghosts are mostly seen in our neighborhood because that's
where the canal was, but they are also seen all over the city. However,
throughout the rest of the city, they are only seen near walnuts. They
have been seen in walnut orchard, warehouses full of walnuts, and even
the walnut section of the grocery.</b>

<p><b>My Cousin Jimmy</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SlayerRune@Hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Anyway, here goes.&nbsp; It all started one night when I was little,
and I coud'nt sleep.&nbsp; So, I went out to the couch in my living room
to sleep.&nbsp; I got very little sleep before for some odd reason something
made me wake up and look over the armbar.&nbsp; I saw a big white blob
with black smudges where the eyes and mouth should have been, floating
from my kitchen going to my bathroom.&nbsp; Back then, I kenw it was a
ghost, but luckly I did not know they could be so deadly, so I was'nt scared.&nbsp;
Anyway,&nbsp; I convinced myself years later that it was a dream, untill
a new twist happend I forgot about untill my mom told a "theripst".&nbsp;
What happend was, I thought it was the ghost of my dead cosin Jimmy.&nbsp;
Well, I was too young to read.&nbsp; and the next day, my mom took me to
a cemerty where a good number of my family was buried.&nbsp; I went over
to a grave and started talking.&nbsp; When my mom was done, she came over
and asked "kyle, Who are you talking to?"&nbsp; And now, the twist:</b>
<br><b>I said "Jimmy"</b>
<br><b>And thats who's grave it was.&nbsp; My dead cousin, jimmy.</b>
<br><b>And that's my story.&nbsp; Hope You like it.</b><b></b>

<p><b>i've allways wondered about ghosts, and ufo's &amp; what not. i'd
allways wish</b>
<br><b>that wierd things would happen to me, and then suddenly reverse
my thoughts.</b>
<br><b>about a month ago, i was sleeping out on the couch, and i heard
theese wierd</b>
<br><b>humming sounds. jokeinly, i wished it was a UFO.then they became
louder. i</b>
<br><b>freaked out and prayed, and nothing else happend. the next morning,
i was</b>
<br><b>looking in the mirror, at this red mark on my face. it looked like
a pimple,</b>
<br><b>so i pinched it, and this white, round peice of stuff that wouldn't
break</b>
<br><b>came out. it was gross, and i forgot about it. the next night the
same thing</b>
<br><b>happend, and in the morning, nothing had happend. so feeling better
i went</b>
<br><b>on with my day. at night the same wierd red mark was on my leg,
with the</b>
<br><b>same white thing inside.</b><b></b>
<p><b>it didn't think much of this, sence it didn't bother me.</b>
<br><b>but then i thought of when my cosins were up a few months prior
to today. i</b>
<br><b>was out in the travel trailor setting things up for me &amp; my
cosins to sleep</b>
<br><b>in.</b>
<br><b>my mom came to the house door, and began complaining about something.</b>
<br><b>suddenly i was filled with rage, and the travel trailor door slammend
shut</b>
<br><b>in my face. i thought it was because of the wind, but then relized
that it's</b>
<br><b>atached to a magnite, and you have to pull the door quite hard to
close it.</b>
<br><b>scared, i went inside. that night, my cosin haley went to turn on
the light,</b>
<br><b>and it didn't work, so i tried. nothing happend, so i shut it off.
then it</b>
<br><b>came on a few senonds later. i looked at the light, and it was off,
but on.</b>
<br><b>so i switched it on, and it stayed on. then it worked proporly.
i went to go</b>
<br><b>get a sheet for the bed, and i had it in my hands, and i went and
set it</b>
<br><b>down in the trailer. i talked to my dad for a second, then i went
to pick up</b>
<br><b>the sheet, and it was gone. i was CERTAIN i had put it there, and
we haven't</b>
<br><b>been able to find it sence. nothing else happend, after that. the
next week</b>
<br><b>(after they had gone) i walked into room, and my curtain was swiging.(it's</b>
<br><b>one of thoose plastic one's)i walked over to shut the window, and
relized</b>
<br><b>that it was closed. so, i thought it was the air pressure change,
because i</b>
<br><b>had opened the bathroom door(witch was filled with steam from my
shower)</b>
<br><b>but, then why wasn't the other one swining? it's window was closed,
also. i</b>
<br><b>kinda became parinoed, and would allways missplace stuff. i'd be
looking for</b>
<br><b>something on my dresser, and not c it, then all of the sudden it
was there.</b>
<br><b>that's happend so many x's. it's propably just me, though. i while
ago, i</b>
<br><b>became interested with the devil, and things got scary. i'd hear
water</b>
<br><b>running, and find the fauset on, alltough no one had turned it on.
this</b>
<br><b>happend at my house, and my grandma's. and i'd hear the tv on, but
when i</b>
<br><b>came out, it was off. sometimes when i was in my room(when i was
7-8 or so)</b>
<br><b>i'd hear a loud noise, and go under my blankets and hide, in the
same</b>
<br><b>possition, sweating for hours. one time i thought it said, "NO!"
and i got</b>
<br><b>so scared. this would allways happen when i was about to fall asleep,
or i</b>
<br><b>had just cried. now i'm almost 15, and when ever something wierd
happens, i</b>
<br><b>just pray. i stared to go to church lately, and now nothing wrong
has</b>
<br><b>happend for a couple of weeks.</b>
<br><b>only one thing bugs me still- there's this doll on my dresser, and
it looks</b>
<br><b>like it is staring at you, so i allways turn it's head around. but,
once in</b>
<br><b>a while, it's turned back. why? i don't know.</b>
