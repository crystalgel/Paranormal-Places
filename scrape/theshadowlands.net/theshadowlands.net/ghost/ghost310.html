<br><b>&nbsp;My Sisters Place</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jill@sitegadgets.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>This happened in Portage La Praire, Manitoba, about 7 years ago:</b>
<br><b>My sister had moved to an apartment, and had asked me to spend the
night after she had moved in and settled.&nbsp; Which I did so, because
we are quite close, and I enjoyed being able to talk to her, and visit
my neice.&nbsp; On this particular day, I felt wierd in her house.&nbsp;
It is hard to explain, it was like I was being watched, and not wanted
there.&nbsp; As the day progressed I kept catching glances of movement
from the corner of my eye.&nbsp; It stared off as just small "shadows"
but that soon changed as the day progressed.&nbsp; As night came I began
to see more and more movement, and shadows.&nbsp; They were getting bigger
too, almost more bold.&nbsp; I was seeing them more and more.&nbsp; At
first I tried so hard to ignore them, I wanted to dismiss them as nothing,
but after a while I couldn't.&nbsp; I finally, told my sister that I was
going to have a bath, and then get ready for bed...&nbsp; She told me that
she would put my neice to bed while I was bathing.&nbsp; I guess I thought
that if I got out of the living room, maybe it would get better. There
was no corners to peek around, or shelves to hid behind in the bathroom.&nbsp;
After my bath I came in to the kitchen, and something felt so wrong.&nbsp;
I noticed that my sister was not out of her bedroom and I felt worried.&nbsp;
I opened the door to her room, and all of a sudden I heard my sister, she
was in trouble.&nbsp; I could tell she was trying to talk, but couldn't,
then she was up...&nbsp; She rushed out of the room, she was crying...
I went in and grabbed my niece.&nbsp; After a few minutes, she calmed down
and told me what happened.&nbsp; She said that she couldn't move and her
legs were elevated in the air, and that there was a huge eye, looking at
her from above.&nbsp; She then said that when I entered the room, there
was a very bright light surrounding me, and it all came to an end as I
entered.&nbsp; My sister told me to call my Mom and our Aunty, because
they are "gifted" people.&nbsp; They immediatly got a Medicine man to come
to the house, and he told my sister that she could not stay in the house,
for there were many angry spirits, in the house.&nbsp; We moved her out
that night.&nbsp; I asked the medicine man, if there was many different
sized ones, and he said yes, and then I told him that I had "seen" them
all night, but they stayed hidden from me, just watching me....I cannot
explain why, they stayed away from me, or why I was surrounded by a bright
light, I was just very happy that nothing happened to my sister or my neice.</b>
<br><b>After she moved out of that apartment, we drove by it a few times,
and it was odd, because it felt so threating to us.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Cat Loving Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: JENSEN968@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I had completely forgotten about my friends ghost until I was reading
through some of these stories.&nbsp; I only went to this friends house
a few times, but it was really amazing.&nbsp; Every night about 5:00, her
TV would turn on and change channels.&nbsp; Even if she was watching something.&nbsp;
It drove her crazy because that is when the best shows are on and they
only had one cable outlet.&nbsp; The TV would just channel surf by itself.&nbsp;
It would stay on one channel for a little while and then switch to a different
channel.</b>
<br><b>I can't remember what they called their friendly ghost (I think
it might have been Earl), but they were completely comfortable with him.&nbsp;
I was there twice when this happened.&nbsp; I never felt scared or nervous,
which is a little strange for me.&nbsp; I actually found it amusing.&nbsp;
Especially when their cat would jump up on the couch and rub up on thin
air.&nbsp; It would even raise it's butt in the air like cats do when you
pet them.</b>
<br><b>I am very interested in ghosts and hauntings (just not in my home!)
and I read everything I can about them, but I don't remember any other
story where the animals actually liked the ghosts.</b><b></b>

<br><b>A Few from Downunder</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:tynanslaw@iprimus.com.au</b><b></b>
<p><b>I thought I would write and share a few of my stories with you some
ghostly and some just strange, all springing from Australia.</b>
<br><b>The first is from when I was young. I'd say I was around eight or
nine years of age when I had the first experience. I awoke late one night
for no apparent reason, as I lay there I could here the bathroom tap dripping
every couple of seconds. Listening to this I became aware that the tap
began dripping faster, shortly the water was blasting through and then
nothing, a complete stop. From my bed with the aid of the streelight outside
my window, I watched to see who it was that had gotten up, as I could see
the other bedroom doorways. My brother shared my room and he was asleep,
so that only left my sister or my father. I saw no one go back into their
rooms. I can say that I did get a little anxious, not freaked just a sort
of "umm this is a little weird...." feeling. I made myself get up and I
stuck my head into my dads room... asleep, checked my sisters room...asleep.
I hit the light in the bathroom and found there was water all over the
vanity and on the floor. A strange experience to say the least, and as
a postscript my mother died in the house and I had another two sisters
that had also died, though not in the house. For many years my father and
stepmother would swear that whilst watching TV downstairs in the rumpus
room they would here footsteps walk down the hallway into the kitchen and
then walk back, they would assume it was one of us kids and then when they
came up to check they would find us all asleep.</b>
<br><b>The second, is a recurring dream, this dream I can say plagued me
for around three to fours years and began around the age of nine. It is
a follows; I am in a old Holden stationwagon sitting in the backseat beside
me are two girls probably around the ages of seven or eight. They cannot
see me and don't know that I am there I am just a third party watching
but involved. There is a man driving, somewhat grizzled in appearance,
stubbly face short unkempt hair. We are driving this dirt road, it is dusty
and I can see the trees and scrub moving by quickly. The cars stops and
the man comes round and opens the back door, he has a rifle, the girls
are crying and I am also crying. The man drags one of the girls from the
car the older one,&nbsp; she starts screaming and tells the other to run.
The next thing we are running in the bush, everything is whirling around,
we're crying and breathing heavy, exhausted, scared,&nbsp; a gunshot makes
us start, we look back.... now we can hear him coming, we take cover behind
a fallen tree, we can see the his legs walking toward us through a gap.
The last thing I see is his boot take a step onto the tree and the gun
barrel comes down to point between the eyes of the other girl and then
blackness. Strange......&nbsp; Now&nbsp; eventually the dreams stopped
and upon reflection I placed it in the category of some internal angst
about the deaths of my older sisters. I hadn't thought about this dream
for many years ( I am in my thirties now ), until it all came back to me
in about 2002. Except this time it wasn't a dream. I just happened to pass
by the TV when a news bulletin came on, a man had been arrested in North
Queensland and was being charged with rape and murder charges of minors
during the 70's. His face was covered by his coat by police as he was led
away, the story went on to show photographs of the mans car, an old Holden
stationwagon and also talk about the young girls he had taken into the
bush which he then raped and shot. The massive jolt to my system when I
saw the news story was unbelievable, and for the first time I related the
dream to a mate who was also watching the news.</b>
<br><b>This next little episode is a little kooky, I was at a mates party
when I was seventeen, his house has three vacant lots surrounding it one
directly behind and two either side. We were forever shortcutting through
the back lot, as on the walk to my grandfathers house where I was living,
it saved around ten minutes. This particular evening I had said my good
byes and decided to head home and, as usual, cut through the vacant lot.
At night, in the dark it is a little eerie as the streetlights only hit
the far corner of the lot, I began to walk through and started beelining
for the far corner. I noticed something moving on my left and I kind of
froze, I turned further toward the movement and breathed a sigh of relief...a
dog. Thankfully it wasn't a large dog like a German Shepherd, more like
a Blue Heeler or Kelpie, nonetheless I figured it best to try and make
friends as dogs at night, well you just never know. So here I am at two
in the morning in the middle of a vacant block going "come here boy, come
on, come on, there's a good boy". What did I get, nothing, not a thing,
this dog didn't even flinch just kept standing there staring at me from
a distance of ten feet. Now I am a little worried, I started walking slowly,
watching this dog out of the corner of my eye. Every ten paces or so I
would stop and face him and try calling him over, but it just kept the
same distance, when I stopped it stopped and when I started it started.
I quickened my pace a little to hit the mental safety of the far corner,
as I breached the lit area I turned for a better look at the dog that was....
no.. where.. to.. be.. seen. Now there was nowhere for it to go as the
nearest hiding place was a house 50 -60 feet away and the grass in the
lot only came up to your shins so it wasn't sitting down. I looked for
a few minutes then let the matter go and continued home, about one minute
from home I was walking up toward a block of units and when I was almost
alongside I noticed this girl standing outside on the porch. I wondered
why someone would just be standing there on a porch at two in the morning
and when I looked again... nothing. Well that was enough for me, I think
I sprinted the rest of the way home to my grandfathers house. Now I am
not one for fanciful thinking, I saw what I saw. I related this to my friends
mother the next day and her explanation was this, the dog, it was a protector,
there was or had been something of a nasty nature happen or happening within
the vacant lot and the Dog was making sure I got through ok, me thinks
.... cooolll, protector Dog....&nbsp; The girl on the porch well that was
her.. apparently she was astral travelling, me thinks,.. hmmm not so sure
about that one. Fast forward about a year and I am at work and, in a general
conversation with on of the girls it turned out she had lived in the same
street as my grandfathers house.</b>
<br><b>She then says to me " Do you remember a really burnt up lightpole
outside the powerstation"</b>
<br><b>I said, " vaguely, why".</b>
<br><b>She says" well there was a couple living across the road and they
had this huge argument and then broke up, the girl freaked out and went
across the road to where the car was with a can of petrol, poured the petrol
on herself and the car jumped in and lit it up, suicide... burnt to death"</b>
<br><b>A strange weird feeling came over me and I then went into some more
detail with her and, Yes, the girl on the porch of the units I had walked
past a year earlier were the same ones......</b>
<br><b>Ok last one..&nbsp; About three years ago I was living in this old
busted up house which had an old butchers shop adjoining it. When I say
busted up I mean busted up, the footings on one side of the house were
sinking and as a result things were on a bit of a lean, I could put my
hand through some of the cracks in the place. Apart from that she was ok,
we tidied her up and well it was tolerable. Given that, everything in this
is centred around my room, high ceilings one door and one window. The walkway
to the old butchers shop went straight past my window and my view was the
old freezer...charming. Basically there were no problems for around three
months. The first I knew of anything was when I said to my housemate I
didn't sleep well the night before. After that there was a change albeit
a subtle one, the energy was different and I could tell. My sleep started
to deteriorate even more and then I began sensing and hearing things. There
were times at night when I felt I was being watched from outside my window,
even though I couldn't see anything. From there I would here things walking
on the roof of the house, I thought it was possums at first, but the tread
was deliberate. On more than one occasion it had me out of the house with
a flashlight looking up to the roof to find nothing. I started getting
a little stir crazy, and even my housemate was concerned, as he had known
me for a long time and my behaviour was way out of character. To further
amplify this point, I am the type of guy that can stop people with a look,
and if I point they know they have done something wrong and if I head in
their direction they know they are in trouble. So my housemate knew something
was seriously up. This pattern of problems continued for about two months
on a nightly basis. Through discussions with another friend I started to
use feng shui to try and change the energies surrounding my room. That
and the use of some other Chinese beliefs for removing bad spirits (no
I am not Chinese) with the use of mirrors to deflect bad energies etc.
The change was pretty much immediate, over the course of two nights things
started to return to normal. After about a week there was almost nothing,
there were some slight feelings every now and again but I could deal with
that. I will finish by saying I moved out after about another three months
so I cannot comment on the ongoing effects of my method.</b>

<p><b>Encounter with a Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: aragonpotter@btopenworld.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Cassandra and I had a really scary experience at my Grandmama's
house once. I was lying in my mum's old room reading a book. my grandparents
were downstairs watching the news. so after about an hour of reading the
room when really cold even though the heating was on. then the light started
to flash. I got under covers at this point and carried on reading. then
next to me a really gruff voice whispered, 'Cassandraaa'. I swear I've
never screamed so loud in all my life. and that is my scary encounter with

<p><b>The Unknown Cemetery</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: KPER@uswebinc.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have been reading stories on this site for a little while now and
I just feel like I need to share what happened to me. I have commented
before about Sweet Hollow Road in New York but this is something totally
different. I go to school in Rhode Island, and it just happens to be that
I live in Xavier Dorm, which is also haunted. But one night in April 2004
me and my roommates and our friends decided to go on a little search. There
weren’t any parties or anything going on that night so we decided to go
for a drive. I was driving. We knew someone who lived on the border of
Connecticut and Rhode Island so we went out toward him and asked him if
he knew of any scary places that we could go to. He and his friend did.
They knew of this cemetery that was right on the border so I don’t know
if it was in Rhode Island or Connecticut. His friend was warning us not
to go in there because bad things have happened to people who go in there.
People have come out with cuts all over their bodies and things like that.
This place wasn’t very big and it was in this little neighborhood. There
was a long driveway and it led up a hill where it ended and turned around
back down to the entrance/exit. Our friend’s friend told us that when we
went there, if we felt the little thing wrong or if we felt the hairs on
the back of our neck stick up something was wrong. His friend refused to
go in so we dropped him off on the way. The story behind this place was
that supposively a group of kids or someone was doing a s&eacute;ance at
the very top where there is a concrete platform. Well while they were in
the middle of doing this some kind of force threw one of the kids out of
the circle. And it is said that if you break the circle during a s&eacute;ance
that it causes evil to surface. Well since he was thrown out of the circle
it was never closed.&nbsp; SO bad things happen there. We didn’t believe
it especially the boys. It was me, my roommate and 3 of our guy friends.
When we first got there we didn’t feel anything bad. None of our hairs
stood up or anything. So we continued to walk. We got about 15 feet into
the cemetery when my roommate started to freak out. She let go of my hand
and ran back to the car. So I continued with the 3 boys. I was holding
on to one of them when all of a sudden I couldn’t move. I was starting
to see things at the top of the hill. My legs would not move. SO I decided
to head back. As I turned to run my legs regained strength and I ran. As
I was running I felt like I was in slow motion and I could hear someone
running with me right next to me. I assumed it was one of the guys. When
I reached the car I turned around and no one was with me. I waited there
with my roommate and our other friend who didn’t go in. And one by one
everyone came running out. Once all but one of us was out we felt better.
And then we realized that our friend was still in there. He thought he
was hot ****. SO we figured he was trying to prove something. When all
of a sudden he was walking out. He got about 10 feet to the gates and started
running. He told me afterwards that he felt as if someone was right behind
him. Afterwards we discussed what we had seen and things like that. MY
roommate and I both agreed that we had see a shadow of a man at the top
of the hill squat down stand up wave to us then squat back down. My roommate
and the guy last out had agreed that they had seen a girl in white kind
of dancing and floating down the hill toward them playing with something
like a ball. I decided to drive in at that point because I was disappointed
in myself for not staying in there. I drove about 30 feet in there and
all of a sudden something dropped onto the side of my window and the top
of my car. I freaked out. I drove out of there so fast. And what scared
me the most is that there were no trees or anything above my car. Once
we finally got out and we’re back on the highway we realized that one of
my friends had come out from there with a scratch down his neck. I will
never forget that night for as long as I live. If anyone knows where I’m
talking about or has some info on this please e-mail me.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Haunted Room</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LENJANIAN@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Ian Mullen. When I was 10 I lived at Coxhoe and I often
woke in the middle of the night. I can't remember when exactly this was
but I know that it was sometime around summer.</b>
<br><b>One night I awoke to find a man leaning over me. I screamed and
ran out of my room. The man was soaked in blood which was, at the time,
really scary. When I returned to my room, the man had gone!!</b>
<br><b>After that, for about 3 months, every two or three days I would
be eating my food or watching the TV when something would fly across the
room. I was petrified!! This all stopped for about a week and then the
man returned. He was sitting on a chair. I just froze!!</b>
<br><b>Fortunately, he left and since then, I have been fascinated by Paranormal
activity. The man never returned and I never had anything flying across
my room again.</b>

<br><b>my story</b><b></b>
<p><b>BY:&nbsp; spectral@adelphia.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I've often felt intensely aware of what I can see and or not see
in my surroundings.&nbsp; I live in Waterville, Maine, and there are a
few different sections of town. There's the old part and the newer remodeled
part -as it is with most towns.&nbsp; I have had more than a couple experiences
with the supernatural here in Maine.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>One event gives me Goosebumps every time I think about it.&nbsp;
I was in the old part of town in a second floor apartment building that
I had never been in before.&nbsp; I had used their bathroom to splash some
cold water on my face.&nbsp; After doing so, I realized there was no towel
in this bathroom to use to dry my face.&nbsp; Now, this was a large bathroom
still having the original sink and claw foot tub in it.&nbsp; There were
two doors in this bathroom, the door I used to enter, and another doorway
that was opened directly diagonal from the entrance door.&nbsp; I walked
over toward the second doorway to try and find a towel.&nbsp; It looked
like it was a small room someone was using as a bedroom.&nbsp; There was
a fan facing the doorway at an angle and it was turned on.&nbsp; Beyond
the fan along the same wall was a small stand and large stereo system.&nbsp;
The room was dark, and I really didn't want to go in, first of all I didn't
know who's room it was and didn't want to be rude, second, it gave me the
creeps.&nbsp; However, I was dripping wet and was desperate.&nbsp; As I
cautiously stepped in the fan slowed down.&nbsp; I really didn't think
much of it, thought maybe I had stepped on the cord or something.&nbsp;
I became alarmed when I took another step toward the fan to investigate
and it sputtered to a stop. I followed the electrical cord all the way
to the wall and it was fully plugged in.&nbsp; Instinctively I quickly
stepped back, and the fan turned back on and sped up again.&nbsp; It seemed
the more frightened I became, more things happened in this tiny room.&nbsp;
I stood there in the middle of the room and suddenly some papers ruffled
and flew up in the air a bit.&nbsp; Then I was suddenly hit with a chilling
gust of cold air and instantly froze in fear. This had never happened so
blatantly to me before.&nbsp; Before I knew it the stereo system when nuts,
all of the buttons were getting pressed quickly and randomly.&nbsp; The
radio came on, stations kept switching, then the cd player came on.&nbsp;
I was, as embarrassing as this is, on the verge of peeing my pants, I didn't
thank goodness.&nbsp; I took a deep breath, grabbed a towel, and ran as
fast as I could out of that room, out of the bathroom, through the kitchen,
and into the living room.&nbsp; I tripped and fell three times along the
way.&nbsp; I jumped into a chair and huddled there, clutching my knees
and shaking.&nbsp; Two stunned people were staring at me like I had gone
mad.&nbsp; I stuttered out the story of what had just happened to me, and
they just smiled, laughed and said "Yeah, this place is really haunted.&nbsp;
The ghosts are always messing with our electrical appliances and door locks."&nbsp;
I had a hard time ever staying in that bathroom for very long.&nbsp; I
also heard that those small rooms off of the bathrooms were often built
and used for children nurseries.</b>

<p><b>This is gonna sound kinda crazy. But bear with me. I have always
seen kina funny little things. But in November 2000 I was pregnant with
my 3rd daughter and things started to get outta hand. It all started when
my At the time almost3 year old daughter used to sit upstairs and I would
hear her talking to someone. I heard this one day and I asked her who she
was talking to she said the Baby I thought awww how cute she is excited
about the new baby. Well this stuff went on for the next month than one
day she&nbsp; came down and said mommy the baby's crying (she said this
often) Itold her to go pick it up thinking that she was pretending She
said I can't mommy it's up. At the time this diden't seam important. Anyway
as we eased into December I had my baby girl. I first noticed things starting
to happen a few days befor christmas. I satrted hearing noises foot steps
when no one was up stairs. I dismissed it as an over active imagination.
Than one day I was down stairs and I heard this very loud pounding up stairs
no one was up their. I told my husband and he said i was a nut.Well when
I got the babys first day home pic's back. the first 5 pics taken in the
span of 10 mins their was black half circle lines and light circles all
over the first 3 pics. But it was the last 2 they were cvered with blue
balls of light that looked like it had blue spider webs around it. the
rest of the roll was fine. Again I was alittle freaked out I sent the pics
to my father he said they were weard but not to be concerned. Well the
noises and stuff contiuned for the nexted few months alway when the kids
and I were home alone I got so scared that I would not be alone their.
Well one day my husband and I were in the living room ond the utility room
door handle started turning by it's self and the door started shakeing.
Well my husband freaked we checked it out their was nothing in their that
could have done that the kids were in bed. afew weeks later we were once
again sitting in the living room and out of nowear we heard the loudest
sound of finger nails going down the back of the same door. we both screamed
and ran. Now we had no pets at the time and this sounded like finger nails
on a chalk board it sounded like people finger nails. My husband nolonger
called me crazy. The noises got so bad all my kid talked about was the
baby on the wall in their room. The foot steps got louder we finnaly moved.
Everything was good 4 about the first year or so then one day my daughter
comes down stairs with her sister her speech being much better now she
said mommy theirs a baby on my wall. I had just had another daughter. but
my blood went cold I said no honey the babys in the living room. She said
no mommy not that baby it is a scary baby its on my wall and it's crying.
I wasnted to cry I was so afraid to go upstsirs when I did their was nothing
their. I thought okay they made it up. But not 3 weeks later the footsteps
started again. The banging&nbsp; so again we moved. It has been quiet for
the last year and&nbsp; a half I think its beacuse we have moved 3 times
due to finacal problems. But we are going on 6 months here an I am afraid
that the next 6 will bring a very unwanted visitor.Have u ever heard of
this before is their anything I can do if it starts again</b>

<p><b>The Landlord's Son</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; farmdog@eoni.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My friend was at home, by herself and she was watching one of those
shows on the travel channel about haunted hotels.&nbsp; She had to go to
the bathroom, and when she was washing her hands, she saw in the mirror
some guy standing behind her.&nbsp; She was scared and confused so she
turned around to tell the guy off for being in her house, but when she
turned around, he was gone.&nbsp; She looked back in the mirror and he
vanished.&nbsp; Well, I can honestly say that I didn't believe her when
she called me right after that.&nbsp; She wanted me to go over to her house
because she was scared and I thought "Man, what has she been smoking, there's
no such things as ghosts."&nbsp; But I went over there anyway.&nbsp; I
told her she was probably imagining things after watching that show.&nbsp;
Later that night, as I was putting on my pajamas (I had the door opened
because her house is freaky and I wanted to be able to run.), I saw this
dude standing next to me and he looked very angry about something.&nbsp;
I thought he broke in and was going to kill me, but when I looked next
to myself, he was gone.&nbsp; I didn't look in the mirror to see if he
was there, I just ran to my friend and told her what I saw.&nbsp; It turns
out that we saw the same dude, and we thought it was best not to stay there
anymore so we ran accross the feild to her landlord's house.&nbsp; When
we described what we saw to him, he told us it was his son, who had lived
there previously, but he wouldn't tell us how he died.&nbsp; To this day,
I don't go to her bathroom by myself and if I walk by her bathroom, it
looks like someone else is walking next to me.</b>
<br><b>She has a very haunted house.&nbsp; In the kitchen, if you stand
in a certain spot, you can smell the faint smell of some kind of perfume,
but only for a second.&nbsp; Her baby sister died in the bathtub and I
can kind of feel her in there.&nbsp; Her grandmother, who is full blooded
Native American, once told once told my friend's mom that she could see
this guy hugging her, and in the hallway, in a certain spot, it feels very
cold, colder than the rest of the hall.</b>
<br><b>When my friend was younger, she was sleeping next to her dad (mind
you she was about four or five when this happened and she still has nightmares)
and she had to use the bathroom.&nbsp; On her way back from the bathroom,
this figure grabbed her, she couldn't see it's face, and it dragged her
to the back door, which has no porch, just a five foot drop, and tried
to push her through it.&nbsp; The more she struggled, the tighter it gripped
her.&nbsp; Finally, she broke free and she went to th kitchen window.&nbsp;
She saw the white figure, but when she blinked, it was gone.</b>
<br><b>In a house that I used to live in, I always felt like I was being
watched by many people and sometimes I could hear strange whispering, so
I would get scared and find my mom. but her room wasn't any better, in
fact, it was worse, and I could feel people walking past me and I would
suddenly feel very cold, no matter how many blankets I was under, my mom
could feel them too.&nbsp; If you want to ask questions about these things,

<p><b>Several New Encounters</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; pauleew@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>It's great to be able to share a few new stories with ya'll. First
is a</b>
<br><b>story about a distraught teenager, who killed himself a few years
ago.</b>
<br><b>His friends and family visit his grave site on a regular basis,
so</b>
<br><b>there is often activity there. We here at Ghost Hunters of the Last
Frontier</b>
<br><b>have become convinced that he very much regrets what he's done.
Last</b>
<br><b>Halloween, while we were wacthing the local cemetery, which we do
every</b>
<br><b>year, to guard against vandals, we were taking pics when some of
his</b>
<br><b>friends showed up to visit, with thier permission we took some pics
of</b>
<br><b>them all, and were thrilled to get 2 great pics of the boy himself.
The</b>
<br><b>detail in the pic was outstanding, we could see his whole form very</b>
<br><b>clearly. Even his mother was amazed at the detail. When he died
the top</b>
<br><b>of his head had been distended due to the exit wound of the bullet,
and</b>
<br><b>it showed up in the pic, which I'm going to post in the near future.
is</b>
<br><b>friends started to play some music, and started to dance and when
we</b>
<br><b>took another pic, we caught him dancing as well, again very clear
in</b>
<br><b>the pic. Shortly after this, his mother arrived for the party, and
when we</b>
<br><b>took a pic of her next to the headstone, there was an orb on her</b>
<br><b>shoulder, which she was sure was him. She related that she had felt
him</b>
<br><b>next to her, and said that she had felt his hand on the exact spot
that</b>
<br><b>the orb had been. We have been back there many times since then,
and</b>
<br><b>always get an orb or two in the area, as well as a sense that he
is</b>
<br><b>there and aware of our visits.</b>
<br><b>Right across from him is another friend I knew before his death.
He was</b>
<br><b>working on one of the oil platforms here in Alaska, when his head
was</b>
<br><b>crushed by a piece of heavy pipe that broke off. His spirit is also</b>
<br><b>very evident, and also always shows up with orbs in the pics we
take there.</b>
<br><b>One of the members of our group is so in tune with the other side,
that</b>
<br><b>whenever he is photographed, anywhere he is, there is always an
orb(s)</b>
<br><b>or somethng in the pic. In one pic there were 319 obvious orbs around</b>
<br><b>him. We call him an orb magnet!</b>
<br><b>I have many other enounters to share but will add them later. If
anyone</b>
<br><b>wants to visit South central Alaska, we would be happy to show you</b>
<br><b>around.</b>

<p><b>Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; 1SBFK3CS@drumchapelhigh.glasgow.sch.uk</b><b></b>
<p><b>I really enjoy your site and it got me thinking about something that</b>
<br><b>happen to me when i was 12 years old. I was staying at my friend's
gran's</b>
<br><b>house. Her gran was very religous and had a cross on her wall above
the</b>
<br><b>fire place, recently the cross had been falling off the wall every</b>
<br><b>night at 7pm. I didn't beleive in ghosts at that time, and when
my freind</b>
<br><b>told me this i didn't believe her, i thought she was trying to frighten</b>
<br><b>me!. Just before 7pm i was looking at the cross when i felt something</b>
<br><b>or someone brush pasted me but there was no one there!. Then the
cross</b>
<br><b>was hurled across the room and landed on the floor at the other
end of</b>
<br><b>the room. I didn't sleep a wink that night and now i beleive that
we</b>
<br><b>can't explain everything that happens in our world.</b>

<p><b>Shadows</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; wmorgan1@tctc.edu</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is a story that has happened to me recently that I would like
to</b>
<br><b>share.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have been dating a guy for almost a year now and not long after
we</b>
<br><b>started dating, he confided in me that sometimes he feels like</b>
<br><b>something follows him...something evil and depressing.&nbsp; I asked
him if</b>
<br><b>he had done anything to open a door to let whatever it was into
this</b>
<br><b>world or give it a reason to follow him and he said no.</b>
<br><b>We dropped the conversation at that and never spoke of it again.&nbsp;
About</b>
<br><b>four months later, we were watching tv at his apartment and I fell</b>
<br><b>asleep.&nbsp; While I was sleeping, he got up and turned off the
television,</b>
<br><b>and then laid down beside me and fell asleep too.&nbsp; I woke up
suddenly</b>
<br><b>about thirty minutes later and looked around the room in the dark,</b>
<br><b>thinking I had heard some sort of loud noise.&nbsp; That's when
I realized</b>
<br><b>that right in front of me, about two feet from the foot of the bed,
was</b>
<br><b>a shadow--an outline of a human shape.&nbsp; It didn't have any
facial</b>
<br><b>features, it was mainly just a dark grayish silhouette that was</b>
<br><b>hovering just over the top of the foot of the bed.&nbsp; As I watched,
it</b>
<br><b>reached out an arm and began to reach for me.&nbsp; I instantly
felt as if</b>
<br><b>it was going to kill me and I screamed for Josh.&nbsp; He jumped
up beside</b>
<br><b>me and turned on the light.&nbsp; The form disappeared instantly.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>shaking and told Josh that I had seen something there and he asked
me</b>
<br><b>if it was a gray form that hovered over me.&nbsp; I was in shock,
because I</b>
<br><b>hadn't described what I had seen to him yet.&nbsp; I told him yes,
and he</b>
<br><b>said when he was younger he saw the same thing, only he reached
out and</b>
<br><b>touched it and it flew out a window.&nbsp; I was shaken up badly
after that</b>
<br><b>moment, and I made him take me home.</b>
<br><b>Recently, we at my house and we were both asleep in my room.&nbsp;
It was</b>
<br><b>probably about 11:00 at night.&nbsp; I woke up again like I had
before,</b>
<br><b>thinking I had heard a noise and looked up to see a long white vapory</b>
<br><b>looking form floating across my room. As I watched it picked up
speed</b>
<br><b>and started floating right at me!&nbsp; I screamed "NO!" and put
a pillow</b>
<br><b>over my head.&nbsp; Josh woke up and grabbed my arm. I took the
pillow off</b>
<br><b>my face and looked around, but the shadowy thing was gone.&nbsp;
Before I</b>
<br><b>could tell Josh what happened, he said "I know...I felt it go over
us."</b>
<br><b>I'm not sure if there really is something that follows him, or what,</b>
<br><b>because it only seems to happen when he is with me.&nbsp; I think
it is</b>
<br><b>really strange, and whatever it is, doesn't seem to be very friendly.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Dark Hovering Man</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; spectral@adelphia.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I live in Maine, and one night, while staying at a friends house
for the night, a very, scarey event occured. My friend, at the time lived
in Clinton, Maine.&nbsp; She was staying with her Aunt and Uncle who lived
on a dirt road drive in an old, old farmhouse that had a set of railroad
tracks next to the house.</b><b></b>
<p><b>My friends room was on the second floor of the house in what was
more like a fiished of attic.&nbsp; It was divided into two sides.&nbsp;
There was the finished side, and then there was the unfinished side.&nbsp;
We never set a foot in the unfinished side because that was where they
new most of the ghosts that they were well aware of, stayed.&nbsp; They
told me about how the ghosts would climb down the old staicase in that
half of the atttic, and they would always find that doors that they had
locked were unlocked, or just the opposite.&nbsp; They also set they often
times could here footsteps on the old staircase and up in the attic,&nbsp;
it was right above the kitchen.&nbsp; They said, for the most part, they
had friendly ghosts.</b><b></b>
<p><b>One night, her Aunt and Uncle were out for dinner, and my friend
and I were at the house babysitting her cousin.&nbsp; He had gone to bed,
so we climbed the ladder that lead to her room, and got ready for bed ourselves.&nbsp;
A little while later, we were still up, lyinging on the mattress on the
floor and talking on and on, as young girls often do on sleepovers.&nbsp;
It was a moonlit night, but clouds were rolling by, causing the moonlight
to blink on and off.&nbsp; As we lay on our backs facing the ceiling and
talking,&nbsp; it happened.&nbsp; I remember it so clearly too.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The moonlight was fully comming through the window like a nightlight.&nbsp;
Suddenly what looked to be a tall, all black man, was hovering above us.&nbsp;
I couldn't make out any feet or any kind of facial figures on this man.&nbsp;
It looked like he was wearing a large trench coat.&nbsp; My heart started
racing, and I didn't say anything to my freind untill I checked out the
window to make sure the clouds weren't playing tricks on my mind.&nbsp;
The sky was cloudless.&nbsp; Turning my gaze up again, I whispered,"Do
you see that?" to my friend.</b><b></b>
<p><b>She said "Do you see that too?"</b><b></b>
<p><b>"Yes!" I answered.&nbsp; That was all the confirmation either of
us needed.&nbsp; She counted to three, and on three it was still there
and appeared to be moving down toward us,&nbsp; in sinc' we pulled the
covers over our heads, held eachother and and screamed and cried at the
same time.&nbsp; When we finally did come out from the protection of the
covers, it was gone.&nbsp; My friend was convinced this was an evil being,
that was trying to hurt us.&nbsp; I really don't know what to think.&nbsp;
All I know is that I was thirteen or fourteen at the time, I'm 20 now,
and this event still gives me goosebumps to think, write, or talk about
now.</b>

<p><b>Real ghost story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; abcdrum@juno.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My best friend told me this true story during a sleepover. She went
to a lake in Minnesota a couple of years ago.She was with alot of her family
and the kid's had to sleep in tents.She shared a tent with her aunt who
was 10 or 11 at the time.Most of the adults slept in the cabin; except
for the grandma.The grandma slept in a old sliver bullet camper.One day
my friend and her aunt were in the camper. Whenever they walked into the
back which was the bedroom they would get bad uncontrollable chills.They
became scared of the camper and stayed away from it.That night they were
telling ghost stories and they heard strange sound from the camper.About
5 minutes later they heard a splashing sound from the lake. It sounded
like a human jumped into the water not a beaver or something. They thought
nothing of it until it happened again. They were so frightened that they
made sure that every inch of their sleeping bags were zipped up completly
and couldn't sleep for the rest of the night.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Is it my imagination or something paranormal</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; Jjessi1971@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, my name is Jessica. At my mother-in laws house weird things happen.&nbsp;
Ive heard stories from my neice and my husband about little things they
and the family has expereinced, and I would think to myself WEIRDOS. Stories
went on a couple of years, until a few months ago I expereinced something.(well
actuall when I went to their house for the first time I was sitting at
my mother-in laws computer and very faintly I heard a man and women talking,
almost like it was through the walls.At first I didnt think nothing about
it, and then the next time I was sitting there, and I was alone in the
house and I heard them again. I started thinking thats strange it sounds
like its coming from the walls, so I went outside to see if anyone was
around and there was nobody there. I told this to my mother and father-in
law and they told me it was just my imagination. (oh did I mention that
my mother-in law is a Jehovas witness, she doesnt believe in ghosts, just
demons. And she says no way that Jahova will allow that in HER house.)
Well time went by and didnt here it again and I just went on with my life,
then a few months ago I stayed the night at their house and slept in my
sister-inlaws room, door open. And down the hall I heardscuffing noises.
Like when an old person is wearing slippers and they scuff when they walk.
Well I got up to see who it was and I saw nobody. My mother in laws door
was closed, and my neice and sister in law were fast asleep in the living
room. Si i went to bed thinking it was my imagination. Well I heard it
again, and again, again. I kept getting up, again, again, and again, and
saw nothing. It went on all night, until i fell asleep aroud 4:30 am out
tiredness.&nbsp; When i got up about 8:00am with droopy eyes my family
asked me why I couldnt sleep, and I told thekm. Again my mother-and father-inlaw
told me it was my imagination, and all my neice could say was told you
so.&nbsp; And I told myn husband about it when I got home and he said its
possible, he expereinced some things in that house, actually all his siblings
have. And he also told me about the old couple that luived next to him
that died. One died in a hospital, and the other died at a family members
house.</b>

<p><b>ghost or imagination?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; fmoseley2003@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>hi!&nbsp; i really enjoy your site.&nbsp; i have a story for you.&nbsp;
my dauhgter</b>
<br><b>has experiences with the unknown.&nbsp; the ghosts seem attracted
to her.&nbsp; she</b>
<br><b>wants&nbsp; to know why it always picks on her and no one else in
the house.&nbsp; i</b>
<br><b>told her&nbsp; that some people are more sensitive than others and
they don't notice</b>
<br><b>odd&nbsp; things that happen and that she needs to not let it bother
her as much</b>
<br><b>as&nbsp; she does. they don't seem to be evil, only mischevious.&nbsp;
the first time</b>
<br><b>she&nbsp; noticed anything was in 1999.&nbsp; she was 12 and i had
left my husband and</b>
<br><b>moved in with my parents taking her and her brother whom is 2 years</b>
<br><b>older&nbsp; than her.&nbsp; anyway, my mother had told us for years
that the house that</b>
<br><b>they&nbsp; now lived in was haunted and strange things had happened
over the last</b>
<br><b>10&nbsp; years.&nbsp; we had only been there for a couple of months
when one night my</b>
<br><b>daughter was fussing with her brother as most sibling do, and finally</b>
<br><b>they&nbsp; lay down to sleep.&nbsp; we were sleeping in the den(used
to be a garden</b>
<br><b>years&nbsp; ago before the previous home burned down with the old
couple inside).</b>
<br><b>anyway they had finally went to sleep.&nbsp; well my daughter screamed
and</b>
<br><b>came&nbsp; crying into the kitchen saying that her brother had slapped
her on the</b>
<br><b>back.&nbsp; i went into the den and her brother was fast asleep.&nbsp;
i talked her</b>
<br><b>back to&nbsp; bed and she came screaming back into the kitchen and
said something was</b>
<br><b>sitting on her feet and it was really cold and i felt her feet and
they</b>
<br><b>were&nbsp; ice cold.&nbsp; needless to say i woke her brother up
and we slept in the</b>
<br><b>living&nbsp; room that night.&nbsp; i went into the den with the
bible (i wasn't a real</b>
<br><b>religious person), but i read a prayer to that room and told the</b>
<br><b>spirits&nbsp; that if they were going to mess with anyone it better
be me not my</b>
<br><b>children.&nbsp; anyway, nothing else happened for a few weeks until
my mother had to</b>
<br><b>take&nbsp; my father to the dr and the kids were at school and i
was all alone.</b>
<br><b>now&nbsp; all this time in my mothers home i never felt uncomfortable
or</b>
<br><b>anything.&nbsp; i&nbsp; was sitting in the kitchen drinking coffee
that morning and all of a</b>
<br><b>sudden&nbsp; i heard a puppy crying in the living room, i automatically
got up and</b>
<br><b>went&nbsp; to check it out when i realized my mother doesnt have
a puppy and the</b>
<br><b>dog&nbsp; she does have was in the laundry room asleep.&nbsp; i
was creeped out and i</b>
<br><b>went&nbsp; back into the kitchen and acted like i didn't hear it,
and soon my</b>
<br><b>parents&nbsp; returned.&nbsp; i told them what happened and they
laughed at me and told me</b>
<br><b>that&nbsp; was nothing.&nbsp; that for ten years they had put up
with the sinks turning</b>
<br><b>on&nbsp; by themselves, the cabinets opening on their own, seeing
black shadow</b>
<br><b>people&nbsp; walking down their hallway, having pictures rotating
on their walls so</b>
<br><b>much&nbsp; that they nail them to the walls to keep them from moving,
my brothers</b>
<br><b>when&nbsp; they were younger would wake up and go to the bathroom
and come back</b>
<br><b>and&nbsp; find a knife in their beds or their closet doors which
were sliding</b>
<br><b>doors&nbsp; would slam open and shut on their own.&nbsp; one time
my yougest brother</b>
<br><b>says he&nbsp; had just laid down for the night and a purple ball
of light came at him</b>
<br><b>and&nbsp; zapped him, he couldn't move and when he could he ran
screaming down</b>
<br><b>the&nbsp; hallway to my mothers room and she says he was petrified
and the hair</b>
<br><b>on his&nbsp; head was sticking straight up.&nbsp; he did not sleep
in his room for a long</b>
<br><b>time.&nbsp; these things happened off and on over the years and
they just</b>
<br><b>got&nbsp; used to all this wierd crap going on.&nbsp; they had freinds
visit from out</b>
<br><b>of&nbsp; town and the wife refused to come back because she swore
she saw a</b>
<br><b>black&nbsp; shadow figure going up and down the hallway all night.&nbsp;
other people</b>
<br><b>have&nbsp; came over and have mentioned seeing someone going down
the hallway, but</b>
<br><b>noone would be there.&nbsp; they still live in this house to this
day.&nbsp; they</b>
<br><b>investigated the land and found out that their side of town was</b>
<br><b>originally a&nbsp; lake and when they dammed part of it up homes
were built and the</b>
<br><b>original&nbsp; house was a tiny shack with an old couple living
their with their</b>
<br><b>daughter&nbsp; and her baby.&nbsp; they had a garden right outside
their back door and</b>
<br><b>would go&nbsp; work in it every day, this garden was where the den
is now.&nbsp; there was</b>
<br><b>a&nbsp; fire an it killed them all.&nbsp; my mom and dad have seen
an old woman</b>
<br><b>standing&nbsp; in their closet grinning at them.&nbsp; and they
all have heard the baby</b>
<br><b>crying&nbsp; in the closet many times.&nbsp; my mother says sometimes
she hears frogs</b>
<br><b>croaking&nbsp; in the closet and their is no way under the house
unless you take the</b>
<br><b>metal&nbsp; grill out of the concrete that is all around their home.&nbsp;
me and the</b>
<br><b>kids&nbsp; moved on to kansas with my new fiance, now husband, and
it is now 2003.</b>
<br><b>my&nbsp; daughter has had some experiences in our new home that
we purchased. it</b>
<br><b>was&nbsp; built in the early 1900's and other families have lived
their and as</b>
<br><b>far as&nbsp; we know no one has died there.&nbsp; after we had lived
there for about six</b>
<br><b>months i would go downstairs (my bedroom at that time was upstairs
with</b>
<br><b>my&nbsp; daughter and sons, our 8 yr old only came on the weekends
and slept on</b>
<br><b>the&nbsp; couch, the rest of the time she was at her mothers thru
the week) to</b>
<br><b>the&nbsp; kitchen after my son and daughter were gone to school
and my husband</b>
<br><b>gone to&nbsp; work, the kitchen cabinets would all be wide open
every morning.&nbsp; i</b>
<br><b>have a&nbsp; galley style kitchen with floor to ceiling cabinets,
counter inbetween.</b>
<br><b>some of these cabinets were so high that i couldn't shut them without</b>
<br><b>jumping to shut the door and i am 5'9.&nbsp; i accused everyone
of leaving</b>
<br><b>them&nbsp; open out of laziness and all denied leaving them open.&nbsp;
this has</b>
<br><b>continued&nbsp; to this day about 5 or 6 times a month instead of
every day.&nbsp; i also</b>
<br><b>would&nbsp; come home for my hour lunch every day and see a black
cat run from the</b>
<br><b>dining room to the den, and at that time we had a chocolate colored
cat</b>
<br><b>named ruby, and i would follow it to the den(that is where i kept
her</b>
<br><b>food,&nbsp; on top of the floor to ceiling shelves in the den to
keep the dogs from</b>
<br><b>eating her food) and call her, here ruby and she would not be in
there</b>
<br><b>at&nbsp; all.&nbsp; i would look all over the house and puzzled
because i always</b>
<br><b>found&nbsp; ruby outside on the porch or in another room not even
close to the den</b>
<br><b>and&nbsp;&nbsp; because i cleary saw a cat run from one room to
another.&nbsp; this happed</b>
<br><b>about&nbsp; 3 or 4 times.&nbsp; my family thought i was nuts so
i tried not to mention</b>
<br><b>these&nbsp; occurances to anyone but my daughter whom beleived me.&nbsp;
any way, me and</b>
<br><b>my&nbsp; husband got to keep our youngest daughter for the entire
summer and we</b>
<br><b>moved&nbsp; down to the basement and gave her our sons room and
he got our old</b>
<br><b>bedroom&nbsp; upstairs, due to it having a walkin closet.&nbsp;
he has slept in that room</b>
<br><b>and&nbsp; never had his bed shake in there.&nbsp;&nbsp; during the
time i saw the cat and</b>
<br><b>the&nbsp; cabinet were opening my daughter ran screaming into my
room one night</b>
<br><b>saying&nbsp; that her bed was shaking.&nbsp; her stepfather told
her it was probably the</b>
<br><b>furnace down in the basement making it move.&nbsp; she wasn't convinced
that</b>
<br><b>was&nbsp; it.&nbsp; this continued off and on.&nbsp; one night she
cleaned her room and</b>
<br><b>shut her&nbsp; closet door which was the shutter sliding type and
it ranalong an</b>
<br><b>entire&nbsp; wall.&nbsp; she heard rustling noises in the closet
and figured it was her</b>
<br><b>brother in their getting ready to jump out and scare her.&nbsp;
she was just</b>
<br><b>about to tell him to get out of her room when he knocked on her
door</b>
<br><b>and&nbsp; told her she had a phone call.&nbsp; needless to say she
slept downstairs in</b>
<br><b>the&nbsp; living room that night.&nbsp; she says she will shut her
light out, go</b>
<br><b>downstairs&nbsp; or go across the hall to the bathroom and when
she gets back to her</b>
<br><b>room the&nbsp; light will be on.&nbsp; or she will leave her light
on and when she gets</b>
<br><b>back it&nbsp; will be off.&nbsp; the bed still shakes occasionally
but now i think she is</b>
<br><b>used&nbsp; to it.&nbsp; once i asked her brother why he would never
sleep in his room</b>
<br><b>upstairs and he said he was tired of his bed shaking (this was before</b>
<br><b>he got&nbsp; to move into our old bedroom) his sister and i told
him our experiences</b>
<br><b>and&nbsp; he did not beleive us and neither did my husband.&nbsp;
6 more months go by</b>
<br><b>and&nbsp; my daughter has another experience.&nbsp; she was in bed
and had just laid</b>
<br><b>down&nbsp; to go to sleep when she saw a tall black shadow block
out the night</b>
<br><b>light&nbsp; shining from the bathroom across from her room, it crossed
her door way</b>
<br><b>and&nbsp; went into her younger sisters room.&nbsp; she saw lights
flickering in there</b>
<br><b>and&nbsp; thought the tv was on.&nbsp; then it hit her that she
had turned her sisters</b>
<br><b>tv&nbsp; off before going to her own room and the shadow she saw
was too tall to</b>
<br><b>be&nbsp; her 8 year old sister, then her bedroom door started to
slowly shut by</b>
<br><b>itself, she ran screaming down the stairs, fell, ran screaming thru
the</b>
<br><b>house to the dining room where the basement door was(our bedroom)
and</b>
<br><b>begged&nbsp; me to come upstairs.&nbsp; we turned all the lights
on and checked</b>
<br><b>everywhere and&nbsp; noone was in her room or her sisters room,
because her sister was</b>
<br><b>asleep&nbsp; downstairs on the couch and her brother was asleep
in his bed after</b>
<br><b>working&nbsp; harvest until 10 pm. so he was fast asleep.&nbsp;
she got her blankets and</b>
<br><b>fan&nbsp; and went into the den to sleep on the couch, i left my
basement door</b>
<br><b>open in&nbsp; case she needed me. she is 16 and was petrified.&nbsp;
anyway, the next</b>
<br><b>morning i&nbsp; found her in the living room sleeping on the couch
with her sister</b>
<br><b>instead&nbsp; of in the den.&nbsp; she told me that the bathroom
door which is in the den</b>
<br><b>was&nbsp; open only about 2 inches, when she looked at it later
it was open all</b>
<br><b>the&nbsp; way, that freaked her out and she took her fan and blanket
and got on</b>
<br><b>the&nbsp; couch in the living room with her sister and just about
the time she</b>
<br><b>was&nbsp; going to sleep she heard someone walk thru the living
room and they</b>
<br><b>walked&nbsp; in front of the fan, that noise it makes when someone

<p><b>My Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; cmccord1863@netzero.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Me and my family have lived in this house for about two years now,
and</b>
<br><b>when when we first moved in I started getting these weird feelings
like</b>
<br><b>someone was watching me. Well last week my mom woke up early one</b>
<br><b>morning to see a dark shadowy figure standing at the foot of her
bed,but when</b>
<br><b>she turned her lamp on it disapeared and then last night I was sitting</b>
<br><b>on my bed when I heard what sounded like a loud whisper coming from
our</b>
<br><b>kitchen and I really couldn't make the words out, but when I turned
and</b>
<br><b>looked in the kitchen there was no one there, and I know it couldn't
of</b>
<br><b>been my mom or my dad because both were in the bed asleep. But that
was</b>
<br><b>my first ghost experience and it totally freak me out to say the
least,</b>
<br><b>but i've always believe in ghost.</b>

<br><b>happenings in my house</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; ghosttank14@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>A lot of wierd things go on in my house. Not one or two weeks pass
without somthing happening. A five or six months ago when we first moved
in my mom just got done putting all the pots and everything away in the
cabinets and she had one open that she forgot to close and this coffee
pot that was sitting in the back of the cabinet where it could not have
possibly had fallen out but a few minutes later the glass pot fell out
and sdhattered on the floor. then the next week when i was sleeping i starte
hearing scratching on the walls like fingernails scratching on it. we did'nt
have a cat at the time and my stepdad was sleeping in the other room. Then
two weeks after that my baby sisters little bathtub was wedged in the corner
of the two walls where it couldnt have fell and it fell. Then two weeks
later i had to go to the bathroom around 11:00 p.m. and the rest of the
house was dark and so was my bedroom next to the bathroom. So when I turned
the bathroom off a few seconds later my touch tone light turned on by its
self.</b>
<br><b>Then s couple of weeks after that the light in my baby sisters changing
room turned on by its self. And both my mom and stepdad were asleep. Then
nothing else wierd in the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;house happened for a while until just the middle of last month
and the begining of this month when i got a camera for graduation. I told
my mom it wasnt working right. When she was checking it out the light on
the camera was not on and niether was the kitchen</b>
<br><b>and my mom told me an orb flew across the screen. Then that early
that morning when my mom slept in my room she said that the strobe light
in my room turned on. She went and checked it out and the knob on it was
on off. She then was almost back to sleep when it turned on again so my
mom unplugged it. Earlir this week my playstation 2 turned on by itself
. Also when you are in the basement of the house you get the sensation
of being watched from the back room down there. I would like to video tape
my house but I keep forgeting to. My friend has a book on his house which
used to be Colonel Harmon's plantation house and the area that him and
i live in about every house has a story and is haunted.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Cold Hands</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; Rpopgirl112@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Well, my grandma died about 3 years ago from lung cancer. Soon after,
her mother-my great grandmother- died from a heart attack. Soon after my
great grandma died I was just sitting at the lunch table at school when
suddenly I heard someone call my name. I quickly looked up to my friends
and asked,"What?" They just kind of stared at me. And said "We didnt say
anything" So I put my head back down. Then I heard it again but this time
it sounded more like my grandma, her old soft worn voice. I was totally
FREAKED but my friends didnt believe me. A couple months ago, I was sitting
in my living room when suddenly my bedroom door just flung open! I thought
it was just the wind but then it shut again and the knob turned and closed
all the way! I started shaking and nobody was home! Then oneday we where
at church (my grandma always went to church with us)&nbsp; at the end of
the service we all hold hands and sing. Nobody was holding my left hand
and my mom was holding my right hand. Suddenly I felt cold hands grab my
hands. We were praying so I had my eyes closed and thought someone had
just come up and held my hand. But when I looked up, no one was there and
I could smell my grandma's perfume. And just yesterday I was sleeping in
my room, when I heard footsteps walking around me but no one was there!
I'm getting shivers just thinking about it!!!</b><b></b>
<p><b>I love the idea that my grandmas' are watching over me but they could
at least warn me when they come! LOL!</b><b></b>

<br><b>Don't tease the dead</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; samajs@earthlink.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is a true story and it taught me about respect for the dead,
very quickly. My family and I love to visit historic sites and we decided
to take a ride to Valley Forge. It is a beautiful spot in Pennsylvania
but many sad things happened there due to the Revolutionary War. Many men
lost there lives there because of starvation from lack of food-they even
ate bark off of trees or chewed on their leather shoe laces (those who
still had shoes/boots) it was that bad. Plus the severe cold and deep snow
of that particular winter, the lack of warm clothes, blankets, and boots
brought about a desperate situation where many good men died. They also
lost their lives due to only a few doctors being able to help the sick,
wounded, diseased or dying and not enough bandages and lack of medicine.
They have a museum you can visit that goes into detail and then you are
free to walk around. Well we took advantage of this lovely day, it was
still winter and brisk but the sun shone brightly and was melting the snow.
Due to the snow melting here and there it left the fields and buildings
you had to walk in a rather muddy place with patches of snow here and there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I have always been a logical person even though my family has many
superstitions because they come from the old country and brought with them
the ghost tales, evil spirits stories and much more- and have always taught
me to respect the dead. For instance be respectful in cemeteries-don’t
laugh or make fun of a person’s name. We also were taught don’t walk on
a grave and if you did to explain out loud that you meant no harm and no
disrespect, and similar things like that. I did it too basically appease
my elder family members as a child but grew up to think that such things
were just old wives tales. Boy was I wrong. I think our ancestors knew
a lot more then we do sometimes about these types of things but we shake
it off in these “modern” times as fairy tales.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>We had been visiting many of the cabins in which the men lived and
died, and taking in all the history. Evening was coming upon us because
we had been there all day. I had on a brand new wool navy winter coat and
I buttoned it a little tighter because it was getting chilly with evening
falling upon us all. We entered this one cabin that was just the basic
rustic log cabin and I decided to joke around, laughing and having fun.
There were 6 of us in this little cabin and I started to grab my ankle
and pretend that I had been wounded in the original “war” at Valley Forge.
I was limping around just in fun and pretending when I said out loud “Ouch
Ouch I am hurt, it’s my ankle- is there a doctor in the house?” The words
were no sooner out of my “big” mouth when all of a sudden I felt a hand
on the base of my back and yet no one was behind me I was the only one
standing in the back of the cabin all the others were in front of me standing
on the sides. This unseen “person” then pushed me with such force that
I was lifted a little off my feet and thrown from the back of the cabin
right out the door passing all the other people in my group who screamed
because they saw me basically being thrown out of this log cabin but couldn’t
see the “person” doing it. I landed right outside the cabin in the middle
of a big mud puddle with some snow around me in my new winter coat. The
group of people came running out still in disbelief with how they saw me
thrown from the cabin and making sure I was fine. Now here is the odd part
and the sense of humor this “ghost” had. I was in the middle of this mixture
of mud and snow and some of the ladies said “Oh no your new coat will be
covered in mud.” I stood up to get out of the mud and brush my coat off
but when I stood up there was not one speck of dirt, mud, or snow on my
coat- completely like new. My family from the ages of 60’s to my children
pre-teens couldn’t believe it because I had landed hard on my backside
in the middle of this mud puddle. Yet my coat was as good as new and DRY,
not wet from the puddle at all. But, remember earlier in the story I had
joked about needed a doctor because I pretended to have a bad ankle. When
I stood up I now had a painful, sprained ankle to teach me my lesson I
guess! The ghost must have been laughing to see me limping away yet was
also kind enough to not have ruined my new coat. I then said out loud “I
am sorry for my teasing, I meant no harm.” I have learned whether we are
here in the flesh or betwixt and between in the spirit realm to respect
everyone the living and the dead.</b>
<br><b>This is a true story as I have stated before and the witnesses still
mention it to this day at family gatherings.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Enjoy and don’t poke fun at those of us who have gone to the spirit
realm-they just might make the joke on you!</b>

<p><b>Providence, RI...Haunting on Federal Hill</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; destinee.anderson@totallogistic.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I attended college in Providence.&nbsp; I lived in the dorms for
the first</b>
<br><b>two years, and then moved out for my junior year with a bunch of
friends</b>
<br><b>into this big old five bedroom house on "the hill"-Federal Hill
to be</b>
<br><b>exact-an old-style Italian neighborhood.&nbsp; The first time I
walked into</b>
<br><b>that house, I had the feeling of a presence, of someone watching
me.</b>
<br><b>Before we moved in, we cleaned up a lot, painted and what not.&nbsp;
One</b>
<br><b>afternoon, I was painting the baseboards in my bedroom, while my
friends</b>
<br><b>painted my walls.&nbsp; They were across the room, against the outside
wall.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>was near the inside wall, near the hallway.&nbsp; All of a sudden,
I heard a</b>
<br><b>faint knocking sound coming from the wall, and a garbled voice,
and</b>
<br><b>what I heard was my name.&nbsp; No one else was in the house but
us.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>friends were talking amongst themselves, so I know it wasn't them,
and they</b>
<br><b>heard nothing either.</b><b></b>
<p><b>My roommate Lindsay moved in before all of us, and swore she saw
white</b>
<br><b>apparations in the bathroom and her bedroom.&nbsp; She too felt
like she was</b>
<br><b>being watched.&nbsp; She also said she heard someone calling her
name</b>
<br><b>faintly more than once.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The foyer downstairs was the creepiest, even in broad daylight, it
held</b>
<br><b>an ominous darkness, the wallpaper bearing pictures of old time
men and</b>
<br><b>women, who appeared as though to be looking directly at you.&nbsp;
The weird</b>
<br><b>thing was, we found a religious statue in the foyer before we moved
in,</b>
<br><b>facing the corner.&nbsp; We were so freaked out by it, we moved
it to the</b>
<br><b>backyard.</b><b></b>
<p><b>After we were done painting and we were settled, the occurrences
seemed</b>
<br><b>to dissipate, as though whatever spirits had settled along with
us.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>never felt a malovent presence, but almost like discontentment...if
you</b>
<br><b>can understand that.&nbsp; I found out later, that my roommate had
a friend</b>
<br><b>come in and do a "cleansing", with mirrors and what not.&nbsp; And
she said</b>
<br><b>she felt a presence there, of a man named John, and the most activity</b>
<br><b>was in the foyer!!&nbsp; I learned all of this after the fact, mind
you.</b>
<br><b>Because we were curious about the foyer, another roommate, Lauren,&nbsp;
and I</b>
<br><b>decided to measure the house.&nbsp; The first floor was exactly
60 feet end</b>
<br><b>to end.&nbsp; We went down into the basement and measured again,
accounting</b>
<br><b>for the thickness of the wall we could see the diameter of, and
lo and</b>
<br><b>behold, the house was 5 feet shorter!!&nbsp; Now the intelligent
college</b>
<br><b>students we were, we deduced there must have been something on the
other</b>
<br><b>side of the far wall, which happened to be directly under the foyer!&nbsp;
No</b>
<br><b>wall would be five feet thick, and why would they start the basement</b>
<br><b>like that?&nbsp; The other side appeared to be normal...</b><b></b>
<p><b>As for the basement itself, my two other roommates Jeremy and Sean
were</b>
<br><b>down there one day, when all the lights in the basement went out</b>
<br><b>simultaneously, while the rest of the house stayed lit.&nbsp; They
quickly ran</b>
<br><b>upstairs, and the lights promptly turned back on...coincidence?</b><b></b>
<p><b>Now, after we moved out, my friend Jason (who also lived there for
a</b>
<br><b>short time) claims he saw a man in his room several times while
he was</b>
<br><b>half-awake.&nbsp; I don't know whether to truly believe him or not,
but this</b>
<br><b>is his version.&nbsp; He usually went to bed late, and left the
TV on to fall</b>
<br><b>asleep to.&nbsp; He had the largest room, so the light from the
TV shrouded</b>
<br><b>the room in a eerie blue light at times.&nbsp; One night, he awoke
for no</b>
<br><b>particular reason, only to claim to see a man near his doorway,
shrouded</b>
<br><b>by this eerie blue TV light...his back was turned, he was wearing
a</b>
<br><b>flannel shirt...Jason either said something or the guy just turned
around,</b>
<br><b>and Jason said his face was completely lit by the blue light, and
it</b>
<br><b>was a messed up, scary face, not normal at all...then the guy just
kind</b>
<br><b>of faded away into the blue light near the door.&nbsp; He said it
happened a</b>
<br><b>couple times in one month, and then never again.&nbsp; He ended
up moving</b>
<br><b>out, but not because of the ghost encounter.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Jason also said he saw this white haze in my closet before we moved</b>
<br><b>in...he told me later, after I had already felt something odd about
that</b>
<br><b>very same closet, and always kept the door closed to it while I
slept,</b>
<br><b>and my back always toward the wall, because I felt like I couldn't
turn</b>
<br><b>my back on the closet.</b>

<p><b>my life and ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; yailenmd@yahoo.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is a very personal story and I am aware that the whole point
of the website is to tell other people stories, but i wish that at least
my personal data remains undisclosed. I didn't include names or places.
Ever since I was a little girl i have had feelings that i can see and feel
weird things, i have told parts of my story to many different people, but
no one has ever believed me and therefore i have never told anyone the
whole story. When I was two years old my mother and I had no place to live
and were renting a small room that was too far from when my mom worked,
one of my mother's friends told her about this old lady that needed someone
to take care of her and she would let us live with her for free. The lady
in question was a schizophrenic who had lost her mother and father, and
shortky after her workplaced had been burned down, she also smoked more
than 2 packs of cigarettes and day and her apartment smelled like feces
and the walls looked like they were covered in them. She freaked me out.
her furniture was old and had a deep smell of something that was being
burned alive. The room where she slept was a dark room with a window and
inside backyard in the building and a other to another backyard on the
inside fo the building. They were both shut and smeely with humidity. The
lady would always stay up all night smoking sitting on a rocking chair
and it would keep me awake all night with the stench of her cigarettes
and the sound of the rocking chair sliding on the floor tiles until my
mom stood up and asked her to go to sleep. She died a few years later from
her smoking and i inherited her room. My mother and I cleaned the whole
house( which she wouldn't allow us to do while she was living) andpainted
the house white and fixed and opened windows. Most of her furniture was
taken away by the la 's relatives. Her bedroom furniture remained and I
inherited it. Shortly after her death I started hearing the rocking chair
in the middle of the night and the house started smelling like cigarettes
again, even when my mother wouldn't allow anyone to smoke there. I started
developing a paranoia and would only be able to sleep with my mother, i
told her about the rocking chair sound and she told me it was just me.
But invaraibly when i couldn't sleep from the sounds, they stopped as soon
as my mom stood in the living room doorway. Many years later i overheard
my mom telling a friend that she did hear the sounds but wouldn't tell
me because she was afraid i would get even more paranoid. The lady left
me a doll behind, an antique doll from the twenties that closed its eyes
when it was lying dow. One night its eyes stopped closing and i always
had that feeling that it was the old lady staring at me through the plastic
pupils. I threw the doll down the balcony and enjoyed my short lived victory
over her spirit. I was around three at the time. My grandmother on my moms
side lived in another province, she is a high priestess of Santeri (an
afrocuban religion that deals with spirits). She is kinda like a medium
and can read tarot card sand do a whole lot of witchcrafts and stuff. She
told us when she visited us that the ladys spirit didnt mean any wrong,
but that we were the only ones that ever treated her right, since her family
had abandoned her and that that was the reason why she had stayed to watch
over us. My grandma also told me i had the sight. I laughed at this and
swore to myself that spirits were not real as my mom had so many times
told me. After this, my mother placed a glass of water and a pack of smokes
on top of the dresser and put the rocking chair in the balcony where we
couldn't hear it. The next year I visited my grandmother in her house and
one day she went to do one of her channeling things at on of her clients
house. I stayed in her house looking at all of her clay saints her altar
and playing with her tarot cards. A man with white clothes came in the
door which was opened, i sayed hi to him and he asked if my grandmother
was there calling her by her first name which nobody called her by since
evn i called her by her nickname. I replied that she wasnt home and offered
the gentleman to sit and wait, he asked my for a glass of water and told
me that i looked a lot like my greatgrandmother whom i had never met. I
went into the kitchen and took a glass of water and when i came back he
was gone, i thought this was rude and told my grandmother when she came
back. she got very agitated and showed me a picture and asked me if it
was the same man. It was a picture of her dad whom i had never met either.
I saw the spirit of my greatgrandfather who usually visited my grandmother
in her dreams. I ca still remember that today even though i was only 4
years old. The memories i have of spirits are the only ones i remember
of my early childhood. After that my grandmother started taking me to her
sessions and I would talk to people who no one else could see, and i used
to think that everyone was crazy because they couldn't see them, and everyone
thought i was crazy because of what i could see. My mother got scared over
all of this and changed her religion to christianity, trying to find a
"cure" for my problem. My grandmother was the only one that believed in
me at the time. I stopped seeing spirits when i was around 6 but I could
still feel their presence and hear them. I basically stopped seeing them
because I didn't want to, i got scared after i finally realized what death
was and that those people that i saw were dead, before i just thought that
adults were blind. The old lady kept visiting me and I would talk to her
until I moved from the house 2 years ago, she would never reply ofcourse
but i could feel her and here her moving in the house, that didn't scare.
But around when I was 7 years old i could eel a second presence which to
this point i don't know what or who it is. Its dark an doesn't like me.
My grandmother can't feel it and I seem to be the only one who can, since
other priestesses and priests of my religion visited the house and couldn't
feel it. A really old friend of my grandma told me it was my own strong
presence that was scaring me. Whatever it is always woke me up at night,
and i started sleeping with a light on. I could feel something laying on
my bed at night and i wuld wake up but keep my eyes close, afraid that
i would see what i didn't want to. While it was laying next to me i would
have dreams but i would be conscious at the same time, and in those dreams
i couldn't wake up of i would be with my feet and arms bound,and to this
day i am terrified of anyone binding or even holding my arms and feet for
too long. When I was in grade 9 , the grade nine class went to this 1 month
camp in the country side. One of the girls who i didn't know left home
the day before we were supposed to, she was picked up in a car. Someone
asked why she had left because she was in my dormitory, and without knwoing
what i said i replied that the girl's stepmother had died of cancer. Everyone
shushed me and i wondered why i said that. Next day when we went back I
found out that what i had sayed was true. That was just the begginning
of my premonitions. I stopped talking about the weird things that happenned
to me after that, I would think that horrible things were about to happen,
and they would shortly after adn i started to feel guilty, like i had killed
those who died after i thought so. All my premonitions weren't about death,
i would have thoughts like i was going to meet someone new and picture
them in my head, and it would happen, and i would get this feelings of
deja vu, or i would dream of a place and would visit it soon after. I moved
to my stepfathers home with my mother when i was fourteen. As soon as i
went through the door i could feel a very mischievious but not bad spirit.
It followed me wherever I went in the house and would close and open the
basements and front ors whenever i went downstairs, it didnt scare me,
but i was surprised taht even in another country i still had the same abilities,
before i just thought that i lived in a really old neighbourhood full of
spirits. So i asked my stepdad if someone had owned the house before, especially
and old man, i had the feeling that it was an old man. He sayed yes, and
got surprised when i told him about the doors, because that never happened
to him before. One day while sitting at the computer chatting at night
i saw his reflection on the screen but turned around and couldn't see him.
Like i sayed before, im not able to see spirits anymore for whatever reason.
My mom got scared when i told her this and asked my stepdad if we could
move. My stepfather owned the house next door, so he announced that we
could move as soon as the tenants moved out. After they did, a week before
we were to move I was feeling really sick and had this really bad feeling
around me. My dog felt it too and started yelping for no reason, and i
started to cry for no obvious reason too. This was last november. That
night i couldnt sleep, at around 12 oclock at night we heard a big noise
and the lights went out. We ran outside the house with a flashlight and
saw that a car was smashed against the light post in front of the house
next door. I grabbed my digital camera which i usually have close by and
ran towards the accident. When i got around 10 feet of the accident my
heart started racing and i stopped breathing, i dropped to the ground but
because it was dark my mom and my stepdad couldnt see me since they were
trying to help the girl in the car. I felt as someone had stepped on my
neck and was choking me. the energy from the girl was so strong i couldn't
get close to her. I knew she was dying then and was trying to hold on to
my energy so she wouldn't have to go. I finally was able to stand up and
heard my dog barking, i got close to the car but couldnt get closer than
5 feet because it sucked me in. I took some pictures and tried to get my
brea back. I went back home and layed in the couch with my dog and some
candles while my stepdad and my mom were outside. I thoughed that she would
survive because i could feel her energy. the paramedics told us the next
day that she died within five minutes of the accident, when i felt i was
choking. I guess the energy i felt after was her spirit lingering around.
I didnt tell anyone about this since they wouldnt believe me. A week later
we moved to the other house which is directly in front of the place where
she died. My first night in the new house I was sleeping when around three
in the morning i had the feeling that my chest was being pulled up and
at the same time that something was pushing my chest down. It was the weirdest
thing, because i was semiconscious at the time, then i would force myself
to wake up. I made myself think that i was just dreaming, but as soon as
i was starting to doze off again i would experience the same thing. After
and hour of this ( i looked at my clock) i went to sleep in my parents
bed, something i hadnt done since i was three and felt my first spirit.
I somehow knew that this was related to the dead girl. It was ok after
that. On the new light post that was placed where she crashed her family
placed a picture of her and flowers and teddy bears. Every day when i walked
by there i could feel her presence and i cried, this continued happening
for about a month. I finally bought her some flowers and sat close to where
her picture was ( i cant approach her spirit too cloes, it is too strong
for me still) and i talked to her, saying that i was sorry about what happened
but that i couldnt do anything to change it. I didnt feel her again until
april this year when one night while sleeping i got the same feeling again
like i couldnt breath and i was semiconscious but couldnt move, i woke
up and moved to my parents room, but this time it didnt stop then and i
could feel myself dragged out of my body again by my chest and i tried
to scream for my mom but i couldnt i was just screaming n my head, i started
shaking and my mom started asking me what was wrong, as soon as my mom
touched me it stopped. Next day, my stepfathers mother passed away. I went
to see her body before it was cremated but i didnt feel her there. At the
funeral i felt her and heard her walking around her children hugging them
while they cried, at one point she even touched my hair and asked me to
take care of my stepdad for her and to put pink roses on her grave later,
they are her favorites, then i couldnt feel her any longer. Meanwhile when
i returned to my house the spirit of the girl started tormenting me again,
I stood across the road and yelled for her to leave me alone and stop blaming
her death on me. That night i dreamt that she was talking to me and telling
me that i couldve died for her if i wanted, and i got really scared at
that point, i started sleeping with my light on again. A week after my
stepgrandma's funeral i found my budgie bird dead at the bottom of his
cage, and he was only 2 years old and really healthy. I buried him in the
backyard and can still hear him singing sometimes. A month ago i bought
a ticket to go visit my family back in where i used to live and called
my best friend to tell her the good news, we started planning on all the
things we were going to do, a week later she had an accident in a train
and died from a head injury, she was the only one that died in the train
crash, everyone else got only scratches. I cried and screamed at the post
where the smiling picture of the girls remain and called the cops so that
they wouldnt allow the girls family to keep putting flowers and teddy bears
in front of our house. It may sound horrible, but i had the feeling that
she was killing everything i love. Last week, my dog was runover coming
from the light post when she was crossing the street, she died five minutes
after in my arms right in front of of the stupid girls face, and aftyer
i buried my dog next to my bird, i when to where the picture was and tried
to rip it but my mom prevented m from doing it, i got closer that ever
to it, but the choking feeling was too strong anyways for me to have even
touched the picture. I told my mother and stepfather about this and they
think im just traumatized for all the deaths close to me on the past 2
months, no one believes me and im just desperate for help, i feel her presence
all the time now, always strong and always the choking sensation when i
walk by like i have to everyday. i believe that she is coming for me next...i
was never really scared of spirits except for that time when i felt a dark
presence, but this time is worse, i have seen and talked to spirits amny
times. why is this one trying to hurt me?? can a spirit or ghost really
kill those around you?? or then what is it? am i really crazy, please reply
to me because i really need help, i am only sixteen and feel like im insane</b><b></b>

<p><b>Strange Occurences in Apartment</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; AZ2NM2003@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My experience takes place around March of 1994. My ex-wife and I
had just started dating a few months before. We had moved in with a friend
of hers to help out, as her friend was a single mother. This takes place
in the east part of town in Phoenix, Arizona. This was a 2 story townhouse
with two bedrooms, and the main bathroom upstairs. With the livingroom,
kitchen, and a smaller bathroom downstairs. Well, wierd things started
happening almost right away. The faucet in the downstairs bathroom sink
would turn on all by itself, and the toilet would also flush on it's own,
too. And no one was in there. We all began to think that there was a ghost
in the house. One night, my ex-wife, her friend, another friend, and I
decided to use a Ouija board to see if there really was a ghost in the
house or not. Very stupid! Don't ever do that! They are real, not a toy!
You never know what can happen! Anyway, we had all of the lights in the
house off. We used a few candles for light. My ex-wife's friend had a little
boy, who was upstairs sleeping in his room. I really don't remember what
questions we asked the spirit on the Ouija board, but I know we asked it's
name. I cannot recall what it's name was, but it was not friendly at all.
The more questions we asked, the more angry it got. Eventually, it stopped
answering questions altogether. The candles blew out, and there was no
air conditioner on, and there was no fans on or windows opened. And no
one blew them out. We lit the candles again. We decided to put the Ouija
board away, and just forget about the whole incident. Soon after, my ex-wife's
friend's room upstairs was always freezing cold. Again, even with no air
conditioner on, no fans blowing, and no windows open. For some reason,
this was the only cold room in the whole house. I mean it was very cold,
like going into a big walk-in freezer. One day, my ex-wife and I were the
only ones home. She was in the house somewhere else, but I swore I heard
her call me from her friend's upstairs bedroom. So I went upstairs, and
when I got to the room, the door slammed shut real hard right in front
of my face! I opened it, and looked inside. Nobody was there, and all of
the windows were closed. So it was not a gust of air or air pressure or
anything like that. But, the room was icy cold. So cold that I could see
my breath. My ex-wife came upstairs and into the room, asking me what was
going on. She said that she was downstairs in the kitchen. I told her what
happened, and she noticed also that the room was very cold. We let it go,
and went back downstairs. Things got a lot wierder after that. On one night,
my ex-wife and I were downstairs in the livingroom watching TV, and her
friend was in the upstairs bathroom giving her son a bath. Out of nowhere
there was a loud banging coming from upstairs. My ex-wife and I didn't
pay much attention to it, thinking it was her friend's son playing around
or whatever. The banging went on a few more times. Eventually, the friend
came downstairs and asked us why we were banging on the bathroom door.
We told her that we had not even been upstairs at all, but we had also
heard the banging and had thought that it was either her or her son. And
no one else was in the house, just the four of us. The friend had said
that the bathroom door was closed the whole time, and that it was not her
or her son banging on the door. Later that night, she was putting her son
to bed. His room was across from hers, with the stairs separating the two
rooms. She came out of his room with him in her arms, terrified. We asked
what was wrong. She said that she had put her son to bed, and was laying
down in bed next to him until he fell asleep. She saw a bright blue light
flashing and spinning around in the room. This light was not on a wall,
it was moving in mid air. There was only one window in the son's room,
and it faced the parking lot downstairs. The window was always closed and
so were the blinds. She even had a dark blanket over the window to keep
out light during the day so her son could take naps. So there was no way
that this light came from outside or from a car or anything. The room was
pitch black. She said the light even hovered above her for a few seconds,
then left. That is when she came downstairs. She got up enough courage
to tell her dad what was going on. He was a minister, so he came and blessed
the house. He found out that we had used a Ouija board, and he was pretty
upset with us over that. But after the blessing, nothing more happened.
This is a very true story, and I will never forget my experiences in that
house! I have a few more stories that I would like to share, but I will
save them for another time. Thank you for letting me tell my story.</b>

<br><b>possible haunting in Oklahoma</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; jana.majors@sbcglobal.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Jana, and my husband and I have reason to
suspect that we have purchased a haunted house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both of us are sensitives in general, and it
is my opinion that houses attract people, not the reverse, if you know
what I mean. Anyway, we bought our first home last July, a 1918 two story
home with a basement. I am going to go to the courthouse to see if I can
find any information concerning our home. I will give you a description
of what we have encountered.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We cannot take pictures without orbs appearing
in every room.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have cold pockets in the house that fluctuate.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two days ago I saw a full vapor in the hallway,
in the middle of the day. I was the only person in the home and had not
been smoking or burning candles. The vapor was large enough that I doubt
it would have mattered if I had.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sightings and energy seem to be increasing,
which troubles me somewhat.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We hear crashing noises at times, regardless
of the time of day or evening, or the relative humidity or other weather
conditions. This happens rarely. If a song is played over and over again
on a CD player, and then the unit is turned off, the song can be heard
in the opposite end of the house, very faintly, but clear enough to determine
it is the same tune.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We hear muffled conversations.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was cleaning out the closet under the
staircase and immediately got the emotional sense and mental images of
a Christmas Party that occurred in the late Forties or Early Fifties. It
was not unpleasant. In fact I "caught" the Christmas sprit for a few minutes.
In August.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a decorative painter and we have been renovating
this home. I know that disturbing a home lends to the possibility of increased
haunting activity, but at this time I am not working on any areas.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen a man in a top hat and spectacles.
There is also a woman with long skirts. I also sensed a very old woman
last year, as I began the renovation on the house. It was late at night
and quiet, yet it was enough to cause me to halt work for the evening and
leave the house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Late into the evening, at approximately three
or four a.m., I was awakened by a very loud knocking on my bedroom door.
I was not alone in the house. My stepchildren were soundly sleeping before
I went to bed. The knocking was hard enough to rattle the door in its frame.
The doors all have a three inch air space and the hall light was on. I
could see under the door. Thinking at first it was one of the children,
I looked to see if I could see someone standing in front of this air space.
There was nobody there. I knew on a visceral level that it was a supernatural
occurrence, so I went back to sleep. In the morning I asked the children
if they had heard the knocking. They had no idea what I was talking about.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The strangest occurrence happened when I was
alone in the house. My dog and I were jolted from a sound sleep at approximately
four a.m. on a Friday night. We could hear someone trying to use a key
to get into the house. The person succeeded and we heard him walking (I
say him because the tread was heavy and sounded male) up the stairs. The
bedroom door was locked. My first thought was that I should have had a
gun in the room. The second thought was that I should have had my cell
phone. Halfway up the stairs the footsteps were silenced, but I had the
feeling that the steps were continuing, we just no longer were able to
hear them. A few minutes later I heard a faint knocking on one of the doors
down the hallway.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atmospheric conditions were at 100% humidity
and had been for two days. When my alarm went off at 7:30 a.m. I turned
it off but got back into bed until the sky had lightened enough to see
outside. I cautiously opened the bedroom door and my little dog and I went
to investigate. There was no sign of entry.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sunday paper had a front page story about
a man mistakenly going into a house that used to be his home. The man was
drunk and was shot halfway up the stairs by the current homeowner. The
homeowners' wife called via cell phone to notify the police. The house
is situation two blocks from ours.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a powerful sense of energy in the basement.
It is very uncomfortable.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we moved into the house I kept getting this
mental picture of a very large spider. The spider was black and had a soft
body that was shaped like an egg standing on its smaller end. The spider
had many legs attached and skittered sideways for mobility. This was an
extremely disturbing image, and something I have not shared with anyone
until now. I used prayer and dismissal techniques to move the image from
my head. This phenomenon has gone from being extremely frequent to very
rare. This phenomenon was greatly curtailed after "the housekeeper's dream"
(see below). I have not asked my husband or stepchildren about this particular
event, as it seemed "out there" even for me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This home has had several owners. At one time
it was the rectory for an Episcopal church, for twenty-five years. I suspect
that services of all natures may have been done here, weddings and funerals
and counseling of all kinds, although it makes no sense, as the church
is less than one block away.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We live next door to what was a Lutheran church.
Now it is a&nbsp; Baptist Church, and has a handful of members. I wonder
if we are getting some kind of overspill of energy emanating from the church
next door.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have the sense of time stopped in the sunroom.
I don't know this for sure, but I suspect that this is where the priest
in residence wrote his sermons and counseled parishioners. The era in that
room "feels" in tune with the Christmas party I encountered in the coat
closet, Forties or early Fifties. I was born in the late Sixties, so I
have no personal reference as to the feeling of the Forties and Fifties.
I just somehow "know" that this is the time span.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have sensed the energy of a little girl sitting
on the stairs. The spirit seems to just watch us, and we get the impression
that she is staying up past her bedtime, peeking at a party or such. The
little girl does have a habit of tripping people as they go up and down
the stairs. Our housekeeper informed me that there was a presence on the
stairs, and I had not told her anything about our suspicions. She appeared
uneasy about the situation. When our dog goes up the stairs, he stops every
time at the area in question and pauses before completing the trip upward.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My housekeeper came to me excitedly the next
time she was scheduled to clean. She informed me that she'd had a dream
about our home, and told it to me in great detail. This woman is of average
intelligence and not very imaginative. Her eager and the intensive descriptive
quality of the dream leads me to suspect that she was on the astral planes
while sleeping. She said that the dream went like this--she was washing
the windows on the upper level, on the front of the house. Suddenly she
discovered four&nbsp; large drawers built into the front of our home. She
said that she found wedding clothes in each drawer. From left to right,
the clothes became older, more elaborate, and in even better condition.
Her excitement grew with each discovery, and she insisted that the fourth
set of wedding clothing was the best by far, and she felt certain that
these items were in the house, and were worth a lot of money, so much that
we would become famous.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This dream was so clear to her that she made
me stand in front of the house while she told it to me. I have found no
evidence of the wedding clothing in this home.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night I woke myself up fighting off a small
curly headed child who was trying to get into bed with me. I was alone
in the house. It was pitch black in the room so I didn't see the child.
I only felt it. I successfully pushed it away and when I opened my eyes
I was left with a sense that I was not in spiritual or physical danger.
This scared the shit out of me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the positive nature of the housekeeper's
dream, I am not so scared that I think that we should leave the house.
However, I would like very much for this activity to be verified by a qualified
ghost hunting team. I want to know if you can advise me on someone relatively
local, as we live in a small town in Oklahoma, and the closest team posted
on your site is in Oklahoma City. I've thought of purchasing a compass
or a reader you have available, but I feel my conclusions would be biased,
so I think an outside party is necessary. I have no problem with the spirit
activity remaining as long as it means no harm. I want to be certain that
this is the case, and we are not dealing with something malevolent or darker
in nature.</b>

<p><b>The Man in a Trench Coat</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dhoward@daymargroup.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This particular event occurred in a small town in Kentucky called
Beaver Dam. About five years ago (I was in High School) my friend came
to spend the night with me. It was really late and it was right after a
strong storm hit. We were setting in my living room having a girly chat.
I told my friend (We’ll call her Betsy) that I was going to bed. Betsy
told me that she wasn’t tired so she was gonna stay up a little while longer.
I was all rested into my bed when Betsy came running in my room and jumped
under the covers. She was terrified!!! I asked her what happened and she
refused to tell me about it until the next morning. When we got up I asked
her what happened last night. She made me promise that I wouldn’t tell
my parents. She said she was setting on the couch when she looked into
the kitchen and saw a man in a trench coat. She said he looked like he
was holding a baby.&nbsp; She was scared to pieces!!!! The unusual thing
about this event was that the previous owners said that they had seen the
man in a trench coat also. (I get goose bumps just thinking about this.)
About four weeks later my cousin and I were talking and I told her about
this. Her eyes became wide and she told me that she had a dream that a
man in a trench coat was standing at her front door. She got up to ask
her dad who it was and he (a preacher) told her to leave him alone that
he was Lucifer. Every time I would vacuum the living room I would see this
man out of the corner of my eye. He would stand outside the front door.
All of this is true, I PROMISE!!! Can you give me some information or something???
Thank you!!!!</b><b></b>

<p><b>Man in the Yard</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Daisy.Durfee@cshs.org</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When I was younger, about 12, my room was downstairs on the far right
corner</b>
<br><b>of the house. My dad had asked me to get ready for bed. I went to
my room</b>
<br><b>and put my pajamas on and decided to look out the window to see
the new snow</b>
<br><b>fall, (it was Thanksgiving time). As I cupped my hands around my
face and</b>
<br><b>looked out the window, I suddenly saw a face staring right at me.
He was a</b>
<br><b>tall guy with a beard and had on a trench coat. He wore a tall black
hat. He</b>
<br><b>didn't really make any face. He kind of looked sad. I, of course
jumped back</b>
<br><b>from the window and called to my dad to look out. Of course when
my dad</b>
<br><b>came, he was gone. Well, my dad went outside even to see if he could
find</b>
<br><b>footprints in the snow. There were none. It had stopped snowing,
so there</b>
<br><b>should have been some! Then on another occasion, my sister saw the
same man.</b>
<br><b>She was having a sleepover in the loft of our barn and had to go
to the</b>
<br><b>bathroom, as she was climbing down the stairs, she happened to look
down and</b>
<br><b>see him staring up at her, needless to say she waited til morning
to go down</b>
<br><b>the stairs. Also there were other instances where people saw him
roaming</b>
<br><b>around our yard. I never found out why he was there. He never made
noise,</b>
