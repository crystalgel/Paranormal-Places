</H3><P><B>by sjgeisle@fuse.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi! It's me Amber from Ohio again. I was reading some stories and I</B>
<P><B>thought of something that happened a few years ago. I need to take


you</B>
<P><B>back five years ago when my Aunt Sue who I loved with all my heart


died.</B>
<P><B>Everyone was so sad but no one was as sad as my mother who had been


her</B>
<P><B>best friend for 25 years. Okay two years ago my Aunt Linda was home</B>
<P><B>alone. Her house has two floors plus a furnished basement anyway she


had</B>
<P><B>just put clothes in the dryer which was in the basement and had


decided</B>
<P><B>she was going to take a shower while the clothes were drying. She


went</B>
<P><B>the second floor where the bathroom is. She shut the door and turned


on</B>
<P><B>the water when she heard someone in the hall call Linda twice.


Thinking</B>
<P><B>her husband came home she went to the top of the stairs and yelled


yes.</B>
<P><B>She was waiting for a reply when she smelled smoke a second later she</B>
<P><B>heard loud popping coming from the bathroom. She turned around and


saw</B>
<P><B>the bathroom on fire. Just so you will know the details, my Aunt's


dryer</B>
<P><B>caught on fire and it went up the laundry shoot that was in the


closet</B>
<P><B>of her bathroom.If she would have stayed in there just seconds longer</B>
<P><B>she would not be here today(there are no windows in her bathroom).
A few</B>
<P><B>days after the fire we (my mom, brother,and I) were helping her go</B>
<P><B>through her things to see if there was anything worth saving. We were


in</B>
<P><B>the basement where the fire started. There was this section of


shelves</B>
<P><B>where she kept certain things. There was one box that looked salvage</B>
<P><B>able, my mom was going through it noticing everything that was in was</B>
<P><B>wet or soot covered untill she reached the middle of the box. In the</B>
<P><B>middle of the box she noticed something that was dry and in perfect</B>
<P><B>condition. She pulled it out and it was a pale blue blouse. My Aunt</B>
<P><B>Linda started crying, when my mom asked what was wrong my Aunt said


that</B>
<P><B>it was Susies blouse. Sure enough it was and when my mom huged it


close</B>
<P><B>it still smelled of Sue's perfume. We all thanked her so much for


saving</B>
<P><B>Linda's life. I hope you like the story. I'm sorry it's so long.</B>

<H3><A NAME=silos>The Silos</A>
</H3><P><B>by askin@coweblink.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>This is a !00% true story that can have two other friends back it up

for</B>
<P><B>me.  There is an old building on the outskirts of Denver, Colorado</B>
<P><B>called the Silos.  The history of the Silos is that around fifty

years</B>
<P><B>ago, the Silos was an old warehouse and factory, near the old

railroad</B>
<P><B>tracks and rail yard.  The majority of the workers were young

children</B>
<P><B>snd teenagers.  This was before child labor laws were strictly</B>
<P><B>enforced.  Around this time, somebody had set the building on fire,</B>
<P><B>murdering all of the children that worked in there.  The building was</B>
<P><B>condemned and declared a safety hazard.  Rumor had it that the

wandering</B>
<P><B>spirits of the murdered children haunted this building.  The Silos

are</B>
<P><B>now inhabited by transients and runaway teens.  About six friends and

I</B>
<P><B>decided to take a trip to the Silos and find out for ourselves.  You</B>
<P><B>have to crawl underground in a crawl space to get into the pitch

black</B>
<P><B>basement that is littered with scorched factory equipment and rubble

and</B>
<P><B>even the broken elevator.  We explored all seven floors of the

building,</B>
<P><B>including the roof, finding nothing.  We were heading downstairs in

the</B>
<P><B>order that Bobby was first, I was second, and Kristen was third, with</B>
<P><B>the others a little bit behind.  The three of us were in the

staircase</B>
<P><B>leading to the basement when we heard unfamiliar voices.  The voices</B>
<P><B>turned out to be those of runaway teens who lived there.  We sat and</B>
<P><B>talked to the other teens who told us of the ghosts and their history.

</B>
<P><B>On our way out, we were all in the same order, heading to the

basement,</B>
<P><B>when I was talking to Bobby.  I saw somebody pass me down the

staircase,</B>
<P><B>along with a look of fright on Bobby's face.  I thought that it was</B>
<P><B>Kristen, so I looked behind me to see Kristen still behind me.  I</B>
<P><B>followed the glowing figure into the basement and watched it

illuminate</B>
<P><B>the entire basement to the point where I could see every detail in

the</B>
<P><B>room.  The figure suddenly vanished, as Bobby and I ran out as fast

as</B>
<P><B>we could.  Since, we have gone back a few times to find nothing more.

</B>
<P><B>It's hard to get in anymore, because it is literaly next door to

Coor's</B>
<P><B>Field, where the Colorado Rockies play, so security has been

heightened,</B>
<P><B>but I will never forget any detail of that night.</B>

<H3><A NAME=demons>The Demons</A>
</H3><P><B>by Lightenin5@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>when i was 11-13 i was terrified by several demons.  i was up late
at night when i saw the door to the bathroom close. My mom was asleep so
was my dad. I know thay were asleep because i went to their bedroom to see
who was up. then the light came on in the bathroom. I was curious so i got
the courage to open the door to the bathroom. i did not know what was going
to happen. so i open the door fast. there was nothing there. then, outside
my normal habits, I closed the door. i went to the den. and resumed watching
tv. i thought that it would calm my nerves down. right when i got my nerves
back in order the light came back on. and this time the toilet flushed. i
jumed to my feet. i ran to my moms room and woke her up.right when i woke
her up the door to the bathroom opened.the light turned off. my mom said
that it was nothing but i dont belive her. because about 3 days later i was

outside playing with my dogs. when all of a sudden i saw 2 red eyes peering
at me from the woods. i saw no body, just the eyes. i ran back in to my house.
i let my dogs in. &nbsp;i gazed back to see if the eyes were  still looking
at me. when i turned back they were in the window looking at me. i ran in
to the livingroom. i fell down, when i looked back they were gone. then ever

since i have felt like something was watching me. now that i have moved i
dont feel like someone is watching my every move.</B>

<H3><A NAME=help>Calls for Help</A>
</H3><P><B>by ldweller@bellsouth.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hello!!It's me again. I have another story for you about the area that

I</B>
<P><B>live in currnetly. The other day(actually night) my cousins ran into</B>
<P><B>their house and told their mom that they heard a woman crying for

help.</B>
<P><B>They have overactive imaginations as it is so she just thought that

they</B>
<P><B>were hearing things but just to make them happy she went outside and</B>
<P><B>listened for a few seconds. Of course she didn't hear anything. So

she</B>
<P><B>took her oldest daughter to the school for cheerleading practice.

When</B>
<P><B>she came back they all went back to what they were doing and forgot</B>
<P><B>about it. Well the kids came inside again and said they still heard

it</B>
<P><B>so she went and listened again except this time she heard it too. It</B>
<P><B>sounded like it was coming from across the road where 2 cerebral

palsy</B>
<P><B>kids lived. She thought one of them had been out riding and had

fallen</B>
<P><B>off the horse so she called the police and went over there to see if</B>
<P><B>they were ok. Well when she got over there everything was ok. She was</B>
<P><B>still hearing the calls for help so she went back home and listened

some</B>
<P><B>more until the police got there. Of course they didn't hear it either</B>
<P><B>but since she and the kids had both heard it they went around looking</B>
<P><B>for they lady. When the police cars got there I was curious as to

what</B>
<P><B>had happened so I went to see if anyhting was the matter. She told
me</B>
<P><B>what had happened and told me to listen. I stood there for a while
and I</B>
<P><B>didn't hear anything and as I was just giving up hope on hearing</B>
<P><B>anything there it was. A faint but distinguishible 'help'. I was

amazed.</B>
<P><B>There was actually someone out there. Up to that point I thought they</B>
<P><B>were all losing it. That convinced me to stay and listen some more.

Well</B>
<P><B>after a while I didn't hear anything so I was going to go home until

the</B>
<P><B>police gave word that they had found her. Well as I was walking to

the</B>
<P><B>gate I heard it again. This time closer. I turned to my aunt and she</B>
<P><B>said'Did you hear that?' I nodded and we went back once again. We

didn't</B>
<P><B>hear anything for another long time so we left and we didn't hear</B>
<P><B>anything this time. I went home and told my dad what was going on.
He</B>
<P><B>just laughed and said that he had heard it many times before. He

didn't</B>
<P><B>believe in ghosts so he shrugged it off as a prank. I don't think it

was</B>
<P><B>a prank though because I have had a few paranormal expieriences

before</B>
<P><B>and I believe in ghosts. The police never found anything and we

haven't</B>
<P><B>heard it since but there was never a body found or anything. I

beleive</B>
<P><B>it was a ghost. Judge for yourself.</B>

<H3><A NAME=us>U.S.  Consulate in Pakistan</A>
</H3><P><B>by usaemb@cs.net.au </B>
<P>
<P><B>This is a true story that happenned a few years ago and I am sure is</B>
<P><B>still happening to this day. At the time I was a Marine Guard at the</B>
<P><B>U.S.  Consulate in Karachi, Pakistan. Ever since arriving there I was</B>
<P><B>told by some of the other guys that the place was haunted. We were

the</B>
<P><B>only ones who knew about this because we were the only people in the</B>
<P><B>building late at night. There was a fountain in front of the building</B>
<P><B>this was supposed to be the burial site of a Muslim holy man and the</B>
<P><B>fountain constantly running was supposed to ease his spirit since a</B>
<P><B>building was placed where he was buried. There had been an incident</B>
<P><B>where a Marine a few years before had fired his weapon at something

he</B>
<P><B>could swear was a person. But it turned out that he just left a hole

in</B>
<P><B>the wall. At night strange things usually happened. The usual noises

and</B>
<P><B>alarms going off but this had happened at my last post and I

considered</B>
<P><B>it to be normal. But one night as I was walking through the building</B>
<P><B>around 2:00 a.m. a door behind me closed. I knew there was no one in

the</B>
<P><B>building with me and I had just observed this door closed as a walked

by</B>
<P><B>it. But nothing was in the room. Another incident was when I came to</B>
<P><B>work for a morning shift around 3:45 a.m. and the Marine I was

relieving</B>
<P><B>was pale white and acting like a little scared kid. I asked him what

was</B>
<P><B>wrong and he said that an hour or so before he had heard the most

bone</B>
<P><B>chilling scream he had ever heard in his life. The reason I believed

him</B>
<P><B>was we were both big armed Marines and ther would have been nothing

in</B>
<P><B>the world (physical anyway) that would have scared him like this.

Anyway</B>
<P><B>I finished my tour there and for the rest of my time there similar</B>
<P><B>incidents happened but none like these two. I hope this might

interest</B>
<P><B>someone.</B>

<H3><A NAME=few>A Few Stories</A>
</H3><P><B>by vakh@gstis.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>My stories are by no means scary at all.  Maybe just a little bit</B>
<P><B>spooky.</B>
<P><B>I grew up in a small town east of Seattle.  The house I grew up in

had</B>
<P><B>been in my family for years.  My great grandmother was born and

raised</B>
<P><B>there, my grandmother lived there during her childhood, then moved

back</B>
<P><B>into the house when she married my grandpa.  My mother lived there

for</B>
<P><B>thirty years, and then she raised my sister, my brother and myself</B>
<P><B>there.  I remember things that went on in the house from a very young</B>
<P><B>age. My great grandmother, "Grandmommy", would come into my room at</B>
<P><B>night.  I would see her out of the corner of my eye, dressed in a

white</B>
<P><B>nightgown.  But when I would look directly at her, she would not be</B>
<P><B>there.  I can recall exactly what she looked like, how she walked,

and</B>
<P><B>she was always smiling.  She would often make her presence known by</B>
<P><B>turning doorknobs, or rattling the beads that hung from my mother's</B>
<P><B>bedroom door.</B>
<P><B>My mother's father, Grandpa Stan, died in a plane crash a year and
a</B>
<P><B>month after I was born.  He would often visit me in my room, or while

I</B>
<P><B>was eating dinner, or maybe even just watching TV.  And his image was</B>
<P><B>always the same. I would catch a perfect view of him, but when I

looked</B>
<P><B>at him, he wasn't there.  He was wearing a brown suit and a tie. The</B>
<P><B>same outfit he was wearing in the formal portrait that hung in the</B>
<P><B>hall.  He owned a German Shepard when my mother was a  child.  I

can't</B>
<P><B>remember the dog's name, but he was a friend of mine.  I only saw him

in</B>
<P><B>my bedroom.  (Usually when I was cleaning it for some strange reason.

</B>
<P><B>That is how I remember the dog: visiting when I was cleaning.)  </B>
<P><B>I am now grown and married.  My mother came to visit last year, and

we</B>
<P><B>were talking about the strange occurances that we experienced while</B>
<P><B>living in the house, and she told me about the dog I used to see. </B>
<P><B>Apparently the dog became ill, and my grandfather put him to sleep
by</B>
<P><B>adding something to his dog food.  The dog ate the food and died in

my</B>
<P><B>bedroom.</B>
<P><B>Another strange happeningwas when my husband and I were getting ready

to</B>
<P><B>move out of our apartment last year, and he was cleaning out his</B>
<P><B>closet.  We asked my brother to come over and take some of the

clothes</B>
<P><B>that my husband no longer wanted or needed.  My husband was standing

at</B>
<P><B>the closet, digging through his things, and my brother was stretched

out</B>
<P><B>on the bed.  I was on the floor, and I got up to go into the living

room</B>
<P><B>for something, and as I was walking back toward the bedroom, my

husband,</B>
<P><B>(dressed in a white t-shirt and red baseball hat) walked in front of

me</B>
<P><B>and cut through to the kitchen.  I was looking down, so I stopped,

let</B>
<P><B>him pass and continued on.  When I reached the bedroom door, I saw
my</B>
<P><B>brother on the bed, and my husband, still at the closet door.  How</B>
<P><B>strange!  I felt the air of the passing man dressed in the white

t-shirt</B>
<P><B>and red ball cap, I smelled his cologne, I heard his footsteps.  But,

it</B>
<P><B>was no one.  In fact, my husband was wearing a blue t-shirt and no

ball</B>
<P><B>cap that day.</B>
<P><B>Two weeks later, my mother was visiting, staying with us at that</B>
<P><B>apartment.  She told me that she had woke up to use the bathroom in

the</B>
<P><B>middle of the night and as she passed our bedroom door, out of the</B>
<P><B>corner of her eye, she saw a man in my bedroom doorway, his face

covered</B>
<P><B>by shadows, but he had his arms crossed and was wearing a white shirt</B>
<P><B>and a red hat.  I had not mentioned the man that passed me in the hall

a</B>
<P><B>couple of weeks before to her, I had only told my husband.  No joking.

 </B>
<P><B>Strange things like that happen to me very often.  In fact, I am safe

to</B>
<P><B>say more often than not.  And to my mother as well.  She will see</B>
<P><B>kittens and dogs running about, and not say anything about them,

waiting</B>
<P><B>to see if in the next few days I might mention seeing the same</B>
<P><B>things...usually I do end up saying something about the "un-there"

pets.</B>
<P><B>And usually I tend to see people and animals more if I know that my

mom</B>
<P><B>is coming for a visit.</B>
<P><B>At my office, (I work in a warehouse, in the offices) there is someone

I</B>
<P><B>call "flannel man".  He dresses in a grey flannel shirt and will walk</B>
<P><B>through my office door and stand there, staring at me until I look

up,</B>
<P><B>and then, of course, he vanishes.  When I come in to the warehouse
at</B>
<P><B>night, I see many, many people around, playing, working, walking,

even</B>
<P><B>though I am the only "real" person there.  </B>
<P><B>One more quick example, an odd one, it spooked me more than any other.

</B>
<P><B>My husband and I were at his grandmother's house for her birthday.
 I</B>
<P><B>was seated in a chair next to my mother-in-law.  I was taking a bite

of</B>
<P><B>cake when all of a sudden, a very cold, light breeze hit my face. 
I</B>
<P><B>stopped and looked at my mother-in-law, to check to see if she had

felt</B>
<P><B>it.  She continued to eat, as if she noticed nothing.  I looked at

the</B>
<P><B>floor around me, trying to find a heat register, or a vent, or a fan,</B>
<P><B>but there was nothing except a bookcase and a wall near me.  The

breeze</B>
<P><B>lasted a good thirty seconds.  It was so weird!  Nothing like that

had</B>
<P><B>ever occured with me before!  But the strangest thing about that</B>
<P><B>situation was...while I was distracted by the air, after it had

stopped,</B>
<P><B>I tuned back into the conversation going on between my father-in-law

and</B>
<P><B>grandma, and they were discussing how she needed a small portable

heat</B>
<P><B>radiator for her living room, because the only vent she had in her

house</B>
<P><B>was in her bedroom, and she was tired of being cold!</B>
<P><B>I have many more eerie things I could share, but I just wanted to

share</B>
<P><B>a few of the ones that are most distinct to me.  I hope you've

enjoyed</B>
<P><B>them...they are all ENTIRELY true!</B>

</H3><P><B>by jkawaiha@bellsouth.net </B>
<P>
<P><B> Hello my </B>
<P><B>name is William and I am 16 years of age. Although I am young I </B>
<P><B>have had several paranormal encounters. &nbsp;My first encounter was
when I was </B>
<P><B>about 6 years of age. &nbsp;My parents and I had just got back from
the store </B>
<P><B>and I was walking to my room when I noticed a figure floating at the
end of the </B>
<P><B>hall. You could see right through him to the wall in back of him.</B>
<P><B>When you looked at his face you could that he was very sad and lonesome.

That is </B>
<P><B>all I noticed because I ran for my life. After that you felt a constant

</B>
<P><B>presence and you always felt someone watching you.</B>
<P><B> My next experience was when we moved to our house; which was a old
civil war </B>
<P><B>house. &nbsp;In the back of the house there was a shed that once contained

the </B>
<P><B>bones of someone that had hung himself. &nbsp;In the shed it was constantly

cold </B>
<P><B>even in the summer. &nbsp;Also we used to put our bikes in their at
night and </B>
<P><B>the next mourning the bikes would be placed outside of the shed leaning

against </B>
<P><B>the door of the shed.&amp;nbsp; In the house you would hear footsteps
even when you </B>
<P><B>were all alone. You would hear creepy noises and sometimes a soft </B>
<P><B>murmur. &nbsp;There places in the house that would be colder then any
other </B>
<P><B>place in the house. &nbsp;Also you felt like you were constantly watched
at all </B>
<P><B>times. &nbsp;However, I have to say this there was no time at all where
a ghost </B>
<P><B>had ever hurt us in anyway, but you always felt their presence.</B>

</H3><P><B>by pwilson@rave.ac.uk</B>
<P>
<P><B>dear whoever......this was my second experience of the </B>
<P><B>paranormal.....i think that it started when my boyfriend changed </B>
<P><B>around the furniture in his room......His house is new and they are
</B>
<P><B>the first people to live there so this crosses out any ideas that the

</B>
<P><B>spirit was a previous inhabitant.....anyway....my boyfriend....has
</B>
<P><B>several model cars in his room.......one i particiular i pointed out
</B>
<P><B>to him because i had noticed that at times the door would be open or
</B>
<P><B>shut....when noone had touched it....we could be the only ones in the

</B>
<P><B>house and go upstairs and the door would have opened.Noone seemed too

</B>
<P><B>bothered about this....then i noticed how his dog...george...started
</B>
<P><B>to bark constantly at what seemed to be nothing.....he'd bark at </B>
<P><B>something on the stairs and something in sam's room. because i now
</B>
<P><B>quite a lot about the paranormal....i knew that animals are extremely

</B>
<P><B>sensitive...george would sometimes run about frantically </B>
<P><B>barking...going mad!......Eventually sam said to me that he had seen
</B>
<P><B>and heard something in his room the previous night......he saw a black

</B>
<P><B>shadow move across his room and very heavy breathing which he said
</B>
<P><B>sounded like an old lady.....standing over him while he slept...by
</B>
<P><B>this time the car door on the model was moving much more frequently
</B>
<P><B>and he came into his room one time to find many of his ornaments </B>
<P><B>balancing on his radiator and leaning on the wall.He told his mum and

</B>
<P><B>his sister about what he had seen.....and they both agreed that they
</B>
<P><B>too had noticed strange things going on.his mum had watched a shadowed

</B>
<P><B>figure moving about outside in the back garden...bending over as </B>
<P><B>though they were tending to the flowers.his sister said that she had
</B>
<P><B>had two things happen to her......once she was in the bath when she
</B>
<P><B>felt something tap her on the shoulder....when she turned around </B>
<P><B>nothing was there.another time she said that she had been woken up
</B>
<P><B>inher sleep by someone coming into her room walking about and </B>
<P><B>breathing heavily...she asked my boyfriend if he had gone in her room

</B>
<P><B>but of course he hadn't and is not known to sleep walk!things were
</B>
<P><B>like this for a while and then everything seemed to stop....apart from

</B>
<P><B>the car door opening and shutting.Then one time i was over and sam
and </B>
<P><B>I were discussing the occurances ......his sister took me home </B>
<P><B>bringing sam with us leaving their mum at home.......however when they

</B>
<P><B>got back.....she was in a really bad state..something had been playing

</B>
<P><B>my boyfreinds drums...she'd heard a massive crash and the dog had ran

</B>
<P><B>downstairs tail between legs......when they went up to look everything

</B>
<P><B>in sam's room had been pulled off the shelves out of the cupboards
the </B>
<P><B>tv stereo and computer had all been disconnected......the leads all
</B>
<P><B>over the place.....the bedclothes on the floor......and my school </B>
<P><B>picture was lying on the floor.....picture out of frame...and its </B>
<P><B>really difficult to get them things out of their frames.soon after
</B>
<P><B>sam's mum got someone from the spiritual church in to bless the house

</B>
<P><B>and to calm it......she said to her that the spririt was sam's </B>
<P><B>nan.....his mum's mum.....who had been restless because he was having

</B>

<H3><A NAME=boy>The Little Boy and The Old Man</A>
</H3><P><B>by ldweller@bellsouth.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hello. My name is Beth. I am writing to tell you my story.</B>
<P><B>   When I was in the 5th grade my sister saw 2 ghosts. Of course none

of</B>
<P><B>the family believed her because my family is kinda the 'seeing is</B>
<P><B>believing'type. Well the years went by and she still swears up and

down</B>
<P><B>that she saw a ghost. All these years since she 'saw' the ghost I had</B>
<P><B>been having reoccurring dreams about a little boy and an old man in

our</B>
<P><B>house.I never thought that much about them because I had weird dreams</B>
<P><B>all the time. Well just a few months ago my dreams started to get

more</B>
<P><B>frequent. My sister and I were sitting around talking about weird

dreams</B>
<P><B>that we had had. I told her about this dream about the man and the

boy</B>
<P><B>in our old house(we moved a year after she 'saw' the ghost). She

asked</B>
<P><B>me to describe them to her and where they were standing. I told her

the</B>
<P><B>little boy looked like he was about 9 years old and was wearing

overalls</B>
<P><B>and a red shirt and a ballcap. He had bright red hair and was holding

a</B>
<P><B>fishing pole. He was standing in front of the bathroom. The old man

had</B>
<P><B>white hair and he was wearing old dirty blue jeans. I couldn't really</B>
<P><B>see his face that well. All I could tell about it was that he had

lots</B>
<P><B>of wrinkles. He was sitting on our couch. His neck looked all

mutalated</B>
<P><B>like it had cut. Well after I told her about this dream she just

kinda</B>
<P><B>sat there and looked at me weird. She said"Why didn't you tell anyone</B>
<P><B>that you saw them too?". I was like 'Huh?". I didn't know what she

was</B>
<P><B>talking about. She told me that I had just described to her the

ghosts</B>
<P><B>that she had seen 5 years earlier. I was dumbfounded. Needless to say

I</B>
<P><B>believe now. Well I have more stories but they will have to wait

until</B>
<P><B>later.</B>

<H3><A NAME=place>Haunted Place</A>
</H3><P><B>by Mtfellers@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I would like to add to the Carnton house in Franklin.  A frind of mine's
grandmother was the caretaker years ago.  My friend saw a black slave woman
in the kitchen/dining area dressed in period clothes.  Right before her very
eyes the lady disappeared.  Later they found photos of this woman.  She was
a slave who stayed on with the McGavock family after slavery was abolished.</B>
<P><B>Also in the same area (Franklin) is the Carter House.  The same friend
whose grandmother took care of the Carnton house, took care of the Carter
House for a period of time.  This house is near downtown and was the site
of one of the bloodiest battles in the Civil War.  In fact, the house today
shows more bullet holes than any other in in the state.  </B>
<P><B>The grandmother used to conduct tours for the public.  One evening,
she was about to close up when a young man came in and wanted a tour.  She
proceeded to show him around and tell him what each room was used for, etc.
 The young man (dressed strangely) kept correcting her during the tour. 
She became frustrated with him, but said nothing.  As they were about to
go down into an area below house level he said that he couldn't go down there.
 When she turned around to question him, he was not there.  Again, the
grandmother saw pictures later and recognized the young boy as being Todd,
the son of the owners of the house during the battle.  He had been sent out
to war but oddly had literally ended up at his own home fighting in the battle.
 He was mortally wounded and died in the same house that he had been born
in.</B>

<H3> <A NAME=farm>The Old Farm House</A>
</H3><P><B>by rseaman@bellsouth.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>I come from an old town in Northern New Jersey. Because of the town's</B>
<P><B>age and the many old houses there, ghost stories were abundant. There</B>
<P><B>was one old abandoned house in particular that was reported to house
the</B>
<P><B>spirit of none other than George Washington himself. When walking
past</B>
<P><B>this old place, I would always keep a wary eye out for the old
General</B>
<P><B>but I never did come across him. Of course I never did have the nerve
to</B>
<P><B>venture inside the place so that I might meet him "face to face". In</B>
<P><B>1977, I was at my friend Vince's home. He started showing me some
things</B>
<P><B>he had found at an old farm house located on the edge of town. The
house</B>
<P><B>had been abandoned for years, as long as I could remember. I was a</B>
<P><B>modest sized place, with a lot of overgrown shrubbery that hid most
of</B>
<P><B>the front of the house.Vince, along with a friend of his, Bobby, had</B>
<P><B>ventured into the place one night just to check it out. In there,
they</B>
<P><B>found a lot of interesting things, old seltzer bottles dated from the</B>
<P><B>1920's, old documents from about the same time and things such as
that.</B>
<P><B>The pair had gone up to the second floor to search for more
artifacts.</B>
<P><B>They stopped at the second floor bathroom and looked inside. Hanging</B>
<P><B>from the ceiling, was a single light bulb with a pull chain type
switch.</B>
<P><B>Bob asked Vince, " What would you do if I pulled the chain and the
light</B>
<P><B>went on"? Vince replied, " I would beat your ass down the stairs and
out</B>
<P><B>the door". Bob laughed and pulled the chain. Well, as they both swore</B>
<P><B>later, the light came on. True to his word, Vince beat Bob out of
there.</B>
<P><B>As he's telling me this, i'm becoming more intrigued. I ask him to
go</B>
<P><B>there with me that night and of course, he flatly told me to get
lost.</B>
<P><B>He would never under any circumstance go back there. I let the matter</B>
<P><B>drop but was always intrigued about the place. Finally one night in</B>
<P><B>1979, I got to go in there. I was driving around with a friend of
mine</B>
<P><B>and two girls. We were talking about the old house and I said I was</B>
<P><B>going to go in there. My friend was eager to go with me, the girls</B>
<P><B>however, were not as enthusiastic. I pulled my car into the driveway</B>
<P><B>that led behind the house. I parked all the way in back so the police</B>
<P><B>couldn't see the car. It was one of those dank drizzly nights, not
a</B>
<P><B>great night to be investigating a haunted house. The girls were
really</B>
<P><B>apprehensive now and started to complain about this as my friend and
I</B>
<P><B>were trying to pry open the plywood that covered the back door. A
putrid</B>
<P><B>scent started to fill  the area. We stopped and sniffed, it smelled
like</B>
<P><B>a decomposing body. When the girls smelled that they said they really</B>
<P><B>wanted to leave NOW! My friend and I were a bit unnerved by this as
well</B>
<P><B>so we left. I dropped the girls and my friend off at their homes and</B>
<P><B>went back up town and hang out for a while. My friend Vince pulled
up</B>
<P><B>and I told him about going over to the house. He laughed and told me
I</B>
<P><B>was crazy. I said "come on, go back there with me". Again he laughed
and</B>
<P><B>said no way. I bugged him some more and he finally agreed to go, but</B>
<P><B>with a warning that he would leave me right where I stood if so much
as</B>
<P><B>a breeze blew through the place. I agreed, and after we stopped at
his</B>
<P><B>place to get a couple of flashlights, off we went. We got in through
a</B>
<P><B>boarded window in the front of the house this time. We walked all
over</B>
<P><B>the house and I picked up an old notebook, some old letters and some</B>
<P><B>newspapers. Nothing untoward happened, and after a while I left</B>
<P><B>satisfied.</B>
<P><B>We got back to the uptown hangout and Vince left to go home. I stayed</B>
<P><B>there and started looking over my souvenirs. As I looked over the
stuff</B>
<P><B>I was fascinated by some of this stuff. There were letters from the</B>
<P><B>second world war era. It seems that the family that lived there at
the</B>
<P><B>time had a son who had gone off to war and he was taken prisoner by
the</B>
<P><B>Germans. There was a lot of correspondence about that. I never did
find</B>
<P><B>anything that said what became of this man. As I was sitting in my
car,</B>
<P><B>looking this stuff over, another friend, Tom, pulled up and I showed
him</B>
<P><B>my stuff. He was interested in the old stamps on some of the
envelopes</B>
<P><B>for these old letters. He asked me to go back there with him to look
for</B>
<P><B>more letters. I said ok, there was nothing there to be afraid of so
I</B>
<P><B>didn't hesitate. We went to his house this time and got his father's</B>
<P><B>flashlight which was a huge police style type light. Tom drove this
time</B>
<P><B>and parked across the street from the house at a gas station. We went
in</B>
<P><B>and looked around but after a while it was apparent that there was</B>
<P><B>really nothing left. We were standing inside the kitchen when I said
to</B>
<P><B>Tom, "why don't we get out of here". As I said that, the flashlight
went</B>
<P><B>out. Not thinking anything about it I turned it on and off, nothing.
I</B>
<P><B>pulled out my cigarette lighter to try to light the way out because
it</B>
<P><B>was pitch black as well as a labyrinth in there. As I tried to light
it,</B>
<P><B>a small breeze came along and blew it out. I tried to cover the
lighter</B>
<P><B>with my hand, but no matter what I did the breeze would come back and</B>
<P><B>blow the flame out. I was now becoming a little unnerved by this and</B>
<P><B>said to Tom " lets just get the hell outta here" and we just started
to</B>
<P><B>grope our way out. After what seemed an eternity, we found our way
out</B>
<P><B>to the front window where we had come in. We crossed over to Tom's
car,</B>
<P><B>and as I put my hand on the door handle, the flashlight came back</B>
<P><B>on..... Needless to say, I never went back in there and since then,
the</B>
<P><B>house has been torn down leaving nothing but two old stone columns
that</B>
<P><B>used to be the entrance for the front walk leading to the house. I
do</B>
<P><B>often wonder what  happened to the young man who was a POW in
WWII....</B>

<H3><A NAME=swagman>The Swagman</A>
</H3><P><B>by cdog@cairns.net.au </B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was about twelve I went to stay on my friends Sheep Station
(or ranch as you Americans say), he had a really strange house that had started
off as a one room cottage and then been added to over 75 years or so. There
was also a thing we Australians call a sleepout which is a room attached
to the main house by a veranda (or porch). Australian bush houses have a
wide roofed veranda running the whole way around to keep the sun off the
walls of the house, and keep it cool.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The sleepout was a two room affair with an outside door that was firmly
nailed shut. I didn't ask about this because the rest of the place was so
strange that a nailed shut door didn't promote interest. That night I awoke
to find the same door wide open and a Swagman standing there in the doorway.
I went back to sleep thinking I had dreamed it all. In the morning the door
was nailed shut again and I to told my friend about it. He just laughed and
said "Hey Mum, Peter saw it last night" and everyone chuckled. I said "Saw
what?" and he said "the Swaggy". I didn't sleep in that room again.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The ghost was like a real person standing there, I couldn't see his
face but the rest of his clothes were quite clear.</B>
<P>
<P><B>btw a Swaggy was a common sight in Australia during the depression
when men left the cities to find work in the country, they dressed a bit
like a cowboy. All their gear was in a rolled up swag which was their rolled
up blanket  and groundsheet.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The other ghost I have seen was while I was attending boarding school,
we slept in a big dorm with all 60 of us in the same huge room. One night
after lights out, I could not get to sleep because someone had left the lights
on in a downstairs corridor. The wall opposite and the roof were white so
the reflected light would bother me. I decided to go downstairs and turn
the lights out. I walked down and flicked the light switch and a shape came
gliding down the corridor straight past me and through the wall. I convinced
myself it was a light reflecting off the big glass doors in front of me,
and went back to bed. Next morning I told someone I thought I had seen a
ghost, but did not describe it. This led to about a week of merciless teasing
from my class mates. After the teasing had died down, a boy came up to me
when I was alone and said "did you see a ghost?" I tried to turn away because
I was sick of the teasing by then. Then he told me he had seen one too, and
he described it to me, it was the same as the thing I had seen. After that
we were both so scared we didn't even look out the windows after dark. Remember
I had not told anyone about what I had seen, and I still cannot really explain
it, but I'll try.</B>
<P>
<P><B>It was a shape, about human in size but with no real form. It was sort
of like a cloud of gas, a bit like those photos of gas clouds in space. It
just floated by me, my new friend told me he had seen three of them floating
across the fields and disappearing into the dam that used to be the old swimming
hole. We surmised they may have been past students that had drowned in the
dam. We were too afraid to ask the Brothers about it because they would have
thrashed us and told us to go do 10,000 hail marys and our fathers or
something.</B>

<H3><A NAME=sisters>The Night Of My Sister's Funeral</A>
</H3><P><B>by gotr@alltel.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>My sister was killed in a car accident  in November 1996 in Montana.
My</B>
<P><B>family and I live in Pennsylvania and only two of my sisters could
go to</B>
<P><B>Montana to help with the funeral arrangements.</B>
<P><B>     My sister was deeply involved with Native American religions and
had</B>
<P><B>become a Shaman. So, during the funeral they had a sweat lodge ritual
and</B>
<P><B>other rituals which I did not understand. The night of the sweat
lodge</B>
<P><B>ritual I was at home with my small son, and my cats. The night was
clear and</B>
<P><B>cold, but still. Shortly after 9:00 p.m. I heard a knocking that
started</B>
<P><B>over the kitchen roof. The knocking traveled all around the entire
lenghth</B>
<P><B>of my home. Then the knocking stopped. I had a strange feeling my sister
had</B>
<P><B>just passed by on her way to the other side.</B>
<P><B>       Several weeks later I mentioned my expierence to my mother.
She said</B>
<P><B>that the night of the sweat lodge ritual she and my  father had been
sitting</B>
<P><B>in the living room watching television. There is a stairway in the
living</B>
<P><B>room which goes to the upstairs bedroom. My mother has hung photos
of my</B>
<P><B>great grandparents and other family members the entire lenght of this</B>
<P><B>stairway. She said they heard a terrible noise, like a crashing sound,
then</B>
<P><B>they looked at the stairs and down the steps came the photo of my
great</B>
<P><B>grandparents, end over end. When it reached the bottom of the stairs
it</B>
<P><B>stood straight up and stayed that way until my father grabbed it. The
frame</B>
<P><B>was still on the wall, and the glass still secure in the frame. How
the</B>
<P><B>photo fell out and did its amazing antics we will never know, unless
it was</B>
<P><B>my sister stopping by there too.</B>

</H3><P><B>by Freespirte@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I'm only 16 , but I am for sure I have had some experiences that go
well beyond me and my age . I have always been interested in strange activities
. But I never believed them true not even the first time it happened to me
. </B>
<P><B>I was nine , I was awakened from my sleep , with a very disturbing
feeling , for some reason I went to head for the door , and thats when I
saw him . A very small boy , with a bright blue baseball cap on his head
. He was not quite transparent , but a silvery , liquid color . He stared
a me , crawled across the floor and and disappeared.</B>
<P><B>My mother said it was just my imagination . So I tried to forget it
. But the same feeling I felt that night would suddenly come back to me at
different times . It might happen in a room full of people or out in the
park , there was one slight difference to this feeling each time it becamcolder
more darker like it was trying to show me or tell me something .  I had been
living with this presence for about 2 1/2 years with only minor happenings
. One day I was at school , we had been called down to the see a guest speaker
they had gotten . The 2nd floor was completely empty , When I got to the
floor I felt the presence again , It was the first time I was ever scared
by it , It was like it was all around me , I started to run , I felt a hand
around my ankle and fell . I screamed , a teacher ran up the steps and saw
me on the floor  , my ankle had been cut they said by the edge of a hallway
door .I told my mom about these things and she began to tell me about ghosts
she had encountered , very evil , She had been 10 </B>
<P><B>she had just moved into a new home and was asleep in her bed when she
awoke to as she put it a shadow standing over her with a knife she ran into
her parents room crying , the next morning they found the knife stuck in
the wall .</B>
<P><B>Recently I have had two more experiences that I have found very disturbing
. One I was coming home from a party when I saw a man standing in front of
my building door , he started walking toward the back exit we passed a tree
at the same time . when I looked to see the man he was done the only thing
left was a large pile of garden snakes . About 15 min later I was inside
my house washing my face I looked into the mirror and for a spit second it
was not me but a very , very angry man at that instint the light bulb blew
in the bathroom .</B>

<H3><A NAME=another>Another Friendly Ghost Story</A>
</H3><P><B>by CathyM1121@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi, I've been reading the stories for quite sometime now and I have
finally decided to submit one.  In 1989, my mother left my father and we
move to NJ.  At the time we were very short on money so we moved into the
back of my mother's office.  The building had been designed so that the office
was in front, the bathroom, the living room and a bedroom (with another exit
into a small alley) in the back, and two rooms underneath.  </B>
<P><B>One night I went upstairs to the bathroom.  I didn't turn on the light
but as soon as I went in the light turned on.  The next day I told my mom
and she said that it had also happened to her.  Time went on and we got used
to it.</B>
<P><B>One time we went away for the week and my mom got her friend to cover
for her.  We got a call from my mom's friend, screaming frantically.  She
said that the night before, she had closed down the office, turned off the
radio and the lights.  The next day she found all the lights, the radios,
and the TV's in the house on and full blast, yet there were no signs of a
break in and nothing was out of place.  There had been some break ins in
the neighborhood lately and my mother said that the ghost was probably just
trying to protect us. This happened on another occasion too.  I think I belive
my mom's theory.</B>

<H3><A NAME=haunted>Haunted House</A>
</H3><P><B>by Aria121@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>   I've always had an interest in the supernatural so it was not strange
for me to read stories of this nature. This is the first time I'm writing
about this.</B>
<P><B>  This story involves my summer at my aunt's house in Pomona, California
which is just outside or around LA. To fully understand why I believe these
things; I'll tell you about my family. Most of my family, on my mom's side
are very attuned to the supernatural and even have dreams that come true.
</B>
<P><B>  When I was sixteen, I went to visit my aunt and her family in California.
I went with my uncle, my aunt May, her husband Jon, and her daughter Sharon.
The house is a one story house, unassuming from the outside. Once you enter
it, you still feel nothing. </B>
<P><B>  The odd things happened at night. There is this bedroom that shares
a wall with the living room. So the living room is on one side and the bedroom
on the other. These two places were the center of activity, especially with
my uncle. The master bedroom has this eerie bathroom where none of us felt
comfortable in but we had no other place to go because it was the only one
with a shower and well, after spending a day on your feet, you just want
a quick shower and hop into bed. </B>
<P><B>  Several things occurred. The first thing happened to my uncle. He
seemed to be the main focus of the spirits. The first night we spent there,
my aunt May and I shared the bedroom next to the living room. My cousin Sharon
shared a room with "Ken" and Jim. They were around the same age, which is
several years younger than me. So my uncles shared the sofa bed in the living
room. </B>
<P><B>   During the night, my uncle "Steve" got pinched and kicked several
times. He thought it was Uncle Jonathan. The next morning he got up and was
going to ask Jonathan why he was a fitful sleeper when he realized Uncle
Jonathan had not been there the entire night...he had not come home from
his friend's house until 10 am.</B>
<P><B>   The next incident occurred when Uncle Jonathan, Aunt May, Sharon
and I went back up to their home in San Francisco.</B>
<P><B>   Uncle Steve stayed in LA to visit people and he moved into the spare
bedroom. This was the same bedroom that I'd slept in. He said that the activity
got stronger there; that he would be sleeping and he'd wake up because someone
was calling his name. Only my uncle and aunt did not call him. Other times
he'd get kicked; he knew it was a female because the voice was feminine.
When he came up to San Francisco; he was glad to get away from that house
because he couldn't sleep. But he actually saw the ghost when he was on the
plane. He said he saw her sitting on the wing, looking at him through the
window.</B>
<P><B>   The other incidents occurred when we went back down to LA, minus
Uncle Steve who went back to New York. This time Aunt May, Aunt "Sara", Sharon
and Ken shared the sofa bed in the living room. My mom and brother came to
LA also. I shared the spare bed room with my mom and she didn't sleep very
well in the room. Said the whole place was spooky. My brother felt nothing.
</B>
<P><B>  However, the four people sharing the sofa bed had a hard time sleeping.
My Aunt May was woken by the spirit. She got scared and tried to wake Sara
but Sara was in a deep sleep. She kept calling Sara but she wouldn't wake
up. The ghost then spoke to her. She said,"She can't protect her own family",
how can she protect you?"</B>
<P><B>  That totally freaked out my aunt, and she was most happy to leave
LA. </B>
<P><B>  It also disturbed Sharon and Ken, keeping them awake, kicking them
and pinching them.</B>
<P><B>  This occurred throughout the entire length of the trip and apparently
after we left, it moved to the bedroom of Ken and Jim; causing them to lose
sleep.</B>
<P><B>  All I know is that these people would not lie about this; even I
felt some discomfort in the house. Also my aunt had a friend who could see
them; she said there were many spirits in that house. I've always wondered
at the reason for these occurrences since the house seems to be fairly young...
</B>
<P><B>  One other thing; about three years after the ghost said that my aunt
Sara couldn't protect her own family; her husband died under strange
circumstances. The kids and Sara were with him when he passed and I think
he knew he was going because Sara had been working in New Jersey at the time
when he called her and asked her to quickly return home.</B>
<P><B>  I have more stories but I think I'll stop here. Tell me what you
think or share some of your stories by emailing me at aria121@aol.com</B>

<P><B>I'm 22 years old and have always had an interest in the supernatural
and</B>
<P><B>paranormal.  I've just recently found your web page and I love it.
 Very</B>
<P><B>informative and exciting.  My hats off to you.  Now I'm not a very
good</B>
<P><B>writer but I'll give it my best.</B>
<P><B>    I was about eleven years old when I had my first experience.  I
was</B>
<P><B>at my grandparents house sleeping over.  Now I really don't know how
old</B>
<P><B>the house is but they lived there my entire life.  And then some.
 Well</B>
<P><B>this particular night I had gotten up to go to the bathroom.  And when
I</B>
<P><B>came out I started walking back to the living room, and I had a
feeling</B>
<P><B>that someone was standing behind me.  And when I turned around I saw
a</B>
<P><B>dark shadowy figure standing in front of my grandparents bedroom. 
The</B>
<P><B>figure was very masculine looking, tall, broad shouldered, and the
only</B>
<P><B>distinct part I saw was an arrowhead pendant around its' neck.  After</B>
<P><B>that I turned away from it and when I turned back it walked through
my</B>
<P><B>grandparents door.  That was the first and last time I ever saw
anything</B>
<P><B>in my grandparents house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Now, I'm twenty two years old, eleven years later.  My parents moved</B>
<P><B>into a new house.  They went on a cruise and left me to house sit.
 Now</B>
<P><B>I normally don't mind being in a house alone, but this is an older</B>
<P><B>house.  One night I was sleeping in my parents bedroom, and for some</B>
<P><B>reason woke up in the middle of the night.  And I looked up towards
the</B>
<P><B>bedroom door.  And saw the same figure that I saw eleven years ago
at my</B>
<P><B>grandparents house.  The figure just stayed by the door until I tried
to</B>
<P><B>scream.  As I tried to sit up I felt powerless.  I couldn't move.
 Then</B>
<P><B>the figure moved towards me and proceeded towards a mirror next to
my</B>
<P><B>parents bed.  Then vanished.  But as it moved towards me I heard</B>
<P><B>something say, "There is only one."  I've tried to bring this up to
my</B>
<P><B>mother but she just dismisses it as an overactive imagination.</B>
<P><B>please respond to: MBACON@EXECPC.COM</B>
<P><B>I've had some very odd things happen in my life and no one to talk
to.</B>
<P><B>It would be greatly appreciated.</B>
<P><B>    Thank you for listening.</B>

<H3><A NAME=cat>Our Strange Cat</A>
</H3><P><B>by 	Dvlish01@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>   It happened back when I was 17 and my sister Penny was 15.  Our
family had just moved into a new house in Missoula, Montana.  The family
and few friends who had helped us move were in the downstairs den having
pizza as a reward for their help.  A stray cat somehow got into the garage
and started meowing at the door to the house.  We own a cat so thinking it
was ours, I opened the door and it ran in.  After a chase around the house
we finally caught and put the cat back outside.</B>
<P><B>     A few nights later, my sister Penny and I were sleeping in our
room and our cat jumped up onto my bed.  It walked over my legs and curled
up behind my knees to sleep.  At the same time, my sister said something
about the cat being on her bed.  I reached up and turned on the light, only
to find that nothing was sitting on my bed, and my sister had the cat.  This
went on for a few more nights, my sister or I would feel the cat jump onto
our bed, but when we reached down to pet it, nothing was there.</B>
<P><B>     We thought we must be imagining things, so we never told anyone
about what was happening.  After about a few months, we moved into another
house in Missoula.  I never felt the "cat" again, but one morning my mom's
friend (who was staying in our house) said that the weirdest thing had
happened....she then went on to tell how she felt the cat jump onto her bed,
but she went to pet it and nothing was there.  My sister and I wanted to
see if the "cat" was back, so we slept in the room my mom's friend had a
few nights later.  Sure enough the cat had followed us.  I never slept in
that room again.</B>
<P><B>     About a year later we moved to Butte, Montana.  My sister and
I again were sharing my room.  The first night we slept in our house, I felt
the cat on my bed.  By this time I was used to the midnight visitor, so I
whispered goodnight kitty to it, and went to sleep.  That was the last night
we were visited by the cat, but whenever a cat jumps onto my bed, I feel
to make sure it's really there.</B>

<H3><A NAME=theater>Haunted Theater</A>
</H3><P><B>by Venkman720@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is not an account of what happened alone, but what has occured
and what I have withnessed. Back in 95' I had a summer job working at a theater.
The theater has 12 screens. All the rooms are huge except for room 10 and
11. They are fairly small. Theater 10 was long and narrow and had its own
projection room. In the back of the screen was a long hallway leading to
the fire escape. That hallway always gave me the creeps. It's lighting was
dull which made it eerie. It was always dead quiet because it was in the
back of the theater, so not many people where back there ( It was reserved
for the crappy one week movies). I always strayed away from cleaning that
room because it was eerie. One day I was talking to my supervisor about the
room and he explained that it was haunted. I just thought he was trying to
scare me. However, when I had to go back there I always noticed the floor
was wet, soaked to be exact, and the room was cold. The water was always
there from my experience. It never dryed up. I asked management why they
didn't fix it. It turns out they did have the pipes repaired several times.
Infact the pipes were even replaced. But the floored remained wet. I was
back there one day making sure nobody was trying to sneak in. Suddenly there
was a knock at the door. I went to the fire escape and openned it to see
who it was. I peeked out and saw that there was nobody there. It was completly
dead outside. I closed the door and headed out of the hall when the door
knocked again. Nobody once again. I turned from the door and began to walk
away when it happened again, I got mad and openned the door and yelled for
people to stop playing around. But there was nobody there. I was close to
the door this time so I would have been able to see someone running, and
there was no place to hide. Frightened I hauled butt out of the theather.
later in the summer, the projection man was loading up the latest film when
he heard singing in the hallway. He went to check it out but so nobody back
there yet the singing continued. he ran to the manager and told his storie.
Now this is a quiet man who doesn't talk unless talked too. Turns out he
wasn't the first to hear singing or talking. It happened alot. That is theater
10. Theater 11 has a smell coming from it that never goes away, and the room
is always hot no matter if the air-conditioner was pumped up high. I left
the job at the end of the summer. I haven't talked to anybody from the job
since then so I don't know what is happening.</B>

<P>
<P><B>Throughout my life I have experineced strange and unexplained occurences.
 I have always been very interested in ghosts and love telling ghost stories
almost as much as I love reading them.  I am 18 right now and currently living
in Alaska (army sucks).  I suppose it all started when I was five and we
were living in Texas.  I am the oldest of five and at the time had a brother
and a sister ( I now have a brother and three sisters).  My brother ,Kris,
is a year younger than me and my sister,April, is two and a half years younger
than me.  As I've already said we were living in Texas.  During this time
(about two years), strange things happened but there are two incidences that
I will always remember.</B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>    One night I was lying in bed trying to fall asleep.  I should mention
that my head was near the wall where Kris's closet was.  As I was drifting
and thinking I began to hear a noise.  Still wide awake, I listened intently
before realizing that I was listening to someone walking up stairs.  The
stange thing was, the stairs I heard creaked and ours didn't.  As I listened
a bit longer I realized that the sound was coming from my brothers closet!
 I lay there with a growing amount of horror and fear for my brother as the
footsteps grew closer.  Finally they stoped, but I could hear someone moving
around in the closet, which I knew was filled with boxes.  I then heard the
closet door open with the teeth grinding creak it was known for.  I listened
to someone walk through my brother's room (our doors where open) it was obviously
someone with hard shoes on, I could tell because we had wooden floors.  The
light in the stairwell was on, and on my wall I could see the shadow of a
man in a cowboy hat walk from my brother's room, and down the stairs, then
listened as the front door opened and closed.  After about five minutes and
catiously crept from my room into Kris's to see if he was alright.  My brother
was sleep obliviously away but I saw something that froze me in place.....the
closet door was open.  This frightened me because I knew that my brother
was deathly afriad of his closet and would never have gone to sleep with
it open.  I knew that what I had heard was real.  Fortunatly, I never heard
it again.</B>
<P><B>    Another incident that occured in this house was only witnessed
by my brother.  I believe he was five at the time, but to this day he recalls,
and swears that this really happened.</B>
<P><B>He used to own a orangatan(sp?) stuffed animal.  He loved that animal,
and (he's probly going to kill me if he reads this) slept with it.  One night
he claims to have waken up, and for no apparent reason, was terrified.  He
lied in bed for a long time, afriad to move.  He says that he felt something
tugging on his blanket, trying to pull it off the bed.  With a death grib
on the covers he huddled in bed when suddenly he saw the arm of the monkey
lift itself from the floor beside the bed (apparently the monkey had fallen
off the bed earlier that night) The arm hung in the air for a few second
and then droped to the floor.  I don't think he slept for the rest of the
night.</B>
<P><B>    These are just two of the many strange things that happened to
us in Texas.  Many, many more terrifiying things happend in Colorado during
the seven years that we lived there.  If you're interested in swaping stories
feel free to send me some email. </B>

<H3><A NAME=a>A Few Terrifying Experiences</A>
</H3><P><B>by Sanzman@IX.NETCOM.COM </B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi.  I've never lived in a haunted house or spooked area (at least
that i know of).  The houses that i have lived in, have been new and were
no previous deaths (again, that i know of).  Yet, I have experienced some
strange things here and there that have been scattered out from several years
and i can't explain them.  They are little things, but still very scary.
 The more terrifying ones happened to my Mother.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One of them, was back in 1989-90, and my Father was out of town on
business.  Whenever my Father travels, my Mother doesn't sleep well, so she
stays up late and reads.  Well one night while he was gone, my sister and
I had since long gone to bed, when she was up late again reading.  We had
recently moved into this house and hadn't broken it in yet.  She claims that
when she was reading, she heard some very heavy, raspy breathing come from
outside the window.  It was very loud and she was very frightened.  It continued
throughout the entire night, heavy, suffering breathing.  If I remember
correctly, she looked out the window but saw nothing as she heard the breathing.
 Still terrified, she checked the next morning, but there were no tracks
or any futher evidence stating that something had been there. But she knew
there was.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Another one, which I must say would have given me a heart attack, was
when she and my Father were sleeping one night, and she felt a heavy weight
press down on the bed.  She said that she distinctly felt a person sitting
on her side of the bed, by her feet.  She called to my Dad, who was sound
asleep.  I don't remember how long this lasted, but she told me that she
was frightened out of her mind.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The last one I'm going to tell you, my Mother and I both experienced,
but at different times.  I was the first.  It was late one night, and as
I went to bed, I turned off the light on my nightstand.  Not more than five
seconds after shutting it off, I heard very heavy and rapid breathing coming
from inches above my face.  Scared, I reached out but felt nothing.  Quickly
switching on the lamp, the breathing ceased never returning (knock on wood).
 However, a few nights later, my Mother told me of the same thing happening
to her, but she assumed it was the dog, but when she turned the light on,
the dog was sound asleep on the other side of the room.  This was a different
house from the other breathing and we haven't experienced it since, but it
was really terrifying.  Thank you for taking the time to read this. :)</B>

<H3><A NAME=spanish>The Spanish Man</A>
</H3><P><B>by MLaden1027@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My name is Martha.  When I was about 5 I had an encounter that shook
me up.  I  woke up out of a sound sleep because of a sound in the living
room.  I wandered down the hallway and stood at the opening to the living
room-it had a iron fence with an opening.  As I stood there trying to figure
out what I heard I saw the following:</B>
<P>
<P><B>     A cloudy object started to form in front of me about 4 feet. 
I remember, at that time I felt a strange chill-I wasn't cold but I wasn't
warm either-but I can't really describe it.  It slowly began to take on human
features.  It was a man of Spanish decent, with a mustache and a small beard,
with a metal hat, metal chest plate, and "funny looking shorts" (that's how
I described them at the time).  He was also wearing boots-or what looked
like boots-I was not quite sure.  I stared at him and he had a real mean
look in his eyes-as I watched-(I did not move)-he drew his sword from his
left hip with his right hand and came toward me-I remember screaming very
loudly.  The man stopped and I ran down the hallway  and into my room, screaming.
 I remember squeezing myself between my bed and the dresser and shrinking
down into a tight ball.  That's where my father found me.  I explained what
I saw and he looked through out the house-he said there was no one there.
 Both of my parents thought I was dreaming.  I know I wasn't dreaming. (I
later saw a picture of something similar to the man I saw-later being about
4 or 5 years-when I was studying early California history-it was a conquestador)
I also used to see, what I called "shadows"-really odd-they had features
and shapes but they were grey or black they were men and women and children.
 But sense we don't live in that house anymore, I don't see them that much
any more.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I know that sounds crazy-and everyone I have ever told this to-says
"yeah right" but I know what I saw and every now and again still see.  I
hope I haven't wasted your time.</B>

<H3><A NAME=past>Couple From the Past</A>
</H3><P><B>by Dahlia187@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I'm not sure this wasnt a lucid childhood dream or a real experience.
You see I'm the only one in my family who remembers the thing. </B>
<P><B>My grandparents live out in a rural part of Mississippi. When I was
young my parents liked to get rid of me and my brother by sending them to
our grandparents. So there was this one night we were at my grandparents
place. My grandparents were having guests over for dinner. We were all on
the edge waiting for them to get there.</B>
<P><B>Well thats a whole other story. </B>
<P><B>It was late after their friends left. I was getting ready for bed when
someone shouted someone else had driven up. I went to the window to see who
it was. Outside was one of those old cars people drove in the fifties. I
think the color was blue. Walking to the porch I saw these two black people
dressed like they had been to a wedding or a party coming  to the door. They
weren't dressed like they came from the eighties either. So I haul ass back
to my bedroom to dress when I hear someone say the couple is gone. I go to
look for myself. theres not a sign of the car or the two black people.</B>
<P><B>I dont know if you believe me. Its been so long since it happened I
barely remember most of it myself. So thats my little ghost story. Believe
it if you will.</B>

<H3><A NAME=moving>Moving Day</A>
</H3><P><B>by Falcon8450@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This expirience happend two years ago. My family and I were moving
out of our house after living there for 20 something years. I was only 15
years old at the time, and I had always felt like something was always around
me. That something was always next to me, watching me, touching me, talking
to me. I wasnt the only one either. My brother who is five years older then
me would talk about something making him feel uncomfortable also. It's a
very old house but it was in good condition, like the lights would always
flicker on and off. </B>
<P><B>             Well back to the night we were moving out. I was left
behind to clean out the garage, and make one last sweep of the house. We
only moved a few miles away so its not like it was some kind of big deal.
It soon turned into a big deal for me. We left all the doors in the house
open so we could move out the boxes and furniture. I soon started to feel
extremly cold. It was a very warm summer night and I couldnt possibly believe
that it was because of the doors bieng open. Well I soon started hearing
movement upstairs, so I closed all the doors and locked them. I went up stairs
and made the sweep of the house and I checked all the rooms and closets and
cabinets in the house. I couldnt explain the cold or the noise. So I got
a little frightend and I went outside. When I went outside it got warmer
because like I said it was a warm summer night. Now outside on the sidewalk
there is a point where you can see through the house to the back yard. Then
I say someone looking at me from the other end of the house. So I went back
there and called out to whom ever was out there. Nothing happend except for
something staring at me from inside the house. Then the wind started to pick
up and I got really frightend so I ran out to the front yard and then my
mother pulled up in the drive way. I had never felt so safe in my life. We
had to come back the next mourning to get what was left in the garage. So
when we finally got everything from the house we pulled out from the driveway
and I saw something in the window what looked to be a figure smilling and
waving goodbye to me. </B>

<H3><A NAME=own>My Own "Dream" Story</A>
</H3><P><B>by Labsbabs@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B> This was very emotional for me to write , as I still feel the emotions
as if it were yesterday.  My father whom I loved very much and was very close
with passed away in September of 1990.  This was an extremely difficult time
as my grandmother had passed away the same year in April and my aunt (his
sister), the year before in Sept. also.  An entire family had died within
a year, one of cancer, one of natural causes , and my Dad, eventually of
a heart attack, but I felt mostly a broken heart.  No matter how much we
tried to help him through this time , the depression just won over and worked
on him.  </B>
<P><B>   So needless to say, his passing was an extreme shock to us all,
as he was only 53yrs. old.  I had been called out of work the day it happened
and will not forget to this day, that terrible ride to the hospital, almost
in denial.</B>
<P><B>    For weeks of course the pain of his loss would not go away.  But
one night in particular,  I fell asleep,  in the course of sleeping ,  I
felt at some point I was totally awake, in my Dad's house sitting at the
table, and here he came down the stairs, and I immediately jumped up, "Is
it really you?"  " Yes , he said and he held my hand, and smiled and said
"I am fine, don't worry about me ." I could actually feel his hand on mine
, then we hugged.  After that point he then went back up the stairs, I awoke
to a feeling of such profound realness, if you can explain it that way, and
in some small way a satisfaction of he really was now with his family too.
I have not had another dream of that clarity and feeling since of him.</B>

<H3><A NAME=kentucky>Kentucky Haunting</A>
</H3><P><B>by &nbsp;BELL205</B>
<P>
<P><B>I live in Bellevue, KY in Campbell County. I belong to the Bellevue
Fire Department. Approximately 10 years ago a pat Fire Chief passed away
in our upstairs bar room. The chair he died in is still there. I think everyone
is a little worried aboout getting rid of the old chair due to the strange
things that happen there. Ironically enough only one incident happened outside
of the upstairs area. The ghost only seems to be active upstairs. When watching
tv you will hear someone walk towards the back room from the bar area and
just stop. the sounds are distinct foot steps. Lights and air conditioners
routinely turn themselves on and off for no apparent reason. The only downstairs
incident was in the engine room. Our pumpers have federal sirens they sound
like air raid sirens and have a constant wail. in order to activate them
you have to turn the batteries on and push a pedal on the floor board. The
longer the pedal is pushed the louder and longer the siren will wail. One
night at 3 in the morning one of the federal Q's (siren) began wailing as
loud as it would go, and it wasnt winding down. Obviously the shift on duty
flew out of bed and down to the engine room. One firefighter said lets walk
on each side of the truck and catch whoever is doing this. As they approached
the doors they jerked them open at the same time only to find no one in the
truck!  Also simultaneously as the doors opened the siren began wailing down.
The firefighter on the drivers side noticed the batteries on the truck were
still in the off position. To this day that incident is unexplainable. No
one pushed the pedal in the truck and theres absolutely no way for the siren
to work without the batteries. Another paranormal incident. </B>

<H3><A NAME=step>My Step Fathers House</A>
</H3><P><B>by name withheld by request</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was 14 my mother remarried and we moved into my step father's
house in a nice reidential fairly rich area in the suburb's of Atlanta. The
house was very big. Two stories. You walk in and your on a small landing
with 8 steps going down. 8 going up.</B>
<P><B>If you go down their is a door to your left leading to the garage and
a door to your right leading to the basement which was made into a beautiful
modern apartment. You open that door and there is a hall about 30 feet long.
First door on your left is a gigantic room with 17 foot ceilings that we
used for storage. On your left as you go down the hall is a bedroom used
for the weight room and the second room on your left is my bedroom. Straight
down the hall my bathroom and right above each room was a guest bedroom upstairs.
The oriental room as we called it for it's imported chinese furniture and
it was decorated oriental style was right above the weight room. The Victoian
room as we called it was right above my room. The Victorian room was decorated
as an old Victorian southern style room with my mother's mother's bed in
it, because it was an old oak four poster bed.</B>
<P><B>When I was around 15 I started feeling as though I was being watched.
Like someone was in the bedroom with me.I ignored it. When it started getting
real bad, when I was 16, I kept my TV on 24 hours a day turned on mute and
my stero on always . My parents thought It was strange especially when I
blew the picture tube from keeping it on 24 hours a day non stop for a little
over a year. When the tube blew I insisted they have it fixed immediately
and I slept upstairs in the Victorian room across the hall from their room,
and I also made them sleep with their door open and mine.When the TV returned
from the shop 4 days later my parents were glad to finally have me back
downstairs so they could have their privacy.</B>
<P><B>Well, I got used to the feeling of being watched. After a while it
turned scary.</B>
<P><B>I was lying in bed one night at 4am writing in my journals. I heard
foot steps coming downstairs. I knew it was my step father, getting up early
for work and I knew I'd be in trouble for staying up writing when I had to
be up for school in 3 hours. I jumped in bed, covered my head and pretended
to be asleep praying my step dad wouldn't know i'd been up this late.</B>
<P><B>The steps came down the hall and stopped at my door. I didn't hear
anything. I figured he was peeping in on me trying to see if I was fakeing
sleeping. My door was cracked so I could hear him coming and when I heard
nothing for 5 minutes a chill went through me. That wasn't my step dad. I
looked up and noone was there. At that moment I heard my step dads alarm
go off from upstairs and heard him and my mom getting up. "Go Away." I said
in my most frightened voice. The door slammed and an icy air came into the
room.I covered my my head and started crying praying to god to protect me
and send my angels to protect me and shield me from evil. At that moment
I felt a hot something moving, not moving, but hovering over my body.I uncovered
my head feeling peacefull and the hairs stood up on my neck as this thing
moved over me with this heat and suddenly I was tired and slept like a baby.
I feel that was my gaurdian angel I really do.</B>
<P><B>After a month or so I heard the foot steps all the time at night and
one night day I told my mother what was going on. She then told me that one
morning she was walking back and forth to the kitchen trying to get ready
for work and filling her coffee cup and she heard me walking around downstairs.
She knew if my step father knew that I had been up all night I would be in
trouble. She walked down stairs and called my name, knowing I would answer
to her, which I would. My mom always covered for me.</B>
<P><B>She said I didn't answer so she went in my room and found me asleep.
She kissed my cheek and tucked my covers under my chin. She started to leave
my room and was walking down the hall when she heard the very same foot steps
right behind her. She thought it was me. She said my name when someone brushed
against her shoulder. It was freezing cold. She ran to my room which was
only 10 feet away and found me exactly as she left me.</B>
<P><B>We both knew and decided something was evil and not right. She insisted
I sleep upstairs in the Victorian room until All was calm. I did for 2 weeks
and after I felt comfortable moved back into my room. That night I was sitting
up in bed, which was a friday night. I was reading. I heard the steps. Ignored
them and my bedroom door that was cracked about 8 inchs banged open and the
cold air flew in. I looked up and this huge black shadow was above my head
and as I gasped it disapperaed into the ceiling as it made a sound as if
it were being sucked into the ceiling.</B>
<P><B>I ran upstairs and my mother was in the room crying, telling me she
had just come in to straighten the room when she felt a presence. She told
it to leave and the room was calm. My mother had told this thing to leave
the exact same moment the black massive shadow got sucked into the ceiling.
My mother claims it was her dead mother coming to check on her. I disagree.
My mothers mother died when she was 15 before she was ever married or had
children.</B>
<P><B>We never heard from the ghost or what ever it was again until 1 year
later a week before I moved out. I was in the kitchen upstairs folding clothes
and moving from the kitchen to the laundry room when I though I saw my mother
in the living room, whom I knew was in bed sound asleep and I would have
heard and seen come into the living room.</B>
<P><B>I called her name and went into the living room when I saw a woman
with short blonde hair and a long white nightgown on, ignore me and disappear
into the wall. My mother has short blonde hair but her hair is dyed blonde.
My mothers mother looked nothing like her. She had dark brown hair. I have
no idea if that ghost was trying to look like my mom or what but it scared
me and I never heard from Any other ghost in the house again.</B>
