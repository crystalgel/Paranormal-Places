<b><font size=+1>Haunted House Of Ohio</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: anonymous</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>In the early seventies, we purchased a home, in Southern, Ohio, annexing</b>
<br><b>the Capital, City, Columbus, in a small, town, called Georgesville.
It</b>
<br><b>was remodled, and build around, a Two room log cabin, That locals,
said,</b>
<br><b>was owned and lived in, by a major, of the Civil War, and that he
issued</b>
<br><b>his troops, from here, to the war, going on. The part, of the home,
that</b>
<br><b>was this orginal, log cabin home, was a bedroom, and Dining room,
and a</b>
<br><b>portion, of a huge, living room, also, part of our basement, was</b>
<br><b>orginal, fruit cellar, and storage area, of log cabin, From the
time, we</b>
<br><b>moved in, with our three, small, children, things, started, (or,
I</b>
<br><b>think, continued, to happen,) Our children, were first, to be bothered,</b>
<br><b>in the bedroom, that was part, of the cabin, in which was theirs,
we had</b>
<br><b>bunk beds, in here, They started to get up, during the night, running,</b>
<br><b>and crying, to our bedroom, and my husband would try and make them,
go</b>
<br><b>back to their room, but they would scream, and cry, saying something
was</b>
<br><b>in there, They would end up, sleeping with us, All, three, of them,
They</b>
<br><b>said, something would pick them up, and turn them, in mid air, and
lay</b>
<br><b>them, back, on their beds, and that there was scratching on their</b>
<br><b>windows, and shadows, they could see, There was a big, Antique Doll,
I</b>
<br><b>had, that belonged to my grandmother, she dressed it in clothes
she</b>
<br><b>made, And I had it in a corner of our home, our children, said,
its eyes</b>
<br><b>followed them, and it would move, I put it in the basement, far
back, in</b>
<br><b>a corner, and the next day, in the early morning, it was standing,
up,</b>
<br><b>on its feet, at foot of basement steps, on the basement floor, facing</b>
<br><b>Forward, toward, bottom step, looking up the basement stairs, And
at</b>
<br><b>night, we all began to hear sounds, of someone, playing pool, hitting,</b>
<br><b>the pool balls, and making pockets, on our pool table, that was
down&nbsp; in</b>
<br><b>the basement, also. (my husband could always find a reason, for
all</b>
<br><b>this, in his reasoning,) In other words, he thought the children,
and I</b>
<br><b>were crazy. There was always a bad smell, in this house, no matter,
how</b>
<br><b>much I cleaned, and tried to get rid of it, it would still be there.</b>
<br><b>Every Three nights, at around, midnight, I heard, (and this was
winter,</b>
<br><b>and a lot, of snow on, outside, and with huge, drifts, outside,
our</b>
<br><b>bedroom window, )A sound of Loud, Heavy, Labored, Raspey, breathing,</b>
<br><b>running , past our window, It sounded loud enough, to be in the
same</b>
<br><b>room,even, and to always wake me up, I'd awake, my husband, and
tell</b>
<br><b>him, he'd tell me, to go back to sleep, that it was only my imagenation,</b>
<br><b>nothing out there, One night after, a couple, months, of this, alone,
he</b>
<br><b>was awake, and heard it also, he said, "What was that? " I told
him, "</b>
<br><b>That was my imagenation, is what you always tell me", He went, and</b>
<br><b>looked all around, out side, in the new, fresh, snowfall, and the</b>
<br><b>drifts, there was no tracks, of any kind, at all. Then, a friend,
of</b>
<br><b>ours, gave me a big, Pinao, which we put in the dining room, After</b>
<br><b>around four nights, of it being, in our house, woke me up, one night,</b>
<br><b>playing, from a deep, sleep, I awoke, to a Ping, ping, ping, sound
of</b>
<br><b>it, I laid there, in bed, and argued with myself, in my mind, you
did</b>
<br><b>not hear that, you were dreaming, And then, I heard, a Pong, pong,
pong,</b>
<br><b>sound from it, the hairs, on my arms stood, on end, honest, I was
scared</b>
<br><b>really, really, bad,I thought my heart would thud, out of my chest,
it</b>
<br><b>was beating so hard, and fast, I again, woke my husband, he did
not</b>
<br><b>believe me, Next day, we had a back porch, that over looked a small,</b>
<br><b>hill, and creek, and that pinao, had wheels, and I pushed it out
on the</b>
<br><b>porch, and told my husband, if he didn't help me get rid of it,
I'd roll</b>
<br><b>it off the porch, down the hill, he got rid of it, and we put the
house</b>
<br><b>up for sell, and sold it, and moved out. I hope you all, reading
this,</b>
<br><b>believes me, and my children, for this is all, true, and if you
don't</b>
<br><b>believe me, you could try, to buy this same, house yourself, and
see if</b>
<br><b>this is true, for yourselves, because its up for sale, again now.</b>
<br><b>Signed,&nbsp; Lady ,glad to get out of there.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Haunted Town</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; supersaien91678@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;it is my old house. in my times there i had experienced many
different</b>
<br><b>supernatural experiences. the upstairs wouldnot let you go if you
look up at the opening in the hall it would freeze you still, the basement
had an oil heater. over by the tank for the oil by the electrical box,
you can feel this horrible cold no matter what you do you cant get rid
of this freezing cold feeling. you feel someone touching you and looking
at you when you stand there. the house when we first moved in mad these
horrible noises, stomping around the house, voices, knocking on doors and
walls. the stomping would walk right up to my bed and</b>
<br><b>stop i wouldnt move, this lasted at least three years. the most
and foremost supernatural experience was when i went home one day after
school and i was going to watch charatoons, i was laying down with my dog.
it was about three thirty i can remember what time it was vividly cause
of what was on&nbsp; tv at that time. when i was watching tv there was
a knock at my door. i was like what whos that? my parents werent to be
home till five</b>
<br><b>oclock. so i stayed in my bed room. the knock on bed room door got
worse. it was harder and louder and more forceful. so i went over to the
door and opened it up and nothing was there the hall light was on which
shouldnt have been cause it was no later than four oclock. when i opened
the door this strong gust of cold wind camp running past me into my room.
my dog started barking. the wind almost pushed me down. i grabed my dog
and walked to my grandmothers. this house is very haunted, the whole town
is. malvern is a town that is famous for the civil</b>
<br><b>war massacure that is called the "malvern massacure" the whole town
was wiped out by southern forces. there were american indians as well living
these parts. all the inhabitants were slaughtered. i think that is part
is the reason for my houses haunted reputation. the feeling in the house
was evil and of an emense anger. my parents and i know treat each other
much better now that we're not there.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>The Picture</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: BaBgrl8475@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;My grandfather died when I was about 7 years old. My grandmother
now</b>
<br><b>lives all by herself in an apartment where they lived together.
My</b>
<br><b>grandfather cared for me a lot. I loved him and was very close to
him. One</b>
<br><b>night, when my grandmother was asleep, I was in the living room
by myself</b>
<br><b>watching television. Off the reflection of the t.v, I could see
something</b>
<br><b>moving in the background. I looked behind me real slow, and saw
my picture on</b>
<br><b>the wall. this is the same picture my grandfather loved of me, but
what the</b>
<br><b>odd thing was was that the chandelier was right in front of the
picture. The</b>
<br><b>reflection off the picture of the chandelier was moving very rapidly
and</b>
<br><b>swinging wildly as if it were in the middle of a hurricane. The
chandelier</b>
<br><b>and the picture itself were both very still. This is a tricky story
and it is</b>
<br><b>very confusing if you have not experienced something like it before.
Nobody</b>
<br><b>else that I know of has ever heard or seen something like this before,
and</b>
<br><b>since you know more about ghosts than I do, I would like for you
to tell me</b>
<br><b>what you think is going on in my grandmother's house and e-mail
me back at</b>
<br><b>BaBgrl8475@aol.com later on when you understand or have an idea
what's going</b>
<br><b>on. Thank you.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Hawaiian Haunts</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cjn@aloha.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>i live in hawaii and i used to live in a haunted house in one of
the most</b>
<br><b>haunted places in hawaii.&nbsp; when i was about 4 years old they
found a</b>
<br><b>skeleton of an ancient hawaiian warrior about 15 feet under ground
in my</b>
<br><b>back yard.&nbsp; we were convinced that there was another skeleton
under our</b>
<br><b>house because there was a man that haunted the bathroom in the library.&nbsp;
he</b>
<br><b>was a dark-skinned man and he was somewhat old.&nbsp; i only ever
saw him by</b>
<br><b>himself but other family members have seen him with his family too.&nbsp;
he</b>
<br><b>never made any gestures or anything...he just stood there.</b>
<br><b>let me give you some history on my house.&nbsp; it was a mansion
that was built</b>
<br><b>in 1912.&nbsp; it started out as a 1 room pre-school house, but
every owner of</b>
<br><b>the house after that added a room.&nbsp; it had a lot of history.</b>
<br><b>there were these two boys that died at the house when it was a pre-school.</b>
<br><b>their names were micheal and john.&nbsp; only my brother saw them
but i heard</b>
<br><b>them a lot of times.&nbsp; they used to play tricks on me and switch
off the</b>
<br><b>lights when i wasn't looking and closing doors suddenly and stuff
like that.</b>
<br><b>one day my brother came up to me and he said "their names are micheal
and</b>
<br><b>john."&nbsp; i believed him.&nbsp; my brother was in pre-school
then so i guessed that</b>
<br><b>the two ghost boys wanted someone their own age to play with.&nbsp;
it made</b>
<br><b>sense.&nbsp; they also used to play tag on the second floor.&nbsp;
when my mom and i</b>
<br><b>were home all alone we would here footsteps coming from the upstairs</b>
<br><b>hallway.&nbsp; they would also play hide and go seek.</b>
<br><b>i just grew up with the ghosts right beside me so i was never really
afraid</b>
<br><b>of them accept for the one in the bathroom.&nbsp; i never ran by
that bathroom at</b>
<br><b>night...never.&nbsp; i always ran.&nbsp; i was always overwhelmed
with fear and i was</b>
<br><b>so scared.&nbsp; something inside me just said to run away.</b><b></b>
<p><b>now i live in kailua.&nbsp; its on the other side of the mountain
range.&nbsp; we had</b>
<br><b>to move because we couldn't afford it anymore.</b>
<br><b>but now i live right down the street from a heiau (an ancient hawaiian</b>
<br><b>village which is now a huge pile of rocks).&nbsp; it was a sacred
place for the</b>
<br><b>hawaiians.&nbsp; now i've been having some strange experiences here.&nbsp;
when we</b>
<br><b>leave we lock my brothers door with a key...we make sure its closed.&nbsp;
when</b>
<br><b>we come back or just leave the room for a second and come back its
wide</b>
<br><b>open.&nbsp; i've seen it open once when it was locked.</b>
<br><b>just during this spring break i was walking out from a hallway where
my room</b>
<br><b>is (it was around noon) and then all of a sudden the shandelear
turns on.</b>
<br><b>all my itself.&nbsp; i wait for it to turn off becuase i think its
an electricity</b>
<br><b>thing but it doesn't go off.&nbsp; then i look over at the light
switch and it</b>
<br><b>was flicked on.&nbsp; so i walked over and turned it off.&nbsp;
i was kinda freeked</b>
<br><b>out but growing up the way i did, it didn't effect me much.&nbsp;
then just this</b>
<br><b>morning i was walking from the same hallway and i was in the exact
spot that</b>
<br><b>i was in when the light turned off and then i heard someone whisper
"we have</b>
<br><b>nine".&nbsp; it was very clear but still softly.&nbsp; i thought
nothing of it and</b>
<br><b>went back to my room when i came back out and i got to that spot
all i heard</b>
<br><b>was more whispering but it was fading away and i couldn't understand
it.</b>
<br><b>then i got freeked out and i told my mom and she nearly fainted.&nbsp;
every once</b>
<br><b>in a while i see someone walking across my living room out of the
corner of</b>
<br><b>my eye...but i'm home alone.</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>I think we may have a couple of ghosts!!</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: tmetzler@eclipse.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>It all started in February, on the 18th to be exact. I was in the
kitchen</b>
<br><b>alone, cooking dinner and happened to look up to see one of our
pans</b>
<br><b>swinging rapidly back and forth while the other five hung motionless.
It</b>
<br><b>wasn't just jiggling either. It was swinging a full 3-4 inches each
way.</b>
<br><b>There is no way that the pan could have been bumped since it is
hung from</b>
<br><b>the ceiling. There is also no way that it was moved by some kind
of breeze</b>
<br><b>either. The windows were all closed and if a breeze was present,
the</b>
<br><b>smaller, lighter pans next to it would have been moving as well.&nbsp;
(This has</b>
<br><b>happened again this past week and was witnessed by my significant
other.</b>
<br><b>The same pan was involved, and the pans on either side of it remained</b>
<br><b>unaffected.)</b><b></b>
<p><b>The knobs on the stove have also shut themselves off while we are
in the</b>
<br><b>kitchen.&nbsp; They made a loud 'click' when they turned off. They
would have had</b>
<br><b>to turn nearly one-half the way around by themselves.&nbsp; They
do not turn</b>
<br><b>easily.</b><b></b>
<p><b>About a week after the first incident, my boyfriend and I were sitting</b>
<br><b>outside on the back steps talking, and all of a sudden I noticed
a thick</b>
<br><b>white smoke hovering to his left by his shoulder.&nbsp; When I looked
directly at</b>
<br><b>it, it dissipated.&nbsp; A few days later, my boyfriend also saw
the smoke in our</b>
<br><b>dining room hovering to the right of our light fixture near the
ceiling.</b><b></b>
<p><b>This past Sunday night, we were out on the back steps again.&nbsp;
Our back room</b>
<br><b>is all glass and the windows cast shadows on the neighbors house
when the</b>
<br><b>ceiling light fixture is on.&nbsp; My boyfriend was sitting three
steps down from</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; One right after another, we felt a chill pass through
us and then he</b>
<br><b>saw what looked like a shadow of smoke cast on the neighbors house
passing</b>
<br><b>by the windows.</b><b></b>
<p><b>On two occasions, the TV has spontaneously shut off when someone
was asked</b>
<br><b>to turn it off.&nbsp; No one was near the remote either time and
we do not have a</b>
<br><b>sleep timer on this TV.</b><b></b>
<p><b>We do not feel threatened by whatever caused these things to happen</b>
<br><b>upstairs.&nbsp; However, we all feel that a different, less friendly
entity</b>
<br><b>resides in our basement.&nbsp; We have never seen it manifest itself,
but, we</b>
<br><b>feel extremely uncomfortable and frightened every time we venture
downstairs</b>
<br><b>to do the laundry.&nbsp; We are certain that we are being watched
from the other</b>
<br><b>side of the basement while we are there.&nbsp; My boyfriend has
felt its presence</b>
<br><b>on the basement stairs, but believes that it is confined to those
areas.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>doesn't know why. For some reason, the basement has two different</b>
<br><b>foundations and there are sections of old walls that have been broken</b>
<br><b>through.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>I thought I saw my dad's ghost once....</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SteveHigh5@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My fathers name was Hunter Brashier.&nbsp; We
moved to Ankeny, Iowa around mid</b>
<br><b>to late June in 94.&nbsp; He had bad asthma.&nbsp; I was interested
in horses and began</b>
<br><b>to take lessons at a stable.&nbsp; Sometime around mid January of
95, proably</b>
<br><b>around the 18 or 19 my instructor invited us to a horse show on
the 22.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend Shae had slept over and we were going
to the horse show.&nbsp;&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>mom didn't want to come, but for some reason she changed her mind
at the last</b>
<br><b>minute.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the way there we stopped at a returaunt and
ate.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon my dad started to cough and wheeze and we
found out that Shae's cat</b>
<br><b>always slept on the suitcase she had broguht.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We reached the horseshow, but only stayed for
a few minutes, my dad's</b>
<br><b>asthma was getting worse.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a long drive ack to Ankeny, probably about
45 min. to1 hr.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>were bac in Ankeny and just a beside the street which led to Mercy
clinic</b>
<br><b>wehn my dad started to cuss.&nbsp; All teh time m mom had offered
to drive, but he</b>
<br><b>had refused.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was having difficulty breathing.&nbsp; He
scooted over and mom ra around</b>
<br><b>and hopped into the drivers seat.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car was a suburban.&nbsp; It had the driver
and passenger seat and an</b>
<br><b>extra up in the front, all connected.&nbsp; Next there was another
row of seets.</b>
<br><b>Then there was a huge area in the back to put stuff.&nbsp; Shae,
becca(my sister)</b>
<br><b>and myself were huddeled backt there under a blanket.&nbsp; As you
children, we</b>
<br><b>were terrified seeing my dad dying.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She started the car and jammed her foot on the
accelerater.&nbsp; She took the</b>
<br><b>road that led to the clinic.&nbsp; She was going so fast that whe
seh reached the</b>
<br><b>clinic, she went over a curb.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were still hiding under the blanket, but I
looked up to see her get</b>
<br><b>out of the car and run to see if it was open on a Sunday.&nbsp;
My dad was</b>
<br><b>feverishly trying to get his seatbelt off.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came back with help adn a wheelchair.&nbsp;
They wheeled him in the clinic</b>
<br><b>and left us in the car with the motor still running.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lady came out, parked the car and took us inside.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they wouldn't let us go see or father.&nbsp;
After maybe 20-30 min. of</b>
<br><b>waiting, oe of Shae's moms friends picked us up.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of teh back window I wathced as the helicopter
they had been waiting</b>
<br><b>for finally arrived, it only takes like, 20 min. to get to des MOines,
it</b>
<br><b>would have been faster to go in a car I think.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We drew pictures for&nbsp; my dad, and even argued
over who got to color them,</b>
<br><b>we were sure he was going to be fine.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; about 3 hrs. later, around 6 we drove to the
Des Moines hospital.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when we got there mom took us over to the side
and explained that daddy</b>
<br><b>had died.&nbsp; She took us to the room where he was.&nbsp; It looked
more like a cell</b>
<br><b>than a room.&nbsp; the walls around it were steel.&nbsp; He was
lying in the bed, in a</b>
<br><b>hspital dress.&nbsp; tubes hooked to his nose, needes in his arms.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was horrified.&nbsp; He was so grey, he didn't
even looked human.&nbsp; He looked</b>
<br><b>like a perfectly scupted model of grey clay, that was the color
he was.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mom said I could kiss him and touch him, but
I just couldn't.&nbsp; I was only</b>
<br><b>7 at the time.&nbsp; She kissed him, but I couldn't move.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the thing I regret most even to this
day, I never said goodbye to</b>
<br><b>him.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later we moved out of the old house because mom
had no job and couldn't</b>
<br><b>afford it.&nbsp; We moved to a small one story house, further in
Ankeny and sold</b>
<br><b>the suburban.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night, I was in my room and trying to get
to sleep.&nbsp; My room was</b>
<br><b>cubic in shape, but had a small, maybe 2 ft wide and 2 ft long passage
that</b>
<br><b>led to the door.&nbsp; two of its walls were outside walls.&nbsp;
One touched my moms</b>
<br><b>room, and the other made up the wall of the livng room.&nbsp; I
had a window on</b>
<br><b>the wall which ran parellel to the street.&nbsp; My closet was on
the wal which</b>
<br><b>made up hte living room, and at that time I had my be, the long
side, resting</b>
<br><b>agianst the wall in between my moms room and my own.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was diagonal from my closet.&nbsp; My closet
had thouse sliding doors.&nbsp; On</b>
<br><b>the left side, it had several wire shelved that ran up to the top
to put</b>
<br><b>clothes in.&nbsp; A long wire shelf that ran the length of the sloset
was at the</b>
<br><b>top.&nbsp; Another shelf ran from one of the shelves that I put
my slothes in, to</b>
<br><b>the right side to seperate the sloset in half, upper, and lower.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I glanced at my closet and starred in terror.&nbsp;
A luminous, but not quite</b>
<br><b>transparent form was sitting indian style, almost on top of the
middle long</b>
<br><b>shelf that ran across the right side of my closet.&nbsp; It appeared
to be</b>
<br><b>floating in mid air, it kind've moved up and down a few inches and
starring</b>
<br><b>directly at me.&nbsp; It reminded me of my father, the same face,
body, everything.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I closed my eyes and tried to pretend I was seeing
things.&nbsp; I opened them</b>
<br><b>and it was still there.&nbsp; The same thing happened a coupled
more times until I</b>
<br><b>opened my eyes agian and the figure just kind've drifted up into
the top of</b>
<br><b>the closet and didn't reappear.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seconds later, I looked again.&nbsp; The figure
was back, this time he</b>
<br><b>unfolded his legs and emerged from the closet, he was as real as
anything,</b>
<br><b>but he had that wierd lminous quality, and anyway, daddy was dead,
I had</b>
<br><b>gotten over the fact that he was deadlong before.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked towards me, which amazes me to this
day.&nbsp; I didn't like to</b>
<br><b>clean my room, even my mom didn't dare come in because she always
ended up</b>
<br><b>stepping or tripping on something.&nbsp; I loved leggos and was
building</b>
<br><b>something.&nbsp; They were strewn everywhere, along with clothes,
books, exc.</b>
<br><b>That scared the crap outta me, cause up until then I was hoping
it was just</b>
<br><b>my sister or something.&nbsp; He made no noise, even though he was
stepping acrss</b>
<br><b>and over leggos and who knows what else.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I pulled the covers over my head and repeated
to myself several times</b>
<br><b>"This is a dream, you're are not nuts, this isn't real, wake up,
please wake</b>
<br><b>up!"</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I removed the covers, he was standing above
me.&nbsp; He reached down a</b>
<br><b>hand and seemed to place it on my cheek.&nbsp; His lips seemed to
move and I</b>
<br><b>thought he might've said "Goodnight Alex."</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he turned and walked back to my closet,
he resumed his indian style</b>
<br><b>postion and hovered for awhile before he floated up into the top
of the</b>
<br><b>closet and vanished.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I never did see him agian.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, and smetimes, even before that incidense,
I thought I felt</b>
<br><b>him.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, in the basement, we kept his old
huge leather rocking chair</b>
<br><b>type thingy.&nbsp; Several times wen my sister, and even with friends
we would go</b>
<br><b>downstairs to find it rocking, though no wind could have moved it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wierd things would happen.&nbsp; Like tings would
disappear, and I'd find them</b>
<br><b>in some spot where I knew I hadn't put them.&nbsp; Or our dog Kiki,
would act</b>
<br><b>strange.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know if I really did see my dads ghost,
many have just told me</b>
<br><b>that I was asleep, or imagining it, but I know I couldn't have been
asleep, I</b>
<br><b>remember being able to feel my own skin, sweat as a watched, terrified.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>have never encountered these other feelings in dreams, adn I've
never been</b>
<br><b>able to remember a dream so vividly.&nbsp; It is possible that maybe
it was just a</b>
<br><b>shadow, or the mind of an 7 or 8 year old playing tricks.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I do feel comforted believing that my dad
is still with me.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Kentucky Haunted House</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This is a few, short, stories, But, True, That happened to my husband</b>
<br><b>,growing up, in Ky.&nbsp; My husband, says, The house he grew up
in, was</b>
<br><b>haunted, One night, he was laying, in his bed,( when he was around,
10,</b>
<br><b>year old,) facing the wall, on his side, and something, awakened
him, he</b>
<br><b>heard something come in his room, and sit down, on the side, of
the bed,</b>
<br><b>over from him, (they were raised very poor, so, their matress'es
were</b>
<br><b>made of corn shucks, from corn, out of their garden, and feed sacks,</b>
<br><b>sewed together, by their mom, for a cover,for these, and these were</b>
<br><b>stuffed, in the matress cover, she made, to make the matresses,
for</b>
<br><b>their beds And when someone turned over, or sit, on bed, the matress</b>
<br><b>would make a rustling, sound, you also, sank down, in these matresses,</b>
<br><b>when laying, in bed .)&nbsp; and when he heard this, he thought
it was his</b>
<br><b>older, brother, coming home, from a date, of his, so, he turned
over,</b>
<br><b>but noone was there, but, he could see the matress, was indented,
on</b>
<br><b>side, as though ,someone was sitting there, he said, he covered
his</b>
<br><b>head, and peeped out a small rip in his quilt, and heard, the rustling,</b>
<br><b>of the matress, as something, he could not see, laid down, and could
see</b>
<br><b>matress moving, as well as hear the rustling, of it, as something
also,</b>
<br><b>turned over, and seen indention, of a form, unseen, of something,
sunk</b>
<br><b>down, in matress, laying there, he&nbsp; lay there awake, till his
brother,</b>
<br><b>came home, and turned the light on, and told him, what he seen,
and</b>
<br><b>there was nothing there ,then , at all.Of coarse, he wasn't believed,</b>
<br><b>but as a grown, married, father, of still today, he remembers it.</b>
<br><b>Also, he said, all his family would hear,at least, a couple, times
a</b>
<br><b>month, from, upon, a real, tall, mountain, beside thier house, a,
train,</b>
<br><b>running, blowing its whistle, and then,a terrible loud, sound, that</b>
<br><b>sounded like, a trian crash, and rolling down this mountain, and
the</b>
<br><b>train cars, tearing big, trees, down, as the train cars, rolled
down the</b>
<br><b>mountain side, a roaring, loud, crashing sound, and to investigate
this,</b>
<br><b>they walked to the very top, of this mountain, and searched, there
was</b>
<br><b>no old, train tracks, any where at all, or any sign of any damage,
at</b>
<br><b>all, to the mountain, or trees, nothing, to account, for train and</b>
<br><b>crash, they all heard.</b>
<br><b>Also, There was this old, man, that lived up a hollow, above them,
and</b>
<br><b>rumors was he had money, hid, in his old, log home, he lived in,
( and</b>
<br><b>this was rumored to everyone, that lived around, in this area, my</b>
<br><b>husband said, when he was a small, boy growing up, he heard different,</b>
<br><b>grownups, talking about this, happening, before he was born,) Someone,</b>
<br><b>(never found out who,) Broke in the cabin, trying to find the old,
man's</b>
<br><b>money, and the old, man, arrived back, unexpected, and he was killed,
by</b>
<br><b>this robber,or, robbers, the old saying goes, and his head was also,
cut</b>
<br><b>off, and placed on a big, rock, laying in a creek, beside of the
cabin,</b>
<br><b>and to this day, at least, Sixty years later, the old man's blood
from</b>
<br><b>his head, is on this big, rock, even though creek, is now running,
and</b>
<br><b>has been for years, over this rock, his head, was placed on, when
he was</b>
<br><b>killed, When visting, his family years later, after he grew into
a man,</b>
<br><b>and we married, he took me up to the creek, and showed me, the rock,
the</b>
<br><b>top, and spots, running down, the side, of this rock, is deep, red.
Also</b>
<br><b>after, this happened, tales were told, of the old man, being seen,
on a</b>
<br><b>horse, riding, up and down, this hollow, with his head, tucked up
under</b>
<br><b>one, arm, and him being headless, riding, back and forth, and it
was</b>
<br><b>being said, he was looking for who murdered him, for his revenge.</b>

<p><b>If you will permit me I would like to tell you two more stories.&nbsp;
the first from a period when I was still on the railway.</b>
<br><b>I rode a motor-cycle in those day and was in the process of giving
a friend a ride home.&nbsp; It was a nasty night of heavy rain,&nbsp; we
were on a back road out in the countryside around Carlisle England,&nbsp;
I admit I was travelling far to fast along a good straight stretch of road
Riding with one hand I was speaking over my shoulder to my passenger when
he shouted to me to look out.&nbsp; I looked forward and in my head and
spotlight a figure,&nbsp; a man in a mac. stood in the centre of the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;
When the bike came to a stand we were still upright,&nbsp; but well past
were the figure had been,&nbsp; I turned the bike and allowed the lights
to illuminate the road,&nbsp; there was nothing,&nbsp; we walked the grass
verges,&nbsp; there was not a mark.&nbsp; Getting back on the bike I set
of slowly,&nbsp; almost at once we were on</b>
<br><b>a sharp right hand corner,&nbsp; at the original speed we would
not have made it round.&nbsp; The next day in the light I went back to
look at the road,&nbsp; I could not get it out of my head that I had hit
some-one. There was nothing there,&nbsp; in fact it was doudtfull if a
person could have got onto the road,&nbsp; the hedge was high and thick.</b>
<br><b>My other story comes from some time later,&nbsp; involing my wife
and three friends.&nbsp; One of these friends had spent some time in a
nortorious Scottish prison and considered her self beyond frightening Our
target was a church yard on the English/Scottish border called Kirk-Andrews-on-Esk.&nbsp;
The church was on the banks of the border Esk river,</b>
<br><b>about a half of a mile from the A7 Carlisle to Edinburgh road.&nbsp;
It fitted well into any ghost story,&nbsp; dark, lonely and apart from
the river very, silent with its tale of a Grey Lady.</b>
<br><b>A chain brige spanned the river from the back hedge,&nbsp; beginning
in a stand of trees.&nbsp; We all walked through the church yard along
a sunken path,&nbsp; on one side graves,&nbsp; on the other trees and a
drop into the river.</b>
<br><b>It was in the early hours,&nbsp; some of us were tired and decided
enough was enough and it was time time go home. At the car we realised
one was missing,&nbsp; the hard girl.&nbsp; My wife and I stood at the
wall looking into the grave yard,&nbsp; in the quiet a sound was coming
from the direction of the swing bridge,&nbsp; a chink-chink as if it were
being walked on.</b>
<br><b>I remarked to my wife that Fiona was on the bridge.&nbsp;&nbsp;
My wife spoiled everything by pointing out tha Fiona was only a few feet
to the right approaching from the direction of the church itself.&nbsp;
A short pause for silence revealed the same steady chink from the bridge.If
you are ever in England I would recommend a look at that church,&nbsp;
it never has a cheerfull look.&nbsp; There are many ghost stories from
this district,&nbsp; the locals can make the nape hairs raise quite readily.</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My first experience was on October 7, 1995. My uncle had just died
that day,</b>
<br><b>and I was in bed crying myself to sleep and thinking about him and
how I</b>
<br><b>never really got to say goodbye properly. All of a sudden, I felt
something</b>
<br><b>warm grab my hand and squeeze it to comfort. I immediately felt
very calm and</b>
<br><b>actually stopped crying. Then, just as quickly as it came, it was
gone. I</b>
<br><b>really do believe that was my uncle saying goodbye to me.</b><b></b>
<p><b>My other experience happened last year around this time. I came home
from</b>
<br><b>night classes. It was about 10:00. I was gathering my stuff up to
go inside</b>
<br><b>when I looked into my rearview mirror. I saw a woman walking by.
I turned</b>
<br><b>around to look, but there was nothing there. I thought it was my
imagination,</b>
<br><b>but I saw her reflection again in my neighbors windows. So I turned
around</b>
<br><b>again, and there was still nothing there. Needless to say, I ran
to door</b>
<br><b>because I was freaked out. After that, my car has been acting really
wacky. I</b>
<br><b>would swear that that woman haunts it sometimes.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>My Personal Experience</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: b.saunders@cableinet.co.uk</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My mother was diagnosed with Altzimers disease which she endured
for</b>
<br><b>four years before her death. Whilst she was ill and living in a
nursing home I</b>
<br><b>somehow came to terms with her death before she actually died due
to the</b>
<br><b>nature of the illness, so when she did die although it was still
a shock</b>
<br><b>to me I had already grieved for her.</b>
<br><b>Her apartment had been rented out to pay towards the cost of the
home. I</b>
<br><b>moved in with my two children. After living there for about three
months</b>
<br><b>one evening while my children were in bed asleep, I was in my bedroom</b>
<br><b>getting ready for bed. I left the room to go to the bathroom and
I had</b>
<br><b>to walk across the hallway diagonally towards the bathroom (the
light</b>
<br><b>from my bedroom was more than adequate so I did not need to put
the hall</b>
<br><b>light on as well). Before I reached the bathroom I saw out of the
corner</b>
<br><b>of my eye what appeared to be something to my left, I look towards
the</b>
<br><b>left of me and saw the apparition of my mother. She was not exactly
a</b>
<br><b>whole being more of an impression, I could not see her face but
her hair</b>
<br><b>was done like it had just been set at the hairdressers (many years</b>
<br><b>before her illness), she had the same slight build of my mother
and the</b>
<br><b>same height and she was wearing a dark blue housecoat which I had</b>
<br><b>completely forgotten about as I had thrown it away as it was in
almost</b>
<br><b>in rags. I was petrified and in shock, I ran into the bathroom and
when</b>
<br><b>I ventured out she was no longer there. Although I was extremely
scared</b>
<br><b>at first, afterwards with hindsight I realised it was more like
a</b>
<br><b>religious experience.</b>
<br><b>Many months later I happened to go along with a friend to a spiritualist</b>
<br><b>church to have a one to one reading. I would like to add at this</b>
<br><b>juncture that it was not a commercial venture. My mother came through
to</b>
<br><b>the medium. I did not say anything to the medium apart from greeting
her</b>
<br><b>when I entered the room. Afterwards, however, I did ask what else
my</b>
<br><b>mother had to say, the medium then informed me after a few seconds,
that</b>
<br><b>my mother says to me through her 'why are you asking me, I have
already</b>
<br><b>shown myself to you'.</b>
