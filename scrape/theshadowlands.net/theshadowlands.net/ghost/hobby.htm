in the ghost hunting or research field</font></font></b></center>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>
<p><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have always wanted to address this
topic but have held off because of the toes I may step on in the process
but after recent events in my own area I have to say what's been on my
mind. The people in this field of ghost hunting, ghost research, etc all
have different motives for being in this field and want different things
out the time they spend doing related activities.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many people are what I consider hobbyists.
They are the ghost hunter who is looking for proof that ghosts exist and
enjoy they the thrill of the hunt. The excitement of the actual ghost hunt
and the possibility of experiencing something supernatural first hand is
what drives this type of person. Many are dedicated and spend many hours
enjoying their hobby and they do contribute much to the collective data
pool in this filed of ghost research. They do their ghost hunts in cemeteries
and other locations that are open to them. There is one place that the
hobbyist does not belong, a&nbsp; private home. Unless they make it perfectly
clear to the home owner that they are just hobbyists and have some experience
in doing home investigation they should not be there. There are many things
that can go wrong naturally and supernaturally by inexperienced people
messing around in homes where the residents will be staying in long after
the ghost hunters leave. You can wind up scaring the residents, stirring
up activity, etc. The scenarios are endless and it is not fair to the residents.
There are plenty of other locations for the hobbyist to go to do their
work without putting people at risk.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;The next group is the serious
researcher. Whether they use scientific equipment or methods and/or psychics
to go about their research in the ghost realm, they both are seeking the
same thing, proof that ghosts exist. They go about this in very exact manner
and many established groups fall into this category. The overall focus
and goal is to provide evidence that there are ghosts at a location or
that ghosts exist overall. They use meters and other equipment, follow
strict protocols and provide documentation of their research. They will
be the ones who will find the "proof" if it is ever gong to be found. The
serious researcher also should steer clear of private homes unless they
explain exactly what they are going to do and why. If you go into someone's
home who is experiencing a lot of spirit activity and you find nothing
on your&nbsp; equipment, do you now conclude the house has no activity
? Even if&nbsp; you don't tell the witnesses that, how do they feel after
you&nbsp; leave? Do they feel like they were imagining it all? How do they
react if the activity still occurs? If the people in the home are&nbsp;
concerned or frightened in some degree then the researcher can often&nbsp;
make things worse. Going into someone's home to collect data and telling
them what your meters read does little to console a frightened child who
cannot sleep in their room at night or the adult who wants to sell their
house because of the activity in it. If you are a strictly research oriented
group or investigator, please consider the situation in the home before
you decide to do your research there. Remember you get to go home after
your research is done but the homeowners have to stay. If the residents
are not completely comfortable with what is going on&nbsp; in the home,
then please show sensitivity and go somewhere else to&nbsp; do research.
I am speaking from experience as a resident who once called a scientific
research group from a university for assistance&nbsp; in my childhood home.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;The final category are extremely
similar the researchers. These are the investigators that are in this field
to provide comfort and assistance. They follow most of the same procedures
and use much of the same equipment in their work. The proof that ghost
exist is secondary the these investigators, the living come first. They
go into a home with the goal of making people who are frightened or uncomfortable
feel better about the events in their home. They use many techniques to
educate the residents. Sometimes just sitting down with the residents and
listening to the experiences can help them over come their fear, especially
when they see that they are&nbsp; talking to people that understand what
they are going through. If&nbsp; it takes more than that, this kind of
investigator will do whatever they can to make the residents comfortable
in their home. If the end result comes without the investigator getting
any good photos or EVPs, that is ok with them because the reward is in
seeing the people relax in their own home. I have personally been on cases
where after we were finished the resident took down their "house for sale"
sign or the parents of a young child called to say that their son slept
through the night in his own bedroom. This is the reward for this type
of investigator. Along the way there is data collected for the research
field but people come first. This is the type of person that goes into
private homes to do investigations for people who are more than just curious
about what is going on in the home.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;I implore all persons and groups
that fall into the first two categories only to please refer cases in homes
to other groups/persons who are put the residents first. There are groups
and individuals that are in this 3rd category all over the country and
world. If you are not going to refer the cases to others then please stay
away. I have gone into homes where the people reached out to the first
group they found only to have someone come in, take some photos and video,
and tell them "yep, you have 12 ghosts" and then leave. One case I had
recently was this exact situation and the residents wound up calling my
group on our emergency phone number at 1am hysterical because they were
more scared now that they had "professionals" tell them that there were
12 ghost in their home earlier in the evening. Please, think about the
consequences of&nbsp; what you do in this field and remember, when dealing
with private homes, you get to leave but the residents have to stay and
spend the rest of the night there with your words and actions ringing in
their ears.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">You have more to fear from the living
than from the dead.</font></b>
