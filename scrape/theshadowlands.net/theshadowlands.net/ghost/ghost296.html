<p><b>Ghosts at the Retreat</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Chad_Vauxfin@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>We we're having this retreat for graduating students every year.
We sleep in a dorm for one night. On the night we we're sleeping there
we had many strange experiences:</b>
<br><b>1.. We could hear children playing out side the dorm but we're the
only ones in there with the nuns and our teachers.</b>
<br><b>2.. The electricfan of me and my room mate turned off while we were
sleeping. But there was no way our body parts accidentaly hit the switch
because it was far from us and our door was locked from the inside that's
why no one could enter.</b>
<br><b>3.. The group before us experienced the same as #1 and, in addition,
on the ventilation of their doors they saw walking shadows (see it's pure
shadow, there was not a feet or anything) and the toilet flushed by themselves
one by one.</b>
<br><b>People said that many died here during one of the World Wars. They
seek for freedom continously.</b><b></b>

<p><b>There sits a bunch of fairy ornaments on two hanging plants. Also
some on plants on countertop.One afternoon as all was quiet I happen to
hear a small crash in the kitchen. I ran from my room to see one of the
ornaments that resembles myself as a child lying in the drain with its
wings broken off. The thing is, is that this ornament was lodged between
two plants on the counter and the hanging plant above it is so long that
it would have stopped its path of flight. It actually had to JUMP off and
UP to be tossed into the drain. Two or so days later the fairy ornament
hanging above on the long hanging plant also is Dropped from the plant
into the drain. I was in my room when I heard the crash and said oh oh
not again. This time the fairy was broken in three. She is the one that
resembles my sister who hates me and she has three young children?</b>

<br><b>My True Ghost Story With History Link</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SEELACHANCE@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Do you believe in ghosts?&nbsp;&nbsp; I use to be like many of you.&nbsp;
I was a true skeptic.&nbsp; A true disbeliever.&nbsp; That was me until
three years ago.&nbsp; Now I do believe.&nbsp; I wish I didn’t.&nbsp; It
would be easier for me to sleep at night.&nbsp; Even now, three years later,
I am still woke up in the night by the memory of the screaming man, the
child in pain, and the dark ghostly image that turned my world upside down
and changed my beliefs forever.&nbsp; I do believe in ghosts.</b>
<br><b>It was in May 2001.&nbsp; I needed desperately to find a place for
myself and three children to live.&nbsp; Our lease was up at the apartment
where we had lived for two years.&nbsp; I was a single father, and I was
about to find myself and my children homeless.&nbsp; Like many, I had answered
just about every ad in the newspaper for rentals.&nbsp; One evening I received
a call from this woman telling me about this house.&nbsp; She said it was
a rather large old house that was in very good shape.&nbsp; She invited
me to an open house&nbsp; which was to be held that coming Sunday.&nbsp;
Sunday rolled around .&nbsp; You can’t imagine the surprise when my daughter
and I rolled up in front of this large old white house.&nbsp; We walked
in.&nbsp; The smell of cookies baking hit us immediately upon entering
through the front door.&nbsp; To our surprise we were standing in a living
room with cherubs surrounding the top of the walls all the way around the
room.&nbsp; All of the original wood work was intact and a large wooden
pole ran to the ceiling causing a divider which would later find out separated
the living room from the family room.&nbsp; The house had two floors.&nbsp;
Three bedrooms.&nbsp; A large family kitchen with a mud room that lead
to the back door.&nbsp; The upstairs bedrooms had a breezeway that could
be accessed from either room.&nbsp; The basement had an old butchers shower
and a fruit cellar.&nbsp; It was more house than we ever imagined for the
price and immediately made up our minds that we had to have it.&nbsp; Anyone
who has lived in an apartment for two years with three children would understand
our desperation.&nbsp; We had to have this house.&nbsp; We spoke with the
landlady and she gave us an application to fill out.&nbsp; There were many
people there looking at the house so we knew we would have to compete to
be its tenants.&nbsp; I handed my application to the landlady.&nbsp; "You
understand the responsibility that comes with living in an old house such
as this?" she asked.&nbsp; "Oh, yes&nbsp; I understand .&nbsp; It’s beautiful.",
I quickly replied not really understanding to what I was agreeing to.&nbsp;
"Well then I will get back to you." she quickly retorted and was off to
peddle her wares to another of the visiting house hunters.&nbsp; She was
a strange old lady and the way she showed the house wasn’t in a real estate
type manner.&nbsp; She showed the house as if she were showing a museum.&nbsp;
We had felt like we were on one of the house tours often given each year
for charity.</b>
<br><b>A week went by.&nbsp; The phone rang one evening.&nbsp; It was the
strange landlady overly excited to tell me that she had selected myself,
my daughter and two sons to live in the old house.&nbsp; I was to meet
her that following day&nbsp; at a restaurant not far from my work to settle
all of the paperwork and payment.&nbsp; I thought this was&nbsp; a little
strange and I was a little disappointed because I couldn’t wait to see
the house that would now become our home.&nbsp;&nbsp; The papers were signed
just has planned on the following day.&nbsp; And we were all set to move
in at the end of that week which was Memorial weekend.</b>
<br><b>It seemed like years before Friday came that week, but we were finally
here.&nbsp; Moving day.&nbsp; The move was your normal move and before
we knew it all of our belongings&nbsp; were hidden safely inside the old
white house.&nbsp; I was removing the last few items from the moving truck
when a car slowed way down&nbsp; almost stopping&nbsp; in front of&nbsp;
our new home.&nbsp; The passenger&nbsp; said from the window of the slow
moving car, " Hope you get along&nbsp; okay here," and then sped up and
drove away.&nbsp; "What do you think of that dad," my daughter slightly&nbsp;
puzzled asked.&nbsp; "Friendly neighbors I suppose,"&nbsp; I replied as
I shut the&nbsp; sliding door to the truck.</b>
<br><b>The first night in the house went by without much fanfare.&nbsp;
Maybe because we were so tired from the move or maybe because the house
wanted to draw us in a little closer before beginning its series of attacks
and assaults upon myself and my family.&nbsp; The next morning started
like most any other day.&nbsp; Except I did notice one strange thing about
the house.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the houses interior doors had an old fashioned
hook and eye latch, but not on the inside of each rooms doors to keep someone
out.&nbsp; The latches were on the outside of&nbsp; the rooms doors as
if to keep something in.&nbsp; "What is it dad?" my youngest son asked
from behind.&nbsp; "Oh nothing." I replied and went about the business
of unpacking our things.</b>
<br><b>The first incident happened in the living room.&nbsp; I was hanging&nbsp;
a large picture of two angels.&nbsp; My daughter thought that this would
compliment the cherubs that surrounded the room.&nbsp; I hung the picture
and turned to walk away.&nbsp; Crash.&nbsp; I turned to see that the&nbsp;
picture had fallen to the floor.&nbsp; I hung the picture once again.&nbsp;
Turned away.&nbsp; Crash.&nbsp; The picture on the floor.&nbsp; I hung
it once again.&nbsp; This time when I turned and started walking away I
felt a rush of air and something hit the back of my ankles.&nbsp; "What
the hell…"&nbsp; I turned to see the picture laying at my feet.&nbsp; More
determined than ever I hung the picture again.&nbsp; This stately loudly,&nbsp;
"Stay there dammit."&nbsp; I had to laugh because I was alone.&nbsp; Who
did I think I was talking to.&nbsp; The kids were playing on the front
porch.</b>
<br><b>"Dad come and see this," my daughters voice rang&nbsp; through the
front door.&nbsp; I stepped out onto the porch.&nbsp; "Sit down and watch
this." she said excitedly.&nbsp; "Watch&nbsp; what?"&nbsp; No sooner than
the words came out of my mouth&nbsp; my daughter pointed to a n old man
walking down the sidewalk toward our house.&nbsp; But when he reached our
property line he quickly crossed the street&nbsp; and continued his walk
on the opposite sidewalk. "They don’t like walking in front of our house
dad.&nbsp; Isn’t that weird?" my daughter still breathless with excitement
stated.&nbsp; And&nbsp; right she was.&nbsp; I sat on that porch for a
good three hours watching our neighbors cross the street away from our
house on their walks.&nbsp; A couple of times I motioned as if to say hello
and they just dropped their heads and continued on their way, but this
time a little faster.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe they are uncomfortable with new
neighbors?"&nbsp; I rationalized trying to make sense out of the senseless.&nbsp;
We went inside for dinner and the rest of the night went normally without
incident.</b>
<br><b>Sunday.&nbsp; The kids came home from church excited because we
had set aside the whole day&nbsp; to work on our yard.&nbsp; This was a
big deal for us because the only&nbsp; outside our apartment that we could
call ours had been a front balcony.&nbsp; We mowed the grass.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Cleaned out&nbsp; the leaves from under the porch and in the front yard.&nbsp;
Strangely enough the trees seemed to be shedding their as if it were fall.&nbsp;
Strange tree behavior I thought and made a mental note to mention it to
the landlady when I talked with her next.&nbsp; I asked my youngest son
to go inside and bring out the garden hose that was in the basement so
we could clean off the walkways and was down the weathered white of the
house.&nbsp; A few moments passed when I heard him screaming from inside
the house.&nbsp; I ran in frantically to find him.&nbsp; He was standing
in the middle of the kitchen&nbsp; shaking.&nbsp; Standing in a puddle
of&nbsp; urine.&nbsp; "What’s wrong?&nbsp; What&nbsp; happened?"&nbsp;
Looking at me with the scared eyes of a child, "Something chased me up
the basement steps."&nbsp; "What chased you?" I asked already thinking
the over active imagination of a little boy was at play here.&nbsp; " I
don’t know daddy, but it was big."&nbsp; Me and my other two children checked
the basement, but found nothing except for the garden hose that had been
dropped on the scared run.&nbsp; "Let’s get you cleaned up."&nbsp; Of course
there was teasing from my other two children about the proverbial basement
monster.&nbsp; "Better watch out when you go into the basement because…"&nbsp;
The glare of my eye finished my middle boys sentence.&nbsp; The rest of
Sunday and Monday went without anymore incident.&nbsp; We were so happy
those first&nbsp; few days in the house.&nbsp; My daughter was making plans
about gardens, decorating , and my boys thought it would be easy to just
walk to their baseball games because the park was just right over there.&nbsp;
A normal time which didn’t last for long.</b>
<br><b>Monday came.&nbsp; The last week of school for my kids and a long
week of work for me.&nbsp; Each day we would leave the house.&nbsp; Each
night we would come home to find every light in the house turned on.&nbsp;
And each night I would blame the children for turning on every light in
the house before leaving that morning.&nbsp; On Friday my daughter and
I sent the boys to the car&nbsp; while we purposely&nbsp; toured the house
looking for any forgotten light.&nbsp; All lights off.&nbsp; That night
we returned home to again find every light burning.&nbsp; I walked into
the house that night a little shaken.&nbsp; I had no logical reason for
all of the lights being on other than that there was someone in our house.&nbsp;
I searched the house in a panic, but found&nbsp; nothing or&nbsp; no one.&nbsp;
"Daddy, its cold in here." my daughter stated from the living room.&nbsp;
What was she talking about?&nbsp; Sweat was pouring&nbsp; down my back
and across my brow.&nbsp; I stepped into the living room.&nbsp; The temperature
dropped what seemed a good thirty degrees.&nbsp; And that was the first
time I felt its presence.&nbsp; I can’t describe it to anymore than an
electrical current running through my body that brought tears to my eyes
and bumps to my arms.&nbsp; It passed quickly.&nbsp; I remember thinking,
"What the hell was that?"&nbsp; "Daddy its getting warm in here." And sure
enough the temperature was rising as I watched the thermostat climb.&nbsp;
That night my children slept with me.&nbsp; What little sleep I got.</b>
<br><b>Sunday night.&nbsp; We were sitting in the living room talking.&nbsp;
The kids had their backs to the living room which I am still thankful for.&nbsp;
Because the memory of what was to happen still haunts my dreams to this
day.&nbsp; I was getting ready to take a trip the following morning to
Indianapolis for work.&nbsp; We were discussing the plans that had been
made for the children’s stay at Grandma’s.&nbsp; I noticed it first out
of the corner of my eye .&nbsp; A quick glance.&nbsp; Something moving,
standing at the kitchen doorway that led into the family room.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Not something some one.&nbsp; I looked toward it again.&nbsp; It was a
dark figure of a man even though there was full light.&nbsp; He was solid
in form except there was a moving, churning&nbsp; of what appeared to be
dark gray, black smoke or mist that made up his form.&nbsp; I looked down
because I was sure I wasn’t seeing this.&nbsp; My eyes were playing tricks
on me.&nbsp; I was sure that when I looked up again that it would be gone.&nbsp;
One or two good rationalizations and&nbsp; we could go on with our lives
without incident.&nbsp; A few moments passed.&nbsp; I looked up again.&nbsp;
He was still there.&nbsp; And he began to move.&nbsp; He moved into the
family room pausing in the center of the room his form still a mass of
churning turning&nbsp; blackness.&nbsp; He stood there for what seemed
an eternity, but in actuality it was only a few moments and then he&nbsp;
melted into the air.&nbsp; Gone.&nbsp; I remember&nbsp; the thoughts that
were racing through my head.&nbsp; " I have two choices.&nbsp; We could
run out of the house screaming&nbsp; into the night like those crazies
you always see in the movies.&nbsp; You know the ones that are always based&nbsp;
on fact. Or, the other choice, we cold get up quietly leave the house and
figure all of this out."&nbsp; My hand was shaking uncontrollably.&nbsp;
" That’s what we’ll do.&nbsp; We will go quietly, orderly, as if nothing
was wrong. "&nbsp; I stood up shakily.&nbsp; And in my nicest, calmest
daddy voice I said, "Let’s go get a soda&nbsp; and see grandma. "&nbsp;
My youngest instantly excited at the prospect of a soda&nbsp; before bed&nbsp;
and the older two looking at me as if I lost my mind.&nbsp; "Come on guys
it will be fun."&nbsp; Thank God my car keys were on the coffee table in
front of us.&nbsp; We moved orderly out the front door.&nbsp; I turned
to lock the door when a loud painful scream of a man came up from inside
the house.&nbsp; A man voice screaming in pain.&nbsp; So loud that it could
be heard through out the neighborhood and the neighbors dogs began to bark.&nbsp;
To hell with orderly.&nbsp; "Get in the car!" I screamed at my children.&nbsp;
We were on a dead run now.&nbsp; The drive to my Mom’s house is still a
blur to this day.&nbsp; I was in a panic and I knew that we had to get
away from the old white house.&nbsp; I do remember as we were driving away
my youngest son very scared now saying, "Daddy the basement monster is
standing in the upstairs window."&nbsp; I looked back and sure enough the
black form was there standing in the window watching us leave.</b>
<br><b>That night we stayed at my parents house.&nbsp; Early the next day,
I gathered my things and left for my business trip.&nbsp; I had a whole
week of rationalizations by the time I returned home to get my kids.&nbsp;
Where else were we to go?&nbsp; I had put everything I had saved and then
some into the move.&nbsp; We had to go back to the big&nbsp; old white
house.&nbsp; What else were we to do?&nbsp; Besides, after a week of talking
myself out of the events of that night I was ready to return.&nbsp; So
on Friday night we returned to the house.&nbsp; The weekend went by without&nbsp;
incident and very little sleep.&nbsp; I was taking another extended weekend&nbsp;
to make up to my kids for my week away.&nbsp; On Saturday we explored the
big shed at the back of the yard and in it we found all of these different
peoples personal belongings.&nbsp; My parents convinced me that maybe it
wouldn’t be such a bad idea to call the strange old landlady and ask her
some straight forward questions about the house.&nbsp; The most awkward
phone call of my life and the strangest.&nbsp; Once I was able to reach
her I asked in my most normal of voices and&nbsp; my most careful choice
of words if she had known of any of the previous tenants mentioning perhaps
a ghost.&nbsp; Well of course she said at first not that she could remember.&nbsp;
Then there was this one tenant.&nbsp; A girl.&nbsp; Who claimed that her
dead father came to visit her, but the old woman always thought she was
crazy.&nbsp; Some of the stuff in the shed that girl had left behind, but
she couldn’t get her to come pick it up.&nbsp; The other stuff in the shed
belonged to this guy that had&nbsp; lived there and had left in the middle
of the night leaving behind his things.&nbsp; But, no she had never heard
of anyone talking about the house being haunted.&nbsp; I asked here how
long ago did these people live there?&nbsp; And she said, "Not much more
than a year honey, why do you ask?"&nbsp; The phone call wasn’t of much
help.&nbsp; And it didn’t calm my fears much, but what else could I do?</b>
<br><b>The rest of the long weekend came and went.&nbsp; I actually had
convinced&nbsp; myself that it was just a one time ordeal because nothing
was happening now.&nbsp; That was until Monday night.&nbsp; I was on the
phone with my mom.&nbsp; The kids were off playing in my bedroom which
was also located on the first floor.&nbsp; While talking to my Mom, I heard
the doors rattle.&nbsp; Not the outside doors, but the inside doors of
the house.&nbsp; I listened.&nbsp; They rattled again.&nbsp; I yelled at
the kids to quit playing games.&nbsp; I told my Mom that everything was
okay just the kids playing tricks.&nbsp; The rattled again, this time harder.&nbsp;
So , I scolded the children this time louder to behave and stop playing
tricks.&nbsp; At this time they rattled louder, but before I could scold
my daughters scared voice cut me off.&nbsp; "Daddy, I’m in here reading
and my brothers are asleep."&nbsp; Now I will try to recreate what happens
next to the best of memory.&nbsp; Some of it I remember clearly.&nbsp;
Other parts are still to this day a blur.&nbsp; Just has soon as I heard
my daughter the temperature in the house dropped a good thirty degrees.&nbsp;
Instantly.&nbsp; With it that electrical charged feeling running through
my body.&nbsp; Along with its energy a horrible stench that I can’t&nbsp;
goes beyond description.&nbsp; And then the screaming started softly at
first, but building in momentum.&nbsp; I screamed through the phone at
my mother to come help we were getting out.&nbsp; The whole house at this
time began to shake and come alive.&nbsp; From the above I could hear something
large coming down the stairs.&nbsp; Boom.&nbsp; Boom!&nbsp; BOOM!&nbsp;
The screaming of the man over and over.&nbsp; The screaming of my daughter,
"Daddy what is happening!"&nbsp; And the thought that one of my two bedroom
doors connected to the stairs.&nbsp; BOOM!&nbsp; BOOM!&nbsp; It was coming
down those stairs!&nbsp; I had to get to my children!&nbsp; The whole house
was alive with noise.&nbsp; The floor beneath me was shaking as I made
my way to opposite bedroom door.&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt something behind me
and I knew I didn’t want to turnaround to see it.&nbsp; BOOM!&nbsp; SCREAMING!
A new scream mixed into the mans scream this one of a child.&nbsp; BOOM!&nbsp;
SCREAMS!&nbsp; BOOM!&nbsp; I make it to my bedroom door.&nbsp; It won’t
open.&nbsp; By this time I am screaming myself.&nbsp; Throwing myself against
the door.&nbsp; It won’t open.&nbsp; Throwing myself against the door again
and again…it finally slams open.&nbsp;&nbsp; My daughter is in shock by
this point.&nbsp; I instruct my middle son to grab his brother and run
out the front door and head for the car.&nbsp; BOOM!&nbsp; BOOM! SCREAMS!&nbsp;
My daughter won’t move.&nbsp; I finally slap her to bring her to life.&nbsp;
She responds and I grab her and head for the door as&nbsp; I hear the other
bedroom door slam open behind us.&nbsp; I was on our trail and I new I
couldn’t let it reach us.&nbsp; The whole house still shaking and alive
with noise&nbsp; and something big on our heels.&nbsp; We reach the front
door and out onto the porch.&nbsp; I slam the front door behind us.&nbsp;
We get to the car noise still coming from the house.&nbsp; I drive away
and park at the top of the street where I can look into the house and wait
for my parents to arrive.&nbsp; While there my children and I see it searching
through the house.&nbsp; Searching!&nbsp; Searching for us!&nbsp; It’s
blackness moving from room to room methodically.</b>
<br><b>That was our last night in the house.&nbsp; My children never returned.&nbsp;
I returned to get a few of our things when needed and everyone I brought
into that house with me would witness something happen .&nbsp; A scream.&nbsp;
Whispers.&nbsp; Pounding from the floor above.&nbsp; It was not selective
anymore at who it let hear its fury.&nbsp; About a year ago, someone I
know saw a police car race up to that house one night and saw a family
running out of its front door&nbsp; in their night clothes.&nbsp; I remember
what the old lady said to me as I turned over the key.&nbsp; Standing there,&nbsp;
the whole side of my arm and torso still bruised from throwing myself against
that bedroom door.&nbsp; "Some people are meant to live in an old house
like that.&nbsp; And some people aren’t.&nbsp; I never thought you were
the old house type."&nbsp; And I guess she was right.</b>
<br><b>About a month after moving out of the old house a friend sent me
a web site address that she wanted me desperately to see, " Put John T.
Crowe, Union, Missouri into your search engine."&nbsp; I did.&nbsp; The
face of a man came onto my screen.&nbsp; The same face that showed up in
a picture my brother took in the fruit cellar one afternoon while I was
packing for the move.&nbsp; The man was famous. The land itself famous,
with a history dating back to the civil war.&nbsp; Go there.&nbsp; See
for yourself.&nbsp; As for the house.&nbsp; The old lady turned it into
a dog kennel this past fall.&nbsp; I guess she ran out of people that could
live in a old white house like that one.</b>
<br><b>You see I do believe in ghosts.&nbsp; I still drive past that house
every once in awhile and when I get enough nerve I look up at the upstairs
window and it there.&nbsp; Watching.&nbsp; Waiting.&nbsp; Angry.&nbsp;
Sometimes its screams still wake me from my sleep.&nbsp; Its infectious
scream creeping into my dreams turning them into nightmares.&nbsp; I still
don’t sleep very well.&nbsp; In my dreams I see a faceless man standing
in that basement washing away blood from his naked blood covered body.&nbsp;
Grunting.&nbsp; Panting.&nbsp; Breathing.&nbsp; The breathing you’d hear
when you were alone with it in a room. The breathing you would hear when
you knew it was there.&nbsp; Heavy.&nbsp; Labored. Breathing.&nbsp; Yes,
I do believe in ghosts.&nbsp; I do believe in ghosts.&nbsp; And maybe you
should too?</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My story takes place at my house. Of coures
all</b>
<br><b>stories like this usually take place at home.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm home alone, to many people, it was
a</b>
<br><b>beautiful day. I have a bookshelf with five shelves on</b>
<br><b>it. At the bottom was my soccerball, I have no idea</b>
<br><b>why it was there in the first place. The bookshelves</b>
<br><b>were by my closet. Both my closte doors were closed. I</b>
<br><b>hear something outside. I run outside to see that it</b>
<br><b>was just people closing there car doors. So I go back</b>
<br><b>in. I go in the direction of my room. When I get to my</b>
<br><b>door , it's closed with the soccerball on the outside</b>

<br><b>found that both my closet doors were wide open.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I know what your probably thinking.
What if</b>
<br><b>someone came through the back door and thought they</b>

<p><b>My Old School</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Aadelyn8@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>When i was in the fifth grade , i used to stay with this progran
after school with a bunch of other kids thats parents used to get out of
work late. Well, one day while me and my two best friends were the only
ones left to get picked up. We were playing a game in the library with
the teacher when the janitor ran in. She said that while she was sweeping
she could have sworn that she saw a lady in a wedding gown with long black
hair standing in the middle of the hall. She was so scared that she just
stood still watching the lady. The lady started walking towards her then
suddenly disappeared. After hearing that story my friend and i got hungry
and asked if we could go to the teachers lounge and buy some chips. The
teacher said yes so we went. When we got there ,we saw plates, forks, and
spoons all over the floor. The chairs were all moved around and it was
just a complete mess. We got our chips and went back to the library. The
janitor was still there and we told her about the mess. She thought we
were kidding aroun and said ''But i just cleaned the lounge and were the
only ones in the school''. We told her to go look for herself and so she
did. When she came back she was all freaked out. The next day after school
again our teacher told us that at 4:00am when she came to school the security
and her were the only ones there at school. As she was about to open the
library the security went up to her and asked her if she'd been in the
2nd through 3rd grade hall. She said no and asked why he'd ask. He said
that while he was opening one of the classrooms something was thrown at
him. When he turned to see what it was there&nbsp; was a Coca-Cola bottle
on the floor. They say that the school was built over a really old cemetary.
But we still dont know what was haunting the school.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Morning of Tragedy</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: gnjolicoeur@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>During the month of September 2001 I was going through very depressing
time. I awoke with eyes wet with tears and the faint reminder of death
and escape. When I brought my children to school I returned home and turned
on the radio, only to hear about the towers. I immediately remembered the
dream that I had that morning. In the dream I see peoples spirits like
mists asking for help to escape dark smoke. I led them down theese ducts
in the walls. Down and out of the building.The sorrow was overwhelming.</b>

<br><b>Insane?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: elvishlady@bellsouth.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My family and I moved into our house about 5 years ago I was 7, I
am fourteen now and have some strange stories. Is happened about a year
ago. I was in my room reading like I have always loved to do. I really
don’t know what made me look to my bedroom door witch was open. Well what
I saw scared me big time. Ok in my house we always leave a light on in
the kitchen but that night it was burnt out. Well when I looked at the
door that was something standing there. It was Tall, at first I thought
it was my dad but my dad may be tall but nowhere near as tall the thing
that was there. To say the lest I was scared out of my mind but I didn’t
scream it was like my voice was going and it was cold ice cold. I watch
the thing move to the bathroom and I heard the door shut and the light
switched on. I waited and then move out of my room to my sister’s room.
I woke her up and she opened the door. There was nothing there. But something
I have hated about the bathroom is the wood door. I have asked to paint
it but my mom said no. I hate it because there is a face on it. I will
get a photo one of these days. My house is small and not overly old I don’t
know what that thing was I just call it Shadow. Because I know it was a
man how I don’t know I just somehow know it was a man. I think I’ve seen
it again as well but in the day. I was getting something from my room witch
I now share with my sister and I looked into the mirror and there was a
man in it. My mom has seen it as well though she was not to sure about
it. They all think I am insane. I wonder that myself</b>

<p><b>I had been collecting fairy figurines and reading about the topic,
when family problems were about to erupt. The figurine I had recently acquired
had its thumb broken off in the cabinet for no apparent reason. I searched
the box it arrived in, the cabinet shelves and the floor ? No resin thumb
anywhere? Yet it had been there when it arrived. Saturday morning following
I received a phone call from a visiting sister who informed me that on
Friday afternoon my brother inlaw had cut off his thumb with a saw while
renovating.I remodeled a thumb for the fairy out of papermacher and glued
and painted it in place. The following day I called and found out that
the brother in laws thumb was a total loss but the neighboring fingers
were saved.</b>

<p><b>One night I was sleeping soundly on my living room sofa when the
side door&nbsp; flew violently open! I ran off the sofa from a lying position
with my heart in my mouth. I did not wait to look outside, instead slammed
and relocked the door shut. Swore and went to sleep in my room. Four nights
passed on a Sturday morning myself and my spouse awoke at exactly 5AM!
We both could not pinpoint the reason for being so fully awake. We sat
at our kitchen table when suddenly he spots a rolling Ecto Mist of a woman
with wispy like limbs at the side door! He says who or what is that?I then
related the prior incident.</b>

<p><b>Here's a True One</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Tigershark124@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Back in 1998 I worked as a Security Patrol Officer for Pacific Security
(then a family owned business worth working for)</b>
<br><b>By this time, I have worked Security for some 10 years in 2 states.</b>
<br><b>I was assigned to the Sergeant who was in charge of Site Guards,
though my primary position was Security Patrol.</b>
<br><b>When the SGT. went on vacation, I was pulled from patrol duty to
cover is shift at a somewhat person sensitive site in North Seattle, Vencor
Critical Care Clinic/Hospital.</b>
<br><b>It's just North of North Gate Mall.</b>
<br><b>I would work from 23:00 Hrs to 7:00 Hrs, and had the keys to most
of the rooms in the hospital, including the kitchen. In fact, I had the
only key to the kitchen between the hours of 18:00 and 08:00 when the Administrative
people came in.</b>
<br><b>On more then one night, while making rounds, I would notice either
movement in the kitchen, or a light would be on that was not an hour before.</b>
<br><b>One night, while checking out the kitchen, I observed a frying pan
swinging (just slightly) back and forth on its hook, just as I reached
out to stop it, it flew off its hook, hitting me in the face.</b>
<br><b>It was several weeks before I would reenter the kitchen, as I was
posted there on a temporary weekend basis on top of my patrol duties.</b>
<br><b>There were other things that I could not explain, like the feeling
that someone would be right there, yet no one was.&nbsp; There were, on
two separate occasions, an unexplained ball of light that I saw inside
the hospital, lasting several seconds in duration, just floating in midair.
(first floor, where the patient's family/on call doctor were allowed to
stay the night over.&nbsp; Not on the same floor as the patients.)</b>
<br><b>Others that worked there had reported strange events, and two employees
absolutely refused to go into the kitchen regardless of being escorted
or not.</b>
<br><b>That place definitely has something/someone still there.</b>
<br><b>The place ceased operating as a "Critical Care Hospital" shortly
after I pulled duty there, and I no longer know what the bldg. is being
used for now.</b>

<p><b>The Old Man</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: scotwish@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was about 14 years old, the duplex apartment we were living
in had a</b>
<br><b>ghost.&nbsp; The bathroom of the apartment was midway in the hallway
between my</b>
<br><b>room and my mother and stepfather's room.&nbsp; On the wall of the
bathroom,</b>
<br><b>facing the door, was a wall length mirror, under which, was the
vanity.&nbsp; In</b>
<br><b>the morning before school, I would sit on the toilet (lid down of
course!)</b>
<br><b>in front of the vanity and use the mirror to put my make-up on (so
my back</b>
<br><b>was to the door).&nbsp; I usually left the door open, until I started
seeing this</b>
<br><b>man pass by the doorway...i could see him in the mirror.&nbsp; The
first couple</b>
<br><b>of times it happened, I assumed it was my stepfather, so I didn't
think</b>
<br><b>anything about it.&nbsp; But one day it happened when I knew my
stepfather wasn't</b>
<br><b>home.&nbsp; Thinking that he had come home and I just hadn't heard
him come in, I</b>
<br><b>got up and wandered through the apartment calling him.&nbsp; He
didn't answer,</b>
<br><b>and he was no where in the house, so I thought I was just seeing
things.</b>
<br><b>This happened several more times where I would see this tall, older</b>
<br><b>(elderly, gray hair, kinda gray-ish skin, but completely solid-looking)
man</b>
<br><b>walk past the doorway.&nbsp; He never looked at me, or into the
bathroom, he</b>
<br><b>always just walked right past the door looking straight ahead.&nbsp;
After this</b>
<br><b>happened quite a few times, I started thinking maybe it was a ghost
or a</b>
<br><b>spirit or something and it started to scare me, so I started closing
and</b>
<br><b>Locking the bathroom door every time I was in there putting on my
make-up.</b>
<br><b>I wanted to tell my mother, but at this time in my life, I was getting
up to</b>
<br><b>no good (partying, etc..) and she and I weren't getting along too
well, and</b>
<br><b>I was afraid that if I told her, she wouldn't believe me, or would
think I</b>
<br><b>was having hallucinations from drugs or something! lol&nbsp; Well,
this kept</b>
<br><b>happening the rest of the time we lived there, until we eventually
moved</b>
<br><b>out.&nbsp; But that's not the end of the story...</b>
<br><b>After I was an adult, one night me and my mother and brother were
sitting at</b>
<br><b>her house, just visiting and we started talking about ghosts and
spirits and</b>
<br><b>things.&nbsp; I spoke up and said, "well, that duplex apartment
we lived in on</b>
<br><b>So-and-so St..." and before I could finish what I was saying, my
mother's</b>
<br><b>eyes got big and she looked at me and yelled, "YOU SAW THE OLD MAN
TOO!"&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>almost passed out! lol...It turned out, that She had seen that man
walk past</b>
<br><b>the bathroom door too!!!!&nbsp; BOTH of us had seen that man, but
neither of us</b>
<br><b>had said anything to the other about it in all those years!!!&nbsp;
I told her of</b>
<br><b>course, Why I hadn't said anything about him, and she said that
she had</b>
<br><b>never said anything because she was afraid that, at that time, it
would</b>
<br><b>scare me too bad.&nbsp; It was really creepy, but neither of us
had felt anything</b>
<br><b>"evil" or bad coming from this man, he just kinda wandered the hallway,
i</b>
<br><b>guess.&nbsp; I've wondered since then, if the new people who moved
in, ever saw</b>
<br><b>him!</b>

<br><b>My Grandfather</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LRagland@ServproNet.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Several years ago, my infant daughter and I lived in a mobile home
near my Grandmother.&nbsp; The land had been in my family for years and
had been occupied by both myself, my father and my grandmother at the time
of this incident.&nbsp; I had needed to dry some laundry on the outside
clothes line.&nbsp; My daughter was sleeping soundly in her nursery so
I decided to take care of this particular task while she was napping.&nbsp;
I had made my way to the back yard area and began hanging the clothing
when I saw a man out of the corner of my eye.&nbsp; It was just for a moment
but he was very visible.&nbsp; He was a tall, dark haired man wearing a
brown and yellow&nbsp; checked coat.&nbsp; He was holding a bundle close
to his chest as he would a baby.&nbsp; In a blink of my eye, he was gone.&nbsp;
I decided that was enough laundry for the day and went immediately into
the house.&nbsp; When I stepped through the door, my daughter was crying.&nbsp;
She seemed to be fine other than a wet diaper.&nbsp; I mentioned the man
to my grandmother later and she was stunned.&nbsp; She said my grandfather
had a coat just like the one the man had on.&nbsp; There was absolutely
no way I could have known this.&nbsp; You see, my grandfather had been
struck by lightening when my dad was 11 years old and he did not speak
of him often due to the sadness it caused him.&nbsp; This particular incident
happened on the same farm were he died.&nbsp; My mother seemed to think
he was warning me that something was wrong with my daughter but I don't
know.&nbsp; It is kind of strange, as my daughter was named after him.</b>

<p><b>&nbsp;Lifetime of Occurances</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: gemini_love_ca@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>As a child, I always thought strange things happened around me.
Now that I’m an adult, I’m beginning to understand that the women in my
family have a very strong psychic ability, which has been getting stronger
through the generations.</b>
<br><b>Before I describe my experiences, I want to give some background.
From the time I was a child, I would say strange things or answer questions
that had not been asked. More than once I woke from a sound sleep and would
tell someone “don’t go to _______” only to later find out there was an
accident on the road they would take or some other accident had occurred.</b>
<br><b>For most of my life, I grew up in the house that my great-grandparents
(my Ma and Pa) had bought back in the early 50’s. This house is still in
the family and stands in Orange County, CA. For my family privacy’s sake,
I won’t give a closer description than that. I lived there off and on until
I moved out as an adult.</b>
<br><b>Although I don’t remember it, my mother says my first contact with
a ghost happened in that house when I was about three years old. I had
been put down for a nap in my Ma’s bedroom. My mom and my Ma were in the
kitchen when they heard me running down the hall calling for help.</b>
<br><b>My mother jumped up to see what was wrong. Crying, I kept telling
her it wasn’t me, but to come help “the man”. I dragged her by the hand
down the hallway and pointed to the doorway to my Ma’s room, saying “don’t
you see him lying there Mama?” After some careful questions, I was able
to tell my mother where he was laying, what he was wearing, what he looked
like, etc. I was very upset and kept telling my mother there was blood
everywhere.</b>
<br><b>(I found out when I was seventeen that my Pa had committed suicide
in the bedroom and had fallen partially into the hallway where I had pointed.)</b>
<br><b>At the age of seven, I used to sleep in that same room. Often, I
would wake up with the feeling that I was being watched. I usually assumed
that it was my Ma checking on me as she was a terribly restless sleeper
and usually was up and down all night cleaning or puttering around. On
more than one occasion, I woke up to see what I called “the man” peering
around the doorway, watching me sleep.</b>
<br><b>I found it uncomfortable, but not scary, until I realized that I
could see him very clearly, right down to the wrinkles on his knuckles,
except that he was a pale pearly white. (I remember later seeing the movie
“The Frighteners” and thinking how accurate the ghosts had looked to me.)
I would blink a few times, tell myself I was dreaming and he would be gone.
I never mentioned it though.</b>
<br><b>At about ten, I was again laying in that bed when I heard the floor
creak as though someone were walking up the hall. Nothing unusual – again,
Ma was often up and down all night to wash dishes, etc. I felt someone
enter the room and the floor creak as the footsteps came to the side of
the bed I was asleep on. I felt something cool brush over my cheek, like
a kiss, and the footsteps retreated to the doorway. Expecting it to be
my Ma, I woke up the rest of the way and sat up in bed to ask her if I
could get up and sit with her. When I looked at the doorway, the man was
standing there, smiling, and he raised his hand to wave at me. I froze,
then finally I screamed and he disappeared.</b>
<br><b>My Ma came running down the hallway and asked me what was wrong.
I told her what I had seen and she held me and rocked me for the longest
time. Then she went to the closet and took down a box of old family photos.
She removed one and it was a younger version of her standing with the man
I had seen. She told me he was my great-grandfather, who had died in the
house eleven months before I was born. She told me it was obvious he had
come back from Heaven to watch over me and I was not to be afraid of him.</b>
<br><b>After that, I often saw him out of the corner of my eye, or heard
him wandering the house. When it got too frightening for me, my Ma would
stand in the hallway with her hands on her hips and say “Howard! You stop
it this instant and stop scaring that baby!” and it would stop and stay
quiet for weeks or months. Often in that time period, things would go missing
and would not come back unless you asked him to return them and then left
the room. I can’t recall how many times I had to ask for my homework back,
only to leave the kitchen and have it appear sitting on the table as if
it had been there the whole time.</b>
<br><b>Oddly, the mirror on the door at the end of the hall had a set of
3 fingerprints in the corner that were imbedded in the silver backing.
The wall and ceiling in the master bedroom had a dark, spattery pattern
that would not go away no matter how much we scrubbed. That spot in the
hallway was always cold, and people who had never been over before would
often remark on how odd it was that it was the only spot in the house that
was so cold – any day of the year.</b>
<br><b>I was thirteen when my grandfather, my Papaw, died. I had often
been shuttled between he and my Nana’s (my grandmother’s) house and my
Ma’s growing up. He passed suddenly and I was very angry with him for dying.
My mother and I were being abused by her (now) ex-husband and I felt like
my Papaw had left me in Hell, unprotected from all the emotional abuse
I was going through.</b>
<br><b>After two weeks of being bullied after my Papaw died, I decided
I’d had enough and was going to kill myself. The strain I was under was
so heavy that I had lost 15 pounds, my hair was falling out, I was developing
an ulcer, I couldn’t sleep at night, I was passing out at school…. I waited
for a few weeks until I had a day home from school for a teacher’s conference.
I lied and said school was in session and snuck home after my mom and her
ex left for work.</b>
<br><b>I was in the bathroom ready to take the pills I had stolen from
her husband’s bottle of Valium, the razor on the counter and the bathtub
full of hot water. I undressed and was raising the first of the pills to
my mouth when I heard my Papaw’s voice in my ear as plain as day.</b>
<br><b>“What in the hell do you think you’re doing? Look at yourself. Do
you honestly think I would want you to die just to join me? And how do
you think your mother would feel, coming home to find her only child like
that. How could you even think of leaving her like that? I trusted you
to keep her sane till she leaves that asshole. Now get yourself together.
Go take a shower and wash your hair. Go make yourself some soup before
you fall down. If you throw up, clean it up and eat again. I don’t want
to see you on this side for a long time.”</b>
<br><b>I stood there crying and shaking for the longest time. I could feel
how angry he was at me for hurting myself like this and I knew he was disappointed
in me. I did what he said and put the pills and razor back where I had
gotten them. I never told anyone what I had heard. I was too embarrassed
that I had gotten so low and I was afraid that I’d end up in a hospital
or something.</b>
<br><b>When I was fifteen, my mother divorced her ex and we moved back
to my Ma’s house to help take care of her. I came down with pneumonia and
was bedridden for about three months. My Nana came down from her house
in Ventura to sit with me as my Ma was in the hospital for the final time.</b>
<br><b>Several times, I would be laying in bed, hear the floor creak as
someone walked over to my bed (which had been placed in the living room
so I could watch TV), feel the side of the bed dip as someone sat down
and feel fingers stroke my hair comfortingly. I would open my eyes, expecting
to see my Nana and she would be asleep in the chair about six feet away.
I would look down and the bed would still have a dip in it as if someone
larger than me was sitting on the edge.</b>
<br><b>I eventually recovered and my Nana went home. My Ma was still in
the hospital and I was just starting back to school. My mother and I had
planned to go visit her since the nurses said she didn’t have much longer
and she had been asking for us in her more lucid moments. We were getting
ready to go and were standing in the living room getting the last minute-purse-keys-etc.
together.</b>
<br><b>Suddenly, the screen door at the front of the house opened and then
the front door. Both slammed shut again. We heard a set of heavy footprints
go into the hall and through the kitchen. Then the back door and back screen
opened and slammed shut. My mother and I, being used to this by now, looked
at each other and said “Pa’s mad….”</b>
<br><b>We watched as all the kitchen cabinets swung open. My mother went
in and shut them. When she turned around, the chair at the kitchen table
had been pushed up against her legs and she tripped over it. She yelled
at me, thinking I had done it, and then pushed it back to the table. As
she pushed the chair in, the cabinet swung open again slowly, the corner
of the door almost in her hair.</b>
<br><b>She spent almost fifteen minutes alternately pushing the chair to
the table and shutting the cabinets as I stood in the living room crying.
He had never acted like this before. Finally, my mother was in tears and
she started yelling at him that he was scaring her and called herself by
his childhood nickname for her. It instantly stopped and we both felt like
the house had just emptied of all warmth. We both said “oh no” at the same
time and ran for the door. I remember looking at the clock as we left and
noting the time. We got to the hospital and my mom left me in the waiting
room at the end of the ward. Having been sick recently, I wasn’t allowed
into the patient area. After a few minutes, my mom walked back, and her
steps were really slow. She said “we’re too late,” and I knew she had passed
away. According to the nurses, the time she passed was the same time the
house went silent.</b>
<br><b>I swear to this day he was angry with us for leaving her alone in
that hospital room to die and was trying to get us to leave to go see her.</b>
<br><b>The house was silent for several years after that, and I moved to
Arizona at age eighteen with my ex-husband (who was my fianc&eacute; at
the time). We were living in our apartment in Arizona when my ex woke in
the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and yelled that someone was
in the house. He dashed into the living room and no one was there. I asked
him what he had seen and he perfectly described my great-grandfather, right
down to the red checked wool shirt he always wore. I laughed and said “Oh
that’s Pa. Next time say hi.” He thought I was delusional until we came
back to California on a trip and saw his picture in a box of family photos.</b>
<br><b>Things again started to disappear and reappear in strange places
in the apartment. More than once I would find my wallet or house keys in
the freezer, even though I know I had left them on the pegboard in the
kitchen. I was talking to my mother one day and she remarked how silent
the house was. I laughed and said, “That’s because Pa is here.” My mother
went deadly silent and she said, “What did you take from the house? He
can’t leave unless you took something that was his with you.”</b>
<br><b>I tore the house apart and found nothing. I called her back and
told her so. She said “He must be attached to you then.” She went silent
again and said, “Oh boy, I guess we have a commuter ghost.” I asked why
and she said, “Because he just stomped down the hall and slammed the bedroom
door. I don’t think he likes us laughing at him.”</b>
<br><b>I moved a couple of times after that and each time, he would show
up in the new apartment, usually after everything was unpacked. It was
not uncommon to feel a cold spot in a warm room, have the cat hiss and
arch and stare at empty corners, feel “not alone”. We lived across town
from my mother (and the old house) at that time and I was pregnant with
my oldest son.</b>
<br><b>Our apartment was two stories and had carpeted stairs in it. As
I got pretty far along, I got incredibly clumsy and slipped on the stairs
more than once. One day I slipped again, near the top and felt a hand grasp
my ankle and my foot pushed back onto the stair behind me. I righted myself
without falling and said “thank you Pa,” and a warm breeze blew over me.</b>
<br><b>While I lived there, my landlady – a cantankerous, mean, chain-smoking
old woman, had a heart attack in the office below my apartment. She had
never liked me while I lived there, mostly because I was always in her
office demanding repairs. I was bathing my son in the tub one day and saw
a dark gray shadow form in the corner near the mirror. All of a sudden
the electric space heater I had on the counter (to keep it dry) flew off
and hit the side of the tub with a loud thump and fell to the floor. All
around me was the heavy stink of cigarette smoke.</b>
<br><b>I panicked and yanked my son’s bath seat off the tub bottom and
ran out of the room, staying downstairs until my ex got home from work.
When I told him what happened, he dropped the briefcase he was carrying
and sat down with a thump. He looked at me and was pale as a sheet. “Did
you know Geraldine died last night?” meaning the landlady. I got so upset
I nearly threw up on the spot. It was my only encounter with a malevolent
spirit and I pray I never have another.</b>
<br><b>After that was a long period of quiet, with the occasional thump
or bump in the night. However, any time I would go visit my mother at “the
old house”, things would happen. One evening, my stepfather was lying on
the couch when he started to shiver and complain it was freezing in the
house.</b>
<br><b>It was July and the house had (still has) no air conditioning. My
mom and I were both in shorts and tank tops and still sweating. We both
looked at each other and it was unspoken “he’s back”. We both walked over
to the couch and ran our hands in the air about chest high along where
my stepfather was laying. Sure enough, right around his head was a cold
spot. I ran my hands along the cold spot and it was about six feet high
and 18 inches across.</b>
<br><b>My mother swallowed hard and her voice shook. “Sit up and move over
there,” she told my stepfather. He thought we were both nuts, but sat up
and moved to the other end of the couch. I felt again and the cold spot
had seemed to move. I asked my mom to feel it and she confirmed. The once
six foot high spot next to the couch was now 3 feet high and directly over
the cushions. My mom stumbled back to her chair and sat down with a thump.</b>
<br><b>I stood there and blinked a few times then started to giggle insanely.
My stepfather was like “What the hell is wrong with you both?”</b>
<br><b>I finally stopped giggling and pointed to the cold spot. “Pa wanted
to watch TV with you and he was mad at you for hogging the couch. But he
sure got you to move so he could sit down.”</b>
<br><b>Needless to say, he became a believer. After that, it got noisy
again. My stepfather’s Marine Corp uniform and cover would not stay on
hangers, his dress saber would fall off the wall for no apparent reason,
pictures he had taken on his different tours would wind up scattered on
the floor as if someone had swept them off the table. (Pa was a Navy man.
We figured it was the Navy-Marine rivalry rearing its head.)</b>
<br><b>After both my sons were born, they would often giggle and point
at empty corners, nod and smile, laugh…. And always at the same corner.
Our cat used to stare at that corner and bristle, almost daily. Eventually
the cat ran away. That corner is always dark, no matter how much light
you shine on it and I often have the feeling someone is in that corner
watching me.</b>
<br><b>Again, it’s never a malevolent feeling – more like curiosity or
bemusement.</b>
<br><b>I’ve had other experiences in town – I live in an old town that
was built during the Gold Rush days and we often hear about people seeing
things here. I worked in a fast food place in town and would often hear
children playing in the locked lobby after closing or see reflections in
the glass windows of someone standing behind me, only to turn and not see
anyone there.</b>
<br><b>The other night, the night before the eclipse, my youngest son woke
up screaming bloody murder. I sprung out of bed and ran to his room. He
came running to me and said that his room was full of colored lights, “circles
of light” he called them and they were moving his bed.</b>
<br><b>I brought him into the room with me and he was burning up with fever.
I, at first, dismissed what he saw as fever. After all, a small child with
a fever of 103&deg; can sometimes hallucinate, and a lot of small children
have nightmares. Laying in bed and holding him, I had the distinct feeling
I was not alone and my eyes kept being drawn to a spot on the wall between
our rooms.</b>
<br><b>I got both kids up and took them downstairs to watch a movie, staying
up past sunrise and then hustling everyone back to bed for a nap as my
eyes were burning. That evening, I was talking to a friend online who has
a very strong psychic sense, she asked me what was wrong. I told her what
my son had seen and she asked if she could do anything.</b>
<br><b>Having never had an experience like that in the house before, I
told her that I had always been followed around by a “guardian spirit”
and asked her if she could tell who was with me.</b>
<br><b>Immediately she said, “it’s not one, there’s four” and started to
give me details. One matched my great-grandfather, my Pa. The second, she
said, stood near him, and matched a description of my great-grandmother,
my Ma. She said the third was standing over my shoulder and went on to
give me a number of small details that matched my Papaw, my grandfather.
She said the fourth was vague because he was weak. From what details she
could give me (mainly the curly hair, kind eyes and pinky ring), I discovered
it was my ex-husband’s uncle – dead for over 5 years.</b>
<br><b>I asked her why the lights had appeared and she was silent for a
moment, and typed back. “They said they were playing with the boys, like
they used to do when they were little. They didn’t mean to scare him.”</b>
<br><b>As I was sitting there processing that information, my son tugged
on my arm and said, “I don’t want to go to bed Mommy. The lights are going
to come back.” My older son was behind him and nodded. “Yeah Mom, the lights
are scary. I thought they were aliens like in ET.” I asked them to tell
me again what they saw and I got a lot more detail the second time. They
told me that the youngest had woken up to his bed being lifted off the
ground and the walls were covered in colored circles of light. He screamed
and the older one woke up. He said he saw his brother screaming and the
lights on the walls.</b>
<br><b>The younger then piped up and said “And Mommy, four of the lights
followed me when you told me to come to you. They went in your room and
they stayed there till you carried me downstairs.” I asked him where in
my room he had seen them and it was the same spot my own eyes had been
drawn back to.</b>
<br><b>I’ve been a student of Wicca for several years and I decided that
I was definitely renewing the wards on the house that night. I had planned
to do so already, thinking that a full moon and an eclipse would be auspicious
timing, but that sealed it.</b>
<br><b>I walked through the whole house, marking the walls with symbols
drawn with water and salt. After I was done, my youngest son tearfully
refused to go to bed unless I went into his room and told the lights to
go away. My oldest son told me “make them die Mommy. We don’t want them
here.” I explained to my sons that I couldn’t and wouldn’t kill the lights,
because they weren’t trying to hurt or scare us, they just had something
they wanted us to know and it was okay.</b>
<br><b>I stood in their room and looked around and said, “Okay, I got your
message. We know who is here. Thank you for coming, I will be listening
for what you have to say. But stay out of this room, they are just babies
and they are not ready for what you have to say. All you’re doing is scaring
them and I know that’s not your intention. From now on, this room is off
limits.” After my son piped up again to do my room, I added. “And don’t
enter my room either. I am willing to listen, but I need a place to rest
peacefully at night.”</b>
<br><b>After that, my son smiled and hugged me saying that the lights had
gone. I reminded the boys that if they came again to yell and tell them
that they were just little kids and it was too scary, that they needed
to not be so rough with them. I told them that sometimes the ghosts forget
that we’re only people and we get scared when they just pop in on us like
that.</b>
<br><b>Since then, I’ve had the odd feeling of being watched, even seen
a reflection in my computer monitor of someone behind me for a moment or
two. I felt a hand brush up my leg or across my arm as I’m trying to go
to bed. I tell them if they keep it up, I will start ignoring them and
they won’t be able to make me listen anymore and it stops.</b>
<br><b>I hadn’t seen the lights during all this time, except last night.
I was laying in my bed talking on the phone to the man I’m seeing. I looked
over in the corner and this tiny pinprick of vivid blue light started to
form. I told my beau to hold on and looked at the corner, and said, “no
no, you’ve been told this room is off limits,” and the light blinked out
like it had never been there at all.</b>
<br><b>The ghosts in my apartment seem to come and go as they please. Right
before this last Thanksgiving, the activity was so bad that I had trouble
sleeping at night. Talking again to my friend online, she was able to relay
a message from my Papaw about a wreath my mother had made many years ago
– saying that it was too pale and needed color. She then described the
wreath right down to the color ribbon woven through it.</b>
<br><b>While visiting my parents for Thanksgiving, my mom and I decided
to visit the cemetery that my great-grandparents and grandfather are interred.
We brought a digital camera and a tape recorder, as well as some flowers.
Before the visit, my friend made several comments about what I would see
– including the fact that there was a stone “4 away” that would be important,
as well as another “7 by 7 from the front door” and one “covered in 7’s”.</b>
<br><b>We went into the mausoleum where my great-grandparents and grandfather
are and laid out our flowers. I burned some sage and smudged it around
their markers while my mother set up the tape recorder and took some pictures.</b>
<br><b>I began counting markers, moving 4 rows up, down and to each side
of their markers. Four markers to the left was the plaque for a little
girl. She had my first name, my initials and had lived 28 days. I am 28
years old.</b>
<br><b>Outside the front door of the mausoleum is a set of gravestones
flush with the grass. My mother and I started walking the rows, pacing
out seven stones. As we came to the 8th row, 7th stone, I tripped and stepped
on a grave. My mother grabbed my arm and said “oh my god…. Look down.”
I did… and realized that I was straddling the grave of my other grandfather
(my father’s father) who had died before I was born. Standing at the foot
of his grave and looking toward the mausoleum door, it looks exactly 7
rows away and 7 graves over.</b>
<br><b>Those are the experiences I’ve had at places I’ve lived – I’ve also
had some at famous places. Unlike my mother, who says she’s had her (blond)
hair pulled on the People Mover and seen the little boy in Pirates of the
Carribean, I’ve never felt anything there – except I always remember being
uneasy when I looked at the windows of Sleeping Beauty’s Castle.</b>
<br><b>I went to Alcatraz about fours years ago. San Francisco is always
cold to me and it was a cold wet day, so I was bundled up pretty well.
I remember walking into the C block and I started to shiver. I exhaled
and could see my breath. No one else with me could see theirs. I turned
to a friend of mine (my son’s godmother and a practicing shaman) and I
said, “Can’t you feel it?” She agreed that she felt uneasy and I shook
my head, “No, it’s more like I can hear a thousand voices in my head and
they are all so sad and so cold. This was a hateful place for them.”</b>
<br><b>I turned off the tape player for the tour, the recording only making
me feel worse. We got to the solitary confinement cells and my friends
and my ex dared me to go inside. The sun was just peeking through the clouds
and all the lights were on, so the cell was fairly well lit, but it seemed
very dark to me. I remember feeling this cold chill at the base of my spine
and something told me ‘if you go in there, you will die,” and I panicked,
backpedaled and flattened against the opposite wall, flatly refusing to
go in there.</b>
<br><b>I also had dinner at the Keg Steakhouse in New Westminster, BC.
We were having dinner on the patio outside and I excused myself to the
ladies’ room. On the second floor, I remember feeling odd. It was too quiet
for such a busy and wonderful place to eat. On the third floor in the ladies’
room, I knew I was being watched. It was so strong, I looked around several
times and called out to see if someone else was there. There wasn’t, so
I shook it off and went back downstairs.</b>
<br><b>Sitting back on the patio, I felt like I was being drawn to look
at the windows on the upper floor. My beau, who is native to the area,
asked me what was wrong. I told him about the feeling I’d had on the third
floor and that was when he told me the restaurant was reportedly haunted.
People said they often saw faces peering out of the third story windows
when it was closed.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Prankster Spirit</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jkmyers@juno.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have had little contact with anything out of the ordinary or supernatural
in my life, until that is, I moved from my home in West Texas after I married
my ex-husband seven years ago. My ex-husband was enlisted in the Air Force,
and we were stationed in Oklahoma. I've never lived anywhere else but Texas
and thought this was a grand adventure, finally I would get to see our
great nation. Our first year in Oklahoma was normal, and even boring. We
were on the waiting list for a house on the military base there, and were
very glad to finally get to move into a base house one month before our
son was born. The house seemed normal, clean, and very "military". That
is to say, plain. Nothing to fancy, just your basic house. That first month
before, my son was born, we went about the house putting things away and
getting the nursery set up, and life seemed perfect. I tended to take a
short nap in the middle of the day during my last month of my pregnancy.
It was during one of these naps that things started happening. I lay down,
fell asleep and woke a couple of hours later, nothing seemed out of place
until I looked at my dinning room table, that was directly behind the couch
where I was napping. All of my dinning room chairs were neatly placed upside
down on the table. As I would normally do when I mopped the floors. I thought
perhaps my husband (now my ex) was playing a joke on me, because of a conversation
we had had with a friend that lived on another block. (She told us she
heard scratching noises coming from her living room one evening.) I called
my husband to see if he had come home for lunch while I was napping, but
he said that he hadn't had time that day. I thought maybe, since being
pregnant, I had forgotten that I had put them on the table. A couple of
days later, I came home from the grocery store and walked into the house
to put my purse on the counter before I went to get the grocery bags out
of the car. I unloaded the car, then put the groceries away. Then I turned
to get my check book out of my purse, but it wasn't on the counter where
I knew I had left it. Again I thought I was just suffering from pregnancy
absent mindedness, and I searched the house. I looked and looked but couldn't
find it anywhere, so I just gave up, and started making dinner. When my
husband got home he noticed my purse sitting on the lowered cabinets in
the kitchen, above the breakfast bar. He asked me why I would put it up
there. I told him I hadn't. He didn't believe me. But I knew I hadn't.
I was eight and a half months pregnant at the time and I would have had
to stand on a kitchen chair, then step up onto the breakfast bar itself
before reaching the top of the lowered cabinets to place my purse up there.
I had heard MANY stories from people on the base, and off the base, about
hauntings, or strange things happening in their houses. Many people clamed
that the base was actually built on land once belonging to Native Americans
from that area, and that the land held a special spiritual meaning for
them. Since nothing truly terrifying happened in the house I never gave
it a second thought, and just took the spirit in house as a prankster.
Mostly the spirit, would move things around or a misplaced item would suddenly
reappear in a place it was never at in the first place. A funny example
of this: My birth control pills came up missing one day, and frustrated,
I actually spoke out loud to the spirit asking it to please give them back
to me. Then walking into the nursery to change my sons diaper, I found
them hanging in the baby supply basket next to the change table, where
the diaper rash cream should have been, and of course the diaper rash cream
was in the medicine cabinet where my birth control pills were kept, but
it hadn't been there just moments before when I was looking for my birth
control pills. Things continued harmlessly for almost a year, and I even
gave the spirit a nick name; Mr. Sneaky-pants. A couple of months before
my sons first birthday however, things started getting a bit more frightening
for my husband. One evening we heard the blinds over the living room patio
window being slid back and forth. We thought our dog Tyler might be playing
in them but he was snuggly resting on the floor on my side of the bed.
I casually said, "Oh, it must be Mr. Sneaky-pants playing then." My husband
didn't think it funny at all and seemed very agitated. So I called out
to the living room, "Okay, that's enough!" and the sounds stopped. Well
that apparently freaked my husband out and he spent the rest of the night
locked in the bathroom and wouldn't come out till breakfast. Noises and
sometimes whispering continued, although, Mr. Sneaky-pants decided not
to bother my husband too much. It seemed rather harmless to me. I never
had an uncomfortable feeling while I lived there, and when some months
later my husband and I separated, I found myself missing my sneaky spirit.
I have had several encounters with spirits in Oklahoma, good, bad, and
creepy, during my five years in residency there. I am truly convinced that
Oklahoma's old west past, and rich Native American history has made it
one of the most haunted places in the nation. It seems that every field,
or home, or business has its own story, and its own spirit to go with it.
Although some of the experiences I've had while living there, after Mr.
Sneaky-pants, where quit eerie, and sometimes down right evil, I wouldn't
have traded it for anything in the world. It really opened my eyes to the
possibility that there really could be something more after we die.</b>
<br><b>Thank you for the opportunity to tell my story.</b>

<br><b>Extreme Hauntings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: M</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Last week I went into my uncles house for a barbecue, my uncle, aunt,
2 cousins, and mom were there. And there dog. So to help you better understand
the story, the layout of the house is this:</b>
<br><b>1st floor: front door right next to staiirs, living room, leading
to hall dining room, den, kitchen, bathroom.</b>
<br><b>2nd floor: small not even hallway, 2 doors on right one ahead one
left, ahead is the bathroom which has a door leading to a dressing room
from the mster bedroom. So oneday after i eat i need to go, so i run to
the first floor bathroom, whaddo you know its locked from the inside, no
one in there, so i say, no problem just go upstairs. So i head upstairs
and as im going up i hear bangs and think nothing of it. I go in and lock
both doors,&nbsp; (habit), and i sit down. As im in there i hear rapid
knocks and i scream someones in here. then i hear the masterbedroom door
open and in less than a second i hear the door to the dressing room being
pounded on and the knock non stop jiggling of the doorknob. Im terrified
so i look out the window, the dogs in the yard, and everyone else is on
the deck eating dinner. Then i mumbled Oh S___. i finish up wash my hands
and i count down, the door is now being pounced on, like an angry bulldog
smelling meat in the room im in. So i unlock the door as soon as i get
to one. Then i run, i ran as fast as i ever did. But of course i tripped
on the stairs. then i saw the bathroom door open, then a loud, loud moan
and a white figure very faint, it looked like a maid, staring at me, i
stood up and glanced at it unable to move, shaking. I screaamed im sorry,
then it looked at me with somewhat mad eyes and it just started how do
i say this, hovering above the stairs , then i ran, i could feel my legs
being kicked and i almost fell, then it said why did you kill me, or a
mumble like that, but i didnt look back. I just made my way out the back
door and ran into the yard where the dog was. It was going crazy. A pure
sign of a ghost. Then i told everyone, and they didnt believve me. This
may sound fake but by all means its true. I did some research and there
was a house that burnt down in the 1800s, a colonial one. That explains
the maid. I made a promise to myself that id never go on the second floor
again, and i never have.though sometimes when im the only one in the house
i can hear footsteps and rattlign upstairs, and whenever i hear that im
directly below the area of the bathroom. Late one night when i was sleeping
over my cousins (SAME HOUSE) i was trying to pull an all nighter. Suddenly
the house alarm went off. everyone scrambled, i grabbed a baseball bat
along with my cousin who was sleeping on the couch, i was on the floor,
she grabbed a pellet gun and ran for the door. Guess what we saw. The same
figure i saw standing in the middle&nbsp; of the door. my cousin shot the
pellet gun and it bounced of the cement on the porch. it went through the
figure. Then it dissapeared. we got some blankets unlocked the jeep&nbsp;
got everything inside we turned on the heated seats and reclined the chairs.
We locked the doors and set the alarm. Later the alarm went off and every
few seconds when the lights went off i could see the figure&nbsp; but my
cousin said i probably garbbed the door handle&nbsp; and that she didnt
see anything. This is not a joke. This is a true story.</b>

<p><b>Convulsions as a Sign?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ekocyrrehc@comcast.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>alright i'll bite, i was reading the personal experiences, it all
is not only entertaining, but extremely interesting. but then i came across
a story that freaked me out.. i had one way similar to it.&nbsp; They were
explaining convulsions at night, and weird feelings and things of that
nature. well, here goes</b>
<br><b>we moved into my house when i was in 5th grade, and now 5 years
later im still in the same house. its not old, it was built no more than
20 years ago, and no one to my knowledge has died in it or anything like
that. but, stuff went down. even now im getting dizzy and foggy-minded.</b>
<br><b>i was lying in bed maybe one or two years ago, and i had just fallen
asleep. almost immediately i woke up, and i couldnt move for the life of
me... it felt like i was being held down, and there was this incredible
pressure on my whole body pushing my into my futon. it was intense, i cant
explain it. i started shaking and convulsing like something was inside
me trying to break out, and i could feel this feeling of panic... and i
think it was really cold. i couldnt talk, or breathe even, and i thought
i was having a seizure or something,... i'd never had one before and i
thought i might be epileptic and not know it or something stupid like that...
the convulsions lasted like 20 seconds, and it was pretty painful, but
not to the point of death. the whole time, there was this squealing in
my ear, peircingly loud, and it made my ears ring... that scared me to
no end.. after it was over, i layed there stunned, and i didnt know what
to think.... it was a new experience and i didnt even consider it being
a supernatural thing at all.</b>
<br><b>so a week later the same thing happened... it mightve even been
the next night. anywho, i had just fallen asleep again, but yet again i
was jolted awake by those darn convulsions. again i couldnt move, the pressure
was even MORE intense, so much so that as i was being pressed down, i could
feel the bars on my back from underneath my futon! it hurt even more, and
i couldnt breathe at all. the squealing was even more intense, and as this
was happening, i felt like something had grabbed my ankles and started
dragging me off of my bed... i couldnt scream.. im just amazed to myself
right now that this happened. but i swear on my life it did.. i felt like
whatever it was, was literally dragging me off of my bed. like seriously,
after it was over, i had moved from the top of the bed to the mid-bottom
of it... my body had moved like 2 or 3 feet. my god... i had free thought
through all of this though, it wasnt mentally controlling me, just physically...
i started saying to myself... "oh GOD whats</b>
<br><b>ppening?" and maybe 2 minutes after it started, it subsided. needless
to say, i was FREAKED OUT. i just layed in bed sweating and panting for
like 10 minutes, looking back and forth from my clock to the door, and
finally worried myself to sleep. it happened for about a week, maybe even
two, possibly 5 or 6 times... i told my parents but they didnt really believe
me, they kinda just said "well... keep an eye on it"</b>
<br><b>thats the most physical of my experiences, other than that, i just
have... feelings i guess, that something is here with me, or theres a presence.
sometimes i get dizzy and distracted, by SOMETHING, and im pretty damn
sure that its not my brain, that its something in the room, or even scarier,
in me. but all i can say, is thats what happened to me, and i havnt ever
told anyone about it, aside from my parents... and even then, i didnt tell
them that i thought it was a "ghost" thing. it was the most terrifying
thing i've ever felt in my life, it was a state of total and complete panic..
well,, thats all... i hope someone emails me back and tells me im not insane.</b>
<br><b>and im 16 too... that all happened when i was 14. im really surprised
that i took that little experience as well as i did lol</b>
<br><b>thanks for reading</b>

<br><b>This is my Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: scevridge@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>hello.my name is scott. i have been fascinated with gohsts and the
paranormal for as long as i could remember. growing up, we lived in what
was said to be a 100-150 yr old house in pennsville nj. it was across the
street from riverview beach park(an amusment park was there in the early
1900's)so this house was in the center of town and alot of activity. me
and my younger sister remember being young, i was about 5 she was about
3. and we chase these orbs from the landing of the stairs in the dining
room to the front of the house and back.we called them faries.wow as i
write this i can actually see them in my mind.</b>
<br><b>when my parents first moved to this house in 1978 they fell inlove
with it.after living there for several months, they decided to have a house
warming party. after the guests had had the tour of the house ,my parents
started getting asked about the lady sitting at the base of the stairs.
(now growing up i learned how to believe what my dad told&nbsp; me and
how to believe what my mom had told me) so when hearing this&nbsp; from
my moms mouth i knew it had to be true.ok back to the story. so when my
parents asked about what lady they were speaking ,she was never there.
my parents were approached with this question numerouse times that evening,and
every time she was not to be found.</b>
<br><b>growing up in this house was never boring.t.v's would turn on when
no one was in the room. lights would always flicker on and off. me and
my sisters would always feel as though we had to sing to the ghost when
we went up the steps. this may sound wierd, but if we didnt sing we would
always slip up the steps. not to say something actually tripped us, but
if we didnt sing we would miss a step or just barely hit the next step
and ip off of it as we walked up. we had a picture of jesus that was hung
on the wall that was on the other side of the stairwell. every year on
a certain day and time the picture would fall off the wall.....</b>
<br><b>after some research of the house my parents found out that ayoung
lady,about19-20 yrs old named isabelle had once lived there and had fallen
down the step and broke her neck on the way down. she was said to have
died right there on the landing of the stairs.after putting the instances
together my parents found out that she died on the same day that the picture
would fall off the wall. my parents dont beleive she was an evil spirit
,they think that the picture of jesus would because of the vibrations of
her falling down the steps.</b>
<br><b>they also dont believe she was evil because whaen my younger sister
was about two weeks old,she came down with serious illness. it is family
tale that she died in my mothers arms. supposedly both my parents saw isabelle
come from the landing and towards them. as she got closer, my parents claim
to have felt a sence of easiness and calm.just then my sister started crying.
she was not dead anymore. when the emergency personell came and took her
to the hospitol my parents were not about to tell them what had just happened.
who would.</b>
<br><b>on another occasion. i had a friend sleep over one nite. he did
not want to stay in my room because i would talk about was ghosts. my bedroom
had the entry way door to the attic in it. so this made him even more uneasy.
so we decided to make a ghost trap. i took my wwf wrestling ring apart
and used the ropes to tie the door shut. along with the deadbolt, hook-latch.and
lock on the door knob it self. each color rope was tied to a different
lock and wrapped around as tight as possible.(as tight as an eight yr old
could tie)this had settled hhis fears so we went to sleep. when we woke
up the next morning every piece of rope was on the floor and the locks
all unlocked. my parents had not been in ther because we woke up before
they did. and even if they did go in there for what ever reason,,rule number
one was to make sure the door was locked so the cold draft wouldn't</b>
<br><b>come into my room. needless to say he never spent the night again.</b>
<br><b>well i hope you enjoyed my story . it was a thrill just writing
it because it brought back so many memories of the old house.</b>
<br><b>my mother is coming home from kentucky this weekend for a family
wedding, but i had asked her to bring all the photo albums she has with
pictures of the inside of the house. after seeing the pictures of orbs
and ectoplasmic activity on your website, i'm hoping to find some interesting
pictures. if i come across any pictures of strange phenomenon i'll be sure
to send them your way. so keep an eye out for them. see ya.-</b>

<br><b>Strange Things Anywhere I go</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cecilia_zepeda@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>At about age&nbsp; 7 or 8 I was in my moms room and I looked at the
curtains which were a cream color, the sunlight was hitting them and shadows
that were shaped like people were walking across. I asked my mom&nbsp;
and she said its nothing.Then at age 14 or 15 I would start having nightmares,
I'd&nbsp; wake up about 2 or 3:30am. The dreams were about sprits or like
once a cat attacking me, I even dreamed I was playing with tarot cards,
that a bad sprit picked me up into the air, and I yelled Jesus please help
me , (sometimes in my dreams I could remember this and I would always wake
that instant). When I woke up from the bad dream of a wild cat attacking
me with blood everywhere I went downstairs, the curtains open and that
same cat I dreamed of staring at me outside the door. I normally woke up
went downstairs to calm down&nbsp; watch some TV, I couldn't go to sleep
being so scared. I was sitting on the couch, I would hear a loud pound
on the wall in back of me. I would get up turn on the light to look there
was no one there all the windows were closed. The bad dreams and the pounds
on the wall happened routinely. Some nights the windows were closed with
my blankets pulled over my head I would awake to a cold air blowing in
my ear. One time I was laying in my bed trying to go back to sleep and
I had heard pins dropping and I tuned to look and I seen one floating in
the air and fall back down. It was some bobby pins my sister left on the
dresser. My dreams have not been all bad sometimes about angels. Once in
a dream I was looking at the sun and there was a ring around it and turned
out it was angels coming down to earth, once here the ground begun to shake
terribly.</b>
<br><b>IBy age 20 I had a 2 year old daughter, I lived at home still and
was dating a guy who was no good. Anyway my brother had gotten some tarot
cards and I would ask questions about the guy and the death card would
come up and the devil card. This guy and I dated for 6 months and stupid
me I didn't take care of myself and got pregnant. I love children, babies
very much I could never give up a child, but there were just to many reasons
why I couldn’t have it, so I had an abortion, this was the hardest decision
in my life. To this very day I regret it and feel so bad. So this guy was
always cheating on me he wasn't a very good person, he did not want to
give up his partying and playing to get married. Strange things started
happening like every other morning exactly at 6:00 am. My daughters little
Elmo kitchen phone would start ringing by itself. There is picture I have
with a little kid shadow also.</b>
<br><b>My My mom heard a baby cry,. One time she asked if my daughter got
up and was crying at he door, there was no way. One night I think I was
sleeping but I seen myself sleeping and my daughter, I felt scared as</b>
<br><b>to the door I seen three sprits standing. They were a light bluish
color they looked evil and they were coming closer and closer then my daughter
only 3 started screaming mommy monsters get me. I got up</b>
<br><b>turned on the light and tried to get her to wake up, she did and
I was praying and we felt better. My family all moved away to another city
about 2 years later and the house we moved into was</b>
<br><b>brand new. About 3 months after living there I would hear the bang
on the wall and no one would be there. Bad dreams still there once in while.
Then I would dream about a little boy.</b>
<br><b>it wSometimes a baby or little boy. One night I forgot to turn the
cartoons off, and fell asleep and awoke to hearing a child saying why mommy
why, it wasn't my daughter, I looked at TV it was all black, then</b>
<br><b>cartoons came back on after a minute. At the time I was dating a
nice guy and we were planning to get married but I got pregnant and we
got married sooner than expected. We moved to an apartment I still&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
had bad dreams but they were decreasing and so were the objects moving.
I gave birth to a little boy almost on Christmas, which was a gift. A few
months later we bought a house and not to much has&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
happened just the blinds made a crunch sound, the window were closed. And
just last year there was knocking in our bedroom on the wall that faced
the back yard, my husband checked&nbsp; but there was no one. I</b>
<br><b>cant remember if I was asleep or wake but I did see something it
looked like shadows of people on the wall lined up, and&nbsp; was feeling
like I couldn't breathe like a pressure on top of me . I looked up on the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ceiling and there was a shadow with a sneaky smile and I said leave me
alone go away and they were gone. I am Catholic and I believe in god ,
Jesus and it seems like when I go to church a few days later is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
when I have a bad dream, or I awake with an uncomfortable feeling, I feel
scared like someone is watching me, and when I try to go to sleep and turn
my head towards the left I hear like a light flick on the wall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
wall when IIturn my head the other way and I hear it on the other wall.
I haven't gone to church in months, but I still pray and believe.&nbsp;
Strange. maybe this is all in my&nbsp; mind, maybe I am nuts.</b>

<br><b>Somewhere In Sissonville</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: HappinessIsNot@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Ok I have sent one story here but this is another one cause stuff
like this likes to happen to me. I'm from Sissonville which is in Charleston
, West Virginia, I don't know the name of the place that this thing happened
to me but if you live out this way it is down the road by Dolly's Market.
So here I go, I went with one of my friends at the time to her house mind
you it is out in the middle of no where she had told me about her dad and
brother and many other people seeing a coffen floating in the middle of
the road at night and sometimes a person walking in the road, it only happpens
where the gates are where you enter a cemetery that is way up on a hill.
So me and her got bored and said why not go up there it was right down
the road and it was like 2 in the evening so we had lots of time. We headed
up the road and to the gate and started to walk up the long dirt road(
we had her sister with us and a camrea just in case) after a while we got
to the top of the hill and the graves we started taking pictures cause
me and my friend felt something, we had a new roll of film and everything
but after only 4 or 5 shoots of the camera it said we had no more. At this
point we were just laughing and&nbsp; then her sister said that we should
go up the hill more to where other people have seen some things, so we
did. Once up there we show some strange rocks made in a triangle formation
don't know what made us do it but we started to dig in the middle of the
triangle. After about a foot there was a layer of sticks like someone had
put there, so then we dug another foot and found rocks but not like they
had been there like they had been thrown in there to hide something. Right
when we were about to dig again that is when it started we heard someone
talking to us and the animals went crazy my friends sister had rocks thrown
at her and also so did we then I started to hear things but just me. Need
less to say we started to leave, we got are stuff and walked out of the
middle of the rocks and right when I was getting out of it I was picked
up and thrown into a rock( my friend and her sister can back this up) .
I blacked out at this point and woke up on my friends back we got down
to the graveyard and I had to be put down cause I keep hearing screams
and my legs and body were on fire. Finally we started to make it out of
there and the only thing that was keeping me awake was ice that we had
keep in a sealed cooler, we sat down so I could get some ice but when we
opened it there was nothing not even the drinks we had in there and their
was no trail of water licking out or any sign that water had ever been
in there. Ok so we got to the gate thanks to my friend holding me up cause
I keep hearing the screams. We got over to the other side of the road and
when we looked back we all saw I white thing going back into the woods.
Till this day I haven't went up there and I still have the scare and the
bad ankle form it so no one can tell me this never happened and that I
am crazy.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Mother</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lindacody@lindburgcadillac.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, I was reading some of the other post and thought I might try
to find some others who have had a simular experience:</b>
<br><b>My mother passed away in 1998 and before she died I kept telling
her to somehow come backand let me know that she was okay. After she died
I prayed everynight for her to come to me and let me know all was okay,
but nothing this went on for alomst a year. Then one night ( out of the
blue) I had a dream that my mother called me on the phone ( but I could
see her and her surroundings)&nbsp; she was in like a "Hall" ( likewhere
one would have a wedding recpetion) and there were all these tables and
there were several other women and it looked like they were working on
something. My mom looked beautiful and healthy. I asked if she was okay
and she told me that it was so beautiful there. and I asked her why it
had taken her so long to come see me. she told me that you have to work
to get your voice&nbsp; and the more work you did the more the stronger
your voice was and that would explain why she was whispering. I woke up
immediatley and just knew that it wasn't a dream because of the way it
made me feel. I knew i woke up with a smile on my face. I felt such peace.
anyway it is now 2004 and I was telling a lady at work about it and and
said that when her mother died that same thing happened to her, there were
variations to the setting and such but it was still described as a "hall"
and that her mother wouldn't talkto her ( but this happened right after
her death) as mine was a year later, whuch is what I think they she was
trying to convey to me not that they had to actually work but "work" on
themselves so to speak. we both started to cry because how could two people
have the same dream years apart and have not even met yet. which makes
me think that there are more people out there with the same experience,
if so please contact me I am so fascinated by this topic.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Haunted Residence</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: daytwah88@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hello,</b>
<br><b>I had a poltergeist-esque when I was in fourth grade. I lived in
San Antonio, TX then (since people live there, still, I won't disclose
the address) it was a new house, no one we knew of died in there so the
events that happened to me there are unexplained. I was sitting on the
floor throwing a suction cup ball on a table and then I'd pull it off and
do it again, when I had thrown it and it rolled off the table. Within maybe
a second my window shade went all the way up with a clapping sound, and
my (locked) window slid all the way open. A toy or something flew by my
head and hit the wall. There were a few other things that would slide off
level surfaces or just randomly fly off the surface and hit the wall. Needless
to say, I was really scared that day, but didn't really think much about
it.</b>
<br><b>Well. that's my story.</b>

<br><b>Friends in Spirit</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: GeneralCoins@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I wrote to you last year about the spirit of Elizabeth, my wife
from my past life. I now know why she was here, guiding me along with other
good spirits who have come into my life.&nbsp; She is leading me to my
true soulmate - my Twin Flame.&nbsp; I had had many dreams and visions
of this girl over the years, plus an attraction to the Muswell Hill area
of north London.</b>
<br><b>Last June, before Elizabeth returned to the Light, she told me that
she had found the one who would make my life complete. She showed my a
girl very similar in looks to her - tall and slim with dark hair, pale
skin and brown eyes.&nbsp; As I went through another relationship, these
visions grew stronger.&nbsp; I consulted a psychic, or rather Elizabeth
took me to see a psychic, called Richard Lawler, who spoke with Elizabeth
and confirmed everything she had told me.</b>
<br><b>Richard said that the girl is will marry lives in the Hampstead
area and and described her exactly as Elizabeth did.&nbsp; (This was last
November)&nbsp; He said I would first meet this girl on March 13th and
them see her again when we would get together.&nbsp; He said that her name
began with "E", just like Elizabeth, and that her surname has "Rose" in
it. He added that her father is a retired GP.</b>
<br><b>Afterwards, the name "Evelyn" kept cropping up in books, newspapers
etc. I kept seeing "EVE", "EEV" and "EAV" on car registration plates.</b>
<br><b>Spirit activity intensified when I moved into my new flat.&nbsp;
A Star of David appeared on my cupboard door with a heart below it.&nbsp;
I spoke with Richard again, and he said that the Star and Heart was an
apport from Evelyn's grandfather in Spirit.&nbsp; Evelyn is Jewish, and
I found out that her surname is Rosenthal.</b>
<br><b>Elizabeth returned to the Light shortly after I contacted Richard,
and other guides made themselves known. My "main" guide, who has been with
me all my life is a Samurai Master called Jinoko.&nbsp; I can feel when
he's with me, Sometimes I can feel his kimono brushing against me as he
walks past.</b>
<br><b>Master Jinoko told me that he has been trying to get me and Evelyn
together, but she doesn't listen to him.&nbsp; He says that she has been
hurt in the past, and that he and I must help her.&nbsp; Master Jinoko
has been with my nan in spirit and she had been with me a number of times.&nbsp;
The most vivid apparition of my nan was not so much like a ghost, but more
like a window into the Spirit World.&nbsp; My nan looked so much younger
than when she died, and sunlight up there was very warm and loving.&nbsp;&nbsp;
She showed me images of me being with Evelyn.</b>
<br><b>A great change is taking place in my life at the moment, a change
for the better, and I am so thankful that I have all these good spirits
looking out for me.&nbsp; With their love and guidance, there's no need
for me to be afraid of ghosts.</b>

<p><b>The Spirit Infested House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: wingo86_9@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Well this is a story that was probably one of my most terrifying
experiences</b>
<br><b>ever. Me and a group of my friends went to spend the night at one
of our</b>
<br><b>friends house and though everyone else was excited about the fact
that it</b>
<br><b>was haunted, i was nervous because i am a believer, plus i get these</b>
<br><b>feelings sometimes when i go places. If a house is haunted i can
usually</b>
<br><b>feel if it is haunted by a good spirit or a bad spirit. Well...as
soon as I</b>
<br><b>walked in the house i got this weird almost suffocating feeling.
like</b>
<br><b>someone was pressing down on my whole body. Let me tell you a little
history</b>
<br><b>on this house. In the basement there was a very well known mobster
shot. the</b>
<br><b>bullet went through the door and there were very obvious blood splatters
all</b>
<br><b>over the door. That door was sold on ebay for A LOT of money. The
tree</b>
<br><b>outside was used to hang slaves that got out of hand for the owners.
There</b>
<br><b>is a bathroom in one of the many bedrooms in the house that a woman
was shot</b>
<br><b>by her husband while she was getting ready for a party. It is said
that she</b>
<br><b>was accused of having an affair, after the murder it came out that
there was</b>
<br><b>no affair and that the servant that accused was jealous and hated
the lady.</b>
<br><b>Well...now that you know the history of the house i will go ahead
and tell</b>
<br><b>you what happened to me and my group of friends when we went there.
All of</b>
<br><b>the boys were thinking it was a joke and just wanted to scare us,
but</b>
<br><b>finally they got one of us to go down to the basement. Her name
is Summer.</b>
<br><b>She tried to get her dog to go with her, but he wouldnt budge past
the 4th</b>
<br><b>step. She got downstairs and was down there for maybe 1 min. and
then we</b>
<br><b>heard a bloody murder scream and she came darting up the stairs.
She was</b>
<br><b>histerical and didnt even say anything before she got in her car
to go home.</b>
<br><b>Before she left she said that he warned me once and that no one
was to go</b>
<br><b>down there. we tried to calm her down to tell us what happened,
but she took</b>
<br><b>off. Then we were a little scared, but we brushed off enough to
stay the</b>
<br><b>night. When we slept that night it was all in the same room. Me,Jessica,
and</b>
<br><b>laurie slept on the floor and Niki and her boyfriend slept in the
bed. All</b>
<br><b>we could hear all night was blood curteling cries and then a strangling</b>
<br><b>sound. it was faint and hard to hear at times, but i knew what it
was. that</b>
<br><b>tree outside the window.then at 3:30 am the bed started levitating.
it shook</b>
<br><b>about 4-5 ft. away from the wall. niki and her boyfriend were so
terrified</b>
<br><b>at that , but then right afterwards we saw an insanly bright light
from the</b>
<br><b>bathroom. it was reflecting off of the mirror right into mine and
jessicas</b>
<br><b>eyes. then the lights outline took form of a woman. she had no face.
it was</b>
<br><b>all light, but i could definetly see the outline of a woman. after
that we</b>
<br><b>all left that boys house. none of u could understand how he could
live in</b>
<br><b>such a haunted spirit infested house. he told us that it bothered
him for</b>
<br><b>awhile, but him and the spirits came to an understanding after the
1st week</b>
<br><b>of living there. he wouldnt bother them and they wouldnt bother
him. he told</b>
<br><b>us not to sleep in that room, but i guess we took it as a joke.i
learned</b>
<br><b>that day that it is not smart to play around with the emotions of
spirits.</b>
<br><b>They are already confused, they dont need to be angry also.</b><b></b>

<p><b>I thought that I might let you know how wonderful I think</b>
<br><b>your sight is, first off. Secondly I thought that I might</b>
<br><b>share with you a story of an experience that scared the</b>
<br><b>pants off me! (If you know what I'm saying)</b>
<br><b>It was the middle of late fall 1999 and me and two of my</b>
<br><b>best friends where hanging out at my house. My sister and</b>
<br><b>brother were gone and my mother was no where in sight! The</b>
<br><b>house was our play ground! My friends and I spent the</b>
<br><b>night talking about stupid girl stuff, like who are our</b>
<br><b>future husbands were going to be. The night was running</b>
<br><b>smoothly until we began to feel a strange aire (feeling)</b>
<br><b>come over the house. We ignored it and decided that it's</b>
<br><b>best not to play into these strange feelings. We went</b>
<br><b>upstairs into my sister's room, because I was living in</b>
<br><b>the study, which was far to small for me and my two</b>
<br><b>friends. We began a game of poker when my friend Falisha</b>
<br><b>looked over at my sister's porcilin dolls, and grabbed my</b>
<br><b>arm. I thought that she was acting and playing a game. But</b>
<br><b>when I looked at those dolls I realized that some of them</b>
<br><b>had moved, others looked as though they were glaring! I</b>
<br><b>chuckled and thought that it must be the soda playing</b>
<br><b>games with my mind; but then my friend Tina noticed the</b>
<br><b>erie feeling in the room and she took hold of my other</b>
<br><b>arm. I smiled and told them that there was nothing to</b>
<br><b>worry about. I was wrong...things got stranger by the</b>
<br><b>minute, I began to think that something was in there with</b>
<br><b>us, and they didn't want us there! Finally my friends and</b>
<br><b>I had, had enough and we called my mom, and waited for her</b>
<br><b>down stairs. Needless to say we didn't enter that room</b>
<br><b>again until my sister got back the next morning. Even then</b>
<br><b>we didn't enter the room. None of my two friends want to</b>
<br><b>talk about the experience, to tell you the truth neither</b>

<p><b>Working Ghost</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: jhoffman@rci.co.za</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is not a personal experience, but my brother told me the story
and I can vouch for his credibility. My brother made artificial rock work
for water features and pools. He went to go do a job for a guy on a farm
near Tabazimbi, South Africa. He wasn't staying in the main house but was
staying in a sort of servant lodging outside the house, which was a big
old house in itself. He woke up in the early hours of the morning to the
sound of somebody very hard at work. If you know my brother you should
know that it takes a BIG racket to wake him.</b>
<br><b>Any way he tried to ignore this noise and go back to sleep, but
it wouldn't go away. Till the point where he lost his temper. Who the hell
works at this time of morning anyways when people are trying to sleep?
He said he could distinctly hear the sound of sawing wood, as well as someone
hitting in nails and all sorts of sounds associated with wood-work. When
he got up to quiet the person, he could not find the location of the noise.
At first he thought it was the foreman in his room but when getting to
his room he had already passed the sound. When he walked back the way he
came it sounded like it was coming from his room. And getting there he
passed it again. After about 15 min of searching he decided to give up
and go back to bed.</b>
<br><b>The next morning at the breakfast table he enquired the house owners
to who was making that noise last night, and what they were building at
that time? To which they answered "oh, you heard Him"! Apparently there
is some ghost that shows up all over the farm in the old buildings, doing
some sort of woodwork. Nobody has actually seen him but they hear him quite
often, working away. Maybe it's some person who really wanted to build
something but died before they could complete it, and is now restless to
complete their project.</b>
<br><b>I do believe that there is a spiritual world that we don't know
anything about, except that it's there. All religions on earth believes
this to some degree or another. I also believe that there are other spiritual
beings in existence, good and evil. Ghosts? Maybe some of them are ghosts,
but there is also beings that never lived lives on this planet, that were
"created" in spiritual form. All religions talks of them too. But I think
my brother's experience, and most of those written on these pages are those
of ghosts "ex-living people".</b>

my investigation.</b>
<br><b>My shift sergeant and leuitenant was also in the house with me while

<br><b>Hope She's Moved On</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kaylajs@comcast.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am in my early teens, yet already several terrifying encounters
with</b>
<br><b>spirits seemed to have happened to me.</b>
<br><b>The first time I think I ever heard of ghosts, I was four years
old.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>were driving through Atlanta, near to where I live, and I noticed
the</b>
<br><b>graffiti seemed to be heavy that year.&nbsp; One thing that really
caught my</b>
<br><b>eye was "Mary Johnston in the mud," sprayed on an overpass.&nbsp;
When I</b>
<br><b>blinked, the words vanished.</b>
<br><b>When we returned home, I heard my parents talking and telling jokes</b>
<br><b>about how my father found our house- getting his truck stuck in
the</b>
<br><b>mud!&nbsp; I didn't think that much of it, being very young.</b>
<br><b>That night, I heard crying.&nbsp; I searched the house, but found
no one.</b>
<br><b>It seemed to be coming from the backyard- in the "mud"- so I looked</b>
<br><b>outside through the sliding-glass door.&nbsp; There was a tar-paper
shack</b>
<br><b>where my trampoline should have been, and a little girl was crying
as</b>
<br><b>her father walked away, tattered with a gun slung over his back.&nbsp;
I ran</b>
<br><b>back into my bed and pulled the covers over my eyes.&nbsp; The next
morning,</b>
<br><b>it was gone, save for a trace of a foul smell where the "house"
had been.</b>
<br><b>Then, when I was nine, I heard the crying again.&nbsp; Memories
flooded back</b>
<br><b>to me.&nbsp; But this time, I realized the sound was quite close-
in my room,</b>
<br><b>in fact.&nbsp; There was "Mary," at the foot of my bed, reaching
out to me.</b>
<br><b>She reminded me so much of myself, I reached out to take her hand.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>brushed right through her like she was only air, and she vanished
into a</b>
<br><b>wisp of smoke.</b>
<br><b>While other odd things have happened, these stood out the most.&nbsp;
I hope</b>
<br><b>others knew what I was going through, and while I sort of wonder

<p><b>...my little Entity....</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: surfing12342003@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>As a child growing up in Robbinsdale Mn, I lived in a old haunted
farm house. The first time I saw an apparition, at about 5 years of age,
I screamed bloody murder. There were two such apparitions in the house
(that I knew of at that time), and except for the occasional visitor on
the end of my bed, or moving things around during the night, there presence
was only frightening. However, something NEW arrived. I was 7 years old
at the time. One winter night my father came up the stairs to use the bathroom..
I slept with my three brothers in a large room, and the door way was open
to the stairway. As my father turned on the stairlight, I opened my eyes,
and at the ceiling I saw what appeared to me as a "flash", or an explosion
type of light. It didn't seem as if it could have come from the stairlight
going on, but not knowing what I saw, and being tired...hmmmm? My father
went back down stairs and turned out the light. I closed my eyes, still
thinking about what I "thought" I'd seen. It became quiet...so quiet there
was actually a noise (can't explain). It became so black...the blackest
of black (almost a substance) and then I couldn't move, or just barely
(almost like I was almost paralized.) My eyes were open, yet there was
only this blackness. Then came the light toward me...the brightest light...most
perfect light...and then it slowly faded away. After that, I heard the
most horrible noises (screams maybe?), but I can't describe them because
I've never heard anything like it before (sort of like seeing a new color?).
Then slowly they faded away and I could move again. Now...try to tell this
to your mother the next morning. Bad dream? Imagination? Too much TV? The
next night I'm in bed. I turned on the stairlight because I was afraid.
With the covers up to my opened eyes (and laying sideways, so as to face
the doorway). The quiet came again (it's calling card), and them the light
started t ard me from somewhere in the back of the room (this is with my
eyes OPEN). I managed to pull the covers over my head, before the paralasis
took over, yet it was so bright, it was as if there was no covers at all.
Something told me NOT to look at the light again, so I clenched my eyes
shut. The noised appeared again, then faded as before. Well...this happened
night after night after night...for years. My mother eventually believed
what I was telling her, but again...how do you exPLAIN something like this.
One thing was apparent...no one else in the room could see this. WhatEVER
it was, was coming for me only. I eventually discovered that it would attempt
to attack me right in that period between being awake and going to sleep.
I also eventually was able to "sit up" when I felt the presense arriving.
Over the years it has lessoned to almost nothing, although I can still
tell when it's around. (I figured it grew bored, as I would never "look"
at it, or give in, or that I'm no longer frightened.). What ever broke
through (that's my theory) back then was certainly trying to "get" me,
and had I continued to look at that light, I hate to thing what would have
happened. Incidently, the time period for these "attacks" would seem like
minutes. Yet, I found out one night that a couple of hours had gone by.
I've thought of hypnosis...to bring to light just what I DON'T remember
about those attacks. But...I'm not going to give my little ghostypoo and
"fuel for the fire" so to speak. I don't think I WANT to know....and don't
want it coming BACK!</b>

<p><b>Fathers Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: muddcat04@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I started my family at a very young age.I was alone with my first
pregnancy while my husband worked untill late into the night.The house
we moved into was the house my deceased father-n-law and his brother had
built 15 years earlier.I never got to meet my father-n-law because he was
killed 8 years before my marriage.Late one night i fell asleep waiting
for my husband to come home when i heard the locks on the front door click
open.I heard the large solid wooden door swing open slowly and i didnt
bother to look at the clock thinking it was my husband coming in quitely
so not to wake me up.i walked into the living room to greet him but the
room was empty. The door was standing wide open and fear struck me thinking
it was a burgler that ran off when he heard someone home.I quickly closed
and locked the door then called my husbands uncle who lived nearby to check
around the house for me.When he was unable to find anything he lightly
joked that it was just his brother keeping a watchfull eye on me and the&nbsp;
baby while .I assumed&nbsp; he was trying to calm me down or keep from
getting another late night call,so I thanked him for checking around and
siad goodbye.A few moments later my bedroom door swung open and footsteps
walked across the livingroom,they sounded like they stopped infront of
me.I could have closed my eyes and sworn someone was standing there.I felt
them,</b>
<br><b>i heard them and I smelt a cologne that was unfamiliar.</b>
<br><b>i was unable to move.After a few agonizing seconds the footsteps
went to my bedroom door,stopped,then the door swung open and shut right
in front of me.I I felt dizzy and sick so i sat down.Everyone i told in
my family siad it was a waking dream brought on by high sugar or lack of
sleep ect.But everyone in my husbands family took it seriously and told
me stories of their own that they felt involved my father-n-laws spirit.This
set of footprints would echo through the house opening and shutting doors
for everynight i was alone.When our baby was born visitors claimed they
smelt flowers in his room,we always felt safe and i eventually started
asking the spirit to entertain the baby for me while i made a bottle or
ran the bath.Our baby was always looking around,smiling and reaching for
some invisable object.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Ghost Man</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: TXARR2@SBCGLOBAL.NET</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi am 23 yrs old and I had no idea of this website until I was looking
up ghost stories on the internet. I have always beleived in the supernatural,
I have had a few freaky things happened to me but the most recent one just
realy freaked me out. I have never been so scared I am convinced that it
was a ghost. It happened in this house last summer. I had just moved to
Dallas and found a roomate. This house was so awesome, it was huge, 3 bedrooms
a living room, dining room, a seperate little room and then our kitchen.
I had the bedroom in the back of the house. My roomate chose the bedroom
in the front. We made the 3rd bedroom into a art room and it was in the
middle of our rooms. There had been some burglaries recently so we always
kept the doors and windows locked. We even put boards on our windows so
that it was impossible for anyone to get in. This particular morning my
roomate had already gone to work and I was all alone in the house. I got
out of bed and took a shower (which was right next to my room). Well we
had a a big closet in one of the dining rooms that we kept some of our
clothes in and I was walking thru the house undressed to get some clothes
and I saw somebody that looked like a regular human being walk down the
hall from my roomates room to the art room. I was terrified and embarrased
because I was naked and I thought that it was her boyfriend and maybe he
had slept over and was still here. I ran back to my room and got dressed
and walked back in there I looked in the art room and nobody was there,
I then went to my roomates room. It was locked. I knocked and called out
his name but no one answered. That was when I got realy scared because
I thought that somebody had broken in or something. I went to all of the
doors and windows in the house and everything was still locked up tight.
I called my roomate and told her that I thought maybe her boyfriend was
still in her room and wouldn't answer because he was embarassed, then she
told me that she had taken him home that morning on the way to work! I
did not see the face of the person I just saw them walk by in a plain white
T-Shirt and jeans. I left the house immediately scared to death. I have
always had wierd feelings in the house like someone was watching me but
I never thought that there was a actual ghost in my house! After a couple
of months I moved out because I was so scared.</b>

<br><b>Little Girl</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LFrancisco9@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>hi, well I've only had a few&nbsp; experiences throughout my life.
i'm 12.</b>
<br><b>Don't let my age fool you,i'm telling the truth. Let me give you
the backround of</b>
<br><b>my first experience. in the apartment my cousin used to live in,a
couple killed</b>
<br><b>each other. At first when she told me,i didn't believe her. she
said that when you were in the bathroom,you'd see the shadows of the couple
on the wall. If you were a girl, you'd see the shadow of the man. if you
were a boy you'd see the shadow of the girl. i didn't believe her until
i experienced it myself. i was in the bathroom and I saw the shadow of
a man. I freaked out, so i got out of there and i never went to her house
again. My second experience took place in my brothers room. he was at school
and it was a week before Valentines Day. i decided to make his valentine
cards. i was in his room(my room is across from his.)and i had the door
open. so, i could see my room.i had little cousins inthe house so i locked
my room and i had the Key in my pocket. before closed it i made sure that
no one was in my room. i checked every inch especially where little kids
could hide. then i locked it. 30 min. later i was in my bros. room. then
thats when it happened. someone kicked my door from the inside. remember
no one was in my room before. after 5 min. i gathered up the courage to
see who was inside. i saw something i would never forget it was a little
girl. she was about 5-6 years old. and she was not one of my cousins. iclosed
my eyes,when i opened them she was still there. iclosed the door when i
opened it again she was gone. that night i asked my brother to trade rooms
with me. he did. he never saw anything. my last experience was about a
year ago. i was asleep. my cousin was next to me cause she had slept over.then,
ifelt a hand caress my face. for some reason it made me feel very happy.
it also made me wake up. i looked at the clock and it was 6:00 AM my cousin
was fast asleep so it wasn't her. later i found out nobody was home except
my cousin and me. they had left about an hour before some one touched me
so it wasn't them. well thank you for listening, i apreciate it.</b>

<p><b>Ghost sighting from long ago</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: TPro745734@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I have something to share that happened to me years ago, 1973 when
I was 20 yrs old.</b>
<br><b>I was on vacation traveling down the East Coast going from</b>
<br><b>Virginia to Florida. Interstate 95 was not complete and I had to
get off and follow U.S.17. It was probably well past mid night and I was
some where in between Myrtle Beach SC but definitely before Charleston
SC. My friend that was with me was sleeping. We were taking shifts on the
driving.</b>
<br><b>I was listening to my 8 track player and all of a sudden it quit
playing (I tried multiple tapes). I could get nothing on the radio other
than faintly WLS in Chicago. Anyways i'm clipping along the 2 lane road
and the travel looked very errie, it sure looked like I was in a marshland
or a swamp.&nbsp; All of a sudden to my right I saw what looked like a
woman in a dress in white. I swerved the car and hit the brakes and the
car spun. I was able to get the car under control. I remember looking back
and saw nothing. It momentarily woke my fried up. I was just interested
in getting out of there. We stopped at Charleston it was probably around
4 or five in the morning for coffee and breakfast. I told my experience
to my friend and also to the waitress. The waitress just looked at me and
said nothing much other that I was crazy for traveling that road in the
night.</b>
<br><b>It was my friends turn to drive he popped in an 8 track and it worked
fine. (he did'nt know about it not working eariler).</b>
<br><b>I was looking at you sight and it's possible that it could of been
Alice of Hermitage? Who knows. I'm not necessarily a believer but I did
see somehing that night. Has any one else ever reeported anything similar</b><b></b>

<p><b>My GHost Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Occasion One: My Friends father.</b>
<br><b>My friends father was having a tough time, he lost a lot of family
members at a young age, he crashed his car and found out that insurance
didn't cover it, he lost his job because of a lie and a whole range of
other bad things, which all made him contemplate committing suicide.</b>
<br><b>He drove up to the mountains to a place outside of Sydney called
Warragamba, which is famous for having a huge water damn.</b>
<br><b>He found a newly made wooden jetty further up the river, and walked
out on the jetty, till he was at the end, and attached a heavy object to
his leg and through himself into the dam.</b>
<br><b>When he was sinking he looked up, and he could see a man bend over
(the man was standing on the jetty) and quickly reached down and pulled
his arm and pulled his whole body up out of the water and back onto the
jetty. He turned around to thank the man, and there was no one to be seen,
and this place is pretty desolate (surrounded by bush etc).</b>
<br><b>Occasion Two: My old holiday house.</b>
<br><b>(I hadn’t been born yet)</b>
<br><b>In the mid 1980's our holiday house which is Approx. 300 kilometres
away was fairly un-used, and so my parents hired a local person to carry
out maintenance on the property (mow the lawns, clean etc). He wore a trademark
hat and everyone new him for it. Campers on a near by camping site were
in the path of a torrential flood which was stirring up and was going to
strike them, and after the police had contacted him, decided to drive down
and warn them. He was crossing a creek in a four wheel drive and underestimated
the power of the gush of water which had become because of the rain, and
was washed down stream. He was screaming for help, but the people ran in
the opposite direction (they were mistaken as to which direction he was
calling from) and he drowned.</b>
<br><b>My parents had no idea of this event and arrived at the holiday
house the next day.</b>
<br><b>Both parents said that during the night, when they were in the hall,
they would see a figure with the trademark hat running backwards and forwards,
trying to lead them to something. Both Scared witless went to bed and left
the lights on. The next day they found out about the tragedy, and when
leaving decided to check the cupboards to see if they had left anything,
and in the cupboard which they saw the ghost running toward, they found
a stereo and some jewellry and some other belongings, and which they found
out belonged to him, he had left them there because he was having a dispute
with his wife.</b>
<br><b>Occasion Three: My old Holidays house (2).</b>
<br><b>Once again, the ghost decided to confront my parents, and not me
(thankfully!).</b>
<br><b>My parents were asleep in there room and the door was shut, when
all of a sudden there was a trampling (Excuse the onomatopoeia) which sounded
like patter patter patter bang! .. Something was running towards the door
and bashing into it, and it woke my parents up.</b>
<br><b>This happened in 2 minute cycles, every 2 minutes, the same sound
would happen.. patter patter patter patter.. BANG!! The rage behind the
attacks was increasing. They made a quick conclusion that “it must be our
cat wanting to sleep in the bed tonight” and after around 50 times, my
dad got out of bed in a fit on anger and screamed “im going to kill this
F**king (*(^(*&amp;(*^( cat” and opened the door.. To see the cat asleep
on the lounge.. They think it is the same ghost, but they don’t know.</b>
<br><b>Occasion four: My personal experience.</b>
<br><b>I had stayed on the internet till around 2:00 AM in the morning,
when I finally decided to get off. I walked out of the computer room and
around the corner to the hall where my room is situated at the end, and
saw this tall black figure of what I assume to be a man (because of its
size) but I couldn’t make anything out, standing and looking into my parents
room. I thought it was my dad, and when walked passed I stumbled into it,
and walked straight through it. And there was this sound so loud words
cannot express and it said really fast “GET OUT” (so fast it was like one
word) and a feeling came over my body like I was going to collapse and
the feeling that you get when someone screams in your ear at close range
was all through my head and I looked around and it had gone and my father
came out and said “what did you yell get out for”.. And we looked at each
other blankly.. I didn’t sleep easily that night.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Uncle Homer</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I would like to ask that you not put my email on your page with
this story please.</b>
<br><b>My mother, used to tell me that my uncle, at the house thay grew
up in (that my grandmother grew up in too), that my uncle used to say he
saw a man in a black rain coat and used to have noghtmares about him too.
We have a theroy that this "man in a black rain coat" is my great-Uncle
Homer. Well one time my mother was sleeping in this house because it was
the day before her birthday. She awoke at about 6:00 AM and her cat was
at the foot of the bead. She could see into the living room from where
she was and saw a shadow go across the wall. She saw the cat sit up and
put her ears up as though she had seen someone or something. Then her mother
said that Uncle Homer was just cheking on my mother.</b>
<br><b>More resently, in my lifetime, this New Year's Eve, at about 2:00
AM, I was outside on my front porch when I saw a person in a black rain
coat staring at our house. It was very foggy too. He walked on and set
off a neighbor's motion detecter light. I instantly thought about my mother's
stories. We circled arounk the neighborhood in our car and found no one.</b>
<br><b>At a family gathering, just a few months ago, my aunt (married to
my uncle), after we told her about New Year's Eve event, she said that
she thinks my uncle still has nightmares about Uncle Homer.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Creepy Pictures</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: wingo86_9@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>One of my good friends and i were talking about weird supernatural</b>
<br><b>experiences today and she told me one that i just have to share
with fellow</b>
<br><b>believers out there. She had just moved here from a different town
and a</b>
<br><b>friend of her's decided to let her move in. This friend of her's
has this</b>
<br><b>weird obssession with collecting all of her past relatives (and
when i say</b>
<br><b>"past" i mean like before her great great great grandma was even
thought of.</b>
<br><b>Like when black and white pictues just came into style. Well when
she first</b>
<br><b>moved in her room mate had all of these pictures in her room on
these</b>
<br><b>shelves above her bed. Well...ever since the first night that she
stayed in</b>
<br><b>that room she has felt this overwhelming presence, like someone
was watching</b>
<br><b>her. And if you have ever experienced things like this you know
that there</b>
<br><b>are different feelings of presences. Some make you uncomfortable,
some make</b>
<br><b>you scared, then others are kind of nice and comforting. It all
depends on</b>
<br><b>what kind of spirit you have in your house. Anyway...she was very</b>
<br><b>uncomfortable. She couldn't sleep at night. She said it was like
someone was</b>
<br><b>watching her and knew that she knew. Like it was taunting her. Finally
she</b>
<br><b>came to the conclusion that those pictures might be the source.
She looked</b>
<br><b>at them one day (I have seen them also) and a couple of these pictures</b>
<br><b>really stood out to her. There is this one that is of a really old
man</b>
<br><b>sitting on top of a horse in a huge field. In the background there
is this</b>
<br><b>barn. She said that every time that she looked at that picture she
got the</b>
<br><b>creeps. She said that she just knew that that old man was evil in
one way or</b>
<br><b>another. Also she told me that she just knew that there was something
very</b>
<br><b>bad that went on in this barn. She couldn't quite put her finger
on it, but</b>
<br><b>she knew for sure. Then there was another picture that really creeped
ME</b>
<br><b>out. It is of this couple with a child in a long white old fashioned
dress</b>
<br><b>(all of them were wearing white) The woman has a very unhappy, almost</b>
<br><b>mean/mad look on her face. Her eyes have this dead dark look to
them. I mean</b>
<br><b>every inch of skin surrounding her eye is black. The man looks mean,
like he</b>
<br><b>is ready to punish someone. Then there was the little kid. It was
standing</b>
<br><b>on a chair. It had the head and face of a 7 year old, but the body
of a</b>
<br><b>toddler. All of them had this creepy evil look on their face and
i just got</b>
<br><b>this horrible feeling looking at it. Like they were staring into
my soul</b>
<br><b>looking to take me over. Bad enough to where i probably will never
go back</b>
<br><b>to that house as long as that picture is on display. Anyway, she
took all of</b>
<br><b>thos pictures out of her room and she never got one of those feelings
again.</b>
<br><b>Now these pictures are in various places throughout the house and
i know</b>
<br><b>that there is something wrong with them because i had no idea that
they were</b>
<br><b>even there, but i got the same feeling she was talking about as
soon as i</b>
<br><b>stepped in that house. Not in her room, just in the livingroom,
kitchen, and</b>
<br><b>her roomates bedroom. It was so weird. I would really appreciate
it if</b>
<br><b>someone who knows a little more about stuff like this would email
me on</b>
<br><b>their thoughts. I would also like to hear from anyone else who would
like to</b>
<br><b>email me with any questions or coments. Thanks for reading.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Falk Theatre in Tampa</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: eternal.shogunx@verizon.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Oh my God, I saw the listing for the Falk Theatre in your Haunted
Places Index and I got goosebumps.&nbsp; I did a show there when I was
18 and I remember a VERY unforgettable experience.&nbsp; Here it is.</b>
<br><b>I was starring in "The Snow Queen" and one night I was in the third
floor Dressing Room...we did have women in the cast, but the Director decided
to have them get dressed downstairs.&nbsp; One night, I was getting ready
and I noticed a young girl in the mirror looking at me.&nbsp; I was so
convinced that she was real that I started talking to her.&nbsp; I asked
her what she was doing there and then she didn't say anything.&nbsp; I
finally looked back and saw nothing there.&nbsp; I looked back in the mirror
and there she was!&nbsp; I screamed and ran down the circular stairs and
told everyone I saw what I saw.&nbsp; They believed me and said they had
seen her too.&nbsp; In a different situation in the same Theatre, I saw
an old couple in the back of the Theatre while I was rehearsing my lines
on stage.&nbsp; Everyone else was behind the Theatre smoking.&nbsp; I saw
this old couple and told them that they weren't allowed in the Theatre.&nbsp;
They didn't move so I walked up to them.&nbsp; As I started walking up
to them, I noticed that they were entirely transparent.&nbsp; This was
the first time I had EVER seen ghosts this close!&nbsp; I was frozen with
shock and fear.&nbsp; It was an older man and an older woman, both dressed
in what looked like late 1800's or early 1900's clothing...I'm not sure
about the fashion-year comparison.&nbsp; Well, that wasn't the scary part.&nbsp;
While I was standing there frozen in fear, the woman looked at me from
her opera glasses and lowered them.&nbsp; She turned to me and put her
index finger to her mouth, as if shushing me.&nbsp; I have never run so
hard in my life.</b>
<br><b>Also, I know the owner of the Royalty Theatre in Clearwater personally
and have seen all of their pictures and have been through a lot of very
interesting experiences at that Theatre as well.</b>
