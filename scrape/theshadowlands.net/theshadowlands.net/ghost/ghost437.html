<big>My Horse Named Shadow<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
<br>
One summer afternoon<br>
Living on a large MA farm in the fifties was lonely, and it didn't help
that my Mom had died when I was 9 and my Father was working either in
the fields or barn all daylight hours and more. To teach me values and
responsibility, my Dad purchased a small easy going horsefor me to
spend my days with. Shadow, my horse, was truly my shadow, we became so
close, spending many hours daily, riding throughout paths and fields. I
loved her dearly, and in a horsy way she returned my love.<br>
The land my Dad's farm was on had many cellar holes dating back 200
years, and as an adult I have studied much about local history, in this
area. I knew of two early graveyards in this area, many stones with my
family name, and stones that recorded the deaths of large families all
in the same month.<br>
I found a grown in path deep in the woods that my Father had told me
was once a busy road with many houses along it. But in the 1950s there
had been no traffic there for over 120 years. Now I have told you my
Shadow was the most gentle horse.....as we walked that narrow path for
the first time, shadow's head arched and her glossy skin rippled, as if
she were cold (August). There was a sharp bend ahead and the closer we
got the jumpier Shadow became, stepping sideways and then just refusing
to move at all. I began to get jumpy myself! Just as the other side of
the bend came into view, the gentle horse reared like a wild stallion
and I was thrown, landing with my head very close to a large rock. As
all this was happening, there was a loud laughter resounding through
the wood with an even louder echo!!! At this point, hitting the ground
I think I kind of blacked out for a brief few seconds. What might have
been a minute later, I became aware that I was lying on my back facing
Shadow's stomach over my head with her back legs behind my head. This
wonderful beast was covered in a white lather and was breathing
very,very hard, but even in that second I knew she had saved me from
something most terrible. I grabbed her reins and slowly got up on my
feet. I tried to calm her and stop the spin in my head while I looked
around me in confusion. There was dirt kicked up in a complete circle
around me. There were many tracks mixing with crushed leaves and ferns
in this circle, I was in tears at this point hugging Shaddow, despite
her sweat, I could see something unworldly had definitely happened, for
there were other tracks mixed among the horses hoof marks. I know it
was over 50 years ago, but in my mind, as clear as
yesterday.................claws and tiny hoof prints, and claws, in the
circle again and again......(hoof prints like a baby deer, but only
two, like it was hopping.)<br>
Well, Shadow and I walked home slowly and before long her head dragged
low and she started to limp, I was little better, and still dizzy.
Until now, I had never told anyone about this event, my Dad would never
have believed me and he was too grief stricken and depressed at that
time from my Moms death to hear much of anything I said.<br>
I remain convinced that Shadow saved my life that day in those dark
woods, but still wonder what kind of an animal can laugh and walk with
claws in the front and tiny deer hoofs in the back....Do you think it
is still there????<br>

Stationed In Germany<br>
<br>
By: joshua.colucci2@us.army.mil<br>
<br>
I am in the US army and at the time of the story was stationed in
Darmstadt Germany. I was living with my wife, two cats and our puppy,
in the army family housing in Darmstadt. We had often seen our cats
staring at things that werent there, watching things move around the
ceiling. We just kind of shrugged it off as if it was spirits, they had
done nothing to bother us.<br>
One night I and the puppy went to the bedroom to go to bed. The room
had a kind of creepy feel to it, and neither myself or my wife liked
being in there in the night with the door closed. This night My wife
was doing something loud so I had closed the door and had fallen
asleep. Then soem time later I was awoken to our puppy yelping like
something had hurt her, my wife came in the roo and we found the poor
thing in the closet, scared shaking. It was then that the room filled
with the smell as if something had been left rotting in the room, it
just smelled of rotting death if that makes sense. We checked
everywhere for what could have caused the smell but there was nothing,
and the room had no vents or open windows, so the smell just kind of
appeared. It went away on its own but I was really freaked out and
never was in there with the door closed after dark again.<br>

I've Seen Things<br>
<br>
By: cmeneshoba@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
My name is Candace and i'm 20 yrs old. I've had experiences all my life
pretty much. Ranging from seeing faces in the dark when i was little to
hearing voices. (at one point in my life i thought i was truly crazy)
Well anyways i had never really came up against anything that had truly
scared me. I mean i would get chills but that would be about it. Well
when i was younger we moved alot. The longest we were ever in one house
was for 6 yrs. I hated that house. We moved there cause my mom was
pregnant with my little brother dustin (now 10) and I remember the
first time i stepped into that house. I felt sick...i had to leave. I
told my mom that i didnt want to live here. Well she got mad and told
me to deal with it. So i did. Nothing really unusual happened for a
couple of weeks. Then things started to go bad in our family
life...problems with outside family members drama and so forth. It was
pretty bad...I now understand that some of it was my fault...not
intentional of course but i couldnt help it. You see a couple of months
before i found out i was adopted. I never knew. I felt like i had been
lied to...betrayed. i had a lot of anger and i was extremely depressed.
I think HE fed on it and used it to manifest himself. Well to excape my
depression and growing resentment twords my mom i would read. I was
always with a book. It was my excape...HE didnt like me reading. At
first i would just get the normal being watched feeling which i was
used to because of my other houses and some friends houses. Then it
progressed to "shadows" moving in the corner of my eye. When i would
look it would of course be gone. Things got worse family wise...my mom
went into labor 3 months early...My dad completely lost any faith he
had. Thats when things went really bad...for me atleast. My bed sat on
a cold spot. I always assumed it was because it was underneith the
window. I have a fear of closets now...it was because of that house.
There was something in that closet. during the day i was fine but at
night i HAD to sleep with my back flat against the wall. If i rolled
over in the middle of the night and slept on my stomach i would
immediatly wake up and roll over with every hair standing on end. Some
times i would wake up with scratches on me...I had a very bad nail
biting probelm at the time. I would wake up every now and again to a
male voice screaming WAKE UP!!! I've been pushed into my dresser by
HIM. I was even slapped once. I've had my things moved. HE was even in
the shower with me...do you know how unnerving it is to be in a
steaming hot shower and get cold chills...knowing that HE was watching
you. Eventually we moved out. We moved to another part of town to a
brand new house with a big back yard so my brothers would have room to
grow. We got dogs and everything was going pretty good.I had no bad
feelings about this house. I was extremely comfortable and let my guard
down (in the old house my guard was so up i could tell when someone was
coming down the hall or even going into different rooms) We have a
golden retriever named Ivory...she's very very protective of me and my
brothers. Well I was asleep in my room i would guess somewhere around 3
am I was dreaming...My family and I (mom, dad, nathan, dustin, and
grandma) were outside on the back porch. Ivory was there and so was
Tanner (our pit like dog) I was in the porch swing and Tanner had
jumped up there with me Ivory was on the porch sleeping. Mom dad and
grandma were sitting in the chairs and the boys were playing on the
trampoline. well one by one everyone goes inside til its just me and
dad. Then he gets up and goes inside. well i get up and go inside to
get a drink then i go back out side. I call to Ivory and usualy she'll
either look at me with that bored..."what do you want know" look or
she'll just wag her tail. well she didnt do either of those things. so
i call to her again and this time i lean over and touch her. She's
cold. I go inside and tell my dad that she's dead. He goes out and
confirms it then we go get some blankets and wrap her up and we bury
her on the edge of our property near a magnolia tree(magnolia's are my
favorite) well wel bury her and go inside. its night time now and i'm
in bed (still dreaming) and i hear the back door open (We have the
latch handle doors and Ivory can open them...if only she'll learn to
close the door) then i hear scratching at my door and then my door
opens. i dont think anything of it til this smell reaches me...the
smell of decay. it was horrible i open my eyes thinking damn Ivory what
have you rolled in now? there she is standing right next to me
bed...like she's been dead for months...i can see her heart...it was
coverd with worms. then i wake up and my grandma walks in to wake me up
and the first thing she says is what died in here? Well what i didnt
know was that they made an appt with the vet and Ivory has hear worms.
And my last and final story (sorry i didnt think it would take this
long) In the same house as the last story it was just me and my grandma
(my dad was working out of town so mom and the boys were visiting) and
Ivory stayed inside with us (unusual cause she'd rather be outside
unless i'm home alone for a couple of days) Nothing unusal had occured
in several months since that dream...other than family problems
centered around me and mom (we found out that she was sick and was
becoming increasingly violent due to drinking cause by her depression
and anger) well i was asleep in my room (since i've moved out of the
old house my fear of closets has decreased with a few exceptions) I was
sleeping on my side and rolled over in the middle of the night. I kinda
sorta woke up when i felt a slight pressure on my chest. I kinda waved
it off and rolled back over. Well this happend several times til the
pressure was so great i was having difficulty breathing. I opened my
eyes and i was looking strait above me and i didnt see anything (about
that time Ivory started clawing at my door-the house had started to
settle so my door was hard to open-) then i looked down at my chest and
i saw from elbow down of and arm...it was semi see through and a
greenish tint. with long claw like nails...I screamed...I have never
screamed over anything before. then i started struggling and then Ivory
came busting in and was on top of me growling...man she's heavy. well i
make her get out of my room as soon as she calmed down i went back to
bed and immediatly fell asleep. well i woke up around 8 the next
morning grandma was outside smoking and she asked me if i heard
screaming...i told her it might have been me and i told her about the
"dream" i had. then thinking nothing more of it i went inside to change
out of my pjs while i was changing i happend to look down at my chest
and there were 5 half moon marks on my chest...I tried to see if i
could match them with my nails...there was no way i could do that to
myself. <br>
<br>
Oh and i forgot to mention 2 things<br>
1) at the old house when i felt the most scared at night i would see
emerald green eyes looking at me in my room and would immediatly feel
safe. not human animal...wolflike. all my life i've been obsessed with
wolves...if you've any interest in dreams i've got some pretty
interesting ones and i'm pretty good with interpretation.<br>
2) at the old house (there is something wrong with that entire area) My
youngest brother nathan when he was little he would go up to one
tree...only one...and start "talking" to it.<br>

Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia<br>
<br>
By: dwood@ncable.net.au&nbsp; <br>
<br>
I was born in Singapore in 1951 of British and Australian parents. We
lived in various cities in Malaya (now Malaysia) during the 1950&#8217;s,
60&#8216;s and 70&#8217;s.<br>
In 1957 we arrived in Kuala Lumpur, where we stayed until mid 1975. We
moved into a company owned house at Freeman Road Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.<br>
The history of the house is as follows:&nbsp; <br>
It and the house next door, (no 17) were built just before WW II by the
late Dato Gunn Lay Teik, a then well known Architect. ( who, became an
early Malaysian High Commissioner to either Australia or Canada.)<br>
He built them for his daughters.<br>
During WW II, the two houses along with a large semi detached house
immediately behind, on what was then known as Golf View Road, were
taken over by the Japanese Army&#8217;s Secret Police, known as the
&#8220;Kempetai.&#8221; (equivalent of the Nazi Gestapo) <br>
The 2 houses behind were used as Kempai Tai offices and the three in Jalan Freeman became Senior Military officer&#8217;s brothels.<br>
The women in the brothels were both Asian and European, the latter
being drawn from a pool of captured civilians and military nurses.
(&#8221;Comfort women&#8221; was the term used by the Japanese)&nbsp; <br>
Male military P.O.W&#8217;s were used as gardeners and cooks etc. <br>
These &#8220;staff,&#8221; if they fell from favour, were executed and some were
obviously buried in the ground surrounding the houses as some years
later we did find scattered human remains when excavating the gardens
for new orchid beds etc. On the advice of our Doctor who identified
them as human in origin, we quietly re buried the remains. He said that
if word got out as to what we had found, we would never get any Malay
or Chinese domestic staff to work for us.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
After the war, the houses were returned to their owners who, knowing
what the Japanese had used them for, promptly put them up for sale. <br>
They were all bought by large company&#8217;s (at bargain prices,) who used them to house senior expatriate staff.<br>
Gunn Lay Teik was no different and in 1947, sold his 2 houses to the
company my father worked for, for $ Malay 36,000. (At that time, around
11,000 Aust pounds each.) <br>
They 2 company houses were 3 bedroomed houses, of 2 storey, double
brick construction. There was also a long narrow room forming a roof
over the carport at the front door. This room was to play a significant
role in what we were to experience over the following 10 years.<br>
In our house, this room was turned into a large walk in linen press and
storage area. To enter it one took one step down. When we moved into
the house in early 1957, the first thing my mother noticed was that
this room was extremely cold, as if it was air-conditioned. In tropical
Malaya, a non air-conditioned room this cold, is not normal.<br>
Our dogs would never go into this room and when passing the entrance to
that room, always hurried past with tails between their legs. One could
never really stay in that room for very long. It had a very
uncomfortable atmosphere. <br>
However sometimes after running around playing and getting very hot, I
would go and sit on the step at the entrance to the room, to cool off.
(I was 5 years old and knew nothing about ghosts at this time.)&nbsp; <br>
The main bedroom, on the extreme right had side of the upstairs part of
the house (as one faced out towards the main road) had its own full
bathroom and the other 2, also upstairs shared a bathroom via separate
doors leading from the bedrooms to the bathroom. These latter 2 were
adjoining each other. One was on the extreme left hand side of the
house and the other at the back with windows looking out over the back
lawn. This eventually became my room. <br>
All doors were heavy, solid teak with solid brass latches. Windows were
hinged teak framed and had a bamboo awning type blind that rolled down
over the window to give shade from the sun.<br>
Downstairs was a separate formal dining room, lounge room, kitchen,
toilet and downstairs storage room as well as a storage area under the
stair case.&nbsp; The lounge room opened up onto a rear verandah area
(remember the temperature was over 85 degrees F plus all year round.) <br>
As per usual European Expatriate practice of the times in India,
Malaya, Indonesia and Hong Kong, expats had domestic servants to look
after the house hold chores. All expat houses built prior to the early
1960&#8217;s had separate servants quarters on the property. This house had a
3 roomed building, with shared kitchen and bathroom/toilet and car
garage building sited at the rear of the property, about 20 meters from
the main
house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
About 3 months after we moved in, funny things started to happen.<br>
The first incident was the appearance of a white cat, which followed
the LAST person who went into my parent&#8217;s bedroom at night. (the
bedroom at the right hand side of the house)&nbsp; <br>
This cat made no sound, but appeared from nowhere and scuttled into the
room as the door was opened. (This bedroom was air-conditioned.) A
thorough search of the room failed to find the cat, but next night,
there it was, entering again. (at the time, we had no cats.) <br>
This cat was seen every night until my parents moved to the middle
bedroom, which was nearer to the room that my younger sister and I
shared. Their old bedroom was then turned into a guest&#8217;s room. Over the
years, visiting guests who stayed over night with us, also saw the cat.<br>
Then one evening when we returned from an evening out to find a heavy,
teak cupboard normally in the upstairs passage was at the bottom of the
stairs, just inside the front door. It took 6 men to carry this piece
of furniture upstairs next day.<br>
This cupboard &#8220;walked &#8220; downstairs many times over our occupation
period. Sometimes it &#8220;walked&#8221; during the night when all were asleep,
other times during the day when everyone was out.<br>
One evening, about dusk, my mother, looking through the lounge window,
witnessed a woman with long red hair, wearing a sort of white night
gown, standing near the front gate. She thought that this was unusual
and walked out the front door to go talk to the woman. As she walked
across the lawn, the woman walked away and went behind the hedge, which
formed our front fence. When my mother got to the gate, she looked in
the direction that the woman had walked and saw nothing.<br>
Three nights later, my father saw the same woman walking into the entrance of the servants&#8217; quarters. <br>
He followed her but found no sign of her when he entered the building.
She was never actually seen in our house, only on the front and back
lawn and in the servants&#8217; quarters. But she was regularly seen in the
house next door (number 13) and also in one of the houses behind. <br>
The occupants of both these latter houses often saw her sitting on the
edge of the bed brushing her hair. But there was never a reflection in
the mirror. When spoken to, she would turn her head, smile and slowly
fade from view.<br>
We also saw an emaciated man in a military uniform.&nbsp; He was seen
in our house, both upstairs and downstairs as well as outside.<br>
One evening my mother saw what appeared to be a body lying under a
shroud, in the front garden. About 8 years later, I also saw this
figure, for want of a better word, on the back lawn at first light one
morning and again at about 3.00 a.m. on another morning. (The 2nd time
I thought it was a patch of moonlight on the back lawn, but then
realized later that day, that the moonrise occurred during daylight
hours.) <br>
From time to time, we would also see an old Chinese woman in the lounge
room. She was wearing a white starched linen top with black &#8220;pyjama&#8221;
pants cut in a traditional Chinese style.&nbsp; (This used to be the
standard Chinese domestic staff uniform in the immediate pre and post
WW2 era. We referred to them as &#8220;Black and Whites.&#8221;&nbsp; By the
1960&#8217;s, the next generation of Chinese female domestic staff had
abandoned this tradition for more colourful pyjama suit type clothing.
) <br>
One would look up from reading a paper or book and see this old woman
standing in front of you, smiling, She would then fade quickly from
view. She was only seen in the lounge, in broad daylight, but never
when there were a lot of people around.<br>
I remember one night, being constantly disturbed by a raging
thunderstorm with flashing lightning and loud thunderclaps. Only there
had not been a storm at all. I went out of the room to the bathroom and
noticed that the skies were starlit and clear. But on going back into
the bedroom, found myself being kept awake by this storm. At the time,
being half asleep, it did not occur to me that something was not right
about what I had witnessed. It was only later on thinking about what
had happened did I realise that it had been several days since we had
had a thunderstorm.<br>
Many times my mother also witnessed a heavy, black material bound
telephone cord (the telephones in those days were large, heavy, black
&#8220;Bakelite&#8221; units. The cords were very stiff.) swinging back and forward
violently through a 180 degree arc. <br>
If she ever took an afternoon nap, she was frequently disturbed by the
sound of a small trumpet like horn being blown in her ear. She also
used to have her permed, curly hair, pulled quite hard when she was
brushing it.<br>
Sometimes we were disturbed by the sound of sand being thrown against
the bedroom windows, but there was never any sign of sand on the lawn
under the window concerned. This sound used to go on for hours at
times, but could only be heard by someone who was in the room. If we
sent someone outside to look, the sound could be heard from inside, but
the person standing outside would witness nothing.&nbsp; <br>
Periodically, closed doors would open and shut. All door handles in the
house were of a lever type. We would see the lever move to open the
door. If you put your hand on the door handle as or just after this
happened, invariably one would feel a warm hand underneath yours and
you could not move the door handle in the opposite direction. This
never lasted longer than some 20 seconds or so and the handle would
become free again and the feeling of the warm hand would cease.<br>
From time to time, we would hear sounds from the kitchen after the
servants had finished for the night. Investigation would often find all
elements on the electric stove turned on. <br>
We later had an LPG stove put in and the problems ceased, but not the
noises. We often heard the sound of pots and pans clashing and clanging
during the night and also the sound of a large number of China plates
being dropped and broken, but all was in order when we went to
investigate. After a while, we ignored the sound.<br>
It was quite common in my bedroom, to feel the bed being gently rocked,
this was quite soothing and usually sent one off to sleep.<br>
Periodically, the door from my room that opened into the bathroom,
would be violently hit from the bathroom side. Remember that these were
solid teak and very heavy and were fastened with solid brass sliding
bolts.&nbsp; The blow was very loud and the door would actually bend
toward you as it was hit. <br>
My father is a big, heavy man and he tried throwing his weight
violently against this door once. He did not move it and when he
contacted it, the sound was that of a muffled thud. Quite insignificant
when compared to the sound of the blow that the unknown and unseen
entity gave.&nbsp; I always thought that the door was being kicked, but
a &#8220;mere mortal&#8221; would break his foot if he kicked the door that hard<br>
One evening, when in my mid teens, I arrived home from visiting a
friend. As I walked down the drive, I noticed that the lounge room was
lit up and a man with shiny, neatly combed black hair and wearing a
khaki uniform, was sitting in a chair, with his back to the window and
reading what appeared to be a newspaper. I got the impression that he
was Asian and thought he was a friend of my father come to visit.<br>
(Later I recollected that the furniture I the room was different to what we had in there.) <br>
On entering the house, I found the whole house, including the lounge,
to be in darkness, the rest of the family having gone out and the
servants retired for the night.<br>
Thinking back, I think this man was probably a Japanese Military officer. I only experienced this once and my parents never did.<br>
From time to time we would also hear a woman&#8217;s voice calling out in
terror and being answered by a raised male voice. Both were speaking in
a language we did not understand (my father learnt Japanese a few years
after we moved in and one day suddenly realized he understood what was
being said. The woman was calling out &#8220;No, No, please no, not that&#8221; and
the male voice was rebuking her for some misdemeanor.) <br>
It was then that my parents realised that what we had seen and
experienced were most likely the spirits of those who suffered
there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
After finding this out, we began to suspect that the cold room I
described earlier in this narrative may have been used as a place for
the ill treatment and execution of prisoners. <br>
My father learnt that after the war, health authorities advised that
the original septic tank was too close to the house and a new one had
to be installed.&nbsp; While digging the new pit, workers had dug up
human remains. <br>
We left the house in 1967 to move to a new house nearby. The next
occupant, also working for the same company, also experienced funny
things but did not actually see anything strange. <br>
The family who occupied no 17, experienced similar goings on. The woman
with long red hair was sometimes seen in their master bedroom. <br>
They also used to see a small Japanese Army truck, with open rear tray
area, driving up their driveway. In the back were 6 Japanese soldiers
sitting, 3 a side, facing in towards the middle, rifles between their
knees. When someone went outside to investigate, the truck and
occupants had vanished. <br>
The family&#8217;s (in no 17) dogs on several occasions, also dug up human
bones from the garden. In the interests of preserving the local peace,
they also quietly re buried the remains and said nothing. I did not
find out about what they had experienced until many years after they
had left Malaysia and returned to England.&nbsp; <br>
The company sold the houses in the mid 1970&#8217;s after my family had left
Malaysia. The houses at 15 and 17 were torn down and a large mansion
built across the boundaries of both properties.&nbsp; However, this was
demolished after a few years and since then the 2 blocks have remained
vacant. In 2008, they are STILL vacant. This is prime land in an inner
suburban area, but the land is still vacant.<br>
The house at no 13 is still standing, but is abandoned and &frac12; the roof has collapsed.<br>
We wonder just what was found when the site was excavated for the new building.<br>
Also, the reason why the new mansion was also demolished and the blocks
left vacant? Maybe the souls of those poor victims still occupy the
site and are not at rest and re appeared in the new building.<br>

Harry<br>
<br>
By: beth@iipva.com<br>
<br>
&nbsp;I was raised in South Hadley, Massachusetts.&nbsp; My story is a
100% true story and there are many witnesses who have seen or at least
heard our ghost Harry! My mom bought her house from her brother when he
divorced and that is where Harry resides. MA. Anyways...as very young
children my cousins and I played at their house and witnessed crayons
flying through the air, doors opening and closing, radio turning on and
off...we saw alot and we told our parents scared half to death. They
never believed us kids saying to knock it off and go play. Well when my
mother bought the house and my brother and I moved out my mom saw some
strange happening of her own. She could not accuse us kids of hiding
things on her and trying to make her crazy! LOL! We had grown up and
moved out. Well I lived w/ her for awhile w/ my oldest son and he was
such a scary cat we had to think of a name for our ghost so my son did
not know what we were talking about for fear of him never being able to
sleep again. Harry seems to be a friendly enough ghost. He has never
harmed anyone that I am aware of. He almost gave my husband a heart
attack because my hubby was a non believer of ghost. Well it didn't
take him knowing me long to figure out that Harry was VERY real. His
first sighting of something strange was when I dropped off my middle
son at his dads and he had left his plastic bag of cars in the middle
of the floor. My hubby went to pick it up and saw what appeared to be
invisible hands rummaging through the bag of matchbox cars. There was
no other explanation. He had to believe. Then we moved in w/ mom for
awhile and the chimes would chime all by themselves...things go missing
and reappear all of the time. My mom used to think we hid things on
her. One night we heard walking in my moms room above us at like 3am.
Why would she be up. We were laying in our bed and when we looked up
thinking it would be mom there was a whitish gray form at the bottom of
my bed. We hid under the covers so afraid. Nothing happened...no harm
anyways...Harry lives w/ my mom still and she has been all by herself
for over 25 years and Harry acts up mostly when my brother or I (who
now live in VA) go home for a visit. I feel like he gets jealous and
acts up. Like a kid for attention. Many of other crazy things happen w/
Harry around. Just thought I would like to share that<br>

Our Apartment<br>
<br>

I recently came across the website: theshadowlands.net.&nbsp; I was
shocked to see that in Lovejoy, GA there were apparitions.&nbsp; I too
had an experience but didn&#8217;t think much about it.&nbsp; Especially
after everybody looked at us (my mother in law also saw it) as if we
were crazy.<br>
We used to live in a new apartment complex.&nbsp; One day I was sitting
on the counter eating lunch and my mother in law was in the living
room.&nbsp; As she came towards me to get to the kitchen, we both saw a
man going towards the room at the end of the hall.&nbsp; Our first
instinct was that one had broken into the apartment.&nbsp; We did get a
chill, but at the time we didn&#8217;t seem it was a big deal, we just
figured it was the fact that we had gotten scared.&nbsp; I grabbed the
phone and we walked towards the hallway, when we looked, we saw
nobody.&nbsp; We thought they had gone into the bathroom or the laundry
room.&nbsp; When we saw nobody, we looked in the closet of the room,
but again didn&#8217;t see anybody.<br>
After we came to our senses, we realized that nobody could have entered
because we would have heard the door and the alarm go off.<br>
Two guys that slept in that room told us afterwards that they would
have trouble sleeping for a long time.&nbsp; On occasion, they would
here the water running, but they thought it was the other one.&nbsp;
After sharing these experiences, we came to the conclusion that this
was paranormal.&nbsp; <br>
We called the leasing office and asked them if anything had happened in
that apartment or if they knew of thing of this nature in that
area.&nbsp; They obviously thought we were crazy and replied that they
didn&#8217;t know anything.<br>
Now that I have found this, I feel relieve that now thanks to this, my
family believe us.&nbsp; Far be it to say that when our lease expired,
we moved out.<br>
Thank you for&nbsp; letting me share my story.<br>

Disturbance<br>
<br>
By: rkbagrisham@att.net<br>
<br>
There is allot of things in my life I have seen over the years but
nothing has ever disturbed me quite like this. It was the weekend of
break for myself and my mom and we decided to go up to OK. City to see
my cousins. Everything was great I got to see some relatives and
nothing seemed out of the normal. That is as far as normal went that
night. While taking the 4 hour drive back..( about that much ), I
noticed that the moon was very huge and blood red. Course I didn't know
about the eclipse that day so if was cool to watch as we drove to
Farris, which is a tiny town between Lane and Antlers.&nbsp; I remember
that my mother pulled onto the veterans bridge in Atoka when a couple
miles down the road I happened to look up and a elderly couple was
standing on the side of the road staring across as if watching
something. It reminded me of the Grant Wood painting of the farmer. I
remember looking at the clock a moment before and saw it was midnight.
The moon was still out and still red. What makes it worse for myself is
that my mother also caught a glimpse of them. I turned around shocked
and sure if I turned around they would be flying behind us screaming.
I've passed by several times since then and every time I get a shiver
up my spine remembering what happened. I am teased a bit because I
cover my eyes and wait till we pass the bridge and get into Lane.<br>

I Wonder What is Waiting<br>
<br>
By: lets2fish2000@yahoo.com<br>
&nbsp; My dog and I have been traveling the mountains of upstate NY and
Pa for Seventeen Years. So when he left me last Feb 2007, I brought him
to his favorite spot. There was still snow on the ground and tracking
though the woods at this time was very difficult. I tried to break
ground with the pick that I carried, but the ground would not permit
me. I found a nice spot and laid him under some brush beneith some
trees. I told dillon i would be back.<br>
&nbsp; Three weeks past before i was able to get back to him. When I
was driving up the dirt road all i cound think about was how I was
going to find him. Being where i laid him down I thought I'd find him
in pieces,( was getting sick to my stomack.) He was my boy and this had
to be done. <br>
&nbsp; When I reached him it was just like i laid him down, thought
this was wierd, he wasn't even stiff. It was like he was waiting for me
to come back. It was nice being with him again even though he had
passed. The rest of the afternoon off and on i dug his grave, going
very deep so the wild animals couldn't dig him up. I Took off my coat
and wrapped it around him and laid him in his grave. Dusk was setting
in and all of a sudden i herd children moving all around me laughing
and giggling. I knew this wasn't natural for children to be where we
were, for the closest house was at least ten miles away. I still
dismissed this in my mind as the circle they were using around me kept
getting smaller. I would stop every now and than and lessen, but i
could hear no breaking branches which should have been happening. Thank
God I already had a cross i made, for night was now apon me.<br>
&nbsp; When I was tracking up the mountain tword my car these spirts
were in a horseshoe behind me. Every now and than i would turn around
to keep them behind me, but this still didn't stop the giggling.(Never
herd this type of laughter before) When I made the clearing where my
car was the noise finaly stopped. I popped the trunk open to put the
pick and shovel in than I&nbsp; leared over the hood of the car. There
stood Five solid white entites at the edge of the woods. They were not
children.<br>
&nbsp; For the past eleven months I have been visiting his grave to
make sure his resting place is kept up and confortable.Each time im
there they appear to me. I have been tossed six feet in the air once, a
dark figure has drifted accross the opening, another time this figure
was floating seven yards from me, herd bull frogs croaking the english
language, items inside my car gone when i returned, my usa cap taken
and found it the next time on dillons cross. <br>
&nbsp; I'm an educated man im not crazy, can't talk to anyone about
this without people thinking im wierd or mentally disturbed. I know
what has and will continue to show themselfs to me.<br>
&nbsp; I'm going to say my final goodbye to him at the end of this
month, for im going to relocate to a different area for my accounting
career. I wonder whats going to be waiting for me this time?<br>

Poet Seat Tower, Greenfield MA<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
<br>
Please allow me to tell a little history in order for the reader to
have an understanding of my event. The town of Greenfield was populated
with Pocumtuck Indians, when it was first settled by white man in 1686.
The settlers were repeatedly attacked in those early years. Parts of
the city of Greenfield have beautiful views, and non better that what
is viewed from the Poet Seat Tower on the Rocky Mountain, part of the
Pocumtuck Range that runs along side of the Connecticut River. A three
floored tall sandstone observation tower was built in honor of the poet
F. Tuckerman 1821-1873. <br>
Back in 1966 when I was 17 we frequently parked at the first lookout,
and climbed the dirt path up to the tower. At that time there was no
light other then the moon, and our dates would often try to scare us
girls with many different stupid acts. I had done this trip as many as
30-40 times in my teen years and it took a lot to make me nervous. On
this summer night I was there with my date and another couple. The
other couple had been fighting back and forth all night, and were some
distance ahead of us. We started to hear screams, like from several
different people all at once, weird, as we were the only car there.
Then she came running back to us screaming and hard to understand, she
was shaking and pulling on us, so it was hard for us to take in what
she was saying. She was trying to tell us that he had been pushed off
the rock edge. Now we are running up to the tower, but still think she
is pulling a fast one on us wit h her boyfriend. After all, she would
never push him off and we were the only ones parked there that night.
But the thing was, we didn't find him and after a search (it was very
dark), she wanted to report what she had seen to the police. Be sure,
that was the last thing we wanted to do, but he was missing, and she
was really frightened. I was shocked when sitting with her at a police
table as she told them what she had seen. She was a few steps behind
him, and he was facing her, saying some harsh words, when from behind
her figures ran past her and gave him a shove and she clearly saw
several people fall from that rocky cliff. There were crys, howls and
screams all around her (we had heard that too). A search was started,
and all of our parents were called, the next afternoon he was found,
but there was no evidence of anyone else. He was badly hurt but still
alive, months and then years later he never fully recovered, and was no
longer able to think quite &amp; nbsp;rationally. What the officer was
repeatingly asking for was a description of the individuals she had
seen and she kept saying that it was cavemen, wild hair and little to
no clothes, many bare bodies. Years later, she had never changed her
story. I saw her not long ago, now over forty years have passed, she
quietly said I think it was Indians................... you
know.............ghosts..........<br>

Pottersville N.J.<br>
<br>
By: lednlinda@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
It was about 1975 and my friend, Charlene who lived in Chester N.J. as
my neighbor inherited her Grandmothers house right in the center of
Pottersville, N.J. right across the street from a garage.<br>
Charlene had called me and told me to stop by any time and see what she
had done to the place. One morning me and my two sons drove to
Pottersville for a visit. They looked forward to playing with her boy
Ron. <br>
When we arrived we got out of the car and walked to the front porch.
The porch was concrete and had steps going up and down on both sides.
We three stood on the porch and knocked on the door. No answer. I tried
to look in the porch door window which was big but had a sheer curtain
covering it. We also listened for a minute because her children were
rambunctious and I new they would be noisy. Yet, it was very quiet. My
boys ran back to the car and I walked down the other set of steps to
peer into the dinning room. I could see all the way from the dinning
area to the kitchen. It was a nice old house but no people. As I walked
back up the steps and looked at the front door window I saw that the
curtains were pulled back as if hands were parting the curtains yet
know one was in the window! Just as suddenly as they were parted, they
slammed shut! It was really spooky and it scared&nbsp; me so much that
I never went back!<br>

Haunting<br>
<br>
By: digmedia_forensics@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I used to live in a trailor in Jacksonville, Alabama. It is located on
private land that also has a creek and a private family cemetery lot. I
had several paranormal experiences while living there. I lived there
for 2 years. Throughout the 2 years, many weird things happened to me
and my 1 year old daughter at the time.<br>
There was a spirit that use to play with my daughter's toys when no one
was in the room and when she was like 1 and 2 yrs. old, she used to
play with it and talk to it. I never saw it. I saw a beam of light
shoot across the livingroom. One night we heard banging on the side of
the trailor like someone was hitting it with a piece of wood or a
hammer. It started at one end, then when I went to check out the sound
in that room, it shot across to the other side, each time I ran back
and forth to see if someone was out there and each time it would change
ends of the trailor that it was hitting. At the same time that was
happening, I heard footsteps running across the top of the trailor. I
called the cops of course because at that time, my ex was harassing me
and stocking me, but it wasn't him. The cops drew their weapons and
went through the trailor and got on top of the roof of the trailor and
searched all of the land (there were like 4 or 5 cops up there at that
time)...no one found anything disturbed...no footprints...nothing!!!
They did find a 2 x 4 on top of the roof of my trailor. <br>
Oh yeah, then one night, my daughter was asleep in my bed, which my
room was right next to the living room. I was at the table in the
living room reading. I used to turn off all my daughter's toys
everynight so the batteries wouldn't run down. She had one of those
Leap Frog activity tables and that thing would go off every night.
Well, one night I took the batteries out...and it turned itself on.
Then that same night, I was sitting at the table and I heard this
carousel music playing like something you'd hear on a horse carousel. I
searched the whole trailor trying to locate that sound. Well, the very
last thing that I thought about checking was this Peter the Rabbit
jewelry box I had bought for her because her room was done in Peter
Rabbit when she was a baby. Well, it was still in the original box and
packaging because I was saving it for her. Well, when I opened it, it
started playing THE EXACT SAME MUSIC THAT I HEARD!!!! <br>
I don't know if anything ever happened in that trailor. I have always
assumed that it was spirits buried in the cemetery. The trailor is set
off the to the side of the road and is on a private dirt road. Living
there, we were the only LIVING souls on that road!<br>

Mining sounds heard deep underground at night.<br>
They would be heard when in bed from underneath the house. I thought they<br>
where dreams, but years later my daughter then 3-5 years old recounted the<br>
exaxt same sounds (rocks breaking and carts rolling) when I asked her (now<br>
13 years old). From 1997 to 2000.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

Yorktown, Va: Battlefield&nbsp; While in the US Coast Guard I was
stationed at Yorktown for two months for "A" school.&nbsp; The Coast
Guard base was built actually on the battlefield.&nbsp; You walk out of
some of the barracks and across the parking lot are trenches used by
the soldiers.&nbsp; One of the things we did was stand watch at night,
and when standing watch we went around the buildings to make sure
everything was still secured.&nbsp; While standing watch (I had the
2:00am to 4:00am watch) I walked out of one of the barracks and heard a
musket fire, followed quickly by another.&nbsp; The sound a musket
makes when fired is different than a modern rifle, and it was WAY too
late for the Gunners Mates to be playing around. It was also too late
for anyone to be reenacting on the battlefield.&nbsp; The volume of
musket fire rose and I could actually hear ranks firing at the same
time, answered by another volley.&nbsp; Cannon could also be
heard&nbsp; plainly in the mix.&nbsp; I started walking towards the
officers quarters across the street thinking that one of the officers,
who live in the nice large houses on base, fell asleep while watching
the Patriot with his surround sound cranked up.&nbsp; As I got closer
to the officer housing I realized the sound of battle was clearly
coming from the nearby battlefield.&nbsp; I listened to this going on
for about 20 minutes.<br>

Scared the Wits Out of Me<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
<br>
Anyway, this is only one of the stories. I have other ones my mother's
told me, but I wanna tell this one because it happened to me
personally. I also have a few others that are a little more personal
and emotional and I don't think I'm ready to tell them yet. <br>
Ok! This happened to me in 5th grade, and it scared the wits out of me. <br>
Our county and the surrounding counties share this place called an
"Outdoor Lab." It's called that because that's basically what it is.
It's a house in the forest with a big lake, and kids go there with
their science classes to do experiments, play, learn about leadership
through surviving in the "wild," stuff like that. Well, our county had
this thing where all the 5th graders had to do an over-night at the
Outdoor Lab. Each school was at the Lab at a different time, but either
way, if you were a 5th grader in my county, you had to have spent a
night at the Outdoor Lab. <br>
It started out really fun. Since we were there over-night, we got to do
bigger and more fun experiments. The day was fun and everyone was
really excited. <br>
A layout of the Lab is as follows, I haven't been in a long time so
it's fuzzy but I remember the main components. We would have to walk
from where the bus parked to the Lab. There was a building which was
the main building, where we kept our supplies for experiments, where
there were tables for us to eat, and where the offices were, of the
people who worked there. Next to the building is a hugeeeee lake.
Beyond that are trees, trees, bushes, and trees. Further down away from
the main building and the lake is another building. It's long because
it is the boys bathroom, girl's bathroom, and "zoo," all in one. Well
each section is cut off from the other, but you get the idea. Then
beyond that is a river/creek/stream thing, I don't know, and a small
bridge, and beyond all that, amongst the trees, are smaller bridges and
streams and stuff. The basic woodsy type thing. Where we were sleeping
that night was off to the far, far right of the bathrooms/zoo. The boys
slept on the side of the bathrooms, while the girls had to cross a
bridge over to the other side of the stream/river/creek thing. Everyone
was given a tent and given time to "dibs" a place to put up the tent.
Then we went around a bit and before we went to sleep we were given
more time to pitch the tent, get out our sleeping bags, etc. I don't
know why! But for some reason, my friends and I decided to take the
spot closest to the woods! I mean, this was during the time of the
"Blair Witch Project" and such stuff, and we were in 5th grade. We
thought it was cool!<br>
Anyway, that night was really really fun. The people who worked at the
Lab took us on a night tour, everyone was rowdy, happy. We got to sit
in a huge tent and pretend to have a meeting like Native Americans used
to do. No one was tired or anything! <br>
Then came sleeping time. It was three to a tent, and I remember I slept
on the far right. At some point, one of my friends, I don't remember
which but for some reason I think it was Jen, tried to wake me up and
asked me to go to the bathroom with her. I, being stupid and lazy and
sleepy, pretended not to wake up. So she turned around and asked my
other friend to go. After they left, I felt really bad about not going,
and I was too scared to go back to sleep on my own, so I sat up and
waited for them to come back. I sat there for, I don't know how long,
when all of a sudden I heard someone mess with the tent, like, touch
it, I don't know. Then the tent zipper started to go up, really, really
slowly. And I did not think it was funny! I yelled out at my friends,
but they didn't answer. So I took my flashlight and shined it at the
tent's zipper, and I didn't see anything. No shadow, no form, no
nothing. So I'm freaking out. Because I was only 10 at the time, at
first I thought it was a bear. We were warned not to have food in our
tent because it'll attract bears, and of course we didn't listen and
had food. But I really really freaked out when I didn't get a shadow or
anything after shining the flashlight. I kept the flashlight shining at
the same point for a few seconds, and the zipper kept going up, but
then I heard my friends calling me from the bridge. They sounded really
far away because I was really scared. About two minutes later they tore
open the tent zipper and asked if I was ok. Of course I wasn't OK! They
told me that as they were walking back to the tent, they shined their
flashlight into the woods and by chance they saw a large shadow in the
form of a man standing, hovering over the tent with his hand touching
it. I told them that it couldn't have been a "shadow" because I shined
my light right at the tent's zipper and didn't see anything. They asked
me if I'd heard anything before the zipper went up, and I said no. Now,
in our tent looking out, to our back is the river, to our right are
other tents, and to our left is the huge huge forest. My friends got me
to lie back down and I don't remember if I went back to sleep. But I've
thought about it ever since! <br>
I guess it could've been one of the other girls, or a boy, but I
honestly did not hear any movement outside. Since I was waiting for my
friends to come back, I was listening really hard so that as soon as I
heard them I'd be able to lie back down. I didn't hear anything before
or after, the only sound I heard was the zipper being pulled up. I was
soo scared. Maybe because I was only in 5th grade, my imagination might
have exaggerated itself a bit and it was really a person playing a
prank on me. Because my friends said that when they yelled for me on
the brigde, it's not like the shadow disappeared, I think it just ran
into the woods.</big><br>
