<P>
<P><B>OK, here is my own ghost story.  It is true.  When I was 5 , I had
a strange dream.</B>
<P><B>I saw my grandfather lying in a hospital bed, IV's, respirator, and
all.  I glanced around the room to see my aunt Gin sitting in one of the
chairs holding my grandmother's hand.  I woke up.  After getting up to go
to the restroom and get a drink of water, I returned to my room.  I lay down
in my bed and turned over to face my window.  I saw my grandfather walk from
my closet door(which was adjacent to said window)and sit on the edge of my
bed.  He spoke to me for about 15 minutes, then he told me to wake my mother
to answer the telephone. He kissed my cheek and told me goodbye.  He turned
to the closet door, and faded into it.  I got out of bed just as the telephone
started to ring.  My aunt was on the other end and told us that grandpa had
just died about 15 minutes ago.  That was 20 years ago.  His spirit stayed
at my parents house till I moved into my own.  We moved imy house on Halloween,
and so did Grandpa.  I'll see him sitting by my daughter's crib watching
over her, just like he used to do to me.</B>

<H3><A NAME=church>Old Church Ghosts</A>
</H3><P><B>by hedra1@brigadoon.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>I have some strange stories about the building in which I work.  It
used to</B>
<P><B>be an old Christian Reformed church, built sometime in the 1800's.
 Today</B>
<P><B>it is a software company where I work.  Our office are located in the</B>
<P><B>basement.  Part of the remodeling process was to make the building
look</B>
<P><B>more like an office, than a church.  This meant removing the cross
on the</B>
<P><B>steepled roof.  The contracter whacked it off with a saw, with no
ceremony.</B>
<P><B> Ever since then, we have had computer hardware vanish, and the brand
new</B>
<P><B>phone system seems to be controlled by a prankish poltergeist.  Many
times</B>
<P><B>I have been working in the production, and turned to reach for a part
and</B>
<P><B>found that it had disappeared.  Only to turn around and find it in
plain</B>
<P><B>sight.  Every once or twice a month I have seen apparitions appear
and then</B>
<P><B>duck around corners or up the stairs.  I don't know the history of
the</B>
<P><B>church, as I am not from the community, but I am sure that this old
church</B>
<P><B>has lots of ghosts.  I am sure that this is related to the fact that
this</B>
<P><B>is the first time the building has been used for non-religious
purposes.</B>

<H3><A NAME=strange>The Strange Figure</A>
</H3><P><B>by maturi@generation.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Although many believe this story to be untrue, my brother and I know
it</B>
<P><B>is.....</B>
<P><B>	This story started a few years ago, when my older cousin died from</B>
<P><B>cancer.It was the night my cousin died, my brother saw her. He had
gone</B>
<P><B>to bed, but, awoke to a strange feeling. He said he saw her standing</B>
<P><B>there and waving, as if to say farewell. The scary part is that she
and</B>
<P><B>my brother had been very close and this frightened him, though I 'm
not</B>
<P><B>sure why.</B>
<P><B>	The event repeated itself over and over, until my FAVORITE uncle
died,</B>
<P><B>then it happened to me.But the strange thing about this story isn't
that</B>
<P><B>because they were our favorite family memebers they bid farewell only
to</B>
<P><B>us. The strange thing about this story is that even relatives that</B>
<P><B>weren't our favorites kept saying good bye ONLY to my brother and I.</B>
<P><B>	We used to mind but it has grown on us by now, so we did not seek
any</B>
<P><B>help for this paranormal activity. We would have however if the
figures</B>
<P><B>would have harmed us in any manner.</B>

<H3><A NAME=stranger>Stranger in My Room</A>
</H3><P><B>by &nbsp;jeuans@jcn1.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>When my second husband and I were married about 6 months we moved into
a</B>
<P><B>garage next door to my in-law's house.  The garage was basically a
small</B>
<P><B>house that they had lived in before building the larger house next
door. </B>
<P><B>My husband had lived there prior to our meeting each other.  We slept
in a</B>
<P><B>full size bed next to a wall with a small path that separated our bed
from</B>
<P><B>our son's crib.  He was a small infant at this time. My husband slept
next</B>
<P><B>to the wall and I slept by the path to have access to my son if he
happened</B>
<P><B>to wake up during the night.  At approximately 3:00 a.m. on this
particular</B>
<P><B>night, I suddenly work up for no apparent reason.  I was facing my</B>
<P><B>husband's back and he was facing the wall, still sleeping.  I listened
for</B>
<P><B>sounds, thinking my son might have made a noise and woke me, but I
heard</B>
<P><B>none.  Then I felt the hair on the back of neck starting to raise up
as if</B>
<P><B>from fear.  But at that time I wasn't afraid of anything.  I'm usually
not</B>
<P><B>a fearful person.  I then felt the side of the bed next to me,by the</B>
<P><B>pathway, start to go down toward the floor, as if someone was sitting
down</B>
<P><B>on it.  And then I felt body warmth on my lower back and buttocks area
as</B>
<P><B>if someone was very close to me and I could feel them.  I tried to
turn</B>
<P><B>around to look and see what or who this was, knowing that no one was
in the</B>
<P><B>house but my husband, who was asleep, my son who was an infant, and
myself,</B>
<P><B>but I found I couldn't move.  I then tried to say my husband's name
to wake</B>
<P><B>him so he could look but found I couldn't speak.  The bed then rose
and the</B>
<P><B>warmth started to leave.  This occurred once more within a few seconds
of</B>
<P><B>the first occurrance.  Then the "entity" or what ever it was left and
I</B>
<P><B>could move and then speak.  I did not tell my husband of this until
the</B>
<P><B>following morning.  He and my in-law's believed me as they know I'm
not</B>
<P><B>prone to making up stories of this nature.  I asked if they had ever
heard</B>
<P><B>of anyone dying on the property as they had built both houses on bare
farm</B>
<P><B>land approximately 18 years prior.  They said to their knowledge no
one had</B>
<P><B>ever died there and they had not ever had any experiences themselves
when</B>
<P><B>they lived there.  I have never had this type of experience before
or</B>
<P><B>since.  I have had other odd things happen but I this one was quite
unusual</B>
<P><B>and strange.  We continued to live there for several years until we
had our</B>
<P><B>own house built elsewhere.	</B>
<P><B>  Maybe this will be a help to anyone who has had this type of experience.
</B>
<P><B>I didn't feel threatened in anyway during this experience.</B>

<H3><A NAME=woman>The Woman in the Cemetary</A>
</H3><P><B>by Tina2fan@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have had the same psychic experience for years.  It started when
I was 5 years old, right when we moved into a new town.  I had a dream about
a woman and a cemetary.  She was a very beautiful woman, with long dark hair
and dressed in a gown of white that dragged the ground (possibly a wedding
gown).  The dream would start out with me riding in the passenger's seat
of my grandfather's old van.  We were driving to our old house, and on the
way we would pass the cemetary.  The woman would be walking along the outside
of the cemetary gates, and all I could do is stare, turning my head over
my shoulder until she was completely out of sight.  As I turned my head forward,
I seen that she was now standing in the road and my grandfather ran over
her, well actually the van ran through her.  I would turn my head in total
amazement to look at my grandfather, because I could not believe he had hit
her and had not stopped.  But instead of looking at him, I saw her.  That's
where the dream ended.  For years, I woke up in cold sweats and on the verge
of tears from this nightmare.  I began to associate the dream with the cemetary
by my old house, because it seemed to always come to me after driving by
that cemetary.  When I got my licenses, I avoided that road as much as possible.
 My story does not stop there though......I was talking to my mom one night,
this was about 5 years ago, and we were exchanging experiences.  And I started
to tell her about my dream and about the cemetary.  And before I could describe
the woman to her, my mother had stopped me and describe her.  And then she
had told me the experiences she had had with the woman, only hers were not
a dream.  When my mother was 15, she was pregnant with me.  At the time,
she was living with my dad and my grandparents.  Not all was happy, so she
would walk over to the cemetary to be by herself.  She told me that on many
occasions she would be sitting behind some of the older headstones, that
were tall enough to hide behind.  And she remembers seeing the woman visit
a grave several times.  The woman would walk up to the grave with a handful
of flowers, lay them down, and walk away.  Always wearing the same dress.
 A white gown, that dragged the ground.</B>
<P><B>I know this story seems weird, but it is true.  My heart did all but
stop when my mother was telling me her experiences with the lady.  At that
time, we don't know if she was ghost or not.  My mother said that she looked
real.  I never did any research to see who this woman could be.  I am sending
this to you in the hopes that you might have some knowledge on why my mother
and I had experiences with the same lady, in very different ways.  </B>

<H3><A NAME=adventure>The Architect's Adventure</A>
</H3><P><B>by JEMIRAND@worldnet.att.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi to all you at shadowlands...you posted a story of mine about my</B>
<P><B>grandfather's house and now I have a few minutes to type out an</B>
<P><B>experience that happened about 5 years ago when I was living in North</B>
<P><B>Carolina.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I had a job as an intern architect at a one-man firm in a small town</B>
<P><B>about 30 miles northeast of Raleigh.  A special interest of mine has</B>
<P><B>always been historic preservation, especially old houses, so I
relished</B>
<P><B>the remodelings of the older houses in this little historic town. 
One</B>
<P><B>day my boss gave me the directions to a farmhouse and asked me to go
out</B>
<P><B>and do some fieldwork for a renovation project.  It seems that the</B>
<P><B>farmhouse had a little one-room outbuilding, about fifteen feet by</B>
<P><B>twenty feet now being used for storage, that the owners wanted to
turn</B>
<P><B>into a guest cottage.  I was asked to take photographs in and out and
do</B>
<P><B>some measured drawings of the existing structure -- something to
build</B>
<P><B>our working drawings from.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I found the big, white farmhouse (about 150 years old?) about 20
minutes</B>
<P><B>out of town on a lonely stretch of country road.  It sat, circled by</B>
<P><B>huge trees, surrounded by sunny crop fields which stretched pretty
much</B>
<P><B>as far as the eye could see in all directions.  I parked, went up to
the</B>
<P><B>main house, and rang the doorbell just in case anyone was home,
although</B>
<P><B>I had been told there wouldn't be anyone home at that time of day.
 Sure</B>
<P><B>enough, no one answered, and I saw no one on the property so I walked</B>
<P><B>another 50 yards to the tiny white outbuilding beyond which was in
the</B>
<P><B>open on a grassy slope.  After about 30 minutes of taking photographs</B>
<P><B>and inspecting the structure both in and out, up and down (it had a</B>
<P><B>three-quarter height stone cellar with a dirt floor), I picked up my</B>
<P><B>grid pad, measuring tape and pencil and set to work taking
measurements</B>
<P><B>of the building -- wall thickness, door and window locations --
starting</B>
<P><B>at the only door and working counter-clockwise.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>On such a beautiful day, this type of work can be very meditative,
and</B>
<P><B>in about 20 minutes I had succeeded in plotting and dimensioning most
of</B>
<P><B>the plan.  The only part left was to double-check the squareness of
the</B>
<P><B>building by measuring the diagonals of the room.  The first diagonal
was</B>
<P><B>easily gotten.  The second diagonal required me to work my way
between</B>
<P><B>some storage items, and I was wedged into the corner with my rear-end
in</B>
<P><B>the air and covered with dust and cobwebs when a friendly male voice</B>
<P><B>said loudly, "HEY ya!"</B>
<P>
<P><B>I jumped about six inches off the ground, and in the couple of
seconds</B>
<P><B>it took me to extricate myself before whirling around my first
thought</B>
<P><B>was to be angry that someone would sneak up so quietly and scare the</B>
<P><B>heck out of me.  I turned around to face an empty room -- sunlight</B>
<P><B>streaming in the dusty windows and open door.  I had been so sure
that</B>
<P><B>the voice had come from about five feet behind me, but there was no</B>
<P><B>one.  I had another thought -- that whoever it was had seen me
startle</B>
<P><B>and had retired to the exterior of the building to give me a few
seconds</B>
<P><B>to regain my composure.  I walked to the door -- there was no one on
the</B>
<P><B>steps.  I walked out and completely around the building (and under)
--</B>
<P><B>there was no one in sight.  IN SIGHT!  No one up at the house 50
yards</B>
<P><B>away, no one working in the fields, not even any cars on the road.
 Just</B>
<P><B>a gentle, warm breeze curling around my rapidly goose-bumping flesh.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Needless to say, I finished up my work in under a minute, locked up
and</B>
<P><B>hightailed it back to work.  I told my boss he could forget about me</B>
<P><B>going back -- that place was haunted.  To this day, I can still hear</B>
<P><B>that friendly voice.  That's one ghost that got the best of me --
what</B>
<P><B>might he have said if I'd have been a bit more blase'?  I also regret</B>
<P><B>not speaking with the owner.  I've never found out if there have been</B>
<P><B>other reports of a friendly, if disembodied voice.  So if anyone out</B>
<P><B>there lives around Lewisburg, North Carolina and knows anyone with
a</B>
<P><B>big, white, historic farmhouse with a little outbuilding that sits
down</B>
<P><B>to the right, keep your ears open!</B>

<H3><A NAME=bridge>The Bridge at New Hope, PA</A>
</H3><P><B>by CmdrGarret@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Wow!! I just read your story and it reminded me of some</B>
<P><B>encounters I had a couple of years ago.</B>
<P><B>I am very interested in the paranormal and study up on it as much as
I can.</B>
<P><B>I shall begin by telling you that I am from PA ,Philly to be exact.</B>
<P><B>A friend of mine ,Tara,and myself decided to go to New Hope one
night.</B>
<P><B>Now Tara is very capable of sensing things more than myself.</B>
<P><B>I am not very perceptive so that is why this has stuck in my mind.</B>
<P><B>I will never forget what had happened that night.we were driving down
River Road,</B>
<P><B>One of the main roads into New Hope.It is a very scenic route,we decided
to go to the Bridge.It is a small wood covered bridge in a somewhat residential
area.</B>
<P><B>It is not too far away from The Tower at Washington's Crossing.</B>
<P><B>The Bridge has a supposed history of hauntings,and,well,we love to
investigate the paranormal,so we decided to have a look see.The original
story of the Bridge was that A woman was bieng chased by a confederate solder.The
woman carrying a baby </B>
<P><B>had tossed it into the river , and the soldier murder her.Now the river
is dried up , so there is nothing left except a very small stream.It is said
that if you stand in the Bridge at twelve o"clock midnight that you will
be able to hear a baby crying.</B>
<P><B>We pulled up right before the Bridge and instead of getting out we
stayed in the car.</B>
<P><B>I had pulled over to the left side of the road as to not block any
other vehicles.</B>
<P><B>We sat in the car for awhile talking,and,waiting .I decided that I
had to use the grass to relieve myself.So I got out of the car and did my
thing.as I was getting back into the car I heard this howl.It was very strange
I never heard a dog howl like that before,so it struck me as very eerie.The
howl sounded very distant,but,yet near.I hurried back into the car and asked
Tara if she had heard the howl.Of course she heard it as well,so we sat there
for a bit longer just listening,but,the howling had already stopped.{{{God
writting this is really freaking me out}}}} I noticed something different,but,I
could not pin point what it was.All of a sudden a buzzing sound was coming
from within my car.Now that was impossible because I had my car shut off.</B>
<P><B>The motor was not running nor the battery was not on.The buzzing grew
louder and it sounded like it was coming from the back seat .At this point
my senses picked up and I was getting very nervous.I did not like the feeling
I was getting from the area.</B>
<P><B>So we sat there, in the car ,like a deer caught in a headlights.We
began scoping the area , there was a presence with us,but, it was outside
of the car.We kept looking,trying to pin point it's location by using our
senses, trying to 'feel' where it was.At first it was in front of the car,
then. it was behind the car,then along the side it.Before we knew it the
presence was surrounding the entire car.I will tell you one thing, this presence
was not at all happy.The hair on the back of my neck started to stand up
and I got goosepimples.I knew we had to leave soon or it would be too late.Well
that was what I interpreted from the situation.I felt if I had stayed too
long it would have had us.so I tried to turn the engine over, but it would
not start at first.I began to panic,then finally the engine kicked over and
I made a quik u-turn and sped out of there .I did not stop driving until
we got back home.</B>
<P><B>I believe that for whatever purpose this "thing" had wanted us to stay
and it tried to keep us there.It felt as if it tried to follow us as we
left.</B>
<P><B>That was about two years ago.Now I am freaked out again. I hope to
god I don't have nightmares about it again.</B>
<P><B>I had so many incidents it's not even funny.Tara was my roommate at
the time so we always had some encounter together with something. Now that
I had moved out I do not get to hang out with my dear friend as much,and
I had not any encouters since I had moved.</B>
<P><B>I believe that we ask for the trouble at times considering that we
go out to look for such hauntings .After all we do like to investigate the
paranormal.</B>
<P><B>Well I thought I would share this with you I had to tell someone
about.Everyone else thinks I am crazy.</B>

<H3><A NAME=one>This was a Strange One....</A>
</H3><P><B>by &nbsp;	KJaffen@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My family is like a magnet for the supernatural.  When my mother was13
years old,she was physically abused by her stepfather.  They had recently
moved into a home where an 8 year old child had died in a fire a short while
before.</B>
<P><B>As the stepfather entered my mom's room one night with ill intentions,
hepaused in the doorway, taken back by what he saw.  There was another
childsleeping with my mother in her bed.  The "Child" saved my mother from
serveralnighttime beatings from her stepfather.</B>
<P><B>Around the time my mother was 15 years old her family moved into a
home that reportedly encased the body of a mobster in the corner of the
cement-floored basement.One night my mother awoke from sleep unable to lift
her head off of the pillow.  Herstepfather, in a half drunken/half asleep
state, heard her stifled cries for help.  He entered the bedroom and his
attempts to lift my mother off the bed failed.  She could only lift herself
up from the bed once the lights were turned on.</B>
<P><B>There were incidents in the basement, too.  The family dog was kept
in the basement at nighttime.  One night the family heard loud sounds coming
from the other side of the basement door.  Their dog, a collie, was literally
being "rammed" up against the door several times and was exhausted, drenced
in sweat.</B>
<P><B>The following evening, the same situation arose where the collie was
being rammed up against the basement door from something unseen in the basement.
 The dog died two weeks later from injuries received.</B>
<P><B>After the death of the dog, the family attempted to remove the presence
in the house on their own.  Rituals resulted in slamming doors.  A quiji
board was used in an attempt to contact the presence in the home which created
more questions than answers received.  When "asked" who he or she was, the
response was "J.R.," which was my mother's stepfather's name.  The stepfather
was not present while the quiji boad was in use.   When asked what or who
he wanted, the response was "Angel," my mother's name.</B>
<P><B>It was time to move again, this time into a four-plex in the Chicago
area.  I was born at this time and old enough to recall some strange
circumstances.  The attic was active with poltergeist-like activity.  My
uncle and I slept in the attic.  My uncle was hit in the head with a baseball
bat, I had a baseball thrown at me.</B>
<P><B>Now, I live in a residence where an older couple had died in previous
years.  We experienced a fire when my sister was only 3 and it was her room
that contained the most smoke.  The paramedics treated her and reported that
with the intensity of smoke in her room, she had only 10 percent of the amount
of smoke in her lungs that she should have experienced.</B>
<P><B>A time later  --  I usually would awake in the middle of the night
to get a glass of water  --  I experienced something strange.  I became aware
of a dark, blurry figure bringing me a drink!  He sat down on my bed and
said not to be afraid.  I was shocked but slowly regained my composure. 
He sat and talked with me.  I mostly listened.  This happened approximately
four times a week.</B>
<P><B>One day I got a computer.  During one of our "conversations" I mentioned
that I would </B>
<P><B>like to put our conversations on the Internet for all to read.  He
was displeased with the idea and disappeared.  Well, that was about three
months ago.</B>
<P><B>You may think I'm crazy, but my brother hears two distinct voices in
my bedroom, too.</B>

<P><B>out right away,It's a 3 level house at the end of a long narrow
driveway</B>
<P><B>and the first time I visited here,I would get strange feelings going</B>
<P><B>upstairs,you can't turn on the light until you're at the top,but I
never</B>
<P><B>said anything then one day my mother was over for a visit she was</B>
<P><B>sitting</B> <B>on the porch in the daytime,from the porch if you look
inside you can</B>
<P><B>see the stairs going up,She though she saw my sister walk by and go

<P><B>daughters but they heard it too. I was a bit skeptical at first,I believed
my</B>
<P><B>mom and sister,but I've never seen anything like that,but then while</B>
<P><B>visiting a few times,it changed my mind,my boyfriend and I were
sleeping</B>
<P><B>in the guest room and he woke me up saying he'd had a bad dream about
an</B>
<P><B>evil little German boy,who used to live there,He drifted off to
sleep,</B>
<P><B>while I went to get a drink,when I came back,he looked very
frightened</B>
<P><B>and said that someone put there hand on his back,I went to sleep and</B>
<P><B>also</B> <B>dreamt about the German boy,but I just figured it was because
my</B>
<P><B>boyfriend</B> <B>had just told me about it.We also looked after my
sister's house for a</B>
<P><B>week when she went on holiday,We slept downstairs this time and
nothing</B>
<P><B>really happened for the first couple of days,then one night I thought
I</B>
<P><B>heard muffled talking upstairs,I didn't realize the time and I knew
my</B>
<P><B>parents lived close by and had a key,So I went upstairs the lights
were</B>
<P><B>off and there was no one there.I mentioned it to my boyfriend the
 next</B>
<P><B>day,he said he wasn't sure if he heard anything or not.the next night
I</B>
<P><B>heard it again and this time my boyfriend did too,only we heard
glasses</B>
<P><B>clinking and people laughing,I was scared but pulled the covers over
my</B>
<P><B>head and went to sleep.We have never stayed there alone again,my
sister</B>
<P><B>doesn't think that they're harmful spirits,but my youngest neice
won't</B>
<P><B>stay there by herself and I don't blame her.The oldest daughter was</B>
<P><B>mentioning to her teacher about where she lives(it's a small town)and</B>
<P><B>he told her that a man had hung himself in one of the apple trees,why
a</B>
<P><B>teacher would tell her that is beyond me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My other story is shorter,(I promise)I had a friend in high school,who
</B>
<P><B>lives a short distance from me.The house that her parents bought was
at</B>
<P><B>the middle of a cul-de-sac.Whenever I would visit her I would get
this</B>
<P><B>weird feeling walking up to the house.We used to see a little girl
in</B>
<P><B>the</B> <B>corner house playing by herself,you couldn't really see
the house for</B>
<P><B>the</B> <B>tree's she wasn't a ghost,but she always used to say "come
and play with</B>
<P><B>me"in a really eerie voice and we both got weird vibes from her.My</B>
<P><B>friends house also had weird feelings,if her parents were out,the
phone</B>
<P><B>would ring all the time and no one would be there,she heard footsteps</B>
<P><B>upstairs,they door wouldn't unlock to let us in most of the time,and</B>
<P><B>then</B> <B>it would just pop open,she wouldn't go upstairs if she
was downstairs by</B>
<P><B>herself and vice-versa.They finally found out that the previous owner
a</B>
<P><B>man had died there,but the whole cul-de-sac had a weird feeling.</B>

<H3><A NAME=home>Our Minnesota Home</A>
</H3><P><B>by dpraser@avana.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>We rented a home up in the Minneapolis suburb of Edina. Not exactly
the</B>
<P><B>kind of place one might imagine a ghost to dwell, but for my family,
it was</B>
<P><B>nothing less. Only on the day that we were moving out did we find out
from</B>
<P><B>a man who knew the original owners that the owners' 16 year old son
had</B>
<P><B>died in a car accident a long time ago. Strangely enough, his room
was the</B>
<P><B>same room my older brother stayed in- and both their names are Jamie!</B>
<P><B>My first experience with "Jamie" was the usual footsteps in the hall
at</B>
<P><B>night. Nothing much. I knew he was there, but then I didn't know who.
My</B>
<P><B>dog hated to go into our basement, so I knew she knew as well. Sometimes,
I</B>
<P><B>would be sick and stay home from school. My parents had things to do,
so</B>
<P><B>they would leave me alone for short amounts of time. I never let my
dog</B>
<P><B>away from my side.</B>
<P><B>The strangest incidents, though, were completely inexplainable. During
the</B>
<P><B>week my aunt and grandmother were visiting from down south, my sister
and I</B>
<P><B>both had to sleep in my brother's bed because ours had been taken.
One</B>
<P><B>night, I couldn't sleep. I don't know why. I just stared at the cieling
as</B>
<P><B>if I knew I was waiting for something to happen. And then it did!
Suddenly</B>
<P><B>there was music (the title music from "Phantom of the Opera"; not
something</B>
<P><B>you want to be hearing at night!). It got louder and louder and louder,
as</B>
<P><B>I grew angrier and angrier. I thought it was my dad showing the
relatives</B>
<P><B>his favorite CD, so I got up ready to get onto him about it. When I
was</B>
<P><B>half-way out of the room, I saw my dad race by in the hallway. I
followed</B>
<P><B>him and peered down into the dark family room where he was just turning
it</B>
<P><B>off. Nobody else was down there. The next morning, I was the blame
for it!</B>
<P><B>I for one, though, would never go down there at one in the morning,
in the</B>
<P><B>dark, alone, to turn on my most hated CD!</B>
<P><B>Next occurence: It was nearing Christmas. My mom was going into the</B>
<P><B>basement to get ornaments out of the storage room. It didn't take
long</B>
<P><B>before there was a scream of terror, causing me to jump from my seat
and</B>
<P><B>race to my mother's aid downstairs. It was because she, hating the</B>
<P><B>windowless room in the first place, begged for the ghost not to turn
the</B>
<P><B>lights off. When she reached the very back of the room, though, the
lights</B>
<P><B>clicked off.</B>
<P><B>There were many other occurences, but the last one I'm going to share,
will</B>
<P><B>let you know why I never hated his presence. Our house dated back to
the</B>
<P><B>early 1950's, so not everything about it was perfect. One day, our
kitchen</B>
<P><B>lightswitch was stuck. My mom suspected something wrong, so she called
the</B>
<P><B>electrician. When he got there, he stood on our table to check the
light</B>
<P><B>above. As soon as he touched our cieling, he yelped. The wires were
messed</B>
<P><B>up terribly. He said it was so hot, you could frie an egg. If the
kitchen</B>
<P><B>lights had gone on one more time, our house would have burned to the</B>
<P><B>ground. Once everything was fixed, the lightswitch worked fine, and
no one</B>
<P><B>could figure out why it had stuck like it had. </B>
<P><B>The day we left was somehwat sad. The house just seemed dreary. I
think,</B>
<P><B>though, now that his parents are back in, he might be happier now.
That</B>
<P><B>makes me happier, too.</B>

<H3><A NAME=last>A Father's Last Visit</A>
</H3><P><B>by BlaineSuz@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>The following experience happened to my mother in the mid 1960's. 
I was just a toddler at the time and she was pregnant with my twin sisters.
  It also happens to be an isolated incident in my family.  And,  though
I have never actually had a ghostly encounter of my own, I thought others
might enjoy reading this story, as I have enjoyed all of the interesting
stories on this web page sent in by the various readers.</B>
<P><B>My mother had what you might call a dysfunctional family life growing
up in New York City, but she still happened to be her father's favorite child
(she has two older siblings).  When she was about 20 years old, her parents
divorced, which was still pretty uncommon for the 1950's .  Her mother pitted
her against her father during this unhappy time and it unfortunately severed
her relationship with him---something I think she still regrets to this day
(there is so much more to this family story; I could be typing here for hours).
  </B>
<P><B>He died in 1957 and of course my mother and her siblings did not attend
his funeral since nobody was speaking to him at the time.  Fast forward five
years later, my mother is married with one toddler at home and twins on the
way.  Because she was so uncomfortable carrying twins while pregnant, she
started to sleep alone in another bedroom of the house in order to get her
rest.   One such evening late at night, she awoke suddenly in her room. 
Ten feet in front of her stands her late father, sort of glowing, but she
could see him clearly and recognized him instantly.  At that point, he starts
coming towards her with his arms extended towards her.  She got the feeling
he wanted to speak to her but the sight of him frightened her so, she started
to scream.  My own dad awoke (he was in the other bedroom) and came running
in to help her.    My dad swears to this day, that the room was like an ice
box when he entered and he also saw some kind of glowing fog like substance
in the room, but by this point it was already fading out.  The last footnote
to this story is that when my mother started to scream, all of the pictures
on the walls of this room instantly dropped to the ground  breaking around
her.    Because my parents don't really believe in ghosts (even though this
happened to them), I know they are being honest about what they experienced.
  </B>
<P><B>I have asked my mother why she thinks her own father came back to visit
her, and she thinks maybe it was to let her know that he doesn't hold anything
against her for all of the unhappiness between them.    I do know one thing
for sure, she wouldn't like to repeat this experience ever again!  SB</B>

</H3><P><B>by dkabuel@pixi.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>One afternoon after attending my grandmother's funeral service, I was
at</B>
<P><B>home relaxing on my bed (formally my grandmother's room).  I happen
to</B>
<P><B>fall asleep and found myself dreaming.  In my dream I recall two
figures</B>
<P><B>stepping forward and telling me something in filipino (my
grandmother's</B>
<P><B>language).  I couldn't make out anything so in my dream I called out
and</B>
<P><B>asked the two to speak in english.  I started to sense that I was</B>
<P><B>talking to my grandparents.  Weird!  The dream ended and I was in</B>
<P><B>between limbo and being awake.  I could here my parents talking in
the</B>
<P><B>kitchen and I also could here the television.  Sometime after
realizing</B>
<P><B>I was half awake I felt an arm over my chest and a body pressing
against</B>
<P><B>the right side of my body.  I forced my eyes open after feeling my</B>
<P><B>energy being drained and looked to the right.  I saw nothing; but I</B>
<P><B>still felt the arm over my chest for a few more seconds.  I froze
up...</B>

<H3>	<A NAME=grandpa>Connecting with Grandpa</A>
</H3><P><B>by 	pmrco19@idt.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>I grew up in a rural area outside a small town in northeast Indiana.
</B>
<P><B>Years ago, my grandparents moved there and built our house, the barn</B>
<P><B>behind my house, and my uncle's house just down the road.  Our house
was</B>
<P><B>surrounded by fields, which my uncle farmed.  He stored his equipment
in</B>
<P><B>the barn behind our house. </B>
<P>
<P><B>One summer day when I was seven or eight, I was walked out to the
barn,</B>
<P><B>which I rarely did.  (Not because the barn was scary, but because
there</B>
<P><B>was usually nothing to see in it but tractors and combines.)  A
pregnant</B>
<P><B>stray had taken up residence in the barn, and I noticed that she had
had</B>
<P><B>her kittens.  On my way to the barn, I began hearing a little tune
in my</B>
<P><B>mind, something I assumed I had just thought up.  I whistled the tune</B>
<P><B>out loud and went on searching for the kittens.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I came in to dinner that evening still whistling the tune.  My father</B>
<P><B>looked up at me sharply and asked "Where did you hear that?"  I replied
</B>
<P><B>"I thought it up while I was out by the barn."  Dad looked down at
the</B>
<P><B>table for a few minutes and said "My father used to whistle that tune</B>
<P><B>when he was working in the barn."  I was stunned.  I had never met
my</B>
<P><B>grandpa.  He died of a brain aneurism while walking out to the barn
ten</B>
<P><B>years before I was born.</B>

<H3><A NAME=ghosts>The Ghosts in my House</A>
</H3><P><B>by aliciak@irn-auto.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>I have actually seen balls of light in the master bedroom of my house.
</B>
<P><B>Several people have heard voices in my house.  One time when my
mother</B>
<P><B>was home alone, she heard someone repeatedly calling her name and a</B>
<P><B>child's voice calling for its mom.  One day when I was fumbling for
my</B>
<P><B>keys, while holding grocery bags, at the glass front door of my house,
I</B>
<P><B>could see the TV on through the door and a figure walk by.  I sat
there</B>
<P><B>cursing my family member who was so rude as to ignore me when I was</B>
<P><B>struggling to get the door open.  Upon entering the TV was off, the</B>
<P><B>house was silent, and no one else was home.  When I was in
high-school,</B>
<P><B>I used to yell upstairs in the morning to let my mom know I was
leaving</B>
<P><B>for school.  One day, I was about to yell upstairs when suddenly I
heard</B>
<P><B>a voice say "Mom, I'm leaving!".  I stopped dead thinking maybe I</B>
<P><B>imagined it because I know I didn't say it.  But then my mom yelled
down</B>
<P><B>the stairs "Alright, I'll see you when I get home."  Upon asking her</B>
<P><B>what she just heard, we both were freaked out.  A few years ago, my</B>
<P><B>friend Stephanie and I were talking on the phone, and she said she
would</B>
<P><B>be over in just a few minutes.   I told her to just come in and come</B>
<P><B>upstairs to my room.  I waited and waited and waited.  After about
an</B>
<P><B>hour, I went downstairs to make sure the doors were unlocked, and
found</B>
<P><B>Stephanie sitting in the den watching TV.  We ended up getting in a</B>
<P><B>fight because she started yelling at me, asking what took me so long,</B>
<P><B>and I started yelling at her for not coming upstairs like I told her</B>
<P><B>too.  She swears that she heard a voice telling her to watch TV in
the</B>
<P><B>den and that I would be down in a few minutes.  Thinking it was my</B>
<P><B>sister, who was out of town at the time, she did as she was told. 
We</B>
<P><B>still have not been able to explain this.  There are many times in
my</B>
<P><B>house that I see shadows in the hallway and have the distinct feeling</B>
<P><B>that I'm not alone.  My mom also feels there is something in the
house</B>
<P><B>with us.  My dad just thinks we are both nuts.  These happenings have</B>
<P><B>subsided now.  Only rarely does something odd happen.  We found it
fun</B>
<P><B>to have a playful ghost, if that's what it was, in our home.  It's</B>
<P><B>welcome anytime as long as it behaves.</B>

<H3><A NAME=old>Old House in Abilene, KS</A>
</H3><P><B>by 	StarBaby85@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I saw a ghost once. It happened when I was 9.(I'm almost 12 now) I
really don't care if you believes me or not. Me and my family moved to an
old house in Abilene, KS. Its a really small town. The house was way out
in the middle of nowhere. Right after we bought the house, me and my bro
were exploring,(he was 13 then) and we found the door to the cellar and we
decided to go down there and see what was there, so my bro opened the door.
We both felt a chill and our knees got weak. My bro slammed the cellar door
and we both went running away from there.(we hadn't had any problems til
we opened the cellar door.) A few days after that, I was lieing in my bed
,that had just been put up that day, and I glanced at my door and there was
this black figure at my door looking at me. At first, I thought I was just
seeing things, so I didn't think anything about it. But the next night, I
saw something walk past my door. I thought my dad walked past (there was
a room at the end of the hall we called the "classroom") and all I could
see was his shadow. So, I waited for him to walk past again, but he didn't.
Then something walked past my door (going toward the classroom).It didn't
really look human, it was tall, it had a long slended pointed head and sharp
looking teeth(I know it sounds like I'm making this up, but I'm not, this
really happened.) It didn't have any feet, his legs just looked kinda like
bell bottoms. The way it went by looked kinda like it had on roller skates.
 It really freaked me out so I pulled the covers over my head and I ended
up falling asleep like that. It happened everynight, after my parents had
gone to bed. I wasn't the only one who was seein' this thing. My bro saw
it too.His room was beside mine (right by the stairs). After awhile, I could
hear foot steps coming up the stairs and then I'd see the thing walk past
my door again. When I told my mom, she believed me, and told the thing to
leave. I never saw it again after that. But, that wasn't the only ghost in
that house. One day I was riding my bike up and down our drive way and I
looked up at the classroom window and I saw a little boy looking out at me.
I knew it wasn't my bro cuz the boy was wearing old clothes. They looked
like pilgram clothes. You could tell by the expression on his face that he
was very sad.That was the only time I ever saw the little boy. Well, thats
it. Sorry it was so long.</B>

<H3><A NAME=explain>Something I can't Explain</A>
</H3><P><B>by lcraighe@uwf.edu </B>
<P>
<P><B>This happen to me and my two daughters about 3 years ago.  We have
no </B>
<P><B>explanation for the happening. We were at home one evening around 8pm.
 I </B>
<P><B>was on the computer and my 8 year old daughter was playing in the </B>
<P><B>livingroom and my older daughter was closed up in her room reading
a </B>
<P><B>book.  All of a sudden my attentiion was drawn to the ceiling where
I saw </B>
<P><B>a single blue light dancing around the ceiling.  There was no sound
</B>
<P><B>accupying the light and it was there for just a few seconds and then
it </B>
<P><B>was gone.  I never felt afraid or threathened in anyway.  I just turned
</B>
<P><B>around and started back working on the computer.  All of a sudden my
8 </B>
<P><B>year old daughter called for me.  I turned around to answer her and
from </B>
<P><B>the expression on her face I realized she had seen something too. 
She </B>
<P><B>said, "Mom did you see the blue light"?  I said, do you mean the one
in </B>
<P><B>here?  She said, "No, mom the one in here where I am.  She saw a blue
</B>
<P><B>light too, at the exact same time I did in my den.  We also found out
</B>
<P><B>later that my older daughter also saw a blue light in her room at the
</B>
<P><B>same time we both saw one.  My youngest daughter seemed a little </B>
<P><B>frightened by the incident, but neither me nor my older daughter were
</B>
<P><B>afraid.  I searched outside and all around the house for any explanation.
</B>
<P><B>We could not see nor hear anything anywhere.  All of our shades were
</B>
<P><B>drawn and all of our doors were closed.  The lights did not spread
across </B>
<P><B>the walls or reflect on anything, they were just circling the ceiling
for </B>
<P><B>a few seconds.  We have not seen anything like them since.</B>

<H3><A NAME=real>The Real Thing</A>
</H3><P><B>by 	Clevner@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>i will begin to tell you a short story about one of the many nights
that i have spent at an old antibellum home in St. Francisville, Louisiana.
 it one of the many haunts in louisiana, but it is the most haunted, given
that title by many paranormal professionals.   i have seen things all through
my life and have put them off as an over active imagination untill i moved
into a new house on the outskirts of New Orleans.  my mom and one brother
used to see things too, but i didn't want to accept  the gift i have because
of skepticism. because things kept happening to me, a friend told me about
the Myrtles Plantation.  I said i wanted to go because i wanted to see if
i really had some gift or if it was an over active imagination.  we made
arrangements as a group of six to go spend the night and set off for a night
of whatever... when we first arrived, we went to our rooms.  i had a very
uneasy feeling. in fact, one of the people with us noticed how nervous i
was because he could see my hands shaking.  i told them that i felt pins
and needly all over and had a sense that i was not alone.  i told my husband
that whatever he did, do not ever leave me alone for a moment and i tole
the group the same... i am not all that gifted, but i had this feeling that
i could not shake, from the moment we drove onto the grounds.   the first
thing that happened was when my husband and i decided to set up the video
camera in our room to keep running while we were exploring the little town
and visiting the graves of some of the former owners.  we turned the camera
on and plugged it into the wall socket and didn't rely on batteries so that
we knew it would run longer...the camere was working fine, it showed us having
trouble getting our bedroom door to lock and then it showed us finally getting
it to work, i said there it is, it locks now and we closed the door, we could
hear the lock click and lock and just after that the camera shut itself off
and would not work for the rest of the weekend.  it began to work again after
we arrived home and i was complaining that i would not have a camera for
christmas...maybe it was a faulty camera, maybe not..one of the trademarks
of the myrtles is camera equiptment that refuses to cooperate...but back
to the subject.  darkness was  comming on and the couple that brought us
began to share the stories that happened to them on a previous visit and
what happened to a friend of theirs.  i was really getting more scared now
especially since it was now dark..at the myrtles if you just sit quiet for
a few minutes you  can hear footsteps and people talking where no one is
supposed to be.  we now pulled out the ouiji board and began to play with
it...i could not use it for long because my hand shook and i was afraid i
would not get the right connections with the board.. some of the others played
it and we all knew it was woking.  the first results were  just nonsence
talk, but all of a sudden, a white ball of light  was bouncing between the
two people playing and then they began to get a pins and needles feeling
starting from their fingers and traveling up their arms and out of their
heads.  one person was actually thrown back into the chair..we took a photo
and we caught the ball of light.  with that we decided to all go to our rooms
and wait alone till anything happened, but before we finished, my friend,
told the board that i had come specifically to become a believer and that
i wanted the ghost to show me some kind of sign tonight.  the only time that
night that we received an answer that was clear, came at that time from the
board.  it spelled out , yes, soon tonight... wow, that really made me feel
real good now!!!!!  i was really upset and i could not go to sleep.  my husband,
who is somewhat skeptical, fell asleep right away.  i heard every noise there
was and made him sleep with the lights on..everything was fine till about
3 am.  then my proof became a reality.  without a hint of warning and through
the covers, something gently grabbed my foot and began to shake it.  i pulled
my foot away but it then grabbed my other leg around the ankle, and i will
swear that it was a hand, and proceeded to run it's hand up my leg, all the
time with just a very gentle pressure.  it pulled my leg away once again,
but then immediately i was grabbed on the opposite leg the same way.  this
happened a total of 3 times before i finally said " i believe in you, you
are scarring me, please leave me alone."  with that there was a loud noise
like someone took 2 pieces of 2x4 wood and beat them together hard.  i was
then left alone for the rest of the night.  my friends in the next room said
they heard the loud noise and my husband, who snorred through my ordeal,
said he heard the noise but he was too tired to be worried.  i really regret
that while it was happening, i was cringing under the covers, but i promised
myself that if we ever came back, that next time i was going to look... well,
we went back and i did look and so did other members of my family and we
all became true believers...yes virginia, there really are ghost!!!!   but
that is a story for another time...</B>

<H3><A NAME=black>The Black Figure</A>
</H3><P><B>by CHUTCHINS@nrsc.co.uk</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is a story experienced by my friend's mum and her friend .</B>
<P>
<P><B>One night Andrew's ( my friend ) uncle and aunty decided to have a
go at   </B>
<P><B>some kind of ritual , for fun . Big mistake ! Because it released what
  </B>
<P><B>was later to terrorize Andrew's mum and her friend .</B>
<P>
<P><B>Andrew's Aunty phoned his mum and told her of some strange experiences
  </B>
<P><B>she had been having . About two nights after that his mum started to
see   </B>
<P><B>a tall dark shape resembling that of a cloaked man . The figure would
  </B>
<P><B>appear in the middle of a room , even in broad day light . Even though
  </B>
<P><B>she was scared she shrugged it off as it did no harm . But a few days
  </B>
<P><B>later things got worse . She started to be pushed around by the figure
.   </B>
<P><B>She would be lying in bed and then suddenly the figure would appear
at   </B>
<P><B>the foot of  her bed .</B>
<P>
<P><B>Not being able to cope with it any more she phoned her friend and told
  </B>
<P><B>her of her experiences .</B>
<P>
<P><B>After that Andrew's mum was left in peace , but her friend started
to see   </B>
<P><B>the same ghostly figure .</B>
<P>
<P><B>You've probably worked out that this creature travels down the telephone
  </B>
<P><B>cables , and moves on to the next house .</B>
<P>
<P><B>Andrew's mum's friend got it the worst though . She started to see
the   </B>
<P><B>cloaked man as Andrew's mum had , but more often .</B>
<P>
<P><B>She then started to be pushed around and beaten up . One night she
was   </B>
<P><B>walking down the hall to the bathroom and the figure appeared in front
of   </B>
<P><B>her . It wouldn't let her past so she ran to her room and shut the
door .   </B>
<P>
<P><B>Eventually she got so frightened that she called in a priest to rid
her   </B>
<P><B>house of the creature . But it was to ultimately evil and powerful
to be   </B>
<P><B>removed by just that one  priest . A whole group of Psychics were brought
  </B>
<P><B>in to banish it , and they succeeded .</B>

<H3><A NAME=toronto>Family Home in Toronto, Ontario</A>
</H3><P><B>by ormrod@interlog.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>	The story I am going to relate occured 20 years ago in my family
home</B>
<P><B>in Toronto, Ontario.  It is in a quiet residential area.  My family
was</B>
<P><B>the second one to live in the house.  The family who lived in the
house</B>
<P><B>before us  was Oriental and they were forced to move when the father</B>
<P><B>died and they could no longer afford to stay there.  When the father
had</B>
<P><B>died they had planted a tree in his memory in the back garden and
they</B>
<P><B>asked if they could take it with them when they moved.  We agreed but</B>
<P><B>asked if we could settle in first and have them come back at a later</B>
<P><B>date.  They agreed and came back for the tree six months later.
 During</B>
<P><B>the time the tree was in the yard there were several strange
occurences</B>
<P><B>in the house.   At the time my brother and I were very young.  My
mother</B>
<P><B>would wake up in the middle of the night and hear someone crying and</B>
<P><B>calling for her.  She would go and check both my brother and I but
we we</B>
<P><B>would both be sound asleep. </B>
<P><B>	 My grandmother was also living with us at the time and she was
often</B>
<P><B>home alone during the day.  She would sit and read in the living
room.</B>
<P><B>Once, while alone in the house, she heard the front door open, heard</B>
<P><B>someone run up the stairs and heard an upstairs door close.  She
called</B>
<P><B>and called to see who was there without any answer and when she
finally</B>
<P><B>went and checked she found all the doors open and no one there.</B>
<P><B>	My older sister also remembers waking up in the middle of the night
and</B>
<P><B>seeing a child praying by the side of her bed.</B>
<P><B>	After the previous family had removed the tree these unusual
occurences</B>
<P><B>halted, although I distinctly remember waking up at night and seeing
the</B>
<P><B>same praying figure next to my bed.</B>
<P><B>	I hope this story is helpful to you.</B>

<H3><A NAME=leroy>Our ghost "Leroy"</A>
</H3><P><B>by 	jgilson@mindspring.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>In the early 70's we built a new brick home. We only had furnishings
for two</B>
<P><B>bedrooms so we left the third room empty. At some point we were given
an old</B>
<P><B>iron bed. I kept it under the car port until I had time to re-finish
it. </B>
<P>
<P><B>When the re-finishing had been completed, we placed it in the vacant</B>
<P><B>bedroom. We added other pieces of furniture from a local dealer. In
just a</B>
<P><B>few days after the room was completed, we started seeing this figure
of a man.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The first encounter was at 4:00 am one morning. I awoke and looked
across</B>
<P><B>the hall and noticed that the room was as bright as day. It wasn't
long</B>
<P><B>before a figure appeared and walked to the edge of the bed and then
down to</B>
<P><B>the footboard and disappeared into the corner. My wife saw it on
another</B>
<P><B>occasion. My son had an experience with it as well.</B>
<P>
<P><B>To make a long story short, the incidents got closer together and it
made</B>
<P><B>attempts to touch us. We discarded the furnishings and the problem
left.</B>
<P><B>I had been a skeptic in regards to ghost, but now I am a firm
believer.</B>

<H3><A NAME=nellis>Ghost at the Nellis AFB K-9 Kennels</A>
</H3><P><B>by 	dlp@emerado.polaristel.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>I joined the Air Force in 1987 and my first assignment was Nellis AFB</B>
<P><B>located just next to Las Vegas.  After a few months there I started
to hear</B>
<P><B>stories of a female K-9 handler that shot herself on the access road
that</B>
<P><B>goes to the firing range.  The story goes, she was upset because of
her</B>
<P><B>boyfriend was leaving her for another woman.  She drove her 6-pak
(crewcab)</B>
<P><B>truck down the access road sometime in the middle of the night.  Took
her</B>
<P><B>dog out and tied him to the front bumper got back into the
driverseat,</B>
<P><B>pulled her .38 out and shot herself in head.  They found her a few
hours</B>
<P><B>later when she didn't answer her status check on the radio.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Now when heard that her ghost was haunting the Law Enforcement kennels
I</B>
<P><B>really wanted to see for myself, just to be sure that the guy's
weren't</B>
<P><B>just screwing with the new guy.  I drove past the K-9 kennels on many</B>
<P><B>nights while conducting the same check she was and I never saw a thing,
but</B>
<P><B>everynow and then one of the K-9 handlers would come to work after
picking</B>
<P><B>up his dog, swearing that he saw a white, misty cloud floating above
the</B>
<P><B>kennels.  Well on one night while I was conducting the nightly checks
I was</B>
<P><B>driving down the access road.  It was a crystal clear night in the
desert. </B>
<P><B>No clouds no wind just a nice cool desert night.  On this check I had
a</B>
<P><B>partner with me and we are cruising down and all of a sudden a white,
misty</B>
<P><B>cloud about the size of a human formed right in front of the patrol
car. </B>
<P><B>We both say almost the sametime what the f#@&amp; is that!!!  Well
just as the</B>
<P><B>patrol car is about to go through it, it travels right over the car
like a</B>
<P><B>wind test.  I stop the car we both get out and look behind us and there
is</B>
<P><B>nothing there.  Now we both are Security Policemen, armed and scared</B>
<P><B>shitless!  We both just saw a ghost in the desert miles from anything.
 We</B>
<P><B>both get back into the car and I just haul ass getting the hell out
of</B>
<P><B>there.  The problem is that there is only one way in and out, so we
had to</B>
<P><B>drive right back through where we just came.  Let me tell you that
poor</B>
<P><B>little engine was screaming for mercy.</B>
<P>
<P><B>That was the only experience I had with the Kennel ghost.  But a friend
of</B>
<P><B>mine, who was newly assigned to my flight had never heard of the story.
</B>
<P><B>One day were sitting on the flightline shooting the shit and he
starts</B>
<P><B>telling a odd story that he just has to get out.  One night after a
swing</B>
<P><B>shift (around 11:30PM) he went over to the horse stables to feed and
check</B>
<P><B>his horse.  Now the Nellis AFB horse stables and the K-9 kennels are
right</B>
<P><B>next to each other.  Well anyway he was scratching his horses ear and
out</B>
<P><B>of the corner of is eye he sees  a woman walking from the arena
towards</B>
<P><B>him.  He is thinking this is odd its almost midnight and here is this
woman</B>
<P><B>that he has never seen before here at the stables.  As she gets closer
he</B>
<P><B>says "hi" she doesn't say anything to him, just walks right by him
like he</B>
<P><B>isn't there.  He then says "hi" again she turns and looks at him. 
He said</B>
<P><B>he got goosebumps all over his body when she looked at him, but he
doesn't</B>
<P><B>know why.  The woman continues her walk, rounds the corner of the
stable</B>
<P><B>which will take her to the K-9 kennels which are about 50 feet away.
 He</B>
<P><B>said about 30 seconds after she made that turn and he couldn't see
her</B>
<P><B>anymore, every single dog in that kennel went absolutely crazy.
 Barking,</B>
<P><B>howling, growling and everything else a dog does when he is frightened.
</B>
<P><B>Well my friend went running around the corner to see what is going
on and</B>
<P><B>as he makes that corner there is nobody there, and no footprints in
the</B>
<P><B>dirt.  </B>
<P><B>Well when we told him the story about the ghost he went white as a
sheet</B>
<P><B>and never ever went to the stables at night again.  I totally swear
both</B>
<P><B>stories are true, and if anybody from Nellis reads this youll know
what im</B>
<P><B>talking about.</B>

<H3><A NAME=phantom>The Phantom Hitch-Hiker</A>
</H3><P><B>by 	MrMan320@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Several years ago I had a job that required me to work the grave yard
shift. Even on my days off I would stay up all night and sleep durring the
day. </B>
<P><B>Sometimes to pass the night I would go for long drives by myself. I
loved to do this especially durring the spring when the night air was so
cool after the day being so hot.</B>
<P><B>One morning, around 2:00 a.m. I was board with sitting at home and
decided to go drive. </B>
<P><B>I drove just kind of aimlessly, with no particular destination, when
I decided I would drive up Big Cotton Wood Canyon.  There is an electronic
sign at the mouth of this canyon that is used to post weather conditions
and travel advisories, it is also a bus stop. </B>
<P><B>That morning, standing by the sign, I saw a person hitch hiking. I
thought, "Why not?" and stopped to pick the person up.</B>
<P><B>The person I picked up was a woman, she was about mid twenties slender
and attractive. </B>
<P><B>We talked very little as I drove up the canyon. I kept looking over
at her in the passenger seat and thinking how pretty she was but it never
occured to me to make any kind of a pass at her. At the time, being only
19, this was unusual for me.</B>
<P><B>When we got to the top of the canyon I let her out where she requested.
She said goodbye and thanks for the ride. Then got out of the car.</B>
<P><B>That's when it occured to me to ask her name or try to get her phone
number. </B>
<P><B>I opened my door and got out, turnning toward her as I did. She was
gone. There was no place she could have gone to so quickly, where I let her
out was an open area, no trees or buildings no place she could have hidden,
she was just gone. </B>
<P><B>Thinking back on it, I don't recall hearing the car door close when
she got out although it was closed. I suddenly got a really bad case of the
chills and a cold feeling inside</B>
<P><B>I have talked to a few people about this in the years since and have
been told by many that they have heard of this before. The description I
have been given of the woman matches the woman I picked up almost
perfectly.</B>

<H3>	<A NAME=ghostly>Ghostly Experiences</A>
</H3><P><B>by 	njbest@ntonline.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>I have always firmly believed in the paranormal, or ghosts. I happen
to</B>
<P><B>reside in Chilliwack, B.C., Canada, where I have lived for about 3</B>
<P><B>years. Before moving to Chilliwack, I had lived in Burnaby, B.C. for
almost</B>
<P><B>28 years. I originally moved to to Burnaby from Trail, B.C., </B>
<P><B>when I was just 8 years old. In mylifetime, I have lived in at least
6</B>
<P><B>houses. It was in one of these houses where I had my first and only</B>
<P><B>ghostly experience. It actually took place in the last house I lived
in</B>
<P><B>back in Burnaby, B.C., for almost 20 years. My parents bought the</B>
<P><B>house from an elderly woman who had advanced in years so much that
she</B>
<P><B>could no longer maintain it. It was an old house which wasn't actually
</B>
<P><B>very big in size. It only had 2 small bedrooms, a bathroom,</B>
<P><B>livingroom, a kitchen with an old pantry, and basement. The</B>
<P><B>first bedroom was in the fron of the house while the 2nd was in the
back.</B>
<P><B>The elderly woman's late husband had died 5 years before </B>
<P><B>my parents bought the house back in 1975. The husband was a retired</B>
<P><B>railroad worker and rumor was that he had died in the house.</B>
<P><B>Because the house had only 2 bedrooms. Both my father and I built a
bedroom</B>
<P><B>for me in the basement. About 10, or 12 years ago,</B>
<P><B>I had awakened in my bedroom from an early evening nap. After I had
been</B>
<P><B>awake for a while, I decided to get dressed and go</B>
<P><B>upstairs for something to eat. I turned on a light which lit up the
main</B>
<P><B>part of the basement. Suddenly!, as I was about to exit my</B>
<P><B>bedroom. My small color T.V. turned on by itself and then off again.
I</B>
<P><B>tried to think of both a rational and logical reason for it, but</B>
<P><B>couldn't. My T.V. wasn't designed for use with a remote-control, and
never</B>
<P><B>came with one. I decided it was a paranormal experience</B>
<P><B>and wasn't frightened by it. I explained what had happened to my
parents</B>
<P><B>and they just joked and laughted about it. They couldn't</B>
<P><B>realize that I was very serious about it. But there have been 2 other</B>
<P><B>experiences in that house. Such as the time my mother had</B>
<P><B>been sitting in the kitchen late on night. She swore that a drawer
opened</B>
<P><B>wide by itself and then slammed violently closed again.</B>
<P><B>An older sister of mine slept in the back bedroom shortly before she
moved</B>
<P><B>out and got married. One night she screamed while </B>
<P><B>still fully awake. She claimed that as she was laying on her bed and
just</B>
<P><B>drifting off to sleep. An apparition had appeared to her</B>
<P><B>which seemed to sit down beside her on the bed. It was an old man who</B>
<P><B>appeared to be staring straight ahead. In one hand he</B>
<P><B>seemed to be holding a bottle. Then he turned his head to stare
directly</B>
<P><B>into the face of my sister for a short time and faded away.</B>
<P><B>The experience unnerved my sister and frightened her. I personally
beleive</B>
<P><B>that he was a bit of a drinker in life and had died in that</B>
<P><B>back bedroom. There are other experiences which have taken place in
that</B>
<P><B>house which I have forgotten about over the years. Two</B>
<P><B>generations of the same family pervious to us had lived in that house
which</B>
<P><B>had been built in 1930. </B>
<P><B>Over the years, I've been informed of other ghostly happenings which
have</B>
<P><B>taken place here in B.C. Burnaby is actually located next </B>
<P><B>Vancouver, B.C., Canada. North Vancouver has a few hauntings of it's
own.</B>
<P><B>At the turn of the century on Grouse Mountain before</B>
<P><B>the ski-resort was built. A shingle-cutter lived on the mountain in
a cabin</B>
<P><B>which was provided for him. For the period of one week, he</B>
<P><B>was visited nightly by a horrific apparition. A large head with a
demonic</B>
<P><B>expression and hidious firey eyes with an ugly appearence.</B>
<P><B>this apparition made it's first appearence in his cabin. He took a
shot at</B>
<P><B>it with a pistol he owned. It passed through it and went into</B>
<P><B>the ceiling of the cabin. The spirit would both torment and frighten
the</B>
<P><B>man. So much that for the next six of it's visits to him. He</B>
<P><B>would leave a lantern lit at all hours of the night. Finally the man
had</B>
<P><B>had enough of the spirit which greatly unnerved him. He</B>
<P><B>ended up quiting his job and moved away. </B>
<P>
<P><B>There also is a highway which goes from North Vancover to a place
called</B>
<P><B>Horseshoe Bay. It also has a reputation for being haunted.</B>
<P><B>Legeend has it, that long before white men settled in the area. There
had</B>
<P><B>been a bloody indian battle which took place between 2</B>
<P><B>tribes. It had occurred in the general area of the highway. Sometimes
when</B>
<P><B>driving this highway late at night. There have been</B>
<P><B>reports of a inexplicable haze, or fog appearing for no logical
reason.</B>
<P><B>There also have been many car-accidents which have</B>
<P><B>happened on this highway and people have been killed as a result. Such
as</B>
<P><B>the freak mishap in which a woman was killed when a</B>
<P><B>large fallling boulder crushed her car. I believe the accidents and
the</B>
<P><B>haunting of the man in the cabin have a connection which is</B>
<P><B>shared with the highway. </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>The third and final haunting I've been informed about. Took place here
in</B>
<P><B>Chilliwack during the 1960's. A female artist had been living</B>
<P><B>in a house reputed to be haunted. One night while she lived in this
house.</B>
<P><B>She had a dream in which she saw a body of a woman</B>
<P><B>laying on the floor in one part of this house. Actually, a woman had
been</B>
<P><B>murdered in the house years before. Anyway, the</B>
<P><B>artist began to piant a piture of the vision in her dream. She had
to take</B>
<P><B>breaks in painting this picture and also had a very hard</B>
<P><B>time finishing it. Because this picture developed a mind of it's, OWN.
If</B>
<P><B>I'm correct, the picture of the figure of the woman would</B>
<P><B>move and paint itself. The face of the dead woman would also take on
the</B>
<P><B>appearence of a distorted, evil, and hidiously ugly</B>
<P><B>appearence. The artist was able to finally finish the picture. It was
later</B>
<P><B>put on display at a amusement built and ironically</B>
<P><B>called, The Haunted House. Which actually belonged to a local
Vancouver</B>
<P><B>radio-station. The picture was eventually sold and is</B>
<P><B>supposedly in storage somewhere in Vancouver. The artist had also sold
the</B>
<P><B>haunted house out here in Chilliwack. It later had</B>
<P><B>caught fire and burned to the ground. A new house now stands on the
site of</B>
<P><B>the former one. There also is an exhibit of somekind</B>
<P><B>about the haunted house in the Chilliwack Museum. I once went by the</B>
<P><B>property that the house stood on during the summer of 1996.</B>
