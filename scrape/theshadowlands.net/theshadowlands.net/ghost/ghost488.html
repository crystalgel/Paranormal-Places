<p class="MsoNormal"><big>New Story</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: QLD, Australia&nbsp; </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>'About a year ago, when I was
sixteen, I decided I was sick of sharing a room with my little sister.
Because
we didn't have enough bedrooms in the house, I decided to move into an
old
caravan we had which was only a few steps away from the back door of
the house.
I have had many experiences since then which I believe to be paranormal.&nbsp;
I had my dog in the caravan the night that I
saw the ghost. When I woke up the next morning, I had the most vivid
memory of
waking up in the middle of the night. I saw the top half of a man,
attempt to
go through one of the cupboards that are in the caravan, but he was
unable to.
He fell backwards after crashing into the cupboard and then
disappeared. He was
elderly, with the top half of his head bald, but with a ring of hair
around the
back of his head. His was wearing an old-fashioned light brown tartan
jacket.
As I said, I only saw the top half of this body, about from the
bellybutton up.
My dog didn't wake up at all, and I myself didn't feel neither
frightened or
threatened, so I feel that the ghost was not evil. When I told my
mother, she
didn't really believe me, but my Dad showed me a picture of his father,
who had
died about thirty years ago, and he looked very similar to the ghost I
saw. In
addition to this, about three or four months later, I woke in the
middle of the
night for no particular reason. As I lay there, attempting to go back
to sleep,
I heard what sounded like footsteps on the roof of the caravan. My
parents gave
the explanation of the heat or cold compressing the metal roof, but
this
doesn't explain why it sounded like human footsteps across the roof.
There were
about five steps, and it sounded sort of like someone was swaggering.
This
experience did frighten me, and even when the footsteps stopped, I
couldn't
sleep for hours afterwards. Another night, I woke at exactly 2:00am in
the
morning to the sound of a backfiring car. I pulled back the curtain to
one of
the windows, which faces the road. What I saw was the outline of an old
pickup
truck moving very slowly down the road in front of my house. This may
sound
normal, but it gave me an eerie feeling, and when I lay back down, I
could hear
the rumbling of the truck for a half hour after that, even though when
I looked
out the window again, the truck was gone. I found it odd that I could
still
hear the truck for at least a solid half hour even after it had passed
the
house. It felt paranormal to me.&nbsp; This
most recent even may not be paranormal, but it is eerie. Just recently,
I woke
up at 4:12am (I'm still in the caravan). I fell asleep about half an
hour
later, but when I woke, I found out that one of my Dad's friends had
died that
very morning. Apparently, he woke up at 4 in the morning, and his wife
went to
fix him breakfast (his job required an early start) and when she
returned about
ten minutes later, he was dead. Is it a coincidence that I woke at 4:12
in the
morning? That may very well be the exact time he died. All these
experiences
only began when I moved into the caravan, and although most of them are
frightening, the old man's ghost didn't scare me in the least. We don't
have
any past records on previous owners of the caravan, but I feel that
maybe
someone has died in there, and their restless spirit continues to be
earthbound.'</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Hi I have a story for you
about ten years ago my son his friends and myself went to Barkersville.
We had
an experience I will not ever forget,we were going to go in and we saw
a car
comming so we had left for about half hour or so.Then when we came back
there
was a candle in the window now mind you it was winter time so we looked
for
foot prints and saw nothing.So then we went inside and we were all
looking
around went up to the third floor checking it out wiyh flashlights and
bats in
hand I do not know why they brought them.Then we were all talking then
we heard
something we got chills and we heard it again it sounded like somebody
running
at us.We didn't see anything we all were looking so we heard it again I
told
them lets go it sounded like an angry step. So we left that place and
haven't
been back there again&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now my son lives and
runs The Mill in
Glens Falls and when I go to visit I feel things I saw one light in the
hall
flicker only when I was there because somebody came out of there apt it
stopped
when they left it started again,but as it was flickering I had a really
strange
feeling vercome me.One night while we were there our puppy has gone up
and down
the hallways all day with us and didn't bark or act strange,but that
night we
were going downstairs and he freaked out nobody else was there except
my
husband and I.He was really scared he didn't want to move when we got
back to
our apt I had a feeling of sadness hit me it was strange I felt sick
and dizzy.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Sturgeon Bay- Old Camper</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myangel_1996@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When I was five, I slept in
the old camper we owned and my great grandma slept in the camper with
me.We had
the stove light on. I woke up in the middle of the night and saw a
figure of a
boy. He was holding a box he showed me what was in it. In it there were
a pair
of binoculars and a two dollar bill. He showed me where it was. I woke
my great
grandma up and told her that there was someone in the camper. The stove
light
was off and the doors were locked. She turned a flashlight on and
looked around
with it. She didn't see anything. So she told me I was dreaming and to
go back
to sleep. But she had a feeling not a scared feeling a odd feeling. The
next
morning I told my mom, my dad and my great grandpa. They went in the
camper
with me. I showed them where it was and sure enough there was the box
with the
binoculars and the two dollar bill. My great grandma wanted me to
explain what
the boy looked like. When I was done explaining what he looked like she
said it
was her dead son when he was a boy. Ever since then weird things have
been
happening. Like my stereo going off when we were camping. My dad heard
the
crackling from a distance away. The box for it was duct taped shut. I
had it
one either f.m. or IPod. When it turned on it was on a.m.Then my dad's
jack
knife that he lost nine years ago appeared somewhere where he didn't
need it.
There was no dust on it and there was no spot in the dust where it was.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My Ex-Boyfriend</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xinabelle@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I loved my boyfriend, but I
had to leave for my own sake for several reasons.&nbsp; We were still
friends, and he and my new
boyfriend got along politely.&nbsp; I lost
contact with him after I told him it had been 4 years with my current
boyfriend.&nbsp; Two years later my boyfriend and I married in
September 2001.&nbsp; November 2001 is when I
got the phone call from someone that my ex-boyfriend and I knew.&nbsp;
I heard her voice, and before she could tell
me why she called&#8230;I asked her &#8216;did he do it&#8217;?</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>He had a long history of
depression and several attempts at suicide dating back to his teen
years.&nbsp; He was in his 50&#8217;s when he finally
succeeded.&nbsp; That night my husband and I
went to bed late after lots of crying.&nbsp; I
can&#8217;t remember what time it was, but it was still early morning and
very
dark.&nbsp; I thought I was dreaming.&nbsp; I was in bed looking ahead
of me.&nbsp; There was a pin of light standing 2 feet away
from the foot of the bed.&nbsp; The light was
at eye level of a human.&nbsp; I stared at it
for a long time.&nbsp; What I felt from it was
pleasant, warm, reassuring, calm, and full of peace.&nbsp; It had a
glow around it.&nbsp; It had been there for such a long time that I
started to realize I wasn&#8217;t fully asleep.&nbsp;
The pin of light expanded and grew a bright white.&nbsp; That is when I
bolted upright and became
startled because my eyes were hurting from the brightness.The moment I
shot up
is when the expanded white light shrank instantly back to the original
small
pin of light, and shot out the door to the hallway.I sat up in bed and
looked
around wondering what just happened.&nbsp; Was
it a dream?&nbsp; Everything in the dream was
everything in the room.&nbsp; The bathroom was
there, the bureau was here, my husband and I were in our places in the
bed, and
the door was over there.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t
dreaming after all.&nbsp; After this incident
I realized I don&#8217;t sleep with my eyes completely closed.&nbsp; When I
get ready to sleep I open my eyes
again because I see a light.&nbsp; The light
is from a street light or the window.&nbsp; My
ex-boyfriend&#8217;s visitation was in 2001.&nbsp;
To this day I still notice I sleep with my eyes slightly open because I
see light coming from the window.There were several other things that
happened
after this, but this one was the most significant of them all.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Strange Happenings &amp;
Dreams</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kat051985@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>About 20 years ago we moved
into a ranch style house on Grove Street in a small town in western
Illinois.&nbsp; I don't really remember when
strange things started to happen I just remember them happening well
most of
them anyways.&nbsp; I'm going to tell you the stories
that my family and I remember in no particular order.&nbsp; I never
liked sleeping in my room it always
gave off a weird vibe I mean I would go in there and play during the
day with
friends or sometimes even by myself I don't know what it was about it
but I
just didn't like it.&nbsp; In the summers
since my parents didn't make a lot of money we would all move into my
room
since it was the biggest and put an air conditioner in the window to
save on
the electric bill.&nbsp;&nbsp; One night the air
was off and the door was open because it was a cool night.&nbsp; My
parents bed was on the wall closest to the
door so they could see right out into the hallway well on this night my
mom was
awakened by a presence standing in the doorway of the bedroom she
couldn't see
it but she knew it was there she was so scared that she just baried her
head
into my dads back.&nbsp; A few days later she
found out her dad had died and wasn't found for several days she
believes it
was his presence in the doorway.&nbsp; We
would always here footsteps coming from the kitchen.&nbsp; This is one
of those times.&nbsp; My mom worked nights at this time so she
would sometimes sleep on the couch during the day.&nbsp; On this
particular day my brother and I were
at school.&nbsp; She started to hear footsteps
in the kitchen she was so scared that she grabbed her shoes and left
and didn't
come back until after she had picked us up from school.&nbsp; On other
occasions she's be sleeping on her
and my dads bed and something would shake the bed.&nbsp; I also felt
this one time when I stayed home
from school.&nbsp; Our attached shed was
directly behind my parents bed and my mom would hear someone walking
around in
there like boots on wood floor but the thing was is that it was a
concrete
floor.&nbsp; I forgot to mention that this
house stand right in front of a cemetary I'm not sure if it has
anything to do
with these experiences or not.&nbsp; One day
my mom also heard a music box playing we had music boxes at that time
but none
of them played that song.&nbsp; One final
thing on this house ever since we have moved away from there over 12
years ago
I dream about this house at least once a week sometimes paranormal
things
happen in the dreams sometimes not.&nbsp; I'm
not sure why it is strange and everytime I drive by there which I do
often
because it's only a few blocks away I wonder if anything strange is
happening
still?&nbsp; I've even condsidered renting it
again if the option arose.&nbsp; There were
other occurences that probably happened but I will have to find them
out and
write about them later. Oh, I almost forgot someone told us a long time
ago
that the house used to be a boarding home as well.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Shadow in Living Room</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anonymous</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>We bought an apartment in
downtown Shanghai as I was transferred to China for work. We have been
living
in this apartment for the last five years. One day not too long ago, we
were
doing some renovations in our guest bedroom. Our apartment is on the
12th floor.
As I am sure all high-rise apartment buildings have in common, we have
these
shafts hidden behind our interior walls that extend from the basement
to the
roof they are covered in concrete and look just like part of the wall
except
they butt our from the corner 10 or 12 inches. In our building, these
covered
shafts hold all the main piping for water, electricity etc. </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>&nbsp;</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>During the renovation, we
noticed that there was moisture leaking through the concrete wall that
created
little patches of dampness where the ceiling and the wall meet. Our
construction team asked us if they could cut away a small part of the
wall so
they could see if the pipes were leaking or if it was from some other
moisture.
Without thinking, we agreed as we didn't want any severe water damage
to take
place. So they cut two 6" x 8" squares in the column. They checked
for leaking pipes found no obvious water leakes and carried on with the
rest of
the renovation leaving the holes open as they were going to re-surface
all the
walls and paint once they were finished.&nbsp;
Our apartment has three levels. The first floor is the foyer, dining
room and kitchen, the second level is the main living area and master
suite and
the third level has two bedrooms and a full bath. It's not a full
staircase that
separtes each level but sort of a short half flight, a landing turn to
the
right then another short flight of stairs.Standing on the landing from
the
second level you can see clearly down into the first level and up to
the third
and vice versa. One night I am in our living room watching TV with the
dog and
she starts barking and staring at the stairwell. It is an apartment and
there
are three other units on our floor so anyone could be walking down the
halls
outside. Additionally, we also have this huge glass-block wall that
separates
our first floor interior with the hallway outside. Its about 9 feet
long and
floor to ceiling high. So, I really didn't think too much about it as
you can
see the blurred, opaque images of people walking down the hall. But she
is
standing there for a while on the landing looking down into the first
floor
then up to the third floor. It was weird, yes, but like I said, I just
dismissed it as living in an apartment. But it kept on happening for
days in a
row and then sometimes the dog would go tearing off upstairs and then
come
running downstairs. Its just my wife and I living here and she is
usually in
the master bedroom (on the same level as the living room) on the
computer or
watching TV. Again, weird, yes, but I just sort of dismiss it. </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>One night, I am sleeping on
my bed, my wife sound asleep next to me and the dog sleeping on the end
of the
bed when I am awkened by the bed shaking. Like some one putting two
hands down
on the mattress and pushing down. I am lying on my side, open my eyes
and the
shaking stops. I glance over at my wife, she's not moving, then glance
over at
the dog which is also sound asleep. I figure the dog was scratching
herself or
my wife was moving to one side or another and close my eyes. I fall
asleep (don't
know how long) but then again am awakened to the bed shaking. I open my
eyes
and do the same thing. My wife is lying still and the dog is snoring. I
close
my eyes again and then after a few minutes or so the same thing
happens. This
time I am lying on my back, I open my eyes, look up and to my surprise,
I see
these back swirls swirling about on the ceiling above me. I blink my
eyes for a
half second and they are now gone. I pause there in bed thinking about
what I
had just "thought" I saw and convince myself it was a dream and go
back to sleep. The bed shaking without the black swirls continues for a
few
more nights and one night during this time, I actually catch the dog
scratching
herself and thus shaking the bed. So, I write off these experiences as
no big
deal. I admit, I actually felt really relieved when I finally caught
the dog
causing the bed to shake. The renovation is now delayed because they
have not
found the source of the dampness. My wife tells me that on a few floors
above
us they have also found some dampness and they cut holes there to
inspect the
pipes as well. So, the bed shaking stops I am convinced it was the dog
and the
black swirls are forgotten.&nbsp; &nbsp;A few nights later I had a
conference call
late at night. We have a +12 hour time difference with the East Coast
USA. So
its past midnight I am upstairs in the other 3rd floor bedroom that we
converetd to a study with the door closed. I finish my call, start
doing some
emails and surf the web for an hour or two. I get up wanting to to go
the
kitchen downstairs to get a drink. I open the study door and the whole
apartment is dark. I take a step towards the landing and look down into
the
second level. I see this large black shadow in the shape of a pyramid
standing
in the living room directly in front of me at the bottom of the stairs,
I stop
dead in my tracks. It turns it's head (the top of the pyramid) to the
right and
around and looks at me. I apparently caught it from behind. There are
no eyes
that I can make out but it felt like there was a set of eyes looking
right at
me. We both pause locked in this mutual stare like we both stumbled
across
something we both weren't expecting. After what seemed like a few
minutes but
was probably only a few seconds, I instictively say, "get out of my
house,
you're not welcome here" (yes, I do watch too many ghost stories) It
smoothly flows to the left and in one fell swoop quickly flies down the
stairs
towards the first level. I am still standing there a little shocked at
what I
just saw. Collect myself and continue downstairs (turning on all the
lights as
I go) It was gone. I keep this little incident to myself and go to bed
where I
find my wife already asleep. The next morning I am getting ready for
work and
my wife is talking to me about something. I sometimes just hear her
talking and
am not paying attention to her as she is going on about what she has to
do
today, what her friends said etc, etc, then in passing she says
something that
immediately catches my attention. She's talking about a dream she had
last
night about this big black shadow with a lions head looking at her. I
know its
a cliche, but right then and there the little hairs on the back of my
neck
start acting up and that unexplainable "heavy" feeling associated
with it started to overwhelm me. I turn to her and say "what?" she
them tells me about how she dreamed this black shadow with a lions head
was
looking at her last night. She then goes on about something else and I
go back
to doing what I was doing, I walk downstairs out the door and go to
work.&nbsp; I don't have the heart to tell my wife what
happened to me the same night. But a few days later the construction
guys came
by and patched up the wall and since then, I haven't seen or felt
anything
strange. With my vivid imagination, I can imagine that maybe during
construction of our high-rise something may have happened. In China,
construcion safety for workers is not regulated like it is back home.
No OSHA
rules to protect workers from accidents. If somethng happens, it just
happens,
no one knows and no one says anything about it. If something got caught
in the
basement or foundation of this building then got sealed in by all the
concrete
it could still be there. Punching a few holes into these shafts may
have
allowed it access out. Who knows? </big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Personal Haunting</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; briangibbons20@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A personal
haunting..........&nbsp; A few weeks ago mt
wife was in the kitchen.She heard a scratching on our sliding glass
door.She
turn to look through it and saw nothing out there.She turned around to
the dinning
room table and heard behind her a voice,she turned around to find
nothing
there.It was about 1:00 AM when she came in our bedroom,and with tears
in her
eye's,asked me if I was just in the kitchen playing a joke on her.I
said that I
was asleep. Next she asked me if I would go in the kitchen and check it
out.Being a practicing occultist for over 15 years,I jumped at the
chance for
communication with what ever was bothering her.I tried to initiate
contact for
a half hour or so,but nothing would communicate with me.I have some
experience
with contacting spirits,but nothing would communicate with me. So I am
of the
opinion that this is a personal haunting.Maybe something she picked up
from the
past.The house has had numerous cleanings,and I have lived here for
over 10
years with no activity.Which leads me to believe that this has nothing
to do
with house or property.Has any else out there experienced anything
similar?</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My Story</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
fbichick31@roadrunner.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I saw on the site that you
can submit your stories, I have a few that are pretty interesting. Ever
since I
can remember I've seen people that weren't really there. When I was
young
around 4-5 yrs. old I woke up during the night, I saw a man standing
over me
slightly smiling. The next day I told my grandfather about the man and
I
described what I saw to him. He went into his bedroom and pulled out an
old
picture of his late brother, my great-uncle Kenny (whom I happen to be
named
after), the funny thing is he was the same man I saw standing over me
while I
was in bed the night before. The only thing is since this happened when
I was 4
or 5 yrs. old I see spirits everywhere, and I have dreams where I see
events
that will happen a day or two later, the weird thing is sometimes I
dream about
the people I see and I can see how, if it's a traumatic event, are
killed. Just
this past month at my school we had an anti-DWI, drunk driving crash
assembly,
there was an enactment of what would happen at a crash, everything was
fine
until the hearse pulled away. In the back looking at me through the
window was
a teenage boy, that night I had a dream that the boy had committed
suicide, a
few days later that boy I saw in the back of the hearse and in my dream
committed suicide.&nbsp; Ever since that I
haven't taken my dreams lightly. </big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My Ghost Stories</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; younggranny07@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Hi, my name is Nancy I am 47
years old and have had many experiences with ghosts. I mostly feel them
but on
many different occasions I have seen them. About 20 years ago I lived
in a very
active house, most of my experiences there were just seeing 1 young boy
ghost
but on one occasion I had a terrifying experience. Although I did not
see this
entity I can only say the feeling I had was absolutely EVIL!!&nbsp; The
ghost I seen on a regular basis was a
small boy I guess to be about six years old and he would appear in the
doorway
from my dining room&nbsp; to my kitchen. He
would just stand and look at me I never tried to communicate with him
and in
hindsight I wish that I had. He looked like he came from the 1800's he
was
dressed in a white T shirt and blue jeans no shoes on his feet either.
The
times I would normally see him would be in the evenings. We lived in
this house
for 4 years and I have to say I saw him hundreds of times, Then
suddenly I
started seeing him during the daytime hours for about a 3 week stretch.
Again I
never tried to talk to him and wished I had.&nbsp;
On December 3rd 1992&nbsp; we were all
getting ready to leave ( my husband and 3 children) the kids had school
and we
had to attend a funeral for my husbands aunt, before we left the house
I
smelled something not sure what it was I had asked my husband to see if
the
dryer was on, he did and said it was off. We left the house at 8:30 am.
When
the funeral was over I had to return to work. When I reached my job my
boss
came running out to tell me to go home my house was on fire. When all
was said
and done we lost everything but we still had each other. When the
firemen let
me go in to see if there was anything salvagable he showed me where the
fire
started and told me it was electrical between the floors but to my
amazement
the fire started EXACTLY where my little boy stood!! I really think he
was
trying to tell me something when he started showing up during the
daylight if
only I had asked him... When we had finally gone through the house room
by room
looking for anything we could. We closed each door as we finished each
room. I
went to the door leading outside and feeling very sad that I had to
leave my
little boy behind I said Good Bye and when I did one of the doors were
slammed
with so much power the house actually shook. I have lots of other
stories in
different houses that we lived in. In one house I lived in we had a
whole
family living in my basement. A man,women and 2 little girls. The
mother wore a
long hooped dress and the girls dresses were very frilly. We were
having a
birthday party for my daughter who was turning 6 at the time and my
brother in
law who was an absolute disbeliever in the supernatural actually seen
the girls
they came up from the basement and joined the party. My brother in law
was
walking into my house and the 2 girls were walking outside where the
rest of
the kids had gone, and he said "Who the hell are those girls in the
dresses"? There were no living girls wearing the dresses he described
but

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: breanna.hello@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>In 2002 we moved in to a
house out into the country for privacy reasons. We moved into the house
that I
now live in. My Dad is a very ambitious person, so he decided to build
a tree
house for us in the back yard. Me and my dad one day we're outside in
the back
cutting ply wood for the house, we had heard a loud scream inside. We
both
looked at each other and ran to Nicole's room ( This is my sister, and
the
screaming sounded like her voice ). We ran up the stairs to her room
and when
we got there we asked her if she screamed. She said she did not, we
then asked
if she heard a scream and she said that she didn't heard anything. So
we left
her room. By the time we got to the garage door, we heard the scream
again and
ran up to Nicole's room, and she was trying to get something off her
dresser it
seemed the tv had flown off the dresser and the dresser was falling on
top of
her. If my dad was not there at that moment or sooner she would have
surely
been crushed. It was too much to me to be a coincidence. Other things
that make
me a believer. when I was in about 3rd grade and still had my room to
myself, I
remember waking up one night feeling uneasy. I had the covers over my
head
because I was afraid that if&nbsp; I looked I
would see something. I finally got the guts to look and when I pulled
the
covers off my head , I saw a little girl standing right at my night
stand
smiling at&nbsp; me. She had long black hair
and round glasses, and sort of a green aura about her . When I saw her
I quickly
pulled my head under the covers and tried to sing myself asleep. I do
not think
that my specific house is haunted, but I do believe the woods
surrounding it
is. Near my house is a place in my town called whiskey Hollow road. The
road is
said to be very haunted and the woods surrounding it is the same woods
surrounding my house. The story is there that lots of satanic rituals
or KKK
things went on there were also these caves called the witches caves,
and the
story is , is that there was this man that was convicted of a crime and
was
stored out in a cabin awaiting his death. After he was killed his wife
hung
herself by a tree near the shack. I used to babysit two girls near my
house.
The younger one about 9, had a 'friend' named Jake. I don't really
believe in
the whole imaginary friend thing, but she had a pretty beefy story that
was
strange for a 9 year old to make up. She told me that Jake was killed
in the
woods in her back yard ( about 50 acrs of land) and that he kept their
family
safe from the 'Monsters' downstairs. Which kind of scared me because I
did not
like their basement. The first time I saw it I felt weird about it and
it is
significantly colder down there, even though it is not that far under
the
house. There mom Told me that their basement is over 100 years old, but
the
rest of the house was added a few years ago.</big><span
