<P><B>Boy in the Attic</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Black666Flag@netscape.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Me and my mother lived in a studio type house in colorado back in
2001</B>
<BR><B>sometime, It was small, The living room and the bedroom were connected</B>
<BR><B>with a big arch way opening. It had an attic, the opening was above
my</B>
<BR><B>mom's bed, I would hear things up there, moving around...all of
the</B>
<BR><B>time. One day, I was fed up, tired of wondering, tired of the fright,
so</B>
<BR><B>I crawled up into the attic and took a look around, I saw a figure
in</B>
<BR><B>the corner, It looked like a small boy with his head down and his
arms</B>
<BR><B>crossed around it. I was extremely frightened, so ofcorse I jumped
down</B>
<BR><B>real fast, My heart was pounding. I sat on my moms bed, so scared
that I</B>
<BR><B>couldn't move. I looked up and I could see a boy looking down at
me, he</B>
<BR><B>was wearing a suit, a green suit with a yellow under shirt, nice
dress</B>
<BR><B>shoes, the tip of his shoes hung over the edge of the opening, He
had</B>
<BR><B>pail brwn hair and his eyes were an icy blue green color, they sort
of</B>
<BR><B>glowed, his skin was pale, and you could see the veins all in his
face,</B>
<BR><B>his skin was so pale, you could see them. His hands rested at his
sides</B>
<BR><B>and he just stared down at me. I about died. I was so scared...After</B>
<BR><B>that I kept hearing a little boy in the corner of the living room
saying</B>
<BR><B>things in german. I remember that he repeated the word "Zerstorung"
over</B>
<BR><B>and over again...I hate it, it haunts me. I told my mother, she
didn't</B>
<BR><B>believe me. No one has...It's driven me insane!</B><B></B>

<P><B>A White Lady Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:ijeancYeshua@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was in El Paso Texas, at the age of five when it happened.</B>
<BR><B>It was just about dusk, and me and my sister who was seven were
playing outside.</B>
<BR><B>We were jumping on an old boxspring, when something in my head told
me to stop;</B>
<BR><B>and look. I stopped jumping...&nbsp; turned, and looked toward an
adobe fence at my right.</B>
<BR><B>Just in time to see a figure of a tall slender woman emerge from
it. She wore a long veil, and long tattered dress. It swayed slowly, and
she glided about a foot off the ground. She walked straight across the
yard which was about seventy feet wide.</B>
<BR><B>Then she disappear, as she entered the fence at the left side.</B>
<BR><B>My sister, who had stoped to see what I was looking at, watched
the whole thing. When it had disappeared she cried out, Aaaaaaaaa... ghosst!</B>
<BR><B>I didn't know what a ghost was, but I ran behind her because she
sounded scare.</B>
<BR><B>I never was afraid when it happened, I didn't know what it was.
I didn't think any thing. I just looked. We told our Uncle, and mother.
They went to check, but found nothing. My sister has always denied that
this ever happened.</B>
<BR><B>I have a memory like an elephant. I don't know why I saw this, but
I feel that it changed my way of thinking. I was a child, and I have always
remembered this.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Going through a divorce is rough business. I spent many nights crying
myself to sleep.&nbsp; One night I was laying in bed crying so hard asking
God what I did to be left alone like this.&nbsp; Tossing and turning I
just could not sleep.&nbsp; I cried and cried the whole night....Then I
heard a voice by the side of my bed.&nbsp; It was a deep male voice but
very quiet in tone....He said to me "I will never leave you".&nbsp; Funny

<P><B>By:&nbsp; lalunadeluna@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>When I was younger we had a beautiful cat who was half tabby and
half persian.&nbsp; I loved that cat more than anything he was my buddy.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well since he was always in and out of the house he contracted feline leukemia
and eventually had to be put down.&nbsp; One day I was in my room getting
dressed for work.&nbsp; I felt him walk between my legs and his tail wrap
around me like he used to do.&nbsp; I thought I was dreaming but I was
standing up in my room dressing.&nbsp; Was thinking it all over when my
mom who was in the bathroom putting make up on screamed.&nbsp; I was like
what is wrong she said a phantom cat just walked through my legs but there
is no cat. I told her it was just Mr. Puff saying hello.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Indian Summer</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ThaLizardKing22@cs.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My parents broke up when I was six years old. My sister and I would
stay in Flagstaff, Arizona with my mom most of the year. In the summer
we would go and stay with our dad, he lived in Texas.</B>
<BR><B>My dad and sister had gone to get some ice cream, I would normally
have gone with them, but i was in this really good chat room. I went to
the bathroom about 10 minutes after they left. When i was half way done
with my "work" when i smelled smoke and i rushed out of the bathroom with
my shorts still at my ankels and without wiping. When i was out there i
looked every where for the source of the smoke but didn't find it. Then
i peeked out the window and waw that there was nothing on fire out there.
Confused, i rushed back to the bathroom and finished doing what is was
doing.</B>
<BR><B>For weeks i went on like this. Most of the time it would happen
when i was alone. I would always smell smoke. The things got mo intense.
I was making my way to my room, but half way through the hall way i heard
this strage sound. I stood froze for a second but then listen to the sounds.
They got louder and they same aroma came to my attention once againe. The
only diffrence was it was stronger and only getting stronger. Then i realized
that tha sounds weren't just sounds i was screared. I heard a sort of chanting.
Then my sister was going to her room and barly touched my shoulder for
a second. I screamed and ran to my room.</B>
<BR><B>I tried telling my sister but all she could do is insult me. She
would say things like, "Don't lie" or "Your just tring to get attention"
and finally she would say "You don't have to lie to be cool". This really
made my feel crazy and mad.</B>
<BR><B>Then this one week was the worst of all. I was half-a-sleep when
i woke up in the middle of the night to get a late night snack. I ate some
milk and cookies and then i was on my way back to my room when i saw it.
The smell was back and so was the smell of rotting flesh. Along with tha
chanting there was.....i saw bodies burning in the hall way leading into
my room. There were so many bodies that i did not see one part of the carpet
in the wide hall way. Then i realized, these were indians. Then i heard
a sound in back of me and there were indians running around and dancing.
Then this one indian looked and me and charged with this one ax. I screamed
and then fainted.</B>
<BR><B>I woke up and it was seven in the morning and i didn't usally get
up until nine or ten. I found it hard to belive that my dad and sister
didn't hear me. For a second i thought it might have been a nightmare,
but then realized i was in the hall way. Then i went to the kitchen and
saw the dishes from my snack. At this point i know it was reall.</B>
<BR><B>I just had to know why this was happening, and more importantly
why was it happening to me. I saddly spent hours reading books but got
no where. I then looked to the internet. It tured out that my dad's house
was on one of the three blocks that was once sacred indian grounds where
indians once performed rituals. It had something to do with the memory
of the dead.</B>
<BR><B>I told my dad about what i found. He told me that he had know that
but that i should think resounably and forget about it.</B>
<BR><B>One night i was sleeping and woke up and saw my bed was in a field.
I was in the bed and i realized that it was in the middle of a ring of
fire. There was chanting and screaming while the indians were dancing around
me. There was a king or what ever, maybe a shaman in this one chair that
was on this one platform. Then i saw these one men carring these black
bags to a part of the field. Then i looked forward and was that these were
not bags. They were burned bodies. I screamed and jumped out of my bed
and landed on the carpet of my room. I was alone and saw that there no
one else in the room. I ran to the back yard to think about what i just
saw. I was kicking around at the dirt and grass. My foot maneged to hit
some thing and i dug it up and it was just a thick peice of string. So
i just kept on walking around. My foor hit something else and i just let
it be and returded to my bed. But before i got there i saw my dad coming
out of the bathroom and he asked if i was alright and i said i was fine.</B>
<BR><B>The next night i woke up and felt the same way i did before so i
went to the backyard and did the same as i did last night. I was woundering
about the thing that i hit last night. So i went to it and i realized it
was a neckless of some sort. I put it on. I went back in the house and
washed it alittle to get the dirt off. I cleanded it and it looked great.
I put it on and haven't taken it off ever since then. Ever since then the
reacuring visions never came to me ever againe.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Brother</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: kellitemp@earthlink.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My mother and i recently moved to Washington and into this huge house
about 3 weeks ago , and i was not happy about it......everything creeped
me out........anyways....the scariest thing happend just the other night......but
it all began a few days ago when my mother went out with a guy for some
coffee and i was left to unpack all of the crap she thought she needed
to have. well, i opened one of the boxes, and there was this picture of
my dad (he died 2 months ago in a shoot out) and it made me cry........and
i dont know if i imagined this or not, but i could've sworn that someone
was whispering in my ear "everything's okay now".....i was so incredibly
freaked out......but later i decided that i was just imagining things.
well, my mom has been really attatched to this guy....(i have no idea why....sorry.beside
the point.) and so i have been left home alone. all i ever do now is write
in a notebook, so i am pretty much in one spot all day doing the same thing......and
every once in a while, the tv would come on......i would think nothing
of it, and get mad, because i had to get off my lazy butt to turn it off.....but,
as soon as i would sit down, it would come back on again. after that happened
about a few times, i was a little scared, so i decided to un plug it.....
but then the same thing woul happen with the stereo, or the microwave......weird,
huh?.......so after almost peeing my pants a few times of fright, i ran
through the house wildly unplugging every appliance there was.....my mom
is really scared for me.....she thinks i am sick, and need some help....i
have spent every waking hour (which is about 20 hours a day, cuz i never
sleep) looking up ghost stories on the internet, studying books at the
library, and i evern found a lady that lives in town that is all crazy
like the ones you see in movies that have the tarrot cards, and crystal
ball and all that stuff......so i went to her.....after tossing rose pedals
on me, and asking me questions, and playing with her tarrot cars, she decided
that a 2 ghosts wanted to get a hold of me.......she said that one was
my brother, and the other was my dad........i was so mad......i dont even
have a brother!!!!....but, how would she know about my dad.....lucky guess
maybe????....i told my mom later about this, and she got mad at me, and
said she didn't want me seeing "Isabella" anymore.....typical name for
a fortune teller, huh? anywho, the scariest thing that had happened to
me the other night was.......that when i was unpacking some more of my
moms stuff, while she was out enjoying herself, i came across a really
big box.....and i opened it up, expecting nothing unusual.....but of course,
i did. there was this little tin box, it use to hold beads and string that
mom and i use to make bracelets out of.....and i was excited to see it,
because i use to love doing that.....so i opened it up. no beads, no string.
just a small envelope with big red letters that said "Emergency" on it.
i am like, the nosiest person on the planet, so i opened it up.....it was
to my mom. it talked about how her son had died in a car accident in Nevada
somewhere........and i thought, this cant be to my mom....but as i read
on, it talked about how, her "son" was a good foster care kid.....and if
this accident wouldn't have happened, he would be coming back home in no
time.......</B>

<P><B>Haunted House in Framingham</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: SEASURF@peoplepc.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I lived in Framingham Ma. for six years, and since I can remember
the house has been haunted with spirits of mischief.&nbsp; I moved two
years ago from the house but this is what I remember.&nbsp; The first sine
of the house being haunted was when I was about five.&nbsp; I was going
to sleep on a stormy night when the power was out.&nbsp; My little brother
had a windup horse that after not being touched started playing music all
by it self.</B>
<BR><B>A nother thing that happened that was extremely weird was with a
painting my Dad had of our second cousin, Bully, who was in world war two.&nbsp;
He had died a wile back.&nbsp; I went down in the basement where the picture
was and the eyes of the painting moved back an fourth at me.&nbsp; My dad
had also recently gone down to the painting and it was swining back and
fourth, the bacment has no windows for wind to mouve it.</B>
<BR><B>The last thing that happened was when my family was outside, and
my dad was on the phone, I was walking through the kitchen and a green
container cover came flying out of no where and hit the pans rite next
to me.</B>
<BR><B>After that, other minor things would happen.&nbsp; Some like food
would dissapear, I used to hear a woman singing when no one was awround.&nbsp;
I eaven saw a blure of wite color mouving through my room, and once in
the bacment.&nbsp; It was just like a ghost.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Dorm Closet</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jspencer@binaryoffice.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>After my first year of College and dorm life I moved off campus with
a group of my friends that I made while living in the dorms on campus.
For summer work, until we started the fall semester we worked at the dormitories
that we had once lived in. During the summer the University of Nebraska
rented the rooms out to camps and student conferences. Our job was to do
the linen services and clean the rooms once they had left. But our first
task was cleaning all of the hundred of dorm rooms that the student population
had trashed from the prior two semesters. We went from room to room picking
up trash and dusting everything off. Each room had two desks and two closets.
First we would clean the rooms and then we would come back through each
room dusting off the shelves and closets with those feathery duster things.
On the third floor our supervisor tells us that several years ago a student
had hung himself in one of the closets because of the grades he received
and it was said to be haunted. I don't remember exactly which room but
lets say room 315. So as we made our was to room 315 we were talking about
what might happen and getting psyched up. My friend Cindy and I entered
room 315 and she was afraid to clean the closet so being daring as I was
I reached in both and joking got inside and shut the door and was making
fake choking noises. Nothing happened. We finished dusting and went to
the next room relieved that nothing had happened. I went to clean the closet
on the left side of the room and Cindy the other as we had been doing.
Suddenly she let out a scream and dropped her duster and ran out of the
room holding her hands to her chest. She was nearly hysterical, face white
and eyes red with tears. She finally explained that as she reached into
the closet she felt an icy hand grip her arm. Well we were all skeptical.
Our supervisor had told us that it was 315 not room 314. At the end of
the day our supervisor was relating the story to the maintenance guys when
one of the guys immediately corrected her that it was positively Room 314
that the male student had hung himself in and it was that very closet that
Cindy had reached into.</B>

<P><B>A Silent Hello</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: firebreathing_icedragon@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi, I'm 17 years old and am no stranger to the etherial world.&nbsp;
These are</B>
<BR><B>just two of many of my experiences:</B>
<BR><B>1st story:I guess it was about 4 years ago now, when I was living
in a</B>
<BR><B>cramped up little townhouse with my mom and brother.</B>
<BR><B>Unsurprisingly, it was night when it happened, and of course, no
one else</B>
<BR><B>was there. (Not that my paranormal occurances always happen like
this.)&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>was on the couch in the living room in the dim light and suddenly
had an</B>
<BR><B>inclination to look up from my thoughts at the stairs (which lead
up to the</B>
<BR><B>right).&nbsp; As I watched a kind of mid-air shadow formed.&nbsp;
I've seen a lot of</B>
<BR><B>similar things, like these space fabric distortions where it feels
like</B>
<BR><B>there's something there, so this wasn't anything really new, but
it felt</B>
<BR><B>different somehow, more pronounced.&nbsp; Then, very quickly, I
saw features</B>
<BR><B>filling in the shadow, and realized it was the visage of my grandpa
who had</B>
<BR><B>shed his earthly body in 1995!&nbsp; Nothing was spoken, but I knew
he was</B>
<BR><B>checking in as a 'hello'.</B>
<BR><B>Needless to say, I was startled, but not really scared.&nbsp; It's
just that I'd</B>
<BR><B>never seen an spirit like that before, in such detail.</B>
<BR><B>2nd story:&nbsp; I woke at 2:55a.m. on September 23, 2002 and looked
at the end</B>
<BR><B>of my bed, and saw a rather good looking young male entity (looked
about 25</B>
<BR><B>or so) leaning on his elbows, hands as if praying, but to the side
of his</B>
<BR><B>face so his head was resting on them.&nbsp; He was looking down.&nbsp;
I wasn't</B>
<BR><B>frightened, only thinking, "Oh, there's someone by my bed.&nbsp;
Ok."</B>
<BR><B>"What is your name?" I asked him.&nbsp; He looked up and I knew
his name was</B>
<BR><B>Scott Anderson.&nbsp; It must've been telepathic because he didn't
actually say</B>
<BR><B>anything.</B>
<BR><B>I don't know anyone by that name, and I don't even know if it was
a spirit</B>
<BR><B>from the Other Side; he might be someone who's incarnated but just
astral</B>
<BR><B>travelling (or in other words, having an out-of-body experience).</B>
<BR><B>If anyone wants to share stories/inquiries via email with me, it's</B>
<BR><B>firebreathing_icedragon@hotmail.com.</B>
<BR><B>Thanks very much for letting me share my experiences.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The House on the Dead End Road</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: locofritolay@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was eight years old we moved into the big, brick house on
Seventh avenue in Sterling,Illinois. It was the last house on a dead end
road next to the Rock River. From day one strange events happened in the
house. My mother found these old hat pins</B>
<BR><B>stuck into the woodwork in the main room's closet. She decided that
she wanted to put the pins in a frame and use them for decoration, and
as she pulled the first pin from the wall she heard a loud, ear piercing
scream which seemed to flow through her. She decided to put the pin back
into the wall. I heard whispers in the night quite often for all the years
I spent at the home, as well</B>
<BR><B>as girlish giggles and strange sights. My best friend stopped spending
the night after claiming he seen the face of a little girl staring at him
through my bedroom window. I was about 10 when I too seen this little girl
staring into my bedroom window. I pulled the blanket over my head and when
I finally found the nerve to pull it from my head the girl was standing
next to my bed and reached out to me. I jumped up and ran as fast as I
could to the top floor where my parent's bedroom was and woke my mother
up and explained what I had seen. At first she told me I had a scarry dream
and told me to go back to bed but after seeing how frightened I was she
told me to come sleep by her and my father. As I entered the room I seen
that the girl was in my mom's rocking chair and a teenage boy stood by
her. Next to my mom's bed an elderly woman stood next to the window. I
screamed and pointed to the woman and my mom rolled over and claimed to
see something shadow like shrink to the floor. My mother was spooked and
couldn't sleep, even waking my father who would always laugh at the home's
ghost stories. Later that night as she lay awake she</B>
<BR><B>seen a ball of light float throughout the room. Once she seen a
pool of blood in the bathroom coming from the closet and called the police
but by the time they arrived the pool of blood mysteriously disappeared.
When my aunt was sitting us she heard banging and laughter out back but
everytime she'd look noone was there. Then the back door slammed shut.
She called police who searched the home and area to find nothing. Friends
who stayed over would claim a little girl woke them in the night and would</B>
<BR><B>softly sing. My family moved when I was 14 and I now reside in Wisconsin
but years back as I was in town visiting relatives I decided to show my
girlfriend the house I would tell her about. Ofcourse I had to make it
spooky and show her the home late at night and it indeed is a scarry looking
home with it's brick,stone shingalls,ornamental ironwork and being on the
dark dead end road. We walked along the river and listened to the locusts
make their wicked noise and as we left I stopped her by the wooden</B>
<BR><B>barrier at the end of the road(the road to this day is still brick
as it has been for a century)for a kiss and as we kissed she pulled away
and gasped a "My God,Jaye,look," and I looked to see the face of the girl
I'd seen years ago so often, looking down from</B>
<BR><B>the top floor window which had been my brother's room. And she was
waving at us and smiling. To this day I wonder. Was she waving hello or
was she saying good-bye?</B>

<BR><B>Woman in the Alley</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Lilbrave07@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>About two or three years ago, I had a friend stay the night at my
house, (then I was about, eleven or twelve, I am fourteen now). We had
decided to get on the internet&nbsp; and talk to my sister that lives in
Florida. As we were talking to her, she asked me if I was expecting company,
when I told her no, she got a little scared.</B>
<BR><B>I asked her why she said that, and she told me, "Because someone's
in you alleyway, under a lamp post." She had never been to my house before,
so this kind of scared me of how accurate she was about my house. My friend
immediately went under the computer desk, and I went to the back window
to look. Sure enough, there was somebody standing there, but then, they
started heading to the house.</B>
<BR><B>My sister had pointed out to me that every time we talked about
her, she would get closer and closer to the house, but we kept talking
about her anyway. She told me that the lady was at the back gate, and as
soon as she said that, the gate opened. And that scared me. She had told
me that the lady never got into my house, but a few weeks ago, she did.</B>
<BR><B>Me and my boyfriend were online talking, and he had me put my webcam
on so that he could see me. He knows about my sixth sense, and about how
I can see/ communicate with unknown things at certain times, so he decided
to mess with me. He said, "Look, behind you" I knew he was joking, so to
slickly pull off looking behind me without him knowing, I just looked at
my webcam. Then I saw her. She was wearing 1800s clothing. I told my boyfriend
there really was something behind me, and he took a look.</B>
<BR><B>He noticed the woman behind me, and started to feel bad for me,
because he had messed with me about that. He didn't see what she did, but
I saw it. I was looking at her on my computer screen, and she turned and
looked at me. Then she started to come towards me. And that freaked me
out majorly, then my boyfriend watched on my webcam me trying to push things
away that were touching me. I think it was that lady, but I haven't seen
her since, nor have I stayed up late enough to see her again.</B>

<BR><B>The Three Haunted Houses</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: PuNkRaWkcHiCk911@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>Recently, my family and I visited 3 haunted houses in Old Town San
Diego. They were the William Heath Davis House, The Villa Montezuma, and
The Whaley House. We were told that these three particular houses were
some of the most haunted spots in California, especially the Whaley house.
Personally, I love the thought of ghosts existing and begged my mom and
dad to take my brother and I on a tour of the houses.</B>
<BR><B>The first house we stopped at was the William Heath Davis House.
It's a small little country style house in the Gaslamp Quarter. It wasn't
scary at all to me, but when we left, my mom told me she had felt something
unusual. She told me as soon as she stepped into the basement of the house
her heart started to beat rapidly and didnt stop until the minute she stepped
off the property back into the trolley. Now, my mom isnt one to get scared
easily, or to lie about something like that. As a matter of fact, nothing
really scares her. And it was kind of odd how it started as soon as we
got there and it left the moment she did.</B>
<BR><B>The second house we went to was the Villa Montezuma. This house
had a very evil presence around and in it. This, we soon found out from
the guide, was because the owner of the house in 1887, held "seances" in
the house. He'd call up spirits from Chopin and Motzart and one would play
his right hand while the other would play his left. This man was very demonic
looking and had dragons hanging off of every ledge of the house. He even
had one wrapped around a pole sticking out of the highest tower. My mom,
now joined by myself, felt the same rapid heartbeat as soon as we stepped
into the room where he supposivley held the seances. As soon as we stepped
out of the room, it stopped. As we left the house, we could've sworn we
heard a pianist playing, but the tour guide had left with us and locked
up the house, so how could he be playing it?</B>
<BR><B>The final house we went to was The Whaley House. My mom and I didnt
expirience the heartbeat this time, but we did capture some pretty disturbing
pictures on our digital camera. One was in the kitchen of the house. After
we took it, we tilted the camera up and saw a perfect face, (claimed to
be Mrs. Whaley), on the wall. Other tourists took this picture, but nothing
came up. The tour guide also had told us that the house had been the location
of many hangings because just inside was a court room (which we got to
see). Many people had died there and he said that some people have claimed
to feel a tightening around their neck as the walk through a certain archway
in the house. One tourist felt this, needless to say, it wasnt me or my
mom, so i dont know if he was speaking truthfully or not. My mom, before
we went into the courtroom, took a picture of it. It was pitch black and
she really didnt know what she was aiming at. But when she took the the
picture, it came out perfect with no orbs or anything in it. About 10 minutes
later, when the tour was over and we were leaving the house, I asked my
mom to let me see the picture of the courtroom again. This time, there
was a perfect orb in the center of the picture that hadnt appeared when
the picture was taken. It was almost as if it was put there by someone/thing.
And as we left the house, we saw the plants by the well in the back yard
bristle. There being no wind at all, we asked the tour guide about it.
He told us that Mr and Mrs Whaleys daughter had tried to commit suicide
at that well. The whole tour was more interesting than scary. I actually
thought it was cool to feel like i was being haunted by somebody!!</B>

<BR><B>Same Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Angelndevil676@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have a lot of ghost stories in my family.Some I can tell you and
some I would have to ask people about, but I will tell you a few .</B>
<BR><B>The first one happened last night.I am really close to all my cousins
and see them all the time.Last night at 12:35 I walked into my parents
room and told them I heard my cousin screaming on my computer,but my computer
wasn't on.My parents sent me back to my room thinking I was dreaming.This
morning my aunt called my mom and said that last night at 12:25 my cousin
came into my aunts room and said that she saw a ghost.Ten minutes later
she came back into their room and said that the ghost wouldn't leave her
alone.That was the same time I heard her screaming.</B>
<BR><B>This story is about the same ghost as the last bugging the same
girl.One night my two cousins were sitting on the couch and one of them
fell asleep while the other was still watching tv.The one that wasn't sleeping
left to go to the bathroom and when he returned a ghost was playing with
his sisters hair.</B>

<BR><B>Residential Home</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: susiex1000@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My mother worked for a residential home in Caldwell Idaho since I
was born.&nbsp; When I was a small child I would get to go to work with
her.&nbsp; I have always loved this building and visiting it was a thrill
for me. I especially loved being there at night because it was so quite
and mysterious.&nbsp; One time I was in the living room rocking in a rocking
chair when I heard pounding noises behind my head.&nbsp; At first I thought
it was one of the residents making noises in their room when I realized
that that would have been impossible because their was no room behind me,
only a window that looked outside. The living room portion of the building
extended out past the rest of the building.&nbsp; No one could have been
behind that wall banging it!&nbsp; And the banging noise came right above
the window.&nbsp; No one could reach that high.&nbsp; I looked outside
and saw nothing, I turned back around and sat quietly for a little bit.&nbsp;
I then heard what sounded like footsteps coming near me, it stopped at
the chair beside me. I then saw the chair beside me move and the imprint
of what appeared to be someone sitting in the chair.&nbsp; I got up and
ran as fast as I could to the employee lounge and stayed there the rest
of the shift.&nbsp; Another time when I was there, it was right after the
first incident, I was standing in the living room staring over at the place
where I had my first scare.&nbsp; I was standing there just staring at
that rocking chair when I felt a hand on my shoulder.&nbsp; I turned to
look thinking it was my mother, and no one was there. But I could still
feel the hand on my shoulder.&nbsp; Again I ran as fast as I could back
to the lounge.&nbsp; I didn't go there as much after that, at least when
it was dark, untill I graduated hight school.&nbsp; I went to work there
with my mother.&nbsp; At this time my mother worked graveyard and so I
decided to work graveyard along side her.&nbsp; I heard of stories about
the employees seeing ghosts and hearing strange noises.&nbsp; They also
talked about a ghost that they called the "knocker" who would go around
knocking on the walls.&nbsp; I experienced the knocker a few times during
my time there.&nbsp; One time when it was halloween I was walking down
to the basement to do laundry when I heard knocking above my head.&nbsp;
There was a knock for every foot step I took.&nbsp; When I stopped, it
stopped.&nbsp; After a couple times of this I pretended to take a step
and didn't.&nbsp; Sure enough there was the knock!&nbsp; I ran upstairs
and wouldn't go back down until my coworker would come with me.&nbsp; We
would also hear people walking around upstairs and furniture being moved.&nbsp;
When we would go check it out we would find everyone asleep and the furniture
not moved.&nbsp; We would also see flashes of blue light coming from the
dinning area and hear the refridgerator door open and close.&nbsp; We would
go investigate thinking it was one of the residents and no one would be
there.&nbsp; There was also a couple of times when my coworker and I would
see what looked like a flashlight go across the window that seperated the
dinningroom from the livingroom.&nbsp; We decided that was a light coming
into the room from the window.&nbsp; But we don't know who could be outside
doing it since there is a field behind the building. But we decided that
is what it is.&nbsp; Everything else we can not explaine.&nbsp; We have
also heard people on the roof and when we would go outside to investigate
we would find nothing.&nbsp; Also when I would go into the library when
it was quiet I could hear people talking.&nbsp; It is real quiet and muffled,
but I can hear it.&nbsp; None of my coworkers could though.&nbsp; I was
the only one that could hear that.&nbsp; There was also an incident that
happened to my mom when she was at work that landed her in the hospital
with a smashed shoulder.&nbsp; She was upstairs doing rounds and had just
finished when she proceded to walk down the ramp.&nbsp; She had just finished
one section of the ramp and turned to procede down when she felt something
push her from behind.&nbsp; She flew all the way down the ramp and hit
the wall at the bottom.&nbsp; She ended up in the hospital and had to stay
in bed for a while.&nbsp; She still swears today that it felt as if someone
had pushed her.&nbsp; It couldn't have been any of the residents because
they were all asleep.&nbsp; That was the only time someone was injured
by an unseen person.&nbsp; She still continued to work there.&nbsp; When
time when I was upstairs cleaning the bathroom I heard someone whisper
my name.&nbsp; I went and checked on the resident that was accross the
hall thinking it was her.&nbsp; She was asleep.&nbsp; I checked the rooms
around the bathroom and found everyone asleep.&nbsp; I could her my coworker
cleaning the bathrooms downstairs and asked her if she called me.&nbsp;
She said she didn't.&nbsp; I proceded back to cleaning when I heard it
again.&nbsp; This time it sounded like it came from the bathroom where
I was at.&nbsp; Like the person was right beside me.&nbsp; I decided the
bathroom was clean enough and hurried downstairs.&nbsp; Not long after
that I went to work elsewhere.&nbsp; Not because of these incidents but
because I was offered more money.&nbsp; I would loved to stay there.&nbsp;
Even though I got freaked out at times.&nbsp; That place was home to me.&nbsp;
It had been a part of my life and will always be.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Our Old House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: KirbyTJR@cox.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi, my family and I realized some things at our old house in Wichita,
Kansas but never talked about it until a year or so after we moved out.
I was the only one who saw anything but we all noticed something wrong
with this place.</B>
<BR><B>First of all you should know how our house is arranged. After you
enter with the front door there will be a large room, the living room.
To the right of the front door is a staircase leading down to the basement.
From the living room head right to enter the kitchen and left to head down
a hallway. The hallway has four doors, two on the west wall, one on the
east, and one at the south (how it looks if you turn sideways after walking
down the hall). The first west door leads to a bathroom. Second leads to
the room that was my brother's and my bedroom for most of the time. It
was later changed to the guestroom a few months before we moved out. The
door at the east led to my sister's room. The south led to my parent's
room. Back in the living room there is a door that leads to the backyard,
which is pretty big.</B>
<BR><B>The basement is one gigantic family room, but near the south wall
(from were you get off the staircase. is a door leading to another bathroom.
To the east of the bathroom is the door leading to the laundry/storage
room, and across from there is the guest room, later changed to my and
my brother's room.</B>
<BR><B>The first time someone noticed something was when my mom awoke in
the middle of the night. She heard someone talking. Thinking someone left
the TV on, she checked every room with a TV. None of them were on. Thinking
she was imagining things, she went back to sleep. I think all of us kids
knew there was something odd in this house. We didn't sleep in our own
rooms (don't laugh) until we were around 6. Our parents waited till we
fell asleep before carrying us back to our rooms.</B>
<BR><B>Many times when I slept in my parent's bed I looked to their closet
(which was across from their bed) and I'd see a smokey figure of a person
moving out of it towards the bed. Every time I closed my eyes, even for
a second, they'd vanish. I don't know if it was part of my overactive imagination
(I was about 4 when I first saw them) or something else. Either way I was
the only one who saw them.</B>
<BR><B>My dad plays the game Age of Empires (You've heard of it, haven't
you?) almost every night. At our old house, he says he felt like there
was someone sitting behind him watching him...just watching. When he turned
to look back, nothing is there. Take note that the computer was in the
basement, which was where most of the happenings (or whatever you want
to call them) occured.</B>
<BR><B>Our burgalar alarm once went off in the middle of the night for
no apparent reason whatsoever. The major creepy place is the laundry room.
Everytime anyone set foot in there they felt someone watching them. My
mom hated doing laundrey in there and once it was done, she grabbed it
and ran upstairs. The guest room (later my room) was the "safe room." Nothing
happened in there. No one felt anything in there either.</B>
<BR><B>That's all, I know It's all little things but it really creeped
us all out. Thanks for reading this.</B>

<P><B>New House Move</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: SDear17156@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Thanksgiving of 2001 we moved to a house in Philadelphia.&nbsp; I
knew that the</B>
<BR><B>previous owners had been elderly and that the woman's husband had
died five</B>
<BR><B>years before.&nbsp; I also understood that her brother, who lived
with her, was sick</B>
<BR><B>with cancer.&nbsp; After all the construction was done and my family
moved in I began</B>
<BR><B>to notice that the door of my son's room had a mind of it's own.&nbsp;
I'd close</B>
<BR><B>it and it would open.&nbsp; Not unusual in houses on doors&nbsp;
with springs.&nbsp; However,</B>
<BR><B>the second weeek there I noticed the door kept opening.&nbsp; What
I mean is that</B>
<BR><B>the door knob turned, right in front of my eys and opened.&nbsp;
Now most would have</B>
<BR><B>run, but being a mom of four kids I was used to surprises and even
more used</B>
<BR><B>tohaving to explain myself.&nbsp; So, I simply told this whoever
that I needed the</B>
<BR><B>door closed so that our baby didn't venture into it and hurt herself
on her</B>
<BR><B>older brother's toys and junk.&nbsp; To this day I haven't had the
problem.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Even stranger the next week I was talking to my parents, who
go often on</B>
<BR><B>cruises.&nbsp; Not as guests,but as entertainment.&nbsp; She told
me she met the previous</B>
<BR><B>owner of our house at a hotel in florida.&nbsp; When my mom asked
her how she was</B>
<BR><B>the woman answered that she was just getting up from the traditional
7 days</B>
<BR><B>mourning that jewish people observe when a close relative dies.&nbsp;
Her brother, the</B>
<BR><B>one who lived in my house with her, had died.&nbsp; Oddly the date
that the most</B>
<BR><B>activity occured with the door matches exactly the date from when
he passed to</B>
<BR><B>the date she got up from mourning.</B>

<BR><B>My Haunted Life</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: CrzyRckr10@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>For as long as I can remember I have had experiences.&nbsp; My parents
and I were living in a house built in 1890.&nbsp; The first thing I remember
happened when I was about 2.&nbsp; I was sound asleep and was awakened
suddenly by voices near my bed.&nbsp; When I opened my eyes I saw many
figures standing around my bed dressed like Native Americans.&nbsp; When
I tries to ask who they were they just looked at me and then faded into
nothing.&nbsp; This happened every night for 2 years.</B>
<BR><B>Then we moved in with my grandmother.&nbsp; Her house was built
by my great grandfather in 1913.&nbsp; While we lived there I allways heard
foot steps in the attic which was right over my room.&nbsp; When I checked
the livingroom my parents were sleeping in their bed and my grandmother
worked at night so I knew it wasnt anyone I knew.&nbsp; I would also hear
footsteps on the front porch where there was a pile of boxes and no room
to move through there.&nbsp; When I asked my mom about it she told me that
that is the pl;ace my great grandfather was found dead.</B>
<BR><B>We soon moved to where we are now.&nbsp; My parents had our house
built on the foundation of a house that had burned down in 1989 killing
the owner and his dog.&nbsp; I allways hear footsteps around my house when
everyone else is asleep.&nbsp; I also see shadows moving around and sometimes
I hear the bathroom sink running and when I go to check on it it is off.&nbsp;
The land the house is on was also farmland in the 1700's.&nbsp; Once in
a while I hear hooves running around my yard .&nbsp; After some research
I found out that the land that the house is built on was where the stables
were.</B>
<BR><B>Every thing I have just said is all true.&nbsp; I have more stories
but I will save them for another time.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Friends Brothers House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: shelly_m_108@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>A while ago I went over to my friend Amys house and all her family
were there talking about something that had happened to her mother earlier
that day. What it was, she had been at her sons house helping to clean
up before a party we were going to have the next day, and she was hoovering
on the stairs whilst her nephew Kevin was downstairs trying to get the
fire to work. Anyway, all of a sudden she heard this loud screaming in
her ear, the kind of screaming you do when you're in trouble. In a rush
she turned off the hoover and ran downstiars because she thought Kevin
had set himself on fire or something, but when she got there panicking,
asking him what was wrong he just looked at her as though nothing had happened,
he hadnt heard anything. Now this isnt the only thing that happened at
that house, as another day a few weeks after that incident, Amy, her sister
in law and myself were going into town but before Sally (her sister in
law) had a meeting with an estate agent to value her house, so we went
there first. After he had a good look around he sat down in the living
room with all of us discussing the values, when we heard the kettle turn
on. This is something that happens all the time, even when it isnt plugged
in, but what makes this incident so special is that its the first time
I had witnessed it myself. We all just looked at eachother, you could tell
we were scared, especially me! When the estate agent had gone we were about
to go out the back door, and if you stand at the back door and turn around
you are facing the kitchen, so we turned around to get a quick glance and
each of us saw that the kettle had been dragged right to the front of the
work top, so far forward that if you pushed it any further it would fall
off.</B>

<P><B>My Experience from England</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Adcock_94@hoymail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>my name is william adcock and i am from Norfolk in England.</B>
<BR><B>I would like to share with you some strange experiances that have
happened over the past few years. My experiance happened when i was out
walking late one evening. I was walking through quite a squelchy boggy
field and it was about 9oclock in the evening (i say 9oclock but im'e not
that shure it may have been later)</B>
<BR><B>It was getting dark so i decided to head for home. when i was abot
halfway through the field i asw what looked like a gangaly old man carrying
a bright lantan in front of</B>
<BR><B>him. I began to feel uneasy becourse the figar was walking towards
me. There was</B>
<BR><B>also a sort of bluish haise surounding him and then i heard him
laughing. It was the sort of laugh you would expect to hear from an old
man but it was much louder.</B>
<BR><B>He was still walking towards me so at that point i decided to leg
it.I could still hear his laughter behind me allthough it grew steadily
fainter. When i came to the gate of the field i looked behind me and he
was still there. I could no longer see him clearly</B>
<BR><B>but i could still see his outline and the bluish haise that surounded
him. I ran all the way home and when i got there i locked the door and
leapt into bed. I had no doubt that what i saw was something supernatural
and it was was long before i&nbsp; sleept again.</B>
<BR><B>Another strange thing that happened was that about a week later
someone else said they had seen this ghost. It was in the local newsletter.
The newsletter said that</B>
<BR><B>an old lady had seen something when she was out walking her dog
and that she had came running to the nearset house where she had fainted
on the door step. Her dog was found about a day later but it wouldn't let
anyone go near it and it start barking uncontrolably if you tried to pick
it up. The strange thing was that she had been walking on the same field
as i had been a week before.</B>
<BR><B>But one of the stangest things was that last year i heard in the
local newspaper (wich is called "Hempnall Today") that this single woman's
son had come home from a night out with his friends, a gibbering wreck
and he was positivly certain he had seen the black shuck. The black shuck
is said to be a huge black ghost dog that roams around the east of england.
Black shuck os said to me an omen of death</B>
<BR><B>or ill fortune and a year to the day later he was involved in a
seriouse road accident.</B>
<BR><B>I don't know what you think but to me that not a coincidence.</B><B></B>

<P><B>When i was about 11 or 12 years old, my grandfather passed away.
We had</B>
<BR><B>recieved a phone call from my grandparents neighbours wanting my
parents</B>
<BR><B>to go to the house and make sure everything was ok. They had been
trying</B>
<BR><B>to call for a while and were very questionable because they knew
my</B>
<BR><B>grandfather was done the chores out in the barn and should have
been in</B>
<BR><B>the house to answer the phone. Well my parents were out so my oldest</B>
<BR><B>brother Dave went drove out there to check it out. About 15 mins
after</B>
<BR><B>he left he called. I knew something terible had happend by his voice.
I</B>
<BR><B>insisted that he tell me what was goin on but he told me not to
worry</B>
<BR><B>about it and try and get a hold of my parents. Dave had found my</B>
<BR><B>grandfather dead on the kitchen floor. Optopsy didn't help any.
The</B>
<BR><B>doctors say it looked like he died from an asma or heart attack.</B>
<BR><B>Anyways, a couple months later my grandmother invited me out for
the</B>
<BR><B>night. She has arthritis so she slept downstairs while i slept upstairs</B>
<BR><B>in my aunt Judy's old room from when she was a little girl. Because
i</B>
<BR><B>was so young, i cannot really remember every little detail. I just</B>
<BR><B>remember lying in bed starring at the ceiling because i couldn't
sleep</B>
<BR><B>and then all of a sudden lookin out towards the hallway and seeing
a</B>
<BR><B>figure of a man leaning on the stair case post. The figure was definetly</B>
<BR><B>looking towards me. It was a solid figure but looked a lot like
snow on</B>
<BR><B>the TV when the channel doesn't come in an it's all fuzzy. I have
never</B>
<BR><B>been so terrified in my life. A couple years later i told my friend</B>
<BR><B>about this story. He pointed out that perhaps he was lookin in at
me</B>
<BR><B>because he thought i was his daughter Judy. Me and my Aunt do look
a lot</B>
<BR><B>a like. Boy did that ever give me chills!</B>
<BR><B>My grandmother doesn't live there anymore. Sometimes i wish i could
go</B>
<BR><B>back and visit that house now that i'm matture and wiser. I've had
more</B>
<BR><B>sightings since that one of spirits or whatever ppl want to call
them.</B>
<BR><B>But that was my first.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hell Hounds</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: joepublic77@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I lived in a new track home in Mission Viejo, Ca with my folks and
two younger twin sisters back in 1981.&nbsp;&nbsp; My folks had decided
to go out for the evening and I was left to babysit my sisters.&nbsp; They
were only 4 years old at the time, and they shared a room.</B>
<BR><B>About 15 minutes after I had put them to bed, I heard them both
scream.&nbsp; I ran upstairs and they were both in absolute hysterics,
crying and just freaking out.&nbsp; After I had finally calmed them down,
I asked what what was the matter.&nbsp; They said they were both sitting
up and talking in thier beds when they looked down the hall and saw two
large dogs trun the corner at the end of the hallway where the bonus room
was.&nbsp; The dogs ran into thier room and dissapeared behind thier dresser
which was pushed up flush against the wall.&nbsp; They made me pull out
the dresser and look behind it (which I was not in a real hurry to do)
before they were convinced there were no "dogs" in their room.&nbsp; Although
this was a brand new home with no history behind it, there was always a
creepiness about the house that was centered around the staircase and the
bonus room which sat at the top of the stairs. The bonus room was always
cold, even in the dead of summer.</B><B></B>

breast cancer alot for a little girl to handle huh? well we moved to a
house close by my grandpa it was a 4 story house which the bathroom was
in the attic kinda scary for me! well about a week after getting settled
in my closet door would just open on its own no big i though until one
night i made sure i locked it! at oh around 1 in the morning it opened

<P><B>Ghost in Backyard</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: darkwolftear1@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>currently i am living at a house in Tucson Arizona .</B>
<BR><B>this house is quite comfortable i have lived here for</B>
<BR><B>a little&nbsp; over five years , not minding the presence</B>
<BR><B>of a class I of II specter located in my bedroom and</B>
<BR><B>backyard .</B>
<BR><B>my first experience with the specter at this house was</B>
<BR><B>about 4 years ago .</B>
<BR><B>it started in the middle of winter out&nbsp; among the path</B>
<BR><B>of brick in the back yard . that night i was busy on the</B>
<BR><B>computer located in the back room vary close to the</B>
<BR><B>backyard .living close to a bar i first assumed that</B>
<BR><B>it was the bar being quite noisy, once realizing it</B>
<BR><B>was a Monday night i honed in , and thats when i noticed it,</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;some kind of a strange</B>
<BR><B>tapping noise behind the brick wall that closed off my</B>
<BR><B>yard . not being that startled at first i didn't flee</B>
<BR><B>.only when it got closer and actually in the yard did i</B>
<BR><B>peer out into the back yard not witnessing any</B>
<BR><B>movement i looked for a silhouette . no silhouette i closed the</B>
<BR><B>blinds . closer still did the sound come&nbsp; still i did not</B>
<BR><B>budge. still closer , not moving i stayed reserved .</B>
<BR><B>at this point the sound was near to the window quickly</B>
<BR><B>i turned out the lights searching out some sort of</B>
<BR><B>shadow , then the taping was at my window .</B>
<BR><B>no shadow . i moved into the the kitchen which connects to the</B>
<BR><B>back room .turned on the lights there the tapping</B>
<BR><B>stopped . i sat down in the living room and it started again not</B>
<BR><B>outside anymore , but in my laundry room.</B>
<BR><B>the laundry room connects to the kitchen .</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;i got agitated and started yelling at the noise ,</B>
<BR><B>with each word i shouted the noise grew louder like</B>
<BR><B>the ground being hit by a baseball bat .</B>
<BR><B>i got quiet and sat in the center of the living room ,</B>
<BR><B>and slowly and softly i started chanting .</B>
<BR><B>the more i chanted the softer the taps got and it</B>
<BR><B>finally stopped . after that i went to bed .</B>
<BR><B>ever since then some Monday or Sunday nights</B>
<BR><B>the taping starts .</B><B></B>

<P><B>Brigham Young's house; Nauvoo IL</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: jlynes@jacklynes.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>A fairly large group of us, including my wife, several of our children,</B>
<BR><B>their friends, and a visitor we brought from England, went to Nauvoo
IL</B>
<BR><B>to visit the old Mormon sites.&nbsp; Among the houses we visitied
was Brigham</B>
<BR><B>Young's.&nbsp; We were greeted at the door by a very nice lady in
period</B>
<BR><B>clothes who welcomed us and began telling us about the house.&nbsp;
We looked</B>
<BR><B>around the parlor and viewed the many artifacts and period furniture</B>
<BR><B>pieces.&nbsp; We moved into the dining room and as we entered, we
could smell</B>
<BR><B>a full dinner. It was amazing.&nbsp; I took a large noticable deep
breath,</B>
<BR><B>savoring the smells of turkey, dressing, fresh bread, vegetables
and so</B>
<BR><B>forth. I thought someone in the "break room" was heating up their
left</B>
<BR><B>overs in a microwave. We could all smell it. The guide was very</B>
<BR><B>surprised, and asked "do you smell that?"&nbsp; We all agreed, yes
we could</B>
<BR><B>smell it.&nbsp; I said "it smells like someone has taken a break
and is</B>
<BR><B>heating up their lunch."&nbsp; She replied, "I am the only one in
here, the</B>
<BR><B>other guide has a group that has already moved outside. And there
is no</B>
<BR><B>break room in this building.&nbsp; There is no microwave."&nbsp;
I asked, "how'd</B>
<BR><B>ja do that?"&nbsp; She said, "I didn't do it."&nbsp; Others were
taking deep</B>
<BR><B>sniffs, enjoying the smells.&nbsp; After a moment, the guide continued
her</B>
<BR><B>narrative and told us about this large dining table, the many family</B>
<BR><B>dinners around it, and the planning of the great exodus west that
was</B>
<BR><B>laid out on this table in this room.&nbsp; The smell gradually dissipated
and</B>
<BR><B>she tried to continue her usual narrative, but she was visibly moved
and</B>
<BR><B>completey derailed from her normal script.&nbsp; We went out side
and sat in</B>
<BR><B>the spring house for a few minutes and talked about what had just</B>
<BR><B>happened.&nbsp; The guide was amazed and her amazement just showed
to me how</B>
<BR><B>remarkable the episode was.&nbsp; She said it was impossible that
anyone else</B>
<BR><B>in the house could have produced those smells.&nbsp; There was no
one else</B>
<BR><B>there. No one could have heated up a Thanksgiving styled dinner
and have</B>
<BR><B>only our group smell it for that short period.&nbsp; It was spiritually</B>
<BR><B>moving.</B><B></B>

<P><B>A Few Short Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My very first experience with a ghost was a few years ago.&nbsp;
I was ten (i'm now twelve) and i was sleeping over my friend Kelly's house.&nbsp;
I woke up in the middle of the night and looked over at her clock.&nbsp;
It was three AM.&nbsp; I layed there for a few minutes with my eyes closed
trying to get back to sleep but i suddenly felt that i had to open my eyes.
I looked up and there was a man standing over me.&nbsp; He was all green
and slightly blurry.&nbsp; He was looking at me, then he looked at kelly
who was asleep right next to me.&nbsp; I watched him walk over to the window,
pick something up and dissapear.&nbsp; I was told myself i was dreaming,
but now i know, i wasnt dreaming that night.</B>
<BR><B>My second experience was also at kelly's house.&nbsp; I woke up
again at three AM and i felt her pomeranian dog, Roxey, licking my foot.&nbsp;
I even felt her fur brush against me.&nbsp; I didnt look at her, i just
thought "Okay okay, i'm to tired to do anything about it anyway so i'll
just let you lick me..." and went back to sleep.&nbsp; Next morning i told
Kelly about Roxey and she said it wasnt possible becuase She locked Roxey
in the living room. We went out to check on her just incase, but the doors
were still closed and Roxey was still in there, and the only other person
she lived with was her dad and he was still asleep.&nbsp; Now every time
i sleep over her house i wake up at three AM, but nothing has happened
since then.&nbsp; At least not at her house.</B>
<BR><B>Now i am convinced that my own house is haunted.&nbsp; There have
been a lot of times when i look into the mirror in my room and there is
a boy standing behind me.&nbsp; He looks about 14 years old (two years
older than me) and he's tall and blonde.&nbsp; He's not smiling, but he's
not mad or anything.&nbsp; He looks kind of subtle.&nbsp; I turn around
and there is no body there.</B>
<BR><B>I have two dogs and aparently this ghost really likes them.&nbsp;
There have been numerous times when i am home alone, sitting in an empty
room and a tennis ball will come flying into the room with my dogs happily
chasing after it.&nbsp; Their toys are always moving around before my eyes
without anything touching them or any cause of them just moving, but they
do.&nbsp; And recently, when i tie my dogs onto a leash, i'll leave the
room and a few minutes later they will come walking out untied.&nbsp; That's
been happening a lot lately.</B>
<BR><B>And one time Kelly and i went into my room.&nbsp; I closed and locked
the door, as i always do, and we sat down on my bed.&nbsp; we were chatting
away, and kelly was in the middle of a sentence when she stopped dead and
watched the door.&nbsp; i turned to see what she was looking at and we
both watched the door slowly unlock and open by itself.&nbsp; There was
no one else upstairs that day, and there was no way that you could unlock
the door from the outside anyway, but it did and it opened.&nbsp; I knew
it was him but i'd never told kelly about him.&nbsp; We looked at each
other and just then kelly ran out of the room, i ran after her but she
refused to go back into my room the rest of the day.&nbsp; I dont feal
threatened by this boy, i dont feel afraid either.&nbsp; I feel like he's
just a part of my life now and i dont think he means any harm to us, or
me.&nbsp; He's scared a few of my friends though.</B>
<BR><B>Just a few weeks ago, i woke up at 8 AM.&nbsp; I layed in my bed
for a few minutes before i turned to look toward my sister's bed (we shared
a room).&nbsp; There was a man sitting next to her bed.&nbsp; He was all
grey, like he came right out of an old movie or something.&nbsp; He was
looking over at Leah (my sister) and he might have even been holding her
hand by the way it looked.&nbsp; He was about 35 i think, and i only saw
him for a few seconds before he looked at me, i blinked and he was gone.&nbsp;
It happened the next day too.&nbsp; I didnt have a very good feeling about
him, so later that day, i grabbed my rosary, stood facing the spot he'd
been sitting, and said "Leave my sister alone!&nbsp; Leave Leah alone!"&nbsp;
Then i said the Lords Prayer and i havent seen him since.&nbsp; I still
dont know if he was good or bad or even if he was a gaurdian angel but
i didnt have a good feeling about him and i hope i did the right thing.</B>
<BR><B>Then there is the lady in the bathroom.&nbsp; My downstairs bathroom
is where the washer and dryer are kept.&nbsp; Well when i was in the bathroom
one day i looked over toward them and there was a ladys face kind of hovering
in the corner.&nbsp; Just her face.&nbsp; It was very detailed.&nbsp; She
looked very old and she had white hair and was wrinkly.&nbsp; She was looking
directly at me then she dissapeared.&nbsp; I ran out of the bathroom.&nbsp;
She really scares me.&nbsp; Even though i've only seen her twice, i dont
like her very much.</B>
<BR><B>I'm the only one who has seen or experienced any kind of hauntings
in my family.&nbsp; Unless you count what happened to Josh my older Brother.&nbsp;
It's not very big, the only thing is that a few times in the bathroom he
has tried to turn on the water in the sink and instead the toilet flushes.&nbsp;
But i dont know if you'd call that a ghost or just really bad plumming.</B>
<BR><B>Thanks for listening!!!&nbsp; and sorry it's kind of long...&nbsp;
once again i swear to you all of this is true.&nbsp; and for you non-believers,
believe it, they're real.</B>

<BR><B>Sylvan Road, Atlanta, Georgia</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: b717doc@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to talk to other people that
may have lived here over the years, as I, as a resident from 1968 to 1972
or so, have done extensive research on the house after being terrorized
by night terrors in late 1998.&nbsp; We moved into 1450 in 1968, a family
of 6, my parents and 3 brothers. I remember, although I was only 8 years
old or so, the man telling my father " The house is haunted, just don't
open the north bathroom, it's boarded up, and should be left that way".&nbsp;
My stubborn dad then commenced to unboard the bathroom, which was fairly
small, and always freezing cold. He also converted the house from a duplex
to a single family house by tearing down the divider wall. My parents started
fighting alot. It started out small, but frequent, and escalated to violent
throwing of objects at each other.&nbsp; My dad worked 3rd shift for General
Motors here in Atlanta, so we were there alone at night, with our mother.
I shared the North back bedroom with my little brother, and heard a constant
hammering and sawwing activity from the full basement, just under our floor,
all night long. I often asked momma what the noise was, she could'nt explain.&nbsp;
Doors would open, footsteps were heard, to a point where we almost ignored
them. Apparitions or "people" were seen in the large hallway late at night
just staring at us, as we watched late night television on Fridays. My
aunt witnessed a large burly man looming over the back of the couch one
night, and asked my mother who he was, to wit, he de-materialized into
thin air.&nbsp; Then one night, my mother woke me up with a blood curdling
scream from her bedroom. I rushed into the living room where she was very
near a nervous breakdown. She ordered me back to bed, and told me that
"Momma just had a bad dream".&nbsp; Well, the next morning, She proceeded
to tell everyone at the breakfast table just what had happened, as she
was at the end of her rope with 1450. "She can have this goddamn house,
I'm not gonna fight her over it". My dad looked at her as if she had 3
eyes. "She tried to suffocate me, and when I woke up, she was right in
my face with no eyes, a long flowing night gown,and nearly killed me".
Needless to say we vacated 1450, and never went back.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Late 1998,&nbsp; I wake twice a week with night terrors about the lady
in 1450 taunting me from behind the living room curtains, just out of sight.
My wife tells me to get help. I go to the internet, and am told to "confront
my fears", in which I did. In 1999, fueled by anger, half from my dreams,
and half for my mothers near death experience, some 30 years ago, I pull
into the driveway of 1450, actually living my nightmares. Having no idea
what I'm gonna say to the residents, I open the porch door, look through
those curtains, and knock on the door. Thank god nobody home!&nbsp; This
extinguished my night mares.&nbsp;&nbsp; I then went downtown to the main
library, and up on the 3rd floor, found archives of Atlanta residents.
I found the listing of residents for 1450 since the house was built in
1927, and quickly jotted the feasible (possibly still living) names down,
went home and tried to match names in the current White Pages for Atlanta.
The 3rd phone call was a hit.&nbsp; He said he lived in 1450 back in 1961,
and told me that his neighbor, (remember, it was a duplex at the time)
an older lady, had came home one day, dressed herself into a long night
gown, went into the north bathroom and cut her own throat. I quickly reminded
him of her name after calling names off my list of residents I had got
from the library.&nbsp; I then verified through the Atlanta Journal obituaries
and the vital records office in Atlanta, that a Miss Jewell Swain of 1450
Sylvan road, had died at age 77, from self inflicted neck wounds on 21
July, 1961. I often drive by 1450 from time to time, just to keep my nightmares
at bay, and wonder if she is still there, or has passed onto the other
side. The house is always kept up, with a new roof, but never (I mean in
2 years now) see anybody at home.&nbsp; If it does become vacant, I may
go in with help, but I'm sure she's gone............I would however like
to talk to anyone who recognizes the address, and may have lived there
and experienced anything unusual, like we did.&nbsp;&nbsp; You never know
!!!!!!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Baby Seat</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jay@lewiscounty.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello agian, I wrote Shadowlands about some hauntings that have happened
to me through out my life and I have a new one. My son collects antique
coins and we frequent many antique stores. We found a new antique store
in a&nbsp; very old part of Tacoma WA. We were thrilled with the prices
and set up. It is in a old Victorian building that was never torn down,
only up graded, not much though. I was so impressed with the old trim and
glass door knobs that are still on the doors. I wandered away to look around
while my son looked at coins. I went into this rented space because the
color scheme was so warm and inviting. It had lovely doilies and old childrens
books and a very old baby seat, I guess it was a bouncer, it had little
ducks on it and red beads. I started reading a book that was a childrens
book from the early forties when I glanced up and saw a toddler sitting
in the bouncer. I looked around to see if a parent put a baby down and
nobody was around. I looked around again and the baby was gone. I got up
and told my son I would meet him out side. I must have looked terrible
becuase the lady behind the glass desk asked if I was OK. I asked her if
there was anybody in this store with toddler and she looked terrible all
of a sudden. She kept asking me why over and over and finally I told her
that I thought I saw a toddler in a baby bouncer and she said that I wasn't
the first person to tell her about the baby. I changed the subject and
we started talking about coins and other things when I heard a baby laugh.
I just kept ignoring it and I looked up at cashier and she was looking
toward the space where I saw a baby. My son and I left the building and
as we were walking into the parking lot, I looked up and saw a young woman
holding the baby in an upstairs apartment. I finally thought Ok, someone
lives here with a baby. I thought nothing more of it until the lady who
owns the store called our house because my son had asked if someone might
be willing to lower some prices on some old coins. We got to talking and
I asked her once again about the baby and she was silent and she said that
she hears the baby too, and sometimes catches a glimps of someone holding
a toddler. She said she thought she was going crazy and I told her, I knew
exactly what she meant! She told me a little history a bout the building
and the space that I was drawn to was her own and she found a majority
of the stuff in the attic when she was going through it after she puchased
the building. I asked her if she rents the apartments out and she said
that they were empty and the person I thought I saw, must have been a ghost,
with that note she said good-bye very quick.&nbsp; I chalked that one up
in my journal of sightings.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello, I would like to share my experiences and an interested if
anyone else may have had a similar one?</B>
<BR><B>I am currently 31 years old and have had many encounters with the
unknown through my life, but incidents that occurred with my great grandmother
leave me wondering why?</B>
<BR><B>My story starts as an infant, I was told much of this by my mother.&nbsp;
My great grandmother became very close to me when I was an infant and she
has passed away suddenly before I was one year old.&nbsp; For a remembrance
in the after life my mother placed a baby rattle in the casket that my
great grandmother had given to me.&nbsp; When this rattle was placed in
the casket I became violently ill.&nbsp; My grandmother put two and two
together, so to speak and removed the rattle.&nbsp; I immediately became
well.&nbsp; Then a few weeks after her burial my mother took me with her
to visit her final resting place.&nbsp; Once again I became violently ill,
needless to say I was only at her resting place two times as a child and
both times I became ill.&nbsp; The next time I went which was against family's
wishes, I was in my early 20's and once again I became ill.</B>
<BR><B>Then when I graduated High School my aunt gave me a gorgeous ruby
ring that belonged to my great grandmother and every time I wore it something
bad happened to me, for example, a car accident.&nbsp; I obviously do not
wear anything that belonged to my great grandmother anymore.&nbsp; So far
as the story goes it seems to me that she wanted me with her, but here
comes the twist and confusion.</B>
<BR><B>In 1998, I became pregnant and the embryo was lodged in my fallopian
tube (ectopic pregnancy).&nbsp; My fallopian tube ruptured causing massive
internal bleeding, requiring emergency surgery.&nbsp; I flat-lined on the
table, yes there is a white light at the end of the tunnel.&nbsp; What
I find most interesting, yet confusing it was my great grandmother that
would not let me pass over, she in a sense made me come back to this life.&nbsp;
I am still searching for the answers, my purpose.&nbsp; Up until that point
it seemed as if she wanted me with her, but when it came down to the time
I could have been with her, she turned me away.</B>
<BR><B>I would like to know if anyone else my have had a similar experience
or any ideas as to why she would not let me pass.</B>

<BR><B>The Vacuum</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: cowqueen14@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My mother tolld me this.&nbsp; She said this happened when I was
about one and my brother was about two</B>
<BR><B>One day my mother, grandmother, and my brother were in the office
room.&nbsp; My grandmother was vacuming while my brother played with my
mom.&nbsp; As my grandmother was vacuming the vacum suddenly turned off.&nbsp;
My grandmother turned around and told my mother to stop turning off the
vacum but my mother said that it wasnt her or my brother.&nbsp; Not really
beliving my mother my grandmother continued vacuming.&nbsp; The vacum turned
off two more times.&nbsp; My mother was leaving because she wanted to prove
to my grandmother that it wasnt her or my brother.&nbsp; As they were leaving
my brother tugged on my mothers hand and as she turned around she saw the
switch on the vacum turn from on to off all by itself.&nbsp; To the day
my grandmother died, I still dont think that she belived my mother.&nbsp;
As for my mother she just assumed it was my uncle or my grandma's husband.&nbsp;
They had both passed away.&nbsp; But after that my mother is always warry
when vacuming.</B>
<BR><B>You may not belive me or not but I swear on my soul that this event
truly did happen.</B>

<BR><B>The Swing</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:lemonlime64@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have heard thousands of ghost stories and experienced quite a few
myself.&nbsp; I am sure that anyone who has gone through a ghostly experience
can attest that one who has heard or seen the paranormal can never forget
it.&nbsp; A lot of things happened in my old house when I was a little
girl and no matter how hard I try, I can never forget them.&nbsp; The first
experience I can remember was when I was a small child sleeping in my bed
in the room across from my older brothers.&nbsp; I was laying wide awake
facing the wall that summer night and could not sleep for the life of me.&nbsp;
I rolled over to see a little man walking through our hallway.&nbsp; He
stopped looked at me, grinned, and turned and walked into my brother s
room.&nbsp; I just pulled my covers over my head and eventually fell asleep,
only to have nightmares of my brother turning blue and being eaten by thousands
and thousands of tiny bats.&nbsp; My brother is mentally challenged and
will always have the mentality of a seven year old, so I have never asked
him, and probably never will ask him about the incident for fear of scaring
him.&nbsp; Years later I was making a swing on the old tree next to the
house and I saw a dark figure dart behind the tree.&nbsp; I ran to my mother
and she said I was seeing things.&nbsp; Later, I attempted many times to
make my swing, but I would see the figure each time.&nbsp; Sometimes when
my neighbor, who is one year my junior, and I would climb the tree, we
would hear a knocking sound coming from the ground and into the branches
where we laid.&nbsp; At times, it sounded as if it was coming from inside
the tree, and at other times, it sounded like someone was just banging
it with their hands on the bark right beside us.&nbsp; Eventually, we moved
out of the old house and into a new one we built right beside it.&nbsp;
It took about three years to completely tear down the old house, and to
this day my parents will not tell me why we moved or why it took so long
to tear it down.&nbsp; Under the hard wood floors we found pages of newspaper
from the early 1940s.&nbsp; Most pages had stories about death or violent
crimes.&nbsp; My father told me that the newspaper was probably put down
as makeshift insulation between the old floor and the new.&nbsp; After
we removed all of the newspapers, my friend and I often saw a young woman
standing in the front window beaten and bloody.&nbsp; She always looked
scared and the smell of alcohol filled the air when she was in the window.&nbsp;
On a few occasions we saw her in the woods behind the house in a black
gown and smelling of sweet perfume.&nbsp; The ironic part of the story
is too long to tell, so I ll leave that part out.&nbsp; I saw a pale face
with the blue eyes just staring at me from the attic after the ceiling
was torn off.&nbsp; I have never seen anything to compare the color of
the eyes to.&nbsp; They were so bright and deep and saddened.&nbsp; I was
outside on the wall looking in through the kitchen window and I just couldn
t move.&nbsp; I couldn t think and I couldn t move; all I could do was
stare at it with tears running down my face as it stared at me.&nbsp; I
guarantee you that it was the worst feeling I have ever felt.&nbsp; My
eyes felt puffy and my face felt sticky from the tears.&nbsp; All of a
sudden it was gone and I ran inside with the most urgent feeling of escape.
My mother said she believed me and I had to sleep in her room for months
after that.&nbsp; That was the first time she acknowledged that the things
I saw weren t a figment of my imagination.&nbsp; In the new house I experienced
things as well.&nbsp; We frequently smell cigarette smoke when everyone
in the house is present in the same room - no one in my household smokes.&nbsp;
Important items will go missing and turn up in the floor in front of the
fridge weeks later or in front of my brother s bedroom door.&nbsp; When
we first moved into the new house, I chose the smaller room because the
larger one scared me, but my parents insisted that I take the larger because
I had too many things.&nbsp; The closet door would come open in the middle
of the night and a circular grease spot appeared on the wall next to the
closet.&nbsp; To this very day, I cannot sleep in any room if the closet
door is open.&nbsp; I traded rooms with my brother even though there is
a grave right outside his window.&nbsp; At first he claimed that&nbsp;
Casper&nbsp; was opening his closet door, but I had never told him anything
of the events, again, out of fear of scaring him.&nbsp; Soon after switching
rooms, though, the door stopped opening and "Casper wasn't in his closet
anymore."&nbsp; My radio will come on, the boys&nbsp; shower will turn
on and off, the fridge and freezer doors will open, and my father s television
will turn on and off and change channels by themselves.&nbsp; I have many
other stories, some mine, and some from my friends, but they will make
this story even lengthier.&nbsp; My grandpa is an indian chief, the kitchen
scares both me and my mother to the point where we have nightmares, my
cousins are Wiccans, my father had a premonition of his father's death
(this story has made my friends and I cry), and the foundation to the old
house is still there so I have many categories from which to choose a story
to tell... just email me if you really want to hear more.</B>

<BR><B>The Little Bum of St. Joe's</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: GOM@webtv.net</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>I live in New York City.&nbsp; Three times in over the past 30 years,
I've</B>
<BR><B>encountered what appears to be the spirit of a man who disappears
as</B>
<BR><B>quickly as he appears.</B>
<BR><B>The encounter is always in the same place, in Greenwich Village
on</B>
<BR><B>Greenwich Street between Christopher St. and West 10th Street.&nbsp;
The time</B>
<BR><B>is always between dusk and evening.</B>
<BR><B>The first encounter was in the late '60's or early '70's.&nbsp;
A friend and</B>
<BR><B>I were walking on Greenwich Street one evening when we saw, about
50</B>
<BR><B>feet or so ahead of us, a man who looked to be panhandling.&nbsp;
He appeared</B>
<BR><B>to be in his mid-fifties or so, "down at the heels,"&nbsp; somewhat
unkempt</B>
<BR><B>and with the shadow of a beard.&nbsp; He was short and had a swarthy</B>
<BR><B>complexion, dark hair and large dark circles under his eyes.&nbsp;
My friend</B>
<BR><B>and I agreed&nbsp; to try to avoid this guy and we veered sharply
to the curb</B>
<BR><B>as the panhandler made a beeline towards us with palm extended.&nbsp;
We were</B>
<BR><B>getting ready to brush him off when he got right next to us and
our</B>
<BR><B>initial aversion to this creature melted into such a loving feeling
for</B>
<BR><B>him.&nbsp; We both suddenly wanted to give this derelict every dollar
we had</B>
<BR><B>and yet he'd barely uttered a word.&nbsp; My friend bought out her
wallet and</B>
<BR><B>was about to give him the entire contents but he REFUSED to take
it!&nbsp; He</B>
<BR><B>did accept a few dollars from her.&nbsp; I seached my wallet and
purse but</B>
<BR><B>could only find about 60 cents although I knew that I'd had several</B>
<BR><B>dollars with me as we had been heading out for coffee and dessert.&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>bum took the 60 cents as I apologized for the paltry sum.&nbsp;
He shook his</B>
<BR><B>head sadly and said "ah, that really is too bad".&nbsp; We wanted
him to</B>
<BR><B>accompany us to the restaurant but he refused saying that he, "could
not</B>
<BR><B>stay".&nbsp; We turned away briefly wondering about this myterious
man.&nbsp; When</B>
<BR><B>we turned back to see where he may have gone, he had disappeared,</B>
<BR><B>nowhere to be seen.&nbsp; (I never did find that missing money).</B>
<BR><B>The second encounter I had with this little tramp was in the '80's
after</B>
<BR><B>shopping on Greenwich Street.&nbsp; He approached me at the same
spot, I</B>
<BR><B>again had the feeling of tremendous empathy for this man and again
the</B>
<BR><B>money that I'd thought I'd had on me was not to be found.&nbsp;
Again, I</B>
<BR><B>could offer him only a few pieces of change.&nbsp; He again looked
at me</B>
<BR><B>sadly and remarked, "that's really too bad."&nbsp; I turned quickly
to try to</B>
<BR><B>see where he was off to and again he was nowhere to be seen.</B>
<BR><B>My last encounter, so far, was in the mid '90's.&nbsp; This time,
knowing</B>
<BR><B>that I would be passing that same area, I took pains to hold a couple
of</B>
<BR><B>dollar bills in my hand, inside my pocket.&nbsp; I met him again,
and as I</B>
<BR><B>made to give him the money that I'd had in my hand, my hand came
up</B>
<BR><B>empty.&nbsp; This time I told him that I'd put aside money for him&nbsp;
but that</B>
<BR><B>I was sorry but I had lost it yet again. This time he just shook
his</B>
<BR><B>head sadly.&nbsp; I went to look in my wallet when he stopped me
and told me</B>
<BR><B>that it wasn't necessary.&nbsp; He walked away just out of my sight
when I</B>
<BR><B>turned around quickly to see that he had vanished for a third time.&nbsp;
A</B>
<BR><B>man who had been standing nearby said, "where did he go"?&nbsp;
Of course, I</B>
<BR><B>had no answer.</B>
<BR><B>During the span of these three encounters, over these past thirty
odd</B>
<BR><B>years, I have aged but he has not.&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel as though
I've encountered</B>
<BR><B>an angel and I've been found wanting.</B><B></B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: aaronpratt222@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello.&nbsp; My name is Aaron.&nbsp; I live in Placerville "Old Hangtown"
California.</B>
<BR><B>We are located about 10-15 miles above Coloma.&nbsp; Where gold
was discovered</B>
<BR><B>back in 1848.&nbsp; Well I have an interesting story that I would
like share with</B>
<BR><B>you.&nbsp; I was working for a restaurant located on Main St. Placerville.&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>restaurant was located within 100 yards of where the old hangman's
tree use</B>
<BR><B>to stand back in the late 1800's.</B>
<BR><B>I was working the night shift closing up.&nbsp; It was me, a server,
and a lone</B>
<BR><B>manager (who was in the back doing the books).&nbsp; During our
closing routine</B>
<BR><B>we have to turn off the juke box.&nbsp; I had to physically flip
a switch on the</B>
<BR><B>back of the machine.&nbsp; The server who was also closing saw that
I had turned</B>
<BR><B>off the juke box.&nbsp; We had just finished cleaning and closing
the store, so</B>
<BR><B>we decided to go into the back at tell the manager that we were
finished.</B>
<BR><B>While we were back talking to the manager, we heard the juke box
turn on and</B>
<BR><B>playing extremely loud.&nbsp; At the store we are not allowed to
turn the Juke</B>
<BR><B>box up over a level 3 on the dial.&nbsp; All three of us went out
to see what was</B>
<BR><B>going on.&nbsp; We saw that the Juke Box had been turned on and
the volume dial</B>
<BR><B>was turned up to 10.&nbsp; So our first thought was that someone
was in the store</B>
<BR><B>playing a joke on us.&nbsp; But all the doors were locked and there
was no one in</B>
<BR><B>there except us three.&nbsp; So we figured it was a ghost that was
doing this and</B>
<BR><B>we were all pretty excited to have a visitor in our store.</B>
<BR><B>The next day I was working a day shift and I had just gotten off
shift and</B>
<BR><B>decided to go out the emergency exit to the rear of the store.&nbsp;
I was parked</B>
<BR><B>closer to it and did not want to walk to far.&nbsp; After I went
out it, I</B>
<BR><B>slammed the door behind me and made sure that it was closed.&nbsp;
This door can</B>
<BR><B>only be opened from the inside and is a fairly secure door.&nbsp;
Well my manager</B>
<BR><B>told me that later that day, she was having a manager's meeting
at the table</B>
<BR><B>next to the emergency exit.&nbsp; During that meeting the door flew
open.&nbsp; My</B>
<BR><B>manager thought that I did not shut the door when I left and the
wind blew</B>
<BR><B>it open, however I was sure that I closed the door.&nbsp; After
this happened we</B>
<BR><B>have not had a single strange incident happen.</B>
<BR><B>I have no idea what or who was there, but I was glad to have the
experience.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I have since left that store and work somewhere else, so
I have no idea if</B>
<BR><B>the ghost has returned and is still playing jokes.</B>
<BR><B>Well I just wanted to share my story with you.</B>

<BR><B>Really Real</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi, Firstly I'd like to say this website rocks!!!!!&nbsp; Finally
a place where people can share their experiences.&nbsp; Congrats to the
shadowlands!!</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, a little while ago i sent in my experiences, well recently
a few more things have been happening.....</B>
<BR><B>If you read my other stories you'd know I live in a house that has
a few uninvited guests.&nbsp; I've learned to live with my ghosts and have
had many experiences with them (those are the ones i sent in).&nbsp; I
am also the only one in my family who knows about them.</B>
<BR><B>But just a few days ago my friend Kelly was at my house.&nbsp; She
knows about my ghosts because she was with me on a few of my encounters.&nbsp;
Anyway we were in my room and i turned my back to Kelly so i could get
something off of my dresser.&nbsp; All of a sudden my sisters little christmas
snowglobe came flying through the air towards me.&nbsp; Luckily it missed
me, hit the dresser and came toppling to the ground.&nbsp; I whirled around
and yelled at kelly "Why did you thow that at me?!?"&nbsp; and she said
"I didnt!!".&nbsp; "Well, who did?" I asked, she said "I dont know, it
just threw itself into the air at you."&nbsp; I looked at the snowglobe
that had been sitting on my sisters bedside table, on the other side of
the room, a few seconds before.&nbsp; And me and kelly ran out of the room.</B>
<BR><B>I have also discovered that my electric keyboard can play itself
if you catch my drift....&nbsp; Usually when i'm home alone.&nbsp; It'll
just start to play, even when it's turned off or not plugged in....</B>
<BR><B>and whenever i plug it in the wall will start smoking and we can
smell burning plastic.... that might just be bad wires or something wrong
with the plug.&nbsp; But even when it's not smoking i cant get it to work,
so now the only time it plays is by itself.</B>
<BR><B>Thanks for listening,&nbsp; i swear to you all of this is real.&nbsp;
Once again, congratulations on the website, it is a true success!!</B>

<BR><B>Hello, my experience was semi scary and it happened at the Neely
mansion in Auburn,WA. i hope you guys belive me. i have no medical problems
that can explain this.</B>
<BR><B>for my 14th birthday I asked my mom to drive me out to the neely
mansion so i could look at it. i had heard it had activity but was still
skeptical. as i approached the fence i felt cold, and slowly, nearly unnoticeably
at first i felt like someone was squeezing me around the ribcage.it got
worse so out of curiosity i walked away from the house to the road and
felt better. while this happened my mom was on her cell phone.i would have
told her while it was happening but you know..i slowly reapproached the
house and was resqueezed with a vengance. when my mom got off the phone
i started to walk back to the car.i asked her if she noticed anything strange
about my facial features or anything else. she noticed that i was "pacing"
and was expressionless and pale. when i told her what happened her first
reaction was are you hurt? my ribs were sore. then we talked and i learned
that when my mother was my age she had a household poltergiest who pestered
her,my uncle, and my grandma. i recently visited the apartment ,outside.(it
is now inhabited by the living)i got a strange vibe. a mix of positivity
and odd malicious intent.</B>

<BR><B>My Most Ghostly Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: daisiegurl71@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi, I'm at work, and not much to do so i thought i might share my
experiences.&nbsp; I love ghost stories, and ghosts intrigue me, but i
don't like seeing them.&nbsp; A lot of people out there think it's cool,
which i guess it is to some extent, but not so much for me.&nbsp; I have
been seeing ghosts since as far as i can remember.&nbsp; My earliest memories
are from when my parents were still together and we all lived in our downtown
attic apartment in New York City.&nbsp; It was a cute place, but i was
always scared at night.&nbsp; Up until i was six i would get up every night
because i'd feel like something was in my room.&nbsp; Usually i thought
it was my dolls staring at me, but i think i hadn't realized that it could
be something else.&nbsp; You see, being young and the only child, and feeling
scared and lonely in my room, i would sleep in my parent's bed to give
me comfort.&nbsp; But strange things would happen.&nbsp; There were a few
times that i would still be lying there awake, and my mom would poke me
and say, "look".&nbsp; There, in the dim glow that would seep in under
the bedroom door from the bathroom, we would see a ghostly shadow slowly
moving by in the hallway.&nbsp; Being young and naive i was awestruck.&nbsp;
I had no idea what it was - i was just glad i was with my parents.&nbsp;
As i got older, however, i became more aware of a real presence in the
old house.&nbsp; The floor boards would creak, i would hear footsteps belonging
to noone coming up and down stairs, rattling handles, and sometimes my
mother would act strangely, putting little trinkets in my room she said
would keep out anything "bad".&nbsp; Later she would tell me that she herself
would hear knocking on the wall beside her bed, the tv would go off, and
even a light bulb burst for no apparent reason.&nbsp; I didn't realize
that not until we moved to the basement apartment in the same building
that i would start my worst ghostly encounters.</B>
<BR><B>We moved to the basement apartment when i was ten.&nbsp; My dad
had left by then so it was only me and my mother.&nbsp; Within the first
year in the place, i had the feeling that something was watching me...hovering
over me....dwelling within my home..in my room.&nbsp; One morning i was
rudely awoken with the overwhelming feeling that someone unwelcome was
there watching me.&nbsp; I woke up with a start, my eyes wide open, the
hair on the back of my neck standing on end.&nbsp; I had a hard time breathing
but i was too scared to cry or even speak.&nbsp; My instincts told me to
look towards the wall.&nbsp; There, in the lamplight was a hunched figure
sitting on the end of my bed by my feet.&nbsp; I couldn't believe it...it
just sat there motionless, and though i couldn't see anything except it's
shadow, i could feel it's eyes on me, as if it were looking right through
me.&nbsp; I decided to get over my fear and maybe&nbsp; try some common
sense.&nbsp; Maybe there was something else in the room that was making
the eerie shadow?&nbsp; I would find out.&nbsp; Besides, there was alot
of junk in my room.&nbsp; So i started moving all the junk that could be
making the shadow.&nbsp; No difference.&nbsp; The shadow didn't move, and
i could still feel its stare.&nbsp; By then i knew it was real.&nbsp; I
moved the sheets that it was sitting on.&nbsp; They moved with ease, but
the shadow remained undisturbed.&nbsp; I was freaked!&nbsp; I was able
to mutter some words to the thing, "who are you and what are you doing
here..." No response it just sat there.&nbsp; With that, i couldn't take
it any longer.&nbsp; I ran to get my mom.&nbsp; "Get ready for school"
was what she said to my crazed babblings.&nbsp; "But there's something
on my bed!!!!" i wailed.&nbsp; I gave up. She wouldn't listen.&nbsp; I
went back into my room...with much caution.&nbsp; But the thing was gone.</B>
<BR><B>This was my first up close experience with this thing, but after
this, I saw it regularly.&nbsp; I would be totally minding my own business
concentrating on whatever i was doing, and i would see a dark shadow slowly
creep past from the corner of my eye.&nbsp; In a matter of seconds i would
go from happy and preoccupied to feeling scared and uncomfortable in my
own home.&nbsp; In my own room.&nbsp; I never felt alone and always felt
watched.</B>
<BR><B>When i was fifteen i moved out of the house to live with my aunt
in new jersey.&nbsp; I didnt' move because of the hauntings and the nightmares.&nbsp;
Well, not totally.&nbsp; My mother and i would fight constantly and i hated
my school.&nbsp; I wanted out.&nbsp; But that summer would bring more fear
than ever.&nbsp; It was the summer when i was invited to come stay with
my aunt and cousin at their summer home in the adirondacks.&nbsp; I was
thrilled!&nbsp; A real summer getaway, and since me and my cousin Jonathan
got along great, i was glad to have a&nbsp; companion.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
home was beautiful.&nbsp; Right by the water and very much like a country
cottage.&nbsp; I enjoyed my first week there without any problems...until
one night at exactly 3am i was awoken with that same terrifying jolt.&nbsp;
The familiarity was very disconcerting.&nbsp; The room was pitch black
and very very quiet.&nbsp; Too quiet.&nbsp; Something was in the room,
i feared.&nbsp; Suddenly i heard a loud CLANG right over my head.&nbsp;
Something had violently struck the metal bedlamp over my bed...the one
attached to the wall...right above my head....</B>
<BR><B>I whirled around and hurriedly turned the light on.&nbsp; Nothing
was in the room and all was still.&nbsp; I was so shaken up that i didn't
sleep for the rest of the night.&nbsp; "why why why me?"&nbsp; I thought,
scared to look forward to the last week of my stay.&nbsp; It had come at
3am.&nbsp; Waking up at exactly 3am feeling uncomfortable was not all that
strange to me.&nbsp; It had happened plenty of times...when i felt like
something was in the room, but this time, i knew it was something bigger
i was dealing with.&nbsp; Like the early morning visitor i'd had that time
in nyc...but worse...and i was right.</B>
<BR><B>That night i was brave, and i turned the lights off before going
to bed.&nbsp; Whatever it was was going to have to deal with getting ignored.&nbsp;
I wanted to make it seem like i didn't care, cause maybe...just maybe...it
wouldnt' bother me anymore if i didn't pay attention.&nbsp; 3am came around...and
i was still wide awake.&nbsp; Ok, i was a littel scared...well..alot scared...i
put my head under my pillow, and the sheet over myself in some deserate
attempt at feeling safe.&nbsp; Like that was going to help. But then i
felt it.&nbsp; Something was touching my pillow.&nbsp; I could hear it
brushing against it, as if it were lightly stroking it.&nbsp; What was
it doing?&nbsp; Was it going to suffocate me?&nbsp; Why was it touching
me?&nbsp; Please please please go away, i thought.&nbsp; It ceased it's
touching.&nbsp; Maybe it was gone...Maybe i was safe to go to sleep now.&nbsp;
But no.</B>
<BR><B>There, at the foot of my bed, by the window i saw a dim white light
appear through the "safety" of my bedsheet.&nbsp; It pulsed a little bit
and just hovered there.&nbsp; "what the..."&nbsp; I had never seen anything
like it before.&nbsp; It got bigger and bigger and brighter and brighter,
pulsating as it moved towards the corner of the room on my right about
ten feet away.&nbsp; Was it a light from outside?&nbsp; But from where?&nbsp;
How?&nbsp; It couldn't be headlights...no one drove around at this time
of night.&nbsp; And since when did headlights pulsate?&nbsp; Was it a UFO?&nbsp;
Haha, yeah right...we're trying to make us feel LESS scared, dummy.&nbsp;
It was indeed a strange and unexplainable sight.&nbsp; It moved alongside
the wall to the right of my bed.&nbsp; It was getting closer to me.&nbsp;
By now its light was filling the whole room.&nbsp; It was less than a foot
away.&nbsp; By this time my fear was out of control and i was nearly in
tears.&nbsp; I have to turn the light on, i said to myself.&nbsp; As quickly
as i could i ripped the sheet off of me.&nbsp; Flailing around, without
looking in the things direction, i found the light and turned it on.&nbsp;
I looked.&nbsp; It was gone.&nbsp; No light.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; I was
crazy with fear.&nbsp; I thought i was going to go insane if i didnt' get
some sleep.&nbsp; With that, i picked up my bedding and went up to my cousins
room.&nbsp; "I'm sleeping here tonight.&nbsp; There's something in my room."&nbsp;
He rubbed his eyes and groggily asked me to explain, which i did briefly,
trying to act nonchalant about it so as not to seem like a raving lunatic.&nbsp;
He thought about it, shrugged and told me it was ok.&nbsp; Just to go to
sleep.</B>
<BR><B>That next night i called my boyfriend, John, who i had been dating
for a year and a half by then.&nbsp; I explained in detail what happened.&nbsp;
I didn't know if he believed me or not, but he said that he would call
me at exactly 3am that morning just to be on the safe side.&nbsp; I was
in tears, so he could tell i was really shaken up.&nbsp; He called and
we talked for a couple hours. He made me feel safer, and nothign happened
that night.&nbsp; In fact, nothing else happened all that week.&nbsp; Of
course...i had the light on every night...and i always fell asleep when
the sun came up...but at least i had no more early morning visits!&nbsp;
I never want to go back there again.</B>
<BR><B>And so, those are my scariest experiences.&nbsp; There are a few
more, but those are the highlights.&nbsp; Just know i am constantly being
harassed by spirits like this, and always feel their presence and I know
when a house is haunted.&nbsp; I have heard that spirits are attached to
those with a certain aura about them...sort of like an invisible emotional
force field around us.&nbsp; Like a vibe.&nbsp; Some of us are more sensitive
than others whether we know it or not, and this makes us vulnerable to
ghostly experiences.&nbsp; I think all they want is some acknowledgement
of their presence.&nbsp; They are lost and in some cases lonely.&nbsp;
I feel for them, but still...i really dont' like getting harassed at early
morning hours.&nbsp; And i dont' like getting scared out of my wits.&nbsp;
So, if you get haunted by ghosts, i know how you feel.&nbsp; And it sucks.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Mobile Home Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: gewalt1@juno.com]</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I purchased a three year old repossessed mobile home.&nbsp; I wanted
it in a</B>
<BR><B>park close in to Houston Metro but there was no openings to be found.</B>
<BR><B>Upon threatening to cancel the contract the seller bought an old
mobile</B>
<BR><B>home and moved it out of a park and my home was moved into that
spot.</B>
<BR><B>A few days later while meeting my neighbors, a man said he thought
my</B>
<BR><B>trailer had been in this park before but had been pulled out&nbsp;
year ago.</B>
<BR><B>The reason for the pull out was that the owner had accidently killed</B>
<BR><B>himself in the trailer.&nbsp; He was doing some renovations and
his wife and</B>
<BR><B>daughter had taken a vacation to be out of the way.&nbsp; The man
was</B>
<BR><B>transforming the home from gas to all electric.&nbsp; He apparently</B>
<BR><B>electrocuted himself in the master bedroom closet where the electrical</B>
<BR><B>box was.&nbsp; Knowing that the family was on vacation, the neighbors
didn't</B>
<BR><B>think anything unusual about no activity on the house.&nbsp; It
was not until</B>
<BR><B>the wife came home that the body was discovered.&nbsp; It was about
two weeks.</B>
<BR><B>After a week in the house there was a stench coming from the master</B>
<BR><B>bedroom closet.&nbsp; The drywall and carpet were new and when I
pulled the</B>
<BR><B>carpet away from the wall, I could see that the flooring had been</B>
<BR><B>replaced with new wood.&nbsp; I wiped everything down and stench
went away.</B>
<BR><B>The smell would come and go and i eventually tore into the drywall
to</B>
<BR><B>check that the insulation had been replaced too and it had.&nbsp;
Each time I</B>
<BR><B>would check or do something to get rid of the odor it would go away
but</B>
<BR><B>come back in a week.</B>
<BR><B>One night in the first six months, I woke up with the feeling that
there</B>
<BR><B>was someone in my bedroom.&nbsp; The room was completely dark which
was</B>
<BR><B>unusual in that I always left the door open and light would filter
in</B>
<BR><B>from the other rooms.&nbsp; I felt something very close to my face
and was</B>
<BR><B>paralyzed with fear.&nbsp; Then I felt a pressure like two hands
on my</B>
<BR><B>shoulders and I was pushed down into the mattress.&nbsp; The hands
slowly slid</B>
<BR><B>down my entire body and I began to pray the Lord's Prayer.&nbsp;
The pressure</B>
<BR><B>stopped and the light filtered back into the room.&nbsp; I got up
and checked</B>
<BR><B>that the doors and windows were still secure and they were.</B>
<BR><B>I continued to fight the intermittent stench problem and another</B>
<BR><B>encounter occurred a few months later.&nbsp; I was again in bed
sleeping on my</B>
<BR><B>side with one of those body pillows in front of me.&nbsp; The pillow
began to</B>
<BR><B>be pulled off the bed.&nbsp; I thought maybe I was close to the
edge and it</B>
<BR><B>was falling off so I moved more to the center of the bed.&nbsp;
The pillow</B>
<BR><B>began moving again.&nbsp; I turned on the touch light ( I bought
it after the</B>
<BR><B>first experience) to see if my cats were perhaps playing with the
pillow</B>
<BR><B>and pulling on it.&nbsp; They weren't in the room and when I called
the came</B>
<BR><B>in through the cat door to the outside.</B>
<BR><B>Finally after about 15 months of chasing the disappearing stench
I just</B>
<BR><B>had had it and began yelling.&nbsp; "Damn you, get out of my closet.&nbsp;
It is my</B>
<BR><B>house now and you are dead.&nbsp; I don't want you around anymore,
go on and</B>
<BR><B>get out of here."</B>
<BR><B>It has been four years now and neither the odor nor the night visitor
has</B>
<BR><B>come back.</B>

<BR><B>Horribly Wrong</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: locachica1232000@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My ghost story regards the house we lived in for</B>
<BR><B>thirteen years. It was a duplex house in Connecticut</B>
<BR><B>that we rented from a friend of the family. I grew up</B>
<BR><B>in the house and when I was younger, I didn't notice</B>
<BR><B>anything I would consider out of the ordinary, but as</B>
<BR><B>I got older, I began to notice some strange things. It</B>
<BR><B>first started when I began to have a lot of trouble</B>
<BR><B>sleeping at night. I would wake up suddenly, thinking</B>
<BR><B>that someone had just stomped into my room, but when I</B>
<BR><B>looked around, no one was there. It would always</B>
<BR><B>happen at 2- 3 AM. The first time it happened, I tried</B>
<BR><B>to shrug it off, but it only got worse. I began to</B>
<BR><B>hear loud footsteps on the stairs at night, but the</B>
<BR><B>scariest thing to me had yet to happen. In my room, I</B>
<BR><B>had heavy sliding doors on my closet and one night,</B>
<BR><B>the doors began rattling very loudly and I heard more</B>
<BR><B>footsteps going out of my room. I told my parents</B>
<BR><B>about this and my mother had our church minister come</B>
<BR><B>and bless the house. For a while, things were calm.</B>
<BR><B>But the footsteps started up again and occasionally,</B>
<BR><B>I'd wake up during the night because my closet doors</B>
<BR><B>were rattling. One of the other scary things that</B>
<BR><B>happened was when my friend slept over one night. She</B>
<BR><B>was sleeping on the floor when she said that she woke</B>
<BR><B>up after hearing the closet doors rattle. She then</B>
<BR><B>turned over and said she saw a dark shadow pass over</B>
<BR><B>her and out of the room. Once again, the minister came</B>
<BR><B>and blessed the house and things were quiet for a long</B>
<BR><B>time. However, one more strange thing happened before</B>
<BR><B>we moved out. I don't know if this had anything to do</B>
<BR><B>with anything, but it was the day after my dad died in</B>
<BR><B>a car accident. I was walking down the hall upstairs</B>
<BR><B>to throw something away in the garbage can when I</B>
<BR><B>looked downstairs. During the summer, we usually keep</B>
<BR><B>the front door open and just leave the screen door</B>
<BR><B>closed to let in the sunshine. So naturally, it was</B>
<BR><B>very bright in the foyer. But when I looked down the</B>
<BR><B>stairs, there was a large black cloud, almost like a</B>
<BR><B>big puff of smoke at the bottom of the stairs. It</B>
<BR><B>started moving up the stairs towards me and I was so</B>
<BR><B>terrified of it, I just dropped to my knees and</B>
<BR><B>started praying aloud. When I looked back up a moment</B>
<BR><B>later, it was gone and I didn't feel that sense of</B>
<BR><B>dread and despair I felt when I first saw it. I never</B>
<BR><B>told my mom about it and we moved shortly after that.</B>
<BR><B>Most of the haunting seemed to occur mainly in my room</B>
<BR><B>and whenever I walked into my room, I always got this</B>
<BR><B>feeling of despair and fear. My friend who saw the</B>
<BR><B>shadow also said she picked up on this feeling as</B>
<BR><B>well. My mother would also sense this and sometimes,</B>
<BR><B>I'd even hear her rebuking the spirit at night. We</B>
<BR><B>didn't who or what it was that was in our house and to</B>
<BR><B>this day we don't. The friend we were renting it from</B>
<BR><B>had owned it for twenty five years and reported</B>
<BR><B>nothing strange or out of the ordniary. The house was</B>
<BR><B>built in the '50s and all of what I just described</B>
<BR><B>happened about five years ago. The only possible</B>
<BR><B>answer I have is that something must have gone</B>
<BR><B>horribly wrong in the house before our friend came</B>
<BR><B>into ownership of the property.</B>

<P><B>Families Tales</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: cliffhyde@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have a story that I'd like to share.&nbsp; It's a story my mother
related to me some years ago,so if you would like I'll pass it on.&nbsp;&nbsp;
My Mother was born in Sweetwater in upper East Tennessee and she told of
something that occurred when her Grandmother was a young Woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Her Grandmother lived in the country and this must have happened in the
early 1900s.&nbsp; Well, one day this bad storm was brewing up and the
he women and farm hands had to round up the horses and other animals and
secure things there&nbsp; against the storm.&nbsp;&nbsp; At one point Mini
( her Grandmother ) went into the kitchen,I think it was,to get something
they needed,maybe to light lamps with and she saw this Woman whom she thought
was her mother and when she went back to join the others she saw her mother
with them and she said something like '' mama, I thought you were just
in the kitchen '' but her mother said ''no'' that she had'nt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Another story she told me was of this tree,a Dogwood I believe, and one
day one of the children were misbehaving and their Aunt or Mother tried
to break a switch off to punish the child when this disembodied voice spoke
and said ''don't you take a limb from this tree ''and after that no one
trid to again</B>

where</B>
<BR><B>talking a walk with only a small flashlight (it had been pretty
close to a</B>

my little</B>

light</B>
<BR><B>back on and told my sister and friend what I saw. My friend said
that it was</B>

to the wired</B>

<P><B>Camp Happiness and Others</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Ih8evry128@netscape.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi. Ive been on this site before and read some stories. Well I have
a few of my own. actually i have 3.</B>
<BR><B>Ill start with my own experience,Camp Happiness.</B>
<BR><B>Well the boys were asleep and of course the girls were up watching
american idol. Well anyway a girl named Amy had to go to the bathroom and
she left the room and saw an african american man in the hallway dressed
in black with a Knife! So she flipped out and started crying. so all the
counslers got up and looked nothing so they checked the hallways One girl
named Arianna saw the man walking down the stairs so she flipped out but
said nothing so we didnt get scared. thats our story but the boys had a
similar experience. One boy saw the man walking around his cabin but did
nothing. but another boy saw the man cross the lake in a boat and go into
the woods. Thers no houses in the woods because we had to go in them alone
earlier. Scary?</B>
<BR><B>My next story is about my mom our nextdoor neighber for as long
as we can remember died. She was 98. My mother had a dream that she woke
up and looked out the window and saw her and she jumped bu then she looked
and our neighber blew her a kiss and then the two white ladies behind her
(were guessing her mother and her sister who she loved so much) left. Then
my mom woke up the next morning and our neighber had passed away. :-(</B>
<BR><B>My last story is about me when I was little (im 12 now) i had an
imaginary friend named Bubby. Sure right nothing creepy? Until I found
out thAt my grandma had a cousin they nicknamed Bubby. He also had red
hair like my friend. My grandmas bubby had died a long time before I was
born. Its not ghostly but my parents were creeped out. Now that I know&nbsp;
I am too.Thanks for reading.</B><B></B>

<P><B>A Ghosts Answer</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Ladydarkelfprinces@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>One night last week me and my sons decided to go ghost hunting, as
we all</B>
<BR><B>believe in ghosts, and feel like we're all just on the road to find
out the</B>
<BR><B>truth about how things (really) are in life.&nbsp; We went to a
cemetary here in</B>
<BR><B>Nevada which has people buried in it all the way back to the 18th
century.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway I took a pendulam with me to communicate with any ghosts
if they</B>
<BR><B>wanted to chat. First of all I asked if there were any ghosts present.&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>pendulam swung positive. (yes)&nbsp; So I said to the ghost, " I
want to know</B>
<BR><B>your name, does it begin with an A? "&nbsp; The pendulam swung negative,
(no), so</B>
<BR><B>I kept on naming off letters until the pendulam swung positive again.&nbsp;
Well</B>
<BR><B>the pendulam did finally swing positive as the ghost seemed to settled
for</B>
<BR><B>the letter ( J ). So with that answered, and still talking to the
ghost, I</B>
<BR><B>said " I don't know where your at can you give me a sign? "&nbsp;
The next thing</B>
<BR><B>that happened was we heard a big huge crash!&nbsp; We were like
WOW, WHAT THE</B>
<BR><B>FREAK?!!&nbsp; We looked over where the crash was and there was
a big tree branch</B>
<BR><B>that had broken clean off of a big huge tree.&nbsp; So we looked
at each other</B>
<BR><B>and voted that we had came this far so we were not going to turn
and run</B>
<BR><B>now.&nbsp; So we went and investigated, and found that the tree
was 100% healthy</B>
<BR><B>and that the branch that broke off was at least two feet in width
and was</B>
<BR><B>not rotten at all, and to top it all off there was no wind.&nbsp;
But the biggest</B>
<BR><B>discovery that we found was that right under that tree was a grave
stone</B>
<BR><B>with the name (Jhoanna Williams)&nbsp; engraved on it. Now we were
convinced that</B>
<BR><B>Miss Jhoanna the ghost had made contact with us and we were both
amazed and</B>
<BR><B>happy that we had contact without having to shake our britches before
we</B>
<BR><B>left.&nbsp; It was a little un-nerving I'll say on one hand but
interesting to</B>
<BR><B>know end on the other, so my advice to any ghost hunters is that
you stay</B>
<BR><B>calm as you can if your going to ghost hunt and don't back out once
you</B>
<BR><B>begin.&nbsp; Finish the job or don't start it at all cuz if you
do, your only</B>
<BR><B>going to miss out and most ghosts are not even harmful.&nbsp; Notice
that I said</B>
<BR><B>(most ghosts).&nbsp; There are some ghosts out there that were never
humans, and</B>
<BR><B>those are the ones that aren't nice, give or take a few old grouchy
ghosts</B>
<BR><B>that were once humans and were probably not so nice as humans either.
Ya</B>
<BR><B>know theres got to be some of those around.&nbsp; Like can you imagine
what kind</B>
<BR><B>of ghost Ted Bundy would be??&nbsp; Exactly!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi my names Rafi, I love the website. Okay, this isnt really a ghost
story, but its pretty funny nonetheless. I was reading youre haunted places
index and noticed that golden gate park was haunted by&nbsp; a ghost cop....Well
anyway, about a year ago, I was driving past golden gate park in SF with
my dad, and told him about the haunting. He laughed at me and said 'come
on you dont really belive in that stuff, do you?'&nbsp; the SECOND after
he finished that sentence, we heard a siren behind us. No it wasnt a ghost,
it was a real cop. We were so engrossed in our conversation, we drove right
through a red light.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; again, I love the website,
keep up the great work.</B>

<BR><B>The Man in Black</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Booboo13736@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>My Mom, brother, and I moved to Flagstaff, Arizona in 1998.&nbsp;
My Mom was managing a convience store there.&nbsp; In getting to know the
employees I formed a good friendship with one of the girls (We are still
friends to this day).&nbsp; She was telling me that the store was built
in the seventies and that there were some strange things that happened
in the store from time to time.</B>
<BR><B>The first thing I noticed on my own was that where the ice maker
was always had a strange, uneasy feeling, and it was always COLD.&nbsp;
I thought it was odd, but just played it off as the ice maker made the
room cold.&nbsp; Then my friend told me about The Man in Black, she said
that every once in a while she would catch a man in a black suit and black
hat out of the corner of her eye, though she could not make out any facial
features, but when she turned around to see he was gone.&nbsp; She said
that she never felt scared or uneasy by him, rather protected, like he
was making sure everything was alright.&nbsp; I thought she was a little
weird and didn't really think about it again, for I never seen anything.</B>
<BR><B>Living in Arizona there are a lot of Navajo Indians, and one we
called Charlie would always come in and swear that the store was built
on his land and that he sent evil spirts to "dwell" in the store.&nbsp;
We always sent him away, but he would come back and raise the same fuss.&nbsp;
The store had always been known for robberies and vandalism, so being from
Utah I just thought it was something that happened in Arizona (narrow minded,
but sadly, true).&nbsp; There was one time though, that my friend and I
were eating in the bakery after we were closed one night, just talking
when a jar of mayonaise rose up and crashed to the floor, needless to say
we left as quickly as possible, leaving a mess for them to find in the
morning.</B>
<BR><B>After that nothing happened and I moved to Utah for a couple of
years. Knowing my Mom needed the help I moved back and started to work
in the store again.&nbsp; It was not until I was pregnant that I believed
my friend when she told me about The Man in Black, years ago.</B>
<BR><B>The first time I saw him I was sitting in the office before we were
open (I was the only one in the store), doing the deposits for the day
before, when out of the corner of my eye I seen a Man in Black (not realizing
at that time that the doors were still locked).&nbsp; I turned to acknowledge
him but he was gone, shocked, on edge, but not scared I remembered what
my friend had said.&nbsp; She wasn't crazy, and from then on I would see
him at all diffrent times of the day, and I will never forget the feeling
of saftey when he was there.</B>
<BR><B>I told my fiance' and a few other people that worked in the store
about him, and I think that I shouldn't have.&nbsp; I feel that he did
not want his presence to be known to everyone, so he left (and I will never
forgive myself).&nbsp; After that the store would constantly be robbed,
and vandalised.&nbsp; And the cold place in the ice maker room started
to extend to the whole store.&nbsp; I know it was The Man in Black who
had kept the evil spirits away, for after he was gone til' the day the
store was tore down to make way for a new one, bad things constantly happened.</B>
<BR><B>Sometimes I think back on those days and remember "the life" that
store had and the unique experiences that came in running it the last five
years it stood.&nbsp; I know no matter what happens in my life that I,
and everyone else that was on the pay-roll durings those years will never
expericence another place quite like it.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Sad Brother</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Cathy@wholesalephoto.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>The home that I grew up in was previously owned by friends of the
family. My grandmother bought it when my mother was 16 and kept in touch
with the family who lived in it before. It was known by everyone that they
had twin sons, one of which died in the nursery as an infant.</B>
<BR><B>Years later, when I was about 6 months and my brother was about
2 we were sleeping in the nursery when my mother, grandmother, father and
sisters heard a baby crying. My mother went to check on us but as she neared
the bedroom, the crying stopped and she saw that both my brother and I
were sound asleep.</B>
<BR><B>This continued on for most of the night, much to everyone's fear
and dismay.</B>
<BR><B>The next day, or a couple of days later, my grandmother got a call
from a friend to say that the other son had died in a car accident that
night. We all knew then who was crying in the nursery, and we haven't heard
anything since.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Laguna Beach</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ShireLilly@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; I have gone looking for places that could be haunted, talking
to people... just searching.&nbsp; I don't know what compelled me to go
to this place, but one night I had an idea.&nbsp; It was about 2:00 am
when me and 3 other friends decided to go out looking for something to
do.&nbsp; We went to an elementary school called The Top of the World in
Laguna Beach, California.&nbsp; It is at the top of a high hill on right
on the cliff side.&nbsp; Of course, being me, I brought a digital camera.&nbsp;
We were wondering around and 2 of my friends noticed a children's garden,
they climbed over the fence while me and another friend stayed behind.&nbsp;
We were along the outside of the fence where the cliff drops down.&nbsp;
There is about 4 feet of walking space.&nbsp; So I decided to take some
pictures.&nbsp; There was a very good climbing tree growing off the cliff.&nbsp;
I snapped about 5 pictures on it, then took some of the swing set and things.&nbsp;
My friends shortly came back over the fence with a hand full of this one
certain flower.&nbsp; Which I thought was a bit uncalled for to take them,
but I didn't think anything else of it.&nbsp; We got in the car, and were
sitting for a few minutes while I checked out the pictures I took.&nbsp;
They were all normal, but one.&nbsp; One of the pictures it took of the
tree had, what clearly appeared to be two people hanging from one of the
branches, it didn't look like they were play hanging, it looked like they
were hanging by their necks.&nbsp; They came out as bright orange and reddish.
But you could clearly see that they were bodies, feet, head, arms, everything.&nbsp;
Just then, the drivers side car, slammed shut ... we took off, scared out
of our minds ... we were almost home, when I finally said something about
the flowers, I said that we need to take them back, NOW.&nbsp; I thought
that we might have made something mad.&nbsp; So we drove back, the two
that took them, went back to the garden and putt them back.&nbsp; We went
home, and stayed awake until the next day.&nbsp; I have never heard any
stories of this place being haunted, I had no idea that it was. If you
know anything ... tell me.&nbsp; That is it.&nbsp; This wasn't the scariest
I have seen though ... when I was a child, I was haunted while living in
a house in Ventura, CA. No one else, was haunted but me ... it went on
for a year or so. Almost every night ... but thats a long and other story.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Guardian Angel</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jdutton@danserv.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is my story of my families Guardian Angel.&nbsp; On April 21st
1991 my granddad past away while sitting in his favorite chair at home
from a massive heart attack.&nbsp; The heart attack was very sudden and
unexpected as most are.&nbsp; He seemed to know that something was going
to happen to him soon because he asked to see the people that he loved
most during the week before and even the day of the accident.&nbsp; Everyone
visited him except for me, his favorite grand daughter.&nbsp; I was preparing
for a horse show and going to school so I didn't have too much free time,which
he understood.</B>
<BR><B>When he died I felt that I had been cheated by not seeing him before
he left.&nbsp; I didn't even get to say goodbye at the funeral.&nbsp; Well
as the months went on and I got out of school I began to spend a few days
a week with my grandma at her home.&nbsp; We were trying hard to keep her
occupied since her husband and family was her life.</B>
<BR><B>While staying with her one day I was visited by my granddad.&nbsp;
I was the only one in the house at the time so it could not have been someone
messing around with me.&nbsp; We kept the chair that he passed away in
simple because he loved that chair.&nbsp; When anyone sat in the chair
it would make an unmistakable sound.&nbsp; Anyways, while alone in the
house I heard that unmistakable sound and looked in the direction of the
chair.&nbsp; Sitting like he always did was my granddad right in front
of me and in living color, like he never left.&nbsp; He never did say a
word, he just smiled and gave me a quick wave.&nbsp; I smiled back to him
and went about my business.&nbsp; When it finally hit me at what I just
saw I looked again and he was gone.&nbsp; To this day I know what I saw
was him saying goodbye to me since we didn't have the chance while he was
alive.</B>
<BR><B>I know that he still is with us in his own way watching over eveyone
he loved.&nbsp; A few months ago both my mother and I were involved in
a serious horse accident.&nbsp; While riding a young horse my mom was bucked
off and sustained a broken arm and a gash above her eye.&nbsp; I responed
to&nbsp; help with the horse, while being 5 1/2 months pregnant with my
first, when the horse kicked me square in the chest.&nbsp; I know that
my granddad was there with us that day to help.&nbsp; Though he couldn't
stop what was going to happen he helped none the less.&nbsp; My mother
could have been kicked in the head, killing&nbsp; her and I could have
lost the baby and also been kicked in the head.&nbsp; There are other instances
when I know that he is watching over us but that has been the most recent
incident. That is my story of my Guardian Angel.&nbsp; I hope that you
have enjoyed reading.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ghost Encounters</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: fairygrl002@netscape.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Hi</B>
<BR><B>I have alot of encountars that have happened to me and my family.
When I was little about 3 or so.. I asked my mom if we could play in her
bedroom and she asked me why&nbsp; and I said "I wanted to play with the
people", by this time I imagine she was scared but she asked what people?
I&nbsp; go "there, there and there" I pointed to 3 different spots. I do
not remember this but she does I just heard that one 2 years ago.</B>
<BR><B>When my mom was little she thought she saw an angel go into parents
closet. ( I do not think it was an angel but she insists it was)</B>
<BR><B>Last year my and some of my family went to Galena, Illinois and
we went to the museum. I was on second floor by the stair case when I felt
a cold breeze go past me. It scared me half to death because I knew that
the air conditioning would not be on in the middle of winter. I went by
my grandma and said " I just felt a cold breeze" and all she says "oh...
this place is haunted" and I was dumbfounded and say " and you decide to
tell me this NOW"</B>
<BR><B>I told my mom what happened and I told her I was shaking and I thought
i felt clamy and she felt my hand and says " you feel like a dead person
would clamy and cold" I did not like the way she told me this.</B>
<BR><B>When I was in 5th grade we moved into the house I am living in now(
I'm in 10th grade now) a couple of months after we moved in my cousin was
over at my house and we were under my bed talking because... I dont know
why 0_o&nbsp; and all of a sudden we heard this loud noise like metal banging
against metal we looked all around my room and the only thing I could see
wrong was my antique dresser handle was shoved into the latch thing where
it was hooked on and it was not like that before and we coudlnt get it
out and then we tried it with another handle but we couldnt get it to go
into the thing like that.</B>
<BR><B>well thats all of them I feel like talking about.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Experiences thus Far</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jandsmeek@foothills.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Hello. I am a 24 year old female living in the eastern part of Kentucky
in a little town called Louisa. It's about 30 mins from Ashland and Paintsville.
Growing up in my mother's house wasn't&nbsp; what I would call a normal
childhood. We never talked to my mom about the goings on of the house till
I turned 18. We would make jokes up until then, but when I did turn 18
we started discussing it seriously.</B>
<BR><B>My mother told me when they bought the house in the early 70's that
it was a new developement, only three other houses were built in this subdivision
to be. They had bought the fourth. It consisted of people whose children
were already grown or young couples like themselves. A couple months after
moving in my mother started hearing children playing outside, there were
no children in the neighborhood. She also told me one night she was expecting
my dad to come home from work and she was reading in bed, she heard the
door open and shut and the cabinet doors being gone through, so she got
up and no one was there.</B>
<BR><B>My dad died in 1982, I was two and my brother was 6 monthes old.
I have blocked from then till I was 5 out. I have no memory up until my
first day of kindergarten. My earliest memorable experiences with whatever
is in my mothers house has to do with the former garage, when they bought
the house they turned it into a family room, my brother and I would never
go down there at night, we called it the ghost's conference room. You could
just walk by that room and here a big group of people talking. This came
out in the open when I was 18, mom also has heard the same thing.</B>
<BR><B>I also remember feeling a presense in my bedroom, my room seemed
to be a favorite, I slept with my covers over my head and the lights on
for a very long time. The hair on the back of my neck and arms would stand
on end, and I would just feel very uneasy and fearful. I would hear footsteps
walk around my bed and then out my door. And then I would feel at ease,
but it happened numerous times a night. I would even try telling it to
leave my room, to let it know I knew it was there, that it wasn't welcome
in my room and not to speak or show itself to me, I made sure I blocked
myself from that. I never actually saw anything in the house till I got
in high school.</B>
<BR><B>I had just got out of bed and normally slept with my bedroom door
closed, but it was open for some reason, when I turned to look out into
the hallway, I saw a young girl, about my age probably at the time,her
hair was a golden blonde and long with a ribbon tied like a headband and
she had on a long pink old fashioned night gown and she was carrying a
lantern. I should go ahead and mention that nothing worked in my room,
the tv would turn on and off by itself... when it would work at all, I
went through three new tvs, the picture tube blew out of two of them. My
radios would change channels I went through 3 stereos with that room.</B>
<BR><B>After I graduated I bought my grandmother a dog, well it ended up
staying with me. She would growl and didnt like sleeping in my bedroom
at night. When I made her come in there she would chew on her nails and
hide under my daybed. One night I was laying in there and I kept hearing
this knocking under my bed, it would knock 3 or 4 times and then I would
tell my dog to shut up and it would quit for a minute. This happened at
least four times before I looked under there to grab the dog out and discovered
that my dog wasn't even in the room with me, I went into the living room
and there was my dog on the couch asleep. I quit sleeping in that room
after that. I slept in the living room from then on, which wasnt any better,
I heard footsteps all hours in the kitchen.</B>
<BR><B>Another thing that has been experienced in this house is what we
have called ghost pets. My mother and I could set at the kitchen table
and feel something brush up against our ankles like it walked right by
each of us.</B>
<BR><B>I got married at 21 and moved out. I moved back in at 22 when I
had my child. I had a dream that my father came and seen my son shortly
after we came home. We moved into my old room. I would awaken to mens conversations
going on above my head at times. My son was very bad to kick off anything
you tried to lay over him and I got to where I wouldn't cover him back
up during the day. One day I went in to check on him and he had kicked
his cover off, I left him be, my mom goes in and checks on him, he's covered
back up. My tv started acting up in the room again after we moved back
in. I would turn it off and then my mom would come in yelling about me
leaving the t.v. on, so she would turn it off, few minutes later, it was
back on.</B>
<BR><B>Well there is more experiences with the house and surrounding area,
but I have wrote plenty. Thank you.</B>
