<b>Priest on the Stairs</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: neptune@bbc.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>This incident occurred about 20 years ago in Mishawaka, In. when
I was</b>
<br><b>only 9.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Our house was built in 1904 so it had the huge solid oak doors and</b>
<br><b>trim.&nbsp; The living room was very long with ceilings which are
12ft.</b>
<br><b>high.&nbsp; I hope you got the idea of the architecture of this
house.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>basement was a full one divided into two rooms and this is where
most of</b>
<br><b>the "presence" seemed to be.&nbsp; I will get to that later.&nbsp;
Back to the</b>
<br><b>house though,&nbsp; the master bedroom was downstairs with its entrance
being</b>
<br><b>oak sliding doors.&nbsp; All of the fixtures were of the early 1900's
also,</b>
<br><b>so the living lights were hanging chandeliers one at each end of
the</b>
<br><b>living room.&nbsp; The upstairs had 3 bedrooms with a landing at
the top with</b>
<br><b>a bannister guarding the stairs.&nbsp; The stairs were enclosed
and curved</b>
<br><b>and this will be important in a minute.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The house upstairs wasn't insulated well so in the winter it was
cold</b>
<br><b>and in the summer hot.&nbsp; As a consequence my two brothers and
I slept on</b>
<br><b>the pullout couch downstairs.&nbsp; One night my younger brother
and I went</b>
<br><b>upstairs to get ready for bed and as we were going down the stairs
I</b>
<br><b>looked back up due to the feeling something was there, and I saw
an</b>
<br><b>apparition&nbsp; coming towards us.&nbsp; I screamed and told my
brother to look</b>
<br><b>up, he did and saw the same so we flew down the rest of the stairs
and</b>
<br><b>yelled at our parents to go look for the man.&nbsp; They did and
of course</b>
<br><b>nothing was there.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Now let me describe the ghost, he was not opaque he was complete
in his</b>
<br><b>form, and he was dressed in a Catholic priests clothes.&nbsp; I
noticed this</b>
<br><b>because we were not catholic, but my friend next door was and I
visited</b>
<br><b>her church just down the road.&nbsp; I thought this very peculiar,
but what I</b>
<br><b>thought even more peculiar was the fact he was holding a gun pointed,</b>
<br><b>what I thought was at us.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Of course my parents told us we were young and had very vivid</b>
<br><b>imaginations and it was nothing.&nbsp; Years later however, my mother</b>
<br><b>confessed she new the house was haunted also because when she was
the</b>
<br><b>only one home she would hear something walking upstairs and on the</b>
<br><b>stairs.&nbsp; We always had German Shepherds and our dog would growl
at the</b>
<br><b>ceiling and would never go in the basement.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Now on to the basement.&nbsp; I knew there was a presence here in
the back</b>
<br><b>room where the water heater was because it was much colder and felt</b>
<br><b>"wrong."&nbsp; It felt evil and bad and didn't want anyone there
because you</b>
<br><b>felt you just had to leave immediately.&nbsp; I want to say that
the upstairs</b>
<br><b>didn't have this feeling to it even though this is where we saw
the man.</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I am not sure the history of this house and soon after this incident
we</b>
<br><b>moved to Florida.&nbsp; on my dads company transfer.&nbsp; I just
want&nbsp; to give my</b>
<br><b>opinion on this after researching different types of haunting.&nbsp;
I feel</b>
<br><b>this was a replay of some kind and I was a witness to it.&nbsp;
I do feel</b>
<br><b>there might of been more than one presence, because the evil in
the</b>
<br><b>basement was different that the other and the one in the basement
didn't</b>
<br><b>want anyone there.&nbsp; He did other things too to give us&nbsp;
this feeling.</b>
<br><b>Mostly the noises were harmless and no bother to us, but it was
the</b>
<br><b>basement that we avoided for whatever reason.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I would love to hear what you all think of this and the type of haunting</b>
<br><b>you feel it is.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Corbin Hollow Trail near Hood VA -&nbsp; Shenandoah Natl Park</b>
<br><b>In the spring and winter in 1995 I repeatedly hiked the Corbin Hollow
and Weakley Hollow Trails with my dog. I chose to do so alone though to
this day I do not know why.I am not particularly brave and this area is
very remote on weekdays. At first it was a feeling of dread in certain
places. I wandered off the trail occasionally to search old homesites&nbsp;
prior to the park. Most of these were 1880 - 1920's. The most recent ruins
being 1930 when the Shenandoah park was created by condemnation of private
lands held for generations by owners from out of state and mountain squatters.
There are many ferocious tales of fighting and death among the mountaineers
in the area.</b>
<br><b>One day as I decided to ascend a remote trail off of the Nicholson
Hollow Trail towards Skyline Drive I was overcome completely by the dread
feeling. It was in the Spring just as everything is greening up and not
a dreary time in the woods. As I stepped over a log in the trail I was
instantly overcome with an intense thought of SNAKES. And as I went a few
more feet I realized that I had had an impression of snakes since I had
left my car. In fact being alone with my dog and hiking 20 miles at a time
I usually just relaxed and enjoyed being away from it all. I immedicately
turned around and ran back down the trail with dog following behind. I
was terrified. As I got to the log in the trail and proceeded to step at
a run over the log there I saw a huge green snake. I never looked back
or returned. I ran stumbling like a fool for about 1 1/2 miles. There are
dozens of homesites and cemetaried in the area. I feel that I had a psychic
impression that confirmed the dread I had felt on earlier occasions.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Emory University Ballroom</b><b></b>

<p><b>Georgia, Atlanta, Emory University Ballroom, Cox Hall.</b>
<br><b>When I was a student one of my good friends was the guy who ran
the catering service for the university, i rented a room from him.&nbsp;
He told me about a spirit that many empolyes have seen.&nbsp; This is what
he told me:&nbsp; BAsicly he was working late one night cleaning up and
had sent everyone home and was finishing up when he saw a large, about
6'5" and over 275 pnds black man in his early thirties, bald, wearing dirty
overalls and a simple cotton shirt.&nbsp; He nodded at my freind and then
walked down the halway.&nbsp; My freind thought this was odd and went to
go ask him if he could help him as the location also has the cmputer lab
which has been vandalized or attempted theft befor.&nbsp; He walked around
the corner (in a hallway with only locked doors) and hit a dead end were
there were no possible exits.&nbsp; The man could not have gone in any
door beacuse they were all locked and my freind had not heard any doors
open and the man had only been out of site for a minute.&nbsp; Plus all
thedoors lead into offices which only lead back to the hallway.&nbsp; Anyway
he mentioned it the next day to one of the workers and she said to the
effect : oh thats just george the ghost.&nbsp; Geroge wasn't the name she
used, i can't remember, but the gist of</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;it swas many people had seen him, always dressed the same
way and always freindly but not talking.&nbsp; No one knows why, the buidling
is realtivly new (no more than 10 years old), but the university is sitting

<br><b>Frustrated Frights</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: momtime111@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi Dave.My name is maryann and Im from jersey too. Since I was a
child I have</b>
<br><b>always been bothered by ghosts. But my parents never belived me.
It was not</b>
<br><b>until I was an adult that my parents agreed that somethin was not
right about</b>
<br><b>the house I grew up in. They say they didnt want to scare me. People
should</b>
<br><b>not tell children that "its only their imagination" they should
teach their</b>
<br><b>children not to be afraid otherwise children feel either they are
now totally</b>
<br><b>vulnerable to the ghost because n o one believes them, thus intensifying
the</b>
<br><b>fear, or they think if this is my imagination then I am a nut case.To
this</b>
<br><b>day I still hear sounds and see thing from the corner of my eye.
When this</b>
<br><b>happens to my children (very, very rarely) I just tell them maybe
its</b>
<br><b>granmdas dog visiting&nbsp; or something that wouldnt scare them.
If I can get</b>
<br><b>away with blaming on the wind, I do,but I will not let them think
they are</b>
<br><b>crazy!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, here is one of my stories. When I was a teenager
I had my own</b>
<br><b>phone number in my room. One day I was having an argument with my
boyfriend</b>
<br><b>(this boyfriend was not good for me). The phone in my parents rang
so I told</b>
<br><b>him to hold on while I answer it. When I did, no one would answer
so i hung</b>
<br><b>up. Back to my argument. A few minutes later the phone rang again
, no one</b>
<br><b>would speak so I took my anger out on the dead air and hung up.
As soon as I</b>
<br><b>got back in my room the phone rang again so I didn't answer it.
After about</b>
<br><b>thirty rings I couldn't take it anymore. When I got to the door
of my parents</b>
<br><b>room ,with my own eyes I saw the receiver jump off of the phone
and swing</b>
<br><b>back and forth by itself. Needless to say I ran out of the house
until my</b>
<br><b>nonbelieving parents came home and told me a truck must have passed
by (on</b>
<br><b>our quiet street) and the vibration must have knocked it off the
hook.But</b>
<br><b>what caused the cord to swing back and forth as if someone was holding
it</b>
<br><b>from the middle and swinging it???</b>
<br><b>Whats your opinion?</b><b></b>

<p><b>My grandmother's house is pretty old, when you walk in the stairs

<br><b>the living room alone I'd stay until someone came looking. When
my dad first married my mom they had to stay there for a while, my dad

he felt like he was being followed and ran the rest of the way. My mom
said when she was a kid and they first moved in an elderly man came to
the house asking for a woman that my mom never knew, she said no you have
the wrong house and he left, she went to the living room and looked out
the window a few minutes after he left and he was gone, the way the house

<br><b>Believe it or Not</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kevsavuk@btinternet.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I am a happily married, family man, with a good sense of humour.
My friends, and perhaps</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;even people who know me,who are indifferent to me, would say,
that at least,&nbsp; I have integrity and am honest.</b>
<br><b>The incident in question happened in Winter 1983. I was 26, a craftsman
gardener working in the north of</b>
<br><b>England.&nbsp; Mid-week in mid winter was just awful. Frozen snow
all around, coupled up to a chill factor that made the Algarve top of my
fantasy list...</b>
<br><b>Having to trim a Godforsaken hawthorn hedge in the middle of no-where
was the order from my boss's office, ( his cosy,warm, inviting office.)&nbsp;
It literally was in the middle of no-where, out on the moors.&nbsp; No
logic at all applied to this fool's errand, but, keen for further promotion,
I took one of my men, and out into the frozen north we went.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After an hour, we were dead on our feet, ( not that we could feel them
of course...)&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned to my equally frozen colleague, smashing
lad, Garry , His father was as tough as they came, a bare knuckle fighter
( highly illegal ) who owned his own gym locally. Garry was totally different,
so much so, I often thought he must have been switched at birth, polite,
well spoken, never said a bad word about anyone.</b>
<br><b>I asked Garry the time, "2pm" came the reply. To this, I remember
distinctly saying what the hell were we doing there, that it was madness,
that I wished to God that I was at home, in the warm... Having vented my
spleen, I got on with the job, and was delighted to finish by 3pm, just
as hypothermia was setting in.&nbsp;&nbsp; By 4.30pm I had parked up my
motorcycle and walked into my home, to be greeted by my wife, Beverley.&nbsp;
( just incidentally, Bev was the double of the lovely Carolyn Jones who
starred as Morticia in the original Adams Family.)&nbsp; Bev, level headed,
very intelligent, who did not suffer fools gladly, looked at me quizzically...
Did I come home at all today ?&nbsp;&nbsp; If Bev said she had spent the
night with&nbsp; Leonardo Di Caprio and just played cards, I would tend
to doubt her. On the other hand, normally, Bev is honesty personified.&nbsp;
She was making the beds, when she heard the front door open and close.
She called down, and saw me walk up the stairs towards her. Bev said that
two things struck her as strange, one, she didn't hear my motorcycle arrive,
as she normally would, and two, it was an odd time for me to be home.&nbsp;
I apparently walked into the bedroom, disturbing the bamboo curtain, faced
her briefly,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;smiled, turned and walked into the bathroom...&nbsp; and never
came out... Not easily frightened my Bev, more astonished, then curious.
My appearance was at 2pm, exactly the time I wished I was home !&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have no recollection of going home, in body, I certainly didn't. Bev
said I was solid, real, I moved the curtains and didn't alarm her in any
way.&nbsp; Some clever psychologist out there will have a neat, pre-packaged
answer for it,&nbsp; fine.</b>

<p><b>By: Catsshadow@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I first would like to say that I love you site! I have almost all
your</b>
<br><b>stories and even I the confirmed horror adict got the chills. I
have had some</b>
<br><b>ghostly experiences in a house I use to live in. It wasn't untill
the other</b>
<br><b>day that my mom and I&nbsp; were shoting tha breeze and the subject
of ghosts came</b>
<br><b>up. We both admitted to each other that that we thought pur old
house in</b>
<br><b>emporia ks was haunted. It was the first time since we moved from
there that</b>
<br><b>we talked about it; I was seventeen when we moved i'm twenty now.
Anyway we</b>
<br><b>lived in the little old boring town of emporia Kansas for about
three years</b>
<br><b>and during that we had some pretty hinkie things happen in our house.</b>
<br><b>Nothing of course far from the average hauntings. My mother and
I both hear</b>
<br><b>footsteps in different parts of the house countless times. Many
times my mom</b>
<br><b>and i can remeber hearing the voices of several people in house
while one of</b>
<br><b>us were home alone. It was never distinquisable what the voices
were saying</b>
<br><b>but they were definatly there. Every day when I came home from school
i</b>
<br><b>became accustom to heavy footsteps in the unfinished side of the
basement and</b>
<br><b>then usually loud crashing sounds as if a box fell. When I would
go to</b>
<br><b>investgate everything would be in it's rightful place untouched
by human</b>
<br><b>hands at least. There were many cold spots in the house ands many
rooms that</b>
<br><b>i could never go in. The guest room for example was so stifflingly
cold and</b>
<br><b>still that it made ones hair stand on end. It's hard it explain
but the</b>
<br><b>overwhelming since of evil in the guest room made one fles in fear
on seconds</b>
<br><b>after entering. infact there were many rooms my cat would not go
in including</b>
<br><b>the guest room. This is very unsual because my dear old cat is very
nosey and</b>
<br><b>always in to everything every where. I also experinced many sicking
damp</b>
<br><b>musty oders thoughout the house: i mean the kind that literaly blew
over and</b>
<br><b>sent your stomach churing. My mom told me that one morning when
she was home</b>
<br><b>by here self painting the living room&nbsp; that some pretty werid
things happen.</b>
<br><b>She had all the doors locked since she was by herself but when she
went to</b>
<br><b>the kitchen for a drink she noticed the silding glass doors that
opened to</b>
<br><b>the court yard were hanging open. She closed and locked them and
went back to</b>
<br><b>work only to find later when she returned to the kicthen to find
that they</b>
<br><b>were hanging wide open again. The same day she opened a window in
the guest</b>
<br><b>bedroom to let some cool air in. When she went back later to close
it while</b>
<br><b>she was still home alone she found it already closed and locked!
It wasn't</b>
<br><b>long after that that i had the day of for conferences or something.
I was</b>
<br><b>watching tv in the family room and decded to close the inside shutters
on the</b>
<br><b>two big windows reduce the sun glare on the tv screen. After i finished</b>
<br><b>shuting and latching them i head to the powder room. When i got
back all the</b>
<br><b>shutters had been pulled back open. Anyway those are the highlights
of waht</b>
<br><b>happened in that house. Mind you things would also disapear and
then reapear</b>
<br><b>on the oddest of places as to be expected. My mother and i are very</b>
<br><b>disapointed from never actually seeing a ghost only fleeting shadows
now and</b>
<br><b>then. There one more thing I would like to mention that happened.
One weekend</b>
<br><b>morning my family woke up to find long scratchs across and covering
the</b>
<br><b>kitchen table. They looked as though they had been made with a penicil</b>
<br><b>eraser.</b>
<br><b>I don't know much about the history of the house. It was about thirty
years</b>
<br><b>old the poeple we bought it fromk built it and rasied there children
there</b>
<br><b>and lived there ever since. A neighborhood elder did tell me that
anoter</b>
<br><b>house stood on the lot. Also i think it's noteworthy to add that
we lived</b>
<br><b>just arounf tehh corner form the town cemtery and crypt. In the
fall with the</b>
<br><b>leaves off the trees we could see the head stones from out front
windows.</b>
<br><b>What a lovely view eh!</b>
<br><b>Note: I left my father out of this because he is the scpetic if
scpectics and</b>
<br><b>won't believe for a moment that there's such things as ghosts or
that out old</b>
<br><b>house was ever haunted. In short he's a pain in the you know what.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Housewarming</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: fianna_kin@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi there, I have been reading your stories and decided</b>
<br><b>to add my own to the mix. My friend Adrian had just</b>
<br><b>moved into her new house. It was the first time she</b>
<br><b>had lived away from her parents and we were all going</b>
<br><b>to have a huge party at her new house. As we got ready</b>
<br><b>for the party, we realized that the house was</b>
<br><b>freezing. This was immpossible because the power had</b>
<br><b>gone out two hours before, and the AC was not working.</b>
<br><b>This is Florida in mid summer, it was over 90 degrees</b>
<br><b>outside and 100% humidity. Yet the thermostat in the</b>
<br><b>house said it was 65 degrees. We tried to ignore it</b>
<br><b>and decided to make it a black out party, the kind</b>
<br><b>with candles and lanterns. Well the party went fine</b>
<br><b>and me and three of my friends decided to stay the</b>
<br><b>night. About two hours after the party ended, about</b>
<br><b>2:30 or so, I woke up with a feeling of dread. At that</b>
<br><b>instant, Adrian started screaming, this woke up my</b>
<br><b>other friends and we rushed over to her. Now Adrian</b>
<br><b>was prone to night terrors so this is the first thing</b>
<br><b>we thought. But then she woke up and started telling</b>
<br><b>us that she had seen a man kill an entire family in</b>
<br><b>her dream. Now Adrian doesn't remember her night</b>
<br><b>terrors, so this was unusual. Sara, Adrians friend was</b>
<br><b>versed in hypnotism and we decided to put her in a</b>
<br><b>suggestive trance and see if we can help figure out</b>
<br><b>the dream. It wasn't long before we all got goosebumbs</b>
<br><b>and noticed that we could see our breath. At that</b>
<br><b>point Adrian started dscribing the killings in the</b>
<br><b>voice of a small child, we figured out that she was</b>
<br><b>the youngest daughter in a family of five, and that</b>
<br><b>the killer was her moms ex husband and her father.</b>
<br><b>Suddenly Adrian started screaming that he was coming</b>
<br><b>after her. We were afraid that if she was killed in</b>
<br><b>the dream, that she would die in real life. So we</b>
<br><b>started altering her vision by inserting her Dungeons</b>
<br><b>and Dragons character to give her strength. She slowly</b>
<br><b>woke up and needless to say she moved in with Sara</b>
<br><b>until her lease was up.&nbsp; I also want to point out that</b>
<br><b>Dungeons and Dragons is only evil if the player is</b>
<br><b>evil. The game itself is just a game, no more.</b><b></b>

<p><b>About five years ago I was out with 2 girlfriends of mine.&nbsp;

know what</b>

like a</b>
<br><b>shadow in the road.&nbsp; It looked like a woman in an old fashioned
hoop-type</b>
<br><b>skirt with a small boy right behind her.&nbsp; The image was flat
on the</b>
<br><b>ground and at an angle like a shadow, but was&nbsp; much darker
and more</b>
<br><b>clearly outlined.&nbsp; The image became visible just before we
drove right</b>
<br><b>through it.&nbsp; My friend slammed on the brakes and we all screamed,

with</b>

<br><b>Why Me?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: macha23@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My name is colleen, I'm twenty four years old and for as long as
i can</b>
<br><b>remember i have seen things. My family thinks i'm strange, after
all they</b>
<br><b>won't admit to the things i've seen.</b>
<br><b>I always find it hard to begin talking of the strange occurrences
within</b>
<br><b>my life. My parents find it easiest to joke about it. A few of my
friends</b>
<br><b>take me seriously, and my husband feels helpless.&nbsp; I find it
hard because I</b>
<br><b>truly don't know where to begin. Things have been happening to me
since my first</b>
<br><b>memories, and then some.&nbsp; I have always commented that I live
in a haunter</b>
<br><b>house, however to be more close to the truth, I am the one who is
haunted.</b>
<br><b>While I cannot vouch for the first encounter my mother can. I was
adopted</b>
<br><b>at birth, I have known this all my life however I have never known
anything</b>
<br><b>of my birth family. Shortly after my parents adopted me I fell ill.
From the</b>
<br><b>time I was three months old till I was nine months old I had sever</b>
<br><b>bronchitis. My mother being a nurse was told that the best thing
that</b>
<br><b>could be done for me was to have a vaporizer running constantly
in my room. It</b>
<br><b>was good sound advice but it eventually led to having the ceiling
fall in on</b>
<br><b>me. There was no place in my room that there weren't large chunks
of plaster,</b>
<br><b>except for my crib. The plaster had fallen in large chunks and it
was easy</b>
<br><b>for them to find the pieces that would have been right above me.
They were</b>
<br><b>across the room from me.</b>
<br><b>My parents being shook up moved to another house.</b>
<br><b>The next story my parents are fond of telling comes from when I
was three.</b>
<br><b>This one I remember. I was on my way upstairs to my bedroom. This
had been</b>
<br><b>my room for as long as I could remember. I got to the top of the
stairs</b>
<br><b>and walked into my room and there standing in the doorway of my
room was a</b>
<br><b>man. He was wearing a black outfit and had blue eyes. No white to
the eye just</b>
<br><b>blue. That's when he started moving towards me. I screamed and flew
down</b>
<br><b>the stairs. My parents recall hearing me scream and then seeing
me not touch a</b>
<br><b>single stair on my way down I continued ranting that there was a
ghost in</b>
<br><b>my room. My parents assured me that there was no such thing. They
escorted me</b>
<br><b>upstairs and put me to bed. From that point in time I saw the man</b>
<br><b>frequently. Not ever time was as scary as that time, at least not
until I</b>
<br><b>hit ten. When I turned ten my father got a job in another town.
On the moving day I</b>
<br><b>saw him standing in the window to my room. He was very upset. That
was all</b>
<br><b>I could tell. Then three months into living in our new home things
started</b>
<br><b>happening. My room would continually be 20 degrees lower in temperature</b>
<br><b>than the rest of the house.&nbsp; Things would disappear out of
my room and appear</b>
<br><b>in the backyard, my grandmother's house, even at my school. Then
the door</b>
<br><b>started opening and closing on it's own.&nbsp; As if this wasn't
bad enough I</b>
<br><b>began hearing voices. I would hear my mother calling my name.&nbsp;
I would go</b>
<br><b>through my house asking my mother, father and brother if they had
called</b>
<br><b>me. They never would. By now we had lived in the house for about
two years. We</b>
<br><b>had gotten a cat and dog. They would only go into my room when I
was there</b>
<br><b>too. My dog would stand and bark at my room. But the man from the
old</b>
<br><b>house did not show up again till I was 15.</b>
<br><b>I woke one night out of a sound sleep with a start. I did not know
why I</b>
<br><b>had awoken and then my dog started barking.&nbsp; That's when he
appeared. He was</b>
<br><b>standing in my closet just staring at me. From that point on till
I moved</b>
<br><b>out on my own I never had a peaceful nights sleep again. My parents
would</b>
<br><b>complain of me kicking the walls of my room, or slamming my door</b>
<br><b>repeatedly, they even came in one summer day to find the window
open. The room was</b>
<br><b>freezing though. It had been 90 some odd degrees out and the air
was on</b>
<br><b>but my room was 50 degrees.</b>
<br><b>When I moved out at the age of eighteen things followed me, but
the did</b>
<br><b>not affect me. Others were the ones who saw things.&nbsp; This continued
till I</b>
<br><b>moved back home. By then my cat had died mysteriously and my dog
was going</b>
<br><b>blind. Things started up again but this time my younger brother
was having</b>
<br><b>similar problems. Things got so bad that I could not spend a night
alone in the</b>
<br><b>house. If I did I would wake with large bruises and scratches on
my body.</b>
<br><b>The few times I did I found it easier to blame them on the dog,
or the</b>
<br><b>next door neighbors. Sometimes even on my own imagination as there
were times</b>
<br><b>things got so bad I found I had to turn to sleeping pills or alcohol
so</b>
<br><b>that I could sleep and ignore the things I saw.</b>
<br><b>It was at that time I turned to my neighbor across the street. She
was my</b>
<br><b>age and she had some of the same sorta things happening in her house.
That</b>
<br><b>was when I went to volunteer at the historical society for the county.
The</b>
<br><b>entire area that was our subdivision had been Indian grounds up
until the</b>
<br><b>mid 1800's.</b>
<br><b>After finding this out I quickly moved. But things followed me.
I moved</b>
<br><b>out of the town but still they followed me. Eventually I got married;
my</b>
<br><b>husband being a firm skeptic just laughed at me. That is until he
spent his first</b>
<br><b>night at my parent's home.</b>
<br><b>With me gone whatever was in their house began attacking my brother.
He</b>
<br><b>got to the same point that I did that he could not stay home alone.
For that</b>
<br><b>atter neither could my mother. So they put the house up for sale
and</b>
<br><b>moved quickly. The house took forever to sell no one wanted it would
look like</b>
<br><b>it was going to sell and then it would fall through. This continued
for nine</b>
<br><b>months and then someone finally bought it for significantly less
than what</b>
<br><b>it was worth.</b>
<br><b>They bought a brand new house, right next to the old soldiers and
sailors</b>
<br><b>home and orphanage. This place had bothered me since I was going
to summer</b>
<br><b>camp and an after school program there when we first moved.&nbsp;
The orphanage</b>
<br><b>had not been used since WWII. But I could hear the sound of children</b>
<br><b>crying from different buildings and the playground.&nbsp; Our fist
night there we both</b>
<br><b>hear the sounds of children crying coming from the closet. And then
the</b>
<br><b>faces started to appear.</b>
<br><b>My husband and I have a new home where the lights dim occasionally
and the</b>
<br><b>cable goes out in our apartment only. The man still appears in the
hallway</b>
<br><b>of our home, and now two little girls can be seen.</b>
<br><b>My friends all say that it is just me, after all no one can have
luck bad</b>
<br><b>enough to live in five different haunted homes. Or can they? You
tell me</b>
<br><b>is it just me?</b><b></b>

<br><b>Unexpected Visitor</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Tien Pham</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It happened four years ago and it also my first
year in college. I was living with my sister and brother in-law at that
time. I remembered...I went to bed early that day, but keep in mind I wasn't
tired. The minutes I closed my eyes I realized that I have fallen into
a deep sleep, but wide awake somewhere else. I saw this man who's in his
early 40's, I never seen him before. He just look at me w/o blinking his
eyes, I noticed that his face were green.</b>
<br><b>I can't move, I don't know why and I don't know if this is real
or it's a dream and I also don't know when does it last. I got up the next
morning and went to my sister's bedroom and told her the dream that I had.
This is weird....the moment I step inside her bedroom.. on my right hand
side she hang a picture of a man in his early 40s. I was scared and surprised
whyshe has his picture on the wall. It was pretty spooky....I sweared...
I saw the same man last night. I described the man tomy sister and she
said it was her father in-law. The story when back to the 70S.. when her
father in-law were killed by the Vietcong which is the North Vietnamese.
She said</b>
<br><b>that the Vietcong cut off her father in-law's head and throw it
somewhere. When the family found out; the only thing they recognized are
the other half of the body which is from the neck down. After that I packed
my stuff..........OUT!</b><b></b>

<br><b>A Night to Remember</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: johlee@mindspring.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>A few years back when I was first starting to become interested in
the supernatural and the</b>
<br><b>occult I was involved in a group that for fun purposefully went
out to find things that were</b>
<br><b>strange,unexplainable and just down right weird. Well we had recieved
word that we might be able to</b>
<br><b>find one such place several mile outside of the city limits back
off in the woods. It was rumored</b>
<br><b>that an old satantic cult had used to have ceremonies at a clearing
far back off of one of</b>
<br><b>the farm roads. Well after checking some sources one of the guys
(and all names are changed from</b>
<br><b>here)Sam knew where this place was so four of Sam,Jake, Mike and
myself all pile into Sam's car</b>
<br><b>and go off on our adventure. Well after we found the road the only
way to really get back down into</b>
<br><b>the place was to drive backwards so that you could be assured that
if you needed to get out of</b>
<br><b>there you would not have to back out all the way in a hurry and
the distance is more than a quarter</b>
<br><b>of a mile down a very narrow dead end road with no turn arounds.
Anyway,after the backward trip into</b>
<br><b>a completely pitch black backwoods dead end we were getting pumped
up to get rolling when all of</b>
<br><b>a sudden I get hit with this wave of complete and absolute dread
and fear. Jake and Sam had already</b>
<br><b>exited the car and gone to the edge of the woods and Mike and myself
were getting the last of the</b>
<br><b>flashlights and stuff together. I looked at Mike and told him I
cannot go. He starts to protest</b>
<br><b>that we were all in this together and that staying would just be
chickening out. I told him I did not</b>
<br><b>feel well about this and he too admitted to be a little shaken but
it was not going to stop him. A</b>
<br><b>second later Jake and Sam ran back to the car and jumped in looking
at me and say hey you can't stay</b>
<br><b>by your self in the car. What was strange is that there was no way
they could have heard mine and</b>
<br><b>Mike's conversation since the windows were rolled up and they were
already some distance from the</b>
<br><b>car. They both told me that they had got this overwhelming sense
that if we were to seperate</b>
<br><b>then something terrible would happen. I thought to myself for a
moment that would I rather be left</b>
<br><b>alone in the middle of nowhere or take a risk and do what I had
came for and stick it out. So as we</b>
<br><b>make our way out of the car and start walking back up the trail
into the woods we all stopped at the</b>
<br><b>same time and listened. We started hearing the growling and howls
of several dogs. At first they</b>
<br><b>were in the distance but they quickly started closing in. We all
looked at each other and</b>
<br><b>without a word we all started running back to the car. As soon as
we jumped in and closed the door</b>
<br><b>we started to hear crashing all around us coming from the woods
as if many different someones or</b>
<br><b>somethings were about to crash down on us at any moment and the
sound of dogs barking were right</b>
<br><b>behind us. Sam hard trouble getting the car started at first because
he kept fumbling the</b>
<br><b>clutch but he finally got it and we tore up the road about 200 yards
and stopped to see if</b>
<br><b>anything was following. We could not see anything with the flashlights
but we deffinately heard the</b>
<br><b>dogs closing in right behind us. Sam gunned and right before we
made it to the end he stopped and</b>
<br><b>we yelled what the h#*! are you doing?!!? In front of us the road
was covered in a huge swath of some</b>
<br><b>dark red liquid. The dogs were catching up right behind us and we
could still not see them but as Mike and</b>
<br><b>myself were looking out behind this figure in a dark brown or black
robe passed right</b>
<br><b>behind the car and that was that Sam gunned it The next day we came
back with several people only to</b>
<br><b>find a couple of dog tracks and all else peaceful. Thanks for reading
and sorry about the lenght. I</b>
<br><b>have had other experiences since then and will relate them from
time to time here. SL from Texas</b>
