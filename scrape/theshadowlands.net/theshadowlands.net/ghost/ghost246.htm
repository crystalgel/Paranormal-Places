<P><B>Grove City College Haunting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: SOVICHPJ1@GCC.EDU</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am a sophomore at Grove City College in Pennsylvania.&nbsp; I have
always believed in ghosts, but nothing really substantial had every happened
to me before a few weeks ago.&nbsp; Sometime in October, the college was
showing a movie in the auditorium at Crawford Hall, which is our administration
building that dates back to the 1930's and is one of the oldest on campus.&nbsp;
It is a gothic, old-collegiate style building complete with stone archways
and marble floors that echo loudly when anyone walks across them.&nbsp;
I went to see the 10:00 movie with my girlfriend, and we both had to use
the restroom about an hour into it.&nbsp; The bathrooms in Crawford Hall
are located in the basement, so we went down to our respective restrooms,
seeing nobody else around.&nbsp; While I was taking care of business in
the men's room, I heard a knock on the door.&nbsp; I asked what they wanted,
and heard a female voice say "housekeeping".&nbsp; I thought this was VERY
strange, since I have never seen the cleaning staff at work in the evening,
only in the mornings, and this was around 11:00 pm on a Friday night.&nbsp;
I told her that I would be out in a minute, and finished up.&nbsp; I came
out; expecting there to be one of the cleaning ladies waiting by the door
with her cart, but there was nobody there.&nbsp; This gave me the creeps,
so I looked around the entire floor while I was waiting for my girlfriend,
but found nobody.&nbsp; When my girlfriend came out, I asked her if the
cleaning lady went into the ladies room, but she didn't know what I was
talking about.&nbsp; I told her what had happened, so we both looked around
the entire building in search of any cleaning staff.&nbsp; We couldn't
find anybody.&nbsp; Except for the rest-rooms and the people in the auditorium
watching the movie, the entire building was empty, dark, and closed.&nbsp;
When I thought about what happened, it seemed very strange because I did
not hear any footsteps or the squeaky wheels of one of the carts the cleaning
ladies always take with them . . . all I had heard was a knock and a female
voice, which I remember oddly gave me the chills when I had heard it, and
that was before I came out to find nobody there.</B>
<BR><B>Well, about a week passed, and I had almost forgotten about that
strange incidence.&nbsp; Then the next Friday I picked up a copy of our
weekly college student newspaper.&nbsp; Since it was the week of Halloween,
the newspaper had a story about Grove City College's own resident ghost
. . . the ghost of a former janitor lady who haunts Pew and Crawford Halls.&nbsp;
I read the article, not putting two and two together till about halfway
through it, and when I did and realized that this is what I had encountered,
I nearly passed out.&nbsp; The article told how in the 1970's, a group
of students in Crawford hall late one night conducting a s&eacute;ance
had contacted the spirit of a former janitor who had died a few months
before.&nbsp; They asked her to show herself to them, and while she didn't
then, weird things began to happen in the building.&nbsp; A few years later,
they built a new Arts building, Pew Fine Arts Center, and moved all of
the costumes for plays into there.&nbsp; It is believed that the spirit
of the woman, who had helped make many of the costumes, followed them into
the new building, and strange things began to happen there too.&nbsp; In
the 1980's, the ghost started appearing to people, including one appearance
to several hundred people in the auditorium of Pew during a campus musical.&nbsp;
The college officials decided something needed to be done before the ghost
scared someone working on catwalk above the auditorium where she was often
spotted, which would be dangerous because that person could fall trying
to get away.&nbsp; One of the college professors, a practicing exorcist,
spoke with the ghost asking her to leave.&nbsp; Since then, nobody has
seen her, but strange things still happen in Crawford Hall and Pew Fine
Arts Center, much like what happened to me.&nbsp; People hear voices and
footsteps when nobody is there, and sometimes the ghost even traps students
for a few minutes between the two sets of double doors that lead into the
Pew Fine Arts Center, but that could just be an excuse for being late for
class.&nbsp; I don't know if what happened to me was the ghost for sure,
but I have no way of explaining it, and it still gives me the chills when
I think about it.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Growing Up in a Haunted House</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: KRose@DPI.STATE.NC.US</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was younger I lived in a haunted house in Long Beach, NY.</B>
<BR><B>Everyone in our entire house was affected by whatever it was that
lived</B>
<BR><B>with us.&nbsp; We lived in a beach community that was pretty much
just</B>
<BR><B>bungalows on the block.&nbsp; We had no trees in our yard, only
sand and</B>
<BR><B>concrete.&nbsp; So, when the shadows started on the ceilings, my
father knew</B>
<BR><B>something was weird about the house.&nbsp; Plus, the entire time
we lived</B>
<BR><B>there (3 months), I stayed sick.&nbsp; Very sick, so sick I had
to go to the</B>
<BR><B>ER several times.&nbsp; And to this day I haven't been sick since
(and I was</B>
<BR><B>7 then and I'm 29 now).&nbsp; The day we moved in, I knew this house
was</B>
<BR><B>trouble.&nbsp; I was the first to the front gate, I pushed it open,
and it</B>
<BR><B>came flying back at me, hitting me in the forehead, knocking me
to the</B>
<BR><B>ground.&nbsp; That was the first incident.&nbsp; Then my uncle came
to stay with</B>
<BR><B>us, and he told my mom that he had seen a little girl in his bedroom
and</B>
<BR><B>he thought it was one of us, and he asked why the girl had a balloon
so</B>
<BR><B>late at night.&nbsp; It turned out not to be any of us.&nbsp; Then
a few weeks</B>
<BR><B>later, my sister was sick, so she slept on the couch and she saw
the</B>
<BR><B>same image staring into a mirror, holding a balloon, smiling, staring
at</B>
<BR><B>her on the couch.&nbsp; She was so terrified, that she screamed
to my mom and</B>
<BR><B>told her, and that was when we decided to pack up and move.&nbsp;
Since my</B>
<BR><B>uncle had seen the same thing.&nbsp; Also, one night I talked during
the</B>
<BR><B>movie we were watching, so my dad sent me to my room to stand in
the</B>
<BR><B>corner.&nbsp; While in my room, in the corner.&nbsp; I was beside
my closet which</B>
<BR><B>had no door, just a curtain (and it was open).&nbsp; Well, the top
shelf had</B>
<BR><B>books on it and they came flying off the shelf one by one.&nbsp;
I was</B>
<BR><B>freaking out, and my dad came in there to see why I was screaming,
and</B>
<BR><B>he saw them flying off.&nbsp; We slept with him that night, and
we moved very</B>
<BR><B>soon afterward.&nbsp; It was a scary house.&nbsp; We would hear
things all night</B>
<BR><B>in the ceiling.&nbsp; And we had no attic to check it out.&nbsp;
The shadows</B>
<BR><B>dancing on the ceiling, and the extremely scary basement that NO
ONE</B>
<BR><B>ever wanted to go into (unless we were in pairs!).&nbsp; It was
a frightening</B>
<BR><B>experience for the short time we lived there.&nbsp; As soon as we
moved, we</B>
<BR><B>had peace.&nbsp; We would spend hours playing in the basement!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Happy House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bev.lang@shaw.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>I'm 15 and currently living in the 4th house in my live its quite
an old house but because of the small town i live in I cant get a back
ground on it . It is haunted buy at least one poltergeist and a few other
spirits. children I think. I have pictures on film of the orbs in my house&nbsp;
threes one picture with 8 orbs in it at once. another where the orb is
right beside my face. I have been standing at one time in front of our
kettle in witch case one of my friends interested in the paranormal activity
sees the kettle go up and fall downin about a centemeater space and i hear
it , we both froze and i asked if a ghost moved it, he said yes. one time
I came hem with two of my friends and all the doors were locked I had no
way in I got a latter and opened a window on the second story of my house
the only way in was removing the screen and push in the window to the side&nbsp;
to unlock the doors to get my friends in, none&nbsp; was&nbsp; home and
I was telling them it defiantly was a ghost because my mom didn't lock
the doors the keys were on the inside of the house and everything was dead
bolted shut. the old room I slept in in the house was one wit the most
paranormal activity&nbsp; but everyone who went in it told me that they
feel great in it and warm and cozy. I at one time in counterd a horrible
spirit when I had a sleep over my friend and I saw in our heads vivid horrible
gross pictures tat had originated form some outer source. we abruptly told
whatever it was to leave and not come back a few hours later we felt the
presance leave after no reactions from us and we went to sleep. but never
in any other cases&nbsp; have they left negative energy or made me feel
un comfortable ....every house I have lived in has been haunted but fortunately
for me non&nbsp; the bad kind. my mom and dad are usually the ones who
feel the cold spots or hear things see things and feel things . I have
come to some what of a number of conclusions why&nbsp; I cant do any of
these things , the first is that like people who can talk to The ghosts
I am the opposite and can not sense them . possibly i have done too many
protection spells in my life time and am un able to be contacted . maybe
I am just used to being around ghosts and sencing them too much to notice
now what is going on or because I'm always cold not feeling cold spots.
I have friends who are very in to this paranormal stuff and one like me
cant see or since the things the outers can. this scares us cause they
could be there and we wouldn't know. as a child and through my life I predicted
things in my dreams , deaths, breakups.. exc. I wonder why I cant see these
presence's in my house and wonder how I can get to . I feel no need to
"release" these trapped spirits because they are not harming anyone maybe
even helping us.I am not wanting to create lesser of a void to our "world"....</B>

<P><B>Haunted Apartment Building</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: brdldy962@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi,</B>
<BR><B>I've always believed in ghosts and now I live in a 100 year old
haunted building.&nbsp; I moved in with my boyfriend a year and a half
ago in July.&nbsp; The night I moved in I had an experience that was a
bit unnerving in the light of day.&nbsp; I received a call from a friend
that evening and she asked me if I could take her and her kids to the airport
in the morning.&nbsp; I said sure I will and set my alarm to go off at
5:00 am so I could go get her and get to the airport on time for her.&nbsp;
Well my alarm went off but I was so tired from the move I forgot why it
was going off and fell back to sleep.&nbsp; An hour later I felt the bed
shaking as if someone were trying to get me up.&nbsp; I remember thinking
"What Now" and then fell back to sleep only to be woken up 20 mins. later
by the phone ringing.&nbsp; My friend said she would get a ride from her
sister.&nbsp; After the call I looked over to the kitchen and saw a gray
figure in the door that seemed to shake it head at me.&nbsp; I immediately
knew he was what tried to wake me up so I could keep my promise to my friend.&nbsp;
He seemed to have the best of intentions and I didn't see him again after
that.&nbsp; He seemed very friendly.</B>
<BR><B>We then moved down to the 2nd floor and I soon found we have a ghost
here too.&nbsp; This one likes to pace up and down our short hall between
the door and the living room.&nbsp; He also paces along the south-west
wall of the living room sometimes.&nbsp; I get the impression that he is
a man in a brown pinstripe suit &amp; bowler hat and he has a mustache
and deep set eyes.&nbsp; He stands about my height around 5'8".&nbsp; When
we first moved in he would pace the hallway coming coming further and further
out into the living/bedroom (it’s a studio apartment).&nbsp; He seemed
highly agitated.&nbsp; My boyfriend saw him more than me and a few times
he would arrive home from work and the top dead bolt would be locked.&nbsp;
We never use that lock as it is very difficult to open with the key from
the outside.&nbsp; My boyfriend works grave yard at a 24/7 store and I
am alone here at night for 4 nights a week.&nbsp; One night I noticed that
he was coming further and further out in to the living room and he was
giving off vibes that were not friendly.&nbsp; I had had it about now and
looked at the hallway and said "Listen the year is 2001, not 1903 or whatever
year you think it is.&nbsp; Times have changed and it's OK for people to
live together with out being married.&nbsp; So lay off it!!!"&nbsp; I felt
a feeling of surprise from the hallway and have not had a problem from
him since.</B>
<BR><B>I related this to the apartment manager with whom we had become
good friends and she said that she had seen him too and I was right in
my impressions of what he looks like as that is who she has seen in our
place when her son lived in the studio.&nbsp; She has also seen him in
the hallway outside our apartment door.&nbsp; She said that there are several
ghost in the building and she is not surprised to hear stories about them
as she has also had experiences with them when she first moved in the building
before she was manager.</B>
<BR><B>It's an interesting place to live to say the least.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Haunted Apartment</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jorge.pacca@uol.com.br</B><B></B>

<P><B>The incidents that you are about to read happened to me when I was
a college student several years ago. We had inherited an old apartment
from our grandfather and two years after his death our family moved in.
The fact is that it was OK in the beginning. Weird things started to happen
soon after my dad was transferred to another town and my parents left both
me and my sister in the apartment.&nbsp; During the day we could hear noises
coming from the ceiling and we wondered what the neighbors upstairs were
up to. We didn't give much thought to that until we started hearing them
in the middle of the night. It sounded as if someone was dragging chairs
and tables around the apartment.&nbsp; We knew our upstairs neighbors.
They were an old couple and had one son who occasionally paid them a visit.
One night the noise went so wild that we decided to run upstairs to complain
about it. I rang the bell several times and banged at the door. No one
answered it. Apparently there was nobody home. This situation went on for
months and we finally talked to our neighbors. The old lady was baffled
and claimed she would never do such a thing. That was crazy! Anyone who
came to our home would hear the noises. One morning my maid was working
in the kitchen when she heard someone open the living room door and walk
along the hallway. She was scared to death but she never thought it could
be a ghost. She quickly took out a knife and searched the whole apartment
for a burglar.&nbsp; Again there was no one there. It was not uncommon
to sense someone watching us or in the room. Just a presence. Once I was
writing a paper and I clearly felt someone behind me and as I turned around
I saw nobody. My sister was so afraid to stay alone in the apartment that
she would wait for me downstairs. The most frightening thing was to come:
We were sleeping in our bedrooms when we heard bangings inside my closet,
They were so loud that I woke up and jumped out of my bed immediately thinking
the shelves inside had tumbled.&nbsp; When we opened the door we saw nothing.
The closet was in the corner of the room and we didn't have neighbors next
door. It couldn't have come from outside the apartment either. The noises
were so real that we didn't doubt they were there. When we sensed someone
around us we didn't wonder if they were ghosts because the whole thing
was so real. The ghost idea only dawned on us some time after the incidents.
We are not ghost freaks. Well, after that last incident I grabbed my mattress
and slept in my sister's room. On the next day I went to a church and brought
home some holly water which I sprinkled all over the place. Things calmed
down for a while. A year later we moved out and we heard that the family
who had bought it moved out one year later.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Haunted Carriage House, Hudson MA</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: maryhatch54@attbi.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I personally experienced unexplainable occurences at a carriage house
that I lived in for&nbsp; short period of time. Things banging in the night,
the spiral staircast having a cold spot in the center where ( as the story
goes) a man was murdered there by a pitchfork that was thrown at him by
a jealous enraged husband. The man was a care taker of the horses and carriages
for a prominent family and had an affair with the wife. When the husband
found out he murdered him. Things disappearing, and showing up in another
place days later.My uncle running scared from the house one night after
he said someone had enetered the room and sat on his bed, he saw noone
but the imprint in the matress.</B>

<P><B>i don't know if your interest in my story as I'm only 14 years old
but..........</B>
<BR><B>Last year I went to a haunted castle. i have always bevieved in
the super-natural, ghosts &amp; spirits despite what my friends say. Any
way I was at this castle when I felt really cold and shivery. I know that
is a sort of sign that a ghostly presence is near by. I have head of the
orbs that show up on camera but I have never had one of them until this
day! My mum took my picture next to the bed of the most haunted room in
the castle. We have a digit camera so we could see it straight away. It
was later on when I was walking down a corrider that I heard someone whisper
my name. Not many people were around and Mum swore it wasn't her. I carried
on when all of sudden I tripped over nothing and twisted my ankle. I got
upo and hobbled to a seat. The rest of the group went. My mum went to get
some ice with a member of staff. I was alone. I looked up and down the
corrider when I saw a woman coming over to me. I was polite and said hello.
She said nothing. Fine, I thought as i looked away. I looked at her again
but</B>

<P><B>By: KDBeaty@cs.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>In Manteca there is this house. The house somehow kinda possess you
if you live there. Some kind of demon affects your dreams. The bathroom
gave my sister an eerie feeling. The backyard was very scary, there was
a shed in the back that didn't seem right. My whole family DID NOT like
the garage. My sisters room was so scary, I didn't like&nbsp; going in
there. NO ONE WAS THEIR SELF IN THAT HOUSE! The laundry room was so cold.
I didn't like it one bit.Whoever lives there now, I wish them the best
of luck.</B>

<P><B>Of my own personal experiences, I can report a few cities:</B>
<BR><B>Lake Elsinore:&nbsp; While staying alone in a house near the lake,
I was startled</B>
<BR><B>to see a small terrier run from the back rooms, turn left into the
kitchen,</B>
<BR><B>and through the closed kitchen door!&nbsp; My dogs were in North
Carolina at the</B>
<BR><B>time, and I was alone in the house!</B>
<BR><B>Canoga Park.&nbsp; My current apartment has a poltergeist who takes
money,</B>
<BR><B>tweezers, my glasses, scares my cats and birds, turns off my tv,
rings my</B>
<BR><B>phone.&nbsp; I have about 6 sets of tweezers, as they kept disappearing.&nbsp;
I had</B>
<BR><B>cleared off the bathroom counter looking for a pair, and spoke out
loud with</B>
<BR><B>exasperation to give them back!&nbsp; I went out for a while, and
when I came</B>
<BR><B>home, the only thing on the counter was a pair of tweezers!&nbsp;
When laying</B>
<BR><B>down for a nap, I put my glasses on my left side nightstand.&nbsp;
When I awoke,</B>
<BR><B>I couldn't find them anywhere!&nbsp; After hours of searching, they
were located</B>
<BR><B>6 feet away to the right behind the head of the bed!&nbsp; Other
than that, he is</B>
<BR><B>an ok spirit to have around, just a little annoying.</B>
<BR><B>Granada Hills:&nbsp; My fiance's mother died in this house.&nbsp;
The first night I</B>
<BR><B>stayed there, I awoke and saw her.&nbsp; I have sensed her, spoken
to her, seen</B>

<P><B>Haunted Rehab in PA</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: pugs120@rcn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi, My name is Lisa, about 3 years ago I was in a Rehab for about
2 months, it was up in Layfayette Hills, Pa. The place was an old 1800's
HUGE mansion where the owners daughter Eugenia, was mentally ill, back
then they did not know the things they do now of course, and her wealthy
father donated the house and it's land to people in the profession, after
his daughter hung herself in the main foyer from the grande staircase.</B>
<BR><B>The name of the rehab is Eugenia House, and it was in everyway,
still HER house. The house itself is now used as offices , and meeting
room, some of them original, in fact, most of the house is still original,
except the actuall rehab whitch was built off of the house. Anyway, being
very into the paranormal, I was EXTREMELY interested in the history and
to know first hand if it was in fact haunted.</B>
<BR><B>Every time I could, I went in there, listened to the people who
had worked there for yeare, and believed there stories, some of them would
not go in there after dark, now I was determined to know.</B>
<BR><B>One evening after dinner, me and my friend Brian sneaked off to
investigate, it was totally empty, as we walked up the main staircase,
I was hit with this very cold air, all around me, I was really scared,
but went up anyway, as we got to the top, we went right, into one of the
offices we walked&nbsp; in alittle further and I was uneasy, as I turned
to look at Brian, we both heard shuffleing, like books moving around on
one of the desks, then it sounded like a large book fell very hard to the
floor, as we turned to run out of the room I was disoriented and did not
know where to go, so I followed Brian, a s we fled towards the main staircase,
these Very big double wooden doors at the top of the stairs that in my
wole time there were never closed, and they were so big and heavy don;t
know if I could close them without help, SLAMMED shut right behind us,
the stairs were very long, as we got to the bottom we stopped and looked
up and as we did, the cold air hit us very hard, like a winter wind, it
felt like it swirled around us on purpous, investigating us, it made me
us just stand there, in awe almost, them after a few minuts that felt like
forever, we fled out the door.</B>
<BR><B>We told the believers in the group, who were amazed, and I'll never
forget that.</B>
<BR><B>After that, I did not go back in at night, but in the courtyard
where we all smoked, you could look in the front windows, one night shortly
after that, I was telling one of the cool counslers of my tale, and peering
in the one window at the same time, as I spoke one of the big overhead
outside lights would flicker, only when I mentioned Eugenia's name, it
was very deliberate, the counsler was extreamly convinced, and stated to
tell me a few stories of his own that he never shared with anyone until
me, for fear the staff would think he was being foolish,... but neither
of us were.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Haunting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:bvkusa@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello my name is Robert Van Kirk,and a few years ago I</B>
<BR><B>lived in St. Johns Michigan. While I was there strange</B>
<BR><B>things would happen that all centered around the VERY</B>
<BR><B>OLD school called Perrin Palmer. I think there was</B>
<BR><B>more than one ghost involved in these hauntings. And</B>
<BR><B>they werent benign.</B>
<BR><B>It started with hearing strange music near these old</B>
<BR><B>mobile units. It came from a small group of them and I</B>
<BR><B>could always hear it after school and everyone else</B>
<BR><B>could too. No one was there at the time, not even the</B>
<BR><B>janitor. So one day my friend and I decided to</B>
<BR><B>envestigate. When we looked inside one mobile unit we</B>
<BR><B>saw a black cat with glowing red eyes. We ran and</B>
<BR><B>never looked back.</B>
<BR><B>About a year later the school demolished and a new one</B>
<BR><B>built. Whatever was haunting this school didn't like</B>
<BR><B>having its home destroyed. O ya did I mention the</B>
<BR><B>entire school use to hear a train wistle and no train</B>
<BR><B>has run in the town fo 100 years. There are no trains</B>
<BR><B>within 20 miles of the town.</B>
<BR><B>When we were first at Gateway North(the new school) we</B>
<BR><B>thought we got rid of the ghost but we didn't. At</B>
<BR><B>first all it was, was sightings of a black cats around</B>
<BR><B>the premesis of the school but then more harmful</B>
<BR><B>things began to happen. One morning I woke up to deep</B>
<BR><B>scrathes o my arm. It was like a cat had scrathed my</B>
<BR><B>arm. Then on a swing at school a kid fell while in mid</B>
<BR><B>swing. The kid was pushed. She didn't slip. Ten</B>
<BR><B>witnesses saw her fall and it wasn't an accident. No</B>
<BR><B>kid pushed her. She spraigned her arm. Two weeks later</B>
<BR><B>another kid under the same circumstances broke his</B>
<BR><B>arm.</B>
<BR><B>4 more times kids were pushed from the same swing</B>
<BR><B>under the same circumstances. Balls were swerving to</B>
<BR><B>hit kids o the play ground. I left the next year.</B>
<BR><B>I havent been in contact with my freinds since. I</B>
<BR><B>don't know if it is continueing. I hope not.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>CP Rail Home</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mdelorm@telus.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>When my family moved to alittle town in 1980 we rented one of the
old CP Rail homes.Things went good for the fist 6 months,then my brother
and I started noticing things.The tv would change to channels that we never
got, items would dissappear, furniture would move and if we touched it
to put it back the cellar door would start opening when it was nailed shut.Finally
my brother and I went to the cellar to figure out what was down there.Nothing
was down there but dirt and shelves. After that we started to hear laughing
coming from his room on the second floor of the house.His rocking chair
would rock when the tv was on, or we had music on.Then one night when our
parents were gone visiting relatives , we heard the cellar door open, never
paid to much attention to this cause this was normal,we were in the living
room playing cards when both of us got the feeling that we were being watched,
we turned to look out the living room window and all we saw was 2 little
red eyes staring at us. We both ran out to look ,all we found was footprints
in the snow leading to the cellar window. After our parents got back we
showed them the footprints, and the next day we started moving. It wasn't
till about 2 years after that we were told by our mom that she new something
wasn't right about the house,cause she heard noices too in the night,but
never told us, thinking we'd get to scarred. No wonder the kids at the
school looked at us funny when we told them were we lived,and they would
never come over.</B>

<P><B>California Chills</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: Loverslane70@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I had recently sent you a story about someone kissing me at my grand-ma's
house and I told you that I had some more stories.&nbsp; I am sorry, but
I hadn't had time to write you back earlier.</B>
<BR><B>Well, lets see, the house that I grew up in, in Redondo Beach, California,
my mom and I both believe was haunted.&nbsp; It was a little cottage, and
very old, although I don't know the history of the house or the property.&nbsp;
We moved in when I was 8 years old.&nbsp; I know that the lady that lived
there before us had died (I don't know if she died in the house, my mom
always said "No")</B>
<BR><B>I guess that living in a house like that has always seemed normal
to me.&nbsp; My mom said that I used to come out of my room because I would
hear someone calling me and thought that it was her.&nbsp; We figure that
she was there with us for a while.&nbsp; I know that my mom used to get
the creeps in there and would get me up and make me sleep in her room.</B>
<BR><B>I mostly remember things being weird when I was a teen-ager and
older.&nbsp; I know that one night, we were watching t.v.&nbsp; My mom
was in the kitchen making dinner, and something like "Entertainment Tonight"
had come on and suddenly there was someone else there with us.&nbsp; I
knew exactly where they were sitting in the house (the chair by the kitchen
door).&nbsp; I knew that what ever the next segment was, they wanted to
see it (although for the life of me, I can't remember what it was about).</B>
<BR><B>I felt like it was a man, but I couldn't see him.&nbsp; I could
just feel him.&nbsp; He was very non threatening, and he wasn't a stranger.&nbsp;
His presence felt like an old friend, someone that I knew, like my mom's
boyfiends presence (but he's still alive, but it's the only way I can explaine
it).&nbsp; I told my mom when she came back into the living room that there
was someone there and not to sit in that chair.&nbsp; She couldn't see
or feel him, but she believed me.&nbsp; After the segment that he wanted
to see was over, he was gone just a quick as he came.</B>
<BR><B>My mom and I both used to feel someone sitting on out beds at night.&nbsp;
We could feel the mattress dip down with their weight.&nbsp; We think this
may have been my grand pa checking on us.&nbsp; One time, it was a real
cold night, come to think of it, it was always kind of cold in that house.&nbsp;
I just thought it was drafty.&nbsp; Anyway, I was home alone (my mom was
in Illionois, helping with my grandmother).&nbsp; I had been in bed about
10 minutes, and hadn't fallen asleep yet.&nbsp; I had my head covered because
I was so cold.&nbsp; I felt someone sit on my bed.&nbsp; It really freaked
me out, even though it wasn't unusual.&nbsp; Then, who ever it was, pulled
the blanket away from my face!&nbsp; I didn't move an inch.&nbsp; They
finally left.&nbsp; Like I said, most of my expierences are not threatning.</B>
<BR><B>Most were non threatening.&nbsp; One night, a music box on the top
of a shelf (it hadn't been played in a looonnng time, a year or more) suddenly
played about 7 or 8 notes, then quit, them my floor to celing lamp crashed
over, for no reason at all.&nbsp; Needless to say, I finished out the night
in my moms bed with her!</B>
<BR><B>There were more things that happend in that house, so many more.&nbsp;
Just little weird things, things missing, the piano playing on it's own
one time, you know what I mean.</B>
<BR><B>Now, I am married, and I live in San Diego County.&nbsp; My husband
and I have a nice apartment.&nbsp; We are not alone here either.&nbsp;
Both he and I have seen a tall Grey Man.&nbsp; Just real quick, out of
the corner of our eyes, and at different times.</B>
<BR><B>He seems to be nice, and rather helpfull.&nbsp; Our 2nd year here,
we made the mistake of putting our Christmas tree to close to the video
cabnet.&nbsp; It was a big artificial and heavy tree, it took both of us
to move it around.&nbsp; Insted of moving it again, we just fought with
the tree to get to our movies.&nbsp; It seemed eaiser that way.</B>
<BR><B>A few weeks later, I started realizing that the tree had moved.&nbsp;
It was about 2 feet from where we had put it.&nbsp; I kept looking at it,
and I could see where someone tall, had reached in to the "trunk" of the
tree and possible moved it.&nbsp; I asked my husband if he had moved the
tree, and he said that he hadn't.&nbsp; He could see the hole in branches
too.&nbsp; I am sure that he didn't move the tree himself, because like
I said, it's a very large and heavy tree, and by then, it was compleatly
decorated, lites and all.</B>
<BR><B>My husband is a late night person.&nbsp; He likes to stay on the
computer, playing games.&nbsp; On night, he "saw" someone come out of the
guest bathroom, and brush up against at chair, and make my purse swing.&nbsp;
No one was here, except us, and I was in bed asleep.</B>
<BR><B>Every so often, there are weird smells too, that remind me of my
grandma's house (she died about 5 years ago).&nbsp; Someone has taken to
sitting on my bed again (not my husband, cuz I looked and no one was there)
at night sometimes.&nbsp; And a few weeks ago, a music box played while
my husband and I were playing backgammon in our room (not the same music
box as before, but like before, this one hadn't been played in about a
year).&nbsp; The music box is up on a shelf, and hasn't been messed with
any at all.&nbsp; It could have been my aunt Mil that just died in August.&nbsp;
She liked music boxes.</B>
<BR><B>Thanks for listening again, and I hope you enjoy.</B>

<BR><B>I believe I can give you a whole lot of stories of</B>
<BR><B>ghostly experiences with me that seem picular in a</B>
<BR><B>sence.</B>
<BR><B>First of all I have lived in haunted houses since I</B>
<BR><B>was around 4. The first memory I have is when my</B>
<BR><B>family and I lived in a three story mantion built in</B>
<BR><B>1901. Their where sighting of three ghosts there. One</B>
<BR><B>in Peticular Like to joke around. He was the old</B>
<BR><B>brother of a lady named mrs. eberly. Well one time my</B>
<BR><B>parents decied to seperate my sister and I from rooms.</B>
<BR><B>well I slept in the old mans room and when I awoke the</B>
<BR><B>next morning tacts had been spread all over the floor</B>
<BR><B>and I stepped on them. The room was very cold at night</B>
<BR><B>and the it wassnt drafty cold. It was cold like</B>
<BR><B>something was there. It was next to the attic which</B>
<BR><B>always had mouns of sorts comming out of it. That</B>
<BR><B>house was truely creepy.</B>
<BR><B>My second storie comes from when I was 16. Recently in</B>
<BR><B>the year my mom and moms boyfriend and family moved to</B>
<BR><B>a house on a farm. In the beginning I became really</B>
<BR><B>sick and thought I was going to die. One night</B>
<BR><B>something walked up my stairs as I was delirous(but I</B>
<BR><B>remember vivtly) and told me I was going to be ok. It</B>
<BR><B>sounded like my mom but what happen was my mom was</B>
<BR><B>asleep. Nothing can explain the voice telling me I</B>
<BR><B>will be alright.&nbsp; But Later that year I was starting</B>
<BR><B>to be haunted by a figure of a man in black. He would</B>
<BR><B>stand in front of my door at night and look at me.</B>
<BR><B>Sometimes would walk to my bed. It was taking a big</B>
<BR><B>toll on me and my friend didnt belive me.&nbsp; My parents</B>
<BR><B>no one. Well My sister believed me cause she felt the</B>
<BR><B>eary feeling at night. We both would suffer constently</B>
<BR><B>from nightmeres of people dieing. So one day I just</B>
<BR><B>said(whatever you are please leave us along and go to</B>
<BR><B>the light). for some reason it left us alone since</B>
<BR><B>than but my family moved shortly after that.</B>

<P><B>Ghost Friend</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: blondechicktaken@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi my name is Lynia and for as long as I can remember I've had this
friend that was a ghost.&nbsp; I have talked to her many of times but as
I get older her vists seem to decrease gradually.&nbsp; The first time
I've encountered her was when I was in Kendergarden and I was attacked
by something another spirit and she came to help me.&nbsp; I sat up quickly
and looked around they were gone.&nbsp; That night I got up to go to the
bathroom and I noticed a little girl sitting on the ground watching me.&nbsp;
At first I thought it was my sister but the next night it happened it again.&nbsp;
I turned around and walked back to my room and looked in my little sister's
bed she was there!&nbsp; I walked back out and Maryann was still there.&nbsp;
I walked over to her and knelt down beside her and asked her name. She
said maryann which was my grandma's name.&nbsp; I kept this a secret for
years until she started moving things and my mom wanted to no what was
going on.&nbsp; That's when I told her about maryann and she said it's
my imagination, but if it were my imagination then how could Sara (my little
sister) see her too.&nbsp; Now I have encountered many other ghosts too.&nbsp;
My sister and I were lying in bed when she started cring.&nbsp; I asked
her what's wrong she said there is somebody in the closet.&nbsp; I looked
and there was!&nbsp; I told her to just shut her eyes and that God would
protect her.&nbsp; I thought to myself&nbsp; how can she see them too?&nbsp;
I've always wondered how can she see them, then I realized it is real there
are ghost!&nbsp; I am now in 9th grade and 14 years old.&nbsp; I rarely
see them nemore, but once in a while I see her.&nbsp; This is my story
of my encouter.</B>

<BR><B>Historical Landmark Haunting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: JaniceSaysYes@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>This Historical Landmark is a residence in the Central Valley of
California.</B>
<BR><B>Modesto, CA.&nbsp; Half of the house was built in the late 1800's
and still stands</B>
<BR><B>and is occupied by the current home owners.&nbsp; The exact physical
address is</B>
<BR><B>7525 Crows landing Road.&nbsp; The home has been recognized by the
state as a</B>
<BR><B>Landmark.&nbsp; I would like to mention before I tell the story
of what I have to</B>
<BR><B>report, I am the Grand Daughter of the previous Owner my grand parents
whom</B>
<BR><B>owned the property for more than 40 years before selling it in 1995.</B>
<BR><B>As we call it the Crow's Hauntings specifically because of the area
is a home</B>
<BR><B>of many spirits.&nbsp; We have a history of the home and whom is
haunting the</B>
<BR><B>house and property.&nbsp; One ghost was a previous home owner also.&nbsp;
He is a male</B>
<BR><B>named Joesepi.&nbsp; He was Italian in decent and from what my grand
Mother told</B>
<BR><B>me he hung himself in the Dairy shed.&nbsp; There have been many
eye witness's to</B>
<BR><B>seeing him.&nbsp; He is very protective of the house and property.&nbsp;
He can be</B>
<BR><B>seen wondering the property with a flash light in the middle of
the night,</B>
<BR><B>making sure of&nbsp; no tress passers.&nbsp; If you follow him,
he will eventually go</B>
<BR><B>to the pump shed and disappear.&nbsp; He can be seen in the house
in the sewing</B>
<BR><B>room from time to time.&nbsp; If you dare speak in disbelief of
his presence he</B>
<BR><B>has been known to make a believer out of you.&nbsp; An example would
be a group of</B>
<BR><B>people sitting around in the livingroom enjoying company and an
orange lifted</B>
<BR><B>from the fruit bowl and floated across the room as everyone watched
in</B>
<BR><B>disbelief.&nbsp; The Orange was dropped in the lap of the person
who did not</B>
<BR><B>believe.&nbsp; A door was once taken off it's hinges and fell on
a person making</B>
<BR><B>fun of the ghost stories.&nbsp; You can often hear foot steps and
whistling in the</B>
<BR><B>house.&nbsp; My grandmother would be sitting in a chair and a piece
of jewlery</B>
<BR><B>would sometimes fall into her lap from out of the air. She always
thought of</B>
<BR><B>them as gifts.</B>
<BR><B>Another known spirit on the property was another male known as Joe.&nbsp;
Joe was</B>
<BR><B>known for playing pranks and as I was told being more aggressive.&nbsp;
Reports of</B>
<BR><B>LOUD footsteps, individuals hair being pulled, beds being kicked
and people</B>
<BR><B>being touched by hands and no one is there.&nbsp; He is also known
for voice</B>
<BR><B>projection.&nbsp; If chosen he would speak to you, this often would
scare that</B>
<BR><B>individual.&nbsp; He likes to wake you up from a sound sleep while
yelling in your</B>
<BR><B>ear.&nbsp; No one is sure of his origin or relation to the house
or property.</B>
<BR><B>Another spirit on the property is one of an Elderly lady.&nbsp;
You never really</B>
<BR><B>see her, but you hear her.&nbsp;&nbsp; If leaving the house you
can often her her say,</B>
<BR><B>tootles in a sweet gentle voice.&nbsp; Once again no one knows her
name nor Origin.</B>
<BR><B>A lot of unexplained things have happened in this house and things,
objects</B>
<BR><B>will be moved.&nbsp; Chairs, lamps misc., items will glide from
one place to</B>
<BR><B>another.&nbsp; You can turn on a light and go sit down and it will
turn off.</B>
<BR><B>You can get up and turn the light on and as soon as you sit once
again the</B>
<BR><B>light will turn off.&nbsp; Every night at a certain time the Television
will turn</B>
<BR><B>off as if someone is saying it is late and it is your bed time.&nbsp;
My</B>
<BR><B>grandmother you see was very old fashioned and went to bed at 8:00
in the</B>
<BR><B>morning and would awake at 4:00am in the morning to start her farmers
day.</B>
<BR><B>It was as if someone was telling her it was her bedtime.</B>

<P><B>Historical Society</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ladam@fast.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello, While surfing the web I stumbled upon your site and decided
to check it out. I found it quite interesting, and although I am a nonbeliever
of this sort of thing, I have an interesting experience that I would like
to share with you. After browsing through your "haunted places" section
I read something that literally made the hair stand up on the back of my
neck! I am a house painter by trade and several years ago I was asked by
the Kutztown Historical Society in Kutztown Pa. to give an estimate on
refurbishing the inside stairway and upper hall of the old Junior High
School annex building, a place where I had gone to school in the 70's.
This building (now owned by the historical society) stood across the street
from the old Junior High that was demolished several years ago. After winning
the bid, I started work in the fall just in time for Halloween. I had been
aware of the crazy stories about the place and being in there alone really
didn't bother me even though most of the work was done at night. The caretaker
advised me to be careful not to bump the doors which separated the stairway
from the upper and lower hallways leading to the rooms. They were locked
and the alarm would sound sending Police and Fire Rescue to the scene resulting
in a very embarressing moment!&nbsp; The hallway on the the other side
of the locked doors was pitch black with the exception of the small red
lights on the alarm system. Having access to the upper stairway area, lower
entrance area and of course the stairway, alot of&nbsp; work was ahead
of me.&nbsp; The job was long and tedious and took well over two months
to complete. Late one night I was painting the corner at the upper part
of the stairs when I heard a loud bump. I ignored it and kept working.
After a short while I heard what sounded like someone walking up the steps
(literally!). This I couldn't ignore and after becoming concerned I quickly
turned down the radio, after all, no one was supposed to be in there except
me. I stood up and yelled "hello anybody here.'' I could not see down the
staircase completely because it was enclosed by a wooden wall which was
there to add safety and support the ballaster as well. I called out a second
time but got no answer. Thinking it was the caretaker I made my way down
the twisted stairs only realizing then&nbsp; that I may actually encounter
a burgler instead!&nbsp; With a lump in my throat, I looked around the
downstairs entrance only to find no one! I thought that they might have
been scared off by my voice and checked the front doors only to find them
locked from the inside by me! No one ever came in or went out! After nearly
two months I was completely familiar with ALL the noises of that building,
from the heating pipes and creaking wood to the wind rattling the windows.
I know that what I heard was nothing of the sort! Someone or something
WAS walking up those steps! Fortunately I finished the rest of the job
without any other incidents. I did mention it to the caretaker who just
shook his head and laughed!&nbsp; He told me&nbsp; a story about a little
girl that attended school there in the early 1900's and either had an unfortunate
accident&nbsp; or was pushed out of a top window of the building only to
fall to her death.&nbsp; People claim to have seen a light on in the upper
wing and someone walking around!&nbsp; After I saw the Kutztown Historical
Society on your list, I just had to relay this story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Sherry_Wall@apl.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I live in Greensboro, NC.&nbsp; I am 49 years old and have always
had some kind</B>
<BR><B>of spirits around me, even as a child.&nbsp; Both of my grandmothers,
from Mother</B>
<BR><B>and Daddy's side had an extra sense about them when it came to "feelings",</B>
<BR><B>spirits and sightings.</B>
<BR><B>I presently have a young girl in my house.&nbsp; She never shows
her face, just</B>
<BR><B>holds her head down with long blonde curly hair.&nbsp; Has on a
small flowered</B>
<BR><B>print dress (looks to be an old country print).&nbsp; She has a
large black dog</B>
<BR><B>with her, that is always sitting very erect beside of her.&nbsp;
I only see her</B>
<BR><B>in my bedroom and bathroom.&nbsp; My husband has seen her once.&nbsp;
I have seen her</B>
<BR><B>on several occasions.&nbsp; I recently painted my bedroom and there
seems to be</B>
<BR><B>some kind of disturbance of sort.&nbsp; Every time I lay down and
just fall off</B>
<BR><B>to sleep, I get woke up by a knocking.&nbsp; I have been to the
door, the windows</B>
<BR><B>and never anything.&nbsp; Scared me at first, but I am wondering
if she just</B>
<BR><B>isn't happy with this new color.&nbsp; It is a sea mist blue.&nbsp;
I have talked with</B>
<BR><B>her before and there was along lapse in time before I noticed her
again.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>have been in the house for 15 years.&nbsp; The property it is on
has not been</B>
<BR><B>lived on in over 70 years.&nbsp; I don't know what has caused her
to be here, but</B>
<BR><B>I just thought I would share this note with you.&nbsp; There is
also a man, in</B>
<BR><B>bandages, from head to foot.&nbsp; Clean bandages, like just changed.&nbsp;
He is not</B>
<BR><B>a solid imagine like the girl and dog.&nbsp; You can see through
him.&nbsp; I actually</B>
<BR><B>have only seen him once.&nbsp; But I know the little girl is around.&nbsp;
My family</B>
<BR><B>is pretty freaked out over the entire thing.&nbsp; Even though,
they know I have</B>
<BR><B>a history of happenings throughout my life.</B>

<P><B>I Couldn't Help</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: fireball99@bigpond.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is only one of stories but it's the one I'll never forget.</B>
<BR><B>Sometime at the beginning of the year I had a visitor. My mum had
passed away when I was young and I always had this feeling of her being
around.&nbsp;&nbsp; But this time it wasn't my mum.&nbsp; Some other family
members use to keep in touch with her and told me of a experience were
mum told them another spirit was trying to hurt her family and I think
I met one.</B>
<BR><B>A friend of mine deep into this stuff and can see spirits and tries
to help them on their way.(this now leading to her young daughter who can
also see them)She told me to see who it was.&nbsp; Big no no.&nbsp; I was
laying in bed and closed my eyes and just asked who it was. This face appeared
in front of me and it looked old with heaps of wrinkles and grey hair.
She looked dead.&nbsp; I rang my friend the next day and told her.&nbsp;
She said it's not a lady but a man but I knew what I saw and it was a old
dead lady. She told me that I wasn't alone and the spirit was with me while
I was talking to her(bad I was at work phoning her)&nbsp; I tried to tell
the spirit that I was sorry and couldn't help it. For some reason over
the next couple of days I became really tired and was fighting with my
fianc&eacute; nearly every minute. Then one day my friends daughter came
over to stay the night and was sitting in the lounge room watching a show
and came out crying and just cuddled me. At this point I was scared and
asked what was wrong and she said the spirit was in the lounge room and
she described it word for word of what I had seen.&nbsp; That's when I
hit the roof I told it to bug off and leave me alone,my fianc&eacute; was
out and I wasn't staying there by myself. I packed up our half cooked dinner
and grabbed my keys and left,but as I was going out I kept getting these
stabbing sensations in my lower back. I jumped in the car and took off
looking back at the house warning it not to mess with me while I was driving
and it could have the house.&nbsp; I got to my friends place and ten minutes
after arriving my friend said thanks because it had followed me.&nbsp;
(I don't know if ghosts can do this but please let me know if they can)
I slept there that night and went home in the morning.&nbsp; A couple of
days later I was in a really hot shower and the cubical got a really cold
chill through it and I knew I wasn't alone. I told her I had a friend that
could help and she didn't like that.&nbsp; The shower door went bang as
if someone had hit it and my fianc&eacute; came in asked if I was alright.
I told him what happened.&nbsp; The next day my friend rang and told me
she had a visitor that night in her daughters room. She woke up to a banging
noise and found her daughters bed shaking with a guy standing at the end
doing it.&nbsp; He saw her and followed her back to her room and she does
what she does and said she got rid of him.&nbsp; The way he went told her
that he wasn't nice.&nbsp; She also thinks that because she knew what she
was doing it showed itself to her as a man.(Is this also possible) She
came around and did her bit around the house to get rid of the bad vibes
and she reckons because we changed the dinning room around it must have
opened something.&nbsp; She told me she got a bad sense from it and that
it wasn't a flowing rhythm. After the spirit left the little girl got visitors
all day from my dead family members thanking her for helping me. Even my
mum came and said thankyou and she described my mum to a tee. We figured
out it showed itself to me as a women because of my mum. I was sorry I
couldn't help but there was no reason for&nbsp; it to get mean. So now
the dinning room is back to it's old self and I know sleep with rosemary
beads tied to the end of my bed. And if I feel anything again I'm just
going to assume that it's my mother.</B>

<P><B>I Got One For You</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: spider3153@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>It happened at a Circut city when i was little around 7 years old
i am 19 now. The city is woodbridge va. Well my parents needed a new refridgerator
at the time our old one broke down and we went shopping. Well This is where
thr fun began. We were running throughout the store like little kids do.
The all of a sudden i see a black figure out of the corner of my eye. I
turned to get a better view of it. It was a odd black haze that was kind
of transparent. What i could identify was that it was wearing some type
of long brimmed hat. All was black as i could see. Right as i stared at
it, it vanished. It throughly freaked me out and i ran to my parents. My
sister didn't see it because she kept running around the store thinking
i was in chase. Since then i have throughly believed in ghosts and looked
into that kind of stuff and found people have had similar sighting there.
Even a ghost hunters society looked the place over. I have told my friends
and such but not my sister. The thought of ghosts freaks her out.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I Have had Paranormal Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: shelly4@citlink.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello my name is Vince&nbsp; and Im 17 years old.The experiances
ive had was when my family and I moved to our new house in Bullhead City,
AZ.The first and only 1 I had was when my parents and I were talking when
we happened to see in the corner of the room a record slide off the record
player,spin a couple of times and then fall straight down on the floor.Another
one happened when my mom woke up and saw a man with a pillow over his head
and had his arms crossed over it.She thought it was her husband so she
got up and headed towards the restroom in the hallway.When she gets there
my dad opens the door.My mom than told me she ran in the room to see who
was there and the figure was gone.My mom experianced another one when she
was watching t.v.In the corner of her eye in the hallway she seen a little
girl in a white dress smile and giggle at her than run away out of sight.My
parents used to have BBQs in the backyard when a couple of times they used
to see shadowy figures staring at them threw the kitchen window.After it
kept happening my parents told our neighbor about it and he looked so scared.He
than told us hes had experiances also.One time he said he was in his bed
when he felt like someone was trying to pull him off the bed.We later moved
to Golden Valley AZ.My grandpa lives there with his wife now.He never believed
in what we told him that has happened there.Until recently it started up
again.His wife kept hearing the door knob keep rattling like if someones
trying to get in,but when she looked out the window nothing was there and
it suddenly just stops.The most recent one happened about a month ago.When
he said they were watching t.v. in the room when they started to hear chimes
(the wind chimes) in the background.When they went to see where it was
coming from they found out it was coming from an empty corner in the room.Nothing
at all was there.All what I have said is 100% true.I tried to forget it
never happened,but its started again.So I know now it wasent just when
we moved in.My parents told a historian about our property when he said
it used to be a swamp and indians inhabited the area.A bureal ground really.I
totally believe in ghosts and other paranormal things.Just thought Id tell
you people about it.Not a lot of people really believe us.Oh,and I apologize
in the writing errors I made.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I Have Two Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bwest@cnu.edu</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Brittany&nbsp; and i have two stories that have happened
to me</B>
<BR><B>within the past few years.&nbsp; to begin with, i live near colonial
williamsburg,</B>
<BR><B>on the chickahominy river.&nbsp; my mother, who has lived in virginia
all of her</B>
<BR><B>life, has told me that the land we lived on was once an indian settlement.&nbsp;
i</B>
<BR><B>myself, since a very young age, have always been able to see orbs
(the</B>
<BR><B>presence of a spirit) and am very sensitive to others state of mind.&nbsp;
now that</B>
<BR><B>i have let this be known i will tell my stories</B>
<BR><B>1-when i was 15, my friend courtney and i decided to see if we could
"contact</B>
<BR><B>spirits" because we were bored and had just finished watching blair
witch</B>
<BR><B>project.&nbsp; we made a wiggi (i don't know how to spell that)
board ourselves and</B>
<BR><B>sat in my dining room.&nbsp; we were only kidding around at first,
but when my</B>
<BR><B>parents left, we got more serious.&nbsp; we weren't asking questions
about who we</B>
<BR><B>were going to marry or anything like that, we were trying to get
the history</B>
<BR><B>of the land my house is on.&nbsp; i wanted to know why i always
saw orbs in one</B>
<BR><B>particular spot in the house and why a dark shadow was always in
my room</B>
<BR><B>(which also leaves my room at the constant temp of 64 no matter
what time of</B>
<BR><B>year)&nbsp; i thought she was moving the pointer across the board
and i asked for</B>
<BR><B>proof that we were really communicating with a spirit.&nbsp; i got
really cold as</B>
<BR><B>we continued to ask for proof and i was becoming unsettled.&nbsp;
finally, to try</B>
<BR><B>and break the tension. i looked over courtney's shoulder into the
kitchen and</B>
<BR><B>i saw the figure of a man looking at us.&nbsp; again, by this time
both of my</B>
<BR><B>parents had left and it was just courtney and i in the house.&nbsp;
he was dressed</B>
<BR><B>in what appeared to be militia attire and was carrying a musket.&nbsp;
i kicked</B>
<BR><B>courtney under the table and lifted my fingers off of the pointer,
as i did</B>
<BR><B>this he turned away and dissapeared.&nbsp; we both heard his footsteps
leaving the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen, although courtney did not see him.</B>
<BR><B>2-the following summer, when i was 16, courtney and i were sitting
in my</B>
<BR><B>living room watching a movie that for some reason had us scared.&nbsp;
it was close</B>
<BR><B>to one in the morning and my house was completely dark.&nbsp; no
lights were coming</B>
<BR><B>in off the street considering that my house, at that time, was only
one of</B>
<BR><B>three other houses on the street, all spaced several hundred yards
apart and</B>
<BR><B>their were no street lights.&nbsp; as the movie came to an end,
a light came out of</B>
<BR><B>my parents bedroom (they were not home, but across the neighborhood
at a</B>
<BR><B>party) traveled through the living room and out the kitchen.&nbsp;
the light was</B>
<BR><B>bright enough to throw the entire living room into light and was
gone within a</B>
<BR><B>few seconds.&nbsp; my dog had followed the light from my parents
bedroom and out</B>
<BR><B>through the kitchen so we knew we hadn't imagined it.&nbsp; i asked
courtney's</B>
<BR><B>mother, who studies paranormal activity, what may have happened
and she said</B>
<BR><B>because courtney and i have a strong psychic connection and because
we had</B>
<BR><B>MADE the wiggi board, not bought it, we had allowed spirtits to
enter my</B>
<BR><B>house.&nbsp; they had yet to leave considering we did not close
the wiggi board and</B>
<BR><B>when courtney and i were together they would make their presence
known.&nbsp; to</B>
<BR><B>this day, i am now 19, i still see apparitions in my house.&nbsp;
the strongest one</B>
<BR><B>being a set of red eyes in my kitchen late one night.&nbsp; i know
i did not just</B>
<BR><B>create the eyes in my mind because their are no red lights in my
kitchen and</B>
<BR><B>because i was physically afraid to walk near the kitchen the day
before and</B>
<BR><B>following the incident.&nbsp; so, for who ever reads this, do not
create your own</B>
<BR><B>wiggi board, it is a welcoming mat for any spirit that wants to
enter your</B>
<BR><B>house, and it is best to leave things alone.</B>

<P><B>The End Table</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: marie70_@excite.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, I just thought I'd share one
of my many stories with you. It starts with an end table my parents received
from my uncle. My uncle used to fix up run down shacks to make them beautiful
houses and then rent them out. One of these shacks on his property had
this handmade end-table still in it, left there by the man that had carved
it. My mom loved it so we took it home and it went in my parents bedroom.
I was still young, maybe 12 or 13 (I am now 22---to give you a rough estimate
of when this all occurred) so I didn't hear anything about what was happening
until I experienced it for myself. I remember sitting in my parents bedroom
watching tv with my father while my mom was away at college. Suddenly we
heard a loud bang coming from the attic. (I must point out here how peculiar
it is that a lot of ghost activity seems to start with noises from the
attic. For instance even the movie Exed the strongest sweet fresh tobacco
smell right under his nose. No one smoked in the house. His body ran cold
with chills knowingorgeous and she didn't want to trash it because of some
silly occurrences that her daughters and husband said was a ghost! That
was ridiculous! The time came though that it would scare her too much.
She went into her room to get something out of the drawer in the small
end-table. Horrifically the drawer was pulling back like it did not want
to be opened. My mom started to cry and yelled at my ada to get "that thing"
out of her house! I remember my dad being relieved and setting it outside.
The next morning I remember looking at the table outside and I noticed
a small puddle of blue goo on top of the thing. I joked "Look he's crying!"
not knowing what it could be. We put it in our shed to sit for years. One
night my sister made the mistake of leaving the shed doors open at night
and her bedroom windows. She later told us that an orb came in her window
at night and frantically bounceess right there within your home. http://www.kabbalah.com

<P><B>I Live in a Haunted House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: india@csuol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>i live in brownstown ill. and my house it very haunted. we have activity
on more nights than not.</B>
<BR><B>our street is haunted by this same ghost, the locals call it the
poplar st reet ghost. we moved here 3 years ago and began renovating the
house. there were a lot of accidents during the renovation, and also it
was disclosed to us when we bought the house as haunted.</B>
<BR><B>supposedly while digging the basement to this house a local man
fell in the hole and died. he was not discovered until the concrete had
set, and they had to then chisel him out of the concrete.[ known to be
a drunk it was assumed that he just left early to tie one on and they did
not find him till the weekend was over and he didn't show up on monday][&nbsp;&nbsp;
now we have been told by an elderly man that his whole body was not removed,
supposedly there are still parts deep under our basement. this man claims
that his father worked on the crew in 1911 when the foundation was poured.</B>
<BR><B>the death is common knowledge here however no one is for sure about
parts still being in the basement.</B>
<BR><B>doors open and close by themselves, objects move, we hear banging
and loud crashes at night, sometimes you can hear a faint cry for help.
water pipes bust all the time. [ we upgraded to all new plumbing to the
tune of 7,000.00 and we still get a broken pipe in the night, a few times
a year]</B>
<BR><B>sometimes when we are gone the neighbors tell us that they have
seen an old man in the window, i and my husband have seen him ourselves,
once in the kitchen and once in the hallway.&nbsp; when he is here the
house smells of cigar smoke.</B>
<BR><B>many nights we are awakened by all the lights being turned on in
the house. i guess i should add that we have no children and we live alone
just the two of&nbsp; us in this big old spooky house.</B>
<BR><B>also we have had 2 seperate heating and cooling companies out here
to check the thermostats, the heat can be set on 80 degrees all the doors
and windows closed and you still are freezing. sometimes you can see your
breath in here.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I Want to See a Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: zenabi@cox.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Hi my name is Justin and I have some things to tell you about a perticular
room in my grandparents house. First off let me say that many people in
my family have seen ghosts but I am not one of them yet. But some strange
stuff has happened to me. To start off let me tell you some background
info on this room.</B>
<BR><B>When my mother was a little girl she woke up to see an old man with
white hair in a blue suit sitting in a wheel chair staring at her beside
her bed. She was frightened and tried to scream for my grandmother but
couldn't get anything out. She closed her eyes and opened them and he was
still there. Finally a scream came out and my grandmother ran in and the
man dissappeared.</B>
<BR><B>My grandparents tried to tell her it was all in her mind but then
my Aunt who is my moms older sister told her that when she stayed in that
room she also saw the same man but he was not in a wheelchair. He came
in and bent down to check on the furnace in the room. When she realized
it wasn't my grandfather she screamed and my grandparents ran in and also
told her it was in her mind and not to tell my mom because she would get
scared.</B>
<BR><B>Well years had passed and my mother had me at a young age and was
working through college so we stayed at my grandparents for some time until
mom got her degree in nursing. I slept in that room on a bunk bed (the
top bunk).</B>
<BR><B>I was just a few years old but I remember this very clearly. After
watching some of a scary movie I was told to go to bed. I heard really
loud breathing in the dark room as I lay there trying to sleep. It sounded
asi if it were right there with me so I screamed and my mom and grandparents
automatically dismissed it because of the scary movie. But I remember what
I heard.</B>
<BR><B>Another strang thinge was I used to have this recurring dream. I
had it so many times I lost count. For awhile I had it consecutively each
night. I would fall out of my bed on the end where the ladder was. Except
in the dream I would fall very slowly and spin and spin until finally after
what seemd like a couple minutes of spinning while falling I would wake
up. The weird part is that each time this happened I would wake up on the
floor in the exact position that I would've landed in my dream. I got so
used to it that I would just wake up and crawl back up the ladder and go
to sleep. By the way I wasn't known to sleepwalk until later years and
even then it was very rare when I did.</B>
<BR><B>Finally the strangest thing. I stayed with my grandparents when
I was older before enisting in the Air Force. I was about 20 or so. I stayed
in that room again. One night as I was falling asleep the bed shook violently
as if something was trying to wake me up. I jumped up and right when I
did it stopped, however as I awoke quickly I had just a second to realize
it did REALLY happen! When I realized this a flood of memories of this
occurance happening all my life came back to me. It seems as though it
happened alot but I was so far into sleep I dismissed it as a dream until
this time. Now I realized that something was trying to get my attention.
Now that I realized it really was happening however it hasn't happened
since.</B>
<BR><B>I hear things all the time that I really can't explain but I've
yet to see an apparition. I get that corner of your eye thing alot though.
Sometimes for a split second I've seen stuff in the mirror but nothing
to actually say I've seen a ghost. I'm very interested in the subject and
even though it would probably scare me I think I would like to see one
at least once. If possible even try to help them move on. Well thank you
for your time.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Wasn't Normal</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: andmyhomeshalbe@yahoo.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I was 14 when this happened and it has changed my life ever since.
Our family had moved to Massachusetts, and I didn't like it from the start.
The house that my parents had moved into was at least one hundred years
old. AT-LEAST. This house had bad vibes thought the whole thing...Except
for this one room as I can recall. One guest bedroom was.....fine, I guess.
But how could you define fine in a haunted house? The bedroom was an odd
sort of fine. To fine. It seemed to be watching you. All of the guests
that we had left at least one night after sleeping in the room.( no lie
)</B>
<BR><B>On one night my parents had gone out to dinner and I was left with
my brother,&nbsp; who shared the same room with me. It was a small room
though. But enough for two of us. Kind of like a dorm. One night as we
played in our room talking we noticed a clanging in the guest bed room.
An odd clanging. Sort of like a faint screaming with a continued shattering
glass sound. It was just enough to be heard. I leaned over the edge of
my bed and looked out of the door and down to the guest bedroom. I saw
nothing. The door to the bedroom was wide open and as far as I could see,
there was nothing in the room. So, I got out of bed scared; in a frusterated
way and headed down the hall to the bedroom, but slowed my pace about three
feet from the doorway. As I got closser, I felt a pressure on my face.
Not much but a pressure none the less. I dissmised it as my, being nurvis
and headed on. I poked my head into the room. The sound stoped. I was puzzled.
I had no clue as to what I should think. I walked in about two g. As he
got closser I could feel the feeling of someone breathing on my neck. I
screemed then and with my screem, came the opening of the door. My brother
was on the other side. He didnt know what to think, but I did. I knew that
i was never going to step foot inside that room again. A few months later
my dad got a buisness offer in Rhode Island and took it. We moved out in
the next week. I never did know what to make of that house, and to be quite
honest, I never really wanted to find out. As I heard though, the newest
occupants had a doughter, and from the seconed week that they had moved
in, she had an incounter with " ...something " as the father put it. And
was never seen again. The dismised it as a kidnaping. This event that happened
to me changed my life. I never found out who that lady was though. I am
now sixteen years old and live in New York. I would apreciate it if you
included this story on your web page.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>In My Dreams</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Jasonshoney04@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I am not sure whether or not these “experiences” of mine are actually
considered “sitings”. I used to live in a house where the basement was
finished and my sister and I used to have our “play room” in the basement.
Any ways we also had a tv room in our basement and because my parents used
the tv upstairs to watch their shows I was often times stuck watching television
down stairs. I am very much of a night person and so I liked to watch tv
late at night in the basement. Well sometimes I would be so tired that
I would fall asleep in front of the television. And this is when these
“visions” came to me. I would be asleep and then, I’m not sure if I was
dreaming or what but in a dream state I would walk over to the door of
the play room and there she would be. She talked to me and was friendly
so I think that’s why I wasn’t afraid of her. she always wore the same
pink flowing dress and was on transparent a little she told me that about
15 years earlier she was killed by her boyfriend in the room that was now
my playroom. She told me he had stabbed her 4 times in her chest and I
could see the marks from it. I asked her what she wanted me to do and she
told me to avenge her death, that the man who killed her was named george
(and its been so long that I’ve forgotten what the last name was). She
asked me to kill him the same way that she had died.</B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I bought my house 6 years ago.&nbsp; There were several things that
happened, and</B>
<BR><B>my friend suggested that there was a "presence", but the incident
that</B>
<BR><B>finally convinced me was this:</B>
<BR><B>The master bedroom has a bathroom off of it.&nbsp; There is a window
in the</B>
<BR><B>bathroom, but it was closed (it was winter).&nbsp; The bathroom
door is perfectly</B>
<BR><B>hung - it does not move on it's own.&nbsp; I was lying in bed, and
the bathroom</B>
<BR><B>door bumped very firmly against the bathtub 3 times, and then closed
1/2</B>
<BR><B>way,&nbsp;&nbsp; It was chilling at first, but almost seemed like
a prank.</B>
<BR><B>I have also had my kitchen clock set forward exactly 2 hours on
3 separate</B>
<BR><B>occasions while I was away for the weekend.&nbsp; I had 2 ammo boxes
stacked on</B>
<BR><B>top of each other in the closet.&nbsp; Those things are heavy -
and one fell off</B>
<BR><B>the top of the other.&nbsp; My friend was brushing his teeth , and
he felt a hand</B>
<BR><B>touch him lightly on the back.&nbsp; He thought it was me, but I
was in another</B>
<BR><B>part of the house.&nbsp; And, of course there have been numerous
unexplainable</B>
<BR><B>noises.</B>
<BR><B>30 years ago, there was a mid-air collision between a passenger
jet and a</B>
<BR><B>private airplane.&nbsp; It was about 1 1/2 miles from here.&nbsp;
Over 100 people were</B>
<BR><B>killed.&nbsp; I live in a sub-division, but my lot is heavily wooded.&nbsp;
My</B>
<BR><B>daughter found a human tooth - a molar - in the woods.&nbsp; We
speculate that my</B>
<BR><B>"presence" came from the airplane crash.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Little Girl and Other Visitors</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: OCONNEK@uk.ibm.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Heres my story one of many, all true</B>
<BR><B>During my youth in the 1980s I lived with my parents in a large
gate house</B>
<BR><B>in Ireland. The house over the years had been added to and as a
result</B>
<BR><B>different parts of the house had different building techniques i.e.
the new</B>
<BR><B>bits where very new. There where many ghosts and many types of ghosts
in</B>
<BR><B>the house and gardens.</B>
<BR><B>Ghost 1</B>
<BR><B>My favorite was a little girl of about 7-8 years old. When I was
getting</B>
<BR><B>dressed or brushing my hair or tidying up she would watch me. I
would see</B>
<BR><B>her looking at me from the doorway corner being very timid or behind
me in</B>
<BR><B>the mirror I would always smile at her and sometimes say hello.</B>
<BR><B>The downside was the lack of sleep. Anyone who has lived in a haunted
house</B>
<BR><B>knows that insomnia is a side effect not from fear but almost as
if I was a</B>
<BR><B>battery that need to be active so they could be.</B>
<BR><B>To describe my ghost she was 31/2 foot tall with blond hair in plaits
very</B>
<BR><B>pretty wearing a pink knee high short sleeved dress, white knee
high socks</B>
<BR><B>pulled up and black shiny shoes. She enjoyed playing tricks pulling
the</B>
<BR><B>blankets off in the middle of the night normally at 3 am, or moving
things.</B>
<BR><B>When I moved to the UK at 17 by myself I talked to my Mum and Dad
on a</B>
<BR><B>regular basis and I enjoyed living here so much they decided to
give it a</B>
<BR><B>try. When they where selling the house a viewer was looking around
(Normal)</B>
<BR><B>When she had finished she casually said to my Mum that her daughter
was</B>
<BR><B>crying and siting in the bedroom next to the bathroom (my old room).
My mum</B>
<BR><B>was a little bit worried and ask the lady to describe the girl.
The</B>
<BR><B>description was the little girl I always saw. My mum never believed
me and</B>
<BR><B>thought perhaps one of my sisters had returned early from school.
Once the</B>
<BR><B>visitor left she searched the house no one was there. My Mum got
a little</B>
<BR><B>bit freaked and rang me to tell me what had happened. Since then
she has</B>
<BR><B>believed in ghosts.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ghost 2</B>
<BR><B>Funny but very annoying -&nbsp; This ghost loved to torment my Dad
by moving</B>
<BR><B>things. Cups of Coffee would disappear and the cup would turn up
later the</B>
<BR><B>oddest places once we found a cup in the oven. One day it moved
some money</B>
<BR><B>my Dad had left on the side. My dad started the normal over reaction</B>
<BR><B>blaming me and two of my sisters. He tried all the normal tricks
yelling</B>
<BR><B>grounding no TV but no one would admit they took the money. He marched
us</B>
<BR><B>all into our front room. The Front room/ TV Room was separated from
the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen by a clear glass door. We all sat in silence then my dad
started</B>
<BR><B>shouting again and said well if you did not do it then the ghost
did. As he</B>
<BR><B>finished the kitchen door slammed shut with such force that the
glass</B>
<BR><B>smashed, no wind or windows open as it was the middle of winter.
Dad kinda</B>
<BR><B>looked worried and peeved at the same time. Worried because this
was the</B>
<BR><B>ghost saying don't take the mick and peeved because it was going
to cost</B>
<BR><B>him money to replace the glass.&nbsp; He open the door which was
jammed shut and</B>
<BR><B>walked into the kitchen, a pint of milk had been left on the side
where my</B>
<BR><B>dad forgot to put it back because he was too busy yelling. The milk
had</B>
<BR><B>gone sour, not just sour but separated into creamy stuff and cloudy
water.</B>
<BR><B>Next to the milk was my Dads money including more than he had lost</B>
<BR><B>obviously ghost thought he better return all of it to make his point.
I got</B>
<BR><B>blamed for the door when I lost the tossing of a coin we could not
tell my</B>
<BR><B>Mum the truth as she did not believe in ghosts no matter what she
saw</B>
<BR><B>someone had to be blamed.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ghost 3 or Memory</B>
<BR><B>Ten year old boy in a white shirt, Grey shorts white socks around
his</B>
<BR><B>ankles with Dark hair would regularly run from the corner of the
house</B>
<BR><B>(outside) to the end and disappear.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ghost 4</B>
<BR><B>The one I really hated and he scared me- Tall dark man with laughing
eyes.</B>
<BR><B>I did not often see this ghost I often felt his presence the only
way to</B>
<BR><B>describe that awful feeling was like standing on the sea shore and
being</B>
<BR><B>hit with the incoming waves. The hate anger and general evil would
hit you</B>
<BR><B>like a wave getting stronger and stronger until you wanted to run.
I would</B>
<BR><B>feel terrified for ages after this happened and the other ghosts
would be</B>
<BR><B>very quiet almost like they where afraid of it as well. He lived
in the</B>
<BR><B>center of the house. That part of the house was built during the
Irish</B>
<BR><B>Famine the walls where 4-5 feet thick made from stone and sandy
mortar. He</B>
<BR><B>would stand in my parents bedroom doorway he was at least six feet
tall</B>
<BR><B>with big black boots high wasted trousers and a torn ragged shirt</B>
<BR><B>everything seemed dirty like he was covered in soot, His face was
the thing</B>
<BR><B>that terrified me. He laughed but not with his mouth, his eyes would
dance</B>
<BR><B>in his head while his mouth remained solemn. The longest time I
looked at</B>
<BR><B>him was when I was stuck in place with terror no matter what I tried
my</B>
<BR><B>feet would not obey me. On this occasion he pointed to the floor
at his</B>
<BR><B>feet, when I looked there was a wedding ring not the modern type.
It was</B>
<BR><B>thin and the sides uneven but it glinted. As I looked the floor
started</B>
<BR><B>getting dark at this point my feet did move and I ran like the devil
was</B>
<BR><B>after me. I had no where to go except my bedroom where I got a little</B>
<BR><B>religious book my Nan had given me. I sat up in bed with this tightly
in my</B>
<BR><B>fist all night.</B>
<BR><B>My little sister also saw this ghost she was about 8 years old and
wet</B>
<BR><B>herself which she admitted recently, she said it was the eyes that
had</B>
<BR><B>scared her so much.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ghost 5</B>
<BR><B>Outside ghost - hated this one as well - The outside ghost would
watch you</B>
<BR><B>until you became so unhappy you went inside. We had a lovely big
garden but</B>
<BR><B>we could never sit outside in the summer. I was once so scared by
the</B>
<BR><B>watcher as I and my sisters called him that I once left through
the front</B>
<BR><B>garden gate and walked the circle of the house to get to the back
gate to</B>
<BR><B>lock up. I really did not want to walk through the garden.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Funny story-</B>
<BR><B>One of my Aunts had given me this really horrible clown doll that
you could</B>
<BR><B>wind up and it would play a tune. I was 14 years old at the time
and this</B>
<BR><B>was not the kinda gift you give to someone that age. My friend had
come to</B>
<BR><B>visit she was sitting on my bed doing homework with me, when she
noticed</B>
<BR><B>the clown doll we both said how creepy it was but my aunt was visiting
so</B>
<BR><B>it had to be on show. We got to talking about the ghosts in my house.
She</B>
<BR><B>would not believe me. So the subject was dropped. Then the&nbsp;
clown doll</B>
<BR><B>started to play my friend freaked the doll was on the other side
of the</B>
<BR><B>room and you had to wind it up like a clockwork for it&nbsp; to
work. Next thing</B>
<BR><B>we heard giggles from the doorway. So I says stop playing tricks
little</B>
<BR><B>girl you are scaring Sarah in a kinda laughing voice. Well Sarah
got mad</B>
<BR><B>and scared at the same time because no matter what she went to say
about me</B>
<BR><B>playing a trick on her there was no way she could explain how the
doll was</B>
<BR><B>playing the tune.&nbsp; I think she wanted to run but she did not
want to go</B>
<BR><B>through the doorway. I tried calming her down but I could not stop</B>
<BR><B>laughing. Eventually she left in a strop (an angry Mood for all
those not</B>
<BR><B>English)&nbsp; with me</B>

<P><B>Hi my name is Alyssa and I have a ghost story that is true and I
am wondering if you can put it on your web-site?</B>
<BR><B>One night I was sleeping in my room, and something starteled me
and I sat up. I saw a little girl ghost about the age of 7. She was laughing
and playing in my room and running around in my room. I started to panic
and then I saw her sit on my computer chair. And she started spinning in
it and litterly the chair started spinning around. I screamed and went
into my moms room and slept with her the rest the night.&nbsp; The next
morning I went into my room and there was a paper on my computer table
and it said "Than you" with no signature on it but the pencil laying right
there.</B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>This is not a scary or very fancy story but it is mine.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have a large house in&nbsp; Maine-&nbsp; I use to live there year
round- when I first moved in back in 1976 I use to hear all sorts of noises-
after further investigation - I found out that some of the sounds (&nbsp;
pacing in the room above ) was from a woman named Minnie Coffin who died
tragically&nbsp; trying to put out a chimney fire in 1881-&nbsp; then one
day I heard a woman crying - I felt a great loss - I saw a small built
woman wearing a black skirt, white shirt with a black sweater and wearing
a black kerchief&nbsp; with fringes- the kitchen door opened then closed
( I was alone in the house) realizing what just happened I ran out to the
road thinking that this poor woman lost her way - no one was there. I know
it wasn't Minnie as I still hear her pacing - I would hear someone running
up &amp; down the stairs- these steps belong to children (a brother &amp;
sister )- We all live very well together - when the children get too rambunctious
I tell them to calm down - they listen ( sometimes). There are others in
the house but they are not as strong as Minnie &amp; the kids - I have
not heard the crying woman since - Perhaps she was crying because it was
her time to move on and she was just sad- I will never know-</B>

<P><B>Many Experiences with Ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mblamer@neo.rr.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>growing up in Mansfield Ohio I was born gifted, able to both hear
and see</B>
<BR><B>ghost. I have had many experiences with the supernatural and as
a child I</B>
<BR><B>was deprived of sleep often. there is no peace for the gifted. the
spirits</B>
<BR><B>knew I could see and hear them and they did their best to converse
with me.</B>
<BR><B>my first memory of seeing ghost was before I was even five years
old. but my</B>
<BR><B>most vivid experiences began when I was about seven years old. a
lady ghost</B>
<BR><B>lives at my family home and would appear to me on a regular basis.
she was</B>
<BR><B>dressed in clothing likened to the 16th century wedding dress with
a long</B>
<BR><B>white silk vail.&nbsp; the dress was long and flowing and on occasions
when I</B>
<BR><B>could actually see her face she appeared to be wearing a heavy powered</B>
<BR><B>makeup. her eyes were the blue and more beautiful then any I ever
seen here</B>
<BR><B>on earth. she would walk down the long hallway at night and stand
at the end</B>
<BR><B>of my bed.&nbsp; she would whisper my name.&nbsp; I naturally wanted
nothing to do</B>
<BR><B>with her, and covered up my head acting like I could not see her.&nbsp;
as I grew</B>
<BR><B>older she actually helped me by verbally teaching me things.&nbsp;
she would hum</B>
<BR><B>lullabies and songs that would actually comfort me. she would quote</B>
<BR><B>scriptures from the bible when I was doing things I shouldn't be
doing, and</B>
<BR><B>warned me of dangerous people. she told me once to leave an apartment
where</B>
<BR><B>a sex offender was trying to get his way with me when I was 11.
she even</B>
<BR><B>saved my life once, by calling me out of a metal shower before it
collapsed.</B>
<BR><B>I escaped the accident with a 6 inch cut on my foot verses being
buried in</B>
<BR><B>the mangled metal. my children and six sisters and one brother has
also seen</B>
<BR><B>her. my parents deny having ever seeing her. they use to say we
were crazy,</B>
<BR><B>and that are imaginations were running away with us. she introduced
herself</B>
<BR><B>to all of my family in much the same way, but they were unable to
hear her.</B>
<BR><B>some believe that she was about to be married when something tragic
happened</B>
<BR><B>to her or her significant other.&nbsp; there is no know history
about the house</B>
<BR><B>my parents still live in today, but we have discovered that there
was either</B>
<BR><B>a large spring under the house or an old basement completely filled
with</B>
<BR><B>water now. some people think she was a angel put here to watch over
me. she</B>
<BR><B>also crawls in the bed with people when they spend the night at
my parents.</B>
<BR><B>this is how my husband first met her.&nbsp; the second time he met
her she threw</B>
<BR><B>a plate across the room, because he was laughing at the ghost stories
my</B>
<BR><B>sisters and I were sharing. I have had many other encounters with
ghost as</B>
<BR><B>well some not so nice spirits live in this world with us.&nbsp;
as an adult I</B>
<BR><B>have learned to keep these spirits at bay and my children who are
gifted as</B>
<BR><B>well have learned to not allow them to know that they are aware
of their</B>
<BR><B>presents to prevent the torment some of them can bring. all together
I have</B>
<BR><B>had approximately 50 encounters with the supernatural and I am thankful
to</B>
<BR><B>know about the others.</B>

<BR><B>Creepy Situations</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: rkd_russell@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello, I am not that good of a writer, but here goes.&nbsp; My husband
and I lived in a duplex, in St. Petersburg, Florida, between the years
of June 1988 and August 1992.&nbsp; I was very uncomfortable due to the
strange situations that happened, while we lived there.</B>
<BR><B>1.&nbsp; The first came when we found out that our elderly landlord
had passed away.</B>
<BR><B>2.&nbsp; The landlord of the property next to where we lived, died
in a fishing accident, on Lake Michigan.</B>
<BR><B>3.&nbsp; The old man that lived next to us, was an old drunk, who
lived by himself.&nbsp; He would have cussing, and screaming matches, with
someone (or something).&nbsp; We just thought he was having hallucinations.</B>
<BR><B>4.&nbsp; We never had conversations with the old man, so we never
knew (or cared) what he did.&nbsp; One time he had a "niece" stay with
him.&nbsp; We found out through some friends of ours who had gotten up
early, to go fishing, that the paramedics where in front of the house.&nbsp;
Apparently during the middle of the night the "niece" had taken the old
man's insulin, and over dosed, and died.&nbsp; (We never heard a thing).</B>
<BR><B>5.&nbsp; I had a couple of bad dreams while living there, but only
2 stand out in my mind.&nbsp; One night while we were asleep, I noticed
that the bathroom night lite kept flickering.&nbsp; I looked over to the
hallway, and noticed the black shadow coming through the bedroom door,
walking towards me.&nbsp; I screamed out my husband's name, and the figure
went away.&nbsp; We just chalked it up to a bad nightmare.&nbsp; Another
time, my husband had fallen asleep on the couch, I went to bed, and was
awaken, by what felt like my husband, maybe, putting his hand aside of
my face, yet it wasen't him.&nbsp; I then again thought I was just having
a bad dream.</B>
<BR><B>6.&nbsp; I had a cousin stay with me for a week.&nbsp; One night
she fell asleep on the living room floor.&nbsp; During the middle of the
night she thought she heard something, and "kicked" the couch, (I don't
know why) but when she did that, it slammed the couch into the mirror hanging
on the wall.&nbsp; Thank God the mirror landed sideways, or she would have
been hit.</B>
<BR><B>7.&nbsp; One Christmas Eve, I came home to find a hearse sitting
out front.&nbsp; I walked in to ask my husband what was going on, and he
said that they found the old man dead on the living room floor.&nbsp; He
was there for a couple of days.&nbsp; Apparently he had died from drinking,
diabetes, and the hard way he had lived his life.</B>
<BR><B>8.&nbsp; Maybe not weird, just timing......our pet cockatiel died,
and a week later, our cat died, and the next day, our new neighbors cat
also died.</B>
<BR><B>9.&nbsp; I had a golden retriever.&nbsp; When she was just a pup,
my husband came home from work, and found her almost choked to death.&nbsp;
Her little collar got caught on the foot of a plant stand, and she couldn't
move, it was that tight around her neck.&nbsp; When she got older, she
would stand in the middle of the kitchen and bark up to the ceiling, AT
NOTHING!</B>
<BR><B>Finally we were given the chance to buy a house.&nbsp; When we left,
we left all the creepy situations behind.&nbsp; I have told a few friends
of my years living in that duplex.&nbsp; I even had one co-worker say,
he could see it in my eyes that I was telling the truth.&nbsp; I never
felt that way before, and never felt that way since.</B>

<P><B>Mondu</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>My mom told me this story about 5 years ago but, before I begin,
you need a little back ground. When I was about 5 years old my Grandparents
and my parents decided it was time to move my Mom's old playhouse over
to our house. As a 5 year old, I was pretty excited. It is a cool one room
"kid sized" house with a wrap around porch... everything a little girl
could ever ask for. Well, on moving day when my Grandpa and my Dad and
a few Uncles started to put the house on the trailer to bring it over someone
heard a small meow from underneath. They stopped production, my dad looked
underneath and found a kitten that was about 4 weeks old. Being the persuasive
kids we are, my brothers and I talked my parents into letting us keep her
as our new pet.... Mondu.</B>
<BR><B>Soon, Mondu became a part of our family. However, she always did
what she wanted to do.</B>
<BR><B>Mondu decided that she no longer liked the fact that she had to
user a litter box ( ok... I know it sound like rambling but, it's important!!!)
Anyway, since Mondu didn't want to user her little box, my older brother
taught her to user the toilet. For us kids it was great, all we had to
do was feed her and flush when she was done. However, the only catch was,
when my older brother taught her this "trick" he gave her treats. Now our
house had only one bathroom and Mondu was determined to be the first one
in even if she didn't have to go.&nbsp; So, she developed this habit of
running into the bathroom and jumping on the toilet before the other person
could get in there in anticipation of a treat. ( The treats of course ended
when she started all of this.... obviously she understood the program.)</B>
<BR><B>Well, years past and Mondu got older but, she never gave up on the
fact she had was first to get into the bathroom although she didn't get
a treat. In fact there were times she would have a line of people behind
her waiting for her to finish up.</B>
<BR><B>When I was about 18 years old, Mondu started to get sick. She was
having a hard time breathing and one day when I got home from school I
went into the bathroom, she used all of her strength to get in there before
me to continue her "ritual." Then she climbed on to my bed ( which she
NEVER did) and looked at me and I knew it was time. I called my mom at
work and told her I was taking her to the doctor. I brought her there that
day, my mom, dad and brothers came and we put her down. We all knew it
was the humane thing to do but, we still missed her and everyone was in
a funk.</B>
<BR><B>The next morning ( and this may I mention is coming from my mom
who would not make any of this up and didn't tell me until I was about
23 years old.) my mom went into the bathroom to brush her teeth and get
ready for work. She said when she walked in there Mondu was perched on
the toilet seat as usual, my mom said hi to her, she meowed... jumped off
the toilet and slowly disappeared as she walked towards the bathroom door.
My mom said she could her hear her foot falls fade away.</B>
<BR><B>Till this day, I believe that she is still in the house. Whenever
my Bill cat ( who may I add is about 15 years old - and uses a litter box
and won't leave my dad) starts racing through the house we know Mondu i.e.
the ruler of the roost is there harassing Bill as she did in real life.</B>
<BR><B>We miss her but, the cool part is we know she is still there.</B>

<P><B>Moving Out of Town</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bradandtyra@maysvilleky.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I must have been about 6 because I was in kindergarten when this
happened.&nbsp; We were just beginning to move out of the house we rented
into our very first house.&nbsp; I was asleep in my bedroom in the rented
house, and nothing was in my room except my mattresses and maybe a suitcase.&nbsp;
My room was at the end of the house, across from my parents' and beside
my brother's.&nbsp; I remember waking up in the pitch black of the middle
of the night, and feeling someone in the room with me.&nbsp; My parents
were in bed, and my brother would never come to my room, but someone was
there.&nbsp; I was scared... I was 6!&nbsp; I remember this vividly, I
tried to scream, but nothing came out, and I saw what I now know to be
an orb, a bright white light, then a glowing figure.&nbsp; It didn't touch
me, didn't speak, it just stood there by my bed in front of the window.&nbsp;
I squeezed my eyes shut, and the next time I opened them it was morning.&nbsp;
It never happened again.&nbsp; Ever since, I have been fascinated by the
paranormal, and this is by far the best site on the web!&nbsp; I have learned
so much and hope to be exploring a couple of places here in Maysville,
KY with a couple of people.&nbsp; Thanks so much for designing something
like this, guys!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Erinisthebest01@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Im only 12 so I haven't had many interactions I've only had 2 short
ones:</B>
<BR><B>1st. I was only about 9 when I was asleep in my bed, when I felt
a really hard something, like a finger, tap me on my shoulder, I woke suddenly.
I was sharing a room with my sister, so I looked to see if she was awake,
but then I realised it couldn't have been her because we had bunkbeds,
I looked around to see if one of my cats had done it, but they were not
in the room, or under my bed., I still never found out what it was.</B>
<BR><B>2nd. I was at a friends house, and we were building a really cool
cubby house.</B>
<BR><B>She had a glass swan full of fake flowers on a little cabinet, next
to our cubby, we both walked past it with out touching it, when it fell.
Also I was back at her house siting in her room waiting for her to come
back from the kitchen, when the door open, and something yet again fell,
then the door kind of closed, my friend came back in and I told her about
it, she said it was probably her grandmother that had died a couple of
months ago.</B>

<P><B>I had so many ghost/spirit experiences in the past and I still am
having them. Apparitions come and go from my house, some spirits stay with
me. Some like me, some hate me, and some are afraid of me. Ever since I
was twelve I would see, hear and feel spirits all around me. I hated it.
It was like a nightmare that just wouldn't stop. Finally I just started
to ignore what came and went from my house. It didn't help, since I'd find
myself talking to someone that no one else could see. I would sometimes
draw attention at school from other students and teachers, by screaming
at the top of my longs at someone. I'd end up in detention a lot. My parents
don't believe in spirits. It's just imagination to them.</B>
<BR><B>When I was fifteen, I was at my worst. My mom was sent to a psych
ward at a local hospital for trying to commit suicide by self-mutilating
herself. For two years she was in or out of the hospital. I would be by
myself at home, my older sister would be off with her friends, and my dad
would be visiting my mom.</B>
<BR><B>One night when my dad left for the hospital, I felt totally alone.
I called one of my friends, only to find out that she was babysitting.
I didn't any of my other friends numbers or where they lived.</B>
<BR><B>It happened when I was dozing off, watching Nickelodeon, that I
happened to hear someone come in the house. I walked to my door thinking
it was my dad finally home. I got to the kitchen doorway when I knew that
no one was there. I felt something, no, someone walk right by me, going
right into the dining room to the living room. The first thought that went
straight through my head was, 'Oh no, I thought these feelings were gone.'
I found myself walking back into the living room and sitting down in my
favourite chair, a pink recliner that has been through more crap than I
have. I just kept staring at the couch, my eyes were wide, and I was breathing
heavily. It felt like someone just reached into my chest, grabbed my heart
and started to squeeze.</B>
<BR><B>Then, right before my eyes, I saw what had been torturing me for
the last five minutes come into vision. I jumped from the recliner, slammed
into a colonnade, and finally tripped from a hole in the carpeting we used
to have. I fell flat on my back. I lifted my head and saw that the person
before was a man of about twenty-four in age. He was grinning at me, and
I heard a faint chuckle coming from him. He stood up and walked over to
me, held down his hand and started to move his mouth as if he was talking,
but I couldn't hear him, he was a mute to me. Suddenly out of nowhere I'm
answering him back, telling him that I'm alright. confused, but alright.
I stood up, I still had to look up at him, He was TALL, 6'4-5" I don't
really know. I could see him perfectly, from the colour of his hair to
the colour of his boots.</B>
<BR><B>He had black hair, brown eyes, and dark skin. He was wearing a blue
button up shirt, black jeans, and brown Doc Martins. He said that he was
here because I needed a friend and he was it. His name is Joseph, that's
all I can tell you of his name. He's Indian, Mexican, and Black Ukrainian.
He died in a car accident three weeks before I encountered him. Since he
is always with me whenever I'm lonely or not, I repay him by just keeping
him.</B>
<BR><B>I have more ghost experiences, some of them scary, sad, and sweet.
But all in all they don't bother me. And all the experiences that I have
and had don't bother me.</B>

<P><B>My Dad's Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: KRHbabe84@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello, My name is Heather.
My dad has had some very scary experiences in the past. I will tell you
just a few for there is too many to remember. First off, I will tell you
that all of my dads sisters and brothers have had their own experiences
also. Okay, here goes.....My dad is the youngest of 10 siblings and my
grandfather passed away when my father was 18 years old so he was the only
one living with my grandma in her home in upstate New York at the time
(or so they thought). My dad was about 24 when this happened. It was the
middle of the night and my dad was in his bedroom trying to go to sleep
when he felt something pulling him out of bed. It was pulling so hard he
actually had to hold on to the headboard. Now at the foot of the bed was
the closet where the fuse box was located. This really scared my dad so
he went to find my grandmother to tell her what happened and found her
in nd called them a few choice words and said he was leaving and on the
wall above his head was a light bulb which right after he said this, the
light bulb exploded and needless to say my dad got out of there as fast
as he could. Well thanks for listening. I will tell you more of the stories
later.</B>

<P><B>My Encounter</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: eddrimmer@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This was in my first house (we've moved 3 times since) and I'm going
to</B>
<BR><B>remember this forever. I think I was 7 at the time, I woke up at
night to</B>
<BR><B>see a lady standing in the corner of my room, I didnt know what
to think but</B>
<BR><B>I went back to sleep. The next morning (I dont remember this bit
fully but</B>
<BR><B>my mum remembers) I said to my mum, Is that woman that stands at
the end of</B>
<BR><B>my bed coming again tonight? She asked what woman and I described
her, and</B>
<BR><B>then I remember asking her to move the tumble dryer to the corner
of the</B>
<BR><B>room so the lady wouldnt come again. I never did see her again...</B>
<BR><B>When I was a bit older my mum asked me to describe her again and
the</B>
<BR><B>description matched my mums auntie who used to live in the house
who gassed</B>
<BR><B>herself in the bathroom because she thought she was going to die
of cancer,</B>
<BR><B>this upset me quite a bit. Anyway, a few years ago a builder was
working in</B>
<BR><B>the room I'd seen the ghost in and he knew nothing about what had
happened</B>
<BR><B>in that room, and he said to my mum that something strange had happened.
He</B>
<BR><B>was listening to the radio whilst striping the walls, and then suddenly
got</B>
<BR><B>a chill up he's spine and the radio went fuzzy, and he got the feeling</B>
<BR><B>someone was behind him. When he turned around knowone was there
and the</B>
<BR><B>radio went back to normal again.</B>
<BR><B>I beleive strongly in ghosts, i doubt ill ever see one again though.</B>

<P><B>My Encounters</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: imlakota4@surfglobal.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Name is Debbie and I have had many encounters with the unexplained.
Many say I am a sensitive and since the age of 6, I have to agree.As a
small child I was able to predict future happenings, but as an adult I
have become aware of every element around me.I'll begin with the present,
In August of 2000 I purchased a home in the White Mountains of New Hampshire,
the house was built in the late 60's in at this time it wasn't in good
shape ( need allot of work ) The strangest thing about this property was
for five years every time I traveled by it, it seemed to call out to me
I always noticed the home everytime.When the time came to purchase a home
I gave the Realtor the list of what I wanted and what I could afford, the
very first house I was shone was that house.</B>
<BR><B>When I first walked through the house I felt nothing inside, just
maybe a little loneliness from sitting so long and the want to be what
it could be I knew I could fix it and felt it would be a great project.</B>
<BR><B>My two daughters and I moved in on August 14th 2000, along with
our 4 dogs and 6 cats.Right from the start I work long hours every night
after work and on weekend just getting it in livable condition.The very
first night we were settled I was doing dishes in the small galley kitchen,
it was a bright sunny day, when I glanced up to the window I saw a shadowy
figure walk by I was unable to make out who it was but I some how knew
it was a man. The dogs where barking so I went to the door to find know
one, I walked around the yard and still know one.</B>
<BR><B>I never said anything to my children and several days later I asked
my youngest to do the dishes, she looked at me with a worried look and
stated she didn't like to do the dishes because of the man that walks by
every time she is at the sink.I didn't share with her at this time that
I to had the same in counter and shrugged it off.The visits of the shadows
came more frequent at the kitchen window and the front picture window,
know one was ever there. The&nbsp; day came when I began to work on my
youngest daughters room, I had to replace all the walls and ceiling due
to water damage, I stuccoes the walls and picked out the paint a very nice
blue would make the room very bright. When I finished painting I put down
my roller and stood back to examine my work, it looked great so I took
a well deserves rest before starting on the other work. Letting the Paint
dry! Several hours later I returned, to find large circles of oozing paint
all over the outside wall.It looked like the paint was being squeezed out
of the wall.I got to work with some sanding paper and repainted when it
dried all was well. I shrugged it off as, I don't know a strange accident.
The next day I started on the hall out side the room again the same thing
happened, I once again sanded it down and repainted and once again it was
fine.When my mom moved in that following June ( small aptment up stairs)
she said to me how she had heard someone come up her stairs and saw a figure
of a man at her door, but when she opened it no one was there.One evening
I was on my way home from work late well after midnight as I pulled up
to my house I saw a male figure wearing blue dickies stand by my bedroom
window peeking in he looked real enough but as I began to pull into the
drive he vanished.This past month the shadows have started again and with
the shadows comes mea, My washer got stuck on fill while I was out one
day and emptied my well into the kitchen and livingroom,( all over my new
flooring and carpets ) my upstairs tenants complained that their stereo
turned it self on in the middle of the night full blast.I found the water
values to my washer shut off, I didn't shut them off.My dogs are on edge
they bark at every little movement and I have 4 cats that will not come
in the house, when I drag them in they walk around growling.Just two nights
ago I was awaken in the middle of the night by the sound of my cordless
phone shutting off like when I have a power outage, I looked at my clock
on the side of my bed table to find it was still working I got up from
my bed to turn on the small lamp by my pc to find that wasn't working and
my pc was shut off so I turned on the over head light to find that some
how the power strip that ran my phone,pc and small lamp had been turned
off.I flipped the switch and all came back on. I shut off the light and
was getting back to bed as I pulled up the covers I noticed on the ceiling
just left of my bed a light in the shape of a circle about the size of
a golf ball.I lay in bed and watched it, it never moved and there was no
source from which it might be reflecting from.I turned over and went back
to sleep.( history ) the couple that lived in the house and built it had
three children the son was killed in 97 when a tree fell on him while logging,the
father had a heart attack when he watched a truck roll into his son and
law and kill him while logging.I spoke with the women I bought the house
from when I described the man standing outside the house she said that's
sounds like my father,who once owned all the land that the house sits on
as well as the property next door were his wife still lives as well as
the hill up back.I'm not sure what he wants of if he is alone, maybe he
confused or upset that the property went to some outside the family, but
we haven't had good luck here.</B>

<P><B>Mother-In Laws House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tmcgraw1@rochester.rr.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was staying at my mother-in-law's house to attend
her husband's funeral.&nbsp; It was my son's bedtime so I went upstairs
to the third floor with him.&nbsp; As I was lying there, I was crying and
feeling very devastated about my father-in-law's death.&nbsp; By this time,
my son had fallen asleep.&nbsp; I was suddenly aware of the presence of
Ike, my father-in-law!&nbsp; Every one of my senses was on overdrive as
if you would react to a breaking window in the middle of the night!Unfortunately,
I did not see him because I hid under the covers.&nbsp; (This still suprises
me because I have always wanted an encounter.)&nbsp; He did speak to me,
not verbally, but mentally.&nbsp; I could even tell he was amused at my
hiding.&nbsp; He said, "Why are you carrying on so?&nbsp; I'm fine...I
really am fine."&nbsp; And at that moment, a total peace came over like
warm water.&nbsp; I had never experienced anything like that before!&nbsp;
I really can't talk to many people about it.&nbsp; It seems almost sacriligious.</B>

<P><B>My Experiences with the Unknown</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sforeman55@sbcglobal.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I love your site.&nbsp; I have a couple experiences that</B>
<BR><B>happened in two different places.&nbsp; The first one is at</B>
<BR><B>my oldest sister's house in Des Moines, Iowa.&nbsp; Her</B>
<BR><B>house was over 30 years old so here is what happened,</B>
<BR><B>it happened in my nieces bedroom.&nbsp; My sister her</B>
<BR><B>husband, my niece and two two nephews were talking</B>
<BR><B>about ghosts and they all had stories to tell that</B>
<BR><B>happened in that house.&nbsp; We all retired for the</B>
<BR><B>evening and I was staying in my nieces room (the room</B>
<BR><B>where most of the paranormal activity happened).&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>was just starting to drift off to sleep when I felt</B>
<BR><B>something pushing me in the back through the mattress,</B>
<BR><B>I looked under the bed and found nothing, but I kept</B>
<BR><B>feeling the pressure on my back.&nbsp; I just grinned and</B>
<BR><B>bared it.&nbsp; After that my niece had a dresser that had</B>
<BR><B>these long bar knobs that dangled on her dresser, so</B>
<BR><B>it was bringing the bar knob up and slowly releasing</B>
<BR><B>it, I suffered through this for about 10 minutes then</B>
<BR><B>hit the floor and ran downstairs, my sister was</B>
<BR><B>snickering at me for pooh poohing their stories, well</B>
<BR><B>never again!&nbsp; The second experience happened in a</B>
<BR><B>three bedroom Queen Anne style house that my husband</B>
<BR><B>and I rented in Kansas City, Missouri.&nbsp; At the time</B>
<BR><B>our son was 6 years old and complained that his room</B>
<BR><B>would get real cold at night and then as the same</B>
<BR><B>thing happened to me at my sister's house he felt</B>
<BR><B>something pushing his back through the mattress, I</B>
<BR><B>began to start laying in bed with him until he fell</B>
<BR><B>asleep, that would only take maybe 5 minutes, no</B>
<BR><B>problem.&nbsp; I would then get up and go to my room.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>fell asleep with no problem then I would wake up at</B>
<BR><B>about 2:45 in the early morning with something laying</B>
<BR><B>on my chest, I couldn't scream or say a word because</B>
<BR><B>my chest was constricted.&nbsp; I finally called for our</B>
<BR><B>dog (her name was Gretchen and she was a rottweiler)</B>
<BR><B>she came over to me and licked my hand, whatever thing</B>
<BR><B>was on me got off and Gretchen started to growl at</B>
<BR><B>something that I couldn't see until she chased it</B>
<BR><B>downstairs.&nbsp; Just then my husband woke up out of a</B>
<BR><B>deep sleep asking what was going on, I quickly told</B>
<BR><B>him what happened and then he told me that every night</B>
<BR><B>that he would climb the stairs to go to bed that he</B>
<BR><B>would skip the last two stairs and swing up to the top</B>
<BR><B>landing by holding onto the baluster, he said that</B>
<BR><B>there was a very dark thing in the corner of those</B>
<BR><B>stairs and he got the feeling to not mess with it.</B>
<BR><B>Also, I was a stay at home mom back then and I would</B>
<BR><B>be watching TV as I was getting dinner ready and my</B>
<BR><B>dog and cat would suddenly sit up and stare at the</B>
<BR><B>basement door (this door was behind me) then my dog</B>
<BR><B>would start growling real low and then end up with a</B>
<BR><B>high pitched bark then both my cat and dog would run</B>
<BR><B>to the front room, the farthest room from the kitchen</B>
<BR><B>and believe me I was right behind them and all three</B>
<BR><B>of us would end up on the front porch waiting for my</B>
<BR><B>husband to come home.&nbsp; We moved out of there about 9</B>
<BR><B>years ago when our landlord sold the house, and the</B>
<BR><B>same people still live there.&nbsp; I have not had anymore</B>
<BR><B>experiences since then and hope to never have any, I'm</B>
<BR><B>just not cut out for that sort of thing, but when</B>
<BR><B>someone tells me about an experience with a ghost, I</B>
<BR><B>believe them.&nbsp; I know this wasn't very scary but</B>
<BR><B>believe me it was true and it scared the dickens out</B>
<BR><B>of me!</B>

<BR><B>My First Apartment</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:zacris@msn.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Not long after I turned eighteen I moved out of my parents house
and in with my fianc&eacute; and we became resident managers in 16 plex
apartment building.&nbsp; This was the first time I lived on my own with
out my family.&nbsp; The apartment building we managed was just taken over
by a bank and was being renovated after sitting half empty for many years.&nbsp;
Not long after moving in to the one bedroom I became uneasy in the apartment.
It was hard to explain what it was but some nights when I would go to bed
and the lights would turn off I would become hysterical and yell at my
fianc&eacute; to turn the lights back on.&nbsp; Once the lights were on
for a few minutes I would calm down and the lights could be turned back
off.&nbsp; This has never happened to me before or since.</B>
<BR><B>This wasn't the only weird thing that happened while we lived their
one morning we both woke up and were talking then suddenly we both fell
back to sleep.&nbsp; I had heard the answering machine go off but never
heard the phone ring but I did hear someone talking but couldn't make it
out.&nbsp; After the talking stopped by Fianc&eacute; and I both woke and
the first thing he did was go check the answering machine, there was no
message.&nbsp; He asked me if I heard it go off and I said I did.&nbsp;
We checked the machine and couldn't find anything wrong with it.</B>
<BR><B>The last strange and very scary thing that happened before we moved
out happened to me.&nbsp; We were asleep and I had this very strange dream
at least that is what I am going with because I have no other explanation.&nbsp;
In my "dream" I was a waken and looked about the room.&nbsp; The room was
dark except from the street light that was coming in from the window behind
the bed.&nbsp; The room looked exactly the way it did before I went to
sleep.&nbsp; I turned and looked at my fianc&eacute; and saw him sleeping
with the covers pulled all the way up to his head and only his head showing.&nbsp;
I am sure you are thinking that if the room looked exactly the way it does
when I am a wake then I must have been awake.&nbsp; I would have agreed
but when I looked down towards the end of the bed I saw my fianc&eacute;
floating about four inches from the ground and he was totally green.&nbsp;
He was wearing the boxer he had gone to bed in and he looked exactly the
same except for being green and floating.&nbsp; He floated from the chair
that was on the left hand side of to the bedroom door on the other side
of the room and out into the living room.&nbsp; I fell back to sleep or
the "dream" ended right after he left the room.&nbsp; I was extremely scared
the next morning and when I woke up I told my fianc&eacute; about the "dream".&nbsp;
I said I had a dream about him being a monster and he just laughed it off.&nbsp;
Not long after that we moved and I have never had another experience like
that since I lived in that apartment.</B>
<BR><B>As for my fianc&eacute; and I we did marry but two years almost
to the day of our marriage we divorced.&nbsp; Unfortunately the "dream"
or maybe it was an omen came true he did turn out to be a monster.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My First House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tobiwood@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My husband and I have moved around a lot over the years.&nbsp; I
have experienced supernatural phenomena all my life, but over the past
five years my experiences and dwindled down to few and far between.&nbsp;
For this I was glad.&nbsp; But two years ago, my husband and I bought our
first house in Port Orchard, Washington.&nbsp; It seemed a nice house,
and possibly a nice neighborhood.&nbsp; But the six months before we left
things started happening that I could not explain.&nbsp; It left me very
unsettled to say the least.&nbsp; My first experience started when I lay
in bed quietly for all of an hour.&nbsp; I couldn't sleep for some reason.&nbsp;
I tried and tried, and it just wouldn't come.&nbsp; My husband was having
the same problem, and then I heard him get up to use the restroom which
was also in our bedroom.&nbsp; He asked me a question, which I couldn't
hear, so I drug my face down and across my pillow.&nbsp; What I saw confused
and frightened me horribly.&nbsp; As I saw him close the bathroom door,
I saw a dark figure leave the room and go down the hall.&nbsp; Not only
did I see this I heard it as well.&nbsp; I lay dumbfounded trying to figure
out if it was my husband who went to use the bathroom down the hall instead.&nbsp;
But there was no mistake, he was using the master bathroom.&nbsp; I freaked
out, unable to convey to him what happened until the next day.&nbsp; As
usual he tried to come up with a scientific reason.&nbsp; I just saw something
and it was my imagination.&nbsp; I knew that it was NOT my imagination
and what I saw reallllllyyyy happened.&nbsp; After that I couldn't sleep
with the door open.&nbsp; It was impossilble.&nbsp; When I did sleep with
my door open I saw the same dark figure make its way down the hall.&nbsp;
Not only that, I would hear it too.&nbsp; Things started to escalate.&nbsp;
One night while in the office doing my late night internet surfing I heard
the garage door open and close.&nbsp; I got up to talk to my husband and
find out why he went to the garage.&nbsp; Just then he called me from the
bedroom.&nbsp; I couldn't believe it, not again!&nbsp; I thought oh it
must of been the cat.&nbsp; You see the garage door does not latch properly
and she can push it open.&nbsp; But standing in the bedroom, I saw the
cat fast asleep with my husband.&nbsp; I asked, "Has the cat been in here
all night?"&nbsp; My husband looked at me and said, "Yes, all night."&nbsp;
Needless to say, my late night surfing was over.&nbsp; Throughout this
whole time things would happen like, I heard someone say my name.&nbsp;
Loudly too, I might add.&nbsp; Going into my husbands office and asking
what he needed was futile.&nbsp; He hadn't called my name.&nbsp; That happens
all the time.&nbsp; I hear my name, yet no one is calling me.&nbsp; The
bedroom seems to be an especially strong place for demons to visit me.&nbsp;
One night I had a horrible time getting to sleep, as well as my husband.&nbsp;
He had gotten up around three to work in the office.&nbsp; All of a sudden
I had a strong complusion to wake up.&nbsp; When I did I felt like the
wind got knocked out of me.&nbsp; I woke up fast enough to see a dark figure
standing over me.&nbsp; I startled so quickly, I pushed my whole body backwards
so far I almost hit the floor on the other side.&nbsp; But I didn't because
something stopped me.&nbsp; Thinking it was my husband I was grateful he
was there, but when I said Jeff, there was no reply.&nbsp; Instead my husband
walks out of the office to see what had happened.&nbsp; Thats when I bolted
out of bed upright turned on the lamp and stared at him with my eyes wide
open, he asked if I had a nightmare.&nbsp; I told him more than you know.&nbsp;
Once I calmed down I was able to tell him what happened.&nbsp; He just
sat there not sure what to say.&nbsp; My husband is never sure what to
say when these events happen to me.&nbsp; I especially hated being alone
there, because my husband would often leave to go to work at odd hours
of the night.&nbsp; One night he left around midnight and I was up watching
tv.&nbsp; All of a sudden the kitchen light turned off.&nbsp; I thought
oh great, a bulb blew out.&nbsp; Yet when i went to the kitchen I found
the switch was turned to off.&nbsp; That same night I heard something typing
on my keyboard in the office.&nbsp; It also moved my chair.&nbsp; I threw
my shoes on and left.&nbsp; I don't know what the deal is with this neighborhood
I am leaving, but I sure am glad.&nbsp; You see I don't believe that these
things happened from ghosts, or people who have died.&nbsp; I believe it
is demons that have tormented me over the years.&nbsp; That just makes
it all the more terrifying.&nbsp; I was hoping I had left these things
behind in our most recent move.&nbsp; But the other night, I programmed
the TV and the menu kept changing itself back.&nbsp; I sure hope it was
the TV and nothing else!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Friends</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: AmethystEyedMage@go.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I just want to sort of speak out for ghosts and spirits and such.
They aren't all bad. In fact, I've befriended several supernatural beings.
There are some that live in my house even. Theres Adrianna(Aria), Sarralain(Sarra),
Catalina(Alina), and Leighanna.. All of them are girls, Aria is 13, or
was when she died, Sarra is 15, Alina is 10, and Leighanna is 5. They died
of some sort of sickness in the early 1800's. They are really friendly,
but i'm the only one that knows about them. I once tried to tell my mom,
but she just told me to stop making up stories to scare my sisters and
brother. At first, the girlss wouldn't show themselves, but eventually
I convinced them that I was their friend, and now we are really close.
I just wanted to let some people, who think all ghosts are evil or bad,
know that at least some of them dont want to harm or scare anyone.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Ghost Experiences</B><B></B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Hi, my name is Meg and my e-mail address is megsam213@hotmail.com.&nbsp;
Here is</B>
<BR><B>my story:</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am 21 years old and although have believed in ghosts all my life,
I have</B>
<BR><B>not seen any until recently.&nbsp; A few months ago, I was watching
television</B>
<BR><B>and fell asleep on the couch, (my parents had already gone to bed).&nbsp;
Right</B>
<BR><B>before I woke up, I had the feeling someone was watching me.&nbsp;
So I opened my</B>
<BR><B>eyes and for a split second saw the image of an old man watching
me sleep.</B>
<BR><B>Even freakier, the television was definitely on when I fell asleep,
but it</B>
<BR><B>was off when I woke up, and I know my parents didn't turn it off
because if</B>
<BR><B>they had, they would have woken me up and told me to go to bed,
(They hate</B>
<BR><B>it when I am sleeping anywhere but my bed, for some reason).</B>
<BR><B>My second story happened two Saturdays ago.&nbsp; My boyfriend and
I were hanging</B>
<BR><B>out at my house, and my father had to go out.&nbsp; We, (my boyfriend
and I),</B>
<BR><B>were hanging out in the kitchen.&nbsp; Out of the corner of my eye
I saw what I</B>
<BR><B>thought was my father walk down the hallway, and I also heard the
footsteps</B>
<BR><B>of him walking down the hall.&nbsp; My boyfriend and I were talking
when he</B>
<BR><B>mentioned something about me smoking.&nbsp; My parents don't know
I smoke, so I</B>
<BR><B>said, "Rob, shh!"&nbsp; He said, "What's the matter, we are the
only ones in the</B>
<BR><B>house."&nbsp; I said, "No, I just saw my father walk down the hall".&nbsp;
He kept</B>
<BR><B>insisting that he saw my father leave, so I went to the window to
look out</B>
<BR><B>to our driveway, and sure enough, he was gone, which makes me wonder
who was</B>
<BR><B>walking down the hall?&nbsp; I think our house might be haunted,
and even my</B>
<BR><B>father thinks so, which is weird, since he is a hardcore Catholic
and</B>
<BR><B>doesn't believe in ghosts, he thinks that he has seen the previous
owner,</B>
<BR><B>(who happened to be my mother's boss's mother)walking through the
house.</B>
<BR><B>Just a few days ago my mother tells me that she died in the house!&nbsp;
But what</B>
<BR><B>confuses me is that the ghost(s) I have seen have been men, so mother
is</B>
<BR><B>going to ask her boss what his father looks like, to see if it matches
the</B>
<BR><B>description of the man I have been seeing!&nbsp; Thank you for listening!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>"My Ghost Experiences"</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ezrobledo@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>All of my life I could see or feel the presence of ghosts and they
seem to be everywhere I go.&nbsp; They'd never try to communicate and I
never felt scared.&nbsp; I could be watching TV and look in the next room
and a dark shadow would be standing there.&nbsp; One night I was asleep
at my aunts house with my cousins on the living room floor when I heard
something fall down like rakes outside the window.&nbsp; I got up and looked
(my aunt lived four houses down from the train tracks) and for some reason
I looked toward the train tracks.&nbsp; It was foggy, which was weird because
it was 80 degree's outside that night.&nbsp; Anyways I could see a beautiful,
slender woman with long blonde hair holding hands with a little girl that
looked just like her.&nbsp; They were walking down the road toward the
house.&nbsp; I woke up two of my cousins and asked if they saw anything
coming down the road.&nbsp; They saw nothing and I told them what I saw
but they still were unable to see what I saw.&nbsp; As the lady came closer
to the house she faded.</B>
<BR><B>Another experience happens in my bedroom. There has always been
a strange feeling to my room and was always cold no matter how high the
heater was.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a child we were told the an elderly lady passed
away in my room.&nbsp; There I was the only one able to ever sleep peacefully
in there.&nbsp; Some nights my little sister would sleep with me and she
said that she didn't sleep cause she was so scared.&nbsp; She didn't know
what she was afraid but she was so scared she couldn't even leave the room.&nbsp;
One night I was sleeping and right above me head something banged had against
my wall.&nbsp; I awoke and ran to my light switch but something pulled
me back.&nbsp; I landed straight on my butt.&nbsp; I got back up and made
it to my light switch.&nbsp; My mom heard me fall so she came to see what
happened.&nbsp; I told her I just fell off the bed.&nbsp; I was scared
but al the same time I was excited because never before had these ghosts
ever made contact with me.&nbsp; Shortly after I moved out but visited
often.&nbsp; One night me and my boyfriend spent the night and he couldn't
sleep in there.&nbsp; I woke up in the morning and found him asleep in
the living room.&nbsp; He said that he felt as if someone was on top of
him.&nbsp; My daughter was five years old and when we slept in there she
would always be completely under the covers and right next to me.&nbsp;
I asked her "Why are you sleeping like that?"&nbsp; She said because she
could feel like someone was breathing in her face.&nbsp; Now keep in mind
I never told anyone about my vibes of the room.</B>
<BR><B>Now years had passed and two children later without any more ghosts
sightings.&nbsp; I moved into my dad's house (I was divorcing).&nbsp; Let
me explain the layout of the house.&nbsp; In the past it had been rented
out as two places, an upstairs and downstairs place.&nbsp; Mine was downstairs.
My dad and sister lived upstairs.&nbsp; I worked swing shift and got off
at 1:30 a.m., my sister watched my kids.&nbsp; When I got home I would
carry the children down stairs to their beds then go up and visit with
my sister.&nbsp; We would hear one of the baby's crying, but a really terrified
crying, so we would run down stairs to find the children all sleeping heavily.&nbsp;
And the same would happen if were we downstairs, we would hear someone
crying upstairs.&nbsp; And the washer door would often slam shut.&nbsp;
One night I could feel something but was afraid to turn and look.&nbsp;
My nephew was downstairs with me, we were watching TV (all Lights were
off).&nbsp; But as I was feeling something my nephew turned to talk to
me (in the direction I felt something) and he saw it, he let out the most
terrified scream I've ever heard.&nbsp; He was completely freaked, he wouldn't
even let me turn on the light my sister heard him scream and ran downstairs.&nbsp;
He said he saw something looking at us, but that is all he will say, he
won't tell us anything else.&nbsp; After we asked my cousin if he had seen
or heard anything weird at that house ( he used to live there before us)
and he said yes they often heard strange things like baby's crying and
things slamming also (they had no children).&nbsp; He said that he found
out a little boy was accidentally shot in a drive by shooting in the yard
and his mother carried him in the house, what is now our laundry room where
he died from the gunshot would.</B>
<BR><B>The ghost at my house likes to wait until I 'm asleep and wake me
by touching my arm or leg.&nbsp; After being woken up three or four times
in one night I would ask him nicely to please leave me alone and let me
sleep.&nbsp; It would until the next night.&nbsp; When it didn't wake me
by touching I would wake up cause I could feel him staring at me.&nbsp;
I would wake up and see a small, dark silhouette of him in the hall way.&nbsp;
I began to feel as if I was losing it cause this happened almost every
night.&nbsp; I began to stay up all night scared and sleep once daylight
came.&nbsp; I couldn't handle it anymore.&nbsp; I began to take a lot of
sleeping pills so I couldn't be awakened, although some nights I was still
awakened but now I was mad.&nbsp; I wouldn't give him any attention but
I could feel him sitting next to me on the bed.&nbsp; The next morning
I woke up.&nbsp; It was so cold.&nbsp; I looked around the house and the
back door was wide open.&nbsp; This door was hard to open, you have to
kick it open and shut.&nbsp; This happened three more times.&nbsp; I finally
had it I told the being that this is my house and I refuse to live like
this anymore and I put a shelf against the back door.&nbsp; No more occurrences
have happened to date.</B>

<P><B>My Ghost Story in Tennessee</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ccandgg@midmaine.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was born in Tennessee and lived
there until I was 12 years old.&nbsp; We were raised in a very abusive
home.&nbsp; I am the oldest of five children in our family.&nbsp; We were
sexually abused at a very young age, in fact I don't remember when the
abuse started.&nbsp; My father was an alcohol abuser.&nbsp; We were also
abused by our paternal grandfather.&nbsp; The abuse was also physical and
emotional.&nbsp; Anyway, when I was about eight years old, we moved into
a house in Maryville, Tennessee.&nbsp; The first house we lived in was
very small.&nbsp; My youngest sister was born while we lived in this house
and I can remember she was bitten by rats in her crib.&nbsp; She was bitten
on the ear lobe and on the little finger.&nbsp; There was a house next
door with a family living there when we moved in.&nbsp; This family had
two boys who were close to teen-age and a daughter was born while they
lived there.&nbsp; I believe this baby died while they lived next door
to us.&nbsp; After this baby died, they moved away.&nbsp; We then moved
into this house.&nbsp; All the time we lived in this house (the house next
door/the second house we lived in) my father would always accuse my mother
of having someone in the house when he was not there. The driveway showed
the back entrance to the house.&nbsp; He would come home and say he had
seen someone leave the back door when he came into the driveway.&nbsp;
Anyway, the house was laid out in this fashion:&nbsp; the front door opened
into the living room,&nbsp; to the right of the living room was my parent's
bedroom, which was where my brother slept after he was born,&nbsp; this
room opened to the bedroom where we kids slept (there was no door, just
a doorway),&nbsp; a doorway opened off our bedroom to the kitchen and a
door opened off the kitchen to the back hall and to the right was the bathroom
and to the left was the rear entrance to the house (the one that opened
to the driveway.)&nbsp; At the foot of the only bed in the children's bedroom
was the area which led from the doorway from our parent's bedroom to the
kitchen.&nbsp; I was nine years old when we moved into that house.&nbsp;
I had two younger sisters who slept with me in that bed.&nbsp; We had always
lived out in the country and were unfamilier with street lights but outside
the bedroom window of this house was a street light.&nbsp; I can remember
having to become accustomed to the extra light.&nbsp; We did not have curtains
on the window or a shade so it really took some getting used to!&nbsp;
But it definitely made everything in that room very visible!&nbsp; Anyway,&nbsp;
many nights I laid awake and heard the steps of something walking from
the doorway to my parent's bedroom to the doorway to the kitchen and back-like
a soldier walking sentry duty-back and forth until I went to sleep.&nbsp;
It did not scare me but I knew it was not normal.&nbsp; The memory stayed
with me and when I was about 21&nbsp; years old, I went back home (I had
left when I was 14 years old to escape the abuse).&nbsp; My father was
no longer a part of the home.&nbsp; One evening the family had gathered
and we were talking about our lives and the things that had happened to
us.&nbsp; I started telling the story of the sentry and was stunned to
discover that both the sisters who had slept with me in that bed had the
same exact memory as I did.&nbsp; None of us had ever mentioned the "sentry"
to anyone else.&nbsp; We had never talked about this with anyone before.&nbsp;
But none of us doubted that something had walked sentry duty possibly to
protect us from the abuse we were enduring.&nbsp; We moved away from the
house when I was 11 years old and it was never mentioned until 10 years
late.</B><B></B>
