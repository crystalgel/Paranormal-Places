<BR><B>I don't like sharing my House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: piccadilly_crazy@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I need start with a rather lame beginning by saying</B>
<BR><B>that, of course, I've never done something like this</B>
<BR><B>before.&nbsp; I've never had a paranormal experience before</B>
<BR><B>this, or seen ghosts throughout my entire life,</B>
<BR><B>believed in ghoest before, etc.&nbsp; My story starts like</B>
<BR><B>this:</B>
<BR><B>My fiance and I bought a small house in a small suburb</B>
<BR><B>out side of St. Louis four months before our wedding.</B>
<BR><B>Since my parents are very religious and don't live</B>
<BR><B>near us we decided not to tell them that we that we</B>
<BR><B>moved in together.&nbsp; We figured we wouldn't start an</B>
<BR><B>arguement with them since we were getting married soon</B>
<BR><B>anyway.&nbsp; My sister, Liz, lived near us and knew that</B>
<BR><B>we were living together.&nbsp; She would come over to the</B>
<BR><B>house when we were fixing it up and tease me by saying</B>
<BR><B>stuff like, "You are going to hell for lying to our</B>
<BR><B>parents and living in sin!"&nbsp; She was always joking and</B>
<BR><B>I would tell her to stop being mean to me.&nbsp; One</B>
<BR><B>afternoon she and I were at the house together and my</B>
<BR><B>fiance, Dave, was out buying supplies to paint our</B>
<BR><B>living room the next day.&nbsp; Of course Liz was still</B>
<BR><B>teasing me and I was laughing about it.&nbsp; She soon said</B>
<BR><B>she had to leave but would be back the next morning to</B>
<BR><B>help us paint the living room.&nbsp; When she left I was in</B>
<BR><B>the living room getting everything ready to paint the</B>
<BR><B>next day and I saw something written on the wall in</B>
<BR><B>pencil.&nbsp; I went over to look at it and it said, "You</B>
<BR><B>are a sinner."&nbsp; The pencil was laying on the floor</B>
<BR><B>next to the wall.&nbsp; I figured it was my sister's idea</B>
<BR><B>for a joke since we were going to paint and it would</B>
<BR><B>be covered up.&nbsp; I decided to respond to her and wrote</B>
<BR><B>under it in pencil, "You're not funny."&nbsp; I was</B>
<BR><B>laughing to myself about it and went on putting tape</B>
<BR><B>around the bottom of the wall.&nbsp; After I was done I</B>
<BR><B>went back to the wall with the writing and saw that</B>
<BR><B>what I had written was gone!&nbsp; I was so shocked that I</B>
<BR><B>stood there for a minute not moving.&nbsp; Nothing, I mean</B>
<BR><B>NOTHING, had ever happened to me like this.&nbsp; I was</B>
<BR><B>trying to rationalize it in my mind (with little</B>
<BR><B>success) when I noticed the pencil was gone too.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>found it on the kitchen counter 20 feet away.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>called my sister on her cell phone and asked her if</B>
<BR><B>she had written it.&nbsp; She said she didn't know what I</B>
<BR><B>was talking about.&nbsp; My sister and I are very close in</B>
<BR><B>age and I know when she is trying to pull something</B>
<BR><B>over on me. My fiance came home soon after that and I</B>
<BR><B>told him what had happened.&nbsp; He didn't quite believe</B>
<BR><B>me, but could tell that I was really shaken by the</B>
<BR><B>whole experience.&nbsp; That night when we went to bed my</B>
<BR><B>fiance got up in the night to use the bathroom.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>next morning he told me that I forgot to turn the</B>
<BR><B>living room light off when we went to bed and I know</B>
<BR><B>that I had turned it off.&nbsp; The next morning my sister</B>
<BR><B>came to help us paint and I told her the weird things</B>
<BR><B>that had happened.&nbsp; She believed me a little more than</B>
<BR><B>my fiance, but they were both skeptical. While we were</B>
<BR><B>painting the living room I was very edgy.&nbsp; My sister</B>
<BR><B>was still making jokes, but I didn't think they were</B>
<BR><B>quite as funny this time.&nbsp; When we took a break for</B>
<BR><B>lunch we put our brushes and rollers in the pans on</B>
<BR><B>the living room floor and went out for lunch.&nbsp; When we</B>
<BR><B>came back all of the brushes and rollers that we had</B>
<BR><B>been using were laying on the kitchen table.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>paint on them ruined the table and my fiance and</B>
<BR><B>sister and I became believers in ghost. We were all</B>
<BR><B>pretty scared and didn't want to be in the house</B>
<BR><B>anymore.&nbsp; A friend of ours from highschool recently</B>
<BR><B>graduated from the seminary and was a priest.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>decided to call him, but he was busy and couldn't take</B>
<BR><B>our call right away.&nbsp; None of us wanted to continue</B>
<BR><B>painting, but my fiance convinced to stay by saying</B>
<BR><B>with three of us there it wouldn't be too scary.</B>
<BR><B>Nothing else happened the rest of the day.&nbsp; My sister</B>
<BR><B>stayed the night with us because we didn't want to be</B>
<BR><B>scared of our new home. She slept with me in the bed</B>
<BR><B>and Dave slept on the floor. That night we heard</B>
<BR><B>movement in the living room so the three us (looking</B>
<BR><B>ridiculous) held hands and crept to the living room.</B>
<BR><B>Dave turned on the light, Liz and I screamed, and</B>
<BR><B>there was absolutely nothing there.&nbsp; It was empty</B>
<BR><B>except for a ladder we had used, and it had been moved</B>
<BR><B>to the other side of the room.&nbsp; We went back to the</B>
<BR><B>bedroom and debated whether to spend the rest of the</B>
<BR><B>night there or go to my sister's apartment.&nbsp; We</B>
<BR><B>decided to stay.&nbsp; None of us slept well, but we didn't</B>
<BR><B>hear anything else.&nbsp; The next day my sister and I</B>
<BR><B>decided to meet my neighbors.&nbsp; We didn't want them to</B>
<BR><B>think we were insane by telling them we had ghost, but</B>
<BR><B>we wanted to find out who had lived in the house</B>
<BR><B>before us.&nbsp; The woman across the street told us that</B>
<BR><B>an older woman lived there and mentioned that the was</B>
<BR><B>really religious and kept religious nicnacs all over</B>
<BR><B>the house, but she died (in the house) five years ago.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Since then there have been some renters, but no one</B>
<BR><B>had bought the place since her death until us.&nbsp; We</B>
<BR><B>decided that she was the one haunting us.&nbsp; My friend,</B>
<BR><B>the priest, finally called me back and I told him what</B>
<BR><B>was happening.&nbsp; He agreed to come over and bless the</B>
<BR><B>house and give us some comfort.&nbsp; When he got there he</B>
<BR><B>said he could tell something different about the</B>
<BR><B>house, but he didn't think she was trying to do us</B>
<BR><B>harm.&nbsp; He blessed the house and the rest of the day</B>
<BR><B>went with out incident.&nbsp; That night I had a dream that</B>
<BR><B>an old woman was in our living room crying and saying</B>
<BR><B>that she didn't want her house to belong to people who</B>
<BR><B>weren't married.&nbsp; I remember trying to argue with her</B>
<BR><B>telling her we were getting married soon. Then all of</B>
<BR><B>a sudden she vanished. I know there was more to the</B>
<BR><B>dream, but I can't remember it all.&nbsp; It was a very</B>
<BR><B>surreal dream.&nbsp; I don't know if I was actually arguing</B>
<BR><B>with the woman who had lived here, or if I was feeling</B>
<BR><B>guilty for lying to my parents. I woke up and I</B>
<BR><B>realized I was crying.&nbsp; I think that the woman must</B>
<BR><B>have loved the house and didn't want to leave, but</B>
<BR><B>realized she had too.&nbsp; I feel bad that I made her</B>
<BR><B>leave, but since the dream we have not had a single</B>
<BR><B>occurance.&nbsp; I sincerely hope she doesn't come back.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>may be a coward, but I don't like sharing a house with</B>
<BR><B>a ghost.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Okinawan Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: LopezCA@3FSSG.USMC.MIL</B><B></B>

<P><B>i am in the military, stationed in okinawa japan. my wife, child
and i live</B>
<BR><B>in an apartment complex on base.</B>
<BR><B>the housing is built over a large battle sight which took place
during the</B>
<BR><B>war.</B>
<BR><B>my wife is very sensitive to ghost and aparitions, they have followed
her</B>
<BR><B>since she was a child in Texas. well she and i were sitting in the
living</B>
<BR><B>room watching t.v. one night when a figure walked out from the hall
stopped</B>
<BR><B>and turned back towards the hallway and disappeared. this wa my
first time</B>
<BR><B>ever seeing a ghost. on several occaisions a bright ball of white
light has</B>
<BR><B>been seen moving throughout the house, especially in my son`s room.
it seems</B>
<BR><B>to like him a lot. it also turns his toys on whenever it feels like
it,</B>
<BR><B>which is quite often. the most unbelievable night of my life was
experienced</B>
<BR><B>recently while my wife an i were sleeping. i woke to a shadowy figure</B>
<BR><B>standing next to the bed. i was uncovered at the time and the figure
seemed</B>
<BR><B>to be reaching for me, i tryed to scream but nothing came out. this
happened</B>
<BR><B>three times that night. on ther third time i just layed still and
watched</B>
<BR><B>the figure grab for me, reach the covers and pull them back over
me. it</B>
<BR><B>seems that this ghost is very friendly and means no harm in any
way, it has</B>
<BR><B>always been prone to my wife, it frequently calls her name or watches
her do</B>
<BR><B>the dishes. she tells me at least 1 new story a week about something
strange</B>
<BR><B>in the house or things being moved.</B>
<BR><B>i was not a believer in ghosts in anyway but now it seems impossible
not to</B>
<BR><B>be.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Mother's Haunted House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: GOUDY24@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I didn't think anything much of all I experienced in my mother's
house until some years later, and when i think of it now, I can look back,
and realize that some really disturbing things went on there when I was
living there. First, I would like to shed some light on the history of
the house. The house was built sometime in the 1920's, maybe a little bit
before that. It was owned by a very prominent family in town at the time,
the Hazeltine's, who owned a jewelry store downtown. Their daughter, Frieda,
was somewhat of a recluse, who never married, and from what I know, never
left home. I found some letters, and photos, along with period clothing,
which the letters were from Frieda's travels. Although she never married,
being wealthy, she traveled to Rome, Greece, and other places.</B>
<BR><B>>From what I know, she died suddenly, and violently one day. In
my mother's house, there is a big wooden staircase which curved very sharply.</B>
<BR><B>Frieda evidently tripped on the stairs, and fell to the bottom step,
breaking her neck. I've heard she died instantly, and I've heard she died
en route to the hospital.</B>
<BR><B>There was one occasion when I was little (I don't remember how old),
that I remember sitting at the top of the stairs, and feeling a pushing
sensation on my back, and I fell down the stairs, and landed on the BOTTOM
step. I was unhurt, but I still get cold chills thinking about the eerie
similarities.&nbsp; I always felt a weird feeling going up and down those
stairs, so much so , that many times my sister would have to carry me up
them at night, and I would close my eyes the whole way. It always felt
like someone was behind us. Things fell off bookshelves sometimes, you
could just feel a presence there sometimes, watching you. Nothing really
violent happened, other than the stair episode. My sister said that once,
she looked out into the narrow hallway, across it to my brother's room,
and his whole doorway was covered with what looked like a white, cloudy
weblike substance. Also, one night, my sister awoke from sleep , to find
three, cloudlike forms standing at the end of the bed. She was so scared
she couldThings like this continued to happen until I left home. I never
saw any forms or persons myself, but I am convince that Frieda was still
clinging to her home, and resented us living there somewhat.</B>

<P><B>My Mother</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Marilynvel73@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is marilyn, my mother died in January 24, 2001.&nbsp; Even
though she has passed I still feel her presence in my apartment, wether
its an image from the corner of my eye, or just the feel of her hands touching
me, even a noise or the sound of her voice late at night.&nbsp; I often
think that she is trying to tell me something.&nbsp; Sometimes I even think
that she is haunting me.&nbsp; I find myself complaining to feel cold and
tired like she would feel when she was alive.&nbsp; Also, I keep believing
that she has not found peace yet.&nbsp; Some how me and my sisters have
failed her as daughters in the religious sence.</B>

<BR><B>Haunted House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Christina.Meyn@gecapital.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was 18 and ready to get out on my own, but had a very small income
so I wasnt able to afford much.&nbsp; My mom found an apartment in the
paper which happened to be an old house made</B>
<BR><B>into 4 apartments.&nbsp; Mine was on the bottome in the back of
the house.&nbsp; It was&nbsp; a very nice apartment so I decided it fit
my budget and started moving in a little while later.&nbsp; One</B>
<BR><B>night, before I was fully moved in, I took a friend over to see
the place it was about 11:30 at night and the door was wide open.&nbsp;
Someone had obviously broken into the apartment,</B>
<BR><B>but they didnt take anything that I noticed.&nbsp; That kind of
creeped me out so When my boyfriend was getting ready to move I offered
for him to move in with me.&nbsp; Everything was fine</B>
<BR><B>for awhile and I started to feel more and more comfortable at the
apartment until about 4 months later when I was in a deep sleep and awakened
and I to this day dont even know why</B>
<BR><B>I woke up, but I looked into the hall right outside of the bedroom,
I had a desk for a computer and some other papers and things there, and
I saw a figure with its back to me and</B>
<BR><B>it appeared to be looking through my things.&nbsp; I thought it
was my boyfriend so I called his name and asked him what he was doing.&nbsp;
The figure turned and at that time my boyfriend</B>
<BR><B>woke up and said "What?"&nbsp; I had woken him up when I said his
name and I realized he was right next to me in the bed and it wasnt him
out in the hall.&nbsp; It shook me up pretty good.</B>
<BR><B>I was too scared to sleep so I just cuddled up to my boyfriend,
but the funny thing is that when my boyfriend woke up it was gone.&nbsp;
A couple of weeks went by and I still remembered</B>
<BR><B>the incident, but I figured it was all a dream no matter how real
the figure looked to me because I didnt really know if I believed in ghosts.&nbsp;
I decided to just dismiss it as a</B>
<BR><B>dream and then a few days later, again I was awakened from a deep
sleep.&nbsp; this time, the same exact figure, which I could tell was a
person but couldnt see the features too well</B>
<BR><B>other than the fact that it had long hair just like my boyfriend,
was standing at the foot of my bed just staring at me.&nbsp; That really
creeped me out and I woke my boyfriend up and</B>
<BR><B>it was gone.&nbsp; I think he thought I was crazy or something until
the next night, again I was awakened and this time the figure was kneeling
on the bed right beside me looking over</B>
<BR><B>me.&nbsp; I nudged Angel and he could tell I was scared to death
the figure stayed a little longer this time, but of course Angel couldnt
see it after a few minutes it went away.&nbsp; He</B>
<BR><B>then believed me because he saw how frightened I had been and we
moved out shortly after.&nbsp; It was the creepiest thing.&nbsp; I spoke
to my mom about it because she has seen ghosts</B>
<BR><B>before as well and she said it didnt sound like it was trying to
harm me.&nbsp; I dont think it was either, but I reacted the way any person
who had never seen a ghost before would react.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Home</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Stezyg@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>It all started when i was 11 years old living with my mother sister
and step dad in the house i lived in from birth.&nbsp; It was an old council
estate established in the early 1900's about 5 minutes walk away from a
coal mining site that was destroyed around 1920 with a blast from inside
killing hundreds trapped inside.&nbsp; This is what i used as an excuse
to explain many of the weird occurrences around the town.&nbsp; Anyway
back to the story, when i was 11 in the early hours of one saturday morning
i awoke to see a small boy a couple of years younger that me stood at the
sid of my bed starring down at me, i say starring even though he had no
eyes just black hollows, he seemed to be on the chubby side and wearing
a grey outfit.&nbsp; Thinking it was my nephew, as it was common for him
to stay over at the weekends, that had just startled me i grabbed my pillow
and swung at him only he wasn't there anymore and my nephew was asleep
on the blow up bed at the foothe living room i looked down the corridor
to the bathroom and saw a man peering round the door, thinking someone
had come through the front door, as it was left open to relieve the smell
of paint, i ran to confront the man only no one was there.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Grandmother</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Mharper29@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am 15 years old and I live in Pennsylvania. My parents told me
this story.</B>
<BR><B>My house is supposed to be haunted by the ghost of my greatgrandmother
who died in my home sitting in her rocking chair. This happened before
I was born.&nbsp; (my dad was about 10).&nbsp; Nobody was home.&nbsp; A
man came to the door. Knocked and of course no body answered.&nbsp; But
he didn't inderstand why because, he saw an old lady sitting in a rocking
chair.&nbsp; He came back to the house days later.&nbsp; He asked my grandfather
about the lady in the rocking chair.&nbsp; He descrbed her exactly as my
great grandmother was. It was years after her death.&nbsp; Could it have
been her???</B>
<BR><B>Another true story:</B>
<BR><B>I was 2 years old.&nbsp; My mom and dad came home from some kind
of formal dinner. My mother was wearing her good earings.&nbsp; Before
she went to bed she took them out and set them on the bathroom counter.&nbsp;
When she woke up they were gone.&nbsp; Since they were so expensive she
looked everywhere for them .&nbsp; My dad even looked inside the drains.
Nothing showed up.&nbsp; A few days later the earrings showed up exactly
as my mother had left them.&nbsp; It looked like grandma went out and needed
something to go with her necklace!!!!</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Friends Old House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Mark_Fuller15@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi my name is mark im 17 years old and i have been interested in
ghosts since i was around 7, my friend, who's name is james, bought this
old nursing house when he moved to england a few years back from canada.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have spent many night at his house and it is very big and also
very old he has a lot of old pictures and stuff and its kinda freaky when
your are walking around at night.</B>
<BR><B>One night i stayed at his house his mum and dad were not there they
had gone away for the weekend thats why i was staying coz he dosnt like
staying with his sister and her friends, so i came over and we were just
like mucking about listening to music, we were up stairs in his room and
we heard a really big thud, we just looked at eachother and waved it by
not taking any notice and then a little while later his sister and her
friend came running in REALLY shook up they were mumbling and practically
crying (they are about 3 years younger then us) and we asked them what
the matter was, they said they had seen a woman upstairs (they have three
floors, we were on th second) thinking this we thought that someone had
broken in to the house so we decided to go upstairs and have a look around.</B>
<BR><B>when we got upstairs the imediate thing that caught my attention
was that there was a strange smell and an eerie atmosphere and me being
interested in ghosts and all i thought to myself that they are some signs
it got a little colder too aswe went into his rooms upstairs and we searched
the upstairs very weel and we found nothing, we went back down sairs and
told his sister that we didnt see anyone, they were adiment they did and
they stayed downstairs with us that night because they were scared.</B>
<BR><B>That all happend around 10 o clock, a little further on into the
night me and james were still awake, and we sometimes go onto his roof
at night its liek a flat roof on the top of his house and we sit up there
we were sat up there just chatting and we heard another thud, at this point
i got really freaked out because i saw a shadow in a window below and we
were upstairs!</B>
<BR><B>james went really quiet and we got down onto a little slope to get
back in through the window and we saw middle aged woman stood at the closet
folding sheets, we froze, i couldnt believe what i was seeing we didnt
know this woman and i dont think she saw us but she walked around the corner
of the hallway and disapered, at this point we got in through the window
went downstairs turned on just about every light along the way and stayed
up all night, its the most frightening thing i have ever experienced</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Fathers Funeral</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: johnkyla@sbcglobal.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>My father passed away in september of 2001, he had been suffering
from severe emphysema for about 5 years. We were all torn up over him dying.
We were all at the cemetary for the grave side service. As soon as the
service was over, everyone heard this loud clop clop clop sound and the
sound over something dragging on the ground. I turned around to see what
was the commotion, There was a man wearing golf shoes( they have metal
cleats on them) carrying his golf bag and dragging another larger bag on
the ground, This was in the middle of a cemetary, there was no golf course
anywere near by,it was such a strange sight, My husband came up to me and
said that is a sign from your dad, ( belives there are always a sign at
a funeral) . My dad loved to play golf, when he got really sick he couldnt
play any more , he would play only on his pc. I Think he was letting everyone
know he was ok now.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Overseas Hauntings</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tiger_angel81@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;I have already had quite a few experiences with ghosts and
things of that kind. I strongly believe in ghosts so I believe that all
of my experiences are 100% true.</B>
<BR><B>When I was around 5 years old we lived in Bangkok, Thailand. We
had a great big apartment but my room always gave me the spooks. I would
never play by myself in it and if I ever wanted to do something in there
I would drag my mum in with me.</B>
<BR><B>One of our friends was very spiritual and was sort of a medium,
so my mother asked her to come into our house and tell us maybe what the
problem was (as she too - my mum - was a little frightened herself!). The
moment our friend stepped in she said she could sense something but it
wasn't going to do any harm to us. All we had to do was to tell it to go
to the light.</B>
<BR><B>Well I was too young to do it, my brothers and dad couldn't sense
it and my mum was too scared so we didn't do anything!</B>
<BR><B>Then one day, by chance, I was getting something from my room and
I could feel something. So, I looked up and there in front of me I saw
the back of a lady. She was wearing a pink dress and, as crazy as it sounds,
green skin. Her hand was placed on the light switch. Then all of a sudden
she just walked out and completly disappeared! I ran to my mum but she
was busy talking to a friend so didn't hear what I had said.</B>
<BR><B>After this event the feelings weren't as strong although they still
remained.</B>
<BR><B>Around&nbsp; 6 months later we moved to Bahrain (in the Middle East)
and when we were there I was drawing this picture of the family. I showed
it to my parents and I pointed out all the family members. Then they came
to this lady and they say</B>
<BR><B>"Whose that Sarah?"&nbsp; to which I replied</B>
<BR><B>"Oh thats the lady who lived in my bedroom."</B>
<BR><B>That was quite scary. Also when I lived in the UAE (Middle East)
the ghost who lived there would play games with me. It would hide a pen
which was positively there or close the curtains when I had just opened
them.</B>
<BR><B>When my uncle visited us he actually saw a small boy aat the end
of his bed, although I never saw anything.</B>
<BR><B>I have had various experiences where I can sense something there.</B>
<BR><B>Take the time I was at my mothers friends house and I needed to
go to the bathroom (I was about 8 or 9 years). So off I went, but I could
not for whatever reason go do my "buisness." So i ended up not going as
I kept getting that feeling someone was watching me.</B>
<BR><B>Later that evening we were talking about paranormal experiences
and the lady mentioned that the spirit of some family member of hers lived
in the house with them!</B>
<BR><B>So, those are basically my stories and there are probably many more
to come. Who knows...maybe I'm partially a sort of medium!!</B>

<P><B>Gym full of People</B><B></B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to share my experience with you because
I feel like my experience was real, but my friends don't think so. I went
to an abandoned building with a group of my friends. They said that it
was an old asilim but for mentaly retarded kids. Anyways, we traveled through
the halls, and I was a bit scared. We made our way into a gym. We turned
off our flash lights, then I felt the "people". When the lights went off
I felt like the whole gym filled with people. I felt closter -phobic because
of all the "people" I felt. I started to panic and had everyone turn on
their lights. Of course when the lights went on, my feeling of the "people'
was gone. I tried to explain why I flipped out, but all I got was disbeliefe.
I believe that what I felt wasn't in my mind, but rather something else
that I couldn't explain.</B>

<BR><B>Paranormal Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: danielfz@islandnet.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi!</B>
<BR><B>I'd like to share my own experience with the paranormal.</B>
<BR><B>When I was a Boy Scout way back in 1964 in Malaysia where I was
living at</B>
<BR><B>that time, a group of us kids were camping in the school field.
Our school</B>
<BR><B>was far away from the small town of Kluang in the state of Johore
and the</B>
<BR><B>field was beside a jungle and there were a few houses some distance
from the</B>
<BR><B>school. At around midnight, a few of us walked over to the school
buildings</B>
<BR><B>which was atop a hill, to coolect water. As we were collecting the
water in</B>
<BR><B>the pails, some of us sensed some activity in the hall facing us.
The lights</B>
<BR><B>were and fans were going on and off and there eerie human sounds
in it. I</B>
<BR><B>did not see or hear anything though I remember the others being
very silent</B>
<BR><B>as they collected the water. Later in the huge tent, they talked
about it</B>
<BR><B>and I just dismissed it as a figment of the imagination.</B>
<BR><B>Later that night, I was sleeping and then turned and faced the long
row of</B>
<BR><B>classrooms. Our tent was open at the sides as we were in the tropics
where</B>
<BR><B>nights are quite warm. Suddenly I realised that I was witnessing
something</B>
<BR><B>unusual. There were about twelve classrooms and all the lights were
going on</B>
<BR><B>and off like some one was playing with the switches from a central</B>
<BR><B>switchboard, though there was nothing like that. Each classroom
had its</B>
<BR><B>individual switch and it's impossible for anyone to be playing with
all the</B>
<BR><B>switches at the same time!</B>
<BR><B>Our school was requisitioned by the Japanese army during the Second
World</B>
<BR><B>War and some grisly executions took place there. Some bodies were
excavated</B>
<BR><B>when a new playing field was being built in the 50s.</B>
<BR><B>Thank you.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Aunt and Grandad's Story</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: DarkWolf7083@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This story isnt really mine but some things that have happened to
my aunt and</B>
<BR><B>my grandad.</B>
<BR><B>the earlist one happened to her when she was really little her granny
was</B>
<BR><B>sick and one night she was awake in bed and saw the door open and
a shadowy</B>
<BR><B>figure walk over to her. she was so scared she couldnt move or speak.
The</B>
<BR><B>figure came over to her sat down by her bed and put an arm round
her. As soon</B>
<BR><B>as it put an arm round her she knew it was her granny coz they had
been</B>
<BR><B>really close. The figure soon faded away and her dad had come in
and told her</B>
<BR><B>her granny had just died in hospital.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;this happened to my aunt when she was a tennager she worked
at this hospital</B>
<BR><B>ward for the summer. So one night her and her friends are outside
after clean</B>
<BR><B>up and suddenly a doctor comes round and starts shouting at them
for knocking</B>
<BR><B>the doors to the doctor on call house. They of course said they
werent so the</B>
<BR><B>doctor brings them inside the house. Nothing happened for a few
minutes and</B>
<BR><B>someone went to the window to look at the door when suddenly the
whole room</B>
<BR><B>shakes and a banging starts on the walls floors and ceiling. They
all freak</B>
<BR><B>out and run home. It turned out the doctors building used to be
a convent and</B>
<BR><B>in convents they bless the seal on the baptistmal font, But when
the new</B>
<BR><B>house had been built they knocked it down and so broke the seal.
Its now a</B>
<BR><B>new chapel and the knocking has stopped.</B>
<BR><B>Another thing that happened to her was when she was staying at this
old ward</B>
<BR><B>(she was a trainee nurse) her sister (who was staying there with
her) came</B>
<BR><B>running into her room middle of the night and started saying she
had this</B>
<BR><B>really freaky dream about all these monks standing round her. My
aunt thought</B>
<BR><B>someone had told her a story because the ward used to be an old
monastry and</B>
<BR><B>so agreed to sleep with her to make sure she was safe. That night
she had the</B>
<BR><B>same dream that her sister had had and they both woke at the same
time. An</B>
<BR><B>old story said that a monk had died in that bed and it was custom
for the</B>
<BR><B>rest for the monks to gather round the death bed and chant.</B>
<BR><B>Freaky isnt it maybe my aunt is just more atuned to the paranormal&nbsp;
and isnt</B>
<BR><B>it strange that the last two happened on holy gorund but the next
one</B>
<BR><B>happened to my granda about 4 years ago just after my granny died.</B>
<BR><B>It was up in donegal and my granda was alone in the living room
when suddenly</B>
<BR><B>he felt this persence there at first he was alarmed but the presence
was</B>
<BR><B>familiar and he realised it was his wife. The presence stayed there
for a</B>
<BR><B>while as if it was saying goodbye then left. Now my granda used
to make up</B>
<BR><B>ghost stories to scare us when we were little but he would never
joke about</B>
<BR><B>something like this.</B>
<BR><B>I just wanted to share these stories with you maybe it will help
you</B>
<BR><B>understand a little more about your experiences</B>

<P><B>More of the Pere Cheney Cemetary</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: nycki@bikinikill.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I had sent in one of my experiences about the cemetary in Pere Cheney
and I have yet another one. My friend and I decided to drive out to the
cemetary after being bored with watching mindless babble on the TV. We
took her Jeep because it handles better in the snow and because I feel
safer in her vehicle. Anyway, we pulled into the clearing and noticed that
the gate was chained and locked so no motor vehicles could get in, which
I think is a good idea. There was a space that we could walk through so
we decided to walk around the cemetary for a bit. Like I said before about
the cemetary, there are only a few headstones left and there is a large
circle drive. We were at the far end of the lot, the farthest we could
be without being in the woods when the headlights of Alex's Jeep turned
on and the horn started to beep repeatedly. She doesn't have a car alarm
and she had the keys in her pocket. We ran pell-mell to the Jeep and got
inside even though the car was still freaking out. We weren't really scared,
just VERY exhilerated. Alex threw the Jeep into drive and hauled butt out
of there! All the commotion stopped as soon as she and I had opened the
doors. I really wish that we would have stayed out there, but who knows
what would have happened next. The only other strange thing that happened
when we were crossing the railroad tracks, it sounded like someone had
jumped on the roof of the car. Alex floored it and we didn't hear it anymore.
I think I'll stay away from the cemetary for a while :-P</B><B></B>

<P><B>More Ghosts in Florida</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Rusty1218@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Thank you so much for adding my story to your files. Here,s more
from the same House.I actually forgot to mention a lot of other things
that occured. My 7 year old Daughter was sitting alone in the House, across
from the sofa ,is the Garagedoor my Sis in law and me where outside of
the House and all of sudden, my Daughter comes running out of the House
crying and totally scared. When i asked what was wrong, she said that the
Garage door opened by itself and she could see 2 legs and half of a mans
body, standing halfway in the doorway and she dont want to go back in there
by herself. When my two girls where younger, my Son took a photo of my
then 2 year old and her older sister and me . When i looked at the photo
later , I saw a skull at the corner ,like almost on the floor and something
that looks like a small child standing in the closet. It looks like it
is illuminated in a light. I can't find the Photo. Also, I hung a Rosary
from my Lampshade for protection. This rosary was from my Holy Communion.
For some reason it vanished to. Some times i can feel 2 hands pushing slightly
down on my lower legs ,when i am in bed. Because i go to bed mostly at
last of all people in this House.We had a dog that belonged to my sis in
law ,and sometimes&nbsp; the dog would stand at the end of the Stairs and
bark and bark at something that I could not see. My shower wall shows now
a skull with a hat on . Yes i know it sounds totally of the Rocker but
it just recently formed, and it looks very real . I will take a photo of
it and when I have a chance ,I will post all my Ghost photos on this Website.By
the way my son went recently to the Stranahan House in Florida on a Fieldtrip,
and when he came Home he said that he did not feel very comfy in that House
especially at the stairs that lead to the upper rooms.There is also another
interesting Story . In the Everglades is a old shack, that belonged to
a man named Trapper Nelson. He lived there all alone, all that remains
is the Shack and no one is allowed to go out there alone . A Story has
it ,that 2 men did go out there and one of them was badly injured by "something
" that the believe was Trapper Nelson telling them to get of his little
island.If&nbsp; I have more Happenings I keep you updated.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Memphis Morgue</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: SgtBuk1@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>Recently, I was visiting the morgue in Memphis, TN while filming
a</B>
<BR><B>documentary on forensics. We were on a break when one of the morgue
workers</B>
<BR><B>turned around and said, "Did someone call my name?" I assured her
that is</B>
<BR><B>wasn't me and she said, "I must be losing it." I replied, "Well,
look where</B>
<BR><B>you work!" Her face became serious and in a whisper she said, "That's
not</B>
<BR><B>funny." She went on to relate a creepy tale. While working the night
shift</B>
<BR><B>she began hearing doors opening and closing all over the building.
Her</B>
<BR><B>co-worker, the only other living person in the building, grew pale
and</B>
<BR><B>admitted he'd heard it too.</B>
<BR><B>If you live in Memphis, please lobby your mayor to raise the budget
for the</B>
<BR><B>morgue. They have no janitorial services, the floor is never mopped
and you</B>
<BR><B>can just imagine how it smells in there. There are living folks
who work</B>
<BR><B>there, they deserve better.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Little Visitor</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: thehomelessturtle@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>We moved into our new house about 8 months ago, and I decided to
live in the</B>
<BR><B>basement since it was roomy and private. Ever since i moved down
there,</B>
<BR><B>myself and my dog always kind of noticed that we weren't alone,
kind of like</B>
<BR><B>we were being observed or watched. My door to go upstairs would
generally</B>
<BR><B>remain open, suddenly closing by itself. I never thought anything
of it,</B>
<BR><B>thinking that someone made a small breeze as they went up the stairs
beside</B>
<BR><B>it. But the times this past winter that I would leave it open at
night to</B>
<BR><B>get some extra heat down there, it would suddenly close. Since I'm
a night</B>
<BR><B>owl, I started to notice that it would happen generally around 2
in the</B>
<BR><B>morning when I would be watching a movie. My dog would always wake
up at</B>
<BR><B>this time too, staring at the stairs like something was there. I
tried not</B>
<BR><B>to be</B>
<BR><B>freaked out about it until I started to notice a kind of cold breeze
by my</B>
<BR><B>ear when I would be trying to sleep. I chalked that up to the window
above</B>
<BR><B>my bed...until I felt it.. On one particular night, I was having
a restless</B>
<BR><B>night, tossing about my bed. I had my back to the stairs that led
to my</B>
<BR><B>door, and I think that my shirt must've riden up a bit. I have a
tattoo on</B>
<BR><B>my lower back of a sun, at it was at my lower back where I felt
it. Since I</B>
<BR><B>wasn't sleeping too well anyways, I was half awake when it started.
I felt a</B>
<BR><B>small pressure on my back which at first I thought was my dog since
she</B>
<BR><B>likes to cuddle into me on cold nights. What got me awake was the
fact that</B>
<BR><B>it felt</B>
<BR><B>consideralby colder than the air around the room, and it started
to trace</B>
<BR><B>the inside circle of the sun. I was so scared I couldn't move, I
could</B>
<BR><B>barely think. It was a gentle pressure, like one a child would inflict.
My</B>
<BR><B>dog started to growl at me and the pressure stopped immediately.
After a few</B>
<BR><B>minutes to gather my courage I turned on</B>
<BR><B>my lamp and ran upstairs. That was just the first experience. Over
the</B>
<BR><B>period of two weeks, I noticed that my dream catcher that a friend
of mine</B>
<BR><B>gave to me before we moved would start to sway on the wall. My stereo
would</B>
<BR><B>turn on and off, like someone was curious about it. One night i
actually saw</B>
<BR><B>it. I was studying for my diploma exam and out of the corner of
my eye i saw</B>
<BR><B>what appeared to be a little boy standing in the doorway to the
cellar. He</B>
<BR><B>looked like he was about 5 years old and native. Although the house
is new,</B>
<BR><B>it was built on fairly undeveloped land that used to be wooded and
home to</B>
<BR><B>the natives way back when. After having seen him I became a little
less</B>
<BR><B>aprehensive about the occurances in my room. I remebering that after</B>
<BR><B>watching a show on spirits that were lost or didn't know that they
were</B>
<BR><B>dead, I</B>
<BR><B>decided that maybe i should tell him that he was dead, and he needed
to move</B>
<BR><B>on to his Creator. It made me sad to do this, since after seeing
him and</B>
<BR><B>knowing that he never did cause any harm, i was going to tell him
to go</B>
<BR><B>away. But this past month I accepted that it was something that
needed to be</B>
<BR><B>done. I waited until he made his</B>
<BR><B>presence known via my dreamcatcher moving, and told him that he
had died and</B>
<BR><B>he needed to go on to the "light", that his family was waiting for
him. This</B>
<BR><B>is now three weeks since and my dog is at ease and nothing has occured
in</B>
<BR><B>the basement. I think he's gone, but I guess time will tell. I kind
of miss</B>
<BR><B>him, but no way is he coming back.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Indian Girl?</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: butros446@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>There is a piece of property that a good friend of mine now lives
by. For years I had heard that people had seen an Indian girl walking around.
I have always believed in ghosts because I have heard weird things in my
house. But my dad told me something that made me a firm believer in this
"Indian Girl". My dad is on the fire department of my town and there was
an old abandoned house they were going to burn down as a practice burn.
They turned their hoses on, everything was going well but suddenly all
the gauges said they didn't have any water pressure. This was weird because
water was shooting out of their hoses and the pumps were running fine.
Right when the house was set ablaze, however, the gauges instantly started
working properly.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple
of years after this happened, my friend moved in there. I knew there was
something in those woods and I planned to find out. on October 7, 2000,
they threw a Holloween party. MY mom had her Sony mavica camera with her.
I had read numerous times on this site that those are good for ghost pics.
A bunch of friends and I went out there. We ended up with less people than
we set out with since some of them were young and insisted they come with.
We started out by scanning the area with the screen trying to spot something.
That didn't work. Then the batteries suddenly went dead. Knowing that was
a sign of activity I suggested we leave. We ended up running away. About
a hundred feet down the road, the batteries came back, as suddenly as they
died. we watched the power for a second and they went dead again suggesting
that the "Indian Girl" was following us. We were a little scared and went
inside for awhile and ate some food and drank some pop.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We of course went back again. This time we saw some weird stuff on the
screen that wasn't there when looked at with the eye. I saw this weird
looking orange glowing figure in the screen. I looked up and I couldn't
see it. I looked at the screen and it was still there. My friend is yelling
at me to take the picture but right as I was about to push the button,
the glow disappeared. Shortly after that, we heard a girl's scream. We
couldn't be sure if it was a spirit or not because there was a party not
that far away with little girls there.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day a DIFFERENT
friend and I went to the woods. this wasn't as scary because it was in
the daytime. we brought his movie camera there and we heard the same scream
suggesting that the scream I heard was the Indian Girl. That was the last
time I have been there, but I plan to go back.</B>

<P><B>Gravity Hill and The Slaughterhouse</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: alyshaweeks@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My story takes place in the middle of January in Northern California
at a</B>
<BR><B>place called Gravity Hill. A few friends and I were at a party at
my best</B>
<BR><B>friend J's house. We had somehow gotten around to telling ghost
stories when</B>
<BR><B>J told us about a place called Gravity Hill. The legend is this:
Around the</B>
<BR><B>1920's Gravity Hill is where the KKK used to meet. There's an old
abandoned</B>
<BR><B>looking barn on top of the hill that everyone calls "The Slaughterhouse".</B>
<BR><B>Supposedly, a young black couple was driving the road along the
hill one</B>
<BR><B>night when they were ambushed by the clan. The story says that they
were</B>
<BR><B>dragged from the vehicle and the young woman was raped and murdered
while</B>
<BR><B>the man was made to watch. Then the man was hung from the ridgepole
of the</B>
<BR><B>barn as a warning to others. J also told us that supposedly, if
you go out</B>
<BR><B>to Gravity Hill at night and drive backwards halfway up Gravity
Hill and</B>
<BR><B>then put your car in neutral.. you'll continue to go UP Gravity
Hill.</B>
<BR><B>I had to try this so I convinced my fiancee, B, and J's boyfriend
and his</B>
<BR><B>best friend to go with us. J refused to go. She swore that the place
was</B>
<BR><B>evil and begged us not to go. Like stupid teenagers from any horror
movie we</B>
<BR><B>ignored her and left.</B>
<BR><B>J's boyfriend and his friend followed B and I to the hill. When
we got there</B>
<BR><B>I had this sudden feeling of foreboding. I don't know if this was
because of</B>
<BR><B>the way the place looked. Dark hills, low laying fog, pitch black
night,</B>
<BR><B>lonely, deserted road... or if there was in fact a presence there.
We</B>
<BR><B>continued up the road, sometimes passing each other to talk back
and forth.</B>
<BR><B>I remember that the air outside felt heavy.I don't know how else
to describe</B>
<BR><B>this other than it felt like a humidity even though it was the middle
of</B>
<BR><B>January and freezing outside. When we got to the hill, B and I did
as we had</B>
<BR><B>been told and backed up the hill slowly and then put the truck-
for all who</B>
<BR><B>are interested, B has a Chevy Scottsdale 1986- in neutral. I will
never</B>
<BR><B>forget the look on B's face when we began to steadily continue up
the hill.</B>
<BR><B>We managed to slide the truck back into drive and we floored it
out of</B>
<BR><B>there, barely waiting for J's boyfriend and friend to catch up.
The last</B>
<BR><B>thing I saw though was the scariest of all... I turned once to look
back</B>
<BR><B>through the window to see if J's boyfriends truck was behind us.
I didn't</B>
<BR><B>see the truck but I did see a young woman without a face and shrouded
in a</B>
<BR><B>dirty looking brown blanket sitting in the back of B's truck. She
turned her</B>
<BR><B>head to look at me and then she wasn't there anymore. I told B to
go faster</B>
<BR><B>and I've never gone back.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Grandma's House of Horror</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ALVIN ROGERS [12AR@msn.com]</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>My grandmas house was very scary when I was a little girl and I still
remember everything that went on. Well i will have to upload some pictures
of me when I was little and there are lots of orbes. When I was little
I remember walking in the hallway and see shadows walk by. My mom has a
story too. when I was in her tummy she was laying down on a bed with my
real father and she saw outside the door (the door was open) a figure standing
there and it was like a shadow form( no one else was home either). then
my grandma said she saw the grim reaper. my mom also heard a knock on her
bedroom door so she opened it and no one was there her mom (my grandma)
and dad (my grandpa) were gone and her little brother (my uncle) was outside
playing with his friends and even if someone was there no one could go
knock on the doors because there were lots of boxes there. but also I would
feel someone watching over me and it wasn't a good present it was a present
of evil. Then one time my grandma said she was walking in the kitchen and
all of a sudden it felt like someone was in the ground pulling her leg.
Then sometimes I would remember stuff moving in different places. my grandmas
house is filled with evil but not that bad rite now. Then one time my mom
played the Quiji board in her room with some friends and her room was dark
and her curtains moved and her window was shut and there was no wind what
so ever. That is kind of my grandmas house of horror. Is the evil still
there??? Who knows.......</B><B></B>

<P><B>School Gym</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: vmsahblue@attbi.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I don't mind telling my real name, but I would rather keep my friends
privacy... So here it goes. In the letter I give you please change the
names.</B>
<BR><B>Me and my friends all go to the same high school, and went to the
same middle school. We were at the school at about 5PM because I had to
go to my little brothers soccer game. The game was outside, and me and
my friends were in the 2nd story gymnasium. We were having fun, throwing
basketballs in the vents, and listening to them tumble down the walls.
Tony wasn't doing it, so we started making fun of him for being a wuss.</B>
<BR><B>It wasn't long before he just screamed "Shut up!" at us. When he
yelled, we all looked at him, and then what happened was really odd. It
was like something threw him. He skid across the floor about 8 feet, and
there was no possible way that he could have jumped like that. Right when
he hit the floor, the double doors leading to the stairs swung open. Scared
the living **** out of all of us.</B>
<BR><B>I should tell you why I think this happened. When the school first
opened, there was a regular faculty, consisting of janitors, teachers,
etc. One of the janitors, I don't know what his name was, but he was very
tall and overweight. He had a heart attack in the 2nd story gym, and died.
A teacher who has been working at that school tells all her classes about
it, because she tried to do CPR and save him, but she failed. If anything,
it must've been the ghost or something of that janitor. Well, hope you
liked my story.</B>

<BR><B>Glenville State College</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mirandanicole@rtol.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I go to Glenville State College in a small town in central West Virginia.
The two dorms on our campus are very haunted. I live in Pickens Hall and
on every floor you can hear someone dropping marbles above you. I live
on the 6th floor, which is the top floor, and you can still hear someone
dropping marbles.Not only this, but people always hear furniture and things
being moved in the room over top of them. I am an RA and the RA underneath
me always says that she hears me moving furniture in my room on the weekends
and I am never here. Plus, I live in a suite, which is comprised of four
rooms and I am the only one in my suite, but we always hear furniture and
footsteps in the room beside me and nobody lives in that room.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is also a ghost of a woman on the steps of the dorms. I have never
seen her, but one of my fellow RA's has. When he saw her, he couldn't talk
for about an hour, he just sat down and shivered. People have had experiences
of the doors to their rooms being opened, even though they were locked
from the inside and nobody was standing in the hallway.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second dorm, which has recently been abandoned,
is called Louis Bennet Hall. The story is that back when the college started,
Sarah "Sis" Linn was a local preachers daughter and their house was located
where Clark Hall is now. Anyway, supposedly Sis Linn was raped by the men
who lived in Louis Bennet Hall and then killed. She haunts the halls looking
for her killer. Before Louis Bennet Hall was abandoned, the dorm was a
completly a mens dorm. They would wake up in the middle of the night to
an apparition standing by their bed or sitting on the bed.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While these haunting are bad, this is not the
only haunting on our small campus. Our Administration Building has a clock
tower in it. And, on Halloween Night, the clock will strike 13 times at
midnight. I know this is true because I have witnessed it.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are all the hauntings on the campus that
I can think of at this time.</B>
<BR><B>Thank you.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Glass Breaking</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: bwolnowski@covad.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was about 12 years old, I was home sick (from school), my
mother had come home to take care of me. After we ate lunch we were watching
T.V. when we heard the sound of our water cooler falling over and the glass
bottle on top breaking. The sound was very loud and very distinguished.
We went down stairs thinking we would have to clean up some broken glass
(water cooler bottles used to be made of glass) and nothing was broken
at all. It wasn't a frightening experience at all......untill. About seven
years later a friend and my self were sharing ghost stories we have heard
in the past, and he began telling me of a story one of his teachers had
told him. The wife of the teacher had a hobbie of preserving fruits and
veggies, she hed a huge shelf with hundreds of glass jars in her basement.
One day while she was upstairs she heard the shelf fall over and months
of work come crashing to the floor. Upon hearing this she grabbed a broom
and cleaning supplies before she went down to her celler to check it out,
so sure of what had just happened. When she got downstairs not a jar was
broken and the shelf was just as she left it. I thought this was a creepy
coincidence with the "glass breaking" sounds. It didn't scare me untill
years after my experience</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Ghostly Wedding</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Shellchic1@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>When I turned 12 my dad,little sis,and I went up to this little cabin.
The</B>
<BR><B>night before we left,around midnight, I got up to go to the outhouse.
It was</B>
<BR><B>ppitch blach and no wind and in the woods, so my mind started to
play games</B>
<BR><B>with me. You know squirrels turn into axe murders,that sort of thing.
So I</B>
<BR><B>reached the outhouse without having a heart attack. Once i was done
I started</B>
<BR><B>the hike back to the cabin. I decided to walk through the church
this time</B>
<BR><B>though. That&nbsp; was a big mistake. I stepped in between the last
pews and there</B>
<BR><B>was this little jump in the air around me. Suddenly the pews were
full of</B>
<BR><B>people. There was a wedding going on. I could see the bride and
groom up</B>
<BR><B>front. It scared me so bad I tripped and fell out of the pew line.
Everything</B>
<BR><B>disapeared. So I stood up and stared like a idiot. And being the
stupid that</B>
<BR><B>I am,I walked into it agian. Agian,little jump and all the people
appeared.</B>
<BR><B>This time I walked up a few rows. Suddenly all the "people" quit
talking and</B>
<BR><B>stared at me. Then I realized they were see through! They seemed
solid but</B>
<BR><B>they were clear. So try to imagine this. A 12 year old girl standing
iin the</B>
<BR><B>middle of a ghostly wedding in her PJ's and a jacket!!! then the
Groom</B>
<BR><B>started toward. This was a big bear of a guy. This time I ran out
of the pew</B>
<BR><B>line and up to the cabin the long way. The next morning I went out
to the</B>
<BR><B>church agian and nothing happened. ever agian.</B>

and I and his son and my daughter were all watching tv..boyfriend got up
and went to bed and his son and my daughter and I stayed up and watched
more tv...I got up to go to bed and left them in the livingroom and when
I went and got ready for bed,light on, I sat down on the bed and turned
toward the bedroom door because I felt like someone was coming in the room,
a female came straight through the room toward&nbsp; the bathroom,no exit.I
thought it was my daughter because she looked a lot like her, when I got
up to check there was no one in my end of the trailer except us..After
that, everytime I came in the room the water would come on in my garden
tub.Then the water started coming on in the sink..this went on for several
months...then one day it just stopped. But the woman had on a blouse with
a high collar with buttons up the front, hair pulled up behind her ears,
clear pale complextion and little turned up nose, she never looked at me
directly but I never felt afraid. Don't know what to think of this and
I no longer live in that trailer but I do believe in ghost now...Thanks

<P><B>Nursing Home</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: duh3@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>You see in my home town there is this nursing home. It used to be
a hospital. Well back in 1953 a little girl was hit and killed by a truck.
The old morgue was in the basment of the hospital its still there but its
a storage room now. But anyway the little girl was brought to the hospital.
She had died at the scene but they still tried to revive here at the hospital.
Well one day last week this lady brought the news article in so we could
read it. I don't work there but my mom does. I am into ghost hunting and
had heard the stories that this little girl was still haunting and all
sorts of stuff had happened.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well the lady went into her
office with two other people and they were talking. Well the lady saw something
out of the corner of her eye and looked up. The mouse on her computer was
moving itself and the cursor on the screen went into the start menu and
something brought up the solitare game. It started to play and the lady
got control of the mouse and closed out the solitar game. Then the mouse
fought back and took the mouse and shut the computer down and threw the
mouse on the floor. One of the residence who was sitting by the door started
laughing and said You made her mad. And then the lady went away.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard about this and went to talk to the resident
and she said that a little girl slept above her bathroom door everynight.
Then she smiled and laughed and said as i was leaving "by the way she is
right behind you. And as i left i felt something walking next to me all
the way to the door. I went to leave and heard a faint good bye and i got
into my car and was driving away and looked up and saw the something inside
the door fade away. She was letting me know she was there. And now i go
back and i feel someone walking next to me.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; And in the basement i always hear footsteps as i walk
towards the morgue and one time i heard a scream and in he boiler room
i had a pendulum since i am wiccan i used it. ANd it began swinging in
a circle and the ball began spinning and i felt a hand on my shoulder and
heard something say please you cant be in here. So i left. I later asked
what that room used to be and it was an old operation room. They said that
a young woman's son came in after being attacked by a dog and the woman
got in there and was watching as the life failed her son and the doctor
came to her and said Please you cant be in here. I guess everything in
that place relives it self. And everytime i am there with my friend i sit
at the nurses station and the elevator will come up and down by itself
and the door is always being held for someone. but also whenever i am standing
at the snack maching i will feel something touch my back.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; And one time I took a resedent down the get her some
fredos and she look up the hall towards the morgue and said Who is that
standing there i don't recognize them. I said where? they said there in
the nurses uniform she has one of those hats on and everything. Later that
day i was looking at an old photo album with this same lady and she was
like thats the lady who was standing at the door. I looked it up and Her
name was Anna Trent and she died in 1975. So there is some pretty restless
spirits here. But i never have felt fear just sadness. I also feel like
i am being watched all the time down there. But i just try to act natural
cause i found out if you act scared they do more to scare you. SO thanks
for reading this i hope to post more..</B><B></B>

I have</B>

woke up to see a</B>
<BR><B>figure standing at the foot of my bed.&nbsp; I remeber seeing the
gray flowing</B>
<BR><B>body of this "figure", but what scared me was that it had red eyes
and was</B>
<BR><B>staring at me.&nbsp; My brother was asleep in the bed next to me,

<P><B>Dreams</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>By: bmr48720@rogers.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>In June 1995, I was living common-law with my girlfriend in Toronto,
Ontario</B>
<BR><B>Canada. Before What I believe today to be a near death experience
I didn't</B>
<BR><B>believe in life after death or anything of that nature.</B>
<BR><B>I was laying down in my bed I had just seen my girlfriend off to
work on this</B>
<BR><B>what seemed to be another average Sunday morning around 8am.</B>
<BR><B>I had aparently fallen asleep again and suddenly I was where I grew
up Just</B>
<BR><B>behind my second story apartment in a park where I had lived for
about the first</B>
<BR><B>10yrs of my life.</B>
<BR><B>I was walking in the park holding hands with a young lady about
5' 7" tall (my</B>
<BR><B>height) with shoulder length curly hair.</B>
<BR><B>The interesting part was she was shadowed off so I couldn't identify
what she</B>
<BR><B>looked like. We were walking towards a light that would be the sun
above the</B>
<BR><B>treeline just ahead of us. she was on my rightside and on the other
side of her</B>
<BR><B>was a wall about her height of roses. The scent of roses was in
the air and the</B>
<BR><B>unbelieable sence of comfort and peace.</B>
<BR><B>This experience lasted no more than two minutes and than I awoke.</B>
<BR><B>Now December 1996, I was living with a roommate in a basement apartment
for</B>
<BR><B>about four months. My bedroom had no windows with the door shut
it was like</B>
<BR><B>you're in a closet.</B>
<BR><B>Again I had layed down in the afternoon for a nap and I had closed
my bedroom</B>
<BR><B>door for privacy.</B>
<BR><B>I was suddenly woken up by someone opening my bedroom door. There
standing in</B>
<BR><B>the doorway was I believe was this young lady again. She was shadowed
off but</B>
<BR><B>light from the kitchen behind her outlined her curly Light colored
hair.</B>
<BR><B>We played this staring game for a moment. Without a word being said
I got out of</B>
<BR><B>bed and attempted to aproach her but she closed the door. By the
time I made it</B>
<BR><B>to the doorway where she stood she was gone again as brief a visit
as before.</B>
<BR><B>Since, I've seen her two more times, each time she has embrassed
me with a hug.</B>
<BR><B>the last time I could feel her breath as she whisped softly in my
right ear but</B>
<BR><B>I don't remember what she had said.</B>
<BR><B>I would appreciate feedback after sharing this experience with you.</B>

<P><B>Ghost in Florida</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Rusty1218@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is my Story nothing is made up . My Husband and I moved to Florida
about 12 years ago. The first week we lived in the House he and his Sister
bought, he was the one who had the first Experience . The Bedroom Furniture
did not arrive yet ,so his Sis let us stay in her Bedroom. At about 4 am,&nbsp;
I awoke because he pinched me in the side very hard. What is wrong with
you ? I asked. What are you doing outside the bed ? The next Morning, he
told me that he had seen a dark hooded Figure standing at my Bedside looking
down at ,me and as he awoke it looked at him turned around and walked out
of the bedroom.To make shure that i was in bed and he was not dreaming,
he had to pinch me i guess.The next&nbsp; night we slept with the lights
on , but nothing happened. Then my Hubby got his new job and i was home
alone sitting on the sofa that faced part to the outside into the Backyard,
as I saw a Man walking from the Backyard fence up to the House Wall , just
to vanish into it. I told my sis in law and my Husband as they came home
. Nothing happened for 1 Year. Our Son was born soon after, and when he
was 6 month old i had to change his clothes, we where both upstairs, when
i heard a Male voice, in a really mean way "What do you really want"?.
I was so shocked that i grabbed my Son and went downstairs for the rest
of the Day . My Sister in law, was awaken by something shaking her on her
Shoulders in the middle of the Night, when she turned on the lights there
was noone.Most of the Hauntings happened to me . I believe&nbsp; that I
am the Source and the or it wants to talk to me . For what reason I don't
know. Just recently i had a frightening&nbsp; Experience. It was 5:30 am
and i had to be at work by 6am, so i had a quick Snack . As I was sitting
in the Rockingchair, i heard some Footsteps coming down the Stairs but
there was nobody, the Footsteps kept going and my Hair stood up in my Neck.
The other&nbsp; Mornig when i had to go early again to work, the Ghost
blew my on my Hair on the side of my Head as I was sitting on the Sofa..
This goes on for so long, that I wish that i could see" it". or at least
hear " it" one more Time.&nbsp; All i could find out is , that this used
to be Swampland ans after they made the Swampland dry, they grew Orange
groves.&nbsp; My Husbands Father passed away 3 years ago . By Incident
i have him or his Spirit on Camera going up the Stairs to our Bedroom.
Then i have Photos with a little blue Orb and a bigger one in white color
. Also i have&nbsp; a Photo with me and my 2 Daughters standing in the
Livingroom and a shadow like skull on the bottom of the Photo plus it looks
like a litte girl in a Sailor Dress standig behind us in the Closet(the
closetdoor is open).That's the Story. If anything new happened i let u
know.</B>

<P><B>Ghost in Chicamauga</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Tennzone7b@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>i grew up in a house just outside the chicamauga battlefield. i had
heard of</B>
<BR><B>the story of green eyes, the man who jumped from wilder tower in
the 1970's,</B>
<BR><B>i had seen a white figure coming out of the park at night just past
the</B>
<BR><B>museum towards fort oglethorpe. (later that night, though-i also
saw a man in</B>
<BR><B>a van driving home in a kkk getup......)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no one
ever wants to be in the</B>
<BR><B>park at night , as if the park rangers wouldnt catch you almost
before you</B>
<BR><B>could even get out of your car. i spent alot of time in that house
alone</B>
<BR><B>growing up. a friend and i decided to use a quija board one night.
i used a</B>
<BR><B>small communion glass for a pointer and in some weird way , we thought
it</B>
<BR><B>would protect us. we faced each other in chairs with our knees touching,
but</B>
<BR><B>the glass flew off the board without our hands touching the board.
i had also</B>
<BR><B>risked being in the park at night with this friend at a location
known as</B>
<BR><B>snodgrass hill. this is one of those places reputed to make your
car roll up</B>
<BR><B>hill. though how someone could get their car up there without being
arrested</B>
<BR><B>is beyond me , so i cant confirm that. but i do know my friend and
i heard</B>
<BR><B>the sound of a chainsaw at 3o'clock in the morning. as far as my
house goes,</B>
<BR><B>many things happened there that i cant explain. books fell from
my closet for</B>
<BR><B>no reason, lights turned off and on, the stereo in the living room
coming on</B>
<BR><B>by itself. one night , while my sister and father were away- i sat
down in</B>
<BR><B>front of the tv with a sandwhich to watch (of all things) "tales
from the</B>
<BR><B>darkside". i had a very large cat at the time who liked to get up
on my</B>
<BR><B>dresser in front&nbsp; of my mirror. i had a lot of trinkets on
the dresser, so i</B>
<BR><B>could hear the sounds of my cat hanging out on my dresser. also,
the door was</B>
<BR><B>warped and the lockset was damaged. i would have to pick the door
up somewhat</B>
<BR><B>by the knob and pull it firmly to close it. in other words, there
was no way</B>
<BR><B>to shut the door quietly.&nbsp; after a time , i went into my room
because i heard</B>
<BR><B>something break. i went to check that my cat had not knocked over
a ceramic</B>
<BR><B>piece my mother had given me for christmas recently. everything
on my dresser</B>
<BR><B>was where i had left it and i did not see my cat in the room. i
was a little</B>
<BR><B>spooked, but i shut the door and went back to the tv. when i went
into the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen for more coke (if you were standing in front of the fridge-my
room</B>
<BR><B>would be right behind you, and the front door directly to your right)my</B>
<BR><B>bedroom door was open. i walked right into the room, looked around
, saw</B>
<BR><B>nothing -but became even more spooked and again - shut the door
, this time</B>
<BR><B>turning on the light, before leaving a few choice words behind me.&nbsp;
i watched</B>
<BR><B>the door as i went the kitchen to get a butcher knife(like that
would help).</B>
<BR><B>i then walked the few feet to the front door and faced it. i counted
to three</B>
<BR><B>and turned to look at my door. it was open and the light was off.
i freaked</B>
<BR><B>out, i dropped the knife- i struggled to unlock and open the front
doorlike</B>
<BR><B>the the idiot female victim #1 in a horror film. i got out, i&nbsp;
ran to my</B>
<BR><B>neighbors. before i could tell them what happened- they asked me
where my</B>
<BR><B>sister was, as they swore they saw someone running after me right
after i</B>
<BR><B>knocked. the knife i dropped was not found at the door where i had
dropped</B>
<BR><B>it. on another occasion, i had decided to sleep in another room
for the</B>
<BR><B>night. when i woke up , i saw what looked like a glass bust of a
man about 5</B>
<BR><B>feet from the floor with dust settled on it. it did not move or
speak , and</B>
<BR><B>disappeared quickly.&nbsp; on another occasion, i was sitting at
my kitchen table</B>
<BR><B>and i got the odd idea to place my fingertips on the table and concentrate
as</B>
<BR><B>if i were using a quija board. i closed my eyes, it seems as though
i blacked</B>
<BR><B>or may have lost a few minutes. what i remember most, is actually
hearing and</B>
<BR><B>feeling my backend hit the chair. as if i had landed in it.&nbsp;
on still another</B>
<BR><B>occasion- i was in my room trying to sleep. now my frame was so
old that i</B>
<BR><B>dismantled it and laid my matress on the floor. i laid it right
up aginst the</B>
<BR><B>wall to save space. there was a wall at the head of the bed and
on the inside</B>
<BR><B>of the bed. it was directly on the floor. what woke me up that night,
was the</B>
<BR><B>realization that my sheets were being pulled off of me towards the
wall and</B>
<BR><B>under my bed. slowly. i pulled them back up (and over my head) and
tried to</B>
<BR><B>ignore it. it didnt happen again. after that, i moved my bedroom
to another</B>
<BR><B>part of the house. the door to my old room would open on its own
sometimes,</B>
<BR><B>and in the dead of summer- (with the air off and windows open) i
could feel a</B>
<BR><B>cool breeze in the room. i could crack the door and put my hand
to it, and it</B>
<BR><B>would feel as though someone were blowing cold air on my hand. my
boyfriend</B>
<BR><B>at that time( who is now my husband) is the only other witness to&nbsp;
that</B>
<BR><B>"breeze". the final incident occured shortly before i moved out.
i was alone,</B>
<BR><B>it was night. i was washing my clothes . the washer machine is in
the hallway</B>
<BR><B>leading to my fathers room. washer machine on one side, the doors
to mine and</B>
<BR><B>my sisters room on the other. in other words, my door was directly
across the</B>
<BR><B>washer. i bent to put clothes in the dryer and heard&nbsp; the classic
creak of a</B>
<BR><B>door being opened slowly. when i turned around- yes, my door was
open. i was</B>
<BR><B>spooked, and i said- "stop that! you're scaring me! dont do that
again!!" . i</B>
<BR><B>shut the door , and moved out not too long afterwards.&nbsp; i have
asked my</B>
<BR><B>father and sister if they were playing a trick on me , and to this
day - they</B>
<BR><B>say no. ( and look at me like i'm crazy).&nbsp; as for the door,
i had mentioned</B>
<BR><B>it could not be closed quietly, or opened quietly either for that
matter.</B>
<BR><B>yet, it opened three times without a sound. and i said i counted
to three the</B>
<BR><B>last time the door opened. it seems to me, that someone could open
the door</B>
<BR><B>quietly if they did it slowly and carefully enough. but in three
seconds? not</B>
<BR><B>likely. i saw my father and sister leave and all the doors and windows
were</B>
<BR><B>locked. including the front door i ran out of.&nbsp; as for the
quija board and</B>
<BR><B>the holy communion glass, i have some kind of idea that either something</B>
<BR><B>resented the object i has chosen or that God Himself disagreed.
as for the</B>
<BR><B>chainsaw on snodgrass hill, what can i say? who does yardwork at
three in the</B>
<BR><B>morning in a national park? my mother ( who lived nearby at the
time) always</B>
<BR><B>told me she thought it wa smy grandmother and her mother. she said
sometimes</B>
<BR><B>the house would become cold for no reason , and that she would sometimes</B>
<BR><B>smell lemon verbena sachet.&nbsp; which my grandmother wore.&nbsp;
she died so early in</B>
<BR><B>my life that i cannot remember her. but that explaination contradicts
covers</B>
<BR><B>being pulled off my nude body as i slept, and the appearance of
a man at the</B>
<BR><B>foot of the bed i was sleeping in.&nbsp; none of these things ever
happened in</B>
<BR><B>front of my sister or father. though my sister can recall the hallway
lights</B>
<BR><B>turning off and on by themselves one day while my mother was cutting
grass.</B>
<BR><B>all of these things happened while i was alone in the house. my
husband is my</B>
<BR><B>only witness, as he felt the breeze coming from my old room and
heard</B>
<BR><B>unexplainable sounds at night that neither of us wanted to investigate.</B>
<BR><B>apparently, whatever it was- left the house when i did.&nbsp; and
still , anyone</B>
<BR><B>with any sense- will not be caught in the&nbsp; park after dark.</B>

<P><B>Ghost Experience at my House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sdavid113@comcast.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;once at my house, my mother and my friend were sitting in my
livivng room while i was in my room. when they were sitting there they
heard a soft voice . the voice said hi......my mother thaught it was&nbsp;
me but when she went to look and see if i was there i was still in my room.
later on that day my mother was having trouble finding my younger sisters
bottle. it was left in my sisters crib but was not there so my mom and
i saerched the whole room, but could not find it. we finally gave up and
turned to go to the kitchen and just get another bottle . but when we turned
we heard a clunk on the floor.&nbsp; and when we turned around the bottle
was sitting right next to my mothers foot and the ground, after we had
already searched the room and it was not there before.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Somethings I would like to Share</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tandemdisc@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Thank you very much for the chance to talk to you.&nbsp; I dont know
how I want</B>
<BR><B>to go about doing this, I dont want to bore you with one long story,
so I</B>
<BR><B>thought I would give you some "Cliff Note" versions of them.</B>
<BR><B>I cant recall at this exact moment how old I was, but i was camping
at a</B>
<BR><B>state park in Cleburne TX.&nbsp; I had made some new friends and
was sleeping at</B>
<BR><B>there camp this one night.&nbsp; I awoke one morning around 7, no
one was</B>
<BR><B>stirring but there was plenty of light out.&nbsp; For some reason
a sat up and</B>
<BR><B>looked in this particular direction and saw a man walking towards
us.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>whole situation felt so strange that i looked away for a moment
then turned</B>
<BR><B>back and he was gone.&nbsp; A moment meaning 2 seconds maybe, and
he was in an</B>
<BR><B>area that he couldnt have gone out of sight that quickly.</B>
<BR><B>I was a little bit older when me and a friend were playing in the
woods</B>
<BR><B>behind my house.&nbsp; We were up against the inside of a little
ravine and we</B>
<BR><B>both looked up, and eye level with us was a pair of old boots and
dark pants</B>
<BR><B>being worn by someone obviously doing alot of work.&nbsp; We sat
back down for a</B>
<BR><B>second and stared at each other wondering "what the"&nbsp; we looked
back up</B>
<BR><B>again and it was gone.&nbsp; Again there was no place to go that
he could have</B>
<BR><B>hid, it was an open field, my friend mentioned it the next couple
of times</B>
<BR><B>we were together talking about how cool it was, then he never spoke
of it</B>
<BR><B>again, I once brought it up later and he would have nothing to do
with it.</B>
<BR><B>All throughout my high school years I would awaken in the night
to first</B>
<BR><B>hearing footsteps around the room and then later on it would be
other</B>
<BR><B>noises.&nbsp; I would always turn on a light and sit up for awhile
and it would</B>
<BR><B>soon be alright, then it got to the point where i would lean over
and the</B>
<BR><B>lamp wouldnt turn on, I would jump up to turn the overhead light
on, it</B>
<BR><B>wouldn't work either, and then I was out of the house in an instant,
and</B>
<BR><B>spent the rest of the night at whataburger drinking coffee till
daylight.</B>
<BR><B>After high school I lived in Arlington Texas for a couple of years,
never</B>
<BR><B>had anything or felt anything strange at all.&nbsp; Except for one
night i was</B>
<BR><B>alone in the house i was sharing with another guy and i heard whistling</B>
<BR><B>coming from the other side of the door.&nbsp; And of course it freaked
me out,</B>
<BR><B>but I recovered from rather quickly until something that happen
real</B>
<BR><B>recently brought it back.&nbsp; I can explain that later.</B>
<BR><B>Well I thought I'd continue on alittle bit longer.</B>
<BR><B>I lived in Montana for a year it was during this time I had several
phyiscal</B>
<BR><B>experiences that i really never experienced before or after.</B>
<BR><B>There were numerous times i awoke to both my legs being pulled back
and</B>
<BR><B>forth.&nbsp; Once they were shaken very violently, I would lie in
bed in the</B>
<BR><B>evenings and get the feeling of someone either sitting on my back
or pushing</B>
<BR><B>down on it.&nbsp; I have felt these sensations before and after
but just not like</B>
<BR><B>the frequency that i felt there.&nbsp; While growing up I would
awaken to the bed</B>
<BR><B>being shaken on several occasions, and I have been pysically touch
by some</B>
<BR><B>of my deceased relatives.&nbsp; And a few others I can get into
later.</B>
<BR><B>When I was young I once turned a corner to walk down a hallway at
my house</B>
<BR><B>and saw a face in front of my brother's closed bedroom door.&nbsp;
The face was</B>
<BR><B>hard to distinguish because of a rather strong red glow surrounding
it.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I love the supernatural, it scarces me and fasicinates me
all at the same</B>
<BR><B>time.&nbsp; I am always trying to read anything on the subject when
its</B>
<BR><B>available.&nbsp; I guess one day I stopped to think about everything
that has</B>
<BR><B>happened to me and decided to share and become part of it all.&nbsp;
I am glad to</B>
<BR><B>tell you more and more if you would like.&nbsp; At the same time
you may not have</B>
<BR><B>any interest so I will stop here and would love to hear a reply.&nbsp;
Thank you</B>
<BR><B>very much</B><B></B>

<P><B>HEAVY GHOST AND SCARED POOCH</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sibbison@yahoo.co.uk</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>It was early 70's in Glasgow, Scotland.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Willie was then a agent for various pop groups and his wife has gone
out</B>
<BR><B>to one of her singing gigs along with their young daughter.</B>
<BR><B>Willie was alone in his house for the first time since they'd moved
in.</B>
<BR><B>He had not been drinking, has never taken drugs neither was he on
any</B>
<BR><B>medication at that time.</B>
<BR><B>At around 2-3am in the morning he went to visit the lavatory and
then</B>
<BR><B>obviously came back to bed. He was lying awake when he heard heavy</B>
<BR><B>breathing beside him.&nbsp; He thought that it must be his own breathing
but</B>
<BR><B>when he held his breath the 'other breathing' continued.&nbsp; He
then almost</B>
<BR><B>immediately felt a huge heavy weight on his chest and really thought
he</B>
<BR><B>was going to die of suffocation.&nbsp; He said over and over in
his mind</B>
<BR><B>'God,help me','God,help me'</B>
<BR><B>The pressure eased almost immediately even though this incantation
was</B>
<BR><B>silent.&nbsp; Willie said he rushed out of the bedroom and into
the living</B>
<BR><B>room where he said that he looked into a mirror and saw his</B>
<BR><B>hair standing on end.&nbsp;&nbsp; He rushed out of the house and
drove around</B>
<BR><B>return until it was light.</B>
<BR><B>When he recounted the story to his wife it frightened her enough
for</B>
<BR><B>them to put their double mattress in the living room for over 6</B>
<BR><B>months before they could sell the house.&nbsp;&nbsp; However during
that time</B>
<BR><B>he said that his body sweated out a real stink for quite a few weeks</B>
<BR><B>after this incident and he has never been able to explain any of
it.</B>
<BR><B>What to you think it could have been ?&nbsp; Even when he recalls
it today</B>
<BR><B>you can see the fear in him.</B>
<BR><B>He has had other things happen to him so must be sensitive to</B>
<BR><B>spirits.&nbsp;&nbsp; The house was a lovely home in a normal street
nothing too</B>
<BR><B>grand or expensive and not even that old.&nbsp; Strange eh !!!!&nbsp;
We often</B>
<BR><B>drive past the house and he really regrets having had to leave it
-</B>
<BR><B>there are people living there still so obviously they've not had</B>
<BR><B>experiences themselves as far as we know.</B><B></B>

<P><B>This my experience - (lame in comparison)</B>
<BR><B>I live in the old Market town of St Albans in South East England.</B>
<BR><B>Our town was built by the Romans and we have a 14th century abbey
and</B>
<BR><B>14th century streets close to the modern city centre.&nbsp; All
in all a very</B>
<BR><B>beautiful and ancient place to live.&nbsp; One day my mother happened
to</B>
<BR><B>mention over lunch that our dog had refused to walk past a house
in the</B>
<BR><B>medieval village of St. Michaels.</B>
<BR><B>I didn't believe her at all so took him down there myself.&nbsp;
To my</B>
<BR><B>astonishment when we got to number 61 or so he stopped dead and
put his</B>
<BR><B>claws into the ground and wouldn't move - sounds a bit cruel but
I</B>
<BR><B>needed to be convinced.&nbsp; He did this every single time we walked
past</B>
<BR><B>but was fine again literally 2 steps further down the road once
we</B>
<BR><B>picked him up and carried him forward.&nbsp; We watched the actions
of other</B>
<BR><B>dogs but no other ever had the same fear.</B>
<BR><B>We discovered that the house had often been bought and sold - there</B>
<BR><B>seemed to always be a 'for sale' sign outside.&nbsp; Anyway reading
through</B>
<BR><B>some history of the place we found out that there were tunnels under
all</B>
<BR><B>of these houses that the monks used to use to go to the abbey nearby
-</B>
<BR><B>not scary at all really but further investigation told us that this</B>
<BR><B>particular house was built on the site of an old abbatoir.&nbsp;
I cannot</B>
<BR><B>believe though that a dog could smell blood that was a few hundred
years</B>
<BR><B>old - if that indeed was the case !!!&nbsp; We'll never know.</B>

<P><B>Fort Clinch Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: spage1@mediaone.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>We live near a Civil War era masonry fort (which is in Fernandina
Beach, Fl,</B>
<BR><B>near the Fl/Ga border) that we love to visit on a regular basis.
Our</B>
<BR><B>favorite events are the torchlight tours held on Saturday evenings.
There is</B>
<BR><B>no artificial light allowed, and the only light is provided by torches,</B>
<BR><B>fires, and lanterns-and a moon, if you're lucky. This past month,
my son and</B>
<BR><B>I attended a torchlight tour. We were aware of the ghost stories:
Yankee</B>
<BR><B>soldiers, a woman in white who searches for her baby, and the cries
of a</B>
<BR><B>baby who died in the fort during the Great Depression. Then there
are the</B>
<BR><B>ghosts who are heard but not seen-footsteps are heard in the infirmary
and</B>
<BR><B>on the ramparts, and the latter ghost comes equipped with keys!
My son and I</B>
<BR><B>are interested in the paranormal, but until this night neither one
of us had</B>
<BR><B>seen a ghost. It was a particularly dark night-no moon, no clouds,
and the</B>
<BR><B>fort's buildings were barely discernable. My son was standing in
the middle</B>
<BR><B>of the parade ground when he heard a slight noise and saw a movement
out of</B>
<BR><B>the corner of his eye. Looking up at the building that once housed
soldiers,</B>
<BR><B>he saw a man in the third window from the left. Even though the
building</B>
<BR><B>itself was barely visible, this man was very bright. My son said
he seemed</B>
<BR><B>to be lit from the inside. The figure appeared to be a Yankee soldier.</B>
<BR><B>According to my son's account, this spirit made direct eye contact
with him.</B>
<BR><B>The soldier tipped his hat and faded away, and the window was once
again</B>
<BR><B>pitch dark. My son said that during the entire episode, which lasted
about 2</B>
<BR><B>minutes, he felt tingles up and down his spine. When he told me
his story, I</B>
<BR><B>wanted to believe him. He doesn't make things up as a rule. A good
test</B>
<BR><B>would be to tell some of the re-enactors about it. When we began
telling the</B>
<BR><B>first person we could find, she asked if the ghost had appeared
in the third</B>
<BR><B>window. We confirmed that it did. My son described a ghost that
has been</B>
<BR><B>seen by over 60 people!</B>

<BR><B>Happy to Share</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:debi@septodontinc.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am so happy to have stumbled across your site on the web.&nbsp;
I have been searching for a site like yours for some time.</B>
<BR><B>I grew up in Northern Delaware in a town called Hockessin.&nbsp;
There was nothing extraordinary about our neighborhood.&nbsp; The houses
were not terribly old (most of them built in the late 60s).&nbsp; From
the time we moved there in the 70s, when I was five, I can remember having
a feeling as if someone was watching me.&nbsp; This may sound absurd, but
I was never afraid.&nbsp; In fact, I always felt very safe.</B>
<BR><B>My parents had known we had a ghost for years.&nbsp; They had, in
fact, seen her many, many times and never said a word in front of me (for
obvious reasons).&nbsp; It wasnt until I was about 13 years old that I
had my first experience with Emily.&nbsp; I was having a friend spend
the night.&nbsp; We had just come from a school dance, and it was late
when we finally got to bed.&nbsp; I was just drifting of to sleep when
I very clearly heard a child laugh.&nbsp; At first, I didnt even flinch-I
think I worked it into my sleep somehow, as a dream.&nbsp; But then my
friend asked if I had heard it.&nbsp; We both pulled the covers over our
heads-and she kept asking me over and over what or who that was.&nbsp;
There were no little children living there-I was the youngest of four-so
where had the laugh come from?</B>
<BR><B>We both told my parents what had happened the next morning.&nbsp;
They made light of it-of course-and didnt offer any kind of explanation
to either of us.&nbsp; That night, my father sat me down and told me all
about Emily.&nbsp; He said that for years he and my mother had seen a
little girl, dressed in night clothes, walk from the bedroom at the end
of the hallway (next to mine), past their bedroom, and down the hall towards
the living room.&nbsp; I remember my father telling me that she had even
stuck her head in the doorway of their room once-and he had beckoned
to her and told her not to be afraid.&nbsp; He said she had kind of vanished
when he talked to her.&nbsp; They had both said they thought her night
clothes appeared older or Victorian even-as she wore a night cap.&nbsp;
They had fondly called her Emily.&nbsp; (The back bedroom she walked from
was always very, very cool in comparison to the rest of the house.)</B>
<BR><B>I have to say that although I did sometimes have an uneasy feeling
if I was alone at night in the house, I still was not afraid.&nbsp; I,
unfortunately, never had the privilege of seeing Emily, but they never
had the privilege of hearing her laugh.&nbsp; She sounded so joyful.&nbsp;
I cant help but wonder what happened to that little girl and why she stayed
for so long behind.&nbsp; I have never been able to find any history of
the property-and any advice you can give me in this area would be most
appreciated.</B>
<BR><B>After the laugh, the only other experiences I ever had were feeling
like someone was tugging on my shirt or tapping me a few times, especially
downstairs when I was in the laundry room (I was not the only person in
the house that this happened to in that room).&nbsp; Once a can of soda
slid across our entire kitchen table.&nbsp; Little things like that.</B>
<BR><B>When my father was dying of Cancer, at home, we had the house blessed
by our priest.&nbsp; We told him about Emily, and as he blessed the house,
he did say that if any spirits were at unrest in our home, that it was
alright to go.</B>
<BR><B>My mother still lives in the house, and I still go there often.&nbsp;
I am never afraid, but always at ease there.&nbsp; In fact, it may seem
strange but when there is any kind of turmoil in my life, I love to go
there for peace.&nbsp; Neither my mother nor I have seen Emily since my
father passed when I was 16.&nbsp; My niece, however, does continue to
have strange things happen when she is there.&nbsp; Her last experience
consisted of the television going off and on, followed by the lights.&nbsp;
I did not see this personally, but one of her friends was with her.&nbsp;
The electricity in the rest of the house was fine-and she and her friend
did come running up the stairs.&nbsp; I cant help but hope that it is
not Emily and that she has moved on.</B>
<BR><B>I now have my own home and a two-year-old boy.&nbsp; I had never
had any experiences in my home until recently.&nbsp; I kept catching a
glimpse of something passing by me out of the corner of my eye.&nbsp; I
did not think anything of it and tossed it up to needing more sleep.&nbsp;
The other night, however, while my son was in his high chair eating dinner,
he pointed past me into the living room and said mommy, whos that?.&nbsp;
I turned but did not see anything.&nbsp; We shall see</B>
<BR><B>Im sorry to go on and on, but am delighted to finally tell someone
who wont grimace and roll their eyes at me!&nbsp; Thanks for letting me
share my experience.</B><B></B>

space mountain ride. My sisters boyfriend says he saw a guy on the railings
looking at us and he looked back real fast and saw nothing there and there
was no way he could have been on the railings!!!!!! And also on that ride
with the little girl and her ball I screamed and panicked, but this might
scare you too, but I was in the line and I heard a little girl crying and
I looked down in the crease right were the girl fell and I saw a little
girl playing with a ball and I didn't hear bout that story yet and then
I thought the girl was adorable so I went to go tell my boyfriend "Look
how cute she is, but where's her daddy?"&nbsp; then my boyfriend had a
big fear on his face and told me the story and I freaked and I looked back
down again and I saw her for one second and she vanished but before she
vanished she looked rite up at me with the saddest eyes iv ever seen&nbsp;
and I am really scared to go back over there now. but I screamed very lowed
and the manager asked me what was wrong and I told him I saw a spider so
I lied to him so we wouldn't get kicked off!!!</B>

<P><B>Contact with Visitors from Beyond</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: dantalian73@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I would like to preface this story by telling you that I love your
site and have been a regular visitor here for over a year now.&nbsp; It
is heartening to know that many people from around the globe have shared
my confusion and fear when in the prescence of the ghostly denizens of
our world.</B>
<BR><B>My contact with visitors beyond our plane began when I was around
3 years old and was living with my parents in on Deer Point Lake near Panama
City, Florida.&nbsp; I would oftentimes awake during the night and look
into the mirror attatched to my dressor at the foot of my bed to find a
woman staring back at me from beneath the cowl of a sable cape that she
wore.&nbsp; The outside of the cape wasn't so much black as it was the
complete absence of light.&nbsp; The cape's lining was dark crimson, which
was a violent contrast to the chalky pallor of the woman's skin.&nbsp;
I would always jump from my bed and run screaming into my parent's room
when these sightings first began, but since my folks never seemed to take
me seriously I finally got to the point where I would just hide my face
under the covers anytime the lady would appear.</B>
<BR><B>My parents separated when I was 5, and due to financial reasons,
my mother, newborn sister, and I moved to a smaller house closer to where
she worked at our local community college.&nbsp; I recall being relieved
at the time that I wouldn't have to worry about seeing the strange woman
anymore, as I was certain she wouldn't be able to follow me to our new
home.&nbsp; Heh, boy was I ever wrong.</B>
<BR><B>On the first night in our new home I started in my sleep to look
up and find the same form staring back at me.&nbsp; When I would go to
my father's house to visit him, if I went to the bathroom at night without
turning the lights on first, I would almost always find her there as well.</B>
<BR><B>As I grew older, the sightings of the woman happened less and less
frequently and I eventually got to a point where I would stop expecting
to have them.&nbsp; The sightings after I passed through puberty only seemed
to happen when significant changes took place in my life.&nbsp; Before
my twin daughters were born, I saw her.&nbsp; While going through my own
divorce, I saw her.&nbsp; Shortly after meeting my current fiance, I saw
her.&nbsp; I have finally grown somewhat accustomed to seeing her every
so often, but the initial shock is always there upon looking up into a
mirror to see her staring back at me.&nbsp; It may seem childish, but I
will rarely ever glance into a mirror unless the lights are on in the room.</B>
<BR><B>I have no clue who the woman is, but she is the only apparition
that has followed me throughout my life.&nbsp; I have seen others, but
never with the same frequency or mind-jarring shock that accompanies this
one.&nbsp; Through conversations with my mother, I learned that things
like this are common among the women on her side of the family (I am a
man).&nbsp; All of my grandmother's sisters and daughters also have a single
lock of whitish-grey hair just above thier foreheads.&nbsp; I always assumed
it was a family gene that bred true because I have it as well, yet my sister
who was born shortly after my grandmother died doesn't have it.&nbsp; What
is also interesting, is that evidently my maternal grandmother was involved
in the occult and she performed some sort of cabbalistic blessing upon
