<big>My First Experience<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yaminichirusa@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
This is my first, but not my last experience. I'm a slight skeptic and
a Psychology major so I believe in scientific explanations first and
foremost when it comes to aliens and ghosts, before classifiying it as
a 'Ghost Story'.&nbsp; I've always been overly curious about my
families linage and who's related to who in my grandparents tiny town
[founded by my grandfathers, grandfather]. I was adopted into the
family and I'd always felt like a but of an outcast with no background
of my own so I liked to 'adopt' my families history despite our lack of
blood relation. One day while my father and I were visiting he asked my
grandmother if she wouldn't mind taking us to the graveyards around the
tiny town and showing us around. She took us to the family graveyard,
another families graveyard [who's apparently not related in any way]
and finally she took us to large church/solider shared graveyard.&nbsp;
I was struck by how large this place was and immediately wondered away,
it was about ninety-nine degrees that day with very little wind and
high humidity. So what happened next, could have easily been caused by
the heat, but as a half-skeptic I'm not sure. I decided to tidy up
around the headstones, believing it wasn't fair to neglect someone in
life or death. As I traveled around emptying out dirty vases,
straightening flowers, dusting dirt off head stones, etc. I came across
four neat little graves in a row. The graves were old, moldy and worn.
Each one had a little weather worn cloth tulip in front of it and each
one bore the same title '***** Infant'.&nbsp; I don't like to talk
about it but I suffer from an anxiety disorder that causes me to be
'emotionally numb', its extremely hard for me to feel empathy or
sympathy...but looking at those little graves I felt my heart break in
my chest. I run my fingers over each one and whispered a little prayer
for them. I walked away to continue my volunteered grave cleaning <br>
duties, feeling a strange 'tug' to go back to the little ones graves
and stay there. After a few moments I stopped under a large tree for a
rest, drenched in sweat.&nbsp; Someone had hung a wind chime over
another grave [on the same tree], I blankly studied it listening to my
grandmother and father talking across the graveyard, I could see the
infants graves out of the corner of my eye. I reached up to touch the
chime, when I froze in place, a cold feeling slid down my spine and
consumed my stomach. Without thinking I turned quickly towards the
infants graves and stopped cold. A woman was standing beside the second
stone, she had ebony black hair down to her thin waist and she was
wearing and old fashion blue dress that looked straight out of the
1900's, but that wasn't the remarkable thing about her, her face was
smooth, round and pale and literally blank. She had no eyes, lips,
nose, nothing. I gasped and involuntarily took a step backwards,
flinching at the sight, when I recovered she'd vanished without a trace.<br>

The Little Girl (Ghost Story)<br>
<br>
By: stepho1375@yahoo.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
My name is Stephanie. I am 23 years old. Well, My Husband &amp; I have
been living in our apartment for 3 years now. We have 3 little girls.
They are destiny is 4, Madison is 3 &amp; June is 6 months old. Many
strange things have been occurring in our apartment since I was
pregnant with my baby june. The first thing is that My Older Daughter's
destiny and Madison had to sleep in the same crib because My oldest
destiny broke hers. Well one night me &amp; my husband were sleeping
and I woke up suddenly and looked over to my daughter's crib and I saw
someone standing up at the edge of the crib looking at us. At first I
thought it was my oldest daughter destiny because whatever it was
seemed to have the same tall, skinny features as my daughter. I got up
to get her to lie back down, but when I did get up I looked in the crib
and both my babies were covered and fast asleep. The second incident
was again in the middle of the night. My youngest daughter June was 2
months old, and I had gone to bed early. My Husband stayed up late
watching t.v. in the living room, and didn't want to wake any of us up
so slept on the couch. well, at this point we had just bought my
daughter destiny her toddler bed, and Madison still slept in her crib.
well, I had suddenly awoke, and I saw what at the time was my daughter
Destiny get off her bed, and went over to Madison's crib and was
looking in there. I got up and was going to get mad at her because I
didn't want her to wake Madison up. When I got to her bed I saw that
she was covered and fast asleep.. It freaked me out. My Husband didn't
believe me. Than we were standing by our breakfast bar about 10 pm
talking, and he stopped what he was saying and went to the bathroom. He
came back pale, and said your not going to believe it. He said he
thought he saw Destiny go into the bathroom, and went in there and no
one was there. He said he was going to get mad at her because she was
suppose to be asleep, and when he went in there Destiny was fast
asleep. He said, "I swear I saw a little girl go in the bathroom."
Whatever it is seems to be attracted to Destiny because all the times
that we have seen this thing it always is around her. We have even
mistaken it for our daughter. The weirdest part is that my brother in
law came to bring my nephew over to play with my daughters, and I was
taking pictures of all of them. On one of the pictures there was an
orb, and i had took a picture a second before that and there was
nothing there. All in all whatever it is, is seriously freaking me out.<br>

Regarding Hauntings <br>
<br>
By: anonymous &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Through most of my life I've think I've always been able to see
'things', even if I wasn't completely aware of what I was seeing.&nbsp;
I have many experiences good and bad, but I'll only share a few. The
first happened when I was 9, and my father was incarcerated. I remember
coming home from school, and my mom was on the phone, so my other
brother (14 years my senior) brought me into the living room to watch
television. As I sat there something in my head kept saying "You're
father is in jail, but you'll be okay." The voice kept repeating this,
and I kept thinking "Yeah right." My father was a minister, and
therefore I never had any reason to believe anything was abnormal. My
mother came and sat beside me on the couch, and told me what had
happened to my father, and till this day I think it was a guardian just
trying to prepare me for the bad news.&nbsp; The second happened after
my grandmother passed away. I was seventeen, and she was the first
person that I've ever lost that I was very close to. My&nbsp; family is
very superstitious, and although I didn't believe in a lot of it, I've
started to believe in some. My grandmother who passed had a cousin who
I also consider a grandmother, and she always to warn me to be careful
in cemetaries because I don't know what I might bring home. I always
thought that it was just for fun because they lived in South America,
and it was just tales they grew up with. After my grandmothers funeral
I had a horrible nightmare, that I haven't told anyone the severity of
it even till this day. It was so frightening that I woke up and it felt
like my bed was shaking because my heart was beating to quickly. After
that experience strange things started to happen, I would wake up and
my bible would be on the floor (I slept with it away from my bed, open
to the 23rd psalm). Later on I would feel my bed sink as if someone was
sitting on it, and another time I saw a shadow standing on the inside
of my room. I was terrified, but didn't want to say anything to upset
my family, so I would just sleep with my lights on. Another time I was
vacuuming for my mom, and something ran up right beside my face, so I
dropped the vacuum and just walked away. This was all happening in a
short span of time (two - three weeks), so I just thought i was the
stress of my grandmother death. However something changed my mind. I
was lying on the couch in the living room on my stomach, and my little
six year old nephew was sitting on my back. From my family room and
where the couch was positioned you could see the door of my mothers
bedroom. So as we were sitting there watching t.v., he asked me "Aunty
Rose did you see that person come out of grandma's room?" I completely
freaked out internally, but I didn't want to scare my nephew so I told
him it was probably nothing. No one was home with us, so we both stayed
in the far end of the living room, until someone came home. Later as my
family discussed it I found out that myself, my sister-in-law and my
nephew all had encounters with whatever was in the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Eventually whatever it was went away, and I had an amazing dream about
my grandmother a few nights later. In the dream she was saying
something very important, and I was listening intently. When I awoke
however I couldn't remember what she had told me. Later that afternoon
I found out that my aunt (my grandmothers daughter), my uncle (her
son), and myself all had a similar dream where we couldn't remember
what she was saying. My grandmothers cousin told me that perhaps she'll
have me remember when I need it most. That was the most comforting
thought of all.<br>

Pine Hollow Cemetery Oyster Bay Long Island<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; medic5329@optonline.net<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
&nbsp; Pine Hollow is on Rte 106 on Long Island in Nassau County.&nbsp;
The history goes back to the 1880s and there are 7 Civil War Veterans
buried there.&nbsp; The extraordinary thing is they were all Volunteer
"Col" or ' Colored ' soldiers.&nbsp; You see this is an African
American Cemetery.&nbsp;&nbsp; Vanessa Williams,&nbsp; Miss America,
was related to one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went there 4 or 5 times, the
first I went by it an never found it.&nbsp; The next time I found it
with my son, we mistook a huge hill of around a mile and very hard
climbing.&nbsp; We were about a quarter of a mile away but no
good.&nbsp;&nbsp; I got in my car and said I'd go a little further
north then go home.&nbsp; Out of the corner of my eye I saw the sign in
my mirror just sheer coincidence I saw it.&nbsp; We went in and my son
was talking to the dead telling them we come in peace and will not
disturb them.&nbsp; I took photos and got a minor flying object when
nothing was there it looks like a flower but floating midair.&nbsp; I
ws fascinated by 2 unmarked graves of Civil War vets along with the
other 5 but these 2 were unmarked just a GAR star to show and a very
badly worn star at that.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also found a large white glowing
blob at around 6 feet off the ground with a movement tail on
it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second time I went alone to see more of the
CW vet stones.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I entered I got the feeling of being
watched and the strange tingling I get when aything happens.&nbsp; I
turned to go to the old section where the vets are.&nbsp; I got 6 feet
from the turn and the feeling got worse.&nbsp; Out of ther corener of
my eye I saw a black figure from the neck down wearing a black cape and
jacket, I am a CW history buff so I knew the jacket and cape to be a
Greatcoat from the CW.&nbsp; I was startled and when I looked back it
was gone so I took 3 more steps and again the feeling and turn and
again he was there, the same figure and this time gone before my
eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I met the volunteer grounds keeper and we
spoke, he told me a lot of the history and I enjoyed it a
lot.&nbsp;&nbsp; While talking I saw a black cat suddenly appear in the
middle of a field near the "haunted hill" and it sat watching me so I
took a photo and a second.&nbsp; As I was taking the second it started
walking and again was gone.&nbsp; It could not hide it was just
gone.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next visit was with my son again and we had a
good time. Durring the time he said the same thing he said before in
the graveyard, "why do you have such good stuff happen like the
photos".&nbsp; I told him the same thing I did before "keep your mind
open"&nbsp;&nbsp; On every visit we talk to the dead and this time I
did as the keeper told me to put a rock , like the Jews do, on the
stone to show you visited.&nbsp;&nbsp; He did on David Carll's stone
and as he did we started to walk out, him leading the way.&nbsp; He was
ahead and I looked away and he said " Wow did you see
that?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said no and asked what.&nbsp; He told of
seeing a black round object fly over Mr. Carll's grave and disappear in
the direction I was looking.&nbsp; There were no birds or insects
flying nothing just a lousy day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last time I went
I took photos and have been trying to figure out who these 2&nbsp;
Soldiers were.&nbsp; I asked them for a sign or let me know who you are
so we can show true repect but nothing so I went to leave after taking
a lot of photos.&nbsp;&nbsp; I went out to take a photo of the arch you
enter under and then a second further back.&nbsp; My intention was to
leave then but as I lookeds it strted raining leaves.&nbsp; There was
no wind , the trees were dead still but the leaves came down straight
like confetti.&nbsp; As I walked back inside it stopped.&nbsp; the
leaves were around 20 feet from the nearest branch of a tree and it was
still no wind to bow them.&nbsp;&nbsp; I said a thanks and a few
prayers and again went to leave.&nbsp; Again the leaves began to fall
and again no wind either at ground level or in any of the trees.&nbsp;
I felt compelled to go back in and said thanks again and a few more
prayers.&nbsp; As I went to leave I didn't look toward the entrance
just drove off.&nbsp;&nbsp; It felt like a jesture of thanks for the
time I spent looking in the arcihive for these soldiers.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Funny how abruptly it started and stopped and 2 times the same place I
was when it started.&nbsp; I am still looking for info on these
volunteers who fought in our Civil War but it is so hard and I will for
a long time it is what I said I would do and when I find the info I
will have it put near the stones.&nbsp; I am now on a mission thnkas to
a book story and the Volunteer soldier Mr. David Carll.&nbsp; Someday I
will go back and say hello again I hope I have ore info for
them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many say this is a very haunted&nbsp; place but I
never felt fear or unrest here.&nbsp; It is restful and nice and if I
should meet the phantom agin I hope he helps me with the unknowns
identity.&nbsp;&nbsp; These heros should be recognized for the work
they did and not by the draft.&nbsp; Oh David Carll was shot in the
left lung in the CW and survived to live a good life, his family still
live a few hundred yards down the road on a hill bearing his
name.&nbsp; What a tribute. What a guy.<br>

Henry<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kathyc0920@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In most of the stories on
the site people are afraid. I do not understand why. I have lived with
a ghost since I was four years old. Henry has never done anything to
frighten us. When my family moved into a house they found a print of an
old portrait in the attic. Liking it they brought it down into the
house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My younger
sister Teener (age three) and I were at first disturbed by "Henry". The
eyes seemed to follow you. The picture and the ghost so dubbed because
the only part of the artist signature legible was Henry. We told are
parents that Henry was a ghost. In an attempt to ease our fears our
parents said, yes Henry was a ghost but a friendly one. In fact Henry
liked little girls and protected them. What my parents did not realize
was that Teener and I had begun talking to him. I suppose they believed
him to be an&nbsp; imaginary friend later on. I only have a fleeting
memory of ever seeing him. I do remember pulling up a chair in front of
the picture on the wall and talking to him. I never remember hearing an
answer out loud only in my head. We lived in that house until I was
fifteen.&nbsp;&nbsp; While we lived there things would happen. Not
anything bad just mischievous. You put an item down on the table turn
around&nbsp; find it on the living room couch. Things would
occasionally fall off shelves when no one was near them, one shoe would
end up in another room entirely. These things were either ignored or
blamed on the fact that seven children and two adults in one house
frequently equals chaos. I knew differently Henry was doing it.
Sometimes I would see his face in the mirror laughing at his pranks.
Teener eventually stopped believing in Henry. Although not completely
as an incident later in life would prove. It seems none of my
additional siblings ever saw or told us of an encounter with
Henry.&nbsp;&nbsp; When we moved Henry moved with us, he was part of
the family. My parents eventually moved to a smaller place and asked me
if I wanted Henry. I was putting the picture in the car when my husband
told Teener we were taking him.This started a fight. Both Teener and I
wanted Henry. Teener threatened to damage Henry if I did not let go. I
let her have him. My sister had three children at the time. None of
them knew the story of Henry or had been told anything about a ghost.
Teener could not hang the picture all of her children were frightened
of it. After letting Henry sit covered in a closet with his face to the
wall for a year she relented. David and I were asked did we want Henry.
Yes, we took him to our home and my son was not afraid of Henry at
all.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same little pranks occurred in our home once we
had Henry. My husband hated Henry. We were married at my parents home
in front of the fireplace. Henry hung above that fireplace. David swore
that during the ceremony in July, his butt was being warmed by a large
fire behind him. He always said that was Henry's way of telling him to
be a good husband or
else.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Shortly after we moved to the home I am now in my husband died. In an
attempt to keep the house with one less income I rented out a bedroom.
I did not tell my first or any other tenants up front about Henry. I
figured he would let them know in time or not at all. For some reason
Henry completely ignored some people and bugged others to distraction.
When Henry hid Carolina's box of wires for three days I told her about
the ghost. I swear we looked everywhere took apart other boxes to see
if they had been mixed in. Three days later I go down to the basement
sitting in the middle of floor is her box a place mind you that had
been searched at least twice.&nbsp; The things that go missing and
reappear are never things that are vital. Not your house keys when you
are late for work or your medication. Just things that drive you nuts
until you decide to buy another one. Of course when you get home the
original is sitting on your bed. One tenant had been having visits from
Henry for awhile. He never said anything because Rasta was not sure I
was aware of Henry. Apparently Henry was moving papers from his desk
putting them under his mattress. Taking other items and putting them
into a box, etc. One day he actually saw Henry in his room glaring at
him. I still think that was Henry's way of telling Rasta that despite
the fact we were the only humans in the house this was Henry's place
and he would protect it. Rasta was the first man in the house after my
husbands death. Maybe my parents were right Henry does protect little
girls even when they grow
up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The only time Henry's antics caused a problem was when a friend's child
lost a toy. The boy had many trains, after a visit at my home one was
missing. The parents looked at their place, I looked here again and
again nothing. About two days later a thought pops into my head out of
nowhere. "Look under the cushions of the blue chair." I do and there is
Aiden's train. I know very well I looked repeatedly in that area as
Aiden was playing there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Henry has only once done something
in front of me. I was sitting on my bed with the cat. The bedroom door
which was ajar opens fully. I turned to the cat and said how did you do
that from here. We were the only ones in the house. I put the door back
to its original position and opens a little more on its own.&nbsp;
Usually Henry's style is wait till you leave the room and move
something. I have always wondered where do the objects go when I can't
find them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps because I have lived with Henry for so
long and we met when I was very young I cannot understand being afraid.
To me Henry is family, so he doesn't have breakfast at the table. He is
still family I realized early on I was aware of things others were
not.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

Haunted Place<br>
<br>
By: marywilkinson2009@gmail.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
My haunted place was in Phoenix, Arizona.&nbsp; My mother, sister, and
I and our family dog Snoopy, and a parakeet Albert;&nbsp; lived in a
condominium.&nbsp; We lived there from 1971 - 1974.&nbsp; I mention the
pets as some of the most horrifying things happened to these animals.
Here were some of the events which occurred.My dog Snoopy would always
be locked in the closet up in the master bedroom.&nbsp; I would leave
for somewhere, my mother and sister would be gone.&nbsp; I would know
instinctively as the house was quiet, to quiet.&nbsp; I would go
upstairs and open the closet door and out he would fly like a bat out
of hell.&nbsp; I awoke one morning to find my parakeet Albert hanging
by one foot on his perch.&nbsp; His head was in a grotesque position
like he had been strangled.&nbsp; I had to put him down.&nbsp; Weeks
later I heard voices outside the window.&nbsp; The voice of a doll,
Chatty Cathy; I believe a doll like that was made by Mattel.&nbsp; The
voices sounded like the doll Chatty Cathy.&nbsp; "Why Mary, why did you
leave me".&nbsp; I remember that night as I almost put my head through
the window straining to hear what the doll like voice was saying to
me.&nbsp; I visited a psychiatrist the next day.&nbsp; She said voices
heard like that was a sign of Schizophrenia.&nbsp; I didn't believe
it.&nbsp; After moving out here to California I have never heard
voices.&nbsp; I heard them that night.&nbsp; Another night I remember
hearing the lolling sound of wind chimes.&nbsp; I yelled out to my
mother and told her how relaxing the sound of the chimes was.&nbsp; She
said "Mary, we don't have wind chimes".&nbsp; Another night the wrought
iron stairwell lounged out and caught my mother's arm.&nbsp; Left a
permanent "X" on it.&nbsp; Scratched her arm.&nbsp; The
stairwell.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other incidents happened.&nbsp; Black bubbling
tar like substances in the toilet.&nbsp;&nbsp; A smell like a dead
animal in the walls.&nbsp;&nbsp; My sister at the time was in high
school.&nbsp; I have heard that poltergeists sometimes occur with
teenage girls.&nbsp; Anyway, I believe the site was haunted.&nbsp; The
building contractor went bankrupt and those of us in the condos were in
limbo for a while.&nbsp; One by one the few families left.&nbsp; I once
went back there to investigate the new residents.&nbsp; I went to cross
the street and a 1989 black Firebird came out of nowhere and almost ran
me down.&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided the site itself was haunted and the
ghostly inhabitants didn't want me around asking questions of the
current residents.<br>

"The Haunting at the Y.M.C.A."<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stephenpike001@yahoo.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;My story begins five years ago. I started working at the local
Y.M.C.A. in 2004. I'm employed in a Youth Residential Program, one of
three in the building. My program occupies the fifth floor of the
building. The other two programs are on the 3rd and 4th floor. The 6th
and top floor is reserved for the traditional Y.M.C.A. residential
space for adults. The building itself was built approximately 110 years
ago. All of the floors were adult residential until the early 1970's
when the Department of Youth services and the Y started their contract,
at which time the 3 above mentioned floors became D.Y.S. vendor
programs. You can still see "apartment" numbers above the doors to some
of our rooms. As I said I began working at the Y in 2004 and was
assigned the graveyard shift (11p.m. to 7a.m.).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I knew the building was old and , at night, mostly empty. But that
never much bothered me. I used to go wandering around the Y during the
middle of the night. I'd go to the basement and walk around the locker
rooms and generally explore the place. It wasn't terribly "creepy" to
me, but then again I wasn't giving it much thought. I was interested in
the building itself. I've always been interested in older buildings and
when given the chance to explore one like this I took it. I would, from
time to time, get the feeling that I wasn't alone. I chalked this up to
the cleaning crew that would be in the building at night. Sometimes I
would hear them around a corner or down a hall, just out of sight.
Though now, in retrospect, i wonder if it was in fact the cleaning crew
I heard. I would also visit the bathroom on the second floor during the
night, as did alot of the other guys working. It was clean and private,
something the communal facilities on our floor were not. This 2nd floor
bathroom was for the corporate offices so was, of course, in much
better condition than our own.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't say exactly
when the paranormal events began to occur. OR rather, should I say,
When I NOTICED them. There were four employees working at night on each
floor. We generally kept busy reading, talking or watching movies to
pass the time. Some nights, however, there wouldn't be much going on.
It'd be quiet. There is a place we sit in order to watch one of the
hallways where the residents rooms are located. This seat affords us a
view of the "lower" and "upper" hallways. The residents stay only on
the lower while the upper is reserved for classrooms and clinical
offices. All of which are locked at night. We go up there to use the
coffee machine but for nothing else as we are not given access to the
rooms. These rooms had also been adult residential rooms prior to the
1970's.From the seat, as I said, we watch the lower hall. On occasion,
while one of us is sitting there we'll see "something" on the upper
hall or hear "something" out of the ordinary. Mostly it's just reported
as "something whizzed past" or " I saw a streak go by" etc. Though, on
a couple of separate occasions there has been more to report. MUCH
more. Recently one of my coworkers was seated at the post talking to
someone. The TV was set up sp that behind it one could see the upper
hall. As he moved to turn the TV one he went pale. Stammering he turned
to me and said " Someones on the upper!" He seemed to be in a state of
shock. I wasn't as surprised given my experiences there. I asked him
what he saw. HE proceeded to tell me that as he turned he looked up and
saw a man walk across the hall from right to left, seemingly IN to one
of the classrooms. As I said, the doors are locked and I had already
made SURE they were as it's part of the nightly security check. He
promptly moved his seat and asked me to watch that post instead. I had
no problem. A man walking across a hall is far from the most
frightening thing I've seen in the building. Oddly enough about the
classroom this "man" walked into. a couple years ago I was on the upper
hall way, lying down in front of that same classroom trying to catch a
quick nap (which is not necessarily company policy, mind you!) as I
laid down in front of the door I heard what I thought at first to be a
radio. As I listened more closely I could hear a man and a woman
talking. I couldn't make out what exactly was being said but it sounded
very animated. At this point I definitely knew it was NOT a radio and
it was definitely IN the classroom. The voices sounded as if they were
having an argument and they sounded as if they were on the other side
of the door. I got up quickly and made my way back down to the desk
area of our unit (situated between the two halls.) Another coworker was
there. He looked at me and asked what was wrong. I could barley speak.
I finally stammered out that I heard two people talking and it was
coming from inside the room. He was skeptical and offered me an
explanation; I had simply heard one of the 6th floor tenants talking
and the noise had bled through the floor. I was willing to accept this
and it eased my mind. Though there are no vents or an visible means for
the noise to come through so clearly. I couldn't stop thinking about
how it had sounded as if they were right on the other side of the door.
As I thought about my coworkers explanation something dawned on me. Due
to the design of the building there was no way it could have been
voices from the 6th floor. You see, in that part of the building our
floor IS the top floor. The 6th floor does not extend that far. I told
this to my coworker but he had no good explanation for the voices. I
believe I heard a conversation from a long long time ago. Also from the
upper hall have been heard odd "tapping's" that sound like someone
tapping on the glass of the doors from the inside. There have been
streaks of white seen there, too. Nearly everyone has reported feeling
as if they are being "watched" while on the upper. As far as the lower
hallway, there have been other reports from staff and residents alike
of out of place noises and lights and even disembodied laughter. One
night in particular two kids stopped me on my rounds to ask what was on
the other side of the wall from their room (their room was the last
room on the left at the far end of the hallway.). I told them that the
only things on the other side of the wall were a hallway and the
Director of the Programs office. This was around midnight. Next they
asked if anyone was back there or had been back there. I told them no.
The director leaves everyday around 3p.m. and no one else has been back
there as we were all posted in the hallways and at the desk. I noticed
at this time that one of the residents had moved his bed away from the
wall to the opposite side of the room. I asked him why he did this and
why they were asking questions about what was on the other side of the
wall. They told me that maybe 20 minutes before I came to their room
they had heard what sounded like someone talking and then someone
laughing very loudly on the other side of the wall. The kid had moved
his bed because it was so loud that he couldn't fall asleep. I told
them that no one had been back there and that the offices are empty and
locked up by 3 everyday. I kept calm for the sake of the kids abut was
shaken. I reassured them that maybe a staff had wandered back there and
they heard him on his phone and that they shouldn't worry about it. I
left them and said goodnight. perhaps half an hour elapsed when I heard
this bedroom door open.One of the kids stepped out and asked me if I
could tell the staff not to go back there. They had not been able to
fall asleep. He said that about 5 minutes after I left the room they
again could hear talking and laughing on the other side of the wall. I
knew it was not one of my staff as we had all been together during that
time. I told the resident I would tell the staff to stop and that he
should go back to bed. He did. There were no more disturbances that
night, thankfully. But since that time I've had no fewer than a dozen
different kids tell me the same thing. Each time I play it off as best
I can, but if they only knew just how frightening it was they'd never
sleep in that room again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the scariest
thing I've encountered while at the Y. As I said before, I was wont to
explore the Y late at night and to use the 2nd floor bathroom. There is
an ancient elevator in the building. As old as the building itself and
known to be the oldest elevator in the city. It dated back to the
1890's when the building was erected. One night I took the elevator to
the 2nd floor to use the facilities there. On the 2nd floor are the
administrative offices for the Y. As one steps off the elevator they
see a small lobby area with two cubicles in it and several doors
ringing it on the inside. there is a large plate glass window with two
glass doors at either end which serve as the entrances to those
cubicles and offices. on the right hand side, in the wall when one
turns right off the elevator, is a window that looks in on one of the
inside doored offices. The window is outside the glassed in area but
the office door is inside. All of this is locked up at night, as is the
building. It is, after all, a secure DYS facility. The only people
inside are the male employees of the programs, none of which have keys
to anything but the office on their respective floor and that's on a
communal key chain. So, I step off of the elevator to go to the 2nd
floor bathroom (one exits the elevator to the right and then turns
right where the office window is, goes up a small flight of 4 steps and
just past the stairwell to the 3rd floor is the bathroom.The light
switch for the bathroom is on the outside of the bathroom itself.) As I
pass the office window I look inside. As I do I see a person, what
looks like a girl, standing behind the wooden office door, seemingly
with her face nearly against the inside of the door itself. This person
is no more than five feet from me. It is almost pitch black in the
office except for the light coming from the hallway in which I'm in.
All I can see of this person is their head and shoulders. I cannot see
the face due to they way this person is standing. They have long ,
straight brown hair just past the shoulders. I stop and look at this
person for probably two minutes. My first reaction is that of a staff
in a secure facility. I worry about the kids and wonder who this person
is who is in the building in the middle of the night. I continue
looking. I notice that the person has not moved a millimeter since I
got there. I also start wondering why someone would be in that office
and , if they were in that office why would they "hide" in the one
place I could see them? I thought maybe they were working late (though
that makes no sense because it was very very late and everyones out of
those offices by 5p.m.. I thought, also, maybe it was a maintenance
person. Thouth I knew the maintenance men and none of them looked
remotely like this person. But By this time I have to use the bathroom
badly so I head in, not giving more thought to this "person", at least
until I come back out. As I get out of the bathroom I expect this
person to be gone. It's been a few minutes after all and if it
WAS&nbsp; maintenance or someone who isn't supposed to be there or if
they were hiding from me they would no longer be standing behind the
door. I make my way down and again look into the office. To my surprise
the person is still there. Still standing in the exact same position as
before (face pressed to the door, stock still.) I continue staring at
this person thinking that they'll move or say something and I can get
to the bottom of why they are their. As I said, I was not at all
"creeped out" by any of this. I was still in "staff mode" but I began
to think about things and trying to make sense of them. I couldn't. I
started to think about the fact that all of these doors were locked and
this person would've had to get through two of them. And that it was
late, and pitch black and they had not moved. and that no one should or
COULD be in that office. None of it made sense. It was then that I
began to be frightened. More frightened than I had ever been before.
The thought came to me suddenly. "That's a ghost." The hairs on my neck
and arms stood on end. I noticed now that the person didn't even look
as if they were breathing, much less moving.&nbsp; I backed away
slowly. finally getting to the elevator. I hit the button and nothing.
The elevator is notoriously slow and there is no way to know where it
is before it comes. I kept hitting the button and staring at the office
window. I could not see the person anymore but I felt cold. Finally the
elevator door open, I quickly jumped in and hit the 5th floor button.
Once upstairs I told my coworker what happened. He wouldn't believe me.
I told him, I was SURE what I had seen was a ghost. He laughed. It
wasn't long until he stopped laughing. a couple of weeks later this
same staff went down to use the bathroom. He got on the elevator and
hit the 2 button. I heard the elevator go down. It was not long before
he came back. He came of the elevator like a bolt. I asked him what
happened. At first he didn't want to say. Finally I dragged it out of
him. He said as the elevator door opened he went to step out, as he
looked up at the offices there was a woman standing inside at the glass
door on the right STARING AT HIM. She did not move, did not say
anything. She just stared at him. He ran back into the elevator and hit
the button for the 5th floor. He never laughed again. As a matter of
fact he had several more experiences since. That wasn't the end of the
2nd floor experiences. a month later another employee, my cousin, was
working with us one overnight. late in the evening he went to use the
bathroom. He got on the elevator, hit button 2 and went down. His trip
was shorter than the last. When the elevator opened again he was on the
floor, eyes wide and pale as a sheet. I knew he had seen something. He
got up and stepped back onto the unit. he took the first available seat
and did not say anything for several minutes. Finally he turned to me
and said " I guess you weren't kidding. I didn't believe you, but I
guess you weren't kidding." He explained that the door of the elevator
opened on the 2nd floor, as he stepped out and looked up he saw a
massive black shape standing just OUTSIDE of the glass doors of the
offices in the hall itself! He tried to run but tripped over his own
feet. he landed on the floor of the elevator and from there hit the 5th
floor button. There was one more incident, much like the other three,
only this other employee saw a woman standing where the black mass was.
he also got back on the elevator and came back upstairs. He was a new
employee and had not heard our stories yet. He quit the next week. I
talked with one of the directors of the program. He was fascinated by
all of our stories. He had worked in the building for 15 years and had
had several odd experiences himself. He decided to check into it to see
if he could find anything out. One day he was in the administrative
offices on the 2nd floor. There worked a woman who was employed at the
Y for over 30 years. As she was running around doing her work the
Director asked her what she knew about ghosts in the building. Matter
of factly she said "Oh yeah, There are ghosts." and continued her work.
The director stopped her and asked her about these ghosts that she
seemed so nonchalant about. She proceeded to tell him about how in the
late 70's and early 80's the staff on the 3rd floor had reported
numerous times that they had heard and seen someone walking around on
the 2nd floor. He also asked her if there were any ghosts in the office
I had seen the "ghost" girl in. She again, without batting an eye said
"Oh , yes. Just before the 2nd floor was taken over from residential
rooms to offices a girl had died in that same room. "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To this day I and others continue to have experiences in the Y. As a
matter of fact just this past week I was walking down the hallway doing
room checks of the residents when I felt what I thought was someone
grabbing me by the ankle. I tripped and nearly fell flat on my face. I
clearly felt a hand grab my ankle. I have no doubt. I am now more
curious than scared. I don't, however, explore the Y anymore. And I
haven't been to the 2nd floor at night in a long long time. I wonder
if, as the theory goes, that the adolescent energy in the building
(there are over 80 kids in the building at any one time.) helps to
focus and empower the spirits in the building. It is an old place and
has continuously been lived in for over 100 years. There has been alot
of tragedy there, alot of extreme emotion and a fair number of deaths.
If there were a place that were going to be haunted I think this makes
a more than fitting candidate.<br>

My Ghost Stories through 1990-2008<br>
<br>
By:cowgirlangel29@yahoo.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
1990-2004 - Hayport RD Wheelersburg, Ohio - When I was living in
Wheelersburg, Ohio&nbsp; living in the house at the time from 1990 to
2004, I experinced paranormal since I was nine years old. I would hear
knockings without any explaination and like someone shouted my name
when no one was around or sleep even I am deaf and I can hear a little
bit. Then that one night my mother claimed that she felt a little kid
tugged on her shirt and even both of us heard a ball bouncing up in the
attic. We both tried to debunk the bouning ball, and thought maybe the
wulnuts from the tree caused it. But we had no explaination on what
caused me to hear something or someone calling my name or someone
tugged my mother's shirt. At 16 yrs old, I thought I would try to talk
to the spirits. So I did. this spirit who done it I came across was
that it was a boy who possibly around six or seven years old and
possibly died from flu like illness. I asked why he was still there and
I think he was connected to me for something reason because I was the
only child in my family and I used to always talk to myself. The rumor
had it that the house was built around 1920's and that a man died in
the living room and a woman died in the kitchen. Strange thing that
there was no connect to the little boy. I done a lot of research and I
had no luck in trying to find out about the history. In 2001- Shortly
after my grandpa,&nbsp; my dad's dad passed away, the rumored be said
that he walked into the trailer and enterd the bathroom and then went
to the bedroom where he used to sleep. The trailer was sold. but I got
update information now 2009 that he may be still in the trailer doing
the same thing like he done in the past. the trailer is now in Kentucky
- my dad brought it back. Dec. 2004, Mabert RD Portsmouth, Ohio - while
my dad was in the hosptial when I was home alone and there was a lot
camaras to watch the the land at the time, I was living in Portsmouth,
Ohio. In one of the sercturity camaras, I saw something and I was like,
"What in the world was that?" and saw some kind of form a wolf head or
some kind like a dog head. Also saw a human face on the bottom of the
screen of the camara along with a big orb looked like a spot light or
something. I wasn't alone. My cousin and his friends were there with me
and thought was that a prank but it wasn't. I showed it to my mother
and my mother and my cousin and one of his friends went out and checked
it out. They didn't see anything and the one of my cousin's friends and
I saw it on the cam and my cousin's friend who was the lady, she
shouted panicly "Get out of that road, the light is following you and
you are standing behind the head of the mean dog!" I told her to settle
down or the spirits would sensed her fears and one of us would be
"attack" if it was negivate spirits. It went on for several weeks until
my father came home. 2005- In Portsmouth, Ohio, Mabert Rd - I had
several people complained that there was a man in the house and then he
disaapeared. I never saw it. some guy saw full bodied spirit walked
into the bedroom that he got so so scared that he slept in the living
room. he claimed he saw it watching him and then went into my bedroom
at the time. 2008 - Mabert Rd Portsmouth, Ohio&nbsp; - I have two
people claimed that they saw a little boy stood beside me since I left
Hayport back in 2004. I guess he followed me to a new location because
I asked him to to be my little spirit guide and come with me.&nbsp; One
of them who will be soon to be my husband said that the little boy
would smile and look at him and then tapped me on my shoulder and then
walked out of the door. I did feel the tap on my shoulder and thinking
that someone was picking on me but he was standing in the back door in
the kitchen while I was in the living room next to the front door. my
soon-to-be husband and I still teasing each other upto this day that
we&nbsp; had a little boy as a matchmaker lol. If I have more stories
like that, or what I have heard. I would keep you informed. Hope you
like this story and that I hope you don't think that I am crazy... I
may be crazy for talking to the spirit by asking questions but I was
young and curious. I never tried to proake the spirits because when I
was three years old (accorrding to my mother) I had the abiles to speak
and hear the spirits for some reason.&nbsp; <br>

My Haunting<br>
<br>
By: marj71@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I felt compelled to write this because it only happened a couple of
years ago as opposed to fifteen or twenty.&nbsp; I had a most strange
experience when I was living in Denver, CO.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd been having
trouble with my husband and we split up only for me to find someone new
and bring him to my home.&nbsp; At the time I was living in a basement
apartment on Colfax Ave.&nbsp; I would have paralytic dreams and found
that in the morning I would wake up feeling unrested.&nbsp; The dreams
were always insubstantial but fearful at the same time.&nbsp; One
morning when I woke up my boyfriend was sitting at the table looking at
pictures on the digital camera and when I asked what the problem was he
showed me the pictures.&nbsp; There were pictures of me sleeping with
this strange flowing mist over me, they almost looked like a woman
hovering over me with long flowing robes. I never saw this presence and
apparently my boyfriend didn't either until he looked at the pictures
on the camera.<br>

My Similiar Story<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; underdog_1001@yahoo.com<br>
I was just reading, " A see of voices in the night" by Ant 1111. You
know, that story brings back a memory of something that happened when I
was around 16 years old.&nbsp; We were house sitting for a friend of my
dads.&nbsp; They had been family friend all my life and seemed like
family.&nbsp; His friends mom had passed away not long prior to this
and I don't know where he was at but anywho, I'd spent the night there
several times before.&nbsp; I'd just finished watching the tonight show
with johney carson and had layed down.&nbsp; I'd only shut my eys for a
minute or two (the window was open beside the bed I was in and the
backdoor was around the corner from the head of the bed), I heard
voices like maybe four or five people were coming from the barn to the
house. Then I heard footsteps and the backdoor open. Now I know no one
else but us should have been around there and these voices sounded like
it was the most natural thing in the world to be coming in the house at
that time of night. I was scared sheetless!&nbsp; all I could think was
"you moron! why did you leave the back door open?!"&nbsp; I found I
could not move or open my eyes, I knew I was scared but even at the
time I thought surely I wasn't scared to the point of paralysis.&nbsp;
The word aliens came to mind, but aliens who spoke perfect english? It
didn't make sense.&nbsp; I heard the group walk up to the side of my
bed and stand over me talking in hushed tones like they didn't want to
wake up anyone else.&nbsp; I could tell they were right over me looking
down at me. I went through the " I have to be dreaming" reasoning
because I thought for sure I was on the verge of panic if something
sensable didn't come to mind.&nbsp; But I knew I couldn't have fell
asleep in the approx. 60 seconds or less I had layed down when I
started hearing them coming from the direction of the barn. I
understood everything that they were saying and it had something to do
with things that would happen to me in the future.&nbsp; I found this
even more disturbing. Were they angels, demons, ghost, aliens? How did
they know me so intently and what was the purpose of this?&nbsp; The
next thing I knew i woke up and it was about 1am or so and I was laying
in the living room. no pillow or blanket just sprawled out on the
living room floor with the lights and tv off so I knew I didn't fall
asleep watching tv.&nbsp; I asked the next morning if someone got up
and turned everything off.&nbsp; No one had.&nbsp; I've never sleep
walked, and I wasn't overly tired or distraught about anything.&nbsp;
Nor could I recall what they had talked about when I awoke, I just knew
it had conscerned me and my future.&nbsp; I found it very disturbing
for a while and I can't believe I forgot about it until reading that
story. </big><br>
