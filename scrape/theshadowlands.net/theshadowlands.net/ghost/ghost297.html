<p><b>Old House and 2 Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: smwalter@bryanlgh.org</b><b></b>
<p><b>Twenty-five years ago, my husband and I bought a house that had been</b>
<br><b>built about 1900.&nbsp; Two strange things happened.&nbsp; One evening
I was home</b>
<br><b>alone watching TV when my cat stood up, arched her back, and her
hair</b>
<br><b>stood up.&nbsp; Then, from my pantry off the kitchen, I heard the
sound of</b>
<br><b>something crashing and glass breaking.&nbsp; I was afraid to go
back there,</b>
<br><b>so I went across the street to a friend's house until my husband
got off</b>
<br><b>work at 11 p.m.&nbsp; We went into the pantry and never found anything
out of</b>
<br><b>place or broken.</b>
<br><b>Another time, I saw my husband off to work on the night shift and
went</b>
<br><b>upstairs and got in bed to read.&nbsp; A few minutes later, I heard
someone</b>
<br><b>coming up the steps and I called out to my husband, thinking he
had</b>
<br><b>forgotten something.&nbsp; When no one answered, I got up to check
and no one</b>
<br><b>was there.&nbsp; I checked the entire house.&nbsp; I got back in
bed and a few</b>
<br><b>minutes later, someone started up the steps again.&nbsp; I locked
my bedroom</b>
<br><b>door and stayed inside all night!</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunted Beauty School.</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lynatron@shoal.net.au</b><b></b>
<p><b>I attend a beauty school in Australia and myself, the other 3 students
and my teacher honestly think it is haunted. Actually, its not really that
impossible considering the school was renovated out of an extremely old
house, I'm talking over 100 years old. 'Our' ghost loves to fiddle with
the radio in the nail room. It turns the volume up and down, up and down,
in the end someone gets so annoyed by it that they tell ghosty to cut it
out- and it does! There isn't usually much action apart from the radio
thing when we are actually there, its when we are not there thet the party
starts. A few times I have gotten to school early and as I sit on the step
waiting for someone to come unlock the door I can hear rattling pots and
pans and numerous thumps come from inside the house. The same happens when
I am sitting on the step waiting to get picked up. Plus, a few times I
have gotten there and found the back doors unlocked, so I go inside and
no-one is there. When my teacher comes she is usually baffled as to why
the doors are open when no-one has the key but her and the principal, and
each time the principal swears she hadn't been there.</b>
<br><b>I know these arn't really scary things but I find it interesting
and it just shows you that anywhere can have a ghost.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ghost?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Cherylandvictort@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I am not sure if this qualifies as a ghost story because I am unsure
of it's meaning. First let me start by saying I have always been different.
My mother is highly sensitive and predicted the death of my father as well
as that same inner knowing saved me from death as a child for what would
have been a tragic automobile accident. All these things are too numerous
to go into here.</b>
<br><b>Perhaps I inherited some of these thing from my mother. Along with
this my other senses are more acute than anyone else that I know including
my sense of smell. All of these things at one time or another have been
both a blessing and a curse. There are very few people I talk to about
these things for fear of ridicule. My wife my mother and a couple of very
close friends are the only ones I have ever spoke with. I will now share
this with you.</b>
<br><b>This story starts when I was six months old as told to me by my
mother but I will start with the incident first. It happened about fifteen
years ago at a local cemetery. I was married to my former wife at the time.
A friend of ours had recently passed away and we were visiting his grave
site. After we said our good-byes we noticed that it was a very old cemetery
and began to read the names and dates off the headstones.</b>
<br><b>After about fifteen minutes of walking around we noticed an old
woman walking down the street parallel with the cemetery. She walked with
a rather odd limp as if she had one bad foot and moved very slowly. She
was a lady of rather tall stature possibly five feet nine inches and dressed
entirely in black. She could not have been more than twenty feet from us
and It was a spring afternoon so I got a good look at her. She was dressed
odd and out of date. Maybe wearing what a woman what have worn in the early
nineteen twenties.</b>
<br><b>My former wife made a comment under her breath about her shopping
for her clothes in an antique store. While all of these things are certainly
odd it would not be unusual to see a woman possibly in her late sixties
or early seventies dressed out of date and certainly the color black was
appropriate of someone in mourning but that's not what struck me. I immediately
sensed something was wrong. It was not the feeling of fear or dread or
the premonitions I am so familiar with. This was much different and I knew
something was wrong with what I was seeing. She looked completely solid
like any human being would but I knew she was different.</b>
<br><b>As she got directly in front of us she stopped and turned to face
us. She looked directly at me with a look I can only describe as recognition.
She smiled very sweetly and nodded her head and turned and started to walk
away. My wife looked at me with a perplexed look on her face and asked
me, "Do you know her from some place?"</b>
<br><b>I was about to answer my wife when I looked back and the old woman
had vanished. It was like she never was there. she could not have been
out of my sight for more than a couple seconds. I grabbed my wife be the
arm and pushed her toward the car because she seemed frozen. Maybe it was
the shock of what she just saw.</b>
<br><b>We did not speak about it till later that evening and than we began
to compare notes maybe just to reassure each other that what we had witnessed
was not a hallucination. After that we never spoke of it till about two
or three months later we were over visiting my mother.</b>
<br><b>I am not sure how the subject came about but I began to tell my
mother what happened to us in the cemetery. She listened very intently
to the story. After I had finished she asked me to describe the old woman
to her in detail. She began to tell me something she had never told me
before.</b>
<br><b>According to my mother when I was six months old she my father and
my older brother took a train trip back to my fathers home state of Texas.
She had never met my fathers mother and family and my father wanted his
mother to meet his wife and son's. We were only there a few days when I
became very ill with a fever. It was decided that possibly the climate
change was the problem so my parents cut short their vacation and boarded
a train for home.</b>
<br><b>On the way home they had to stop the train in Amarillo to bring
a doctor aboard because I was so ill. The doctor told my mother because
of my young age and my 104 fever that I may not make it and there was not
much that he could do for me.</b>
<br><b>My father and brother went to sit at the front of the train because
they did not want to watch me die. My mother held me in her arms listening
to me gasp for air praying for a miracle. As she sat there holding me she
began to feel strange and noticed that someone was standing beside her.
She looked up and seen a rather tall old woman looking down at her with
a look of great concern on her face.</b>
<br><b>"I see your baby is very ill" she said to my mother. My mother said
the old woman told her she had been a doctor at a woman's prison. She bent
down and took off her black gloves and placed her hand on my forehead gently.
After a moment she stood up and put her gloves back on. She looked at my
mother a smiled sweetly and said "Your baby will be fine now I have just
taken him to see my doctor."</b>
<br><b>Within the space of thirty minutes my fever broke. Two hours later
my breathing had returned to normal. By that evening my mother said I was
smiling at her.</b>
<br><b>I guess we will never know for sure if what I saw in the cemetery
was the old woman on the train. As I said my mother is very sensitive and
she said although she never felt threatened by the woman on the train she
knew that she was not of this world. Like my mother I knew what I saw in
the cemetery was not of this world.</b>
<br><b>My sensitivity has saved me many times from what could have been
disastrous consequences. But knowing things sometimes can be a wretched
curse because there are things in this world you cannot avoid or alter.
Knowing what lies beyond a door can sometimes frighten haunt one soul.
Just maybe sometimes ignorance is the real bliss.</b><b></b>

<br><b>is doug i am 15 i live in omaha nebraska we heard this thing from
my</b>
<br><b>friend about something called balls cemetary he said it was haunted&nbsp;

go there and</b>
<br><b>trampse around loudly you will see the gate keeper wich supposedly
is a 7 ft</b>
<br><b>tall apparation of a man gaurding the gate he said that the house
at the</b>
<br><b>back of the cemetary was haunted by the man who used to live there
the third</b>
<br><b>thing he said was that if you made the cemetary mad the grave stones
would</b>
<br><b>tip over and the finale thing he said was something about the fallen
angel</b>

the years</b>
<br><b>he said never to make the satatue mad. he said that the last people
who spit</b>
<br><b>on the satatue were killed 36 hours later though i was still skeptical.&nbsp;

saw was an</b>
<br><b>old cemetary so i kept walking with my friends the first thing the
scarred</b>
<br><b>me was the fallen angel statue was there i thought he made it up!

<p><b>By: zerosoldier@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>this is an update for the typo tunnel located in perry county kentucky.
myself and 3 other friends have been there a few times lately after finding
out about it through this site. we have heard really strange thud sounds
inside the tunnel. and we also have heard things all over and around the
tunnel what sounds like animals in the weeds but once you notice it the
sounds stop. we went inside the tunnel and didnt get even half way through
and a friend of mine heard a shimmy sound and saw something coming right
at us aggresivsly and very low to the ground and charging at us while making
the sound.we went back out of the tunnel and then myself and 2 others went
back in and i got about half way inside the tunnel again and looked up
and coming around the corner was very low to the ground level with the
tracks a white sheet almost and it suddently rose up and took the form
of what seemed to be an older heavyset lady and the spirit rose to the
top of the tunnel and when it hit the top of the tunnel it burst into mist.
the entire time we were inisde my friend waiting for us in his jeep said
he could hear sounds all over outside of the tunnel and felt something
on the tracks.</b>

<p><b>This is My Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: firebirdgurl2000@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hey my name is ash.&nbsp; When i was about 11 years old i was staying
the night at my grandma's house.&nbsp; I woke up very strangely in the
middle of the night.&nbsp; All the lights were off, including my night
light i had left on. I looked at the end of my bed and thought i saw my
grandma.&nbsp; But as i woke up more i could tell it was not her mostly
because i could see through her!&nbsp; It was an old woman. She was kind
of fat and she was a milky transparent white. She was standin right there
at the end of my bed lookin straight at me with her hands raised over her
head. Just staring at me and swaying a little bit. I was so scared i couldnt
think of what to do. But then i quickly decided to try and make a break
for the door. But as i went to run for it something stopped me. And this
is were it gets really weird. There was about 5 or 6 other old ladies right
next to me. RIGHT BESIDE MY BED! they all only had the top halfs of their
bodies, from the waist up. and they all had there hands above their heads
looking at me with thier empty eyes. i was freaking out. i started crying
i looked at all the old ladies that were around my bed and i didnt know
what to do. Then in a panic i jumped off my bed and ran for the light switch!
I flicked and instantly turned around. They were all gone. Every single
one. i hit my knees and started crying. After that i had a hard time falling
asleep for about 2 years. and to this day i still need a night light!</b>

<br><b>The Shared Ghostly Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: babyracer_8@bellsouth.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was about 6 or 7 I had an experience with a ghost at the house
my grandparents use to live in. I always heard stuff and dreamed about
ghosts when I was in that house, but this one night was totally different.
My grandmother always slept in the bed with me when I stayed. Let from
my room I could see into the living room. There was a little hall between
my room and that room. On the left was a bathroom and on the right was
another bedroom, the one my sister had. This one night as I lay there with
my eyes closed trying to sleep I heard the bathroom light come on(the fan
automatically came on), I figured my sister had just gotten up to use the
restroom, so I opened my eyes and waited for her to come out. I heard the
toilet flush and then the water in the sink come on and then go off. I
expected to see her come out, but what I saw has stuck with me. When the
light went out I saw what I thought was, well my grandfather. It was a
large man, and he stopped in the doorway of the room and just stared at
me. I was about to say something to him when I realized I could see the
couch in the living room...I could see right through him! That's when I
realized&nbsp; it wasn't him. I didn't scream or put my head under the
blanket. I dont know why, but I just wasn't scared. It was like he knew
I saw him and knew because at that moment he turned and walked into my
sisters room. I didn't tell anyone because I was so young, I didn't understand
what I saw. Years later, my sister was driving and she and I were on our
way home from town. I got the sudden erge to tell her what happened. So
I started telling her, she stopped the car and pulled over on the side
of the road and finished the story. The same thing had happened to her.
When she was my age and she was in the same room that I had been in. I
was just a baby when that happened to her so I never knew until then. The
only difference between her story and mine was our reaction. She freaked
and screamed and made my grandfather search the house. That isn't the only
shared experience we've had but that is the first and the strangest since
she's 7 years older than me and it happened when we were the same age....just
7 years apart. We're the only 2 to witness it. Our younger brother has
never seen anything like that and he stayed in the same room we did at
the same age.....it's so weird! I have sooo many stories to tell, and so
few to tell them to! LOL Hope you enjoyed the story!</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Ghosts in my House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: peridot_angel@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My family moved into this house about 6 or 7 years ago. My parents
were</b>
<br><b>divorced so at the time I was living with my dad in Pottstown. When
he died</b>
<br><b>in 2000 I moved back down here and tried to move on. I think it
was about</b>
<br><b>two years ago that I began to notice there was something strange
about the</b>
<br><b>house. Around Christmas time we usualy hang an ornimate on my back
door that</b>
<br><b>has bells on it. One day my dog came into the kitchen and looked
at the</b>
<br><b>door, i was sitting in the dining room at the time. I could&nbsp;
see that he was</b>
<br><b>still pretty far away from the bells. Anyway as I was watching him
the bells</b>
<br><b>suddenly started to ring. I couldnt figure out how it had happened,
and I</b>
<br><b>assumed it was my imagination. This happened a couple of times.
The next</b>
<br><b>thing that happened was not too long after Christmas. I used&nbsp;
to be kind of</b>
<br><b>a hermit and stayed in my room a lot. One night while I was up there
i had</b>
<br><b>my door opened and could hear my family downstairs. As I was watching
t.v. I</b>
<br><b>suddenly heard an ear peircing scream. It sounded like a woman screaming</b>
<br><b>from my moms bedroom. I ran downstairs and asked my sister and brother
if</b>
<br><b>they had heard it too, hoping it was car breaks or something. They
just</b>
<br><b>looked at me like I was crazy and said they hadnt heard anything.
I began to</b>
<br><b>wonder if I&nbsp; really was hearing things. I would have left it
at that except</b>
<br><b>for when i started hearing the footsteps coming in and out of my
moms room</b>
<br><b>and noticed the shadows moving down the hall when no one was up
there. I</b>
<br><b>hear it all the time when im sitting in my living room which is
right under</b>
<br><b>my moms room. The footsteps are heavy and loud, like a big mans
footsteps.</b>
<br><b>Then my sister told me that she saw a tall man with a hat standing
in her</b>
<br><b>bedroom doorway one night watching her. Thats when i began to suspect
that</b>
<br><b>someone may have been raped or murdered in my moms room. My dog
acts</b>
<br><b>strangely sometimes too. Recently he will go over to the stairs
and prop his</b>
<br><b>head on the second or third to last step and just stare upstairs.
He also</b>
<br><b>stands at the top of the basement stairs and stares down them as
well.</b>
<br><b>Things have pretty much been like that for awhile and i got used
to it,</b>
<br><b>until my best friend slept over not too long ago. She brought over
her</b>
<br><b>digital camera so we could take pictures of my moms room. Well we
didnt find</b>
<br><b>anything in the pictures of her room but when we took a picture
of the</b>
<br><b>mirror in my room we noticed a figure in the reflection. We knew
it wasnt</b>
<br><b>our reflection because it was way too tall and was directely in
the middle</b>
<br><b>of the mirror looking straight out and we were off to the side of
my room at</b>
<br><b>an angle. The figure looked like it was wearing a long black coat
with a</b>
<br><b>hood. I couldnt make out the face entirely but it seemed to be very
pale.</b>
<br><b>Another time my friend slept over she saw a man under my dining
room table.</b>
<br><b>She said he was looking in my direction only she said it looked
like a</b>
<br><b>corpse. She said his eyes were sunken in. I couldnt see it because
i couldnt</b>
<br><b>see under my table from the angle I was at and by the time i moved
to look</b>
<br><b>the figure had vanished. Now remember how i said my dog would stand
at the</b>
<br><b>top of the basement stairs and look down them? Well not long after
that I</b>
<br><b>watched him go over to the stairs, stare down them for a moment,
then he</b>
<br><b>laid down and stayed perfectly still for almost 5 minutes. There
are certian</b>
<br><b>areas of the house that are uncomfortable for me to be in. Like
right here</b>
<br><b>by my computer, sometimes when I am sitting here i will suddenly
get very</b>
<br><b>dizzy. The same thing happens at the top of my stairs sometimes.
But the one</b>
<br><b>area in this house I hate the most is the back room in my basement.
I always</b>
<br><b>feel unwanted there and sometimes its very cold down there. I have
heard</b>
<br><b>noises like things slamming or falling from down there. Recently
i have been</b>
<br><b>having bizarre dreams as well. I usually cant remeber much of them,
but the</b>
<br><b>other night i had one i cant forget. I was with someone, I dont
know who,</b>
<br><b>and we had found a body. It was badly decayed but i knew it was
a women</b>
<br><b>because of the long red hair still attatched to the skull. There
was also a</b>
<br><b>neclace with a red pendant on in. I remember taking it from her
body. I dont</b>
<br><b>know why this dream bothered me so much, and i cant help but think
it has</b>
<br><b>something to do with whats been happening in my house. The last
thing i want</b>
<br><b>to mention is the pictures that were taken in my backyard. My friends
and i</b>
<br><b>were taking pictures of each other and one of them was filled with
orbs. Now</b>
<br><b>Im not entirely sure if the orbs are spirits or just something from
the</b>
<br><b>camera, but after everything i have seen lately, I definately am
willing to</b>
<br><b>believe anything. My house was built near a cemetary so i can only
assume</b>
<br><b>it has something to do with that.</b><b></b>

<p><b>THE TRUE STORIES:</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: RudyBM111743@msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Another encounter with the Unknown</b>
<br><b>Today, May 10, 2004 and last week.&nbsp; The paranormal, ghosts,
haunting and related stories have become my favorite reading materials.&nbsp;
While I take interest in these stories, I was skeptical and could not believe
in many of them.&nbsp; I thought stories about objects being moved from
one place to another, or things being thrown across by some unseen force
were just inventions of some writers.&nbsp; Now I believe.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I witnessed something similar just this afternoon and one day last week.&nbsp;
I was doing electrical installation in my car when something impossible
to explain happened just this afternoon.&nbsp; Having finished installing
a device under the console, I was reinstalling the console when I heard
something metallic fly off inside near its rear.&nbsp; I did not want anything
improperly installed, so I decided to check.&nbsp; There was nothing there
that would fly off.&nbsp; I looked around the little space at the console's
end, there was not a piece of metal that flew off.&nbsp; So I went on and
the whole installation was about finished but for one screw at the front
end corner of the console on the passenger side.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>inserted the last screw into the hole but discovered the clip fastener
was missing.&nbsp; I was thinking it might have been dislodged off the
bracket when I unscrewed the console.&nbsp; But this was impossible to
happen; if it did, it would not have escaped my attention.&nbsp; Also,
if it fell into the tight crevices in the dashboard support, it would be
extremely laborious to retrieve it, so I decided to find and buy a replacement
clip the next day.&nbsp; But just as I picked up the last tool to stow
away, there it was, the clip was right on the floor at the passenger side.&nbsp;
In bewilderment, I just kept asking myself repeatedly how the clip fastened
to the dashboard support for the front end corner of the console could
fly off when I was reinstalling its rear end and its front end had not
even touched the support yet!&nbsp; Impossible!&nbsp; But it happened!&nbsp;
As though someone had yanked the clip fastener off the support and threw
it on the floor!&nbsp; One day last week another little inexplicable incident
happened; in my car also; also at the right side of the console.&nbsp;
I was about to insert one relay into the relay panel in the console.&nbsp;
The relay accidentally slipped off my fingers and dropped a distance of
about two inches on to the adjustment lever of the passenger seat.&nbsp;
I heard it hit the adjustment lever, then it disappeared.&nbsp; I desperately
searched probably more than half an hour for the relay on the passenger
side floor, under the seat, anywhere else it could have landed.&nbsp; The
relay vanished!&nbsp; Very upset and frustrated, I gave up searching and
was getting ready to leave the car to find and buy a replacement relay
when I saw the missing relay on the driver's side floor next to my right
foot beside the console.&nbsp; It was good I did not step on it.&nbsp;
One of its pins was bent.&nbsp; Up to this writing, I cannot explain how
something very light in weight and dropping only about two inches on a
non spring rod could fly over about 12 inches clear an obstruction (the
console) and land on the floor on the other side of the obstruction (driver's
side)!&nbsp; This event does not conform to the laws of physics and gravity!&nbsp;
But then again, it truly happened.</b><b></b>

<p><b>She Has Linked to Me</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: henley1@ametro.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I first moved into my house in Mississippi I noticed some things
that were extremely out of the normal happening from day one.</b>
<br><b>When I would try to go to sleep I would hear my name being whispered,
and my dog (who is a pitbull and by breed, does not scare easily) would
wake up in the middle of the night crying very loudly.</b>
<br><b>Then, one night I was walking to the kitchen to get a glass of coke
and I looked over into the living room and standing there was nothing more
than a translucent habit such as a nun's habit. Well this startled me big
time so in true human form as we all do, I moved slowly and quietly back
to my bedroom. That very night my name was whispered until I spoke back.
There was no reply to my speaking, I think that she just wanted to see
if I could hear her.</b>
<br><b>The one (and only) time that I ever saw the full apparition of the
nun was when my dog had woke up again crying I walked into the living room
and there I saw the full body of the nun gently petting my dog's head and
back. The dog did not enjoy it and was very scared to the point of trembling.
I kindly told the nun: "My dog is very afraid of you, if you like you may
visit with me, but please leave her be." At that the nun disappeared and
has not shown up again, but her presence is felt everywhere I go. She follows
me in my car my house, my office and anywhere else I go. I do not know
what this phenomena is called but it seems she has linked her self to me.
Sometimes if I don't answer her whispers, she will bang doors and if I
still ignore her she will go back to the dog and make her cry again.</b>
<br><b>I looked into town records and found out that this house used to
be a nun's rectory in the late 1800's. However, I could not find where
any of the nuns had met their eternity in this house, maybe she just came
back after death. I don't really know, but what I am certain of is that
she has listened to me and is happy and aggressive to communicate. I am
now trying to figure a way to set ground rules with her about her maybe
not following me into the bathroom and her not banging doors and things
when I am trying to sleep and she has decided she wants to chat.</b>
<br><b>That's my story lol</b>

<br><b>Red Eyes</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: hazard2evry1@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Okay this one is about my friend Beto he doesn't want his family
name to be revealed anyway he and his brother and cousins just bought a
new house the year was probly around 1992 or 1993 so the kids figured (ages
8-11) what is a better way to kick it off than to play hide and go seek.</b>
<br><b>Beto (8) went to go hide in the basement since it is dark and scary
(Even now I'm still scared of it) he hid in a closet and he thought no
one would ever find him, Well some thing did. Not his brother, not his
cousin, a ghost. He saw red eyes floating around him. He ran out of that
place almost about to pee his pants. HE lived in that house for about eight
or nine years then moved to Largo, Florida. He had many more visits from
them at his old house and now at his new one.</b><b></b>

<p><b>One of My spirit Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I've had many experiences, but I will tell you the most recent one
that was mainly happening to me, but seen&nbsp; and heard by my husband
as well. I've always felt that something was following me, a male presence.
I should also mention that sometimes in my dreams I can wake my self up
if the dream is bothering me or just plain dumb, but not always.&nbsp;
Well one night me and my husband went to sleep and I was dreaming a dream
about me getting raped. So I thought to myself in the dream that it was
stupid and I'll just wake up, well I woke up to see a face next to the
side of my bed of a man just barely being able to see him. I froze, it
scared the crap outta me. Then the spirit started to walk around the room
very angrily and I could hear him breathing like he was pissed off. I sat
up quickly as so did my husband, and then the bedroom door opened and the
spirit sound stopped. I looked at my husband and he looked so scared and
he said to me " did you hear it walking around?" I said "yes" then we talked
about it a little bit and tried to go back to sleep.&nbsp; Usually when
I've dealt with this spirit he's not so loud, you know he's there, but
he's being quiet. Well another night I was sleeping and he was up to his
old tricks bothering me and I just became so angry I sat up in my bed and
yelled that he needs to leave now and he's not welcome here. So far after
me saying that he's been quiet, but me and my husband still feel that he
is around. I feel as if the spirit was the one raping me in the dream,
and sometimes when I go to lay down to sleep I feel like someone is touching
me inappropriately. I can honestly say I'm happy for the fact that I know
I'm not crazy and to have someone else witness this experience with me
is relieving.</b><b></b>

<p><b>One of Many Ghost Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: gimpylosers@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Laurel . I live in Alberta, Canada. My three sisters and
I strongly beleive that our house is haunted. We're not really sure how
many spirits share our house with us, but one of my sisters thinks that
there are seven. They all seemed to be nice except for one. We never named
any of them by the way because awkward things happened. Anyways, this one
ghost was different from the rest. I've been the only one so far that has
actually seen him. And I've only seen him a couple of times anyways. At
first he was mainly on this one flight of stairs. (There's two flights
of stairs in our house that both lead to the kitchen)From the one flight
of stairs you can see almost our whole basement except for mine and my
older sister's rooms. As you go down the stairs there's this kind of railing
thing that looks like jail cell bars. Through the bars you can see the
TV and our chesterfield (couch). I can't sleep well at night so I watch
TV until I get tired or scared or something. Now, I'll be watching a movie
and all of the sudden there would be something on the stairs. Like I'll
hear it or see it out of the corner of my eye. Than my dog will back away
to the other side of the room. She watches the stairs through those bars
the whole time. It's very unerving. I'm always too scared to look cause
I just know what it is. I eventually have to though cause I have to go
passed those stairs to get to my room. For some reason I've made up this
thing where if I don't see it than it won't see me. It gives me some courage.
My dog refuses to go down those stairs. She'll rather go all the way around
to the other flight.</b>
<br><b>I didn't see any of the ghosts in this house for a whlie and I still
don't. Maybe they left or something. If they did than they left one of
their comrades behind. I'm pretty sure that it was the ghost on the stairs.
I just got that feeling you know. When I do see him it's only his head.
I know it sounds stupid, but truly I've only seen a head. It looked so
real. He wasn't transparent. I thought that was different. Both times I
saw him he was smirking. He looked so devilish. And you know how you only
see ghosts out of the corner of your eye. Well, both times I seen him he
was looking straight at me and I was looking straight at him. Right into
his eyes. They're so black. I couldn't see anything but black in his eyes.
Both sightings happened on that flight of stairs I was talking about earlier.
I would be looking at the ground as I ran down the downstairs hallway cause
about three quarters of the sightings happen downstairs so I'm much happier
not knowing somethings there. I turned to get on the stairs and he was
right in my face. I think I would have ran into it if I didn't look up.
It was so odd though because we just looked at each other. It seemed like
he could see me too. Then I can't remember anything else from that day.
It was very creepy.</b>
<br><b>My sisters are all sceptics untill something can't be proven. Then
they beleive. We couldn't figure out if it was my imagination or not. Nothing
on the stairs could have come close to even looking like a head. They couldn't
explain it.</b>
<br><b>I still haven't seen any of the others. We think somethings trying
to scare the crapp out us now. Things have gotten really wierd. Now nothing
can be explain. It's also odd because you won't see anything for days and
then all of the sudden BOOM! There's a head floating in front of you.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Confidante</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: hottamalee1977@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have read a few stories on your site that sound similar to mine.&nbsp;
So I decided to submit it.&nbsp; Forgive me if it is a little long because
it went on for a long time.</b>
<br><b>It started when I was 7years old my Grandfather had passed away
a few months before&nbsp; and I had not let myself&nbsp; mourn yet... My
sister and I&nbsp; shared a room at the time we had a bunk bed set. She
slept on the top bunk I on the bottom.&nbsp; I waited until I heard her
snoring and then I started to cry and let my grief out.</b>
<br><b>The room suddenly dropped in temperature&nbsp; but I really didn't
notice because of my crying. Then I felt someone near my bed thinking it
was my sister I rolled over it was not my sister but I was not afraid.&nbsp;
I felt a had on my forehead pushing my hair back, I heard in my head everything
is all right, don't cry anymore.&nbsp; Then she pulled the cover up to
my chin and tucked me in.&nbsp; This went on at least two times a week.</b>
<br><b>Four years later my sister moved out this is when she became a more
permanent figure in my life.&nbsp; She came one night that I couldn't sleep
so I started talking to her.&nbsp; I ask her name she told me Elizabeth.&nbsp;
Let me describe her to you.&nbsp; She had long dark hair, pale porcelain
white skin, she wore a black bell dress with a hat and black veil.&nbsp;
I also ask her why she was here and she told me she was here to watch over
me.&nbsp; I would talk to her every day even if she wasn't there it made
me feel better.</b>
<br><b>The next big event with Elizabeth happened about the time I was
11 or 12.&nbsp; My best friend and I were bored and we were home alone
so we decided to play hide n seek,&nbsp; Angel was out side counting and
I was hiding inside the house, I was hiding in the kitchen which was on
the other side of the house from my bedroom and bathroom. I heard Angel
scream&nbsp; and the front door slam. She lived across the street from
me so I knew it didn't take her long to get home.&nbsp; I called and ask
her why she left she told me she saw someone beside the bathroom and thought
it was me so she went around the corner and said found ya... and saw Elizabeth...
she told Angel to GET OUT.&nbsp; She was not a evil spirit but she did
not like Angel.&nbsp; I found out a couple of years later that she was
stealing from my family.</b>
<br><b>When I was in high school I had a sleep over with three of my friends
there where four of us sleeping in a full bed.&nbsp; I had never told them
about&nbsp; Elizabeth. It was time to go to bed because we were going to
a parade early in the morning.&nbsp; I fell asleep.&nbsp; The next morning&nbsp;
they were all freaked out telling me that a woman had appeared in the room
dressed in black and she put her finger to her lips and they all heard
Shhhhhhhhh, you will wake her up.&nbsp; Lisa did not believe in ghost and
was a very avid church goer.&nbsp; She was the one who was the most freaked
about it.&nbsp; She told everyone at school about my ghost.</b>
<br><b>I was having trouble making up my mind about two guys I had a crush
on.&nbsp; I had their pictures in a photo album and was actually crying
over something one of them had did or said to me.&nbsp; Elizabeth appeared
and the Photo album flipped by itself to a pic of the one I felt the most
for. That was the day I first saw&nbsp; her face. She was angry at me for
even being attracted to the other guy,&nbsp;&nbsp; a gust of wind came
through my room and swept the veil from her face.&nbsp; I can still remember
how ale she was.</b>
<br><b>The older I got the less I saw of her.&nbsp; My Mom finally started
to believe me one day.&nbsp; She and I had a big argument the night before.&nbsp;
I went to school mad at Mom. I had planned to run away to my brother in
Montana. So I wrote my note and left it on my desk,&nbsp; Mom never went
into my room without me there but she told me that she got a feeling she
should go in. When she got in the room it was cold and she looked at my
desk and found the note.&nbsp; Then she was told by a voice in the room
to call and check on me.&nbsp; She contemplated this for a few minutes
then she heard the telephone cord hit the wall and she felt a cold gust
toward the phone. so she called. I got home and we apologized for our fight.</b>
<br><b>I haven't seen or heard from Elizabeth in almost 8 years now.&nbsp;
But I will never forget her and just how she would listen to me.&nbsp;
My family knows she existed because they all at one time or another felt
her.</b>
<br><b>Thank you for listening to my story&nbsp;&nbsp; This is just my
favorite experience with the supernatural.&nbsp; I will submit some others
at a different time.</b>

<br><b>Local Grave Yard</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: StormSpell65@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>One day, my friend Kristina was having a party. We went to the local
graveyard. When you think of graveyards you think of ghosts and being scared,
right? Wrong. I felt totally safe and welcome in the graveyard, and I felt
a desire to go over to the left side of the graveyard. After that we went
down to the public school to hang out. I was chatting with a friend as
we walked around the school. Near the back their are stairs leading down
to the soccer field, near there we had this strange cold feeling, as if
someone had dumped cold water over our heads. I said "lets get out of here"
as we both saw a shadowy figure go past the middle of the stairs. We turned
to walk back to the others, when something was thrown at us. We ran screaming.
Later our friends checked it out and they all said they had creepy feelings
while near that area. Two people saw the shadowy figure and discribed it
to be carrying a bag and wearing a hat. It was tall too.</b>
<br><b>Later I found out why I wanted to go to the left side of the graveyard
so much, my friend's little cousin was burried there, killed at age four.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Babysitters House</b><b></b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>hi! my name is jan and i have a story that i would like to share
with you.</b>
<br><b>i am 23 years old and have 3 children. when i started a new job
i needed a</b>
<br><b>babysitter to watch my first child, my other 2 weren't born yet.
my mom</b>
<br><b>suggested that i ask a friend of the family,"tina", to watch her
because</b>
<br><b>she watches kids out of her house and we have known her all of our
lives.</b>
<br><b>well i called tina and she said yes so my daughter started going
to her</b>
<br><b>house. one sunday while eating sunday dinner at my grandmother's
house she</b>
<br><b>started telling me that tina's mother had told her that some strange
things</b>
<br><b>were going on in tina's house. well i brushed it off because tina
had never</b>
<br><b>told me anything herself. that monday when i was leaving my daughter
off</b>
<br><b>before i headed to work i asked tina if things were going on in
her</b>
<br><b>house,telling her that her mother had told my grandmother who in
turn told</b>
<br><b>me, she told me yes. she said that there had been instances in which
there</b>
<br><b>would be knocking at the front door and when you go to answer it
no one's</b>
<br><b>there. she said one day when she was watching her cousin's 2 yr.
old, the</b>
<br><b>only child she had that day, she put her to sleep in her bedroom
and kept</b>
<br><b>the door open so she could hear her if she woke up or started crying.
tina</b>
<br><b>said she was sitting in her rocking chair, which was close to the
hall</b>
<br><b>where the bedrooms are, when she saw the little girl standing there
looking</b>
<br><b>at her. tina looked at her and told her to come to her but the little
girl</b>
<br><b>would not go any further than the edge of the hallway. she said
the little</b>
<br><b>girl had a paint stick in her hand and she kept waving it around,well</b>
<br><b>tina's husband had just been painting the day before and had put
the paint</b>
<br><b>can and the stick behind their bedroom door. tina kept calling the
girl to</b>
<br><b>come to her but she wouldn't so tina said she got up to go pick
her up but</b>
<br><b>as soon as she stood up the little girl took off down the hallway
to the</b>
<br><b>bedroom. tina went after her and said when she got to her bedroom
the door</b>
<br><b>was closed but she didn't hear it shut. when she opened the door
the little</b>
<br><b>girl was still asleep on the floor. i admit i did get a little freaked
out</b>
<br><b>when she told me that story but i guess because i had never seen
anything</b>
<br><b>happen in her house myself i didn't feel scared. well things didn't
happen</b>
<br><b>all the time her house. things would happen for a while then stop
and start</b>
<br><b>up again later. after the birth of my second child,tina watched
her too, i</b>
<br><b>was dropping her off by tina's house on my way to work, my daughter
was</b>
<br><b>about 5 or 6 months old, tina was in the kitchen and i was in the
living</b>
<br><b>with my daughter and 2 other kids she was watching. i set my baby
on the</b>
<br><b>floor in her carrier and was about to take her out when out of the
corner</b>
<br><b>of my eye towards the hallway where the bedrooms are i saw a little
girl</b>
<br><b>that looked just like tina's daughter. tina's kids were still asleep
in</b>
<br><b>their rooms. the girl looked like she was trying to hide by the
edge of the</b>
<br><b>sofa so i wouldn't see her but i did. to me that just wasn't the</b>
<br><b>personality of tina's daughter, she is the type of child that when
she</b>
<br><b>walks into a room she likes to be noticed and have a lot of attention
on</b>
<br><b>her. so i took my baby out of the carrier and stood up, when i did
the</b>
<br><b>little girl took off running down the hallway. so i went in the
kitchen and</b>
<br><b>gave my baby to tina and went to work. on my way to work i kept
thinking of</b>
<br><b>the story that tina had told me so long ago and i couldn't help
but think</b>
<br><b>that i had seen a ghost. when i got to work i called tina and asked
her if</b>
<br><b>her daughter was up,she said no. i asked her if after i left did
her</b>
<br><b>daughter come out of the room for any reason and she said no. well
i told</b>
<br><b>tina what had happened and she went in to check on her daughter
and she was</b>
<br><b>still sleeping and had never gotten up. and when i described to
tina what</b>
<br><b>the little girl looked like and what she was wearing it was as if
i had</b>
<br><b>seen her little girl standing there. tina got scared and woke up
her older</b>
<br><b>daughters and told them what happened because no one other than
who lived</b>
<br><b>in the house and ever seen anything in her house, not any of the
other</b>
<br><b>parents that drop off their kids there had ever seen anyting. when
i&nbsp; got</b>
<br><b>off the phone with tina i called my mom and told her what happened
and she</b>
<br><b>said she was going to call my aunt. my aunt and two of her friends
from</b>
<br><b>church went to tina's house over the weekend and prayed with tina
and her</b>
<br><b>family and walked through and blessed her house. since that day
nothing</b>
<br><b>else has happened. i have since become a stay at home mom and my
children</b>
<br><b>do not go to tina's house anymore but once in a while to visit.
i still</b>
<br><b>cannot get over what i saw and the feeling i got when i saw it.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Spook in the Basement</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: deadkennedysfan2003@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I just recently got a job with the emporium in my dorms. I have to
stock soda, shelves, et. cetera when I'm not working at the cash register.
On this particular night, I was loading the soda onto the cart when I heard
footsteps from the next room. The two rooms are separated by a "cage" wall,
so I could see everything in the next room easily. I caught a glimpse of
a black figure moving around in there before it disappeared into thin air.
I tried to ignore it and get back to work, but about ten minutes later,
I heard the footsteps again and, sure enough, there was the figure.</b>
<br><b>I talked to my roommate about it and discovered that some guy killed
himself in one of the dorm towers within the past few years. Whether it
was him or someone else, I can't say for sure. All I know was that it was
a wickedly cool experience.</b>

<p><b>My mom was looking for her watch last summer. She searched every

any where. She asked my brothers if they had seen it....still no site of
the watch. She walked in her room, and on her bed is a Mrs. Beasley doll,
she received it as a christmas present from my grandma for christmas that
year. On Mrs. Beasley's wrist was my mom's watch. She immediatly called
my dad at work, and started swearing and asked if he had done it. Over
and over again, he told her that he didnt do it. She then went and questioned
my brothers over and over again .....and no one in my house put it on the
doll's wrist.</b>
<br><b>One day, my mom came home from work on her lunch break and before
she left the house, she closed all of the bedroom and bathroom doors. (She
has a habbit of having the closed 24-7.) She left for work and came home
later that day. She walked in the door and found every single door upstairs
wide opened....nobody was home the whole day and the doors were locked,
and there was not a spare key any where!</b><b></b>

<p><b>Richard Moya Park in Texas</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: latinqueen_15@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I saw you put that the park want haunted by ghosts but let me tell
you what i've seen and heard. Along time ago about a four years back someone
had told me a lady and her and her baby had got into a car wreck there
under the bridge and that they haunt it on halloween at midnight. I didnt
believe it so i waited for halloween to come around and me and my friend
went. We went around 12:00 am Midnight. Nothing happend. So I was like
this is Stupid its not real as we were walking away the wind started to
pick up so we sat down and held each other. The we could here a lady screaming
and crying and then a baby screamind. Neadless, to say we got the hell
out of there. But After that I never went back. Until a couple of years
after that when I got married. My husband said that he went over the bridge
there and he could here a loud howling noise and then a bunch of laughing.
Also, My husband heard from on of his friends that nomes (trolls) lived
underneath or by the bridge. And that a cop had went to patrol the area
one day because he saw something run on the bridge, being passed curfew
he went to go check, he radioed it in, and called for back up, they say
when the cops got there they found blood and a couple od peices of is body.
They didnt say what it was but, I am thinking it was the nomes. cause when
they come out the come out in hundreds. Also, I I heard that on juneteenth
(jund 19th) the day when lincoln freed the slaves that this man didnt want
to give up his slaves that he hung them up on the bridge, and they say
that if you go on that day you can see them. I dont dont of that story
is tru or not. every year i want to go and everytime the day comes around
i forget and wont remember till after its passed. I went about a month
ago like at 2:00 in the morning and as we were walking on the bridge we
could here things but couldnt see anything. Then the cops came so it ruined
are night. but I though you might wanted to know. Thanks</b><b></b>

<p><b>Our Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Killianjdark@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;Hello my name is Andy Austin. My wife and I have had some weird</b>
<br><b>experiences in her uncles old house that we moved into about 12
years</b>
<br><b>Ago. We moved in about a year after he died in the house. The first
few weeks were quiet but after that it all changed. The first thing that
happened was I was drawing at my art table and set down my pencil to erase
something and my pencil was gone. This type of thing happened many times
after it. So after a while it did not bug me I was used to it. One time
my wife's brother spent the night on our couch. When he woke up he found
his buttons taken of his shirt in a neat pile on the coffee table. Our</b>
<br><b>Oldest child kept talking to someone in her playroom she was about
3 years old. When we asked her who was she talking to she would say</b>
<br><b>The man. When we showed her the picture of her uncle Steve and she
said thetas him. I will send more stories of this house because we had
plenty</b><b></b>

<p><b>About five years ago my dad's brother, Chris died in a tragic motor
vehicle accident. In the same accident, my sister-in-laws parents also
passed away leaving behind their youngest son, an older sister and my sister-in-law.&nbsp;
A few months after the accident, the youngest son (11 yrs old) was playing
with a toy cellphone (the kind which plays music when the buttons are pressed).&nbsp;
He was sitting at the table with his sister &amp; her boyfriend.&nbsp;
They noticed that he was talking on the cellphone &amp; thought that he
was just messing around, until they realised that he was having an actual
conversation with someone.&nbsp; They heard him say, "I'm okay mummy..."&nbsp;
Spooked, they sat there in silence and listened.&nbsp; They then heard
a voice (if you sit close to someone on a cellphone, you sometimes hear
the person on the other end of the line speaking).&nbsp; The sister heard
the voice and looked at her boyfriend to see if he could hear it too &amp;
judging by the way he looked, she knew he could hear the same voice.&nbsp;
She later confirmed that it was her mother's voice and from what they heard,
it sounded like her mother was letting her son know where they are and
that they were okay.&nbsp; They heard her brother saying, "it's not clear,
i can't hear you anymore" and then it was over.&nbsp; The whole conversation
lasted around 30 seconds.&nbsp; They asked him who he'd been speaking to
and he didn't recall anything of that conversation.</b>
<br><b>Since that same accident, my second brother had a daughter.&nbsp;
She never knew my Uncle Chris, we just showed her photos of him and told
her who he was.&nbsp; My brother was on his way home one night.&nbsp; In
the car, was my aunt (uncle chris' wife), my brother's wife and my niece
(who was 2 yrs old at the time).&nbsp; It was quite late and there weren't
many people around.&nbsp; As they were driving off from a gas station,
they u-turned next to the shop by the gas station, the shop was closed.&nbsp;
As they turned, my niece stood on the seat to look out the back window
of the car and waved to someone, saying: "Bye.".&nbsp; As she waved, they
all looked back and there was absolutely no one there, but she continued
to wave and say bye.&nbsp; They were all a bit hesitant to ask but eventually
her mother asked who she was saying bye to.&nbsp; She said it was Uncle
Chris.&nbsp; Remember, she never met him, she just saw photos.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Grandmother's House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sierraskyesmom@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I live in Memphis, TN and my grandmother has lived in the same house
since before I was born. Supposedly it's built on an old Indian graveyard,
but I've never verified it so I don't really put too much emphasis on that.
Her house has always given my sister, cousin, and I the total creeps. We
always feel a presence when we are there. It's not cold, but its that feeling
of someone watching you when youre alone. When I was about 9 my best friend
Stephanie and I were spending the night there. My grandmother has a grandfather
clock that chimes for every hour. (Like 9:00, 9 chimes) Anyways, we had
gone to bed around 10:30. Well, at 12:00 midnight we woke up to the clock
chiming and we heard moaning. We both got up to see what was wrong. There
were little lights (now I know them as orbs, thanks to your site) and they
were dancing up by the face of the clock....like some drunk was holding
a flashlight or something. But my grandmother was FAST asleep, snoring
like a chainsaw. My friend and I ran back to the bedroom and hid under
the covers.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Also, when my parents seperated, my mother went to live there
with my grandmother. She would see indentions on the bed beside her, and
one time when she was feeling really sad the room filled with the scent
of roses. Now, my grandmother is a chainsmoker, so you can just walk in
her house and catch a nicotine buzz. It is not a smell-good place. My Uncle,
who is Catholic, said it was Mother Mary. Anyways, to this day I will not
go in certain rooms by myself - mainly the bathroom and the attic. (Something
paces the attic at night....like a man with work boots on or something)
It's not a mean spirit&nbsp; it just freaks me out.</b>

<p><b>I felt SOOO stupid!!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dvitali@att.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hey all new here but love this place...........</b>
<br><b>Here's my story.....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was in my grandma's house
one winter, when I was about 5 or 6. I was laying in bed and woke up around
2:30 am. I felt "something" pull off the comforter and lay it on the ground
next to the bed. I freaked!!!! went into grandma's room and very excitedly
blabbed that something is in my room and pulled off the comforter. My granddad
being not one to have strangers in his house took his pistol and went to
search for who or what. Well he didn't find a thing. That scared me even
more. the next two weeks this happened and everytime it started I would
pull the "magic covers" over my head. Well&nbsp; my grand dad says to me
"I will get the thing and take care of it" That made me feel good that
at least somebody believes me. Well the next night grand dad was in the
chair next to the bed and was waiting for the thing. Then it started, sliding
slow the faster to the floor I pulled the covers up and granddad got up
to investigate. he pulled the covers off my head and looked at me and started
laughing and falling back into the chair. I was freakin again thinking
the "bogeyman got to grandpa. and I must have looked a sight too. he turned
on the light and sat down. he asked about what was happening and when it
happened, he REALLY took the time to comfort and help me. He said lets
perform and experiment.</b>
<br><b>I laid down and he pull the comforter back on me and said move around
alittle, I did. the comforter started to slide, I let out a yelp and grandpa
started laughing again. Seem the comforter was satin and grandma washed
it a few times and the stuffing had fallen heavier at the seams than the
middle and since the weight wasn't even it started to slide down gaining
momentum until it fell off.</b>
<br><b>It wasn't a ghost just a wild imagination. I was so embarrassed
and felt very stupid. My Grandpa said we could keep it a secret between
us and let it go at that. I repeated the experiment several times when
I was alone all with the same results. We kept the "secret" until I was
18 and I told it at my batchler party. Granddad embellished it a "LOT"
but he never said I was scared just concerned.</b>
<br><b>It's nice to have somebody who loves you as much as he did and after
he died ,several years later, on the same night.</b>
<br><b>The comforter was pulled off my bed and I heard laughter from the
front yard, I looked out the window and next to a bush in the front yard
I saw a shadow waving at me and just fade away. I love my grandpa and I
guess he wanted to make sure I was ok.</b>
<br><b>weird huh?</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ginger</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Th3DImaxOfMyMind@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I had lived in my house for all my life (well, that was about 12
years... and now I've moved). It wasn't a new house, but it wasn't incredibly
old either. In fact, it'll be 100 in 2007. It never had any ghosts or hauntings,
despite my wish. I'm pretty sure it didn't have any secret passages (another
thing I wished desperately), though I still today am not sure about the
funky spot on my bedroom wall (but that's another story). I had a pet dog,
Ginger. She my solace. My great-grandmother had found her one day, in the
metroparks, leaning against the car wheel. Apparently she had been abandoned.
My grandmother has a very large heart and took her home. somehow my mom
and dad took the puppy. Even though she was a dog, we were very close.
In her world, I was second to only my dad. She lived quite a long life.
We assumed her to be my age, though she might have had a year or two more.
That would have made her about 13 when she died. October 19, 2000. I remember
that day well. I came home from school to find my mother weeping. She told
me that Ginger had died. I never got to say good-bye to her. My world collapsed
it seemed. I had taken for granted how much I expected her to be waiting
for me. How much I waited for her to make the rounds at night, coming into
my bedroom and sniffing my bed to make sure I was still there. She was
gone.</b>
<br><b>We moved on January 7, 2001, so It had to be in December. I was
somewhat accepting of her death. I no longer expected her to come in. She
was no longer on my mind every minute of the day. My heart was mending.
I was in the kitchen, helping my mother make dinner when I heard Ginger
coming down the stairs. Unthinking, I went to greet her. When I got to
the bottom of the stairs, nothing was there, and I remembered then that
she had died.</b>
<br><b>At first, I was positive I had heard her ghost. That it was her
ghost or spirit or whatever. Even though she had been dead for some months
without so much as a sound. It could be. But we moved rather soon after
that, so I never had the chance to see if she was haunting our house. Even
if it was just my imagination, It gives me heart to think that, even if
it was for that one moment, she had come back to say good-bye.</b>

<p><b>By: cyndicarnaggio@richlandonline.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;WHEN I WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD WE MOVED INTO A HOUSE IN A SMALL
MILL VILLAGE.</b>
<br><b>THE HOUSE WAS 90 YEARS OLD AND IT WAS SO CUTE AND CHARMING OR SO
IT SEEMED.</b>
<br><b>THE FIRST NIGHT WE WENT TO LOOK AT THIS HOUSE, I REMEMBER BEING
SCARED TO</b>
<br><b>DEATH. THE PEOPLE WHO OWNED THE HOUSE HAD ONLY BEEN THERE FOR ABOUT
8</b>
<br><b>MONTHS. WHEN MY DAD INQUIRED AS TO WHY AFTER SUCH A SHORT TIME THEY
WANTED</b>
<br><b>TO SELL THIS BEAUTIFUL HOME. THE CLAIMED THAT THEY WANTED TO MOVE
CLOSER TO</b>
<br><b>FAMILY. AT THE TIME WE LOOKED AT IT THEY WERE NOT EVEN STAYING THERE
BUT WE</b>
<br><b>MET THEM THERE TO LOOK AT THE HOUSE. I REALIZE NOW THAT MY PARENTS
SHOULD</b>
<br><b>HAVE SUSPECTED SOMETHING WAS NOT RIGHT. IF I TOLD YOU EVERYTHING
THAT</b>
<br><b>HAPPENED THERE I WOULD BE WRITING ALL DAY, SO I WILL JUST GIVE A
FEW</b>
<br><b>EXAMPLES AND IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN MORE I WILL BE HAPPY TO WRITE
AGAIN.</b>
<br><b>THE SECOND NIGHT WE WERE IN THE HOUSE I WOKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
NIGHT AND</b>
<br><b>THERE WAS AN OLD MAN STANDING IN THE DOORWAY OF MY BEDROOM. HE WAS
DRESSED</b>
<br><b>IN JEANS AND A RED FLANNEL SHIRT AND BOOTS. I SAT UP AND I THOUGHT
I WAS</b>
<br><b>DREAMING. BUT HE MOTIONED FOR ME TO FOLLOW HIM. NEEDLESS TO SAY
I SCREAMED</b>
<br><b>FOR MY DAD AND WHEN HE GOT TO MY ROOM THERE WAS NOTHING THERE. THIS
SMALL</b>
<br><b>COMMUNITY WE LIVED IN IS IN CLIFTON SOUTH CAROLINA, WHICH IS 4 MILES
FROM</b>
<br><b>THE BATTLE GROUND AT COWPENS, WHERE A BLOODY SKIRMISH BETWEEN THE
UNION AND</b>
<br><b>CONFEDERATE ARMIES WAS FOUGHT. AFTER THAT FIRST SIGHTING I SAW THE
MAN FOR</b>
<br><b>MANY YEARS AND HE ALWAYS TRIED TO GET ME TO FOLLOW HIM. MANY DIFFERENT</b>
<br><b>THINGS HAPPENED TO MY ENTIRE FAMILY HERE. MY BROTHER WAS ABOUT 5
AT THE TIME</b>
<br><b>AND WE WOULD WAKE UP AT NIGHT AND WE WOULD FIND HIM IN THE ATTIC
PLAYING</b>
<br><b>WITH HIS NEW FRIENDS. NOW OUR ATTIC HAD A DROP LADDER AND MY BROTHER
WAS NOT</b>
<br><b>TALL ENOUGH TO REACH THE ROPE. THERE WAS NEVER A CHAIR OR ANYTHING
HE COULD</b>
<br><b>HAVE STOOD ON TO REACH. IN MY BROTHERS ROOM THERE WAS A SECRET PASSAGE
BUILT</b>
<br><b>INTO HIS CLOSET AND HE WOULD SIT IN THIS PASSAGE WAY AT ALL HOURS
AND PLAY</b>
<br><b>WITH TOMMY HIS FRIEND. HE DID REALLY STRANGE THINGS AND WHEN HE
WAS PLAYING</b>
<br><b>WITH TOMMY IT WAS LIKE HE WAS IN A TRANCE AND COULD NOT SEE OR HEAR
US</b>
<br><b>TALKING TO HIM. NO FRIENDS OR COUSINS STAYED OVER MORE THAN ONE
NIGHT</b>
<br><b>BECAUSE OF NOISES AND SEEING THINGS. THE BASEMENT WAS AN ESPECIALLY
SCARY</b>
<br><b>PLACE. MY DAD WAS DOWN THERE WORKING ON A TABLE SAW BUILDING US
A PLAY HOUSE</b>
<br><b>AND SOMETHING HELD HIS HAND DOWN AND THE SAW CUT OFF HIS FINGER.
AFTER THAT</b>
<br><b>DAY WE CHILDREN WERE NOT ALLOWED IN THE BASEMENT FOR ANY REASON.
WHICH WAS</b>
<br><b>NOT A PROBLEM AS WE WERE TERRIFIED. MY LITTLE SISTER BEGAN TO WET
THE BED</b>
<br><b>BECAUSE SHE WAS TOO SCARED TO GET UP AND GO TO THE BATHROOM AT NIGHT
BECAUSE</b>
<br><b>YOU COULD COUNT ON MEETING SOMEONE IN THE HALLWAY. IT WAS A DAILY</b>
<br><b>OCCURANCE.MY MOM WOULD WAKE AT NIGHT SCREAMING THAT LITTLE BLACK
IMPS WERE</b>
<br><b>ALL OVER HER AND THEY WERE TRYING TO STAB HER WITH SMALL SPEARS.
NOW MANY</b>
<br><b>PEOPLE WOULD SAY SHE WAS CRAZY, BUT I KNOW WHAT SHE SAW WAS REAL.
THINGS</b>
<br><b>STARTED TO ESCALATE ONE SUMMER WHEN I WAS ABOUT 9 YEARS OLD. MY
FAMILY AND I</b>
<br><b>WENT TO THE BEACH FOR A WEEK AND MY AUNT DECIDED SHE WAS NOT SCARED
TO STAY</b>
<br><b>ALONE AND HOUSE SIT. ON THE FIRST NIGHT THERE WAS NO ACTIVITY AND
I AM SURE</b>
<br><b>SHE WAS BEGINNING TO THINK WE HAD ALL TAKEN LEAVE OF OUR SENSES.
BUT ON THE</b>
<br><b>SECOND NIGHT SHE WAS IN THE DEN AND ALL OF THE HOUSE DOORS WERE
LOCKED. SHE</b>
<br><b>REMEMBERED HEARING SOMETHING IN THE BASEMENT THAT SOUNDED LIKE A
FREIGHT</b>
<br><b>TRAIN AND THEN A BLOW TO THE BACK OF HER HEAD AND THEN NOTHING.
ON THIS</b>
<br><b>NIGHT MY GRANDPARENTS CAME OVER TO CHECK ON HER AND AFTER SEEING
HER ON THE</b>
<br><b>FLOOR THROUGH THE WINDOW THEY CALLED THE POLICE BECAUSE THEY DID
NOT HAVE A</b>
<br><b>KEY AND THE HOUSE WAS LOCKED UP TIGHT. WHEN THE POLICE AND AN AMBULANCE
GOT</b>
<br><b>THERE THE POLICE HAD TO BREAK INTO THE HOUSE. UPON ENTERING THEY
FOUND MY</b>
<br><b>AUNT UNCONSCIOUS WITH A NASTY GASH ON THE HEAD AND ABSOLUTELY NO
WAY ANYONE</b>
<br><b>COULD HAVE GOTTEN IN. THERE WAS NO FORCED ENTRY AND ALL DOORS AND
WINDOWS</b>
<br><b>WERE LOCKED. MY AUNT NEVER ONCE STEPPED THROUGH THE DOOR OF OUR
HOUSE EVER</b>
<br><b>AGAIN. AFTER A FEW MORE YEARS AND A TERRIBLE ESCALATION OF VIOLENT</b>
<br><b>OCCURRENCES MY PARENTS DIVORCED AND MY MOM AND US KIDS MOVED TO
A DIFFERENT</b>
<br><b>LOCATION. I WAS SO HAPPY. MY DAD TURNED THE HOUSE INTO A BACHELOR
PAD AND</b>
<br><b>TWO OF HIS FRIENDS MOVED IN. ONE GUY (RICK) STAYED FOR 1 WEEK AND
LEFT AND</b>
<br><b>REFUSED TO TALK ABOUT IT. MY DADS FRIEND LARRY SAID SOMEONE KEPT
GETTING IN</b>
<br><b>BED WITH HIM AND SAYING HIS NAME. AFTER A FEW MORE MONTHS THEY BOTH
LEFT THE</b>
<br><b>HOUSE AND IT STOOD EMPTY FOR ABOUT A YEAR. THEN MY UNCLE FROM OUT
OF STATE</b>
<br><b>MOVED BACK HOME WITH HIS FAMILY AND WANTED TO RENT THE PLACE BECAUSE
IT IS A</b>
<br><b>BEAUTIFUL HOME AND HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE PARANORMAL. THEY MOVED
IN ON A</b>
<br><b>SATURDAY EVENING AND THE NEXT DAY THEY LEFT AND NEVER WENT BACK.
MY DAY HAD</b>
<br><b>TO LOAD ALL OF THEIR STUFF AND TAKE IT TO THEM THEY WOULD NOT EVEN
GO BACK</b>
<br><b>IN FOR THAT. THE HOUSE SAT EMPTY FOR ABOUT 6 YEARS AND THEN I GOT
MARRIED MY</b>
<br><b>DAY TOLD MY HUSBAND ABOUT THE HOUSE AND MY HUSBAND DID NOT BELIEVE
EITHER.</b>
<br><b>MY DAY GAVE US THIS BEAUTIFUL HOUSE AND MY HUSBAND COULD NOT WAIT
TO MOVE</b>
<br><b>IN. I CRIED IN TERROR THINKING ABOUT IT. ON OUR WEDDING DAY MY NEW
HUSBAND</b>
<br><b>WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT IN OUR NEW HOME. I TRIED TO TALK HIM OUT
OF IT BUT</b>
<br><b>HE CONVINCED ME THAT NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN TO ME THERE. BY THIS TIME
MY MAMA</b>
<br><b>HAD DIED. THAT DAY WHEN WE WENT INTO THE HOUSE IT WAS THE FIRST
TIME I HAD</b>
<br><b>SET FOOT THROUGH THAT DOOR IN MANY YEARS. BUT AS SOON AS I WENT
IN THE</b>
<br><b>FEELING OF TERROR I EXPERIENCED WAS SO OPPRESSIVE I COULD NOT CATCH
MY</b>
<br><b>BREATH. I CRIED LIKE A BABY AND BEGGED JOEY FOR US TO LEAVE BUT
HE REALLY</b>
<br><b>DID NOT BELIEVE, HE HUGGED ME AND SWORE HE WOULD NEVER LET ANYTHING
HAPPEN</b>
<br><b>TO ME. EACH ROOM I WENT INTO BROUGHT DIFFERENT TYPES OF TERROR IN
ME AND I</b>
<br><b>KNEW I WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO LIVE HERE AGAIN. THE ELECTRICITY WAS
NOT</b>
<br><b>CONNECTED SO THAT EVENING WE STAYED IN THE LIVING ROOM WHICH IS
THE ROOM</b>
<br><b>WHERE I EXPERIENCED LESS TERROR THAN ALL THE OTHER ROOMS IN THE
HOUSE. I HAD</b>
<br><b>FALLEN ASLEEP IN MY HUSBANDS ARMS TO CANDLELIGHT AND AT ABOUT 3:00
AM MY</b>
<br><b>HUSBAND GRABBED ME UP AND TOLD ME TO GET DRESSED THAT WE WERE GOING
TO A</b>
<br><b>HOTEL. I HAVE TO BE HONEST I HAD SEEN NOTHING THAT NIGHT AND HAD
STARTED TO</b>
<br><b>WONDER IF EVERYTHING WAS GOING TO BE OKAY, BUT WHEN I SAW THE LOOK
ON HIS</b>
<br><b>FACE I KNEW HE HAD SEEN SOMETHING THAT SHOOK HIM TO THE CORE OF
HIS BEING.</b>
<br><b>HE WAS TERRIFIED, WE HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR 24 YEARS AND TO THIS
DAY HE WILL</b>
<br><b>TELL NO ONE WHAT HE SAW. HE REFUSES TO TALK ABOUT IT AT ALL. NEEDLESS
TO SAY</b>
<br><b>HE TOLD MY DADDY THANKS BUT NO THANKS. THAT HOUSE HAS BEEN RENTED
OUT BY MY</b>
<br><b>DAD TO 10 DIFFERENT FAMILIES NONE OF WHOM STAYED BEYOND 6 MONTHS.
THIS IS</b>
<br><b>THE HONEST TRUTH AND CAN BE CORROBORATED BY MANY, MANY PEOPLE. I
LIVE IN</b>
<br><b>COLUMBIA S.C NOW BUT A FEW YEARS AGO MY HUSBAND AND CHILDREN ALONG
WITH MY</b>
<br><b>SISTER AND HER FAMILY RODE BY THE HOUSE IN CLIFTON AND IT IS STILL
OWNED BY</b>
<br><b>MY FAMILY AND IT IS STILL BEAUTIFUL AND IT IS STILL TERRIFYING.
IT STANDS</b>
<br><b>EMPTY NOW AND HAS BEEN FOR YEARS. I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE WILL EVER
MOVE IN</b>
<br><b>AGAIN BUT I DO THAT KNOW THEY WONT STAY.</b>

<p><b>What I experienced in a Federal Prison</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: elliotth@sbcglobal.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have been a correctional officer for 20 years.&nbsp; (recently
retired)&nbsp; I cant give names or places because the government is very
conservative and the Bureau of Prisons is super touchy about negative PR.</b>
<br><b>To begin with I think EVERY older joint in the Bureau has its share
of Ghost stories, from the "Gray Man" in tower VI in Leavenworth to&nbsp;
"Johnny Walker" in Springfiedl Medical Facility.&nbsp; My FCI (Federal
Correctional Institute was no acception.&nbsp; Our hauntings or as we referred
to them "Weird Forking feces"&nbsp; centered around Dorm I and the Prison
Chapel.&nbsp; Unit one had two inmates kill themselves in a suicide pact
in the fifties, the inmates have been seen by staff on the midnight to
eight shift walking through the unit and into a shower stall where they
disappear.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the building was abandoned you could
walk by their at night and hear boots and equipment jangling.&nbsp; One
night four of us heard a voice yell 'STAND FOR COUNT".</b>
<br><b>BUT THE REAL STORY is our Prison chapel.&nbsp; About 1974 an officer
who was about to retire took some overtime it was his last assignment before
retirement.&nbsp; The Nation of Islam Inmates nocked him down and decapitated
him.&nbsp; (they had nothing against him he was just the wrong man in the
right place at the wrong time)&nbsp; For thirty years the chapel has been
in the center of odd happenings.&nbsp; Lights go on and off, Doors that
are locked (heavy duty prison locks) are unlocked.&nbsp; Toilets flush
and inside doors open on their own.</b>
<br><b>Footsteps and equipment rattles.&nbsp; In my 20 years service we
have had one sighting.&nbsp; A young officer went over to the chapel after
hours to shake down in prison slang it means to search for homemade intoxicants,
weapons, drugs etc.&nbsp; Officer "S" saw another staff member walking
up and down between the pews - Officer "S" identified him later as the
murfered officer.</b>
<br><b>The evening where my story really begins was in the summer of 2000
it was a hot humid night, (The kind of heat Kipling would say "Make yer
bloody eyebrows crawl"!) The institution was experiencing a lot of demolishing
of the old units so the inside was fenced off like a rats maze.&nbsp; At
9:30 pm the Officer in Tower I called the control center and said "There's
someone in the chapel"!&nbsp; He was told to knock off the crap.&nbsp;
He replied "This is for real there is movement in the chapel.&nbsp; At
that point the shift Lt ordered a special count at 10:00pm we had good
count all inmates were accounted for.&nbsp; Both Twr I and II reported
movement in the chapel and lights going on and off.&nbsp; The mobile patrols
were called to the front of the institution and set up a perimenter, bullet
proof vests on and assault rifles out. At about 10:20 myself , the shift
Lt and several other officers entered the chapel with Mace and riot batons.&nbsp;
We found nothing, just an emtpy building with locked offices.&nbsp; At
about 10:25 with two staff in the office section of the chapel&nbsp; the
rest of us (about five) entered the chapel proper.&nbsp; We checked the
area and entered a walk in storage area of about fifteen feet square. bsp;
A steel music stand rose up on its own turned in the air and drove into
the wall close to the Lt's head.&nbsp; We ran out of the storage room and
hit the main chapel doors.&nbsp; Five grown men - Five grown tough men
could not open the double doors.&nbsp; We would push on them they would
open maybe an inch and slam shut.&nbsp; The doors finally opened and we
spilled out into the vestibule.&nbsp; EVERY door Every Locked door began
opening and closing in unison one officer was thrown against the wall by
assailants&nbsp; unkown.&nbsp; The woman officer started screaming "Someone
is touching me"!&nbsp; I ran to help her and assailent unkown shoved me
down the hall into a wall.&nbsp; I ran back to assist the Officer she was
screaming "Something is touching me"!&nbsp; she was swatting at the air
like a person being pursued by hornets. I grabbed her and we couldnt move.&nbsp;
The other staff formed a chain the last man on the chain locked hands with
me and began dragging us out.&nbsp; As we started to leave the woman officer
was tripped by assailants unkown.&nbsp; Six grown adult men, ex police,
soldiers, long experience in Corrections watched has an assailant unknow
dragged the woman officer back into the chapel.&nbsp; (Yes her leg was
up in the air as someone was holding her ankle and dragging.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I dove for her and grabbed her wrist (yes I could feel the pressure and
myself moving)&nbsp; I told her&nbsp; "Deborah I love you with all my heart.&nbsp;
You are my beloved little sister I am not leaving you.&nbsp; If we get
dragged to Hell then I am coming too!&nbsp; I love you Deborah Harrison
with all my heart and I am so flattered you have a crush on me"!&nbsp;
the tugging stopped and we left the chapel.</b>
<br><b>We were checked out by the prison PA One officer had two stitches
in his head from hitting the wall.&nbsp; Another had a banged up knee from
being tripped.&nbsp; I had a hand print on my chest (A red splotch with
the thumb and two fingers identifable.)&nbsp; Officer Harrison had a angry
red splotch around her ankle where she had been grabbed.</b>
<br><b>It was all over but the paper work.&nbsp; We all wrote memos and
we were all considered either crazy or the biggest lairs on the planet.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I am a Vietnam Veteran and served in the South Afrikan Army as a teenager
i worked in funeral home.&nbsp; I am not morbid or prone to believing every
shadow is the boogie man coming for me!&nbsp; My attitude was "Dead is
Dead"&nbsp; if you are in Heaven you dont wanna come back if you are in
Hell you cant come back"!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not going to say we were
atttacked by ghosts or poltergiest or whatever but I freely admit that
I experienced something that could not be explained by ordinary means.</b>

<br><b>The Light</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mbreylds@chorus.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>One night, my mom was home alone except my brother,but he was sleeping,and
all of a sudden, she saw a light coming from the room that is mine(I was
at my dads at the time). It wasn't bright enough to be the room light,
and I didn't have a lamp or anything like that.Also the room was a bit
chilly.She was so scared that she called her mom, which is my grandma.
Another story is that one time I had a Friend over at my house,and we were
dancing and listening to music,and than we heard a grunt, it sounded a
bit like the word help. It wasn't our imagination, because we heard it
at the same time, and it wasn't anyone else, because my mom was in the
living room and my step and my brother was on a four- wheeler ride. Ever
since, I have heard a door slam, usually at midnight.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Shady GRove Cemetery-Sale City, GA</b><b></b>
<p><b>By;&nbsp; JeNnYFuR</b><b></b>
<p><b>I live a few miles from Shady Grove. My fiance and I have been there
3 times and took another couple along with us. It knows when you are coming.
The first night, when my fiance and the other couple were coming, they
nearly got into a wreck. Sounds coincidental, but let me finish. I also
nearly got into a bad wreck going to meet them so they could follow me
to my house. Again, in my car, we nearly flipped going around the first
curve. I was not driving too fast, as that road is curvy and narrow. We
parked in front of the site, so we could clearly see the chapel. When you
are quiet and still, not only does the temperature drop, but it seems to
get darker. (we went there during the summer of last year, so it wasnt
due to weather conditions) Like I said, the temperature dropped and became
chilly on an otherwise muggy night. We got out of the car and went up to
the chapel. We acually went into the chapel and my fiance lit his windproof
lighter so we could see. It faded out. There was no breeze, no nothing.
That happened each of the 3 times we went in there. We have heard the moans
and screams. We have felt cold spots and cold hands. We've seen lights
inside that chapel from no natural cause. (its very dark out there) We
went to the right side of the cemetery (that's if you are facing the chapel)
and my friend stood near a tall stone monument and put his hand on it,
not forcing any weight onto it. After he took his hand off of it was was
standing near it and saying something it collapsed. Had he not been so
quick moving, it would have crusshed him. We left after that. Knowing which
way to go, we got lost. Also, when we left, there was fog in places where
there shouldnt have been fog.</b>
<br><b>Having gone there before with another person, i HAVE SEEN what appeared
to be a little girl in a white dress with blonde/white hair. I know i seen
it.</b>
<br><b>After we got back to my house, and our friends left, my fiance said
he had seen the same thing. I had never said a word about what i had seen
to him before, and he got freaked out when i told him i had seen the same
thing on a previous visit. Two of us seen a pair of red eyes in the same
spot, but from different angles.</b>
<br><b>The second time that we all went to Shady Grove, again, we nearly
had a wreck (driving carefully, still not a coincidence). The temperature
dropped again, and it got darker and darker. We heard more groans and screams.
We heard one that would make you need to change pants. It sounded like
a man being tortured by Satan himself. Again, we went inside the chapel
and the windproof lighter faded out. My flashlight also would not work.
It had new batteries and worked fine before we left. Walking through the
cemetery there definitely was a sense of dread. Also, my fiance seen something
behind a grave stone. We chose not to stay as long as the first time we
went out there. When we got back to my house, my friend's girlfriend asked
us if she would sound crazy if she told us that she seen something. We
told her no and she described the same little girl that my fiance and i
have both seen. No one had told her what the little girl looked like before
she said it. On the way back home, our friends nearly got into a wreck.
The third time, we decided to go back, we stayed only ten minutes. We went
to apologize to anyone living or dead that we had upset. Apparently, we
had upset someone on our visit, because we were told "GET OUT!" Belive
me, we got out.</b>
<br><b>I know some of it sounds far-fetched, but it is the truth. Had it
not been, i wouldnt have wasted my time typing this email. I hope the information
I have contributed from my experience is helpful to someone in the future.</b>

<br><b>Our Haunted Home</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:crystald@shaw.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, I came across your webpage and have enjoyed reading the stories
submitted by people.&nbsp; I have one of my own.&nbsp; When I was 14 yrs
old my family and I moved into this old house which was was also attached
to a repair shop and mini mall of sorts.&nbsp; We learned that this house
was also a boarding house in the 30's or 40's.&nbsp; When we moved in strange
things would happen, we'd hear children playing in the foyer or they would
be heard laughing and running up the stairs, I've heard them when I knew
all my younger siblings were not in the house.&nbsp; The house was of course
older and had a basement, a main floor and a second floor.&nbsp; We lived
there for nine years and my mother moved out when I was 23.&nbsp; Many
nights I felt I was attacked in the middle of the night, like there was
a force holding me down.&nbsp; I couldn't move or speak but I was afraid
and would fight to move and sometimes make some movement.&nbsp; It may
sound silly but I felt like something was trying to force me out of my
body.&nbsp; This happened for many years until I was about 20 yrs old,
in no matter which room I may have been sleeping in, it would happen.&nbsp;
When my younger sister was around 14 it happened to her, but only once
as she recalled.&nbsp; She remembers waking up one night with a weird sensation.&nbsp;
It also felt like someone was holding her down. Our dog who was sleeping
in her room went berserk and the feeling went away, she felt exhausted
and fell back asleep. ( exactly what would happen to me).&nbsp; But in
her case she woke up with finger-like bruises on her upper arms. SCARY!&nbsp;
My grandfather who was still alive and living with us had Parkinson's disease
and would be awake in his room most nights, he would see an elderly woman
moving from room to room and peek in, almost to make sure we were okay
I guess. One night my mother woke up because she felt a presense in her
room, she woke up to find a ghostly image of an elderly woman leaning into
to my brother's crib, the apparition then straightened up and left the
room.&nbsp; When my mother asked my grandfather what it may have been,
he told her not to bother with her and that she always makes her rounds
at night, she was a good spirit. I still to this day do not know how many
spirits were in that house, but there was one that looked like an Indian
man who would walk from the back door to the front door, he would be dark,
almost black in appearance and would scare the crap out of anyone who would
see him.&nbsp; The basement was where my two younger brothers had their
room.&nbsp; It always exuded a scary feeling and no one would want to go
down there alone...ever.&nbsp; I don't know how they were ever able to
live down there for so long.&nbsp; Unseen forces would lift their beds
off the floor and drop them while they were sleeping in them, if they unscrewed
the lightbulbs (because they were too scared and lazy to go up the stairs
to turn off the lights at night) they would screw back in. Whatever lived
down there with them hated it because the bulbs would be screwed back in
so tight it was hard to change them.&nbsp; I had a baby when I was young
and still lived at home, one day my youngest brother, who was two years
older than my son and jealous of the attention he got, pushed him down
the basement steps.&nbsp; He was in a walker that had wheels and Devon
was about 5 or 6 months old. I heard him scream (Devon) and tumble down
the stairs (the steps had a landing and then the steps continued on to
the right)&nbsp; When I got to the basement stairs I found that Devon was
holding onto the last step at an angle, he still was in his walker and
was dangling, if he fell he would have hit the concrete below. (Every mother's
nightmare) The walker fell to the concrete with a horrific crash as soon
as I grabbed hold of him.&nbsp; What I found to be unbelievable was that
Devon was only 5 or 6 months old and was not strong enough to hold up himself
and the walker.&nbsp; I believe that someone or something was holding him
in place until I got there. Could it be possible?&nbsp; After living in
that house of horrors, I believe it.</b><b></b>

<p><b>By: natasha_allen1@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Ok this is a true story, It happened to myself and 3 friends when
we went for an over night camp on my friend Elle's property.</b>
<br><b>We pitched our tent about 3 paddocks away from the house, we were
on the river bank. It was about twelve o'clock at night, and as 13 year
old girls do, we were up chatting away. Then all of a sudden My friends
little brothers (who were also camping down near the river) came running
over saying that they were scared and they wanted to go up to the house.
When we asked what was wrong the boys told us that they could hear voices
down at the river.</b>
<br><b>None of us belived them but we decided to walk them up to the house
anyway. On our way up, there was an old abandon cottage that my friends
family used as a shed, we had to walk directly past it and being only 11
years old the two boys were really scared of it. so us girls said we would
walk on the side that the shed was.</b>
<br><b>AS we walked past there was a series of BANGS and a lot of rattling,
like some one was throwing things around, it was coming from the shed.
We all started running towards the house and then like some one had fired
a gun into the trees all the birds flew out of the trees. By now we had
reached the house. We stayed there for over an hour until us girls felt
safe enough to go back to the tent.</b>
<br><b>As we made our way back nothing happened, everything was fine until
we were back inside the tent...</b>
<br><b>Inside we all sat quietly then the tent started to shake like the
wind was hitting it but there was no wind no a whisper of it. After it
finished we all sat still frozen in fear. then Jayme told me to do up the
front of the zip. as i moved to do it up (now this happened really fast)
we herd someone scream and a lot of stick crunching coming from the other
side of the river, then there was some kind of whispering only faint but
we could all hear it, it went on for about 10 seconds&nbsp; then it stoped.
We sat there for what seamed like hours but it must have been only a couple
of minutes then there was a sound like someone coming out from under the
water and taking a deep breath.</b>
<br><b>I remember being so scared, one of my friends was crying. then Elle
grabbed her mobile and started to ring her parents up at the house, the
phone didn't turn on it said low battery we all looked in disbelief at
the mobile phone, Elle had only just charged it before we came down to
camp.</b>
<br><b>So we diced we had to go up to the house i unzipped the tent and
one by one we got out. nothing. Thats what we saw only the fences surrounding
the paddock and the trees around it. We started walking to wards the house
when my friend stoped she had a panic attack she said she could see it
she pointed towards the old cottage/shed and the lights were turned on
inside, my friend Elle said&nbsp; in a whisper that the lights hadn't worked
for ages. all stood glued to the ground for i remember seeing a shadow
move across the window and a face as white as snow appear and just stare
at us for about 5 seconds. Ashley my other friend screamed she had seen
it too. we all ran to the house and none of us looked back.</b>
<br><b>We didn't sleep that night but in the morning we all decided that
we were tierd and we may have imagined it. but when we went back down with
Elle's parents to get our stuff we found the tent completely flattened
and our stuff piled a couple of metres away from the tent, the parents
who hadn't belived us when we told them about that night saw the looks
on faces when we saw the tent, started to belive us.</b>
<br><b>Elle's dad went looking inside the cottage that day to see if any
one had been there, he found it deserted. When he tried the lights, they
didn't work.--</b>

<br><b>&nbsp;My Aunt</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>This all started happening after my great aunt died.&nbsp; She was
very close to my sister and I and we saw her everyday.&nbsp; After being
diagnosed with lung cancer she was adminstered chemotherapy.&nbsp; Her
heart gave out because of it.&nbsp; Although I cannot remember being told
what was going on, at approximately nine o' clock I look out the window
and said "Please make Aunt Dana be alright."&nbsp; I distinctly remember
doing this because I was at my friend's house and she came looking for
me after a while.&nbsp; The next morning I was told she was dead.</b>
<br><b>We went through my aunt's house later to clean up.&nbsp; I kept
an old music box that plays "I'll Be Working on the Railroad" and had a
little bird in it that danced.</b>
<br><b>I was very easily scared as a child.&nbsp; One night I was crying
because I thought there was something in a corner looking at me, and the
music box started playing.&nbsp; I was quickly distracted and fell asleep.</b>
<br><b>This happened occasionally ever since that night.</b>
<br><b>Other times I will be sitting in class or writing on my computer
and I will smell a lilac scent.&nbsp; The little hairs on the back of my
neck rise and I can feel a hand going up the back of my shirt.&nbsp; Usually
I try to shrug it away, but many time it insists.&nbsp; These are the only
other times I feel such a presence</b><b></b>

<p><b>hi my name is michelle. i have wittnessed a haunting in my very own
home. it was about 2 ears ago, in a small house, in a place called livermore.
i was in the house with a friend, we were going to the living room and
suddenly the room was so cold that we could see our breath. of course,
we got scared and ran to my father. he said that it must be that the window
was open, but there is a catch...the window was closed. then, my friend
and went into the room again and it was about 90 degrees. we went to open
the window and ther was people staring in at us, about a dozen, covered
in blood some decapitated. they all were african american people, i totaly
freaked. by then my father had left us with the baby-sitter, so i tried
to call him from my phone in the room, i heared a voice on the other end.
it was a deep voice, definately from a male, and then he started breathing
harder and harder, eventually i hung up the phone. we left the house and
went to her home.</b>

<br><b>OH MY GOSH!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: nurselynnb@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My famliy has been plagued by unusual occurences for as many years
as I can remember. There are several of them that come to mind. When I
was 3 we moved into a house in Hutchinson KS. the first night there I remember
waking up and seeing a white floating mass in the room. I cried and my
mom came in and it was gone. I kept having dreams about being in the basement
of this house (it wasn't a scary basement ) i played in it all of the time
while my mom did laundry. I would dream that someone was calling my name
L-y-n-n and I would run for the basement door but it was like slow motion
something pulling me back. I had these dreams until we moved when I was
8. I later found out that a woman had killed her self by wrapping herself
in a mattress in the basement and setting it on fire several years before
we moved in.</b>
<br><b>Another experience occured when I moved to McPherson KS&nbsp; two
of&nbsp; my children then 4 and 5 years old were watching "Mya the Bee"
on tv when my daughter heard a noise, she turned and saw an off white figure
wearing a tattered dirty gown floating in the hallway looking into the
room where my husband was napping, she turned away in disbelief and when
she looked back it was gone, later that day she developed sores all over
her face that were gone the next day . My daughter is now 19 and&nbsp;
tells me&nbsp; "It looked like jesus",</b>
<br><b>Another incident&nbsp; occured just after i had&nbsp; gone to bed.
I had an early shift the next day so I went to bed before my husband,&nbsp;
all of a sudden I felt someone patting/stroking my hair, I jumped out of
bed and turned on the light thinking i would find my husband playing a
trick on me, but no-one was there... I went in to the living room where
my husband was watching TV i was really shook up, after he calmed me down
he said&nbsp; "oh man what day did your mom die on?" ( my mom had been
killed in a motor vehicle accident 11 years earlier to the day) i hadn't
realized what day it was . My husband thinks it was just my mom looking
after me.</b>
<br><b>The scarriest incident took place in a house we move in to about
1/2 a block from the hospital. my son who at the time was 16 was getting
ready to go to sleep in his room in the basement when he heard a noise
upstairs; he thought my husband was in the kitchen so he headed for the
stairway..&nbsp; when he got to the foot of the stairs and looked up he
saw a shadowy figure peek around the corner and peer down at him. He immediately
ran back to his room and got a baseball bat.The next thing he knew the
figure was at the bottom of the stairs then disapeared and reappeared at
his doorway, he jumped under his blankets with the bat hoping it would
go away. He then began to feel somthing stroking his hair so he jumped
out of bed running and screaming up stairs to me and my husband as paniced
as iv'e ever seen anyone. we looked down stairs and couldn't find anything.
Hes 18 now and has never deviated from his story.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Delivery Room</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: arabitacma@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is a strange experience I had about 6 years ago. You can put
it on your web site if you like. The night My Niece Grace was born I was
in bed and not yet asleep when I suddenly saw what I thought was an operating
room, It was sort of like looking through a tunnel that was turning around,
and around. I woke my husband up, and asked am I awake, and he said I think
so, you're talking to me. I told him what I saw and that I didn't think
it was anything bad because I sensed that the people were happy. Then the
last thing I said to him before I fell asleep was I wonder if my Sister
in Law is having her baby. About 6:30 in the morning our phone and at just
the time had the vision My sister in law was taken into the delivery room.
I think it was my brother's emotions I picked up on. He's a paramedic,
and as he has delivered babies before while in the course of his work the
doctor stood by just in case and let my brother deliver my niece. He was
so full of emotion I felt it all the way from Iowa to Buffalo, NY</b>

<br><b>The Voice</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:tokyojams@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, my name is Claire. I've been reading stories on your site for
quite a</b>
<br><b>while now. I finally decided that I would write in and tell you
about my</b>
<br><b>experience with a creature.</b>
<br><b>About four years ago, my mum &amp; myself moved into a townhouse.
For a period</b>
<br><b>of time, my room was located in the basement. After six months of
living in</b>
<br><b>this house, I was going down the stairs to the basement, &amp; I
heard someone</b>
<br><b>say to me in a womens voice, "Goodnight, Claire!". I was sort of
spooked,</b>
<br><b>because my mum was upstairs sleeping &amp; I would have heard her
come down the</b>
<br><b>stairs to the main floor to say goodnight to me. I told my friend
Stephanie</b>
<br><b>about this experience a few months later, and one night she spent
the night</b>
<br><b>at my house. We were going downstairs to watch television in my
room &amp; she</b>
<br><b>said to me, "Your mum is saying goodnight!" I said to her, "My mum
is</b>
<br><b>sleeping!" For the rest of the night, we talked about what it could
be &amp;</b>
<br><b>then never really gave it another thought.</b>
<br><b>I hadn't had any encounters with the womens voice since those nights,
a few</b>
<br><b>years back.&nbsp; But a few weeks ago, I was sleeping. (By this
time, I had moved</b>
<br><b>my room upstairs.) It was about three in the afternoon, (I sleep
late.) &amp; it</b>
<br><b>was raining outside. My window was open, and the wind was blowing
my bedroom</b>
<br><b>door open and then shut. I got up &amp; shut the window &amp; went
back to curl up</b>
<br><b>in my bed. This happened a lot when it was windy/rainy, so I didn't
give it</b>
<br><b>a thought. I was at the point where i was half awake and half asleep
&amp; the</b>
<br><b>door slammed shut (Remember, I shut my window!) and when it slammed
shut, I</b>
<br><b>heard someone yell, "CLAIRE!!!!". I woke up &amp; I thought my mum
had come</b>
<br><b>home, so I wasn't scared. I went downstairs to see her &amp; but
she wasn't</b>
<br><b>there. I looked out the window to see if her car was in the drive
way &amp; it</b>
<br><b>wasn't. This was my last encounter with the voice &amp; since then,
i've been</b>
<br><b>scared that the same thing will happen again. I don't know who or
what this</b>
<br><b>women wants from me, but I would like these visits to stop.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Most of the houses here in Texas are pretty old. Like some are 100's

My house is there is a little girl that occupies a the back bathroom and
back bedroom and in the livingroom things break glass explodes and lights
shut off. In the front bedrooms keeping slidding closet doors closed is
hard close them at night by morning time they are open and the kitchen
late night snacks are a no no because the refriguater will slam closed

<br><b>In Tune with the Supernatural</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: DownfallOfADream@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hauntings have been witnessed by not only my immediate family, but
my extended family as well for years.&nbsp; We'll start with my experiences.&nbsp;
I say this all casually now, because I'm so used to the occurances, and
for the record, many many of my friends have confirmed all of my experiences
upon their stays at my house.&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting with my room, you can
see faces in the cloth blinds, the radio in my room goes on and off as
it pleases, I hear people calling my name/knocking on my door constantly,
but enter the hallway to see absolutely nothing.&nbsp; You can hear huge
crowds of people/music/footsteps in the attic, and once in a while I'll
come home and the entire room will be in shambles... absolutely everything
out of place.&nbsp; I've had what many believe to be night terrors, only
I know I was wide awake.&nbsp; When I shared the smaller room with my sister,
the closet door would open and I'd see large bats and dragonfly type things
fly out and come right up in my face.. at which point my parents would
run in because I was screaming bloody murder. That went on for about a
month, and just recently started up again.&nbsp; I havent been able to
sleep without a light on in ages, because every time I do, the apparitions
return.&nbsp; In the bathroom, the mirror reflects the window, and you
can see a sickle looking thing in the reflection in the mirror, but not
on the window itself.&nbsp; Candles knock themselves over, pots and pans
tend to knock themselves around at all hours of the morning, you can see
faces in the reflections in the windows in my den, and there is always
a feeling that somebody is right behind you.&nbsp; Two things I remember
most vividly, specifics, are the following:&nbsp; Around the same time
the "night terrors" started, I was walking past what was my room at the
time, to see a tall figure walk wall to wall dressed all in black, big
hat, trench coat, and combat boots.&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought something had
fallen, so I checked, and nothing was out of place.&nbsp; My mom thought
I was kidding until just 2 weeks ago when she went into the attic only
to come running down in fright.&nbsp; I asked her what had happened, and
she said "Remember the person you claimed to have seen walking across your
old room years ago? He was standing over me breathing down my neck in the
attic." Another vivid memory was a recurring dream I had had.&nbsp; I dreampt
the same dream 3 times in one night, about 2 years ago.&nbsp; The dream
never returned, but what had happened in the dream was freaky enough.&nbsp;
In the dream there was a large caped figure with clawlike fingers, very
tall purple skin, but no face.&nbsp;&nbsp; The thing that was consistant
in all 3 dreams was the fact that he gently placed his hand on my cheek,
leaving me to wake up and feel tingly where the hand would have been..
only the 3rd time, I woke up and was bleeding in the 5 spots where his
fingers were putting pressure.&nbsp; No marks were left, but it was obviously
very strange.</b>
<br><b>As for my Uncle Mike's house, my cousins radio has turned on in
the middle of the night blasting so loud from 3 rooms away that the entire
house, even the ppl on the second floor, had woken up.&nbsp; We've heard
somebody walking around in the kitchen, cars go down the street and dont
come back (He lives 3 houses from the end of a dead end), and the banister
to the basement stairs even fell off one night!&nbsp; There were prior
accounts of TVs turning on and off, tall shadow figures hovering over beds,
things relocating themselves to other parts of the house, doors opening
and slamming, screaming coming from the back yard, and talking, seemingly
from right next to you.</b>
<br><b>My Aunt Theresa's house is home to many spirits as well. The night
that my father died, she was up and in the kitchen because she couldn't
sleep, reasonably so because her brother had just passed on.&nbsp; She
heard a voice call "mom!" and thought it was one of her 3 children.&nbsp;
Adgitated, as it was around 4 in the morning, she called upstairs and said
to her husband, "Joe, put the kids to bed!"&nbsp; My uncle Joe then called
down the stairs "What are you talking about, they're sound asleep!"&nbsp;
She passed it off as nothing until my uncle, sister, cousin, and 3 of my
other aunts had heard the same thing.&nbsp; It was later determined that
there was a Hotel built on her property, along with the properties of 4
of her neighbors.&nbsp; We came to the conclusion, since her neigbors son&nbsp;
had seen an old lady in his window, and my cousin had seen the little girl
walking around her house, that the girl was trying to find her mother and
grandmother in the hotel.&nbsp; The callings of "mom" soon stopped, but
the sound of footsteps, the front door opening, and random cold breezes
still remain.</b>
<br><b>I am a firm believer in ghosts and misguided/lost souls, and have
had too many things happen to me to pass them off as coincidence.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Grave Digger</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Batty_moo_maniac@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Im only 12 but Ive had lots of experiences with ghosts. The strangest
and most viewed one was late at night (around 3 o clock in the morning)
and it was my parents barbeque. We have it reguarly in the summer and we
had lots of my friends round. We were doing dares, and my best friend at
the time, Ellie, dared me to go into a garden with a wooden door at the
end of a small alley thing. I walked down, but it was so dark I wanted
company. When we got there I open the door and we all saw this man. He
was just digging over and over again. He didnt seem to notice us but I
get nervous being confronted and I started stuttering apologys. While I
was doing this I was looking away from him, as I thought he was just looking
at me. It wasnt untill I heard all my friends scream that I looked up and
saw just a head. an arm and a spade on their own digging. It was so scary
my parents had to ask them to put a bolt on the door incase the digging
guy came through.</b><b></b>

we could never</b>
<br><b>go to the floors above us at the time.&nbsp; They were renovating
the area for a</b>
<br><b>year.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was mostly at night that we would hear things
and while we would</b>
<br><b>get ready in the morning in the bathroom we would all ask one another
about</b>
<br><b>the of multiple people up stairs running around.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally
someone asked the</b>
<br><b>sercurity guard about the people up there at night and he looked
at her as</b>
<br><b>if she were making it up or crazy. He told her that no one was there
during</b>
<br><b>the night only a sercurity guard sometimes walking through.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; We told him we heard lots of people sometimes runnning,
and jumping, and</b>
<br><b>just being loud. He said he would check it out to see if it were
other</b>
<br><b>students tresspassing, but he never found anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then
there were other</b>
<br><b>things that just spooked us, soon we just lived with the noise and
never</b>
<br><b>mentioned it.&nbsp; TV's would turn off, and the incident that happened
to me was</b>
<br><b>in the bathroom.&nbsp; I was in a stall when the stall door next
to me slammed, I</b>
<br><b>yelled to ask if someone was there and even looked but no one was
there.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>happened more than once so I asked another girl to come in the bathroom
when</b>
<br><b>I had to go.&nbsp; I said it must be the door slamming when i close
my stall</b>
<br><b>door. (Eventhough it usually took place long after i gently cloaed
the door</b>
<br><b>and looked it)I figured perhaps the room was on an incline and when
my stall</b>
<br><b>door shut it moved the other since they were attached. so i slammed
my door</b>
<br><b>many times but the one next to me never moved not once.&nbsp; My
friend and i</b>
<br><b>decided to ignore it but I hated to go in there alone to take a
shower or go</b>
<br><b>to the bathroom.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe many parts of that campus have
spirits, you can ask the dean</b>
<br><b>he told someone he heard a party going on next to his office and
he thought</b>
<br><b>it was a group of students.&nbsp; He heard glasses and conversation,
but when he</b>
<br><b>went into the room it was empty.&nbsp; That was Wakehurst building
an old</b>
<br><b>mansion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Newport Rhode Island in my mind
is pretty haunted.</b>

It happened</b>
<br><b>one night at the office. (yes I have a normal job and life. Im

kept going</b>
<br><b>off.&nbsp; I could feel someone was there but couldnt see them.&nbsp;
One night after</b>
<br><b>working late, I was walking out and just happen to look left down
a row of</b>
<br><b>cubicles that were empty, there sitting in one of the chair was
a man.&nbsp; He</b>

<p><b>A Story of My Own</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Fifthsilver@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have been visiting your site for a long time now and I have had
several experiences with ghosts. So, I decided to share one with you.</b>
<br><b>My husband and I were still newly married and had just had our son
3 months before. For several months our telephone would ring at 11:15 every
night. We would answer but no one would be on the line. We would just hear
a dial tone. At the same time, my in-laws wanted us to travel to Mexico
to show off our son to his relatives. The first grandchild and great-grandchild
on his side. We felt that he was to young to travel so far.</b>
<br><b>One evening in June of 2000, we were sleeping when all of a sudden
the dog woke us up by barking very aggressively. He was staring at the
doorway and all of his fur was raised. I picked up the dog and walked to
the doorway to see what was there, but the closer I got to the doorway
the more the dog would fight me. He did NOT want to go near the door. So
I looked and saw nothing. I walked down the hall and saw nothing. My husband
was trying to calm our son, and the dog was still going into conniptions!</b>
<br><b>We laid the baby back down in the bassinet and the dog was walking
back and forth in front of the bassinet, still barking and growling. I
told my husband that it looked as if he was guarding our baby. Suddenly
the phone started to ring. I looked at the clock and it was 11:15! I was
tired and irritated and told my husband to answer the phone. As soon as
he answered the phone the dog stopped barking and laid down on the floor
in front of the bassinet. In the confusion of the barking dog and screaming
baby, I didn't notice that my husband was actually talking on the phone.
It was his parents. His Grandfather has passed away a few hours prior and
they had told him that his last wish was to see his grandchild.</b>
<br><b>So, in our conclusion, we felt that we had a spiritual visitor.
His grandfather had decided to see his first great-grandchild before moving
on. And after that night, our phone stopped ringing at 11:15.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Ghosts Wakes People in House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: airswoman@msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I lived in an old farm house in gleason,Wisconsin. When I moved in
i found alot of long blonde hair on the frame of the basement door that
was in the floor.The hair still had the roots on .One night after liveing
there for a couple months. The feelings I was haveing since we moved into
the house would come to be explaned. I had put the kids to bed ,Jeremy
12,Joey(girl)11,Mike 9,Jenny 7,Chris 3,Rose 1, and laid down myself. I
was just about asleep when I felt someone stareing at me I looked expecting
to see one of the kids,but it was a figure in a black cape.I felt a COLD
chill run through my body and turned over trying to&nbsp; shake the scarry
feeling I was feeling. I&nbsp; was about to wake my husband when I heard&nbsp;
Jeremy coming down stairs. I heard him stop at the bottom of the stairs
and say," Hi Mom, I have to go poddy" I told him to go. Then he asks,"
Why aren't you in bed?" Without thinking about&nbsp; what I had just seen
I said," Jay I am in bed. " By this time he was in the bath room and he
said," Ya now you are ,but you were just sitting in the chair in the liveing
room." I didn't want to alarm him to any thing so I said ," Ok Jay Good
night!" He said," Good night mom." The next thing I knowMike is coming
down the stairs and i hear him open the bathroom door and then close i
right away,saying"Sorry mom,Why didn't you tell me you were in the bath
room?" I said," mike I am not&nbsp; in the bath room." He opens the door
and says well some one was.Then he went&nbsp; poddy and we said good night.Then
all of&nbsp; a sudden I hear Jenny screeming to the top of her lungs,"
MOM HELP ME! MOM HELP!" I run up the stairs yelling for Joey to help Jenny.
But Joey slept through it all . I get to jenny she is cring real hard and
very scared.She says," Mom there was a man beside my bed and he woke me
up saying,It's in the name of the law it's in the name of the law, Then
he went under my bed. I did not have the nerve to look so I woke up Joey
and took them down to sleep with me. Then I talked to my Pastor and he
said I should have him come and excersise the house so Then he came out
and did just that. He and his wife said they could both feel it real strongly!
I don't know if it worked or not, but for the little time we lived in the

<p><b>Grandmas House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: k9dhs@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>It had been about 6 months since my grandma had died and no one had
been in her house for the whole 6 months. One day my dad told me and my
two brothers that we were going to grandma's house to clean it up, since
no one had been there for about 6 months. My brothers and I had always
disliked going to her house it always seemed creepy to us and my dad had
something jump on him on his bed and hold him down when he was growing
up there. My grandma was very religious and she had the house blessed twice
because she said she used to hear chains in one of the bedrooms, after
the blessing the chains were heard on the outside of the bedroom. Well
that morning that we showed up to the house we felt as if we were being
watched and we saw that the rose bushes had huge roses on them.&nbsp; As
soon as we opened the fromt door we all smelled the perfume that my grandma
used to use, my two brothers and my dad and I looked at each other but
my dad said let's go in.&nbsp; As we walked through the house we noticed
that there was no dust on the furniture and the house was spotless. My
brothers and I walked by my grandma's room and the rocking chair that she
always sat on reading her bible started to rock, not fast but slow and
steady, just like she used to rock on it.&nbsp; Well, me and my brothers
ran outside where my dad was talking to the neighbor and she asked my dad
"how was my grandma doing?" My dad told her that she had passed away about
six months ago, the neighbor nearly fell and we all jumped the wall to
help her and when she came to she told my dad "How could that be, I was
talking to her yesterday while she watered her rose bushes"&nbsp; Needless
to say that my brothers and I have never gone back to the house.&nbsp;
My dad and aunts do continue to visit the house and my dad says that he
still talks to my grandma.&nbsp; They have never spoke about selling her
house anymore.</b>
<br><b>For all of you out there who doubt this one, I can't tell you what
to beleive but I know that this is true I LIVED THROUGH THIS and this is
not the only story I have my brothers and I seem to have something that
attracts ghosts.&nbsp; If ever in el paso ask for the house that people
see the old lady at about 2 in the morning watering her roses.</b>

<p><b>Late Husband</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: nstovall@comcast.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello, I'm not exactly sure I should do this. I'm 30 years old and
I've never experienced any odd events until my first husband died. We were
very young when we married in High School (no I was not pregnant). Sweethearts
since Jr High. Graduated and had promising futures when he died in a car
accident in Athens, Georgia.</b>
<br><b>I've heard stories from experiences his dad had the night he died.
My late husband had a very loud truck (common here in GA) and my father-in-law
said he knew something was wrong when he heard the truck in the driveway
at around 2am. We lived in Athens but not with his parents. He said he
went into the living and saw him sitting on the couch very quite. My father-in-law
said he didn't look clear or misty but very pale. My father-in-law went
into the kitchen for some water thinking my husband was there due to a
fight we might have had or something, when he can back from the kitchen,
Richard was gone.</b>
<br><b>I got the call at 5am about his accident and that they were working
at the scene (we knew all the police and emergency workers in Athens),
they needed me to come ASAP. I got dressed and started out the door when
a black and white cat showed up and followed me to the car. I didn't think
anything of it until I got back later that day and the cat was still there.
Never saw this cat before but it looked just like the tattoo Richard had
on his shoulder. Exact image of Sylvester from the cartoon Tweety.</b>
<br><b>Any how, the cat stayed on the front porch until the morning after
we buried him. I've never seen the cat since. This has been many years
ago. When I married my second husband was when things really started. My
second husband became a very violent man. After his "episodes" he would
wake up in the middle of the night not being able to move, said someone
was holding him down. He started feeling someone squeezing his arm when
he raised it to hit me.</b>
<br><b>Things calmed down after our divorce except for the photo albums
I had. Right before something bad would happen things would fall off the
shelve in the closet. This is where I kept all the photos of Richard, his
death certificate and images from when he was a child all the way to his
funeral. They would always fall to open on one photo that was taken of
us 2 weeks before he died.</b>
<br><b>When I married my present husband things started again. But they
were calming. I always thought Richard was with me in some form. My husband
saw a man in our kitchen one night. We were playing games with my step
daughter when Jeff looked up and saw Richard standing in the kitchen smiling.
Jeff, who is scared of a lot of things, just got up and went into the kitchen.
He was pale at first but came out very calm. He told me what he saw and
my step daughter told us she had seen and talked to him. She is only 6
and knows nothing about Richard. She told us that when she gets scared
at night Richard comes to her regularly and comforts her. I wont lie, I
freaked. Until she said a phrase that had me in tears and joy for the first
time of my life. She told me that Richard told her to tell me that "I looked
good in love". When Richard was alive he would sing me the song "You look
so good in love" by George Straight every night while we were getting ready
for bed. At first I thought maybe she had seen the sheet music I had of
this song in the photo albums I had of Richard but I realized there was
no way she could have seen this since she is only 6 and could never reach
that shelf.</b>
<br><b>Since January of 2004 my husband has seen Richard a good many times.
My step-daughter has talked to him and inlighted us on their conversations,
mainly things as to where she left her shoes (usually hidden under clothes).
But I have not seen him nor heard anything. My family tells me now, since
my daughter has informed them we are haunted, that they knew Richard would
watch over me. After all these years I found out from his family and co-workers
that the day he died he told them what he wanted done with his body and
where he wanted to be when he died. I never figured it out when we had
out last conversation until all this started happening. His last words
to me before he left work was "No matter what happens tonight, remember
I will always love you and be with you". I still have to drive past the
spot where he died twice a day my car had never ridden so smoothly as it
does when we pass that spot. The cross is still there and we maintain it
regularly</b>

<br><b>Leave the Lady and the Nightmares</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:bls1975@nu-world.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have just a few questions. My son and lived in a duplex about 4
or 5 years ago. That that time my son would have been 3 or 4.</b>
<br><b>When we moved in very thing was great. We got to know are neighbors
in the other side of the duplex and we became great friends. That was March
of 1999. My neighbor told that in there side of the duplex they could here
a small baby crying, but looked around and found nothing. That falling
Septmeber my neighbor took his own life, in there side of the duplex. That
October trouble began in our side. My son began having horriable nightmares.
(He did not know exactally what had happened next door) To point of there
was no sleeping at night.</b>
<br><b>The nightmares where the worst I have very seen. To look at him,
sleeping peacefully. Then to go from thrashing around and acting like he
was not able to move his one arm (and always the same arm) and screaming
in his sleep. It was horriable. I would have to try very hard to get him
awake and to get him to settle down.</b>
<br><b>One we where all in bed. He began crying. So I got up and by the
time I checked his bedroom door he began screaming that there was someone
in the house. I had a friend spending the night that night so was looked
through out the house and there was nothing there. I explained to him that
here was nothing there and got him claimed down and went back to bed. Knowing
that he is fully awake he starts yelling again. "Mom she is in the hallway"
So once again, we jumped up and there was nothing there. That night, he
told me that there was a lady in the hallway, standing there and waving
him to come to her.</b>
<br><b>Now this happened more that once, it happened all the time. I could
never see her. One night it was late, when we got home. He told me that
she was standing in front of my bed. I still could not see her.</b>
<br><b>Shortly after all of this, we moved. Leave the lady behind and the
nightmares.</b><b></b>

<p><b>By: ichoosebliss@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I am a great fan of your website, and have decided to share my experiences
with you.</b>
<br><b>I have believed in ghosts my whole life, but never actually encountered
anything....until a few years ago.</b>
<br><b>About 2 years ago, I did a course in Reiki (with my boyfriends ex
wife - a Reiki master). As part of the course, is the opening of your 3rd
eye, to allow the healing energy to flow through you. It was after this,
that strange things started happening to me.</b>
<br><b>My psychic ability (which was almost non existant) became apparent
and I started to receive messages from people who had 'passed over' while
chatting to others on the net. (eg. I knew a woman put a brown teddybear
in her grandson's coffin etc).</b>
<br><b>It was about this time that strange things started to happen in
our home.</b>
<br><b>One evening, while watching TV with my boyfriend, I saw a small
boy walk accross our loungeroom. I saw him clearly, and he was neither
solid nor transpearant. He was wearing a long, white nightdress. Not long
after this, my daughter, who was 2 or 3 at the time, started talking to
and blowing kisses to 'the little boy'.</b>
<br><b>A few moths later, I saw a tall man wearing a coat and hat (circa
1950's) walk into my bedroom.</b>
<br><b>Then I had a dream (I have since been told that spirits can communicate
with you in dreams). I walked into my bedroom and saw an old man fishing.
I asked him who he was and he said he used to come fishing here years ago
when the was a stream running by (we have a major river in Adelaide, Australia
aprox 2km up the road from us, so a stream may have run from there).</b>
<br><b>Then, one night, I awoke to hear our phone being dialled (a handheld
phone which I always kept in it's crib next to my bed). I said 'I hear
the phone'. My boyfriend also heard it, but we fell asleep again. The next
morning, I found it on the floor at the base of our bed. I thought it pretty
strange at the time, but now I wish I had redialed to find out who it was
calling.</b>
<br><b>Our son was born in 2002. I would often have him in the computer
room with me while I was in chatrooms. More times than I can count, I would
hear and feel my boyfriend enter the room and kneel beside my son. When
I would turn to talk to him, no one would be there, but my son would be
smiling at something.</b>
<br><b>I have never felt threatened by our companions, and they make themselves
known to me on a daily basis. Footsteps, voices, children laughing, physically
feeling someone in the room with me are natural occurances (which only
I am privvy to).</b>
<br><b>I have felt, seen and heard ghosts in other places to (old hotels,
houses, cemetaries) but I never get scared, just most of the time I feel
their saddness or frustration.</b>
<br><b>I consider it a privialge to have this gift and treat it and the
ghosts with the respect they deserve.</b>
<br><b>Thanks!!</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Childhood Haunted Home</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: janet132@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I grew up in a house that I believe is haunted. We heard footsteps
on the second floor yet no one was found.We also heard a phantom car door
slamming,usually in the afternoon. I was so used to these things that I
was never afraid. After I married,I moved to a house a few miles from my
parents. Pans would fly out of the cabinets on their own,and my daughter
and I both heard a child crying.But the most startling thing happened to
me one afternoon when I was at an outside water hydrant getting water for
our dogs.Suddenly out of nowhere a loud booming male voice yelled "STOP
IT!"&nbsp;&nbsp; I was so startled that I dropped the water bucket,yet
there was no one there but me. I found out later that a very harsh man
and his family had lived there many years ago and that he was quite cruel
to his children.That would explain the sounds of crying children and the
loud commanding voice. And ,no,I didn't move out of that house,I just chalked
it up to another ghostly experience.</b>

<br><b>Not a Dream</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sbentty@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>A little over two years ago I lost someone I loved very much in a
drunk driving accident. I'll call him Tyler. Tyler was only 22 and I was
hopelessly in love with him. After his death I found it impossible to attend
either the funeral or wake. I remained in a very deep depression for months.
I often dreamnt of him but one night, about six months or so following
his death was very different.</b>
<br><b>In this dream every detail was crystal clear. I remember that he
wore a beutiful suit which was almost beige.He was smiling and I was in
shock. He told me that I had to stop feeling bad, that he had watched me
beat myself up after his death and that it was hurting him. I asked him
how his father was coping and he said pretty well. Then I asked him the
obvious. What is it like. He responded it was wonderful. You can be or
do anything you wish. Loving animal as I do I asked if there were animals
there and all of a sudden he held what looked like a baby penguin in his
arms.</b>
<br><b>When I woke I felt as though a weight had been lifted. I had always
been skeptical about the afterlife but no dream was ever that vivid. His
voice and his eyes. The next day driving to work I asked Tyler to let me
know that it indeed was him that I had spoken to the night before. As I
said it one of his favorite songs came on directly followed by a song he
used to sing to me. I know he is with me always and I know he never wants
me to grieve for him because he is okay and someday we will meet again.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Old Farmland</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MentalIyDeranged@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>We live on old farmland. The house we live in is rumored to be a
slave house. Sometimes out of no where, things will fall off shelves and
break. Alot of times at night, you can hear strange noises, such as banging
on doors, windows, and anything metal. Which always happens at around the
same times. People who live here have seen a young man walk up to the front
door (the door is made of glass)&nbsp; wearing a hat, white shirt and smokeing
a cigeratte, as soon as he gets up to the door, he reachs out for the door
knob and vanishes. Sometimes u can hear screams, people walking, running
and shuffeling. Sometimes during the day if ur in the "slave bedroom" u
can hear someone walking past the outside window and into the house, slaming
the door and walking to the back of the house, then comeing back threw
past the bedroom and out the door. Sometimes it will come back in after
wards running and slamming doors, and then running out and past the window
again. In the "slave bedroom" there is a side door,(3rd door to the room)
we assume to be used for easy access to the farm land or if their masters
needed them. At night sometimes u can hear someone trying to get in that
door. and pulling the screen off the windows near that door. Sometimes
during the day, you will see something run past the windows. It looks like
a human shadow. But when u go to check it out, their is nothing.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Queen Mary Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: RAMBOLINA@peoplepc.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Several years ago a friend and I stayed over night at the Queen Mary.&nbsp;
We both were getting ready to go to bed for the night and all of a sudden
the shower came on in the bathroom.&nbsp; Neither one of us were in the
bathroom.&nbsp; Sure startled us!!&nbsp; I would love to go and stay at
the Queen Mary again to see if anything else would happen.</b>
