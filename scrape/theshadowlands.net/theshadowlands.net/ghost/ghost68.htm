</H3><P><B>By:  frohicke@texas.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I live in central Texas. My mother-in-law </B>
<P><B>whose name is Jane has been the unfortunate victum of living with two
entities </B>
<P><B>for the last fifteen years or so. Let me tell you about Jane, she is
real </B>
<P><B>great and I would never trade her for anything, however, she is a real
</B>
<P><B>cleaner. And I mean this girl can clean! And she knows where </B>
<P><B>everything in her house is and is supposed to go. It drives her nuts
if </B>
<P><B>the slightest thing is out of order. You can not wear your shoes on
the </B>
<P><B>carpet, lean against the walls, put anything in the refrig without
wiping it </B>
<P><B>off, and no smoking or drinking. They had their home built new in a
new up and </B>
<P><B>coming subdivision in 1984. It is a nice all brick two story home,
four </B>
<P><B>bedrooms, two and half baths. The first experience came the day after
they </B>
<P><B>moved in. Jane and her oldest daughter Lisa had left to go clean their
</B>
<P><B>former home leaving her husband Dan and her two younger daughters Laurie
and </B>
<P><B>Megan at home. Both girls had crawled into bed with Dan and shortly
after </B>
<P><B>Dan heard someone downstairs turning on the water and closing cabinets
he also </B>
<P><B>heard them walking through the rooms and on the stairs. Dan assumed
that </B>
<P><B>Lisa had not left with Jane and went back to sleep. After ten he and
the </B>
<P><B>younger girls got up and when he could not find Lisa he got real </B>
<P><B>concerned. In fact he was so sure that someone had been in the house
he </B>
<P><B>took both Laurie and Megan and drove back to their former house that
Jane AND </B>
<P><B>Lisa were cleaning up (which was a good twentyfive miles away).</B>
<P><B>Later Jane would hear voices (high pitched) and </B>
<P><B>things would be moved. This especially drove her crazy because she
KNEW </B>
<P><B>where she had put something. Bad smells would come up in a room that
had </B>
<P><B>been vacant all day. Cigar smoke would often occur in the one bedroom
that </B>
<P><B>was unused. And the doors would unlock, this was really bad because
if her </B>
<P><B>husband came home he would get really mad and yell at her (causing
you guessed </B>
<P><B>it a real strain on their marriage) she would double and triple check
</B>
<P><B>herself that the door was locked and whalla it would be unlocked and
sometimes </B>
<P><B>wide open when she got home from the store or the bank or whereever.
Light </B>
<P><B>switches would go on and off. Once when she was standing right next
to </B>
<P><B>it!The house had a real freaky feel to it and often </B>
<P><B>you would see shadows out of the corner of your eye.After I married
her son and became more</B>
<P><B> familier with the </B>
<P><B>problem Jane opened up to me more. They had lived in the house for
about </B>
<P><B>six years when Lisa first saw the first entity. She had stayed home
while </B>
<P><B>Jane took the younger girls for haircuts. She was in the younger girls
</B>
<P><B>room making Megan's bed (A rarity unto itself!) when she looked up
and saw a </B>
<P><B>girl sitting on the floor near the TV and door.The girl was about twelve
</B>
<P><B>or thirteen with long hair and a long dress. She had her knees bent
and </B>
<P><B>her arms around her knees. Lisa watched her for a few moments and then
the </B>
<P><B>girl disapeared. She was watching TV downstairs and looked up </B>
<P><B>to see the same girl come down the stairs and fade away. </B>
<P><B>She quickly went outside and waited nearly hysterical for Jane to come
</B>
<P><B>home. The two younger girls of Janes were often reporting hearing things
</B>
<P><B>and once the older one, Laurie, was pulled slightly down the stairs.
When </B>
<P><B>questioned about it she told her mom that whatever touched her had
been </B>
<P><B>jolly</B>
<P><B>One morning while fixing breakfast Laurie was </B>
<P><B>sitting at the table nearby and Jane heard a voice clear as day asking
her a </B>
<P><B>question (unfortunately she could not remember what the words were)
Jane assumed </B>
<P><B>it was her younger daughter annoying her and told her to wait. Then
she </B>
<P><B>and Laurie realized at the same time that the voice had not been Megan
or anyone </B>
<P><B>else.</B>
<P><B>For a long time the entity would awaken her at </B>
<P><B>night by trying to get into bed with her and Dan. She would feel it
crawl </B>
<P><B>up onto the bed and the weight of it across her legs. She likened it
to a </B>
<P><B>toddler crawling up the bed to sleep with her. When it would happen
she </B>
<P><B>would lay still and wait for the feeling or presence to go away This
</B>
<P><B>happened sometimes several nights in a row and then nothing for a long
</B>
<P><B>time. Sometimes her husband was aware of something and sometimes </B>
<P><B>not. He remained of the opinion that all of them (wife and girls) were
</B>
<P><B>nuts as he refused to admit to having experienced anything. Several
times </B>
<P><B>when Jane was reading in the bath (she's got one of those great whirlpool
tubs </B>
<P><B>that you can lay and read in for hours) she would hear him murmering
in his </B>
<P><B>sleep like maybe the presence was messing with him. She also woke up
twice </B>
<P><B>and when leaning over to look at the clock looked down and saw two
girls laying </B>
<P><B>on the floor.</B>
<P><B>There was a night when she </B>
<P><B>woke and saw a red door hanging in the room. (I never understood where
</B>
<P><B>this fit in) this scared her badly and she never went back to sleep
that </B>
<P><B>night.</B>
<P><B>As unnerving as all of this is Jane was not ever afraid well </B>
<P><B>at least not to the point of getting help or moving. But she was afraid
</B>
<P><B>real bad once.While vaccuming she got real real scared and out of the
</B>
<P><B>corner of her eyes saw something. Shortly afterwards (I forget if this
was </B>
<P><B>later that day or the next day) she was doing dishes and got the same
feeling </B>
<P><B>she turned and saw a man in the kitchen behind her close to the table.
He </B>
<P><B>was short with short dark hair parted and combed over. Dark rimmed
</B>
<P><B>glasses, mustache, blue work shirt (like a mechanic) and dark pants
with heavy </B>
<P><B>black shoes. He was gone from her vision instantly but obviously she
got a </B>
<P><B>good enough look. He frightened her very badly but has never been seen
</B>
<P><B>since.</B>
<P><B>Dan finally got a look at it. Jane was up late reading </B>
<P><B>the paper at the table (as is her nightly habit before taking her bath)
and Dan </B>
<P><B>came in the kitchen and popped her on top of her head.I just saw </B>
<P><B>your little friend. he said and continued that he was watching TV </B>
<P><B>and saw one of the girls standing at the foot of the stairs in a gown
watching </B>
<P><B>him. After a moment he realized both of his girls were much older and
they </B>
<P><B>didn't wear nightgowns nor had he seen them come downstairs. He looked
</B>
<P><B>again and she was still there after a moment he looked again but she
was gone </B>
<P><B>and then he went to thump my mother-in-law on the head and tell her.
He </B>
<P><B>was pretty shaken up about it and later refused to talk about it.</B>
<P><B>Jane started to really miss things around the </B>
<P><B>house. A favorite hair bow of Lauries was missing for months and one
day </B>
<P><B>while putting away the laundry she closed one drawer put some underwear
away </B>
<P><B>opened the first drawer again and on top of some folded t-shirts was
the </B>
<P><B>hairbow. A Bealls credit card went missing for several weeks and made
her </B>
<P><B>miss using it for a sale. Once when putting up sheets in the closet
she </B>
<P><B>could not shut it and after trying seveal times held the door open
all the way </B>
<P><B>asked the presence to leave and was able to shut the door right </B>
<P><B>away.</B>
<P><B>The upstairs TV's had </B>
<P><B>serious problems one that would glow when unplugged (Jane's room) and
one (girls </B>
<P><B>room) that would change channels continuously when she was in the room
once she </B>
<P><B>really wanted to watch something on Oprah while making beds and when
she asked </B>
<P><B>IT to stop and explained how much she wanted to see the show the TV
changed </B>
<P><B>channels all the way to the channel with Oprah and stopped</B>
<P><B>Lisa would wake up with one </B>
<P><B>of her posters (The Nelson's remember them) in bed with her under her
</B>
<P><B>covers.</B>
<P><B>We came to the conclusion </B>
<P><B>that it was two girls one preteen and one about five. (with the exception
</B>
<P><B>of the man) The subdivision was wooded farmland before being developed
so </B>
<P><B>there is no way of ever knowing what happened to bring the spirits
into her </B>
<P><B>home.</B>
<P><B>Finally Jane took a step that has help </B>
<P><B>somewhat. Never particularly religious she made the decision to make
it </B>
<P><B>stop. She asked the presence to leave her and the family alone and
put out </B>
<P><B>her bible. Since then about two years there have only been small </B>
<P><B>occurences that could also be dismissed as something else, but she
knows in her </B>
<P><B>heart that it is probably the entity making itself known.</B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>   My great grandmother died in the begining of 1980, months before
I would be</B>
<P><B>born.</B>
<P><B>Everyone was excited about my birth because they all hoped I would
be the</B>
<P><B>first girl born,since there where so many boys. My mother and father
were busy</B>
<P><B>building there first home and during this, my mom found a small white
bow on</B>
<P><B>the ground of the half built house. It looked like a bow that would
be</B>
<P><B>attached to a little doll. She thought nothing of it and threw it
away.Right</B>
<P><B>before my birth our house was complete. My mother was walking through
the</B>
<P><B>kitchen when she felt a presence behind her,she turned,and for some
reason</B>
<P><B>looked down to find the same little bow she found before. She was sure
this</B>
<P><B>was a sign from my great grandmother that she was having a girl. She
placed</B>
<P><B>the bow in a small green box to save. Sure enough, a few weeks later
she</B>
<P><B>delivered a baby girl ! I still have the little white bow my great
grandma</B>
<P><B>gave to my mother, every once in a while I look at it and remember
this story.</B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>    This may be a rather long story but I'll try my best to condense.</B>
<P>
<P><B>    One night while I was alone in my apartment, some presence tried
to</B>
<P><B>get my attention.  I was relaxing in the bathtub trying to get rid
of a</B>
<P><B>murderous daylong headache, when suddenly the doorknob started
rattling</B>
<P><B>as if someone were trying to get in.  The door had been locked but
with</B>
<P><B>the frantic turning of the knob, the lock popped open.  I covered
myself</B>
<P><B>with a towel and quickly got out of the tub expecting one of my male</B>
<P><B>roommates to come barging in on my female nakedness.  I shouted to
the</B>
<P><B>moronic person that I was in the bathroom and wasn't the locked door</B>
<P><B>obvious!  I left the bathroom and checked around the apartment to be</B>
<P><B>sure the doors and windows were locked and closed.  I also wanted to</B>
<P><B>catch the deviant roommate and yell at him for disturbing my bath.
 But</B>
<P><B>my cat and I were alone in the apartment and all entrances were</B>
<P><B>secured.  I was perplexed but kept this incident to myself.</B>
<P>
<P><B>    Two nights later I was home alone again and I was lying on the
bed</B>
<P><B>reading.  My cat was sitting on the chair next to my bed facing me
when</B>
<P><B>both of us were startled by the sound of plates crashing and
scattering</B>
<P><B>all over the kitchen floor.  The cat even heard the noise because she</B>
<P><B>jumped and looked toward the kitchen.  We both got up to head for the</B>
<P><B>kitchen so I could clean up the mess, but nothing was broken and I
had</B>
<P><B>thoroughly searched the cabinets and the floor.  I gave up and went
back</B>
<P><B>to the bed but in the back of my mind, I was starting to wonder if
this</B>
<P><B>was a ghost.</B>
<P>
<P><B>    I decided to tell one of my roommates, who I was fairly close
with</B>
<P><B>at the time, my story.  We were eating dinner at an ice cream</B>
<P><B>parlor/diner.  The location of the diner is significant because it
is</B>
<P><B>right across from the Mass Pike.  Anyway, he was reluctant to believe
my</B>
<P><B>ghostly theory, saying that he believed that I believed what I had
seen</B>
<P><B>but that he had no frame of reference to go on so he didn't know what
to</B>
<P><B>think.  Disappointed at his inability to support me, I did not
mention</B>
<P><B>the two incidents the rest of the evening.</B>
<P>
<P><B>    We were driving back home on the Mass Pike when I noticed a white</B>
<P><B>ball of light on the side of the road.  I watched it float through
the</B>
<P><B>passenger side headlight and into the van.  Because I was rather
pi**ed</B>
<P><B>at the driver's wimpy response to my story about his having no frame
of</B>
<P><B>reference to go by, I felt he was undeserving to be told about the
orb.</B>
<P><B>Plus I figured he wouldn't believe it anyway.</B>
<P>
<P><B>    I was shocked when he pulled to the side of the road.  He was</B>
<P><B>rocking back and forth with his hands clasped to his head chanting
over</B>
<P><B>and over again "I don't believe it, I don't believe what I just saw".</B>
<P><B>To quote myself I said, "You saw the ball of fog, didn't you!", and
he</B>
<P><B>did see it!</B>
<P>
<P><B>    What a refreshing feeling for me when I could actually witness
him</B>
<P><B>finally getting a frame of reference to go by.   Thanks for
listening.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=old>My Old Home</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By:  EdgePDSaga@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Im not sure what time it was but to my guess around 7:00 pm. I was
maybe 6 or</B>
<P><B>older that time when I first saw them.. I was with my two cousins one
older</B>
<P><B>then me a year and the other younger then me 2 years. The three of
us were</B>
<P><B>sitting on my cousins parents bed drawing. I just looked up from the
picture I</B>
<P><B>was drawing and there before me and my two cousins were men-like shape
but no</B>
<P><B>faces walking around the side of bed. They look like they're searching
for</B>
<P><B>something.. The first thing I said was look! I pointed at the men-like
figures</B>
<P><B>walking around and my cousin(older one) looked up and my older one
too saw</B>
<P><B>them but my younger cousin can't. They were walking in to my cousin's
older</B>
<P><B>sisters room. The room always seemed wierd to me cause of the white
curtains</B>
<P><B>and the bed. Of course... without thinking we ran up to the second
floor.About</B>
<P><B>halfway up we heard my younger cousin still downstairs crying. We told
him to</B>
<P><B>run up but he refused told us to come down and get him. He jumped on
his bed</B>
<P><B>crying. Seemed wierd to me so we just ran upstairs and knocked madly
on door</B>
<P><B>of my sister,me, and other cousin room. They opened the door and we
ran in. We</B>
<P><B>told them what we saw and they were confused not sure to believe us
or not.</B>
<P><B>Few weeks later everyone went out somewhere but my 1 year older then
me cousin </B>
<P><B>her older cousin and grandma didn't. My cousin told me that they heard
strange</B>
<P><B>noises seeming to be coming under her desk. Grandma was outside doing</B>
<P><B>something so they screamed out for thier grandma. And when she came
in the</B>
<P><B>noises stopped. When she went out again the noises reappers. Whats
wierd? theres</B>
<P><B>a statue of a boy in our backyard, that really gets me the creeps.
I then knew</B>
<P><B>what was causing this  when i asked my sister why do you think its
haunted?</B>
<P><B>has someone been killed here before we moved in? Then my sister told
me that</B>
<P><B>grandma told her before we moved in there was this lady who lives there
and</B>
<P><B>killed every husbands she had had. We finally moved because of family</B>
<P><B>arguements    </B>

</H3><P><B>By:  stephany@total.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>I have a rather bizarre ghost story, or maybe it just appears that
way</B>
<P><B>to me since I had never experienced ghost before.</B>
<P>
<P><B>It was many years ago when I was 14 yrs old and spending a few weeks
at</B>
<P><B>our lake home.   My best friend was also there spending the time as
were</B>
<P><B>my grandparents.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One night my friend and I decided to spend the night in the den
rather</B>
<P><B>than our bedroom.  The den has a lovely view of the lake and has a
wall</B>
<P><B>of windows.  It is a very large room.  As we were in our sleeping
bags,</B>
<P><B>I noticed what looked like a man sitting in the arm chair.  The</B>
<P><B>apparition was black, you could not distinguish any features.  But,
you</B>
<P><B>could see a bowler hat (our a similar hat) on his head.  He just sat</B>
<P><B>there and did not move,his arms resting on the chair.  I was
paralyzed</B>
<P><B>with fear.  I eventually mentioned this to my friend, or maybe she</B>
<P><B>mentioned it to me first, I`m not sure.  I just remember that after
a</B>
<P><B>long time we started talking about our late night visitor.  We
compared</B>
<P><B>notes on what we were seeing and it became apparent that we were both</B>
<P><B>seein the same thing.  A shadow?  I think not and if you read on, you</B>
<P><B>will know why I am so sure.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My friend and I became so scared they buried ourselves in our
sleeping</B>
<P><B>bags and held on to each other for dear life.  We knew we had to get
out</B>
<P><B>of there but were too scared to move.  Eventually, we got up our
nerve</B>
<P><B>and made a mad dash to the bathroom.  Keep in mind, our lake home is</B>
<P><B>quite large and the bathroom was not nearby.  We huddled in the
bathroom</B>
<P><B>for some time and got up our nerve to make it to our bedroom.  This</B>
<P><B>time, for some reason, we didn not run.  As we were making our way
to</B>
<P><B>the bedroom, we saw another apparition on the living room sofa.  This</B>
<P><B>was definetely no shadow, there were no windows in this room
therefore</B>
<P><B>no light except the bathroom light.  This apparition was easier to
see.</B>
<P><B>It was a woman from the turn of the century.  She was dressed in a
white</B>
<P><B>dress, possibly a Victorian wedding gown and lying in the pose of a</B>
<P><B>deceased person.</B>
<P>
<P><B>As you could imagine, we hightailed it to our bedroom.  When in the</B>
<P><B>bedroom we sat up with the light on.  I am not sure how much time
passed</B>
<P><B>but eventually we heard what appeared to be a marching band playing.
 We</B>
<P><B>looked at the clock and saw that it was after 3 am and therefore
highly</B>
<P><B>unlikely that a marching band we be performing in this rather sleepy</B>
<P><B>like community.  Had it not been for this, we would of considered at
as</B>
<P><B>teenage imaginations going wild.  You can see things, but hearing
them</B>
<P><B>is another story.</B>
<P>
<P><B>In the morning we checked out the house to see if there was anyway
for</B>
<P><B>music of played by itself in the house.  We found an old radio down
in</B>
<P><B>the basement but it was not plugged in.  We then plugged in the radio</B>
<P><B>and it did not even work anymore.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We asked my grandparents if they had heard anything and they said
they</B>
<P><B>had not.  When we told them our stories, they just laughed. And,
almost</B>
<P><B>everybody else we have told since laughs also.  If they don`t laugh,</B>
<P><B>they listen and nod their heads but we can tell they are just being</B>
<P><B>considerate and patronizing us.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We are now both 30 yrs old (born a day apart) and live over 1,000
miles</B>
<P><B>apart.  When we are together we still talk about this and stand by
our</B>
<P><B>story and memory.  We still agree about what we saw and heard.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have no explanation about this but I will not sleep alone in this</B>
<P><B>house.  I don`t even visit often but when I do, I`m still scared to</B>
<P><B>death</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=freaky>Freaky Experience!</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By:   anonymous</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I was 14 years old when I had the most Freaky Experience!</B>
<P><B>  It was about 4:30 in the morning when it started.I was laying n my</B>
<P><B>twin bed in my room.</B>
<P><B>My bedroom was upstairs at the time.There were three rooms
upstairs.My</B>
<P><B>brothers,then a spare room,Then mine which joined the spare room.</B>
<P><B>  My Bedroom didn't have a door on it.The Hall light on the stairs
was</B>
<P><B>always left on.My bed was put to where I could look atthe paneled
wall</B>
<P><B>in the spare room.The Hall light would shine onto that wall in the
spare</B>
<P><B>room.</B>
<P><B>  Well,I woke up at abut 4:30am.It was a school night,and I couldn't</B>
<P><B>fall back asleep.So I laid in my bed,just looking at the wall.(My
floor</B>
<P><B>was wood).Anyway thats when it started.Iheard like a dogs walkig
across</B>
<P><B>the floor.You know like when you hear a dogs nails hit on a wood
floor.</B>
<P><B>I looked to see what it was.Nothing was there.I thought to myself,you</B>
<P><B>must be hearing things.</B>
<P><B>I laid there and looked at the paneled wall in the spare room.</B>
<P><B>  Then the shadows on the wall started to change.It changed into a
fetus</B>
<P><B>curled up still connected to the umbilical cord.I was really freaking</B>
<P><B>out.I started rubbing my eyes to make sure I wasn't seeing things.It
was</B>
<P><B>still there.</B>
<P><B>  Then it changed again.I saw two people.A man and a woman.The were</B>
<P><B>facing each other.And their lips were moving,like they were talking
to</B>
<P><B>each other.I could hear very faint whispering.It was weird.I was
scared</B>
<P><B>and I was curious.I couldn't really move.I did pinch myself</B>
<P><B>to see if I was fully awake.</B>
<P><B>  I rubbed my eyes several times to see if I was seeing this for</B>
<P><B>real.Then I saw an elderly woman.She was in a long dress,she was
holding</B>
<P><B>a cain.Her hair was in a bunn.She just appeared next to the other two</B>
<P><B>people.She just stood there.</B>
<P><B>  I was scared,but I didn't feel true fear till what happened
next.The</B>
<P><B>people o the wall disappeared.Then another figure appeared.</B>
<P><B>It was a man.He had no hair,and was very muscular.He started walkin</B>
<P><B>toward my room.I was petrefied.I started to pray to GOD.My brother</B>
<P><B>coughed n his room.The figure turned his head sharply to look.I was</B>
<P><B>sweating now,praying my butt off.</B>
<P><B>  He looked my way and you could see himgetting bigger,and closer.He</B>
<P><B>blocked the light out .The only light that I could see was the light</B>
<P><B>from where his head was shaped and shoulders.I was stilliing praying.</B>
<P><B>  Then out f no where a white smoke like ball</B>
<P><B>was above my head.I felt comfortable.Then like everything went
whish.And</B>
<P><B>everything was gone.</B>
<P><B>  It took 2 hours for this to end.I laid in bed till my brothers
alarm</B>
<P><B>went off.As soon as my brother came out of his room,I ran down th
stairs</B>
<P><B>to wake my mother.I was hysterical.</B>
<P><B>My bed was soaked with sweat.</B>
<P><B>  I'm 31 now.I remember that day like it was yesterday.I'm an
ordinary</B>
<P><B>person,with an ordinary life.I don't have no super great memory</B>
<P><B>,but that day I remember very clearly.</B>
<P><B>  I tried to figure out who the people might be.</B>
<P><B>&gt;From what I understand an elderly woman had died in the house.</B>
<P><B>  My mother lost 2 babies at that time.And my aunt had died...That</B>
<P><B>explains the woman.She had dark long hair,like the shadow did.</B>
<P><B>  I can't figure out about the man.</B>
<P><B>  The big bald muscular guy,Was evil.I felt it.</B>
<P><B>I was terrified when he appeared.</B>
<P><B>  The only thing I can figure the white ball was,</B>
<P><B>was pure and good.Sent from God.</B>
<P><B>  I'm not a real church goer.I'm just an average person.I beleive in</B>

<P>
<P><B>Some years ago, while vacationing in north western Sjealand in Denmark,
I had what you might</B>
<P><B> call a paranormal experience.  We had some sort of electrical black
out, but the strangest </B>
<P><B>thing was that the light bulbs on all of the lights glowed a dim redish
orange.  Very eery...</B>
<P><B>  I looked out the living room window, it's a rather large one so nothing
was blocking my </B>
<P><B>view when I saw an aparition standing just outside the window.  She
wore a white flowing </B>
<P><B>shroud, one eye showed from under her wrapping...and the eye was just
an empty socket.  </B>
<P><B>She stood there for a few minutes , while I finally got the nerve to
run out there and </B>
<P><B>investigate more, but when I got outside, she was gone</B>
<P><B>Now mind you, the town I stay in during the summer in Denmark is litered
with broze and viking</B>
<P><B> age grave mounds, heathen worship sites, and the site of the grave
of Saint Hellana of Sweden.</B>
<P><B>  Holy wells span through the country side, the local church is buried
on top of an old heathen</B>
<P><B> site, and there is an old road dating back a couple thousand years.
 </B>
<P>
<P><B>Local myth says that there are elves dwelling by the grave mounds,
some of which will try</B>
<P><B> and lure you to your deaths and suck out your soul.  If you ever walk
through the forests</B>
<P><B> in Tisvildehegn, I'm sure you'd agree that it's a spiritual and perhaps
a haunted place.</B>
<P>
<P><B>There is a bog in the very same forest, every full moon you can see
"spirits" dancing on the</B>
<P><B> water there, I think they are more commonly known as the Willow of
the Wisps, its an exciting</B>
<P><B> experience....I've seen them once and would love to see them again.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=from>Stories from Mass.</A></B>
</H3><P><B>BY: abutterfly@n2music.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Hi again.</B>
<P><B>Recently I sent another page of stories and I am here </B>
<P><B>to add another batch to your great website. In the </B>
<P><B>first batch I told some of my experiences in my grandma</B>
<P><B>home, now I will tell you some of the stories that my </B>
<P><B>family has passed down to me, they come from everywhere</B>
<P><B>in the U.S mostly in mass. The first one that I can </B>
<P><B>vividly remember is a recent one which occured about </B>
<P><B>1yr ago. One day at my gradmothers house in the Cape, </B>
<P><B>my younger cousin Matt was taking a bath and he felt </B>
<P><B>like someone was in the room with him. At first he </B>
<P><B>thought it was his older sister who spent most of her </B>
<P><B>time in the bathroom, and her told her to get lost but</B>
<P><B>the presence didn't go away so he pushed the curtain </B>
<P><B>back a little to see who it was and there was a girl </B>
<P><B>standing there. He said she had the meanest grin on her</B>
<P><B>face, which was all swollen and purple, He closed his </B>
<P><B>eyes and when he opened them again she wasn't there </B>
<P><B>anymore, but he said he could still feel her there. </B>
<P><B>The second one I can remember is when my cousin Kelly </B>
<P><B>(Matts older sister) was home alone and her dog Robin </B>
<P><B>was with her in the den. Kelly said she could hear </B>
<P><B>footsteps going across the upstairs rooms, after the </B>
<P><B>first time her dog flipped out and ran to the foot of </B>
<P><B>the stairs and started barking. She got up and looked </B>
<P><B>upstairs and she couldn't see anything and the steps </B>
<P><B>stopped, so she went and sat back down. When she sat </B>
<P><B>down the footsteps started again! and the dog went </B>
<P><B>beserk again, only this time she could here the steps </B>
<P><B>coming down the stairs! and the dog ran away </B>
<P><B>whimpering with his tail between his legs. The steps </B>
<P><B>stopped at the foot of the stairs and Kelly saw a man </B>
<P><B>come around the corner he had a glow around him and </B>
<P><B>looked like my uncle. Kelly said she freeked and ran </B>
<P><B>out the door into her moms arms. Later they asked her </B>
<P><B>to look at a picture, she did and said THAT'S HIM! It </B>
<P><B>was my grandpa who had been dead since my dad was 15 </B>
<P><B>and he is now 37. Another story I can remember is a </B>
<P><B>short one. My aunt had come home from work and was </B>
<P><B>sooo tired she fell asleep on the couch. She woke up </B>
<P><B>and felt someone sit down at the end of the couch she </B>
<P><B>turned on the light, thinking it was my cousin having </B>
<P><B>a case of insomnia, and looked at the end of the </B>
<P><B>couch. There was no one there! She could see the </B>
<P><B>imprint as if someone was there but no one was! She </B>
<P><B>got up and went upstairs and slept in the bed with my </B>
<P><B>grandma. Another story was when one day my cousin </B>
<P><B>Kelly and my aunt were arguing in the T.V. room, my </B>
<P><B>other cousin Heather was in there to, when the </B>
<P><B>argument got a little heated the T.V. turned on all by </B>
<P><B>it's self and started to change channels really fast. </B>
<P><B>Heather yelled at them to shut up and look, when they </B>
<P><B>did it stopped. They shrugged their shoulders and </B>
<P><B>continued in their "disscusion" and again the T.V. </B>
<P><B>started to act up! My aunt and Kelly stopped arguing </B>
<P><B>and it stopped to. They apologized and the T.V. shut </B>
<P><B>off! It was like it was warning them to stop arguing </B>
<P><B>it never happened again.One night when my dad was </B>
<P><B>little there was a storm, this is when he lived in a </B>
<P><B>house in Hingham, him and 4 of his brothers and </B>
<P><B>sisters where sleeping downstairs because they where </B>
<P><B>scared. My grandma went out to get some candles and </B>
<P><B>other supplies for the night, before she left she told </B>
<P><B>them to pick up all of the toys that were at the </B>
<P><B>bottom of the steps,so they did then they all went to </B>
<P><B>bed. About 20 mins later they heard what sounded like </B>
<P><B>some one was THROWING the toys down the stairs, so his </B>
<P><B>older sister and brother went and looked. There was no </B>
<P><B>toys and the noise stopped as soon as they went out </B>
<P><B>there. This continued for awhile they would hear the </B>
<P><B>noise get up check and there would be nothing. About </B>
<P><B>an hour after his mom left his older sisters friends </B>
<P><B>showed up and they heard the noise to, so they checked </B>
<P><B>the house and the noise stopped so my dad and the rest </B>
<P><B>of his brothers and sisters got up the courage and </B>
<P><B>went out by the stairs. After a few seconds a little </B>
<P><B>toy barbie boot came tumbling down the stairs from </B>
<P><B>nowhere! I have two stories left so bear with me! One </B>
<P><B>night after my parents had met, they went to his house </B>
<P><B>to watch a movie.(some cheesy horror flick,no doubt)</B>
<P><B>After they had watched the movie for awhile my dad </B>
<P><B>went into the kitchen to get some more food, or </B>
<P><B>something,(at this point I should mention they where </B>
<P><B>alone)and he left my mom alone. My mom said she turned </B>
<P><B>around and saw a man sitting near her in a armchair. </B>
<P><B>She smiled and he smiled back, the girl on the screen </B>
<P><B>screamed and my mom turned away for a second and when </B>
<P><B>she looked back he was gone! When my dad came back in </B>
<P><B>the room she told him what happened, they shrugged it </B>
<P><B>off as her imagination overreacting. At the end of the </B>
<P><B>movie as she was leaving she saw a picture hanging on </B>
<P><B>the wall near the door she asked my dad who it was. He </B>
<P><B>said "oh thats my dad, Why?" She said "thats the man </B>
<P><B>in the chair". My dad got really pale and said "he's </B>
<P><B>been dead since I was fifteen". seems my dads dad was </B>
<P><B>saying hello to his sons girlfriend! O.K my last story </B>
<P><B>has to do with my moms side of the family. A few days </B>
<P><B>after the death of my great-grandma my mom was folding </B>
<P><B>laundry in my living room (we used to live in Hull in </B>
<P><B>my grandma's house.) She smeled this overwhelming rose </B>
<P><B>scent. It reminded her of the roses at her grandmas </B>
<P><B>funeral, They had all roses because that was her name. </B>
<P><B>After awhile the smell didn't go away and my mom left </B>
<P><B>the room to go get her mother who was upstairs. When </B>
<P><B>she left the room she could no longer smell the roses. </B>
<P><B>Freeking out she ran up to her mother and when she got </B>
<P><B>in the room with her her mother was white as a ghost </B>
<P><B>and all she could smell was roses! It was only in </B>
<P><B>those two parts of the house. The thing is the room my </B>
<P><B>grandma was in used to be Roses room! and the living </B>
<P><B>room was her favorite place to read! They decided it </B>
<P><B>was Rose telling them she was Ok after a few days the </B>
<P><B>smell decided to dissipate. Oh! one more short one. A </B>
<P><B>few days before my parents wedding my mom was looking </B>
<P><B>at a picture of her grandma Rose, When the picture was </B>
<P><B>originally taken she had a half-smile on her face but </B>
<P><B>when my mother was looking at it the smile was huge </B>
<P><B>and she could see her teeth! It was the only picture </B>
<P><B>they had of her since she hated having her picture </B>
<P><B>taken. There was no mistake, she checked with everyone </B>
<P><B>they all agreed the smile was bigger! Thanks for </B>
<P><B>hanging on with me. I have more stories but will tell </B>
<P><B>them another time. </B>

<H3><B><A NAME=bill>Restaurant Bill </A></B>
</H3><P><B>By: LitaAnn@webtv.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>I have been bar manager at a local restaurant  in our victorian
tourist</B>
<P><B>town for almost six years. In this time I  seemed to have made a
friend</B>
<P><B>whom I have never actually met. I named him        Bill.  Three
months</B>
<P><B>after I  started working        there the restaurant sold, this is
when</B>
<P><B>several things began to happen.  We use to have wooden slats behind
the</B>
<P><B>bar to walk on which were around three inches off the floor, this was</B>
<P><B>much easier on the feet rather than the concrete below it.  One
evenig</B>
<P><B>after I  closed and everything was locked up tight , I stood behind
the</B>
<P><B>bar finishing up dishes, I  heard the swinging door open behind me,
I</B>
<P><B>assumed it was the boss coming back for somethig, then I felt the
boards</B>
<P><B>moving under my feet just like they would if someone were walking on</B>
<P><B>them, I  was turning around saying my bosses name at the same time,
and</B>
<P><B>no one was there.  Cold chills coverd me,  and it startled me but I</B>
<P><B>shook it off ,although I was eager to leave.  I nthe weeks to follow</B>
<P><B>would come in the bar to find all the ashtays turned upside down,
dishes</B>
<P><B>banging in the kitchen when the restaurant side  was closed,cold
chills</B>
<P><B>running all over me when you least expect it. Tme passed and the
owner</B>
<P><B>decided to lease the bar out to a couple, without my knowledg of it.</B>
<P><B>Basically , I had worked there two years came to work and had no job.</B>
<P><B>I left in tears extremely  upset.  What is so strange about this is
the</B>
<P><B>couple only kept the bar two weeks.  I found out later , when the</B>
<P><B>womanwas closing one night and had her keys in hand to leave she said</B>
<P><B>she heard and felt hard, heavy runing coming right at her, again no
one</B>
<P><B>was there. She said sh never beleived in ghosts and was always a
skeptic</B>
<P><B>until this happened to her.  The other employees  told me Bill the
ghost</B>
<P><B>knew they had done me dirty   and wanted them out.  When they left
I</B>
<P><B>returned back to work about five months later.  Then  things would</B>
<P><B>happen in spurts.  I heard music playing in the kitchen from what</B>
<P><B>sounded like the 1920 or 1930s period. The restaurant was closed and
I</B>
<P><B>checked the stereo system which was off.  The othe employees would
hve</B>
<P><B>things happen to them as well.  One of the girls was in the restroom</B>
<P><B>when the toilet paper roll in the next stall started unrolling by</B>
<P><B>itself, no one else was in the restroom.  Another girl came out of
the</B>
<P><B>restroom one night and had a blank  look on her face, I asked her
what</B>
<P><B>was wrong, she said someone said her name in the bathroom and no one
was</B>
<P><B>there. She was  obviously upset about this.  She would not go back
in</B>
<P><B>that bathroom unless someone went with her.   Silverware would be
moved</B>
<P><B>from one table to another after it was just setup.  We found out the</B>
<P><B>restaurant was going t sell again. This time all hell broke loose.</B>
<P><B>Glasses were seen flying off the shelves, coffee pots turned upside
down</B>
<P><B>on the counter, two of the employees said they seen an apparition on
two</B>
<P><B>separate occasions.   I beleive he actually followed me home one night
,</B>
<P><B>I woke up at four o clock in the morning    wide awake,when I
realized</B>
<P><B>what time it was I went back to bed. I had not been in bed more than
two</B>
<P><B>minutes when a hard thump hit right between myfeet at the foot of my</B>
<P><B>bed.  I KNEW SOMEONE WAS THERE.  My dog went nuts.     I happen to
live</B>
<P><B>on the same property near this restaurant. The next day I called in
a</B>
<P><B>local tarot card reader to the restauraunt.  She said he was very
upset</B>
<P><B>about the change of new owners coming in .  She did smething with the</B>
<P><B>cards as kind of a help gesture for our ghost.      Since she did it
has</B>
<P><B>been relatively peaceful.           </B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Hi.  I am new to this sort of thing and I am not one to delve into
the supernatural,</B>
<P><B> but I would like to share my story with you because it truly has made
me think twice </B>
<P><B>about the spirit world.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>About two years ago my parents were sitting in our family room when
they both heard </B>
<P><B>a loud crash as if a large upstairs window had broken and landed on
the outside </B>
<P><B>driveway.  My father rushed upstairs to see if my grandfather (who
was ill and </B>
<P><B>living with us) had fallen out the window.  My mother heard the crash
too. After</B>
<P><B> discovering my grandfater still sleeping and everything was ok, they
began to </B>
<P><B>look outside for anything out of the ordinary.  Everything outside
was still.  </B>
<P><B>It was just a mystery they wouldn't be able to solve.  </B>
<P><B>About 6 months later, again the loud crash.  The same crash.  Again
everything</B>
<P><B> calm.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Now, I have become aware of the mysterious sounds.  I live in another
city, </B>
<P><B>but over the holidays I was at home and heard a mysterious noise. 
It started </B>
<P><B>when I was upstairs dismantling my Christmas tree in my room.  I heard
my mother </B>
<P><B>running the vacuum downstairs.  I kept on working not thinking anything
of the </B>
<P><B>vacuum sound.  A few minutes passed and I went downstairs and said
something about</B>
<P><B> my mother vacuuming the floor.  She responded by saying she thought
I was running </B>
<P><B>the vacuum upstairs!  We both heard the vacuum running but neither
one of us had it!    </B>
<P><B>Sincerely,</B>

</H3><P><B>By:  JESTERDUI@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi I'm 14 yrs old and I'm pretty sure I had a ghost experience.....Well
it</B>
<P><B>happened only twice when I was there. It was last Sept. or Oct. when
 My friend</B>
<P><B>and I were bike riding in a graveyard near my house, it has a few trails
in</B>
<P><B>the forest area that we go on, but theres a place we go to just hang
out and</B>
<P><B>like swing off this long rope tied to a tree.  Well we're sitting down
on this</B>
<P><B>ledge where there used to be a pond and we were talking, then we started
hearing</B>
<P><B>these sounds like branches snapping, right, so we just thought it was
like a</B>
<P><B>squirrel or something, right, so we kept talking and we heard these
leaves</B>
<P><B>crunching like foot steps. So I stood up to see who was coming, but
when I stood</B>
<P><B>up I couldn't see anyone and I like knew there wasn't anyone there
cause all</B>
<P><B>the leaves were off the trees. So I asked my friend if he heard it
too and he</B>
<P><B>said yeah but it had stopped by then so I couldn't tell exactly where
it was</B>
<P><B>coming from, so I sat back down and a couple of seconds later it started
again</B>
<P><B>it sounded closer now. So I jumped quickly to see who was there, it
didn't</B>
<P><B>stop this time and it kept coming closer. It started to move a little
faster</B>
<P><B>so we both were standing  looking to see if it was some kid playing
a joke so</B>
<P><B>we were still looking, we could see right to the other side of the
forest.</B>
<P><B>It's not a really thick area and all the leaves were on the ground
so I was</B>
<P><B>joking around with my friend and said oh I'd laugh if it was ghost
and he</B>
<P><B>started to get a little scared after I said that so he was like
heading</B>
<P><B>towards the begining of the trail and I was calling him, as he turned
around we</B>
<P><B>both saw where the sound was coming from, it looked like foot steps
kicking</B>
<P><B>the leaves as it headed towards us. As soon as we saw that we started
running. My</B>
<P><B>friend ran all the way out and grabbed his bike at the entrance and
took off I</B>
<P><B>stopped half way to see if I could see it again but there was nothing
there</B>
<P><B>so I caught up with my friend and left............This happened a second
time</B>
<P><B>but I didn't stick around as long....and I know it wasn't the wind
if thats</B>
<P><B>what your thinking cause it was a calm day out.....Oh well tell me
what you</B>
<P><B>think thanx c-ya</B>

</H3><P><B>By:  caine@ecol.net</B>
<P>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>First, before I tell this story I need to explain that a number of
minor</B>
<P><B>odd incidences occurred in our family home just as they do to many</B>
<P><B>persons who have submitted stories. I do not feel that we had </B>
<P><B>a'resident' ghost as such; rather, it was more like random </B>
<P><B>visitsfrom spirits which were just 'passing through' whenever my twin
</B>
<P><B>sister and I would hear disembodied voices or experience anything </B>
<P><B>else of an unusual nature. My father was the only other person in the</B>
<P><B>family who admitted seeing a ghost when he was very young, my </B>
<P><B>younger sister, brother, and mother weren't at all interested </B>
<P><B>in focusing on such a subject and it's doubtful they would have </B>
<P><B>ever listened if we tried to share our experiences with them, at </B>
<P><B>least</B> <B>not then.</B> &nbsp;<B>This particular set of ocurrances
took place after our family </B>
<P><B>had split up due to my parents' divorce, and our younger sister </B>
<P><B>and older brother had both married and left home, leaving just </B>
<P><B>myself,my twin sister, and our mother in a place by </B>
<P><B>ourselves.</B> <B>My sister and I shared a bedroom with twin beds.
At that </B>
<P><B>timeI had been collecting china teacups, some antique, some not, </B>
<P><B>and had about nine of them displayed in a wooden </B>
<P><B>3-shelved</B> <B>display rack which was hung on the wall right above
my bed. </B>
<P><B>I</B> <B>enjoyed arranging and changed the cups occasionally since
</B>
<P><B>I</B> <B>had more cups collected than I could display all at </B>
<P><B>once.</B> &nbsp;<B>I was lying in bed one night and was beginning to
drowse</B>
<P><B>but was not asleep yet, when I suddenly 'felt' a presence</B>
<P><B>of two female spirits floating above me looking at my teacups.</B>
<P><B>They didn't seem to pay any attention to me or anything else</B>
<P><B>in the room, they just spoke to each other. The conversation</B>
<P><B>was as follows: "Oh, look at that!"(One of the </B>
<P><B>spirits) "Oh, isn't it cute?!!"(The other spirit). The emphasis on
the </B>
<P><B>word</B> <B>'cute' was such that it went up several octaves and turned
</B>
<P><B>into a very loud, girlish shriek of admiration which rudely </B>
<P><B>snapped</B> <B>me out of getting to sleep at that moment. "Thanks a
</B>
<P><B>whole lot" I muttered, but by that time I no longer felt their </B>
<P><B>presence.</B> &nbsp; <B>The rest of the night was uneventful and I
managed to get </B>
<P><B>my</B> <B>sleep soon after.</B> <B>The other part of the story took
place not too long after, if </B>
<P><B>I can</B> <B>recall correctly. I remember entering my bedroom one
afternoon</B>
<P><B>and found my wooden display rack lying on my pillow with the</B>
<P><B>teacups sitting neatly arranged, on the bedspread below it. </B>
<P><B>Now,</B> <B>I grew up in California where earthquakes were just about
</B>
<P><B>an everyday ocurrance, but that sort of shaking would have simply</B>
<P><B>spilled the rack and its contents randomly over the bed and onto</B>
<P><B>the floor if it had been strong enough to knock things off the wall.</B>
<P><B>And there had been no such earthquake activity that day. </B>
<P><B>Thinking my mother might have been in our room dusting and perhaps
</B>
<P><B>left the rack and cups on my bed, I called down the stairs and </B>
<P><B>asked her if she had been in there. To which she replied </B>
<P><B>no. &nbsp;My twin was not at home at the time.</B>
<P><B>What else could I do? I replaced my collection back up on the</B>
<P><B>wall. They were never bothered in that manner again. I still wonder</B>
<P><B>to this day who found them so interesting, and why did they take</B>
<P><B>the whole display down and spread it over my bed? It genuinely</B>
<P>p<B>uzzles me! Hope you enjoyed my story. </B>
<P><B>Thanks.</B>

<H3><H3><B><A NAME=two>Two States -Two Experiences</A></B>
</H3></H3><P><B>By: Suprmom22@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>We have now had two experiences with ghosts. The first time was in
 Kentucky.</B>
<P><B>we lived in an apartment.   It started about 3 months after I became
pregnant</B>
<P><B>with my first child.  I would be standing at the sink and feel a tug
on the</B>
<P><B>back of my shirt  or the lights would flicker every now and then. I
blew it</B>
<P><B>off thinking it was probably nothing.  Then I started hearing distinct
foot</B>
<P><B>steps.  Sometimes up stairs, sometimes coming down the stairs. I was
the only</B>
<P><B>one in the house at the time.</B>
<P><B>A short time later we got a dog .   I noticed no matter how much you
begged it</B>
<P><B>the dog would not go in our spare bedroom.  This room was always
noticably</B>
<P><B>cooler than the other rooms in the house.  One night I walked in to
the spare</B>
<P><B>room there was  an ink pen laying on the dresser and it started spinning
in</B>
<P><B>circles. That's when it really began.</B>
<P><B>At night I would be awakened by noises.(our room was right next to
it.)  I</B>
<P><B>would here someone walk across the floor and come right up to me...yet
noone</B>
<P><B>was there. ( we had hard wood floors so foot steps were easy to
hear.)</B>
<P><B>One day as I was in the kitchen peeling potatoes,the coffee maker came
on .(</B>
<P><B>it wasn't plugged in).  The knife that I had been using was laying
about 4 ft.</B>
<P><B>from me and started sliding across the counter at me.   One night as
me and my</B>
<P><B>husband were sitting in the living room I felt my hair being pulled.
 Next "it</B>
<P><B>" pulled a handfull right from the top of my head and dropped it on
the floor</B>
<P><B>in front of me. </B>
<P><B>I would feel someone touch me as I was in the shower but my husband
would be</B>
<P><B>at work and there was noone else in the house.  Then I started having
dreams.</B>
<P><B>they were   about a man. He had red eyes and was sitting behind a
candle</B>
<P><B>flame.  I would once and a while catch a glimps of a newspaper but
couldn't</B>
<P><B>read the headline.  I would hear a woman named Julie talk to me.  She
would</B>
<P><B>warn me to go.  That I was in danger.  She was always very sad.
 Sometimes</B>
<P><B>crying.    After several weeks I dreamed more and more sometimes unable
to</B>
<P><B>wake up  easily in the morning.the dog would have unexplainable
barking</B>
<P><B>spells.(as if it saw someone). I figured out that the man in my dreams
(our</B>
<P><B>ghost )  had killed his wife (julie)  after she had lost their baby.
 this was</B>
<P><B>the headline in the newspaper. Evendently because I was pregnant "he"
didn't</B>
<P><B>want me to have a child either.   I was given a cross that had been
blessed by</B>
<P><B>a priest and the hair pulling and touching stopped.  The noise in the
spare</B>
<P><B>room however didn't.  One night when we new it was in the room we closed
the</B>
<P><B>door and hung a cross on the door knob.  It evedently trapped it there.
 Ihe</B>
<P><B>noise was so bad at times we ended up sleeping downstairs on the floor
. later</B>
<P><B>my husband went in the room burned some sulpher after opening the window.
 I</B>
<P><B>heard screaming from clear down stairs and it left.  all was normal.(
my</B>
<P><B>husband also has the ability to feel the presence of a spirit)</B>
<P><B>The second time was in Colorado .   Actually just a few days ago.
 About</B>
<P><B>November I started catching a glimps of something out ofthe corner
of my eye.</B>
<P><B>I figured maybe it was my daughter who is now 3.  She is always on
the move.</B>
<P><B>We left for vacation on the 17 th of December.  We were gone for 15
days.</B>
<P><B>When we returned my daughter would say she had been in her room playing
with a</B>
<P><B>little boy. I assumed it was her boy baby doll or an imaginary friend.
A  few</B>
<P><B>nights ago she had been in bed for about a half an hour.  She came
out of her</B>
<P><B>room screaming and was white as a sheet. she said that there was a
boy ghost</B>
<P><B>in her room and it was getting in to her bed. It had told her it was
mad she</B>
<P><B>left for so long. I  walked right in her room  hoping to prove her
otherwise.</B>
<P><B>I  walked around the corner and there was this little boy appearring
to be</B>
<P><B>maybe 3 yrs old or so,  standing in front of my daughters closet. It
made the</B>
<P><B>awfullest face and was dripping wet.  My first reaction was to throw
things at</B>
<P><B>it.   BIG MISTAKE. that just made it mad . It dissappeared and my husband
came</B>
<P><B>in.  We exited the room and my husband came in the living room and
sat down at</B>
<P><B>the computer.  He got an uneasy feeling and the hairs on his neck and
arms</B>
<P><B>were standing straight up.( he said o.k. it's here beside me).  My
daughter</B>
<P><B>was shaking and let me tell you I was not far from a nervous break
down.</B>
<P><B>It continued to bang on the walls, scream and move things in my
daughters</B>
<P><B>room.  My husband hung a cross from a string right in the doorway after
it</B>
<P><B>went back in her rrom and it didn't come out.  That night I didn't
get much</B>
<P><B>sleep . Between my 3 yr. old and 10 mo. old waking up screaming and
all the</B>
<P><B>noise in my daughters room it was rather nerve racking.</B>
<P><B>The next day it screamed louder than any child I have ever heard.
 Someone</B>
<P><B>told me to confront it and talk to it and ask it who it was and what
it wanted</B>
<P><B>and then ask it to leave.  It just appeared to pout.  I started questioning
my</B>
<P><B>daughter about it. Asking if she had seen it before she said "oh yes!""
He</B>
<P><B>plays with me sometimes and tries to sleep in my bed at night."   she
said</B>
<P><B>that he got mad when she wouldn't let it in her bed and it scared her.
Which</B>
<P><B>in turn made her come out screaming. she told me that it had taken
some of her</B>
<P><B>toys and she couldn't find them. Anyway my mother in law sent me a
little poem</B>
<P><B>to say and said to put bay leaves in the 4 corners of the house to
keep it out</B>
<P><B>when it was gone.  The poem involved putting a drop of olive oil in
the door</B>
<P><B>frame and saying  that by the power of god we want all evil banished
from</B>
<P><B>here.   Haven't heard it since. Found my daughter's toys in the top
of her</B>
<P><B>closet.  </B>

<H3><B><A NAME=board>Ouija Board Nightmare</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By: JelloChici@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My house had always been a place of comfort for me. l always felt safe
there.</B>
<P><B>l never thought l'd see the day, l was scared of my own room.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When l first noticed the hot and cold spots in my room l didnt think
anything</B>
<P><B>of it. The day before they started l'd brought a oujia board in my
room to try</B>
<P><B>and "contact" ghosts. The thing did move, but l was convinced it was
because</B>
<P><B>one of my believer friends wanted to change my mind about ghost being
a bunch</B>
<P><B>of hooey. At the moment l was scared. Not of the board which l heard
could</B>
<P><B>wreak havioc on my house...but my mother if she knew what l was doing.
She'd</B>
<P><B>kill me if she knew l'd let my friends bring it over! Anyways, the
experience</B>
<P><B>went by pretty uneventfully until one of my friends asked if there
was a</B>
<P><B>ghosty in my house. The pointer move towards yes and stopped there.
They</B>
<P><B>contiued to ask questions until they heard a loud BANG from
downstairs.</B>
<P><B>Everyone screamed , including me. l grabbed the board , shoved it in
it's box</B>
<P><B>and flung it across the room. l knew it was only my mom, but l didnt
want to</B>
<P><B>get caught with the board. My friends all told me what a dumb move
it was. If</B>
<P><B>only l'd listened to them!</B>
<P>
<P><B>	The day after my little "experience" l began to notice hot and cold
spots in</B>
<P><B>my room. lt bugged me, because no matter what l did my room would be
too hot</B>
<P><B>in some places and to cold in others. l heard creaks and moans, and
just</B>
<P><B>assumed it was the neighbors. But when l heard dry, hoarse whispering
voices</B>
<P><B>calling my name , that was enough. l walked into my brothers room only
to find</B>
<P><B>him fast alseep. Puzzled l walked back down the stairs and into my
room. When</B>
<P><B>l returned l had someone to greet me. A large swirling black mist was
in my</B>
<P><B>room! l rubbed my eys and looked again and saw...nothing. l sighed.
My freaky</B>
<P><B>friends were wearing off on me! l looked in my room and found a large
black</B>
<P><B>mark that looked like some kind of picture. l glanced more closely
and gasped.</B>
<P><B>It was a picture that looked like some kind of a demon! Terrified l
backed</B>
<P><B>aways from the wall and fell on my bed. l knew something went wrong
. The next</B>
<P><B>morning l called my friends and told them what had happened. They agreed
to</B>
<P><B>help me,  after they said one little phrase... l told you so! We planned
to</B>
<P><B>use the ouija board, one last time.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We were all nervous when we began to ask questions. Finally we got
into</B>
<P><B>action. We asked whatever it was to please leave. We told it we never
meant</B>
<P><B>for it to come. There was another loud crash and a rumble, and it was
gone. To</B>
<P><B>this day l hear things once in a while, but l'm no longer haunted by
the ghost</B>
<P><B>in my room.</B>

<P>
<P><B>  I started a new job as a special patrolmen in a large building. I
patrol the</B>
<P><B>building at night form 4pm to midnight. The first six months it was
quiet. We</B>
<P><B>check the floors with a flash lights. One nIght I took a meal break
at 8pm, I</B>
<P><B>went to the second floor medical lunch room. It over looks the
medical</B>
<P><B>clerical dept.</B>
<P><B> I walk into the lunch room and one of the porters was eating his meal.
As</B>
<P><B> I walk to one of the tables in the room. I looked up and saw a small
women</B>
<P><B>walking across the doorway. I walk to the doorway to check . The building
was</B>
<P><B>closed and no one should be in the building without security knowing.
The</B>
<P><B>lights were off. I walk into the room and walked though,  their was
no one</B>
<P><B>there. I went back to the lunch room to eat. As I was eating the porter
in the</B>
<P><B>room was sitting across from me , we talked and then he said "Wow,
it feel like someone pushed</B>
<P><B>my chair in." We laugh  and he said "Their must be a ghost in here."</B>
<P><B>We finished meal break and went back to work. Around 11pm my sargent
told me</B>
<P><B>to give the final check of the medical floor. I went up to the floor
the lights</B>
<P><B>were out. I walked into the lunch area it was freezing, but the heat
was on. I</B>
<P><B>note it in my book. Then I walk into the clerical dept. it also was
cold.I</B>
<P><B>walked through</B> <B>and a window was open and a radio on one of the
desk was on. It was playing a</B>
<P><B>disco song. I closed the window andturned off the radio. I radio my
sargent on my walky</B>
<P><B>talky to find out if anyone was on the floor ,after I checked it the
first</B>
<P><B>time. He told me "No one was on that floor, after you took your meal
up</B>
<P><B>there." I was think to myself " Who opened that window and put the
radio on ?" </B>
<P><B>    I had to finish checking the floor. I walked into the waiting area
and the</B>
<P><B>windows were opened and the cushions of the couch was on the floor.
I closed the</B>
<P><B>windows and pick up the cushions. I walk through the doctors offices.
I walk</B>
<P><B>into the X-ray room as I was walking out the X-ray machine started
moving side</B>
<P><B>by side I radio my sargent to ask how to shut it off. He said "I'll
be right</B>
<P><B>there,wait there." The machine stop moving. My sargent walked into
the room.</B>
<P><B>He check the power on the machine and it was off. He then check the
main power</B>
<P><B>source and it was off. I walked out of the room. My sargent told me
"alot of</B>
<P><B>strange things are happening in this place." Then he said " maybe,
its a</B>
<P><B>ghost"   I went to finish the floor and the sargent left. I went into
the lab</B>
<P><B>area all the doors were   open, they should be locked and closed. I
then went</B>
<P><B>to the Examining rooms the windows were open, these windows are shut
and lock</B>
<P><B>everday. I finished the floor and went to the elevator and I waited.
As I</B>
<P><B>waited I saw the figure of a women walking by the medical entrance.
I went</B>
<P><B>back into the medical dept. to take a look. I called out "Anyone here."
I herd</B>
<P><B>someone call back "Sharah." It was a women voice.I call back " Where
are you?</B>
<P><B>No one should be in here. Do you need help? Can I help you? Where are
you?" No</B>
<P><B>one answered me again. I radio for back up. My sargent and another
security</B>
<P><B>guard come to help. We walked the floor and found windows open ,again.
The</B>
<P><B>same ones I closed before. Their was no one there. We locked the floor
off ,</B>
<P><B>noted everthing that happen and went home. </B>
<P><B>      The next night everyone that worked nights had a story about
something</B>
<P><B>strange that happened to them on that same floor. I still don't know
who</B>
<P><B>Sharah</B> <B>is.</B>

</H3><P><B>By:   k_69mustang@hotmail.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>It was October 24, 1997, and my best friend was sleeping over at my
</B>
<P><B>house. We decided to hold a seance. We went to this hill in my </B>
<P><B>neighborhood. This hill is very steep and dark. We put our hands </B>
<P><B>together and raised them towards the dripping wet sky (it was raining).
</B>
<P><B>Anyway, she started to talk to her "lord". We were trying to bring
back </B>
<P><B>my deceased grandmother. We opened our eyes and started "talking" to
</B>
<P><B>her, trying to get her to talk back. It didn't work. But a few minutes
</B>
<P><B>later, my friend collapsed onto the wet ground. I kept telling her
to </B>
<P><B>get up, cuz I thought she was just playing around. I left to start
</B>
<P><B>walking home. After a while, I turned around and she was running towrds
</B>
<P><B>me. She ran right past me and to my house. She was standing outside
by </B>
<P><B>the time I got there. I calmed her down and asked her to tell me what
</B>
<P><B>had happened. She said that when she collapsed, she was there </B>
<P><B>physically, but not mentally. She heard everything I was saying to
her, </B>
<P><B>but she couldn't do anything. She told me she "saw" a beautiful angel
of </B>
<P><B>some sort with six wings; two on his feet, two on his back, and two
on </B>
<P><B>his head. She also saw my grandmother with birds flying all around
her. </B>
<P><B>When she looked at the angel, she saw everybody in the world, but they
</B>
<P><B>were frozen. When she finally was able to get up, she started walking
up </B>
<P><B>the hill, she turned around and saw ice everywhere. That was when she
</B>
<P><B>started running. We then saw a car coming down the road and she jumped
</B>
<P><B>in front of it. I pulled her to the sidewalk just in time. She was
</B>
<P><B>trying to kill herself! I couldn't believe it. So far, I hadn't believed
</B>
<P><B>anything she was telling me. I finally realized how serious she was
and </B>
<P><B>started believing. But then she remembered that in the Bible, it says
</B>
<P><B>that Satan has six wings. We're not entirely sure about that though.
For </B>
<P><B>some odd reason, she started running after the car. She stopped. She
saw </B>
<P><B>the same angel coming towards her. She told me to run but I wasn't
about </B>
<P><B>to leave her there. I grabbed her hand and ran! We were safe in my
room </B>
<P><B>but still pretty shooken up. I told her to change her clothes then
call </B>
<P><B>her boyfriend for comfort, so she did. He thinks she's crazy now. That's
</B>
<P><B>just about all that happened. But it was totally scary!</B>
<P>
<P><B>P.S. If you have any explanaton of what this whole thing was about,
</B>
<P><B>please let me know. Thanx!!</B>
