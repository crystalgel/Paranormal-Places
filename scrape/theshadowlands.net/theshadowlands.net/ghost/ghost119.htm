<b>Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: TnFirecracker@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When I was a small child. age five. My mom and I were in the kitchen.
She was</b>
<br><b>putting the things&nbsp; she had bought from the store. She had
sat them on the</b>
<br><b>table and I was sitting on the bench by the table when I felt hands
on my</b>
<br><b>side push me off. I fell to the floor. and was not able to catch
myself. My</b>
<br><b>mom was shocked. She asked me why I feel to the floor like that.
And I told</b>
<br><b>her that something pushed me off. She laughed.but to this day I
can still</b>
<br><b>remember those hands touching me. But not able to see them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Here's</b>
<br><b>another one. In that same house at night after everyone had gone
to bed. I</b>
<br><b>would be laying in bed and I would here foot steps coming down the
hall.</b>
<br><b>starting from way off. Then the sound stoped in front of my door.
It was dark</b>
<br><b>but I could see this shadow standing there watching me.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Her's another one.</b>
<br><b>later in life when I was grown. My mom lived in this house that
had ghost in</b>
<br><b>it that would make it's self sound like the people that were living
there.</b>
<br><b>one time my mom and dad left to go somewhere and I was left there
alone. I</b>
<br><b>didn't know I was alone . I was taking a shower when it seemed that
someone</b>
<br><b>was watching me. So when I got out I thought I heard my dad coughing
and</b>
<br><b>walking around in another room. but when I went out there know one
was there.</b>
<br><b>So I went outside to see if my dad had went outside. My mom and
dad drove up.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Another time the ghost in that house did it again to my husband.
He went</b>
<br><b>there after work looking for me. He knocked on the door and thought
he heard</b>
<br><b>my dad walking around inside. But know one came to the door. later
I told my</b>
<br><b>dad that my husband had came by and that he knocked and heard him
inside. But</b>
<br><b>couldn't get him to open the door. He told me that he had been gone
with my</b>
<br><b>mom.&nbsp; Another story about that same house. My brother used
to sleep up stairs</b>
<br><b>in this house. The light switch was at the bottom of the stairs.
He said at</b>
<br><b>night when he was trying to sleep his light would go on and off
by it's self.</b>
<br><b>then he would wake up and could feel someone breathing on him in
the dark. He</b>
<br><b>started sleeping on the couch down stairs. While my mom and dad
were living</b>
<br><b>there with my brother lots of weird things went on. My dad had two
heart</b>
<br><b>attacks my brother almost got run over in front of the house when
he was</b>
<br><b>riding on a dirt bike. My husband had a motorcycle wreck down the
road from</b>
<br><b>the house on his way to me up. My mom saw a light float down from
under the</b>
<br><b>stairs of where her bedroom was and then go into a light that was
turned off.</b>
<br><b>She said it made the light glow like it was on. My son was almost
trampled to</b>
<br><b>death by cow in and feild across the street from the house. My pet
squirrel</b>
<br><b>died after taking it into that house. At the top of that house there
was a</b>
<br><b>large round burnt spot toward the top peek of the house.my parents
moved out</b>
<br><b>of that house. But we will never forget it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another
time and place I had</b>
<br><b>found a horse shoe in an old gravel road. Later on not sure how
long but. One</b>
<br><b>night my husband and i were both awake when we both heard this strange
noise</b>
<br><b>that sounded like it was off in the distants coming our way. Getting
louder</b>
<br><b>as it got closer it was a moaning sound like the sound you would
think of as</b>
<br><b>a ghost. like the sound you make when your trying to be a ghost
for a joke</b>
<br><b>but this sound was different cause it went right through you . Chilling
your</b>
<br><b>whole body. So that you couldn't move. We looked at each other then
my</b>
<br><b>husband got the nerve to get up and go to the window and open the
curtian to</b>
<br><b>look out to see what it was. But when he did the sound stoped and
nothing was</b>
<br><b>there. but it came back other times. but not as close. We got a
tape recorder</b>
<br><b>and was going to try to record it one night. But it never came back
after we</b>
<br><b>did that. weird. Well these were true storys thats happened to me
and my</b>
<br><b>family. Hope you enjoy them. email me back and let me know what
you thought</b>
<br><b>of them.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Maybe Evil Does Lurk Around Every Corner</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jameshaggerty@sprintmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What happened to me is considerably freaky, not
knowing what you want or believe, but life can shock you!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What happened to me was a series of events that
took place from the summer of '98 through December of that year.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Though I didn't know it yet, my courage and dignity were about to hit rock
bottom because of my frame of mind,(or in other words, I'm stubborn!)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back to my story:&nbsp; My brother-in-law's neice,
who I thought was out to get me,(she is almost as stubborn as I am ,) anyway,&nbsp;
She and I were in my sisters living room you know doing the girl thing,
designing clothing, etc, when we felt like we were being watched.&nbsp;
I felt like something was really wrong.&nbsp; I had had no previous experiance
with the supernatural, so what was I to think?&nbsp; My sisters house was
only four years old, and the guy who previously owned the house was nice!&nbsp;
Anyway, back to the story!&nbsp; Britney started crying saying I have to
go get my cross, which was in the bedroom closest to us.&nbsp; For some
reason one corner really upset me.&nbsp; We went and got her cross and
I sat down in the black chair by the computer desk.&nbsp; All of a sudden,
I couldn't breathe and I felt pressure on my chest.&nbsp; I felt so miserable,
like I had just lost someone, or like I hadn't eaten, or weird like that.&nbsp;
I ran into my sisters room, next to the room with the cross, and I could
not stop crying.&nbsp; I was crying so loud, and I couldn't breathe; I
was trying to take in gulps of air between sobs!&nbsp; She kicked me out,
and we both slept on the couch uncomfortably and I just would not move
my neck; I was all stiff like something would get me if I moved!&nbsp;
That was when I was eleven!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After I turned twelve in September:&nbsp; Sometime
around late October, Early November of that year my uncle got diagnosed
(sp) with Lung Cancer after a series of tests on a tumor.&nbsp; This could
sound so strange, but they found out that he had had Cancer for about ten
years.&nbsp; The strange part was that he had a heart attack five years
prior to the diagnosis.&nbsp; Why they didn't find it sooner, I don't know!&nbsp;
After we found out my cousins and I started going to Church.&nbsp; I got
Saved and Baptised.&nbsp; Then my friend started acting weird and got really
scared of a spirit that she welcomed into her life with the ouiji board.&nbsp;
He would sometimes play games with her mind, like turning the room red,
or showing up in her mirror.&nbsp; When I started to help her he even threatened
me.&nbsp; I said whatever you are gonna do, go right ahead and do it, thus
welcoming him into my life!&nbsp; Teachers wouldn't do anything, my parents
thought that I was crazy; what was I supposed to do?</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day a couple of weeks later, I was doing
my homework in my parents room.&nbsp; In their room, they have a large
mirror behind their bed.&nbsp; I turned around to look in the mirror, and
their was a little boy standing behind me looking down at me.&nbsp; That
scared me, but he looked like a curious little boy, he didn't want to hurt
me.&nbsp; He could have been an angel for all I know.&nbsp; I saw him one
more time in my living room.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know how long after that it was, but
I got so mad at God (which now I regret,) but I challenged the Devil that
I'm not scared of you, come and scare me, see what I care!&nbsp; A couple
of days later,&nbsp; I walked into my living room and felt somethin, I
didn't know what, but something.&nbsp; I looked up, and there was a black
hooded figure.&nbsp; I said, and I quote, "Jesus Christ!"&nbsp; That thing
was gone at the sound of that name!&nbsp; I knew that it wasn't there to
hurt me, but, he was there to scare me.&nbsp; It seemed as though you&nbsp;
could almost see the grin, or you feel it.&nbsp; Before this, sometimes
I would get images in my head of black "things" following me in formation.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though it tore us all apart, I think that
my uncle's death happened for a reason.&nbsp; I will never question God's
motives, because I don't have all of the answers, and why would I go back
to doing the things I did before?&nbsp; I don't really see things anymore,
but I do feel uneasy in my new "home!"&nbsp; Through all of this, which
was really complicated, I never once felt like I was letting anyone down,
but myself.&nbsp; When I felt forgiven, I could finally forgive myself!</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Tall Closet</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: khsbandgeek@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I was at my friend, Jessie, birthday party and a few of us decided
to sit in</b>
<br><b>a circle and talk. Well, somehow we got onto the subject of Ghosts
and the</b>
<br><b>one that sticks in my mind was told by my friend Breanne.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Her mom and her were going to buy a new house, becasue
the one they live</b>
<br><b>in now is haunted (go figure. Her mom and her met with the real
estate agent</b>
<br><b>and got a tour of their 'new house'. Breanne recalls one closet
in the house</b>
<br><b>that had corkboard top to bottom. The closet was seven feet in height,
no</b>
<br><b>shelves in the whole closet, there were claw marks from top to bottom
on the</b>
<br><b>right hand side of the closet. The people who lived there before
had a dog,</b>
<br><b>but no dog could have made claw marks seven feet tall! Breanne exited
the</b>
<br><b>room and walked down the hall to where teh kitchen was and looked
around.</b>
<br><b>She was startled by the kitchen foset suddenly turning on. She put
her hand</b>
<br><b>under the water and found that the water didn't have a&nbsp; temperature.
She</b>
<br><b>calmly walked back to her mother and found that her mother was in
the room</b>
<br><b>with the claw marks descending the corkboard. Her mother gave her
a look of</b>
<br><b>fear and told the real estate lady they would consider her offer
and the</b>
<br><b>left the house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breanne had other stories that are spine tingeling,
along with my</b>
<br><b>friends, Adam, Shawnee, and myself. We've all had ghostly encounters.

<p><b>My Grandmothers Ghost</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: jessica@inebraska.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hey my name&nbsp; is Quentin, and I cant prove or disprove this story
its just something my grandma told me so here goes. To start my grandparents
are very religious and believe that you should watch what you say because
it may come true, that's how it started. When something would get broken
or something would happen, they would ask their kids who did it, but every
kid proclaimed innocence. so they would say that it must of been our ghost.........
and give it a name. well one morning he showed up, sitting on the foot
of my grandmother's bed. at first nothing happened, but then things started.
the heat would be turned way up and the gas on the stove was turned on
but not the fire. one day a guest of my grandmothers was over and said,
jokingly, that if my grandmother ever got rid of the ghost to send to her
house. well my grandmother got tired of it and grabbed the oil and blessed
the house, as is custom in our religion. and well the ghost was gone, but
the weird part is that the woman who asked my grandmother to send it over,
her house burnt down a week later and she barely got her kids out alive.
I cant prove this and my grandmother still lives in the same house and
neither she nor I have seen anything strange since. but it makes you think...........
better watch what you say..........!</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: EmpressLeah21069@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>You probably hear from many people who say they don't believe in
ghosts. I am</b>
<br><b>not an athiest or narrowminded but having never experienced anything
liket</b>
<br><b>his before, I am unsure of what to think.</b>
<br><b>My grandmother died recently, and her funeral was very trying on
all of us.</b>
<br><b>she had a slow death, having pneumonia and drowning in her own lungs.
she</b>
<br><b>fought it and was coherant until her final moment. I think there
was a lot</b>
<br><b>left unsaid.</b>
<br><b>The day I got back from her funeral was a restless one for me. I
couldn't</b>
<br><b>explain this odd uneasiness that travelled with me all the way from
her</b>
<br><b>funeral to my house 4 hours away. It was like I was being watched
or</b>
<br><b>something.</b>
<br><b>That night, I went to bed as usual. I live alone and in a small
apartment</b>
<br><b>near a college campus, so I sleep with ear plugs in because I hate
the noise</b>
<br><b>that comes from the dorms 24 hours a day. I also sleep with a face
mask on</b>
<br><b>because I hate the way the sun comes through my blinds in the morning.
The</b>
<br><b>point here is that once I am asleep- it is very hard to wake me
up.</b>
<br><b>Around two in the morning, something wole me up. I do not know what
it was</b>
<br><b>but it had to be something major because I ripped off that mask
and opened my</b>
<br><b>eyes in about a second, and like I said, with ear plugs and that
mask, no</b>
<br><b>sound or light could get me up. When I looked up, I saw this giant
mass of</b>
<br><b>glitter, looming over my bed. I later explained to friends that
it was like a</b>
<br><b>giant sparkly pretzel. It looked as though someone had taken glitter
and</b>
<br><b>thrown it in the air and it stuck in this shape. I blinked and made
sure I</b>
<br><b>was awake and then I screamed and turned on the lamp only to find
it gone. I</b>
<br><b>was shaken and scared. I know that it was not a dream because I
made sure I</b>
<br><b>was awake.</b>
<br><b>The next day, I called a friend of mine to tell her what happened
to me the</b>
<br><b>night before. She is sort of into things of this nature and I felt
sheepish</b>
<br><b>because I was always making fun of her for this. Once I was done
explaining,</b>
<br><b>she asked, "Aren't you catholic?" and I told her yes. Then she said,
"Well,</b>
<br><b>don't catholics believe in praying for the dead?" the second she
said this,</b>
<br><b>coincidence or not, the lamp beside me flickered on and off. I don't
think I</b>
<br><b>have ever moved so fast. I lit out of that house and didn't go back
until I</b>
<br><b>had someone with me.</b>
<br><b>Needless to say- I pray for my grandmother now. I know I told her
to visit</b>
<br><b>anytime, but I didn't mean after she died.</b>

<p><b>MY SHOWER STORY</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: JACamero@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hi there, I have a strange story to tell.&nbsp; If you have any ideas
or</b>
<br><b>suggestions, I would greatly appreciate them.</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is the only thing that has happened to me that is out of the
ordinary.</b>
<br><b>Maybe I should start out by saying that I am a normal, healthy and
mentally</b>
<br><b>stable person (well, as much as the next person, I guess!!!).&nbsp;
This happened</b>
<br><b>in the summer of 1994 and my boyfriend, at the time, had just moved
into a</b>
<br><b>new apartment in Lansing, Michigan a few days prior.&nbsp; This
complex had a</b>
<br><b>swimming pool and he had invited myself and my two nieces over to
go swimming.</b><b></b>
<p><b>After swimming we went up to his apartment to watch movies for a
while.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>decided I wanted to take a shower to get the chlorine off me.&nbsp;
I went into</b>
<br><b>the bathroom and locked the door (the bathroom didn't have an air
vent fan in</b>
<br><b>it, by the way).&nbsp; I turned on the water, got in and pulled
the shower curtain</b>
<br><b>shut.&nbsp; After a second the curtain batted in at me in a very
deliberate way,</b>
<br><b>it wasn't the typical flow of the shower curtain due to water pressure,
it</b>
<br><b>was just as if someone were outside and had hit it with their hand
in a</b>
<br><b>playful way.&nbsp; It wasn't where a whole section of curtain comes
in and sticks</b>
<br><b>to you, it was a very small area, a very small section of curtain
that moved</b>
<br><b>in towards me gently (and didn't touch me), at the same height like
where a</b>
<br><b>hand would be, just as if someone was on the other side playing
a game with</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; I figured my boyfriend had snuck in and was playing a
joke on me.&nbsp; So I</b>
<br><b>batted the curtain back out and it proceeded to bat right back in
again.</b>
<br><b>Then I grabbed the curtain and yanked it open real quick, expecting
to find</b>
<br><b>him out there grinning at me.&nbsp; But to my surprise, NO BODY
WAS THERE!!&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>door was still locked and the room was totally empty.&nbsp; I was
kind of spooked</b>
<br><b>and grabbed a towel and jerked the bathroom door open to find my
boyfriend</b>
<br><b>and nieces in the front room engrossed in a movie.&nbsp; When they
heard the door,</b>
<br><b>they turned and looked at me; I must have looked shaken because
he asked me</b>
<br><b>what was wrong.&nbsp; I asked him if he had just been in the bathroom
and he said</b>
<br><b>"no".&nbsp; I was hoping he was still teasing me, so I turned to
my nieces and</b>
<br><b>asked them if he had been there the whole time and they told me
"yes, he has".</b><b></b>
<p><b>By this time, I was sort of freaking out about what had just happened
and</b>
<br><b>told him about it.&nbsp; I was afraid to go back in and finish my
shower; I was</b>
<br><b>standing there dripping in a towel and with soap still in my hair.&nbsp;
But I</b>
<br><b>finally went back in and finished my shower; but I left the door
standing</b>
<br><b>wide open!!</b><b></b>
<p><b>Later on after this incident, my boyfriend told me about the first
night he</b>
<br><b>spent in this apartment.&nbsp; He hadn't told me before, because
he was afraid</b>
<br><b>he'd scare me and I would never spend any time there with him.&nbsp;
He had sold</b>
<br><b>all his furniture before moving in because he anticipated going
to college</b>
<br><b>and living with a friend in Marquette, Michigan.&nbsp; He only had
a couple of</b>
<br><b>lawn chairs in the living room, his TV, a LOT of boxes and an inflatable
air</b>
<br><b>mattress to sleep on (pretty spartan life, huh?!?).&nbsp; Anyway,
the first night</b>
<br><b>he said he felt very uneasy and had trouble sleeping, and as time
went by the</b>
<br><b>feeling of unease continued to grow.&nbsp; He said it eventually
grew into a</b>
<br><b>feeling of utter panic, the sense of dread was so overwhelming that
he went</b>
<br><b>thru his boxes until he found his bible, rosary and a picture of
the last</b>
<br><b>supper he had packed away.&nbsp; He set these items about him on
the air mattress</b>
<br><b>and started to pray.&nbsp; He said he had a "vision" or something
(he couldn't</b>
<br><b>quite explain it) of someone (unseen) out on the second floor balcony
trying</b>
<br><b>to get in to him.&nbsp; He had the feeling that this "evil presence"
had a butcher</b>
<br><b>knife and intended to do him great harm.&nbsp; He had the feeling
that he HAD to</b>
<br><b>get out of there now or else he never would, but he was too terrified
to</b>
<br><b>move.&nbsp; Finally he got his courage together and bolted out of
there in nothing</b>
<br><b>but shorts and sat outside for a while (because he didn't stop to
get his</b>
<br><b>truck keys) until he calmed himself down.&nbsp; He convinced himself
that it was</b>
<br><b>all just his overactive imagination and almost managed to laugh
at himself.</b>
<br><b>He went back inside (because he hadn't locked the door, thank heavens),
and</b>
<br><b>the feeling had totally evaporated.&nbsp; There was no sense of
a black, evil</b>
<br><b>presence, no overwhelming terror and panic, no unease at all.&nbsp;
It was the</b>
<br><b>middle of the night and he had to work the next day, so he figured
he'd</b>
<br><b>better get what sleep he could that night.</b><b></b>
<p><b>He halfheartedly chalked it up to the move and being in a new place,
etc.,</b>
<br><b>and never told anyone about it.&nbsp; Until this "thing" happened
to me, then he</b>
<br><b>began to wonder if there was something more going on.&nbsp; He never
asked the</b>
<br><b>landlord if anything strange had happened to anyone else who lived
there, or</b>
<br><b>if anything had ever physically happened to anyone who lived here.&nbsp;
He</b>
<br><b>wondered if someone had maybe climbed up on the balcony, gained
entry and</b>
<br><b>murdered someone who once lived there.&nbsp; But we have no way
of knowing.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>didn't live there very long, he moved into the apartment complex
around May</b>
<br><b>and by September had moved into my place with me.&nbsp; We eventually
broke up in</b>
<br><b>July of 1997, but still keep in touch periodically.&nbsp; Though
his experience</b>
<br><b>was much more intense and terrifying than mine, we always wondered
what</b>
<br><b>exactly we experienced in that apartment; we probably will never
know.&nbsp; If</b>
<br><b>you or anyone else out there has any theories, please let me know.&nbsp;
I've</b>
<br><b>never had any experience before or since then, and I will always
wonder what,</b>
<br><b>if anything, it was.</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Story</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: tinak567@worldspy.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I've always believed in ghosts, and if anyone says I'm crazy, well,
that's their opinion...it's nothing I've ever seen, mostly just feelings,
I think if I actually saw a ghost I'd pass out cold!! My son passed away
2 years ago &amp; I get visits from him once in a while, not the cold sensations
most people feel with a ghost, but a warm pleasant sensation of being very
loved &amp; safe..he's my guardian angel, &amp; he proved it just last
night...my fiance &amp; I had gone to his aunt's house in Warren, PA, which
is 70 miles from where I live, which is near Erie, PA....it was snowing
pretty badly by the time we left Warren, and the roads were awful, no visibility,
slippery, and drifting snow made for a very unsafe experience...every time
time we thought we lost the road, another vehicle would come along and
show us the way...I just knew it was my baby protecting me....I'm pretty
sure my house is haunted, by who, I have no clue, but it is an old house
and I'm in the process of investigating it's past....I used to work 11
pm to 5 am and would sleep till 2;30 pm when my fiance would come home
from work &amp; wake me up...my bedroom is upstairs &amp; to get to it
I have to walk through the other bedroom...I would keep the other room's
door shut to keep my cats out so I could sleep in peace...one day I heard
the bedroom door open and footsteps walk through the other room to the
side of my bed...I thought it was my fiance coming in to wake me up...but
when I turned over, no one was there, the clock read only noon, so it was
way too early for him to come home....needless to say I got the shivers
and was awake for the rest of the day...this has happened several times.....I
also see things out of the corner of my eye, like movement, or someone
standing there, but when I turn to look, of course no one is there, sometimes
I go to check on my cats to see if it was them, but they're usually asleep
downstairs...and these things always happen upstairs...I refuse to go into
the basement, because I get real bad "vibes" down there...don't know why
but I won't mess with it...same with my attic...this is a duplex house,
and a couple of months ago, the neighbors moved out.....lately I've been
hearing someone going up &amp; down the steps, but when I go to check if
maybe the landlord, or new neighbors are over there, the place is totally
empty...what do you think? Is it my imagination? Or am I haunted?</b>

<p><b>Whom ever is intrested, I am not looking for help to get rid of my</b>
<br><b>friends,but I would like someone to give me some advice on how to
speak</b>
<br><b>to them, and how to deceid which are good and which are bad.</b>
<br><b>I will start with the hole storie. My whole life (27 years) I have
seem to</b>
<br><b>drawn ghost, spirts, what ever you want to call them to me.&nbsp;
When I was</b>
<br><b>6 years old we lived in a house in a small town close to where I
live</b>
<br><b>now.&nbsp; My mother,and aunt , and father use to tell me of things
that seem</b>
<br><b>to happen in my bed room of this house,&nbsp; on night that I would
be</b>
<br><b>staying at my grandmothers they would here babies crying from my
room,</b>
<br><b>when they would go to check , they would see faces in my window
but</b>
<br><b>there was no one out side. Things would levatate around as is babies</b>
<br><b>were playing, needless to say my father belived in this type thing
my</b>
<br><b>mother did not so we moved.&nbsp; Of coarse I was not old enough
to remember</b>
<br><b>so that is hear say to me.&nbsp; Right after this</b>
<br><b>my parents got divorced.&nbsp; I&nbsp; really don't personal remember
any other</b>
<br><b>occurrances until I was about 5 years old</b>
<br><b>That was when I began visiting my father for weekends at his house.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>mother was remarried and moved alot so</b>
<br><b>my fathers house was my safe house untill i was about 6.&nbsp; Then
my uncle</b>
<br><b>that had been living with him passed</b>
<br><b>away right after he died, strange things began to occurr. Now keep
in mind</b>
<br><b>my dad belived in this type thing so he just made cute comments
about</b>
<br><b>these things and acted as if they were normal, doors would shut
by there</b>
<br><b>selves, cool breezes moved threw the house, you could here conversations</b>
<br><b>from rooms no one was in.&nbsp; My bed room was the strangest, I
was only</b>
<br><b>there on the weekend,and I do not know if they happened when I was
not</b>
<br><b>there, the room was constantly 20 degrees colder than the rest of
the</b>
<br><b>house. We redone the&nbsp; room, new walls new insulation, new carpet
everything, nothing helped</b>
<br><b>occasionally you would try to enter the room and could not,it was
like</b>
<br><b>someone was sitting inside the room with ther back to the door,
belive</b>
<br><b>me I got in alot of trouble every time this happened .&nbsp; Any
way one day my father</b>
<br><b>was comming into my room to ask me something I was in the process
of</b>
<br><b>making my bed , he says I was talking to someone but I dont recall,
but</b>
<br><b>that was not the problem my pillow was floating from the end of
my bed</b>
<br><b>to the top of my bed. At this time he got alittle concerned.</b>
<br><b>Just about the same time strange things seem to start at my mothers,&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>had went to a conviente store two doors</b>
<br><b>down from my house. In returning I grabbed an apple, sat down on
the couch</b>
<br><b>and began to eat it. Very large pounding started on the front window
of</b>
<br><b>the house I was so scared, I could not scream. I ran to the hall
way</b>
<br><b>beating on my stepfathers door just about the time he opened the
door. It</b>
<br><b>stopped he said he did not here it</b>
<br><b>or me beating on the door. I was just sitting in the hall way crying,
but</b>
<br><b>he did go out side to check. We had just had a fresh snow fall.
He said no one was out there and there were no feet tracks. This was just
the beginning from that night forward, all</b>
<br><b>hell broke lose. Everynight just about the time, I would dose off
to sleep</b>
<br><b>this same thing would happen but it went from windows to the walls.&nbsp;
If</b>
<br><b>you were out side you could hear girls screaming from our orchard
, the doors in this house began to open and close things began to move
and come up missing, just right down stange things, no one ever admitted
to anything. But I remember being sent to</b>
<br><b>to my dads alot more, and things were not any better there but more</b>
<br><b>friendly.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The house my mother lived in nearly drove me nuts. I had really
bad</b>
<br><b>dreams along with the rest of the family. It was everything from
what were scared of to death of each other. Dreams of opening doors to
closets and finding rooms that were not there.&nbsp; We went camping once
and it even happened there.&nbsp; We were leasing the</b>
<br><b>the house we were in so we moved, some one bought the house and
property</b>
<br><b>it was on. The house was cut in half and moved, I was told the person</b>
<br><b>who bought it knew of the things happening and gave it to a college,that</b>
<br><b>is hearsay and knowing what I know know, I dont think it was the
house.</b>
<br><b>During the move, I went to live at my fathers for a while, but like
I</b>
<br><b>said it happened there too. But my father had the same idea I had,
dont run</b>
<br><b>just find out more and talk to it. So our neighbor and long time
friend</b>
<br><b>of my dad, was a (witch) his name was goose, he ask him to help,
so there was a</b>
<br><b>ritual performed of some sort.I was</b>
<br><b>not invited- I was told they had found a few items I had lost, hidden
in</b>
<br><b>my room and that there were children</b>
<br><b>trapped in limbo in my room. They had been killed there. At the
time I</b>
<br><b>beleived it, but now I'm older and have</b>
<br><b>looked for my self that never occured there.(&nbsp; my father died
a few</b>
<br><b>years ago. Before he did I sat down and had a long talk with him.)</b>
<br><b>This is part of what I discovered&nbsp; he was really sick, so I
stayed at his</b>
<br><b>house with him to help. He had cancer and was bad off enough he
could not</b>
<br><b>walk. I was sleeping in my old room and just as if I was a child.
still he</b>
<br><b>came into my room to tuck me. Then I remembered it could not be
him he</b>
<br><b>could not walk. So I did not move, I only watched(oh I forgot I
was also 5</b>
<br><b>mo pregant) This person came into my&nbsp; room made sure I was
covered put</b>
<br><b>an extra blankett on my feet and left he room,&nbsp; this had happened</b>
<br><b>everynight of my life I just thought it was my father.</b>
<br><b>The next morrning is when we had our talk- he said that this had
been</b>
<br><b>happening as long as I had been visiting him. He said it never done
me</b>
<br><b>any harm. It seem to protect me so he never bothered it. That night
we</b>
<br><b>had to put my father in the hospital and he died shortly there after.
I</b>
<br><b>couldn't bring my self to live in his house</b>
<br><b>so I rented it out, but I kept having really bad dreams of the house
so</b>
<br><b>I sold it.&nbsp; I have talked to the new owners they say they have
never had any problems.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I also went back to the first house of the baby cries.</b>
<br><b>They say nothin has ever happend there . So I began a journal which
has</b>
<br><b>most reacently disappered.</b>
<br><b>What ever this is it follows me in the house I am in now. Its alot
calmer,</b>
<br><b>occasionaly you will see a shadow on the wall of a very tall person
walking</b>
<br><b>threw the kitchen. I have a</b>
<br><b>couple of items from my fathers house a microwave that comes on
by its self that you have to unplug to turn off- a vcr that turns it self
off-</b>
<br><b>a cell phone that when my friends call a man answers it&nbsp; says
he is</b>
<br><b>Scott, Kims father and that they can not talk to me they will cause
me to have a wreck and hangs up. I have seen a person walking up and down
my drive way in the middle of storms.</b>
<br><b>I work in a video store and at night after closing. I have had someone
grab</b>
<br><b>me by my shoulder. I have heard voices as if they were whispering
to me, but I</b>
<br><b>can not understand what they are saying. I now have two children,
one</b>
<br><b>(5years) one thats (1) year. I don't think that anything has ever
happened</b>
<br><b>around them, but when I was pregnant with my second one the babies
crying</b>
<br><b>started again. Then I had to tell this whole story to my now husband.
I figured as everyone he would think I wasnuts but he said he has seen
and heard</b>
<br><b>everything. I explained to him, he just never sayed anything because
he</b>
<br><b>did not want to scare me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; So here I am now I have began to read books. At first I thought
it was a</b>
<br><b>poltergiest that I had caused to protect myself from something and
did</b>
<br><b>not know how to let it back in. So I ask a few people that had known</b>
<br><b>goose(the witch). They gave me a few books to read but they were
more</b>
<br><b>spritual books and wiccan books.&nbsp; Now I'm pretty sure its not
a poltergiest.&nbsp; I went to see a psychic but she was very uncomfortable
around me and said&nbsp; that doing a reading or</b>
<br><b>anything else on me would not be wise she said i had some strange
aura</b>
<br><b>going on. I know beleive that I am&nbsp; some sort of mediater and
I dont know how to</b>
<br><b>use what I have got. Not only that as hot and cold as the (things)
around me are I may not want to know how.&nbsp; At this time they only
two forms communcation I know are the (board) which I beleive is total
bogas and the one pharse that I was told before my father died that doesn't
seem towork to call out (in gods name what do you want ) which is probley
bogas</b>
<br><b>but at 2:00 am it seems to make me feel better.</b>
<br><b>Now as I set here I am very emotional and everytime I bring it up
it or</b>
<br><b>start to dig in it starts again.</b><b></b>

<p><b>14 Douglas St.</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: plippe@webtv.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>The legend of the house at 14 Douglas St.is that years ago an old</b>
<br><b>Italian women and her son owned and lived on the second floor of
the</b>
<br><b>three decker. The son meet and started dating a girl that the mother</b>
<br><b>disapproved of right away.But he&nbsp; son continued to see the
girl, and as</b>
<br><b>there relationship became more serious asked her to marry him. The</b>
<br><b>mother became enraged at this news and she and her son had a huge
fight.</b>
<br><b>With the mother yelling and screaming that the girl was a no good
tramp</b>
<br><b>who would break her sons heart.And that if the son married the girl,
she</b>
<br><b>would never be allowed to step a foot in the mothers house.The son</b>
<br><b>married anyways and the mother was true to her word. Although the
son</b>
<br><b>visited his mother his wife was never allowed in the house.Years
went by</b>
<br><b>and the mother died leaving the house to her son.After burying his</b>
<br><b>mother, the cleared out&nbsp; her apartment and got rid of all her
things.</b>
<br><b>All that is except her rocking chair , she had loved and spent a
good</b>
<br><b>deal of her time rocking in that chair. He just couldn't get rid
of it</b>
<br><b>,so he took it and placed it in the cellar. At some point the son</b>
<br><b>decided it was stupid to be paying rent when he now owned a house.And
he</b>
<br><b>moved his wife and himself into Douglas St. As soon as they moved
in</b>
<br><b>weird things started happening.Of these things&nbsp; the three best
known t</b>
<br><b>the legend are&nbsp; The house shook&nbsp; An icy cold breeze could
be felt&nbsp; And</b>
<br><b>the rocking chair in the cellar rocking by itself. At some point
the son</b>
<br><b>contacted some people in the field of haunted house. They came to
the</b>
<br><b>house&nbsp; and tested for a number of&nbsp; reasons that would
cause the</b>
<br><b>happenings that were gong on in the house. After alot of testing
and</b>
<br><b>research they could explain none of it. And told the son that they
felt</b>
<br><b>the house was haunted by his mother. The son moved out and sod the</b>
<br><b>house. He bought a new house with the money from the sale of the
old</b>
<br><b>house. The haunting stopped at Douglas St. but followed him to the
new</b>
<br><b>house. Once again he contacted the research people, who told him
this</b>
<br><b>may be happening because he had purchased the new house with the
money</b>
<br><b>from the old house. When he could stand it no longer he sold his
new</b>
<br><b>house and donated the money charity.But that is not the end the
old lady</b>
<br><b>returned to the house on Douglas ST. where her presents is still
felt.</b>
<br><b>While some people may not believe this legend , I lived at 14 Douglas</b>
<br><b>St. for ten years and have stories of my own about the house.</b>
<br><b>Also although I have never looked into it myself, there is said
to be an</b>
<br><b>account of the research that was done at the Worcester Public Library</b>
<br><b>For the last three years our local paper prints a list of haunted
houses</b>
<br><b>in the area at Halloween. And 14 Douglas St. is always the first
on the</b>
<br><b>list.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Magnet for Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: laura3339@webtv.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I've only shared these events with a few of my closes friends....
my</b>
<br><b>family members and my husband aren't even aware of the experiences
I</b>
<br><b>have had.&nbsp; I'll try to make this as direct as possible.&nbsp;
Ghosts have</b>
<br><b>been attracted to me ever since I can remember, as a child i could
here</b>
<br><b>them whispering and have had several encounters as an adult, some</b>
<br><b>contacts stronger than others.&nbsp; I would like to share one of
my stories</b>
<br><b>with you.</b><b></b>
<p><b>About 4 years ago my son (who was not yet 1 at the time) and I lived
in</b>
<br><b>an older Victorian style home. The house was being remodelled so
we</b>
<br><b>lived primarily on the 3rd floor. The phenomenon at this residence
began</b>
<br><b>about 2 weeks after we moved in with the opening of a second story</b>
<br><b>window in the stairway.&nbsp; Every night I would secure the house
and every</b>
<br><b>morning the window would be open.&nbsp; Since my son and I were
the only</b>
<br><b>people in the house I assumed someone had broken in and decided
to nail</b>
<br><b>the window shut.&nbsp; The next morning I found the nails removed
and the</b>
<br><b>window wide open. This was one of the many incidences. My son would
play</b>
<br><b>for hours with an unseen person who would roll balls to him and
start up</b>
<br><b>his mobile. Unfortunately things did not remain calm, after being
in the</b>
<br><b>house for 2 months the spirit became bolder and made its presents
known</b>
<br><b>in many ways.&nbsp; Door slamming sessions on all levels of the
house became</b>
<br><b>a daily event, music could be heard in certain spots and rooms of
the</b>
<br><b>house and the entity began writing in red crayon on freshly painted</b>
<br><b>walls.&nbsp; Unfortunately my son and I were forced to leave our
home when</b>
<br><b>things began fling through the air and causing us harm.&nbsp; Later
I did</b>
<br><b>some research and discovered the house had suffered a fire in the
early</b>
<br><b>1900's and claimed the life of an adult and a child.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I've had these type of experiences before and since the incident
listed</b>
<br><b>above.&nbsp; I would like others to know that they are not crazy.&nbsp;
I consider</b>
<br><b>myself special to have such a gift.&nbsp; Thank you for your time.</b><b></b>
