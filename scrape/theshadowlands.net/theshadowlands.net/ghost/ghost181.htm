<b>Whispers at Night</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SuthernbelleVa1@cs.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>As long as I can remember I have had many strange experiences.&nbsp;
I at one time</b>
<br><b>seriously considered becoming a parapsychologist.&nbsp; In 1994
I was married and</b>
<br><b>living in my home with my husband (he had bought the home the year
before)</b>
<br><b>One evening, I went to bed early.&nbsp; Our home was originally
built in the early</b>
<br><b>40's.&nbsp; My husband stayed up to watch TV in the living room
which was right</b>
<br><b>beside our bedroom.&nbsp; I was laying in the bed thinking about
the project I had</b>
<br><b>to work on the next day when I heard someone say my nick name.&nbsp;
I layed there</b>
<br><b>and called out my husbands name in question.&nbsp; He did not answer
me, so I got</b>
<br><b>up and opened the door and looked out into the living room and asked
him what</b>
<br><b>did he want.&nbsp; He looked at me and said "What?".&nbsp; I said
,"you called me".&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>denied it.&nbsp; Thinking maybe I had imagined it I went back to
bed.&nbsp; As I closed</b>
<br><b>my eyes again..I remember hearing someone; almost like a whisper
mumbling in</b>
<br><b>my ear.,,,I was dumfounded.&nbsp; I could not make out a word of
it - except my</b>
<br><b>nick name.&nbsp; Almost, like someone was trying to tell me something.&nbsp;
It had a</b>
<br><b>deep quality to it...almost like a man whispering...I jumped out
of bed...and</b>
<br><b>threw open the door - half expecting to see my husband standing
outside</b>
<br><b>it....but he was in the recliner.&nbsp; I scared him...he said what
are you</b>
<br><b>doing...I said,"where you talking to me"?&nbsp; he said no....are
you okay...I</b>
<br><b>mumbled back to him...yeah, I just thought I heard someone talking...maybe
it</b>
<br><b>was the tv.&nbsp; He said..well, I will turn it down..and he did..
I went back to</b>
<br><b>bed again...needless to say..this continued for 3 nights in a row...and
I</b>
<br><b>mean continued..as soon as I would get comfortable in bed, it would
start</b>
<br><b>whispering in my ear.&nbsp; Of course, my husband could not hear
a thing..and I</b>
<br><b>was keeping him up by whispering back to it...I was saying things
like,</b>
<br><b>"What?" and my husband thought I was talking to him...he would respond
each</b>
<br><b>time with "WHat? What?".&nbsp; I seriously began to think I was
loosing my mind.</b>
<br><b>I was getting NO sleep..and was starting to doubt my own sanity.&nbsp;
The third</b>
<br><b>night it happend...there was a new voice...it was softer...and it
was not as</b>
<br><b>frantic or it seemed as if it were more calm and it was saying my
full</b>
<br><b>name.....it was mumbling in a whisper...all I could catch were the
sh's...It</b>
<br><b>was very frightening to me...it would alternate back and forth between
the</b>
<br><b>male whisper and the female whisper.&nbsp; I finally sat up in the
bed...sleep</b>
<br><b>deprived..and said outloud...,"Look, apparently ya'll have something
you</b>
<br><b>would like to tell me...but you are keeping me up...I need some
sleep..I am</b>
<br><b>exhausted...it is not that I don't care as to what it is you want
to tell</b>
<br><b>me....just enunciate it more clearly....if you can not do that.....talk
to my</b>
<br><b>husband...he has had sleep for three nights in a row...I am sure
he would</b>
<br><b>listen..if not please ...just stop...."&nbsp; I layed down...afraid
to close my</b>
<br><b>eyes....for fear that it would keep on...it did...but within about
3</b>
<br><b>minutes...it just faded away.....the last word I remember hearing</b>
<br><b>clearly...was my name....&nbsp; THIS IS A TRUE STORY>>>&nbsp; ps...about
a week later a</b>
<br><b>neighbor and I were talking one night outside and I told her about
this wacky</b>
<br><b>incident...she was a older lady..I will never forget this....she
said..."oh,</b>
<br><b>that was probably Elizabeth...apparently the woman who lived in
the house</b>
<br><b>about 5 yrs early had died in the room that we started using as
our bedroom.</b>
<br><b>(We had just moved out of one of the other bedrooms into the larger
room the</b>
<br><b>weekend before the incident started).&nbsp; Her husband a year later
shot himself</b>
<br><b>in our kitchen.&nbsp; When I talked to the real estate lady the
next day - she</b>
<br><b>confirmed that yes, Edward had indeed killed himself in our home.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>kitchen had been totally remodeled before they put it on the market....one</b>
<br><b>other side note...one night my husband was in the living room watching
tv -</b>
<br><b>(I was away on a business trip) he said he was just sitting there
when the</b>
<br><b>overhead light cut off.(Now, he said he wouldn't have thougth that
weird if</b>
<br><b>it had been a blown bulb which is what he thought it was) He got
up to walk</b>
<br><b>into the dining room and he heard the switch click (again the house
is very</b>
<br><b>old...so the switches made a distinctive noise when you turned them
on and</b>
<br><b>off)and the light cut on.&nbsp; He said he just stood there...afraid
to move...so</b>
<br><b>he started backing out of the room...the light flicked off once
more -</b>
<br><b>accompanied by the "Click" and he said at that point, he grabbed
his car keys</b>
<br><b>and left.&nbsp; He stayed at his brothers house that night.&nbsp;
He never even shut</b>
<br><b>the front door in his hast to leave the house.&nbsp; PS..our house
is also about 4</b>
<br><b>blocks from the Appomatox Manor house...This site is listed on one
of the</b>
<br><b>haunted houses sites.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Weird Eerie and Cool All at the Same Time</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jocsho@impop.bellatlantic.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>This isn't a very long story, or a very interesting story but it
is true</b>
<br><b>and it happened to my cousin and I a few years ago. My cousin, a
mutual</b>
<br><b>friend, and myself were site seeing a Gettysberg National Battlefield,</b>
<br><b>we had been there all day and had stayed until the park closed at
10 pm</b>
<br><b>.I guess it was about 9:00 pm and we were at a part of the battlefield</b>
<br><b>called Pickett's Charge. This site is where about ten thousand</b>
<br><b>confederate soldiers were killed during the battle of Gettysberg.
Well</b>
<br><b>to get to the good part, My cousin an d I walked onto the field
which is</b>
<br><b>surrounded by woods on three sides, well anyway I had wandered into
the</b>
<br><b>edge of the woods, and I couldn't have been more than about 15 to
20</b>
<br><b>feet into the thicket and I got the strangest feeling that someone
was</b>
<br><b>watching me. I then started walking back to the direction that my
cousin</b>
<br><b>and friend were, and all of a sudden I just stopped dead in my tracks</b>
<br><b>and felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up, now I am not
the</b>
<br><b>bravest person on earth, but I just had to turn around and look
behind</b>
<br><b>me where there was nothing that I could see, just trees and darkness.
By</b>
<br><b>this time I was feeling quite anxious and double stepped it out
of those</b>
<br><b>woods and didn't look back. I don't know what was in those woods,
but</b>
<br><b>whatever it was it sure wasn't worried about letting me know that
it was</b>
<br><b>there.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Was it Grandpa?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ErinKOC@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I am 13 and I watch every ghost program I can. My last granfather
passed away</b>
<br><b>during the summer of 2000. The day of his funeral everyone was upset.
I was</b>
<br><b>very upset since I never got to get to know my grandfather, who
had been sick</b>
<br><b>with emphysema since I was 8. In my grandma's house there is a kitchen
that</b>
<br><b>connects with the dining room and the family room.</b>
<br><b>From the kitchen there is a back hall that extends back into the
farther part</b>
<br><b>of the house. My grandfather died in the back room, which was the
last room</b>
<br><b>at the end of the hallway. The bathroom, my grandma's room, and
the basement</b>
<br><b>branch off of this hallway.</b>
<br><b>While I was walking back to the family room from the kitchen, I
saw someone,</b>
<br><b>unmistakably my grandfather, walk into the back room and shut the
door. I</b>
<br><b>hesitated for a moment, then walked back to see who it really was.
I pushed</b>
<br><b>the door open and there was no one to be seen. I was very tired,
having been</b>
<br><b>up past midnight while staying at my cousin's house. There are extra
beds in</b>
<br><b>the backroom, so I went to sleep on one of them.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;As I slept, I had a very strange dream. Someone started calling
my</b>
<br><b>grandmother's name. I called out "Who's calling grandma?" I turned
around to</b>
<br><b>see someone staring at me. And guess who it was? My grandfather.
"I want to</b>
<br><b>talk to Mary." He kept staring at me. "You can't talk to her." I
told him.</b>
<br><b>"Why not?" He was much younger and looked like he wasn't sick at
all.</b>
<br><b>"Grandma thinks you're dead. She doesn't believe in ghosts." My
grandfather</b>
<br><b>nodded. Then he smiled. "I'll talk to her later." He disappeared
while</b>
<br><b>telling me he would never forget me or my family. I stood watching
until he</b>
<br><b>was gone. In my dream someone was singing to me.</b>
<br><b>I later heard my grandmother complaining that someone was calling
her while</b>
<br><b>she slept. She believed it was my grandfather.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Voices</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SGillespie@janklow.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My room mate and I thought we may have had a ghost at one point,
but it has</b>
<br><b>since disappeared.&nbsp; We live in an old tenement building in
the Lower East</b>
<br><b>Side of Manhattan.&nbsp; I was sitting on my bed one night when
I felt a rush of</b>
<br><b>air go past my neck and I clearly heard something call my name in
a kind of</b>
<br><b>harsh whisper.&nbsp; I had a strange feeling that something tangible
had passed</b>
<br><b>by me.&nbsp; I was not so much frightened as I was taken by a feeling
of</b>
<br><b>heightened awareness.&nbsp; I had goosebumps that lasted for perhaps
ten minutes.</b>
<br><b>When I told my room mate about it, she said that she had experienced
the</b>
<br><b>same thing.&nbsp; My feeling was that it was a presence that wanted
to make</b>
<br><b>itself known.&nbsp; It felt neither evil nor good, simply present.</b>
<br><b>My mother was staying with me several months after that, and I had
left for</b>
<br><b>work, leaving her alone in the apartment one morning.&nbsp; She
called me in a</b>
<br><b>panic at work, asking if I were alright.&nbsp; When I asked her
what she was</b>
<br><b>talking about, she said she had woken to a voice audibly crying
out "Mom!"</b>
<br><b>She said she thought it was my voice and that something had happened
to me,</b>
<br><b>that I was crying out for help.</b>
<br><b>The voice has not returned since.&nbsp; The building always feels
quite safe and</b>
<br><b>non-creepy to me.</b>

<p><b>Voices and Shadows</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: phantom120@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>After looking at your site I wanted to add my own story....</b><b></b>
<p><b>I've lived in Arizona for most of my 16 years, but I was born in
Parma,</b>
<br><b>Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, and I lived there until I was six.
In the house</b>
<br><b>on Russel Ave., my Mom, brother, and I all had some strange experiences.
I</b>
<br><b>have to seriously doubt that my experiences were the product of
an</b>
<br><b>over-active imagination because, first, the memories are quite vivid,
and</b>
<br><b>second, my mother and brother have had some similar and some different</b>
<br><b>experiences in that house.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, before I was in school my Dad stayed home while my Mom was
at work</b>
<br><b>and my brother, who is about 5.5 years older than I am, was at school.
The</b>
<br><b>house was set up so that there was a small hall in the middle of
the ground</b>
<br><b>floor which led to each of the two bedrooms, bathroom, kitchen,
living room,</b>
<br><b>and, at one end, the stairs to the upstairs. The living room was
on one side</b>
<br><b>of the staircase, at the front of the house, while the kitchen was
on the</b>
<br><b>other side. often times, as a child of three or four, I was up early
while</b>
<br><b>my father was still asleep in the master bedroom. I would watch
TV in the</b>
<br><b>silent house and sit on the couch, one end of which was in the corner
of the</b>
<br><b>wall on the staircase and the side wall of the house. Directly above
was my</b>
<br><b>brother's room and the attic, along with a small closet-type room.</b>
<br><b>Sometimes, when I turned the TV off and got tired, I'd lay or sit
on that</b>
<br><b>end of the couch. It wasn't uncommon for me to hear voices above
me, as if</b>
<br><b>they were coming from the ceiling, or my brothers room. Granted,
the houses</b>
<br><b>of that neighborhood were close together, you still didn't often
listen to</b>
<br><b>other people's conversations as clearly as someone talking just
in the</b>
<br><b>kitchen, directly across the hall. Mostly there were two voices;
one a man</b>
<br><b>and one a woman, and I could discern words quite lcearly. The only
thing I</b>
<br><b>actually remember them saying was the man, as if in response to
a yes-or-no</b>
<br><b>question, "I don't know. No?". I heard them when people were around,
mostly</b>
<br><b>when it was quiet, but usually whenever I sat and listened right
there. But</b>
<br><b>I was six...it was a little freaky, but I still believed in the
Tooth Fairy</b>
<br><b>(I was five when my brother effectively dismissed THAT myth for
me...).</b>
<br><b>I pointed out that this spot was directly below my brother's room,
which he</b>
<br><b>hated with a passion. The upstairs was closed off for half of the
year,</b>
<br><b>anyway, as we couldn't afford to heat it when it was 20 below or
cool it</b>
<br><b>when it was 95. He usually slept in my room since I didn't like
sleeping</b>
<br><b>alone and spent most nights between my Mom and Dad (mind you I was
only four</b>
<br><b>or so at the time). He's had his own experiences in the upstairs
bedroom,</b>
<br><b>being old enough to really remember such things with clarity. It's
ranged</b>
<br><b>from strange red balls just outside of his window to 'dings' behind
him</b>
<br><b>every time he turned over in bed. He's also heard the voices, once,
while we</b>
<br><b>were sleeping in the basement during a tornado warning.</b>
<br><b>None of us spoke of these things until the drive out here, to Phoenix.
My</b>
<br><b>Mom and Dad had divorced two years prior and AZ is the only place
that she</b>
<br><b>has family. We were in the western part of New Mexico or the eastern
part of</b>
<br><b>Arizona, I'm not sure which, when my brother and I started to talk
about the</b>
<br><b>old house, which we had left only a week before. I'm not sure which
one of</b>
<br><b>us started on ghost stories, but I told about my voices, and he
told about</b>
<br><b>the red ball, and how Frisky, one of our dogs, was scared to death
of this</b>
<br><b>one spot in the master bedroom, the same spot I always avoided at
night if I</b>
<br><b>got up for any reason. I think Mom nearly drove off the road and
cliff when</b>
<br><b>we related our stories, especially when the subject of a small,
black</b>
<br><b>triangle came up. It gluided about two feet above the ground and
was a deep</b>
<br><b>ebony at the center, lightening slightly at the edges, and being
fringed on</b>
<br><b>the outside. Mom dismissed it as a sign of fatigue, as she was working
long</b>
<br><b>hours and taking care of my grandmother, who died of cancer about
a year</b>
<br><b>before we moved. My brother had a very active imagination, and me,
well, I</b>
<br><b>was six when we moved. Stuff like that doesn't seem awe-inspiring
when</b>
<br><b>you're that age. This was usually seen, though, in one area of the
house. It</b>
<br><b>was usually in the bathroom, my room, or the master bedroom, all
of which</b>
<br><b>were cloistered and comprised not-quite-half of the ground floor.
This was</b>
<br><b>not a large house. The thing, though, would either float lazily
along for</b>
<br><b>several seconds and disappear, at one point just before getting
to my</b>
<br><b>brother's out-stretched foot, or it was zip past so that you might
wonder if</b>
<br><b>you saw it at all.</b>
<br><b>I asked my Dad about it just this summer while I was visiting him
in</b>
<br><b>Florida. Strangely enough, he didn't have any strange experiences,
even</b>
<br><b>though the other three of us did. I'd like to go back to that house,
maybe</b>
<br><b>even ask the current owners if they've noticed anything strange,
but until</b>
<br><b>then it's just a good set of stories to give my friends goosebumps.
I don't</b>
<br><b>know what any of it was, as the house really wasn't all that old,
but it</b>
<br><b>certainly was a lot of strange happenings for living there only
five years.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Visits from the Other Side</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; Dancing Dwarf II@cs.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello.&nbsp; My name’s Adrian (well, that’s my pen name, anyway).&nbsp;
I’ve been</b>
<br><b>spending at least an hour every night reading the tales here of
other</b>
<br><b>people’s experiences.&nbsp; I feel it’s time to share mine.&nbsp;
I won’t tell you all</b>
<br><b>of them, so many were minor experiences and really not interesting
enough to</b>
<br><b>talk about.</b>
<br><b>Somewhere around 1990 I moved to an older white house&nbsp; in</b>
<br><b>Ames, Iowa.&nbsp; The place was divided into three seperate apartments
and I had</b>
<br><b>the bottom floor.&nbsp; Nothing much happened in the way of supernatural
activity</b>
<br><b>for the first few weeks, and when they did start it wasn’t anything
too</b>
<br><b>fascinating.&nbsp; There was a lot of minor poltergeist activity
taking place in</b>
<br><b>the kitchen, which would usually stop as soon as my wife or myself
walked in</b>
<br><b>there to see what we could see.&nbsp; I had had several encounters
with ghosts</b>
<br><b>before moving there and I thought these ghosts were trite and unimaginative.</b>
<br><b>"If you’re trying to scare us off, you’ll have to do better than
slamming</b>
<br><b>cupboard doors until I walk into the room.&nbsp; That’s a bit cliched,"
I told</b>
<br><b>them.&nbsp; Because I was bold and talked to them like they were
equals and not</b>
<br><b>some powerful thing that I should run from, I gained their respect
and they</b>
<br><b>calmed down some.&nbsp; We did still hear a knocking from time to
time on the</b>
<br><b>walls and floors.&nbsp; This was always heard just before a pipe
burst in the</b>
<br><b>basement of the old house.&nbsp; I came to realize the ghosts were
no longer</b>
<br><b>trying to scare us off, but asking us to help keep the old house
in repairs.</b>
<br><b>Finally, after a few months, things began to get more interesting.&nbsp;
I would</b>
<br><b>be up late at night writing and would see the forms of two old men
in black</b>
<br><b>suits and ties standing over me, watching what I did.&nbsp; One
was a kindly old</b>
<br><b>man with a long silver-gray beard, the other was a stern faced man
with dark</b>
<br><b>hair and glasses.&nbsp; I usually could see no more detail of their
faces than a</b>
<br><b>few shadows on their foreheads and cheeks.</b>
<br><b>There was the ghost of a teen-aged girl there, too.&nbsp; At first
we only knew</b>
<br><b>she was around because we could smell her perfume, but as time went
on we</b>
<br><b>could feel her precense and eventually we could see her.&nbsp; At
first, she</b>
<br><b>seemed to be just a blob of gray moving around, but as time went
on we would</b>
<br><b>see more details.&nbsp; We never really saw her face, but would
see the outline of</b>
<br><b>her body and sometimes her clothes and hair.&nbsp; She was dressed
in a white</b>
<br><b>t-shirt and blue jeans and had long, golden hair.</b>
<br><b>I have to tell you about one of the best encounters I had.&nbsp;
I came home from</b>
<br><b>work one day and walked into the living room to see two heavy set
young men</b>
<br><b>on my couch.&nbsp; They were as clear as seeing a living person.&nbsp;
I could see</b>
<br><b>every detail of their faces, clothes and hair.&nbsp; They had dark
brown curly</b>
<br><b>hair, wore glasses and grey slacks, blue sweaters and black ties.&nbsp;
To give</b>
<br><b>you a clearer picture of them, they looked a bit like a cross between
a</b>
<br><b>younger Wayne Knight (Newman on Seinfeld) and a much younger Roger
Ebert.</b>
<br><b>They were identical twins!&nbsp; To make the encounter even more
interesting, what</b>
<br><b>they were doing cracked me up.&nbsp; They were sitting there, jabbing
each other</b>
<br><b>with their fingers and laughing themselves crazy.&nbsp; The only
thing they lacked</b>
<br><b>was sound.&nbsp; I couldn’t hear them at all.&nbsp; They didn’t
seem to know I was</b>
<br><b>watching, as they were too engrossed in their horseplay.&nbsp; I
only saw them for</b>
<br><b>about twenty seconds, then they vanished completely.</b>
<br><b>That house also had a ghost cat and dog in it.&nbsp; I would see
them occasionally</b>
<br><b>running around the living room.&nbsp; They ran about a foot off
the floor,</b>
<br><b>something I found very interesting.</b>
<br><b>I could tell you more, but I want to keep this relatively short.&nbsp;
How about</b>
<br><b>if I write again soon and tell you about the kindly old man and
the teen</b>
<br><b>girl, since I did actually talk to both of them later on and learned
a little</b>
<br><b>about them.&nbsp; I’d also like to tell you about some of my experiences
in other</b>
<br><b>places I’ve lived.&nbsp; Thanks for reading.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Unknown Shadows</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: FLAMEbaby2000@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Not too long ago I had a friend in her early 30's and she lived all
by</b>
<br><b>herself with her dogs. She would tell me sometimes that she heard
people on</b>
<br><b>her roof talking about her, and I just thought she was hearing things.
One</b>
<br><b>time she asked if I would hide in the bushes outside her house and
watch to</b>
<br><b>see if something would happen. so to humor her I hid in the bushes
I didn't</b>
<br><b>think I'd see anything but I did.&nbsp; I saw medium sized black
masses walk on</b>
<br><b>her roof that vanished after about a minute.&nbsp; So after that
i was really</b>
<br><b>scared to go near her house but one day she called me and asked
if I could</b>
<br><b>come over so I did and what I saw scarred me for life I was walking
in the</b>
<br><b>hall an i went by the bathroom and the door was open and a black
figure</b>
<br><b>appeared and his face was shaped like a scull and he put his hand
out and</b>
<br><b>motioned it's finger to follow him then be backed into the bathroom
and</b>
<br><b>disappeared there was no way it could have been just regular shadows
because</b>
<br><b>my friend had gotten so afraid of whatever was happening that she
put thick</b>
<br><b>blankets over all the windows. After that we went downstairs and
shadows from</b>
<br><b>the artificial lights started spinning around the room to the point
I could</b>
<br><b>feel little gusts of winds and in the middle of it all was the same
thing I</b>
<br><b>saw in the bathroom then all of a sudden everything stopped and
we heard</b>
<br><b>whispers saying how should we kill them over and over again so we
ran to the</b>
<br><b>door but we couldn't get out and the windows wouldn't break so we
started</b>
<br><b>crying&nbsp; and it all went away and the ghosts never came back
again not even to</b>
<br><b>this day I guess whatever they were they just wanted to scare us
really bad.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Anyway, whilst im my early years, say 8 years old i shared my bedroom
with</b>
<br><b>my sister, who is some four years older than myself.</b>
<br><b>during one normal evening I was awakened by my sister frantically
pulling my</b>
<br><b>bed clothes. and pointing to the ceiling..</b>
<br><b>In my total amazement there on the ceiling was a light shapped hand
on the</b>
<br><b>ceiling..It didnt move around trying to scare us, it simply floated
on the</b>
<br><b>ceiling surface. the hand wasnt in shadow either it was pure perfect
light..</b>
<br><b>I admitt i could hardly move with fear but my sister, searched the
room high</b>
<br><b>and low trying to establish the source..but nothing...</b>
<br><b>To this day, my sister and i recall that night with clarity.but
we cannot</b>
<br><b>explain this....we hope its a good sign. but if anyone has experienced
this</b>

<br><b>most of my life. For starters, when I was born the house we lived
in , so my</b>
<br><b>mother tells me, was very creepy, my parents and siblings would
see shadows</b>
<br><b>moving throughout the house, even on the porch outside. They would
be</b>
<br><b>sitting quietly in the house and hear loud stomping on the porch,
but when</b>
<br><b>they looked outside there would be nothing there. They would hear
footsteps</b>
<br><b>going up and down the stairs at all hours of the day. My brother,
who was 2</b>
<br><b>years old, would be pushed down to the ground, and even down the
stairs. my</b>
<br><b>mother observed him lurching forward as if somebody pushed him from
behind.</b>
<br><b>On one occasion, my father was sitting on the toilet, which was
located</b>
<br><b>under the stairway, when he heard my brother walk down the upstairs
hall and</b>
<br><b>begin to come down the stairs, then he says, he heard rapid footsteps
come</b>
<br><b>down the hall toward my brother he jumped up form the toilet and
ran around</b>
<br><b>in time to catch my brother as he literally flew down the stairs.
We moved</b>
<br><b>from this house shortly after that, it was a rented house and the
owners</b>
<br><b>were only able to rent it to one family afterward, then they sold
it, the</b>
<br><b>new owners live there for a very short time before they moved out
and tore</b>
<br><b>the house down, a new duplex was built on the lot, I don't know
whtether it</b>
<br><b>has the same phenomenon or not. I obviously have no memories of
this house,</b>
<br><b>i was just a baby, but I do have many other memories. I will share
other</b>
<br><b>stories at a later time but one other I would like to share here
is the</b>
<br><b>story of a place I lived with my ex wife. We were just married when
we moved</b>
<br><b>into a mobile home in a small town, on one of the first nights there
we had</b>
<br><b>gone out and left our kids,(her son and my daughter,each from previous</b>
<br><b>relationships,) with a babysitter, When we returned my wife left
to take the</b>
<br><b>sitter home and I climbed into bed to read. As I layed in my bed
I heard</b>
<br><b>what sounded like my daughter running down the hall toward my room,
I</b>
<br><b>distinctly heard a small girls chuckle. I smiled and turned toward
the door,</b>
<br><b>fully expecting to see my daughter bolt into the room. When noone
entered I</b>
<br><b>got up and wlaked down the hall ot my daughteres room, she was deep
asleep</b>
<br><b>as was my stepson. On another occasion, when I was home alone, I
was doing</b>
<br><b>some work on the bathroom plumbing when I heard some one enter the
bathroom</b>
<br><b>and a small childs voice say "What are you doing Daddy?". I turned
around</b>
<br><b>quickly but noone was there. My wife would be geeting ready to go
places</b>
<br><b>when she would smell a very strong perfume, or stale cigarettes.
One night</b>
<br><b>while I was working the nightshift, she called me at work to tell
me the bed</b>
<br><b>was shaking and thumping, and she would feel something sit on the
bed. At</b>
<br><b>night as we watched T.V on several occasions we would both se, out
of the</b>
<br><b>corner of our eyes, what we thought was a little girl come down
the hall and</b>
<br><b>just stand and watch us. But when we looked directly toward her
she would</b>
<br><b>just vanish. My wife was pregnant during all this. After our son
was born</b>
<br><b>things got even more strange. dorrs opened and closed by themselves,
things</b>
<br><b>disappeared and reappearded in strange places, my weeding rings
disappeared</b>
<br><b>off of my finger, it was gone for monthes, I finnaly found it under
an old</b>
<br><b>piece of carpet we had under the kitchen sink. It was just as shiny
and</b>
<br><b>polished as the day I got it. Then, one night as my wife and I were
sleeping</b>
<br><b>in bed, she woke up to me thrashing around and when she tried to
wake me</b>
<br><b>,she heard a voice come from me, but not my voice, I said "Fuck
you, okay?</b>
<br><b>Fuck you". and then I was just sleeping soundly, she shook me forever
before</b>
<br><b>I woke up. She told me the what happened and I couldn't sleep afterthat,
I</b>
<br><b>grabbed a bible and held it all night aas she slept on the couch
and I kept</b>
<br><b>watch over the kids. A few nights afterthat. I was sitting up when
my wife</b>
<br><b>was out with her girlfriends, as I sat on the couch there were 3
very loud</b>
<br><b>and hard raps on the front door. My skin turned cold when I heard
them and I</b>
<br><b>walked to answer the door, just as I reached for the knob I felt
something</b>
<br><b>touch the back of my legs, I whirled around but nothing was there,
just then</b>
<br><b>I heard the little girls voice again, this time it was very stern
saying</b>
<br><b>"Don't let him in". I looked out the window and there was no one
at the</b>
<br><b>door.&nbsp; This was all about 4 years ago, my wife and I split
up about 2 years</b>
<br><b>ago, she still lives there, still experiences noises and footsteps,
But, so</b>
<br><b>do I where I am at now. I think whatever or whoever Has caused all
this has</b>
<br><b>been following me since I was a kid, There is more, lots more. But
I will</b>
<br><b>tell it on another day......</b>

20 year</b>
<br><b>anniversy of my grandpa. there was me Chrisy my mom and my best
friend Nick,</b>
<br><b>and me and nick we sitting there on bean bags and hes like "Hey
LeAnne STOP</b>
<br><b>IT! dont poke..ow dont pinch! and turned around and hit me. i asked
him what</b>
<br><b>was wrong and he said that someone was doing something to him and
i told him</b>
<br><b>it wasnt me cause i was trying to watch the movie. my mom was in
the other</b>
<br><b>room doing dishes and she screamed so i ran in and asked her what
was wrong</b>
<br><b>she said something was on her shoulder and she looked and it left.
then we</b>
<br><b>all kept hearing someone knocking on the doorwall and the doors
and what</b>
<br><b>sounded like a gun going off but when i looked out side there would
of been</b>
<br><b>feet prints cause there was snow on the ground..but nothing. then
we seen a</b>
<br><b>mysterious light coming through the front door window onto the wall
but there</b>
<br><b>was no cars or anything out side. by this time i was really scared.&nbsp;
then my</b>
<br><b>mom went downstairs to do some laundry and keep this in mind we
have a</b>
<br><b>dropped cealing. and there was pounding on the floor pretty loud
to. so me</b>
<br><b>and nick ran down stairs to see what she wanted and shes like ok
guys stop</b>
<br><b>doing this to me its not funny im scared. and she also said that
theres no</b>
<br><b>way she could of done it cause where the pounding was the laundry
room is</b>
<br><b>pretty far away from it and she wouldnt have had enough time to
put the</b>
<br><b>ceiling panel back up. so we were trying to not think about it.
then we got</b>
<br><b>done playing twister and the floor started to vibrate, just like
a giant</b>
<br><b>pager going off. and christy flew on top of me, nick and my mom
and we</b>
<br><b>started shaking and crying. then that stopped and the lights went
off and on</b>
<br><b>within a peroid of 45 seconds. so we went looking around the house
and went</b>
<br><b>into my grandpa's old room and when ever the power goes out u have
to reset</b>
<br><b>the digital clocks and your stove and so on. but the clock in my
grandpa's</b>
<br><b>room read the right time and all the others were blinking i flipped
out when</b>
<br><b>i saw that. so we go back in the front room and my mom went to get
some</b>
<br><b>drinks and shes like guys come here so we walked in and the cat
food was</b>
<br><b>thrown all over the floor and she opened the fridge and a beer flew
out and</b>
<br><b>there was only one in there and she keeps it in the WAY back. so
my mom was</b>
<br><b>starting to tell us that my grandpa that i never saw cause he died
before i</b>
<br><b>was born, died in this house 20 years ago and he was an alcholic.
we took</b>
<br><b>nick home about 2ish he called and hour later and said hes pretty
sure the</b>

it sounded</b>
<br><b>like someone trying to open a bag of chips so he flew out. and every
now and</b>
<br><b>then odd stuff happens. and this happened in the summer of 2000
nick was</b>

<p><b>Bedroom Set</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jwlrbnch@wctc.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was about 6 years old I remember that my parents bought an
antique bedroom set.I use to sleep in that room alot(I come from a family
of 8 children)One night I went to bed , alone, and after being in bed awhile
( I've always been somewhat of an insomniac) I remember looking up because
I noticed the room became a bit brighter and standing in front of my mothers
dresser ( it is a low dresser with a big mirror on it) was a young woman
with long black hair just standing there and brushing her hair. I was'nt
scared at all I remember , in fact I just kept lying there and watched
her. I couldn't believe my eyes. I even covered my head with the blanket
and then uncovered my head but she was still there. At that point she turned
and looked at me and smiled and then continued brushing her hair . I had
no idea who this was. I noticed she was wearing a long blue nightgown (
which happened to be sort of almost be glowing blue ) It must have been
the smile or maybe that she didn't seem to pay much attention to me , but
I got out of bed and walked over to her and tried to tug on her nightgown
to get her attention but my hand went right through as if nothing was there
,but she was still there.Again she looked down at me and smiled. Again
, maybe because she smiled at me, I wasn't scared at all, so I got back
into bed and just went to sleep.I never told anybody. About 15 years later
my parents asked me to stay at their house while they were on vacation,
so I did. I slept in that same room that had that same furniture , without
even a thought of my past experience.Nothing happened during the night.
I was however expecting my girlfriend&nbsp; at the time to stop over in
the morning. So when I woke up to being kissed on the cheek I wasn't a
bit alarmed . However , I rolled over , expecting to see my girlfriend
, and no one was there . I thought maybe she was playing a trick on me
and began looking throughout the house for her , I even went outside to
look but no one was around but me . I was kind of freaked out so I called
her house ( not expecting her to be there ) and to my surprise she answered
the phone .Now I'm sure alot of people would say I was dreaming ( in both
cases ) but I am absolutely positive I wasn't . I am 37 years old now and
I can remember both as if they happened last night . I never told anyone
about this until I was probably about 30 at which time I told my older
brother , and to my surprise he believed me . I've maybe told 5 or 6 others
about it but each time I do , it just gives me the chills for some reason.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Truely Real with Two Witnesses</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: foxie_kiss@hotmail.om</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have always convinced myself that the dark nights
hold&nbsp; creatures that</b>
<br><b>humans have never seen. Have you ever asked yourself what IS fear?
Fear is yet</b>
<br><b>simple. We only fear things cause we have not yet experience them
or Fear can be</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;we do not have knowledge of it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was only about a year ago when i was only
15. The streets were vacant</b>
<br><b>infront of my house and since I lived out in the country and not
really had a</b>
<br><b>curfew... I decided to take a little walk. I left my house not aware
what the</b>
<br><b>eerie night was going to show me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose it was about 12: 35 when I had
left my house. Very few cars drove</b>
<br><b>down at this time at night, and when they did I would sink into
the shadows not</b>
<br><b>to be picked up.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down the road from me, a new golf corse was being
constructed. They had not</b>
<br><b>clear all the forestry, but a&nbsp; few vacant pacthes here and
there of open fields</b>
<br><b>were exposed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is when I had my first encounted with fear.
It was quiet and still that</b>
<br><b>night. A car from on top of the hill was running down and I ran
off to the side</b>
<br><b>to hide that contained the golf corse construction. I watched the
car flash by</b>
<br><b>and finally I returned to the road's side.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I then heard breaking sticks and body movement
somehwhere not far from were</b>
<br><b>I was hiding. My first impalse was to turn to come across an animal
I&nbsp; would be</b>
<br><b>fimilar with. But my felt my heat sink way down with in me when
i did not see</b>
<br><b>anything. I walked a little closer towrds the the centure on the
left lain to</b>
<br><b>make sure I would not encouter it again. A few kilometers down the
road I felt</b>
<br><b>as though I was being wacthed from not a far distnace and being
followd. My</b>
<br><b>heart race just a little but I tried to keep myself under controll
and not to</b>
<br><b>panic hopefully over a obevies animal.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then came the heart renching sound. A cry
of a non-human non-animal rang</b>
<br><b>through the air as if it were waring or claming its attack. I jump
towrds the</b>
<br><b>centure line of the road. The scream went through my entire body
sending the</b>
<br><b>coldest chills possible down my spine. I could'nt think of any animal
it could</b>
<br><b>be. More scraping in the woods was heard. I swallowd hard and walked
on trying</b>
<br><b>to keep my distance from the open feild i was now paralle too. It
called out</b>
<br><b>again a few seconds later. I jump and ran to the opposite side of
the road.</b>
<br><b>Minutes past and i started to settle down. I had not heard anymore
sounds for a</b>
<br><b>mile or two.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I reached a lighted intersection of the street
where I stopped to&nbsp; calm</b>
<br><b>myself more before I continue on.&nbsp; Another car was in the distance
on the right</b>
<br><b>lane and there was no place to hid... Before I came into it;s veiw,
i ran across</b>
<br><b>the road to the opposit side. I&nbsp; slumped in the ditch and waited
for it to go</b>
<br><b>by. The car passed and continued out of sight. I brushed clumpes
of dried dirt</b>
<br><b>off of me and got back up. The right side of the street had more
house</b>
<br><b>bordering the road. The left side was vacant and contained more
fields to come.</b>
<br><b>I decided to stay on the left side to advoid coming incontact with
people and</b>
<br><b>there for getting repeorted to the police as tresspassing.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had only just stepped into the shawdows when
the scream once again</b>
<br><b>returned. I almost lost my breath when another car speedliy was
coming towrds me</b>
<br><b>on the left lain and no time to run across the road. My only options
were to</b>
<br><b>hide in the ditch and hope that the noise wont come to close.. or
stand there</b>
<br><b>hoping I would not get picked up. I took my chances and hid the
the ditch. The</b>
<br><b>car seemed more slow then the others that had passed by earlier.
As it neared me</b>
<br><b>it slowed down. I held my breath hoping I was not sighted.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard leaves scattering and twigs cruching
under some weight. I encourage</b>
<br><b>the car to go on.. Why was it taking to so long.. Why was it almost
stopping at</b>
<br><b>this point. The scream wailed right behind me only a few feet away.
I screamed</b>
<br><b>out. I never thought I would. The car slightly passed me and I jump
out right</b>
<br><b>behind it and race to the other side. I was about 2 miles away from
my house now</b>
<br><b>and the screams still followd me on the ooposite side.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My fear died down again as I had not heard the
cries for some time again. I</b>
<br><b>was all well till I heard some groaning sounds on the right side
now as I passed</b>
<br><b>an open feild between two houses. It was coming towrds me.. The&nbsp;
that scream</b>
<br><b>called out. It seem like it had lavitaed over my head to the other
side. I</b>
<br><b>didn;t know how long I could bare it. I walked in the centure holding
my breath</b>
<br><b>waiting for more&nbsp; wailing.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt releived when I saw one of my friends
houses up the road. I then</b>
<br><b>started running with out looking around or listening for the cries.
I approuched</b>
<br><b>his house not expecting to go up and accaully invite myself in since
it was now</b>
<br><b>2 o'clock. But luckiely he was just camping out in his back yard
with his</b>
<br><b>cousin. He heard my footsteps and suddenly appeard at the side of
the road. The</b>
<br><b>shocked expression on his face had me explain what i was doing out
this late...</b>
<br><b>Then when I explain to him I was being followd and he disbelived
me and said I</b>
<br><b>was just paranoide.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I realy don't know what encourged me to go on
but I told him I was going to</b>
<br><b>keep walking. He decided to go along with me not only cause at that
time he had</b>
<br><b>a slite crush on me but to keep me calm. Only a few yards from his
house while</b>
<br><b>walking on the right side again we come apon a grape vineyard. We
stood for a</b>
<br><b>few seconds&nbsp; while he tried to convince me to go back at my
house, but I turned</b>
<br><b>that option down. I did not want to return to my house by myself
now that I was</b>
<br><b>about 4 miles away from home.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We saw a truck's head lights gradually move down
the paved road and we both</b>
<br><b>walked backwards into the grapevines. The cry yelled out again.
I saw his eyes</b>
<br><b>grow big with fear..."What the hell was that?" I saw him shake a
little too. I</b>
<br><b>did not reat the same way this time and i am not sure why&nbsp;
I was a little more</b>
<br><b>calm then him now. I told him I decided that I would walk a little
more and then</b>
<br><b>return home. The fact that he was a guy made it interesting that
I had to walk</b>
<br><b>him back espacailly when I was the one being followd all night.&nbsp;
I walked him</b>
<br><b>home and decided when I got there to return home before the sun
would rise. I</b>
<br><b>was about halfway between the two points when the sound was clearer
as a bell</b>
<br><b>and surrounded me. My heart hurt as it raced in my chest. I held
my hands over</b>
<br><b>my ears trying to drowned the sound out. I could still hear it .
I pressed</b>
<br><b>harder and took off in the middle of the roadand ran all the way
home.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hit my drive way and ran into my lighted path
way. I ran inside of the</b>
<br><b>house and vowed never to return to the&nbsp; night road again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a true story and there has been two witnesses.
Although I had never</b>
<br><b>found out what makes those sounds.. I would be more prepared to
face it the next</b>
<br><b>time if I ever cross over it again.</b>

<p><b>Old Mans Face</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: visuals4u@earthlink.net]</b><b></b>
<p><b>back in 83 my brother and i were renting an old apartment in downtown
mansfield mass. the apartment itself was kind of spooky as it had a hallway
that lead to nowhere and a small, hinged door (about 1by1') that lead into
darkness. i always felt that i was'nt alone-being watched, and when this
feeling was really intense my hair would stand up and i would"freeze",unable
to move. well, one night my bro had'nt returned home after work and i went
to bed. just as i started to drift off this old man was right in my face,
yelling something at me, and with my eyes shut i could see every one of
the many wrinkles on his face-not like a dream, but like looking at a hi
res photo. i could'nt tell what he was yelling, just a lot of loud jumble.
this was the most scared i've ever been. a few weeks later my bro &amp;
i both had a few days of at the same time so we went on a fishing trip.
while sitting around drinking beer he said to me-ed,i had the wierdest
thing happen to me one night at the apartment, and he proceeded to tell
me about the same exact thing that happenend to me-he described the old
mans face exactly as i had seen it. i had never mentioned my incident at

<br><b>Weird Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: necronomicon17@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi.&nbsp; I have a story, it's not so much creepy, as weird.&nbsp;
Here goes.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Seven years ago, my brother, Paul, was killed after a fire occured
in his</b>
<br><b>apartment.&nbsp; He was away at college in Arizona, and my family
lives in</b>
<br><b>Pennsylvania.&nbsp; Since Paul was so far away when he died, we
had his body</b>
<br><b>cremated, and sent home, along with most of his belongings that
were not</b>
<br><b>damaged in the fire.</b>
<br><b>About two months after his death, my mom and I both smelled a strange
scent.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; It smelled like something had been smoldering, and suddenly
cooled off,</b>
<br><b>like the smell after you blow out a candle, only VERY strong.</b>
<br><b>My brother, Mike, who had flown to Arizona prior to the accident,
recognized</b>
<br><b>the smell.&nbsp; It was the way Paul's apartment smelled after the
fire.&nbsp; We took</b>
<br><b>out some of Paul's things that had been taken from his apartment.&nbsp;
They all</b>
<br><b>had that smell, but none were strong enough to have been recognized
from the</b>
<br><b>boxes they were packed away in.</b>
<br><b>A year later, my other brother, Andrew, moved his room into Paul's
old room</b>
<br><b>on the second floor.&nbsp; He suffered from nightmares, and noises
in his room.</b>
<br><b>The smell was strongest in that room, too.&nbsp; When Andrew moved
into his own</b>
<br><b>apartment, I moved into Paul's old room. (it was the biggest bedroom
besides</b>
<br><b>my parents)&nbsp; I didn't have any nightmares, but I often heard
voices, and</b>
<br><b>felt very cold.</b>
<br><b>One night, the bathroom faucet turned on full power and woke me
up.&nbsp; When I</b>
<br><b>got up to turn it off, I felt a sudden chill run up my back, then
sudden</b>
<br><b>warmth, and the smell had returned.&nbsp; I felt unusually comfortable,and
went</b>
<br><b>back to sleep.</b>
<br><b>Paul's old punching-bag, which hung in the basement, would also
sway, as</b>
<br><b>though someone had just finished using it.&nbsp; The chain it hung
from made very</b>
<br><b>loud creaking noises when it would sway.</b>
<br><b>Three years ago, my dad passed away due to lung cancer.&nbsp; He
had passed</b>
<br><b>quietly while in a hospital bed in out home.&nbsp; a year ago, my
mom was trying</b>
<br><b>to finish a roll of film, so she began taking useless pictures around
the</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; When we got them developed, a strange mist was on the
pictures.</b>
<br><b>Primarily in the spots where my dad spent his most time.&nbsp; (around
the piano,</b>
<br><b>in the back bedroom where he slept while sick, and on the couch.)&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>friend, who is into the paranormal, analyzed the photos, and said
it was an</b>
<br><b>"Ectoplasm" in the pictures.</b>
<br><b>My dog also often stares at the wall, or down the hallway, wagging
her tail.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Just recently, I began asking her, "Is daddy home?" and she
would get very</b>
<br><b>excited and began whining.&nbsp; For awhile, we thought she was
seeing a</b>
<br><b>reflection or shadow.&nbsp; But now, I believe that there is something
else.</b>
<br><b>Possibly two somethings.&nbsp; I've gotten into the habit of talking
to them when</b>
<br><b>i feel they are around.&nbsp; Even if it is only my imagination,
it is somewhat</b>
<br><b>comforting to think they are still with me.</b>

<p><b>Dark Shadow</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Ssing@rci.rogers.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello . I just read your story on shadowlands. And it really struck
me. Well</b>
<br><b>first of all I am 28 and all my life I have had really strange experiences.</b>
<br><b>I am not sure why they happen to me. My best friend of 16 years
feel a</b>
<br><b>kinship with each other ,though her experiences have not been as
horrifying</b>
<br><b>as mine. We have shared quite a few of the same experiences together.</b>
<br><b>First of all getting back to what you call the grim reaper. I myself
don't</b>
<br><b>feel what I saw was the grim reaper ,though our descriptions are
almost</b>
<br><b>exactly alike. I believe their are different levels .Those that
were once</b>
<br><b>living ,like us and the others that were never living . I am not
sure how</b>
<br><b>much you know of the bible. I do not read the bible regularly or
can I say I</b>
<br><b>go to church regularly ,but the way I was brought up and going to
a all</b>
<br><b>girls catholic school . I do have alot of background knowledge.</b>
<br><b>Living in our old house . I had quite a few experiences. I have
always been</b>
<br><b>sensitive to these things .From the first day I moved into my house
I had</b>
<br><b>terrifying nightmares. It usually ended the same way with a large
what</b>
<br><b>seemed to be endless whole in my living room trying to pull everything
in</b>
<br><b>it. It began when I use to have felling of someone watching me.
Even during</b>
<br><b>the day I had eerie feelings. My dog would go in an attack stance
and growl</b>
<br><b>and make another weird type of noise that I could not explain .
One morning</b>
<br><b>I had just woke up automatically for some reason (it was around
six) I had</b>
<br><b>just turned to look at my alarm clock . Next to my bed side I saw
him . He</b>
<br><b>was in a large dark cloak . I could not scream ! I was paralysed
. I looked</b>
<br><b>up and tried to look into his face as well and their was nothing
their but</b>
<br><b>deeper darkness .He seems to be very tall with a hat that I could
say seemed</b>
<br><b>to be from the 18th century that just went on towering . I closed
my eyes</b>
<br><b>,and felt him touching me . I pulled the covers over my head and
said my</b>
<br><b>prayers fervently , I prayed for enough strength to do something
. Since I</b>
<br><b>was unable to move for awhile (I wish I had enough courage as you
to</b>
<br><b>confront it) I finally was able to move I grabbed the covers over
my head</b>
<br><b>and ran to my moms door pounding it ,which she did.</b>
<br><b>The second time I awoke with my bed shaking radically . Once again
it was</b>
<br><b>the same time and it was him .I prayed again ,and yes you guessed
it ran to</b>
<br><b>my moms room .(by the way this all occurred when I was around 18)
I did not</b>
<br><b>sleep in my room for awhile , to my mom's unhappiness,because she
hated me</b>
<br><b>sleeping in the living room ,which I took over at night. Well at
that time</b>
<br><b>the guy I was with (my ex ) told me he was working in Hamilton .
Which I</b>
<br><b>believed . I was asleep ,when the phone in the kitchen rang and
woke me up .</b>
<br><b>I answered but no one answered me back . So I hung up and jumped
back onto</b>
<br><b>the sofa. I barley pulled the covers over me when two spirits were
standing</b>
<br><b>infront of me. These were different .They were two men I could make
that out</b>
<br><b>.Although they were not speaking .I could here what they were telling
me .</b>
<br><b>They were laughing at me mockingly ,and told me that I was dumb
to believe</b>
<br><b>thats where he was. After I felt their presence was gone . I actually
jumped</b>
<br><b>out of bed and went to my ex's house and it was true he was not
in Hamilton</b>
<br><b>(which is an hour away from Toronto ) but at home.Well long story
their</b>
<br><b>.(which I would not get into )</b>
<br><b>My mom use to tell me that she would feel me jump into bed with
her and tell</b>
<br><b>her I was scared ,even though I would be out at nights.She as well
told me</b>
<br><b>she felt things starring at her. By the way she has had some experiences
of</b>
<br><b>her own.</b>
<br><b>We have not lived in that house in the last two years as we have
bought a</b>
<br><b>house where we are the first family to live in it. Strange things
have</b>
<br><b>started to occur . My friend was with me when we were driving down
this one</b>
<br><b>lane road late at night. I saw a white streak on the passenger side
where</b>
<br><b>she was sitting it seemed to be following us . I blinked wondering
if it was</b>
<br><b>just my eyes playing tricks on me . My friend then asked if I saw
that</b>
<br><b>(referring to the white shadow) We both came down of a dread of
fear that</b>
<br><b>something was with us . I dropped of the parcel that I had to and
had to go</b>
<br><b>back on that road the opposite way to get home . My friend asked
me if I</b>
<br><b>heard the noise at the back of our seats I said no but look back
, to my</b>
<br><b>suprize their was a man sitting in the middle .He looked as real
to me as my</b>
<br><b>friend sitting next to me . I screamed in horror . As I screamed
starring at</b>
<br><b>him he just disappeared. My friend was asking it at this time to
leave ,as</b>
<br><b>no one wanted him here. As we looked on my side going back we saw
what we</b>
<br><b>never noticed before a cemetery . We told the story to my mom .
She believes</b>
<br><b>it might of been a spirit that wanted to go along for the ride.</b>
<br><b>That event just happened recently ,but we have had other instances
together</b>
<br><b>, like the doughnut that levitated off our plated (about five inches
and</b>
<br><b>then fell back on it ) .But thats another story .</b>
<br><b>Getting back to the dark figure my mom believes it is the same she
saw</b>
<br><b>before I was born .You see I come from a family that has many diverse</b>
<br><b>background . Basically South american . My dad is chinese and my
mom on her</b>
<br><b>dad side is chinese and Indian and her mom (my grandma ) is hispanic</b>
<br><b>/english /german /and egyptian . My parents including my older sister
are</b>
<br><b>not dark at all .unlike myself . Though I have asian features .
(been told I</b>
<br><b>look Hawaiian alot!) My mom said that when she was pregnant a dark
shadow</b>
<br><b>also came to her and through mind thought also told her that I would
be born</b>
<br><b>dark unlike everyone else in my family . But she said he was not
coming as a</b>
<br><b>friendly messenger as she felt pure eveil throughout . This scares
me as it</b>
<br><b>involves me !</b>
<br><b>In our new house .like I said small things have been occurring .
I sleep</b>
<br><b>with my lights on ,but even that sometimes is not comforting. I
was watching</b>
<br><b>tv during the day when I heard the door opening ,I thought it was
my mom . I</b>
<br><b>even shouted "HELLO" from upstairs . Unlike my mom it ignored me
and started</b>
<br><b>talking to my dog (or should I say my mom' s precious baby ) My
dog was</b>
<br><b>becoming irritated I could tell .I realised it was not my mom .
As weird as</b>
<br><b>it seems my mom and I really pamper our dog as he is a little guy
:):) a</b>
<br><b>Japanese Spaniel . I decided I had to go and face it . I practically
stormed</b>
<br><b>down the stairs ,ready to confront anything , as soon as I reached
it was</b>
<br><b>gone and my dog was quiet .</b>
<br><b>I can't believe out of my entire family only my mom and I experience
these</b>
<br><b>occurrence,and yes maybe the dog (but he can't say anything ) I
sense and</b>
<br><b>feel things around me . I wish it was not be these things happen
to .</b>

<br><b>The Witch Tree</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: knightz@mediaone.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.&nbsp; I first saw the Witch Tree when
I was about</b>
<br><b>13 years old, about 6 years ago.&nbsp; I was visiting my cousin
in Cape Hatteras</b>
<br><b>and we were going on a ride around the town.&nbsp; We picked up
a couple of her</b>
<br><b>friends and they all said "Has Jen seen the Witch Tree?" and my
cousin said</b>
<br><b>"NO!"&nbsp; So they all said, well let's go by and see it so she
can see it for</b>
<br><b>herself.&nbsp; So while they were driving there, they were telling
me the story</b>
<br><b>about the tree.&nbsp; It goes like this.&nbsp; There was a lady
accused of being a</b>
<br><b>witch a long time ago, back around the witch trials time.&nbsp;
People started</b>
<br><b>accusing her and came to her house and drove her out of the house
to burn</b>
<br><b>her.&nbsp; They all came to a big oak tree and tied her to the tree.&nbsp;
As they</b>
<br><b>were about to start the fire, she started mumbling words, probably
a curse,</b>
<br><b>and as she finished, a big flash of lightening came down from the
sky.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>hit the tree and as the smoke started to fade, the lady was gone
and the</b>
<br><b>ropes on the tree were still in the position they were while she
was</b>
<br><b>standing there, untouched by the lightening.&nbsp; But on the big
oak tree was</b>
<br><b>most frightening thing of all, her name Lorena was engraved into
the tree.</b>
<br><b>It was so deep that no one could have even carved that name in that
far.</b>
<br><b>And as for her curse, her cat was supposed to guard the tree for
the rest of</b>
<br><b>eternity.&nbsp; And they said if you still go there, the cat is
still guarding</b>
<br><b>the tree, lurking in the branches above.&nbsp; So to finish my story,
my cousin</b>
<br><b>and her friends took me to this tree which was right in the middle
of the</b>
<br><b>street.&nbsp; Everyone was scared to move the tree when they started
building</b>
<br><b>homes there, so they built around it.&nbsp; And let me tell you,
this tree was so</b>
<br><b>big and just flat out scary.&nbsp; It was dark and looked dead.&nbsp;
And with my own</b>
<br><b>eyes, I saw the name of the witch written on the tree.&nbsp; It
was not fake at</b>
<br><b>all.&nbsp; You could see that it went through the tree deep into
the core of the</b>
<br><b>tree.&nbsp; And all of a sudden I heard a cat hissing.&nbsp; Everyone
got scared and</b>
<br><b>said to get out of here.&nbsp; And right as we were leaving the
cat jumped onto</b>
<br><b>the hood of the car.&nbsp; Glaring into the window at all of us.&nbsp;
So we sped off</b>
<br><b>and got out of there as fast as we could.&nbsp; I will never forget
that moment</b>
<br><b>at all.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Winchester Mystery House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Ryan_Bontrager@cccpp.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I was checking out http://www.theshadowlands.net and saw your write
up on</b>
<br><b>the Winchester Mystery House (or the Minchester Whiskey house as
my friends</b>
<br><b>and I call it) and thought I would send you the story of my experience
at</b>
<br><b>the house.</b>
<br><b>I was taking the tour of the house with two of my buddies Rich and
Dave in</b>
<br><b>the fall of 1997. My experience took place in one of the front rooms
of the</b>
<br><b>house, it was towards the end of the tour and I was getting rather
board of</b>
<br><b>the tour guide and found myself not really paying attention to him
or anyone</b>
<br><b>else in the room. I was snapped out of my little day dream when
I felt a</b>
<br><b>hand on my left shoulder. It was like someone was comforting me,
not strong</b>
<br><b>or forceful, but a nice firm grip. I plainly felt the fingers and
thumb of</b>
<br><b>this hand and I could tell it was a left hand. It only lasted only
a moment</b>
<br><b>until I started to look for the source of the hand. My back was
to the wall</b>
<br><b>and only Rich was in arm's length of me but he was on my left and
there was</b>
<br><b>no way he could have touched me with his left hand. I quickly placed
the</b>
<br><b>experience in the back of my mind as the tour moved on. Once outside
Rich</b>
<br><b>made the comment that the front room gave him the chills but to
Dave and I</b>
<br><b>the room felt no different than the rest of the house. When I told
them</b>
<br><b>about what I felt in the room they thought I was just playing on
Rich's</b>
<br><b>comment of the chills and didn't believe me. I don't talk about
it much</b>
<br><b>although I do believe in ghosts, heck I live 1/4 of a mile behind
the</b>
<br><b>Brookdale Lodge and have heard the ghosts that are there when I
go to play</b>
<br><b>darts in the Lodge's Bar but that's another story.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Turkey Herder</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: EAMBLAKE@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have always believed in the supernatural. I love reading ghost
stories, and</b>
<br><b>am quick to believe them. My Grandmother whom is one of the sanest
women on</b>
<br><b>earth has had ghostly encounters, and I fully believe that there
are many</b>
<br><b>things we cannot explain. I have spent most of my life looking for
a ghost</b>
<br><b>encounter of my own.</b>
<br><b>I have had only one experience that I can say, reflecting back on
it, was a</b>
<br><b>ghostly encounter. I remember the day clearly. I hadn't had any
caffine and</b>
<br><b>my head felt hollow, yet full of pain. I felt almost sick my head
hurt so</b>
<br><b>badly. My sister was driving us home from a day out doing something-it
was</b>
<br><b>still light out- but approaching sunset. I was fully conscious-yet
in agony.</b>
<br><b>Driving along RT 9 in Wellesly MA. I looked out the window and saw
wild</b>
<br><b>turkeys pecking along on the sidewalk. I have seen wild turkeys
before -years</b>
<br><b>ago- and knew what they looked like. I sat up and stared at them
as we wizzed</b>
<br><b>by. I also saw a man in blue clothes herding them it appeared. His
clothes</b>
<br><b>were pretty non-descript- they looked like clothes that could have
been worn</b>
<br><b>anytime after the Civil War up until recently. I recall he had on
a hat,</b>
<br><b>jacket and pants. The man and birds were solid in form.</b>
<br><b>There were at least a dozen turkeys. I mentioned them to my sister
as we</b>
<br><b>drove past. She said- "No way do I believe that! Turkeys? I've got
to see</b>
<br><b>them." She got to the first place she could turn around and maybe
3 minutes</b>
<br><b>later we drove by the same place. There was nothing there. It had
appeared</b>
<br><b>the man was going down one of the side streets. There was no trace
of him or</b>
<br><b>the turkeys anywhere. There is no way even in the 3 minutes or so
that they</b>
<br><b>could have all vanished if they were alive. The turkeys were spread
out for</b>
<br><b>quite a distance away from the man.</b>
<br><b>My sister brushed it off as some sort of hallucination-due to my
frame of</b>
<br><b>mind. Why in the world would I hallucinate about turkeys? I am convinced
that</b>
<br><b>it was because my mind was in an altered state that I was able to
see them. I</b>
<br><b>know they weren't something I dreamed up. Every time I drive past
that</b>
<br><b>section of RT 9 I still look and try to catch a peek again of the
turkey</b>
<br><b>herder.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Train</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: petemc@cintranet.co.uk</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When I was a teenager I had a girlfriend who lived 20 miles away
at Park</b>
<br><b>Gate. To get too and from there I used the train from Cosham to
Swanick</b>
<br><b>station. On this particular Sunday evening I arrived at 11:00 pm
on Swanick</b>
<br><b>station, it was unusual for anybody else to be there at this time,
but a lady</b>
<br><b>in her late 40's or early 50's was also waiting for the last train.
She was</b>
<br><b>about 5ft 4 inches tall, wearing a "camel" coat and had a very large
shopping</b>
<br><b>bag, which had a tartern pattern on. I sat down to wait for the
train (which</b>
<br><b>were frequently late). After a few minutes the lady asked if there
was a</b>
<br><b>train as she "had to get back to Portsmouth". I told her that I
was also</b>
<br><b>waiting for the same train and that it should be along soon. Several
times</b>
<br><b>she asked the same question and reinforced that she "must get back
to</b>
<br><b>Portsmouth". When the train eventually did arrive, she remained
seated but</b>
<br><b>started to cry. I told her that this was the last train, but several
times</b>
<br><b>between sobs she said "I can't go back". I asked if I could help,
and</b>
<br><b>suggested that if she got on the train that perhaps we could talk
about any</b>
<br><b>problems she had. But again she repeated "I can't go back". Meanwhile
the</b>
<br><b>guard had got off of the train to point out that this was the last
on that</b>
<br><b>night and that if we were getting on we should hurry. Reluctantly
I got on</b>
<br><b>the train, and as it pulled out of the station I could see her sobbing.
On</b>
<br><b>the journey home I felt guilty about leaving her, as she was obviously
very</b>
<br><b>upset about something. On arriving home at Cosham I telephoned the
Police at</b>
<br><b>Park Gate and briefly related the story and asked if perhaps somebody
could</b>
<br><b>visit the railway station and see if she was ok. I gave a description
of her</b>
<br><b>height, dress, and the bag she was carrying. I assumed that perhaps
some</b>
<br><b>domestic dispute was the cause of her distress. On arriving home
from work</b>
<br><b>the next evening my mother drew my attention to an article in the
local</b>
<br><b>paper, "The Evening News". She knew that I caught the train from
Swanick and</b>
<br><b>this article was appealing to witnesses to an accident at that station.
I</b>
<br><b>immediately recognised the photograph included in the article as
the lady</b>
<br><b>from the previous evening, the description of her clothing, height,
bag also</b>
<br><b>matched. The article was appealing for witnesses to an accident
where the</b>
<br><b>lady had been killed whilst walking along the railway lines....
ON THE</b>
<br><b>SATURDAY EVENING. I telephoned the newspaper and suggested that
they had</b>
<br><b>confused the dates, and that I had spoken to the lady, they checked
and to my</b>
<br><b>suprise confirmed that the accident had been on SATURDAY. I then
telephoned</b>
<br><b>the police who listened to my story, and indeed confirmed that I
had reported</b>
<br><b>the incident on Sunday evening, however were adamant that the incident
had</b>
<br><b>occurred on SATURDAY. In a subsequent article in the local paper
I learned</b>
<br><b>that the lady was called Maureen Hampton, she was a patient in a
local mental</b>
<br><b>hospital (Coldeast). She had been allowed out on the Saturday and
had been to</b>
<br><b>PORTSMOUTH. Returning in the evening, she had missed the station
at Swanick</b>
<br><b>and got off of the train at the next stop (Bursledon), not being
familiar</b>
<br><b>with the area she had decided to walk the short distance back to
Swanick</b>
<br><b>along the lines, and been struck by a train. I caught the bus home
rather</b>
<br><b>than the train from then on. I am absolutely definite that the person
I spoke</b>
<br><b>to was the same as depicted in the newspaper photograph, and description.</b>
<br><b>However the whole incident does defy an obvious rational explanation.</b>

<p><b>The Tavern Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: DemonessOfWar@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>As a child I always had a love of the supernatural (I still do) and
things</b>
<br><b>that go bump in the night. Any chance I had to scare myself or others,
I</b>
<br><b>would take. My mother encouraged such things, for she had the same
love. I</b>
<br><b>had frequent slumber parties---not with facials and truth or dare,
but with</b>
<br><b>Ouija boards and seances. During one occasion, when I was about
11 or 12, we</b>
<br><b>decided it would be a hoot to have the party at the bar my mother
worked in.</b>
<br><b>The bar had a long history, being one of the oldest bars in Philadelphia.
At</b>
<br><b>the time, it was an old run down shack of a place. The bar still
held the</b>
<br><b>scars of axes made in the days of prohibition, the walls still held
lazy</b>
<br><b>Susan's covered in cobwebs. To walk by the building, you would never
know it</b>
<br><b>was a bar. Being such an old place, it had it's death toll. According
to</b>
<br><b>stories, a shoe shine boy was beat to death on the first floor,
a woman died</b>
<br><b>in an upstairs bedroom (that apparently still held her death bed)
and other</b>
<br><b>causalities that I can no longer recall.</b>
<br><b>Well, of course, these stories were told to my friends for that
tasty fear</b>
<br><b>effect. The place was dark and gloomy (great for ambiance) and we
decided it</b>
<br><b>was time to perform the seance. Well, the ceremony went on without
any</b>
<br><b>events, except for scaring the crap out of each and every one of
us (except</b>
<br><b>maybe Mom). So we went about our night of ghost stories and other
silly girl</b>
<br><b>stuff. My friends started falling asleep one by one.</b>
<br><b>Then alone stood Amy and I. We were never much for sleep, so we
sat and</b>
<br><b>talked quietly. The room in front of us held a bed room and to the
right a</b>
<br><b>kitchen---neither one in use anymore. Slowly at first we heard springs
the</b>
<br><b>from the bed behind the closed bedroom door...as if a cat or small
animal was</b>
<br><b>walking across it.&nbsp; The stressed squeaking grew louder and
more violent and</b>
<br><b>Amy and I clung tight to eachother, then suddenly it stopped, followed
by a</b>
<br><b>loud thud. [My sleeping companions were not disturbed by any of
this...at</b>
<br><b>least that got some sleep that night.] Amy and I looked at eachother
then</b>
<br><b>violently around the room. The door to the kitchen was closed, but
across</b>
<br><b>it's glass windows I seen a figure hurry by. Now, do not misunderstand,
I</b>
<br><b>didn't see a shadow from the other side of the glass. It was as
if the figure</b>
<br><b>walked in front of the glass from our side of the room---yet no
one was</b>
<br><b>there. I screamed bloody hell (Amy did not see the figure) awakening</b>
<br><b>everyone. Through my hysterical cries my mother told us that it
was only our</b>
<br><b>imagination running wild because of the nights earlier events. Perhaps
she</b>
<br><b>was right....but perhaps not.</b>
<br><b>The bar, some years later, was sold to another owner who turned
the bar into</b>
<br><b>a lovely establishment. The upstairs that was once dull and spooky
was now a</b>
<br><b>nice game room, with a pool table and dart boards. Being of age,
I started</b>
<br><b>going to the bar every now and again. It was so different that I
forgot my</b>
<br><b>childhood fears of the place....it was so bright.</b>
<br><b>I love playing pool, so it is the upstairs that I stay when I'm
there. The</b>
<br><b>room that was once a small kitchen is now a bathroom. Taking a break
from my</b>
<br><b>game I went to the bathroom to relieve myself.</b>
<br><b>Being a woman I have to sit on the toilet seat, and unfortunately
watch</b>
<br><b>myself do so in the wall covered mirror in front of me. I've done
this many</b>
<br><b>times in this very bar. But this night, as I sat emptying my bladder,
I look</b>
<br><b>up from the floor into the mirror, to see my uninvited party guest
walking</b>
<br><b>past the length of the mirror. She (no I don't know it is a woman,
but ya</b>
<br><b>know, the story and all), stops for a just a moment, then continues
walk</b>
<br><b>until she disappears. I didn't scream, and I wasn't afraid. I think
I was sad</b>
<br><b>for a lost soul caught forever in such an unpleasant realm.</b>
<br><b>Did she recognize me? Did she come just to see me? I don't know.
I do wish I</b>
<br><b>could help her, but I cannot. I have not stopped going to the</b>
<br><b>tavern....secretly, I wait for her. Taking a little longer to wash
my hands</b>
<br><b>than I normally would.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Sweet Old Lady</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Mugzie01852@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I do have a ghost in my house, but she's o.k.&nbsp;
Let me start by saying we</b>
<br><b>bought our house a year and a half ago.&nbsp; Six months after Mrs.
Bergamini (our</b>
<br><b>invisable friend) passed away.&nbsp; When I walked into the house
the first</b>
<br><b>time...when we were just looking to buy,&nbsp; I knew this was the
house.&nbsp; It had</b>
<br><b>a wonderful feeling to it.&nbsp; So we bought it.&nbsp; About six
months went by and we</b>
<br><b>were in love with the house and yard.(Which she worked everyday
in until her</b>
<br><b>death when she was 92.)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, from out of the blue, things started to disappear.&nbsp;
I would put a</b>
<br><b>cigarrette pack down on the table, turn around and it would be gone.&nbsp;
I would</b>
<br><b>then find them in a winter jacket that I hadn't worn in months.
I thought</b>
<br><b>that it was strange..and the hair would stand up at the back of
my neck, but</b>
<br><b>I blocked it out and thought... Somehow, either myself or one of
the kids</b>
<br><b>must have unconstiously put them there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; We had tenants move in about a month after us ......and
so far nothing</b>
<br><b>was happening to them. So I thought it was just me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We then had a friend move into our finished attic.&nbsp;
We had finished the</b>
<br><b>rooms months before but our children would not sleep in their rooms.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>seven year old is slightly Autistic and the day that we finished
the room and</b>
<br><b>told him that he could sleep upstairs,&nbsp; he said he didn't want
to because he</b>
<br><b>was afraid of the ghost.&nbsp; This was very unusual for him because
he is not one</b>
<br><b>to make up stories.&nbsp; I tried talking to him but he insisted
that he sleep</b>
<br><b>downstairs.&nbsp; So I agreed.&nbsp; I can tell when there is a
problem with my son and</b>
<br><b>he was really afraid..so I didn't push the subject.&nbsp; I just
thought he would</b>
<br><b>forget about it.&nbsp; He still hasn't.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway,&nbsp; our friend and his girlfriend took
up one of the rooms.&nbsp; At</b>
<br><b>around the same time we started refinishing the house.&nbsp; Changing
wallpaper,</b>
<br><b>paint...and stain.&nbsp; That's when everything started to get worse.&nbsp;
Not only</b>
<br><b>were things happening to me...but to the tenants and our friends
as well.</b>
<br><b>The furniture would shake....pictures would visably move as if there
was a</b>
<br><b>strong breeze...when there wasn't one.&nbsp; Our tools would disappear....and</b>
<br><b>after we searched the entire house...we would find it in the room
we would</b>
<br><b>assemble in after the search.&nbsp; Baby furniture would move like
it was pushed</b>
<br><b>really hard.&nbsp;&nbsp; The children awoke at night crying that
"the person is right</b>
<br><b>there."&nbsp;&nbsp; There would be tapping on the floor beneath
our feet where ever we</b>
<br><b>went....T.V.'s would go on and off with no one touching them.&nbsp;&nbsp;
You could</b>
<br><b>hear people walking upstair! s in rooms when there was no one else
home.&nbsp;&nbsp; And</b>
<br><b>when you tried to run... it would follow you.&nbsp; There were other
numerous</b>
<br><b>things that I can't even recall right now.&nbsp; So I thought that
the old lady</b>
<br><b>really didn't like us.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Come to find out,&nbsp; I think she did.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I think she was looking out for us.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; When our friend moved in....his car caught on fire in front
of the house.</b>
<br><b>Somehow...we woke up before it was really bad.&nbsp;&nbsp; I still
don't know how.</b>
<br><b>Then....after all the work in one room was done....she left us alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;
When</b>
<br><b>we started in another room...it started again.&nbsp;&nbsp; At first
I thought that she</b>
<br><b>didn't like us changing her house around....but the way I looked
at it...if</b>
<br><b>she was going to be here...she might as well help out.&nbsp; Clean</b>
<br><b>up....babysit....anything.&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggested it to her but
I haven't got a reply</b>
<br><b>yet. :-)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Anyway....when we started the new room....at the same time
I made a</b>
<br><b>doctors appointment for two of my children.&nbsp; They are 2 and
3 years old.</b>
<br><b>She bothered me everyday until the day that I took them for their
checkup.</b>
<br><b>At the check up....they were lead tested&nbsp; and both of them
had lead</b>
<br><b>poisoning.&nbsp; I think the old lady was trying to warn us.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I think that she</b>
<br><b>took our tools and shook the furniture to try to get us to stop
doing things</b>
<br><b>that could hurt our children.&nbsp; We didn't know we were doing
it.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I think</b>
<br><b>she did.&nbsp;&nbsp; She hasn't done anything like moving pictures
or shaking furniture</b>
<br><b>since the kids went to the doctors.&nbsp;&nbsp; But she still takes
my cigarette packs.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I guess you can't win them all!!!!!</b>

<br><b>The Strange Night Hauntings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ErinKOC@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>The house I live in isn't very old. It is about 25 years old. Yet
strange</b>
<br><b>noises and footsteps can be heard late at night.</b>
<br><b>My sister often awakes to hear somebody walking through the hallway,
and</b>
<br><b>hears them go downstairs. I didn't believe it until some things
began</b>
<br><b>happening in my room. I was listening to the radio at 11:30 when
it</b>
<br><b>mysteriously started turning on and off. I got to sleep after pulling
the</b>
<br><b>covers over my head. Later that night something was knocking and
scratching</b>
<br><b>at my door. Thinking it was my cat, I opened the door. There was
no cat in</b>
<br><b>sight. I closed the door and tumbled back into bed when the knocking
started</b>
<br><b>again. This time it was on my walls. I have seen and heard ghosts
before, but</b>
<br><b>never like this. I calmly yelled "STOP!" and it all went silent.</b>
<br><b>The next morning my sister came in to lay down until I fully awoke.
I was</b>
<br><b>facing her telling her about what happened the night before. As
if on cue,</b>
<br><b>the stuffed bunny sitting on my headboard fell down like someone
pushed it.</b>
<br><b>It was pretty steady and leaning back against some other stuffed
animals. It</b>
<br><b>had both legs wrapped around the bedpost. Someone managed to push
it.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Organ Lady and Others</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I grew up in a small town south of Austin, Texas.&nbsp; I lived in
the same house all of my life until adulthood.&nbsp; It is a late 1800's
Texas Colonial home with 5 bedrooms 3 bath and sat on, at one time, 200
acres.&nbsp; It is now condensed to about 6 acres and the house was remodled
twice while we occupied it.&nbsp; I might add that we were only the 2nd
family to&nbsp; live there.&nbsp; Anyway, my mother, one of my sisters
and myself have always been sensitive to the paranormal or spirits, if
you will.&nbsp; There was a lot of unexplainable activity in this house.&nbsp;
Anything from doors slamming, voices, faces in the windows, footsteps from
the unfinished attic, banging on the walls, cold spots, constant fighting
amongst the family, severe, severe depression, etc...</b>
<br><b>There was one room in the house that used to be the kitchen when
the house was first built and we used it as a bedroom.&nbsp; My 'sensitive
sister' and I shared the room when I was about 4 years old.&nbsp; At the
time, there was an old organ in the room that was left there by the original
family.&nbsp; It was too heavy for them to move.&nbsp; Well, my sister
&amp; I would have the same experience in this room while we were sleeping,
but only if we were there alone.&nbsp; In the middle of the night, the
organ would start playing music.&nbsp; It sounded a lot like funeral music
and there would be a woman dressed all in white with long gray/blonde hair
playing the organ.&nbsp; Once she was done (it only lasted a few seconds,
I think) she would get up, come over to the side of the bed you were sleeping
and just stare at you and then fade away.&nbsp; It was not scary at first,
but then her hair changed to black and the music was more "violent" sounding
and you could definately feel the presence of evil.&nbsp; Soon, my mother
was getting really spooked because she could hear the organ playing all
the way down the hall in her room and she had it hauled outside and put
in a pile to be burned.&nbsp; Along with it, my sister's Ouiji Board.&nbsp;
She gladly set the pile on fire.&nbsp; Everything burned except the Oiuiji
Board.&nbsp; It didn't burn and when the fire was put out, looked just
as it did when it was put in there.&nbsp; She then had my brother haul
it off to the dump.&nbsp; We were not allowed near those again!</b>
<br><b>The next thing that lies significantly in my head sounds kind of
silly, but when my sister (same one) was about 12, she got a shetland pony.&nbsp;
It was the only horse/animal in the pasture.&nbsp; At night you would hear
two horses whinnying and you would see her horse froliking and kicking
its head like it was playing with another horse.&nbsp; Several years later
one of the original daughters who grew up in the house came by because
she had heard we had renovated the house and wanted to see it.&nbsp; We
started asking her about some of the things that had happened in the house
and she truly felt that the organ lady with the gray/blonde hair was her
mother and the lady with the black hair was her grandmother.&nbsp; They
used to fight over who got to play the organ and she said that her grandmother
was an evil woman who used to lock her mother and aunts in one of the closets
in the house when they would misbehave.&nbsp; She would leave them there
for days.&nbsp; One aunt died in the closet of starvation.&nbsp; That explains
the noises in that closet.&nbsp; Anyway, she also asked if we had seen
the 'ghost horse'.&nbsp; We all looked at each other.&nbsp; She said that
one of their horses died many years ago and was buried behind the barn
(where the 'two' horses played) and after that they always heard it.</b>
<br><b>The last story I have (sorry this is so long) is when I was about
12, my sister (same one) had a mobile home on the property behind the original
house.&nbsp; She was mad at my mother for something and we got started
talking about ghosts and things that had happened to us throughout the
years and she started telling me that mom was the devil. She started spouting
off things to 'prove' it and had me scared to death! All of the sudden
the mobile home started rocking and shaking like an earthquake! It scared
us to death! She immediately started saying she was sorry, I screamed,
"In God's name, go away!" and it stopped, just as it had started. After
that she was convinced she had been taken over by an evil spirit and asked
my aunt, who had a friend who could exorcise her. So we all gathered in
the living room of the mobile home and the lady started all this talking
in tongues and there were candles lit and when she commanded the spirits
out of my sisters' body, the wind (in the house) started whipping, the
candles were blowing, it was freezing cold and the demons literally ( I
am NOT making this up, I was there!) started flying around her head and
heart refusing to leave, saying "she's ours! she's ours!" my sister was
in a 'trance' of sorts and they like sucked back into her chest and she
woke up. The lady to performed this said she had never seen that happen
to anyone, but that the exorcism didn't work, she immediately gathered
her things and left,never to have contact with my family again. Things
went even farther down hill for my sister after that. Drugs, alcohol, theft.&nbsp;
None of us are incontact with her any longer.&nbsp; She can stare right
through you. The one time my husband met her (and he is a skeptic) he said
he has never sensed such evil in a person before in his life. Like he "felt"
something other than her. Anyway. I pray for her everyday.</b>

<p><b>The Musical Poltergeist Of Tenth Street</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: artgodess60@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I am a female musician who lived several years ago in Grand Rapids,
Michigan. Being new in town, and looking for a roommate, I hooked up with
another female musician. We searched for a house to rent. She had an 18
year old son, extremely gifted musically, who would also be living with
us. We found a beautiful old house on the west side of the city, a 110
year old, yellow painted farmhouse that had been lovingly restored. The
house featured a curving, dark wood staircase, a parlor, wooden floors,
and high, narrow windows. Between the three of us, we had many instruments
including two hammered dulcimers, several guitars, drums, and my roommate's
ancient, upright piano.&nbsp; We decided to use the parlor as our music
room. My bedroom was directly above the parlor, and I slept on a Futon
frame that rested just several inches above the floor.</b>
<br><b>My roommate's son, Mark, played in a heavy metal band, but was trying
to expose himself to other types of music. He was taking piano lessons
to learn classic ragtime. He'd sit in the music room, practicing his lesson,
hammering out the bass line with the left hand, and the melody with the
right. Try as he might, he kept screwing it up, and his playing was filled
with stops and starts as he cursed under his breath, declaring that he'd
"never get it right!" We encouraged his efforts to learn ragtime, assuring
him that his practice would pay off.</b><b></b>
<p><b>One night,very close to Halloween, I was alone in the big old house.
Mark was out for the evening, and his mother was working late at her factory
job. Wanting to lay down and rest, and not be disturbed by visitors, I
turned out all the lights, except for a candle in my bedroom. I securely
locked all the doors, deadbolts as well as chain locks, and went upstairs
to lay on my Futon bed. I lay there, lightly dozing, when suddenly, I was
awakened by the sound of the piano coming through the floor, directly beneath
my head. I heard Mark playing his ragtime tune, loud, confidently, and
without any mistakes or hesitation. "He's finally got it!", I thought,
and raced out of my room to congratulate him on his efforts. I bounded
down the curved stairway, the piano playing all the while. When I got to
the bottom of the stairs, the music stopped abruptly. I stood in complete
darkness, listening to the last chords echoing in the soundbox of the old
upright.</b>
<br><b>Heart pounding furiously, I began to turn on lights. No one was
there. As it was close to Halloween, I thought perhaps Mark was playing
a joke, but the doors were still bolted from the inside. I spent the rest
of the night with the lights blazing, until Mark's mother returned home.
I began to tell her of my strange experience when she stopped me. "Please
don't say any more...", she interrupted. "I think I know what happened.
Was it the piano?" When I replied yes, she frowned and replied "Uh no."&nbsp;
She explained that they had a "family poltergeist", and that it played
music! "We weren't sure if it would follow us from the old house...", she
stated, "...but apparently it has." She said that she didn't want to tell
me, for fear that I would not want to be her roommate. "Did it sound like
Mark playing, but him playing absolutely perfectly..very fast with no mistakes?",
she asked.</b>
<br><b>She then explained that at their previous residence, many persons
had witnessed numerous similar incidents involving music. "My boyfriend
and I were practicing a Bach duet for classical guitar...", she related,
"...when we heard a very lovely, high, third part harmony coming from the
ceiling...as if a third guitarist were playing directly above us on the
second floor."&nbsp; She had also been awakened by loud drumming when her
son was not home. The incidents always seemed to be connected with Mark,
and sounded like him, but Mark playing "absolutely perfect."</b>
<br><b>She encouraged me not to be afraid, but just accept it if it happened
again. Her family considered their ghost to harmless, and somewhat whimsical.
They felt it was somehow related to the energy force of Mark, being an
extremely dynamic personality; talented, creative, and filled with boundless
youthful enthusiasm.</b>
<br><b>I moved from the house several months later, and did not have any
other experiences in my remaining time there.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Little Girl</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: wrpowers@wctc.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>The story I am about to share is not scary, and I really never thought
of it as a traditional "ghost" story.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was a young child, and I don't remember my exact
age, I often slept in my Mother's room with her. I remember going to bed
alone. While in bed, I happened to look up, and in the corner of the room,
near the foot end of the bed, I saw a young child. Her face was perfect,
and almost angelic, with kind of an iridescent hue to it. She was wearing
a light blue gown. She was standing with her hands together, as if she
were holding something small. I never saw anything, but she was holding
her hands together. She seemed to be hovering, but not high in the room,
just off the floor I was not afraid. I had always been a chicken! For some
reason, however, I wasn't afraid of her. She never tried to talk to me,
nor I to her. I remember looking away, and pulling the blanket over my
head to see if she would go away, or even to see if she was really there
at all. She was still there. I felt safe and at ease, and I fell asleep.
Normally, I would have run off scared, or at least told someone about it.
For some reason, I never told anyone else about it for years. I have 5
brothers, and two sisters, and I am very close to 2 of them. As we got
older, my brother shared a story, and I was astonished by the similarities.
In any case, I told him of my experience, and a sister also had one. All
of the experiences happened in the same room, none of us were frightened,
and they all involved a young child or woman wearing a blue gown.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will never doubt that this was a spirit of
some sort. I also feel that we all had similar experiences for a reason.
To this day, the same two siblings and I are still close. Oftentimes when
I talk to that sister, we have been doing the same things, and my brother
and I are also so much alike.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I have 5 kids of my own. I have an 8 year
old son who really is a happy go lucky type of kid. But, he hates to go
to bed alone, and his only reason is that he says that he can see people
sitting at the end of his bed. He also has said that he sees them at the
end of my bed. They never do anything, but he can't figure out who they
are. I wholeheartedly believe him. Now I can look back at my childhood
and remember things like, a particular chair rocking when no one was in
it, or feeling that someone was watching me, or having dreams that were
so real and violent that sometimes I would wonder if they were dreams or
reality. There was a long break in my life when I had no experiences, but
in the past couple of years I have had a few reminders of the past. One
dream was that my cat had gone crazy, attacking us, and biting, and all
I could do was kill it with my bare hands. So I choked it until it was
dead. I woke up, or came to, as the dead cat was hitting the floor. I heard
the thud and my hands were wet and clenched. When I was fully awake, I
couldn't move, and I didn't want to look down to see if the cat was there.
The cat wasn't.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So,
in any case, my memories of the little girl were not frightening, but I
will always wonder why I was chosen to see her, and why others in my family
have also experienced it, and why the others have not!</b><b></b>

<br><b>A Reflection</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: webmaster@kminor.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>This I am certain was an apparition, which for whatever reason decided
to appear at this time and is not connected to me in any way.&nbsp; I encountered
many direct and indirect occurrences of this nature during my lifetime.
I certainly never requested or even remotely wished to become associated
with any of these incidences.&nbsp; However, since my son looked up this
website sight, inspired by his own growing experiences, I feel compelled
to express this pleasant yet eerie event.</b>
<br><b>I awoke for some reason late at night from a sound sleep.&nbsp;
The bedroom and where I lay lie directly diagonal to the end of the couch
in the adjoining living room.&nbsp; This house was a wartime house built
to utilize effectively small house for larger families.&nbsp; At any rate
I woke and found myself feeling very cold and anxious.&nbsp; At first I
considered that I was suffering from an illness. As I began to waken, more
I noticed some movement at the end of the couch in the living room.</b>
<br><b>I felt considerably bewildered as I though I could see one of my
daughters sitting in a chair in which she was swiveling back and forth
by pushing of the couch with here feet.&nbsp; What really added to this
was it seemed as though she were fully clothed.&nbsp; Moreover, being 3:00
am, I though this rather odd.&nbsp; Therefore, I decided to get out of
the bed and began to slip on a housecoat.&nbsp; As I was doing so I could
swear, I heard her singing.&nbsp; This really sent me for a bit of a head-spin
considering I did not even know she knew how to sing.&nbsp; She would only
be around seven years old.</b>
<br><b>By this time my vision was getting very clear and there was enough
light for me to see the color of the clothing and hair color of the child.&nbsp;
The dress was blue with a white blouse underneath and she was wearing white
socks and black shiny flats.&nbsp; She had very blonde almost white hair.</b>
<br><b>This is time were started to really wonder who in the world this
child was and what in heaven name she was doing in my living room at 3:00
am singing and swinging to and fro at the end of my couch.&nbsp; This is
when I started to feel the hairs on the back of my neck tingle.&nbsp; I
started to realize that I did not have the type of chairs on which she
was swinging back and forth.&nbsp; All my chairs were standard sitting
types, no swivels.</b>
<br><b>With cautious steps, an alert senses I began to walk toward the
little person in the living room.&nbsp; I could here her singing clearer
now.&nbsp; She sang some sort of jingle, which I had never heard before.&nbsp;
As I drew nearer, I could see her face as pushed she off the couch and
spun slowly around one way and back the other on her chair.&nbsp; She was
a very pale yet pretty girl with glittery water blue eyes.&nbsp; I was
close enough to her now to settle down in front of her one my knees.&nbsp;
As I looked at her she seemed not to even know that I were there.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I felt very cold and yet I could feel such immense warmth from this little
girl in her smile and her innocence.</b>
<br><b>As I began to speak to her and ask who she was, she stopped swinging
and she looked me in my eyes then vanished.&nbsp; I just leaned there and
looked into thin air, feeling lost and very much bewildered.&nbsp; I remember
staying positioned there for what seemed an eternity.</b>
<br><b>Since that time I told many people but I still wonder why she came
to me that night.</b>

<p><b>The House Up the Street</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: okinawasml@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I live in Okinawa, Japan. Okinawa is a very haunted island there
are many stories of haunted bases, parks, roads, houses, and&nbsp; lakes.
This island is said to be haunted from many wars from the 12 century to
world war two. Well anyways to my story. I live on an Air Force base and
up the street is a hanted house. The story behind the house is there is
a samurai worrior who rides through the living room on a horse. The families
that used to live in the house were murdered by the husband/father. Both
men went crazy and murdered their family. The house now has more ghosts
that haunt it. People say it is of a young boy and girl as well as a women
who washes her hair in the sink. Many people on the island know the story
so of course it is a place many people visit.&nbsp; One night some friends
and I went by the house. I wanted to ring the door bell. I walked up to
the door with a friend and rang it but it did not work. We looked at eachother
then there was a knock on the door from the inside. We began running down
the street. We went back a couple of times but nothing else has happened.
Now I go ghost hunting with other friends almost every weekend hoping to
see a ghost. I haven't seen anything&nbsp; but have heard many strange
and unexplainable noises.</b>

<p><b>Greetings..</b>
<br><b>I'm not sure where to begin this story, so I guess I'll just</b>

<br><b>My great-grandparents owned a small cafe and barber shop on</b>
<br><b>one of the busiest streets in Ames. I was not around during</b>

<br><b>What I do remember is the feeling I had everytime my Dad</b>

<br><b>"lil" grandma and my great uncle but I hated atmosphere and</b>
<br><b>the sense of dread that came over me everytime I approched.</b>
<br><b>Becasue of this I spent the majority of my time on the front</b>
<br><b>porch watching the cars go by, and waiting for the time when</b>
<br><b>we would leave. However my Mom would shoo me back inside</b>
<br><b>telling me that I needed to be more"social". The worst ora</b>
<br><b>came from the upstairs, that's where there was 3 bedrooms</b>
<br><b>and a bathroom, I REFUSED to go alone.&nbsp; I would ask my Dad</b>
<br><b>to take me he would just look at me strange and tell me to</b>
<br><b>get my butt up there, Mom however, would gladly take me by</b>
<br><b>the hand and escort me up the long staircase. At the top was</b>
<br><b>the bathroom but I had to walk in front of my uncle's room,</b>
<br><b>it was a cold dark place that reminded me of a dungon, you</b>
<br><b>could feel the "evil" pulsate from that corner of the hall.</b>
<br><b>Well the years went on and eventually we had to move my</b>
<br><b>"lil" grandma to a nursing home and my great-uncle closer to</b>
<br><b>us so we could care for him. While we were cleaning the</b>
<br><b>house out we discovered that the former owners of the</b>
<br><b>property were two sisters and that one was mentally ill and</b>
<br><b>had commited suicide in the upstairs of the house. As</b>
<br><b>ironcic as it sounds my uncle suffered for several years</b>
<br><b>with the same mental condtion. A few years my uncle became</b>
<br><b>very sick and soon passed away, (now here comes the creepy</b>
<br><b>part), the day he died was the same day that the city</b>
<br><b>decided to tear down the old house, as if the house was part</b>
<br><b>of his soul a part of his very being.&nbsp; I now live in Ames</b>
<br><b>and this all occured 7 years ago, the lot still sits empty</b>
<br><b>to this day. After I moved down here I asked my Mom why she</b>
<br><b>never scolded me or asked questions when I wanted to guided</b>
<br><b>everywhere in the house, her reply was simple. " I sensed it</b>
<br><b>too, so I understood".&nbsp; Even now when I have to drive past</b>
<br><b>that lot I still have chills down my spine as if someone or</b>
<br><b>something is watching me.</b>

<br><b>The Haunting Grandmother</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Aznhtownguy713@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Ever since me and my brothers were little we encounter some sort
of ghost.</b>
<br><b>The first one to be encounter by the ghost was my second oldest
brother. We</b>
<br><b>were living in sacramento california at oakpark. He was about 10
or 11 years</b>
<br><b>old. My brother slept in the living room one night on the couch.
He couldnt</b>
<br><b>sleep that well his eyes would always open up when his eyes open
up he turns</b>
<br><b>to my granmothers portrait which is really big and surrounded by
red lights (</b>
<br><b>its a chinese custom to put up a dead familys picture around with
red</b>
<br><b>lights). When my brother turn to look at the picture my granmothers
face</b>
<br><b>would move and she would smile at my brother. My brother was freaked
out then</b>
<br><b>he put a blanket over his head. Then my brother took the blanket
off his head</b>
<br><b>and look back at the picture. It wasn't a good idea to look at the
picture</b>
<br><b>again. My brother then sees a ghostly figure next to my brother
laughing at</b>
<br><b>him. When that! happened he closed his eyes and ran to my parents
room and</b>
<br><b>started crying I didnt know what was going on untill he told me.
When my</b>
<br><b>brother told my parents what happened they said he was imagining
things but I</b>
<br><b>believed him he was crying and scared. We soon forgot about the
encounter</b>
<br><b>untill my dad told us that my granmother died in the same your my
brother was</b>
<br><b>born and that completely freaked us out. My Oldest brother encounter</b>
<br><b>something like that as well. He was sleeping on his bed one night
and then</b>
<br><b>his eyes just opened wide it just opened. My brother then turn to
his window</b>
<br><b>and he saw a human image standing next to his window. My brother
then got up</b>
<br><b>and checked who it was and checked on everyone in the family to
see if we</b>
<br><b>were all in bed and we were. My brother soon told my mom about it
and then my</b>
<br><b>mom told us that it was our granmother watching us but our dad didnt
want us</b>
<br><b>to believe all of that nonsense. Then it came to me. ! I was 10
years old I was</b>
<br><b>living in houston texas in anderson road. I first moved into that
new house</b>
<br><b>in that street. I was watching T.v and then I started looking at
my</b>
<br><b>granmothers picture and yes we still have it. Anywayz I looked at
it and then</b>
<br><b>I saw her face smile at me. In my head I was like this cant be happening
I am</b>
<br><b>just imagining things. But then the smile soon turns to a grin thats
when I</b>
<br><b>started to freak out I didnt have no one in my house at all. I turned
away to</b>
<br><b>watch my tv and decided to ignore the picture. Then I was thinking
in my head</b>
<br><b>something weird is about to happen and it did my whole house lights
just went</b>
<br><b>dead thats when I decided to run out of the house as soon as possible
and</b>
<br><b>when I was ouside all of the lights just turned back on that was
really</b>
<br><b>freaky. I decided to go to my friends house to wait for my parents
to come</b>
<br><b>home and I certainly was not going to go back in there. When my
parents came</b>
<br><b>home I! told them all about it they said it wasnt nothing the lights
just went</b>
<br><b>dead I was like ok fine I know they didnt believe me. 5 months later
my</b>
<br><b>second oldest brother moved in with me at that house. He was in
his room</b>
<br><b>sleeping like always his eyes would open up when something was around.
He</b>
<br><b>opened up his eyes and look around his room. My brothers first word
was I</b>
<br><b>know your around here granmother and then this red dressed lady
walked in his</b>
<br><b>room and to the closet. My brother didnt do anything he just decided
to close</b>
<br><b>his eyes and go to sleep. The next day he told me what happened
and for a few</b>
<br><b>months he decided to leave the lights on thats when I knew he wasnt
joking</b>
<br><b>around becuase I take this kind of things seriously. We then heard
from my</b>
<br><b>mom that snakes only come in the house when there is a ghost. When
me and my</b>
<br><b>brother was in the kitchen getting something to drink we walked
to the living</b>
<br><b>room and a snake apeared in the living ! room. We didnt know what
to do but</b>
<br><b>then we got some of my friends to come over and catch it and we
did we let it</b>
<br><b>free in the woods I didnt think it was right to kill it. When I
went back to</b>
<br><b>california with my brother to visit my family my uncle told me and
my brother</b>
<br><b>that my granmother cursed my family. She cursed my family because
my</b>
<br><b>granmothers son ( My dad) she didnt want my dad to marry my mom
but when my</b>
<br><b>dad disobeyed my granmother and decided to marry my mom she cursed
all of us</b>
<br><b>to be seperated and have a hard life. I believed it becuase my family
is all</b>
<br><b>sepereated all of us. I am living with my friend and I am 15. When
our family</b>
<br><b>come together we end up argueing and hating each other. My dad and
I are the</b>
<br><b>only two that really are together but not living with each other
and our life</b>
<br><b>has been hard. I believe that my granmother did curse my family
all the</b>
<br><b>things she said happened. Well that is my story I hope this is interest!

<br><b>for you and I love your site I enjoy it alot.</b>

<p><b>THE GREEN LADY</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: JeLlOdK25@ttlc.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>this story takes place in a little town on cape breton island in
nova</b>
<br><b>scotia canada called "hay cove". now you need to know that hay cove
has</b>
<br><b>a population of about 23 people and i think there is one pavement
road,</b>
<br><b>the rest are dirt. when driving through hay cove you rarely see
houses,</b>
<br><b>its just woods. the woods go on and on. the town is miles away from</b>
<br><b>anything. way out in the woods (way out means driving an hour on
dirt</b>
<br><b>road passing one house) theres a lake. on the shore there was a
house in</b>
<br><b>which a family lived, there were a mother a father and 2 kids.</b>
<br><b>one night while the kids were asleep the father went crazy (im not
sure</b>
<br><b>of the details on how he went crazy but he did). he attacked his
wife</b>
<br><b>and hacked her up with an axe, then he went upstairs and hacked
up the</b>
<br><b>kids. for a while no one knew what had happened because very few
people</b>
<br><b>ever saw the family since they lived so far out in the woods.eventually</b>
<br><b>when the kids didnt show up to school and the parents didnt keep
their</b>
<br><b>appointments people started to wonder and the families friends went
to</b>
<br><b>their house to see if they were there. they found the bodies and

up to</b>
<br><b>the house and broke in to see if there was anything there. they
saw a</b>
<br><b>green tinted figure that greatly resembled a woman standing in a

<p><b>One beautiful, starry summer night my friend Bonnie was sleeping
over. To renovate our child hood memories,</b>
<br><b>we decided to swing on my old [not to mention creaky] swing set.
Every thing was normal... then nothing was.</b>
<br><b>Bonnie abrubtly stopped swinging. Her eyes had that entranced look
and were focused on the blossoming rose-</b>
<br><b>bush in the yard.</b>
<br><b>'' Bonnie is it...''</b>
<br><b>'' Yes. She's here again.''</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; There was a young girl concealing herself in the bush. She
had almost white</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; hair&nbsp; and a white dress on. A sheer white veil covered
her lovely face. She lay her transparent hand on</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; her chest. You could see her heart beating.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Completely terrified, me and Bonnie got to the point of screaming.</b>
<br><b>I've seen that young girl even closer.I wonder why she's here. Maybe

<br><b>The Ghost of Thirteen</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: fordfans@apk.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>When I was about 12 years old, my family and I moved into an old
farmhouse standing on about twenty five acres.&nbsp; I'm not sure exactly
how old the house was,&nbsp; but the basement was made of old, hand-cut
stones. It was a big, old house with curved top entryways leading into
each room and a large wooden staircase that began as a landing, went up
about fifteen steps to another landing, then turned right and entered a
railed hallway from which you could see the whole staircase below.&nbsp;
Being the oldest child,&nbsp; I ended up with the smaller of the two upstairs
bedrooms while my parents occupied the other.&nbsp; My brother took the
downstairs bedroom.&nbsp; From my room and escecially from my bed, I could
see out to the railed hallway and to the tall open space above the staircase.&nbsp;
For a little less than a year, all was normal in the house.&nbsp; Nothing
out of the ordinary happened.&nbsp; But, after I had my thirteenth birthday....it
all began.</b>
<br><b>I was lying in my bed just about to doze off when I saw a cloud
of, what looked like smoke, drift up the staircase and linger at the top
of the landing as if it was watching me. I sat up in bed, confused, thinking
that I must be seeing things.&nbsp; The smoky cloud drifted out of my view,&nbsp;
only to come around the corner and into my room a few seconds later.&nbsp;
It came directly toward my bed at which point I recall covering my head
and screaming at the top of my lungs.&nbsp; My mother came rushing up the
steps to see what on earth was happening.&nbsp; When she reached my room
and pulled the covers from over my head, it had disappeared.&nbsp; She
dismissed it as a dream and I finally calmed down enought to drift off.</b>
<br><b>After this first episode, it only got worse.&nbsp; Each night, as
I was about to fall asleep, the cloud of smoke would drift up the staircase,
pause at the landing,&nbsp; then drift out of sight and around the corner
into my room.&nbsp; It got to the point where I was too afraid to be alone.&nbsp;
My mother began staying with me each night until I fell asleep.&nbsp; This
made me feel safe and the "ghost" never appeared while she was there with
me.</b>
<br><b>I thought things were going to be better now. This was not to be
the case.&nbsp; Now I began waking in the middle of the night to find the
cloud hovering at the foot of my bed and feeling the eerie sensation that
it was staring at me even though I never could distinguish any facial features
in the mist at all.&nbsp; The only thing I knew was that it felt menacing
and it scared me to death.&nbsp; Night after night I woke the whole house
screaming as if I was dying.&nbsp; I began to be exhausted from either
not sleeping at all or from the fitful sleep I was having when I did doze
off.&nbsp; My mother tried to dismiss the "shadow" as headlights from passing
cars but I knew better.&nbsp; Car lights went straight across anything
and everything.&nbsp; This apparition ascended the stairs, turned the corner
and entered my room through the doorway.&nbsp; It was as if it walked up
the steps like a regular person and knew right where it wanted to go.&nbsp;
It is so hard to explain, but it felt as if something or someone was in
the room with me, watching me.</b>
<br><b>My father worked the late shift and did not arrive home until around
two or three O'clock in the morning.&nbsp; My mother was so upset by these
constant fits that she began allowing me to stay up with her downstairs
to wait for my dad to arrive home.&nbsp; I think she was hoping that I
would fall asleep on the couch so that she could carry me upstairs to my
bedroom.&nbsp; One night, as I was waiting with her, I was sitting in a
rocker in the corner of the room, watching television.&nbsp; I noticed
something out of the corner of my eye and turned to see what it was.&nbsp;
There,&nbsp; in the air above the bottom landing of the staircase, hovered
the cloud of smoke, all writhing within itself as if it was angry.&nbsp;
It looked darker and more menacing than usual.&nbsp; I got the feeling
that it was mad.&nbsp; I began pointing and screaming at the cloud then
I became frozen, unable to move.&nbsp; My mother ran over to see what I
was looking at but saw nothing.&nbsp; I turned away for only a moment and
when I looked back,&nbsp; it was gone.</b>
<br><b>At this point, school was a welcome relief to me.&nbsp; I did not
want to be at home.&nbsp; I was attending a Christian school at the time
and was inundated with homework.&nbsp; One day, my mother stated that she
had to go to the store in town.&nbsp; She suggested that I stay home and
catch up with my work and that she and my brother would return shortly.&nbsp;
Being that it was a bright and sunny Saturday afternoon,&nbsp; I agreed.&nbsp;
As I sat quietly in my room working on an assignment,&nbsp; I began to
hear music boxes play.&nbsp; I didn't think too much of it because my mother
and I collected music boxes.&nbsp; I thought one of them must have been
caught and was just finishing out its wind.&nbsp; But it kept on playing
louder and louder and didn't stop.&nbsp; It was coming from my mothers
room at the other end of the hallway.&nbsp; I walked slowly toward her
room to where the sound was coming from. None of her music boxes were playing,
yet the room was filled with music that seemed to drift away and return
even more loudly than before.&nbsp; I was petrified with fear!! Leaving
everything behind,&nbsp; I ran down the stairs and out into the front&nbsp;
yard where I sat, waiting for my mother by a tree near the road.&nbsp;
I told her about my experience and once again she dismissed it as something
out of my imagination.&nbsp; But, It would not be long before she, too,
experienced her own terror in the house.</b>
<br><b>One evening I had been particularly mouthy and my mother had swatted
my behind and sent me to bed early. Neither of us was heppy with the incident
... especially me.&nbsp; I went to bed in a huff.&nbsp; What was out of
the ordinary is, this time I want to bed and fell asleep with no bother
from the ghost cloud and slept peacefully the entire night. My mother,
on the other hand, was to experience horror beyond belief.&nbsp; After
my father arrived home from work, they went to bed and the whole house
was quiet.&nbsp; Suddenly around 3 a.m. my mother woke to find herself
standing in the middle of the bedroom floor with invisible hands wrapped
around her mouth and nose. She was suffocating and was helpless to scream.&nbsp;
She struggled but could get no releif and no attention from anyone.&nbsp;
She could not pry the invisible hands from her face and yet could feel
them on her mouth as if they were real. But, no one was there.&nbsp; She
managed to struggle to the bathroom and switch the light on. She threw
herself over the sink and at that moment she was released from the invisible
grip.&nbsp; Near the verge of passing out and struggling to get her breath,
she was unable to understand what had happened.&nbsp; Almost too terrified
to move, she made her way to my room to find me sleeping peacefully. Not
once did I awaken during that night.&nbsp; My mother feels that the "ghost
girl" felt an attachment to me and was angered by what had happened earlier
that evening. It was like she was protecting me.</b>
<br><b>These occurrences lasted throughout our stay in the house. I was
afraid to be alone and afraid to sleep. Friends stopped staying the night
because of my regular night time screaming, although none of them ever
actually saw the cloudy apparition.&nbsp; Finally my parents built a new
house on another part of our twenty five acres.&nbsp; My nightmare finally
ended the day we moved out.&nbsp; To my relief the "ghost" did not follow
me as I had heard sometimes happens.</b>
<br><b>A new family moved into the home shortly thereafter. We had told
no one of the problem with the house. One day the son of the family who
was living in the house began complaining that he was upset by a ball of
smoke that followed him throughout the house.&nbsp; It wouldn't leave him
alone, he complained.&nbsp; When I heard this story I almost cried!&nbsp;
The boy was also thirteen ears old!&nbsp; Years later my mother told me
that during her nights waiting up for my father, she heard voices , men's
voices coming from inside the walls.&nbsp; She thought someone was outside,
maybe checking the meter....but in the middle of the night?&nbsp; She knew
something was wrong in the house but didnt want to scare me anymore than
I already was.&nbsp; She said she heard the voices almost nightly and sometimes
during the day but could never quite make out what they were saying.</b>
<br><b>My father nor my brother, to my knowledge ever experienced anything
strange in the house.&nbsp; Years later, I heard a rumor that the original
house, which was then over one hundred years old, had burned down and the
existing house had been built over its old foundation.&nbsp; It was also
rumored that a girl had been killed in that fire....she was thirteen.&nbsp;
No records were ever found to corrobborate these rumors.&nbsp; Could the
cloud of smoke have been the little girls spirit still haunting her old
house? Could she have been trying to watch over me? I dont know.&nbsp;
I just cannot imagine the spirit of a little girl causing such a menacing
feeling.&nbsp; The house has changed hands several times since then and
I haven't heard anymore such stories.&nbsp; I wonder if the "little lost
girl" still climbs the staircase, doomed to roam the old house for eternity?</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Ghost of Mary</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: aholcomb.astvl@us.amadeusmail.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Hi. My story is one of myself, my childhood home in Cleveland OH
and the ghost of Mary. When I was 4 years old (now 22yrs old)I was playing
one day in the spare bedroom of our home that was off of the kitchen. This
room was set up for me as a playroom. One day while I was playing my father
come in to check on me and I had told him that I was cold. This was the
case no matter what time of year or if my mom had been using the oven and
stove all day cooking, the room was always really cold. On this day of
my father checking and talking to me in our conversation he had mentioned
teasingly that it was cold because it was probably Mary's bedroom before
she died. Mary was the name of the woman who lived in the home a few years
before us with her young daughter. Mary had committed suicide and shot
herself in the head on the front porch of the home. A few months later
after mine and fathers talk my mom had rearranged the house and put my
playroom in one of the 2 upstairs bedrooms, so my bedroom and playroom
were both will swear that is what I saw...Mary. What I can't figure out
is why she only appeared to me just once or had she at other times and
I just didn't noticed after all I lived there from the time I was born
till I was almost 8yrs old. Or maybe that night she was just missing her
daughter and wanted to see a child and have her see her back...well I did
and am now a beleiver in ghosts untill someone or something can proove
differently.</b>

<br><b>The Ghost Named Cora</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tj2a@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>We lived in a farm house for fifteen years, moving in when I was
about</b>
<br><b>two.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've alway bee very interested in ghosts and felt
that maybe I</b>
<br><b>had some sort of spirit connection, though not a psycic or medium.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>began to experience odd things in my house.</b>
<br><b>My mom had told me of&nbsp; things like the basement light coming
on when we</b>
<br><b>left the louse and doors being the oposite of what she had left</b>
<br><b>them(locked to open and vise versa).</b>
<br><b>I got interested in oija boards and sayances.</b>
<br><b>Shortly there after I bad my own stories to tell.</b>
<br><b>I would see figures in the mirror standing behind me on two occasions.</b>
<br><b>The shower came on with no one in the bathroom.&nbsp; In my bedroom
the inner</b>
<br><b>wall was cold at times for no reason.</b>
<br><b>One day a friend of mine and I were siting on my bed getting ready
to</b>
<br><b>play a board game and we couldn't find the dice.&nbsp; She&nbsp;
was looking off</b>
<br><b>one side and I off the other.&nbsp; Suddenly, from the side I was
looking,</b>
<br><b>the dice come flying onto the board.&nbsp; We were the only ones
in the room,</b>
<br><b>on a second story and they came over my head from the direction
ofd the</b>
<br><b>window.</b>
<br><b>I remember a lady.&nbsp; She was small and woulld come and talk
to me.&nbsp; She'd</b>
<br><b>come from the wall that was cold.&nbsp; This would happen when I
was in bed.</b>
<br><b>She was small built and about 70-80 years old.&nbsp; She would sit
on the end</b>
<br><b>of my bed</b>
<br><b>and talk, I'd never respond and I couldn't tell you what she was
saying.</b>
<br><b>I told my mom about this.&nbsp; She believed me and seemed a little</b>
<br><b>frightened,&nbsp; But didn't really say anything.</b>
<br><b>My sister who was home from college over heard.&nbsp; This was her
room</b>
<br><b>before and had told mom the same story several years before.</b>
<br><b>I had the strange privillage of finding out who was haunting our
house</b>
<br><b>several years after.</b>
<br><b>My mom had droped me off at the hair dressers and ran to the bank</b>
<br><b>accross the street.&nbsp; The bank teller noticed her address and
began to</b>
<br><b>ask questions.&nbsp; She asked my mom if we had ever experienced
and</b>
<br><b>anything, mom asked why.&nbsp; Apparenty she was a friend of the
family</b>
<br><b>who lived there before us.&nbsp; The woman who lived there was forced
to move</b>
<br><b>out because of declining health and moved in with her daughter about
a</b>
<br><b>mile down the road.&nbsp; This woman''s name was Cora Dutt.&nbsp;
Cora was very</b>
<br><b>unhappy about having to leave the house and would be there when
