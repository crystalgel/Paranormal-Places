<b>Apt 1510</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: i.beardy@sympatico.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello. My name is Isabelle. I've a few experiences with spirits,
ouija</b>
<br><b>boards and unexplained happenings.</b>
<br><b>This one experience happened while I was living on Bank Street in</b>
<br><b>Ottawa. It was a coop builiding and it</b>
<br><b>was my first appartment. It was an eery looking building, a lot
of</b>
<br><b>people who didn't have much money</b>
<br><b>lived there. I was on the 15th floor, it was apt 1510. I didn't
sleep</b>
<br><b>there much once I found a girlfriend.</b>
<br><b>I remember that I would always sleep on the couch in the livingroom,
I</b>
<br><b>was always too afraid to go into the</b>
<br><b>bedroom. And even while I was asleep on the couch, I would wake
up</b>
<br><b>feeling as though someone was watching me,</b>
<br><b>someone was hanging over me. I felt this presence almost every night.</b>
<br><b>Especailly right beside the couch. You would</b>
<br><b>be sitting there watching t.v, or just relaxing, and you would feel
as</b>
<br><b>though someoene was standing over you. I've</b>
<br><b>had company tell me about it. I thought I was paranoid, or just
scared</b>
<br><b>of being alone in the appartment, but it wasn't</b>
<br><b>just me. Right before my year lease ended, I had a friend move in
with</b>
<br><b>me for the last two months. Her mother was</b>
<br><b>gifted. She was able to read tarrot cards, leave her body and visit</b>
<br><b>other places, read the crystal ball. In many</b>
<br><b>ways she was psychic. She was also a strong believer in God. Nathalie,</b>
<br><b>the friend that I had move in with me, told</b>
<br><b>me what she felt a presence as well, the same things I felt. I remember</b>
<br><b>when I was living alone, I would leave for work and come</b>
<br><b>home at night, everything that was around the tub would be inside
of the</b>
<br><b>tub. Shampoo bottles, soap and the stopper</b>
<br><b>for the tub would be neatly placed in the center of the tub, still</b>
<br><b>standing. I thought it might be my cats, but when it</b>
<br><b>happened on more than one occasion, I started getting freaked out.
I</b>
<br><b>remember going to the bathroom and Nathalie was</b>
<br><b>in the livingroom, I was talking to her and there was a book on
the side</b>
<br><b>of the tub. There was no reason for it to fall</b>
<br><b>because of the way that it was placed. It fell at my feet as though</b>
<br><b>someone had knocked it over. There was a presence in</b>
<br><b>that area, no where else.</b>
<br><b>Another experience happened while my roomate and I were at work.
Manon</b>
<br><b>was very skeptic about all that was going on in</b>
<br><b>the appartment and didn't believe anything that Nathalie or I said.
I</b>
<br><b>gave her the keys to my appartment and told her</b>
<br><b>that we would meet at my appartment after Nathalie and I were finished</b>
<br><b>work to have drinks. She was putting the beer in</b>
<br><b>the fridge and she said that she was worried about not getting a
job</b>
<br><b>offer that was available where she was working. She</b>
<br><b>didn't even remember what I had told her about the appartment. She
said</b>
<br><b>she was putting away the beer when she heard</b>
<br><b>something slide across the bathroom floor. It was an empty plastic</b>
<br><b>container. She said she seen in there when she came in,</b>
<br><b>but when she heard something slide across the floor she remembered.
She</b>
<br><b>looked towards the bathroom and there it was, still</b>
<br><b>sliding by itself across the room. She was so freaked, that when</b>
<br><b>Nathalie and I got back from work, Manon was standing</b>
<br><b>outside my appartment door. She told me what happened and she believed</b>
<br><b>me. She couldn't leave because she left in such a</b>
<br><b>hurry she forgot her keys and my keys. She was too afraid to go
back in</b>
<br><b>the appartment alone so she waited an hour or so for</b>
<br><b>us to get back.</b>
<br><b>Nathalie and I were in the appartment one night, I only had one
bed and</b>
<br><b>the couch was too small for her so she slept in my</b>
<br><b>bed, it was only temporary. I heard something in the room, I was
half</b>
<br><b>asleep and asked Nathalie if she was changing into</b>
<br><b>her pj's because that's what it sounded like. You know the sound
of</b>
<br><b>someone taking off their clothes?? That kind of</b>
<br><b>brushing sound?? Well that is what I heard, but I coudln't see a
thing,</b>
<br><b>and Nathalie said no, she kicked me and said that</b>
<br><b>she was right beside me and never moved. She asked me if I heard</b>
<br><b>something too. She said that she heard some sort of ticking</b>
<br><b>sound right beside her, as though someone was tapping their fingers
on</b>
<br><b>the wall impatiently. We felt such a strong presence</b>
<br><b>that we left the appartment at 3:30am and slept at her friends house.
We</b>
<br><b>were so freaked out we couldn't stay. We asked the</b>
<br><b>spirits to leave, but the more stern my voice was, the more angry
the</b>
<br><b>presence became. It made us so uncomfortable we left.</b>
<br><b>Nathalie asked her mother to come and chase them away.&nbsp; There
were three</b>
<br><b>spirits in my appartment. Two were black spirits,</b>
<br><b>very evil and one was an old man who had died of a heart attack.
He was</b>
<br><b>a short old man. I saw him once, he was sneaking into</b>
<br><b>the bedroom while I was watching t.v. I was afraid of him because
it was</b>
<br><b>a ghost, but Nathalie's mom said that he was a frienly</b>
<br><b>ghost and quite funny. She said that he protected us from the two
evil</b>
<br><b>ones. She chased him out too, but he found a way back</b>
<br><b>in. Diane is Nathalies mother's name, she told us the spirits were
gone,</b>
<br><b>but we still felt a presence. She finaly told us that</b>
<br><b>the old man would not leave. She was blessing the room and putting
holy</b>
<br><b>water in the shape of a cross towards him and he was</b>
<br><b>mocking her. SHe found it funny and knew that he was not a bad spirit.
I</b>
<br><b>let him stay. I would say hello to him when I got in</b>
<br><b>from work and asked him not to ever let me see him. I never really
seen</b>
<br><b>him, but I did see a short shadow walk in the</b>
<br><b>hallway in sneak into the bedroom. I told Nathalie and her mother
said</b>
<br><b>that he was very short, and it was probably him</b>
<br><b>that I saw. It was a scary experience, and I hope to God to never
have</b>
<br><b>any more. I've had many others while I was living</b>
<br><b>on the farm, outside of Kapuskasing, had experiences with the ouija
with</b>
<br><b>some old friends. So many creepy things that I wish</b>
<br><b>never happened. It's crazy how spirits can just roam wherever they</b>
<br><b>please, kind of scary even in broad day light. Dont' you</b>
<br><b>think???</b>

<p><b>My Mothers Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: raydon@vcn.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>The following ghost story is really my mothers story.</b>
<br><b>She passed away in January of 2000 and I have been intending</b>
<br><b>to tell it for some time.&nbsp; While we never did actually live
at the</b>
<br><b>Ft. Bridger Historic Site, I did basically grow up there.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We</b>
<br><b>lived just across the street and the site was my playground and</b>
<br><b>home-away-from-home.&nbsp; My parents, and later my sister and I</b>
<br><b>(beginning about the age of 5) were involved for a great many</b>
<br><b>years in their Living History program.&nbsp; My whole family has</b>
<br><b>always been aware of the various hauntings&nbsp; at the site and</b>
<br><b>pretty much accepted them, with one exception.</b>
<br><b>One night when I was about 11 or 12, mom came</b>
<br><b>home, wet up to her hips and very frightened.&nbsp; She had been</b>
<br><b>working late at the Museum and took the north parade ground</b>
<br><b>path and north bridge across the stream (basically the long way)</b>
<br><b>on her way home, intending to check the Officers Row buildings</b>
<br><b>on the way home.&nbsp; As she was crossing the bridge, she heard</b>
<br><b>the splashing sounds in the stream and what sounded like a</b>
<br><b>young child crying for help.&nbsp; She waded into the shallow stream</b>
<br><b>vainly in search of what she was certain was a little boy</b>
<br><b>drowning.&nbsp; She was never able to get close to the sound and</b>
<br><b>without a flashlight found it impossible to locate him.&nbsp; Unable
to</b>
<br><b>find the child she ran back to the museum to get a flashlight and</b>
<br><b>get the curator who lived in a back apartment.&nbsp; When they</b>
<br><b>returned to the stream there were no longer any sounds to be</b>
<br><b>heard.&nbsp; For more than an hour they searched up and down the</b>
<br><b>stream both on and off the Site grounds before giving up.&nbsp;
At</b>
<br><b>locations at both ends of the stream there are fences in the water</b>
<br><b>which would have caught anything had there been anything to</b>
<br><b>catch.&nbsp; Needless to say, mom was very upset.</b>
<br><b>For years after that she refused to cross the grounds</b>
<br><b>alone at night.&nbsp; One night about ten years later though, she
found</b>
<br><b>herself crossing the bridge alone again and once more heard the</b>
<br><b>splashing and yelling.&nbsp; Again she searched the stream (this
time</b>
<br><b>she did it alone and had a flashlight) but again found nothing.</b>
<br><b>In 1995 I had graduated from college and was working</b>
<br><b>my first job as an archaeologist for the Historic Association on</b>
<br><b>the excavation of the original fur trading post.&nbsp; As the defacto</b>
<br><b>“resident” archaeologists, my partner and I often found ourselves</b>
<br><b>working all over the site and were doing some research on the</b>
<br><b>location and design of the post hospital, which is now long gone.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;In going through micro film copies of the post surgeons records</b>
<br><b>we found a log and death certificate of an 8 year old boy who</b>
<br><b>had drowned in that section of the stream at night in the summer</b>
<br><b>of 1873.&nbsp; As far as I know mom is the only one that ever heard</b>
<br><b>his cries for help, almost exactly 100 years too late as far as
I</b>
<br><b>can tell, though I’m not exactly certain of the dates on which</b>
<br><b>mom heard them.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Negative Energy Attracts Same</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: rane@gte.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Always the skeptic, I scoffed at those who actually believed that
anyone</b>
<br><b>could make contact with the deceased. Neither am I particularly</b>
<br><b>religious by nature, although I can accept that our spirits are</b>
<br><b>distinctly separate from our physical bodies. So when we die, I
demised,</b>
<br><b>our spirits must move on somewhere...heaven and hell seem as good
as any</b>
<br><b>other names for those locations. But never, so I thought, could
those</b>
<br><b>spirits return to earth. Even with the passing of three years, I
can</b>
<br><b>still vividly recall every detail that soundly changed my opinion</b>
<br><b>forever.</b>
<br><b>It was the late winter/ early spring of 1998. My wife (soon to be
known</b>
<br><b>as my ex-wife) and I owned a home in a Seattle, Wa. suburb. This
house</b>
<br><b>was located in a newly constructed neighborhood in which all of
the</b>
<br><b>residences were young urban professional first time home-owners.
We were</b>
<br><b>no exception. Seattle is, and has been for a number of years, a
rapidly</b>
<br><b>developing city. Therfore, housing is difficult to come by. We were</b>
<br><b>thrilled to purchase this place before construction even began.
We</b>
<br><b>bought a plot of dirt on which a home was to be erected, just as
all of</b>
<br><b>our neighbors did. For clarity's sake, the houses were not built
upon</b>
<br><b>any ancient native american burial grounds, pioneer graveyards or</b>
<br><b>anything of the like. The neighborhood certainly wasn't "haunted"
nor</b>
<br><b>was our house. There was no prior history of the area where the
houses</b>
<br><b>are now to attribute any negative or evil energy to. And, as I've</b>
<br><b>stated, the houses themselves certainly had no history, as we were
the</b>
<br><b>first owners.</b>
<br><b>We had owned our home since the spring of 1994 and had experienced</b>
<br><b>nothing out of the ordinary during our occupancy. Nothing occurred
to</b>
<br><b>set us apart from any other home in our neighborhood. Nothing, that
is,</b>
<br><b>except a failing marriage. We had married too young and were still
quite</b>
<br><b>young.We had not taken the time to really get to know one another
prior</b>
<br><b>to our marriage and had discovered too late that we didn't really
even</b>
<br><b>like one another. Coupled with the pressures of long work hours
in an</b>
<br><b>effort to amass material belongings rapidly enough to stay ahead
of our</b>
<br><b>neighbors and well....I think you all can see where this is headed.
It</b>
<br><b>had become increasingly obvious to me that our marriage simply would
not</b>
<br><b>endure. By the beginning of 1998 our relationship had deteriorated
to</b>
<br><b>nightly arguements and useless counselling sessions. We both wanted
out</b>
<br><b>but had not fully accepted the idea.</b>
<br><b>One late winter evening, in a rare moment of truce, my wife, her
sister</b>
<br><b>and I were just settling into the den to watch a video we had rented.</b>
<br><b>The tension was finally beginning to settle in the air from the</b>
<br><b>disagreement we had had prior to her sister's arrival to the house
that</b>
<br><b>evening. My wife was seated at one end of the sofa, her sister in
a</b>
<br><b>chair next to her. I settled in on the far end of the sofa near
the</b>
<br><b>patio door. I made a point to position myself as far away from my
wife</b>
<br><b>as possible, leaving a full empty center section on the sofa. As
I was</b>
<br><b>just about to push play on the vcr remote to begin the video, a
strange</b>
<br><b>dark feeling suddenly swept over me. My attention was immediately
drawn</b>
<br><b>to the patio door on my left. I sensed something...it demanded my</b>
<br><b>acknowledgement. As I stared toward the door for a mere few seconds,
I</b>
<br><b>saw the heavy curtains rustle momentarily. Ofcourse, the door was</b>
<br><b>completely sealed airtight for the winter season. No breeze could
even</b>
<br><b>so much as seep thru the economically sound weatherstripping around
that</b>
<br><b>door. I knew that something was wrong. Moments later I knew that</b>
<br><b>something was "terribly" wrong. My estimate is that of 15 seconds</b>
<br><b>passing since I first noticed the rustling of the curtains. Then</b>
<br><b>suddenly I felt and heard a "swoosh" of extremely cold air around
my</b>
<br><b>face. It began from the area of the curtains and swept across my
face</b>
<br><b>from left to right. It stopped briefly in my right ear and I Heard
a</b>
<br><b>male voice distinctly whispering in my ear. The voice spoke rapidly
and</b>
<br><b>I could not discern any words of the message. An instant later I
felt</b>
<br><b>the "presence" move quickly away from my face and settle on the
sofa in</b>
<br><b>the empty space between my wife and I. I was stunned to say the
least</b>
<br><b>and sat motionless for a minute or two. My rational mind was grasping,</b>
<br><b>trying to determine what was happening to me. This presence was</b>
<br><b>definitely not one of comfort, rather one of malevolence. As I sat
in</b>
<br><b>silence, mind racing, my wife calmly looked in my direction and
stated</b>
<br><b>"do you feel him?". As if her recognition made it all the more real,
I</b>
<br><b>jumped off of the sofa and took several quick steps away. As I shared</b>
<br><b>what had just happened to me with the others in the room, my wife's</b>
<br><b>sister and I became increasingly agitated and anxious. All the while
my</b>
<br><b>wife remained calm stating that she did indeed sense a male presence
but</b>
<br><b>did not find it at all upsetting. Curiously, her sister did not
sense</b>
<br><b>anything. The room seemed to clear as I spoke and soon was void
of</b>
<br><b>anything other than the three humans occupying it.</b>
<br><b>Several days past and once again everything seemed ordinary. We
returned</b>
<br><b>to our usual bouts of petty arguements which sometimes culminated
into</b>
<br><b>my opting to sleep in the spare bedroom. On one occassion, I recall
my</b>
<br><b>waking from a sound sleep at around 4 a.m. to find my wife on her
knees</b>
<br><b>near the bed in the spare room where I was sleeping. She was simply</b>
<br><b>sitting there, hovering over me and staring directly into my face.
Her</b>
<br><b>eyes seemed glossed over and she had a very menacing look. When
I spoke</b>
<br><b>to her, breaking the silence along with the glossy look in her eyes,
she</b>
<br><b>simply stood up and walked back into the master bedroom. I followed
only</b>
<br><b>to watch her return directly to bed and peaceful slumber.</b>
<br><b>Several more days past. Things really seemed to be coming to a head.
We</b>
<br><b>had cancelled our previous two marriage counselling sessions and
I began</b>
<br><b>to make plans to leave the home. I had already began searching for
an</b>
<br><b>apartment. One of the last nights that we shared a bed, I recall
my wife</b>
<br><b>waking me in the middle of the night. She was visibly shaken. This
was</b>
<br><b>quite rare as most of the strange occurrences that were happening
seemed</b>
<br><b>to favor her. On this night, she stated that she had woken to find
a</b>
<br><b>dark menacing figure standing near the foot of our bed. She descibed
the</b>
<br><b>figure as a mid-fortyish male with black hair slicked back in 1950's</b>
<br><b>fashion. He had dark eyes and a cold chisled face. She further described</b>
<br><b>him as wearing a dark sweater and jeans and noticed that his body
seemed</b>
<br><b>to end near mid-leg giving him the appearance of floating a few
feet</b>
<br><b>above the flloor. The man did not speak to her but she had an overall</b>
<br><b>feeling that he was there on my behalf, that he was somehow connected
to</b>
<br><b>me.Although he wasn't overly protective of me, she did get the</b>
<br><b>impression that he meant to scare her, and would harm her if he
chose to</b>
<br><b>do so. His entire demeanor, according to her, was extremely threatening.</b>
<br><b>At last the final days of our relationship approached. I was at
the</b>
<br><b>house one eve packing some of my things for my planned move. My
soon to</b>
<br><b>be ex wife was on the phone in the kitchen with a friend. Undoubtedly</b>
<br><b>expressing her low opinion of me. As I went upstairs to retrieve
some</b>
<br><b>clothing &amp; other articles from the master bedroom, I felt quite
uneasy.</b>
<br><b>I even felt that I'd prefer to have wife up there with me rather
than be</b>
<br><b>alone. I simply tried to shrug off the feeling and return to the
task at</b>
<br><b>hand. Telling myself that I would soon be away from the "house of</b>
<br><b>negativity", I returned to packing up my personal items. My back
was</b>
<br><b>positioned to the doorway of the bedroom yet I sensed movement in
the</b>
<br><b>hallway just beyond the door. I turned slightly a glipmsed something</b>
<br><b>from the corner of my vision. I was convinced that I saw someone
walk</b>
<br><b>into the spare bedroom across the hall. I felt it must be my wife
and</b>
<br><b>therfore called out to her. When I received no response, I went
into the</b>
<br><b>hallway and called out to her again. From where I was positioned
in the</b>
<br><b>hallway near the top of the stairs, I could hear my wife below me
in the</b>
<br><b>kitchen still engaged in her phone conversation. I turned and walked</b>
<br><b>into the spare bedroom to investigate the shadow I had witnessed
enter</b>
<br><b>that room. As I stepped into the room, I knew instantly that I had
made</b>
<br><b>a very bad decision. The room was freezing cold and immediately
upon my</b>
<br><b>entry I felt assaulted by an unfriendly presence. I looked around
the</b>
<br><b>room and could see absolutely no one or anything out of the ordinary.</b>
<br><b>But I could definitely feel it. My attention was drawn to a crawl
space</b>
<br><b>entrance in the far corner of the room. I stared at the door to
the</b>
<br><b>crawl space for several seconds, then my attention moved rapidly
to the</b>
<br><b>closet door. My eyes remained fixed in a straight line as they moved</b>
<br><b>from the crawl space to the closet. I felt as if I had just witnessed</b>
<br><b>something dart across the room; without actually seeing it. I slowly</b>
<br><b>walked to the closet door and opened it. Just as I had the door</b>
<br><b>partially open I felt a blast of cold air so cold that it seemed
to take</b>
<br><b>my breath. Then, I realized that in fact my breath was being taken.
I</b>
<br><b>felt as if something was literally sucking the air from my lungs.
I</b>
<br><b>could feel pressure on my chest and mid-back at once...as if being</b>
<br><b>pushed by unseen hands from both the front and back. This feeling
was</b>
<br><b>Extremely phyiscal and not imaginative. I literally could not catch
my</b>
<br><b>breath. I finally gathered my wits and ran from the room slamming
the</b>
<br><b>door behind me. I slept (very uneasily) for a mere three more nights
in</b>
<br><b>that house before I finally moved out forever. My wife &amp; I separated
and</b>
<br><b>then divorced several months later.</b>
<br><b>I have no real explanation of what happened in the final months
that we</b>
<br><b>owned that home. Other than to say that the negativity that we shared</b>
<br><b>between us seemed to attract other negative energy. I have lived
in</b>
<br><b>several locations since moving away from that home and have never</b>
<br><b>experienced anything like that since. I would caution anyone reading</b>
<br><b>this to ensure that you keep your home a safe haven. I have since</b>
<br><b>learned to treat any residence that I occupy with due respect. Even</b>
<br><b>though I am no great follower of spiritual beliefs, I do occassionally</b>
<br><b>"clear" my home with affirmations and smudge sticks just be on the
safe</b>
<br><b>side. And never, I hope, will I again be party to opening myself
up</b>
<br><b>unwillingly as a portal of negative energy.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Figure</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dfmews@home.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Well this all started when i was just starting to stay up late. I
use to go to bed around the time my family did so i was never up by my
self at night.</b>
<br><b>But this summer i started to go to bed late like around 2:00 in
the morning. For a few weeks it was going fine nothing strange.but one
night i was watching tv after my family whent to sleep i had a weird feeling
like someone or something was watching me. Now where my the tv was there
was a door right beside it that leads to the kitchen and right on the other
side of the kitchen was a door that leads into the living room so i could
see from the room where the tv was to the living room if all the doors
where open. Every time I glanced into the living room it looked like a
figure of a person was just poking his body back into the rooms darkenis
so i could not see him. This happened every night for the hole summer.
But this only happened when i was in the tv room at night alone. It seemed
it was watching me and then knew when i was about to look so i would go.
Every time i looked in that one direction it would happen.This was scary
so i tried to stop my self from looking. But that feeling kept coming to
me.</b>
<br><b>Well one night i had a dream that this same figure was right infront
of me but it had no place to run. It tried but my eyes would never leave
it. It was like it was scared. Eventually it let out the most hydiouse
scream the most awful noise i had ever heard. I covered my eyes and ears.
When I looked it was gone.Ever since then i have yet to see this figure.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Green Sleeves</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Soshysofine@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>About a year ago, my friend Tahlia's boy-friend died in a drive
by shooting.</b>
<br><b>His first name was Greg~Scott.&nbsp; Like a month or so after Greg
died, we all</b>
<br><b>had a slumber party at Tahlia's house. We&nbsp; were playing on
the oija board,</b>
<br><b>and some spirit kept going, "Green~Sleeves, Green~Sleeves,Green~Sleeves,</b>
<br><b>Green~Sleeves,Green~Sleeves, Green~Sleeves," over and over again.&nbsp;
We were</b>
<br><b>kind of creeped out becase G,S is Greg's anitials.&nbsp; Then we
all started to</b>
<br><b>hear the slow song, kind of like a child's voice, but not, ya know?&nbsp;
It was</b>
<br><b>slow and calm, as if it were going through a tornado! We were really
scared,</b>
<br><b>because Green Sleeves was a love song, and we all knew that Greg
was soooo in</b>
<br><b>love with Tahlia!&nbsp; But before it could finish the last phrase,
"I sing to you</b>
<br><b>my darling," we all fell asleep, because it was like a lullaby.&nbsp;
But in the</b>
<br><b>middle of the night like around 3:00, we all woke up at around the
same time,</b>
<br><b>and all together heard those soothing yet chilling words, "I sing
to you my</b>
<br><b>darling!"</b>

<br><b>The Basement</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: logan_j24@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Growing up, I lived on a small farm about 50 miles</b>
<br><b>north of Indianapolis, Indiana.&nbsp; The house was</b>
<br><b>originally 2 bedrooms and one bathroom until my</b>
<br><b>parents remodeled it and added approximately 1000</b>
<br><b>square feet onto the downstairs and a second story to</b>
<br><b>it in 1981.&nbsp; The original house was built around 1875</b>
<br><b>by a farmer for his wife and children.&nbsp; We have found</b>
<br><b>many artifacts in the barns and in the basement from</b>
<br><b>what looks like early 1900 magazines and clothing.</b>
<br><b>Especially odd was this door in the basement that was</b>
<br><b>about 3 feet off of the ground with no steps leading</b>
<br><b>to it.&nbsp; My sister and I never dared stay down there</b>
<br><b>longer than a couple of seconds before running back up</b>
<br><b>the stairs into the entry way, which was just around</b>
<br><b>the corner of the kitchen.</b>
<br><b>I don't remember much about what the house looked like</b>
<br><b>before the remodeling because I was very young at the</b>
<br><b>time.&nbsp; To this day, everytime I go back there, I get</b>
<br><b>chills because of the man that I used to see as I was</b>
<br><b>growing up.</b>
<br><b>Beginning around the time that my parents were</b>
<br><b>remodeling, my older sister and I would feel strange</b>
<br><b>sensations on the back of our necks, and would see</b>
<br><b>fleeting glimpses of someone out of the corner of our</b>
<br><b>eyes.&nbsp; When we would tell our parents, they would</b>
<br><b>shrug this off as a child's fantasy.</b>
<br><b>Time passed, and we still felt and saw the same</b>
<br><b>things.&nbsp; We never said anything more to our parents</b>
<br><b>about it because we knew it would not do any good.</b>
<br><b>One night, however, my sister went to stay at a</b>
<br><b>friend's house.&nbsp; Since the upstairs was added on, we</b>
<br><b>had both slept up there, in separate rooms, but we</b>
<br><b>still felt safer with someone close by.&nbsp; Since she was</b>
<br><b>gone, I slept downstairs in our old bedroom that we</b>
<br><b>shared as small children.&nbsp; As I drifted off to sleep</b>
<br><b>that night, I felt as if someone were watching me.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>awoke with a start and found a man in a dark suit</b>
<br><b>standing in the doorway of the room.&nbsp; He walked</b>
<br><b>briskly over to the bed.&nbsp; He was carrying what looked</b>
<br><b>like a top hat in one hand and some sort of walking</b>
<br><b>stick or cane in the other.&nbsp; He went to the window in</b>
<br><b>front of me and stood there for a moment.&nbsp; He then</b>
<br><b>turned and looked directly at me.&nbsp; The terror inside</b>
<br><b>of me swelled, and I screamed for my parents.&nbsp; As soon</b>
<br><b>as I did that, the figure vanished.</b>
<br><b>My sister and I still felt the chilly air every once</b>
<br><b>in awhile, but it was only seemed to be on the</b>
<br><b>original side of the house.&nbsp; It was not until I was</b>
<br><b>about 12 that another episode occurred.&nbsp; My sister was</b>
<br><b>up in her room studying, and my parents had gone out</b>
<br><b>for the night.&nbsp; I was downstairs in the kitchen, when</b>
<br><b>out of the corner of my eye, I glimpsed a man walking</b>
<br><b>down the hallway near the kitchen.&nbsp; I quickly turned</b>
<br><b>my head, and the figure was still there.&nbsp; He was a</b>
<br><b>tall, lanky man, but I could tell that it was the same</b>
<br><b>one that I had seen years earlier as a small child.</b>
<br><b>He came into the kitchen, and walked as if he had</b>
<br><b>every right to be there toward the entry to the new</b>
<br><b>part of the house.&nbsp; He abpruptly turned toward the</b>
<br><b>east wall and started to sink into the floor, as if he</b>
<br><b>were descending stairs, but I could never remember a</b>
<br><b>stairway being there.</b>
<br><b>Other small instances occurred up until I moved out of</b>
<br><b>the house when I went to college, but I never did tell</b>
<br><b>my sister or parents about the second haunting.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>father again remodeled the old kitchen about two years</b>
<br><b>ago.&nbsp; During renovations, they removed the dry wall</b>
<br><b>from the support boards.&nbsp; In one spot there was what</b>
<br><b>looked like a door frame.&nbsp; I asked my father about</b>
<br><b>that when I saw it, and he told me that was where the</b>
<br><b>steps to the basement used to be before they added</b>
<br><b>onto the house when I was younger.&nbsp; I left for my own</b>
<br><b>home sooner than I had planned that night.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ghost Kiss</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sethandrew@earthlink.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I seem to be yet another of those people
whom ghosts follow. My experiences start in the house in which I grew up.
When I got old enough to be left alone in this house, I often experienced
extreme fear, even in the daytime.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me start by saying that this was a
doublewide trailor, so no previous deaths in the house. My family has owned
the land the house sits on for about the past 60 years, and as far as I
know, there hasnt ever been another structure on the land. However, the
area has been discovered to hold many Native American artifacts. My gradeschool,
only a mile from the house, has a display of early Native American items
found on the grounds.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But let me return to my story. As I said,
my experience started with extreme fear in the house, even in the daytime.
I would be happily watching television alone in the house and suddenly
have to get up and literally run from the house to my Grandma's home next
door. About the time I got to be a teenager, things progressed. I turned
off my bedroom light one night and then felt the presence of "something"
in the area where my dresser was. I got up, turned on the light, and closed
my bedroom door. I then lay in bed for hours listening to footsteps approach
my door, stop, walk away, and return. My mom heard the same thing but had
convinced herself it was me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night when I was about 15, I was lying
in bed in the dark talking to my boyfriend on the phone. We were talking
about the car he had just got, someone had complimented him on it and I
said, "You've got something everyone wants." As soon as I said that, an
extremely pissed off voice from the foot of my bed drawled "Whhaatt?" (As
in "What could you possibly have that everyone wants?")Now, my mom and
I were the only ones in the house and we both were in our bedrooms with
the doors closed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final experience I'm going to relate
occured one night when my Mom had taken my Grandma to emergency room.(She
was having chest pains, but thankfully was fine).I was alone in the house
and I was sleeping in Mom's bed so she'd wake me up when she came home
and tell me what happened.I had her bedroom door closed. When this door
was opened, it made a very distinctive and loud sound because it rubbed
against the door frame. I was awakened by the door opening but I just knew
it wasn't Mom. I lay there with my eyes closed and I felt something kiss
me on the lips. I thought to myself, "Oh God, I am going to have to open
my eyes now and see what's there." But when I opened my eyes, I was alone.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you very much for listening to my
story. This site does a great service by allowing those of us who've had
these experiences to listen to each others stories.</b>

<br><b>Repeat Performance</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Hakushi_@excite.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Vanessa and I live in Wisconsin. THere are a few things
that have</b>
<br><b>happened to me since I moved here 12 years ago. First off, I lived
in</b>
<br><b>Whitewater, WI for 10 years. There are no websites for the hauntings
that go</b>
<br><b>on here, but the town itself has its own history. There used to
be a</b>
<br><b>University for witchcraft and ESP in Whitewater called the Pratt
Institute.</b>
<br><b>It is now a bank.... Anyway, there are tunnels underground and many
of the</b>
<br><b>sororities and fraternities are connected by these tunnels. Of course
the</b>
<br><b>tunnels are no boarded up but some of my friends have allegedly
found a way</b>
<br><b>into them (through the old watertower). In the three cemeteries
(that</b>
<br><b>coincidentally form an equalateral triangle), there are what townies
call</b>
<br><b>'witches circles.' They're graves form a perfect circle and it's
said that,</b>
<br><b>if you stand in the middle of it on a solstice, you will spin in
the air</b>
<br><b>until you faint. Whitewater has a much more in depth history but,</b>
<br><b>unfortunately, the old city records are locked up from public use.
The only</b>
<br><b>reason I know a lot of these things is because my boyfreinds father
was a</b>
<br><b>Professor at the university and therefore had keys to the library
and such.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, that's what I know about Whitewater.</b>
<br><b>Now I live in the town of Mukwonago. I live next to the cemetery
on an</b>
<br><b>apartment building. My close friend used to live next door. This
place has</b>
<br><b>some freaky things going on. Twice for me and once for my boyfriend,
we've</b>
<br><b>woken up and not been able to move. It was as if something was holding
us</b>
<br><b>down. We couldn't even speak. I tried to move my arm and my arm
suddenly</b>
<br><b>flew across my body, as if someone had just let go. I told my freind
about</b>
<br><b>this (not the one that lived next door) and he said that my friend
who lived</b>
<br><b>next door had the EXACT same thing happen to her. We had never talked
to</b>
<br><b>each other about it until then. I also heard children laughing while
I was</b>
<br><b>brushing my teeth. When I went into my room (where the laughing
was) it</b>
<br><b>abruptly stopped. While attempting to sleep one night, I very distincly</b>
<br><b>heard children's voices and heard one of them say 'Don't step in
the water.'</b>
<br><b>I believe they were talking about my aquarium which was on the floor.
I also</b>
<br><b>hear cupboard doors open and close. Lights go on and off and things
randomly</b>
<br><b>disappear for days at a time. No, I'm not crazy. My boyfriend and
close</b>
<br><b>friends have heard the same things. I often wake up at night to
see a dark</b>
<br><b>apparition at the foot of my bed. It moves and disappears when I
move.</b>
<br><b>Sometimes it points at me. My boyfriend and I also often see people
walk</b>
<br><b>past my window very swiftly but when we look outside, no one is
there. Lots</b>
<br><b>of other things have happened. But they're similar to the things
I've</b>
<br><b>written here. Anyway, I hope this is of some interest to you. Please
respond</b>
<br><b>if you have any questions or would like to investigate this matter
further.</b>
<br><b>Thank you for your time.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Haunted School in Las Vegas</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Smittenkitten2u@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>5 of my friends and I were in the gym staying late after school do
help with</b>
<br><b>an upcoming dance.&nbsp; my friends slowly left one by one as their
rides</b>
<br><b>appeared.&nbsp; When I was left alone and said good-bye to my last
remaining</b>
<br><b>friend I left to go back to the gym to get some change to call home
on the</b>
<br><b>pay phone to find out where my ride was. I could not find my backpack</b>
<br><b>anywhere.&nbsp; I left the gym to see if i brought it out front
and left it there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;i noticed a trail of items form my bag leading to the chapel
in the front of</b>
<br><b>the school.&nbsp; when i opened the chapel door i immediately noticed
the same</b>
<br><b>rotten- egg- dead- body smell that i always smelt when visiting
this place</b>
<br><b>for mass or school classes. but this time it was much stronger.&nbsp;
up by the</b>
<br><b>podium was one lit red candle and a picture of a girl probably form
the</b>
<br><b>1960's. i was scared and wanted to leave but found myself not able
to move.</b>
<br><b>the smell increased and i thought i was going to throw up so i ran
from the</b>
<br><b>chapel. when outside i heard a person crying then a scream. i ran
as fast as</b>
<br><b>i could and went to the side parking lot of the building and when
my ride</b>
<br><b>(brother) appeared I realized my bag was still in the chapel. I
grabbed my</b>
<br><b>brother and we walked in the chapel.&nbsp; it didn't smell bad but
it felt like it</b>
<br><b>was about 90 degrees in there. I grabbed my bag. when I got home
I opened my</b>
<br><b>bag to do the homework and found nothing but the candle and picture.&nbsp;
Not</b>
<br><b>knowing what to do i called my same 5 friends that were present
earlier we</b>
<br><b>went back that night and had the candle and picture with us. we
went&nbsp; into</b>
<br><b>the chapel with holly water and the items the smell was so strong
and it was</b>
<br><b>so hot we felt that we were going to pass out.&nbsp; we sprinkled
holly water and</b>
<br><b>said prayers and left the candle and picture there and left.&nbsp;
the next Monday</b>
<br><b>when school started we all meet early and entered the chapel we
found it to</b>
<br><b>be ice cold and smelt like burnt plastic.&nbsp; We found the candle
still there</b>
<br><b>and the picture but the face was now deformed and burnt on the back
was 666.</b>
<br><b>We have never gone back in there and to this day it still is very
hot and</b>

<p><b>Strong Believer</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: NDNqt77@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I'm a very strong believer in spirits/ghosts, however really didn't
encounter anything of the sort until recently. Now, I have 3 older brothers,
Jason, David and Daniel. Jason and Dave were only a year apart therefore
they were the best of friends and when David was 8, he died in a freak
accident. Jason ahs always felt that Dave has watched over him and our
family. I know there isn't a day that goes by that Jay doesn't think of
him. Well, Jason is married now and has a 2 year old son whom I frenquently
babysit. They just moved into this house that my sister in law and I feel
has spirits in it, including David's. See, this is the first place they've
settled at as a family, which is why I feel that Dave is watching over
them. My nephew's room is at the opposite end of the hallway of his parents
room, and his room is the strongest place I feel things. Brandon, my nephew
is no doubtly being watched by Dave and little things go on in his room.
For instance, my sister in law or I wi!</b>
<br><b>ll shut the light off and go downsatirs with the baby, and the light
will be back on when we go upstairs. Sometimes when my s. in law leaves
the house, she'll shut Brandon's light off and go outside to her car and
you can see Brandon's window from there and the light will be back on.
Also, they have an attic fan that has a door over it which is very high
up so the kid can't reach it and there have been times that the fan has
been turned on, but the door is still locked and neither my brother or
his wife touched it. One more thing that happened was when I was babysitting
not too long ago. I went into the kitchen and was cleaning it up and the
sugar bowl was sitting on the counter with a spoon lying next to it and
the cover next to that. Well, their dog has the tendency to jump up to
the counter looking for food or something and I didn't want Brandon to
get a hold of it, so I put the spoon back in the bowl, put the cover back
on it and placed way far back in the corner with the Flour jars and breadbox.
Then Brandon and I went downstairs to watch TV. Maybe an hour later, I
went back to the kitchen to get a drink and the sugar bowl was back out
just as I had seen it earlier, with the spoon next to it with the cover.
My nephew was with me the whole time I was downstairs and besides, I put
it too far back for him to reach anyways. I don't know...personally I think
it's cool, but I wouldn't want to live there...Thanx for reading my story...</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Walk Home</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: leftoverparts@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; when I was fifteen I&nbsp; worked at a fast food chain
. We had a buisy</b>
<br><b>night than normal fridays and got off around two in the morning.</b>
<br><b>I had no transportation so me, being shy , I walked home instead
of</b>
<br><b>asking for a ride.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I started off. I felt a wierd feeling like I was
being watched</b>
<br><b>about half way home. I turned my head and looked behind me. I saw
a</b>
<br><b>jogger</b>
<br><b>running beside the road&nbsp; quite aways back.</b>
<br><b>I got kinda nurvous, I thought "Who would be crazy enough to jog
on that</b>
<br><b>kinda road without sidewalks and at this time of night." So I looked</b>
<br><b>back to make sure what I saw was real. I saw&nbsp; the jogger again.
Cars</b>
<br><b>flew by as the jogger sort of glowed due to the passing lights on
the</b>
<br><b>cars. I began to walk&nbsp; faster, still glansing behind my shoulder.
He was</b>
<br><b>almost&nbsp; right across from me then I froze in my tracks!</b>
<br><b>There was a sign behind him lit up and I could see the sign&nbsp;
straight</b>
<br><b>through him! He then stopped, now being in front of me only being
about</b>
<br><b>a hundred yards away from me across the street. I felt cold shivers
down</b>
<br><b>my spine as he started across the street towards me. I couldnt move,
I</b>
<br><b>couldnt scream. I knew then this wasnt a human becouse I saw cars
pass</b>
<br><b>through him as he crossed. He jogged towards me and ran by a light
that</b>
<br><b>displayed the mini mall name. At this point, his right side glowed
as he</b>
<br><b>passed the light like when the cars passed him before.&nbsp; About
fifty feet</b>
<br><b>away from me now. I still couldnt believe my eyes! I knew what I
saw but</b>
<br><b>I couldnt believe it ! Numbed with fear I finally screamed! Just
then A</b>
<br><b>car took the turn into the mini mall entrance behind the ghost .
He</b>
<br><b>shone right infront of me due to the car lights ,Seeing him closer
than</b>
<br><b>I wanted to be!!!&nbsp; I took off like a bat out of hell as the
driver layed</b>
<br><b>on his horn. i didnt stop running untill I got home. I told friends</b>
<br><b>about it and they just made a joke out of it! Please in some way,
can</b>
<br><b>you desribe why this happened to me and no one else! what did he

<p><b>My Sisters Flat</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Peteanddow@btinternet.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am now 16 years of age and all this what I am going was when I
was at the age 13 or so, anyway I used to stay at my sisters 1 bedroom
flat quite regularly and because it was a 1 bedroom flat I would sleep
on the couch.&nbsp; So one time I was woken up by a buzzing sound , I thought
nothing of it thinking it could of been someone in the flat above, downstairs
or even next door. This sound was was not going to stop I then looked at
the time it was around 4:30 in the morning. Again I thought nothing of
it.&nbsp; I went to the bathroom and as I switched on the light and at
that moment I saw a white light moving around the bathroom I started laughing&nbsp;
thinking it was my sister messing with the torch because the door was still
open. I ran to her room tried to wake her up but she was fast asleep at
that point I began to worry I looked round the flat but nothing or no-one
was there so I turned all the lights out and went back to bed. About two
or three nights later I heard the same sound again I didnt go to the bathroom
to see the light spinning round the walls but instead the light came into
the living room where I was I hid under the covers confused what to do.
I knew my way in and out of that flat blind folded so I closed my eyes
soooo tight and ran to my sisters room I woke her up and told her what
had happened she told me not to worry because it won't hurt me. That night
I could not sleep.&nbsp; From then on whenever I stayed at her flat I would
see this THING quite regular. But up until the day she moved she has now
a boyfriend and a 9 month old child and for the first time I thought I
would not see this THING ever again I was wrong as she moved into the new
house her boyfriend set up the cot in the living room and as my neice was
asleep I was sat on the floor&nbsp; that's when I saw something in the
corner of my eye&nbsp; IT WAS SOMETHING FLOATING OVER MY NEICE so I shouted
for my sister and the thing just vanished into thin air I expained everything
to my sister and she said It might be my dead aunt looking out for her,
so everytime I see this thing I think that it is my auntie looking out
for us. It could be something else but as far as I'm concerned I'll think
of it being my aunt. But I have to tell you this is a lie but I hope you
have enjoyed it!!!!!!!!! Thank You for reading it.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Old German Lady</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: JMCPTEXP@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I never shared this story before but this seems like the right place
to do</b>
<br><b>it.&nbsp; When I was born my parents rented a portion of a three
family house.</b>
<br><b>The house was huge and previously owned by an old German woman.&nbsp;
Apparently,</b>
<br><b>the house belonged to the same family since the early 1700's when
it was</b>
<br><b>built.&nbsp; After the old German lady died there was no one left
in the family to</b>
<br><b>take on ownership of the house. Someone new took the house over
and rented it</b>
<br><b>out to three other families.&nbsp; As soon as we moved in my parents
had odd</b>
<br><b>things happeining on a daily basis.&nbsp; The TV and all of the
lights in the</b>
<br><b>house would constantly turn on in the middle of the night.&nbsp;
One night my dad</b>
<br><b>had some friends over to watch a football game and all of the power
in house</b>
<br><b>kept going on and off.&nbsp; His friends were so freaked out- they
left.&nbsp; What</b>
<br><b>bothered my mom most was that all of the rooms in the house stayed
warm</b>
<br><b>except mine.&nbsp; My room was always like ice and being a new born
my mother was</b>
<br><b>concerned.&nbsp; She would turn the heat way up and still my room
stayed cold.</b>
<br><b>One night she heard a womans voice coming from my room.&nbsp; As
she neared she</b>
<br><b>could hear an old lady singing a lulaby.&nbsp; When she opened the
door the</b>
<br><b>rocking chair was swaying back and forth and my room was warm.&nbsp;
After this</b>
<br><b>occurance my room remained warm. This became an on going thing in
the house.</b>
<br><b>The rocking chair would rock constantly no matter where in the house
my mom</b>
<br><b>moved it to.&nbsp; And often times she would hear a soft voice coming
from my</b>
<br><b>room. The lights continued to go on frequently in the middle of
the night.</b>
<br><b>As I got a little older- into the toddler years I can still remember
certain</b>
<br><b>things happening.&nbsp; My parents find it odd that I am able to
remember things</b>
<br><b>so clearly.&nbsp; I can describe my bedroom in distinct detail as
well as the</b>
<br><b>other rooms in the house.&nbsp; I only lived there from newborn
to 2 1/2 years.</b>
<br><b>One night I woke up and felt terrified.&nbsp; I remember climbing
out of my crib</b>
<br><b>onto the little table and chair set that I had- steped onto the
floor and</b>
<br><b>dodged for my parents room.&nbsp; As soon as I climbed into bed
with my mom and</b>
<br><b>dad- I heard my Aunt (who was asleep on the couch) screaming.&nbsp;
My mom woke up</b>
<br><b>and ran into the living room to see what all the fuss was about.&nbsp;
My aunt</b>
<br><b>kept crying "I saw her", "I saw her", "Over there by the lamp".&nbsp;
Apparently,</b>
<br><b>my aunt says that she saw the old lady standing at the foot of the
couch by</b>
<br><b>the lamp.&nbsp; When my mom reached over to turn the lamp on- she
disapeared.&nbsp; All</b>
<br><b>of my parent's old friends remember the house and everyone has a
story of</b>
<br><b>something that they experienced there.&nbsp; We know that the old
lady died in the</b>
<br><b>house- probably in the section where we lived.&nbsp; At first I
think she was</b>
<br><b>angered that the house no longer belonged to anyone in her family.&nbsp;
She was</b>
<br><b>harmless and just wanted to make her presence know.&nbsp; We only
lasted there for</b>
<br><b>2 1/2 years.&nbsp; Sometimes we drive by the house and contemplate
stopping in to</b>
<br><b>see how the current owners are making out- but I never had the courage
to go</b>
<br><b>back.</b>

<br><b>SEVERAL STORIES</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Here are some "spooky" experiences that I remember from my childhood:</b>
<br><b>The first one didn't happen to me, it's something my mother told
me about.</b>
<br><b>Her mother died in 1959.&nbsp; A few years later, she remembers
waking up in the</b>
<br><b>middle of the night and hearing her mother calling her name.&nbsp;
This always</b>
<br><b>gave me the chills, especially if I thought about it at night!</b>
<br><b>When I was maybe 6 or 7, something happened that scared the living
daylights</b>
<br><b>out of me, I can still picture it in my mind.&nbsp; A short time
after I went to</b>
<br><b>bed, I was lying there awake, and I looked up at my bedroom door,
which was</b>
<br><b>closed.&nbsp; There was a window across the room from the door,
the curtains were</b>
<br><b>open, and the moonlight was shining through the window making a
square of</b>
<br><b>light on the door.&nbsp; In the middle of this square of light,
I saw the shadow</b>
<br><b>of a hand, slowly moving back and forth!&nbsp; I was so scared that
all I could</b>
<br><b>do was just stare at it, I was trying to scream but no sound would
come out.</b>
<br><b>Finally, I managed to get my voice to work and I yelled as loud
as I could,</b>
<br><b>"MOMMEEEEEEEEEEEE!"&nbsp; My mother came running in, and I told
her what I saw, I</b>
<br><b>don't remember if she saw the shadow too, probably not.&nbsp; She
didn't see</b>
<br><b>anything outside, and she shut the curtains.&nbsp; Now, there were
no trees right</b>
<br><b>outside my window that were close enough that they would make a
shadow.&nbsp; Not</b>
<br><b>to mention, that this did NOT look like a tree branch, it was was
DEFINITELY</b>
<br><b>the distinct shape of a human hand!</b>
<br><b>Looking back on this as an adult, I realize that this was most likely
not</b>
<br><b>anything supernatural at all, but someone actually trying to break
into our</b>
<br><b>house (which, quite frankly, is more scary than a mere ghost!);
when I</b>
<br><b>started screaming, the person heard me and ran away.</b>
<br><b>Shortly after the previous incident, I asked my parents if I could
move into</b>
<br><b>the room across from that one (gee, I wonder why?)&nbsp; My new
room had a little</b>
<br><b>trap door in the closet leading to an attic of sorts.&nbsp; My parents
never used</b>
<br><b>it for storage, as it was too hard to go up there through the trap
door, and</b>
<br><b>it most likely wasn't even high enough to walk upright in.&nbsp;
When I was about</b>
<br><b>10 or 11, my best friend and I were playing in my room, and we noticed
that</b>
<br><b>the trap door was open about an inch or so.&nbsp; We slid it closed.&nbsp;
Every once</b>
<br><b>in a while, I'd look up there and find that it was open again.&nbsp;
I'd keep</b>
<br><b>sliding it closed, and then a few days later it would be open.&nbsp;
My friend</b>
<br><b>and I naturally assumed that we had a "ghost" in the attic.&nbsp;
I really don't</b>
<br><b>remember if I ever actually HEARD anything up there or not.</b>
<br><b>Around the same time, this same friend would occasionally spend
the night</b>
<br><b>with me.&nbsp; Several times, we'd be lying in bed, and hear the
sound of a</b>
<br><b>newspaper (or some sort of paper) being crumpled in the living room,
when we</b>
<br><b>knew no one else was up.&nbsp; We called this the "Newspaper Ghost."</b>
<br><b>Another time, I think I was probably about 7, I was riding my bike
around in</b>
<br><b>circles in the street (this was in a housing development where there
was</b>
<br><b>very little traffic).&nbsp; My aunt, uncle, and cousins were visiting,
and I</b>
<br><b>recall looking at the bathroom window on the side of our house,
and seeing</b>
<br><b>my aunt's face looking out the window.&nbsp; Later, I mentioned
it to my aunt,</b>
<br><b>and she said she hadn't been looking out the bathroom window (neither
had</b>
<br><b>anyone else).&nbsp; Now, I realize that this could have easily been
a reflection</b>
<br><b>of something in the window, but at the time it seemed pretty spooky
to me.</b>
<br><b>In the summer of '69 (I was about 13), we had some relatives staying
at our</b>
<br><b>house for about a week.&nbsp; One evening after everyone had gone
to bed, I was</b>
<br><b>still awake (as a child, it always took me a long time to get to
sleep, I</b>
<br><b>was always too wound up I guess).&nbsp; Anyway, all of a sudden,
there was this</b>
<br><b>loud crash that came from my closet, like something metal or aluminum</b>
<br><b>falling on the un-tiled floor (the thing that came to my mind was
a metal</b>
<br><b>vacuum cleaner hose).&nbsp; There was no vacuum cleaner or anything
other large</b>
<br><b>metal object in my closet that could have fallen and made such a
noise, and</b>
<br><b>even if there was, what would have made it fall off the shelf?&nbsp;
I was too</b>
<br><b>scared to get up and look in my closet, or go and ask anyone else
if they'd</b>
<br><b>heard it.&nbsp; Now, this was a small 3-bedroom house in Levittown,
Pennsylvania;</b>
<br><b>if anyone is familiar with those houses, if a loud noise occurs
in any part</b>
<br><b>of the house, it would be impossible not to hear it all over the
house!&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>next morning, I asked my parents, aunt &amp; uncle, and cousins
if they'd heard</b>
<br><b>a loud crash in the night, and NO ONE ELSE HAD HEARD IT!&nbsp; And
by the way, I</b>
<br><b>looked in my closet in the morning, and nothing was out of place.&nbsp;
This has</b>
<br><b>always puzzled me.</b>
<br><b>Here are a few things that have happened in the last few years,
in the house</b>
<br><b>I live in now.&nbsp; Nothing blatantly scary, just wierd; I thought
I'd share</b>
<br><b>them just for the fun of it.</b>
<br><b>One night, I was asleep, and all of a sudden I screamed and woke
myself up.</b>
<br><b>My husband came running in, and I couldn't for the life of me remember
what</b>
<br><b>I'd dreamed that had scared me.&nbsp; But I had a vague memory of
looking beside</b>
<br><b>the bed and seeing something in the form of a human being, made
up of lots</b>
<br><b>of little points of light.</b>
<br><b>There have been a few occasions where I've woken up in the middle
of the</b>
<br><b>night and heard a kind of electrical humming sound that sounds like
it's</b>
<br><b>coming from our bedroom closet.&nbsp; My husband said he could hear
it too.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>can never figure out what's causing it.&nbsp; It sounds like it
could be the</b>
<br><b>refrigerator running, except that the kitchen is NOT right next
to the</b>
<br><b>bedroom, and if it was the fridge, wouldn't I hear the noise every
night,</b>
<br><b>since obviously the fridge runs all the time?&nbsp; I haven't heard
it in over a</b>
<br><b>year.&nbsp; Just as well, it gives me the willies.</b>

<p><b>Floating Dance</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tmbfrar@cox-internet.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello, my name is Aaron.this is regarding a few personal expirience
I have had with the supernatural.I am a 27yr old male born in 1973.my family
are all from Arkansas were they live,still today.my father was a military
man which ment being constantly on the move,but as always we did our vacationing
at home in Arkansas with our family.It was on one of these vists that it
happend.I call it ( it ) because I am not sure what it was,but back to
the story.The year was between 1977 and 1978.I was 4 or 5 years old,the
day was spent with my cousins and our mothers at a park playground.As evening
drew near we went to my aunt Dollys trailer house in the woods were she
and my uncle jim lived.night fell and it was getting close to bed time,I
bathed and my mother sat me in a bed alone in a room with the light on
and said she'd be right back.After about 5 minuets I found myself strangly
drawn to staring at a yellow button up shirt hanging on a hanger in the
closet,as I stared I could have smarn it moved.I didnt belive it had,but
still I stared suddenly it floated off the hanger and started doing a sort
of floating dance in the air swinging to and fro.I have never been that
scared in all my life so crying my eyes out I screamed at it as load as
I could at that point it started floating towards me.I jumped off the bed
and backed up into a corner,&nbsp; and still it advanced,it was floating
about 3 feet off the ground.I screamed as it stopped inches from me and
just floated.Than some kind of survival instinct kicked in because Ireached
out with bolth hands and grabed it and through it on the bed and started
beating it with my fists,just crying my eyes out.all this happend within
at time span of about 40 seconds and was over as my mother ran into the
room.Of cource no one belived me I was just a kid,but I was suprised to
find out later (when I was 18 )that my grandmother who was an anointed
Jehovas witness,had always said there was somthing evil living with them
and that when my aunt and uncle got divorced whatever it was left with
him.My aunt has also said that there were times she felt like she was being
watched.every once in a while I can sort of feel a preasance around me
when I'm alone,but nothing ever happens and sometimes at night I become
paralized just before Iam almost asleep and I expiriance different feelings
of levitation,covers being pulled off,or like something is pulling me to
the foot of the bed,than sometimes I feel an energy that sort of trys to
take me over but I know none of these things are happening because my eyes
are open and Ican see.anyways I have to go for now so bye bye.e-mail me
me back to talk if you'd like.Aaron.</b>

<br><b>Ghost at the Clock Tower</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: leonmary@hci.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>In the beginning of the fall in 1965, Mary Lynn Patton was only 12
years old and wearing a long strawberry-blonde ponytail. She was so nervous
and so innocent as she walked in the dormitory known as the Clock Tower
(Main Building) that was established on the campus of the North Carolina
School for the Deaf in Morganton, N.C., in 1891. It held about 200 girls
from the 5th grade to the 12th grade.&nbsp; She did not know that it was
a haunted house until later on.&nbsp; On the 1st floor, about 25 girls
from ages 12 to 14 were happy to see each other after two long months of
the summer vacation at home. You could see them filling in the hall next
to the lobby and right next to the auditorium with flying hands which is
called American Sign Language. Almost each of them had an individual bedroom.
There were seven bedrooms in the "A" hall and 8 bedrooms in the "C"&nbsp;
hall of the north wing.</b>
<br><b>Day by day the school life went on and all the young teenage girls
did not know what was going on in the 4th floor where the high school girls
were at. On this floor in the "A" hall none of the bedrooms had an oval
window except Ann Scarboro's. She was the luckiest girl because she had
one. Her bedroom was absolutely beautiful with that shape of window. One
dark night, she was sitting on the chair next to the desk with the mirror
on the top of it, brushing her long hair upside-down and she saw a white
gown with white feet&nbsp; underneath it. She then lifted her face slowly
and saw more and more the white gown on the body of the ghostly girl, until
she saw the face. Ann screamed her heart out. None of us were aware or
even heard it.</b>
<br><b>One day in the middle of snowy February, in 1966, the 25 girls of
Mary Lynn's group were moving up to the 4th floor while the high school
girls moved down to the 1st floor so they could be near the auditorium.
They had activities such as Dramatic Club, using the stage for the plays
and Jr. National Association of the Deaf, using the platform for a meeting
or a speech. Once, Mary Lynn was on the 4th floor she was anxious to know
where her bedroom would be and she found that her bedroom was the one that
was beautiful with the oval window! Unaware what happened to Ann, she was
boasted to every girl about it. As the days went by, nothing had happened
to them until the late May, a few days before the school was out, they
were doing something mischievous and they were waiting for their supervisor
to leave for home after their bedtime at 10:00. After she left, there were
four girls from the "C" hall that came into the "A" hall and one of them
switched the lights in the hall on. The order of the line was Faye Choplin,
Martha Boardman, Karen Hawkins, and Frances Allen. They were standing in
line to get a drink of water from the fountain. When Faye bent down and
drank, she stayed there for a few minutes holding the button and the water
was running but her head was turned right. She seemed like she was looking
straight at the door. She then lifed her arm with her index finger pointing.
By the look on her face it was almost like she had seen a ghost. Apparently,
she had. The other three girls then realized that there was a snowy white,
blurry figure moving as slow as a snail.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Meanwhile, Mary Lynn saw the hall light come on, and knew
that it was time to play. When her friends didn't come for her, Mary Lynn
decided to go see what was happening. When she saw her friends, she noticed
strange looks on their faces. When Mary Lynn noticed the direction they
were looking, she turned and saw what they saw. Since one door was open,
and one was closed, Mary Lynn was standing only 4 feet from the door and
saw the ghost's blurry legs. She then gasped, and dashed to her "safe"
bed in her bedroom with the oval window.&nbsp; She pulled her covers over
her head and stayed there till morning. She could hear (she was hard of
hearing in her right ear) the other four girls stampede back to their bedrooms.
The next morning, the girls got together and let curiousity out of the
cage., "Who was that?"..."Did you see her?"..."What was that?" they all
asked.</b>
<br><b>Years later, the four girls and Mary Lynn discovered that Ann Scarboro
had seen the same ghost on the 4th floor.</b>
<br><b>At the 100th anniversary, in 1994, for the deaf school, the 4 girls
and Mary Lynn learned that in the early 1900's a girl, who is unknown,
was leaning over the banister of the stairwell on the 4th floor and a girl
came running up the steps and knocked her over. She fell to the 1st floor
and died.</b>
<br><b>To this day the four girls and Mary Lynn still wonder if that was
the ghost of the young girl that died so long ago, while they were up of
their beds breaking the rules.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Not Alone</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: temberton@kgki.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>It probably all started when my parents bought a house when I was
three</b>
<br><b>yrs. old. It was old, they say it was rebuilt due a fire that happened</b>
<br><b>before they bought it.&nbsp; As I got older about 6, I remember
my grandfather,</b>
<br><b>my mom and I sitting around the kitchen table when we heard a big
crash</b>
<br><b>from up in my brother's room ( my brother who was about 1 yrs. old).
We</b>
<br><b>walked up there and there was nothing there. Now I don't know if
I have</b>
<br><b>ever experienced anything, (unless I had blocked it out) but my
dad has</b>
<br><b>encountered many things, so did my neighbor who was my baby sitter
2 houses</b>
<br><b>down.&nbsp; My family and I always fought a lot expecially in my
teenage years,</b>
<br><b>actually it was quite abusing at times, some I don't like to remember.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I actually hated that house, I hated everything about it, I think
on it now</b>
<br><b>and it was a nice house. Things happened there that were not right
like my</b>
<br><b>dad was allmost strangled to death by what he call's an old woman
floating</b>
<br><b>above him in his sleep. my mom never belived him. His name would
be called</b>
<br><b>out all the time. Finally my parents put the house up for sale,
a couple</b>
<br><b>with two children and one on the way purchased it,&nbsp; our realtor
put the</b>
<br><b>sold sign in front and on her way home she died, autopsy blames
it on</b>
<br><b>carbon monoxide. (I find the spirits did it), I don't know how.</b>
<br><b>It was in June a hot month and I was cleaning and packing when I&nbsp;
bent down</b>
<br><b>to do something and I felt a cold, cold feeling it seemed to last
5</b>
<br><b>minutes, but probobly only 1 minute, but I didn't feel frightened,
I</b>
<br><b>actually felt safe.</b>
<br><b>My parents bought a brand new house, built from scratch, no problems
really</b>
<br><b>but the garage door would slam on it's own, my parents blamed it
on</b>
<br><b>frequency's.&nbsp; When I was home by myself I would hear doors
slam, my family</b>
<br><b>would be eating dinner at the table and I would ask who was coming
thru the</b>
<br><b>back door? My family would ask if I was hearing things.</b>
<br><b>A few years later I was playing on the game station when&nbsp; I
heard, I</b>
<br><b>thought was my dad, (you know, you can tell who is who by their
keys) and I</b>
<br><b>heard his keys dangling.&nbsp; Usually he will go to the kitchen
to drop off his</b>
<br><b>lunch sack and change into more relaxed clothes. 15 minutes went
by and I</b>
<br><b>didnt hear my dad, so I went to the kitchen and no evidence was
there to</b>
<br><b>prove him home, I went to his bedroom and in the bathroom and he
was not</b>
<br><b>there. I opened the basement door and he was not there either, I
opened the</b>
<br><b>garge door and his car was not in there, I froze dead in my tracks
I didnt</b>
<br><b>know if I should run or scream. Well I decided to run for my life
and out</b>
<br><b>the front door I ran and waited til my dad got home.</b><b></b>
<p><b>A few years later, I met my husband we moved out of state and that's
when I</b>
<br><b>started having dreams of death before it happened, mainly to family
members</b>
<br><b>who were close to me. It scared the living daylights out of me on
some of</b>
<br><b>them. To this day I still have dreams like that.&nbsp; Then my husband
and I</b>
<br><b>with our son moved back to Illinois and we rented out a house, I
loved it,</b>
<br><b>it was small but cozy.&nbsp; We got the feeling after a while that
we we're not</b>
<br><b>alone, we would start smelling perfumes and colgnes out of no where,
at</b>
<br><b>night it looked like someone walking in the house towards the back
door,</b>
<br><b>they looked like white movements. We would sometimes see movements
in the</b>
<br><b>kitchen, things were always misplaced, if I put something somewhere
they</b>
<br><b>would move where I put them. My son was about 3 when we tried to
put him in</b>
<br><b>his room to bed, he refused to sleep in there and said there was
a man</b>
<br><b>looking at him, (his room had mirrored sliding doors for his closet).</b>
<br><b>My family and I were watching tv one night, ( I was pregnant with
our</b>
<br><b>daughter) when we smelled this thick smell of perfume in the air,
it was as</b>
<br><b>if someone just poured the whole bottle in front me, we both smelled
it,</b>
<br><b>the smell was there for about 3 minutes and went away, it was scary
because</b>
<br><b>it was by me,not my husband.</b>
<br><b>Whenever my parents gave us furniture from their house, something
always</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;happened, like we would see things or smell things that were't
there.</b>
<br><b>I worked as dispatch for the police dept. when I would see movements
inside</b>
<br><b>the workplace, people that weren't there, like white movements,
except they</b>
<br><b>would walk like they were lost.</b><b></b>
<p><b>My family and I moved to where we are now and even here we see things
like</b>
<br><b>movements, perfumes, colognes. The couple that owned the house always</b>
<br><b>fought and divorced. The owner rented it out to another young couple
and</b>
<br><b>they split up and moved, well I know whatever is in that house likes
to</b>
<br><b>start trouble because my husband and I argue a lot, but I know it's
because</b>
<br><b>of the house and I won't let that get the best of us.&nbsp; We will
put things</b>
<br><b>in places and will not be there next time. We have a small dog who
on</b>
<br><b>occasions you would think he is nuts, 2-3 times allready our dog
has</b>
<br><b>growled, squeal like someone had scared him and he would run and
hide</b>
<br><b>behind the couch, he sometimes sleeps with us, and when he does
he will</b>
<br><b>bark at the corner of the bedroom, just sit there and stare. I know
when he</b>
<br><b>really get's scared because dogs have this what's called an anal
reflex and</b>
<br><b>you know when that happen's because the smell is horrible. I'm sorry
this</b>
<br><b>is long, but my husband really never believed in spirits, ghosts,
but since</b>
<br><b>we have been together how now realizes that there is another side.
But what</b>
<br><b>I can't understand is it seems like whatever it is or who it is,
it</b>
<br><b>followes expecially me, I don't understand why and yes it is bothersome</b>
<br><b>sometimes.&nbsp; My big question is why is it that when I go back
home to see my</b>
<br><b>parents, I still hear things like slamming doors, etc. my family
thinks I'm</b>
<br><b>nuts. They say they don't hear it when I do.</b>
<br><b>I am very open to the spirtual world and I'm actually interested
as to</b>
<br><b>finding out why they do what they do. I am glad I found this sight
because</b>
<br><b>I can tell my story without having people look at me like I'm a
freak</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: hardcorewinger@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to say that I can sympathize with
your situation although other</b>
<br><b>than apparitions, my experience varies greatly from yours. I do
want to</b>
<br><b>share what happened to me with you but I do want to warn you ahead
of time.</b>
<br><b>I used to be a reporter so I can get lengthy.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first experience happened when I was
a child. I was seven years old</b>
<br><b>and lived a completely normal life, my parents didn't smoke dope
or dabble</b>
<br><b>in the occult so I really had no knowledge of ghosts other than
the</b>
<br><b>traditional Halloween experiences every child encounters. When I
turned</b>
<br><b>seven, my family moved from metro Memphis, TN, to rural Independence,
MS. We</b>
<br><b>moved into a house that my father renovated. Rather than trying
to draw a</b>
<br><b>diagram that may get scrambled in transmit, I'll try to describe
the layout</b>
<br><b>of the rooms involved. The way the home was originally laid out,
you walked</b>
<br><b>in the front door into the living room. To the left was the kitchen,
open</b>
<br><b>without walls to the living room. To the right was a bedroom door.
Straight</b>
<br><b>ahead was a hallway leading to other bedrooms, laundry room and
bathroom.</b>
<br><b>After my father was finished, the front door was added onto a new
wing of</b>
<br><b>the house. The living room was enclosed into a bedroom. The bedroom
now</b>
<br><b>directly let out into the hall which now led to the kitchen also
and had a</b>
<br><b>new doorway to the bedroom that previously opened up to the living
room. (Is</b>
<br><b>that confusing enough?)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We moved into the house and immediately
I was terrified of my sister's</b>
<br><b>bedroom (the one that had previously opened up into the old living
room). I</b>
<br><b>just felt that something was there and it was watching me. I felt
like it</b>
<br><b>wanted to possess me or something stronger than a mere presence.
Also, I</b>
<br><b>never found out why, but her's was the only room with security bars
on the</b>
<br><b>window. No other family member noticed anything strange in the house.
I</b>
<br><b>ended up in the new bedroom and sometimes at night I'd hear noises.
Being so</b>
<br><b>small, I don't remember exactly what they were. But frequently,
I'd see an</b>
<br><b>incandescent, glowing form in the shape of a human walking across
my room.</b>
<br><b>What made me know that it had to be a previous occupant of the home
was that</b>
<br><b>it would walk from the bedroom I was so scared of, through my room
into the</b>
<br><b>kitchen the way the house used to be laid out! Once when my grandmother
came</b>
<br><b>to visit, my parents forced me to sleep in my sister's bedroom.
I was so</b>
<br><b>terrified but I finally went to sleep. When I woke up, I saw what
appeared</b>
<br><b>to be an ectoplasm swirling above my head. I spent most of my childhood</b>
<br><b>years terrified of sleeping. Being a middle child of an older sister
and a</b>
<br><b>younger brother, I'd hide my prized possessions. Jewelry, money,
whatever I</b>
<br><b>thought I didn't want them to get ahold of. Almost every time I'd
hide</b>
<br><b>something, it would disappear and reappear later in a different
location.</b>
<br><b>Thinking my siblings had discovered my hiding place, I'd find a
new one,</b>
<br><b>each time to have them disappear and reappear once again. The really
strange</b>
<br><b>part came later. We sold the house when I was 13 to another girl's
family I</b>
<br><b>went to school with. After she'd moved in, I asked her one day if
she</b>
<br><b>noticed anything weird in the house and she said no. But her sister
refused</b>
<br><b>to go into the bedroom that scared me. The sister's explanation
was that</b>
<br><b>someone was watching her! And she was a middle child also. I guess
there</b>
<br><b>must have been some connection to middle children. I said something
years</b>
<br><b>later about the house being haunted in front of my aunt. She said
she'd</b>
<br><b>always had a feeling that something was "wrong" with the house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd appreciate your input as to what you
think my experience meant. I</b>
<br><b>had a person tell me one time it was a demon that wanted me but
I'm not</b>
<br><b>sure.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I lived there, although I was the
only family member that had</b>
<br><b>strange experiences inside the house, I wasn't the only one who
had strange</b>
<br><b>experiences in the area. In the fall between the hours of 10 p.m.
and 12</b>
<br><b>a.m. my mother would see "balls of light" floating in the field
and wooded</b>
<br><b>area across the road from my house. She would always ask me to come
look,</b>
<br><b>but I had enough terror inside the house and as far as I was concerned
the</b>
<br><b>woods were my only safe-haven while at home. So I never looked and
never</b>
<br><b>witnessed the lights myself, but both my sister and my mom did.
When I was</b>
<br><b>19, I started dating this guy who was friends with a neighbor from
that</b>
<br><b>house I'd lived in. Basically they lived caddy-corner from me with
their</b>
<br><b>house backing up to the woods mine faced. My new boyfriend asked
me if I</b>
<br><b>ever saw anything strange in the woods. I said no. He told me that
this</b>
<br><b>neighbor's kid, who was a friend of his, told him that he'd seen
balls of</b>
<br><b>light in the woods. I then told my boyfriend about my mother and
sister's</b>
<br><b>experiences. So apparently it wasn't just restricted to my family.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another experience I had when I was in
my early 20's was when my</b>
<br><b>grandfather passed away. We'd always loved each other very much
but didn't</b>
<br><b>have a close relationship because of my grandmother, whom I didn't
get along</b>
<br><b>with. I was present when he passed away and was devastated. About
three</b>
<br><b>months passed, enough time to allow me time to grieve and get on
with my</b>
<br><b>life. I was asleep one night and awoke to find my grandfather sitting
on the</b>
<br><b>side of my bed. He told me not to be scared, that he had a message
for me.</b>
<br><b>He told me I needed to get my life straight or I was headed for
trouble. I</b>
<br><b>remember he held my hand and told me that he was going to tell me
what</b>
<br><b>heaven is like, but I'm not allowed to remember what he told me.
I remember</b>
<br><b>him being present for awhile longer but can't remember a word he
said!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that I'm an adult and have some time
and distance between me and</b>
<br><b>these experiences I had as a child, I'd like to try to discover
what they</b>
<br><b>meant or why I was chosen to have this experience. Do you have any</b>
<br><b>suggestions? Also even now, I can drive by a place or house and
tell that</b>
<br><b>it's haunted. Does that mean that I'm psychic or paranormally gifted?</b>
<br><b>Usually I just get kinda jumpy and frightened. But one night I was
out</b>

<p><b>Very Special Message</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Nat0818@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>In 1983, when I was 18 years old I was serverly ill.&nbsp; I woke
up one morning</b>
<br><b>and my face was badly swollen, my Mother took me to the emergancy
room.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>was placed in the icu the next day as I went unconcious.&nbsp; It
would take a</b>
<br><b>team of doctors over a week to finally diagnose me.&nbsp; It was
a rare disease,</b>
<br><b>there was only two case histories.&nbsp; They both died from it
years before,</b>
<br><b>thats why my doctors had no idea what it was.&nbsp; It was from
a sinus infection</b>
<br><b>that had backed up behind my brain.&nbsp; From this I developed
a brain abscess.</b>
<br><b>The night befor they would make the dicision if I needed brain surgery
to</b>
<br><b>remove the abscess, I was laying in my hospital bed praying that
the abscess</b>
<br><b>would have shrunk a little.&nbsp; I felt someone standing beside
my bed.&nbsp; I was</b>
<br><b>sure it was a nurse as it was very late, to late for visitors.&nbsp;
When I turned</b>
<br><b>to talk it wasn't a nurse at all, It was my Grandfather who died
one year</b>
<br><b>earlier.&nbsp; At that moment I was not affraid.&nbsp; He said to
me " You will be fine</b>
<br><b>", when I asked if he were sure, he then replied " do you doubt
me?"&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>replied "no" he then said " everything will be fine you will be
alright ."</b>
<br><b>This part has puzzled me ever since he told me,&nbsp; he said "
take care of your</b>
<br><b>Mother "&nbsp; This was my Mother's Father.&nbsp; Then he simply
walked backwards and</b>
<br><b>disappeared!&nbsp; I thought he meant that I would do fine through
the surgery.</b>
<br><b>You see he had brain surgery about 7 years before his own death.&nbsp;
The next</b>
<br><b>morning I had an x-ray, they came to tell me that my abscess was
completely</b>
<br><b>GONE.&nbsp; There was at the time no evedince that I ever even had
a brain</b>
<br><b>abscess, usually thus type of abscess leaves behind scar-tissue,
I HAD NONE.</b>
<br><b>I didn't know what he meant about my Mother, because at the time
she was</b>
<br><b>healthy.&nbsp; Recently she has been diagnosed with M.S., diabetes
and in</b>
<br><b>September she had heart failure.&nbsp; In November she almost died
and had triple</b>
<br><b>bypass surgery.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Through the years my family has had many encounters with the
spirit world,</b>
<br><b>but this was the most wonderful one.</b><b></b>

<p><b>MY NAME IS MISS BILLIE NANCE, I'VE BEEN A NANNY OVER 20 YEARS. I'M
CONSIDERED</b>
<br><b>A LEVEL HEADED AND A NO NONSENSE PERSON. IN MY LINE OF WORK YOU
HAVE TO BE.</b>
<br><b>IN 1992 EVERYTHING I BELIEVED IN WAS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. EVEN TODAY
I FEEL</b>
<br><b>UNEASY SPEAKING OF SUCH THINGS. FRIGHTENED I MIGHT INVITE THE DESPERATE</b>
<br><b>ENERGY BACK INTO MY LIFE, ALTHOUGH FOR SOME REASON I FEEL LIKE MY
STORY</b>
<br><b>SHOULD BE TOLD....BUT WE HAVE TO VENTURE BACK FOR A MOMENT IN TIME
TO 1988. I</b>
<br><b>WAS WORKING FOR A SINGLE MOTHER OF 4 IN AVOCA, MICHIGAN. SHE WAS
AWAY&nbsp; HER</b>
<br><b>JOB A GREAT DEAL OF THE TIME AND I TOOK CARE OF HER CHILDREN DAY
AND NIGHT.</b>
<br><b>ONE WEEKEND WHEN SHE WAS HOME SHE HAD DECIDED TO REARRANGE HER BEDROOM</b>
<br><b>FURNITURE AROUND. WHEN MONDAY HAD ROLLED AROUND SHE HAD GONE BACK
TO WORK I</b>
<br><b>NOTICED THINGS MISSING. MY GLASSES, SLIPPERS AND A SMALL KITCHEN
RUG. KIDS</b>
<br><b>WILL BE KIDS AND I ASSUMED THEY WERE GOOFING OFF. LATER THAT NIGHT
AFTER I</b>
<br><b>HAD TUCKED THEM ALL INTO BED I FOUND ALL THREE ITEMS IN MY ROOM,
WHICH I HAD</b>
<br><b>ALWAYS KEPT LOCKED. I WASN'T SCARRED AT THIS POINT, JUST PUZZLED.
IT WAS</b>
<br><b>AROUND 11 PM WHEN I HEARD THE FIRST KNOCK. IT WAS FAINT, BUT STILL
A KNOCK. I</b>
<br><b>OPENED THE DOOR EXPECTING TO SEE ONE OF THE KIDS AND NO ONE WAS
THERE. LIKE I</b>
<br><b>SAID KIDS WILL BE KIDS SO I WENT TO CHECK ON THEM. I COULD TELL
THEY WERE ALL</b>
<br><b>IN A DEEP SLEEP. THE KNOCKING WENT ON THROUGH THE NIGHT AND THE
FOLLOWING</b>
<br><b>NIGHTS AS WELL. BY WEDNESDAY EVENING I WAS TELLING MYSELF IT WAS
ONLY HOUSE</b>
<br><b>NOISES. I ALMOST CONVINCED MYSELF UNTIL I SAW A FIGURE OF A BOY
OUT THE</b>
<br><b>CORNER OF MY EYE. HE LOOKED TO BE APPROX. 15 YEARS OLD. AND WEARING
A HUNTER</b>
<br><b>ORANGE COLORED T-SHIRT. WHEN I LOOKED STRAIGHT AT HIM I COULD NOT
SEE HIM,</b>
<br><b>HOWEVER HE WAS ALWAYS THERE WHEN I ONLY LOOKED OUT THE CORNER OF
MY EYE. AS</b>
<br><b>IF HE WOULD REMAIN THERE ONLY IF HE THOUGHT HE WASN'T BEING SEEN.
IT WAS A</b>
<br><b>MOMENT I NEVER WANT TO OCCUR AGAIN. I STOOD UP AND WALKED OVER TO
THE</b>
<br><b>PHONE(HAVING TO TURN MY BACK TO THE SPIRIT) AND ASKED KATHY, THE
NEXT DOOR</b>
<br><b>NEIGHBOR TO COME OVER. HER AND I HAD BECOME GOOD FRIENDS AND I OFTEN
WATCHED</b>
<br><b>HER 2 BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN. WHEN SHE ARRIVED SHE SAID I WAS "AS WHITE
AS A</b>
<br><b>GHOST." I TOLD HER I HAD GOOD REASON. I EXPLAINED EVERYTHING DOWN
TO THE LAST</b>
<br><b>DETAIL. SHE SAID SHE'D ONCE HEARD THAT A BOY LIVED IN THE HOUSE
ONCE YEARS</b>
<br><b>AGO BUT HE DIED IN A HUNTING ACCIDENT. THE NEXT DAY, I PHONED MY
EMPLOYER</b>
<br><b>BEFORE HER JOB HAD STARTED THAT MORNING. AFTER I TOLD HER EVERYTHING
SHE</b>
<br><b>PROMISED TO BE HOME AFTER WORK THAT NIGHT. SHE ASKED ME TO HELP
HER MOVE THE</b>
<br><b>BEDROOM FURNITURE BACK TO IT'S NORMAL PLACE. WE DID. SHE TOOK OUT
A VILE OF</b>
<br><b>HOLY WATER AND SPRINKLED IT ALL OVER THE OUTSIDE WALLS OF THE HOUSE.
SHE</b>
<br><b>NEVER ASKED THE SPIRIT TO LEAVE, HER REASON WAS BECAUSE THE SPIRIT
OCCUPIED</b>
<br><b>THE HOUSE BEFORE HER, AND IT HAD AS MUCH RIGHT TO THE HOME AS SHE
DID. "LET</b>
<br><b>US ALL LIVE IN PEACE" IS ALL SHE KEPT SAYING AS SHE CONTINUED TO
SPRINKLE</b>
<br><b>HOLY WATER EVERYWHERE. I DIDN'T WORK, AND THE KNOCKING OCCURRED
ALL HOURS OF</b>
<br><b>THE DAY AND NIGHT. I LEFT MY POSITION AND FOUND A NEW JOB. YEARS
LATER</b>
<br><b>IN1992, I WAS ON MY WAY TO ANOTHER BORING TUPPERWARE PARTY. I FOUND
MYSELF</b>
<br><b>DRIVING RIGHT BY THE HOUSE THE PARTY WAS BEING HELD AT, AND DROVE
ANOTHER 50</b>
<br><b>MILES TO AVOCA TO VISIT KATHY (THE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR TO MY FORMER
EMPLOYER).</b>
<br><b>IT WAS AN IMPROMPTU VISIT SO THE SETTING WAS VERY CASUAL. WE SAT
ON THE BACK</b>
<br><b>PORCH DRINKING ICED TEA WHEN ONE OF THE CHILDREN, ADAM, I USED TO
TAKE CARE</b>
<br><b>OF FROM NEXT DOOR CAME OVER. I WATCHED HIM PLAY WITH KATHY'S CHILDREN.
MARK</b>
<br><b>JR,10 AND MIRANDA,7. HE WAS A MEAN SPIRITED BOY AND OLDER THAN LITTLE
MARK.</b>
<br><b>14 OR SO. OUT OF THE BLUE I LOOKED AT KATHY AND TOLD HER THAT ADAM
WAS GOING</b>
<br><b>TO HURT SOMEBODY SOMEDAY. SHE LAUGHED AND SAID WE HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN 4 YEARS</b>
<br><b>AND YOU COME HERE TO ANNOUNCE THAT ADAM WAS GOING TO HURT SOMEBODY
SOMEDAY.</b>
<br><b>WE BOTH LAUGHED. HAD WE ONLY RECOGNIZED THE FATE THAT HAD HAPPENED
LITTLE</b>
<br><b>MARK WOULD STILL BE ALIVE TODAY? I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT. SIX WEEKS
LATER</b>
<br><b>LITTLE MARK WAS PLAYING AT ADAM'S HOUSE UNATTENED. ADAM FOUND HIS

<br><b>WENT OFF AND LITTLE MARK DIED MOMENTS LATER, BEFORE THE AMBULANCE
ARRIVED.</b>
<br><b>AFTER THE FUNERAL KATHY REMINDED ME OF MY EARLIER IMPROMPTU VISIT
THAT SUMMER</b>
<br><b>AND MY WARNING. ASKING HERSELF OVER AND OVER, AGAIN WHY HADN'T SHE
LISTENED.</b>
<br><b>BEFORE BIG MARK AND KATHY HAD LEFT THE STATE TO GO LIVE IN MAINE.
THE HOUSE</b>
<br><b>WAS BLESSED. ASKING ALL SPIRITS TO GO TO GOD IN HIS HEAVEN. THE
HOUSE IS NOW</b>
<br><b>CONDEMNED. I DON'T KNOW IF I SEE MY SPIRITUAL VISIT AS A CRY FROM

<br><b>THE YOUNG 15 YEAR OLD BOY, OR A WARNING TO HELP THE 10 YEAR OLD
BOY. WHATEVER</b>
<br><b>IT WAS I WILL NEVER TAKE IT FOR GRANTED AGAIN. I'M STILL A NANNY

<br><b>FOR THAT REASON, IF IT MEANS KEEPING THE CHILDREN I TEND TO SAFE,

<p><b>I have a friend, that I will call "Sue". She once told me a story
that gives me nightmares to this day. Here it goes:</b>
<br><b>She was living up in the foothills of Fort Collins, Colorado. She
lived there next to an old mining field with her husband and her son, who
I believe was not quite 4 at the time.</b>
<br><b>Her son kept talking about a friend named "Heidi". She took this
as nothing but an imaginary friend. He told her that Heidi would come in
his room at night and scare him.</b>
<br><b>One night, Sue woke up to sounds in the house. She went downstairs
to see her son standing in front of the fridge, door wide open, just staring
into the fridge and shaking. She asked him what he was doing. Without turning
around to face her, he said,"Heidi told me to come here. She woke me up
and did this...". At that moment he turned around to face her, like he
was in a trance. His eyes got really wide and he started moving his jaw
rapidly in an up and down motion,screaming"Uhhhhhhhhhhhh!" in a chattering
voice.</b>
<br><b>Sue said she found out later, after talking to some friends, that
the area was once mined by some Swedish families (thus the name Heidi)

<br><b>Haunted House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: crystalblu1@earthlink.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hello, my name is Deborah and I have had several experiences with
the</b>
<br><b>paranormal in a house that I grew up in which is located in Norwalk,</b>
<br><b>California.&nbsp; This house was originally owned by my uncle. (my
mother's</b>
<br><b>brother)&nbsp; I do not remember how long he lived in it, but I
don't think</b>
<br><b>that is was more then 5 years, but I could be wrong.&nbsp; He eventually
sold</b>
<br><b>it to my parent's.&nbsp; I was five years old at that time and I
am 48 years</b>
<br><b>old now.</b>
<br><b>I do not remember the year, or how old I was when all of this started,</b>
<br><b>but I was very young... maybe 8 years old or so.&nbsp; My older
sister and I</b>
<br><b>shared a bedroom together, with twin beds and our dresser in the
middle</b>
<br><b>of the two&nbsp; One Easter night while in bed, but not asleep yet,
I looked</b>
<br><b>over at my sister who was asleep, and there was someone laying next
to</b>
<br><b>her, not on her bed but on something else, I do not know what it
was</b>
<br><b>because it was draped in a white cloth.&nbsp; This person appeared
to be</b>
<br><b>dead, as they were also in white, lying on their back with their
arms</b>
<br><b>folded across their chest. At that time, something caught my eye
at the</b>
<br><b>end of my bed.&nbsp; There was what appeared to be two hands moving
very</b>
<br><b>fast, back and forth, crossing each other in a waving motion.</b>
<br><b>I yelled for my mother who was in bed just down the hall, and told
her</b>
<br><b>that someone was in my room.&nbsp; She yelled back from her room
and said</b>
<br><b>that it was nothing that I just ate to much candy that day (Easter)
and</b>
<br><b>to go to sleep.&nbsp; Then a terrible feeling came over me, a feeling
as if</b>
<br><b>there was something else in the house, and it was coming to my room,
and</b>
<br><b>sure enough, there it came.&nbsp; As I stared at my open bedroom
door</b>
<br><b>terrified, something floated in, close to the ceiling.&nbsp; I could
not tell</b>
<br><b>if it was male or female, but it had an upper torso and a head with</b>
<br><b>short curly like hair that covered where the ears should be and
a mist</b>
<br><b>like appearance where the lower torso should be.&nbsp; This "thing"
what ever</b>
<br><b>it was floated by the foot side of my bed, heading for the window
that</b>
<br><b>was across the room, and glared at me with an extremely stern look
on</b>
<br><b>it's face.&nbsp; I think that is when I covered my head with the
covers.</b>
<br><b>There were several other times afterward that I would be lying in
bed,</b>
<br><b>everything being fine, and then all of a sudden BAM! that horrifying</b>
<br><b>feeling would just hit me, completely overwhelming.&nbsp; I knew
it was there</b>
<br><b>and coming to my room.&nbsp; I never looked again, I stayed under
the covers</b>
<br><b>until morning.</b>
<br><b>My next experience happened one day after school.&nbsp; My mother
told me to</b>
<br><b>lay down on her bed and rest for a little while before going outside
to</b>
<br><b>play... she then went to a neighbor's leaving me alone in the house.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>was laying there trying to think up any excuse to tell my mother
so she</b>
<br><b>would let me skip the boring nap and go out to play, when I looked</b>
<br><b>toward the partially closed bedroom door, and there in the upper
corner</b>
<br><b>of the room was this (and I do not know how to explain this very
well)</b>
<br><b>shining, sparkling bright "thing" a sphere I guess.&nbsp; I ran
outside never</b>
<br><b>telling anyone.</b>
<br><b>One night when everyone was home, I was alone in the kitchen drying</b>
<br><b>dishes.&nbsp; A decorative copper plate that had been mounted securely
on the</b>
<br><b>wall for years above the kitchen window, fell off of the wall, landing</b>
<br><b>in the sink where I was standing.&nbsp; This plate did not fall
straight</b>
<br><b>down, it was over the window and had to clear the curtain rod.&nbsp;
That</b>
<br><b>shook me up a little.</b>
<br><b>Another night, my father and I were in the den watching television.&nbsp;
All</b>
<br><b>of a sudden we heard a terrible crash in the kitchen.&nbsp; My father
called</b>
<br><b>out to my brother but he was in the bathroom, which was not close
to the</b>
<br><b>kitchen.&nbsp; We all went into the kitchen to see what had happened
and the</b>
<br><b>metal ice tray and some silverware that had been on the drain board
were</b>
<br><b>no longer there.&nbsp; We had a double sink, and these objects had
been moved</b>
<br><b>with such force that they had landed in both sinks.</b>
<br><b>One very sunny, warm day I was in the bathroom putting on makeup,
(I was</b>
<br><b>seventeen then) I heard a clicking noise but did not pay much attention</b>
<br><b>to it as my mind was busy on other things.&nbsp; A minute or so
later, I</b>
<br><b>heard the bathroom wall heater start up.&nbsp; It was very old and
made a lot</b>
<br><b>of noise when warming up.&nbsp; I immediately looked at the double
switch on</b>
<br><b>the wall, next to the door, one controlled the light, and the other
the</b>
<br><b>heater.&nbsp; The switch for the heater was in the on position.&nbsp;
I then</b>
<br><b>realized that that was the "click" that I had heard just moments</b>
<br><b>earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother and I were the only people home at
that time and I</b>
<br><b>know it wasn't her because she was in the kitchen which is on the
other</b>
<br><b>side of the house, and also, I had the bathroom door closed.&nbsp;
It would</b>
<br><b>have been impossible for me to turn it on subconsciously because
it</b>
<br><b>could not be reached from where I was standing.&nbsp; I also, while
still</b>
<br><b>living there, had a terrifying experience with what sounds a lot
like</b>
<br><b>the sleep paralysis you describe on your site, only I was fully
awake.</b>
<br><b>I would love to talk to someone about that, but do not know who.</b>

<p><b>Grandfather</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jilt613@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have been coming to this website since sometime in 1997. I love
reading</b>
<br><b>other people's experiences and decided it was time to submit some
of mine. I</b>
<br><b>have been having experiences since I was very young. I am now 20
years old</b>
<br><b>and the first experience that I remember with something out of the
ordinary</b>
<br><b>was when I was three years old. My grandfather, Pop-pop, was very
sick and</b>
<br><b>in the hospital. My parents took me to see him along with my grandmother.
We</b>
<br><b>visited with him for awhile (the hospital didn't really want me
to be up on</b>
<br><b>that floor but they let me because my grandfather was in such bad
shape) and</b>
<br><b>then my dad took me outside. My mom and grandmother were still up
in the</b>
<br><b>room and they were saying goodbye to my grandfather. I was standing
outside</b>
<br><b>with my dad holding his hand and looking up at the room my grandfather
was</b>
<br><b>in watching my mom and grandmother give him a hug. Then this really
bright</b>
<br><b>bluish light enveloped him and he started floating up into the air.
He was</b>
<br><b>waving down at us and I can remember waving back at him. I can remember
this</b>
<br><b>event like it happened just yesterday. Now, I had always thought
that that</b>
<br><b>was the day my grandfather had died because of what I had seen.
I didn't</b>
<br><b>really talk about it to anyone because I thought that they had seen
the same</b>
<br><b>thing. Well, when I was a sophmore in high school I wrote about
that event</b>
<br><b>for my English class. I let my mom read it and she looked at me
really</b>
<br><b>weird. I asked her what was wrong and she said firmly that we had
visited my</b>
<br><b>grandfather in the hospital three days before he died. I insisted
that that</b>
<br><b>couldn't be because of what happened. At first she had thought that
I had</b>
<br><b>made the story up for my English class but then she saw how serious
I was.</b>
<br><b>My mom is very scared by the idea of ghosts and other paranormal
things so</b>
<br><b>she tried to write it off as it being a dream I had had when I was
young.</b>
<br><b>I've taken that into account but I know it isn't possible. I know
it really</b>
<br><b>happened and I also know that I wouldn't be able to remember a dream
that I</b>
<br><b>had had when I was only three years old. She finally has come to
believe me.</b>
<br><b>She remembers (as well as I do) the times when it was really hard
for her</b>
<br><b>that her father had died and I would always tell her it was alright..that</b>
<br><b>Pop-pop was in a better place...and I would hug her to make her
feel better.</b>
<br><b>To this day I don't really know what happened that day. I think
that maybe</b>
<br><b>my grandfather, or someone else, wanted me to know that he was alright
and</b>
<br><b>not to be scared. I have read other stories where people see other
people's</b>
<br><b>spirits or apparitions before they are really dead so maybe it was
a</b>
<br><b>premonition. Since I was young I have believed in spirits and the
paranormal</b>
<br><b>but I was always terrified of it when I was younger. There were
many times</b>
<br><b>when I would go to places with my parents and refuse to stay there
because I</b>
<br><b>insisted that the place was haunted. I have finally started to get
proof of</b>
<br><b>this. Last year I was looking up this old hotel that we always went
to when</b>
<br><b>I was a kid on the internet because I wanted to stay there when
I visited</b>
<br><b>Florida. I had always been very scared of the lodge itself. It had
hotel</b>
<br><b>rooms that looked like they did since the time of indoor plumbing.
We stayed</b>
<br><b>once in one of those rooms in the lodge itself and I was up all
night scared</b>
<br><b>out of mind and crying. After that we started staying out in the
cottages on</b>
<br><b>the property. Well, I found the webpage for the lodge and it turns
out it is</b>
<br><b>haunted! The owners said themselves that they think there is at
least one</b>
<br><b>resident ghost (This hotel is called the Kennelworth Lodge and is
located in</b>
<br><b>Sebring, Florida). Many people have supposedly experienced odd happenings</b>
<br><b>there. I seem to have some kind of sixth sense. Many times I have
thought I</b>
<br><b>was crazy and that it was just an overactive imagination like my
parents</b>
<br><b>always thought but when I come to this website and read others stories
it</b>
<br><b>makes me realize that these things really do happen. Thank you for
starting</b>
<br><b>this website. I will send in more of my experiences at another time.
If</b>
<br><b>anyone would like to share stories etc please email me.</b><b></b>

<p><b>By: coolfact75@aol.com</b>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was
curious about what was going on about Dudleytown and came</b>
<br><b>across your websight.&nbsp; I have a story about Dudleytown that
I thought you</b>
<br><b>would like to hear,&nbsp; something that is real and actually happenend.&nbsp;
It was</b>
<br><b>the summer of 1992,&nbsp; I think it was June or July cause it was
warm, I was</b>
<br><b>living in a apartment with my two brothers their girl friends and
my girl</b>
<br><b>friend and my cousin and two my friends,&nbsp; I Live In the city
of Torrington</b>
<br><b>with my wife and 3 year old son, and back then I also lived in Torrington
in</b>
<br><b>the same place I live now.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well getting back
to the story,&nbsp; One Friday night me and my family</b>
<br><b>and friends had got together for a little party,&nbsp; Thats all
we did cause we</b>
<br><b>were teenagers,&nbsp; (Laughing)&nbsp; Anyway we were at our apartment
and talking</b>
<br><b>about all the really stupid things we did and all the times we did
ouija</b>
<br><b>boards and try to contact spirits.&nbsp; One of my friends then
told us about a</b>
<br><b>town that was near by that he heard his parents talking about with
their</b>
<br><b>friends that was haunted and he knew where it was.&nbsp; So of course
us being</b>
<br><b>young and bold and fearless we wanted to go.&nbsp; So the 7 of us
got in our cars</b>
<br><b>and went of to seek Dudleytown.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It
was about 11:30 at night and we reached this road and followed</b>
<br><b>all the way up this mountain Until we came to this chain across
the road that</b>
<br><b>had I sign Dark Forest Association,&nbsp; We knew we were in the
right spot but</b>
<br><b>didn't know excatly where we were.&nbsp; When we saw the chain and
sign we all got</b>
<br><b>out of the car and headed down the path.&nbsp; About 20 ft into
the woods we heard</b>
<br><b>scrapping noises and things moving in the dark forest around us.&nbsp;
My friend</b>
<br><b>Rob who was a Big guy and the one who heard the most about Dudleytown
stopped</b>
<br><b>us all and said " If we go in here try not to fight against each
other,</b>
<br><b>cause my mom told me that when people came up here they fought with
each</b>
<br><b>other for no reason"&nbsp; So we all agreed and proceeded down the
road or path.</b>
<br><b>We kept walking until we came to a spot that was like a fork and
it went left</b>
<br><b>or right.&nbsp; Well we all stood there talking about what way we
should go and</b>
<br><b>all of a sudden everyone started fighting,&nbsp; yelling at each
other and pushing</b>
<br><b>one another around&nbsp; we couldn't agree on anything. We argued
for about 30</b>
<br><b>mins when finally I Yelled and said"hey don't you all remember what
rob told</b>
<br><b>us and that we are fighting for no reason over somethin stupid"
and then we</b>
<br><b>all looked at each other and shook each others hands and hug and
said sorry.</b>
<br><b>Then we decided to go to the right of the path. We stayed at the
middle for a</b>
<br><b>little bit while we smoked cigs and drank and talked about what
was going on</b>
<br><b>and listening to weird sounds around us.&nbsp; I told them to wait
here cause I</b>
<br><b>wanted to go up the left path a little ways just to take a look.&nbsp;
So they</b>
<br><b>said ok and I started walking down the path and my friend mike and
my cousin</b>
<br><b>Jimel and my sister inlaw shawn followed me and we walked together.
After</b>
<br><b>walking I would guess 100 feet we decided to turn back we didn't
hear</b>
<br><b>anything or see anything.We got back to the center of the path were
everyone</b>
<br><b>was and things were weird.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My
2 friends Rob and Chris were Seating on the ground Indian style</b>
<br><b>facing each other and my brother mike was down the path to the right
but we</b>
<br><b>could see him.&nbsp; Me and my friend mike walked up to my frends
sitting on the</b>
<br><b>ground and asked them what the hell they were doing.&nbsp; When
we talked to them</b>
<br><b>they said nothing and just kept staring at each other. I looked
at both there</b>
<br><b>faces and there eyes.&nbsp; When I looked at both their eyes there
were all white</b>
<br><b>no pupil,&nbsp; Like there eyes were rolled back in there heads.&nbsp;
I jumped back</b>
<br><b>and said what the **** is going on,&nbsp; they then started talking
to each other</b>
<br><b>in a language that was beyond my knowledge, it sorta sounded like
Latin I</b>
<br><b>wasn't sure but I know both of them don't know nothing but english
and</b>
<br><b>totally understood each other.&nbsp; I then screamed at my brother
mike who was</b>
<br><b>down the path to come on cause we were getting the F*** out of here.&nbsp;
He</b>
<br><b>yelled back that he wanted to stay and started walking down the
path by</b>
<br><b>himself,&nbsp; I then turned to my friend mike and said lets go
I don't like this</b>
<br><b>at all and I wanted to get the girls out of there and he agreed.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>worried about my brother but They had a car and I wasn't sticking
around to</b>
<br><b>see anymore shit cause I was scared out of my mind. We turned around
and</b>
<br><b>started walking and only saw my sister in-law shawn standing there
waiting</b>
<br><b>for us,&nbsp; I asked her where my cousin Jimel was and she said
she already</b>
<br><b>started back to the cars without us. We started walking back to
the cars and</b>
<br><b>about five minutes of walking we heard someone running towards us
yelling and</b>
<br><b>screaming,&nbsp; it was my cousin she was running toward us and
freaking out.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>got about within I say 20yards from us and I saw this white glow
in the form</b>
<br><b>of a body chasing her,&nbsp; I then started runnning toward her.&nbsp;
When we got to</b>
<br><b>each other the glow was gone and she dropped to the ground hugged
my legs and</b>
<br><b>crying uncontrolable.&nbsp; I pick her up in my arms and started
running toward</b>
<br><b>the cars and my friend mike and sister inlaw followed.&nbsp; we
got to the car and</b>
<br><b>i put my cousin in the car and jumped in . I looked at my friend
mike and</b>
<br><b>said did you see that , what the F*** was that,&nbsp; And he said
I don't know but</b>
<br><b>I saw it too,&nbsp; and my sister inlaw confermed she saw it also,
and we took off</b>
<br><b>back home. On the way home there is these feilds on both sides of
the road</b>
<br><b>and in the middle of the feild there was this black cloud of mist
Just</b>
<br><b>floating in a big mass.&nbsp; We told each other we saw it and continued
home.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When we got home and got out of our cars, My father and uncle</b>
<br><b>started walking up the driveway and my father asked what the hell
is going</b>
<br><b>on,&nbsp; I said what do you mean,&nbsp; He asked where my brother
was and I told him a</b>
<br><b>place called dudleytown.&nbsp; He told me that the state police
called and said my</b>
<br><b>brother was at someones house scared out of his mind and won't talk.So
me my</b>
<br><b>friend mike and my uncle and father went back up there.&nbsp; We
didn't know where</b>
<br><b>the house was so we went to where we parked the cars and upon arriving
there</b>
<br><b>was three state cop cars there .&nbsp; We got out of the car and
there was noone</b>
<br><b>around.&nbsp; The police officers had gone in the woods.&nbsp; My
uncle is a very</b>
<br><b>religous man and he said I have a bad feeling about this place ,&nbsp;
( ITS EVIL)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;He suggested we go find the police and I said noway and so
did my friend,&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>wasn't about to go back in there.&nbsp; My uncle went along to find
them and my</b>
<br><b>dad stayed with us.&nbsp; About 10 mins later I saw my uncle coming
towards us</b>
<br><b>along with Four state police men and two search dogs. The police
were in</b>
<br><b>there looking for us.&nbsp; Apperently my two friends Rob and Chris
came to and</b>
<br><b>found themselves at the car and relized we were nowhere to be found
they</b>
<br><b>called out for us and when they coldn't find us they took my brothers
car and</b>
<br><b>went to a nearby house and called the police.&nbsp; They then went
home when the</b>
<br><b>police arrived with my brothers car.&nbsp; The police came out of
the woods and</b>
<br><b>said for us to stay here and they and my father were gonna go get
my brother.</b>
<br><b>One of the police officers and his dog stayed with me and my friend
and</b>
<br><b>uncle.&nbsp; We were there for about 40 mins and while we were waiting
the police</b>
<br><b>dog was going wild and barking and whining the cop then let the
dog out of</b>
<br><b>the car and the dog started to whine and tried to climb under the
car and the</b>
<br><b>polcie officer was freaked out and said"the sooner we get out of
here the</b>
<br><b>better,&nbsp; my dog never acts like this"&nbsp; just as he said
that all the lights we</b>
<br><b>had went out,&nbsp; we then all got into the police car and locked
the doors and</b>
<br><b>he called the other police officers on the radio and said to hurry
up,&nbsp; they</b>
<br><b>were on their way.&nbsp; Like I said 40 mins later they showed up
and we all came</b>
<br><b>back to my house including the police.&nbsp; We got home and they
took our</b>
<br><b>statements.&nbsp; They told us to never go there again and it was
a bad place and</b>
<br><b>other things have happenend there. I asked them how my brother was
cause he</b>
<br><b>was down my parents and they told me he had cuts and bruises on
hes arms and</b>
<br><b>face.&nbsp; They left and noone slept more then an hour that night.&nbsp;
The next day</b>
<br><b>we went to my parents to see my brother and talked to him to see
what</b>
<br><b>happened.&nbsp; He told us that when we left he kept walking down
the path.&nbsp; he</b>
<br><b>stopped after walking for 10 mins and finally relized he was by
himself so he</b>
<br><b>called out for me not knowing we actually left.&nbsp; When he called
out for me I</b>
<br><b>answered and said come this way so he followed my voice(&nbsp; I
was on my way</b>
<br><b>back home probably there already) He said it was me and there was
no mistake</b>
<br><b>about it.&nbsp; He said when he started following my voice that
was calling for</b>
<br><b>him trees and branches started falling in front of him and he kept
going over</b>
<br><b>them or around at one point he couldn't go around them cause he
said on both</b>
<br><b>sides there was nothing but ledges so he had to climb over them
and finally</b>
<br><b>he reached this persons back yard.&nbsp; the man came out. mike
told him what</b>
<br><b>happened he then called the police and they called my dad.&nbsp;
For about three</b>
<br><b>weeks after that we all couldn't sleep or talk about it.&nbsp; My
friends and I</b>
<br><b>and my family went to a nearby place called the lords shrine.&nbsp;
we went there</b>
<br><b>and prayed and lit prayer candles for the nightmares and the bad
to go away.</b>
<br><b>Eventually it did but to this day we can talk about it but will
NEVER go back</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; That place is evil and everthing I told you is true
everyone will</b>
<br><b>tell you it is, even the police officers.&nbsp; No matter what people
say we were</b>
<br><b>there and saw the impossible and its real.&nbsp; I will never forget
it and will</b>
<br><b>never understand it. I hope people will relize that that place has
a</b>
<br><b>spiritual force beyond our comprehension.&nbsp; It is evil and a
truely dark</b>
<br><b>place.&nbsp; I hope you were intrigued by my story and I ashore
you it is totally</b>
<br><b>true.&nbsp; if you have any question or would like to talk to me
about it email me</b>
<br><b>and I will be glad to talk to you.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Battleship Ghost Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Mutinyhms@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just found this site and am eager to share a
first-person experience.</b>
<br><b>I am a former architect for the Battleship Texas, which is permanently
moored</b>
<br><b>at the San Jacinto Battleground State Historical Park, near Houston.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>Battleship served in both world wars.&nbsp; She supported troop
landings at</b>
<br><b>Okinawa and Iwo Jima and was flagship for the D-Day invasion of
Normandy.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since its decommissioning, there have been a
number of occurrences aboard</b>
<br><b>the ship that have convinced many that there is a ghost, a former
sailor</b>
<br><b>perhaps, who protects those who take care of the ship.&nbsp; The
ghost appeared</b>
<br><b>once in the uniform of a late 19th century sailor to warn a worker
to leave</b>
<br><b>deck just moments before paint fumes rendered the worker unconscious.
(Had</b>
<br><b>the worker not left the deck, he would have collapsed in the area
of the</b>
<br><b>fumes and perhaps died).&nbsp; On another occasion, a welder was
starting some</b>
<br><b>work and kept hearing a loud and deliberate tapping just below deck
on the</b>
<br><b>area where he was working.&nbsp; He went below&nbsp; at least three
times to</b>
<br><b>investigate the strange sound, which seemed to come from directly
beneath his</b>
<br><b>feet every time he lit his torch.&nbsp; On his final trip, he took
a flashlight</b>
<br><b>(the room below was pitch-black) and shined it around and discovered
a pool</b>
<br><b>and fuel that had leaked from some large containers.&nbsp; It is
a virtual</b>
<br><b>certainty that the welder's flames would have ignited the fuel and
caused an</b>
<br><b>explosion. The tapping sound, whatever its origin, saved the worker's
life.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now for my experience.&nbsp; I was at the Battleship
one morning meeting with</b>
<br><b>two other staff members when we all three observed a uniformed sailor
walk by</b>
<br><b>through the ship's port holes.&nbsp; We didn't think much of the
incident at first</b>
<br><b>because reenactors occasionally visit the ship.&nbsp; A few moments
later, it</b>
<br><b>occurred to us that it was Saturday and the ship was closed.&nbsp;
Thinking that</b>
<br><b>the sailor (or whoever it was) had sneaked aboard, we began searching.&nbsp;
We</b>
<br><b>combed the ship for a great while before giving up the search.&nbsp;
We stayed all</b>
<br><b>day and never encountered the sailor.&nbsp; It is possible that
someone had</b>
<br><b>sneaked aboard and then hid when we began searching and calling
for him.</b>
<br><b>Still, the incident was very strange, and I have not forgotten it.&nbsp;
I'll let</b>
<br><b>you decide for yourselves what I saw.</b>

<p><b>Auditorium Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: paladin78@juno.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Well,&nbsp; you don't hear about a haunted auditorium much anymore,
but there</b>
<br><b>is one here in my town.&nbsp; Everyone that works in it will tell
you that.</b>
<br><b>I've only had encounters with one ghost.&nbsp; I've heard that there
were more</b>
<br><b>in the past, but they're gone now.</b>
<br><b>First of all, everyone knows who the ghost is.&nbsp; It's Art, the
man that</b>
<br><b>the auditorium is named after.&nbsp; He put everything he had into
it,</b>
<br><b>including getting the school district to remodel the auditrium and
make</b>
<br><b>it into pretty much a professional looking theater.&nbsp; He's friendly,&nbsp;
he</b>
<br><b>doesn't hurt people.&nbsp; He tends to stay up in the catwalks,
but has been</b>
<br><b>known to venture out.</b>
<br><b>The catwalks are the first place anyone who works there encounters
him.</b>
<br><b>That's where I did.&nbsp; I was up there alone, I might have been
changing a</b>
<br><b>bulb, or just retrieving something, I can't remember.&nbsp; Anyways,
as I was</b>
<br><b>leaving, there were footsteps behind me.&nbsp; It freaked me out
big time and</b>
<br><b>I went down that ladder the fastest I ever did.&nbsp; I later found
out that</b>
<br><b>what had happened to me had happened to everyone.&nbsp; One thing
that</b>
<br><b>happened only to me was the hand.&nbsp; I was running through the
auditorium</b>
<br><b>after a friend.&nbsp; We were going to get some tape to take over
to the</b>
<br><b>football stadium.&nbsp; Well, as I was heading up the wings to go
backstage, a</b>
<br><b>sillouette of a hand dropped down in front of my face.&nbsp; I stopped
and</b>
<br><b>backed off and it dissappeared.&nbsp; The distance from the roof
to where the</b>
<br><b>hand was is about 15-20 feet.</b>
<br><b>Another place here is an elementary school.&nbsp; My friend was
working there</b>
<br><b>as a night janitor.&nbsp; He has told me that it was rumored to
be haunted.</b>
<br><b>He was giving me a ride home after work and while I waited for him
to</b>
<br><b>finish up, I was sitting reading in the janitors room.&nbsp; After
a while, I</b>
<br><b>started hearing noises.&nbsp; It was like a crowded auditorium or
theater</b>
<br><b>before a show, with a lot of people talking at once.&nbsp; I sat
there for a</b>
<br><b>minute listening, then I got up and went to find my friend.&nbsp;
I had to</b>
<br><b>find out what was rumored to haunt the place.&nbsp; I asked him
what the ghost</b>
<br><b>was supposed to be, and he described exactly what I heard.&nbsp;
He told me I</b>
<br><b>was pale and looked like I was scared out of my mind.&nbsp; I tell
these</b>
<br><b>stories to people, some believe me, some don't.&nbsp; I know they
happened and</b>
<br><b>I guess that's all that really matters.</b>

<p><b>Myrtles Plantation</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bruce1970@earthlink.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have always been interested in ghosts and I had heard that Myrtles
Plantation was haunted so my husband and I decided to go.&nbsp; We planned
to stay for a couple days through Holloween 2000 and then head to see my
Aunt in Alabama.&nbsp; When we got there we checked in at the little country
store attached to the house.&nbsp; We got our keys and went to our room,
the Camellia.&nbsp; This room is not inside the house, it's on the grounds
attached to the restaurant&nbsp; The Carriage House.&nbsp; When I opened
the door to the room I looked around carefully and the room seemed absolutely
normal.&nbsp; As you walk in, the bed is on your left against the wall,
the bathroom on your right and if you look right in front of you across
the room is another door leading to the back grounds of the property.&nbsp;
I went to the back door and locked the door knob lock and put the hook
through the latch.&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned around and walked across the room
to the front door, looked through the front door that I had left open and
noticed my husband backing up the car to unload our luggage.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I turned around again and looked at the back door and the hook was down
and swinging.&nbsp; I freaked out,&nbsp; ran through the front door of
the room to the outside and caught my arm on a branch of a tree with moss
on it.&nbsp; My adrenaline was pumping so much I didn't even feel the branch
rip a gash in my arm.&nbsp; I never expected anything (if anything at all)
to happen so fast.&nbsp; It caught me COMPLETELY off guard.&nbsp; I KNEW&nbsp;
I HAD PUT THE HOOK THROUGH THE LATCH ALL THE WAY&nbsp; !!!!!!!!&nbsp; I
had no other experiences while I was there, neither did my husband despite
constant warnings that someone might tuck us in at night or not to shut
the door to the bathroom while taking a bath(which I did).&nbsp; After
all this, I'm not saying that it was a ghost&nbsp; that did this but I
know I put that latch in the hook and I know something definitely happened
that I can't explain.</b><b></b>

<br><b>A Texas Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Jslacker23@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I thought I'd share a few of my experiences with all of you, since
I've read</b>
<br><b>so many of yours'.&nbsp; I'm not asking for help, as I don't currently
live with</b>
<br><b>any ghosts and have never had much of a problem with the ones I've&nbsp;
met.</b>
<br><b>I seem to be fairly sensitive to spirits, so I was lucky to live
in a new</b>
<br><b>construction home for the first 6 years of my life.&nbsp; After
one year in a</b>
<br><b>rental, around the 4th of July of my eighth year, my family moved
into the</b>
<br><b>house where we lived for ten years.&nbsp; At the time we bought
the house my</b>
<br><b>family consisted of my mother and father, my myself, and my sister,
who is 6</b>
<br><b>years younger than me.&nbsp; For the most part, I ignored my feelings
about the</b>
<br><b>house, after all, I didn't sense anything dangerous, so why worry?&nbsp;
My room</b>
<br><b>always seemed incredibly safe to me, not neutral, but actually warm
and good,</b>
<br><b>though there was no presence there.&nbsp; The only presence I was
sure of was in</b>
<br><b>the living room.&nbsp; I was sure she was there because I saw her,
several times.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I only saw her at night, and not consistently, just on occasion.&nbsp;
She would</b>
<br><b>walk from one corner of the living room and then fade away or disappear.&nbsp;
She</b>
<br><b>was blonde and wearing pale blue, but I'm not sure if she was a
little girl</b>
<br><b>in a gown or a grown woman in a dress.&nbsp; (Believe me, I've tried
to explain</b>
<br><b>why I can't tell, but it isn't possible to describe it.)&nbsp; I
was never truly</b>
<br><b>scared of her, just a little startled and uneasy about seeing someone
I knew</b>
<br><b>wasn't there.&nbsp; I'm not even sure she knew I was there.&nbsp;
I'm also unable to</b>
<br><b>tell where she came from, the house had never to the knowledge of
the realtor</b>
<br><b>or anyone in the neighborhood had a fatality.&nbsp; The worst was
a small fire in</b>
<br><b>the living room, but no one was hurt, or even home.</b>
<br><b>The tv was placed on an old schiffarobe (sp?) in the corner she
came out of,</b>
<br><b>and it often acted up.&nbsp; The tv was the kind where the vcr and
tv were all one</b>
<br><b>piece, and the vcr tape door used to open and shut really fast on
its on.</b>
<br><b>Eject wasn't an ooption on the remote, and even when the whole family
was in</b>
<br><b>the room and the remote was in plain sight it would do this.&nbsp;
One night the</b>
<br><b>tv refused to turn off, every time we tried, it would turn itself
back on,</b>
<br><b>switch to the weather channel, and raise the volume.&nbsp; By the
time the volume</b>
<br><b>got deafening, we decided to unplug it.&nbsp; It stayed on for several
more</b>
<br><b>minutes, then shut off.&nbsp; I honestly don't think she was responsible
for any</b>
<br><b>of this, at least not on purpose.&nbsp; My theory is that her presence
somehow</b>
<br><b>disturbed the electrical field right there. (Interestingly enough,
I could</b>
<br><b>see her looking directly at her, out of the corner of my eye, and
in the</b>
<br><b>mirror, just depending on where I was looking when she appeared.)</b>
<br><b>I occasionally had to spend the night in the living for various
reasons, but</b>
<br><b>I simply told her, I know yoou're here, I've never asked you to
leave or</b>
<br><b>bothered you, so please don't appear tonight, thanks.&nbsp;&nbsp;
She never showed up</b>
<br><b>when I slept in there.&nbsp; (I never said anything when I had a
slumber party,</b>
<br><b>worried that my friends wouldn't react properly to my talking to
a ghost, but</b>
<br><b>she never made an entrance at any of my parties.)</b>
<br><b>I assumed no one else saw her, since it was a topic my family had
ever</b>
<br><b>discussed, but I found out, I was wrong.&nbsp; My mother slept on
the couch one</b>
<br><b>night when my father was sick to avoid catching what he had.&nbsp;
The next</b>
<br><b>morning at breakfast she had an interesting story to tell.&nbsp;
She woke up in</b>
<br><b>the middle of the night to the sound of someone standing over her
sigh once.</b>
<br><b>It must have sounded female, because she immediately looked up expecting
my</b>
<br><b>sister or I.&nbsp; No one was there.&nbsp; She went to check on
us, and we were both</b>
<br><b>sound asleep.</b>
<br><b>As soon as she finished her story I said, "Oh, it was just the ghost."&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>sister looked at me and said&nbsp; "You saw her too?"</b>
<br><b>HER?&nbsp; I had never indicated the gender of the ghost, nor had
my mother</b>
<br><b>mentioned which gender she had assumed it was.&nbsp; My mother was,
of course,</b>
<br><b>upset, but not for the reason you'd think.&nbsp; Her first comment
was "Why didn't</b>
<br><b>one of you tell me before I slept there?"</b>
