<p><b>By:basketball_balla24@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am writting to tell my experiences
with the ghosts at Pine Ridge Old Auditorium. I live at the Pine Ridge
School area and i have had some scary experiences. Sometimes i walk to
my friends house at night and i always take the path throught the school.
Some times i hear screams from there and when i play basketball and i look
towards the place i always have a feeling something is loking at me. When
i was little i went into the building (before they closed it up) and i
droped a ring inside a hole and the story was told to me that there were
16 high school students having a play and all fell down the hole besides
1. She was a staight A student and never missed a day of school, now i
know this because my grandfather was in school with her at the time is
is still alive today. well all the students died besides her because she
was so hated that she had her only chance to kill her classmates and to
this day she roams the building looking for students who roam her place.
She is a danger to me because she stole my ring and someday i hope to go
inside and get it back because that was my great grandmothers ring!!!</b>

<br><b>My Incident</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tiff9009@gamezonemail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, I am 13 years old and I live in upstairs,Tennessee. I was writing
to tell you about a incident that happened to me when I was 12. My grandmother
owned a cleaning service before she died. I used to go to work with her
to earn some extra money. I liked working at all of her houses except for
one of them. Jane owned this house, which was in Collerville. Jane's husband's
mother had recently died. But for some reason her ghost still lived there!I
should have known this because the house was always cold even when the
air wasn't on. Plus, I always felt unconfortable there because a gust of
wind would always hit me as I came through the door. His mother was a very
wonderful woman. It didn't occur to me that there was a ghost in the house
until last summer. We were almost finished cleaning down stairs and was
about to leave. When all of the sudden the water upstairs turns on. Now
this wouldn't be strange if we weren't alone, but we were. My grandmother
went to turn off the water. [because i wasn't going to do it!!] She came
back downstairs and we were about to leave when we heard someone run across
the floor upstairs and turn back on the water! By now I'm really freaked
out!! So being the hero that she was, my grandmother went back upstairs
to turn off the water again. When she comes back downstairs, we don't wait
for the water to come back, on we leave! The next day, my grandmother received
a call from Jane asking her if she knew why the upstairs restroom floor
was soaked with water. Every since that day I've been afraid of that house
and I've never been back.</b>

<p><b>Constellation</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Mike@cosmosclub.org</b><b></b>
<p><b>Back in the mid to late 1960s I was employed as a carpenter's apprentice
on the Constellation. I had heard about the stories of ghosts onboard,
but did not think much of them until I actually experienced a few encounters.</b>
<br><b>During this period the curator at that time, Donald Stewart (who
was also a descendant of one of the ships later captains of the same name)
had a motion detector system installed. Not for ghost hunting, but for
intruders at night. One night around 1968 the sensor was activated and
the police were notified. When they arrived they had with them K-9 dogs.
Along with them was the curator, and some of the ships workers who were
on alert for such an instance. The police proceeded down the ladders to
the gun deck and found nothing, they then proceeded down to the berthing
deck and still nothing. But when they started down to the orlop deck, the
very bottom of the ship, the dogs hesitated and had to be coaxed down.
After some doing the dogs were physically carried down. Once down there
they became very spooked and nervous. In a flash of an eye they ran back
up the ladder to the berthing deck. When the attending officers got to
them the dogs were staring back down to the deck below and shaking. Then
suddenly they began to snarl viciously and barking. The police thought
the dogs had finally seen and smelled something. But as hard as they tried,
they could not get the dogs to go back down. They were shaking so bad the
police thought they would lose control of their bladder. After a few minutes
the dogs suddenly stopped barking and a look of surprise or was it fear
came across their face. The dogs took off, up and off the ship completely.</b>
<br><b>Another occasion involved the self-proclaimed witch and psychic
Sybil Leek. She was asked to visit the ship and do a s&eacute;ance. Walking
each deck from stem to stern she told what see was feeling and seeing.
On the gun-deck and port number seven on the left side of the ship a cold
area of air could be felt. Thermometers were placed at several different
gun ports, each thermometer recorded the same temperature except port number
seven. It was 10 to 15 degrees colder. Thinking the thermometer may be
faulty, one was taken from one of the other ports. And the same result
was record, a very distinct drop in temperature. Sybil and the group proceeded
to the captains quarters at the stern of the ship on the gun deck. A presence
was felt there and made Sybil very uneasy, and wanted to leave the area.
They then moved to the berthing deck. The center of most of the hauntings
seem to be on that deck, since this is where the crew slept and the surgeon
would be located. Aft on that deck is the officers quarters, which people
mistake as a jail due to the design. Here also was a source of evil presence.
Finally the group went to the orlop deck. Here there is a similar configuration
that resembles a jail. But these compartments were used for ships storage
of food and other supplies. This is where Sybil finally conducted her s&eacute;ance.
Everything was very quiet as she proceeded. She began relating stories
about Neal Harvey, the crewman put to death by Truxton, and other ghosts
onboard. Harvey's ghost is there because of his circumstances and execution;
Captain Truxton is there because it is said before Harvey died he condemned
Truxton to wander ship forever. This explains why there is such an evil
presence on the aft part of the ship. It is Truxton's ghost, and he is
angry because of this curse put on him. It had always been said, it you
feel a presence on that part of the ship you should immediately leave.
Because Truxton is searching for Harvey to remove the curse or kill him
again. As the s&eacute;ance proceeded things started to become apparent,
a change in temperature and the feeling of other presences. While Sybil
was relating certain things a very disturbing occurance happened. The doors
on one of the storage compartments where the sail maker would work, were
nailed shut some years ago. Suddenly they blew open with a tremendous force.
When this happened one of the group urinated himself. It was advised by
Sybil that we should end the s&eacute;ance and never attempt it again.
Because there is such evil in that part of the ship.</b>
<br><b>As for the mysterious tour guide, it is believed either it is Neal
Harvey or Carl Hansen a night watchman that died. I am not sure just who
it is, but tend to believe it is Neal Harvey. While I was employed on the
ship there were a number of times that people would come up to me and say
that was the best tour they had ever had. And the gentleman in the period
clothing was a nice touch. This would happen when there were very little
visitors or late in the day before closing time.</b>
<br><b>I had my doubts for sometime about all this. But then I experienced
it myself a few times. Once when working by myself on the gun deck and
needing more supplies, I was walking to the supply area and passed a gentleman
dressed in a very old, white, bloused shirt. He just nodded and kept walking.
I went topside to ask if we were letting on visitors yet, no, the gate
was still locked. I told my boss what had happened, and he said don't worry
its just Neal.</b>
<br><b>Another time, about a year later, I was working on the orlop deck
in one of the storage compartments. For some reason I looked up from what
I was doing and saw someone in a uniform standing outside the barred window
just standing and looking. At the same moment I spotted this this person
proceeded to walk to the rear of the ship. I called out to them and asked
what they are doing here. But when I turned the corner no one was there.
They could not have gotten out that way, because there is no exit at all,
they would have to come past me to the nearest ladder.</b>
<br><b>My last experience was in 1969, my last year of work on the ship.
I was asked to come in early and open the ship for viewing. While on board
by myself I again had a brief encounter with Neal. Not long after that
I could hear the faint noise of moans and walking. By this point in time
I was used to all this, and would just greet them with a friendly good
morning.</b>
<br><b>You may read this and think it is all made up. I assure you, this
is what I know happened and happened to me. I was there during the s&eacute;ance
and the K-9 incident. A time in my life that I will never forget and feel
somewhat privileged to have experience such a thing.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Dark Hooded Figure</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Ksshorty4141@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I was about 8 years old at the time. It was a mild June day. I was
living at my old house which was built in 1922. Well it was night time
and everyone was asleep, including me. All of a sudden I awoke and instantly
sat up. I looked into the hall and through my doorway you can see the whole
hall. Well at that night I looked at into the hall toward my parents bedroom
door. Standing there was a figure. It was dark, hooded and was about as
tall as the doorway(7 ft i guess). I looked at it for about 5-10 seconds
before it noticed me and looked directly at me. When it looked at me it
sort of looked like those things from Lord of the Rings, except for the
metal hands. When it looked at me it had red eyes and that is all i could
see of its face. I got instantly terrified and fell back into my bed. After
a few seconds, I got up the nerve to look back into the hallway but the
creature had vanished from my sight. I fell back into my bed and instantly
fell asleep.</b>
<br><b>The next night, as my mother was tucking me into bed, i saw something
white and little, like a dog,run past my doorway and into the bathroom
which was right beside my bedroom. I got up to check it out and there was
nothing there.. This happened until about a month before we moved out of
the house</b><b></b>

<br><b>Grandma's House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: wildchild0412003@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was 17 and living with my grandmother and my mom's</b>
<br><b>brother when this very scarey incident happened to me.</b>
<br><b>My uncle slept on the couch downstairs of grandma's</b>
<br><b>home because she only had two bedrooms one of which</b>
<br><b>she occupied and I the other. The first night I slept</b>
<br><b>in that bedroom I felt an uneasy feeling,like someone</b>
<br><b>or something was watching me. It was in the middle of</b>
<br><b>summer in Northern Michigan and the weather was very</b>
<br><b>warm at night. Every evening when I went to bed I</b>
<br><b>regretted it because I was very uncompfortable with</b>
<br><b>this uneasy feeling.&nbsp;&nbsp; On this particular evening I</b>
<br><b>jumped into bed after changing into my night clothes</b>
<br><b>downstairs in the bathroom. I ha&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
d</b>
<br><b>the very strong feeling I was being watched and was</b>
<br><b>very afraid to close the door before jumping in bed,</b>
<br><b>but Grandma's rules! Only moments after I climbed into</b>
<br><b>bed and raised the covers over my head. this horrible</b>
<br><b>stench filled the room and it became very very cold.</b>
<br><b>The room was so cold I could see my breath through the</b>
<br><b>very dim light shining through a small crack in the</b>
<br><b>blinds from the moonlight outside when I peeked out</b>
<br><b>from beneath the blankets. All of a sudden something</b>
<br><b>started&nbsp; ramming me very hard from undernieth the bed!</b>
<br><b>It felt just like a very big man was under it laying</b>
<br><b>on his back and kicking the middle of the bed with his</b>
<br><b>big heavy feet. The force&nbsp; was so strong that I felt</b>
<br><b>myself flying off the bed. I began screaming</b>
<br><b>"Grandma"! Just as Grandma entered the bedroom it all</b>
<br><b>stopped! The room was back at normal temperature and</b>
<br><b>the stench had dissapeared! Needless to say I moved</b>
<br><b>back into my parents home the very next day. never to</b>

<p><b>Guardian Angels</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: depouiller_pour_la_justice@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was 9 My best friend/cousin died in a car wreck on her way
to see me and the rest of my family.&nbsp; My parents had just seperated
and as the oldest I was takeing it harder than my younger sister who at
the time I dont think really understood what was happening to our familly.&nbsp;
My mom had decided to take a vacation and get us away from home for a while...she
invited my Aunt (her sister) and my cousins Lauren (8) and Matthew (6).&nbsp;
Lauren was my best friend in the whole world even though we lived well
over 8 hours away from eachother...her birthday was on March 8th, mine
was on the 12th and for 4 days outta the year we were the same age...Lauren
had just turned 8 and I was about to turn 9...We've always had a weird
twin like connection, like if I skinned my knee she would feel the pain
at about the same time, our parents never believed us and choose instead
to believe we were just makeing up stories together to fool them.&nbsp;
We were so close...closer than Ive ever been with anyone and closer than
i think i ever will be with anyone again....anyways, we were to meet on
March 10th at the condo in Hot Springs that our parents had rented for
the week...we were going to have a week long birthday party for the two
of us and I was SOOOOOO excited.&nbsp; When we t to the condo, they weren't
there yet and I got this HORRABLE feeling that something was gonna happen,
but I knew somehow that it hadn't happened yet.&nbsp; I told my mom that
she needed to call Aunt Judy and make sure she was okay, that something
horrable was going to happen and my mom just told me i was crazy and that
she had just talked to her and they were about 20 mins away.&nbsp; I begged
but my mom just wouldn't listen to me so i dropped it and continued to
help unload the bags...all the sudden i got a sharp pain in my stomach,
the worst pain ive ever felt, EVER!&nbsp; I fell over on the floor and
my mom moved me to the couch, the first thing that come to mind was Lauren,
something was wrong with lauren I just knew it!&nbsp; I kept saying "lauren
mom, its lauren, somethings wrong, mom youve got to help her, mom please,
lauren its lauren, mom shes in pain, somethings happened" I just kept repeating
myself over and over, mom still wouldn't listen, i glanced at the clock
and its a wonder i remember this, but the exact time was 2:37 in the afternoon,
I dont know why that stayed so vivid in my mind, but it did...About 10
mins later the phone rang, weird cause mom hadn't told anyone where we
were staying and hadn't had a chance to call my grandparents and tell them
the number.&nbsp; anyways it was a lady on the phone, she said get to the
hospital as quick as you can theres been a horrable accident just hurry,
then she hung up, no name, no nothing, about this time mom was starting
to think maybe i was on to something so she put me and my sister in the
car and we went to the nearest hospital...turns out They had been hit head
on by an 18 wheeler, Aunt Judy had a broken Hip and a shattered leg while
Matthew was fine, and visibly so was Lauren, however she was in alot of
pain and the doctors took numerious test but couldn't find if they needed
to operate or not with out operating, so they were going to air lift her
to the childrens hospital in Little Rock where they would know what they
needed to do.&nbsp; s was in ICU and noone was allowed to see her, however
the doctores kept saying that she was yelling for me so they let me back
with her for 5 mins alone...being only 9 this was a huge thing for me and
everyone was quite upset that they weren't allowed back to see her.&nbsp;
I went into her room where i remember her rolling around on her bed in
SO much pain, she was cluching her stomach and just crying.&nbsp; I walked
over to her and took her hand and told her I loved her more than anything
and that everything was going to be alright, she kept shaking her head
she said no its not, I'm gonna go be with Ducaine (her dog that had died
the year before) then she said I love you Nikki and I will ALWAYS be with
you (keep in mind she had just turned 8) the doctors came in and dragged
me out...Lauren died during surgery, they said her last words before she
went into the operating room were...tell nikki to remember what I said.&nbsp;
I fell aslee crying that night and ever since then I have always believed
her to be my guardian angel, I never believed that she was really there
with me untill about 3 years ago.&nbsp; It was her birthday and I was feeling
really sad and depressed, but decided to carry on like normal, I went to
dance class and when I came home my light was on, strange because i had
turned it off and noone else was home, mom was outta town and my younger
sister Kelsey was at my grandparents house. I didn't think much of it at
the time, just that maybe i was mistaken and so i proceded to take out
"our" photo album full of pictures of us as babies all the way up to about
a month before the crash I held onto her favorite doll (the one my aunt
gave me after her funeral) and just cried...I remember this one pictre
of her where shes in her dance outfit right before her last recital, she
looked like an angel, just this presence about her, anyways that my fav.
pic of her.&nbsp; I closed the book and put it away with tears in my eyes,
proceding to go down stairs and make dinner all the while talking to her
and yelling t her saying "you told me you would always be there, why aren't
you ehre, why arent you here!" I preceded to have somewhat of a nervous
breakdown, hyperventalating hysterically, unable to breath etc...then i
herd something upstairs...slowly trying to be quiet although that task
was HARD at the time i went upstaris and heard something/someone in my
room....I grabbed one of my moms golf clubs at the end of the hall and
slowly opened my door....terrafied because my light was on AGAIN and this
time i KNEW i had turned it off....as i opened my door noone was there
but i felt this warmth and since of calm come over me, as i looked down
the picture of lauren at her dance recital was laying in the midle of my
floor and the album was still on the shelf, and her doll was in the bathroom,
its all very strange, even now when i think about it, but now i know shes
with me and I can feel her when i need her.&nbsp; When i'm scared I always
say "Lauren I'm scared are you here, please protect me" and ever since
that night shes always given me a sign weather a flicker of a light or
a hand on mine or the more common "seat imprint" on a couch or bed somewhere
around me.&nbsp; I know shes there watching over me and will alway be protecting
me!&nbsp; Shes my guardian angel and shes not afraid to prove to me that
shes there.</b>

<p><b>Harrisburg, Pennsylvania</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Jennyl3al3y@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>To start off I just wanted to say I'm kinda disappointed that more
people in Central Pennsyvania aren't submitting their stories. I know for
a fact it's a pretty haunted area. Here are my experiences with the house
I grew up in in the Union Deposit Area of Harrisburg. Locals will know
where I'm talking about when I say, "the house on Spring Creek."&nbsp;
Here goes.&nbsp; My Grandparents, Mom and I moved in to this farmhouse
when I was about 4 years old. It had sat vacant for awhile.&nbsp; As early
as I can remember, My Great Uncle would come over and sit with my Pap and
tell him about the old man and old lady that he used to see in rocking
chairs on the porch facing the road.&nbsp; (Keep this in mind.)&nbsp; I'm
still not sure if the old couple was "living" the times he'd seen them.
Years passed, but as I got older and I got a bit better at expressing myself,
I would run to my Nan and tell her I felt like someone was watching me,
particularly on the stairs. She smiled and told me the Catholics would
say it was my Guardian Angel. I just looked at her funny, not thinking
or knowing to tell her&nbsp; whoever was watching me was making me pretty
uncomfortable and at times scared.&nbsp; I was always terrified of my bedroom
as well. I never slept there. The night was particularly terrifying, especially
when you are a little kid. I slept in the pull-out bed in the living room
until I was about 11 years old and we moved out. My bedroom was always
ice cold and there were always dead flies on the window sills no matter
how much we cleaned them.&nbsp; I do remember one particular day watching
a movie, nothing scary or anything (Troop Beverly Hills) haha and eating
popcorn.&nbsp; When I looked up ahead of me at the wall I could see in
the mirror that a black shadowy figure was passing right behind the recliner
where I was seated. I dropped the popcorn and ran about a mile up the road
to meet my Nan on her daily walk. I used to constantly ask my Grandparents
if they had ever seen any ghosts there and they would say no- at the time.&nbsp;
We moved to Duncannon, PA when I was around 11 or 12.&nbsp; That's when
I found out what was up.&nbsp; My grandma said to me one day, "Jenny, I
hate to tell you this now but I think our farmhouse was haunted."&nbsp;
Turns out she'd seen an old man herself, very pale, in a white tee and
overalls. She said she'd been hanging curtains when she'd seen him resting
against a car parked in our driveway. She thought nothing of it until she
went to see what he wanted but then he was gone.&nbsp; She also told me
every night before she fell asleep, she'd hear whispers.&nbsp; It became
so routine to her she said it was odd not to hear them in our new home.&nbsp;
It sounded to her as if a radio dial was being turned, a lot of static
and both constant male and female voices. My Grandfather, however, hadn't
experienced anything, though he did believe her.&nbsp; The house has literally
haunted me in my dreams for as long as I can remember, power of suggestion,
I 'm not sure but almost every dream was consistent. In the dream the home
was haunted by a plump, short, old lady who kind of kept to herself, a
tall , thin, grouchy sometimes angry old man, and a little boy. The little
boy I remember very clearly though he only appeared in my dream vividly
once. He had brown hair, blue eyes and freckles across his cheeks. He was
wearing a newsboy cap, a white shirt and suspenders.&nbsp; In that dream
he was peering out of my bedroom window at me while I was driven into the
yard by the old man.&nbsp; I got the feeling he was lost, or in despair.
Over the years,&nbsp; as my interest grew in my dreams and the paranormal
in general I decided to make several trips back to my old farm house.&nbsp;
(The house again, sat abandoned for 10+ years after we'd moved. )&nbsp;
One day my Mother and I went back and found some of my old Jem coloring
book pages in the middle of the floor of my old bedroom.&nbsp; I thought
nothing of it until one day when I went back a few months later to show
some friends where I grew up.&nbsp; I joked, "I wonder if "they" left me
anything else?" We all ran out of there when we reached my bedroom and
in the same spot as the coloring book pages were on my previous visit,
was now the cover of that Jem book which I have in my possession to this
day.&nbsp; It came to my attention that it was quite a party house for
only a short period of time, the vacant house was vandalized, and home
to a runaway for a little while as well.&nbsp; Apparently others had gotten
the vibe that they weren't totaly alone there either.&nbsp; Some aquaintances
were stunned that I had grown up there since it was so notoriously haunted,
though no one knew any history of the place.&nbsp; Finally, someone else
had suggested it!&nbsp; At any rate, some friends and I began cruising
by on occasion to check on the place.&nbsp; One night when we were riding
by, we saw a steady orange glow eminating from two bedroom windows on the
second floor.&nbsp; This was the room next to my old bedroom. This glow
was very vibrant, an orange-red, and it was much too big and controlled
to be a fire- it didn't even flicker!&nbsp; On another occasion when we
went back, we got out of the car in daytime and went to walk around the
outside. We all felt as if something menacing was watching us and quickly
left. We knew we didn't belong there.&nbsp; In the house I am living in
now, I woke to a sound one night out of deep sleep. I listened carefully
because it sounded like a heated, WHISPERED, conversation.&nbsp; I was
curious until I recognized the sound of static, at that point I'd realized
I was hearing the same thing that my Nan used to hear at the farm house
but that is the only current experience I have had.&nbsp; It scare d the
crap out of me at the time so I moved my bed, just to comfort myself. About
2 years ago, the farm house was torn down to make way for a new development.
To this day when I drive by the now vacant lot I get this awful feeling.
I pity whoever buys the new house built on that land. It's almost as if
the ohouse itself is a ghost. I wish I knew the history of the place. That
is a work in progress.&nbsp; Please, I know Central, PA especially Harrisburg
is extremely haunted. I'd love to read some other local stories.&nbsp;
Thank you for listening to mine...</b><b></b>

<p><b>It came to ME!?!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ShWilky@aol.com.</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I had an experience about 4 years ago when I was 17 years old.&nbsp;
My older sister had just left for the Army and I moved into her bedroom
which was an addition over the garage with a set of wooden stairs leading
down to our kitchen.&nbsp; This incident was my first experience with the
supernatural.&nbsp; During the first few months I had moved into that bedroom,
I had alot of stresses in my life.&nbsp; I had gone to school full time,
worked two jobs and lost about 3 loved ones and 4 co-workers in a short
time apart.&nbsp; One night, I was lying in bed with my back to the door
and I remember waking up suddenly.&nbsp; My eyes just opened and I lay
on my side wide awake.&nbsp; I remember looking at my alarm clock which
said it was about 3 a.m.&nbsp; I had this urge to roll onto my right side
but I had this deeper feeling that made me not want to.&nbsp; For a couple
of moments, I juggled in my mind whether or not to turn over.&nbsp; I just
laid there until the urge to roll over became stronger and stronger.&nbsp;
I recall turning just my head to the point where I was looking at the ceiling
and saw out of the corner of my eye a gray figure.&nbsp; My bedroom door
was kept open that night but there were no lights on down in the kitchen
to cast a glow and my bedroom window was dark which made me think the moonlight
wasn't shining through.&nbsp; At the point when I saw the figure, I wasn't
scared just startled and I remember hoping it was just my mother.&nbsp;
Hoping she woke up early for work and wanted to borrow clothing or something.&nbsp;
I can't remember if I actually spoke or just thought about what I wanted
to say but I said "Mom what do you need?"&nbsp; No response.&nbsp; Again
I said "Mom, it's 3 in the morning can it wait until later?"&nbsp; At the
point the figure said very softly "You have beautiful jewelry.&nbsp; I'd
love to take this necklace."&nbsp; I said, in a frustrated tone for waking
me up, "Take whatever you want but get out of my room."&nbsp; At that point,
the figure turned it's whole body toward me and I recall it was wearing
a long robe with a hood over it's head (like that of a monk) and it had
no arms, no legs, and the scariest of all--no face whatsoever.&nbsp; I
said "Please leave I'm very tired."&nbsp; At that point the figure turned
for my door and floated slowly out and down the stairs.&nbsp; The creaky
wooden stairs never made a sound.&nbsp; Sometimes thinking back on that
night, I wonder if it was one of the loved ones I lost considering the
hard time I was going through.&nbsp; I felt no harm that night, just perplexed
by it.&nbsp; To this day, I feel guilty for being rude to it.&nbsp; I wish
I had communicated with it a little bit more because it obviously wanted
something.&nbsp; I believe that spirits come to you in a time you need
them whether you realize you need them or not.&nbsp; Or maybe the stress
in my life caused me to conjure up this figure.&nbsp; I don't know the
reason "it" came to me but after it all happened, I went back to sleep
not thinking about it again until I woke up the next morning.&nbsp; It
was then I realized that a necklace I was given for my 16th birthday was
missing off of my dresser and has yet to turn up this day.</b>

<p><b>Jonathan's Angel</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: slimshadylover130@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When my little brother was first born he was pronounced dead by the
doctor's. I was 4 years old at the time and I remember that day clearly.
I remember seeing my family crying, and of course I also was feeling very
sad because I knew I wasen't going to have a little brother like I was
hoping for. But only 10 min. after the doctors' said he was dead, it was
like something told me to look over at where my brother was laying and
the strangest thing happened! There was this man standing over Jonathan
and he had a white outfit on and it had like a glow to it. (Well I do have
the gift of seeing ghosts ever since I was 3.) I felt this good feeling
overtake me and all he did was touch Jonathan on the arm and he starting
breathing again. I remember watching and I felt a tear rush down my face.
I was so happy. I yelled LOOK LOOK ! HE'S ALIVE! And my family and the
doctor's were shocked. They said it was a miracle, and I said that love
is what saved him. Jonathan is 10 years old now, and I am 14. I also have
a little sister that's 5. I'm the oldest, and my name is April my sis is
Samantha.</b>

<br><b>We had to Move</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: GloriaM543@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Well, This story is frightening.&nbsp; My boyfriend, our 3 little
girls and I moved into a townhouse apartment in Albuquerque, NM about 4
years ago.&nbsp; Everything was fine for 2 months.&nbsp; Our oldest daughter
Marcelina was 5 and the second daughter Charly was 3 1/2 years old, and
then Mary was 1 year old.&nbsp; The apartment was a 2 story and the bedrooms
would be upstairs (of course).&nbsp; Anyway One time we experienced something,
we had come home from work (We all leave and come home at the same time,
One car) there were perfect muddy foot prints from a L-shaped closet in
the kitchen to the back door (having to pass through the kitchen to the
door)&nbsp; I called the landlord (Debra) to ask her if anyone was in the
house she told me no, Me and Charles (My boyfriend)&nbsp; looked around
to see if anything was stolen.&nbsp; Nothing was touched.&nbsp; We ignored
it.&nbsp; Then while all of us would sleep at night Charles would get up
to get Mary a bottle, and he would come back into the bedroom telling me
that I left the TV on downstairs, I would tell him that I didn't and he
would tell me I did.&nbsp; That would happen a lot while we lived there.&nbsp;
And every night when we would put the girls to sleep they would cry so
bad because they didn't want to sleep alone.&nbsp; And Mary would sleep
in mine and Charles room and she would literally grab my shirt as if not
wanting to sleep in there by herself.&nbsp; She would scream so loud that
it would hurt me inside, I would get so frustrated before and thinking
it was just the girls wanting to sleep with us (well all of us wouldn't
fit in the bed) and they had to learn to sleep in their own room.&nbsp;
Once I found out what was really happening to this day I feel horrible,
having to put them through that and not believing.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, I would feel weird, I would either take a shower or a bath
and feel someone watching me thinking it was Charles at first, I would
open the shower curtain, and no one was there.&nbsp; I went to the Debra
and asked her if anyone had died in that apartment and plenty of times
she would tell me no.&nbsp; Until I had to sit and tell her about what
was happening.&nbsp; She looked into the business files of the past residence
and found out an old lady had passed away and that the granddaughter of
the old lady couldn't live there anymore because of the memories.&nbsp;
(is what was written on the form) We both gasped she called the owner the
next day and he said we could move into another apartment in 3 weeks when
it was available.&nbsp; Well, that's when it really got bad.</b>
<br><b>I was interested in the tarot cards and wanted to learn how to do
them, well as I was learning I didn't bless the cards before I started,
to keep away dark spirits.&nbsp; (stupid/dumb me)</b>
<br><b>A lady in another apartment came over and said that she helps a
priest that helps families in this situation and wanted to come in.&nbsp;
I said yes of course and she walked around and told me about the old lady
and her name was Linda.&nbsp; She talked to me and told me she would get
her son who was about 12-13 and he had a gift, he could sense spirits.&nbsp;
Well, he (john) came in and walked around the house and he told me that
she is a nice spirit, likes the peace and quiet, and doesn't like it when
the kids are loud. When me and Charles went up stairs to talk with john
he told us that Linda was in the room with us sitting on our bed.&nbsp;
I didn't believe him at first but sure enough we could see an imprint of
her sitting on the edge of the bed me and Charles touched the area and
it was cold.&nbsp; John told us that it was her turning the TV on at night.
And that it was her that charly saw in the middle of the night in front
of her door way.</b>
<br><b>One night my sister Denise came over and the Johns' mother (Susan)
was there helping me talk with Linda.&nbsp; Susan said that when she is
talking to Linda she doesn't know what Linda is saying, that Linda is talking
through her.&nbsp; Anyway found out more about Linda, she loves our cat
Daphne and pets her a lot, Hates Charles and says I should leave his "lazy
butt", and that she sees how he hurts me (and to let you guys know so that
way you understand, He cheated on me and I took him back -stupid) and that
she would see me crying and feel my pain.&nbsp; and then she told Denise
that she was funny with a cross in her pocket and sure enough Denise had
my grandmothers cross in her pocket.</b>
<br><b>And now the scary stuff started to happen, that night Susan told
me that there was another spirit in the house besides Linda and that Linda
was afraid of it. Susan didn't understand how it got there.(at first).&nbsp;
that night, the girls all started to cry and scream, we ran into their
room and put them to sleep in our room with us.&nbsp; They did OK. until
the next night.&nbsp; Marcelina said that someone kept poking her hard
and couldn't sleep.&nbsp; again we got the girls and put them to sleep
with us, and from then on we would just let them sleep with us.&nbsp; Well,
in the middle of the night Charles was yelling at me telling me to leave
him a lone and let him sleep I asked him what he was talking about and
he said that I keep on poking him hard almost like a slight push on his
shoulder and he couldn't sleep I told him that I was already asleep when
I he was yelling at me.&nbsp; We told Debra that we couldn't stay there
anymore and we helped the people that were moving out with their stuff
so we could move in that afternoon.&nbsp; We couldn't stay there anymore
since is was only getting worse.&nbsp; There is a lot more that had happened
while we lived there</b>

<p><b>Michigan Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; I am a resident of Clarkston Michigan, Clarkston is located
in Cental</b>
<br><b>Oakland county just North of Detroit. The building that is event
took place</b>
<br><b>in is the Hamburger Mansion located on Pine Knob hill. Pine knob
is also a</b>
<br><b>sky hill in the winter and has an ampitheater in which concerts
are held in</b>
<br><b>the summertime. But the hauting seems to be just in the Mansion.</b>
<br><b>The mansion is now used as a banquet hall, weddings, busniess events,
things</b>
<br><b>of that sort. I am a personal friend of the owner of the catering
company</b>
<br><b>that the masion uses, and my brother was an employee of this catering</b>
<br><b>service for several years while he was in high school.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Now just to be completly clear, it was my brother that had
the encounter</b>
<br><b>that I am going to tell you about, but from local lore I have heard
that the</b>
<br><b>mansion has been haunted for quite sometime. Let me share with you
all that</b>
<br><b>I know, some of the details are sketchy but I take my brothers experinces
as</b>
<br><b>the truth. You see my facination with ghost stories dates all the
way back</b>
<br><b>to grade school, but my brother never believed in or was intrested
in ghost</b>
<br><b>until his experince at the mansion.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; The mansion was buit at the turn of the centery by a wealthy
land owner.</b>
<br><b>The hill on which the mansion is built is the tallest natural land
form in</b>
<br><b>the area, on a clear day you can see the buildings in Detroit over
30 miles</b>
<br><b>away.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; The ghost that is said to haunt the building is that of a
young women that</b>
<br><b>was murdered in the mansion sometimes in the 1930's. This is the
local lore,</b>
<br><b>but to date I have not been able to find a name of the girl, or
a record of</b>
<br><b>a murder occuring at the site.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; This is what I do know. While my brother was employed there
these are the</b>
<br><b>phaomana that my brother year. Silverwear and jewlery has materialized
from</b>
<br><b>now where in the main dining area. Doors would close by themselfs
and</b>
<br><b>electrical equipment would start and stop on its own. My brothers
manager</b>
<br><b>refused to work in the mansion by herself after dark. Her fear apparently</b>
<br><b>began after she saw the apperation of a young women cross from the
main</b>
<br><b>house to the carriage house one night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Most of the pictures taken during wedding receptions have
orbs in them, I</b>
<br><b>have seen some of these pictures from several different weddings
and</b>
<br><b>different photographers, but have been unable to obtain copies for
myself.</b>
<br><b>To my knowledge there has not been a picture with an apparition
in it as to</b>
<br><b>date.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; The event that conviced my brother of the prescen of this
ghost occured in</b>
<br><b>a corridor that runs underneath the main dining hall from the kitchen
to</b>
<br><b>behind the bar. This was put in so that staff did not have to cross
the main</b>
<br><b>dining area with bottles, dirty dishes and the like. One night during
a</b>
<br><b>wedding reception, my brother was walking through this corridor
with a tray</b>
<br><b>of food, as he walked down the corridor, he heard high heels behind
him, he</b>
<br><b>turn once to see who it was but there was no one there, he started
walking</b>
<br><b>again, and again heard the high heels. Again, there was no one there.
At the</b>
<br><b>end of this corridor was a swinging door, the kind that are used
in</b>
<br><b>kitchens. This door had a waist high brass kick plate, my brother
said that</b>
<br><b>has he reached the door, in the reflection was a womens dress with
high</b>
<br><b>heels, as if someone was standing behind him. Again he looked back
only to</b>
<br><b>see nothing in the hall way behind him. She said that he has never
climbed a</b>
<br><b>set of stairs so fast in his life.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Now I know that some of the details of this haunting are
hearysay and</b>
<br><b>vague. But I believe the word of my brother, this has been over
ten years</b>
<br><b>from when this event occured and has not changed his story.</b>
<br><b>I hope that you will find this story worthy to place in on your
web page. If</b>
<br><b>needed I would be willing to do more research in order to try and
verify the</b>
<br><b>story. I might even be able to gain acess and perform a basic investigation</b>
<br><b>since I know the people who run the catering company</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Grandfather</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:Suprstar88@msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My story takes place in June of 2004.</b>
<br><b>My name is Carin. A little over a year ago, my grandfather became
ill with cancer. I am fifteen years old, and have always been very close
with him, especially since I lived with him. My family and I watched him
fight for his life, but he lost his battle on June 2nd of this year. I
watched him take his last breath. The odd thing was, when I entered the
room, there wasn't a since of cold that I expected, but of overwhelming
peace. The night after he died, Me, my cousin and my grandmother were all
sleeping in the same room because there were so many people in the house
that there was not any more room. My cousin slept next to my grandmother,
where my grandfather always had, and I slept on the floor. Any way, the
funeral was the next day and I could not sleep for te life of me. I somehow
managed to sleep for a little while, and then I just opened my eyes for
no reason. I saw standing a little bit away, the outline of my grandfather.
I was not scared, but I just turned the other way because I had no idea
what to do. Suddenly, I felt a slight pressure on my shoulder. I immediately
realxed and was able to sleep throught the rest of the night. I knew that
my grandfather was there comforting me. The next day I talked to my cousin
and grandmother. My cousin told me how she felt a presence in the room
as well. The weirdest thing was that we all woke up at the exact same time
that night, the same time I saw the outline.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Pink Lady Spirit</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: wendy_mahaffey@khh.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I just found out about your web site.&nbsp; I thought you might be
interested in my experience at the famously-haunted Room 545 in the Grove
Park Inn in Asheville, North Carolina.&nbsp; Here's the email I sent to
the Grove Park Inn on June 3, 2004, letting them know about my experience:</b>
<br><b>My husband Patrick and myself heard about the Pink Lady ghost on
the internet several months ago, while we were planning a visit to Asheville,
North Carolina. We have been fascinated by haunted sites for years, and
always try to visit or stay in one. Among others, we've stayed in a haunted
castle in Ireland, visited a poltergeist inhabited cemetery in Scotland,
even stayed 2 nights at the Myrtles Plantation in Louisiana. But we have
always been disappointed and not experienced anything we would definitely
say was ghostly, not even at the Myrtles, which is supposedly the most
haunted house in America.</b>
<br><b>Because of our interest in ghostly sites, we booked Room 545 at
the Grove Park Inn. On Thursday, May 27th, we checked into our room. In
the room I read aloud to Patrick some of the stories I found on the Internet
about the Pink Lady. I went to sleep around 10:20pm, Patrick went to sleep
later and turned out the light. Several times throughout the night I woke
up, lifted my head off the pillow and looked around the room, just checking
to see if I could see anything "ghostly" in the room. Around 3:00am I woke
up, and for about the fourth time I lifted up my head and looked around
the darkened room. I saw nothing unusual. I heard my husband snoring in
the double bed next to my bed. I laid my head back down on the pillow and
closed my eyes. My eyes had been closed for only 2-3 seconds when I felt
my pillow being pushed up from behind. It felt like there were two hands
pushing the pillow, and thus my head, up and forward. It lasted several
seconds and the pillow and my head were moved up 1/2 a foot or less. As
I felt myself being lifted I immediately knew what was happening. That
is the most frightened I have ever been in my entire life. I tried to scream
and I was so terrified that no sound came out of my throat (I used to think
the frozen scream only happened in movies). But thank goodness I wasn't
able to scream, I might have awakened half the people on our floor! Then
the pressure behind me stopped and my pillow and head slowly were lowered
back down to the bed. I'm an extremely logical and analytical type, so
as I lay there with my heart pounding, I thought, "OK, Wendy, think about
this carefully, because you know you're going to second guess yourself
in the morning and wonder if this really happened." So I laid there for
a few seconds and confirmed yes, I am definitely awake and not dreaming,
and no, there is no way I could have imagined that and felt such stark
terror.</b>
<br><b>So that's what happened. Nothing too dramatic, it was very subtle.
I didn't see anything in the room or experience any of the other things
people sometimes do with ghosts, like cold spots or the feeling of a presence.
It took me two days of reflecting on the experience before I realized what
the spirit was doing: four times in the night I lifted my head from the
pillow, and she must have seen this and decided to "help me out" by lifting
my head up for me!!</b>
<br><b>My husband slept through the whole thing and is now very envious
that the spirit visited me and not him. He wants to go back to the Grove
Park sometime soon and stay 2 nights, so he can have a chance to experience
the ghost also. Thanks so much for letting me share what happened. It was
a night I will never forget!</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Ghosts in my House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dovegirl135@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello. I am 17 years old, and i have been able to sense spirits since
i was</b>
<br><b>8. I currently have 3 male spirits living in my house. i found out
about</b>
<br><b>them about three years ago...i was stitting, by myself, in my living
room,</b>
<br><b>when i got the feeling i was not alone. Suddenly the closet door
opened! I</b>
<br><b>caught a very quick look at a young mans face. Then, a few days
later, while</b>
<br><b>in my room, my closet doors opened. I thought perphaps that it was
the same</b>
<br><b>spirit but it was not. The one that lives in my room also likes
me. He will</b>
<br><b>sit on my bed, pull my hair, and follow me around my room. The third
spirit,</b>
<br><b>who is also male, likes my hallway and kitchen for some odd reason.
He does</b>
<br><b>not come out very often, and he is more of a protector then the
other 2.</b>
<br><b>However, all three of them like to joke around..they flash the lghts,
make</b>
<br><b>noise, make stuff float....they have also scared two of my very
close</b>
<br><b>friends the first time they slept over. I really dont mind them,
but i wish</b>
<br><b>i knew who they are. I have done some reasearch on my house, but
i have not</b>
<br><b>yet found anything....I also have a mysterious spirit that will
occasionaly</b>
<br><b>come into my basement. I cant tell if that one is male or female
though. But</b>
<br><b>all in all, my house is a very interesting place, especially at
night!</b>

<br><b>Unseen Protector</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>I use to work in downtown Columbus, Ohio.&nbsp; One day I was crossing
a very busy street at a crosswalk that did not have a light.&nbsp; There
had been a couple of times when people had been hit by cars here in the
past.&nbsp; Traffic was of course expected to slow down but for the most
part it seemed people would much rather run you over or swerve around you
than stop!&nbsp; I was always very careful crossing and tried to wait until
there were no cars near, but one day as I was in the midst of crossing
a car pulled out of a pay lot and rushed right towards me.&nbsp; I was
like a deer froze in the headlights. I could not move.&nbsp; As I remember
it I saw the car come and when it was within inches of me it was jerked
to a stop.&nbsp; I felt what I can only describe as a cushion between the
car and I, against my legs.&nbsp; I physically felt something soft and
of volume between the vehicle and myself.&nbsp; The guy behind the wheel
looked dumbfounded and scared to death.&nbsp; As soon as I regained my
senses I walked on across and he just went on also.&nbsp; I wish I would
have asked him if he put on the brakes or if something shoved his car,
because to me it looked like the car was pushed back away from me just
a little.&nbsp; There was also a little bump when the car hit whatever
was between us.&nbsp; I felt it ever so slightly. There have been other
times when I felt protected and&nbsp; I feel that my kids have been looked
after a couple of times also.</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>This might not be one of the most interesting experiences, though
it completely freaked me out.&nbsp; This happened last night actually,
and it was so real and it was like a slap in the face.&nbsp; As I was drifting
off into sleep (in that state of 1/2 sleep so to say) I dreamt that I was
an old 1850's bedroom and talking to a man about the ghosts in his house,
including a little girl (I can't recall her name).&nbsp; However, though
this whole experience started out as a dream, it did not end this way.&nbsp;
As I was trying to recall the girls, name, I turned around to see a little
girl with brown pigtails and I heard her talking from behind me.&nbsp;
Yet, as I suddenly woke up, and was staring at my pillow I realized this
was not only a dream...I could still hear the girl's voice bright and clear
saying "My name is (can't remember name) and I'm right behind you.&nbsp;
And, while hearing this voice, and staring at my pillow, wide awake, I
felt suffocated, and this feeling remained a few seconds after the voice
stopped.&nbsp; The temperature suddenly changed and became boiling hot.&nbsp;
And the thing that shocked me the most was the realization that this was
not a dream and I was still hearing the voice behind me.&nbsp; Let me finish
by saying that though I never doubted the existence of ghosts, I never
really TRULY believed that it was possible for me to encounter one.&nbsp;
However, since last night, I certainly don't believe this anymore.&nbsp;
I know this was an encounter, because I was wide awake and even started
panicking a little as I felt the temperature immediately rising and the
voice continue talking behind me.&nbsp; I hope never to experience an encounter
again.&nbsp; I have never been more shocked, than realizing last night
that there was someone standing behind my bed talking to me that was not
of this world.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Across the street from the Hotel Vendome</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Ticam2@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Our old house which is across the street and over 3 houses from
the Hotel Vendome on Cortez St. in Prescott Arizona was said to be haunted.
Our house was built before the Hotel. Let me first say right off, that
we never experienced anything unusual. Except once when I as a child of
about 8 years of age along with 3 other little friends saw a huge black
cat passing our window it stopped and peered in. The cat's head came up
to the middle of the window where the locking mechanism is.&nbsp; The windows
were the old floor to ceiling kind of windows. The adults in answer to
our screams assured us that it was our imagination. But was it? Who knows.</b>
<br><b>I digress, I meant to tell about the haunting of the old house.
The haunting of our old house manifested itself as whistling, the kind
that has the "come hither" sound to it. Many an "Old Timers" said that
the house was vacant a long time before we bought it. At night people cross
the street rather than go past the house because you always heard the whistle
that beckoned you to come on over.</b>
<br><b>We purchased the house in 1939 and our family lived in it until
1989 and sold it in 1997 and not a single note of a whistle was ever heard.&nbsp;
The address was 333 So. Cortez. The new owners tore down the old Victorian
and the other Victorian next to it.&nbsp; Now that house had all kinds
of freaky things of the paranormal variety going on, or so it was said.
Pity, the old houses were really nice the lots are now used as a mechanic
repair shop.</b>
<br><b>I lived in Prescott across from the Vendome Hotel until 1960 and
then left to marry and in all of that time I did not know the hotel was
haunted. I remember that the hotel had little cement benches close to the
sidewalk and at night after the dance, just to prolong the evening we would
sit and talk quietly on those benches then cross the street and come home.
Had I known it was haunted I would never have gone near that Hotel!</b>
<br><b>Cortez street is very interesting historically.&nbsp; Senator Berry
Goldwater's old home is on the corner 4-5 doors down from the Vendome Hotel
Across the street is the old Ruffner home a beautiful Victorian built during
Prescott's heyday now both homes are funeral parlors.&nbsp; Down the street
heading north on Cortez are 2 more houses said to be haunted. Maybe it's
just that whole area that's kinda freaky in the spirit world sense.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Experiences in West Texas</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tmbrwolf82@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I grew up in a small west
texas town called Kermit. When I was about 16 years old, we moved into
a small 3 bedroom house. It wasnt a very old house. I think it was built
sometime in the 50's or 60's. It was there that I started having some unusual
experiences. I have always known that I had certain knowledge of things
that no one else seemed to know about, and I mean things that were happening
right at that moment or things that were going to happen. On the side of
the house, there was a shed that ran the length of the house that was built
over a sidewalk that used to run along side of it. The roof of the shed
was about 6 ft high. I used to like to go up there at night and just sit.
I liked the cool night air, because out in west texas, the summer days
are usually very hot. Anyway, one night I was sitting out on the shed and
I felt as though I was being watched. I tuned around very quickly and noticed
a black object, about the size of a panther jump off the roof into the
back yard. I am not quite sure why I did this, but at that instance, I
got up and pursued it. When I jumped off the roof into the back yard, I
neither saw nor heard any evidence of anything being there and I cannot
recall hearing anything when it jumped off the roof even though my yard
was full of dry, brittle weeds. I also remember that it had&nbsp; no discernable
features. That was the only time I ever saw this creature. I also used
to love sitting on my front porch at night and every now and then, I would
all of a sudden become very afraid and knew beyond all doubt that I did
not need to be outside that night. I would go inside, load my rifle and
keep it next to me. Thats how unnerving the feeling was. On a number of
occasions, I would be lying in bed and it felt like a line backer ran from
my bedroom doorway and slam into my bed, and I would hear what sounded
like someone punching the wall right next to my head. It happened so often
that it just started to make me more angry than scared. I started saying
the lords prayer every night before going to bed and it never happened

<p><b>Find My Keys</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Oseea9@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>i have always had the other side around me ever since i was a little
girl and have numerous stories but as i got older i got tired of it all
messing up my every day life so i learnt to block it all out, but then
out of the blue we lost our van keys and after searching all day and they
were no where to be found my husband was walking through the bedroom doorway
and they dropped in front of him to the floor then only ten min later i
had gone down to a neighbours to tell them i had the keys when my husband
was sitting on the door step and our heavy wooden coffee table flew over
with such a force that my deaf dog came flying down and stood furiously
barking at the living room, this frightened my husband so much he had difficulty
ringing me on my mobile when he got through i could hear he was shaking
and flew back home, there on its side was the table and perched on my computer
screen was a photo of our wedding day and my husband tim was so frightened
he could hardly breath.i can only think that the table was to get our attention
and that the photo was a reminder to us that we married each other and
that we should stick together through these very trying times we are experiencing,
thanks ghost for helping us</b><b></b>

<br><b>Last night My friends and I went out to the haunted tracks. We first
put the car facing the East and nothing happened. So we drove up past the
bus graveyard and made a u-turn. There was a car about a mile off so we
decided to make it quick since nothing happend the first time. We put it
in nuetral, then someone that was in the car decided to hop out and get
this ratty basketball that is always laying on the side of the road there.
She ran back to the car, and said she heard a thud outside by the tracks.
As soon as she said this the car began to move. I didn't feel a cold chill,
but I knew something wasn't right. I don't think those spirits are too
nice. As we drove away we threw out the ball.&nbsp; We didn't check for
finger prints, we knew what happened.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Gran</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: squaddiemissis@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello my name is Laura Munro, I have already told you about my visits
from my gran but we live in an area of germany that was used by the nazi
party. we are posted to a little place called fallingbostel. here the jews
were carted of trains to make there final journey to Bergan Belsen consentration
camp. The camp my husband works in is right beside the old train staion
they arrived at. ( these were used in shindlers list the film) every time
we pass these buildings my 18 month old daughter just will not look and
quite often cries her heart out till we are past them. i often see the
figures stepping from what seems to be mid air on to the platform then
through the trees they go or a figure of a few german soldiers. i am not
the only one who sees these people the ammount of brits that will not drive
past there after sertain time is unbelievable. Sometimes when we have to
go to Hohne camp we have to travel on the range roads these are the roads
only for the military we see and hear lots of things. there is a piece
of road that is cobbled that is part of the road the jews had been marched
up to belsen a soldier broke down there once and was found by a passer
by crying because he heard the cries of women and children begging to be
left alone this sol er had been in the army for 19 years. not that long
ago my husband and i had to go to hohne about 9 at nght on the way back
it was getting dark. when we traveled through a group of people dressed
in 40's clothes my husband thought it was that "real" he braked and when
he did so they dissapeared. he will not travel that road after 22.00. My
gran always seems to appear if we are on that road she tells me its "just
in case" what ever that means. nothing happens when she is there.</b><b></b>

<p><b>My grandma's house is kinda freeky. One day I had my best friend
over at my grandma's. It was sorta like a bbq. Anyway, we went upstairs
to my grandma Margerett's "old" bed room. It's really freeky, it has brakeable
dolls, about 82 (I COUNTED!). It also has a bunch of scary pictures from
a long time ago. They are black and white, the days were it wasn't wright
to smile (my grandma told me). we (y friend and i) wre looking around when
we kept heering these -boome!!- noises in the other room, the first room
on the right.&nbsp; We tried to ignore it, but it kept on happening. We
finally got the sragnth to go see what it was. I walked in first there
was nothing there but... the light in the walk in closet was on and the
door was open. I took a peek, but nothing was there. I figured the house
was just setteling. As I walked out of the room the door started to close!
i was about to go baserk, but desided to test what I saw. I opened the
door and pushed it all the way back to the wall, and it closed again. I
pushed it back again and put a trash can in front of it.............It
closed. I ran out of the room with my friend right behind me. I tried to
tell my parents but they wouldn't listen. After com'ing inside...(keep
in mind, every1 was outside) i came in and the table was sett! it was so
scary but no1 believed us. from that day on ive been really scared of her

<p><b>Made me a Believer</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sweet_oleanders@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My experiences happened a few years ago in New Zealand. The house
where we</b>
<br><b>lived was the same one where my mother had grown up and had returned
to</b>
<br><b>after her wedding. My first sighting was when i was about six i
had gotten</b>
<br><b>up and was coming back to my bedroom and standing at the foot of
my bed was</b>
<br><b>a very beautiful woman in a beautiful blue dress. I ran past her
and hid</b>
<br><b>under my pillow. The next occurences didn't happen until a few years
later</b>
<br><b>when we started to renevate. I would often wake up to see a man
standing on</b>
<br><b>the other side of the room he was wearing blue jean overalls and
had no</b>
<br><b>head. But it wasn't until the renevations were finished that it
got worse.</b>
<br><b>We added stairs from the first floor to the second as the first
floor had</b>
<br><b>only been used as storage and one of the rooms was still dirt. That
room was</b>
<br><b>converted into the starwell, and the main room was a play room for
me and my</b>
<br><b>sister. The bottom of the stairwell was inhabited by an old lady
dressed in</b>
<br><b>calonial style clothes and her hair in a bun. My sister and I saw
her many</b>
<br><b>times , if this wasn't scary enough there was the feeling of evil
at the</b>
<br><b>bottom of the stairs even when she wasn't there those stairs made
you feel</b>
<br><b>terror. There was also another young lady who I saw a few times
standing at</b>
<br><b>the doorway of my sisters room watching her sleep. Other things
also</b>
<br><b>happened like my camera being thrown off a shelf and hitting the
wall across</b>
<br><b>the room breaking it. The radio turning itself on and off, other
things</b>
<br><b>falling or moving.</b>
<br><b>After my grandmother died i heard her call my name on two different</b>
<br><b>occastions . My mother came home one day to find all of the pictures
of her</b>
<br><b>parents lying face down. Most of these hauntings I could manage
until one</b>
<br><b>day my family was away leaving me at home for a week or so during
this time</b>
<br><b>i would go to the garage daily to do the washing or so forth then
a few days</b>
<br><b>before my parents were to return i walked into the garage and sitting
in the</b>
<br><b>middle of the path around the car was the old goats head my father

<br><b>and stuffed that had not been there earlier that day. The hauntings
didn't</b>
<br><b>worry any of us except that lady in the stairwell i will never forget
that</b>
<br><b>feeling that came over you at the bottom.</b>
<br><b>The hauntings lasted about ten years and then ubrubtly stopped we

the age 8 or 9. She wears a white dress and she has black hair. I have
seen her many times but she has never caused any harm. But one night i
was upstairs in my new room listening to Blink182 and i heard a young girl
talking. I ecnored it and then my dad yelled for me i got up and went to
the top of the stairs and said what and he asked if i had been downstairs?
And i said no. Then i asked why? And he said that he had heard some thing.
I went downstairs and sat down and said what did you hear? And he said
I heard a young girl talking I jumped up shocked to know that he heard
it too. He said it was talking and that he had been asleep and some thing
woke him up and he shot up and then he heard a girl talking. I was shocked
to know that i wasnt the only one who had heard this. I wish i could have
made out what she was saying but i couldnt. But if any thing else happens
i will send that story in. I swear to god this story is true!</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Devil in the Night</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: slimynot@netzero.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My first experience was when I was 16 and I woke up at least I thought
I was awake or I didn't know what I was. But I heard pictures on my shelf
flying off and like evil voices speaking really loud in my room. But I
couldn't focus on anything, I couldn't move, I couldn't even breathe. I
was terrified and then finally came to my senses and everything was quiet
but I was so weak and scared I couldn't get up and tell any one in my house
what had happened. The second time I felt paralyzed and felt like I was
floating off my bed and I was trying to say something but I don't know
what I was trying to say. I couldn't breathe but finally yelled, "I believe
in god". I didn't understand why I yelled it all I thought was that some
kind of demon was trying to get to me. Another time I felt someone grabbing
me and holding me down, I was terrified but couldn't scream or move.&nbsp;
All I could think was to breathe and to call my mom to help me.&nbsp; Right
after I was thinking that I heard a voice very distinctly in my ear saying
"Yes try to move your arm","Call to your mom, breathe!!". I couldn't tell
you how terrified I was or how crazy I thought I was.&nbsp; As soon as
I could move I got up very weak, and ran to my mom and told her what had
just happened.&nbsp; She kept telling me I was dreaming but I knew I was
awake. I am scared to go to sleep sometimes but have to tell myself it's
some kind of sleeping disorder or a sleep paralysis.</b>

<br><b>Personal Paranormal Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: maypop@kyaccess.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am a native of Middlesboro, Kentucky; a small recreational town
nudged up against the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.&nbsp; Although
I have been interested in the paranormal my entire life, I've only had
one genuine experience with things of this nature.&nbsp; One of my favorite
things to do for fun is to take my sport utility off-roading.&nbsp; Several
of my friends and I take to the mountains at least once a week to get a
good fill of the serenity of the nature that surrounds us; most of them
owning SUV's as well.&nbsp; One particular night, my friend and I, whom
I will call Jeff, decided to take a little ride up to one of the strip
mining jobs that surround our town.&nbsp; The going isn't that rough, but
you're still engulfed by the forest.&nbsp; It was somewhere in the neighborhood
of nine o'clock, and we were making our way around one of the more difficult
trails that branched off from the main trail.&nbsp; We had decided to turn
around and head back, so he spotted a side road and began to do so.&nbsp;
As his headlights swept across an open field, he hit his brakes sharply,
and we both sat motionless for a few moments.&nbsp; There, in the middle
of this field was a black silhouette of what looked like a large man wearing
a broad-brimmed hat.&nbsp; It looked to be about eight or nine feet tall,
and very broad.&nbsp; We tried to shine our lights on it, but it was as
if the entity sucked the light up into itself.&nbsp; It was almost like
it was made of shadows.&nbsp; I asked him if he saw what I saw, and replying
that he did, he promptly put his Jeep in reverse, and we sped down the
mountain as speechless as two statues.&nbsp; The big black shape we saw
never moved as we hastened to relieve ourselves of its presence.&nbsp;
It just stood and seemed to watch as if amused by our fear.&nbsp; Needless
to say, we haven't covered that area in a while...</b>

<p><b>What was It?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SJCook@EDKRAEMER.COM</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have never seen or experienced anything paranormal, except this
once...I was 20 years old.&nbsp; My younger sister and brother and I were
rough housing one night in the kitchen/family room area of our small three
bedroom house.&nbsp; I forget what we were doing, but we were being really
hyper and noisy.&nbsp; Our mom came from the hallway and quite angrily
told us to be quiet...she and our dad were sleeping.&nbsp; Not two minutes
went by and we were back to our antics.&nbsp; At one point I pushed both
my siblings onto the small couch sitting against the wall and window.&nbsp;
Just then, it sounded as if a very large person slapped the window as hard
as possible without breaking it.&nbsp; The curtains shook...the three of
us were so scared we tried to squeeze down the hall to our parents room
all at once.&nbsp; We woke up our dad to investigate, but he found no one.&nbsp;
There wasn't a trace of anything having hit or been thrown at the window.&nbsp;
A sonic boom would have shaken all the windows and made the news.&nbsp;
I think whatever it was wanted us to obey our parents...scary!</b><b></b>

<p><b>SPARKEL BABY</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Deidra.Mascarenes@Stocksupply.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This experience goes back to when I was at the young age of 4 years
old.&nbsp; My family of 2 sisters, 3 brothers, mom &amp; dad moved into
a small one bedroom rented house.</b>
<br><b>Times were hard and all of us kids slept on a full sized fold out
cot/bed mama would fold out in the kitchen for us kids to sleep, while
her and dad slept on separate sofas in the front room.&nbsp; All us kids
lay side by side in the fold out bed like sardines.&nbsp; One night, after
everyone had gone to bed/sleep, I woke up and couldn't fall back asleep.&nbsp;
As I lay there I saw something come through the kitchen window.&nbsp; It
was the shape of a baby, but it was full of different color sparkles, and
it was not really flying, more like floating around in the dark,&nbsp;
high in the air, between the kitchen and front room where my parents were
sleeping.&nbsp; I kept looking at it, as I discretely covered up to my
eyes with my blanket. I became very frightened.&nbsp; It floated towards
where my parents were sleeping.&nbsp; I said aloud "Get away from them!"
and then it suddenly turned and came right at me.&nbsp; I screamed out
a shrill scream and it made a quick turn behind the stove.&nbsp; Needless
to say I woke up everyone in the house. I explained to mama/dad what I
had seen and what happened.&nbsp; They turned on all the lights but could
not find anything.&nbsp; I lay back down but kept my head covered with
a blanket,&nbsp; I did not want to see anything any more.&nbsp; As I lay
there, covered, I heard my mama whisper to may dad......"I told you it
was not a good idea to rent near a cemetery'.&nbsp; I did not see it ever
again, and we did not live inn that house very long.</b>

<br><b>The House in Eastdale</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: DaveWhedbee@consolenergy.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>hello my name is David. This happened a few years ago and nobody
believes my wife or me. I found your web site and now maybe someone will
believe us. Here it goes:</b>
<br><b>my wife and I found a apt to rent in Baltimore co. It was one of
those apartments where it is a town home where we had the first floor and
the basement and someone else had the second floor.So we called to look
at the apt. and all seem well with it. After about 1month and a half strange
things started happening and it came from the basement of all places because
that is where we slept. we were sleeping and my wife woke me up and she
was crying and I was half asleep, she said I heard voices and I didn't
believe in ghost or sprits at that time. I would say about a half a hour
later my wife woke me up again yelling didn't your hear them get up,get
up. So I got up a she said she heard voices that sounded like they were
under water laughing, I told her it problem was a nightmare and go back
to sleep. The next time the same thing happened so she refused to sleep
in the basement anymore. So we started to sleep up stairs and I even heard
strange noises coming for the basement,banging and laughing. It sounded
like a old man and old women. We called the landlord and he came over and
I tried to tell him about the voices and ask did a old couple die in this
house and he looked at me with this strange look like he knew something
and how did we know,but he laughed and said no,got mad and said if you
don't like it here just move and he left. A couple days later we were talking
to a neighbor and we figure we will tell her, and she replied that is what
the last couple of people said that lived there said and no one lives in
there long. One night my daughter my a mess on the floor and I got her
out of her high chair and got down to clean the mess up when all of the
sudden the basement door flew open and she started running towards the
steps.Lucky I made it there before her.Sometimes I would be in the basement
and I would her my wife call for me and I would answer her and she would
reply what do u want I didn't call you and this happened every time I was
down there. If I was down there taking a shower the shower curtain would
blow around me tight and there was no vent down there. So what made our
last few nights there was my wife making comments to me about me changing.
I said to her what do you mean she said I wont shave and I'm acting alot
different and saying I love this house. And to this day I do not remember
any of that. Before we moved we got a dog and he was about 2 years old
and we put him in the basement to sleep .He woke me up in the middle of
the night howling and banging against the door wanted out.So I put him
out side and he wouldn't come back to the door so I went out and picked
him up he was fine and carried him towards the basement and he tried to
tear me apart and ran outside so I left him out there. Our last day at
the house we checked to make sure we had everything and my wife was standing
there with me and I yelled see you house and a old man replied get out.
I looked at my wife and she looked ate me and I yelled go to hell and we
got out of there. So we thought everything was fine and we were driving
to our new home and all of a sudden a car came from no where and ran into
us. That car was no where in sight so was it the house???? No one believes
us to these day.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Hot Lake, Oregon/Union County</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:Eric.E.Arner@nordstrom.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I know the Hot Lake Sanatorium.&nbsp; I have been inside many times
and personally know people who have worked there in the past.&nbsp; Several
times it has been rented for other business purposes.&nbsp; A spa, camp
ground, restaurant, dried fruit company.&nbsp; It actually had a very bad
fire back in the day which killed many people (I think around 1909 but
am not sure I will have to read the book I have at home) .&nbsp; I have
acquired several pieces of artifacts from Hot Lake.&nbsp; A picture of
Dr William T Fey(and nursing staff), who was the original Dr. who did ground
breaking medical procedures on many patients that were at the sanatorium.&nbsp;
I also have an invitation to the "resort" and a canceled check from a patient
made out to Dr Fey.&nbsp; At one time it used to be a gathering place for
tribes in the area.&nbsp; It was a non-violent place at the time.&nbsp;
The tribes of the area who were always fighting made Hot Lake a neutral
place because of its natural springs were thought to be sacred.&nbsp; When
I went there you could find masses of dear and animal antlers/bones almost
as if it were a "dying grounds".&nbsp; If you go into the barn just south
of the main hotel you can see all of the old wheel chairs and strange operating
tables the Dr Fey used in his glory days.&nbsp; If you go to the north
east side of the hotel you can see a "caldron" that goes to down into the
water of the underground part of the lake.&nbsp; It is actually from what
I have heard starting to sink into the hot lake.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunting for PA</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: skakol@comcast.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>back where my i grew up on polish hill of pittsburgh, there lurks
some kind of energy. My parents still relate to the sotrie that have happened
in the house while my mom was takin care of me as a child and my dad renevating
the apartments there. One of the stories is that our old dog, a cairn terrier
named cheech, would never go up to the third floor alone and she would
bark continously up the stairs.</b>
<br><b>One of the best related to stories though is one of our poltergeist
up in the third floor of our old place. One night when my dad had finished
painting upstairs and my dad and mom purchased a large framed picture with
glass over it. It had been leaning on the wall across from the windows.
Just as my dad finished cleaning up he and my mother had heard a large
crash, they ran upstairs and found that the picture had been thrown by
"something" across the room, it couldnt have been the wind cause it was
across the room and broke the glass in one of the windows and the glass
on the frame. No one was upstairs cause my father had just finished cleaning
up the paint brushes and paint splatters. We still try to think of what
it could have been besides our ghost.</b>
<br><b>Another very good story of the old place is when my dad was on his
way home from work one night my mom satyed up waiting for him and heard
a door slam, knowing my dad for being in bad moods when he worked there
she walked down to see if he was home, turns out someone or something had
slammed to door shut, i remember my mom saying that was the last time the
ghost bothered us before we moved.</b>
<br><b>What makes this even more awkward though is that even in our new
house out here weird things happen, nothing violent or of the sort but
just lights flicker and short outages and yet when we called our neighbors
or my aunt and grandma about it (they live down the street from us now)
there power was fine, nothing happened, so i think in my head that one
of ghosts had followed us and just plays pranks here and there.</b>
<br><b>so these are the few stories i have to tell about our old house
and few in the new, currently we found out that someone else has bought
the place and renevating it since it was vandalised and painted over my
dads work.</b><b></b>

<p><b>HOUSE GHOSTS AND ANOTHER STORY THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE HOUSE
GHOSTS</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: punkrockBrittanyb@msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I'm not really an avid believer in ghosts but I have had some incidents
that are telling my conscious otherwise. After several years of trying
to scrounge together money, my parents finally saved enough to buy their
dream cabin/house in the mountains. When we moved, I was in 8th grade.
The house my parents bought were recently owned by rich Texans who used
it as a summer house, and various other people like that. The original
owners built the house and had seven children. I never understood where
they put all of the children because the house only has three bedrooms
and a small room, like a pet's room which is now used as my mother's office.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, I always had a sense that there was an evil presence in
my house. Every time I would go up to the third floor, which is the loft,
I felt like there was someone laughing at me, or constantly watching me.
That place and my brother's room in the basement were the only places I
really didn't feel safe sleeping in. So, one day, I was upstairs sleeping
in the loft because my uncle was staying in my room for the night. My mother
was sleeping on the couch, and I was on the floor. I'm not good at falling
asleep, it usually takes me like 2-whatever hours to finally be asleep.
So I was lying there on my side, trying to fall asleep with my mom snoring
in the background. That was when I started to hear what sounded like two
young girls whispering to each other. I could definitely hear what they
were saying, but I couldn't understand it, I thought it was strange, but
my blood wasn't rushing like i was scared. Then, louder, I heard giggling
and I began to get scared. I called my mother's name and drowsily, she
asked "what", and I asked her if she had just giggled, but she started
yelling at me because i woke her up. I was in tenth grade then.</b>
<br><b>Here's another one that happened in my brother's room. I'm not telling
these in order, but they don't really have to be in order. My sister, before
she moved out, and I (in 9th grade) shared my a room that is now my brother's
room, because it was large and was called the family room. I was alone
in my bed watching television when I heard someone calling my name so I
muted the volume and didn't hear anything. Then, all of a sudden, a hand
slapped down on my bed next to my feet and i heard a voice laugh like someone
was excited or happy. I don't like to be scared at all, so I ignored it
completely and turned up the volume on the tv and turned the lights on.</b>
<br><b>Years later, like a couple of months ago, I was trying to get to
sleep in my bed when a loud thumping sound slammed into my pillow right
next to by bed causing my head to move from the impact and my hair to flow
from the wind. It felt like someone was trying to hit me really hard but
missed. I thought for awhile that it was my brother, because he's a brat,
but i realized that he was over at a friends house. Again, I decided to
ignore it.</b>
<br><b>Since I have fallen down the stairs many times, like my feet have
been pulled out from under me, along with my father, who broke his ankle
walking down the stairs, i try to ignore whatever is in the house, or not
to anger it. I believe it is the original owners of the house, like the
father and mother, and their children.</b>
<br><b>Here something that happened to my mother back around 1994-1995.
she claims it was true.</b>
<br><b>my grandfather died in 1994 and was loved by everyone who knew him.
My mother was asleep in her bed and she said she dreamed this. Her father
was standing at the end of the bed looking over her and smiled and my mom
sat up, amazed to see him because he was dead. He told her that the Denver
Broncos were going to loose the game the next day. She woke up and thought
it was the weirdest dream. Anyway, being a diehard fan of the Broncos,
my mom watched the game and guess what, they lost. This may seem like a
fake story, but she said it was true. But it makes sense to our family
because my grandfather was a big sports fan and often took his children
to baseball and football games.</b>
<br><b>so here's some stories that are true, even if you don't believe
in ghosts, like me</b>

<p><b>Ghost Hunting for the First Time</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lefer337@yahoo.com .</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I had always been interested in the super natural, but never really
experienced anything so crazy, . However, after my trip to St. Augustine....I
AM A FIRM BELIEVER.</b>
<br><b>About a year a ago, my friend and I visited St. Augustine, In Florida
( the oldest city) for vacation. We ended up going on a ghost tour during
early night..7:oo pm. on the Ghost tour we learned about a haunted Bed-and-
Breakfast and a few houses down was a small cemetery. The cemetery was
blocked off so you could only walk around&nbsp; the front of it ( it was
also on Indian burial ground) but you could easily see the whole cemetery.</b>
<br><b>After the tour my friend and I decided to go back to to the Bed-and-
breakfast and the cemetery later that night by ourselves with a video camera
and a regular camera and do a little ghost hunting ourselves.</b>
<br><b>We ending up going at 4:oo am in the morning and it was a full moon.
Before we even got their we were both nervous.</b>
<br><b>We were desperate to see something, we were standing on the side
walk in front of the Bed-and Breakfast, it was two stories and the second
floor had a porch with a door right in the middle. Where we&nbsp; were
standing we could see the whole front of the house including top porch.
and every window.</b>
<br><b>My friend was video taping ( we were taking along shot to get something
on film). We were just filming and we weren't seeing anything so I began
talking out loud... I began asking, is it true what they say about this
house? Is Someone their? We are not hear to hurt you.. stuff like that,
but nothing happened.We didn't see anything.. not even a movement. We both
began to feel as if someone were watching us ( maybe a guest staying their)
.</b>
<br><b>We were also bored because we weren't experiencing anything, so
we walked down to the Cemetery. Once in front of the gate, I was taking
pictures of the cemetery and my friend was complaining that the video kept
getting blurry and than the battery died ( we charged the battery fully
before we left that night and it never died that fast ever).</b>
<br><b>We&nbsp; both began to feel like we were being watched again so
we left ..fast.</b>
<br><b>HERE IS THE SCARY PART!!</b>
<br><b>When we got back to the hotel, we charged the battery again because
we wanted to watch the film..</b>
<br><b>We watched the film and to our amazement, the film had something
totally different than what we saw!! The Bed-and Breakfast, on the second
floor their was a little boy peeking out of the glass door, the camera
than showed me talking to the house and when it was focused on the porch
again the boy was outside on the porch walking back inside, you could see
the back of his head and it looked like he was floating back inside and
the door closed right behind him, You could even hear the door shut on
the video!! We were standing right there didn't see ANYTHING!!. There was
no way if anybody came out the door window anything we would see, it was
a matter of a few feet.The boys clothes looked brown and old and was a
little blury.</b>
<br><b>By that point we were so shocked and scared..</b>
<br><b>When the camera turned on by the Cemetery, from what we saw with
our eyes was darkness. There were no lights in the Cemetery at all. The
video showed&nbsp; bright white human figures and&nbsp; it looked like
they were carrying something over their heads into a even brighter light..
and than shut off.</b>
<br><b>It was the crazies thing I ever seen, because I was their and we
didn't experience or see anything but when we watched the film their was
sh*t on their that we didn't see at all. I can't figure it out.</b>
<br><b>Your probably thinking what about the pictures I took. When I developed
them I have a few with Orbs ( learned that after researching&nbsp; about
it) in the cemetery, and one big reddish-orange over my head from down
the block of the bed-and Breakfast.</b>
<br><b>If you want to experience or physical evidence..visit St. Augustine.
It's unbelievable!!</b>
<br><b>Or if you can explain or had a similar experience please please
email me.</b><b></b>

<br><b>A Strange Voice</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: heyjude42@comcast.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>This incident happened in 1979.&nbsp; I had been on vacation and
had arrived back at my home in Oakland, CA.&nbsp; There were two houses
in our complex and my apartment was in the back.&nbsp; My neighbor Dan
lived in the front house on the top floor.&nbsp; I had to pass under his
window to get to my apartment.&nbsp; It was a very still day,&nbsp; It
had just rained and was warm and humid, unusual for northern California.&nbsp;
When I passed under my neighbor's window it suddenly got very cold.&nbsp;
I was chilled to the bone.&nbsp; I looked up to see the curtain in his
window waving in the wind.&nbsp; I thought that strange since there was
no wind.&nbsp; Then, a&nbsp; voice in my head said, "He's dead."&nbsp;
I'm not psychic or anything like that, so I ignored it.</b>
<br><b>I did knock on my neighbor's door, but he did not answer.&nbsp;
I wondered about this for a few days.&nbsp; His car was parked out front.&nbsp;
Well, I got busy with my life, school had started again.&nbsp; A few days
later I came home to see people in front of his apartment.&nbsp; I spoke
to the woman there who turned out to be his sister.&nbsp; She told me he
had passed away and was dead for about a week.&nbsp; To this day I wonder
if I should have done something like call the police, although, I know
he was already gone.&nbsp; This taught me a lesson though, and that is
to listen and follow your intuition.&nbsp; I had&nbsp; sensed something
wrong and did nothing.</b><b></b>

<p><b>A Trilogy of Ghost encounters at Dad's</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sarkatmoon@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;Okay, I was staying at my Dad's a month ago. It</b>
<br><b>is an old house, built in 1795.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; At dinner he and my Step mum told me that their</b>
<br><b>house was haunted. As a staunch believer in the</b>
<br><b>supernatural, and ghosts I was excited and a</b>
<br><b>little scared. They told about a man in a trench</b>
<br><b>coat they had seen and spirit in their room which</b>
<br><b>was not of this plane.&nbsp; And of course, I was told</b>
<br><b>the ghost would not harm me in any way.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; That night of course, I was on edge about</b>
<br><b>anything specteral. As I watched TV around</b>
<br><b>midnight or one AM, I saw a tan colored streak</b>
<br><b>dart into the bathroom out of the corner of my</b>
<br><b>eye. I gave the spirit(s) a small warning about</b>
<br><b>scaring me. Eventually, I continued writing and</b>
<br><b>watching TV. Though, by the time I went to bed on</b>
<br><b>my little cot, the spirits were back for an</b>
<br><b>encore. As I tried to sleep (seething with</b>
<br><b>paranoia and fear) my dad's cat curled in the</b>
<br><b>small of my back I felt something. Something was</b>
<br><b>touching my foot, then pressing down on the edge</b>
<br><b>of the cot. I jerked my foot away and buried my</b>
<br><b>head under the covers.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; The night passed with no more event.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;But then, next morning the Phantom Trilogy camt</b>
<br><b>to a peak.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; iwatched, The Lord of the Rings: Return of</b>
<br><b>the King with my dad, I saw a most bizarre thing(</b>
<br><b>not onscreen). Over head a black thing, shaped</b>
<br><b>like a dove, flew overhead and out the window. I</b>
<br><b>told my dad and he replied:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;"Oh, you'll see that one"</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;So ends my Triolgy. I have many more stories to</b>
<br><b>end, for in my short fifteen years of life I have</b>
<br><b>encountered a few strange things. And I may have</b>
<br><b>many more in the future.</b>
