<P><B>Soldiers go to battle and then hopefully, return home.&nbsp; However,
there are some that never return home even in death.&nbsp; These specters
are referred to as "Spectral Armies" and consist of soldiers that have
battled in life and continue to do battle after death.&nbsp; We are given
several instances of ghostly armies coming to the aid of the Israelites
in the bible, residents of countries where battles have been fought, and
even St. Augustine has reported such a phenomenal occurrence.</B>

<P><B>It is a common belief that victims who experience strong emotional
events, extreme pain, horrible or tragic deaths, and suicides are</B> <B>more
likely to remain behind to wander restlessly.&nbsp; Clearly, soldiers experience
extreme emotional highs and lows in battle, excruciating pain, as well
as tragic and horrible deaths.&nbsp; It is no wonder then that there are
numerous reports of past battles still being played out in the sky or in
the location of their deadly battle.</B>

<P><B>One would tend to believe that this particular occurrence would be
rare, however, there are far too many instances of witnesses either seeing
or hearing past battles.</B>

<P><B>Here are a few:</B>

<P><B>In the pamphlet The City of God, St. Augustine records that a roman
battle was seen and heard occurring on a plain in Campania.&nbsp; Actual
footprints of soldiers and their horses were observed on the ground.&nbsp;
Was this a battle that had occurred earlier?&nbsp; No, it was a battle
yet to take place.&nbsp; The battle happened shortly after witnesses viewed
the battle of this spectral army.</B>

<P><B>In 1537 the Turkish army of Suleyman the Magnificent was set to besiege
the city of Otranto.&nbsp; However, Otranto was saved by an army of 800
martyrs who appeared on the city walls accompanied by angels too numerous
to count.&nbsp; These martyrs were reported to have fought in 1480 with
their bodies being left unburied on the battlefield for thirteen months.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Again in 1644 this army again saved Otranto from an onslaught by invading
Ottoman.</B>

<P><B>In 1836 another ghostly army was seen on the Ballyfriar hills.&nbsp;
As was the case with St. Augustine, this army also left physical traces
of their presence.&nbsp; Other ghostly battles have left physical evidence
as well.&nbsp; In 1686 there is a record of showers where bonnets hats,
guns and swords fell from the sky.&nbsp; England and Scotland have records
of these type of showering events such as this happening.</B>

<P><B>In Scotland, a woman was out driving one evening when she saw what
appeared to be the Battle of Nechtanesmere that was fought in 685 AD.&nbsp;
Startled, she drove her car into a ditch leaving her stranded.&nbsp; She
decided to walk the rest of the way home via country lanes carrying her
small dog.&nbsp; Within minutes her dog began to growl and struggle. Looking
up, she saw people coming towards her carrying lit torches.&nbsp; The men
were bending down turning over bodies that were lying on the ground as
if looking for fallen comrades.&nbsp; The woman reported her encounter
and described the clothing to a history researcher.&nbsp; Her experience
matched the dress of Pictish warriors.</B>

<P><B>1953 Harry Martindale reported seeing Roman soldiers stepping out
of a wall in the basement of a home in York, UK.&nbsp; He reports to having
heard a sound, almost like a blaring trumpet.&nbsp; Immediately following
the trumpet blare, a Roman soldier walked across the basement floor after
having stepped through the wall.&nbsp; Others followed walking in pairs.&nbsp;
Some were on foot while others were on horseback.&nbsp; The helmets were
plumed, they carried a short sword on their right-hand side, and their
clothing was handmade of cloth in shades of green.&nbsp; The weird thing
of this particular sighting was the soldiers and horses were only visible
from their knees upward. The reason for this was due to the road having
only been excavated so far down.&nbsp; In other words, the rest of the
road was still buried but enough had been cleared for the apparitions to
be mostly visible.</B>

<P><B>November 1956 two brothers were camping in the Cullin Mountains of
Skye when they were awakened by the battle cries of kilted Highlanders
charging across the ground.&nbsp; The next night, around 4 in the morning,
the brothers were awakened again by the same ghostly army of Highlanders.&nbsp;
This time the Highlanders were in retreat stumbling and trying to run for
their lives.</B>

<P><B>In the United States one can witness the battle that occurred at
Hat Creek Monument in northwestern Nebraska involving Cheyenne Indians
and soldiers of the Fifth U.S. Calvary.&nbsp; Witnesses to this re-enactment
have heard disembodied voices and unexplained noises as well as sometimes
seeing ectoplasmic mist and phantoms.&nbsp; The spirits are aggressive
but usually avoid human contact.&nbsp; It is not known whether or not a
person would be safe if he/she entered into the battle.</B>

<P><B>Another battle that is often seen again and again is the Battle of
Little Bighorn from June 25, 1876 in Montana involving a large number of
U.S. soldiers who died in the battle including General Custer.&nbsp; Witnesses
have reported seeing ghost lights and ghost soldiers.&nbsp; They have also
reported an overwhelming and intense feeling of sorrow, hopelessness and
sadness.&nbsp; The haunting is not limited to the battlefield.&nbsp; The
spirits have taken up occupying the Visitors Center, Last Stand Hill, The
Stone House (where the employees once slept), and the Battlefield Cemetery.&nbsp;
General Custer is reportedly seen most often in the Battlefield Museum.</B>

<P><B>Harpers Ferry in West Virginia is another scene of a pre-civil war
battle.&nbsp; This one involves the fighting that led to the capture and</B>
<B>execution of John Brown, a well-known slavery abolitionist.</B>

<P><B>The Battle of Gettysburg is another battle that is frequently witnessed
by people today.&nbsp; The three-day battle spilled more blood</B> <B>and
death than any other battle in the history of the U.S. on home soil in
such a short period of time.&nbsp; Witnesses have reported the</B> <B>sounds
of gunfire, shouting, screaming, and moans of pain and dying.&nbsp; There
have been ghostly soldiers lying on the battlefield dying, soldiers marching
and cleaning their weapons preparing for the battle, and even the battlefield
hospitals complete with doctors treating the wounded and dying have been
seen and heard.</B>

<P><B>One must wonder if the battles of past will continue to be fought
forever or will the soldiers eventually find their way home or at</B>
<BR><B>least to a peaceful existence in the afterworld.&nbsp; Some have
offered up different speculations as to the existence of these apparitions.&nbsp;
They include a vivid imagination, a reflection of a battle somewhere else
in the world being projected through the sky or water (actually, they lost
me when this one was being explained) to a time slip.</B>

<P><B>A vivid imagination can be responsible for a lot of things but I
don't think that is the case here.&nbsp; Not when you have many people
at different times reporting similar events and feelings. Further, the
suggestion that the apparitions are a result of a reflection of</B> <B>another
battle?&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; I have some prime land for sale in the middle
of the Everglades.&nbsp; A time slip, I guess could be possible but more
than likely the energy of the battle and the pain, suffering, dying, and
tragedy of a battle is so overwhelmingly strong that I believe it is forever
burned in the aura or location of the battle.&nbsp; This could explain
why soldiers are seen preparing for battle and the search afterwards for
their comrades.</B>

<P><B>One other thought before I end this - think about all the apparitions
that have been reported and the weird sounds and lights one can sometimes
see that are not of this world.&nbsp; They are not usually of human beings
that experienced a "normal" death or life.&nbsp; We hear almost always
only about those apparitions or occurrences where tragedy, violence, pain,
suffering, or a severe injustice has been done robbing the person(s) of
a happy life.&nbsp; Yes, occasionally one will hear about the little old
lady's rocking chair that rocks long after her departure to the afterworld
but who is to say she was happy?&nbsp; She may not have died a violent
death and she may have lived a full life but at some point near her death
she suffered a major heartache - perhaps she was alone or her family no
longer visited.&nbsp; Pain and suffering comes in many forms as do hauntings.</B>
