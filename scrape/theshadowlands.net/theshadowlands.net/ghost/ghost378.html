<p class="MsoNormal">House that is Haunted</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>christine@gotoclicks.com</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I sent a post to you regarding <st1:Street><st1:address>Oakcrest
  Drive</st1:address></st1:Street> in House Springs MO. Then I saw the link for
personal experience and decided to send you this too. I live in a house on <st1:Street><st1:address>Oakcrest
  Drive</st1:address></st1:Street> with my mother (Cathy), sister (<st1:City><st1:place>Andria</st1:place></st1:City>),
two brothers (Ryan &amp; Justen), my mother&#8217;s boyfriend (Richard) and his son
(Alex). It all started before we moved in. My mother, <st1:City><st1:place>Andria</st1:place></st1:City>,
and I would come over and do some cleaning for Richard while he was at work.
One afternoon while we were cleaning the basement family room, we heard
footsteps in the upstairs hallway. We thought that maybe Richard was home. When
we went upstairs the house was empty, so we left. Occasionally Richard&#8217;s
granddaughter (Briana) will come over and my mother and I will watch her. One
afternoon while we were sitting on the couch, Briana jumped into my mother&#8217;s
arms and starting saying &#8220;Grandma, there&#8217;s a scary man going into Grandpa&#8217;s
room.&#8221; She was two years old at the time. Later that same day she came out of
the basement family room saying that the scary man was down there too. On a
more recent night, Briana stayed over and slept in the room that used to be her
mother&#8217;s and she couldn&#8217;t sleep, and she was crying all night long. Richard had
told me that when Briana&#8217;s mother was little she would have night terrors in
that room to the point where she was scared of even her mother and Richard. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="3">3AM</st1:time> on
most nights you can hear heavy footsteps in the hallway like someone wearing
boots. Sometimes it even sounds like running. The coat closet door and linen
closet doors can be found open on most mornings, by them selves. One night my
bedroom door was opened so hard that it banged into the wall and then I heard
footsteps walking down the hall. I went to go see who was up and found everyone
asleep. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Every morning you can find the dinning room chairs pulled
out from the table by themselves too. We&#8217;ve gotten pretty used to it now, to
the point where the footsteps don&#8217;t bother us. Everyone in the house has heard
them. In the morning we just close all the doors, push in the chairs and go
about our day. Most of the activity happens at night or in the afternoon. I
don&#8217;t know the history of the house or the street, but maybe something happened
here. The house isn&#8217;t that old, early sixties or seventies. I plan on doing a
little more research and I will keep you posted.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">in 1979, i was in the u.s. army in giessen, west germany as
a veterinary technician ...our office was on the first floor of a world war 2
era , 3 storey building, which, by the way was spooky enough in itself....at
the time, i was not only a vet tech, but the acting receptionist. my desk sat
in a corner about 10 to 15 feet away from a hallway to the back of our office
which was just off center enough that you could not see all the way down
it..just at the beginning of this hall, on the right hand side, was the door
into our exam room...i dont remember the exact date any more, but i certainly
remember what happened...i was sitting at my desk working on some records, when
i happened to look up, and, lo and behold, standing there just to the side of
the exam room door, was a man dressed in a white lab coat, with gray hair, and
black rimmed glasses just as plain as day...he was so real i believe you could
have actually touched him...anyhow, i looked at him, he looked at me, turned
and walked thru the wall!!! as i said before, i believe this building along
with others on our post, were from the time of nazi germa , and could have been
used for anything...i did not personally know the history of them...just a
note...i am used to this type of appearance...have been 'seeing' people my
whole life, and it does not even raise my hackles...before and since then, many
ethereal folks have passed thru my life on their way to or from
somewhere...write me and let me know if you use my story...take care...janice
weiss truitt...</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This takes place in a very small town in <st1:State><st1:place>Kentucky</st1:place></st1:State>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place><st1:City>Cumberland</st1:City>, <st1:State>Ky</st1:State></st1:place>,
in the mountains of <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Harlan</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>County</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a mining community with a very long
history attached to a certain coal mine in <st1:City><st1:place>Cumberland</st1:place></st1:City>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The entrance to the mine is right off of US
119, almost as soon as you enter the city of <st1:City><st1:place>Cumberland</st1:place></st1:City>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You turn right onto a very winding road that
literally dead ends at the foot of a mountain.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Right before you get to the dead end, on the right hand side, is a
bridge that you must cross to get to the mine entrance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More than a handful of people have lost there
lives on this road, seemingly to driving too fast on the very winding
road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What never made any sense to me is
that, everyone that lives in the area knows how dangerous this road can be, yet
every year, at least 2 or 3 deaths occur.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Probably about 4 months before my experience I lost a friend of mine on
the road when his truck rolled and he broke his neck, but the two girls that
were with him walked away without a scratch.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The unusual thing about that is that the girls would never say what
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was almost like they
"couldn't" talk about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One night, myself, my brother and his girlfriend were
driving up this road to see some friends of ours that lived right across the
road from the coal mine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember this
night just like last night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have never
been able to shake the horrible memory from my dreams.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As usual, we were driving with our high beams
on as there are no street lights on this road.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For some reason or another, we decided that it would probably be too
late to visit them as they had a small child that would be in bed before we got
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ted, my brother, drove all the
way to the dead end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He turned around on
a gravel spot and just before he started to drive off, an extremely bright
light appeared behind us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in the
back seat and said aloud "Damn, that moon is bright", but then when I
looked through the front windshield I saw the moon quite clearly in front of
us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm not sure what happened, but Ted
just floored the accelerator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We drove
out of there like a bat out of hell.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When we got back to town, we pulled over in a parking lot to calm down
and try to figure out what it was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
a few minutes of discussion we decided that it was probably poachers out
looking for deer or something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We just
dropped it after that.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A few nights later, we had made plans to play cards at our
friends house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was around <st1:time minute="30" hour="9">9:30</st1:time> when we left our house to go to his.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were driving up the road, but looking
back, it never occurred to us that we had just had a very scary experience just
a few nights earlier and that it may not be safe to go back just yet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, when we got to our friends house, they
weren't home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, they had
forgotten about our plans and had gone out for the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We turned the car around in their drive way
and started to drive away from the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Suddenly, this extremely bright light appeared just outside of the
drivers side door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't make out a
shape because the light was just too bright to look at it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, this feeling of fear, a fear that I
had never experienced in my life just gripped everyone in the car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have always heard about having the hair
stand up on the back of your neck, but that night it actually happened to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My brother's girlfriend starting screaming
and he started to hyperventilate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
screamed from the back to floor it and he did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We shot out of the driveway but the light kept up with us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All I knew, the only thing that mattered was
getting away from that light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fear
that we all felt that night was enough to keep us away from there for
months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the Grace of God, we made it
off that road without wrecking the car.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>How?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have no idea.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">About 4 months later, it was winter by now, we met our
friend that lived across from the coal mine in town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told us that he was having a christmas
party and that we should come up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since
it had been a few months since the last hair raising experience, we decided
that we would attempt this one more time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, it was the three of us, myself, my brother Ted and his
girlfriend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We made our way up that road
without incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we arrived at our
friends house, the drive way was full of cars and my brother said that there
were too many people and that we should just go home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had no problem with this as I felt uncomfortable
being there to begin with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ted turned
the car around in the gravel drive way, as usual and started to pull out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he made his way onto the road, the light
appeared again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time the light was
so bright that it lit up the entire inside of the car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Keep in mind that this was a dark, December
night on a street with no lights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
light was just above the back window of the car, literally less than a foot
over my head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time, what we felt
wasn't exactly what I would call fear.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What we felt was death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without
thinking, you just knew that you were going to die that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The light that came from this thing was pure
evil.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was not a run of the mill,
scare the neighborhood kids into thinking that the road was haunted type phenomenon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was pure evil emanating from an
orb.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I forced myself to look at it and
it was perfectly round and rotating, literally throwing this evil light
everywhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My brother was so scared
that he completely froze.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His girlfriend
composed herself long enough to push his leg down on the accelerator and force
the car to move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was completely
hypnotized by this orb.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The feeling that
death had come for us and that there was no escape had me completely
mesmorized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Somehow, the thought of my
parents not knowing what h pened to us jumped into my mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My parents had fought all of their lives to
give us everything they could and I would be damned before I would let this
"thing" take us without a fight.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For their sake, I shook myself loose from this things grip, I turned
around and smacked my brother in the head as hard as I could to wake him
up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Drive!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Damn it, Drive!!" I screamed at the top
of my lungs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ted hit the gas and we took
off.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This orb followed us, never losing its position just above
my head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I refused to look back at it,
knowing that it might just take me this time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Just as suddenly as it began, it was over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We drove out of that hollow and back into
town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We pulled over in the same parking
lot that we had pulled over the first time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Once the car was in park, we all just looked at each other and broke
down crying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We sobbed like little
children for almost an hour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
coming back to our senses, I realized that the orb had dissappeared at the
exact same spot that our friend had died earlier in the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>year.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We all bowed our heads and prayed and thanked God for bringing us out of
there without getting killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm not
what I would consider a religious man, but after that, I had all the proof that
I needed that there is indeed a God, and that He does intervene in the fight
between man and evil.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have gone over this many times in my head, and there is no
earthly reason that we should have made it off of that road alive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Going at well over 90 miles an hour on a road
that is difficult under the best of conditions to drive doing 35 shouldn't have
been possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Over the years I have heard of many others who have seen
this strange orb, but also of many others that have not made it out alive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether the orb was the reason they were
killed, I have no way of knowing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
can't get anyone to take me serious enough to look into this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I no longer live in <st1:State><st1:place>Kentucky</st1:place></st1:State>,
but this memory has been burned into my mind and my nightmares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I still know exactly where we were when it
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have not been back on that
road since, and I will not go back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
tempted fate enough back then, so I'm not going to push my luck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you would know of anyone who would want to
investigate this, I am more than willing to give you all the information that I
can.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would even be willing to take you
to the road, but I will not take you all the way down it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Trust me when I say that you will know when
you have reached your destination.....</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Even if you do not believe me, please respond to this so
that I know that you received it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like I
said in the first email, I haven't been able to get this story out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Thank you so much for listening to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just knowing that someone else knows what
happened those nights is like a weight off of my shoulders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My mom and I been living in the same house since 1986. It
all started when my mom decided that the house need a face lift. The first
thing that got done was the carpeting, when we were pulling it out thats when
it started, we would smell men's cologne and the smell of a cigar there were no
men in this house since my parents are divorced. Then little things started to
come up missing mostly silverware and jewlery. They would return but in the
most oddest places. For awhile it was quite then it would start up again, One
morning I was sitting in the kitchen having my morning coffee and enjoying the
quite and thats when I got the willies, I heard what sounded like a man's
breathing, It was like right there in front of me and the breathing sounded
really mad I got so scared I got up and screamed GO AWAY. And on another
occastion It was my daughter's birthday, I had my one friend over to help me
get things ready well we were in the kitchen, we wasnt smoking but there it was
a light mist right by my friend I did a double take to make shure i wasnt
imagining and i saw it with my own eyes, then it left. My mom gets alot of
activity in her room also. When she is laying down reading her book she says
sometimes it feels like someone is sitting down on the end of the bed but noone
is there. About a year ago I had the worst experience of my life. A smell that
the only way i can explain it it smelled like rotten eggs, It only lingered on
the steps that goes upstairs, At first i didnt know what to do so i called the
plumper thinking maybe its the plumping since the stairs is in front of the
bathroom but the plumping was fine. So I called a friend of mine I explained to
her what was going on, she told me I had to cleanse the house, so I did..that
was scary because I really didnt no what i was doing but I had to do it since
im the owner of the house I started upstairs in the bedroom's and went down the
steps and right there in the middle of the stairs I got so sick but i had to
keep going when i made my way to the dining room thats where the puetrid smell
went it lingered there for awhile then i went to the living room and out the
front door. Since i did that we havnet had any smells of any sort just little
things like my daughter's toys going off or coming up missing. Or i'l see
shaddows but i dont feel harmed in anyway. Till this day I have no clue what i
chaced out of this house and I really dont want to know.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">i remember this one instance when me and my friend were
skeptics and we decided to spend a weekend on a ghost tour and part of this was
we had to spend our nights in this haunted manor, well they claimed it was
haunted.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">well after the first night we asked to be moved because we
weren't happy where we were.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">we decided to stay up and walk around for a bit and see if
we could find any ghosts. We didn't find anything so we decided to go back to
our room. when we got back the room was really cold despite the fact it was
summer, and the mildness of the night, we had to close the windows. we were
sitting on the sofa in our room when we heard steps behind us and our backs
went tingly we turned around and no one was there. we decided to call it a
night thinking that the guided were playing a trick and quickly feel asleep. I
woke with a fear of danger and found that i was suffercating and couldn't move,
The next morning at breakfast my friend said she had senced something wa swrong
with me and thought she saw a man dash quickly across my bed, but thought she
was imagining things.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We asked for a new room like i said and we were given one,
the second night there was no doubt we were imaging things.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Emily went to the toilet and closed the door behind her. The
locks on them weren't self locking and you had to lock them with the key. well
i has lost the key earlier in the day, i had left it on the side and it just
wasn't there. There was a banging on the door she demanded to be let in and
said that i lied when i said i couldn't lock the door.i tried to open it and it
was locked. something hit my back at that moment and i spun around to see the
key on the floor. i looked up and saw a man in what i guess was 19th dress and
he ran at me. The next thing i know i'm on the floor with my firend standign
over me. she said there was no one in the room when she came in and she came in
via the door the only way in and out as soon as she heard a loud thump which
she assumes was me hitting the floor. well as you can imagine we left that
night there and then and now take ghosts very seriously.</p>

night shift 7p-7a. i kept feeling a presence in my room. Many times I felt that
it was sitting on my chest and I couldnt breathe. it was not a friendly
presence. I told my husband and he didnt believe me. I got off shift early one
morning arrived home at <st1:time minute="0" hour="5">5 am</st1:time> and my
husband was in the living room awake and very fightened. He claims he saw a
figure of a man enter the bedroom and approach our bed. he claims this figure
put one hand out towards the pillow and my husband starting yeliing in spanish
for GOD to help him. We have nver been bothered by this spirit or entity since,
it seems this presence was looking for me and to this day I believe it was male

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I am 16 years old and I'm really not sure what to think
about this. I live in <st1:State><st1:place>Florida</st1:place></st1:State> and
every so often, something wierd will happen to me. Just like a few years ago I
woke up in the middle of the night for no apparant reason and a bright shining
figure was walking out of my room and down the hallway. But I was way too
scared to go after it. It was a little girl about 5 years old in a white dress,
white shoes and long curly blonde hair.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now the wierd thing is that I've haven't seen the shining
figure since then but I will see cats all over my house, but I don't have any
cats. I will see them running around the house and jumping on to stuff but they
only appear when I'm the only one in the room. Once I was sleeping and I awoke
with a start because I felt something jump onto my stomach and then jump off
again. But everyone else was asleep. And one time I was walking to the bus stop
at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="18">6:30</st1:time> in the morning and I
saw a black cat staring at me with bright shining eyes that was sitting in the
middle of the street. Then all of a sudden a car went by hit the cat but the
cat then disappeared after meowing once. It took all I had to keep from
screaming. The cats on't come to me when I call them. They just walk off and
disappear.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I also see people going through my house. I think it may be
the ghosts of the people who used to live there. I have heard different stories
about how the man died. But the one I have heard the most is that he died in
the back yard. The man has not hurt anybody and he doesn't do anything besides
walk around but it is still scary! </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">That's all for right now I suppose.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">HAPPY ANNIVERSARY SWEETHEART!(and other true stories)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Hi im naz im nearly 12 and i have 4 stories,the first 2 are
my mums:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Well one day a few years ago my grandma went to a
medium(someone at a spiritualist church who contacts spirits)and the medium
said he could sense someone wanted to give a bunch of roses to my grandma.She
couldnt think who it could be until she got home..........my grandad!!he had
died a few years back,and it was their wedding anniversary that day!!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then a few weeks later my mum went to the medium.he said he
could sense a little brown and white spaniel.my mum was disappointed,she never
had a brown and white spaniel and didnt know anyone who did.she later told my
grandma about it and my grandma said that when she was younger she had a dog of
that description called pepper!!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">and my stories are:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i was at home one day,just playing on the computer,which is
in the living room,which is next to the hall.i was home alone.i had my
headphones on also and was listening to music.suddenly i thought i heard
something out in the hall so i took off my headphones and went to have a
look.there was nothing there so obviously i assumed it was my dog
dylan....except he was lying down in the kitchen,and there was NO WAY he could
have got into the hall and back into the kitchen that quick.that,and the door
was closed....:0S....i went to check on him and he seemed fine,if a little on
edge-his fur on his back was bristled up,and he started to growl about
nothing,and as he growled he was looking past me into the hall.i looked
round,there was nothing there.i thought it was my imagination playing up,and
just went back into the living room and sat down on the computer.i definitly
closed the kitchen door fully.i was about to put my headphones back on,when i
heard a swish of a cloak,and the stairs creaked.our stairs NEVER creak unless
someone walks up them.i ran out into the all.NOTHING.and........the kitchen
door was slowly creaking open.i just totally freaked out then,and i am known
for never freaking out about anything!!i grabbed mobile phone and ran out the
house,taing my dog and keys with me.i live directly across from a park,so i
went and sat in the park.i phoned my mum and told her what happened.she
believed me,as she has seen ghosts before,and i dont usually lie about things
like that.i refused to go back into the house until my mum came home an hour
later.when i did go back in,my dog started growling again.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">another true story is:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">it was about midnite.i had stayed up late as usual,it being
a friday.i went to bed way after the rest of my family.my light was out as i
climbed into my bunk bed,the whole house was pitch black coz all the lights
were out.i dont usually mind the dark,in fact i like it,but there was something
i sensed that was freakin me out badly.as i lay in bed,i heard what sounded
like footsteps shuffling on my carpet at the end of my room.i peered over the
edge of my bunk bed-nothing there,but there were what looked like footsteps
appearing in the carpet.the most freaky thing was that they didnt lead into the
room,just started at the end of my room and headed for....my bunk bed.i dived
under the covers.when i dared to peep out again,i was shocked still.i just
couldnt move.a hooked nose and evil golwing red eyes were leering at me over
the side of my bunk bed.thats all i could see,a hooked nose and red eyes.as
soon as i was brave enough to move i dived back under the covers.after
that,about an hour later of cowering under the duvet,i worked up enough courage
to run into my parents bedroom which was across the landing.the footsteps were
still indented in my carpet.i spent the night in my parents room,curled up on
the end of their bed until about 4am,where i went downstairs coz i couldnt
sleep.then i went ck up to my room.....and the footsteps were gone.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">soz it took so long!!thanku 4 readin!!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By: sammie1963@bellsouth.net </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">About 1 1/2 years ago my family and I took a trip to <st1:State><st1:place>Mississippi</st1:place></st1:State>
and <st1:City><st1:place>New Orleans</st1:place></st1:City>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had heard alot about a restaurant called
The Kings Tavern.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is haunted by a
ghost named Madeline.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She supposedly had
an affair with a married may, when his wife found out she killed her and buried
her body inside the fireplace.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
supposedly haunts this restaurant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
upstairs is closed off because that area is where her bedroom is with all of
her original things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They allow people
to go upstairs and look around to see if they notice anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have always enjoyed spooky things but never
completely had something so wild happen till then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My oldest daughter and I went upstairs to
look around, we felt of the bed and found hot spots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked all over the bed for anything that
would make the hot spots but found nothing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The hot spots moved from place to place on the bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is only one way in that room and beside
the door was a type of dresser with an area to hang cloths in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My daughter decided to speak to the ghost,
she turned and looked at the rocking chair and ask Madeline if she was
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were very quiet and standing
on wood flooring.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My daughter ask for a
sign, we then heard 3 knocks inside the room behind us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say we took off running.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We came down the steps and sat down at our
table.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could see the doorway into the
other eating area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I saw the shadow of a
woman come down the hall, but never the woman.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The woman would have had to turn into our room and come in because there
is a wall that forces you to come into our area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the woman's shadow just went right
through the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I immediately looked
down and felt this strange feeling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
did not tell anyone what I saw yet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
ate dinner, and then we decided to go upstairs one more time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My daughter and I were in the room, while we
were standing there we heard footsteps behind us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was enough for me then, we headed
downstairs very quickly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband paid
his bill for business purposes, then he went outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stood at the door and jiggled it for a
moment to give us a hard time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then
walked down the block.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I paid our
bill the door began to shake and jiggle.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My daughter said Mom, Dad is going to get us in trouble.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said yes I know, open the door and tell him
to stop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My daughter opened the door and
looked out, her Dad was down the street with her little sister.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My daughter turned and looked at me with this
look, her face was white as a sheet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
said Mom, they aren't doing it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
walked out and when I got to my husband I ask him if he did that and he said
for a second then I walked down here.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Needless to say I walked away knowing that we, I experienced something
that I can't explain away.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: michaelhigginsba@hotmail.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Hi i was at your site and would like to mention some thing
that happened in the area I grew up in <st1:State><st1:place>Mass.</st1:place></st1:State></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I grew up in a small population town called Townsend, which
is right outside of <st1:City><st1:place>Fitchburg</st1:place></st1:City> (and
near Ashburnham).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We would get together
as kids, teen agers and early college kids to tell of our stories.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even though its only been a handful of years
(im only 25) I can only remember a few stories, or legends from the area.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In fall of 1990 on Edward Rd I was at a babyysitters house
playing out in their front yard (I hated the baby sitter so I would often avoid
going in her house) when I saw a person come from out of nowhere dressed in a
long black coat that I had never seen before (though now I can comapre it to
what the horseman in Tim Burtons Sleepy Hollow wore).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man (I've always assumed it was a man)
walked around the oppositte corner of the house that I was on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thinking it was some one messing with me I
followed the person, only when I turned the corner of the house there was no
one there.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Behing the house after several yards was a small forest that
seperated my neighborhood from the high school's fields (sadly they were mostly
gone do to development by the time I left the town in 99)-however there were
several yards seperating the house and the trees and even if the person had run
I would have seen him on one of the paths.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Needless to say my 10 year old mind was scared, and the moment has
forever stuck with me.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Over the years people from the neighboring towns (Pepprell, <st1:City><st1:place>Groton</st1:place></st1:City>,
Dunstable as well as near by roads in Townsend) would decribe to me seeing a
man with a similar coat romaing around, without me ever mentioning my stoy
until afterwards.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Granted some people would embelish and say that they saw
bright red eyes etc, but most only ever saw the man in daylight, in the fall,
usualy near trees from the back.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I still get a cold sweat whenever I think of this being.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There are of course other experiances people would
experiance in the same areas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People who
were alone in the High School (including my self several</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">times) would hear a girl call out their names while passing
a perpendicular hallway that would be empty.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The Town of <st1:City><st1:place>Ashy</st1:place></st1:City>
has an old revolutionary war grave yard where even in the summer there are
areas that will make you freezae.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">At Westfield State College in <st1:City><st1:place>Westfield</st1:place></st1:City>
the dorm Scanlon Hall had numerour reportings from students while I was there
about hauntings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a few occasions
there as well.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Heavy wooden doors on springs would open up without people
touching them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The Study Room (nick named the morgue) people would hear and
see things (I myself saw floating eyes); a locked room right outside the Study
Room that had a window in the door people would see shapes and shadows moving
around in there.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Courtny hall both a room mate and I had experiances-I had
what felt like fingers past trhough my shoulder blade and chest, and he saw our
VERY HEAVY door open up a few times.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">He also had experiances and the local park-but he was on
shrooms at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I"ve never
done drugs and never drank, so I never could explain these things.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">OK I'm sorry about how long this entry was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>evileine@yahoo.com<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In 1985 three friends and I moved to our first home outside
of the dorms at <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Wittenberg</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>College</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
in <st1:City><st1:place>Springfield</st1:place></st1:City>. OH. We had found a
great duplex on <st1:Street><st1:address>Cassilly Street</st1:address></st1:Street>;
It was close to school, roomy, comfortable, and best of all, cheap.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The house was older. Downstairs there were three rooms, a
door to the basement, and stairways in the front and back of the house leading
to three bedrooms and a bath upstairs. Immediately we noticed that the place
was eerie, especially the basement and the back stairway. We kept the basement
door locked.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The problems began immediately. Many mornings we woke to
find the (previously locked) basement door open. The back stairwell was
terrifying; some of us took to walking down the stairs sideways because we felt
that somebody was going to push us down. There was a frequent (very) cold spot
at the top of this stairwell although there were no windows nearby, and the
darkness at the top of the stairs felt downright malicious.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Whatever resided there seemed to strongly dislike the one
black woman in our household. Lightshades from ceiling fixtures fell on her
head several times. After each time this happened we tightened the rest of the
fixtures, only to have it happen again a few weeks later. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Over time we stopped spending any time alone in the house
because of the constant feeling of being watched or followed. Friends stopped
coming over; one refused to even come onto the front porch because the house
frightened him so much.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I slept in the front room upstairs. It was the brightest
room in the house, but wasn't free of the fear that the rest of the house
seemed to generate. I began to suffer from night terrors; was it the stress of
school, I wondered, or the energy of the place? As I fell asleep, I saw either
spiders or a severed hand scuttling across my bed towards me, frightening me so
badly I'd jump out of bed screaming. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I couldn't bear the night terrors. After some research I
decided to bless my room using salt and holy water. I told the spirits that the
house was theirs, but the room was mine. I kept a line of salt across my
threshold at all times. Perhaps it was a placebo, but the night terrors never
happened after the blessing. But from time to time at night I'd glance up from
my studies...<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">He stood right at my door looking into my room. I could see
a hat, a jawline, shoulders and chest. To me it didn't feel particularly
sentient, and I often could gather the fortitude to close the door in his
(missing) face.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We lived in this house for two very frightening years. I've experienced
some ghostly places since, but have never since had night terrors. I don't know
whether the house is still standing or what experiences other tenants have had.
But if you happened to live in a very disturbed duplex on <st1:Street><st1:address>Cassilly
  Street</st1:address></st1:Street> in <st1:City><st1:place>Springfield</st1:place></st1:City>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My family and I visited the park the first week of August
this year as I am a Civil War buff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
took a lot of pictures with our digital camera in various parts of the park as
mementos of our trip. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When we were in a place known as The Hornets Nest, I
wandered ahead along the sunken road while my wife and kids lagged behind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I stood looking across the field toward
what woul dhave been the Confederate artillery position I heard the faint but
distinct sound of music coming from the woods behind me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it sounded like old time music played on a
harmonica or something similar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
lasted for maybe 30 seconds to a minute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I checked around and found nothing there...there was nobody else in the
park except the six of us and park rangers who I assume were back at the ranger
station over a half mile away.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In the car as we were driving to another area of the park, I
mentioned that I had a wierd sensation and my wife asked me if I had heard the
music.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now she was not in the same area
as i was, so I was startled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>turns out
both she and my 15 year old daughter had heard the same music in the same area
at a different time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My younger sons
(11, 8 and 5)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>who were with her did not
hear anything.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We drove to the opposite side of the field and walked down
the artillery positions looking back at where we had heard the strange music
(along the sunken road and woods that had been the position of the Union
troops).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I took pictures with the
digital camera just so i could remember the place as it was pretty cool.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As we were driving back toward the caretaker house, my
daughter asked me who the man was in the picture I had taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stopped the car and looked at the image of
the picture I had taken and sure enough in the area where we had heard the
music, there was a definitive outline of a figure along the tree line.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it appeared as if he had either a rifle or
some type of guidon in his hand and he was wearing a low brimmed hat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was just the outline of a man and I know
there was no one ther when I took the picture.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As I said it was a hot August day and no one else was in the park.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it was not scary, just very disconcerting.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When we were neasr the "bloody pond" I mentioned
to my wife that though I didn't know if there was such a thing as ghosts it
wouldn't surprise me if they were in a place like <st1:place>Shiloh</st1:place>
where there was such a loss of life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
that moment a HUGE owl flapped out of the woods and across the lane about
gicvng me a heart attack.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I asked one of the rangers when we got back to the visitors
center about the music and if he knew of any starnge goings on and he laughed
it off not making a comment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said
there was no music piped into the park and maybe i heard something from far
away that was carrying over the wind.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">pretty strange experience, but it definitely added to our
trip.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Experiences<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;By: Anonymous<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Hi. I live in in <st1:City><st1:place>burlington</st1:place></st1:City>,
massachusettes.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My house was orginally built by my grandparents, you know
where there used to be dirt roads and farms all over the place way back in the
day. It's been here for at least over 40+ plus years and on some occasions when
I am home alone I feel a presense particulary in my mother's bedroom. this only
happens sometimes. One night my mother was reading and no one else was in the
room and she heard a voice whisper "linda" (my mothers name). she
came into my bedroom and thought it was me but I was on the computer. I don't
know of anyone passing away in this house to my knowlege but sometimes I feel
watched in my own home. it's very wierd.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;I have a weird shed in my backyard that hasn't been
used in years. It's located in the woods over a stone wall and whenever I just
walk in there even during the day I feel a presense that wants me to go away
from there. This happens when I step over the stone wall and into the woods I
automatically feel like "I shouldn't be here" or to "go
away". One night in the fall, I stood right near that stone wall listening,
and I swear I could hear someone walking in the leaves very slowly. and
sometimes I feel a very chilling cold wind sometimes when I'm walking in that
woods. I'm not the one to believe in ghosts but I have felt presenses like that
before.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have also driven slowly past Sawmill road as it said on
your website and even without believing in ghosts i felt a strong presense by
just driving by like i shouldn't be here. It's a wierd dirt road and the street
sign is scratched out. it's very strange. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;I have also experienced seeing the orb phonomenon and
it only happens in some places outside or inside my house when i take a
picture. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;At my friends house up the street deep in her back
yard there is a well and if you go past the well there is a little clearling over
a big stone wall with rocks and lawn chairs and a single picture hanging on a
tree. it freaks me out everytime I'm down there and I always feel watched. I
wonder if it's someone home or what. we investigated it at night but I was too
scared to go check it out.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My friends and I decided to rent this old run down trailer
house when we were in our early twenties. There were three bedrooms and a
basement in this place. My bedroom faced the hallway with a veiw of the
basement, my bestfriends room was right next door to mine, and our other
roommates room kittycorner to mine, my third roommate ( my best friends brother
) had the basement.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Late one night I was laying on my bed watching TV. My
bedroom door was open so I could hear the phone. I heard the front door to the
house open and close so I naturally looked out into the hallway. I saw my
basement dwelling roommate opening the basement door and I said " Hello
". He just went downsatirs and closed the door behind him like he didn't
even hear me. It wasn't like him to not answer me so I went to the basement
door, opened it and shouted goodnight. There were no lights on in the basement
so I closed the door thinking he was having a bad night and did not want to talk.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The next morning as I was strating the morning ritual of
coffee making, my bestfriend came into the kitchen and I told her that her
brother was having a bad night last night. She looked at me real confused. She
said that her brother had been up north for the last two days and was not
planning on coming back for another two days. I insisted that I had seen him
come in and go downsairs and that maybe he had gotten a ride back early with a
friend. Both wanting to prove our cases we went to the basement door and went
down the stairs. Sure enough his bed was made and everything was in order. We
went upstairs to call the friend that he was staying with up north and he was
in fact there. We were both very shaken at this point and for the next week we
made our boyfriends tay with us. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After a while we were settled down and things were back to
normal. It seemed that we had forgotten our ghostly roommate. I was having one
of many fights with my boyfriend and he had just up and took off for several
days. Late one morning I woke up and saw a man in the corner of my room. Being
that I was really tired and he looked a lot like my boyfriend I started talking
to him about how sorry I was for the fight that we had. I fell back asleep
after saying my peice never realizing that the man in the corner had never even
spoken a word. The next morning my bestfriend knocked on my door and came in to
ask if I was okay. She had heard me talking early in the morning and was
curious. I told her that I was appologizing to my boyfriend for the fight. She
said that she couldn't see how I was talking to him because she had the phone
in her room the night before and had forgotten to put it back on the charger. I
explained that he had come over. You all know what came next...... She told me
that that was impossible because she was in the kitchen ( that gives a full
veiw of the driveway ) just after she heard me talking and she did not see his
car out there. I started to freak out. I started to think that there was
something seriously wrong with that house. I have had many spooky things happen
to me since I was a child, but this was getting on my last nerve. We all moved
out in the following 8 months except my bestfriend who stayed for another year
and a half after which she had bought another house. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After she had settled into the new place she had called me
over to hang out. I went over and we were having coffee and she told me why she
decided to buy a new house and move. She was at home alone and doing some
laundry and cleaning when she heard the front door open and close. It was just
her and her boyfriend living there. She heard footsteps going into the living
room so she went out there thinking hat her boyfriend had come home early from
work. When she got to the living room she saw a man standing there. She said
that she would never forget what the man looked like for the rest of her life.
He was tall, thin, with dark hair, and light colored clothing ( both my
boyfriend and her brother look similar in appearance ). She said that she would
have been more concerned than terrified had it not been for the fact that she
could see right through him. She said she turned and ran from the house
grabbing the phone on the way out. She said that it took and hour before she
could go back into the house and decided it was time for a move. She said that
it would appear that we were both visited my the same ghost. I still get chills
to this day whenever either one of us tells this story. I ran accross this
sight and thought that I should share our story.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Guess Who Came to Visit?<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: <b><i><span style="color: purple;" lang="PT-BR">Gcallighan@perqhci.com<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She was asleep on the couch facing the east window of her
apartment. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Little did she
know what would transpire next. Was it a dream or did it <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>really happen.
Some time earlier in the day she made a purchase. Loving <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>black wrought
iron, it was irresistible. It appeared to be a small bowl <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>with
interweaving vines connected by smaller black balls with an opening <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>on the top and
sides. She just had to have it, to put on her small kitchen <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>table. What a
find! When she came home it was placed dead center on the <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>small table in
her dining room and then forgotten about. Nothing else lay <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>on the table.
About <st1:time minute="0" hour="23">11 pm</st1:time>, she lay on her living
room couch and fell <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>asleep only to
be awakened by an extremely large, bright and intense light <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>shining directly
into her living room. She tried to stand up but something <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>was keeping her
down. She managed to roll over to her left side and <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>glanced in the
direction of her "new" purchase. Still feeling a force that <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>was keeping her
down, she was amazed at what was taking place. From the <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ceiling above
the "bowl" came a beautiful stream of spiraling colored <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>lights. They
were not connected at the ceiling, but hung about 2 inches <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>below in
mid-air. They traveled downward toward the bowl. She was <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>awestruck with
the beauty and intensity of the lights. She couldn&#8217;t move <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>nor speak. Soon
after witnessing this sight, she fell back to sleep. The <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>next morning she
arose, thinking nothing of the night before. She got her <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>morning paper,
went to the kitchen for her coffee and then took a seat at <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the dining room
table not far from the smaller table with her bowl on it. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>She continued to read her paper when after
about 10 minutes she &#8220;felt&#8221; <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that she was
supposed to look at her "bowl". As she did, chills were <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>immediately
present and so were the memories of the night before. There on <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the small table
sat her "bowl"--completely sliced in half! Imagine a <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>wrought iron
bowl sliced in half? and by what? A stream of bright colorful <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>lights? She was
stunned and felt very sad. She no longer had her prize <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>possession. It
went to the trash. That was 1983 occurring in Hightstown, <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>NJ. Never again
has she experienced another episode or ever found this <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"strange
bowl" again. To this day she keeps looking for another one. If <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>she finds it,
she will buy it and hope that she is visited again by.... <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since that
incident she has tried many times to &#8220;tell&#8221; her family and <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>friends about
it. She was not allowed to. Something or someone stopped her <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>from speaking
about it in a way that she cannot describe through writing. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It took some years and a move to <st1:place><st1:City>Hamilton</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>NJ</st1:State></st1:place> when she found the support <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>group for UFOs.
She decided she would try to tell them. Again she was <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>stopped from
talking about it. She couldn&#8217;t do it the first time, the <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>second or the
third. It took many more months after that. Finally, she <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>went back again
making this her fourth visit, when she &#8220;just knew&#8221; she was <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>able to talk
about it. Many people found it fascinating and asked quite a <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>few questions
about the &#8220;bowl&#8221;. She never got an answer from the group and <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>to this day
still remembers it as vividly as if it had happened the night <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>before. This is
actually a true story&#8212;and it happened to me.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It's been 25 years since I left my home in <st1:place><st1:City>Gary</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>Indiana</st1:State></st1:place>, but not more than a week goes by
that I'm not telling someone about how great it was growing up there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:City><st1:place>Gary</st1:place></st1:City>
has always been a tough town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
Historian and Professor of Criminology, I've spent decades looking for the
causes of some of the most violent episodes in American history.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But no practical explanation could have
prepared me for the summer of 1974.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It was the summer of 1974 when my family and I moved from
the North West side of Gary, an area known as Brunswick, to the, then, all
white section of South Gary referred to as Glen Park.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The move from the "inner city" to
Glen Park was the best thing that ever happened to me and my family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The neighborhood was beautiful, people walked
the streets at all hours of the day and night, and the old house we moved into
belonged to an era when trolleys rolled down Broadway, and Mr. Wirt and his
"Platoon School" system were the talk everywhere in the United States
and in Europe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Everything was wonderful, except for one small problem.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house we moved into that summer, the
house that my family still calls home, was in every sense of the word,
hunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It didn't take long before we all realized something was not
right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For example, in the first month
we were in the house, I was awakened by my parents and asked to join them in
darkened kitchen pantry that over looked the garden.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As odd as this request was at the time, odder
was the fact that it was <st1:time minute="0" hour="4">4 am</st1:time>, and in
the garden was what appeared to be an elderly white woman in a sheer white
gown, watering the garden.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now if you're
familiar with the area of town I grew up in, <st1:City><st1:place>Brunswick</st1:place></st1:City>,
you'd know that <st1:City><st1:place>Brunswick</st1:place></st1:City> is
adjacent the old (no longer there) neighborhood of <st1:City><st1:place>Cudahy</st1:place></st1:City>.
<st1:City><st1:place>Cudahy</st1:place></st1:City> is where the "White
Lady" or "La Lorona" is said to haunt Cline and <st1:Street><st1:address>5th
  Avenue</st1:address></st1:Street>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is significant, because the lady we were looking at, matched the
description of La Lorona, to include the way she just vanished before our
eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unlike the Lutz, of Amityville
Horror fame, we didn't leave behind all of our belongings and go running into
the night never to return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When you
don't have much money, you learn to tolerate vanishing white old ladies who
water your garden at odd hours of the morning.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The second incident occurred about a week later when both of
my sisters described the same identical dream of an old white man who would
open up their bedroom doors, turn on the light and look in on them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Power of suggestion?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't think so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They each told the same story hours apart and
not in each other's presence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They each
had the same description of the man, down to his clothing and the cane he held
in his left hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Very soon after that,
my sisters decided to share the same bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And yes, the dreams continued. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The third incident occurred months later when on a beautiful
snowy December night, I peered out of the front window and watched the fresh
snow fall against the corner street light.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A brand new blanket of snow covered the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The windows had frost on them, but the house
was warm and safe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I bent forward,
resting my elbow on the window sill, I was careful not to press against the
radiator and burn myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And then
without warning, something grabbed both of my legs and lifted me slowly
sideways until I had no choice but to move my arms in an attempt to fight off
my attacker.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With my hands no longer
supporting my body and my feet no longer on the ground, you'd think I'd land
face first onto the radiator wouldn't you?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But that's not what happened.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What happened was that whatever it was gently put me down, and I think I
went to my happy place.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I am naturally leaving out the reactions of my family at
each of these incidents, and before you ask if we ever called on a priest to
bless the house, let me remind you, that we are a Mexican family, and prayer,
the Roman Catholic Church, and holy water were the first things we employed
after the watering white lady incident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And yes, we bought a shotgun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">However, the incidents continued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My brother was awakened one morning by the
old man who turned on the light above his bed (the light was a light bulb
turned on and off with a string) in his basement bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That incident resulted in the police being summoned
and a room full of teenaged Mexican all sleeping in one bedroom of a four
bedroom house because everyone was too afraid to sleep on their own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The last incident I'll share happened in 1976, when I was
talking to my <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Merriville</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>High
  School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> girlfriend on the basement phone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Love can do strange things, and in my case,
it made me forget that I was in the basement all by myself on the phone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conversation was going smoothly enough,
when I noticed that a small foam filled bench next to the bed I was laying on,
moved. In fact, it did more than just move, it moved a lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It moved forward and backward, and it even
levitated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once again I went to my happy
place, and somehow, I was up two flights of stairs, through the kitchen,
dinning room and into the living room where my father sat watching TV.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Literally speechless and half out of my mind,
I resembled Lassie in one of those episodes where she had to get someone to
follow her because little Timmy was about to be killed by a train or something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was finally able to get my father to follow
me downstairs, where he found nothing wrong save for the hardly audible voice
coming from the hanging receiver, asking, "Are you alright, are you still
there?"<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Many other things happened in that house and still do
today.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We all know who the ghost is and
why he is there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was his house long
before it was ours, and we've made no attempts to make him leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Thank you very
much for your fantastic site. I have been interested in ghosts and hauntings
ever since I had my own experiences as a child. I also live in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="">Rhode Island</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="">, and throughout </span><st1:place><span style="">New England</span></st1:place><span style=""> the old colonial folklore goes deep through
the culture. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I lived in my
first house until I was about ten years old. I always remembered that at night
I would awaken to the sounds of footsteps in the room above me walking back and
forth across the room. This would go on for several minutes and then stop. I
would also see things out of the corner of my eye, shadows and flickering
images. One particular experience I had with that occured one morning as I was
getting dressed for school. There was a fish tank on my dresser and as I went
to open it I noticed in my reflection on the glass that there was a shadow
right behind me. I turned around instantly to find nothing there. I also
refused to go upstairs in the house without my mother or father with me. I
never liked going up there, and even when I was up there with one of my parents
I always had the feeling that there was something right behind me. I was also
too young to remember exactly what, but when I was much younger something
happened to me in the upstairs that utterly terrified me. My parents always
dismissed my fears and told me that it was merely my imagination. For example,
I can remember my father telling me that the footsteps I used to hear at night
were merely branches scratching the roof. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">When I was eight
years old my parents divorced and I went to live with my father in a different
part of the state. My mother also moved out of that house and relocated to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="">New Jersey</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="">. I never really gave much thought to what I
remember about that house until I was in high school. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">During my
sophomore year, I had free time in gym class one day and was talking to my gym
teacher. He asked me where I was from, and I told him that I lived in
Narragansett but used to live in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="">Warwick</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style=""> not far from the school on a street named </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="">Sunny Cove Drive</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="">. When I said this his face lit up and he
told me he had an old girlfriend when he was in high school who lived on the
same street. He then told me about his old girlfriend and how he ended the
relationship with her because she was somewhat unstable as the result of a
dysfunctional family life. He said that her situation had been especially
difficult ever since her brother killed himself in his upstairs bedroom. As
soon as I heard this ir senr chills right through me as I remembered that
house. I asked him if he remembered the exact address, but he couldn't. I know
that I can never be completely sure, but I am convinced that I used to live in
that exact house where that event occured.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">A few yrs ago we
bought a 1960 model two story home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
you come in thru the carport you walk into one big room that is the kitchen,
dining room and living room all in one. There is a small walk thru that leads
to the bath room and one bedroom ( we made this<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the kids room ). Across from the bedroom is a door, that is where the
stairs are leading downstairs. Our bedroom is down a short hall left of the
bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Down stairs there are two
bedrooms, a bathroom and a closet, and lots of storage space and laundry area.
We made the bedroom at the foot of the stairs the toy room and the back bedroom
the computer room. Not long after moving in I was one the computer when I heard
the front door open and someone walk thru the house. I assumed my husband was
home and went up to greet him. There was no one there but me. After a few times
of that I moved the Computer up to the living room. We would hear noises at
night that sounded like the kids walking around and getting into stuff. My
husband got up several times and the boys were in bed asleep. One fall night my
husband was doing something by his truck and saw the reflection of someone in
white walk behind his truck. When he turned to look there was no one there. I
was on the computer that same n ht when I saw from the corner of my eye, the
same person walk thru the kitchen. About 15 minutes later I heard a loud pop
and one of my cabinet doors was open. We had put new latches on the doors a few
weeks earlier, they were/are very hard to open. there is no way they opened on
their own. A few nights later it got very hot in the house. I got up and
checked the thermostat and it was sitting on 80. It is on the wall by my
bedroom and no one had been thru there since earlier in the day. That has
happened 3 or four times. guess someone thought we were cold. My kids went to
see their grandparents the summer before last and whatever is in our home went
nuts. The first night they were gone it sounded like a war in my living room.
Things would disappear and no matter where you looked you wouldn't find them. I
got mad one day and yelled damnit give it back, after that stuff stopped
disappearing. I was in the shower on day getting ready for work, while shaving
my legs I heard the front door open and someone walked thru the house. I got
out to see if my husband was home. The front door was locked and again I was
alone. I went to work that day with one leg shaved. When the kids came back the
noises didn't quit but they weren't as bad as when they were gone. Last winter
we did some remodeling and tore out the wall around the stairs and put up a
banister. We also tore out our closet and converted the small bathroom in our
room to a walk in closet. The noises stopped. I thought whatever it was, was
gone, but about a two months ago they started back. We have never seen anyone
other than the lady in white and we only saw her that one time. I don't feel
threatened but I do feel uneasy and watched sometimes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">My family lived in
our Santa Ana Condo for 8 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
were the original owners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I lived their
from the time I was 1 - 9 years old. I am now 27.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we moved out of the condo and into our
new house my parents had never spoke of the experiences to each other prior to
that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My dad did not want to scare my
mom, so once we moved he started to tell her of the ghost that lived with us in
our hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom said she already new
and they both described her as around a 16 year old Indian girl.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom said she would watch her vacume and
cook dinner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said she was never
scared of her (and my mom is a scardy cat) she said she felt at peace with
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a little girl living their I
would always tell my parents that I saw someone in our house, but I was never
scared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had bad things happening all
around our house and neighborhood, but never to us. I feel she was always
watching over us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We still talk about
her till this day as our gardian angel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I was 6 years old
when my family moved to the home that I still reside in. My sister was 16. She
began to complain that a shadowy man would walk around her bed in the basement,
then lean over her only a few inches from her face, and whisper to her. She
could not understand what it was saying, thinking it was talking in Norweigen
(?), and it would disappear if she reached out for it. Sometimes my brother and
I would dare each other to sleep in the basement. The night light would switch
off by itself in the middle of the night, and one time the overhead light
switched off on me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">When I was 6 or 7
I awoke to a little girl standing beside me (I was sleeping on the floor) and
she was looking at my brother on the bed and began reaching out to touch him. I
sat up gasping. She looked at me, backed away, and disappeared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Soon my sister
moved to college and my brother, in junior high, moved into her old room in the
basement. He reported a shadow that would drag its feet around the bed. He also
had an experience in which the shadowy figure leaned over him and pressed on
his back. He felt something go through him and had bruises the next day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Throughout the
years ghostly things would happen now and then, seemingly in a pattern. It
would go away for months and even years, then out of the blue, start right back
up again. One day I cleaned off the counter, and wiped it off, turned away, and
a coffee mug was on the center of the counter when I turned back only seconds later.
The same thing happened with a missing hammer. Another time my friends and I
watched in amazement as a plastic grocery bag slowly scrunched itself up into a
little ball, then was released again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">After college I
moved back home again. One morning I went into the basement. My sister's old
room was now a work-out room with a ski machine, etc. I opened up the door and
saw an old man kneeling on the floor with his head in his hands. He was so sad
and was crying. He quickly disappeared and I brushed off the image as my
imagination. I went and turned on the TV loudly, trying to calm myself and
concentrate on working out. That is when I heard a strange dripping sound
coming from the ceiling and wall. I knew that there were no pipe on that side
of the house so I moved closer, trying to figure it out. Then the sound changed
to dripping, chirping, and a loud electrical crackling and buzzing. It was very
loud and I had never heard such a strange noise. The sound moved down to me in
an orb of energy and brushed passed my ear and went to the other side of the
room. I was so stunned that I couldn't move. It started coming towards me again
and I turned around and ran upstairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">That seemed to
open up a doorway. My lamp would glow at night when it wasn't turned on and I could
not get it to shut off until I yelled, "Knock it off!". I told the
spirit that turning on my lamp didn't scare me anymore, so it started blaring
my stereo when I least expected it. I would come home to an empty house at
night after work and the lights would flicker on and off until my brother or
mother came home. The lights even began to turn off on my mom when I wasn't
around. My brother heard the strange buzzing sound coming from another room and
saw a little girl standing at his bed in the middle of the night. I decided to
bless the house with prayers and holy water. I was too scared to stick around
that night and slept at a friend's house. That evening my brother awoke to
stomping up and down the stairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">The ghost(s)
wouldn't leave me alone and I had the feeling that they (or at least one)
didn't like me at all. I was stressed out, couldn't sleep, and was scared to go
downstairs to do my laundry. I moved out and it seemed to stop. When I would
come home to visit the TV would turn off by itself when I was watching it.
Years later I moved home again. Since then, occassionally things will fall of
the counter and a light switched off on me, but it has been reletively quiet.
Let's hope it stays that way!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">My friend and me
where staying at a haunted hotel in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="">Jefferson</span></st1:City><span style=""> </span><st1:State><span style="">Tx</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="">. We were in are room and we decided to go down stairs and talk to the
manager. So we shut and locked the door. We went down stairs for about five
minutes. When went upstairs, our door was wide open. We ran down stairs and
asked if anybody was up there and she said no, all the people staying on our
floor had gone out to eat and the maid was still downstairs. We had locked the
door because of our valuables. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">When I was five or
six, about a year after we first moved into the house I reside in now, I
started seeing a shadow all the time. It was all black with red eyes. At first,
I woke in the middle of the night to see him peering at me from around my
bedroom door. When I first went to sleep, that door had been closed. I was
frightened, and cried myself to sleep. I vaguely remember the door shuting as I
fell back to sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Two years later, I
had a halloween birthday party at my house. We were watching Scream, but one of
my friends, Claire, was looking through the window. "Umm...Kailan, there's
someone on your lawn." she said suddenly. We paused the movie and all
looked out the window. Indeed, there was a black figure with red eyes running
across my lawn. We joked that it was someone down the street, but we all knew
better. After that, I didn't see him until a few years later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">This time, it was
this year, 2005. I was having a party on the last day of school, which had
become an annual thing between my friends and accqaintences. At night, around </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="8"><span style="">8:00</span></st1:time><span style="">, we had a bonfire. While we burned our
homework, I saw someone by the house, looking at us. They were a pitch black
figure. With red eyes. I was startled, at first, but then thought I was seeing
things as usual. That night, five of my friends slept over. We were in a tent
outside when one of my friends got mad and left the tent. After ten minutes, we
called for her but she never came. After she made some strange noises and
scared us all crap-less, another friend went out and caught her. We fell
asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">The next morning,
we were talking about her expidition outside the tent and she demonstrated the
weird noises. I asked her why she kept trying to hide when we looked for her.
She said she was walking towards one of us in the dark when we disappeared. In
the area she described, no one had been there. The friend that had gone out to
get her described a shadow walking into a wall in the garden beside the tent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Since then I've
officially named this occasional visitor Jack. If anyone has any similar
experiances with a black figure, please E-mail me!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Grade Seven, May
2005. What a wonderful year. I breezed through school, so happy. Our end of the
year trip was to </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="">Mansfield</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="">
 </span><st1:PlaceName><span style="">Outdoor</span></st1:PlaceName><span style=""> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="">Center</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span style="">. The Center was a large forest, with many
cool activities and such. We were going to stay there three days, staying two
nights. The first day, though, I could tell something was up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">At first,
everything was really great! The food, the activities, the dorms. But,
everything great has a price. The first day, me and my friend went to our room
to get some lip chap and our cameras. When we were running in, My friend saw a
white figure slip into one of our other friend's room. We thought nothing of
it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">That night,
everyone heard someone running up and down the hallways of the dormrooms. Also,
we could hear someone scratching the walls of a room that was empty. It was the
talk of every table at breakfast. That day, that second damned day, They
followed me. I got lost in the woods while walking through with my friends. I
tried to run in the direction I had seen them last, but something disturbed me.
Someone was following me, or two people even. I whirled around, but no one was
there. I stopped, and a twig snapped behind me. When I looked, again, no one
there. I finally got out after they chased me, scared to death, right out of
there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">That night, we had
to present plays to the group. I took a few pictures with a digital camera, and
when I looked at them, Orbs were floating above the group that was presenting!
I was terrified, and I looked above them. There was a faint smoke in the
rafters. In the picture there must have been hundreds of orbs!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">The next morning,
on the last day, the pictures were gone. All of them, from the camera. I had
not erased them. That day, I was again chased by my two favorite ghostly pals
out of the woods when I was somewhat separated from my friends. I had an idea.
I haven't told anyone this yet, but I asked out loud what their names were.
Only one came to my mind. Zackery. I told him not to chase me anymore, and when
I took a few steps, I heard nothing behind me. I thanked him, then ran out of
there. Quickly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">We left a few hours
later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">At the age of one,
when I first learned to talk, I began to rave about my past life. Apparently I
said I lived in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Japan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">, and died in a fire. But this fire was started by a murderer. What I
don't understand, is I had a memory. Recently, I was sitting at the kitched
table with my eyes closed. The house was quiet. Then, I suddenly remember
running up a coblestone road, towards a river. It went up a slight slope, but when
I started going down there was a man underneath a pink painted sign, watching
me. He had black boots, black pants, a black cow-boy hat, and a grey turtle
neck with a black trench-coat. When I saw him, I started running faster. For
some odd reason, I was barefoot. When I reached the river, the memory ended
suddenly as my mother entered the kitchen. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">My friend saw the
same guy in her dream. She was in either </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Ireland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> or </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Scotland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">, and she was a...hooker. There were rumors
going around that a man similar to the guy in my "memory" going about
and murdering all the hookers. One night, in her dream, she was being chased by
him through the streets in a horse-drawn carriage. Finally, he cornered her and
decapitated her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I wonder if anyone
has seen this man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Having enjoyed
reading the many stories over the year I have decided to send in my own.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">but first I will
say that me and my parents are of sound mind and have no background of
craziness I am a married mum of two and live in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">England</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Well here I begin
when my dad was in his late teens he lived in Wales {England} he lived in the
middle of no where not even buses drove near his home so he walked miles to and
from work in pitch black up long winding country roads right up in the
mountains, now sometimes his mates would think it funny to hide and wait for
him in bushes to try to scare my dad {Nice mates}.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Well one night at
about 10 pm just as my dad was nearing home he heard his mate say "Don't
worry I'm ok now" now my dad looked around everywhere trying to find his
friend but couldn't so in the end he gave up and went home as soon as he got
home he told his mum what his friend had said but couldn't find him anywhere
and it had got my dad rather annoyed. his mum said not to worry about it just
go to bed and work in the morning and tell his friend that he wasn't happy with
these tricks on the weekend.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">So the next
morning my dad went to work as normal and came home that evening but when he
got home his mum told my dad to sit down first and not have a wash first which
is what he usually did when he got in but my dad did as he was told and his mum
said your friend you said you heard last night he died at 10pm last night after
a motor cycle accident My dad had heard his best friend talk from the grave.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">also I have a few
more sorry about grammar we when i was about 8yrs my parents moved to a new
house but from the day we moved in things weren't right the lights would turn
them selves on and off you would hear the back door open and close even through
it was locked you would hear someone turn the sink tap on hear water running
into the sink but when you went into the kitchen to investigate the sink was
dry and you would hear someone walk around my parents bed when no one was
upstairs now even though these things were creepy we<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>lived with them for years until one night in
the winter time my mum went up stairs to turn the electric blanket on in her
bedroom because it was cold but she used to go up stairs without turning the
lights on {I say she used to not any more} as she turned to go in to her
bedroom she saw a transparent form hovering over my dad's stereo my mum turned
and ran a few months later my dad was watching a late night western on tv in
the dark when he suddenly came up to bed and asked my mum to go down stairs and
turn the tv off she was quite surprised as my dad is an owl like me and can
stay up till really late but this was only about 11pm so she went down turned
the tv off and then asked him about it the next morning my dad said he was
happily watching </span><st1:PersonName><span style="">John</span></st1:PersonName><span style=""> Wayne when from behind the tv formed a
Victorian lady who was dressed in Victorian clothing and tight lace collar up
her neck walked from the tv up to my dad in his armchair and gave him a look
which my dad said looked like she was saying "It's time you were in bed "she
then disappeared. After this my parents<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">got the local
vicar in to bless the house and sprinkle holy water in the window and door
frames he said that my mum was visited by her great grandmother that there was
also a gentleman standing on the corner of the stairs and the lady my dad saw
my parents recently<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">recently moved
from the house after living there for 17yrs and right up until the day they
moved they still heard noises very spooky. I have some more but I will tell
them another time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was reading what you had to say about
children and ghost. I strongly believe that children can see them better than
adults. I also agree that children don't yet understand fully about reality so
everything they see or hear its real. I also feel that ghost of children make
themselves more apparent to children because the ghost see another child as a
playmate and the ghost itself my still believe it is alive. In the case of my
three year old step son , we were at my mother's house and I had just gotten
out of the shower and wrapped a towel around me cause I heard him talking, well
his father was in the living room on the computer and my son was in my old
room(where many times i have seen her or felt her there) and he was just talking
away and playing. I asked him who he was talking to and he said the little
girl. I said what little girl and he said the one standing beside me, i am
telling her about sponge bob cause she has never seen him. At that moment i got
chills all over and the room was cold. I just turned around and walked out. I
told him ok just be ca ful you can still play with her it is alright.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So i went back to the bathroom and he came in
there and told me i made her cry. I asked him how, he said i scared her(lol)
and she went away. I asked him where she was and he pointed to my mother and
father's room(by this time my husband was with me) and we walked in there and
the room was cold, and i asked him where she was and she said looking out the
window. I strongly believe in the supernatural being as I have seen her and had
to deal with her little pranks she likes to play on me, I walked over to the
window with my son and he pointed where she was at and I told her that i was
sorry for scaring her like that and she was more than welcome to play with
dylan and stay as long as she wants too. So now everytime we go to my mother's
house and we hear him talking to someone we know he is talking to her. He tells
me sometimes that he doesn't want to go in the room by himself cause she makes
him mad cause she doesn't want to play fair.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
