<b>Sleep Paralysis</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sandivogel@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello.&nbsp; I have been reading stories from this site for</b>
<br><b>days and I have decided to contribute one of my own.</b>
<br><b>I was a junior in college and living by myself in a</b>
<br><b>tiny two room apartment located above a storefront on</b>
<br><b>Philadelphia Street in Indiana, Pennsylvania.&nbsp; I was</b>
<br><b>feeling particularly exhausted after classes and</b>
<br><b>decided to take a quick nap on my couch.&nbsp; It was late</b>
<br><b>afternoon and the apartment had a dusky quality to it</b>
<br><b>because of the light outside.&nbsp; The kitchen and</b>
<br><b>livingroom are one in the same, kitchen on one wall,</b>
<br><b>living room on the other.&nbsp; The door to the apartment</b>
<br><b>was directly across the room from the couch.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>remember "waking up" on my back and unable to move</b>
<br><b>like I was frozen.&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked over to the door and</b>
<br><b>heard footsteps coming up the stairs from the street</b>
<br><b>below (not unusual because a lot of students lived in</b>
<br><b>the building).&nbsp; Except, that these were exceptionally</b>
<br><b>LOUD footsteps.&nbsp; I sensed...dread.&nbsp; I did not see the</b>
<br><b>door open, just realized that it was.&nbsp; I felt</b>
<br><b>something enter the room.&nbsp; I was extrememly scared</b>
<br><b>because I could see my apartment but I could not move</b>
<br><b>(I did not try to speak because I knew I was alone).</b>
<br><b>I felt myself pinching my leg to see if I was dreaming</b>
<br><b>- but it was only a dull pressure, no pain.&nbsp; So I</b>
<br><b>assumed that I was dreaming - but it was so real. I</b>
<br><b>did not see "it" come in though.</b>
<br><b>I had a dry-erase message board tacked to the wall</b>
<br><b>above my phone stand right next to my bedroom door.</b>
<br><b>The board was full of messages that I hadn't erased</b>
<br><b>yet.&nbsp; I stared at the board and the letters began</b>
<br><b>rearranging themselves - kind of like scrambling all</b>
<br><b>together to form a new message - but in a blur.&nbsp; I did</b>
<br><b>not want to read that message.&nbsp; I continued to</b>
<br><b>struggle to "wake myself up" and rationalize what was</b>
<br><b>happening when I felt a presence beside me.&nbsp; "It" was</b>
<br><b>sitting in a stuffed chair that was next to the couch</b>
<br><b>(by my head).&nbsp; I forcefully turned my head to look at</b>
<br><b>the thing. It was oddly covered in a flowered sheet</b>
<br><b>(which I did not own).&nbsp; I saw my right arm slowly</b>
<br><b>reach over towards the sheet because I had an</b>
<br><b>overwhelming desire to pull the sheet off of whatever</b>
<br><b>was sitting there.&nbsp; It felt like pushing through</b>
<br><b>almost solidified concrete. At this point, I was</b>
<br><b>really angry at being "frozen" and I wanted to tell</b>
<br><b>the thing off! I felt that my head was turned toward</b>
<br><b>it and saw my arm reach for it, but at the same time,</b>
<br><b>I saw the same arm still pinned to my side (I had two</b>
<br><b>right arms)!&nbsp; I can't even begin to explain that one</b>
<br><b>(someone told me that I began to leave my body).</b>
<br><b>Anyway, I was suddenly aware that I had been fiercly</b>
<br><b>praying to God - saying The Lord's Prayer over and</b>
<br><b>over again.&nbsp; My arm was still reaching for the sheet</b>
<br><b>when all of a sudden, I "woke up."&nbsp; My heart was</b>
<br><b>pounding and my mouth was bone dry.&nbsp; Everything in my</b>
<br><b>apartment was as it should be - including my door,</b>
<br><b>closed and locked.</b>
<br><b>I never did read the "message" on my message board.</b>
<br><b>When I took a shower later that night, I noticed red</b>
<br><b>welts that had begun to bruise (from pinching myself</b>
<br><b>awake)on my thighs.</b>
<br><b>Nothing else ever happened there.</b>
<br><b>I went to a psychic a few months after it happened and</b>
<br><b>he told me that I have a gift of communication.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>told him that I did not want this gift at the moment</b>
<br><b>and he said that I could use it when I was ready to.</b>
<br><b>The reason that I never saw the message is because I</b>
<br><b>chose not to communicate with "it."&nbsp; He also told me</b>
<br><b>that if I wanted to see "it" just say, "In the name of</b>
<br><b>Jesus, what do you want with me?"&nbsp; I don't think that</b>
<br><b>I'm ready for that step just yet.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Any comments are certainly welcome.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Seeking Answers</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, I am eager to get some answers to a few questions that have truly
been</b>
<br><b>annoying me.&nbsp; Allow me to begin with the earliest incident.&nbsp;
My earliest (and</b>
<br><b>I am not certain that this would be considered a haunting, but then
I know</b>
<br><b>NOTHING about this kind of stuff) experience was when I was five
years old.</b>
<br><b>I was in bed and something awoke me.&nbsp; I turned over in bed,
there was my</b>
<br><b>mother standing in my bedroom, and my baby brother was crawling
over to the</b>
<br><b>window.&nbsp; What is bizarre about this is that both had done this
very same</b>
<br><b>thing earlier that day.&nbsp; I sat up in bed and started to talk
to my mother</b>
<br><b>(asking her what she was doing) and she responded or at least I
think she</b>
<br><b>responded, her mouth moved but I could not hear any words.&nbsp;
That was when I</b>
<br><b>became scared and recognized something was not right.&nbsp; I turned
back over</b>
<br><b>toward the wall and thought they would go away, that I was just
dreaming.</b>
<br><b>I'm not sure how long I waited before looking over my shoulder to
see if they</b>
<br><b>were still there but when I did, my mother was still standing in
the same</b>
<br><b>location and my brother was on his knees looking out my bedroom
window (the</b>
<br><b>windows were large and close to the ground).&nbsp; I started yelling
for my dad,</b>
<br><b>he, and mom had the room next to mine.&nbsp; When he came in my
room, I was still</b>
<br><b>watching these figures, I tried to tell my dad what was going on
but he just</b>
<br><b>walked past my mother (the figure) and told me to go get in bed
with my mom</b>
<br><b>that he would sleep in my bed.&nbsp; As I got out of bed and walked
to the door, I</b>
<br><b>was still watching my mother and brother.&nbsp; My mother turned
her head and</b>
<br><b>watched me go out the door.&nbsp; I ran into my parent's room, my
mom was in the</b>
<br><b>bed, and my baby brother was in his baby bed in the same room.&nbsp;
I am 40 years</b>
<br><b>old now and this experience has always left me with questions, why
did I see</b>
<br><b>my mother and brother, I know it wasn't them so who was it, and
why couldn't</b>
<br><b>my dad see these figures?</b>
<br><b>Now for the present, I have lived in this house (not the same house
as above)</b>
<br><b>with my husband and sons for 10 years now.&nbsp; Since moving here
I have felt</b>
<br><b>fine, nothing out of the ordinary has happened, except I see shadows
out of</b>
<br><b>the corner of my eye all the time.&nbsp; When I turn and look nothing
is there.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>even went so far as to have my eyes checked.&nbsp; At first I would
see little</b>
<br><b>darting shadows on or around the floor, I would think…..did I just
see a</b>
<br><b>mouse?&nbsp; Of course, we did not have a mouse problem so I let
it pass and did</b>
<br><b>not think too much about it.&nbsp; Here lately I sit at my computer,
which is</b>
<br><b>right next to my living room window and I see a shadow going by,
just like</b>
<br><b>someone was going toward the front door.&nbsp; I would look out
the window</b>
<br><b>thinking its one of neighborhood children coming to play with one
of my kids,</b>
<br><b>but no one is there.&nbsp; This has happened four or five times
now.&nbsp; My family</b>
<br><b>knows nothing of this and I would like to keep it that way, as I
do not want</b>
<br><b>to scare the children.</b>

<p><b>Sam</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: famob</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Ok, this is not a really scary ghost story but a ghost none the less.&nbsp;
I live in a little house on a busy road and we have a huge oak tree in
our back yard.&nbsp; Well, when I was little I used to climb this tree
and I used to talk to the tree like it was a person and I called it Sam
because Sam is carved in its trunk.&nbsp; Now, this was when I was at least
5 or 6.&nbsp; One day</b>
<br><b>I fell out of the tree and landed on my head but I wasn't hurt the
ground felt soft to me.&nbsp; I remember as I fell I heard a male voice
say " It will be ok, I've got you."&nbsp; I blew it off thinking it was
my dad.&nbsp; But, as I got older I learned my dad was not outside at the
time I fell and he did not even know I feel.&nbsp; So, I went on the internet
and learn that the house</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;was very old built in 1902 and that the people that lived
here when the house was first built had a son named Samual and that he
died when he fell out if the tree in the backyard.&nbsp; Well, I believe
that Sam saved me that day and he is still watching over me.&nbsp; I also
believe that his name is the one in the tree and after my family is gone
I hope he watches over who ever will live in tis house too.&nbsp; Sam is
a good man dead or alive.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Renovations</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Oneredrhose@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>hi this is my story, it happened in Castro Valley, California.&nbsp;
My brother</b>
<br><b>asked me if I wanted to help him clean a house up that had been
remodeled, so</b>
<br><b>I said ok.&nbsp; I started to clean the master bathroom first.&nbsp;
After I cleaned</b>
<br><b>that bathrom, I went in the kitchen to start in there.&nbsp; I left
some cleaning</b>
<br><b>products in the bathroom and when I went back, the bathroom was
dirty again.</b>
<br><b>So, i recleaned it.&nbsp; I went back to the kitchen to finish in
there, and took</b>
<br><b>a break in the den.&nbsp; As I headed back into the kitchen to finish
in there.</b>
<br><b>As I headed down the hallway, I heard the back toilet flush, and
called for</b>
<br><b>my brother, he didn't answer.&nbsp; I called for him again, and
he walked in</b>
<br><b>behind me and asked me what I wanted.&nbsp; I asked him if he just
used the</b>
<br><b>bathroom and he said no, that he has been in the yard.&nbsp; I said
some one used</b>
<br><b>it, because it flushed and it is still running.&nbsp; He went back
there and there</b>
<br><b>wasn't anyone back there.&nbsp; So I went into another part of the
house to clean.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I was half way done with the work, when I turned around to
go back to the</b>
<br><b>den, and this man was walking toward me.&nbsp; The strange thing
was you could see</b>
<br><b>right through him.&nbsp; He wasn't walking on the ground he was
about 6 inches of</b>
<br><b>the floor.&nbsp; I stopped in my tracks, scared stiff.&nbsp; He
disappeared, and I</b>
<br><b>turned around and headed for the door as fast as I could run.&nbsp;
I told my</b>
<br><b>brother he went in there and looked for him but he didn't see anyone.&nbsp;
I made</b>
<br><b>him take me home.&nbsp; On the way home, he told me what had happened
to Cleo, his</b>
<br><b>dog.&nbsp; Apparently, Cleo was in the hallway, barking, she yelped,
pee'd and</b>
<br><b>took of running with her tail between her legs.&nbsp; They caught
up with her and</b>
<br><b>braught her back, cleo fighting all the way, and put her in the
truck, where</b>
<br><b>she stayed on the floor hiding.&nbsp; Then he told me that the owner
of the house</b>
<br><b>committed suicide there, and tried to burn the house down.&nbsp;
So I guess he</b>
<br><b>must have been the owner of the house.</b>

<p><b>Paulsboro Library</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: keko@rcn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Since books and reading have always played a large part in my life
the first thing I did when I moved to Paulsboro in Gloucester County, NJ
was get a library card.&nbsp; The Paulsboro Library is at the corner of
Broad and North Commece and housed&nbsp; in an old sandstone house (that
actually served as a general store way back in the 1870's).&nbsp; Most
of the books are downstairs, but one room upstairs has, among other subjects,
the cook books.&nbsp; And since I like to cook I'd want to review what
cook books were on the shelf.&nbsp; Every time I went up the stairs, I
felt as though someone was right behind me, actually breathing down my
neck.&nbsp; It was almost as though someone was trying to somehow intimidate
me.&nbsp; I don't scare so easily, and every trip to the library found
me climbing the stairs to check out the new cook books ... and wondering
who in world was following me so closely I could almost feel them touch
my back and neck.&nbsp; Recently I've spoken to several other people and
found out that at one time a woman who used to work in the library felt
a "hot spot" halfway up the stairs and smelled candles burning.&nbsp; I've
heard of a "cold spot" involved in a haunting but never a "hot spot".&nbsp;
It was just like a blast of hot air she told me.&nbsp; Then there is the
voice.&nbsp; When busy in the library more than one person has heard their
name called.&nbsp; It's impossible to tell whether it is a man's or a woman's
voice, just a voice calling.&nbsp; Needless to say, no one is there.&nbsp;
That is, no one who can be seen.&nbsp; Another happening is having someone
tap you on the shoulder ... and when you turn around, the room is empty.&nbsp;
Those closely involved in all that has gone on say they believe one entity
is male, the other female.&nbsp; And whoever it is who keeps following
me up those stairs I believe to be a male entity.&nbsp; Stop in the Paulsboro
Library someday and walk around.&nbsp; It is a beautiful building, with
plenty to read.&nbsp; And plenty to keep you occupied.</b>

<p><b>My Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: peace__angel@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have alway been a believer in the Supernatural.I have always been
very in</b>
<br><b>tune with Ghosts and the like. I'll take you through a few of the
things</b>
<br><b>that have happened to me throughout my lifetime.</b>
<br><b>The first ever experience I can remember was when I had just moved
into my</b>
<br><b>own apartment in a rough area of Sydney, Australia. I was always
very afraid</b>
<br><b>of what might happen to me so I slept with a knife under my pillow
and my</b>
<br><b>cat on my bed. One night, I had been forced awake by something to
find my</b>
<br><b>cat on the end of my bed, her back arched and her hair standing
on end. She</b>
<br><b>was staring hard out into my living room. Not wanting to disturb
whoever or</b>
<br><b>whatever was out there, I eased myself down into my bed and grabbed
my</b>
<br><b>knife. I was up for about 3 hours with my cat not stopping the hissing
and</b>
<br><b>stuff, then all of a sudden, she stopped. The cat just went back
to sleep...</b>
<br><b>but I didnt. I did not once hear anyone leave.</b>
<br><b>Just after my first child was born, we moved into a house in a suburb
called</b>
<br><b>Seven Hills. It was&nbsp; a nice enough house. One night when my
mum was staying</b>
<br><b>with us, (she was staying im my daughters bed room where my daughter
hated</b>
<br><b>sleeping) she told me that she had seen a little girl with long
red hair.</b>
<br><b>The little girl looked disturbed, or possessed.I thought nothing
of it until</b>
<br><b>one night when I had just put my little girl to sleep. She was crying
non</b>
<br><b>stop and so I shut the door as your supposed to do. A couple of
minutes</b>
<br><b>later, I heard this thud like something had been thorwn on the ground
in my</b>
<br><b>daughters bedroom. I raced in to find out that she had thrown herself
out of</b>
<br><b>her cot and her body was about 6 metres from her cot. I picked her
up and in</b>
<br><b>her hand were some strnds of red hair . I never let her sleep in
there</b>
<br><b>again. I believe that the little girl my mother had seen was trying
to kill</b>
<br><b>my baby.</b>
<br><b>Another time one night, I was waiting for my husband to come home
and I was</b>
<br><b>watching TV. I heard someone call out 'Maxine!' It sounded just
like my</b>
<br><b>Husband. I had often heard this when I was home alone. I always
thought I</b>
<br><b>was the only one who could hear it but then my daughter(the one
mentioned in</b>
<br><b>the above story) who was about 2 at the time came in and said, 'Mummy,</b>
<br><b>wheres Daddy?' she had heard it too! After this incident, my daughter
had</b>
<br><b>always been very in tune with ghosts as well as I have. At one point,
she</b>
<br><b>even had her own poltergist in her room!</b>
<br><b>The last thing that I can remember happening to me was when I was
doing some</b>
<br><b>spring cleaning. We had bought 2 pictures from an auction. One of
them</b>
<br><b>showed an old lady and the other had 5 kids. They were believed
to be from</b>
<br><b>the same family. The 2 pictures were always in the same room of
the house</b>
<br><b>but I wanted to move the old lady into the living room. Once I placed
the</b>
<br><b>picture down on top of the fire place, I heard a voice say; "No!
No here!'.</b>
<br><b>So i moved it and there hasnt been any disturbances since.</b>

<p><b>Scared</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b>
<br><b>Every bit of this story is true.&nbsp; I live in a house wich is
probably a</b>
<br><b>hundred years old I am not sure about the history surrounding my
house so I</b>
<br><b>can not give you an explanation for why this happened to me.&nbsp;
I was ten years</b>
<br><b>old and it was arond six o'clock at night and I went down the stairs
into the</b>
<br><b>kitchen to tell my house keeper what I wanted for dinner.&nbsp;
When I left the</b>
<br><b>kitchen I walked into the hall way I started getting this feeling
that</b>
<br><b>something was watching me.&nbsp; I ignored it until I was up three
stairs.&nbsp; Now if</b>
<br><b>your on the third step of my stairs and turn around you will be
able to see</b>
<br><b>the corner of the library and see a little inside the room.&nbsp;
I turned around</b>
<br><b>and saw somthing in the corner that appeared to be human but I realy
couldn't</b>
<br><b>make out what it was all I knew that it was watching me and I was
watching</b>
<br><b>it.&nbsp; I must of stood there for at least two minutes staring
at it.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>started to move towards me but it wasn't walking it was floating.&nbsp;
I realised</b>
<br><b>finaly that it was a ghost it took me a while process it.&nbsp;
I then looked at</b>
<br><b>it's body it had a hed,neck,shoulders.&nbsp; The entity must have
only been five</b>
<br><b>to three feet away from me when i noticed it didn't any eyes only
sockets.</b>
<br><b>For some strange reason that didn't frighten me I never got scared
easily as</b>
<br><b>a child and was always able to look at things at both or more angles.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>decided not to run from it because I always had respect for things
of the</b>
<br><b>super natural and things that I didn't understand before I made
a desicion to</b>
<br><b>be scared of it.&nbsp; I didn't want to scare or hurt the spirit
by running away</b>
<br><b>because it was different and wanted to see what it would do.&nbsp;
When it was</b>
<br><b>about two feet away I got a realy bad feeling like inside my stomach
that</b>
<br><b>somthing was wrongh it felt like I was falling.&nbsp; I always have
trusted my</b>
<br><b>instincts and I decided to run.&nbsp; I ran up the stairs I looked
behind once to</b>
<br><b>see the entity right behind me.&nbsp; I ran in to my parents room
and slammed the</b>
<br><b>door. Nothing happened for atleast two seconds but somthing started
banging</b>
<br><b>on the door it was shaking and the spirit was moaning and screaming.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>screamed over its vioce and my sisters all the way down in the basement
heard</b>
<br><b>me scream and came running up.&nbsp; I was sweating and shaking
and felt realy</b>
<br><b>sick.&nbsp; Finaly my sister Gillian mangaged to get me out of the
room it was</b>
<br><b>very cold outside of the room where the spirit was.&nbsp; I wish
I could say they</b>
<br><b>saw or expierenced the ghost but they didn't.&nbsp; You probably
think I am crazy</b>
<br><b>and am imagining this but before this my family lived in another
house and</b>
<br><b>everybody in my family will admit that it was haunted.&nbsp; I think
I can see or</b>
<br><b>feel things that normal people can not.&nbsp; Like when i was three
right after my</b>
<br><b>grandpa died I was playing on the see saw that he gave me and my
sistrers in</b>
<br><b>my grandma's play room.&nbsp; I saw his face looking down on me
and smiling there</b>
<br><b>was a white light around him and he said, "Hello Suzanne. My mom
asked me who</b>
<br><b>I was staring at and I told her it was a man who loved us all very
much and</b>
<br><b>was stopping by to see if we were ok.&nbsp; Now lets get back to
what I was saying</b>
<br><b>earlier Im scared that this entity has taken resident in my room.&nbsp;
At night I</b>
<br><b>always feel like somone is watching me.&nbsp; I hear foot steps
and doors slam</b>
<br><b>shut around the house.&nbsp; One time the door to my room opened
and none of my</b>
<br><b>pets or anbody had opned it.&nbsp; Once it felt like someone was
sitting on my bed</b>
<br><b>at the end and there was a huge dent in the bootom of it.</b>

<p><b>The Man in Grey</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: greg@clas.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>The house that I live in now is full of activity, so it is not unusual
to see something out of the ordinary. One experience I had stands out among
the rest. I was 7 months pregnant at the time. It was about 5 am and my
husband had left for work and&nbsp; I was in bed asleep. I was having a
horrible nightmare. I woke up with a start, eyes popping right open. Standing
at the foot of my bed was a man dressed in a grey suit, he had red hair
and he had a bread. He was standing there watching me. At first I couldn't
believe what I was seeing, but sure enough, he was there. He stayed about
30 seconds and disappeared. I was very moved by the experience. I have
been told that there are 4 spirits in my home and there has been eye witness
accounts of 3 of them and numerous accounts of activity. Living in my home&nbsp;
is a ghost hunters dream!</b>

<br><b>Nursing Home Hauntings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: irocgirl86@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I work in a nursing home in Texas.&nbsp; There have been several
strange things happening lately.&nbsp; We have had more deaths in the past
couple of months than they have had in succession before, not a good record
to break.&nbsp; I will relay one experience from another nurse who works
the night shift.&nbsp; He was sitting at the desk and was monitoring the
video camera.&nbsp; On one of the cameras he saw a lady walking down the
hall and turning into a room.&nbsp; He went to the room to check to see
if everything was alright, and he foung the two residents in this room
fast asleep,&nbsp; and they were not the same lady that he saw.&nbsp; He
described this lady to me and it sounded just like a lady who passed a
couple of weeks before this nurse began working with us.&nbsp; I showed
him a picture of her, and he said that was the lady he saw, when I told
him she had passed recently he got chill up his spine, he said it had to
be the same lady they looked identical, also, one more note, the room she
turned into when he saw her is the same room she passed away in.&nbsp;
It had been her room for sometime, she had no other family so we were her
family.&nbsp; Another story is from one of my aides who told me she kept
hearing a voice calling her name when there was no one in the room, she
said it sounded just the way this lady called her.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now here is my first hand one.&nbsp; The other day, I was sitting at my
desk doing some charting, when a call light went off.&nbsp; I was thinking
who could be in the room, we had everyone out doing activities.&nbsp; I
figured maybe someone had stayed behind to rest or maybe didn't feel up
to going.&nbsp; I went down the hall to answer the light.&nbsp; There were
no resident's on the hall at all, and no other employees.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our
call light system has a good switch on it, it takes more than just a little
tug to make it go off, so, maybe she was just playing with me.&nbsp; There
hasn't been anything bad happen, just voices, and misplaced items, and
the occasional call lights.&nbsp; It can definitely make the work day interesting,
keep up the good work with this site, I love it!</b>

<br><b>Second Hand Bed</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: suepeter@telus.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>About 17 years ago I packed up and moved to another town.&nbsp;
I spent my first night at a friend's house and slept in her spare bedroom.&nbsp;
I was tired and went to bed unusually early, 9:00 p.m. sharp.&nbsp; When
I fell asleep [ or did I ? ] I had a visitor who was not happy about me
being in that bed.&nbsp; A naked, very old man had me by the ankles and
was trying desperately to pull me out of bed.&nbsp; I woke myself up by
trying to call for help.&nbsp; When I looked at the clock, it was two minutes
past nine.&nbsp; The intensity of the ' dream ' and the very brief amount
of time it took to occur floored me.&nbsp; The old man was there, it was
just too vivid.&nbsp; I asked my friend if she knew whether anyone had
died in that room.&nbsp; She said no.&nbsp; Three days later she called
from work to tell me something she forgot about.&nbsp; The bed I had been
sleeping in was one she bought from a neighbour across the street, the
bed had belonged to the Grandfather, and yep, you guessed it, he had died
in it.&nbsp; Interestingly, when my friend had married and had children,
her young daughter would mention the old man she saw now and then in the
basement.&nbsp; She had taken the bed to her new home and had put it in
the spare room downstairs.&nbsp; Her daughter saw the old man many times
and told her Mom about it and my friend realized after some time that it
was no joke and that the old man had come with the bed.&nbsp; Needless
to say, I'll think twice before buying a second hand bed.</b>

<p><b>My Headless Visitor</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:honeybee@bees-r-us.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Are "ghosts" always dead?</b>
<br><b>To this day I don't know if the visitation&nbsp; I am about to relate
was a</b>
<br><b>ghost.</b>
<br><b>In late 1970 my husband and I were living in a&nbsp;&nbsp; 20 some
year old home</b>
<br><b>in NE Sacramento.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our son Justin was born while we lived
here. Like</b>
<br><b>most babies, he had me up in the middle of the night for a while.&nbsp;
This</b>
<br><b>occurrence happened after he had learned to sleep through the night</b>
<br><b>(meaning not waking up till 5 am or so).&nbsp; Up to this time,
we had</b>
<br><b>experienced nothing out of the ordinary.&nbsp; And while I had experienced
a</b>
<br><b>few strange things as a young child, never anything close to this.</b>
<br><b>I had been asleep for some time when I was startled awake by I knew
not</b>
<br><b>what, but felt it must have been a sudden sound.&nbsp; Thinking
it might have</b>
<br><b>been my son, I looked at the clock and it was just past 1 am.&nbsp;
I could</b>
<br><b>not hear anything but I got up to check on him, in his room down
the</b>
<br><b>hall.&nbsp; He was sound asleep.&nbsp; Feeling strangely uneasy,&nbsp;
I walked through</b>
<br><b>the house and checked all the doors and windows, making sure they
were</b>
<br><b>all locked.&nbsp; The house was&nbsp; secure and everything seemed
quiet so I went</b>
<br><b>back to bed.&nbsp; My husband did not awake, being accustomed to
my midnight</b>
<br><b>absences.</b>
<br><b>I had just gotten back into bed when I started hearing a faint noise,</b>
<br><b>which gradually grew louder.&nbsp; I would describe it as a</b>
<br><b>"gurgling/splashing" sound, and at first I thought it was coming
from</b>
<br><b>outside.&nbsp; But as it grew louder it seemed to emanate from inside
our</b>
<br><b>bedroom.&nbsp; I turned onto my back and since our neighbor's yard
light</b>
<br><b>shone in our window, it was easy to see the figure standing at the
foot</b>
<br><b>of our bed, from whom the sound seemed to come.&nbsp; The adrenaline
kicked</b>
<br><b>in and I noticed several things in quick succession.&nbsp; First
was that it</b>
<br><b>seemed to be a man wearing a cape but nothing else.&nbsp; He was
not looking</b>
<br><b>at me but seemed to be oblivious of me, "looking "at the mirror
on an</b>
<br><b>adjacent&nbsp; wall.&nbsp; Then with a shock I realized the gurgling
noise was</b>
<br><b>coming from his neck, he had no head!&nbsp; I could not even scream,
although</b>
<br><b>I sure wanted to.&nbsp; All I could do was bang on my husband next
to me in</b>
<br><b>bed, with my fist.&nbsp; After a couple seconds I was able to get
out a weak</b>
<br><b>sort of yelp and at that time the figure went "pouf" and was gone.</b>
<br><b>My husband thought I had a bad dream and promptly went back to sleep
but</b>
<br><b>I got no more sleep that night.&nbsp; The rest of the night was
uneventful</b>
<br><b>but&nbsp; I vowed to either move out the next day or find someone
to exorcise</b>
<br><b>the house or whatever people did in cases like this.&nbsp; I was
pretty</b>
<br><b>frightened. I was sure I had seen a ghost, and maybe I did, but
something happened</b>
<br><b>later that day to make me wonder.&nbsp; We got a call about a very
close</b>
<br><b>friend who had been out late that night.&nbsp; He had lost control
of his car</b>
<br><b>on a curve and hit a telephone pole.&nbsp; He went through the windshield,</b>
<br><b>doing extensive damage to his face and head.&nbsp; He was rushed
to the</b>
<br><b>hospital and during the time I saw my apparition, he was in surgery,</b>
<br><b>fighting for his life.&nbsp; He was very close to dying but pulled
through.</b>
<br><b>Could our friend have visited us the night before? Could the cape
I saw</b>
<br><b>have been a hospital gown?&nbsp; Could&nbsp; his "looking" at the
mirror and his</b>
<br><b>being headless have anything to do with the massive head and face</b>
<br><b>injuries he had sustained?Our friend went on to a full recovery.&nbsp;
I told him of my experience and he thought it interesting but had no memories
from the time he crashed</b>
<br><b>until he woke up from surgery. The house felt normal after that
time and I never saw the figure again. To this day I wonder if I saw a
ghost or was the recipient of an</b>
<br><b>"out-of-body" experience. Even if I had dreamed the entire episode
(and I know I didn't) it is very strange indeed.</b>

<br><b>Washington Haunts</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: MaiseyA@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;About a year and a half ago me and my family moved into a home
in Tacoma</b>
<br><b>washington. Soon after we moved in I started hearing things....I
mean I would</b>
<br><b>be brushing my teeth and hear my daughter say...MOM...when I would
answer</b>
<br><b>back she would tell me that she didn't say anything...But it was
very loud</b>
<br><b>and clear as if she was right there in the room with me, but no
one else</b>
<br><b>heard it..only me. Then one night we were all watching tv and my
husband</b>
<br><b>heard his mother say his name....but she was asleep in the back
bedroom....no</b>
<br><b>one else heard it....Needless to say it shook him up. Then one day
all my</b>
<br><b>kids were outside playing and I heard a noise in the hall way...I
rounded the</b>
<br><b>corner to catch a glimps of a little boy running through the house...he
had</b>
<br><b>longish, black, straight hair....and a blue shirt, and he appeared
to be</b>
<br><b>about 3 years old. I didn't recognize him so I immediately followed
him</b>
<br><b>around the corner and he was gone....the door wasn't opened and
he was</b>
<br><b>NOWHERE....Then about a month ago I was giving my mother a perm
and she got</b>
<br><b>in the shower to rince out her hair and while I was waiting for
her to finish</b>
<br><b>I was watching the television...I glanced away from the tv for a
split second</b>
<br><b>and saw a woman standing there, when I turned my head back to look</b>
<br><b>again...she was gone. Again, she also was wearing blue....I thought
at first</b>
<br><b>it was my mother...but she was still in the shower....honestly,
she was there</b>
<br><b>as clear a real person...there one split second and gone the next.
That gave</b>
<br><b>me the creeps. There have been other things too...like my computer
typing all</b>
<br><b>by itself and the mouse clicking...but when someone looks at it..it
stops. So</b>
<br><b>far nothing "bad" has bappened to anyone and I hope nothing bad
does</b>
<br><b>happen....Is it possible that who ever is here could have come from
my old</b>
<br><b>house? Weird things happened there too. Anyway, thanks for listening.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Mom's Revelations</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Czathomir@cs.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are some things that happened
to my mom. She just told me</b>
<br><b>recently.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, when
she was a little girl she moved a lot, and one house</b>
<br><b>she lived in was very strange. Most of these thing happened when
only one</b>
<br><b>person was home, two at the most. The most frequent thing happened
WHENEVER</b>
<br><b>her parents left the house. When they&nbsp; left she and her brother
would hear</b>
<br><b>things moving around in the basement. She had a small cat that lived
in the</b>
<br><b>basement, but it probably couldn't move some of the larger things
in the</b>
<br><b>basement, and couldn't tell whenever her parents were gone.&nbsp;
Another thing</b>
<br><b>happened when only she was there. One day a man drove his car into
a lake and</b>
<br><b>drowned. My mom didn't know this the next day when the sighting
happened. She</b>
<br><b>was home alone when a man showed up at the door asking where a bus
stop was.</b>
<br><b>All his clothes from his waist down were soaking wet. She didn't
know anyone</b>
<br><b>had drowned until the next day. One last thing happened to my grandma
when</b>
<br><b>she was by herself. She was in the bathroom when she heard something
outside</b>
<br><b>the door. She called out but noone replied. Then the knob started
turning</b>
<br><b>back and forth. That was enough, so she jumped out the window(it
was a one</b>
<br><b>story house). She didn't see anyone leave&nbsp; the house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another couple things happened to my brother.
When he was five or so he</b>
<br><b>came down the stairs crying. He said he saw a man made out of "blanky"</b>
<br><b>laughing at him.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another thing that happened
to him recurred. Once in a while he would</b>
<br><b>come down from his room upset and claiming a guy was trying to break
through</b>
<br><b>his window. Make of it what you will.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Mother and I</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Kimberlina827@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My mother &amp; I both have a gift as I call it.</b>
<br><b>We could both sense the dead and when they came to visit.</b>
<br><b>My mother would have the dead go to her in dreams and have them
tell her that</b>
<br><b>they were OK.</b>
<br><b>I started dreaming of air planes when i was 21 years old.&nbsp;
These planes would</b>
<br><b>appear out of nowhere and even if it was sunny and nice out, the
skys would</b>
<br><b>become ominus and very dark.</b>
<br><b>The plane would fly over me and I would watch it crash &amp; burn.</b>
<br><b>I began telling my mother of these dreams because it was very reacurring
and</b>
<br><b>it seemed the crashes were getting closer to my home.</b>
<br><b>Only later did we put it together that My uncle was dying of cancer,
he lived</b>
<br><b>six months from diagnosis to death.&nbsp; The plane started out
near his house and</b>
<br><b>the night before he died the plane crashed and burned in my neighbors</b>
<br><b>bakyard.&nbsp; I remember the total feeling of helplessnes.</b>
<br><b>Soon the dreams would come and whoever was with me, I knew it had
something</b>
<br><b>to do with them.</b>
<br><b>My girlfriend was pregnant, My dream was that we were in California
having a</b>
<br><b>great time on vacation and i pulled over my car to get out to use
a telephone</b>
<br><b>booth.&nbsp; All of a sudden, the skys grew black and over the bushes
a plane came</b>
<br><b>and spiraled and crashed and burned.</b>
<br><b>I woke up in a sweat, i told my mother that my girlfriend was going
to lose</b>
<br><b>someone close to her, probably her baby.&nbsp; My mother was very
upset, but I</b>
<br><b>always made sure i told someone of my dream so that they knew I
was not crazy.</b>
<br><b>The next morning my phone rang and it was my girlfriend was on the
other</b>
<br><b>line, she was screaming that her stepfather was killed.&nbsp; Till
this day she</b>
<br><b>never lets me forget my dream.</b>
<br><b>My mother would dream of my sick uncle one night.&nbsp; HE was dying
of cancer and</b>
<br><b>he was at home.&nbsp; He came to her in a dream and told her that
it was time to</b>
<br><b>go. He was sitting on the edge of his bed with the covers turned
down.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>was wearing a grey pin stripe suit.&nbsp; He told her that its okay,
but that they</b>
<br><b>wanted him to come with them and that other relatives were waiting
for him.</b>
<br><b>The next morning my mother got the call that my uncle died&nbsp;
early that</b>
<br><b>morning. When we got to the funeral parlor my uncle was laid out
in a</b>
<br><b>Grey-pin stripe suit.</b>
<br><b>Maybe these are all coincidenses but i really know in my heart and
so does my</b>
<br><b>mother that they are not.&nbsp; We have a special gift and are very
sensitive and</b>
<br><b>open minded about the dead and the supernatural.</b>
<br><b>My mother would be sitting at the table and all of a sudden she
would look at</b>
<br><b>me and say " your sister is going to come over soon for a visit".&nbsp;
Sure</b>
<br><b>enought about 10 minutes later the doorbell would ring, and in she
woul walk.</b>
<br><b>I always asked her about it and she just said that she had very
strong</b>
<br><b>feelings.</b>
<br><b>When i was younger I would neve sleep upstairs alone.&nbsp; I was
very scared of</b>
<br><b>the upstairs. abnormally scared.&nbsp; I never saw anything as far
as I know, but</b>
<br><b>my senses would go wild when i was alone up there.&nbsp; I still
do not like to be</b>
<br><b>alone at night, anywhere.&nbsp; I cant explain it, but i just get
these feelings,</b>
<br><b>and&nbsp; I know that i cant be alone.</b>
<br><b>I would get very strong feelings walking into my grandparents house
after</b>
<br><b>they died.&nbsp; They lived above my parents in their own apartment
(which I live</b>
<br><b>in now with my husband).&nbsp; I would just get a strange sensation
that i needed</b>
<br><b>to leave, so i would go up and come right back down.&nbsp; My mother
said she felt</b>
<br><b>the same way.&nbsp; Only sometimes though. Not all the time.&nbsp;
Since we moved in</b>
<br><b>though, this is one of the safest places I have ever felt.&nbsp;
But I dont like</b>
<br><b>to be alone at night here either.</b>
<br><b>There are so many more experiences that i have encountered as well
as my</b>
<br><b>mother, but if i were to write them all down, we would be here for
months.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>just grazed the surface.</b>

<p><b>My Grandfather</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MDJack77@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I will begin by saying that I am a firm disbeliever when it comes
to ghosts.</b>
<br><b>I have never seen, nor heard, a ghost.&nbsp; I want very much to,
but I will never</b>
<br><b>say that out loud.&nbsp; If one does ever appear, I would like to
be in the</b>
<br><b>company of at least one other living person.&nbsp; I would forever
question my</b>
<br><b>sanity if I were to witness a haunting alone.&nbsp; Anyway... This
story is about</b>
<br><b>my grandfather, who passed away when I was 16 years old.&nbsp; He
was 81 when he</b>
<br><b>passed away, and I had known him all my life - even visited him
quite a few</b>
<br><b>times at the hospital where he died.&nbsp; Whenever my grandmother
would have a</b>
<br><b>problem at the house, or if she was feeling ill, my mother would
send either</b>
<br><b>my sister or myself to spend the night with her.&nbsp; We would
sleep in my</b>
<br><b>grandfather's room.&nbsp; For the most part, this was always fun.&nbsp;
My father</b>
<br><b>pitched for the Yankees, the Royals, and coached the Phillies -
thus, he had</b>
<br><b>a lot of old Baseball items around his room.&nbsp; I used to look
through his</b>
<br><b>stuff as a kid.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll get to the point, now.&nbsp; One day,
while my grandmother took her</b>
<br><b>annual trip to Florida, I went over to check up on the house.&nbsp;
To make sure</b>
<br><b>the light timers were set, to see if anything was on that shouldn't
be.</b>
<br><b>While there, I called my friend to make plans for that evening.&nbsp;
After</b>
<br><b>talking to him for a while, he said, "Hey!&nbsp; Why is Matt there
with you?".&nbsp;&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>laughed.&nbsp; I was completely alone at the house.&nbsp; Matt,
our other friend, was</b>
<br><b>at work and I knew this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Matt isn't here!"&nbsp;
I said.&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can hear him in</b>
<br><b>the background, you idiot!" my friend said.&nbsp;&nbsp; "He isn't
here!"&nbsp; I shouted,</b>
<br><b>trying to make it clear to my friend that I was alone.</b>
<br><b>"I can hear him calling your name!!!" my friend shouted back.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I stopped and</b>
<br><b>paused. "Hear anything now?&nbsp; What do you hear?" I asked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"I hear your name!&nbsp; It's</b>
<br><b>Matt's voice!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked around.&nbsp;
I looked at all of the stereotypical</b>
<br><b>places that a ghost might be at.&nbsp; The stairs... The mirror
(shiver)... The</b>
<br><b>chair... nothing.&nbsp; "Hey.&nbsp; I'm coming over to your house.&nbsp;
Do you SWEAR you heard my name?""Clear as DAY!" my friend said.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I hung up the phone and ran to my car -</b>
<br><b>goosebumps covering my body.</b>
<br><b>The thing was, my friend Matt has a fairly deep voice - much like
my</b>
<br><b>Grandfather.&nbsp; In fact, the two are very similar.&nbsp; And
although I didn't hear</b>
<br><b>anything but my friend on that phone line, I do believe my friend.&nbsp;
And I</b>
<br><b>refuse to be in that house by myself.</b>

<p><b>hello ,here is my story ok this happenend about 3 yrs ago we live
in a small town in wv and i havent really heard any true ghost stories
befor and i am not sure if that is what happened to us or not my mother
who i havent ever really lived with contacted me and we wrote to each other
and talked on the phone alot after some time she asked me to bring my 3yr
old daughter and come to fl to visit with her my family members had told
me in the past not to go around her by myself in fear that she would kidnap
me so i was somewhat afraid to go even though i was married and had a child
the fear of not ever coming home again was scary but i wanted so much to
go i was afraid of betraying my family who had raised me for so long by
going but i had to know what she was like so i agreed to go i worried so
much about going though i could hardly sleep at night and i kept asking
for a sign to let me know it was ok to go .... my grandfather(her dad)
was close to me although i didnt see him often he died when i was around
17 i forgot to add in that i did see him some throghout my life but my
family wouldnt let me have anything else to do with any other of my mothers
family so anyway after worrying for weeks about going and asking for a
sign and getting no response one night i found my self drifting off into
a deep sleep and here comes the wierd part the next morning i woke up and
i wasnt worried anymore about going and was thinking about what a good
night sleep i had had when my husband told me of a dream or what he thought
to be a dream he said that he awoke in his dream to see a white misty figure
coming out of our living room into our bedroom it came over to my side
of the bed and stared at</b>
<br><b>me sleeping and then it when over and leaned over my daughters crib
bed my husband was trying to move but he couldnt and he tried to speak
but he couldnt then the figure came to the foot of the bed stared at him
it didnt have eyes or a face it was just white and nothing . then is vanished
he said he was afraid at first then at the end was in peace and then he
drifted back to sleep i believe in my heart this was a angel or spirit
watching over my daughter and i and it was meant for my husband to see
it so he cold tell me about i do honestly think it may have been my grandfather

<br><b>"Little Tanya"&nbsp; - Holiday Inn; Grand Island, NY</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: InkPoisoning24@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Julie, and I live on Grand Island, NY.&nbsp;&nbsp; If
you're familiar with famous haunted sites</b>
<br><b>in the US, then you might have heard of Tanya, the little girl who
"lives" in</b>
<br><b>the Holiday Inn on Grand Island.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tanya is about five, with long, wild locks
of hair and a red velvet</b>
<br><b>dress with high black button shoes.&nbsp; She rarely shows herself,
though, as</b>
<br><b>she's very shy.&nbsp; She's also quite sensitive - if you yell at
her (out of fear</b>
<br><b>or anger at the pranks she's pulled on you) she'll disappear for
days, afraid</b>
<br><b>that she'll be in trouble again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one really knows how Tanya died, but
most people believe it was when</b>
<br><b>her house burned down (and the house was on the site the hotel is
on now.)</b>
<br><b>There was a large house there during Tanya's time that burned down
at least</b>
<br><b>once, but no one has&nbsp; been able to find evidence of a little
girl's death.</b>
<br><b>Others say she drowned in the well on her family's property (which
is</b>
<br><b>possible, though it's strange that she'd be out playing in such
a pretty</b>
<br><b>dress.)&nbsp; The last "explaination" is pretty romantic and is
the one my elderly</b>
<br><b>next-door neighbors believe - that she drowned in the Niagara River
(which</b>
<br><b>the hotel is situated on) on her birthday - the heavy velvet of
the dress</b>
<br><b>soaked up water and prevented her from swimming to shore.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At any rate, Tanya is a sweet little thing
whose worst prank was</b>
<br><b>probably when she messed up newly-made beds in a vacant room and
partially</b>
<br><b>displaced a headboard (well, little kids like jumping on beds, after
all...)</b>
<br><b>What I'm trying to say is, the things she does are never harmful
or mean, nor</b>
<br><b>intended to make anyone too upset.&nbsp; She drops things sometimes,
pushes little</b>
<br><b>things over, and there's been times when I've been sitting in the
back office</b>
<br><b>(I'm a front desk clerk) and I've heard her little feet shuffle
in front of</b>
<br><b>me on the carpet, like she's dragging them to make a sound.&nbsp;
When I first</b>
<br><b>began at the Inn as a maid, Tanya suprised me on my first day with
two pranks</b>
<br><b>that occurred in her "favorite room", 412.&nbsp; First, she moved
the station dial</b>
<br><b>on the clock radio I had on (I watched the orange marker go back
and forth,</b>
<br><b>from station 89 to 107 and back) which scared the heck out of me.&nbsp;
Later,</b>
<br><b>after being reassured by some exasperated older maids that she's
not doing</b>
<br><b>anything to hurt me and to just leave her be, I went back to the
room and</b>
<br><b>began cleaning the bathroom.&nbsp; She dropped the ice bucket lid
on the floor</b>
<br><b>three trimes from where it lay on the counter.&nbsp; I took the
maids' advice and</b>
<br><b>said very nicely, "Tanya, please stop."&nbsp; And she did.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another time, I walked through the fire
doors in the hall (you know, the</b>
<br><b>heavy doors that close in case of a fire to prevent it from spreading
to the</b>
<br><b>other side of the building) and as soon as I did, they closed behind
me.</b>
<br><b>Now, these doors are held fast to the wall by magnets the size of
small</b>
<br><b>dinner plates.&nbsp; I had to get the linen boys to open them back
up, because</b>
<br><b>they were too heavy and far up for me to reach.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guests staying overnight are welcome to
quietly walk the halls (without</b>
<br><b>disturbing other guests, of course :)) in search of Tanya.&nbsp;
I'm not supposed</b>
<br><b>to say this, but if you're just ghost hunting and not on vacation
but just</b>
<br><b>stopping by, walk around; look in the halls and the bar; knock yourself
out.</b>
<br><b>We're pretty easy-going front desk clerks. :)&nbsp; I can't gurantee
you'll see</b>
<br><b>anything (the things Tanya does are spontaneous; like I said, she's
shy) but</b>
<br><b>your best chances are probably midnight to early morning hours.&nbsp;
You can sit</b>
<br><b>in the lobby if you want, or ask the clerks about Tanya (there's
nothing</b>
<br><b>better to do, it's not like any guests check in at those hours...you'll
be</b>
<br><b>doingt them a favor!) but as I said, she's a secretive little girl.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please don't be that person who comes,
armed with ouija board and black</b>
<br><b>candles, attempting to exorcise her or make her "give signs", etc.&nbsp;
She's</b>
<br><b>just&nbsp; alittle kid, she can't spell works out on the board,
and she'll</b>
<br><b>probably be too afraid of you to "visit", anyway.&nbsp; But do say
hi to her!&nbsp; And</b>
<br><b>consider yourself one lucky guy (or gal) if you see a little girl
of Tanya's</b>
<br><b>description walking down the halls!</b>

<br><b>died of cancer. I never woke up so fast in my life. Something just
told me to</b>
<br><b>wake up and when i flapped my eyes open there was the brightest
light i have</b>
<br><b>ever seen...but at that same second it dissapeared but i kept seeing
its</b>
<br><b>outline...it was big. For some reason i wasnt scared and i felt
peaceful so i</b>
<br><b>knew it must have been my father looking over me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another story is one of my brother when he was
a small boy...i was a</b>
<br><b>baby. He was getting yelled at by my mother for something he did
wrong and</b>
<br><b>when he looked past her at the closet there he saw our grandfather
who was</b>
<br><b>dead shaking his finger in dissapointment.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My third story is another of my fathers presence
that my mother told me</b>
<br><b>over dinner one night. Our faucet was leaking and every day it got
worse and</b>
<br><b>worse with the dripping....until it was almost running out. My mother
said</b>
<br><b>alound i wish Ed(my father) was here and he would have this fixed
in 5</b>
<br><b>minutes. She turned around to grab the phone book to call somebody
but the</b>
<br><b>dripping suddenly stopped and when she turned around it had completely</b>
<br><b>stopped. Thinking it would start up again in a few days she was</b>
<br><b>doubtful...but it never dripped again after that.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for letting me share my stories.</b>

<br><b>My Families Experiences</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: vampire699@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, i'm writing to tell about a experiences with ghosts. One is about
a</b>
<br><b>relative who had seen a ghost that seemed to fortell the future
It happened</b>
<br><b>before I was born. She was sitting in her kitchen early in the morning
when</b>
<br><b>she saw a ghost that looked exactly like one of her sons. Obviously,
she was</b>
<br><b>frightened and told the son who the ghost resembed not to go to
work and</b>
<br><b>that she had seen a ghost.</b>
<br><b>He didn't go to work, but his brother did. Later, she heard news
that the</b>
<br><b>brother who went to work was killed in some accident.</b>
<br><b>When I was real little, about two or three, my parents moved into
this</b>
<br><b>house. It used to be a small cabin and they added a lot of rooms
until it</b>
<br><b>was big. The kitchen, a quaint, cute little place was about forty
and the</b>
<br><b>basement, one of the creepiest places in the world, was also about
forty or</b>
<br><b>fifty. The guy who had lived there had killed himself before we
moved in and</b>
<br><b>I was somewhat freaked out, though I gave it hardly any thought.
My dad told</b>
<br><b>me that doors slammed downstairs.</b>
<br><b>But, when I was about six or seven years of age, I stood in front
of my</b>
<br><b>dresser mirror when I looked out into the hallway to see a shadowed
figure,</b>
<br><b>that looked like a Mafia guy's shadow, sneak across the hallway,
towards the</b>
<br><b>staircase. It had a fedora and trenchcoat and I remember being spooked
and</b>
<br><b>running down to my dad.</b>
<br><b>My dad was laying in bed one time when he saw the stereo cabinet
in his room</b>
<br><b>shaking for about three seconds and then stop. When I was nine,
his</b>
<br><b>girlfriend's daughter claimed to have seen a face glowing on the
wall and</b>
<br><b>snarling at her. That's all I really heart about the place and,
when I was</b>
<br><b>nine we moved out.</b>
<br><b>Another experience happened to someone I vaguelly know. They went
to a</b>
<br><b>morgue and two spirits followed them home. Their spouse yelled at
them for</b>
<br><b>bringing spirits home. They left and, besides the ghost cat that
inhabits</b>
<br><b>the house, there isn't anything more of those two or any other human
ghosts</b>
<br><b>for that matter.</b>

<p><b>Life After Death</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LBagley@Newhavenct.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have always believed in life after death.&nbsp; But it wasn't until
I moved into my grandparents house that I began experiencing&nbsp; strange
activity.&nbsp; My grandfather retired about 13 years ago and was moving
down to Florida.&nbsp; They wanted to keep the house, built in 1929, in
the family so my parents agreed to move in.&nbsp; When I was about 14,
I woke up one early morning before my parents.&nbsp; I was in the den watching
t.v. when I heard footsteps coming down the stairs and into the kitchen.&nbsp;
But, when I went out to the kitchen to say good morning, no on was there.&nbsp;
My parents were still sound asleep upstairs in their bedroom.&nbsp; I really
thought nothing of it until yesterday.&nbsp; I asked my mother if she had
ever experienced anything strange in the house.&nbsp; She told me she hears
footsteps every once in awhile!&nbsp; There was another time when my parents
had gone to bed and I was up reading.&nbsp; My one and only cat was sleeping
right beside&nbsp; me when all of a sudden I heard this bang as if 5 pots
and pans had fallen to the floor.&nbsp; I know that it was not the pans
settling, and there was nothing on the counters to cause such a loud noise.&nbsp;
I know I wasn't dreaming because my cat jumped a mile!&nbsp; When I am
out with my boyfriend, I always wait until after 4 AM to return home.&nbsp;
Even at that time, I sometimes feel like someone is watching me.&nbsp;
Nothing bad has ever happened, but I get very scared none the less.</b>

<br><b>Loud Footsteps</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: CURTISKEG@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>First I'd like to say none of the following experiences have occurred
before</b>
<br><b>or after living in the house I am about to talk about.&nbsp; The
house we lived in</b>
<br><b>was very small, only about 700 sq ft.&nbsp; It began the first night
we moved in.</b>
<br><b>I was awoken by the sound similar to a car running through the wall.&nbsp;
I got</b>
<br><b>up, went outside and looked all around the house, nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then we started</b>
<br><b>hearing footsteps at night.&nbsp; This got to be such a regular
thing that we</b>
<br><b>began to get used to it.&nbsp; Once we did, the footsteps got louder,
similar to</b>
<br><b>someone stomping across the floor on their heels.&nbsp; Things began
to disappear</b>
<br><b>all the time.&nbsp; This got to be such a regular event that my
wife would say out</b>
<br><b>loud "OK I have had enough, please return the item".&nbsp;&nbsp;
A few minutes later it</b>
<br><b>would appear right where we thought it was in the beginning.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Another thing</b>
<br><b>that was really weird was while watching TV, out of the blue our
dog would</b>
<br><b>jump down off the chair, run to the doorway of the bedroom, and
stand there</b>
<br><b>and bark like someone just walked into the room.&nbsp; Well that's
my story, and</b>
<br><b>like I said before, nothing like this has happened before or after
living at</b>
<br><b>that house.</b>
