<b>Plantation Home</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: ffoore@asapinc.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, I am not sure if this is a ghost story or just me being nervous
because</b>
<br><b>of old fables, but I'll share it with you and am anxious to hear
what you</b>
<br><b>think. First of all I am from south Louisiana, where ghosts, voodoo,
and</b>
<br><b>haunted antebellum homes are a way of life, or at least a big part
of the</b>
<br><b>history down there. About three miles from my parents home, where
I grew up</b>
<br><b>there is an old Plantation house, which I believe was built in the
1800's. I</b>
<br><b>know that I am going to skip around because I feel like I have to
explain</b>
<br><b>everything, but please bear with me. While I was growing up, I always
felt</b>
<br><b>scared to be outside or even alone in my parents house, but I don't
think</b>
<br><b>the house itself was haunted, but maybe the area because it was
so close to</b>
<br><b>this old house. Anyway, I actually never even noticed the house
until like</b>
<br><b>only six or so years ago, when finally someone bought it and decided
to</b>
<br><b>refurbish it. The house was once known as the Stephanie Plantation,
Then as</b>
<br><b>The Halphin House, and I believe that there was also one more name
for it,</b>
<br><b>but can't think of it right now. The new owner put a lot of effort
into</b>
<br><b>doing research into the history of the house and how it looked,
you know</b>
<br><b>pretty much to find out anything and everything about it. First
of all he</b>
<br><b>was a friend of my father so we got to see the house through many
stages of</b>
<br><b>its "rebirth". The new owner took before and after photos of the
house. The</b>
<br><b>before photos really scared me. There were I believe 5 faces or
bodies of</b>
<br><b>ghosts in the pictures, but they were very clear. One looked like
a man,</b>
<br><b>maybe with a beard and very proper demeanor, another was a lady
in a ball</b>
<br><b>gown (that was what the silhouette looked like) and possibly a crown,</b>
<br><b>another looked like a small child looking out of the window, and
another</b>
<br><b>just a blur, but one looked like a man creaming and it seemed to
have chains</b>
<br><b>on his wrists. I don't know what exactly to say about these pictures,
but I</b>
<br><b>know what I saw and I know how that house felt, and I believed them.&nbsp;
I have</b>
<br><b>always felt a type of sixth sense if you want to call it that, my
dreams</b>
<br><b>often come true, ESP is a frequent thing for me, and I always get
these</b>
<br><b>"feelings". I am not trying to say I am psychic, because I am not
sure</b>
<br><b>exactly what this is, but I have come to try use them more and more.
ANYWAY.</b>
<br><b>The house was very cold, even though it was the dead of summer,
probably 100</b>
<br><b>degrees and humid (you know the typical south!) anyway, and it had
this VERY</b>
<br><b>eerie and unwelcoming and not very peaceful "feeling" to it. And
as weird as</b>
<br><b>it may seem I kept getting these like glimpses or flashback that
were very</b>
<br><b>dark but they were of this house. The new owner had tons of stories
of</b>
<br><b>"hauntings" by him and previous visitors or just stories that were</b>
<br><b>documented. I talked to this friend of my mother-in-law who is really
into</b>
<br><b>this stuff, and she seems to think that for some reason I have a
connection</b>
<br><b>with this house, that it isn't just me being a channel. I don't
know what to</b>
<br><b>think, I don't really want to know. Every Time I visited this house
I would</b>
<br><b>get the creeps, and always in the same places. The was this small
closet</b>
<br><b>looking space on the top, third floor, which was recorded to have
been used</b>
<br><b>as an infirmary in the war. I was standing near it, thinking, I
was getting</b>
<br><b>a funny feeling about it, and didn't notice my brother behind me--as&nbsp;
a joke</b>
<br><b>he picked me up and pushed me inside of it, and I will never forget
the</b>
<br><b>black flash (if that makes sense) that came to me I am not sure
if I</b>
<br><b>actually saw it or just "remembered" it, but it was one of the single
most</b>
<br><b>frightening events to date. It was like I could hear just for that
brief</b>
<br><b>second screaming and cries and see so many people in that small
space. I</b>
<br><b>don't know I guess I can't really explain it. Anyway, the room that
was</b>
<br><b>supposed to be the infirmary still has blood stains on the floor
even though</b>
<br><b>the original boards have been removed and replaced, I truly think
something</b>
<br><b>more happened up there. So then all of a sudden this guy and his
wife up and</b>
<br><b>sold the house to my father's cousin, Curtis. Well, he got a grant
form the</b>
<br><b>state to do further research on the house and he actually tracked
down many</b>
<br><b>originally pieces from the house. In the meantime of all of this
I get</b>
<br><b>engaged and one day I woke up and something told me that I should
have my</b>
<br><b>wedding pictures taken in the old Halphin house. SO I called him
up and</b>
<br><b>asked if that would be ok. he was reluctant because he really didn't
want</b>
<br><b>anymore pictures taken n and of the house, but finally agreed. So
I went</b>
<br><b>back because I was so totally drawn back to this house. Since Curtis
has</b>
<br><b>been restoring this house, there is a much more peaceful air in
it--really.</b>
<br><b>And anyway, as I was walking around, I prepared myself to be more
open to</b>
<br><b>anything. I walked in the ballroom and got this very clear vision
of this</b>
<br><b>lady with a beautiful gown and crown on (maybe the lady in the picture?)
and</b>
<br><b>even though I had already had my wedding dress picked out, I&nbsp;
immediately</b>
<br><b>wen home and asked my mother to make the dress exactly as I told
her. And</b>
<br><b>she did, though she found it was very hard to understand me sometimes.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, the dress turned out beautiful and exactly as I had envisioned
it</b>
<br><b>and of course I topped it off with a small crown. I went and took
the</b>
<br><b>pictures and when I walked out of the room dressed that way, I felt
the most</b>
<br><b>wonderful, peaceful, and almost happy vibe rush in and out me. I
t was like</b>
<br><b>just me looking that way brought peace to the house. The pictures
wen well,</b>
<br><b>but there are a couple of questionable ones which I want to send
to you to</b>
<br><b>examine when I receive them back form my mother. They were taken
on a dead</b>
<br><b>tree but where we believe someone (Or more than one) was hung to
death. In</b>
<br><b>the tops of the trees there is a mist. I thought it was the sun,
but some</b>
<br><b>say no--I would just like to see what you think. Anyway, to Thank
Curtis I</b>
<br><b>sent him a blownup picture of the entire exterior of the house with
me</b>
<br><b>standing on the balcony of the master room. he later came to tell
my father</b>
<br><b>that he can't explain it&nbsp; but since that day there has been
a great peaceful</b>
<br><b>feeling in the house. I am anxious to hear what you think and then
again</b>
<br><b>about the pictures, I hope I have not wasted too much of your time.
Thank</b>
<br><b>you.</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Father's Ghost</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I don't know if this qualifies, but I've only had one experience
in my life</b>
<br><b>that I believe was supernatural, and that was right after my father
died.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>died unexpectedly from complications during a somewhat routine surgery,
and</b>
<br><b>we were all devastated. My sisters blamed the hospital and the doctors,
which</b>
<br><b>I too believe to some extent. The saddest part is we live 30 minutes
from</b>
<br><b>Boston where the best doctors and hospitals are, and he died in,
as my sister</b>
<br><b>put it, a "provincial little butchershop" not 10 minutes away. But
anyway,</b>
<br><b>after his funeral had passed and we all went home, I had a very
real dream</b>
<br><b>about him, but it wasn't broken up and wierd like dreams usually
are, it was</b>
<br><b>very linear and logical, and I believe I actually spoke to him.&nbsp;
I was in a</b>
<br><b>very large house with hundreds of rooms, and hundreds of people
filling each</b>
<br><b>room, and I had to look around a while before I found him.&nbsp;
He was sitting in</b>
<br><b>an armchair in a robe and a pair of pajamas I'd never seen before,
looking</b>
<br><b>out a window.&nbsp; I couldn't see what was outside the window,
my impression was</b>
<br><b>just of a lot of people waiting for something. (Yes I'm Catholic,
but please,</b>
<br><b>no limbo references, I don't just believe!). I knelt by his chair
and took</b>
<br><b>his hand, and I remember being very angry. I asked him what happened,
why we</b>
<br><b>didn't know this would happen to him.&nbsp; He shook his head and
said "It wasn't</b>
<br><b>the doctor's fault. They did the best they could." I told him I
loved him and</b>
<br><b>missed him, and he said he knew. I even joked about his new pajames,
and he</b>
<br><b>just smiled. I know this may be psychological, but one thing: I
told my</b>
<br><b>mother about the pajamas he was wearing, and she said they sounded
like the</b>
<br><b>ones he wore in the hospital.&nbsp; I never got to see him in the
hospital, he was</b>
<br><b>gone too soon. I believe I really did talk to him.</b>

<p><b>My Guardian Great-Grandfather</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; dmouat@ccllabel.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I moved into my current house about 9 years ago. From time to time
I</b>
<br><b>suspected I had a spirit living there, but since I never saw it,
I could not</b>
<br><b>be sure. I would go into the basement to do laundry and would feel
like</b>
<br><b>someone was there with me. Occasionally I would go down to remove
clothes</b>
<br><b>from the washer and put them in the dryer and someone would have
opened the</b>
<br><b>lid on the washer, which of course prevented the cycle from finishing.
I am</b>
<br><b>the only one who ever does laundry and I could never swear that
I just</b>
<br><b>hadn't forgotten, but it happened 5 or 6 times a year for the first
2 years</b>
<br><b>we lived there, then hasn't happened since.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I became pretty sure there was at least an occasional "visitor" when
I had</b>
<br><b>two different dogs, on two different occasions, go crazy over something
I</b>
<br><b>couldn't see. One day the male dog spent about 20 minutes staring
out the</b>
<br><b>back door at the steps that led down to the patio, growling and
snarling at</b>
<br><b>something, the hair on his back raised. This was the mildest, gentlest</b>
<br><b>beagle you ever met. He didn't bark at other dogs, at visitors,
at intruding</b>
<br><b>squirrels and cats in his yard. This behavior was out of the ordinary,
to</b>
<br><b>say the least. Nothing we did, not even food, could get him to abandon
his</b>
<br><b>stance until finally he just stopped and walked away.</b><b></b>
<p><b>My second dog is a little more highly strung, but she too got upset
at</b>
<br><b>something in the dining room one day and refused to budge, snarling
and</b>
<br><b>staring, with hair on end. Again, nothing would persuade her to
give up her</b>
<br><b>defensive posture until finally she just quit after maybe 10 or
15 minutes.</b>
<br><b>We joked that the dogs must be seeing ghosts.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Somewhere in all of this I decided there was an old man in the house.
I</b>
<br><b>never saw him but somehow I felt that if there was a ghost, it was
an old</b>
<br><b>man. I thought maybe it was the man who built the house, but I don't
know if</b>
<br><b>he has passed on or not. I wasn't scared, nor did I even give the
matter</b>
<br><b>much thought, since there were no problems.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Recently my brother-in-law, who has been developing his psychic abilities
at</b>
<br><b>an astounding rate, decided to check over my house for "energies".
He</b>
<br><b>informed me there was a spirit in the house, mostly in my bedroom
and it was</b>
<br><b>terribly anxious and sad. But he could tell me no more. He was intrigued</b>
<br><b>enough to consult with one of his teachers, though, and came back
to me a</b>
<br><b>few days later with the startling news that this being was my</b>
<br><b>great-grandfather (who died when I was 5 and whom I never really
knew). My</b>
<br><b>great-grandfather felt he had never done enough for his family when
he was</b>
<br><b>alive (he was a kindly man, apparently, but very poor with a large
family)</b>
<br><b>and was simply desperate to help us now. Well, I guess that explains
my "old</b>
<br><b>man".</b><b></b>
<p><b>I started thinking about some events which might have resulted in
great</b>
<br><b>injury to my children but did not... The time my littlest son (age
3) got a</b>
<br><b>box of wooden matches from somewhere (we had company at the time
- I really</b>
<br><b>am not a careless mother!) and proceeded to sit on my bed, lighting
them and</b>
<br><b>dropping them on the sheets until he was discovered... Many little
scorch</b>
<br><b>marks on the sheets but somehow he did not set himself or the bed
on fire.</b>
<br><b>Or this same child who got up in the night (about 4 am) and played
in the</b>
<br><b>kitchen until we woke up and put him back in bed. I tucked him in,
got him</b>
<br><b>some water and went back to my bed and after I was almost back asleep
I got</b>
<br><b>the strongest thought that I should go check on him again. So I
hauled</b>
<br><b>myself out of bed and went to his room in time to confiscate the
large</b>
<br><b>serrated, pointed knife he had snuck into his bed (playing it was
a</b>
<br><b>"sword"). There have been other events but these are the most recent.
I</b>
<br><b>think Great-grandpa takes his role as helper very seriously. I talked
to him</b>
<br><b>and told him he is welcome in my home because I can use all the
help I can</b>
<br><b>get with my kids! I wish I'd known him.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Possessed Dog</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: dmouat@ccllabel.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have been working with a teacher to raise my spiritual consciousness
and</b>
<br><b>in the process have developed a few of what he tells me were (until
now)</b>
<br><b>latent psychic abilities. For anyone who is scared of that prospect,
let me</b>
<br><b>tell you that, when done with love and a desire for the highest
good, it is</b>
<br><b>gentle and pleasant. Nothing bad has happened, and I have received
a lot of</b>
<br><b>help when I asked for it. I realize now there are spirits all around
us.</b>
<br><b>Many are like the beings you encounter on this plane - mostly decent</b>
<br><b>(sometimes confused or lonely) but there can be some anger or malevolence.</b>
<br><b>Also, not all spirits are or were human, which is where this story
comes in.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have a 5 year old female beagle. We got her when she was about
1 1/2 years</b>
<br><b>old, from a woman who had been injured and could not keep her. She
is no</b>
<br><b>show animal but seemed sweet enough to be with my kids, which is
what</b>
<br><b>mattered. After we had had her for a little while, though, I realized
I</b>
<br><b>really did not like this dog. She was impossibly greedy and single-minded
in</b>
<br><b>her pursuit of food, raiding the garbage, stealing from the table,
etc...</b>
<br><b>She refused to stay off forbidden furniture. She knew she wasn't
supposed to</b>
<br><b>get in my bed or on the sofa and she would run when she heard me
coming, but</b>
<br><b>did it anyway. And nervous! She barked at the slightest noise, paced
around</b>
<br><b>all the time, constantly pestered my husband when he would sit down,</b>
<br><b>followed us from room to room, always underfoot. I found myself
experiencing</b>
<br><b>incredible rage toward this animal. Even friends who spent any time
around</b>
<br><b>her agreed she was a difficult dog. She just got on your nerves.
I found</b>
<br><b>myself in arguments with my husband when really what was wrong was
the dog's</b>
<br><b>behavior had rubbed us raw. I wanted to get rid of her but figured
no one</b>
<br><b>else could tolerate her either and that might mean cruelty in her
future.</b>
<br><b>Also my son would never have forgiven me.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I began taking classes with my teacher over this past summer and
one day he</b>
<br><b>asked me if I had any pets. I began to rant and rave about how I
had this</b>
<br><b>pain-in-the-neck dog that I really despised. I rarely get so emphatic
about</b>
<br><b>anything, but my dislike totally took over me. My teacher informed
me that a</b>
<br><b>demon had attached itself to my dog. He said it wasn't human, and
not</b>
<br><b>exactly going to ruin my life, just had found my dog as a way to
experience</b>
<br><b>some life on this plane. However, it was negative and would create
no good,</b>
<br><b>and probably some mischief. He suggested I call a mutual friend
and ask him</b>
<br><b>to exorcise it. Contrary to what you may have heard, this isn't
neccessarily</b>
<br><b>done through prayer. Prayer has little effect on non-human, or non-Christian</b>
<br><b>entities. It's a matter of manipulating energy and opening a vortex
to</b>
<br><b>another plane, but not to be attempted by the amateur.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I called the friend and we agreed he would come to my house on Thursday.
On</b>
<br><b>Tuesday night I had a bizarre dream, or maybe vision. I felt an
intrusion in</b>
<br><b>my room, enough to wake me up. I awakened enough to "see", in my
mind's eye,</b>
<br><b>a horrid object running out of my room on all fours. It was about
the size</b>
<br><b>of a chimpanzee, and looked like a cross between a dog and a monkey.
It was</b>
<br><b>dark brown, glistening, hairless and heavily muscled. I didn't see
the head</b>
<br><b>or face because it was leaving very fast. I think the "demon" knew
I was on</b>
<br><b>to it.</b><b></b>
<p><b>My friend came on Thursday and agreed there was something "on" the
dog. He</b>
<br><b>worked a few minutes and then when he left told me he'd call tomorrow.
We</b>
<br><b>couldn't discuss it then because my kids were there and I didn't
want to</b>
<br><b>scare them. The next morning, my 12 year old son said he'd had the
most</b>
<br><b>horrible nightmare - that a wild dog was out in our yard and was
furiously</b>
<br><b>trying to get in. Eventually it crashed through the family room
windows</b>
<br><b>(where our dog was sleeping, BTW) and chased him around the house.
HMMM, I</b>
<br><b>thought, but said nothing.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Later I called my friend, who said he had been unable to capture
the demon.</b>
<br><b>The minute he tried it took off like a shot. In order to help protect
us</b>
<br><b>though, he'd created a bubble of protection around my house so it
couldn't</b>
<br><b>get back in. He also created one around the dog. I told him about
my son's</b>
<br><b>nightmare and we thought it pretty striking. He did some more work
about a</b>
<br><b>week later and was able to capture and send away this thing.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The upshot is that my dog has calmed down considerably. She spends
the</b>
<br><b>evenings in her bed instead of pacing the house. She barks less
and somehow</b>
<br><b>lacks the irritant qualities she possessed in such abundance. I
find myself</b>
<br><b>much calmer in her presence. Maybe I was sensing something about
her before</b>
<br><b>that led to such dislike.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Real Experience</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: ademutskiy@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>One day, when I was 15 years old, I decided to</b>
<br><b>rearrange my bedroom. It took me all day to get</b>
<br><b>everything where I wanted. So at around 11:40 p.m., I</b>
<br><b>turned on the TV. to watch Jay Leno. I got in bed</b>
<br><b>wrapped myself in the blankets and relaxed after all</b>
<br><b>that work. It wasn't 2 mins. when all of a sudden I</b>
<br><b>felt a hand slam hard against my bed, near my feet.</b>
<br><b>Needless to say I bolted up, I had no clue as to what</b>
<br><b>had happened. I got out of bed and looked under it,</b>
<br><b>and in my closet I really didn't know what I was</b>
<br><b>looking for..even though I didn't know what I had just</b>
<br><b>experienced I wasn't spooked, I really didn't think it</b>
<br><b>was a ghost. I knew what had felt, and that I was the</b>
<br><b>only one in my room with the door closed. So I got up</b>
<br><b>went to the kitchen where my mother was, and told her</b>
<br><b>what happened. Since she couldn't offer any</b>
<br><b>explanation, I just shrugged it off as being strange.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I guess I still do, but I know I've had other strange</b>
<br><b>occurrences at that house, that I can't explain. Maybe</b>
<br><b>someone reading this can. More than 10 times, I've</b>
<br><b>woken up in the middle of the night, only to be</b>
<br><b>paralyzed. I couldn't speak, and I would always be in</b>
<br><b>a fetal position. It would always feel as though I was</b>
<br><b>being struck by lightening. After a min. or so I would</b>
<br><b>be able to move, which would leave me frightened and</b>
<br><b>very exhausted. Sleep would come to me almost</b>
<br><b>immediately. I've always just blew off the whole</b>
<br><b>experience as a position I had fallen asleep in, or</b>
<br><b>because I when I was 9 I was within three feet of</b>
<br><b>being struck by lightening...</b>

<p><b>Drug Store in California</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: DayMoore@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;California -- It's been six years since I worked as a CBS affiliate
reporter in Chico.&nbsp; Back then, I did a story on a drug store there,
just across from the main cemetary in town.&nbsp; If you call the chamber
of commerce, they will confirm the rumors and give you the exact name of
the drug store.&nbsp; The store is next to Bidwell Park, named after General
Bidwell.&nbsp; Management and employees have reported a young woman, possibly
native american, haunting the store -- particularly the stock room.&nbsp;
One long-time employee told me on camera that he once walked into the restroom,
placed his wallet, comb, loose change, etc. in a wad on the bathroom basin
(so that it would not fall out while he stepped into the stall).&nbsp;
When he came back out his items were missing.&nbsp; The bathroom door was
locked.&nbsp; He looked outside to see if any of his colleagues pulled
a prank and turned around to find all of his pocket contents neatly stacked
along the basin:&nbsp; coins stacked, comb alligned perfectly next to it,
wallet as well.&nbsp; Other employees reported hearing the woman whaling
in the rafters.</b>
<br><b>For what it's worth, the camera I was using inside the store kept
locking up as I tried to video tape the aisles and back room.&nbsp; And,
earlier that evening I had gone across the street to shoot video from the
cemetary (to give a ghostly perspective from a looming tombstone), although
the camera rolled none of it, other than the man's interview, was on the
tape when I returned to the station to edit.</b>
<br><b>The history, I'm told, is that the store sits upon the old gold
mining town's hanging tree.&nbsp; The woman (a native american)was involved
in a love trist between herself another native american and an american
soldier.&nbsp; She died after witnessing her lover's hanging.&nbsp; I can't
remember if all three of them were hanged.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Sonny Loved His Home</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Ruth71754@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>We bought our home in 1993 in Texas.&nbsp; The man we purchased the
house from had</b>
<br><b>built it for his second wife, unfortunately soon after they moved
in she was</b>
<br><b>diagnosed with cancer and died in the home.&nbsp; Soon after we
moved in strange</b>
<br><b>things happened, such as we would hear cars drive down our long
driveway and</b>
<br><b>the garage door opening.&nbsp; But, when we would check, no one
was there.&nbsp; One</b>
<br><b>evening, one of my twin daughters was watching TV in the living
room and all</b>
<br><b>of a sudden, the entertainment center door opened and the stereo
turned</b>
<br><b>itself on and began playing music. But the very latest "ghostly
happening,"</b>
<br><b>has really shocked us.&nbsp; The man who we bought the house from,
Sonny, sold it</b>
<br><b>because he was grieving himself to death over the loss of his beloved
spouse,</b>
<br><b>Doris.&nbsp; He bought another house a few blocks from us.&nbsp;
He very unexpectedly</b>
<br><b>died of a massive heart attack the following year, sometime in 1994.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Last year, we had a home security alarm system installed.&nbsp; The
past 3 nights</b>
<br><b>this week, our alarm system has gone off and shows "Trouble at front
door,"</b>
<br><b>yet when we check there's nothing amiss.&nbsp; Last night, as I
was cooking</b>
<br><b>dinner, my daughter walked her boyfriend out to his truck and she
came back</b>
<br><b>in the house and said, "look what was on our front porch in front
of the</b>
<br><b>door."&nbsp; It was a rusty key, partially caked with dry mud.&nbsp;
I thought maybe</b>
<br><b>her boyfriend had dropped it, but she said no, he hadn't.&nbsp;
As I'm cooking</b>
<br><b>dinner, she diligently cleaned the dried mud off the key and proceeded
to</b>
<br><b>stick it in the lock on our front door.&nbsp; This key, which looks
NOTHING like</b>
<br><b>the house keys we all carry, opened every door in our house, except
the</b>
<br><b>french doors we installed a couple of years ago ourselves.&nbsp;
None of us are</b>
<br><b>missing a house key, and the only extra key we have is in the utility
room,</b>
<br><b>and is still there.&nbsp; I made a comment that our "ghost" must
be trying to use</b>
<br><b>a key and I recalled how the alarm system inexplicably has been
sounding</b>
<br><b>around midnite for the past 3 nights!&nbsp; Well, last night, at
midnight the</b>
<br><b>alarm sounded again, it again showed "Trouble at front door," but
nothing was</b>
<br><b>found.&nbsp; When my husband and daughter went to the alarm system
to reset it,</b>
<br><b>they both noticed the carpet in front of the alarm system was very
cold as</b>
<br><b>compared to the carpet elsewhere!</b><b></b>
<p><b>This morning I was telling my little ghost story at work, and a friend
of</b>
<br><b>mine had the idea to check the Internet for Social Security Death
Records to</b>
<br><b>see if October 13, 1999, might have been a date of birth or date
of death of</b>
<br><b>either Sonny or Doris.&nbsp; However, it didn't match anything with
Doris or Sonny</b>
<br><b>and their last name, but I did recall that his "nickname" was Sonny,
his</b>
<br><b>birth name was Alexander, when I put in his first name as Alexander
and his</b>
<br><b>last name, lo and behold....Alexander "Sonny" died October 13, 1994,
the</b>
<br><b>strange rusty, mud caked key appeared on our front porch 5 years
to the day</b>
<br><b>that he passed away!</b><b></b>

<br><b>3 ghosts</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: bcseymour@email.msn.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have had three experiences with ghosts.&nbsp; I consider myself
a sensible</b>
<br><b>person, but I am convinced that ghosts are real even though I cannot
prove</b>
<br><b>their existence to anyone else.</b><b></b>
<p><b>#1.&nbsp; I offered to babysit for a co-worker's little girl one
evening, and the</b>
<br><b>mother and boyfriend left the Grand Rapids, Michigan house after
the little</b>
<br><b>girl was in bed and asleep.&nbsp; While they were gone, I decided
to wash their</b>
<br><b>dirty dishes because I was terribly bored now that the little girl
was in</b>
<br><b>bed.&nbsp; I was five months pregnant at the time.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I began to feel like I was being watched while I was in the kitchen,
and I</b>
<br><b>nervously peeked out all the windows and doors periodically, but
saw</b>
<br><b>nothing.&nbsp; Once the dishes were done, I decided to read books,
and went to</b>
<br><b>the living room to look at the bookshelves.&nbsp; I then heard footsteps
of</b>
<br><b>someone walking up stairs at the back of the house.&nbsp; There
were at least 8</b>
<br><b>footsteps, and they were loud.&nbsp; I thought "Great, they are
back early!"&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>ran to look out the back door, but saw that the steps and porch
were of</b>
<br><b>cement...and there were only four steps to the back porch.&nbsp;
The footsteps I</b>
<br><b>had heard were on wooden steps.&nbsp; I was very nervous and puzzled,
but</b>
<br><b>determined to get to the bottom of this mystery.&nbsp; I opened
the basement door</b>
<br><b>behind me and saw that the steps were wooden, but there was no-one
there.</b>
<br><b>The footsteps had definitely been coming up, not going down.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The family cat, Ernie, was in the kitchen and was calm and unruffled,
so I</b>
<br><b>decided that if Ernie could take it, so could I!&nbsp; I then went
to the living</b>
<br><b>room to read the book I had selected.&nbsp; I was too nervous to
go upstairs and</b>
<br><b>check on the little girl. While I sat in the living room, I felt
watched</b>
<br><b>again.&nbsp; I got the impression that there was great interest
in my unborn</b>
<br><b>child.&nbsp; This made me very angry, and I began to meditate that
a forcefield</b>
<br><b>of protection was formed around me, protecting me and my baby.&nbsp;
After this,</b>
<br><b>I was too anxious to read. I moved a chair to a corner of the room
and sat</b>
<br><b>there with Ernie the cat.</b><b></b>
<p><b>When the mother returned, I got out of there in a hurry.&nbsp; I
did not tell her</b>
<br><b>or her boyfriend of any of my experiences, because I thought they
would</b>
<br><b>think I was a nut.&nbsp; I did not drive down that street again
for fifteen</b>
<br><b>years.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Two months later, the woman asked to meet me for lunch, and she looked
like</b>
<br><b>hell.&nbsp; She wanted to know if I had experienced anything strange
while I was</b>
<br><b>at her house, and I said that I had indeed, but feared that she
would think</b>
<br><b>me crazy, so I had not said a thing.</b><b></b>
<p><b>She told me that they had been haunted right out of that house and
now were</b>
<br><b>living in a trailer about 40 miles north of there.&nbsp; The spirit
had floated</b>
<br><b>her daughter's body over her bed while she was asleep, knocked their
hats</b>
<br><b>off, thrown piles of books and papers on the floor, and cursed them.&nbsp;
They</b>
<br><b>had to have the house excorcised by a priest, and even then had
friends move</b>
<br><b>their belongings out. They never set foot in it again.</b><b></b>
<p><b>#2.&nbsp; I had my beloved old cat, Lion, put to sleep in my bedroom.&nbsp;
He hated</b>
<br><b>going to the vet clinic, and was almost dead of kidney failure,
so that</b>
<br><b>seemed the most humane alternative. For many months afterward, I
could feel</b>
<br><b>Lion sitting behind me on chairs.&nbsp; He loved to get behind me
and just lean</b>
<br><b>on me.&nbsp; It was very comforting, because I missed him terribly.&nbsp;
Finally one</b>
<br><b>day I saw him walk out of the bedroom and around the corner into
the living</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; I decided that I must be selfishly keeping him here.&nbsp;
I told him to</b>
<br><b>go on to whatever was next, and I would be with him again when I
got there.</b>
<br><b>I have not seen or felt him since.</b><b></b>
<p><b>#3.&nbsp; I went to the home of a friend who was renting an old farmhouse
in</b>
<br><b>Byron Center, Michigan.&nbsp; It was an interesting house, about
150 years old,</b>
<br><b>and he gave me tour.&nbsp; As we walked around the house, I felt
the prickly</b>
<br><b>hairs rise up on the back of my neck, and realized that I had experienced</b>
<br><b>that same feeling in the haunted house in Grand Rapids.&nbsp; I
turned to my</b>
<br><b>friend and blurted out, "Howard, is this house haunted?"</b>
<br><b>He looked surprised, and said, "Why, it's funny that you would ask,
but yes,</b>
<br><b>it IS haunted."&nbsp; And I said, "Well, I knew it, because I have
been in a</b>
<br><b>haunted house before, and I can feel something looking at me.&nbsp;
Do you know</b>
<br><b>anything about who or what this is?"</b><b></b>
<p><b>The house was previously owned by an old man who had become a widower,</b>
<br><b>became very depressed, and went out to the barn and hung himself.&nbsp;
Howard</b>
<br><b>said that when he first lived there, at times the doors opened and
footsteps</b>
<br><b>went by, as though an invisible person was walking through the house.&nbsp;
He</b>
<br><b>decided that whatever it was did not want to hurt him, so he ignored
it and</b>
<br><b>eventually it stopped.&nbsp; I told Howard that it was very interested
in me, and</b>
<br><b>that I had to go to the bathroom so we had to LEAVE, because I was
not going</b>
<br><b>to the bathroom with a ghost watching me.&nbsp; Howard thought this
was very</b>
<br><b>amusing, but we left. I never returned there.</b>
