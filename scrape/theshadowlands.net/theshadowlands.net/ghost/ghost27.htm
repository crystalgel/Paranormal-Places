<P>
<P><B>We are renting a house just outside of Binghamton NY.  We are only
the second occupants of this particular house.  Our landlord's young wife
died of cancer about 5 years ago, her name was AnnMarie.  This was their
dream house and they both loved it very much.  After her death, our landlord
was transferred and we took over living there.  We have seen and heard AnnMarie
numerous times, she did however pose a threat to us when we first moved in.
 About a month after we moved in, I happened to be away for a weekend so
my husband was alone in the house.   He planned on going out of town with
a friend.  He got up early to get ready and just as he was about to go down
the stairs, someone pushed him, causing him to fall.  He didn't get hurt.
 While in the car, my husband's friend asked if I had decided to stay home
that weekend because he had seen a woman come out of the front door and "float"
around to the back yard.  My husband told what had happened to him to his
friend.  Within the next week, both myself and my daughter were pushed at
the top of the stairs causing us to lose our balance and fall.  She must
have tried to scare us away from her house.  But since she has come to realize
that we plan on staying and are taking care of her house, she has not tried
to hurt us.  Other than that meeting, our encounters with AnnMarie have been
pretty mundane.  We hear her walking around the house at all hours.  She'll
open and close the front door, turn the TV and lights on and off, knock on
the walls.  She likes to play jokes on us by "hiding" something, usually
the TV remote.  When we can't find it, we'll ask her what she did with it
and later on it will be in plain sight.  She does scare the bejesus out of
our dog, Jack.  He'll look down the downstairs center hallway and run behind
the couch.  The cat, however, could care less.  She'll be on the bed with
us and all of a sudden she'll stare at the doorway and turn her head as if
following something or someone.  You always know when AnnMarie's around by
the scent of her perfume.  We've never been afraid of her, because this is
not the first time we've lived in a haunted house.  But, that's another
story.</B>

<H3><A NAME=one>One of My Experiences</A>
</H3><P><B>by grant@hpdc.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My wife, now "ex", bought this house in 1986, that is July, 1986. 
It</B>
<P><B>belonged to my wife's Grandmother, she was 103.  She had lived in
this</B>
<P><B>house for many years, but her last few years were in the nursing home.
</B>
<P><B>I beleive we agreed to buy the house sort out of a way to help the</B>
<P><B>"family" support Grandma.  The appraiser came through in the early
part</B>
<P><B>of June 1986.  I don't remember the exact day, but Grandma died that</B>
<P><B>evening.  Shortly after we moved in we began to notice that we were
not</B>
<P><B>alone.  My "ex" wife's daughter invited over a few of her friends for
a</B>
<P><B>sleep-over.  They had it in the basement because it was summer time
and</B>
<P><B>it was the coolest part of the house.  In the middle of the night one
of</B>
<P><B>the girls, I was told later, woke up and looked up the stairs and saw</B>
<P><B>some one standing there.  Another experience here was the sound of
boxes</B>
<P><B>being moved around in the attic. It was almost like some one was
looking</B>
<P><B>for something.  My own personal experience was one night I had gotten
up</B>
<P><B>to go to the bathroom.  I did not turn on the lights as I went off
to</B>
<P><B>the toilet.  As I approached the bath I thought I saw some one just
go</B>
<P><B>in.  So I waited outside to wait for the person to leave, I had hung</B>
<P><B>back into the shadows because I did not want to be seen as I did not</B>
<P><B>want to scare anyone.  I waited for what I guessed 7-8 min.  When I</B>
<P><B>realized that I heard no noise coming from the bathroom.  I eased up
and</B>
<P><B>around the corner to the bathroom and to my surprise the door was
open</B>
<P><B>and no one was there.  We had a few other minor experiences like the</B>
<P><B>cats would not come inside, but after about 5-6 months the occurences</B>
<P><B>became less and less to now they are now none existent.  The only way
I</B>
<P><B>can rationalize this is that Grandma came home for a while before she</B>
<P><B>move on.  I figure this because she knew this place and it was full
of</B>
<P><B>her memories, although we had moved most of it out by then.</B>
<P><B>     I hope you enjoy this story, I will try to write again, and then
I</B>
<P><B>will tell you about my ghost experience I had in Germany.</B>

<H3><A NAME=white>A White Apparition</A>
</H3><P><B>by loriw@mail.bright.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>This story that is as true as anything I know of happened VERY</B>
<P><B>recently. Tonight to get technical. To give you a bit of background
about my</B>
<P><B>house, there is a hill to the right side of my house which tends to
give my</B>
<P><B>friends a bit of a fright. I, on the other hand, have never been afraid
of</B>
<P><B>it. In fact it has always intrigued me.</B>
<P><B>        My friend Emily and I had been sitting in the house and had
gotten</B>
<P><B>bored. I had told her how my other friends had gotten scared of the
hill and</B>
<P><B>we decided to go up and jut goof off. At first we were joking around
and</B>
<P><B>laughing. As we got closer to the top of the hill, we quieted down
for some</B>
<P><B>unknown reason. We were looking into the woods which rests at the top
of the</B>
<P><B>hill and I saw a white figure. At first I thought it was just light
through</B>
<P><B>the trees then I realized that no light could get through them and
that no</B>
<P><B>light was that bright outside. I was wondering if it was my immagination
but</B>
<P><B>I looked to my friend and saw the look on her face........she had seen
it</B>
<P><B>too! When we blinked it seemed to fade and if we talked about it  it
seemed</B>
<P><B>to make itself more known. I think it's energy source was running low.
It</B>
<P><B>didn't seem to tale the image of a person really but it did seem to
bend</B>
<P><B>over and shrink just to get bigger again. We weren't sure if we were
just</B>
<P><B>seeing things so we went up 3 or 4 more times to verify what we saw
and that</B>
<P><B>we did see SOMETHING! Each and evry time it was still there. White
and glowing.</B>
<P><B>        This, however was not the first experience I had encountered
on that</B>
<P><B>hill!! For this story I must give you a bit of background also. My
boyfriend</B>
<P><B>had been telling me of an experience he had had. He was walking through
a</B>
<P><B>graveyard (yes I know it sounds corny but...) and he felt a prescence
and an</B>
<P><B>evil one at that. He didn't tell me much of what happened that night
and I</B>
<P><B>never really wanted to know. But one night we were on the phone and
he told</B>
<P><B>me that it was there w/ him and I asked him WHAT??? He said the ghost
from</B>
<P><B>the graveyard. He started to ignore it and it took his breath</B>
<P><B>away....literrally. I could hear him gasping for air. Later on he was</B>
<P><B>laughing at it and it made his heart stop. He swears that this is
true.</B>
<P><B>Finally he decided to go back to the graveyard.</B>
<P><B>        This is the night that my story happened. I was talking on
the phone</B>
<P><B>w/ him trying to get him not to go. My friend Heather was here and
she</B>
<P><B>wanted to use the phone. We had been telling her ghost stories and
she gets</B>
<P><B>frightened real easily. I dared her to go to the top of the hill and
she</B>
<P><B>wouldn't. So to prove that nothing was up there I went up and came
back</B>
<P><B>down. She was still on the phone so I decided to go back up. I got
to the</B>
<P><B>top and was standing there when I heard o footstep. I thought Heather
had</B>
<P><B>fnally gotten brave and came up. I turned around to find nothing there.
I</B>
<P><B>turned back around to the top of the hill. I heard the footsteps again.
This</B>
<P><B>time when I turned around I looked down to the ground and saw
indentions</B>
<P><B>that looked like footprints. I was sort of freaked out so I went down
and</B>
<P><B>made Heather get off the phone. I called my b/f and decided NOT to
tell him</B>
<P><B>anyhting that happened. After about 10 inutes he asked me if anything
weird</B>
<P><B>had happened and I asked him why he thought that and he replied that
he had</B>
<P><B>a wierd feeling that something wierd had happened. I told him my story
and</B>
<P><B>he said that the ghost had visited him again and was giving him insentive
to</B>
<P><B>come to the graveyard by letting him know that if he didn't come it
would</B>
<P><B>starrt going to the people he loved. </B>

<H3><A NAME=friend>Friend's Story</A>
</H3><P><B>by kwd2@dana.ucc.nau.edu </B>
<P>
<P><B>Although these stories didn't happen to me, I know they are true due
to </B>
<P><B>the fact that my best buddy Ken told me so. Ken and I have known each
</B>
<P><B>other since the first grade....We're 25yrs old now. He is not the person
</B>
<P><B>to lie about this stuff and especialy to me. In short Ken has never
lied </B>
<P><B>to me about anything....EVER!! We're both from an affluent neighborhood
</B>
<P><B>in No. VA. right outside of Washington D.C. In 1992 I moved to Arizona
</B>
<P><B>and he Moved to Las Cruses New Mexico. Now everyone knows that some
funky </B>
<P><B>happenings have happened in N.M.!!The most recent event occurred when
Ken </B>
<P><B>just moved in to a new place in town. Late one night he was awaken
by his </B>
<P><B>dog barking very loudly.( the dog slept in the same room as Ken) Ken
</B>
<P><B>looked in the direction that Dojie was barking and saw, in the bathroom
</B>
<P><B>doorway(The bathroon was also in the bedroom) a white figure, levitating
</B>
<P><B>about 3 feet of the ground. Ken told me looked at it for about 5 seconds,
</B>
<P><B>rubbed his eyes, then looked at it again for almost a full minute.
Scared </B>
<P><B>half to death Ken quietly spoke upand said," could you please go and
</B>
<P><B>leave me alone?".Then it disappeared. the next morning he brought it
up </B>
<P><B>with his new roommate (and soon to be girlfriend as things turned out)
</B>
<P><B>and she told Ken that about 3 years ago a fellow had hung himself in
the </B>
<P><B>bathroom. Yet, the figure never returned.Ken's older sister Becky (
also </B>
<P><B>a very dear frined of mine ) moved out to N.M. in 1993 and found work
</B>
<P><B>designing jewlery. In the X-mas of 1995, Ken and Becky decided to to
</B>
<P><B>travel X-country back to Virgina(a 2 and half day drive). On their
first </B>
<P><B>night of driving,they had an experience together. They were on a lonly
</B>
<P><B>two lane Texas highway about at 3 A.M. the reason they were on such
a </B>
<P><B>road is because they were heading N.E. towards I-40 after getting off
of </B>
<P><B>I-10. Anyway...they were trucking along and off in the distance and
</B>
<P><B>along the side of the road,they saw what was like a very bright spinning
</B>
<P><B>like a lighthouse. As they approached the light Ken slowed down to
a mere </B>
<P><B>10mph. Ken said there was an old house and in the second story window
</B>
<P><B>there was a very bright light circling. Now for the strange part. There
</B>
<P><B>was also a very unearthly buzz or humming sound that would rattle the
</B>
<P><B>windows of the truck when it passed their way. Both Ken and Becky told
me </B>
<P><B>they would never forget that sound as long as they live!!! Al the sudden
</B>
<P><B>both of them sensed extreme evil. Not just uneasiness but EVIL!! Then
</B>
<P><B>Becky started shouting" Just Go Ken Just Go Get out of here". Ken floored
</B>
<P><B>it and they both would look back to see this house off into the distance.
</B>
<P><B>About 5 miles later Ken saw a highway sign that read BLACK 20 miles.
In </B>
<P><B>BLACK, Ken and Becky got off the road and found a room and bedded down
</B>
<P><B>for the night. Fast Foward to Ken and Becky returning to N.M. from
VA. </B>
<P><B>they decided to go back the same way they came to see if this strange
</B>
<P><B>house existed.So they went back through Black, got on the same stretch
of </B>
<P><B>highway, and saw absolutly nothing but open fields for the next 75
</B>
<P><B>miles!! Now I've known this family for a long time and I know that
they </B>
<P><B>would never steer me wrong. and I believe their stories. Yet, I can't
</B>
<P><B>believe whole heartedly because nothing like this has ever happend
me. Am </B>
<P><B>I wrong to think this way? I don't think so, I think I'm being very
</B>
<P><B>practical. It would be like saying I love to ride roller coasters </B>
<P><B>although I'v never been on one. Thanks for reading E-mail if you
wish.</B>

<H3><A NAME=ball>Ghosts or Ball Lightning ?</A>
</H3><P><B>by simon@ace.net.au </B>
<P>
<P><B>I used to live in a very old house in a very old neighbourhood. My
bedroom</B>
<P><B>was on one side of the house and my windows opened up to a shade
house</B>
<P><B>outside. My little brother's room was directly across the hall and
his</B>
<P><B>windows opened out onto the driveway. </B>
<P>
<P><B>One night my little brother woke me up saying he had heard people
walking</B>
<P><B>up and down the driveway. He was about five at the time and used to
have a</B>
<P><B>lot of horrible nightmares, so I just assumed this was another one.
I told</B>
<P><B>him to get in my bed and sleep with me for the rest of the night. We</B>
<P><B>settled down, he was on one side of the bed facing the hallway and
I was on</B>
<P><B>the other facing the window which was probably only  two feet away.
It was</B>
<P><B>a very hot still Summer night and I had my windows wide open. All of
a</B>
<P><B>sudden a ball of light hovered at a relatively fast pace past my
window,</B>
<P><B>heading down into the shade house. I remember the feeling I got when
I saw</B>
<P><B>it-you know, the type where your stomach jumps into your mouth. At
first I</B>
<P><B>thought it was a torch beam but then I realised that apart from a few</B>
<P><B>comet-like tails, the white illuminescent light was contained in a
ball.</B>
<P><B>About seven seconds later, the ball came back in the opposite
direction,</B>
<P><B>but this time it hit one of my shutters and it banged shut. The ball
just</B>
<P><B>hovered in the one spot for a moment then flashed out. My brother jumped
up</B>
<P><B>because he had heard it and I pushed him up to my parent's room where
we</B>
<P><B>woke them up scared out of our wits.</B>
<P>
<P><B>That was eight years ago and I have since moved house, but every night
I</B>
<P><B>spent in that room I kept my windows locked and my blind down. I had
one</B>
<P><B>more experience with what I called the Shade House Ghost about two
years</B>
<P><B>ago but that's a different story. The weird part is this. For eight
years I</B>
<P><B>had to defend my story of seeing a ghost. Many people are interested
in</B>
<P><B>what I saw and a few have offered the intelligent explanation that
what I</B>
<P><B>saw was the natural yet rare phenomenon of ball lightening, yet the
only</B>
<P><B>inconsistency in that is  the light I saw was white-not firelight-my</B>
<P><B>brother admitted he heard the bang to everyone but denies it was a
ghost.</B>
<P><B>Then about two weeks ago my brother admitted for the first time ever
that</B>
<P><B>he too saw the image. The reason he didn't say anything was that he
says he</B>
<P><B>saw a dark figure move past my window, rather than a white one. Our
friend</B>
<P><B>told us that seeing a white, bright ghost is harmless (if not a bit
freaky)</B>
<P><B>whereas a dark silhouhette or figure brings darker consequences. If
what I</B>
<P><B>saw was ball lightening, then what did my brother see?</B>
<P>
<P><B>That was my first experience with the paranormal-I have many others,</B>
<P><B>especially concerning my brother little brother. These include
ghosts,</B>
<P><B>seances, UFOs and one with a lot of blood. I would very much like to
share</B>
<P><B>some more if possible. </B>

<H3><A NAME=cousin>My Cousin</A>
</H3><P><B>by goodfellas-106@webtv.net </B>
<P>
<P>
<P>  <B>my eight year old cousin died last year of a blood disorder.  She
was</B>
<P><B>my best friend in the whole wide world.  She lived next door to my</B>
<P><B>house.  Her bedroom window faced the front parking area, and was on
the</B>
<P><B>second floor.  It was a busy block, especially  at night.  My aunt
would</B>
<P><B>put my cousin ,Lindsay to bed by 8  pm every night.  She would then</B>
<P><B>climb out of bed and look out the window at everybody outside.  She
was</B>
<P><B>so cute as she stood there in her pajamas watching everyone.  One
night,</B>
<P><B>exactly one week after she died I went to the store and when I
returned</B>
<P><B>I looked up at her window expecting to see her as usual, and to my</B>
<P><B>surprise there she was in her pajamas waving at me.  I had to take
a</B>
<P><B>double look and when I looked back up she was still there.  I know
she</B>
<P><B>was only there in spirit, but from that day on I know she is around
me</B>
<P><B>no matter where I am.  We always made a pact to never leave one
another</B>
<P><B>and she is sticking to the deal.  I will always love her.</B>

<H3><A NAME=evil>The Evil Horned Cherub</A>
</H3><P><B>by FAAB@webtv.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>This is a story about an encounter I had at age 9, that still haunts
me.</B>
<P><B>I was sleeping in bed, while my parents where outside  on the stairs
of</B>
<P><B>our building. I awoke for some strange reason &amp; when I looked to
the</B>
<P><B>side of my bed at the floor, I saw something semi transparent red
rising</B>
<P><B>up through the floor, now I have to state that my room had no
windows,</B>
<P><B>so my room was pitch black. I was in shock, I couldn't move, all I
could</B>
<P><B>do was stare in total fright.  When the creature's body fully  came
up</B>
<P><B>from the floor, it was walking back &amp; forth on the floor, but its
steps</B>
<P><B>weren't solid, it would bounce like a balloon each step it took. The</B>
<P><B>creature was about 2 ft tall, its body round like a cherub, and it
had</B>
<P><B>small horns on the sides of its head. He continued pacing back &amp;
forth,</B>
<P><B>its strange 'cause he wouldn't look at me directly the whole time,
thank</B>
<P><B>God, I would've died of fright had he did. This continued a while
longer</B>
<P><B>&amp; then he suddenly disappeared, then I started to hear banging
on the</B>
<P><B>walls of my room, it was like a giant was banging, that's how loud
it</B>
<P><B>got, all I could do was hide &amp; pray it would go away under my bed</B>
<P><B>covers.  After a few minutes it did stop, and in my heart I knew it</B>
<P><B>wasn't a prank or my imagination, see, my Aunt had just bought the</B>
<P><B>apartment building &amp; the only ones living there was my family on
the 4th</B>
<P><B>floor &amp; my Aunt on the 1st, the rest of the apartments were being
fixed</B>
<P><B>for new renters. Besides my family is very conservative &amp; playing
pranks</B>
<P><B>is considered childish. The creature for 7 years would not let me
forget</B>
<P><B>him so easily, I would have 5 or 6 repetitive dreams with the
creature,</B>
<P><B>as well as experience levitation, I would be just about to fall asleep
&amp;</B>
<P><B>I would feel my body was floating, upon that realization I'd totally</B>
<P><B>awaken &amp; come crashing down on the bed. I stopped having dreams
&amp;</B>
<P><B>levitating at 16, I think it was because my aunt died that year &amp;
is</B>
<P><B>protecting me, I dream with her constantly. I feel her presence</B>
<P><B>sometimes &amp; am grateful for her love &amp; protection. I'd like
to hear from</B>
<P><B>those of you who've had similar experiences, so please e-mail me at
the</B>
<P><B>address above. Peace/Love  </B>

<H3><A NAME=ghost>Grandma's Ghost</A>
</H3><P><B>by jlcook@ccis.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>I've been reading the stories passed on by others and thought I would</B>
<P><B>share something that happened to me. But before I do, let me tell you
a</B>
<P><B>story my great grandmother told me. My mother's mom died when she was
5</B>
<P><B>years old so my great grandmother raised her and her brothers and</B>
<P><B>sisters. One day as she was sewing in her bedroom she said she felt</B>
<P><B>someone come into the room. She looked up and saw her daughter, my
mom's</B>
<P><B>mother, standing at the doorway staring at her. Before my</B>
<P><B>great-grandmother could do anything the ghostly visitor said, "Where
is</B>
<P><B>the baby?", by great-grandmother said, "She is playing in the
backyard".</B>
<P><B>As soon as she replyed, the ghost vanished. Shaken, and thinking she
was</B>
<P><B>seeing things, she thought she would go wash some dishes and get her</B>
<P><B>mind off of what had just happened. She had been washing dishes for</B>
<P><B>about 5 mins. when she felt someone enter enter the room. She turned
to</B>
<P><B>see her daughter back again. As soon as their eyes met her daughter
once</B>
<P><B>again said, "Where is the baby?". Thinking something was wrong, and</B>
<P><B>scared to death, my great-grandmother went to the back yard to check
on</B>
<P><B>the baby. When she got there, she found the yard empty and the gate</B>
<P><B>opened. She went looking for my mother and saw her walking towards
the</B>
<P><B>busy street near their house. She was able to catch her just before
she</B>
<P><B>walked out into the street. Years later, I was home visiting my
mother.</B>
<P><B>As I walked pasted the front room towards the kitchen to see my
mother,</B>
<P><B>out of the corner of my eye I saw a women sitting in the front room.
She</B>
<P><B>had shoulder length light colored hair and was wearing a black dress.
I</B>
<P><B>thought it was my sister in-law so I went on into the kitchen. I
talked</B>
<P><B>to my mother a few minuets then asked why Toni was sitting in the
front</B>
<P><B>room all by herself. My mother looked at me funny and told me that
Toni</B>
<P><B>was at work. I told her she was nuts and went to the front room to
get</B>
<P><B>her. When I got there, I found noone. Thinking she may have went</B>
<P><B>upstairs I searched for her and found noone. I told mom that I really</B>
<P><B>did see someone sitting in there. She asked what she looked like, I
told</B>
<P><B>her, and she said, "Oh, that was my Mother, before she died she told
me</B>
<P><B>she would always be near me." </B>
<P><B>I don't know if I saw her mother or not, but I DO KNOW I SAW SOMEONE
and</B>
<P><B>then they were GONE. I really did see them, I know I did!</B>
<P><B>Mom has since told me other stories of when her mother was around,
but</B>
<P><B>I'll have to pass those along some other time.</B>

<P>
<P><B>A few years ago, I set out a tape recorder to tape the "spring </B>
<P><B>sounds" in my isolated village for some listening pleasure in the depths
</B>
<P><B>of a cold winter. There was no breeze, there were no dogs or people
in </B>
<P><B>the house or anywhere around it. </B>
<P><B>	I went into my den to correct a batch of papers after I had set </B>
<P><B>the tape recorder on the concrete deck of my three-story house. After
at </B>
<P><B>least an hour I remembered that I had done so, and I went out to rewind
</B>
<P><B>the thing and listen to a couple of minutes of the tape.</B>
<P><B>	My first impression was that it must have taken me a long time </B>
<P><B>to walk from the deck to the office door--a distance of ten yards at
</B>
<P><B>most. Then I realized that the recorder had picked up throughout its
</B>
<P><B>45-minute length a very steady, unfrightening, but definite pattern
of </B>
<P><B>footsteps walking along the second-story porch. That porch is over
a </B>
<P><B>hundred feet long, and the sound intensified and diminished as the
</B>
<P><B>"walker" went from one end to the other. I had heard nothing in my
</B>
<P><B>completely silent room where I was doing my work, but the tape recorder
</B>
<P><B>had.</B>
<P><B>	Oddly enough, it was not in the least frightening or bizarre. </B>
<P><B>The steps were so completely natural and unhurried that they almost
</B>
<P><B>sounded comforting.</B>

<P>
<P> <B>I grew up in an old farmhouse in North Carolina.  I have always been
</B>
<P><B>"sensitive" to</B>
<P><B>paranormal activity.  This seems to run in the family.  Our house had
many </B>
<P><B>"visitors" that I always believed came from the old abandoned cemetary
in the </B>
<P><B>woods nearby.  I often could smell lavender sachet.  No one in my home
had it. </B>
<P><B> Sometimes I would here the piano play but when I would go in the room
where </B>
<P><B>it was,no one was there and the bench would be pushed under just as
it had </B>
<P><B>been.  One visitor liked to walk thru my room at night.  Sometimes
he(yes I </B>
<P><B>always felt this particular ghost was male) would hide things only
to put them </B>
<P><B>some place really obvious days later.  My sister who does not share
the family </B>
<P><B>gift always made fun of me.  My mother had no comment and my dad never
</B>
<P><B>experienced anything he couldn't explain. One weekend while I was away
at </B>
<P><B>college,my mom called and said that one of my friends was looking for
me.  I </B>
<P><B>asked which one and she said "The one that walks your room at night."
 Turns </B>
<P><B>out she had similar experiences to mine but just kept quiet about them.
 </B>
<P><B>   Fast forward about 7-8 years,I am in the Air Force,stationed in
Northern </B>
<P><B>California.</B>
<P><B>My husband and infant daughter move into a duplex.  I notice that the
baby is </B>
<P><B>covered in a blanket sometimes when I know I didn't cover her.  I also
have </B>
<P><B>the feeling I'm being watched when I step into the hallway.  The baby's
</B>
<P><B>pacifiers all would disappear and then reappear right where we had
left them.  </B>
<P><B>There were also toys that would play when no one had touched them.
 The major </B>
<P><B>event that happen one night was my husband woke me up and asked me
why I </B>
<P><B>pinched his butt.  I said didn't and to go back to sleep.  I rolled
over and a </B>
<P><B>couple of minutes later he jumped out of bed and yelled "Someone pinched
my </B>
<P><B>_ss!!"  He settled down and then the rabbit ears on the TV started
to move but </B>
<P><B>only one of them not the whole set and very deliberately was striking
the </B>
<P><B>wall.  My husband told whoever it was that he didn't care if they haunted
the </B>
<P><B>house but our bedroom was off limits.  It stopped and while activity
continued </B>
<P><B>it was more subdued.  When we moved into military housing we actually
missed </B>
<P><B>it.  Now that we live in military housing things are quiet but lately
I've </B>
<P><B>heard music coming from the living room at night after we go to bed
and just </B>
<P><B>the other day I was sitting on the couch in the middle of the afternoon
</B>
<P><B>watching TV when I heard someone say my name right next to me.  My
Yorkshire </B>
<P><B>Terrier heard it too because she woke up and jumped off her chair and
looked </B>
<P><B>all around the room.  Well I guess thats all I have for now.  If anything
else </B>
<P><B>developes I post it.  marysuehil@msn.com</B>

<H3><A NAME=skeptics>Skeptics' Haunting Stories</A>
</H3><P><B>by dorjan@mailbox.arn.net</B>
<P>
<P>     <B>I have believed in ghosts for as long as I can remember. I'm not
</B>
<P><B>sure why; I've never seen a ghost or had a major experience with any.
</B>
<P><B>I am an exception in my family. My mom thinks that the subject is </B>
<P><B>fascinating, but she really doesn't believe in them. My sisters have
</B>
<P><B>flat out ridiculed me for my belief in the supernatural. Funny thing
</B>
<P><B>is, all three of these skeptics have dealth with ghostly situations.</B>
<P><B>      One evening I was home alone with my sister Jamie. I was taking
</B>
<P><B>a nap in my room and she walked in to get something out of my closet.
</B>
<P><B>When she walked out she left the light on and the closet door open
</B>
<P><B>[I HATE having my closet door open!]. I yelled at her , half asleep,
</B>
<P><B>to come back and turn the light out and shut the door. The light went
</B>
<P><B>out and I said "Thank you". She yelled back, "For what? I didn't turn
</B>
<P><B>your light out!" I was like "Yeah, whatever". She insisted that she
</B>
<P><B>never touched it. She said she got halfway down the hall when the </B>
<P><B>light went out. Since I was mostly asleep when this happened, I </B>
<P><B>thought I was dreaming, but she reminded me when I woke up. </B>
<P><B>     My sister Jenny was in my room once after I moved out, and she
</B>
<P><B>saw a small cloud out the corner of her eye. She looked at it, </B>
<P><B>thinking my mom was burning incense in there, but there was no fire
</B>
<P><B>or source of smoke. It started to grow into a full-length apparition,
</B>
<P><B>and she freaked out and ran out of the room. I don't think she's seen
</B>
<P><B>anything since then.</B>
<P><B>     This is the best story! It was shortly before Halloween, and I
</B>
<P><B>had some Christmas lights hanging up in my room. They had burned out
</B>
<P><B>and I hadn't taken them down yet. I remember I had them unplugged.
</B>
<P><B>One morning, I got up really early for school, and nobody else was
up </B>
<P><B>yet. I went to get breakfast and when I came back to my room, the </B>
<P><B>lights were plugged in AND they were working! I thought that was </B>
<P><B>really strange, but it gets better. </B>
<P><B>     That same day, I was on the phone with a friend all evening. It
</B>
<P><B>was really cold out. Suddenly, my mom comes into my room, looking </B>
<P><B>freaked out. She asked, "You weren't just outside, were you?" I said
</B>
<P><B>"Hell, no. It's freezing out there. Why?"  She told me that she had
</B>
<P><B>been in the kitchen doing dishes when she heard a knock on the back
</B>
<P><B>door. She turned around and saw "me" looking at her through the </B>
<P><B>window of the door. She thought it was weird for me to be out there
</B>
<P><B>because it was cold, and she didn't think I was out there in the </B>
<P><B>first place. She went to the door to let me in and suddenly , I </B>
<P><B>wasn't there. She walked around outside looking for me , but there
</B>
<P><B>was no sign of anyone having been there. Mom swears to this day that
</B>
<P><B>it was me she saw out there. You have to understand that there was
</B>
<P><B>nobody in my neighberhood that even remotely resembled  me. But there
</B>
<P><B>"I" was, smiling at her.</B>
<P><B>     She doesn't know what to think of it. She's still skeptical </B>
<P><B>about ghosts and stuff. If anyone has any idea about what it was that
</B>
<P><B>she saw, please let me know. We had a theory that it was my </B>
<P><B>Doppelganger, because later that year, she sent me on an errand in
</B>
<P><B>which I was almost killed. It wasn't just an accident, though. I just
</B>
<P><B>happened to NOT be driving my Fiat, which would've been smashed like
</B>
<P><B>a sardine can in the accident I was in. And I just happened to put
on </B>
<P><B>my seat belt, which I never wore, at the last minute. The police said
</B>
<P><B>that had I not been wearing it, I would've been killed. Maybe we're
</B>
<P><B>reading too much into it, but that's the only thing we have managed
</B>
<P><B>to come up with. </B>

<H3><A NAME=campus>Big Ghosts On Campus</A>
</H3><P><B>by dorjan@mailbox.arn.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was reading some of these stories about ghosts on campus, and </B>
<P><B>I wanted to share a few of my own. I used to attend West Texas A&amp;M
</B>
<P><B>University here in Canyon, Texas. That is where these stories take
</B>
<P><B>place. There are many stories, and I don't know what's myth and what
</B>
<P><B>isn't, so I'm telling the ones that personally happened to people I
</B>
<P><B>know.</B>
<P><B>     I was an Art major, and we didn't have a professor in our </B>
<P><B>Drawing class one day. Instead of leaving, most of us stayed so we
</B>
<P><B>could get caught up on our projects. Somehow, we got to talking about
</B>
<P><B>ghosts, and people who normally don't talk to anyone else were </B>
<P><B>telling their stories. The best one was from a girl we called </B>
<P><B>"Seely". She was from somewhere in the far East, and no one could </B>
<P><B>pronounce her actual name. She was living in a dorm once that is </B>
<P><B>already legendary on campus for being haunted. One evening, Seely </B>
<P><B>laid on her bed resting while her roommate stood at the door, talking
</B>
<P><B>to somone in the hallway. Suddenly, Seely felt paralyzed. An </B>
<P><B>apparition of a  girl with blonde hair came up head first from </B>
<P><B>under her bed [When she demonstrated for us how the figure came up,
</B>
<P><B>it gave me major chills]. The "girl" hovered there and said angrily,
</B>
<P><B>"You need to go home, now!" The ghost also called her by her full </B>
<P><B>name, which was strange, because, like I said, no one knew how to </B>
<P><B>pronounce it! Seely couldn't move or scream for her roommate's </B>
<P><B>attention until the ghost disappeared</B>
<P><B>     Another sory came from my friend Lena, who lived in another </B>
<P><B>dorm. One evening, she and her roommate were out driving on the </B>
<P><B>highway when  they passed by a house with a barn out in back. There
was </B>
<P><B>nothing seemingly special about the house, but they found themselves
</B>
<P><B>drawn to it, especially the barn. They circled around and drove by
</B>
<P><B>the house twice more. The third time, they "felt" that someting had
</B>
<P><B>left the barn and entered the car. They blew it off until things </B>
<P><B>started happening in their dorm. Just regular haunting stuff, like
</B>
<P><B>things disappearing, and feeling someone sit on the bed when there
</B>
<P><B>was no one there. At first the ghost seemed friendly, and it even </B>
<P><B>followed them when they went home one weekend. Then one time, one of
</B>
<P><B>them was in the bathroom, alone. She felt someone watching her, so
</B>
<P><B>she looked under the stalls and in the showers. There was no one </B>
<P><B>there. She was brushing her teeth and when she looked into the </B>
<P><B>mirror, she noticed two eyes peeping at her through a shower curtain!
</B>
<P><B>But when she turned around there still was nobody there. Pretty soon,
</B>
<P><B>they decided to pack up and get the hell out of Dodge. As they were
</B>
<P><B>walking down the stairs to go stay at a friend's house, something </B>
<P><B>pushed them just enough to make them stumble. When they turned </B>
<P><B>around, of course, there wasn't anyone around!.</B>

<H3><A NAME=my>My Story</A>
</H3><P><B>by twisted@itis.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>Okay, first off I would like to say that most of my story takes place
in my house but not all.  I never even thought about ghosts until we moved
into this house about 6 or 7 years ago.  I'm 15 now, so I was pretty little
when we moved in here and had no reason to make up such stories.  I'm not
sure I can remember everything in order but here goes.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My parents bought this house from a retired couple that tried to back
out of the deal at the last minute.  The papers were all ready signed so
we got the house anyway.  The man was still reluctant to leave.  They had
always been a nice couple but the woman always had a soft spot of children.
 A few weeks after we moved in my mother and I were in the basement (it's
finished) and I was crying about something so my mother went upstairs to
get me a glass of water.  We had two book cases (side by side) next to the
stairs towards the end.  My mother had been up there for a while so I looked
toward the stairs.  Finally, I heard and saw her start to come down.  All
I saw at first was bare legs and I figured that she had changed into shorts.
 I waited and waited for her to finish coming down the stairs but she never
got past the bookcases.  I called to her and she was still in the kitchen
(doing who knows what) and hadn't changed and hadn't come down the stairs
at all.  I'm pretty sure (and some don't believe me because I was upset and
crying) that it was the old woman who had lived in the house before because
a couple of days after that we found out that she had died that day.  Maybe
she heard me crying and decided to help, we'll never know.</B>
<P>
<P><B>As children often do, I had two friends that were (to me at least)
the best, best friends I could ever have.  One day we were playing outside
in the park across the street and I looked in the kitchen window.  I was
home alone (I don't remember when this happened or how old I was) so I figured
I would see nothing.  I was wrong.  The kitchen light was on and there was
man wearing a red shirt staring out the window at me.  I freaked out and
me and my friends went closer to the house and they saw him too.  I thought
that maybe there was a burglar in the house and so they went and told their
dad who was nice enough to take a look through the house.  No body was in
there and we had made sure that we kept watch so that he didn't leave.  I
saw him staring out a few more times on different dates after that and I'm
sure it was a ghost.</B>
<P>
<P><B>By the time I was in 5th grade any friend that had been in my house
knew about the strange noises and things that went on.  One day, I was home
alone reading a book in the living room and I heard a strange noise in the
kitchen.  The way our house is the living room and kitchen are right next
to each other with out a wall separating, just a wood counter my grandpa
built.  I looked over toward the kitchen but I could see nothing so I put
my book down and inched my way over to the love seat that sat right behind
the counter in the living room.  I looked over the counter and all I saw
was a hand opening and closing a cubert door.  I ran out of the house and
later came back with my friends and we found nothing.  I then made a new
friend who came over once for the first time.  She didn't know any of my
friends at the time and I hadn't told her about the strange happenings. 
I went out side to get my dog in and when I cam back she told be never to
leave her alone in the house again because she heard a strange opening and
closing of a door in the kitchen.  I went in and open and closed all the
cubert doors except the one.  It didn't sound like any of them to her.  When
I tried the one I saw the hand on she said "That's it".  I knew then that
I hadn't imagined the hand at all.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When my sister went off to college, I slept in her room quite a bit.
 One night I woke up and there was an old woman sitting on a chair staring
at me and knitting.  I got really scared and covered up my head with the
cover thinking it would make her go away.  It did and I figured it was a
dream.  The next night I woke up and a tall man dressed like up and he was
gone again.  I later learned that my mother had not taken him out and she
found him in the hallway that morning and had put him in my room.  The only
thing I can come up with is that the adult ghosts have been letting the cat(s)
in and out of my room at night.</B>
<P>
<P><B>This one is one that is not about me.  My mother woke up in the middle
of the night to find a woman  staring down at her, she disappeared and my
mother went back to sleep thinking she was dreaming.  The weird thing about
this is that that brought back memories of a lady keeping watch over me.
 </B>
<P>
<P><B>I know this is long and there is a ton more to tell but my fingers
and my brain are tired.  I'm so used to the strange things that they don't
bother me anymore but if I listen carefully I still hear them.  they are
playful ghosts though.  They like to move our things around so that we search
all over the house to find them.  They turn lights and hair dryers  on and
off all the time.  And every once and a while when I'm down and mad at my
parents I'll feel a hand rubbing my back.  It's cold but it helps.  I don't
like it very much when they pull my hair though.  =)</B>

<H3><A NAME=mine>Mine Ghost</A>
</H3><P><B>by JEM4BABES@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hello, my name is Aaron. I live in South Carolina. My grandparents
have had</B>
<P><B>a number of paranormal things happen to them, but I am just going to
tell</B>
<P><B>you about one. My grandfather's uncle ( Uncle Jed ) had a mine that
he had</B>
<P><B>owned for quite a long time. He would go day after day to his mine
and work.</B>
<P><B>He would mosty find copper and silver, but every once and a while he
would</B>
<P><B>find specks of gold dust. Rarely would he ever find nuggets. One night,
while</B>
<P><B>he was in bed it began to rain. He remembered that when he had left
his mine</B>
<P><B>it was sunny, so he did not cover it up. He got up and woke the whole
house-</B>
<P><B>hold up with him. He told them that he was going to go cover up his
mine and</B>
<P><B>would be only gone for 30 minutes or so. He left with only the support
of a</B>
<P><B>raincoat and lantern. It had been two hours and he had not returned
from</B>
<P><B>covering up his mine. Years later at night his sister saw a faint light
coming </B>
<P><B>up from the woods, it would jump on top of the house hit the window
and</B>
<P><B>disappear. After studying this they concluded that the light was the
lantern</B>
<P><B>that Uncle Jed was carrying when he left. Could it be his ghost trying
to</B>
<P><B>get back in his house? Could be.</B>

<H3><A NAME=2>2 Stories</A>
</H3><P><B>by jms8@lehigh.edu </B>
<P>
<P><B>It somehow seems that certain places in this world are centers for</B>
<P><B>paranormal activity.  I believe that one of these active places is</B>
<P><B>Bradford, PA, my home.  Bradford is an old oil boom town that has
since</B>
<P><B>died.  It has some ghost legends and whatnot, but I am not speaking
of</B>
<P><B>those.  I am speaking of two personal experiences.  By the way, I am
not</B>
<P><B>John, I am his friend, Jill, I am just using his account.  I live in
a</B>
<P><B>house that had parnormal activity once that has now, thankfully,</B>
<P><B>disappeared.  The last appearance of the ghost in my house happened
when</B>
<P><B>I was about 4 years old, so I cannot possibly provide a reliable
account</B>
<P><B>on that.  The people who lived in my house before me complained of</B>
<P><B>seeing "strange things," and moved out.  When we moved in, the ghost</B>
<P><B>apparently floated in one window, stood there for a moment, then left</B>
<P><B>forever.  It was a woman who had lived in my house previously and had</B>
<P><B>died in my living room.  We like to think she was just checking for
the</B>
<P><B>right people to live in her house, and being satisfied, left it</B>
<P><B>forever.  The next story is something different.  A friend of mine
lived</B>
<P><B>in a very old house, far older than mine... but the paranormal</B>
<P><B>occurences were recent.  Another friend and I were sitting on the bed
in</B>
<P><B>one bedroom while the girl who lived there began to explain the
history</B>
<P><B>of her house and her experiences.  She said that she once saw the
figure</B>
<P><B>of a black cat ready to pounce on her from a dresser, and she turned</B>
<P><B>away quickly to protect her face.  When she turned back, it was gone.
</B>
<P><B>Further, she spoke about the occupants before her family.  The son
had</B>
<P><B>died in a skateboarding accident, and upon hearing of the death of
her</B>
<P><B>brother, the sister committed suicide.  She was not living at home
at</B>
<P><B>the time.  One story says she slit her wrists, another story says
that</B>
<P><B>she walked off a cliff out in California.  With both of his children</B>
<P><B>dead, the father hung himself in the attic.  The friend who lived
there</B>
<P><B>said she thought she saw the apparition of the rope hanging from a</B>
<P><B>rafter in her attic from the window in the next house.  I cannot
attest</B>
<P><B>to any of that, this is all background information.  What I can
attest</B>
<P><B>to is this:  as she explained the story, her bedroom door was
partially</B>
<P><B>open.  From the bed, my other friend and I could see the door knob
from</B>
<P><B>the outside very clearly.  We were just into high school, so the
junior</B>
<P><B>high carry-over of those silly "Do Not Disturb" signs was present on
the</B>
<P><B>inside of the door knob.  Her whole family was downstairs.  As she</B>
<P><B>spoke, her door knob began to shake violently back and forth for
about</B>
<P><B>fifteen or twenty seconds.  One sign on the inside of the door spun</B>
<P><B>around and around.  There was no hand there.  My friend and I grabbed</B>
<P><B>each other and just SCREAMED.  That goes down in history as one of
the</B>
<P><B>scariest moments of my life.  I have a friend in the Poconos who is
very</B>
<P><B>into going out and looking to meet up with ghosts.  I can't
understand</B>
<P><B>that mentality.  My view is to leave them alone, and hopefully they
will</B>
<P><B>do the same.</B>

<H3><A NAME=father>My Father's Experiences</A>
</H3><P><B>by 14bugs@ctg.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>hello, i am a sceptic but this story i am about to tell is about my</B>
<P><B>father who is 66 years of age and is a retired seargeant of the army.
</B>
<P><B>my father was born and raised in baltimore maryland, to be specific,
in </B>
<P><B>Hollandtown.  He is a very tough and serious guy but one day he told
me</B>
<P><B>many years before, of a home he used to live in in the early 1930's.
 he</B>
<P><B>can not exactly remember where the hiuse is today, but he remembers
the</B>
<P><B>horror's he went through when he was young.  he recalls one night</B>
<P><B>sitting at the dinner table when someone knocked at the door.  it was</B>
<P><B>the only door onn the front of the home and it led down a long
stairway</B>
<P><B>down into the street. they were sitting at the table when a knocking</B>
<P><B>appeared to be heard at this door, my father's older brother stood
up in</B>
<P><B>a matter of seconds and opened it, but yet nothing was there.  so
tthe</B>
<P><B>older brother sat down and started to eat when it came again.  he
sprung</B>
<P><B>up even faster, opened the door, and still nothing there.  what could
it</B>
<P><B>be?  nothing on this earth could knock on a door and run 40 steps
down</B>
<P><B>into the street without beeing seen. well unless you were the flash.</B>
<P><B>other occurences are said as being no animals would come into the
house.</B>
<P><B>my father wanted to purchase a puppy, but when he got it home, it
went</B>
<P><B>berserk! and would not come in.  the puupy was given away.  in some</B>
<P><B>rooms in the house, lights and candles would not burn. a plumber came</B>
<P><B>into the home to repair a pipe, but when he went to get his
flashlight,</B>
<P><B>it wouldn't work.  candles were tried, but they kept going out. some</B>
<P><B>parts of the home my father could not stand to be in. he said the
room</B>
<P><B>would seem as if it were to be looking at you.  and sometimes rooms</B>
<P><B>would have eerie chills, in the summertime. strange knocks, chills,
and</B>
<P><B>other strange feelings of dread,were always present in the house, or
so</B>
<P><B>it seems. they moved away when my father was still young but he can</B>
<P><B>recall all counts of wahat happened to him at a very young age.</B>

<H3><A NAME=visit>Mom's Visit</A>
</H3><P><B>by lisa.allister@snet.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>About three year's ago my mom passed away she had been very sick for
some time now and ended up in the hospital due to this, a couple of weeks
before she died my family was summoned to the hospital by the doctor's to
sign a form to state that if my mother had gone into arrest we did not want
her to be revived, well we did so we did not want her to be revived because
we know that she had gone through enough pain during her sickness already
and is was just better to let her go.  Well a few weeks after we signed these
papers she passed away it was a few day's after Christmas I remember a friend
had spent the night over  my house and in the morning she got up around five
in the morning to go to work, well a few minutes later I heard a knock on
the door I thought that maybe it was my friend and maybe she had left something
behind as I went to the door to open it the person just walked right in ,without
me even opening the door what I will tell you next might shock youI stood
there looking at this person there stood an image no face kind of greyish
and transparent, I tried to communicate with this person still not too clear
about what was going on almost like in a trance.  At that point the being
began to kind of guide me to the bed that was then on the living room floor,
the person and I laid down on the bed I at that point did not feel any type
of fear I felt more like tranquil and safe, we laid there and drifted off
to sleep.  I told my sister about this the nextday she said the same thing
I was thinking that it was my mother coming to see me one last time, you
see I was the person who took care of here when she became ill before her
hospital stay I guess I should be glad she came to see me ( I am).</B>

<H3><A NAME=wally>Wally</A>
</H3><P><B>by ernestom@thor.webpromote.com </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>When I was 13, something happened before</B>
<P><B>my eyes and I, to this day, cannot explain how it happened. One of
my best</B>
<P><B>friends from my  Bulverde, Texas, middle school had died near my ranch
from</B>
<P><B>a car crash. Wally and his dad died in the crash. The Jetta fell off
an</B>
<P><B>embankment one foggy morning when his dad was driving him to school.
It was</B>
<P><B>sad because I was picked on a lot because I did not speak English</B>
<P><B>(Portuguese). Wally was one of the few who would be my friend and
hang</B>
<P><B>around with me. </B>
<P><B>He lived about 3 miles from my house. And the land still at this time
is</B>
<P><B>sparcely populated. Anyway, when I learned of his death, I was sad
because</B>
<P><B>he was not going to hang out with me and I was going to get picked
on more</B>
<P><B>by the bully kids.</B>
<P><B>Ok, anough chit chat. Here's what happened:</B>
<P>
<P><B>My room in my house had a huge sliding glass door window for a window.
No</B>
<P><B>curtains until after this happened. My brother and I shared rooms.
Then one</B>
<P><B>(typical) night in the summer during a violent thunder storm, I awoke
to</B>
<P><B>the thunder from a lightning bolt that struck the power generator near
my</B>
<P><B>room. I had never heard something so loud in my life. Oh, and it was</B>
<P><B>raining harder than ever. Windy too. So then, after my brother
started</B>
<P><B>crying (he was 7) from the scary environment, the unimaginable happened.
I</B>
<P><B>told him that it would be ok (my parents were on their way from my
mom's</B>
<P><B>English class at the local high school). I was looking at my little</B>
<P><B>brother, when something caught the corner of my eye. It was
distinctevly</B>
<P><B>Wally (heart's racing right now). He stood there looking through the
window</B>
<P><B>with his hands cropped over his face to eliminate the glare from the</B>
<P><B>outside. It was if I had lived in suspended animation. After he had
made</B>
<P><B>eye contact with me, he smiled, waved, made an ok sign with his hand,
and</B>
<P><B>walked off into the woods. He was happy or so it seemed. And out of
no</B>
<P><B>where,  heard my parent's car arriving at the driveway.</B>

<H3><A NAME=kacey>Kacey</A>
</H3><P><B>by MoonTears@msn.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>I'm 21 now and as far back as I can remember I've had strange experiences,
but </B>
<P><B>first let me tell you about Kacey.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>My parents moved into the house on Fenton Way in Arvada Colorado before
I was </B>
<P><B>born.  They immediately felt at home in it and welcome.  However, from
the </B>
<P><B>time I can remember I was scared of going downstairs alone.  Our house
was a </B>
<P><B>bi-level, when you walked in the front door you were on the landing
and could </B>
<P><B>go upstairs or downstairs, where my brothers and I had our rooms. 
Again from </B>
<P><B>the time I can remember we always slept on the floor of my parents
room.  It </B>
<P><B>was just a natural for us.  I'm the only on that ever saw Kacey and
believe me </B>
<P><B>it scared the beejeebee's outta me.  Everyone in the room was asleep
but I was </B>
<P><B>awake.  I remember trying to count all the way up to 100 (I was in
first grade </B>
<P><B>at the time) when my dad left his bed to go to the bathroom.  After
he left I </B>
<P><B>saw a "shadow" only it was so dense and black.  He just materialized
from a </B>
<P><B>space right above the middle of the bed.  He seemed to be looking around
the </B>
<P><B>room making sure everone was okay when I gasped I geuss and his head
turned </B>
<P><B>toward me.  I saw a white eye.  In a heart beat it disappeared.  I
decided I'd </B>
<P><B>better go to sleep if stuff like THAT happenes when you stay up at
night.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I found out later from my parents that a man by the name of Kacey had
died </B>
<P><B>there.  He had a heart attack in his sleep.  In fact, his wife was
the one who </B>
<P><B>sold it to my parents.  They were a young couple who had a few young
children </B>
<P><B>and his death was quiet a shock to everyone.  Including it seems
Kacey.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Strange things were a common occurance at our house.  Like other stories
I </B>
<P><B>have read, things would disappear then  mysteriously be right in front
of you. </B>
<P><B> We finnally just calked it up to Kasey and when things went missing
we'd say </B>
<P><B>"Kasey, give it back!" and low and behond before us would be whatever
was </B>
<P><B>taken.  He was also fond of cause the washer and dryer to go on and
off </B>
<P><B>whenever he felt like it.  He seemed only to get upset when we dicussed
</B>
<P><B>moving.  A glass bowl full of salt was on the stove one night as my
family and </B>
<P><B>some friends we discussing moving when it burst into flames.  The stove
was </B>
<P><B>cold as stone.  Pots and pans would tumble from cabinets and we had
the </B>
<P><B>dickens of a time keeping the globe lighting fixter to stay over the
light.  </B>
<P><B>We'd screw it so tight the glass would threaten to break and an hour
later </B>
<P><B>hear it clattering around in the bathroom.  We finally left the globe
off it.  </B>
<P><B>This happend from at least 1975 to October 28 1986.  That was the day
our </B>
<P><B>house burned out.  When it was finally repaired and we moved back in
everyone </B>
<P><B>noticed the constant warmth and secerity we gone.  It seems Kasey had
finally </B>
<P><B>gone on.</B>
<P>
<P><B>As for other experences while I was living with my family on Gunter
AFB in </B>
<P><B>Alabama strange things occured.  While walking with my friend down
a back </B>
<P><B>street near the Gunter Bowl, a large parade ground, I saw out of the
corner of </B>
<P><B>my eye what looked like a man dressed in a kaki navel uniform walking
down </B>
<P><B>some stairs.  He had blond hair and seemed pretty young.  When I turned
my </B>
<P><B>head to look at the stairs there was no man and no stairs leading from
that </B>
<P><B>side of the building.  I told this to my friend and she is the one
that </B>
<P><B>informed me oh so calmly that what we see from the corners of our eyes
is a </B>
<P><B>glimse through the "veil" if you will.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Our house was one of the newer structers.  I'd felt things since we
moved in </B>
<P><B>but didn't concern myself with  it.  Things like footsteps in the hallway
</B>
<P><B>walking past my room, my dog constantly walking through the house at
night </B>
<P><B>"patroling", seeing what I always thought was my little brother walking
around </B>
<P><B>in the other room.  I'd be pissed because he was trying to scare me
or just </B>
<P><B>curious as to why he was up since the shadow was his hight, about 5'10".
 I'd </B>
<P><B>walk down to his room and there he'd be sound asleep.  I'd even test
to see if </B>
<P><B>he was faking or not but he was always in a very deep sleep and was
annoied as </B>
<P><B>you can imagine with my waking him.  When our neighbor's moved out
the </B>
<P><B>activity increased dramatically.  Our house was a duplex and when the
</B>
<P><B>neighbors moved everything increased.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>This experence was the most disturbing.  The computer faced a wall
in the </B>
<P><B>living room on which hung a huge mirror.  I was typing when I felt
someone </B>
<P><B>close to my back.  I didn't feel cold, on the contrary I felt what
seemed the </B>
<P><B>heat of someones body close to my back. I assumed it was my dad as
he LOVES to </B>
<P><B>scare the hell out of us all at any ungaurded moment. When I turned
around to </B>
<P><B>tell him something the words already leaving my mouth....No one was
there.  </B>
<P><B>For awhile this continued until new neighbor's moved in.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I was discussing just this with my father when he told me he'd seen
heard and </B>
<P><B>felt the same things but though he was the only one.  He told me after
he'd </B>
<P><B>experenced it for awhile he was looking at an old map of Gunter and
come to </B>
<P><B>find out the new housing was built on the old Air strip that was used
for </B>
<P><B>training around WWII.  There were alot of crashed and deaths as aircraft
was </B>
<P><B>refined.  Needless to say, the air crews and piolet roam freely around
there.  </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Only twice did I experience evil, and I DO know what it feels like,
as I will </B>
<P><B>relate to you later, in that house.  Both times it was in my room and
both </B>
<P><B>times I didn't question my instinct to LEAVE the room.  I'd return
hours later </B>
<P><B>and all was well.</B>
<P>
<P><B>These we "haunted houses" meaning that the spirits were linked to those
</B>
<P><B>particular spots.  I have also been the recipient of a personal haunting.
 </B>
<P><B>These are diffrent.  This is how it all came about and as long as it
lasted.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was 9 years old 2 very significant things happened in my life.
 Number </B>
<P><B>one: I died.  I know it sounds loony but I remember being terribly
ill and one </B>
<P><B>night I was sitting on the ceiling of my hospital room.  Anyway, after
that I </B>
<P><B>had the misfortune, months later, to touch a OUJI board.  ( personally
I think </B>
<P><B> those are the evilist things around!)  I was over at a friends house
playing </B>
<P><B>when she pulled out the board.  I'd heard about them and thought it'd
be cool </B>
<P><B>to contact someone from the other side.  We were in the living room
with her </B>
<P><B>mother and grandmother and we sat on the floor and started.  We were
fooling </B>
<P><B>around at first, pushing it this way and that and then decided to get
serious. </B>
<P><B> As we were waiting the pointer started to move and I felt a darkness
in the </B>
<P><B>room.  I looked at her and acussed her of moving it.  She lifted her
hands and </B>
<P><B>mine weren't touching it.  It continued to move.  I then felt like
my body was </B>
<P><B>cover with some fould substance like tar, something that I couldn't
get off </B>
<P><B>and the room by degrees was growing dark though the lights we still
on.  No </B>
<P><B>one else seem to notice this, why, I don't know.  I jumped up and told
her I </B>
<P><B>had to go.  For weeks I felt like I was dirty, not physically, but
dirty, </B>
<P><B>touched by evil.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>About a year later we moved to a small town in Iowa.  Only I seemed
to be </B>
<P><B>tormented.  I'd wake up at night paralized and terrified.  I'd feel
like I was </B>
<P><B>being sucked into a black hole and fight it.  If I moved any part of
my body </B>
<P><B>whatever it was seemed to let go, but it was hard as hell trying to
move.  </B>
<P><B>When I'd be exsausted from fighting this force and it would happen
again I'd </B>
<P><B>give into it.  I was to the point where I couldn't stand not sleeping
and </B>
<P><B>figured i'd just give up, anything to sleep.  When I did, my pillow
burst into </B>
<P><B>flames.  Somehow I moved and looked around me and nothing had happened
but I'd </B>
<P><B>seen the falmes and felt the heat.  Through the next 4 years, from
'88 to '91, </B>
<P><B>I only got a good restful sleep the month I had mono.  I became an
isomniact </B>
<P><B>and needless to say had very poor health.  And still this tormenting
</B>
<P><B>continued.  We finally moved to another state.  The iccidents followed
me.  I </B>
<P><B>never though it was the houses but I'd hope I'd be fine.  I wasn't.
 I was </B>
<P><B>watching the 3 channels we had in the booneys late one night and the
700 club </B>
<P><B>came on.  Now, I was raised Catholic and believe in God, but I'm not
into </B>
<P><B>watching Evangilists.  I stayed tune because the subject was about
hauntings.  </B>
<P><B>I learned then how evil OUJI boards were and relized I'd been living
with the </B>
<P><B>results of that fateful night for over 7 years.  Then they, the
evangilists, </B>
<P><B>said to say this prayer with them.  I did.  With all my heart and soul.
 And </B>
<P><B>it stopped.  I was hesitent to believe it at first, caustious, sleeping
with </B>
<P><B>the lights on, door opened as I had since I was 9.  After the first
6 months I </B>
<P><B>could sleep with the lights off.  After a year I could sleep with the
door </B>
<P><B>closed and in complete darkness.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I still have the faint twinges of these hauntings but they are just
nightmares </B>
<P><B>now.  Once in awhile I'll get the feeling somethings not right but
it has </B>
<P><B>nothing to do with the hauntings, it has to do with my nature of predicting
</B>
<P><B>things and knowing things.  Now I can deal with it though.  I also
have now a </B>
<P><B>hightened awareness of evil.  Not too long ago my mother interduced
me to a </B>
<P><B>friend of hers.  She was nice enough but for some reason I can't stand
to be </B>
<P><B>around her.  I make sure I'm never alone with her in the same room.
 I don't </B>
<P><B>think it's her herself but a presents she carries with her.  I just
don't want </B>
<P><B>to have that present with ME.  Been there done that.</B>
