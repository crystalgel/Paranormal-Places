<b><big>Strange Encounters<br>
<br>
By: lost_lady_101@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I was in wal-mart walking by the pet food department and I saw a long
haired black lab walk around the corner of one aisle and watched its
tail dissappear around the corner when I ran up to look down the aisle
there was nothing there. That was on Tuesday afternoon, Wednesday
morning I woke to my 2 year old standing at the foot of my bed eyes
blank just staring at something between his father and I. Around ten
that morning I went to fasten him into his car seat and he pointed to
something behind me I turned around and there was a yellow lab sitting
about three feet away from me holding perfectly still just staring even
when I shooed it nothing it just sat. My husband came out and asked
what I was doing I turned towards him and told him the dog wouldnt go
away and he said what dog as I turned back around there was nothing
there. We got in and my son asks "mommy why you scare the puppy?" Then
around six that evening my husband was driving us home from a christmas
even party and up ahead in the road I saw a man cross and just stop in
our lane so I shouted stop dont hit that man. My husband slowed and
looked over and said baby there is noone there. I made him pull over
and I got out and looked all around but I swear a man was standing in
our lane. If I had been driving I would have gotten us rear ended
because I would have slammed on my brakes so I didnt his the very solid
looking man. For the past 3 days now I have seen things like this and
heard children laughing and a woman screaming. Its like my 3rd eye has
been opened wide and things are rushing in with bad reception because
its not like I choose what or when I see these things or hear them. Not
to mention my son is seeing some of them too. Its worrying me a little,
its all ok until the line between reality and the other world cross I
would have sworn the man in the road was solid not an apparation. <br>

Paranormal Experience<br>
<br>
By: lowestfrequency@yahoo.com <br>
Growing up in rural Michigan I had several 'what the heck was that?'
experiences.&nbsp; Most were minor - a moving shadow or an uneasy
feeling - but one stands out.<br>
I was 8 to 10 years old (mid-80's) and my family had just returned from
a vacation.&nbsp; When we got out of the car my dad headed to the
mailbox, my mom to her garden, and I lugged my suitcase inside the
house.&nbsp; All of the windows were shut and I pulled the garage door
closed behind me.&nbsp; Walking through the house I passed the bay
window from which I could see my dad still in the road and my mom
picking some vegetables.&nbsp; The house was silent except for my
footsteps on the carpet.<br>
I walked into my room and put my suitcase down in the corner.&nbsp; I
heard a male voice laughing behind me...maybe in the doorway eight feet
away.&nbsp; It was a hearty laugh, loud and clear.&nbsp; I spun around
and there wasn't anyone in the doorway.&nbsp; I ran back to the garage,
through the door, and outside.&nbsp; My father was just grabbing his
suitcase from the car and my mother was pulling weeds.<br>
I wasn't scared when I heard the voice but not having a tangible body
to put with it did unnerve me a bit.&nbsp; Following the event I was
able to 'forget' and had no issues in the rest of the house.&nbsp; It
was only after I got older and interested in the paranormal did I
realize I might have had a run-in with something.<br>

My New/Old Haunted House<br>
<br>
By:bear1dad2@aol.com<br>
<br>
Two years ago, I bought a 126-year-old, 8,000 square-foot mansion in
Missouri, just outside of Kansas City where I grew up.&nbsp; My mother
had owned and lived in the house for the previous fifteen years, slowly
remodeling it.&nbsp; She had done a great job maintaining its mid-1800s
character, slowly bringing the wood work back to life, adding
insulation, and replacing all of the plumbing and wiring.&nbsp; I
mention this because I have heard that a disturbance in the environment
can cause spectral activity to begin.&nbsp; I had seen the house only
once as I live over 2,000 miles away, but I fell in love with it,
immediately. <br>
The first night I stayed over, I awoke in the middle of the night to
huge blobs--about a dozen from golf ball- to basketball-size, floating
around the room I was sleeping in.&nbsp; This is the one and only time
I have ever experienced anything like that.&nbsp; I closed my eyes,
said a prayer, and fell back to sleep in time.&nbsp; I said nothing to
my mother the next day until she asked me, &#8220;Well, did you see the
blobs? One of the workers stayed down there the other night and said he
wouldn&#8217;t stay in the house after dark again because of the blobs
floating around him.&#8221;&nbsp; She had not seen them and still
hasn&#8217;t.&nbsp; However, the previous owner told my mother a few years
later that he loved what she had done to the front room, but he could
never stay in there while the house was his because of the blobs! <br>
During the summer of 2007, I went back to see my family.&nbsp; I stayed
downstairs again, and had several things happen.&nbsp; It is important
to note that I have never felt in danger, only uncomfortable.&nbsp; My
mom and her boyfriend went upstairs to go to bed.&nbsp; I stayed
downstairs in the first floor master suite.&nbsp; For the next
forty-five minutes, the heavy footsteps above my head were attributed
to the two of them settling in for the night.&nbsp; Finally, I decided
I would go up and find out what was going on.&nbsp; The entire upstairs
was dark and still.&nbsp; They were both long in bed.&nbsp; I returned
to my bedroom to hear the continued walking above me so I went out to
the living room to sleep on the couch.&nbsp; The walking continued
above me, although there is only attic above the that living
room.&nbsp; I could also hear distant, quiet talk between a man and a
woman, but I could not make out what they were saying and it seemed to
be always somewhere else from were I was.&nbsp; <br>
The next morning, I decided maybe I would have a chat with myself--out
loud, and if anyone else heard it, then maybe it would be for the
better.&nbsp; I sat on the end of the bed (it was now daylight so I
felt comfortable to be in the bedroom again), and said that I was the
new owner and the son of the woman they probably knew very well by
now.&nbsp; I really liked the house and hoped to continue my mother&#8217;s
good work, but for now, I lived elsewhere.&nbsp; I also mentioned
something that I don&#8217;t suggest, but in this situation, I felt
comfortable in doing so.&nbsp; I told them that they seemed to have
been there a long time, and so long as they agreed to stay out of the
bathroom while I was in there, we could get along just fine
together.&nbsp; The following night was as quiet as could be.&nbsp; I
think their interest in me was satisfied.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
This past summer, 2008, was my third visit back.&nbsp; Absolutely
nothing happened.&nbsp; I was ready, and nothing! Hey, that&#8217;s fine with
me.&nbsp; But one side note: My mother sat down to look at an album she
had kept for all the years she had been doing the refurbishing.&nbsp;
She was showing me the huge change in the house from walls being ripped
out and then rebuilt, and so on.&nbsp; In well over half of the
pictures, there were huge light anomalies.&nbsp; There were smears,
blobs, and strange twists of the image.&nbsp; I mentioned this to my
mother, who looked right at me and said, &#8220;You know, I haven&#8217;t taken a
decent picture since I&#8217;ve lived in this house.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve owned one
crappy camera after another.&nbsp; All the pictures look like
this.&nbsp; I have to throw most of them away because they are no
good.&#8221;&nbsp; I just smiled.&nbsp; Right Mom! Every Polaroid, digital,
and disposable camera she has ever had in the past fifteen years has
had the same problem!<br>

A Personal Experience<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
<br>
<br>
I grew up with a mom who is wiccan and she is VERY psycic. She has told
me acuratly if a lover and I will break up, when, if I will meet
someone new and acurate descriptions of people I will meet. My mother
told my roommate that the child she was having would be a girl and she
was correct. My mom, to my amazement is the real deal. On hallowen our
house is the most popular because the alter my mother sets up outside
is very real. It is very fun and I grew up with a easy going view of
the supernatural. I do tend to be very logical and I believe in a
paranormal expierience if it does not seem like someone is bsing me. I
keep my mind open. My mother does have headaches if she is around
'haunted' houses. She has migraines that will make her sick for days
after being in one. She has had this happen to her several times in her
life including once when I was a kid.<br>
A few years ago when I was twenty-three I started having heart
palipitaions and tachicardia. My heart rate went up to 181 at one
point. I spent night after night in the emergency room and I was
recommended to a cardiooligist. I went through that for several months
before someone finally relized it was a seditive I took to help me
sleep. The doctors took me off the sleep medication and I soon found
out that I had become dependent on sleep aids. At the same time I had
to get on a grey hound bus for a two day trip to move back with my
parents because of the health problems. If you have ever traveled on
grey hound you know how hard it is to sleep. <br>
I was sleep deprived. I was told that I was sleeping but I did not
relize it. I was not sleeping through the night, though. I was
exhausted. I was depressed and I developed a phobia of the sound of a
beating heart, heart medication commericials..ect. In short, my mental
health was suffering and I had to make the choice to go into a
psyciatric ward because it took a month to get an appointment with a
psyciatrist. I did not want to wait that long.<br>
The ward was in a regular city hospital. All the patiants were quiet
and were there to heal. Nobody was dangerouse. There were patients with
bipolor and other types of mental illness. Nobody was dangerouse. There
are different levels of hospitals. This was a ward for anybody going
through emotional difficulties.<br>
I started to sleep the two days I was there. I was not dangerouse but
they did have to give me something to sleep. I was having 'dreams' in
which in my bathroom (patients had bathrooms in there rooms) I could
hear a woman crying and throwing up all night. It was horrible and
nightmarish. I could never see her because in the dream I was laying in
bed. How can I describe this? Even though I was asleep and dreaming it
felt like I was aware of everything going on. It never sounded quiet.
It sounded like patiants were throwing fits and that someone would go
by my room and wrap on the wall with a walker. And that poor woman
threw up and cryed. She sounded misserable. The ward was actually
always quiet nobody threw fits at night.<br>
My mom had taught me how to interpret dreams. I figured mine showed my
anxieties. I had been through hell. I wanted to sleep and I never gave
one thought to the idea that the place was haunted or had residuel
hauntings. I had greater concerns at the time. <br>
However, my mom came to pick me up and she refused to enter the ward. i
did not think anything of that either. We were driving home and she
asked me how I had slept and if I had. I told her about the nightmares
and how it was completely loud and I was still very exhaused. My mother
was shocked and it showed on her face. She said, "Sarah, those were not
just dreams. The psyciatric ward used to be a cancer ward. I was
getting a migraine because there are patient who have not moved on."
WOW. That shocked me.&nbsp; <br>
I never heard doctors mention that it had been cancer ward. The idea
was never put into my head. Like I have said, I wanted to sleep again
and to feel happy. I was concerned for my health. I believe my mom. She
usually is incredabally acurate about these kinds of things. I honestly
have gotten tired of finding out if me and a potential lover are not
going to work out. SHE IS THAT ACURATE! However, I could not tell you
if that ward was the former cancer ward. I simply do not know because
none of the doctors ever mentioned it. I was sleep deprived and going
through hell at the time. My emotional state could have been reflected
in my dreams.<br>
However, if I have learned anything about the paranormal is that it can
be a very small world. The hospital in question is in Spencer, Iowa.
Again, do not put that on your sight because of confidentiality. It is
a regular city hospital with an emergency room, surgery rooms..ect. It
is not a psyciatric hopital only. If a former nurse ever writes you or
even a fomer patient I am&nbsp; here to tell you that there may be
something to their experience. The ward in question is still open. This
was a few years ago that I was there. <br>
&nbsp;this is just a quircky experience that I wanted to share. <br>

Ghost Story<br>
<br>
<br>
By: fairyjester@cfl.rr.com<br>
<br>
My story has been on going for a couple years now. <br>
When I was nine we moved into our house. It&#8217;s a nice little place
backed by a large ditch, behind the ditch is a large forest that I used
to play in. <br>
The house itself is unremarkable. It&#8217;s three bedrooms. The master
bedroom is the first room you come to when you open the front door,
straight in. <br>
To the right there&#8217;s the door to the garage, to the left is the room we
use as our living room. to the right of that room is the dinning room,
with a entry into the kitchen. <br>
From the left of the living room is the hallway with the bedrooms and the bathroom. <br>
From the time when I first moved in I&#8217;ve never liked the bedroom at the
end of the hall. It has a window that looks out on the front yard. The
room I shared with my sister has a window that looks out onto the
backyard. I&#8217;m not sure what it is about the room, but it&#8217;s a creepy
feeling. <br>
I was around&#8230; eleven when my older sister moved out. By that time it
had been a while since I&#8217;d gotten any creepy feelings in the second
bedroom. I was pleased with the idea of having my own room.<br>
I moved my bed in there, got everything set up and prepared for the &#8216;grown up&#8217; life that I wanted. <br>
The first couple days were ok, I had strange nightmares about something coming in from the ditch, something I couldn&#8217;t explain. <br>
Finally, about a month after I&#8217;d been sleeping in the room I woke up suddenly from one of those dreams. <br>
I laid they for a while, not really sure of what woke me up, than I
realized that the music box my grandma had given me a year ago was on.
The music box was shaped like a carousel horse and had a switch on the
bottom of it that turned the music on. I sat up and took if down from
the shelf above my head and turned the switch off, I figured that maybe
my cat go up on the shelf and brushed against it. I laid back down to
go to sleep, it was lying there that I first saw Him. <br>
I don&#8217;t know what made me look up into the doorway of my bedroom (at
the time I slept with the door open,) but I did and standing there was
a man, clear as day. For a moment I was sure that someone must have
broken into the house. From the light coming off the nightlight near
the door I saw that his mouth was moving quickly, but no sound was
coming out. It was almost like he was screaming at me. <br>
He took a step forward and vanished. I slept in the living room that night.<br>
I finally got the nerve to sleep in my room again, after about a week
of sleeping on the sofa, and that night I had the same creepy nightmare
and woke up to find a child shape sitting on the end of my bed, staring
at me. It vanished when I turned the light on. <br>
I ended up spending the next year sleeping on the floor in my sister&#8217;s
room because my mom wouldn&#8217;t let me move my stuff in with her. <br>
I also couldn&#8217;t change in my room without getting the feeling of being
watched. I would glance at the mirror (It&#8217;s the type that sits on the
dresser,) and see a face staring at me, one that wasn&#8217;t my own. <br>
My older sister finally move back home and I ended up back in the other
bedroom with my sister. I thought that would make it go away, but I
would sometimes see the man standing in the doorway late at night, he&#8217;d
stand there staring at me, mouth moving, forming words I didn&#8217;t
understand. <br>
Three years ago some major changes happen. My oldest sister broke up
with her husband, lost her house and had to movie in with my mom and
dad, along with her two kids. My youngest older sister had her
boyfriend living in the house with her. The living arrangements were
this:<br>
My two oldest sisters slept in one room along with my youngest nephew
(belonging to the first sister I talked about.) My oldest sister&#8217;s kids
slept in the second bedroom with me. And my sister and her boyfriend
had the living room.<br>
It was weird at first but we all got used to it. The weird things had
calmed down since I had moved to the other bedroom, but it picked up
again when my sister moved in.<br>
I was trying to get to sleep, it was around one in the morning and I
saw the child shape again, but this time it was sitting at the end of
my niece&#8217;s bed. I sat up, but before I could say anything my niece woke
up screaming. She said it was a nightmare, and I had a feeling it was
probably the same one I had when I was younger. <br>
Things like this happened a lot. <br>
They moved out last year and things calmed down for the most part. Until my youngest older sister moved away. <br>
I now had a bedroom all to myself. I was trying, once again, to get to
sleep (I&#8217;ve always had trouble sleeping in this house.) and I looked at
my doorway and the man was standing there, but this time I could hear
him whispering, it was gibberish. I turned over and pulled the pillow
over my head but the room got so cold. I ended up turning my TV on and
closing my bedroom door. <br>
The oddest happening happened just a couple months ago, and it&#8217;s been a
while since anything happened, and it was the first time it had ever
happened. <br>
I was messing around with a couple of the other teenagers in the area,
we were crossing the ditch and going over to the woods behind the
houses. The way we cross is there&#8217;s an area with two large pipes that
stick out in the water, surrounding the pipes are these rocky things
that you can slid down but also grip with your hands. They&#8217;re kind of
smooth and hard to hold when wet. <br>
We were coming back, the others had crossed just fine, I was the last
one over. The first thing that happened was my hand slipped and I
started sliding down, I felt as if someone had grabbed my arm and
stopped me before I reached the water.<br>
I was about to step down into the water to get across when I heard someone yell my name and say very loudly in my ear to stop. <br>
I looked down at there was a snake in the water, right where I was
about to put my foot. My friend came back across and got rid of the
snake. I got home ok but when I went to take a shower later that night
I looked at my are and I hard a hand print bruise on my arm. <br>
I don&#8217;t know if it was one of the ghosts from the house, but something
stopped me from falling and from getting bitten by the snake. <br>
So, I guess, even if the ghosts scare me, they&#8217;re looking out for me too. <br>
I also found out something very strange in the last couple weeks. A
year before we moved in, the boyfriend of the former owner of the house
went missing. Police arrested the woman and charged her with his
murder, even though they never found the body. There was talk that she
might have dumped him into the main drainage ditch (which is a mile
from my house.) the body would have been washed into the river. <br>
I don&#8217;t know if the ghost is the murdered man, but he did help me I
think, and I haven&#8217;t had anything happen in the house for a while, so
alls well that ends well I guess.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

Ghosts<br>
<br>
<br>
By: oceanmarine@tpg.com.au<br>
<br>
Hi there, I would like to share some of my experiences, my name is Charlotte.<br>
I grew up in a very old part of Southern England and my Auntie and
Uncle lived in a home which is now about 200 years old. When she moved
in it was in a bad state. It was a victorian home and very reminiscent
of the era. My two cousins at the time were age 8 and 10, and I spent a
lot of time round at their place.<br>
I slept over quite regularly when I was little, but as I got older I
started noticing things. I was sharing my older cousins bunk bed and I
woke to hear what sounded like children running up and down the old
wooden hallway. I heard cupboards creaking and opening. The sound, if
it had only happened once, could have been put down to pipes under the
floorboards, but was exactly as if my cousins were running up and down
the hallway.I couldn't sleep that night, and asked my auntie if I could
go home to my mum.<br>
The next time I slept over, my cousins and I made a camp under the
bunk, and all three of us slept in it. The same sounds recurred that
night, and this time my cousins asked me 'what was that?'. I said
(protective instinct kicking in) 'its just your mum'. However I was
scared out of my mind. I slept with the blankets pulled over my head
and the pillows blocking my ears though I could still hear every little
sound, it even seemed to get louder. <br>
It always started after dark and did not cease until I eventually tired
myself out from fear and went to sleep. It was constant running up and
down.<br>
The next day I told my mum and Auntie and they told me it was just mice
under the floorboards and I said but mice are only little, this sounds
like a child running up and down. They never really said much else.It
happened a few more times, and every time after that I asked my auntie
if I could go home because I was sick, or missed my mum (I was only
little). <br>
The year before I moved to Australia, I was 14 and babysitting my
cousins with my mum. About 11'30 pm we were downstairs watching TV, and
mum fell asleep. I could hear the running up and down even then, but
being older I went to the kitchen to see if it really was the pipes.
The pipes were not making any noise. I then heard a massive crash,
which sounded like something had been tipped over. Mum woke up and went
upstairs to check it out, she came back down looking uneasy but told me
that one of my cousins had fallen out of bed.We confronted my auntie
and I knew she knew about the strange happenings, but didn't want to
say anything because of her girls. <br>
Years later, living in Australia, I tell my mum and she knew the reason
I came home all those nights was because of the noises. She also tells
me that when she went upstairs the girls were sound asleep and not one
of them had moved, so the huge crash was something unseen or that we
ourselves couldn't explain. My Auntie has since moved and I'm glad.<br>
I have had other experiences and often get goosebumps when something is
up or I sense a presence. My mum was pregnant with twins after she had
me, and they were both boys. She was going to call them Jack and Tom.
My brother Jack was born but Tom was lost, as mum believes and she only
ended up having one.&nbsp; I'd always known this and I feel like my
brothers brilliant musical ability is inspired by his lost brother,
although I believe 'Tom' is still around.<br>
A few months ago I came home and went straight upstairs to my room to
put my bag down, and I remember as clear as ever (jacks room is next to
mine) walking past him sitting at his desk and going to the bathroom, I
even said hey Jack. Thinking he was engrossed in a computer game and
didnt hear me, I shrugged and carried on. I went downstairs only to
find Jack on the couch watching TV. I stood there and according to jack
looked really shocked, and said weren't you just upstairs? He said no,
I put it down to me being silly.<br>
Later I kept seeing a little black cat in my house out of the corner of
my eye, or flashes of a cat, or the presence, its hard to explain. I
have a large tabby cat called chloe and she is huge, this little cat
kept appearing in the laundry by my cats food bowl or just sitting
nonchalantly in the kitchen. The previous owner of our house had a lot
of cats. I even got attacked by one of them when we were moving all of
our things in when we first moved there.<br>
Later on I told mum what had happened with Jack and also seeing the
cat. She told me that Jack had spoken to her earlier and was a bit
freaked out about me seeing 'him' upstairs AND downstairs and he had
also been seeing a cat around the house. We told my mum this on
seperate occasions and she thought it was quite strange but because we
were in tune with each other we see the same things.<br>
&nbsp;She thinks it is Tom that I saw upstairs, and I wasn't scared,
just upset because I would love to have two twin brothers. She has also
seen him, almost like a protection to Jack. Tom is growing up with Jack
in the spirit world and every time mum goes to see a psychic she is
told that a strong presence with a name beginning with T is coming
through. It isn't scary because its real and he wants to make himself a
part of our lives.<br>
I am now 22 and Mum has taught me that these things aren't anything to
be scared of. If I see a sudden flash out of the corner of my eye, I
know it is something more. However I try to be really positive as I
know that this seeing things can create fear but as I said, I'm not
scared. I'm quite interested to explore it a bit more. <br>
Thanks for listening :)<br>

Growing Up in My House<br>
<br>
By: SHAEC@uwyo.edu<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
My house is haunted.&nbsp; I always knew it, but I didn&#8217;t realize until
I left it that the things that happened in my house were NOT the things
that happened in other people&#8217;s houses.&nbsp; <br>
Someone, usually ten or twelve times a night, would seem to come into
our enclosed front porch and into the living room, until one night,
after a party, my mother tried to shut the inside door only to have it
rebound against her as though it had hit some very large person.&nbsp;
No one was in the porch.&nbsp; After that, the sounds would only be of
someone coming into the porch but not into the living room.<br>
My sister and I separately saw a dark, shapeless form that hovered at
the end of our beds.&nbsp; Also, at night, my sister&#8217;s closet doors
would sound as though they had opened and that someone was pulling
heavy luggage down from the top shelf.&nbsp; This &#8220;traveler&#8221; did this
most nights, at least once.&nbsp; Her radio would turn on and turn up
its own volume.&nbsp; I would hear my parents calling me only to
realize I was in the house alone.<br>
A friend who stayed over got up in the night to go to the bathroom, but
it sounded to him as though the bathtub were filling, so he
waited.&nbsp; After about an hour, he couldn&#8217;t wait anymore (there&#8217;s
only one bathroom), and he wondered why the tub was still
filling.&nbsp; When he finally nudged the door open, the sounds were
still happening, but no water was in the tub and the light was off.<br>
My brother has also seen things, not the shapeless form but more of an
impish creature leering at him from the top of the open bedroom
door.&nbsp; Things have pushed the bed up under us.&nbsp; One bedroom,
that has no electrical stuff in it at all except the light, gives most
people who go in it a very negative feeling of being watched.<br>
There&#8217;s far too much to tell, really.&nbsp; I am always surprised when
people say they don&#8217;t believe.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve obviously never been to my
house.<br>

LAKE PERFIDY AND SENECA WAR DRUMS<br>
<br>
By: 157east@comcast.net<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
GROWING UP IN SALAMANCA NEW YORK I SPENDT ALOT OF TIME ON THE ALLEGHENY
RIVER FISHING&nbsp; AND CAMPING. IN 1965 THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS
FINISHED THE KINZUA DAMN AGAINST THE WISHES OF THE SENECA NATION OF
INDIANS. THE U.S. GOVERMENT BROKE THE LONGEST STANDING TREATY IN THE
NATIONS HISTORY BY IGNORING THE SENECA'S PLIGHT AND FLOODING OVER
12,000 ACRES OF INDIAN RESERVATION LAND. IN THE PROCESS THEY FLOODED A
SACRED INDIAN CEMETERY CONTAINING THE CHIEF CORNPLANTER . TO THE
SENECAS THE BODY OF WATER BEHIND KINZUA DAMN IS NOW KNOW AS LAKE
PERFIDY AND MANY BITTER SENECA'S TELL THEIR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN
THAT NO ONES KNOWS FOR SURE WHO'S BONES LIE BENEATH THE TRANSPLANTED
CORNPLANTER GRAVE ABOVE THE WATERS OF THE LAKE. THE WAY THE MOVING TOOK
PLACE, THE REMAINS COULD BE THOSE OF ANOTHER INDIAN FROM THE OLD
CEMETERY. THE GREAT CORNPLANTER COULD NOW BE RESTING BENEATH THE WATERS
OF THE RESERVOIR.<br>
I SPENDT MANY NIGHTS WITH FRIENDS FISHING ON THE ALLEGHENY, WE WOULD
TAKE OUR CANOE, LOAD UP WITH SUPPLIES AND SPEND 3 OR 4 DAYS CAMPING AND
FISHING. WE WOULD SET UP TENTS ON SMALL SPOIL ISLANDS OR SAND BARS AND
FISH AND GENERALLY HAVE A GOOD TIME. AT NIGHT WE WOULD HAVE BONFIRES
GOING TO KEEP WARM AND LIGHT THE NITE. THE ALLEGHENY RUNS THRU SOME
PRETTY RUGGED COUNTRY WITH NOTHING BUT WILDERNESS AROUND SO A GROUP OF
TEENAGED BOYS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT ON THEIR OWN. SEVERAL TIMES WE WOULD
HEAR DRUMS&nbsp; BEATING OFF IN THE DISTANCE , THEY SUPPOSEDLY WERE
SENECA WAR DRUMS PLANNING REVENGE FOR THE DESECRATION OF CORNPLANTERS
GRAVE. WHILE THE DRUMS WERE PLAYING THE NITE WOULD GROW ABSOLUTELY
QUITE AND IT SEEMED TO BECOME EVEN DARKER , SITTING AWAY FROM THE
CAMPFIRE I FELT LIKE I WAS LEFT OUT IN THE DARK LOOKING IN, NOT SHARING
IN THE LIGHT, IT WAS A VERY LONELY AND DEPRESSING FEELING. ONE TIME
WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON I LOOKED OUT OVER THE RIVER AND SAW WHAT SEEMED
TO ME TO BE AN IROQUOIS RAIDING PARTY RUSHING DOWN THE RIVER IN SEVERAL
CANOES, THEY WERE ALL IN TRADITIONAL INDIAN DRESS WITH WAR PAINT, BOWS,
SPEARS, AND&nbsp; ARROWS, THE LAST BRAVE STARED DIRECTLY AT ME BEFORE
RUSHING OUT OF SIGHT , IT SEEMED TO GET EXTREMELY COLD AND I COULD SEE
MY BREATH EVEN THOUGH THE TEMPERATURE WAS IN THE LOW SIXTIES AT THE
TIME, MY ONE FRIEND MIKE ALSO SAW THE WAR PARTY AND FELT THE SAME&nbsp;
AS ME, BUT THE TWO OTHER GUYS WITH US WERE OFF ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
SAND BAR FISHING AND SAW NOTHING. WE WERE WELL INTO THE WILDERNESS AND
AT LEAST A GOOD FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MILES FROM ANYBODY OR ANYTHING. I
ALWAYS FELT THAT CERTIAN PLACES SEEM TO HOLD ENERGY OR MAJIC, SOME GOOD
AND SOME DARKER,&nbsp; AND WHAT WE SAW WAS A GLIMPSE OF A DARKER&nbsp;
PAST RUSHING BY, THAT WAS OVER 25 YEARS AGO AND TO THIS DAY I BELIEVE<br>

One Other Incident<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
<br>
I recently wrote of some Paranormal incidents in my life which was
posted under True Stories - Real Experiences on Page Thirteen, Story
Page 450 as "Two Incidents" (at the very top of the page), and after
talking with my younger brother, we remembered another incident that
happened to us around the same time.<br>
My Grandmother died when I was 13&frac12; , so this happened between to
me between the age of 9 (when I was allowed to walk home from school)
and 13 (when my Grandmother was still healthy).<br>
I was walking home from school one day and did not remember anything
strange happening during that time, and when I arrived home, I found my
Grandmother and my younger brother sitting on the front porch (I seem
to remember that my younger brother was sick that day from school), and
they were both upset over what had just happened.<br>
They both had seen me walk past our house and go inside the neighbor's
house next door (a Fire Captain, which we were good neighbors with),
and they were ready to go after me and bring me home, when after a very
short period of time, I actually came walking up to our house "in the
flesh" so to speak.<br>
I was told of this supposed "bi-location" feat (my words), and I denied
knowing of ever going to the house next door, which I guess my
Grandmother and my younger brother finally believed me, but we could
not offer any explanation as to what really happened that day.<br>
It wasn't until my teen years and early adult years that I became
interested in Paranormal science because of the incidents that had
happened in my life, and then I realized that this was a true
"bi-location" incident, and that it been witnessed by two witnesses on
that day, who had NO reason to lie or fabricate this sighting.<br>

My Parents First Home<br>
<br>
By: 157EAST@comcast.net<br>
<br>
<br>
WHEN I WAS 13 MY PARENTS PURCHASED THEIR FIRST HOME, THIS IS IN A VERY
SMALL UPSTATE NEW YORK TOWN. THE HOUSE WAS LOCATED ON A SIDE OF A HILL
WITH NOTHING BUT WOODLAND BEHIND IT. WE HAD A BACKYARD, A LIGHT LINE OF
TREES, ANOTHER OPEN YARD SPACE AND THEN A SMALL PINE TREE GROVE AND
AFTER THAT HEAVY TREES AND FOREST. ON THE SECOND OPEN YARD BEFORE THE
PINE TREES WAS A SMALL HOUSE THAT BURNED DOWN IN THE EARLY 30'S, ALL
THAT WAS LEFT WAS SOME OF THE FOUNDATION, LATER DURING MY TROUBLES I
FOUND OUT THAT THE FAMILY LIVING IN THIS HOUSE LOST 2 BOYS AND 1 LITTLE
GIRL IN THE FIRE, BOTH PARENTS AND ANOTHER SMALL GIRL SURVIVED, IT WAS
THOUGHT THAT THE FIRE WAS STARTED BY ONE OF THE CHILDREN PLAYING WITH
MATCHES. <br>
&nbsp; I NEVER LIKED THIS HOUSE EVEN FROM THE BEGINNING, IT HAD A
STRANGE ROOM ADDED TO A BATH THAT WAS ALWAYS COLD, AND THE WHOLE HOUSE
JUST DID NOT FEEL RIGHT, IT WAS LIKE I NEVER FELT LIKE I BELONGED
THERE. AFTER A FEW YEARS MY OLDER BROTHER FINISHED OFF THE BASEMENT
INTO 2 SEPERATE BEDROOMS, I GOT ONE AND HE MOVED INTO THE OTHER ONE,
BUT BEING MUCH OLDER THAN ME, HE DID NOT SPEND ALOT OF TIME IN HIS
ROOM, RIGHT FROM THE START THINGS WERE NOT RIGHT, THERE WERE ALWAYS
LOUD NOISES AND BUMPS AND BANGS, EVEN DURING THE DAY , BUT AT NIGHT IT
WAS WORSE,&nbsp; MY BED WAS RIGHT NEXT TO THE WALL AND I HAD A CHAIR
NEXT TO THE BED FOR A SMALL NIGHT STAND, ALSO THE BASEMENT WAS SUNK
INTO THE GROUND AND I HAD ONE SMALL WINDOW THAT WAS UP AT THE TOP OF
THE ROOM ABOVE THE BED, IT WAS AT GROUND LEVEL ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE
HOUSE AND DURING THE WINTER IT WAS COMPLETELY COVERED BY SNOW. MANY
TIMES THE CHAIR NEXT TO MY BED WOULD SLIDE AND RATTLE ACROSS THE
CONCRETE FLOOR, I WOULD FEE L AN EVIL PRESENCE AND SEE DARKNESS OUT OF
THE CORNER OF MY EYE, CLOTHES WOULD FLY OFF THE HANGERS IN THE CLOSET,
I WOULD EXPERIENCE SHARP STABBING PAINS ALL OVER MY BODY LIKE SOMEONE
STICKING ME WITH A SHARP OBJECT. AT NIGHT THE BED WOULD VIOLENTLY SHAKE
WITH EXTREMELY LOUD BANGINGS THRU OUT THE ROOM AND ON ALL THE WALLS AND
CEILING.<br>
&nbsp; MY FATHER WAS A PRETTY VIOLENT PERSON AND ACCUSED ME OF ALL THE
NOISES AND OTHER HAPPENINGS AND WOULD PUNISH ME SEVERLY, SO I WAS
PRETTY MUCH FORCED TO STAY IN THIS ROOM DURING THE NIGHT. I NEVER SLEPT
VERY GOOD AND AT TIMES IT SEEMED THAT I WOULD BE TAKEN ON TRIPS OUT OF
MY BODY, SOMETIMES IT SEEMED LIKE I WAS GOING INTO THE PAST, OTHER
TIMES I WOULD SEE THE BURNING HOUSE AND FEEL THE FLAMES, SOMETIMES I
WOULD TRAVEL TO DIFFERENT PLACES AROUND THE TOWN. I WAS FRIGHTENED AND
HAD NO ONE TO TURN TO, I WENT TO CHURCH AND TRIED TO TALK TO THE
PRIEST, BUT COULD NOT BRING UP THE COURAGE, I DID GET A SMALL ROSARY
WITH A CROSS ON IT AND HUNG IT IN MY ROOM, AFTER THAT THINGS SEEMED TO
GET WORSE, THE CHAIR WOULD BE FLUNG ACROSS THE ROOM, ALONG WITH SMALL
OBJECTS, I COULD NOT SLEEP AT ALL, THE BED WOULD BANG ALL OVER AND A
HEAVY WEIGHT WOULD PRESS DOWN ON ME AND I COULD NOT GET UP, I WOULD TRY
WITH ALL OF MY MIGHT TO RISE UP OUT OF BED JUST TO TURN ON THE LIGHT
AND IT WOULD BE NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE, I WOULD CONTINUE TO TRY TO GET UP
AND IT WAS LIKE WALKING IN THICK LIQUID WITH EVERY MOVE RESISTING ME,
SOMETIMES I WAS ABLE TO GET TO THE LIGHT SWITCH AND GET THE LIGHT ON,
THE BANGING AND MOVING OBJECTS WOULD SLOWLY SETTLE DOWN AND I FELT
SLIGHTLY BETTER, I WOULD STAY UP ALL NIGHT PRACTIALLY SCARED TO DEATH.<br>
&nbsp; AFTER ENDURING THIS FOR AWHILE I WENT TO THE LIBRIARY AND
RESEARCHED THE PROPERTY AND FOUND OUT ABOUT THE HOUSE AND FAMILY IN THE
BACK. I TRIED TO TELL MY DAD ABOUT THIS, BUT HE WAS HAVING NONE OF IT,
HE FELT&nbsp; I WAS ACTING OUT AND DOING EVERYTHING MYSELF. ONE OF THE
LAST NIGHTS I EVER SPENDT IN THE HOUSE WAS THE ABSOLUTE WORST, I AM
STILL SCARED THINKING ABOUT IT AND HOPE AND PRAY THAT I NEVER HAVE TO
GO THRU ANYTHING LIKE IT AGAIN, I KNOW I CAN NOT ENDURE ANOTHER RITUAL
LIKE IT, EVER. I FELL ASLEEP WITH THE LIGHT ON WITH VERY LITTLE
HAPPENINGS GOING ON, WHEN I COULD NOT CATCH MY BREATH, THE LITE WENT
OUT, THE BED WAS VIOLENTLY SHAKING WITH THE BLANKETS&nbsp; ALL PULLED
UP AROUND ME AND I WAS DOWN IN THE MIDDLE WITH SOMETHING CRUSHING MY
CHEST, THE WALLS WERE BANGING, MY LITTLY ROSARY WAS UPSIDE DOWN AND
FLAMING BLACK IN FRONT OF MY FACE,&nbsp; THE BEADS WERE FLYING ALL OVER
THE PLACE, EVERYTHING WAS IN AN UPROAR, I WAS DEATHLY AFRAID THAT THE
HOUSE WAS ON FIRE SO I STRUGGLED WITH EVERY ONCE OF STRENGTH I HAD TO
GET UP AND OUT OF THE BED, AFTER WHAT SEEMED FOREVER I WAS ABLE TO MAKE
IT TO THE LIGHT SWITCH AND GET THE LIGHTS ON, EVRYTHING WAS GETTING
BACK TO NORMAL WHEN THE LIGHT SUDDENLY WENT BACK OUT AND I COULD NOT
TURN THEM ON AGAIN, I WAS THEN SLAMMED INTO THE CORNER OF THE ROOM
ABOVE THE BED, I SAW A VERY DARK, DEMONIC FIGURE SITTING ON THE CHAIR I
USED FOR A NITE STAND STARING AT ME, THE BEST WAY I CAN EXPLAIN IT IS,
IT WAS A REPTILIAN FIGURE WITH WHAT SEEMED LIKE A PURPLE CATHOLIC
VESTMENT ON OR AROUND IT, I CAN STILL SEE IT CLEARLY AND IN A WAY IT
STILL HAUNTS ME TO THIS DAY. EVERYTHING WAS FLYING VIOLENTLY AROUND ,
THE WALLS&nbsp; AND CEILING WERE BANGING&nbsp; AND KNOCKING ABOUT, THEY
WERE EVEN BOWING OUT LIKE SOMETHING HUGE WAS PUSHING AGAINST THEM FROM
THE OTHER SIDE, I DO NOT KNOW HOW I GOT OUT BUT THE HOUSE HAD A NATURAL
GAS FIRED WATER HEATER AND THE PILOT LITE MUST OF CAUGHT SOMETHING ON
FIRE, TH E HOUSE WAS BURNING, I MADE IT OUT OF THE BASEMENT WITH A
BROCKEN ARM, A BROKEN COLLAR BONE AND SOME BANGED UP RIBS, MY FAMILY
MADE IT OUT OF THE HOUSE WITH NO PROBLEMS AND MY DAD PUT THE SMALL FIRE
OUT, I ENDED UP MOVING TO LONG ISLAND TO LIVE WITH MY GRAND PARENTS
AFTER THAT. MY PARENTS ARE NOW BOTH GONE, MY GRANDPARENTS WHO RAISED ME
WITH LOVE AND AFFECTION ARE ALSO GONE AND THEY ARE WHO I TRULY MISS AND
WHO I LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING AGAIN ON THE OTHER SIDE THE MOST,&nbsp;
THING SEEM BETTER WITH ONLY SMALL OCCURANCES EVERY NOW AND THEN, BUT
NOTHING LIKE WHAT I WENT THRU, THE FEW PEOPLE I TALK TO ALL THINK I
JUST MADE IT UP TO COVER MY ABUSIVE PARENTS, I KNOW WHAT I WENT THRU
AND HOPE WITH MY DYING BREATH TO NEVER MEET THAT FATE AGAIN<br>

Don't Drive Alone at Night<br>
<br>
By: aj_mh@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
I have had alot of thing's happen to me in my life, from seeing eye's
in the corner of my room to being slapped by something that I could not
see, so I am very open to anything and everything that some would think
was weird or crazy. my mom how ever is not so for her to tell me about
what happened to her I know is true. I am 28 now and this happened a
few years before I was born. my mom was a FHA teacher for 15 years so
she went to FHA meetings alot. one night she was at a get to gather for
school and it was getting late and as she was getting ready to go one
of her friends car wouldn't start so my mom said she would take her
home, as they where driving her friend and her where talking not even
thinking about how far out in the middle of no where they wear. finely
they got to her house and my mom dropped her off and started home, it
was a very calm night and very dark almost eary calm, as she was
driving down the road she started to fill uneasy so she tried to blow
it off until she turned down a back road to the highway I cant think of
the name of the road but I do know there was quite a few fatal
accidents on that road because of how winde it is. so as she was
driving she looked over and saw this thing running right beside her it
was as big as a cow and it's eyes glowed green she got so scared, she
stepped on the gas and was going 85mph and the thing kept right up with
her and never slowed down at one point she even made eye to eye with
it. that thing ran 85mph with my mom for about 12 mil. tell she hit the
highway and then it was gone. she never found out what it was nor did
she ever go down that road agene. she has only had 2 things happen to
her in her life that she couldn't explain and that was one of them the
other was when she went to bed one night when she was a teen she just
got into bed and looked over at her closet and there was something that
looked like a man floating with a glow around it coming at her, she ran
and told her mom and her mom told her it was nothing so she went back
to bed and she saw it agene and ran out and sleep on the couch.<br>

Sidney Street, Saint Louis, MO<br>
<br>
By: anonymous<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Let me start with the usual, "I never believed in hauntings until it
happened to me". I am a very conservative, level-headed person who does
not take to flights of fancy. I would have put most of this into the,
"There must be a logical explanation for this" category, but several
other people witnessed these happenings.<br>
When it came time to buy my first home, I wanted what most young people
want, as much house as my money could buy. This meant buying in the
city instead of the suburbs and looking for a fixer-upper. I
interviewed realtors and started the search for my dream house. After
looking at about 25 houses, eliminating each one for various reasons, I
received the call that a house was available, but wasn't yet on the
market. The owner had passed away and the estate was looking for a
quick cash sale. It was in my price range. <br>
"Would you be interested in looking at?"<br>
"I'll meet you there in 15 minutes!"<br>
As I pulled up to the address given me, I knew this was the home I was
looking for. (I have goose-flesh typing this, that's how excited I
was!) It was perfect. A brick three story French Revival built in the
1880's that was a little down on it's luck, but with great bones. The
grass was overgrown and the paint was peeling, but I could tell it was
a gem waiting for a polish.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
&nbsp; The realtor pulled up and the first words out of my mouth were, "I'll take it."<br>
&nbsp;"Wouldn't you like to look at it first?"<br>
&nbsp;"Oh. Yeah. But I want it."<br>
Up three limestone steps, across the brick walkway, three more
limestone steps, and we were at the double entry doors. The 19th
century version of storm doors. Inside a small vestibule are another
set of double doors. We entered a wonderful entrance hall with a three
story walnut staircase, dirty, but untouched since it was built. In
fact that's what really put this house over the top. All of the
woodwork in the house was original and untouched.&nbsp; A double
parlor, diningroom, kitchen, breakfast room and a 1950's half bath made
up the first floor. Four bedrooms and 1 bathroom on the second floor
and two small servant's bedrooms as well as a large nursery make up the
third floor. My full price offer was accepted later that day. Closing
came two weeks later.<br>
Now comes the weirdness. My first action was to upgrade all the house
systems. I couldn't live there until there until I felt safe with the
electrical work, so that came first. I called the electrician several
of my friends had used prior, and he started several days after I
closed on the house. Then I started getting calls from Joe, the
electrician, about his tools and supplies turning up in different parts
of the house. Areas he wasn't working in at the time. I chalked it up
to absent mindedness, or his apprentice playing tricks on him. When I
told my friends about these incidents, I was told in no uncertain terms
that Joe wouldn't make that kind of stuff up. I had an alarm system
added, just in case.<br>
And then it happened to me. I was working in the front yard, and that
feeling of being watched came over me. On my knees, planting flowers,
facing the house, I assumed a neighbor had come over to great me and
welcome me to the neighborhood. I looked up and in the window looking
out at me was a man I had never seen before. I knew I was the only
person there. Joe hadn't arrived yet, so that meant I had a squatter! I
jumped up and ran up the stairs into the house. All of ten seconds had
past at the most, and I was were the man had stood. Nobody there. I
dialed 911 and said I had an intruder. He couldn't have left the house
as the back door had a security look that takes a key even on the
inside. All the windows had been sealed shut. I locked the front door,
also a security/keyed lock and started searching for him. No one on the
first floor or the basement. The basement also has a door but as you
may have guessed, it also has a security lock. <br>
The police arrived and searched the house and of course we came up
empty handed. I was/am adamant that someone had to be in the house.
There was a man. I saw him clear as day. He couldn't have left without
my seeing him. The officers were nice, but a little patronizing and
said I should call if he came back. Well, now I was truly pissed. And
confused. Did I just imagine it? No use worrying about it now. Just
remember to set the alarm and get the house ready for moving day.<br>
And I can remember the mystery man's expression as if it was yesterday
instead of 15 years ago. He was looking at me with a quizzical look
mixed with a kind of satisfaction on his face. A kind face. Joe
completed his work quickly and I moved in. I didn't even bother to
paint before taking up residence. I was that anxious to be in my own
home.<br>
<br>
Work kept me busy for the next few months so nothing really was
accomplished on the house. I met a few neighbors and was happy to know
that almost everyone had lived there for many years prior to me. A nice
stable neighborhood is important in the city. I felt very welcome.
Until I started redecorating. Then strange incidents became quite
commonplace. My keys would end up missing. And I never misplace my
keys. Weird knocking sounds. Footfalls on the staircase leading up from
the basement. Sounds. Not house settling sounds, knocking. I know house
sounds, I grew up in an old house. I did not mention these things to
anyone. Who wants their friends to think they're crazy? Not me. I
passed it off as stress from work. And then came the house party.<br>
A lot of neighbors came by to see what I've done to the place and of
course my friends came. Lots of ooo's and aaah's .Everyone had a great
time and I heard from several people about the man who lived in the
home prior to me.<br>
"He was a nice guy."<br>
"Kept to himself but a really nice guy."<br>
"He really loved this house. And he was such a nice man."<br>
"Never really knew him, but he seemed nice."<br>
If I heard it once, I heard it a hundred times. Maybe that's why the
house has such a warm feeling about it. From the first moment, I felt
welcome and comfortable in the house. But my next door neighbor, who
had lived there for over thirty years, creeped me out by saying, "So,
has Tony let you know he's still here?"<br>
"I beg your pardon?"<br>
"Tony told me he loved this house so much, he'd never leave it." <br>
"Well... that's nice. It is a great house. I can understand why he felt that way."<br>
Just my luck, my neighbor's a nutjob. <br>
Fast forward a couple months and I adopt a rescue a dog from the animal
shelter. Bella was just a sad image of a dog when she and I become a
family. And I loved her from the start. But many times, she would just
stare at a corner of the TV room. Sometimes out a dead sleep she'd wake
up and stare at the corner, head tilting back and forth. I assumed it
was some kind of personality tick. <br>
A few more months go by with a few things happening once in awhile.
Like my coffee cup sitting out on the counter in the morning, waiting
for me. Though never anything I could quantify as paranormal. I never
even thought along those lines. A few friends would say things when
they visited, like "Did you see that?" or "Who's in the basement?". I
would always tell them that their imagination was getting the better of
them. And every now and then my neighbor would ask if I'd seen Tony
yet. <br>
Crazy ol' bat.<br>
More time, more small things happen. Probably the oddest thing up to
that time was that I never had to dust the furniture. Ever. Now, I'm a
neat freak, but old homes get dusty. I used to follow my cleaning lady
and redust after she left at my apartment. Not here though. She quit
after three weeks without really giving a reason. And then I hired a
friend to house/dogsit while I went on vacation. Jackie claims she's
sensitive to spirits and told me there's one in my home. I smile at her
with that, "Sure, whatever you say" smile.<br>
"He doesn't like women."<br>
"So you don't want to housesit?"<br>
<br>
"I'm not afraid of him. When do you want me?"<br>
When I came home from holiday I found a note on the kitchen table which
said my friend was asleep when she was hit with a rather large painting
that hangs in the guest room she was staying in. It didn't just fall
off the wall. That painting was a good 6 feet from the bed. "It was
Tony, and he was unhappy that I was here. I'm taking Bella to my house
and staying there. I don't think he wanted to hurt me, just scare me."
I never told her that name. And she didn't ask any neighbor including
the lady next door. I asked around. Weird. Creepy. And yes, the
painting was dented where it hit her, yet the heavy filigree frame was
unmarred. It would have broken if it had hit the floor.<br>
More time and I found myself in a relationship with my
partner/lover/husband/whatever. He moves in and everything is great. We
adopt another dog. 6 weeks old. Sweet as a lamb. He starts with the
head-tilt stare too. Time for redecorating again. More walking when no
one's there. Things come off walls. No bent nails or broken picture
wire, they just fall off without damage to the frames. Sometimes we
would hang something else in it's place and all would be well. As if
Tony was saying, "That doesn't look good there".But it came to a head
one night at dinner.<br>
No less than eight people can confirm this. We were seated at the
dinner table having our salad course when we heard the basement door
open and close. Footsteps then cross the basement and are heard coming
up the stairs. (This staircase empties into the back service hall near
the dining room We're looking at each other thinking, "What the hell is
that?" We hear the basement door at the top of the stairs open and shut
followed by a few more footsteps and then we ALL see the dining room
door open wide, very deliberately and then it closes with a click of
the latch. No slamming or anything like that. Done just as if you or I
had done it. Very wide eyes scanned around the table at each other. And
a few mouths agape. I put up a brave front and just shrugged my
shoulders and kept eating my salad. Inside, I almost wet myself. Most
of my friends never came over after that. And I became a believer in
the paranormal, although I still think most things can be explained in
a logical way.<br>
We moved from the Sidney Street house several years later, and I still
miss that house. When I'm in town I drive by and see that it's still
very well kept, although I've often been tempted to stop and knock up
the owner to ask if Tony is still making himself known. I like to think
he liked my brining his house up to snuff. <br>

The House<br>
<br>
By: amandaparkhurst@gmail.com<br>
<br>
i am a clairvoyant and am used to not being alone. The last house I
lived in had a number of distinctive entities and will only share a
couple of my experiences with you now.<br>
There was a young girl, probably around 4 or 5 who was very prevalent
around the time my son was three. one night i had a contact
dream,(usually my dreams are surreal and nonsense, but when i contact
someone they are usually set in whatever house i am in and are more of
out of body experiences) i walked to the end of my hall and looked
through the dining room into the kitchen, and there was a small girl
with waist length dark brown (not black) wavy hair, she had a flowered
white nightgown on and she was pushing buttons on the microwave. when i
asked her why she was here she quickly (like Japanese horror cross the
room in a blink quickly) came up to me. i crouched down but i couldn't
see her face, and somehow i knew she had been badly injured (think
gunshot wound to the eyes and cheek) so i didn't want to see her face.
i explained to her that she needed to move on and go into the light
where her family was waiting and then i walked back to my room with her
following behind me. i woke up then went back to sleep and a while
later my son (3) woke me up (half way anyways... enough to answer him
and kind of remember) and he asked me to tell the girl she was NOT his
sister and to leave him ALONE! i told him to lay down in my bed and
explained to her ( she was about three feet away) that i was not her
mother and she needed to move on that it wasn't her house anymore. i
thought that part was a dream when i woke up until i realized my son
was asleep beside me. <br>
the other VERY noticeable energy in my house was that of a woman who
was very straight laced and controlling. she would often sit on a
window seat in my bed room at night. My husband, who, is a very
sceptical man would sit up in his sleep staring with closed eyes toward
her and ask over and over, "who is that, who the hell is that" until i
would tell him it's ok then he would lay back down. well this house was
in Oklahoma and every time there was tornado weather outside she would
panic and really become agitated and very distracting to those who
could sense her so i'd have to calm her down and watch the storm. when
my alarm clock didn't go off she would bang loudly on the window in
time for you to get to work ( the only nice thing she would do). But
when we were moving out she really flipped stirring up whatever else
was there so in the middle of the night i would hear floor shaking
bangs from completely empty rooms, tape would be peeled off boxes and
placed across the room thing would be removed from boxes overnight and
put in different rooms ( like books stacked in the middle of the kichen
after they were packed) and sounds of the tv comming on after it had
been unplugged and wrapped in protective sheeting. All in all it was
NOT a very fun move especially when i was alone the last 4 weeks of
packing and she kept opening the valve on my air mattress at 2 am. <br>
My new house is nice but i keep hearing a little boy talk to me from a corner of my bedroom. Oh well.<br>

Haunted Houses<br>
<br>
By: duckit.0402@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
All of these accounts have happened in Lake Havasu, Arizona, each in a different house.<br>
My mother and I were driving around town looking for a house to rent
when we found a large house on Boyou Drive. This house was an old
blueish color with vines creeping up the outer walls and into the fire
place, with a large over hang on the front porch.&nbsp; As soon as we
started walking up drive way, a very strong feeling of dread started to
creep through my body.&nbsp; I really liked the house so I ignored the
feeling and continued into the back yard.&nbsp; As I entered backyard I
remembered a dream many months before.&nbsp; This exact backyard was in
my dream and imagines of death and demons filled my mind.&nbsp; My
mother had the same feeling so we left without another word deciding
that a door had opened and a demon was dwelling inside the house. <br>
We moved into a different house where everything felt normal at first;
we lived there for seven years.&nbsp;&nbsp; I soon felt eyes watching
me in the shower which then lead gusts of freezing angry wind rushing
past my face and arms.&nbsp; Later I learned my mother was going
through the same events, only she experienced only one of the gusts of
wind.&nbsp; When we started talking of moving out of the house, things
got worse.&nbsp; My mom once felt a figure sit down on the bed beside
her and saw the indentation if a person on the bed.&nbsp; There were no
dogs in the room and the entire house was asleep.&nbsp; I saw blinds
move with nothing in the room and a shadowy figure walk across the
kitchen. <br>
I was cleaning out a house, just about to move into it, when I
repeatedly saw a figure of a little girl our of the corner of my
eye.&nbsp; I could sometimes hear her talking softly to no one in
particular.&nbsp; Later investigation proved a little girl had drowned
in the pool years
before.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Lexington, Ms<br>
<br>

<br>
In 1968 I moved into a house on the highway from Lexington, Ms to
Tchula , Ms, a few miles outside of Lexington that sits in a bottom
that can be seen from the highway on the left. There were no neighbors
for miles around. I was a teenager at the time. The doors would unlock
by themselves, my mother could hear sounds like a man whistling during
the day, you could go into Lexington, and return to find all of the
doors open, and all of your clothes thrown in the yard, My Grandmother
lived with us, and once complained to my mother for turning her
mattress when she didn't, the propane man came to make delivery one
day. My mother had our German Sheppard dog in the house with her, went
outside with the dog, when all of a sudden the dog bristled up, ran a
few yards away from them barking only to yelp, and go down. The dog was
bleeding profusely. the propane man said he had never seen anything
like it before, then in a hurry left. Mother took the dog to the vet
where she required stitches to stop the bleeding. There was a perfect V
cut under the dog's tail. The vet said it was a very sharp cut you
rarely see. It was more like a bursted place from an impact. Sharper
than a razor cut. Impossible because the dog had been inside, and we
lived a hundred yards from the highway. Once at night the dogs were
barking, My Mother looked out back, and saw what appeared to be a small
fog moving alongside a creek that ran along behind the house. She shot
at it, but of course made no difference. Until that time I believed
there was a logical explanation for all things. It made me wonder to
say the very least. These were only a few of the strange events at this
place. Once when in Lexington my Mother met a lady who owned a store,
and in conversation found out she had strange experiences there also.
The last I heard one of her son's ,was a deputy in Lexington if anyone
would like to investigate this. In fact the last time I passed the
house it appeared someone lived there. I think it is Hwy 12. I hunted
all the time, all around there, and never saw any strange footprints.
In fact we called the Constable out there once when something happened,
and he found nothing. Some guessed it might be an old Native American
burial Ground along the creek, or an encampment. Never heard any
stories of death there. Your guess is as good as mine we moved to
Jackson, Ms in 1970. Me, and my brother along with a security guard
East of San Bernadino, Ca heard what sounded like someone in a Latino
type accent , yelling in distress in a small orange packing shed about
midnight, helped him search the place found nothing. If it was someone
playing a practical joke, he sure picked the wrong two to attempt, to
play ghost with. I believe in Jesus with all I have as my Savior for
anything like that to bother me. I'm saved<br>

Years later they made the regular schools and re-stored Fairhope In
another version.The alotment were the one rooom school house had been
they built a house.Many families lived there.But then a family of 3
later moved in during the 1980's.The family had a father,son,and
daughter.The dad hung himself in the garage due to depression.The house
went to the kids' will and had to use for it.It went up for sale.No one
wanted to buy the beautiful house just because the garage was
haunted.The lights would go on,off,on,off.Plus the door of it would
open and close repeatedly.So once a man bought the house,he tore down
the garage.The house later got rented to an old couple in their
50's.When my mother was probably 7-8 1/2 months due [with me] they
rented the house.We still say that today the school children,old
man,and when the old couple soon die,they all will haunt my old
parents=P<br>

Our Grandpa Carl Watkins<br>
<br>

<br>
In early November 2006 I went over to visit my grandparent&#8217;s house and
my Grandpa wasn&#8217;t feeling well, he eventually went to visit the
hospital.<br>
I thought he would just get out in a day or so because he survived a
heart attack before. For the first few days I wasn&#8217;t worried at all but
after a week in the hospital I was getting a little worried. About 2
weeks later he passed away, I was stunned. Before his funeral his
brother and sister<br>
came down to visit. While they were sleeping in my grandparents house
(this is 2 days after he died) my uncle was leaving he looked back to
see if things were alright and saw a rather tall figure wearing a hat
walking in a room. At first he thought it was my grandpa&#8217;s brother
Robert but he was fast asleep in a different story of the house. He
went looking in the room and the ghostly figure was gone, we all think
the figure was our Grandpa (he was about 6&#8217;1 and always wore a hat).
Every time my grandma went to go get food or to pick up my little
cousins would get a feeling someone was watching me but in a good way.
In early December I was decorating the Christmas tree and I saw a face
peek out at the top of the stairs at me. It looked exactly like my
grandpa a few years before died. It kind of feels like a little bit of
him follows everyone of us.<br>

Bonito City<br>
<br>
By: severedangel@hotmail.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Bonito City, a rather grand name for the cluster of log buildings that
housed a saloon, post office, schoolhouse, church, general store, a
hotel called The Mayberry House, and a number of comfortable residences.<br>
Set amid lofty peaks twelve miles northwest of Ruidoso, apple orchards
and livestock of the Bonito settlers flourished in the
seven-thousand-foot meadows at the edge of the forests. Trout fishing
was excellent in the Bonito River.<br>
God was in his heaven and all was right with the world, or so it seemed
when two events took place that would cause this serene and pleasant
community to literally disappear. The centerpiece of Bonito City was
the two-story log hotel called the Mayberry House operated by Mr. and
Mrs. John Mayberry. They had three children; John, Eddie, and Nellie.
On the night of May 5, 1885, the Mayberry House leaped into the records
books with one of New Mexico's most bizarre crimes.<br>
Earlier that evening a number of miners ate supper there and left. Only
two guests had rooms, Dr. R. E. Flynn from Ohio and a youth named
Martin Nelson seemed to be pleasant and inoffensive roomers. All were
in bed by ten o'clock. About one o'clock in the morning, Nelson arose
and knocked on the bedroom door of the two Mayberry boys, John awakened
and opened the door, at which point Nelson fired two rifle shots,
killing him instantly. He then turned on the seven-year-old Eddie who
was screaming in bed. Nelson killed him with a single blast.<br>
Dr. Flynn, hearing the shooting, rushed from his room and was shot
through the head. John Mayberry, after hearing the screams, was making
his way up the dark stairs from the first floor when a shot through the
heart dropped him on the landing. Blood was everywhere. Mayberry's
daughter, Nellie, appeared and was shot through the side and left for
dead. She later recovered.<br>
Mrs. Mayberry ran upstairs, where Nelson shot her in the chest but
failed to kill her. She stumbled downstairs with blood streaming all
the way to her feet, leaving bloody footprints visible on the stairs
years later. She fled to the nearest cabin for help, but Nelson
followed, executed her, and threw her body into an irrigation ditch.
Pete Nelson, the saloonkeeper (no relation to Martin Nelson) appeared
on the scene, grappled with the youth but was no match for the
murderer. Mark Nelson shot him to death and left his body bleeding in
the sandy street. The next victim was the storekeeper, Herman Beck, who
came out to learn the cause of the gunshots. Nelson killed him with one
bullet.<br>
Bonito's terrified citizens locked themselves in their homes until
morning while Nelson roamed at large, finally climbing up a nearby
mountain. Next morning, as Charlie Berry, Rudolph Schultz and Don
Campell were standing in the street discussing the murders, they
sighted Nelson returning down the mountain. He saw the men, brought up
his rifle to fire, but was an instant too late. Berry felled him with a
bullet through the heart. Nelson's last shot went harmlessly into the
air as he fell.<br>
Total casualties were eight killed, including the murderer, and one
wounded. It was years before the people of Bonito City recovered from
the shock, and for fifteen years nobody set foot in the log hotel.
Folks said it was haunted, told stories of shrieks and groans in the
dead of night, of seeing lights flicker from room to room, or hearing
muffled shots. Those who peeped through the dusty windows could see the
bloody footprints left by Mrs. Mayberry's feet. The murderer was buried
at Bonito with his head pointed down. Folklorists say this custom was
to prevent the buried person from walking as a ghost. The victims were
also buried in Bonito side by side of each other and a reasonable
distance away from the murderer Martin Nelson.<br>
Gradually Bonito City died. The final blow came when the railroad
arrived on the desert below and took a business like approach to
acquiring water rights in the Bonito Valley and later on buying out the
land in which the remaining residents of Bonito City lived. In 1930
Bonito Dam was built by the Southern Pacific Railroad, the remains of
the victims were moved to Angus Cemetery. A large stone marks their
resting place and as for Bonito City, it is presently resting under
seventy-five feet of water that is now known as Bonito Lake.<br>
Since then, Bonito City has become an old memory and a murder mystery
of the past. Some people have claimed that during a well moonlit night,
they can see the top of the church steeple shining below the serene
resting water of the night. Is it really the church steeple being seen
seventy-five feet below the water surface, or is it a haunting image
reminding us of the presence of the city below? You decide.<br>

The Little Girl<br>
<br>
By: redhotty87@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
I was watching my two nephews one day when this story flashed back
through my head. I heard it when I was around six or seven and later on
experienced it. My aunt and uncle bought a house on around three acres
of land. The only neighbors they had were far off from them, but there
was a small cemetary maybe a couple hundred feet from their house. No
one ever visited it so everyone assumed that it was a family burial
spot for who ever owned the land before. One night, my aunt woke up to
the sound of clacking on the hardwood floors in the kitchen. A few
moments later she heard laughter. She woke up my uncle who told her she
was dreaming and to go back to sleep. A few minutes later the noise had
stopped. She started to drift back to sleep when she felt something
tickling her feet. They had no animals. Agian she heard the laughing.
She then balled up under the blanket and tried to go back to sleep. A
few nights passed with no activity. The next time it happened the same
as before. The sound of little shoes clacking against the floor and
laughter. She woke my uncle agian and this time he heard it. My aunt
said he was stiff as a board listening to it. He tried to brush it off
and told her to go back to sleep. She was laying listening for the
sounds when my uncle quickly jerked his feet from the foot of the bed.
He had felt the tickling too. They were pretty freaked at first but as
time went on they got used to it.&nbsp; <br>
A few years later my older brother and I were visiting with them and we
had heard the stories but never seen or heard anything. My brother was
playing his Nintendo (Yeah it's been a while) he had brought with him.
He paused the game on the third level to go get something to drink.
When he came back the game was playing on it's own with the controler
in a chair. He had been sitting in the floor.<br>
The next time we encountered it my aunt was pregnant. She had gotten
some things for the nursery and was showing them to me. One in
particular i didn't like. It was a clown that you wound up and it would
play music while it's head moved. UGH! Well the thing that wound it up
would unscrew from the back. So after she showed it to me she unscrewed
the thing in the back and put it up. I went to ue the bathroom that was
in the nursery and I heard the music from the clown. When I walked out
of the bathroom it was sittng on the dresser facing me and the thing
that you wind it up with was laying on the floor. Before my aunt had my
cousin some people pulled into their driveway. They knew some people
who used to live in the house. A little girl in particular. They said
that was her grandparents' house and she was a very playful girl. She
loved to play hide and seek and when she would wake her grandparents'
up she would do so by tickling their feet! She was playing outside one
day and didn't see her grand-dad backing out and she ran behind the
car. He hit her and she died on the way to the hospital. After my aunt
gave birth to my cousin her nor my uncle ever experienced anything from
the girl again. And whats even more strange? My grandmother gave me the
wind-up clown!<br>

The Shadow<br>
<br>

Hi my name is Jessica. I was around fourteen when this happened and I
am twenty one now. My parents were gone to my aunt and uncles so I had
the house to myself. YAY! or so I thought. I had a huge stereo system
and like most teenagers had it louder than I should have. It sat on a
counter top between the living room and kitchen. Well there was a
street light that shined into our back yard and when the back door
opened it would shine in on our dishwasher. I had been watching for my
parents to come back when I looked into the kitchen. I saw the light
shining in from the door.(There were no windows at or around the door)
I quickly muted the music expecting to hear my parents fussing about
the music being so loud, but heard only the back door close. I waited a
few seconds (thinking maybe it was them trying to scare me) before I
got off the couch. I eased into the kitchen and stopped in my tracks.
Something very tall and dark went from the door into my parents room.
At first I thought it was my imagination. That I was freaking myself
out because it was dark outside and I was expecting my dad to jump out
from around the corner and get a good laugh. I stood there a few more
seconds waiting. Then the door to their room started to close. And this
door was pretty heavy. It had to be pushed hard for it to close on it's
own. I stayed frozen and was absolutely stunned. The door was about a
10 to 12 inches form being completely closed when it slammed. And I
mean SLAMMED! It knocked some kind of decoration my mom had hanging in
the wall at the time OFF. Totally freaked I ran out the front door and
down to my neighbors house. I called my parents from there and told
them to be careful when they went into the house, that someone may be
in there. When they got home there was nothing. The thing hanging on
the wall was still on the floor but my parents door was wide open. Just
remembering this is making me shake all over. This has to be the most
frightening thing that has ever happened to me.</big></b><br>
