<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Haunted Places Listing<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: mcflystyle@gmail.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I am writing in hopes that I
can provide information regarding one of your Haunted listings in your
database. But first, I'll give a little background on myself. I'm a 20 year old
English Professional Writing major junior attending </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Slippery Rock University</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">PA</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> (www.sru.edu). And I've never beleived in ghosts
until this happened to me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Early last Fall, my good
friend told me about Snyder Cemetery in Butler County, PA and it's alleged
hauntedness. He, our other mutual friend, and I decided to visit it one Friday
night. We drove up to the entrance, parked his truck and brought a few lighters
and a scented candle (the only things we had in the car that would emit light.)
and ventured in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We as a group innitially
found nothing out of the ordinary in the way of activity. I however started
hearing unhuman moaning coming out of the surrounding trees. My two other
friends didn't hear them, however, when I asked them if they hear it, even as
it was going on. Still skeptical, (it surely was some kind of animal, I told
myself) I ventured around to the rusted iron gate in the back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As soon as I opened the
gate, I felt as if I had walked into a wall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I've been in a life and
death situation before (my arm was severed by a large peice of glass when i was
young), and I know what it's like feeling/knowing that I may die. I had the
same exact feeling as I walked through the entrance. I physically, for the
first time that night, was scared. Beyond scared, petrified. It was now dark. I
creeped forward and lit my lighter to read a gravestone. I couldn't read it
because of my shaking and instinctual fear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After about 15 seconds in
the enclosed graveyard, I quickly exited.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Then the real problems
started.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As I went back to my friends
who were standing at the entrance, they both decided it was best to leave.
Apparently they were bored. We walked out through the entrance, and got into
his truck, a late 90's GMC pickup. The truck wouldn't start for about 5 turns
of the key.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Eventually it did start. Then the truck's
headlights started flickering extremely rapidly but "randomly" from
High to low beam; as if being controlled by a person. We started barreling down
the gravel road, in fear of whatever it was doing this. Imediately we noticed
that a dense, zero visibility fog had come around our truck. We could only see
about 3 inches past the headlights, and only the outline of the road.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Burton</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> road extends for probably about 2 miles either
direction out of the cemetery. For that entire stretch, we had no visibility
due to the fog,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and the truck's lights
were behaving erratically as previously noted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As soon as </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Burton</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> ended, and we were on the main road, the fog
dissapeared, and the headlights were fine and have been ever since. No areas
that we drove through to get home had fog, and his lights haven't acted that
way since.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I've returned 5 times with
other friends. In summary, these are the things we have experienced:<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Cell phones go out as soon
as you get onto </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-family: Arial;">Burton
  Road</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-family: Arial;">. No
service from 4 different providers, including Virgin, Nokia, Verizon, and
Tracphone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Drums. This is sometimes
listed on other sites, but not on yours. Odd, "bassy" but wooden
sounding drums are heard. Not like a bass kick drum, but more of a wardrum
sound, playing simple war beats.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Sounds of heavy creatures,
peoples, or whatever entities in the woods, snapping sticks, walking, in trees,
etc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When pulling out, a feeling
of tugging or extra weight on the car. As if we were riding the brakes, or we
had about 500 pounds in the trunk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I hope any of this will be
helpful in your listings on your hauntings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Red eyes will chase you out.
Also, something else could chase you out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It is Conrad Snyder who is
haunting his family's resting place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Don't Believe in Ghosts<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: tober_x@yahoo.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It's kind of weird, I don't
believe in ghosts and all that stuff but some of the things on here kinda freak
me out... the whole noises and stuff thing.. anyway...<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">What brought me here was a
bad link out, but I read through anyway. I am from the northeastern part of Pa
and saw the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">elmhurst</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> road one. When I was a kid, maybe 14ish, we all used
to go up there because of all the tales. A woman who was supposedly killed on
"dead mans curve" on her wedding night, animal sacrifices, satanic
rituals. One night while we were up there, we stopped towards the end (we came
in through the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">scranton</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> side) and the fog started rolling in pretty thick.
We got back in the car to leave and started driving away and the headlights hit
something in the woods with these bright green eyes, be it a deer or whatnot.
It scared the f**k out of me. It was just weird, like the entire time we were
there, we were being watched or something. Too many rumors abound that place. I
have never heard of the one with the truck that is mentioned, but I'll be sure
to pass it along tomorrow at work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Thanks for putting up
something like this. I know that it takes a lot of time and effort to do a
webspace. It was informative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Presence from Hell<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: cher_8383@hotmail.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have been reading the
stories on this site for a while and I would like to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">share one of the many
experiences I've had. This was without a doubt one of<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">the most terrifying
experiences of my life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Now as a little bit of back
story I have been aware of the other realm and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">it's inhabitants all my life
also my mother, her mother (my nana) and her<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">mother (my Great Nana) have
as well. I have been in tune with the entities<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">that are among us my entire
life. So, to say that this particular event<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">scared the hell out of me is
saying alot. But I think the only reason it<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">scared me so much is just
because it happened to someone I love and it hit<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">so very close to home. I
want to make it very clear that I am in absolutely<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">NO WAY being dishonest, here
is my story...<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My boyfriend and I had just
recently gotten together and had only been<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">dating a few months. We were
housesitting his parents house while his<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">parents were out of town and
we were sleeping in his parents room. Also we<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">had just gotten our dog
(that was a puppy at the time) a week before. This<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">is all relevant to the
story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It was a Sunday and things
had felt very different that day, not normal, and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I had taken a nap during the
day which for me is just simply not something I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">do. But it was a good thing
that I did and I found out why later. As the day<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">turned to night, around </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="23"><span style="font-family: Arial;">11 P.M.</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;"> I tried to get my boyfriend to come to bed<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">with me. He was acting weird
and said that he would be coming to bed really<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">soon. Now, like I said it
was around 11 and anyway I went to bed and I ended<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">up jolting awake at 10
minutes till 5 in the morning. I remember because I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">looked at the clock. Anyway
my boyfriend had not not come to bed yet and all<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">the lights were still on in
the house. But, I disregarded it and I laid back<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">down then I heard him coming
down the hall and get into bed. When he laid<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">down he obviously sounded
very tired and he said (in an almost dazed voice)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">that there was a man outside
the front window of the house that he and the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">dog both saw this person and
they didn't like the way the guy looked. He<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">also said that he had just
taken a sleeping pill. Now, my boyfriend kept<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">telling me to look out the
window. At this point I was getting freaked out<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">because my boyfriend says
there is a weird looking guy outside and he just<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">took a sleeping pill. So I
told my boyfriend I was going to call one of my<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">friends that is expertly
versed in the ways of the supernatural, and when I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">told him that he started
saying "no, don't call her" and at that point I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">immediately called her. Now
while I was on the phone with her my boyfriend<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">shot upright in the bed and
started repeating the phrase "when all the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">lights go out" he just
kept repeating it and then as he was half way through<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">saying the phrase his voice
changed into the most demonic sounding voice I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">have ever heard in my life.
I have never moved so fast in my life, I turned<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">on all the lights and went
to the living room. I was just watching the hall<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">to see if my boyfriend came
after me. I was trying to decide if I should go<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">to my car but I was under
the impression that someone was out there so I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">felt trapped. But I finally
got enough courage to get to my car (and I never<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">saw anyone outside and to
this day i still firmly believe the man who my<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">boyfriend saw was the demon)
as I sat out there trying to call one of my<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">friends to come to the house
so that I wasn't alone my boyfriend kept<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">calling me from the house.
Now, he kept saying on the phone that he couldn't<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">move, yet he was able to
call me. Our dog was very small and in a big deep<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">box at the time he kept
telling me that our dog was in the hall and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">bleeding, that he was scared
and he needed me. I knew things sill weren't<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">right and then before I knew
it he was speaking and laughing in that demonic<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">voice again. Finally around </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="6"><span style="font-family: Arial;">6 A.M.</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;"> my friend showed up and he escorted my<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">into the house. When I got
back to the bedroom my boyfriend was passed out<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">and I went up to him with my
blessed cross, and remember he's passed out, I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">opened his hand and
everytime I got the cross two inches from his hand he<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">would close his hand. My
friend saw that his eyes did not move and were<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">closed and he was not awake.
If I had not had a witness there I wouldn't<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">believe it myself. Then as I
turned my back and started to walk away he woke<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">up and started laughing in
that voice and telling me to get out. Then I told<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">the demon that I was aware
of what it was trying to do and then my boyfriend<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">passed out again so my
friend and I left the house because i had to go to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">work. Well later that day my
boyfriend called me asking why our dog was in<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">it's box in the bathtub with
the water running? I had not done that and he<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">obviously didn't do it
either. But when I started talking about the events<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">of the night he didn't
remember any of it. But he did talk to his mom and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">she said that a same thing
had happend to his dad many years before. I knew<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">that there was something in
that house but what had visited that night was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">NOT it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

ENCOUNTERS CALL THEM WHAT YOU WISH. I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS AND THAT CAN SEE

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I live in<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Spartanburg</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">S.C.</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> in<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a 1997
model mobile home. I bought the house from a repo place a couple of years ago .
What I was told by the man who sold me the house was that an elderly man and
his wife lived here and when he passed away in the house she could no longer
stand to live in it, so she let it go back to the bank.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Since living here I have had
many things happen to myself and my family. There will be loud knocks on the
back door and no one there, knocking on the wall above my headboard. The clocks
in both my kitchen and bathroom have changed time by themselves in the same
night. He doesn&#8217;t like it when my boyfriend and I argue because when that does
happen there will be knocks and one time 2 light bulbs in the same fixture blew
out rather dramatically, sparks and all within minutes of each other. He is a
pleasant type energy, he just likes his peace and quiet I guess. He moves
things sometimes as well, I will find something in a place I know it wasn&#8217;t
before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Also most recently I awoke
with a start because I felt an icy hand on my back. My boyfriend was sleeping
peacefully with his back to me on the other side of the bed. Also you will see
small lights in the house from time to time. I wish that I had a copy of the
photos that I had seen of the house on the internet because there where several
orbs visible in those pictures. That is what has happened thus far, hopefully
you will find it of interest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Well, we had a home<span style="">&nbsp; </span>awhile back, it was built in 1912, the people
we bought it from had, a generation of family who lived there.Anyway, this
place needed alot of work, so my husband gutted the house and we basically re
did the house.The day we started I was on a latter painting, my husband had to
go to get something from the hardware store, I imediately felt someone behind
me. It scared me alot. I have always had something around me wether its a
spirit or ghost im not real sure but im not afraid i think its awesome.... But
this was different ,it followed me in the shower once in awhile, I would here
noises in my kids bedroom.I would go to see what it was and I swear to god I
watched their toys litterally fly out of their TOY BOX!!!!!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband was a little skeptical , untell
our dogs ball flew up our slope of a floor in our bedroom one morning.Our dog
was in the back yard at the time.It scared the hell out of him, and honestly he
doesnt scare easily.Anyway come to find out, a man named Harry, the people that
sold us this house, their son Harry died there in the living room.I still think
though that kids had died there to<span style="">&nbsp; </span>years
ago. The toy box thing still freaks me out.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Haunted Farmhouse<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: cemorse@charter.net<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Well I have read many many
good stories here on this site and I figured it's about time I tell a couple
stories of my own experiences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've had
many experiences but I will post two of them that affected me the most, so here
it goes:<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I grew up on a farm and I
had step brothers and sisters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We lived
in this old farm house that had 4 bedrooms up stairs and I had shared a room
with my step brother who is about a two years younger then me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was 1986 and I was 17 when this
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our room was a small one but
we had two beds in there and the way I had my bed was at the foot end of my bed
was towards the bedroom door, and the my head was about two feet from the wall
because I had a couple rifles, a .22 and my 32 Winchester special.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The night this happened I was sleeping on my
belly with my arms under my pillow, and something woke me up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It wasn't a noise, or light, maybe it was a
dream but I woke up and kind of pushed myself up a little bit with my arms to
look at the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I looked, there
was this figure, a dark shadow or better yet like a silhouette<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and for some reason almost telepathically I
learned that it's just one of my sisters (their room was straight across from
mine on the other side) is just bring in one of the cats to sleep with me
because the cat was keeping them up (we had a lot of barn cats that weren't
allowed in the house).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I turned back
around the way I was before I "woke up" and laid my head back down
and I expected the cat to be put on my bed and the feeling that I got was a
very very comfortable feeling, like 'everything is ok'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few seconds later I felt the weight of the
cat snuggled up to my side, like it was half on my bed and head and paws on my
kidney area of me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I woke up a couple
more times feeling this kitty cat still next to me, I was going to reach around
and pet it but I didn't want to wake her up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After a good night of sleep I woke up and I couldn't believe that the
cat was STILL on my bed and partially on my side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I reached my arm around and I did NOT find
a cat on my bed with me, I found my .22 rifle laying across my back!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was totally confused by this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wanted to confirm that it was NOT me who
put my rifle across my back, so I put it back where I had it before I went to
sleep and to be able to get at it I would have to have gotten on my knees and
reached way over to the corner, and with one arm grabbing it and I couldn't
lift it up at that angle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course
nobody had believed in me, so I just never tell this story except for now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">For my next story I'm going
to say something first as it relates to my story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have what is know my some "sleep
paralysis", I'm sure a lot of you know what this is, when you wake up and
you are mentally awake but you cannot move.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is a VERY terrifying experience.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have heard many theories on this and the one that makes the most sense
to me is by Sylvia Browne.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She says
while you sleep, your soul leaves it's vehicle (your body) and goes wondering
around to various places.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result,
your body wakes up but you can't do ANYthing about it because your soul isn't
back from it's journey to wherever.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">One with the second story:<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After we had sold the farm
my family moved into town, </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ashland</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">Wisconsin</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I decided
that if I wanted to make it in life I had to go to college so I stayed in this
house my parents bought which was very old, not sure what year it was built but
it was one of the first ones built when the town started.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My room was a very small room, about the size
of a large bathroom but it worked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The year
was 1993 and I stayed there through out my college years 'til I graduated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night, again I was sleeping on my belly
and I was in a very deep sleep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Something woke me up, not a noise or light, everything was as dark as it
could get.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It woke me up enough where I
sat up and I was staring towards my door, I couldn't see my door it was so
dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was wide awake and I kept
looking at it, almost as if I was in a trance of some sort.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of a sudden, I got this telepathic like
communication that told me that "everything is ok, you don't have to
worry".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This feeling is the most
bizarre feeling as if someone's mind is with my mind talking to each
other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So then I was told to lay down
and don't be scared, then I got this extremely comfort feeling so I laid back
down except this time I laid down on my left side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I felt someone or something's hand
around my neck and it started to squeeze, and then it cocked my head over the
side of my bed by my neck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mean
while<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried my HARDEST to yell or
scream to wake someone up but all that would come out of my mouth was a little
girgal sound that no one could here except for myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was extremely terrifying, then I had the
feeling of high voltage electricity that make this humming and buzzing sound
and feeling through out my entire body.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I then woke up in the morning in that exact same position that it left
me in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">So those are the somewhat
short versions of my two stories, I have many more like them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thank you for taking the time to read them, I
tried to make them as short as possible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You can email me at cemorse@charter.net if you want to share a story or
have anything like my experiences that you would like to talk about.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">During my college years, my
brother and I lived in an old brownstone in south </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Minneapolis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
apartment itself was large and sublevel with 2 bedrooms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the moment we moved in, we knew there
was something wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On nuimerous
occasions, I saw someone in my hallway, moving across the rooms, out of the
corner of my eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I always thought it
was my eyes playing tricks on me initially, but then stranger things began to
occur.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We began to have out
television turn itself on at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
stereo would do the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would be
sleeping at night and it would jsut start blaring.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My bedroom was the
worst.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was uncomfortable, I became
afraid to sleep in there, I could not describe the feeling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I began sleeping out in the living room on
our futon.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, I told myself to
stop with the silliness and resigned myself to sleep back in the bedroom
again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did so, very uncomfotably for a
few nights, only to be awoken one night by a man's disembodied head hovering
above me,smiling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I still very clearly
remember it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I screamed as loud as I
could and took off out of that room, and never slept in it again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We moved out after 6 months of living there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">One night, early in the
morning hours, my daughter wakes up because someone is calling her name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The voice is calling, "Mrs.
Browning,.....Ms. Browning.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She wakes
up, looks around.......nobody there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
next night, again in the early morning hours, the baby wakes her up
coughing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As is the norm in her house,
she takes baby into the living room, where she decides to put some vapor rub on
the baby to help ease the coughing, stuffiness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is very little vapor rub left in the jar, and my daughter decides
she will probably have to make a visit to the doctor's office the next
day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 3 a.m., my daughter wakes up
because her eyes are burning, and her arm.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The baby is lying on her chest still asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She finds herself covered in vapor rub, even
on her eyes, in her hair and on her arms.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When she checks the baby, there's a glob of it on the back of her head,
and it's in her ears, and arms as well.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She looks over at the side table by the sofa where she left the jar of
vapor rub, and it is not there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
searches the sofa cusions as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
vapor rub jar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As she picks the baby up
and heads to the bathroom to take a shower,....there in the middle of the
living room floor is the jar, lid closed, jar as empty as it was before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: mx6-pak@msn.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I came across the old hospital about 19 or 20
years ago while riding my dirt bike in the woods. I had no idea what it was. I
walked through every room of every one of the three large buildings that were
there. You would not believe the things that were left behind, a old army
surplus X-ray machine, still in the box. I came across still full bottles of
medication, the type with the alum. top with the cork center, for the injection
needle. I still have the med. bottle. At that time, you could safely go through
just about every room in any building. But since that time the buildings have
been burned. I've been told it was by the Monson fire dept. using the building
for practice, but I don't <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">know for sure. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Also, there is another place in Monson that is
haunted. If I remember the address corectly, it's on main St.. From what I was
told, it's the house originally ouned by the former ouner of Zero corporation.
A very old manufacturing </span><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Co.</span></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> in Monson. After they moved, it became a nursing
home. This was a very long time ago. After that, the house sat unused for a
very long time. Untill two local builders thought of turning it into a bourding
house. At that time I was working second shift in a machine shop in Monson. I
met the two while having a beer after work, and they were looking to have
someone who might be interested in living there cheap, to keep an eye on the
place nights. As they had a lot of tools and things in the house. I was tied of
traveling from </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Springfield</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> to Monson every day, so I agreed to move in. They
had completed the renivations on the southern top floor. So that is the area I
moved into. It consisted of a large room that I used for a kitchen and living
room, a sliding door that led into another large room that I used for a
bedroom, and a door that led out to a hallway. Just into the hallway, was a
small bathroom on the right. The bathroom comsisted of a small sink, a toilet,
and a bathtub with a shower. Ther was also a small window which overlooked the
back yard of the house and the old horse barn. because on the landscape, this
window was three story's high. The lock on this room was only a eye bolt, and
hook type. So once you went in and locked the door, it could only be unlocked
by someone in the room. if it was forced, you couldn't close the door and then
lock it behind you. On the first occation, I had gone in the bathroom, shaved,
and then began to shower. Half way through my shower, the water preshure
dropped and the water turned ice cold. I rinsed off as fast as I could, and
turned off the water. I then heard the sound of water still running. I then opened
the curtin and saw the door was still locked from the inside, but the hot water
was on in full in the sink. This was a old style sink, like a outside fousit
that you can turn maybe four or five complete revolution from full on to full
off. It was full on. For about a week after that I kept telling myself that I
must have left the sink on before getting in the shower, but I also NEW I
didn't. Well a week or so later, the same thing happened again, and believe me,
I made sure the water was off before takeing a shower after the first time.
This time, as soon as I felt the water pressure drop, and the water was like
ice, I ripped open the curtin, and again the sinks hot water was on full, the
door was locked from the inside, and there was no way anyone could have come
through the window, because on both occations, the window was locked from the
inside. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I moved out shortly after. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>If you know anyone who would be willing or
able to anolise the contense of that Med. bottle that I found at the old
hospital, I would be willing to let them do it. Let me know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">There is a large home in
Martin that I lived in for 20 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
used to be a carriage stop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first
day I was moving in, there was a woman in a black high collared dress peering
out at me and my Mother, the curtain was being held back, and she was fiddling
with the broach on the collar of her dress.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Once inside the house, it
appeared to be a bundle of gray dusty rags floating in the air close to the
ceiling, it swooped down under a doorway, and went out thru the window.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It has been seen many times
in the road in front of the house, a man in a black coat with a high collar
holding a lantern and swinging it back and forth as if to lead the way for
persons passing thru.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Sleeping on the couch one
afternoon, a little girl in a blue dress was standing in front of me, I could
not see her face, but she seemed real sad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Lying in bed at night and
sometimes in the morning, footsteps can be heard walking up the stairs, you can't
move, you feel a weight that holds you still, all you can see is the boots of a
large man, he looks into every bedroom, and then goes back downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You can then move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the parlor you can hear a party going on,
and while that is going on, you hear a baby crying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When my Mom and I were sitting in the dining
room, we both saw objects being thrown across the laundry room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You feel cold, and get goose bumps throughout
the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

Day<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Well, I have been addicted
to your site since I first came across it - I am really into this kind of thing
and have shared it with a few of my friends - so, thanks - it's nice to know
you are not alone....no pun intended.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Okay, I kept thinking over
and over I should write, but I haven't been able to decide which experience to
share.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I myself have been able to sense
paranormal activity and have actually even communicated starting at a very
early age - just for a little background on myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This particular incident
happened about a year ago at my friends' house (which by the way she is going
to have an investigation done this fall because of her home being haunted), she
had a physic come and do tarot card readings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was on a Friday evening and there was around 15-20 people
present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not everyone was able to get
their reading done because it was going well into the night - I was the last
one to have a reading done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to
say, we all were tired and the physic had finished my reading and left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, we previous to this had discussed how in
her home we will see movement out of the corner of our eye, cabinet doors being
open in the kitchen when no one is around to open them and even the stereo
turning on full blast when no one is even near the basement to cause this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have also gotten this very distinct
presence of an older male in his late 60's and a younger one in his late
20's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her 10 year olds son came to me
about his friend "spectre" who he sees from time to time all
throughout the house - "spectre" is who I believe is the younger male
I sense, he is dressed in a civil war uniform according to her son - let me
state that her husband and myself do not believe either one of these are evil
and will cause no harm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Back to that
night, my friend, her husband and myself were sitting in their living room
discussing the evening and our readings when I started having one of my
"feelings".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now it's not easy
to explain these "feelings" that I get, but when I get them anyone
who knows me, knows these are no joke.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's
an VERY uncomfortable feeling that comes over me,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turn a ghostly shade of white, my heart
pounds fast, I start to pace and I start shaking my hands, almost in a way like
I am trying to shake something off and the only thing I can concentrate on is what
I am "feeling" at the moment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This time however was unlike any I have ever had before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The feeling was so overwhelmingly strong - I
actually started becoming taken over with this feeling of love, comfort and joy
- almost like I could burst with happiness - the only thing that was totally
amazing is the message was for her and or her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All I could do was stand in the middle of the
living room and smile and proceed to tell them that "all will be okay",
"don't be afraid" and try to share the enormous amount of relief, joy
and love that I was feeling coming with this message.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, while this is happening I started seeing
the person this message was coming from, at first they both thought it was
someone different they were related to.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then we realized it wasn't a grandfather or uncle, it seemed to be the
elderly man I always sense was around.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was a smaller man, maybe 5'10, wore a brown felt hat, a light brown
and tan tweed jacket with brown pants and brown dress shoes - his outfit
reminded me of something my grandfather would have worn to church in the
1950's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was ecstatic that he was
finally able to communicate with someone and share with them to not be afraid
in their own home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While I am in my zone
and they are somewhat freaked out - they told me they felt the feelings I was
expressing to them and that the whole time though the hair on the back of their
necks stood at attention and their bodies were covered with goose bumps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crazy thing is it was over almost as
quick as it started - the experience left us smiling and yet a little bit of
mind blown.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The following ghostly
experiences occured during a recent family vacation to </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Colorado Springs</span></st1:City></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While they
are not concrete evidence of the paranormal, they do offer strange
coincidences...<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The first experience comes

view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also reported to be
haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While wandering through the
mansion, we came to a room known as the solarium, which used to be an operating
room when the mansion was used as a tuberculosis ward by the Sisters of
Mercy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sister sat down in a chair and
reported difficulty breathing, like her throat was being constricted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It lasted for a few seconds, and then
disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom chalked it up to the
altitude, since this was our first full day in the mountains.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, it had not happened before, and my
sister did not complain of it afterwards.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After a while, we went up to the gift shop on the fourth floor, where we
ended up talking to the woman behind the register about ghostly encounters in
the castle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My dad mentioned that my
sister had had trouble breathing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
woman told us that other people had experienced that as well, and then proceded
to tell us this story:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the Sisters
of Mercy were running the mansion, a nun had hung herself in the solarium.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same room where my sister had had
difficulty breathing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Our other encounter came
from driving up through the mountains via </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-family: Arial;">Gold Camp Road</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-family: Arial;">, which is also reported to be haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People have reported seeing mysterious
handprints on their cars while driving through the tunnels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We drove through the tunnels, but we didn't
see any handprints appearing on the windows, and didn't notice anything
strange.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We arrived at </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Cripple Creek</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> for lunch, and then went out to a local
cemetery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was at this point that my
dad went around to the back of the car to get a fresh video tape out of the
trunk, and saw something unusual.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
window was the clear outline of four fingers, starting from the bottom of the
window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was as if someone had taken
their hand, caked it in dirt, and pressed their fingers against the
window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The entire outline was filled
with dirt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rest of the car had been
splattered from the road, but nothing like the finger outlines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We determined that the print did not belong
to any of us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon closer examination of
the car, we found another handprint on our left taillight, which looked like
someone had been clawing at the back of our car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were a few finger prints, a palm print,
and a thumb.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sister found a couple of
small prints on her window as well, one of which did not appear to come
off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot be sure of the origin of
these prints, but all we can say is that the hands are not ours, and the prints
were not there before we got onto </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-family: Arial;">Gold Camp Road</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-family: Arial;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We live right down the
street from grey rd. and have been there several times. I have sevaral
different experences, one time we had about 6 people in a large jacked up truck
sitting off the road beside the bridge and the truck started shaking
tremendously we all felt it. On other nights we would be sitting in the same
place and would have the lights cutting off and on, sometimes the car would
even go dead as we were just driving by slowly. The last time I went it was
halloween 2004, it was myself , my boyfriend and another couple. We had parked
in a new neighborhood that they are building (have been for quite a while)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>beside the bridge and barn, my boyfriend got
out and was looking around and are lights kept cutting out.He Thought we were
doing it on purpose and wanted to leave. so we got in the car and we were
leaving we went down to the stop sign and decided to turn around one more time.
we were going about 25 mph when we heard something running toward us very fast
the only way i can descibe it is it was like a horse running at us kicking up
leaves and breaking sticks .IT sounded like it was about to come through the
car but we couldn't see anything We all started freaking out and took off.We
got half way down the mile rd and decided to go back to see what it could have
been there was Nothing there.We have not and will not go back. </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-family: Arial;">Grey Rd</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-family: Arial;"> is 100%<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Yes, my name is Jamie<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and I live in a rural town, a college town,
called Clarion, PA. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">With that said, let me tell
you of the most FRIGHTENING experience I have EVER gone through in my entire
life dealing with ghosts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When I was younger, we lived
at a residence in which I live 4 blocks from at this moment. And, within this
PRECISE home, we had hauntings on a regular, daily basis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The hauntings were so bad,
that I would wake up with unexplained bruises and scratches on my face, neck
and back, while ALSO being woke up out of a dead sleep by something choking me.
(NO JOKE!)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My brother would wake up in
the middle of the night, and there would be a entity standing near his closet
door. He would jump, startled, get out of his bed, and turn to look in the
mirror, and there was a entirely DIFFERENT entity staring back at him. It was a
man, with a beard and a weird looking hat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">That's just the
beginning!!!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We would hear footsteps
EVERY SINGLE NIGHT walking up and down the hallway staircase, and once in a
while, we would hear DEFINITE scraping of feet on the floor. (After we would
hear the noise, we would attempt to go down the stairs, only to be frightened
by the bones that we would feel pertruding from the walls. (ALSO, NO JOKE!)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The ghosts were so scary, we
left one day to go to a family outing, and before we left, we made sure that
our house cat was well taken care of with his food and water. We made sure ALL
the doors were SECURELY shut and the windows and what not were all locked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When we came home, we
couldn't find our cat, which name was Fuzzy. As a last resort, we checked the
basement. And, NO LIE, there he was, with a chain wrapped around his neck,
hanging. NO ONE broke in, ALL the doors were locked and bolted, and NO windows
were broke into.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The final straw was when we
heard THE most LOUDEST noise one night around 12:30-1AM coming from outside of
our bedroom (My sister and I shared a room),..and we ran to go see what it was,
and our door was LOCKED! Mind you, we had NO LOCK on our door. Finally, after
begging God to help us REPEATEDLY, the door opened. (After about 15 minutes of
crying and screaming.) Then, we ran to our parents room only to be grabbed and
told to start heading down the stairs. Our parents were FREAKED OUT! We caught
a glance for about 2 minutes into their room only to see a BLOOD SPOUT
streaming from one side of their bedroom wall, to the other. (NO
JOKE!!!!!!!!!!!)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">That was enough for all of
us! The next day, my mother and father decided to look for another house to
move to. Needless to say, within 5 days, we were SIGNED and ready to go!!!!!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I still worry about who
lives in that house because I have known EVERYONE who has lived in there before
and they have experienced similar hauntings and booked as fast as we did. Now,
there is a family living in their and I am too afraid to ask them about it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I still believe that the
house is TOTALLY haunted and I still feel as though it should be investigated.
It would ease my mind just to know that we aren't crazy and that it is what we
say,.....a DEMON HAUNTED HOUSE.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Im Laura and Im 13 years
old. I strongly believe in the paranormal. After my experience i have grown to
believe in them more. I knew something was in the room with me that night. I
could feel it. I didn't know where it was though. I was probably about 9 when
it first happened. At school we had been telling silly little ghost storys. The
stupid ones that aren't scary which are made up. I could feel something
tickling me. It was strange. I thought it was just me because of the ghost
stories at school. It wasn't. I went underneath my covers and waited. I heard a
sound that sounded as if someone was moving stuff around. I wanted to look and
see what it was but i didn't dare. I was to scared. All of a sudden I heard a
loud screech. I jumped out of bed. Nothing was there. I knew where it had come
from. I looked in my wardrobe. Everything had been moved around. A small shoe
was left at the bottom of my wardrobe. One I had never seen before. I kept it
under my pillow so if anything came back for it I would feel it. A few weeks
later I felt a hand touch my hair. It pulled it slightly. Then it pushed my
head to the sight. My head hit the wall. I woke up and it was there above me. I
white face with black eyes. I'll never forget the eyes. It slowly faded away
into nothing and dropped its shoe on the floor. For some reason it looked
depressed. After that I felt strange. I don't know if it was just me or if it
was the ghost but i kept seeing it and hearing it. I heard voices saying. I'm
coming fotthe shoe tonight, then it would never turn up. Or give me the shoe or
you'll die in your sleep. I carried the shoe with me everywhere but when i
turned round to give him it he was gone. It was playing mind games with me. I
started ti hate leaving the house. I sat in my room all day waiting for it to
come. On the night it did come. Strange things happened. Whenever u opened my
mouth the speak i just screeched. My eyes went blurry. I cried blood from my
eyes. The ghost took his show but decided not to leave me alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As a grew older the ghost
followed me more. He used to make me lose my breath. He followed me and used to
do everything i do. I asked him to leave once. He looked at me. He said no...
now your trapped. I was trapped? He had hold of me. I started to like him being
around which was weird. All though it did make me cry lots i enjoyed watching
him doing everything i do. He hated this. This destroyed him. The more I
laughed at him the more he faded away and grew weaker. Till one day he
whispered his last words.... This isn't over and dissapeared. Now im waiting
for his return.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My name is Cristi and I live
in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Toledo</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ohio</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">. When I was seventeen years old, my best friend
Jenni and I would drive around the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Toledo</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> area all day hanging out after school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was seeing a boyfriend of two years named
Will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Will was a wild one, and Jenni's
mom had forbidden Jenni from seeing him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We drove around so that Jenni could secretly see him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By 1995, Will had taken up
residence in </span><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Bowling Green</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, twenty minutes south of </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Toledo</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had many
friends there and in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Toledo</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">. Then tragedy struck. Around November 24, 1995 (I
don't know exactly the date), something had upset Will, and he drank a large
amount of alcohol, after which he decided to go on a joy ride with four other
friends.....a joy ride at a hundred miles an hour down a curvy road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He died instantly on impact with a utility
pole, along with Amy,who had been in the front seat. The accident report was
printed the next day in the Toledo Blade's borderland Second News Section, but
Jenni and I found out about the accident an hour after it happened from a
friend who had survived by being thrown from the car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Jenni and I decided to break
the news to our circle of friends personally, in case anyone needed a hug or a
shoulder to cry on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We knocked on all the doors,
and told everyone the bad news. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">However, Monica was grounded
and no one was allowed to see her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">So we had to call her on the
telephone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We went to Jenni's house and
I was on one phone, and she was on a second one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We dialed Monica's number and waited as the
phone rang.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of the sudden, Will's
voice broke through the rings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
doing one of his famous cartoon character impressions that he had routinely
done in life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">These impressions seeemed to
immediately cheer anyone up who was down.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All of his friends loved it, and the cartoon voices always seemed to
make everyone feel better when he did them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He truly had the gift of laughter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And he was actually trying to comfort us from beyond the grave with his
sense of humor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The voice said:
"Fast as fast can be you'll never catch me! Tee Hee Hee!!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>which was one of his favorite Loony Toons
phrases. As soon as the voice loudly appeared through the telephone line, it
quit, and the phone went back to ringing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Monica finally answered and heard the terrible news.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Since then, Will's voice had
mysteriously shown up in random places in our previously recorded music mix
tapes.....in those recorded BEFORE he died! His voice showed up in the middle
of songs saying "Luv Ya" or "What's up, dudes?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can't explain an apparent EVP recording
over a tape made before a person's death....a tape that was not ever recorded
over again, by the living anyway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
day we just dusted off the old mix tapes to reminisce, and upon playing them,
there he was, clear as day, cutting into the music here and there. The last
apparition was in 1997 or so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hope
he's found peace.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A while ago me and my friend
were doing a project for school and we got to choose what we did, so we did
Ghosts and Hauntings and we used this site and it helped us loads, but anyway,
while we were working our substitute came over and saw what we were doing and
he asked us if we had ever seen a ghost, I think I've heard a ghost crying but
I wasn't to sure and my friend hasn't seen anything, but my sub said that he
had seen one, he said that when he went to look after his nephew once he saw
something, he said that he went round to his brothers house and while his
brother and his wife were getting ready his nephew came downstairs and told his
dad that he had seen "the man with the big hat and the funny glasses"
upstairs, my teacher asked his brother what he was on about and his brother
said that he had seen the ghost again, my teacher didn't belive him but his
brother said he'd seen it upstairs, then when his brother and his bro's wife
had gone his nephew who was only 5 wanted to play football in the garden, so as
they were going through the kitchen his nephew said that "the man with the
big hat and funny glasses" was behind my teacher, he freaked out and was
scared to death, he said he wanted to just go out of the house but made himself
turn around, he said that he saw a gas like form that had a pilots hat on(an
old one not a helmet like todays) and that the thing was wearing big goggles,
he later found out that his brothers house was built on an old airfeild, the
story freaked us out!!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have lived in present home
for 30 yrs. When I go thru certain spots in the house I feel cold-there is a
presence that you can feel. The ghost of a blond haired boy has presented
himself to my children.who are now adults. but still speak of playing with the
blond ghost, named Bobby. My ex husband,who believes in nothing,swears there is
a ghost here that doesn't like men. He was by himself here one night in the rec
room when a piece of the ceiling fell,barely missing him.a few seconds later,he
said he heard something in the adjoing bath,which turned out to be a split in
the glass shower door, from on corner to the other. I did get a picture about a
year ago that is like a glare of light.I believe there is a man &amp; a boy
here that looks over me. I consider them my "angels".At the time of
the incident with my ex, the children &amp; I were living elsewhere,when we
came back my husband had no more incidents,so he came to the conclusion it did
not like men. The ghosts have been quiet for some time now,but when things get
in a turmoil here ,they don't like it &amp; will be back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: igrassini@hotmail.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">First I love your Web site.
I've read all the ghost stories and it's got the best site on the net.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My first story is not really
about a ghost, it's more about a spooky dream I had that came true.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When I was about six or
seven months pregnant with my son I had a dream about my next door neighborhood
telling me she was pregnant with a baby boy who was going to be here in January
(the dream happened in April). When I woke up that morning, I didn't think much
of this dream since I had so many crazy dreams during my pregnancy. A few weeks
later, I was in my front yard talking with that same neighbor while she was
watching her daughter play in the sprinklers. She told me that she just found
out she was pregnant and due in January. I couldn't believe it. I had to sit
down when she told me this. I told her about my dream and she couldn't believe
it either.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">About three or weeks went by
and I had another dream about the same neighbor, this time is was not a good
dream. I dreamt that her husband came to my front door and told me the baby is
no more (he spoke in the same way their three-year-old daughter talked). After
I woke-up I kept this dream to myself, because who wants to hear bad news like
that. The only person I told was my husband who laughed at me for being a
weirdo. A few days later, my husband called me at work to tell my this same
neighbor had been bleeding and cramping all day and her husband had taken her
to the hospital and he (my husband) was watching their daughter for the
afternoon. I was stunned. My neighbor did end up miscarrying (don't be sad, she
got pregnant again a few months later and gave birth to a healthily baby girl
the following October). I never did tell her about my second dream.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My other story is kind of
another kind of spooky dream regarding my deceased mother.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My mom passed away when I
was very young (19). The night before she passed away I was at my boyfriend's
house (now my husband). I was taking a break from spending time with her at the
hospital (she had been sick for many years and in and out of the hospital most
of my childhood). We were watching something on TV and I fell asleep on his
sofa. I started dreaming that I was talking with my mom (she was in a coma at
the time). In the dream she was lying down on our old couch (in the house I
grew-up in) and we were talking about her being sick and having to leave me and
my brother. She told me that everything was going to be ok. I don't remember much
about the conversation, but I felt very comfortable talking with her and we
talked for a while. Then all of a sudden, she yelled at me to wake-up and go
home. Then I suddenly woke-up and saw that the time was past midnight. My mom
hated me being out past midnight. So, I went home and the next day my father
pulled the plug on her life support. It's been over 10 years, but I will never
forget that dream. It still give me comfort to this day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">i actually have 2 stories,
some people call them hust that too, stories. i will tell them to you and let
you make your own decision. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">1. when my daughter was only
4 we lived in an old house. at night i would hear a sound like a bouncing ball
in the hallway. the next morning i asked my little girl about it and she said
it was her friend. i figured she made that up so she wouldn't get in
trouble.after a few more nights of this i looked in the hall to catch her and
no one was there. a few days later i asked her about her friend. she said he
was looking for his daddy and he was a police man. one night she came to my
room and said she smelled smoke, i went to her room and i breifly smelt it too.
it was like someone was burning wood a few blocks away. i didn't smell it
outside. she said her friend told her the upstairs was on fire. we lived in a
single story home.. anyway, after a long investigation with the libraries help
i discovered the house used to be 2 stories and the residents were a 6 year old
boy and his father who was infact a police man, their house caught fire one
night from a heater and the top floor burned. the man died from smoke
inhalation becausse he went back in looking for his son. he didn't find him
before he died. the boy died in his sleep from smoke. this was in </span><st1:place><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">mississippi</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">2. a few years ago we move
to </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">san antonio</span></st1:City></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> texas. a friend came from </span><st1:place><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">florida</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> and i took her to the ripleys haunted house
downtown. we love a good scare. you tour dark halways with things running
across your feat and people whispering in your ear, all of the greatest scare
tactics... half way through i heard a small child tell me.... i'm lost.. i
whispered back that i would help her/him. the voice was low so i dont know if
it was a girl or boy. the child held onto the back of my shirt. remember it is
very dark and i never saw the child except for a dark shape, the same as my
friend in front of me just smaller. i felt the tug on my shirt all the way to
the end of the tour.. then b4 i could turn around i heard the voice again. this
time it said thank you. i turned and no one was there. i assumed it was a stage
act and spoke to the girl working there. i told her that was an awesome touch.
she told me there was no act like that and asked the manager. he thought i was
making it all up and asked me to leave. i believe someone reached out to me to
help them. maybe it was an actor, i dont know. but when i left my shirt smelled
like baby powder and had that smell all the way home. my friend didn't hear the
voices but noticed the smell.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">thanx for having this sight.
it is nice to know that there are people out there that dont think you are
crazy..one quick question? at night i hear my name being whispered and when i
turn around i notice a light moving, kinda like when u look to long at a light
bulb. i turn back around and see the light coming back out of the corner of my
eye. sometimes i play around and go to the door, and it seams like it peaks
around the corner at me. i never hear any other sounds, nothing breaks or
anything else like in the movies but for a week the stove timer would go off at
different times in the morning. never the same time. finally i got up and said
out loud.. this isnt funny, i have to get some sleep. i will play tomorrow...
my husband laughed for days at me, but it never happened again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">who knows maybe i am loony,
i dont think so. i would like to know what you think if you have time, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My family on my fathers'
side have always talked about things they've seen or felt - it used to be funny
when I was younger listening to them tell their stories then watch fully grown
adults act like frightened children and have to be escorted by one or more of
us children to their cars so they could go home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have seen things that spooked me or at the
least, made me stop and wonder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certain
places will cause an uneasy feeling, some so much I will drive completely
around the spot to evade it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The one story from my family
that has stuck in my mind involves my Uncle Charles: when in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">France</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-family: Arial;"> towards the end of WWII, Charles was driving his
truck, alone, down an unfamiliar road, paying close attention to the
possibility of snipers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For some reason,
he felt a great urge to look over to the passengers seat (which was supposed to
be empty) only to see his father sitting there, "talking" to
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Charles leaned toward his father to
better hear what was being said when a sniper bullet came through the
windshield hitting the back of the seat and going out the back of the
truck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had Charles not leaned closer to
his father, the bullet would have gone through him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, he called his family and was told that
his father had passed away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Passed away
at the same time/day as when he saw him in the truck.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As for myself, a former
supervisor asked that I come to visit her and see what she had been doing to
her house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house was an old
Victorian and she had remodeled every room, taking great care to keep the
Victorian touches on the main floor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I first pulled up in front of her house, I was amazed to
"see" an old man dressed in worn overalls, a flannel shirt, t-shirt,
an old grey-green felt hat and his shoes were very worn, with the toes slightly
curled up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was just standing there
watching me watch him, rocking back and forth on this heels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It isn't like I "saw" him so much,
more like I visualized him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, I
didn't feel any threat so I knocked on my friends door and once inside, she
gave me a tour of her home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While on the
second floor, the first room she took me to was her infant son's room, at the
top of the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I looked into
the room, I again "saw" the old man, standing beside the crib looking
at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A bit of a shock but still no
threat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did notice that when I saw him
outside in the sun, he looked as though he was standing in sun and when I saw
him again inside, he no longer looked like the sun was shining on him but
rather darker, like he was really standing in a room with minimal light.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After about an hours time
had passed, I decided to go home, telling her I would see her tomorrow at
work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I saw her the next day, she
immediately wanted to know if I had "seen" anything at her
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't normally own up to things
I've seen or felt but I did tell her about the man and where I saw him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following day at work she came in with a
small box that had some old photos, pulling one out for me to look at.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was the old man, dressed exactly as I
had seen him!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It turned out that at one
time, her house had been an "old folks home" and this man had lived
in the room her son now occupied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
did tell me that when she would be in the basement she could hear heavy boot
sounds coming from the third floor and when she would run up there (her son, an
infant, was the only person in the house, along with mom) and no one would be
there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My sister lived in a large
house in the country and my husband and myself stayed with her for a couple of
weeks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While never feeling afraid of the
house (it looked friendly) I never felt totally comfortable either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Late one evening I'm walking up the stairs to
go to bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I reached the top of the
stairs and looked down the hallway (long hallway with two doors/rooms on either
side and a window at the end) toward the window, the whole end of the hallway
continued down - not ending, as though the wall was not there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just froze - staring at how long the
hallway was, and wondering what the heck was going on!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had not been asleep, had not been watching
scary movies, did not have heartburn... any of the things they usually say are triggers
to explain sightings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told my sister
about it the following day and she said she could not get any of her dogs or
cats t go into the room across the hall from where my husband and I were
staying and that her cats would follow "something" going up the
stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every once in a while the
fragrance of lilacs would come through - in the winter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two of us always thought it was funny
that other than the animals, no one else saw or felt anything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After she moved from the
house, we found out that at one time, the house had been used as a
mortuary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My husband had an experience
while at an warehouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was guarding
the warehouse from vandals and while sitting down for a long shift, looked down
through the windows to the outside of the main entrance door - to see a man
dressed in old fashioned black clothing, holding his hands up in front of him
(as though he had a book in his hands) and he seemed to be chanting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband was getting ready to call the
police when he noticed a women and her young daughter on the other side of the
entrance!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband got up off the
chair and while not taking his eyes off the man, woman and child, they
vanished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The woman and daughter appeared
to him a few more times.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We often
wonder who they were and what happened to them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Good Girl, Gin<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: falconschild@gmail.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I figured I'd go ahead and
send you my story...bittersweet still, but undeniably odd.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When my husband and I first married, we had
three dogs - two retired racing greyhounds, one male (Sly), one female (Gin)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">- and a female border-collie
mutt (Chewie).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We'd never intended to
wind up with three dogs, but we took in the female greyhound "just for the
weekend" and she wound up staying on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her name when she was racing was Twilite Gin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She'd had a rough time of it after she'd been
retired, and came home with us after her first home just didn't work out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we first got her, she didn't know what
the words "good girl" or "good dog" meant...she'd just
stare at you blankly when you praised her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We resolved that we would teach Gin what "good girl"<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">meant, and in time, she came
to know how to play, how to have fun, and how to smile at you, tail wildly
wagging, when you told her she was a good girl.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We'd had Gin for a year and
a half...and suddenly, she became ill, losing her normal graceful
coordination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our vet, bless his heart,
tried everything to figure out what was the matter with her - X-rays, blood
titers, you name it...he was in constant communication with the state's
veterinary university on the matter and they, too, were baffled by Gin's
inexorable loss of coordination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
just got sicker and sicker and sicker.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Finally, on the night of July 5, 1999, she began bleeding internally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gin looked up at me with those dark brown
eyes and told me she was tired of fighting and wanted to rest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So my husband and I had her humanely
euthanized, ending her suffering and breaking both our hearts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The day after we'd had Gin
put to sleep, neither of us felt like cooking...we missed our girl very much
and were devastated by her loss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we
ordered pizza and tried not to dwell too much on the subject.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After dinner, my husband went upstairs to
check his email, and I prepared bowls for our two remaining dogs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I took Sly and Chewie back into the living
room and put their bowls down so they could eat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I returned to the kitchen, I turned to
put the leftover pizza in the refrigerator.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While I had my head buried in the refrigerator, I felt a greyhound
nose-bump the back of my knee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned
to see what Sly wanted...only to find that I was alone in the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both dogs were still in the living room
eating, and my husband was still upstairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I could only smile, knowing
that the nose-bump was Gin's way of telling me that she was okay, and a thanks
for what we'd done for her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I have always appreciated the gentle good-bye
bump from the ghost of our good girl.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ghost Sighting in my House<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: Vanessa1@bigpond.net.au<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I am only 13 yrs old now but
at the time of the sighting I was about 9 or 10, maybe more. I am not sure. I
still live in the same house and aren&#8217;t really bothered other than the black
thing, but for now I will talk about a different ghost. I was early in the
morning, I am not sure of the date, or even the year. But I was wondering down
the stares to the ground level of the house from my bedroom to the living room
to play some Nintendo 64, when I happened to glance up the hall and froze in
shock as I saw a tall White cloaked figure that slowly stepped out of the
dinning room and into the narrow hall. It slowly wondered across to about half
way then stopped, its face was hidden from me the whole time and it slowly
turned its face to me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Before I had time to really
see what I was seeing it vanished in the middle of the hall. After that I
immediately ran back upstairs, either to my parents room or my own, it was a
long time ago, I don&#8217;t remember the detail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It surprises me it looked so
solid. As though I could run down and touch it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The next sighting is of a
black, again cloaked figure that I only see at night. It used to appear every
night, several times, I never got used to it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It would always do the same
thing; swiftly walk across the gap between the door and the wall. I could
always see it from my bed. It would frighten me very much; it still does still
come, less regally now. In my room I had a night-light, come on! I was young!
And mother would leave the light in the hall on so I could see it I went to the
bathroom, we also that one on also.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">So really the place at night
was lit up very well. I doubt it was a figure of the imagination as it kept on
walking that same meter or two, every night for as long as I can remember.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the days of Vaudeville
the NorShor Theatre was a playground for socializing and seedy activity.
Charlie Chaplin married one of his many wives there. People often see a sleazy,
dark-haired man ascending the staircase dressed in clothing of the turn of the
century; rumors abound as to whether or not he may have been a murderer.
Someone either fell or was pushed from the balcony of the time, falling to
their death 80 feet below. Perhaps the perpetrator is doomed to revisit the
scene of the crime?<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Other things happen,
too--lights going on and off, etc--but after an X-Mas party one year a the
staff was closing up and turned off the main power switch. At the same time the
upstairs radio turned on, and the theatre was filled with the sounds of Nat
King Cole's "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas". I've been in
the theatre many times--it definitely has a vibe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ok, I'm an 18 year old girl
and live in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ottawa</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">,</span><st1:country-region><span style="font-family: Arial;">Canada</span></st1:country-region></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">. I've lived in the same house my whole life and it's definitely not a
scary house to be in but sometimes I think my house is haunted. For instance,
there have been many occasions where I've been asleep and I'd wake up to the
feeling of someone touching my shoulder or my face and when I'd look to see who
it was, no one was there. There are cold spots in my house,sometimes I hear
unexplainable noises and doors open and close by themselves (although my mom
claims it's "just the wind"). In some photos I take inside my house,
there have been orbs and weird ghostly fogs. Things get misplaced as well.
There have been many occasions where I'd put things down (like my car keys), go
get something and come back and my car keys wouldn't be there anymore and
they'd be in a completely different room. I have cats and sometimes they follow
things with their eyes and I can't see what they're following. They have
freaked out and hissed at things that "aren't there" and one weird
incident was one time one of my cats got so scared she refused to go into my
living room. When I p ked her up (against her wishes) and brought her into the
living room (she was clawing me and howling like mad) she was so terrified, she
peed on me. As far as I could see, there was no one or anything in the living
room to be afraid of.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The scariest and most
unexplainable incident that ever occured happened in October 2003<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It was about 9:30 on a
Friday night and my boyfriend and I were sitting in my basement watching a
movie. We had already decided he was going to sleep over at my house that
night, so after the movie ended, he decided he wanted to go back to his house and
get his contanct lense solution,toothbrush etc. There were 3 people home that
night. Me, my boyfriend and my mom who was on the computer upstairs on the main
level. Anyways, the movie ended and I got up, went and turned off the T.V. In
my basement, there is a furnace room,laundry room and guest bedroom as well as
the open space where the T.V. and couches are. So after I turned off the movie,
I turned off all the lights EXCEPT the laundry room light (I like to leave at
least 1 light on because my basement is so dark and scary haha). As my
boyfriend and I were heading upstairs, the doorbell rang.I was kind of
surprised because I hadn't invited anyone over and by now it was about 10:00.
My boyfriend and I went and answered the door and to our astonishment (and
fright) it was the POLICE! Standing infront of us were 2 policemen shining
their bright flashlights into our eyes. They asked us if everything was ok. I
was still surprised and I told them everything was fine and asked them why they
had come over. They informed us that about 10 minutes prior to them coming
over, they had gotten a 9-1-1 call from my house and when the emergency
operator picked up, there was only a staticky, fuzzy sound. The operator asked
a number of times "can you speak?" "is everything alright?"
"hello?" but there was only the sound of static and other
unexplainable buzzy sounds. The emergency operator decided to call my house
back and the police cla ed that someone had picked up the phone! But again, it
was only staticky, fuzzy sounds. Of course, it's the policemen's duty to check
my house just in case something was terribly wrong. The policemen even read out
my phone number and asked me if that was my house's phone number. It was. They
had obviously traced the call to my house. By this time, my mom had come to the
door and they explained to her what had happened. The 3 of us stood in shock.
First off, no one had been on the phone in a quite a few hours and DEFINITELY
no one had called the police! I was with my boyfriend the whole time, neither
of us called the police (we had no reason to and we're not pranksters) and of
course my mom hadn't called. Anyways, we invited the police inside to see for
themselves that everything was fine but they believed us (well they seemed like
it) and left (but they gave my boyfriend and I a huge lecture on phone pranks
and that dialing 9-1-1- for no reason isn't a laughing matter and blah blah). I
assure you, none of us called the police. After the police left, my boyfriend
and I went into the kitchen and checked to see if my kitchen phone was off the
hook. As were standing in the kitchen, I could hear the T.V. in my basement was
on! I knew that I had turned it off, so to me this was very creepy. I grabbed
my boyfriend's hand and he grabbed my cat (because they see things that humans
can't) and we proceeded down the stairs. When we got down there, sure enough
the T.V. was on and my cat immediately started freaking out the closer we got
to the laundry room. My boyfriend put him down and the cat started hissing and
bolted upstairs. My boyfriend and I were of<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>course scared to death. We were both wondering if someone else was in
the house. As we both started towards the guest bedroom to check it out, I
heard a click behind me. I turned around and the laundry room light had gone
off. Remember, I had left it on. The click I heard was the sound of the laundry
room light being turned off. My boyfriend an I freaked out and ran upstairs.
After we calmed ourselves down, I realised that maybe the light had burnt out.
I decided that if the light switch was still in the 'on' position, it means
that the light simply burnt out. If it was in the 'off' position, someone (or
something) had to have physically turned off the light. We went downstairs and
reluctantly checked the laundry room light switch. To our horror, the light
switch was in the 'off' position! We screamed because we realised that someone
had physically turned off the light and it wasn't either of us. Anyways, those
were and still are the most unexplainable, scariest events that ever happened
all in one night. Needless to say, my boyfriend and I definitely didn't sleep
in the basement that night haha.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The creepiest part is that
only a few months ago, I was across the street borrowing a ladder from my
neighbours. They're a very old couple and have lived in their house since they
were young newlyweds so they have seen a lot of different families live in my
house. I got talking to them which I never usually do and I asked them about
the different families that had lived in my house. They said the family that
lived there before my family had 2 teenage sons and were really nice. But the
family that lived there before them, tragedy struck them. In 1973, it was a
young couple living there with their toddler son. The mom wasn't home one day
but the dad was. He had forgotten to put the little plastic gate up by the
stairs (you know the ones that block any little kids from falling down the
stairs) and the toddler son had fallen down the stairs and died. My neighbour
said that it was tragic and he remembers it just like yesterday because he
vividly remembers talking to the mother about how excited she was to take him
trick or treating for his first Halloween and how she abd her husband were
devastated they wouldn't get the chance. The child's death happened in October
1973. The 9-1-1- call and weird stuff at my house happened i October 2003. I
find that bizarre and very creepy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">So that's my ghost story.
Sleep tight ;)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">hello my name is Nynke and i
lived in a boarding house for a year. There were a lot of stories about the
boarding house being built on a grave yard. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It really scared me and my
roommate but we figured it wouldnt be true and just a made up storie!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We got very scared so we
went to the head of the boarding house and he told us it hadnt been built on a
graveyard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We were very happy to hear
this but there was another storie, a guy who was building block 10 was killed
when he tried to built a wall. People in block 10 told us they had seen him
wondering around and at night they would hear him working on the wall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Me and my roommate were
wondering if our block we lived in had a history as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We found out a girl called
Sarah lived in our room 30 years ago and died of a mysterious death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">That night me and my
roommate were talking when we felt a icy feeling in the room, (we live in a
tropical country so that was really wierd) , we heard knocking on the window so
we opend the blinds and saw a girl, about 17 years old, sitting in the tree
swinging her legs. She was wearing black and was looking rite at us. We couldnt
see her eyes and we were totally freaked out. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I left the boarding house 7
months ago because me and my familie moved to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Australia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-family: Arial;">. My roommate still lives in the boarding house but moved
to a different block.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
