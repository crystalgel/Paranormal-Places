<P><B>Thats My Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: aarasley@webtv.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>As I was reading some of your stories I couldn't help but think of
my</B>
<BR><B>own.&nbsp;&nbsp; Something really creepy happened to me when I was
16.&nbsp; I was</B>
<BR><B>laying in bed just kind of starring at the ceiling when I heard
this</B>
<BR><B>growling sound come from the corner of my room.&nbsp; I looked to
were the</B>
<BR><B>sound was coming from and saw this black shadow, not really in any
shape</B>
<BR><B>or form, creep along my wall and onto my bed.&nbsp; I went to move
but</B>
<BR><B>realized i was parolized, I couldn't move.&nbsp; The shadow then
creeped over</B>
<BR><B>my body and started pressing on my chest.&nbsp; It pressed so hard
that I</B>
<BR><B>couldn't breath.&nbsp; I tried to cry out but I had no voice.&nbsp;
I remember a</B>
<BR><B>tear rolling down my cheek and I just looked up and in my mind I
said,</B>
<BR><B>"Oh Jesus please help me"&nbsp; All of a sudden the thing slid off
my chest</B>
<BR><B>and disappeared into my wall.&nbsp; I remember taking a huge gasp
of air and</B>
<BR><B>leaping off of my bed and running into my living room to find my
mom</B>
<BR><B>still awake.&nbsp; I collapsed onto the coach and my mom grabbed
me and shook</B>
<BR><B>me because I was white as a ghost and sweating.&nbsp; I finally
got the words</B>
<BR><B>out to tell her what had just happened.</B>
<BR><B>>From that night on I could always feel something uneasy in that
house it</B>
<BR><B>almost felt as though that shadow was sitting in the corner of my
room</B>
<BR><B>waiting to pounce.&nbsp; Things in my every day life started happening,
I</B>
<BR><B>would be walking down the hallway in school while it was empty and
hear</B>
<BR><B>someone whisper my name then I would feel it yank on a strand of
my hair</B>
<BR><B>or tap me on my shoulder.&nbsp; This happened on a regular basis.&nbsp;
It's like</B>
<BR><B>the creepy stuff followed me where ever I went.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Finally the day came</B>
<BR><B>when moved out of my parents house, I had my own baby and moved
into a</B>
<BR><B>town house.&nbsp; Things appeared normal for a while until I had
my second</B>
<BR><B>child.&nbsp; They shared a room and in the&nbsp; middle of the night
I would hear</B>
<BR><B>Them playing with their toys.&nbsp; Iwalked into their room tofind
them both</B>
<BR><B>sound asleep and one of there toys in the middle of the room playing</B>
<BR><B>music all by its self.&nbsp; I brushed it off and thought it was
just low on</B>
<BR><B>batteries.&nbsp; But then nights went by and each night it was a
differant</B>
<BR><B>toy that would go off.&nbsp; It seemed as thought the activity was</B>
<BR><B>increasing.&nbsp; One afternoon I put a load of clothes in the washer
and</B>
<BR><B>left my home for about twenty minutes, when I came home I found
my</B>
<BR><B>washer door wide open and the cycle had stopped.&nbsp; This happened
more</B>
<BR><B>then a few times.&nbsp; After a while I started waking up to this
white haze</B>
<BR><B>just a few feet from my face floating above me then disappear into
the</B>
<BR><B>ceiling.&nbsp; Finally, one night I woke up to a young man standing
at the</B>
<BR><B>foot of my bed.&nbsp; He was wearing a jacket and jeans and had
a baseball</B>
<BR><B>hat on.&nbsp; He had his hands in his pockets and was looking down
at the</B>
<BR><B>ground.&nbsp; I sat up and started shaking uncontrolably and started
crying.</B>
<BR><B>I thought to myself this is it, this guy is going to rape me, and
he's</B>
<BR><B>going to kill me.&nbsp; The young man then turned from me and walked
out of</B>
<BR><B>my bedroom.&nbsp; I sat there for about ten minutes in disbelief
and finally</B>
<BR><B>got up and checked through out the house and found that the door
was</B>
<BR><B>still locked and all the windows were still locked.&nbsp; I was
so terrified</B>
<BR><B>and I thought I was loosing my mind, until without telling any of
my</B>
<BR><B>neighbors, they started talking about their "sightings"</B>
<BR><B>My kids now 4 and 3 won't sleep in their room because they say there
are</B>
<BR><B>monsters crawling on their floor and&nbsp; if they do sleep in there
I wake</B>
<BR><B>up to them screaming bloody murder.&nbsp; I don't know if this has
anything</B>
<BR><B>to do with what happened when I was 16 and its following me, or
if its a</B>
<BR><B>whole new experiance.&nbsp; Thats my story.&nbsp; Thanks for listening.</B>

<P><B>St. Paul Capital Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ssmith@toddvnm.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>One night last January my friends and I were driving around looking
for the</B>
<BR><B>St. Paul Winter Carnival Medallion. This is a "treasure hunt" put
on by the</B>
<BR><B>local paper in which clues are released leading you to a blue hockey
puck</B>
<BR><B>medallion worth $10,000. The clue that night had led us to the Minnesota</B>
<BR><B>state capital building grounds. We pulled up at about 12:30AM and
the place</B>
<BR><B>looked deserted. We were the only car in the parking lot. As we
walked out</B>
<BR><B>on to the Capital Mall we spotted someone off in the distance digging.
We</B>
<BR><B>were sure it was a fellow treasure hunter and we called out to him.
The</B>
<BR><B>whole time all four of us kept our eyes directly on him, shouting.
He didn't</B>
<BR><B>answer. Suddenly as we began to get closer, he disappeared. None
of us had</B>
<BR><B>taken our eyes off of him, so there was no way he could have just
walked</B>
<BR><B>off. We went to the spot where we had seen him digging and the snow
was</B>
<BR><B>pristine. Nothing had been dug there at all. I was really freaked
out and</B>
<BR><B>wanted to leave, but my friends insisted we look around and try
to find him.</B>
<BR><B>We never saw any other sign of him. Our theories are that it is
either a</B>
<BR><B>former garder come back to tend his plants or a deceased medallion
hunter</B>
<BR><B>looking for the treasure. I like to think it is the latter.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Spooky</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Steven_Bramschreiber@amat.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Helllo one and all !!</B>
<BR><B>I have been interested by the supernatural for a long time. My older</B>
<BR><B>brother is really " in- tune" to this kind of</B>
<BR><B>stuff. I've seen him go through 3 new(sealed)packs of cards and
pull all</B>
<BR><B>the face cards out after they were placed face down on a table!!(weird)Mom</B>
<BR><B>says it sort of "runs in the family)...Great,Thanks mom!!!!</B>
<BR><B>My story is something different though.... About 20+ years ago,when
I was</B>
<BR><B>still living with my parents,(in California)</B>
<BR><B>I had gone to bed early(11pm)from a long hectic day at work. Exhausted,I</B>
<BR><B>lay in bed on my back and started to doze off</B>
<BR><B>when I felt a "cat" jump up on my bed and walk up near my chest
and lay</B>
<BR><B>down. We didn't own a cat at the time so I all but jumped out of
bed to</B>
<BR><B>find nothing in the room but me!!!! Confused and chalking it up
to a hard</B>
<BR><B>day I went back to bed.</B>
<BR><B>Not 10 minutes later,I felt the cat jump up again on the bed,this
time I</B>
<BR><B>looked toward the foot of the bed to see what was going on only
to "see"</B>
<BR><B>impressions" where the cat had placed it's paws on it's way up to
my chest</B>
<BR><B>again.</B>
<BR><B>This had me really going....I again jumped out of bed and called
for my</B>
<BR><B>parents only to get the "go to bed..it's late"</B>
<BR><B>routine.This time I left the light on and went back to bed.Sure
enough,at</B>
<BR><B>almost ten minutes later(by the clock on the nightstand)the "cat"
jumped up</B>
<BR><B>and started it's routine(you know..the circling around thing that
cat's do</B>
<BR><B>before they plop</B>
<BR><B>down and go to sleep)near my feet. Again I felt the paws on the
beadspread</B>
<BR><B>and noticed the indentation.</B>
<BR><B>This time I figured,what the heck..It's only a cat..and went back
to sleep.</B>
<BR><B>The last thing I remeber is hearing the cat purr</B>
<BR><B>as I drifted off.</B>

<P><B>Scared Stiff</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: cyberpaige@sympatico.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello to the makers of shadowlands.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Brock Secord I am 20 years old, I have
a son and a wife</B>
<BR><B>to be. In the begining I have always had many experene since I was
a</B>
<BR><B>baby. From full body entities visiting in the middle of the night
to</B>
<BR><B>having pennies thrown at me.</B>
<BR><B>When my feonce and I first got together 2.5 years ago I told her
all the</B>
<BR><B>things that I had seen and been through. She understood yet said</B>
<BR><B>nothing. I still think that at the begining of the relationship
she was</B>
<BR><B>a sceptic. I even warned her in a sence about the fact that for
years</B>
<BR><B>they followed me in a way. That sceptisisim all left after one</B>
<BR><B>experence. I was living at my uncles house and I was cleaning the
living</B>
<BR><B>room. My feonce was doing the dishes. I had just finished vacuming
when</B>
<BR><B>I heard Mara scream. I ran into the kitchen and she was holding
her</B>
<BR><B>hand. I asked her what the problem was, she said that she burned
herself</B>
<BR><B>quite badly. She said that she had watched the handle on the foset
turn</B>
<BR><B>to the left (hot) by itself.. The&nbsp; site shocked her so much
that she was</B>
<BR><B>not paying attention to the hot water.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later on that night I sent her up to bed just
before me. I went up 5</B>
<BR><B>min after her.</B>
<BR><B>I went into the room to find her curled up in a ball on the bed
with no</B>
<BR><B>covers, not to be too detailed but she was also nude (as normal)
but it</B>
<BR><B>was vary vary cold in my room. The fact that she had no covers on
and</B>
<BR><B>was not moving struck me as vary odd.</B>
<BR><B>I paid no attention and climbed in beside her and pulled up the
covers</B>
<BR><B>she did not snuggle into me like she did every time I had to pull
her</B>
<BR><B>into me for her to move.</B>
<BR><B>I asked her what the problem was, she did not respond it started
to</B>
<BR><B>worry me I thought that I may have done somthing to upset her. I
laid</B>
<BR><B>back and then I saw it.....</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the ceiling was a dark figure of some being
staring straight back</B>
<BR><B>at us. All most sneering at us. I asked her if she had seen it aswell.</B>
<BR><B>She said thats why she was not moving......She was scared stiff.......</B>
<BR><B>I proceeded to talk to this shadow like being telling it that it
was all</B>
<BR><B>ok and that it should leave, everything will be all right. After
trying</B>
<BR><B>to resone with this thing for about 30 min it finally driffted off
and</B>
<BR><B>disapird into the wall . The next day I asked my uncle about the
history</B>
<BR><B>of the house. The old mans wife died in that house and the room
that I</B>
<BR><B>had was the babys room. Before the women pasted away she was always
in</B>
<BR><B>the babys room. But then she pasted away and the man had to move
away.</B>
<BR><B>After that she never douted anything I ever said again</B>

<P><B>Poltergeist</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jenallen@internode.on.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>i would like to share with you my ghostly encounter.</B>
<BR><B>it occured when i was 11or 12 years old.i was living with my father
at</B>
<BR><B>the time in</B>
<BR><B>an old sandstone house.from the first day we moved in there i remember</B>
<BR><B>feeling very edgey(as if someone was watching me).the entire house
had</B>
<BR><B>an ill "vibe" but one room in particular was really bad.this of
course</B>
<BR><B>had to be my bloody room!!.</B>
<BR><B>as soon as you walked into it you would get this incredibly overwhelming</B>
<BR><B>feeling.(something i cannot explain to this day!!).one night my
father</B>
<BR><B>had just finished</B>
<BR><B>tucking me into bed had turned the light off and closed the door,when
i</B>
<BR><B>decided to pull the covers over my head (as i often did in that</B>
<BR><B>room)when i had finally started to become calm and relaxed the covers</B>
<BR><B>which were over my head were suddenly "yanked" off of me!!.i stood
up</B>
<BR><B>and had a quick look around before deciding i must have pulled them
down</B>
<BR><B>by accident.2 or 3 mins passed when the covers were again "yanked"
off</B>
<BR><B>of me this time i was understandebly upset and proceeded to search
the</B>
<BR><B>room thouroghly thinking it was my younger brother but there was
no one</B>
<BR><B>in there!.i decided to return to bed.agin 2 or 3 mins passed and
my</B>
<BR><B>blankets were again pulled off of me this time i couldnt take anymore</B>
<BR><B>and i ran out of there scared shitless!!.i then explained the events</B>
<BR><B>that had happened to my father but as would be expected he did not</B>
<BR><B>believe me(but i know it happened!!).It is something that puzzles
me to</B>
<BR><B>this day is there an rational explanation for this or what? any</B>
<BR><B>help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.we ended up moving
house</B>
<BR><B>and i am happy to say i can now sleep with out my blankets being
thrown</B>
<BR><B>of me.(this event happened 6 or 7 years ago i am now 18 and have
ever</B>
<BR><B>since been really into ghosts cos i know that they exist).</B>

<P><B>Our Friend Helen</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:anemone000@juno.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Hello! My name is Annie and I live in southern California, just outside</B>
<BR><B>Los Angeles. I’ve been reading over&nbsp; the stories posted here
and they</B>
<BR><B>sound a lot like my own story.</B>
<BR><B>First of all, my mom, oldest brother, and myself all have some degree
of</B>
<BR><B>ESP, which I think makes us sensitive to paranormal activity and
might</B>
<BR><B>even attract spirits to us.</B>
<BR><B>I’m sure my house has been haunted ever since I was a baby. And
here’s</B>
<BR><B>what happened:&nbsp; in 1979, the year before I was born, my parents
and 2</B>
<BR><B>older brothers moved into a brand new house.&nbsp; My mom said the
2nd day in</B>
<BR><B>that house she knew weird things were going on.&nbsp; Footsteps,
voices, odd</B>
<BR><B>sounds, things like that.&nbsp; All she knew was that our house
and all the</B>
<BR><B>others on the street were built over farmland land.&nbsp; It seemed
that</B>
<BR><B>strange things would happen in our house for a few days and then
would</B>
<BR><B>stop, but then the neighbor would complain of odd things in her
house.</B>
<BR><B>It seemed like the ghost was going up and down the block to all
the</B>
<BR><B>houses, maybe following the land that he or she lived on.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I was born in</B>
<BR><B>1980, and ever since I can remember I have noticed strange things
myself.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I would hear heavy footsteps downstairs when everyone was
asleep</B>
<BR><B>upstairs.&nbsp; Sometimes I would hear chairs dragging across the
floor, pots</B>
<BR><B>and pans banging, things like that. One day when I was about 5 years
old,</B>
<BR><B>I heard a woman’s voice call my name from the 2nd story window although</B>
<BR><B>my mom was making dinner in the downstairs kitchen.&nbsp; My 2 older
brothers</B>
<BR><B>would constantly ask my mom, “Who was that lady in the white nightgown</B>
<BR><B>that was walking in the hallway last night?”&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometime
later a child</B>
<BR><B>spirit came to our house also.&nbsp; He liked to go running up the
stairs in</B>
<BR><B>the middle of the night and generally cause mischief, like hiding
things</B>
<BR><B>and moving objects around.&nbsp; His footsteps sounded like a toddler
scuffing</B>
<BR><B>around in a sleeper jumpsuit.</B>
<BR><B>My mom confronted the lady ghost one time, and all the ghost said
was “I</B>
<BR><B>love your baby.”</B>
<BR><B>I only remember seeing the ghost only once, when I was 14, as a
dark</B>
<BR><B>shadowy figure moving down the staircase.&nbsp;&nbsp; My best friend
even witnessed</B>
<BR><B>the curtains in my room swinging back and forth rapidly when the
window</B>
<BR><B>and door were shut tight, and I was woken up one night with my bed</B>
<BR><B>shaking pretty hard.</B>
<BR><B>In 1999 we moved to another house across town, and either the ghost</B>
<BR><B>followed us or there’s others spirits here anyways. The first night
here,</B>
<BR><B>I watched a book move itself from the middle of a table and fall
onto the</B>
<BR><B>floor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Every night in my new room, just after I had
shut off the lights</B>
<BR><B>to go to bed, my bedroom door would open, I’d hear some footsteps
on the</B>
<BR><B>carpet, my guinea pigs would squeal, and then the entity would leave
my</B>
<BR><B>room and shut the door again. How polite. :) My mom has seen her
many</B>
<BR><B>times, she is an elderly lady named Helen that often gazes out the
large</B>
<BR><B>window in the den. Some times I’ve felt cold spots in the house,
usually</B>
<BR><B>in the hallway by the bedrooms.&nbsp; There tend to be scents in
the house</B>
<BR><B>that have no source, like a lavender perfume that nobody here wears
or</B>
<BR><B>even owns. My younger brother, sister, and myself all feel like
somebody</B>
<BR><B>is watching us if we stay up late at night.&nbsp;&nbsp; My sister
says that</B>
<BR><B>sometimes the light fixture on the ceiling in her room will swing
back</B>
<BR><B>and forth by itself.&nbsp; Oh, and sometimes my TV, stereo, and
VCR will flip</B>
<BR><B>on and off when nobody is around but me.</B>
<BR><B>Here’s another odd occurrence: I have a rabbit that lives in the
den and</B>
<BR><B>she begs for food whenever humans walk into the room. A few days
ago I</B>
<BR><B>was watching TV in the den, and the rabbit ran to the edge of the
carpet,</B>
<BR><B>turned around, and stood on her hind legs, begging for food at thin
air.</B>
<BR><B>She ran into the middle of the room and did the same thing again.</B>
<BR><B>Finally she ran to the other side of the room and begged some more,
and</B>
<BR><B>then she sat looking at that part of the room for a while, with
her ears</B>
<BR><B>turned forward in an alert manner. I’ve heard that dogs and cats
are</B>
<BR><B>sensitive to spirits, and I guess my rabbit is too. By the way,
I’ve had</B>
<BR><B>several dogs in my house that I’ve watched for neighbors and family
for a</B>
<BR><B>few days at a time, and each one has done that “stare at the empty
corner</B>
<BR><B>and bark” thing.</B>
<BR><B>Since my schedule is usually different than everyone else’s here,
I often</B>
<BR><B>get home very late at night when everyone else is asleep.&nbsp;
There is</B>
<BR><B>always a light on in the front room of the house, and when I come
home I</B>
<BR><B>always see a dark outline or figure of Helen standing in the window,
as</B>
<BR><B>if our friendly spirit is waiting up for me.&nbsp; So when I walk
in the door</B>
<BR><B>I say, “I’m home, thanks for waiting for me” and then I get the
feeling</B>
<BR><B>around me that all is well.</B>
<BR><B>Sometimes our spirit plays pranks on us, such as hiding my makeup,
and</B>
<BR><B>I’ll find my lipstick a week later perhaps under the sink or in
my mom’s</B>
<BR><B>china hutch.&nbsp; Or a few times she’s come up behind me and tugged
on my</B>
<BR><B>ponytail, and when I turn around nobody is there.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
often feel</B>
<BR><B>something touching my hair too, it feels like the way a little girl
plays</B>
<BR><B>with her friend’s hair.&nbsp; I can’t even count the number of times
that</B>
<BR><B>somebody has called my name from another room, and when I go to
look,</B>
<BR><B>nobody is there.</B>
<BR><B>We also get other spirits passing through, such as the male ghost
dressed</B>
<BR><B>like a lumberjack that my mom saw only once in the backyard, or
another</B>
<BR><B>entity with heavy footsteps that whistles in the kitchen once in
a while.</B>
<BR><B>Right now I don’t mind living with a friendly spirit or two.&nbsp;
Helen has</B>
<BR><B>never caused us any problems. I do not feel any kind of fear or
evil in</B>
<BR><B>the house, just the feeling that somebody is looking after us here.&nbsp;&nbsp;
So</B>
<BR><B>she is welcome to stay. If anyone else has a friendly spirit around,
feel</B>
<BR><B>free to email me.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Personal Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bratj_99@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have had many "ghostly" experience's in my</B>
<BR><B>life.&nbsp; But the most recent one's have been since</B>
<BR><B>my husband and child and I have moved into our</B>
<BR><B>1954 ranch style home.</B>
<BR><B>We moved in, in 2000, and right off, our un-seen</B>
<BR><B>house guest made him self known.&nbsp; At first it was</B>
<BR><B>just shadows going from the livingroom into the</B>
<BR><B>hallway, then one night around 1:30am, I woke up</B>
<BR><B>and went into the kitchen to get a drink of</B>
<BR><B>water, I went back to bed and was just lying</B>
<BR><B>there thinking about the day ahead, when I heard</B>
<BR><B>the door to the basement open and close, and foot</B>
<BR><B>steps decending the staircase into the basement.</B>
<BR><B>No one can walk up and down these stairs quietly!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;At first I thought it was my husband, but I soon</B>
<BR><B>found out, he was next to me in bed!&nbsp; Then I</B>
<BR><B>thought maybe my son was sleep walking, so I</B>
<BR><B>checked on him and found him too, in bed asleep.</B>
<BR><B>I got NO sleep the rest of that night, and when</B>
<BR><B>our alarm went off about 3 hours later, I had my</B>
<BR><B>husband check out the house and he found NO one</B>
<BR><B>but us in it.</B>
<BR><B>Then my mom and aunt came over one day while we</B>
<BR><B>were at work and my son was in school, and they</B>
<BR><B>saw a man, in his underwear no less, walk from</B>
<BR><B>the bathroom to the master bedroom and close the</B>
<BR><B>door!&nbsp; They thought that my husband had either</B>
<BR><B>stayed home from work, or come home from work</B>
<BR><B>sick.&nbsp; He had not, he was at work all day long.</B>
<BR><B>Then last summer, my husband and I were sitting</B>
<BR><B>in the living room, enjoying a nice fire in the</B>
<BR><B>fire place, just for atmosphere, and my son was</B>
<BR><B>spending the night with his grandparents, we had</B>
<BR><B>all the lights off in the house, and were</B>
<BR><B>watching tv, when I got up to use the bathroom, I</B>
<BR><B>was coming back, and saw what I thought was my</B>
<BR><B>husband, walk from the livingroom into the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen.&nbsp; I looked into the kitchen to ask him</B>
<BR><B>where he was going, but there was NO ONE there,</B>
<BR><B>my husband was still in the livingroom!</B>
<BR><B>Both of us have heard plenty!&nbsp; We hear foot steps</B>
<BR><B>and there is no one there, and our floors creak</B>
<BR><B>pretty badly, so there is no chance of walking</B>
<BR><B>quietly on them at all, it's pretty neat thoguh,</B>
<BR><B>but sometimes I get a bit spooked.</B>
<BR><B>I call our ghost "Casper" since I have no idea</B>
<BR><B>who he is, but I do know it's a man.</B>
<BR><B>For the most part, he's pretty quiet, but I have</B>
<BR><B>noticed he seems more noisier around Christmas</B>
<BR><B>time.</B>
<BR><B>We also have a "shadow" of a human(?) form on our</B>
<BR><B>carpet that is only noticeable in the evenings</B>
<BR><B>when we have the livingroom light on or tv, you</B>
<BR><B>can see the head, and shoulders and torso, and I</B>
<BR><B>have moved the carpet fibers every which way,</B>
<BR><B>have shampooed the carpet at least twice, and</B>
<BR><B>have vacuumed countless of times and the form is</B>
<BR><B>always there.</B>
<BR><B>Well that's my story, believe it or not, it's</B>
<BR><B>true.</B>
<BR><B>And Thank you Shadowlands for letting me tell it.</B>

<P><B>My Mom</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Heather.Lopez-Pulanco@med.ge.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My mom passed away July 98, and her and I were very close.&nbsp;
My daughter</B>
<BR><B>had only ever met her once before she passed, so she never really
got to</B>
<BR><B>know her grandmother.&nbsp; In September 2000, I had what my husband
would</B>
<BR><B>call a strange coincidence.&nbsp; We put our daughter Rachell'e
to bed at her</B>
<BR><B>normal time of 7pm.&nbsp; She gave us both a kiss and hug goodnight
then went</B>
<BR><B>to bed.&nbsp; When I check on her at 10pm that night to make sure
she was</B>
<BR><B>breathing okay, I didn't notice anything wrong with her.&nbsp; Sometime</B>
<BR><B>during the night, she must have woken up and grabbed for her door</B>
<BR><B>hanger.&nbsp; It was a pillow that hangs on the door that says "Baby</B>
<BR><B>Sleeping"/"Baby Not Sleeping".&nbsp; Rachell'e had been using this
as a</B>
<BR><B>purse, and she must have been playing in her sleep.</B>
<BR><B>At about 3am in the morning, I woke up rather quickly.&nbsp; I was
having a</B>
<BR><B>dream that my mom was in, and she told me that I needed to wake
up and</B>
<BR><B>check on "her" baby.&nbsp; That's how she use to refer to my daughter
when we</B>
<BR><B>would talk on the phone.&nbsp; No sooner did I wake up, I heard
my daughter's</B>
<BR><B>soft cries.&nbsp; I jumped out of bed to see if she had had a nightmare,
or</B>
<BR><B>night dream as she would call them.&nbsp; When I got in her room
I noticed</B>
<BR><B>that something was wrapped around her neck.&nbsp; The string on
the pillow</B>
<BR><B>had tangled around her neck and started to cut off her breathing.&nbsp;
Talk</B>
<BR><B>about a very scared mother.&nbsp; At this point I didn't know what
to do, so</B>
<BR><B>I ran back into my bedroom and hit my husband to get him up.&nbsp;
He could</B>
<BR><B>hear how scared I was and took Rachell'e away from me.&nbsp; I told
him she</B>
<BR><B>had something around her neck and it was cutting off her breathing.</B>
<BR><B>Present or not, I didn't care if it was messed up.&nbsp; He broke
the ribbon</B>
<BR><B>from around her neck, and Rachell'e started to cough and cry harder.</B>
<BR><B>Thank God.&nbsp; I stayed up the rest of the night with her in my
arms,</B>
<BR><B>making she her breathing returned to normal.</B>
<BR><B>Later on that morning before she went to school, I asked her what
had</B>
<BR><B>happened.&nbsp; She didn't remember waking up at all.&nbsp; She
just remembers</B>
<BR><B>that my mom had told her to get up.&nbsp; Ever since then, I knew
that my</B>
<BR><B>little girl had her guardian angel watching out for her in the form
of</B>
<BR><B>my mom.&nbsp; Even in the afterlife my mom is still watching out
for me.</B>

<P><B>My Ghost Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: flashbackgirl2001@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;They're are 2 ghosts that haunt it one in the girls locker
room and one in the daycare(old gym).Now let me give u some back ground
on the girls locker room.The janitor hung himself in the corner in the
4th row of lockers because he had just shot all the cheerleaders dead.Last
year when we'd go down there everything would always be normal.When we
came back down there blood would be on the sinks.All over it like someone
bled to death!The showers would start turning on and off or when someone
turned them on red stuff(we dunno if it was blood)would come out of it.Then
lights would turn on off.And we scream Mrs.Davis would come down there
and everything would stop.That all has stopped now though for some reason.But
still if u go down there by urself the lockers will start opening and closing
and u 'll here some thing hitting the wall and a moan sometimes a scream.And
the week b</B>
<BR><B>This ain't about the school anymore but I'll tell about my other
ghost experinces.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day I was at the creek at my mamaws house.I
was minding my own buissness bird watching.I had been watching a red bird
hopping around and I looked for some reason to the right and I saw a girl
dressed like she was from the 1940s.her hair was all ratted up and her
clothes had tears and rips in them.She has knee high socks balck shoes
plaid dress,etc. I didn't know how to react.We just stared @ each otherfor
like 15 sec.and I blinked she was gone.I went screaming running to where
my uncle mamaw and papaw were building their garage and right at that time(the
sun was shining no clouds nor thunder)outa no where lighting hit my uncle
but he suvived(unluckly).I have no idea why that would have happened.</B>
<BR><B>There's a ghost that haunts my house&nbsp; I have never seen but
I hear them.They move stuff all the time.They get the cat off the table
when she gets on there.I think it might be a good ghost.Except one time
it threw the cat off the bed when I wanted it on there and it hit my inflatable
chair.I don't thing it got hurt though.'It'&nbsp; rolled my comp. chair
w/ me in it across the room one time.I thought I was gonna die.I guess
its just it's idea of fun....</B>
<BR><B>One night when I was laying in the bed in the room I had to share
a room w/ My sister I looked out the window at some freak coming by on
a bike.He passed by and I saw a family standing out side in the drive way.I
screamed cause they had just 'appeared'..My mom came running in there thinking
I was being murdered and they disappeared.poof just like that.I watched
them&nbsp; disappear.That might be 'It'.&nbsp; ????</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; At my dads house a ghost 'haunts' it.It moves all the
chairs around in the kitchen,Messes up out closet all the time,stands at
the door when someone goes to bed but all you can see of him is an out
line of a person&nbsp; and it looks like it has a pointey hat on.One night
I was laying on my bed and it came out of the closet and looked at meand
it had glowing red eyes!!I was frozen w/ fear.It had scared me the 1st
time it had stood @ the door but this!!It walks up and down the hall all
the time.It walks w/ big heavy footsteps.Its so scary!</B>

<BR><B>My Ghost Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: baby177@bellsouth.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hey. My name is Brittney and Im 13 years old. I have had some experiences
with ghosts, or I think are ghosts. Feel free to email me at baby177@bellsouth.net
if you want to give me some information or ask questions about this. I
love getting email about it, since I am interested in ghosts! Okay, here
are my experiences:</B>
<BR><B>My Mom: First of all, my mom has had a few experiences. One night,
we were sleeping in the livingroom. She said that she heard the pencil
sharpener grinding like it was sharpening a pencil. She got up and turned
on the light. It was still making the grinding noise, but no pencil was
there! This freaked mom out, but she went back to sleep.The wierd thing
is, I never heard it. Maybe something was trying to block me out so only
mom could hear it?</B>
<BR><B>Another experience my mom has had is one day she was sitting in
the livingroom during the day watching tv. The air conditioner was on.
Mom said that all of a sudden the air conditioner just goes off. She told
me that she thinks her brother(died of cancer at 15) or her dad is trying
to communicate with her somehow. I thought the pencil sharpener thing was
freaky.</B>
<BR><B>My Experiences: Well, I have also had a few small experiences.First
of all, I have heard something running up and down the hallway when I know
it wouldnt be my parents because it is 11-12 o clock at night and they
just wouldnt run back and forth down the hall. But it sounded like a little
child, not a grown person. That is strange. I dont know what a little child
could be here for. I have also been in my room late at night and been really
upset, but I suddenly get kind of cold, then warm and something makes me
smile even though im so upset. Its like someone or something is there for
me when Im upset......</B>
<BR><B>One thing that really freaked me out was when i was half asleep
one night and then i heard something drag out my name like Briiiitttnneyy
in a whisper. And it was right by my ear!!! No one else would have done
that to me. And it sounded like a male voice. I was sooo scared. I just
put my head under the cover and layed stiff for a long time.</B>
<BR><B>Another strange thing that has happened to me was when I was alone
in my house one day. I think I was 12 about to be 13. Anyway, I was laying
on my couch watching tv one day and I heard a squeaking noise. I looked
beside me at the chair and it was completely turned in a different direction!
I had it facing me to begin with so I know it wasnt my imagination. When
I looked, the chair was facing the tv! My dog was NOT in the chair when
it moved. She was laying by the couch. But suddenly my dog gets up and
walked toward the chair. She started to growl at it. I was getting scared.
Well, right at that time, she yelped like something hit her and backd away
from the chair. I just sat there watching, shocked. Then my dog started
barking at the chair at wouldnt stop! It was like the dog saw something
in the chair that I didnt. She would pace back and forth in front of the
chair barking. But then she just stopped like whatever was there went away!
I got up immediately and went outside until someone got home. I didnt want
to stay alone in there. I also think that it was my moms brother or my
grandpa trying to communicate with me somehow in all of those things that
happened. Or just let me know that they are there.</B>
<BR><B>Oh I also have 1 more thing to tell.Its not about ghosts, but its
wierd. My close friend came to my house not very long ago for the first
time. She told me a while nack that when she first walked in my house,
she got a feeling and saw a picture of a little girl and a little reddish
brown haired boy holding hands in her MIND. She said the little girl resembled
my mom as she might have looked when she was younger. She said the little
boy was older than the girl. She told my mom one day and my mom said that
her and her brother were very close when they were little and he did have
reddish brown hair! That is something that my friend NEVER could have known
just by walking in my house.There were no picures on the wall like what
she saw. She said that she got the feeling that my mom had a brother and
that the little boy in she had saw in her mind was the brother. That fascinated
me because she never could have known my mom had a brother. She didnt know
about my moms side of the family or my dads. She said that people believed
she has ESP and personally I believe it too.</B>
<BR><B>If you have anything to tell me about these things please email
me.Even if you have a question bout it!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Ghost Encounter</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have encountered 1 phenomina that i have not been able to explain.
My name is Matthew. I am from Bradenton, Florida but i go to school in
Sarasota for the VPA Theater program. About 1 year ago at Booker High School
in the building 36 boy's bathroom i went in there once. It was a nightmare.
The lights were constantly flickering, making it very hard to see, the
mirrors were cracked. There was a small water flood over the drain but
it didnt seem to be draining. There were 2 stalls. Both seemed empty but
the first was locked to my suprise. I didnt hear a response from the person
inside the stall but i saw 2 large shoes that looked like they were torn
up, beat up, and maybe burned up. I then went to the next stall and did
my duty. I then got up and looked over and the stall that was previously
locked was now swinging open (it then creaked loudly and banged on the
second stall) with no one inside. On the wall (as well as the stall walls)
had a large black stain on them as if there was a fire. I never heard any
movement from the stall next to me nor did i hear him leave.</B>
<BR><B>About 2 weeks later someone in building 36 pulled the fire alarm.
The person who set the fire set it in the bathroom, trying to lite toliet
paper (and maybe throw it on the roof) and burn the building down. Out
of curiosity i looked in and there was yellow tape around the stall that
had the "ghost" inside. I never reported this to the school.</B>

<BR><B>Talking at Night</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Atomicfuturegurl@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi, I was reading your webpage and I was thinking of some things
that have happened to me and people I know. There are a lot of things,
so your going to have to bear with me.</B>
<BR><B>I guess the first strange thing to ever happen to me, personally,
would have to be around when I was 2 or 3 years old. I don't remember ever
doing this, but my parents told me that I used to sit up in bed late at
night and stare straight into space and yell at things. I'd say things
like "i hate you!" or "Get out of here!". And my eyes would be all glossy.
And according to them, this happened frequently. And then the next morning
after all of it would happen, they'd ask me if I remembered being awake
or anything that had happened, and I wouldn't know what they were talking
about. This scared the crap out of my parents, they thought I was posessed
or something. So they took me to the doctor about it, and he gave a rational
explanation for it. He said it was something called a "night terror" (i'm
pretty sure that's how you spell it). Anyway, he said it was completely
normal and that I would grow out of it. I'm not sure if that was what it
was, but I did eventually grow o</B>
<BR><B>As I was growing up, I became very interested in the paranormal.
I'm not quite sure why, but I just did. Anyway, the first thing to ever
actually happen to me was one time when me and my brother were at my aunt
and uncle's house. The house they lived in had a very wooded area behind
their backyard, and my brother and I used to play back there. Anyway, my
uncle made up an imaginary friend for when all the kids came over to joke
around with them and such. It turns out that his imaginary friend was a
ghost named Freddy. Well, we thought it was cool to be hanging out with
an imaginary ghost and everything. And my uncle told me that he lived in
teh woods behind their house. So that day, my brother and I were back there
pretending to play with Freddy, when a creepy feeling just came over me.
And then I heard it. It was the death tune or whatever it's called. But
anyway it was a familiar death tune that you'd hear on TV and such. And
I looked at my brother and he heard it too</B>
<BR><B>Another time was when me and my cousin Rachel were sitting on her
front porch one night. And this was recently after my Grandmother had passed
away. We were talking about how it was so unfair that she had died and
that she had never done anything to deserve it. The whole time I kept staring
across the street at the neighbor's clothesline. There was a sheet hanging
from it. And the more I stared at it, the closer it came to me and the
more transparent it became, and it was all white. And it got so close that
it was almost surrounding us. I was like in shock and I said to Rachel
"oh my God, do you see that?!" She saw it alright, and that's when we ran
back into the house and into her bedroom. Then when we finally calmed down
we thought it was our Grandmother. So we weren't afraid anymore, and we
went back outside to see if it was still there. It wasn't. And then I told
her that I was watching it the whole time from the neighbor's house across
the street on teh clotheslin</B>
<BR><B>I'll give you one more thing that happened to me, although there
are a lot more. I was at my friend's house over night. And I already knew
her place was haunted because she told of experiences she's had in the
past. (seeing and hearing people, etc...) She said it wasn't harmful at
all, and I never felt anything strange in that house before, so I usually
just shrugged it off as no big deal. Well, it was around 5 in the morning
and we were up watching something on TV. And our other friend Bre was there,
but she was dead asleep (no pun intended). Anyway, all of a sudden we heard
her keyboard playing really loud. It started out with the Jaws thing and
then went into just pounding a bunch of keys from the top of the sclae
to the bottom. At first we thought it was one of the cats, but these notes
were not held, and if a cat were to be standing on the keyboard the notes
would've been played out. Then we screamed like hell for a while and the
playing stopped after we stopped.</B>

<P><B>My Dog and Great Grandma</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jasonzeidler@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>i actually have 2 stories. which i believe to be relevant to this
page. the</B>
<BR><B>first is about my&nbsp; old dog Timmy...he died prob when i was
9 yrs old(im 25</B>
<BR><B>now) but he was my best friend when he was around,.,..,anyway, when
he was</B>
<BR><B>alive.timmy did "patrols" around the trailer where i lived in. just
the</B>
<BR><B>usual.,.,walting around the trailer going into the rooms making
sure</B>
<BR><B>everyone was ok (he was the best dog in the world!!!) since the
trailer had</B>
<BR><B>tile floors you could always here the "clicking" of his nails on
the floor"</B>
<BR><B>its was very distinct cause he was old and couldnt walk really well.
anyways</B>
<BR><B>one day when i got home from school, my mom told me she had to have
timmy</B>
<BR><B>put to sleep. i was so saddened that i had a hard time sleeping
that</B>
<BR><B>night..just when i started to doze off, i could here the distinct
clicking</B>
<BR><B>of timmies nails on the floor. the door opened to my room.,.,.,and
then</B>
<BR><B>closed a few seconds later..this happened 3 nights in a row. everytime
i was</B>
<BR><B>not scared and i felt extremly safe. on the third night i finally
said out</B>
<BR><B>loud, but softly. "im ok timmy thanks"....i guess he just wanted
to make</B>
<BR><B>sure we were ok before finally leaving,.,..,.,</B>
<BR><B>my other story is when my greatgrandmother died when i was in 6th</B>
<BR><B>grade...her name was edna,,..,and we used to have so much fun playing.,,..,i</B>
<BR><B>remember sleeping in her old bed a night or 2 after the funeral.
i slept in</B>
<BR><B>her bed and there was a smaller rolloutbed underneath. my grandma
slept</B>
<BR><B>there that night.,.,.,well i remember around midnight or so i woke
up</B>
<BR><B>laughing (hard) like the kind where someone is tickling you but
i did</B>
<BR><B>directly feel anything. i was laughing and laughing so hard i couldnt</B>
<BR><B>stop,.,.,.,.for a 15 min it was non stop hard laughter,.,.,.my grandma
was</B>
<BR><B>trying to sleep and she told me to stop laughing but i couldnt...the
more</B>
<BR><B>itried the worse it got.,,.my grandma finally left furious at me
cause&nbsp; she</B>
<BR><B>couldnt sleep,.,..,during the funeral i felt bad cause i didnt get
to say</B>
<BR><B>good bye and to tell my great grandma how much i loved her and how
much she</B>
<BR><B>ment to me,...,i guess that the "tickling" was her way of saying
that that</B>
<BR><B>she already knew.,,.,..,</B>

<P><B>My Cousins Visit</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: imstarr@yahoo.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>I've been reading through your site and I find it</B>
<BR><B>fascinating to say the least.&nbsp; I always believed in</B>
<BR><B>paranormal activities.&nbsp; Like many of the others, who</B>
<BR><B>have relayed their stories on your site, I have always</B>
<BR><B>been somewhat sensitive and almost psychic about</B>
<BR><B>certain places or events.&nbsp; I have had experiences</B>
<BR><B>where I felt as if I have been in a particular place</B>
<BR><B>before and have been able to describe details about</B>
<BR><B>the place I could not possibly have known.&nbsp; On more</B>
<BR><B>than one occasion I have foretold a relatives death</B>
<BR><B>weeks before they actually died.&nbsp; I knew my father</B>
<BR><B>would have a heart attack days before he actually had</B>
<BR><B>one.&nbsp; My most vivid experience was in 1997.&nbsp; It was</B>
<BR><B>two days after Christmas and I was at home alone.&nbsp; My</B>
<BR><B>friend lived with me at the time but she was out late</B>
<BR><B>that night.&nbsp; I went to bed around 1:00am and as I was</B>
<BR><B>my habit of doing at the time, turned on the TV and</B>
<BR><B>started dozing off.&nbsp; As I lay in bed half-awake I</B>
<BR><B>started to feel totally paralyzed.&nbsp; I could see a haze</B>
<BR><B>of some sort surround my bed and almost my entire</B>
<BR><B>room.&nbsp; I tried to move or make a sound but I couldn't</B>
<BR><B>move a muscle.&nbsp; I felt as is I was falling off my bed</B>
<BR><B>but I hadn't moved an inch.&nbsp; I could hear people</B>
<BR><B>outside my window and cars driving by horns honking as</B>
<BR><B>if it were the middle of the morning on a busy city</B>
<BR><B>street but my room was in the back of the apartment</B>
<BR><B>and my apartment was not located on a busy street</B>
<BR><B>certainly not one that would be that busy at 1:00am.</B>
<BR><B>I also felt an overwhelming desire to leave this room</B>
<BR><B>I was in, an uncontrollable desire to be free to walk</B>
<BR><B>on that busy street outside and go about everyday</B>
<BR><B>business.&nbsp; Thinking about that feeling afterwards it</B>
<BR><B>was the sort of feeling possibly felt by someone who</B>
<BR><B>is terminally ill and wants nothing more than to get</B>
<BR><B>out and taste the world one more time.&nbsp; This state</B>
<BR><B>continued for about two hours during which time I</B>
<BR><B>heard my roommate come home and saw her walk past my</B>
<BR><B>room and down the hall to her own room.&nbsp; I remember</B>
<BR><B>thinking that if only I could call out to her she</B>
<BR><B>could wake me out of this trance.&nbsp; Finally at 3:00am</B>
<BR><B>it was over and I went to sleep almost as if nothing</B>
<BR><B>had happened.&nbsp; At 8:30 in the morning my phone rang</B>
<BR><B>and it was my father asking me to go over to my</B>
<BR><B>parents home right away.&nbsp; I didn't ask why, although</B>
<BR><B>by the sound of his voice I knew.&nbsp; I hung up the phone</B>
<BR><B>walked into my roommate’s room woke her up and said,</B>
<BR><B>"I'm going over to my parent house, my cousin just</B>
<BR><B>died".&nbsp; I drove to my parent’s home, which was only</B>
<BR><B>about five minutes from where I lived.&nbsp; The entire</B>
<BR><B>time I prayed that I was wrong but I knew that I was</B>
<BR><B>right and I was.&nbsp; Apparently my cousin passed away</B>
<BR><B>approximately 3:00am the previous night after what had</B>
<BR><B>been a long battle with Cancer.&nbsp; What makes this</B>
<BR><B>interesting is that my cousin lived in Europe where</B>
<BR><B>most of my family is, and noone in my family knew that</B>
<BR><B>he was sick because he didn't want us to know.&nbsp; Only</B>
<BR><B>his mother and brother knew.&nbsp; I had visited with them</B>
<BR><B>a few months before all of this but tried as I may I</B>
<BR><B>was unable to see him.&nbsp; His brother told me he was out</B>
<BR><B>of the country on business and would not be back until</B>
<BR><B>after I had returned to Canada.&nbsp; He called me shortly</B>
<BR><B>after I returned home but I was out and he left only a</B>
<BR><B>message.&nbsp; I was never able to reach him after that.</B>
<BR><B>We were very close and to this day I know that what I</B>
<BR><B>was feeling that night is what he must have been</B>
<BR><B>feeling before he died.&nbsp; I am convinced that I somehow</B>
<BR><B>was there with him when he died.&nbsp; The country where my</B>
<BR><B>cousin lived is exactly seven hours difference from</B>
<BR><B>where I live and when he died the time there would</B>
<BR><B>have been approximately 10:00am which would explain</B>
<BR><B>the busy city street and all the noise I had heard. My</B>
<BR><B>cousin and I were very alike and I know that he would</B>
<BR><B>have hated being confined anywhere.&nbsp; He would have</B>
<BR><B>rather died.&nbsp; I have had other experiences like this</B>
<BR><B>most of them more psychic than ghostly.&nbsp; If you know</B>
<BR><B>of anyone with similar experiences or how one could</B>
<BR><B>develop this sort of psychic ability please let me</B>
<BR><B>know.&nbsp; Thanks</B>

<BR><B>Jordan High School Ghosts II</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: Richard.Nance@mortgage.wellsFargo.COM</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>I found your sight about a month ago, and frequent it often.&nbsp;
Its just to</B>
<BR><B>interesting to stay away for long.&nbsp; I came across one story
about Jordan</B>
<BR><B>High School.&nbsp; I just happened to go to that school also, and
I myself found</B>
<BR><B>it to be very haunted along with almost anyone that has gone there.&nbsp;
My</B>
<BR><B>stories are bland compared to some of the happenings around the
school, but</B>
<BR><B>I'll give a brief overview of them later.&nbsp; My story was on
a Saturday</B>
<BR><B>morning. I was suppose to meet the drivers Ed teacher and 3 other
students</B>
<BR><B>and go driving.&nbsp; I unfortunately arrived there late and was
left behind.&nbsp; So</B>
<BR><B>while walking back through the school I found a janitor and asked
if I could</B>
<BR><B>borrow a phone.&nbsp; He told me to wait where I was and he would
go check the</B>
<BR><B>office. I was by the south entrance by the 'girl gym' and the girls
locker</B>
<BR><B>room.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was gone about 5 min total, and in the second
minute of his</B>
<BR><B>absence I heard some lockers in the girls locker room open and shut.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>dismissed it because it wasn't anything new.&nbsp; Then I heard
more open and</B>
<BR><B>this time shutting hard, at which time I noticed that there were
no lights</B>
<BR><B>on in the locker room.&nbsp; The opening and closing of the lockers
escalated to</B>
<BR><B>a deafening noise, where it must have been all of them opening and
closing</B>
<BR><B>over and over.&nbsp; At this point I decided to go outside the doors,
and wait</B>
<BR><B>for the custodian outside.&nbsp; I could still hear the lockers
from there, but I</B>
<BR><B>wasn't right next to the locker room doorway and felt a little better.&nbsp;
As</B>
<BR><B>the custodian returned the lockers stopped banging and he saw me
outside.</B>
<BR><B>He came out an immediately commented on the noise.&nbsp; Basically
he said.</B>
<BR><B>'Don't let them scare you, they do that all the time'&nbsp; He then
escorted me</B>
<BR><B>down to the office and I proceeded to call my parents and went home.</B>
<BR><B>Some of the other famous stories from this high school are.</B>
<BR><B>A pair of teachers seeing two student duck into the science room
during a</B>
<BR><B>dance.&nbsp; The teachers decided to bust them and entering one
from each door</B>
<BR><B>into the room found no one there.&nbsp; I asked one of the teachers
involved in</B>
<BR><B>this incident their side of the story, and he remarked that he could
see the</B>
<BR><B>shadows of the students through the window on the door.&nbsp; They
were there</B>
<BR><B>till the door opened.</B>
<BR><B>One janitor who against school rules stayed at the school overnight
for a</B>
<BR><B>period of time. (some of the offices were equipped with living quarters</B>
<BR><B>since during the early 1900's teachers and students would live there
if</B>
<BR><B>their homes were out of town)&nbsp; Told stories of hearing basketball
games</B>
<BR><B>going on when all the light were off in the auditorium.&nbsp; Hearing
instruments</B>
<BR><B>being played in the band room at 3:00 in the morning.&nbsp; Always
there were</B>
<BR><B>footsteps, and doors opening and closing.&nbsp; He saw numerous
figures walking</B>
<BR><B>the corridors at all times of the night and day.&nbsp; Some more
solid then</B>
<BR><B>others.&nbsp; He, and another janitor on duty, once heard a whole
bunch of</B>
<BR><B>basketballs bouncing in the gym, and when they opened the door all
the</B>
<BR><B>basketballs were out across the floor and they all just dropped.&nbsp;
Like</B>
<BR><B>whomever was bouncing them had just stopped doing it.&nbsp; He remembers
telling</B>
<BR><B>the ghost's) that the balls all better be put away after they were
done with</B>
<BR><B>them. He closed the door and the bouncing started again, but the
next day</B>
<BR><B>all the balls had been put away.</B>
<BR><B>We had a very ferocious spirit in the auditorium.&nbsp; He would
throw things,</B>
<BR><B>usually chairs, at the stage crew.&nbsp; During some plays props
would fall, and</B>
<BR><B>one of my actor friends said he even got pushed once from an unseen
person.</B>
<BR><B>During the play the crucible (Salem Witch Hunt theme)&nbsp; The
whole stage got</B>
<BR><B>REALLY COLD, and the lead actor, Tim, said he felt like something
push into</B>
<BR><B>the back of his head at one point.&nbsp; He said he blacked out
for a moment, and</B>
<BR><B>when he came to it was later on in the play, and Tim doesn't remember
saying</B>
<BR><B>his lines, and acting to that point.&nbsp; But the audience didn't
notice</B>
<BR><B>anything.&nbsp; There are several stories of when the big 'movie
screen' was</B>
<BR><B>down.&nbsp; You could see hands and other impressions moving along
it, but there</B>
<BR><B>was never anyone visible there.&nbsp; But you could still see the
impression from</B>
<BR><B>both sides of the screen.</B>
<BR><B>Ok I'm almost done here.. one last story.&nbsp; (As related to me
from my</B>
<BR><B>psychology teacher who was told first hand from the student)</B>
<BR><B>The student from Alta high (up the road a bit) transferred to Jordan</B>
<BR><B>probably summer of 92-93.&nbsp; The night after his first day there,
he had a</B>
<BR><B>dream. It was him sitting on a chair with a bright light shining
down on</B>
<BR><B>him.&nbsp; The light made a circle about a 5 foot radius from the
chair.&nbsp; Beyond</B>
<BR><B>the light he could see shadows standing there, but they didn't enter
the</B>
<BR><B>light.&nbsp; He said he didn't feel the chair moving, but the people
in the dark</B>
<BR><B>would start rotating around him.&nbsp; Then one by one they would
step into the</B>
<BR><B>light.&nbsp; There were 15 of them all together.&nbsp; Once they
were in the light</B>
<BR><B>their faces were suddenly right in front of him and he was looking
eye to</B>
<BR><B>eye with them.&nbsp; The circle still turned and the faces rotated
in front of</B>
<BR><B>him.&nbsp; They would sometimes talk but he couldn't hear them.&nbsp;
This dream</B>
<BR><B>occurred every night for about 2 weeks.&nbsp; At this point the
student came to</B>
<BR><B>my psychology teacher and relayed the dream to him. My teacher told
him to</B>
<BR><B>try controlling the dream and changing it.&nbsp; This worked every
now and then,</B>
<BR><B>but the dream always started the same, and when the student wasn't</B>
<BR><B>successful, for whatever reason, the dream would continue the same
through</B>
<BR><B>the night.&nbsp; This finally ended one day when the student had
some kind of</B>
<BR><B>appointment which made him late for school that day.&nbsp; His mom
ended up</B>
<BR><B>dropping him off at the front of the building around noon with the
note, so</B>
<BR><B>he could be excused from the school he missed.&nbsp; This took him
through the</B>
<BR><B>main entrance, when usually he entered from the south door.&nbsp;
Upon walking</B>
<BR><B>through the main doors he was immediately drawn to the news article
on the</B>
<BR><B>wall about the famous bus crash.&nbsp; On the front page there was
the picture of</B>
<BR><B>the wrecked bus and the pictures of the 14 kids killed.&nbsp; 14
out of the 15</B>
<BR><B>faces from his dream it turned out.&nbsp; The 15th face was on the
opposite wall.</B>
<BR><B>A student was murdered on the way home from school one day, and
an article</B>
<BR><B>detailing it was hung on this wall.&nbsp; The 15 person from his
dream pictured</B>
<BR><B>here.</B>
<BR><B>OK that's all I'll tell for now.&nbsp; There are hundreds more stories
from that</B>
<BR><B>place.&nbsp; VERY unfortunately the school was torn down in the
summer of 95.</B>
<BR><B>They put a business complex and a movie theater in its place...yea...&nbsp;&nbsp;
A</B>
<BR><B>huge loss on both the historical, and the supernatural side of things.&nbsp;
They</B>
<BR><B>built a new school down the road from it and I always wonder if
the ghosts</B>
<BR><B>moved with the school, if they are haunting the movie theater, or
maybe they</B>
<BR><B>finally left.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>HANGMAN:THE STORY OF MY FATHER</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Unknown</B><B></B>

<P><B>My father was between 7&amp;9 when this happened.His mom found a
beautiful house in newfoundland,canada and it was an old house.For some
reason they were selling the house for cheap so my grandmother probably
afraid someone else would snatch it up before she could, she bought the
house.The problem was they were new to the neighborhood and hadn't known
anything about this house.Well as soon as they moved in strange things
happened in the house.The family would turn off every light in the house
and go out for dinner or something and when they came back the lights would
all be on.One while the mother and father were out and the boys (my father
and his older brother) were sleeping.When the parents came home all the
china was broken.And of course they blaimed the boys for them.One night
there was a thunderstorm,and the lights went out.So my grandmother gave
her sons some flahlights to cheack the fuse box.Because my grandfather
was not home to do it himself.Well&nbsp; they were down in the bvasement
fooling around,you now shining their flashlights on the roof....untill
they came upon a old rope noose hanging from the ceiling.Of course scared
out of their wits they ran upsatirs and told their mother.Later on when
the lights came back on my grandmother checked every part of the ceiling,no
noose was found.The next morning,my grandmother told the neighbor about
what was happening and how she thought the boys were doing it.The neighbor
was shocked and said didn't the realtor tell you?!</B>
<BR><B>The previous owner went mad and hanged him self in the basement!After
hearing that my grandmother packed up all she had in the house and drove
away.</B>
<BR><B>I know this was a true story because when I asked my Uncle if he
had ever lived in a haunted house and he told me the exact same story that
my father did!I still need to ask my grandmother but I'll get around to
it.Because of my father's story I am a beliver.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Ghost Of Grandmother</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Peace57118@Hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>one night i was sound asleep in my room when i suddenly awokle from
a noise that came near my desk. I turned over on my other side so that
i could see what made the noise and when i opened my eyes i saw a tall
lanky beared shape of a&nbsp; person and the shape looked like it was wearing
glasses. I thought i was just seeing things and i thought it was my dad
mom or sister trying to scare me but when i noticed that my dad was snoring
and my mom was at work and my sister was tossing and turning on her bad
i new that it wasn't any of them. After i noticed that something was really
there then i went and i hid under my covers. I peeked through a little
hole that i had and the shape was turning around to face the window and
then it turned its head towards me and i hid and i have never seen it since.
But it makes me wounder what it was. Was i just seeing things or was there
really something there? Two years have passed and i haven't seen anything
as strange as that but it still makes me think about that night everytime
i turn off my light to go to sleep. I still live in the house and i've
heard things in the attic to big to be mice or some kind of animal and
it sounds like its walking. But i just like to think that the thing in
the attic is my grandmother's spirit hoping that one day she'll come down
and see me again.</B>

<P><B>Ghost Hauntings</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: taurus217@yahoo.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Hi, I am eleven years old and live in Newnan. Please don't
laugh, but I have been in many ghost situations. Mainly because I've lived
in five houses, all being in Columbus (GA), Fayetteville(GA) and Newnan
(GA). My father and mother are divorced so my dad lives in Columbus, and
my mom in Newnan. Well what blows my mind is, every room my sister stays
in is colder than all the other rooms in the house. Except in columbus,
my room is way colder than the rest, well the point is, all the houses
i've lived in had a cold room.(odd, huh) Also my dads house i think is
ghost infested! to send a reply my e-mail adress is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; taurus217@yahoo.com
thanks for listening. if you would like futher stories just ask.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Floating Figure</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: W_ORTLOFF@email.msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was never a believer in ghosts until May 2001. I was on a country
road with my friend. As we were listening to the radio it started getting
all static, but then we heard faint voices over the radio. They were saying
things like: "Uuuuhhh", screaming, etc. Then we heard a man in his late
30's on the radio saying "Look behind you". We stoped and turned around
and saw this man, floating about 3 feet off the ground, with a long hunting
knife stained with blood. He was wearing a white shirt and blue jeans.
I sped out of there very fast but the man was floating and following us
with the knife. I went faster until I came to the highway. We went down
the highway talking about him and then stopped and pulled over. We turned
on the radio, the static was still there, to our horror the voice was saying
"I'll get you". We saw him in front of us but with other ghosts behind
him. We drove though him and just got out of there and got to our friends
house and told him about it. He explained to us that about 30 years ago
a man murdered his family and then killed his livestock, then he killed
himself. He then told us that the man said "Look behind you" and "I'll
get you" before he killed his family and that his house is right near the
area where he lived.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Candy Man and Bloody Mary</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: flashbackgirl2001@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I snt a story the other day thats probally better than this but I'll
tell it anyways.</B>
<BR><B>The day after our field trip last year most of us went ot the lock
in at Lincoln Baptist Church.Some friends,some forth graders,and I all
went in the bathroom and said the candyman thing.Well Courtney screamed
the whole bathroom fills up w/ steam and we locked the door and we can't
find the light switch.There we are screaming meghan's mom trying to get
us out we're trying to pound the door down Courtney it now crawling on
the floor gasping for air saying 'its got me!help!!'.We're stuck in there
screaming for like 15 min. and Meghans mom shines a light under the door(we
could barley see)Dannellie turns the light on and we run out and the mirror
is dark pink all most red and Courtney has her shirt ripped shes blue and
has a long cut going down her neck and back.She had to get 2 stiches in
one part of her back.We found the light swich opened the door and the room
is so thick w/ steam u can barley see.By now theres a crowd around the
bathroom and everyone wants to go in there.It was os scary!</B>
<BR><B>This happened to my half brother.I had a sleepover about 2mon. after
the Candyman thing and we dared him to do bloodymary.He did.He was screaming.He
ran out and he had 2 scratches on one side of his face and 6 on the other.He
told us every detail:He had said everything he waited for about 15 sec.
and he said the mirror turned red,little balls of lights had started to
flash all around him and he said it look like a woman walking on train
tracks w/ a baby.A train comes by and kills the baby and the woman goes
crazy and he said something came through the mirror and scratched him up.We
were all afraid. we were all bunched up on the couch that night.</B>
<BR><B>I still shrudder to think about those things to this day.Plz don't
do any of that stuff!!I didn't listen to the warning and I can't sleep
without someone in the same room.</B>
