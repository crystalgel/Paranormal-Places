<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; I have been reading others stories on this fabulous site and
decided to share one of the most significant ones that happened to me.&nbsp;
I have been very intrigued by the paranormal since I can remember, and
have been relatively sensitive to picking up others emotions and presences
(especially in the spirit world).&nbsp; When I was 12 years old, a dear
uncle of mine passed away due to heart failure.&nbsp; Previous to this
incident he had moved out of his house, and my family had moved in.&nbsp;
The house was just too big for him alone.&nbsp; Donnie (my uncle), who
was also</b>
<br><b>paraplegic, left some belongings including a few old wheelchairs
in the garage.&nbsp; That evening after his funeral, I decided to turn
in.&nbsp; I really don't know if I just cried myself to sleep and dreaming,
or if this really happened but it is still very clear in my memory.&nbsp;
In my bedroom was a door leading off to the garage.&nbsp; I remember being
interrupted by the creaking sound of the garage door, hearing a wheelchair
coming up the ramp, and seeing an empty wheelchair at the side of my bed.&nbsp;
At that time a wavery shape appeared and the image turned a little</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;more clear...it was Donnie.&nbsp; He then stood up and told
me that everything was going to be alright.&nbsp; Hugged, pecked me on
the cheek, sat back in the wheelchair and it left my room.&nbsp; I didn't
dare tell my mother of this incident, it was hard enough dealing with his
death.&nbsp; I kept it silent for 12 years.&nbsp; My grandmother and I
were sitting around last week talking about Donnie, and I finally decided
to tell her about my experience.&nbsp; This drew tears to her eyes, she
had experienced almost the same thing at the same time.&nbsp; To this very
day, I feel like he is watching over my son and I.&nbsp; Periodically I
will see flashes of light in the hallway between my sons room and mine,
and feel a</b>
<br><b>strong presence. My son frequently stands in the hallway talking
with his head up like someone is there, and saying "what's that mommy?"
while pointing in the air.&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of months ago I had a friend
visiting back from L.A., I was on a brief phone call when I saw her eyes
widen and mouth drop.&nbsp; I promptly ended the call to question her.&nbsp;
She replied "You have a friend living here, don't you?".&nbsp; I laughed
nervously.&nbsp; She had picked up several things from this entity.&nbsp;
It was a man, and she had also mentioned something about being of Native
American decent.&nbsp; This is what shocked me the most, because Donnie
was native american.&nbsp; I have never spoke to her about my family in
depth,and that was the first time she had been to my apartment.&nbsp; Obviously,
this spirit intends no harm and I feel safe in my home.&nbsp; In my mind
Ithink it is him, so I will let you decide for yourselves.&nbsp; Thank
you for listening.</b>

<p><b><font size=+2>Another Haunting Experience</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MagMug6531@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When I was in my teens, my parents were in the process of renovating
our</b>
<br><b>basement &amp; garage into a family room.&nbsp; They had the wall
separating the two</b>
<br><b>rooms torn down and the garage door was replaced by a regular door.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>father had a wood stove installed and a plywood subfloor also to
be covered</b>
<br><b>with carpeting at a later time.</b>
<br><b>One night I awoke to the sounds of people talking and walking around
in the</b>
<br><b>basement.&nbsp; I got out of bed and went to the top of the stairs.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>downstairs was dark.&nbsp; I called my mother and father, but there
was no reply</b>
<br><b>from them.&nbsp; However the noise did stop.&nbsp; I went back to
bed.&nbsp; As soon as I</b>
<br><b>got into bed, the sounds started again.&nbsp; Louder this time.&nbsp;
Eventhough the</b>
<br><b>sound of talking was loud, I couldn't recognize any of the voices
or</b>
<br><b>distinguish any of the words.&nbsp; I tried to sleep anyway, figuring
my parents</b>
<br><b>has some friends over for cocktails, or maybe some neighbors had
company and</b>
<br><b>brought them over to visit.&nbsp; My parents were very social and
often did this.</b>
<br><b>The noise was too loud and I couldn't sleep.&nbsp; I got out of
bed and when I</b>
<br><b>opened my bedroom door, the noise stopped.&nbsp; All was quiet expcept
for the</b>
<br><b>snoring sounds coming from my parents' room.&nbsp; I peeked inside
my mom and</b>
<br><b>dad's room and saw the two of them sound asleep!&nbsp; Heart pounding,
I ran back</b>
<br><b>into my room, jumped into bed and pulled the covers over my head.&nbsp;
The noises</b>
<br><b>did not return and I fell asleep this way.</b>
<br><b>I never found out who was having a party in our basement.&nbsp;
Oh yeah, my</b>
<br><b>parents sold the house before the room was ever finished.</b><b></b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I've been a fan of your site for some time...and despite having quite
a</b>
<br><b>few experiences, this is the first time I'm submitting something.&nbsp;
I've</b>
<br><b>always been very sensitive to things...too many to count.&nbsp;
Luckily I</b>
<br><b>seem to have the ability to turn this "gift" on and off like a TV
-</b>
<br><b>lately I've kept it off due to being so busy in the normal world...haha!</b><b></b>
<p><b>This happened last year on Christmas Day.&nbsp; I had always been
VERY close</b>
<br><b>to my maternal grandfather - we did everything together.&nbsp; I'm
30 years</b>
<br><b>old now, but he passed away shortly after I turned 13.&nbsp; I saw
him after</b>
<br><b>the day of his death at my house...and we talked.&nbsp; He told
me he was</b>
<br><b>doing great and having a good time where he was - and mentioned
to me</b>
<br><b>that he no longer felt 72 and laughed. (He was always happy and</b>
<br><b>laughing!) I still feel his presence from time to time, I think
he likes</b>
<br><b>to make sure that I'm still being good!&nbsp; This past Christmas,
we all</b>
<br><b>gathered at my mother's house for gifts and dinner.&nbsp; There
is an old</b>
<br><b>grandfather clock that she inherited from my grandfather after his</b>
<br><b>passing.&nbsp; It is beautiful and quite old - from 1757.&nbsp;
Needless to say,</b>
<br><b>this clock is non-functioning - it hasn't worked for 50 years...the</b>
<br><b>weights are out of the clock which would make the pendulum swing
and</b>
<br><b>trigger a chime.&nbsp; We gathered in the great room where the clock
is, and</b>
<br><b>started opening up gifts.&nbsp; For some reason, I mentioned how
I always</b>
<br><b>missed my grandfather this time of year.&nbsp; After I said that,
the</b>
<br><b>pendulum started to sway in the clock...not just slowly - but very
fast,</b>
<br><b>back and forth.&nbsp; Then a few chimes ringed out of the clock.&nbsp;
I wish I</b>
<br><b>would have taken a picture of the faces of my family...I think it
was a</b>
<br><b>mixture of fear and amazement.&nbsp; I just knew it was my grandpa
sharing</b>
<br><b>the day with us and wishing us all a Merry Christmas!!!&nbsp; Everyone</b>
<br><b>laughed and until the last gift was opened, the pendulum just swung</b>
<br><b>away.&nbsp; After the last gift was opened...the clock stopped dead.&nbsp;
I'm</b>
<br><b>sure he'll still be around for many more Christmases with us!</b><b></b>
<p><b>Thanks for letting me share this story!</b>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><b></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Farm Hand</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>From: Steve</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This story is about the resident ghost on my farm in central Indiana.&nbsp;
He is not a malevolent sprit and comes and goes with no particular schedule.
First, a little history about the farm.&nbsp; The home we live in was constructed
in the 1840's and was an underground railway station prior to the War between
the States.&nbsp; There is a room upstairs with a door about 3 feet in
height.&nbsp; The door is fitted very tight into a frame, and opens inward
into a bare windowless room about 5 feet in height, and measures approximately
4' x 20' in size.&nbsp; The barn was constructed in 1881 and was a livery
stop on the old National Road(U.S. 40).&nbsp; Our first encounter with
anything out of the ordinary had to do with the room that was used to hide
runaway slaves.&nbsp; As I mentioned the door only opens outward, and fits
very tight into the frame.&nbsp; The door can not be forced to move in
an inward motion.&nbsp; My oldest son was sitting</b>
<br><b>on a trunk talking to his brother, with his back leaning against
the door of the hidden room.&nbsp; During the conversation he began to
hear a sound that he described as that of "coat hangers" rattling together
coming from the hidden room.&nbsp; Suddenly, the door he was leaning againstgave
inward towards the room and just as suddenly moved outward to it's original
position shoving my son off the trunk.&nbsp; Both boys flew down the stairs
and reported what had just happened.The next incident involved me personally.&nbsp;
I was sitting in the living room during the afternoon, and happened to
notice through the open door to the master bedroom the shadow of a man
cross the east wall of the room.&nbsp; Thinking that it was on of our sons,
I advised them to please get out of our bedroom.(there are two entrances)&nbsp;
I received no response except that the shadow moved across the wall again
going</b>
<br><b>in the same direction as before.&nbsp; I jumped up from the chair,
and went to the door of the bedroom, and found it to be empty.&nbsp; Further
investigation revealed that the boys were outside in the barn.On another
occasion someone decided to practice on the piano.&nbsp; We inherited an
antique upright piano from the previous owner, who was</b>
<br><b>very emphatic that he did not want it.&nbsp; We were happy to keep
it as my wife is an excellent pianist, and it is a beautiful piece of craftsmanship.&nbsp;
One afternoon while I was alone in the house someone played five notes
on the piano.&nbsp; This has not occurred again as of this writing.The
only place in the house that makes anyone uncomfortable is the hallway.&nbsp;
Nothing happens there......you just find yourself scooting along at a quicker
pace when you pass through.&nbsp; I receive the sensation that something
is right behind me until I exit the hallway.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>also from time to time will experience items disappearing only to
turn up in plain sight.&nbsp; We also on occasion will hear knocking come
fromthe walls and ceiling. My oldest son, before leaving for college, always
took care of our livestock.&nbsp; He repeatedly would tell me that he would
hear footsteps in the hayloft while he would be working down below.&nbsp;
He also reported that the stall doors would open and close while he would
be in the barn.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I would account this as being caused by the wind except that
the stall doors slide, and are not hinged.&nbsp; I told my son that the
next time he heard footsteps to tell me right away and we would check it
out. The opportunity came early on a Saturday morning.&nbsp; My son woke
me up and said that someone or something was in the hayloft.&nbsp; I jumped
out of bed and through on my clothes and picked up my pistol and portable
radio(I am a deputy marshal).&nbsp; I went out to the barn and stood outside
the door directly in front of the only possible exit from the barn loft
except for moving the massive sliding doors at the top of the ramp.&nbsp;
I announced that who ever was in the barn was trespassing and should come
down pronto.&nbsp; Honestly I did not expect any response.&nbsp; To my</b>
<br><b>surprise almost before I finished my warning we heard what sounded
like one of the horses running across the barn loft floor and something
slammed into the wall of the barn with such force that the barn gave a
slight shudder.&nbsp; I promptly radioed to dispatch that I had an intruder
in my barn and soon two deputies arrived.&nbsp; Together the three of us
searched the loft......you guessed it there was no sign of anything out
of the ordinary.&nbsp; This causes me much torment from my fellow deputies
even today. The really extraordinary event happened a few nights later.&nbsp;
We were all asleep, I have no idea what time it was when suddenly I woke
up for no reason.&nbsp; I couldn't help but feel that someone was in the
room besides my wife and myself.&nbsp; Looking towards the foot of the
bed I was</b>
<br><b>shocked to see a man with longish red hair and a beard wearing a
green checked shirt, slowly moving across the room.&nbsp; Thinking that
it was an intruder I grabbed my pistol and instinctively covered him.&nbsp;
I then noticed that I could not see any body from the waist down!&nbsp;
The apparition never looked at me it just kept moving across the room.&nbsp;
It's movements were of a slight side to side motion, giving the impression
that it was walking with a slow shuffling type walk.&nbsp; The ghost continued
across the room and passed through the closet door.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I just sat there in disbelief.&nbsp; I tried to convince myself
that I was dreaming, even though I knew I was not.&nbsp; Some odd notes
to this experience are that the room was pitch black, but I saw the apparition
in full color, as if he were the only thing in the room that was illuminated.&nbsp;
Also odd was that for the duration of this event I felt nothing even close
to fear.....only amazement. Checking with the two previous owner of the
property, they reported on occasion hearing music in the house and feeling
uncomfortable in the hallway.&nbsp; Other than these reports they experienced
nothing exceptional.&nbsp; We have also discovered the existence of another
spirit.......that of a horse that on occasion can be seen briefly walking
the fence.&nbsp; I will also add that while typing this narrative I heard
a loud pop</b>
<br><b>right behind me.&nbsp; The sound that you hear when a light bulb
blows.&nbsp; Oh well, we haven't had any thing occur for a while......maybe
someone is reading over my shoulder.</b>

<p><b><font size=+2>Who Took My Brush</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jaschdl@defnet.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I'm 30 years old,,I should tell you right now that I have personally
never</b>
<br><b>actually experienced anything that you may have,,,the only thing
that</b>
<br><b>happened to me was one morning as I was getting ready for school,,I
had a</b>
<br><b>brush in my hand and took it into the kitchen with me,,I set the
brush down</b>
<br><b>on the counter,,poured myself a glass of orange juice,,went back
into the</b>
<br><b>bathroom,,,remembering I layed the brush on the counter, I went
to get it</b>
<br><b>and it was not there,,I looked all over for it,,,well, after school,
my</b>
<br><b>Mother asked my sister and I, which one of us had put the hair brush
in the</b>
<br><b>refrigerator,,,yes, a skeptic can say that I did it in unintentionally
and</b>
<br><b>forgotten about it,,,but, I don't think so.&nbsp; Most of what happened
in our</b>
<br><b>house happened to my mother and two sisters,,,just a few times to
my Dad,</b>
<br><b>that we know about. Nothing (really) to me or my brother. Although
I did</b>
<br><b>feel pressure on the back of my neck when I would leave my bedroom
and walk</b>
<br><b>down the hallway,,Most of the time I would run,,,as soon as I was
out of the</b>
<br><b>hallway,,,the feeling would go away,,,I'm&nbsp; sitting here thinking
of which</b>
<br><b>story to give you,, I think this is one of the scariest:&nbsp; My
sister and I</b>
<br><b>were in our teens and home alone,,we had gotten into an argument
earlier</b>
<br><b>that evening. We were both in the living room,,me at one end watching</b>
<br><b>television and she at the other,,sitting on the floor listening
to the</b>
<br><b>stereo with headphones on. "Someone" touched her on top of her head,</b>
<br><b>softly,,pushing her bangs into her eyes,,,she swung her arm up,
thinking it</b>
<br><b>was me picking on her,,and she said "Don't touch me!" and looked
behind her</b>
<br><b>and saw no one,,,she ran over to me and asked me if I had done it,,I
of</b>
<br><b>course said "No!" and she told me what had happened and we sat together
the</b>
<br><b>rest of the night until someone came home. We don't know any of
the history</b>
<br><b>on the house or land,,we no longer live there and ironically, we
were told</b>
<br><b>that a Pastor lives in the house now,,we often wonder if they have
ever</b>
<br><b>experienced the same kinds of hauntings,,,and often thought of going
back to</b>
<br><b>the house to find that out.&nbsp; There is more to tell,,,just don't
have the</b>
<br><b>time tonight,,,Haven't read your site yet,,,I will, only because
this</b>
<br><b>subject interests me!</b>
<br><b>I'll be back for more.</b>

<p><b><font size=+2>Hair Pulling</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Mysravin@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Recently I have had some strange things happening in my home.&nbsp;
It doesn't</b>
<br><b>seem to matter what time of day or night these things just happen
whenever.</b>
<br><b>It does always seem to start with the odor of stale beer, though
I nor anyone</b>
<br><b>here drinks at all, I can smell a strong odor of beer and friends
have also</b>
<br><b>complained about the smell shortly before other things happen.&nbsp;
Cupboard</b>
<br><b>doors open, lights brown out, and my hair has been pulled many times.&nbsp;
I have</b>
<br><b>also sensed someone standing near me, and have heard sounds as if
someone is</b>
<br><b>rattling coins in their hand.&nbsp; Also have 3 cats and a dog who
all seem</b>
<br><b>reluctant to enter the kitchen which up until recently was their
favorite</b>
<br><b>room in the house.&nbsp; I have had to move the water dish to the
laundry room</b>
<br><b>because several times as a pet has been drinking they would suddenly
dash</b>
<br><b>from the kitchen either whining or with tail bushed.&nbsp; I have
had many strange</b>
<br><b>experiences in my life so these don't really bother me too much
(I simply</b>
<br><b>tell it to stop it, or say not now, and it will quit for a while),
but it is</b>
<br><b>bothering my friends who visit.&nbsp; I know the history of this
house and know</b>
<br><b>that noone has died here nor have any traumatic events occurred
here.&nbsp; I feel</b>
<br><b>the strangest thing is the smell of beer, and my full grown adult
friends</b>
<br><b>being afraid, when Debbie's hair was pulled she about jumped out
of her skin</b>
<br><b>and has not been back since, (she insists that we go out or that
I visit her</b>
<br><b>at her house),&nbsp; The animals are definitely uncomfortable, and
my 12 yr. old</b>
<br><b>son seems almost oblivious to these occurrences, only a few times
has he</b>
<br><b>mentioned being bothered by the cupboards or the lights and has
not mentioned</b>
<br><b>the smell or the hair pulling at all.&nbsp; My sister is coming
to visit in April</b>
<br><b>and if these things are still occurring I am confident that the
two of us can</b>
<br><b>put a stop to it.&nbsp; I just thought I would share these events
with you and ask</b>
<br><b>for any input that your readers might have.&nbsp; They (or you)
can e-mail me at</b>
<br><b>MysRavin@aol.com with any comments or suggestions.</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Dave,</b>
<br><b>A few years ago I had the weirdest experience of my life, and I
have never</b>
<br><b>been able to explain it.&nbsp; I have only told a couple of people,
and they think</b>
<br><b>I was imagining things.&nbsp; I am normally a very rational guy,
good in school,</b>
<br><b>and very religous.&nbsp; So there is no reason for me to make this
up.&nbsp; I was</b>
<br><b>hoping you could read my story and tell me what you think.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was late at night and I was alone in our house
with my Dad.&nbsp; He was</b>
<br><b>already asleep, and I had just closed my door to go to bed.&nbsp;
I turned off the</b>
<br><b>lights and got into bed with my two dogs.&nbsp; Less than a minute
later my two</b>
<br><b>dogs both started barking.&nbsp; When I sat up to spank them I saw
a figure on the</b>
<br><b>floor of my bedroom.&nbsp; It was a black silouette, and it appeared
to be</b>
<br><b>kneeling.&nbsp; My dogs jumped off of the bed and began running
in circles</b>
<br><b>barking.&nbsp; The weird thing is that they were running right around
the figure.</b>
<br><b>If it weren't for that I might think I was imagining things.&nbsp;
Withing seconds</b>
<br><b>the figure vanished.&nbsp; Faded is actually a better way to describe
it.&nbsp; Once it</b>
<br><b>was gone my dogs quit barking.&nbsp; I know it could not have been
my Dad because</b>
<br><b>my door was closed and he doesn't disappear.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; The
previous owner of the</b>
<br><b>house had her husband die while she lived there.&nbsp; Before this
incident</b>
<br><b>happened little things had happened before.&nbsp; The main thing
was that my alarm</b>
<br><b>clock would go off in the middle of the night, or when I know I
had set it</b>
<br><b>that night, it would be off in the mornings.&nbsp; I always thought
maybe my</b>
<br><b>brother was messing with me.&nbsp; So do you think I'm crazy too?&nbsp;

<p><b><font size=+2>My House is Haunted</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Kyhillhop@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I love the house I live in, my father purchased the house as part
of a farm</b>
<br><b>in the 1970's. The farm connected to his farm.</b>
<br><b>The tenants had reported several unexplained things in the house,
my mother</b>
<br><b>just thought they were not telling the truth.</b>
<br><b>I moved into the house 10 years ago, and boy, they were not lying!</b>
<br><b>I hear footsteps on the stairs at all times during the day. Not
to mention</b>
<br><b>the unexplained loud noises coming from upstairs!</b>
<br><b>My dog will not sleep upstairs and refuses to go up alone. Recently
a shelf</b>
<br><b>fell from my daughters wall, the next day it was back up! I accused
her of</b>
<br><b>putting it back up, she swears she did not. I did not push the issue
,</b>
<br><b>thinking she would get scared, we lied and told her my husband put
it up!</b>
<br><b>several times my daughter has come to the bottom of the stairs to
ask me what</b>
<br><b>I wanted, only to find out i was not the one to call out for her.
And just</b>
<br><b>the other day I thought I seen my daughter come in from the back
porch only</b>
<br><b>to find her laying on the couch sound asleep.</b>
<br><b>My baby looks up at the stairs and smiles and laughs and nothing!
This is so</b>
<br><b>weird that i take him in another room!</b>
<br><b>The house is was built in the early 40's on the foundation of a
two story log</b>
<br><b>home.</b>
<br><b>The house and farm had been in the same family for years when my
father</b>
<br><b>bought it.</b>

<p><b><font size=+2>I have lived with ghosts</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Tigger2094@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>The house I grew up in was in Jacksonville, FL.&nbsp; My mother told
me there used</b>
<br><b>to be a big field that was turned into an air field for one of the
world</b>
<br><b>wars.&nbsp; I don't know who the ghosts were that lived in the house,
but they</b>
<br><b>were friendly.&nbsp; My family believes in ghosts because of their
various</b>
<br><b>experiences, and we were all talking, cousins, my sister, and my
parents, one</b>
<br><b>night about the ones that live in the house.</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was about a year old, my mother said, her and my father were
laying in</b>
<br><b>bed when they heard me cry.&nbsp; As my mother was going to check
on me, they both</b>
<br><b>heard the back door open and close again.&nbsp; When they checked
the door, it was</b>
<br><b>the way they left it:&nbsp; chained and locked from the inside.</b><b></b>
<p><b>My mother got a sense one day that something would go amiss.&nbsp;
Someone</b>
<br><b>actually told her to get out of the house, as soon as possible.&nbsp;
She went</b>
<br><b>down the road and took my aunt to the store.&nbsp; When they came
back, the door</b>
<br><b>was kicked in and jewelry, the 1920's era police gun that my great</b>
<br><b>grandfather gave her, a tv, and vcr were missing.&nbsp; I was about
10, and when I</b>
<br><b>came home that day from school, I saw police cars around the house.&nbsp;
If it</b>
<br><b>weren't for that voice, my mother, who was home alone, would have
been hurt,</b>
<br><b>to say the least.</b><b></b>
<p><b>As I got older, I remember seeing shadowy figures standing by my
door and the</b>
<br><b>door to my sister's room.&nbsp; Every once in a while, I would see
someone in the</b>
<br><b>living room, but it was not a person.&nbsp; I would hear footsteps.&nbsp;
They were not</b>
<br><b>the creaking of an old house; I could distinguish between footsteps
and</b>
<br><b>boards creaking.&nbsp; One night, I was laying on my bed; I guess
I was about 13</b>
<br><b>then.&nbsp; My dog was in the room with me, asleep.&nbsp; All of
a sudden, she stood</b>
<br><b>up, looked at the wall behind me, and started her low growl that
tells when</b>
<br><b>someone uninvited is in the house.&nbsp; When I looked behind me,
I only saw a</b>
<br><b>shadow for a second, and then it disappeared.&nbsp; I would see
the ghosts only a</b>
<br><b>few times since that night, not like I had used to.&nbsp; I moved
a couple of</b>
<br><b>years ago, and so far, I haven't seen anything.&nbsp; I can sense
something around</b>
<br><b>me when noone else is, but that was the extent of my most recent
encounters.</b><b></b>

<br><b><font size=+2>A Haunting in Massachusetts</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MsMMoge@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;I have a story for you and your web site. Massachusetts, in
the township of</b>
<br><b>Groton, off of old Nodd Rd., there was an old house. My grandmother
and her</b>
<br><b>family lived there. She was alone ,on several occasions, watching
her soap</b>
<br><b>operas. She claimed to hear footsteps. When she would investigate
,no one was</b>
<br><b>there . She said she had many times turned the outside light off
only to find</b>
<br><b>it on in the morning. My aunt Nancy awoke one night, to whom she
thought, was</b>
<br><b>my uncle being cute by blowing in her ear . She turned to find no
one there.</b>
<br><b>When my sister was 5 years old, she was sitting at the top of the
staircase</b>
<br><b>playing. My uncle and I&nbsp; were in an adjacent room where he
was building a</b>
<br><b>model car and I was watching. All of a sudden, we heard my sister
upstairs</b>
<br><b>screaming and then she started to sob. We scrambled up the staircase
to ask</b>
<br><b>her why she had screamed. Her reply was that my uncle Paul was there
with his</b>
<br><b>scary Halloween mask on. She said that after she screamed that he
immediately</b>
<br><b>went through a whole bunch of junk stored at the top of the staircase
and to</b>
<br><b>the right and proceeded right through there she said. She was pointing</b>
<br><b>directly at the wall behind the junk. My uncle and I looked for
my uncle up</b>
<br><b>there. I found his mask in his room. His radio was on but turned
down to</b>
<br><b>nothing. He was not home at the time. My grandmother told us that
he was at</b>
<br><b>work at the time and he had not been there since earlier in the
morning. Keep</b>
<br><b>in mind this took place in midday. My grandmother was convinced
that my</b>
<br><b>sister had seen J.J. the ghost. She claimed that a man named J.J.
and his</b>
<br><b>wife and child had lived there. She said J.J. had lost his wife
and his</b>
<br><b>little blonde-haired&nbsp; daughter in a car accident. She said
he had been so</b>
<br><b>struck with grief that he shot himself in the head in the very room
that my</b>
<br><b>uncle and I were in prior to rescuing my sister. Incidentally, my
sister</b>
<br><b>happened to be a blonde-haired child. This is probably why J.J.
appeared to</b>
<br><b>my sister. Anyways, this is a true story. The old house does not
stand there</b>
<br><b>anymore . I believe the gas furnace had some kind of problem that
caused the</b>
<br><b>house to blow up or it may have been arson. I'm not sure about that
part but</b>
<br><b>I do know a new house was built on that same spot. I cannot tell
you if J.J.</b>
<br><b>is still there because I do not know the new tenants/owner. He was
when I was</b>
<br><b>a child of nine. That was over 20 years ago.</b>

<p><b><font size=+2>Pocono Paranormal</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Wyytchy99@cs.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I actually have a couple of stories that happened to me.&nbsp; I
used to live up</b>
<br><b>in the Pocono's, (in Pennsylvania) , a place that is kind of known
for their</b>
<br><b>ghosts.&nbsp; I was about 9 or 10 years old when I was first contacted
consciously</b>
<br><b>by a ghost.&nbsp; Me and my sister were coming in from outside,
we had just got</b>
<br><b>done playing basketball, it was about 9:00pm or so (it was at least
dark out</b>
<br><b>and my parents went to bed already) As soon as we came in I saw
my sister</b>
<br><b>gazing in a panic at the television screen, at first I didn't really
pay any</b>
<br><b>attention until I saw her loose all the color in her face, so immediately
I</b>
<br><b>looked at the TV.&nbsp; To my suprise there was a young girl, teenage
years, with</b>
<br><b>long straight hair, with absolutely no color, it wasn't white, black,
tan,</b>
<br><b>not even gray.&nbsp; It's kind of hard to explain, I have never
seen a color such</b>
<br><b>as this.&nbsp; She was on the inside of the TV facing out.&nbsp;
She was pounding her</b>
<br><b>fists on ther screen and yelling but with no voice, I couldn't hear
anything.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;She only lasted for a moment or so and then slowly faded away.&nbsp;
Once it was</b>
<br><b>gone we just stood there so scared that we couldn't even move, my
body</b>
<br><b>finally broke in and I ran to get the remote to turn the TV off
but again to</b>
<br><b>my suprise the TV wasn't even on.</b>
<br><b>Another time would be when my dead grandmother came to vist me.</b>
<br><b>Me and my family were having a lot of money problems and just regular</b>
<br><b>ordinary problems that every family gets to experience.&nbsp; I
was again about 9</b>
<br><b>years of age and oddly I&nbsp; comprehended and understood what
kind of</b>
<br><b>"sufferings" my family was going through, therefore leaving me to
worry.</b>
<br><b>One morning I woke up pretty early (the sun was just about coming
up) and I</b>
<br><b>was just sitting there all alone in the living room contemplating
all the</b>
<br><b>problems, and starting to worry, when all of a sudden I bright ray
of sun</b>
<br><b>shine landed upon a nativity set that once belonged to my grandmother.&nbsp;
All</b>
<br><b>of the blinds and curtains were closed for we close them every night,
and no</b>
<br><b>one had yet woke up besides of me, to open them.&nbsp; As I was
staring at the</b>
<br><b>nativity set in amazement I felt I warm sensation being pressed
on my back.</b>
<br><b>I wasn't scared at all I actually felt relief, I suddenly stopped
worrying</b>
<br><b>and thinking about any kind of problem.&nbsp; My mind was completely
set at ease.</b>
<br><b>I knew automatically that it was her, I don't know how to explain
how I know,</b>
<br><b>but I just do. And to this day when I start worrying about something
a little</b>
<br><b>too much than necessary I always feel that warm hand.</b>
<br><b>Unfortunately not all of my stories are that pleasant.</b>
<br><b>A couple of years after my first encounter with the TV girl, I had
another</b>
<br><b>fright.&nbsp; Me and my brother were walking in the woods, just
kind of exploring</b>
<br><b>and being typical kids.&nbsp; We were about half a mile into the
woods when all of</b>
<br><b>a sudden this grayish, translucent figure started to approach us.&nbsp;
We weren't</b>
<br><b>quite sure what or maybe who it was so we sorta stood there in amazement
(you</b>
<br><b>know the mouths dropped to the floor, the eyes bugged out, and the
body very</b>
<br><b>still).&nbsp; When they figure got about 15-20 ft. away from us
we could tell that</b>
<br><b>it wasn't "someone" rather something.&nbsp; We automatically started
to run as</b>
<br><b>fast as our little legs could run we could see the thing catching
up to us</b>
<br><b>when we just stepped one foot out of the woods and the thing just
stopped</b>
<br><b>dead in it's tracks and then disappeared, me and my brother ran
in the house</b>
<br><b>to tell our parents but of course they didn't believe us and told
us we were</b>
<br><b>imagining things. So we just let it go.</b>
<br><b>Another time would be when we were "skipping rocks" into this pond,
that</b>
<br><b>rested only across the street and behind a building, when we looked
behind us</b>
<br><b>into the fields to find Indians, but they weren't "normal" I guess
you can</b>
<br><b>say.&nbsp; they were a good 100 yards away, so it wasn't completely
detailed.</b>
<br><b>They were solid not transparent but only the upper half of their
bodies were</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; And the bodies were at least 1-2 ft. above the ground.&nbsp;
They just</b>
<br><b>stood there watching us.&nbsp; And I guess they were trying to tell
us not to go</b>
<br><b>into that area that they were because we never went even a foot
past the pond</b>
<br><b>not even when our dogs ran away into that area, but the dogs also
returned</b>
<br><b>immediately. They didn't approach us, and we didn't approach them
we weren't</b>
<br><b>scared, I really can't remember what we were feeling but I know
we weren't</b>
<br><b>scared.&nbsp; The Indians stood there with their deer, which also
had only half of</b>
<br><b>their bodies.&nbsp; I'm not suprised that they are Indians.&nbsp;
Indians lived there</b>
<br><b>long ago, I mean the place is called Tobyhanna (tell me that ain't
an Indian</b>
<br><b>name)</b>
<br><b>Another time with an encounter with an Indian was at a place where
my mother</b>
<br><b>worked, She worked at Shawnee (another Indian name) and there was
a fountain</b>
<br><b>infront of the building where I saw I translucent white women, kinda
swaying</b>
<br><b>in the wind (although there was no wind)&nbsp; she just stood there
looking into</b>
<br><b>the water, whenever I tried to approach her she would disappear.&nbsp;
There were</b>
<br><b>many witnesses to this women, she would always show herself to the
guests.</b>
<br><b>Behind the building was a small river and on the other side of the
river</b>
<br><b>nothing but trees and bushes.&nbsp; When me and my sister were sitting
there just</b>
<br><b>our feet in the water I would see this floating head, I don't know
if it was</b>
<br><b>transparent or solid, it was kind of hazy. And the head had a bunch
of red</b>
<br><b>and black feathers behind it's head, had black, RED, AND WHITE,
FACE PAINT</b>
<br><b>ON.&nbsp; We only saw ahead but there may have been a body but covered
by the</b>
<br><b>bushes.&nbsp; The head just stayed there watching us, again probably
just</b>
<br><b>protecting their "Sacred Land."</b><b></b>
<p><b>A few years ago me and my parents moved to another area.&nbsp; We
moved into a</b>
<br><b>very old house, it doesn't look old because it was refinished.&nbsp;
The house is</b>
<br><b>really 100 years old.&nbsp; Many people have lived in this house.&nbsp;
Just a year ago</b>
<br><b>I started practicing witch craft, and into things that help you
free your</b>
<br><b>mind (Tarot Cards, learning how to tap into my psychic side, meditation,</b>
<br><b>etc.)_And since then I have become very perceptive to the ghosts
in my house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;We have at least one in each room.&nbsp; The one in my sisters
room are little</b>
<br><b>children and an older man that for some reason tends to scare me
a little.</b>
<br><b>The children like to play at night time, they run around like crazy,
you can</b>
<br><b>hear them from downstairs.&nbsp; The one in my room is very nice
and they come to</b>
<br><b>me in my sleep, They let me know what is going to happen in the
near future,</b>
<br><b>just little stuff, like what's going to be on TV, when dream about
a movie,</b>
<br><b>even if it hasn't been seen in a while, it will come on. they told
me my</b>
<br><b>sister was pregnant and was going to be a boy even though we were
all hoping</b>
<br><b>for a girl. Like I said it's just the little stuff.. They also like
to</b>
<br><b>rearrange my furniture and watch TV.&nbsp; When I am sleeping they
turn the TV on</b>
<br><b>and off. In the den is a middle aged man who wears suspenders and
a cowboy</b>
<br><b>hat, black pants, and a dirty white shirt.&nbsp; He leans on the
fire place and</b>
<br><b>watches us pass, and then if we are going upstairs he comes out
and follows</b>
<br><b>us and makes sure we make it up the stairs all right.&nbsp; Once
when I had a</b>
<br><b>broken ankle I was trying to walk up the stairs and I started to
fall back,</b>
<br><b>all of a sudden I felt something push me forwards.&nbsp; So every
time I make it</b>
<br><b>to the top of the stairs I turn around and say thank you.&nbsp;
The one in the</b>
<br><b>basement is an old bitter man he doesn't like to be bothered with,
so he some</b>
<br><b>times scares me a little.&nbsp; The ghosts in my house are all good
spirits, I am</b>
<br><b>sure of that because every month I do a ritual type spell to cleans
the</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; The spirits in my house have only scared me once.&nbsp;
That was when we</b>
<br><b>had a not very nice person living in the house, he was very manipulative
and</b>
<br><b>took advantage of us, and later to find out that he raped another
person in</b>
<br><b>the house, so lets just say he's a bad person, but me and my family
don't</b>
<br><b>have a good judgment of people.&nbsp; But the ghosts would try to
scare him, which</b>
<br><b>they succeeded in but to do it they also ended up scaring myself
, I sort of</b>
<br><b>got in the way I guess you can say.&nbsp; But once they scared this
bad person out</b>
<br><b>they came to me in my sleep and apologized (I guess) because one
morning I</b>
<br><b>woke up and never got scared of them again.&nbsp; And they always
let me know if</b>
<br><b>they don't want someone to be in the house.&nbsp; Like I said they
come to me in</b>
<br><b>my sleep.&nbsp; They tell me they don't like them and the next morning
I wake up</b>
<br><b>and dislike them myself..</b>
<br><b>It is a shame that there are some ghosts that do scare and harm
people, but I</b>
<br><b>am glad that is mot my situation.&nbsp; I'm not expecting you or
anyone to believe</b>
<br><b>me, I'm not looking for an approval, I'm just here to tell my story.&nbsp;
I've</b>
<br><b>sort of given up on trying to make people believe me (what can I
say they are</b>
<br><b>very simple minded[they don't want to know])</b>
<br><b>Well I thank you for listening to my experiences and I would like
to hear</b>
<br><b>what you have to think!!</b>
