<font size=+2>The Shadowman</font>
<p>By: PrettyPaws07@aol.com
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Ok,this is my story of the shadowman.Me and my cousin went to go to
<br>california to go to my grandma`s house.Well one night,me and my cousin
were
<br>watching TV and my Grandma was sleeping in her room.When I was reaching
for
<br>my soda on the desk beside me,I looked toward my room and a guy who
was
<br>around 6' 3", walked toward my room.The man was jet black and had no
features
<br>whatsoever.I started to shake real badly and then my cousin looked
and he saw
<br>it too.The shadow man stopped and turned his head toward us,possibly
looking
<br>at us, I couldnt tell.I started to cry and my cousin started shaking
really
<br>bad.Then the shadow man walked in our room.Me and my cousin were confused
and
<br>were wondering what was going on.Also many other strange things happedn
of
<br>seeing an eyeball on the wall and seeing the shadow man a second time.

<br>&nbsp;
<p>By: dford@bard.edu
<p>I was wondering what&nbsp; you would make of this experience that my
mother
<br>and sister had the other day.&nbsp; They went to visit my uncle who
lives in
<br>a senior citizen apartment complex.&nbsp; This is not s nursing home
but a
<br>high rise designed for seniors.&nbsp; When they left him and were walking
<br>across the parking lot to my sister's car both my mother and sister
<br>noticed a man sitting in the passenger seat of&nbsp; my sister's car.&nbsp;
They
<br>did not mention it to each other at the time.&nbsp; My sister didn't
want to
<br>panic my mother.&nbsp; It was quite icy and she was afraid that my
mom would
<br>panic and fall on the ice.&nbsp; My mother was in such a state of disbelief
<br>that she said she couldn't talk.&nbsp; When they were quite close to
the car,
<br>the man turned, looked right at them and then he was gone.&nbsp; At
that
<br>point my mom and sister described what they saw to each other--a man
<br>wearing large glasses and a knit hat.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both&nbsp; claim that he did not resemble anyone
they knew in life.&nbsp; My
<br>husband joked that maybe they had taken his parking space.&nbsp; My
sister
<br>has had no past or present experiences with a haunting in her car.&nbsp;
We
<br>are all curious as to why he appeared to both of them at that time,
in
<br>that place.

<p>By: catbacchus@home.com
<p>Back in 1981 on Christmas Day, my father took a picture of the family
in front of the fireplace with a Poloroid Instamatic
<br>&nbsp;Camera.&nbsp; As we watched it slowly develop we noticed the
image of two people standing behind us with their arms around each
<br>&nbsp;other.&nbsp; One was a woman and one was a man.&nbsp; They were
smiling and not frightening at all.&nbsp; They were quite opaque.
<br>We all tried to think of an explanation of how this could have happened
but couldn't come up with anything.&nbsp; My father
<br>&nbsp;became very frightened and tossed the picture into the fireplace
stating it was ridiculous.&nbsp; Two weeks later my father -
<br>&nbsp;who had leukemia- died.&nbsp; It seemed like more than a coincidence
to us.
<p>Thank you for letting me tell my story.

<p><font size=+2>Colorado Ghost Story</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>By: in2love@webtv.net
<br>Hello I wanted to tell my story about the time we lived in a older
house
<br>built in the 1900's. It is in a smaller old mining town, Lafayette
<br>Colorado. We moved in in 1996,and at first I had my doubts about moving
<br>in just because of the condition and location,but the price was
<br>affordable being we had three small children. Well we moved in and
the
<br>first thre weeks we noticed there electrical prob;ems lights were always
<br>blinking going off and on . so we called a electrician he couldn't
find
<br>anything but a couple of old wires and fixed them. Well then we noticed
<br>my 2 1/2 year old son woke up every night at the same time which was
<br>around the middle of the night screaming running around the house it
was
<br>as if he were in a trance or something, then a coupl of occasions my
<br>husband and I were confronted with the spirit when we were in bed.
We
<br>had to leave the house, We ever got ny good pictures of it or anything
I
<br>do also remember that whi;le I was living there i used to think I was
<br>having panic attacks becuse I i couldn't breath sometimes It felt like
<br>something was taking over me a veryweird feeling. Wel all of our
<br>problems ended the day we deciced to move out but I really wish i could
<br>find someone who can actually go in the house and check if there are
<br>still ghosts occupying the house.

<br><font size=+2>Strange Household</font>
<p>By: Shaun.Kehoe@cybrzn.com
<p>When I was about 6 yrs old, I moved to Wisconsin after the death of
my father. We moved to a small town which in earlier
<br>days had been occuppied by indians and town folk alike.&nbsp; The old
house we moved into had been the town whore house, or so
<br>Im told. Across the street from the house was a school in which the
yard stands a tree which was used for all the hanging
<br>executions. Many times as the years went by we kids in the neighborhood
dug holes in the yards and found some interesting
<br>items , such as button up boots, a bicycle built for 2, medicine bottles
and indian beads.&nbsp; I dont really remember anything
<br>&nbsp;out of the ordinary happening for the first couple of years that
we lived there but after that my entire adolescence was
<br>fear of having to go to bed in that house at night or ever being left
there alone.At first strange little things would
<br>happen, such as hearing strange noises. Then as time progressed things
were getting stranger and stranger. It was me and
<br>&nbsp;my mother and my brother that lived there. After a while the
ghosts in the house actually started showing themselves to
<br>us and touching us.At night I would go to sleep in my bed,with lights
on of course thinking that they would keep me safe
<br>from ghosts. I would keep my feet pulled up tight against my chest
because if I didnt something would grab my feet at the
<br>end of my bed and hold on tight! Then I would retreat to my moms bed
in a hurry and crawl in with her. With my mom snoring
<br>&nbsp;away oblivious to everything going on, I would slowly turn her
light on hoping she wouldnt notice and turn it off. Well
<br>&nbsp;the ghosts must have followed me in there because it wouldnt
be long and theyd be in there haunting me. I would loudly
<br>hear noises of bells ringing or chains rattling! Most nights would
go with fear and without sleep. I would usually fall
<br>asleep toward morning leaving me afew hours to get up for school. If
that wasnt scary enough, then they starting showing
<br>themselves to me. I had to walk through my living room one night to
get to the bathroom and there stood a line of ghosts
<br>i had to walk past. I think there had to be about 5 or so. I distinctly
remember one. It was a woman, wearing a long dress,
<br>&nbsp;button up boots, with a wide brimmed hat with a long ribbon flowing
from it. I think she stands out the most because she
<br>was the one who laughed at me and taunted me as I walked past them.
My brother was also bothered by the ghosts in that house.
<br>&nbsp; He would awaken in the morning with bruises on his chest because
the ghosts had been pounding on him during the night.
<br>He too was afraid. It went on until I was 16 and my mother decided
we needed a different house to live in. It was only a
<br>&nbsp;matter of years before I was married and we moved into a house
to rent which was in the same neighborhood,a few houses
<br>away to be exact. The house had an upstairs which I boarded off because
their were ghosts up there. At night I would hear
<br>&nbsp;the heavy footsteps of a man walking up there. I would hear windows
break that been left un touched. Coming home one night,
<br>&nbsp;I saw a man walking through my dining room from a window. I thought
it was my husband, but when I got inside, noone was
<br>home. Only the ghosts. I had my friends stay with me from then on when
my husband was gone to work and they too experienced
<br>everything as I did.Back then when I was a child, I thought to myself
that maybe I was dreaming or hallucinating or whatever.
<br>&nbsp;It took me until I was an adult to really look back and realize
and to convince myself that I had really experienced what
<br>I did. I am a true believer in ghosts. How could I not be?

<p><font size=+2>Smally Hall</font>
<p>By: PunkRawkBrittany@aol.com
<p>I am one of those people that enjoys the paranormal.&nbsp; My mother's
friend used
<br>to work at an old mental hospital in Princeton.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She
told us all about the
<br>place, how there was underground tunnels and about the building that
was
<br>closed when she had worked there..Smally Hall.&nbsp; Well, one night,
her mother
<br>drove us down there.&nbsp; When we entered the array of buildings,
we saw the one
<br>that would be out place of investigation.&nbsp; Her mother had left,
knowing if we
<br>had gotten caught, she would be fined, I being 17 years of age, had
decided
<br>this was something I could not miss.&nbsp; We propped ourselves on
a mini roof,
<br>gently took of the screen of the window, and opened the window. I was
the
<br>first to climb in.&nbsp; The view was incredible, hundreds of doors,
wide open.&nbsp; A
<br>couple years before they had spent over ten thousand fixing the place
up, one
<br>day, they up and left.&nbsp; Now pieces of the ceiling were fallin
onto the floor.
<br>&nbsp;The paint is peeling off of the walls.&nbsp; We walked until
we found a closet
<br>full of files that had carelessly been thrown in there,&nbsp; we decided
to leave
<br>that alone and continued walking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We then found the
morgue, bottles of
<br>embalming fluid still lay on the table.&nbsp; As we went to investigate
more, we
<br>heard footsteps.&nbsp; I looked at my friend and the same look of complete
fright
<br>took over her face as did mine.&nbsp; We ran, and jumped out onto the
roof and ran
<br>to my car.&nbsp; We sat for a moment, pondering if whether or&nbsp;
not we wanted to go
<br>back in.&nbsp; We decided against it.&nbsp; As we pulled away we saw
a room with blood
<br>red satin curtins, untouched.&nbsp; I looked down because my shoelace
was caught
<br>on my gas peddle, and when i looked up, there were a set of handprints
on the
<br>window.&nbsp; I went back a couple times afterwards, and paranormal
activity took
<br>place every time.&nbsp; I want to know your feed back.

<br><font size=+2>Indirect Experiences..</font>.
<p>By: jessjett@owt.com
<br>&nbsp;
<p>None of my experiences have been direct, in my face experiences, at
least
<br>since I have been of an age to be able to distinguish fantasy from
reality
<br>(sometimes it is hard though).&nbsp; One event I was involved in, I
actually
<br>slept through!&nbsp; I will start with my experiences chronologically,
as best
<br>as my memory serves.&nbsp; But before I tell my stories, I want to
say that this
<br>website is a GREAT one and I have spent many hours over the last few
days
<br>checking out the site and reading others stories.&nbsp; Some stories
have a few
<br>events that hit home, while others are so dramatic that I often find
myself
<br>peeking over my shoulder while reading!!!&nbsp; This is my first time
doing
<br>this, so bare with me...I am also quite long winded...as you will see.
<p>I have always had a strange mixture of fascination and fear of "other
<br>world" events.&nbsp; I have heard many stories from family members
&amp; friends,
<br>some with small events, some much larger.&nbsp; To start off my first
event:
<br>This happened when I was young, somewhere between 6-8 years old.&nbsp;
I don't
<br>have a great memory when it comes to my childhood, but this and one
other
<br>event I will tell you about next, stands out and has throughout the
years.
<br>I remember being sick at home and laying on the living room couch.&nbsp;
I
<br>remember my mother was home, though I don't recall where she was in
the
<br>house when this happened.&nbsp; I think I had been throwing up and
was sick with
<br>a fever, drifting off and on from sleep.&nbsp; I had at that time one
of those
<br>life size dolls that a lot of young girls my age had at the time (some
of
<br>you might remember), and I don't recall whether the doll was in the
room or
<br>not, but that doll brings some confusion to my story.&nbsp; I remember
laying on
<br>the couch, awake and facing the TV.&nbsp; The next memory I have is
of something
<br>my size walking across the room towards me and then proceeded to touch
me
<br>(how I don't recall) and also tickling me.&nbsp; I don't recall the
features,
<br>though I am often tempted to think I was hallucinating my doll doing
this
<br>to me, mainly because the "thing" and my doll were the same size...and
I
<br>remember thinking it was in some sort of human form.&nbsp; But this
event sticks
<br>out very clear and still scares me to think about.&nbsp; I don't recall
where we
<br>were living at the time or if any other event went on.
<p>Throughout my life, as early as I can remember, not on any regular basis,
<br>but here and there every couple of years or so, I would hear my name
yelled
<br>in my ear.&nbsp; But it was something that only I would hear and it
happened not
<br>enough for me to really give it much thought beyond my initial fright,
<br>which would last a few hours.&nbsp; Sometimes it is yelled with panic
in the
<br>voice and repeated a few times.&nbsp; I cannot recognize the voice,
but it is
<br>almost muffled...but I know it is yelled.&nbsp; It has not happened
for years,
<br>but the last time it happened was probably the scariest and stands
out the
<br>most.&nbsp; I recall being in bed, just at the point of falling asleep,
and if
<br>my memory serves me right, I was living at home with my family and
sharing
<br>a room with my sister.&nbsp; Everyone was a sleep when this happened
too.&nbsp; I was
<br>at that point of falling asleep where you are aware of things, but
REALLY
<br>relaxed...almost there...almost asleep.&nbsp; I hear someone, maybe
twice, yell
<br>my name VERY loudly right in my ear, but it was that muffled tone.&nbsp;
My eyes
<br>were wide open and I was no longer on the road to sleeping!&nbsp; Nothing
<br>happened that night beyond that, and no one was awake.&nbsp; Needless
to say, I
<br>had a hard time falling asleep that night.&nbsp; That was the last
time I
<br>remember the yelling voice in my ear.&nbsp; (My fiance thinks, after
hearing
<br>this story I need to see a shrink...but I know it wasn't my crazy
<br>imagination...something was saying my name...who, what or why I dont
know).
<p>My sister swears she used to see things in the house we grew up in and
my
<br>next story takes place in that house.&nbsp; She was often scared of
something,
<br>usually something she saw out our bedroom windows.&nbsp; At that time
I was very
<br>into UFO and alien stories (still am too) and so is (and was) my
<br>stepfather...so I wonder sometimes if she had just heard to many stories
<br>and scared herself?&nbsp; Anyway, this is the only event I recall at
that house,
<br>and I unfortunately don't know any history of the house or land.&nbsp;
My
<br>parents still live there though and I never hear anything from them
about
<br>events, which makes me wonder if I was dreaming...though I know I was
not.
<br>I was on the bottom bunk and my sister on top, I think I was maybe
10 or
<br>11...she's 2 years younger.&nbsp; We slept with the bedroom door open,
as did
<br>our parents, which right out of our door across the tiny hall was their
<br>room.&nbsp; Both rooms had night lights at night on, so we usually
felt very
<br>safe.&nbsp; I remember everyone was asleep and had been for a while.&nbsp;
I don't
<br>know if I woke up or was still trying to get to sleep, but I was laying
on
<br>my back and I heard (as clear as day), HEAVY fast and very RUSHED running
<br>footsteps...getting closer and closer.&nbsp; The footsteps were VERY
loud and I
<br>was scared stiff, though the scariest part was the fact that WHOEVER
was
<br>running was so rushed...I mean sprinting and fast.&nbsp; I just lay
there, my
<br>eyes wide open waiting for something to appear in my doorway.&nbsp;
I wasn't
<br>even thinking about anyone waking up, though no one ever did.&nbsp;
Nothing ever
<br>reached my door (at least that I saw) and the running got louder and
closer
<br>after a few minutes.&nbsp; I don't recall what or when it stopped or
when I fell
<br>asleep...I just remember laying there, listening and frightened stiff.&nbsp;
The
<br>thing is, our house is TINY and it literally took a second to walk
from the
<br>front rooms to the hallway were the bedrooms were in.&nbsp; "Whatever"
would
<br>have reached my room in three or four steps at the rate it ran, but
it went
<br>on for a few minutes (that I can remember).&nbsp; Weird huh!?
<p>I have one last story to tell, which happened about 4 years ago (I was
<br>19yrs old).&nbsp; And THANK GOD, I slept through this one!&nbsp; I
went to a
<br>government funded school in a little town in Oregon exactly 9 months.&nbsp;
At
<br>that school, the kids (majority of them) lived in dorms there, and
they all
<br>seemed to have a story of their own...seeing ghosts...people who had
died
<br>there years before...supposed Indian burial grounds...stuff like that.
<br>Though this is the only thing that I ever saw (well, not literally,
I was
<br>sleeping!)...I was involved in.&nbsp; In our dorm room there were 4
girls and 2
<br>bunk beds directly across from one another.&nbsp; We all got along
good and
<br>would stay up talking late at night and such.&nbsp; I particularly
close to the
<br>girl who was in the bunk above me.&nbsp; She was a very special friend
to me;
<br>but had some strange habits of sitting straight up in the middle of
the
<br>night or hanging her head down to talk to me, while asleep!!!&nbsp;
At first it
<br>was scary, but I got used to it (as used to it as you can get) and
I'd tell
<br>her to go back to sleep and occasionally had to get up to do it, lay
her
<br>back down and stuff.&nbsp; So I was used to that, more than the other
girls.
<br>Things got strange when she began saying things (instead of just rambling
<br>away) "no no no..." and "no don't touch me" and things like that.&nbsp;
I don't
<br>recall waking up during those "no" episodes, though my fellow bottom
bunk
<br>roomie across the room heard them.&nbsp; Then she started sitting up
in bed and
<br>taking down her pictures (we never figured that one out).&nbsp; She'd
wake up
<br>and her pictures would be laying across her bed.&nbsp; Now my upper
bunk mate
<br>never remembered any of this, even when she was just doing her normal
<br>babbling.&nbsp; Here comes the scary part (at least for me)...and damn
it...I'm
<br>alone while I type this...go figure!&nbsp; Everyone was asleep except
for the
<br>girl (who I believe a totally honest person) on the bottom bunk across
the
<br>room from us.&nbsp; She had been laying there trying to get to sleep...I
don't
<br>think it was too late in the evening...but we'd all passed out.&nbsp;
Apparently
<br>my friend on the top bunk above me started with her "no no...don't
touch
<br>me" night talk and the other girl on the bottom bunk was watching her.&nbsp;
My
<br>top bunk mate sat straight up in bed and continued with her "no" talking.
<br>That is when *N* as I will call her, laying in bed watching *A* as
I'll
<br>call her, saw IT.&nbsp; At the bottom of the bunk stairs, at the foot
of MY bed
<br>she saw what she described as a midget body with a weird head (I cant
<br>remember if she said an animal head or a "monster" like head).&nbsp;
It scurried
<br>up the stairs (I'm getting the willies...big time now, typing this
alone)
<br>and had gone under *A's* covers near her feet.&nbsp; *A* is still saying
the "no
<br>no" talk and sitting straight up in bed.&nbsp; *N* then saw the thing
under
<br>*A's* covers making it's way from her feet to her waist, as a moving
bump
<br>under the covers.&nbsp; It never came up from the covers while doing
this and
<br>from *N* description, it moved fairly quickly...didn't linger in any
spot
<br>or anything.&nbsp; It then rolled back down to her feet and scurried
back down
<br>the stairs (passing me again...scary) and disappeared.&nbsp; *A* did
her "no no"
<br>talk for just a little while longer then layed down and went to sleep.
<br>While this was all happening *N* had pulled the covers over her head,
but
<br>was peeking out watching the whole thing...FREAKED OUT!&nbsp; After
it
<br>disappeared...she said she didn't sleep all night.&nbsp; The next day
*N* told
<br>us what had happened, and of course we were all FREAKED OUT beyond
belief.
<br>*A* didn't have any marks on her body or anything, and of course, didn't
<br>recall a thing.&nbsp; Everyone bravely stayed the night there the following
<br>night, except me...I refused to.&nbsp; We had all tried to prepare
ourselves if
<br>anything happened again like that, though I don't recall now what it
was or
<br>how we were planning on preparing ourselves.&nbsp; The adults who keep
watch on
<br>the dorms, after hearing our story, kept telling us it was a raccoon
or
<br>animal.&nbsp; Except the only window open was the bathroom window and
whatever
<br>it was didn't come or leave from the bathroom, and the only door, the
front
<br>door was never opened or closed and LOCKED at night.&nbsp; There is
more to the
<br>story, but just what people said about us...that we were crazy and
stuff
<br>like that...and the adults there wanted to split us up.&nbsp; But my
entire time
<br>there, *A* and I were in the same room as others came and went, and
she was
<br>always on the top bunk and me on the bottom.&nbsp; And during my 9
months there,
<br>that is the only thing that happened (indirectly) to me or *A* in that
room
<br>(that I know of)!
<p>Well, I have rambled on a bit here, feel free to edit the stories!&nbsp;
It
<br>feels good to tell about it, and I hope that others enjoy the story
and are
<br>not to frightened because of it (like me). If anyone has had similar
<br>experiences, especially with the midget thing, please contact me.&nbsp;
I am
<br>curious to see if this little thing has visited others, what it did,
what
<br>it wanted, if it was evil or not, etc.&nbsp; Thank you.

<br><font size=+2>THE SPANDAU GHOST</font>
<p>By: stuart.o'sullivan1@virgin.net
<p>My brother told me this story a couple of years ago about an incident
that
<br>took place in 1985 in West Berlin, as it was then, when he served there
in
<br>the British Army.
<p>Picture the scene; Spandau Prison a cold eerie place with only prisoner
<br>(Rudolph Hess) but with many brutal stories in its' Nazi past. My brother,
<br>Peter, was officer commanding the guard on that particular extremely
cold
<br>winters night. He had a platoon of men scattered around the building
where
<br>he himself admitted you didn't feel comfortable on your own unless
you were
<br>armed.
<br>The guard was rotated monthly......British, American, French and so
on.
<p>There were a series of guard towers which were semi enclosed and he
had one
<br>man in each of these. Suddenly several shots were fired in one of these
<br>towers. Peter and the platoon sergeant went to investigate and found
one of
<br>the men, a big guy not normally afraid of anything with his rifle in
hand
<br>and tears running down his face. This could be a serious incident.
If you
<br>fire your weapon with live rounds negligently, you are in serious
<br>trouble....
<p>The soldier didn't speak for a while but eventually started to talk.
He'd
<br>been keeping watch when he felt a presence behind him. He turned to
see a
<br>soldier staring at him. He challenged the man twice and then fired
3 shots
<br>at him, as laid down in standing orders. The soldier disappeared into
thin
<br>air.
<p>Our man wasn't believed until a few days later it emerged that a French
<br>soldier had committed suicide in that same guard post a month or two
<br>earlier. The incident was scrubbed from the records and our man returned
to
<br>duty but never again at Spandau Prison.

<br><font size=+2>Roosevelt Island &amp; Something Else</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>By: JayZ99312@aol.com
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I'm 15, when I was in 3rd grade I think, I went with one or two friends
to
<br>Roosevelt Island (Its nearby since I live in NYC), and everyone knows
that
<br>there is a house there nobody is allowed into. It even has alarms on
the
<br>doors. There's&nbsp; a black cat who wonders around the house (who
can't possibily
<br>be a ghost, it doesn't even look like one, its too, well, Live), and
if you
<br>go onto the porch there's a smell of corpses coming from under the
porch.
<p>So we took some pictures of us by the house and of the house alone,
and when
<br>looking back on the pictures sometime later, in the pic of the back
part of
<br>the house I think, there was a weird looking figure staring through
the
<br>door's window.
<p>The figure, I thought this was pretty messed up, looked like.... a robot
? I
<br>don't know for sure, but it was grey and had a square head, and that's
all I
<br>saw was the figure's head and face features. I still have the picture
and its
<br>still there in the pic. It's barely visibile but you can quite make
out that
<br>something is looking through that window.
<p>Here's something else.... I don't know if this was just my imagination
or
<br>actually real... During 5th grade (in NYC at a school called P.S. 59),
I knew
<br>an african american kid (won't say his name, just call him "K") whose
mother
<br>worked at the school by helping out with boxes, etc. Anyway my class
and I
<br>were going back to our room and we passed by the the yard's enterance
(this
<br>was on the 2nd floor) to the right of the hall, and I saw K's mom organizing
<br>some boxes and as she got up from putting a box down I was looking
at her and
<br>she looked up at me and she had a mean face and had fangs in her mouth.
I was
<br>freaked out. She wasn't a ghost or anything, but I don't know what
the hell
<br>happened there.
<p>She may have yelled at me a few times for causing some trouble but other
<br>times she was nice.

<p><font size=+2>Ghost Story from Sacramento, CA</font>
<p>By: LisaCole@flaniganlaw.com
<br>&nbsp;
<p>After happening upon your website and reading your intro, I wanted to
share
<br>my own personal experience because I, too believe in ghosts.
<p>One school night during my senior year in high school, I was bored and
had
<br>decided to go to bed early.&nbsp; I went into my room, changed, got
straight into
<br>bed, and turned the light out.&nbsp; Not 30 seconds went by and I heard
and felt
<br>something moving at the foot of my bed against my comforter.&nbsp;
I turned my
<br>head around to see what or who it was and there against the light of
my
<br>window was the sillohette of what looked like a cowboy.&nbsp; It was
a completely
<br>black figure, and I could make out the outline of a poncho and a
<br>flat-brimmed cowboy hat with a strap under the figure's chin.&nbsp;
I could not
<br>see through the figure.&nbsp; And, he just stood there with his hands
at his
<br>side, facing me.&nbsp; I gasped and turned away, frightened to death,
and when I
<br>looked again, just a few seconds later, the figure was gone.&nbsp;
It never
<br>appeared in my room again.&nbsp; Until that night, I never believed
in ghosts.

<p><font size=+2>Ghost Voice</font>
<p>By:fsmith@helicon.net
<p>This is my ghost story.
<br>I almost feel the need to apologize because it is not as ghostly as
others' submissions.
<br>Here it is.
<p>My family moved into an old Victorian-type house in a small town in
southwestern Pennsylvania years ago.
<br>Although it is quite beautiful, it obviously has not been kept up as
it should.
<br>My bedroom was the largest, because my parents wanted the one bedroom
that had a bath attached.
<br>Despite living in what is to some a dream home, I always felt "small"
in that house.
<br>I don't know how to describe the feeling, but I wasn't very comfortable
there.
<br>Anyway, one day, as I was in my room reading or working, I heard a
male voice say "what."
<br>When this happened, I was alone in the upstairs part of the house.
<br>My bedroom door was open and at the sound, I whipped my head around.
<br>It had came from down the hall.
<br>My bedroom is located to the right at the top of the stairs.
<br>There is a bathroom directly across from the stairs, a bedroom next
to that and a hallway across from my door that leads to closets, a third
bedroom, and a small room.
<br>There is also a second stairway down that hall.
<p>Now, I didn't see anything, but I am convinced that the voice did not
come from anyone who lived in the house.
<br>My father was the only male in the household and the voice was not
his.
<p>It's been years since this happening, but I still think on it and wonder
about the history of that house.
<br>I believe that the builders and former owners of the house were wealthy
and connected to the coal industry that thrives in that part of the state.
<br>In fact, a coal mine is in clear view from the back porch.
<p>Well, that's it.
<br>If someone knows about ghostly voices and sounds, please contact me.
<br>As years pass, sometimes I wonder if it was just a dream.

<p>First off I am a 17 teen year old and am a nursing assistant. I work
at a
<br>nursing home in Minnesota. Here is my story. This happened about 3
weeks ago
<br>so here it goes.
<p>A man died he was in his later 70's and they found him sitting up in
bed when
<br>he was dead. So that night I went to work (I work eves) and people
had told
<br>me that weird things happened I am was like what? The nurse and TMA
told me
<br>that the call light in this guys room would go on and off when no one
was in
<br>the room! i was like oh yeah right! i stayed til about 10 to do rounds
and
<br>nothing had happened 2 days later: I had to work and they told me more
things
<br>had happened so i stayed again until 9:45 but then they asked me to
stay
<br>later so i said OK. i was next door to the guys room and me at two
other aids
<br>came out and saw that the call light was on. we all were like oh no!
so we
<br>all went in there and we saw the bed rise up and the head of the bed
go up
<br>all by it self! i was so scared you should have seen me run! now there
is a
<br>lady in his room and she requested to be moved because the lights kept
going
<br>on and off. now the room is empty but there is a big temperature difference.
<br>It is cold in his room and warm everywhere else.

<p>I don't know if these are what you call scarey stories
<br>but my grandmother told us kids these&nbsp; tales
<br>My grandmother was from Poland, Warsaw. or around there.
<br>she lived there around 1890's
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Her and her friend wre making carpets in a old barn type
building in the evening.
<br>It started to get dark and they lighted some kerosene lamps so they
could keep on and
<br>finish. This was on all Hallows eve and they knew that they wasn't
suppose to be working.
<br>All of a sudden the lamps went out.&nbsp; They relite them and continued
to work, the lamps went out
<br>again.&nbsp; They lite them and worked more ,, again they llite them,,
but this time they heard noises
<br>coming from the loft, and then a what she called a horses hoofs started
to come down from the loft.
<br>After they seen this they shut the lamps off anf went to their homes
.
<p>another story she related was about death signs.
<br>In the town where she lived. There was a family .&nbsp; The young daughter
took sick.&nbsp; the Doctor ws sent for
<br>and treated the little girl, and left.&nbsp; In those day there ws
no inside plumbing and the father went outside to

<p><font size=+2>Steam Boat Gulch</font>
<p>By:&nbsp; Creep@Cyberhighway.Net
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Idaho City, Idaho. 3 friends and I went camping there, it wasn't the
first time, and we would usually always hear weird
<br>things. On one occasion, we were camping in a spot we haven't camped
in along time. During the time, their were sounds of
<br>screams, a woman to be exact sounding like she was being slaughtered.
Weird sounds coming from the woods, and also animals
<br>&nbsp;that sounded like Wolves, but moving fast and getting very close.
2 of my friends decided to go for a walk with a
<br>flashlight, when they got about 50 yards away we heard a very loud
"Crash" sound, the girls dropped their flashlight and
<br>ran screaming. My friend and I got into his car and sped towards them
and turned on the high beams. Nothing was there, but
<br>the girls described it as sounding like a tree had fallen right next
to them. We searched the area for parties or other
<br>people. None were found except an older couple already asleep. After
this we decided to leave, but our fire refused to go
<br>out after urinating, water and dirt being put onto it. After finally
getting the fire out we sped away, but something pulled
<br>&nbsp;the gear shifter out of gear, the headlights dimmed and the car
stalled, we started it again, and it stalled again. This
<br>car was not "junk" or in bad shape, a very good running car. It never
before, or after the incident stalled. It continuely
<br>stalled, and my one friend said she had a very scared/eerie feeling.
Finally we sped out of the place at about 45mph which
<br>was very dangerous. The roads are ment for 15-20mph traffic. Once we
were home, about 1 mile away, we still saw and heard
<br>weird things and we all felt a presence outside of the house. Also
my younger brother (age 12) saw something in the window.
<br>Whether or not he was just seeing things I don't know, but he wasn't
at the campsite, and didn't hear much about it. After
<br>praying that night, everything calmed down and we went to bed. About
2 weeks later we went camping again, in a different
<br>spot but close to the same spot. Nothing happened for most of the night,
after we went to sleep in my tent, me and my
<br>girlfriend awoke to see weird colored lights and a white light coming
closer, and the sounds of sirens, but there was no
<br>police, or authority vehicles around. No vehicles for that matter.
We were totally alone in the woods.

<p><font size=+2>Still Baffled</font>
<p>By: Brak@PlatteValley.Net
<p>Three years&nbsp; ago my husband and I bought a home built in 1914.
We did not experience anything unusual the first couple of
<br>years but this last year we adopted a child. I read a story about a
ghost that seems to protect children in a family and we
<br>&nbsp;are wondering if there is a connection to our recent adoption.
(we adopted in October 99). We have an old Library room that
<br>we use as a TV room. Several occasions the TV would change channels
or the volume would turn down. We thought the neighbors
<br>had the same TV channel frequency and accounted the incidences to that.
One day , the whole family was in the TV room. The
<br>children were playing with toys and a remote control car kept driving
around the room. Finally, it was annoying enough that
<br>I was going to put the noisy toy away. When I looked to see which child
was driving the car, none of the children were
<br>playing with the remote. I pointed this out to my husband and we just
sat there stunned. We joked about a ghost but also
<br>rationalized that the batteries in the car must be low.( the strangest
part is the car never ran into anything. It backed
<br>up and moved forward as if truly being driven) Days after this, the
light in the TV room would turn off by itself and then
<br>&nbsp;a few minutes later turn back on. At Christmas my family came
to stay a few days. My mother and grandmother and I were
<br>sitting in the TV room. Another remote control car suddenly started
to drive by itself. This was a brand new car our son
<br>&nbsp;got for Christmas. I started to tell our stories, joking about
ghosts. Just then, the light came on then off several
<br>minutes then on. This went on the whole time we talked. The next night,
still Christmas vacation, two of my children were
<br>sick. My two year old woke up and I carried him down stairs to take
his temp etc.. I didn't want to wake anyone upstairs.
<br>It was about 2 a.m. and we passed by the TV room, the lights were off.
I set our 2 year old son Joe, down in an adjacent
<br>room (the front living room). he immediately pointed into the dark
TV room and excitedly said "snowman". He is only two and
<br>still hard to understand. I said "Grandma?". "Snowman" he repeated
pointing into the empty darkroom. "Grandma went to bed"
<br>I told him. He shook his head "no" again he said "Snowman!" I said
"I don't understand what you are saying". He walked over
<br>&nbsp;to the Christmas tree and pointed to a snowman ornament and then
pointed back into the room and said "snowman". he seemed
<br>to be clearly telling me about a "Snowman" in the TV room. Our newly
adopted baby was also running a fever so that night I
<br>slept on the couch with Nathan. Again, to watch him and not wake anyone
else in the house. I woke up an hour later to here a
<br>&nbsp;toy playing music. I couldn't get the toy to stop so I put it
in the kitchen cupboard. by the morning the toy had stopped
<br>playing and has never malfunctioned since. Since Christmas we have
continued to have countless incidences. Often the
<br>children will be playng in the room and I will hear a click of the
entertainment center door opening. i will peek in to
<br>scold one of the kids for getting into the vidoes and I will see the
door slowly opeing but the kids will be across the
<br>room sitting on the floor playing. If we get distracted from the TV
and start playing with the kids or reading a book, the
<br>&nbsp;TV shuts off by itself. The room is always cold and we accounted
this to the fact that we tore out old carpet exposing the
<br>&nbsp;wood floors. The room also sometimes smells like baked cookies.
We even had a visitor who walked into the room and asked if
<br>&nbsp;I baked. At first we tried to rationalize all the incidences
but we are not sure what to think anymore. It seems to have
<br>started only this last year even though we have been in the house for
three years. Still baffled.

<p><font size=+2>Spirits visiting you in dreams?</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>By: Leticia.Sanchez@avnet.com
<br>&nbsp;
<p>My Tata (grandfather)&nbsp; died in "95".&nbsp; He was very close to
my cousin (Anna) and I, we were his favorites. It had been
<br>about 1 year after my Tata died.&nbsp; One night I had a dream that
my mom had bought my friends house (it was a old house,
<br>&nbsp;with a downstairs basement).&nbsp; In my dream my mom had told
me the basement has spirits in it.&nbsp; So I walked down the
<br>basement and I saw a boy&nbsp; I then turned around and there was my
Tata.&nbsp; He held out his hands and said "Do you want to
<br>dance?" and I said "Yes." we danced for awhile and then he stopped
and said "I have to go now"&nbsp; I then told him "ok" and he
<br>disappeared.&nbsp; In the morning I felt weird I had not dreamt of
my Tata since he had died.
<br>So one day my mother (my Tata was my mom's dad) and I were doing some
<br>shopping and I told her of my dream.&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked at me and
said "Really,
<br>your cousin Anna had a dream that she was there in the house and my
dad
<br>appeared and asked Anna to dance and Anna said "yes" and
<br>they danced all around the house.&nbsp; I confirmed the story with
my cousin.
<br>I have only had one other dream of my Tata.&nbsp; He was sitting in
his favorite
<br>chair and we were laughing.

<p>By: Ghostcapt@aol.com
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I never believed in ghosts until we moved into this old house. It was
built
<br>around 1910. My parents had bought it from a private party that hadn't
live
<br>in it.
<br>When we first moved in, nothing seemed out of place. Only after about
six
<br>months or so, I started hearing a crash in my bedroom closet, it happened
<br>every night, although when I looked nothing was out of place or disturbed.
As
<br>time went on, more and more things began to happen, heavy foot steps
were
<br>occasionally heard in the house, usually walking through the living
room up
<br>to my bedroom door, they would always stop outside the door. When I
looked,
<br>no one was ever there. They sounded like boots on a hard wood floor,
although
<br>the rooms have wall to wall carpeting.
<br>Sometime later, there would be other noises, and a presence could be
felt in
<br>my room. I would hear the crash first, then other noises, I would ask
whoever
<br>it was to be quiet, it would stop immediately.
<br>One night I felt the presence of someone or something in the room.
Soon after
<br>I went to bed, I could hear the exhale of breathe. It was a very deep,
rough,
<br>sound and soon got so loud, it seemed the whole room was breathing.
That was
<br>the first time it had scared me.
<br>I had a friend spend the night one time, he was sleeping on the pull
out bed
<br>in the living room. I had not told him anything about the noises in
the
<br>house.
<br>In the morning, when I woke up, he was sleeping beside my bed, on the
floor.
<br>When I asked him why he was there, he told me, he was asleep, when
someone
<br>grabbed and shook his foot, he looked but there was no one was there.
He laid
<br>back down, and soon after, he felt a cold hand touched his face, he
turned on
<br>the light beside him, and again, found no one there. That was enough
for him,
<br>he moved into my room. He told me it felt like a very cold hand and
fingers,
<br>brushing his face.
<br>Sometime after this, I had married, and while looking for an apartment
my
<br>wife and I were living there. One night my wife woke up in the middle
of the
<br>night. A fan that was in the room was running, that we hadn't turned
on, she
<br>got up and turned it off. After going back to bed, it soon came on
again. She
<br>got up again and unplugged the fan this time, just after laying down
again,
<br>it started running, with the cord still unplugged. She woke me up and
I saw
<br>it too. There was a very strong feeling of dread in the room that night,
we
<br>both felt it, and knew if we stayed, something bad was going to happen,
so we
<br>left for the rest of the night. My wife and I soon moved out.
<br>.
<br>My father, wasn't one to talk about such things, not believing in them
at
<br>all! But then one evening he mentioned something to my mother about
walking
<br>into something while going to the bathroom in the middle of the night.
He
<br>said, he had walked into a very cold spot in the hall, it chilled him
to the
<br>bone, then it had whooshed up through the ceiling and the cold spot
was gone.
<br>While visiting them, on one occasion, we were sitting in the living
room,
<br>with the TV on. In the background we started hearing some other noises,
that
<br>grew louder and louder, on investigating, we found a radio in the kitchen
<br>playing, after it had been turned off, when we had arrived. Somehow
it had
<br>turned on and had slowly turned itself up until we could hear it, when
we
<br>entered the room it was fairly loud.
<br>After a time, things had calmed down, about the only thing going on
were
<br>little things missing, the returning to where they had been set down.
<br>Just last year, my oldest daughter, then 18 years old, spent a night
on the
<br>floor in the living room. She said, in the middle of the night she
was woken
<br>up by heavy foot steps walking by her, but she could see nothing there.
She
<br>spent the rest of the night hiding deep in her sleeping bag.
<br>As far as I could tell, none of this was directed at anyone one person
in the
<br>house, we all experienced noises, foot steps, objects missing and other
<br>things.
<br>Since I moved out, I have been in the house several times in the day
and at
<br>night, and have not had any more experiences, although I wouldn't spend
the
<br>night again.

<p><font size=+2>Our Spirit</font>
<p>By: lhalbert@fair.net
<p>My husband and I purchased our home in 1992.&nbsp; Its the oldest house
in our
<br>neighborhood.&nbsp; The activity started on the first night we moved
in.
<br>We were busily moving in and decided my husband would go and get a
last load
<br>and I would take a shower to get ready for bed.&nbsp; I was alone in
the house.
<br>I made up our bed turned out the light in the bedroom and shut the
door as I
<br>headed down the hall for a shower.&nbsp; When I returned from the bathroom
the
<br>door was open and the light on.&nbsp; I thought I had was mistaken,
but when I
<br>crawled into bed after turning out the light and shuting the door...the
door
<br>open all by itself and the light came on.&nbsp; So thinking that maybe
it being
<br>an old house, unlevel to open door and a short to make the light come
on.&nbsp; I
<br>hopped out of bed and repeated my same action and once again the door
open
<br>then the lights came back on.&nbsp; I went outside and waited for my
husband to
<br>return.
<br>When he arrived I relayed my experience to him but nothing else happen
that
<br>night.
<p>My next experience had witnesses.&nbsp; The first 6 months we lived
in our house
<br>we lived upstairs, downstairs was under construction with painters
and
<br>plasters.&nbsp; We had a nice sitting area in our rather large bedroom.&nbsp;
I was
<br>sitting with 2 friends and telling them of my experience.&nbsp; One
of my friends
<br>started making fun of the spirit all of a sudden a huge wind blew through
my
<br>closed up house to slam every hall door which consist of 4 heavy wooden
<br>doors along with very chilly air.&nbsp; He simply stutter and left
as fast as
<br>possible.
<p>This spirit I have named Dean.&nbsp; The only one who has every seen
Dean is my
<br>grand nephew.&nbsp; My husband collects Russian metal wind-up toys.
Tripp, our
<br>grand nephew, was two years old at the time, he and I were playing
with one
<br>of the toys in one of the upstairs bedrooms which leads out onto a
sun porch
<br>area.&nbsp; We let loose of the toy and it rolled out onto the sun
porch.&nbsp; Tripp
<br>went to retrieve it and looked up and said "Hi," I asked Tripp who
was he
<br>talking to, he replied," That man right there. He pointed directly
in front
<br>of him.&nbsp; I saw nothing.
<p>Dean has handed me towels in the shower, kissed my back, sat on the
bed with
<br>me laying on it, said good morning to my uncle while he was asleep
in the
<br>guest room. He turns pots off on the stove and shakes our bed at night
to
<br>wake us up.
<p>We have been with Dean for 8 years now and after I yelled at him to
stop
<br>scaring us he has settle down, but everytime we have a party he will
talk to
<br>someone or show up in pictures we take.
<p>I have tried to find out who he is, I found a few clues, but nothing
<br>conclusive.
<p>In the meantime we keep trying to find out who he is and Dean is behaving
<br>much better nowadays.

<p><font size=+2>Our Haunting</font>
<p>By: Kroll_MT@prodigy.net
<p>I have never talked publicly about this before now.&nbsp; What follows
are just some recollections of strange things that used to
<br>happen in our previous home.&nbsp; The home, itself, was just a normal
2 bedroom home.&nbsp; Not very old.&nbsp; Only about 50 years old.
<br>&nbsp;It had been my Grandparents' house before my wife and I purchased
it on a land contract from my Dad after my Grandparents
<br>passed away.(not in the home)&nbsp; Right away, strange things began
to occur.&nbsp; I am a guitar player and had my musical equipment
<br>&nbsp;down in the basement.&nbsp; I usually stay up quite late playing
guitar, because that is when I am most creative.&nbsp; Anyway, one
<br>night I was up playing, and decided to head out for some Taco Bell.&nbsp;
When I got back, I was just inside the back door when
<br>I heard a very loud whisper in my ear;'BE QUIET!'&nbsp; It scared the
hell out of me, but I managed to reply; 'What?'&nbsp; I thought
<br>&nbsp;is was my wife.&nbsp; But when I looked around the corner into
the kitchen, I realized she wasn't there.&nbsp; I cannot begin to
<br>describe the feeling that came over me.&nbsp; I didn't know what to
do.&nbsp; What could I do?&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; When I told my Dad about
it
<br>he was not at all surprised.&nbsp; My Grandparents had moved into the
house when my Dad was about 10, and he told me he always
<br>heard strange noises but never voices.&nbsp; He also said that years
later,after he had grown up, my Grandpa told him that they
<br>had bought the house from a younger couple in 1957.&nbsp; He said that
the woman was mentally ill and told them not to buy the
<br>house.&nbsp; That is was haunted.&nbsp; She claimed that one time she
went down the basement and found all of the light chains swinging
<br>&nbsp;in unison.&nbsp; My Grandpa was of the gruff old type and, I'm
sure, did not believe her.&nbsp; Anyway, it was wise of him not to tell
<br>&nbsp;my Dad of this until he was older. Some of the other weird things
that happened were very subtle and seemed to revolve
<br>around my wife.&nbsp; She did not work and was home with our 2 daughters
all day.&nbsp; She would tell me that a picture fell&nbsp; off
<br>the wall, or that there would&nbsp; be would be what sounded like walking
in the attic.&nbsp; I thought that was so cliche' and
<br>suggested that she was probably getting caught up in it and imagining
things.&nbsp; That is, until August of '96.&nbsp; One evening,
<br>I was sitting on the couch in the living room, and she was standing
in the doorway to the kitchen.&nbsp; I was talking to her and
<br>&nbsp;I glanced back at the TV, when I saw something fall out the corner
of my eye.&nbsp; She said; 'Did you see that?'&nbsp; She said it
<br>was like a little splash of water or something.&nbsp; I looked all
over the ceiling and doorway area and found nothing.&nbsp; I was
<br>trying to rationalize it as condensation, but everything was bone dry.&nbsp;
This happened to her about 3 more times over the
<br>next year or so.&nbsp; The last time it happened,&nbsp; I was sitting
right next to her on the floor with our backs against the couch.
<br>&nbsp; I have absolutely no explaination for these things and I am
not really a believer in the all of this stuff, but I really
<br>don't know what to think.
<br>&nbsp; We have since moved and have not had so much as a squeak in
our new house.&nbsp; Anyway, thanks for providing the forum for me
<br>&nbsp;to try and get an explaination if there is any.

<p>By: tocool38@hotmail.com
<p>For awhile now i have been huanted by a ghost. I have moved three times
in the same town and the ghost follows. What happens
<br>&nbsp;is i hear noises like bangs or creaks. I have gotten scratches
on my back bite marks on my legs that are clearly human. I
<br>&nbsp;have heard keys jingling when noone is home. My dog will all
of a sudden start barking at thin air. It is constantly cold
<br>in my room and there is a heater in ther and my room faces the sun.
I'm convinced there are two or more diferent ghosts here.
<br>&nbsp;My grandpa died recently and I got his pin that he used to where
all the time and i once came into my room to find it
<br>sitting out when i always keep it in a box. I lose things and ask for
them back and 1 minute later they will be sitting in
<br>the middle of my room. I have seen the face of the devil or a demon
in my ceiling. My mom has woken up to the sound of a bag
<br>&nbsp;crinkling up downstairs. She has also woken up to sounds like
banging in our garge since it is directly under the bedrooms.
<br>&nbsp;I have seen a little girl standing by the window. My closet door
has violently shaken twice. Whenever you are here you
<br>constantly feel if you are being watched. As i am writing this now
i feel cold chils allover me. I have been trying to get
<br>to sleep when it feels as if someone has just climbed into bed with
me then it feels like they are squeezing my arm. The
<br>volume on my stereo has gone up or down before by itself. My name is
Matt Skiles i am 14 my parents don't beleive me either.
<br>I swear on everything that is holy this is true.

<p><font size=+2>My Weird Block</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>By: punkboarder182@hotmail.com
<p>&nbsp;This may sound stupid coming from somebody as young as me. Well,
it seems lately I've been getting some
<br>spiritul activity around my street. Every time I'm out there at night,
I get this weird feeling and chills
<br>go up and down my spine. It's been like that the whole seven years
I've lived here. I always blew it off as my
<br>imagination until recently. I had my best friend over. I took him out
to a corner in the backyard I used to play
<br>and be alone when I was around 6 or 7. Every time I would go out there
at night I always got that creepy feeling.
<br>Lately I've been referring it as "the energy". Well, when we went back
there, My friend felt the same thing.
<br>He said something like "it feels weird back here."&nbsp; I asked him
what he meant and he said something like "i feel
<br>&nbsp;like something is around here." I got freaked and suggested we
go across the street to play with the kid that
<br>lived there. My friend told me he kept seeing this guy in a trenchcoat
with a little terrieor in the space
<br>between my house and my neighbor's house. That place has freaked us
out since we were little. I looked over there and
<br>got a strange feeling.&nbsp; We ran across the street to my other friends
house and looked back at the space between
<br>the houses. We could both see the back fence that seperated that space
from the alley. We rang the doorbell and
<br>after 30 seconds of no reply, we turned to go back to my place. We
noticed that the space between the houses
<br>was pitch black! We naturally ran back to my place as fast as possible.
I turned to where my friend had seen the image
<br>in his mind and I saw the same guy, no dog, and his trenchcoat swaying
in the breeze in my mind. I freaked and
<br>looked down at the pavement of our carport (holy cow a plant just fell
off the table as I'm typing) and saw a
<br>face darting his eyes at me.&nbsp; We ran to my room and went over
the events together. He suggested I close my eyes
<br>&nbsp;and tell him what I see.&nbsp; I saw the trenchcoat dude close-up
on his shoulders and head.&nbsp; I could not make out
<br>his facial features. I asked my friend to close his eyes and tell me
what he saw. He said he saw the dog running
<br>&nbsp;away, then a train, and darkness. We both decided just to play
video games and take our minds off it.&nbsp; Next time
<br>he comes over, we are going to go back out there and see if the same
thing happens.

up and
<br>she said just go to sleep she lived in the house for several # of years

<br><font size=+2>Visited Because of Story</font>
<p>By: cmf6760@netzero.ne
<p>I worry to tell my story as every time I do I am visited. Not only by
full
<br>body goosebumps, but my little girl ghost as well. I would like to
think I
<br>am starting to know her. My youngest as well has seen her. She enjoys
music
<br>&amp; reading books to my youngest step daughter. She started out by
turning our
<br>stereo on in the living room. Then she drop a shelf with my wedding
glasses,
<br>a glass plate, a music box &amp; other preciouse items. She did not
come a round
<br>for a while after that. I have seen her, my youngest has seen her,
my
<br>husband &amp; oldest daughter say they feel her. I think she is the
wife of the
<br>man that owned our property. The house was not buit until after she
died. I
<br>started to look into it, her death certificate was in our paperwork
for the
<br>house &amp; her husbands was not. When I went to the cemetary to see
some dates,
<br>I found that her plot was not where it is supposed to be &amp; her
husband died
<br>before her. That night I started to see a black shadow around the house.
<br>Once agian I am covered with goosebumps!!! After a few days of telling
my
<br>husband of my find, I said I was going to drop it, I felt that the
black
<br>shadow was trying to keep me from finding the truth. I am not sure
what to
<br>do from this point. I have heard her singing when I go to sleep, I
see her
<br>when I open my eyes at night, standing next to me in bed. My children
have
<br>come to our room &amp; stood next to our bed looking down on us, to
realize the
<br>next day, they have no recolextion of any of it. I am scared that she
is
<br>being held some how, yet that she looks over all of us. My husband
feels &amp;
<br>felt long before this started that I am a witch &amp; never realized
it. I dream
<br>of a black room with a red pentagrm on the floor with red velvet ropes
<br>around it. I went to salem when I was 2. My mother said I was in such
a room
<br>at that time. I was in a car accident when I was 15 &amp; lost 99%
of my
<br>memories before that time. I am not sure what to do now, or if this
is
<br>really happening or just emagnination.

<br><font size=+2>What Did I See?</font>
<p>By: nsegrest@worldnet.att.net
<p>I read your description of the first spirit(ghost) that you saw.&nbsp;
I was
<br>searching for a description that sounded like what I have seen.&nbsp;
Twice in my
<br>life I have seen this type of image and they frightened me because
I was not
<br>expecting to see anything like them.
<p>#1&nbsp; One night my younger brother and I were talking and I was really
<br>reaching out to get to know him as I am 4 years older.&nbsp; We had
not been
<br>close and I had come home from the Navy to go back to college.&nbsp;
While we
<br>were talking I began to notice a round head right behind his.&nbsp;
This head was
<br>abnormally large with no hair.&nbsp; Then, I noticed the body and it
was as if my
<br>brother was a puppet and this creature was the real being.&nbsp; I
quickly caught
<br>myself and never tried to look that deep again.
<p>#2&nbsp; My family and I were moving out of a large property that had
an unusual
<br>history to it.&nbsp; There was an abnormally high level of snakes on
the property
<br>and I was constantly killing them. We moved horses on the property
and they
<br>seemed to slack off.&nbsp; Many tragic events had occured at the property
from
<br>the description given to me by others.&nbsp; I passed them off as past
events
<br>with no bearing on the present.
<p>Just before we moved, we moved the horses to a pasture and the whole
nature
<br>of the property changed.&nbsp; It was as if a cold dank wind had set
in. It was
<br>summer but felt odd.&nbsp; I had worked very hard in the move and was
tired.&nbsp; I
<br>went back to do a final cleanup and when I approached the gated entry
I
<br>noticed what looked at first like a young boy about 2-21/2 feet tall.&nbsp;
It
<br>had a large, distended head. It had an odd grin on it's face.&nbsp;
I still had
<br>not realized what it was.&nbsp; It was moving in a weaving, almost
floating
<br>motion.&nbsp; Then, I realized that I was looking straight through
it. It moved
<br>to my left and was gone so quickly that I realized that nothing human
could
<br>move that fast.&nbsp; I entered my property and looked for it, but
it was gone.
<br>I went to work on the house and later was almost bitten by a snake.&nbsp;
I was
<br>happy that we had moved.
<p>I had had a dream about a golden snake that came up to me on this property
<br>and told me that our business would fail.&nbsp; It did. This spirit
had the same
<br>distended head that you described.&nbsp; Two young women came to the
gate where I
<br>saw the spirit a couple of months earlier.&nbsp; One was crying and
wanted to
<br>come in to look around.&nbsp; They had lived there before.&nbsp; From
what I could
<br>gather, a dentist had been dealing in cocaine at the house and one
of the
<br>girls child had died and was buried there.&nbsp; They had been big
game breeders
<br>for a hunting group.&nbsp; It gives you the flavor of the property.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I am glad
<br>it did not happen again and I am not seeking a revist.

<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>This story was experienced within a two hour period by four un-trained
<br>pre-teen girls visiting the Ft. Davis Historic Site. From the
<br>easternmost authorized mountain, you could see the entire Fort,
<br>including the hospital. I immediately creeped out at the small, red
<br>brick building known as the hospital, which was about .5 miles westward
<br>of that point. Two boys, a chaperone and another of the "experiencees"
<br>was in a group with me. Of course, our next stop was the hospital.
Once
<br>we got to it, I immediately thought up any reason I could not to go
in.
<br>Eventually, since we were supposed to do a word problem involving the
<br>buildings, and since I was the best _at_ word problems, I was forced
to
<br>go in (the other girl in my group was accustomed to seeing ghosts.
It's
<br>a natural talent of hers), and I felt the presence of many more people
<br>than were in my group there, and I felt a tingling in the back of my
<br>knees like I always do when I sense the supernatural, and upon telling
<br>the other girl, she told me of her experience. She had actually _seen_
<br>them (the ghosts). When I told the rest, the other two girls told of
<br>the&nbsp; walls that changed color in the main hallway. For one it
was
<br>brown-turned-red, and for another, brown-turned-purple.

<br>&nbsp;
<p>In Williamsburg, VA me and two friends were walking through the woods
to go get some coffee at 7-11.&nbsp; We saw four wood piles as we were
walking to 7-11 and as we were walking back, we saw only three.&nbsp; We
decided since we heard the woods were haunted&nbsp; we'd tempt fate and
sit on the three piles and see what happened.&nbsp; As we were sitting
there having a smoke, we heard some branches falling in the distance.&nbsp;
The branches started falling closer and closer until they seemed to be
all around us.&nbsp; We&nbsp; got scared and started running and one of
my friends said he got stuck in a briar bush.&nbsp; So we went back and
saw that the briar had been completely wrapped around his leg.&nbsp; He
broke it and we started running again.&nbsp; As we were running the second&nbsp;
time, we noticed three more wood piles.&nbsp; Then, we were almost out
of the woods when one of my other friend's foot got stuck&nbsp; in a log
just big enough for his foot.&nbsp; When we freed him, we looked back and
the log was gone. As we were walking out of the woods, all three of us
started getting really bad cold chills.&nbsp; We all started going home
when a black cat appeared in front of us and we all&nbsp; screamed.&nbsp;
That's when we broke up into two groups, me and my friend in one group
and my other friend walking to the other&nbsp; side of the neighborhood.&nbsp;
We heard him scream and looked back and saw that about 100 yards away,
the black cat had run in front of him again.&nbsp; My friend and I laughed
and just as we were laughing, the same cat we just saw that was 100 yards
away ran in front of us.&nbsp; Nothing further happened after that.

<br><font size=+2>Haunted College Days</font>
<p>By: Evilphd7@aol.com
<p>Normal, IL. 9 Delanie Drive near the Redbird Arena of Illinois State
University; The Old Alpha Sigma Phi house (it's now
<br>some other fraturnity that I haven't heard of).&nbsp; I rushed ASP
in the Fall of 1990 and was immediately told the familiar
<br>ghost story that every university seems to have about it having been
a female dormitory where a girl was murdered (I guess
<br>males don't haunt dormitories).
<br>&nbsp; I didn't pay much heed to the rumor until I and my fellow pledges
were cleaning up the basement after a party.&nbsp; The
<br>fraturnity stored chairs on the back stairway which was no longer being
used.&nbsp; While carrying chairs up the stairs, I saw
<br>a shadow-reflection on one of the landing walls of a woman (motionless;
just standing there really).&nbsp; Thinking her the
<br>girlfriend of one of my fraturnity brothers, I said "oh, hey Linda"
and kept working.&nbsp; After I was done, I went back upstairs
<br>(via the front stairs) to say hello to Linda and, of course, found
that neither she nor any other female was in the house.
<br>&nbsp; While in my brother's room I asked where the door to the back
stairs was.&nbsp; A puzzled look crossed his face and he pointed
<br>to a large bookcase covering the door and told me that no one used
the back stairs anymore. The only way to use them was to
<br>go through the basement door. I related my tale to him and several
of them told me about other strange occurances they had
<br>observed in the house.&nbsp; Although I cannot confirm these other
stories, I definitely DID see the shadow of a woman on the
<br>stair-landing wall.&nbsp; If there had been a woman there, she was
above me and up the stairs to my right around the "bend" of
<br>the landing with a light behind her, casting a reflection onto the
white wall.&nbsp; In any case, it was a rather odd experience.

<p>By:&nbsp; VeraLissar@aol.com
<p>I dont know if this exactally counts but in littleton there have always
been strange happenings.&nbsp; In my house things
<br>dissapear all the time and we can never find them, lights never works
and we have problems with our heat.&nbsp; Certain rooms
<br>&nbsp;are always cold and at the top of the staircase there are scents
of food cooking when there is no food cooking in the
<br>&nbsp;kitchen downstairs, theres never the scent anywhere else in the
house.&nbsp; There is a spot above the fireplace where the
<br>paint has chipped off in the shape of a strange animal we jokingly
call the rat squirell, but you get an uneasy feeling
<br>if you look at it long enough.&nbsp; I have a friend who refuses to
sleep in the same room with it.&nbsp; Many of my friends report
<br>&nbsp;simaler feelings of cold or being uneasy in various parts of
their houses.&nbsp; In a nieghbor hood known as The Valley many
<br>people have reported gohst sightings and strange happenings such as
objects going missing or being rearanged in the night,
<br>strange noises, and things being
<br>&nbsp;destroyed.&nbsp; A friend of mine has many stories about strange
happenings in his basement, such as a time a large neon sign
<br>hanging on his wall began shaking violently for no apparent reason.&nbsp;
Another friend of mine who lives in the vally showed
<br>me to a spot in her house where she belived was some sort of negative
energy or gateway to another world.&nbsp; When i sat in it
<br>i became overwhelmed with feelings of depression and anger, and that
night i had bizzar dreams, some of which ended up being
<br>&nbsp;clairvoiant.&nbsp; It is kind of an urban legand around here
that the valley is nothing more than a huge idian barrial ground,
<br>some people also say that it was a spot the donner party traveled trough
before they got stuck.&nbsp; Many people i know who
<br>moved here from relitively far away (my self included) say they have
devleoped clairvoiant dreams and feelings of
<br>precognition.&nbsp; And clemit park had been the site of many strange
occurances even before the tragedy at Columbine.&nbsp; I was
<br>told by a friends old
<br>er brother when i first moved here that the library in clemit park
was haunted, and if you stayed ther late at night you
<br>could see mists by the booksheves and the computers wont work right.&nbsp;
I later heard simaler stories from a girlwhos mother
<br>worked at the library, and she told me of seeing flashing lights over
the lake outside the library.&nbsp; Many of my friends have
<br>&nbsp;said they have been visited by spirits of some type or strange
occurances since columbine, either in dreams or when wide
<br>awake, and i myself woke up one night to see a friend of mine who died
recently sitting on my couch.&nbsp; I blinked my eyes a
<br>couple times and he was gone, but there was a strange feeling about
the room, strangly, not a negative one.&nbsp; I only know for
<br>&nbsp;sure what i have experianced for my self, but many of the stories
i've heard have simalarities to each other and my own
<br>experiances, although a loth of them come from around the highschool
and other adaults i know who are considered eccentric
<br>hippies.&nbsp; Therefor this my not be the most reliable of stories,
but i thought i'd offer the information because most everyone around
<br>here agrees that there are certain places you go around here and it
feels like youve walked right into a steven king novel.
<br>&nbsp; I would suggest checking out The Valley, Clemit Park, Chatfield

<br><font size=+2>Upstairs/Outside</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>BY: Lotto333@aol.com
<br>&nbsp;
<p>This is an incident that occurred at the home of my parents.&nbsp; It
was not the
<br>first to occur nor was it the last, but it was this incident that made
me
<br>aware that something lived at my parents home, upstairs/outside.
<br>My father is a finish carpenter by trade, but he actually knows all
aspects
<br>of the building industry.&nbsp; When he returned from a three year
tour of Korea
<br>(I was an infant), he began to build a home for his family from the
<br>footprints of another.
<br>Over the years he has moved walls, added rooms and a whole new upstairs.&nbsp;
His
<br>latest and greatest addition to our family home was 900 "+" square
feet of
<br>living space that is only accessible from outside the main house and
runs the
<br>entire length of the back of the house and rests atop the garage.&nbsp;
All family
<br>members refer to this great expanse as the upstairs/outside.
<br>Above the garage is a lovely room of the softest yellow that features
a brick
<br>fireplace that covers the majority of the West wall.&nbsp; The South
wall is
<br>filled with windows that are easily opened for fresh air and let in
plenty of
<br>sunlight.&nbsp; The North wall holds a set of French doors that open
out onto a
<br>second story deck that also runs the entire length of the back of the
house.
<br>It's cool.
<br>As a family, I can only remember using this room once for a large gathering
<br>during the holidays and never using it again for it lacks a working
bathroom
<br>and kitchen and makes for a lot of running up and down stairs when
<br>entertaining.&nbsp; Over the years it has fallen into disrepair and
has become a
<br>storage facility for my parents and each of their five children, including
<br>myself.
<br>I was in my mid-thirties when I bought a home of my own and went to
my
<br>parents house with the idea of securing treasures that could be found
<br>upstairs/outside and giving them a place in my new home.&nbsp; And
so I went with
<br>my oldest son Kam (who was seven or eight at the time) in the middle
of a
<br>beautiful, sunny, windy day.
<br>My dad's truck was in the driveway and I cursed my luck for my father
loves
<br>us all dearly and he especially loves to give us a hard time.&nbsp;
He believes
<br>that anything left in the upstairs/outside belongs to him, whether
it does or
<br>not.&nbsp; He will give it up but only if you argue with him for it.&nbsp;
"Bless his
<br>heart."&nbsp; That's what my grandmother, his mother use to say about
his tendency
<br>to behave this way.&nbsp; Go figure.
<br>There are three entrances into my parents home, Kam and I went into
the house
<br>via the front door and into the foyer.&nbsp; From here I could see
my youngest
<br>brother, Mark, half asleep on the diningroom floor.&nbsp;&nbsp; He
had swung the TV
<br>around from the kitchen and was dozing in the middle of the day while
the
<br>soaps were on.
<br>I didn't bother him but left my son to do that and went into the kitchen
and
<br>sat at the table and waited for my dad to appear.&nbsp; No one comes
into the
<br>house that he doesn't hear them and so I waited at the table reading
the
<br>paper.
<br>Now, my dad is a big man and he can't move through the house and you
not hear
<br>him and as I sat reading the paper, I did hear him moving about the
upstairs
<br>off the kitchen, for the upstairs/outside also supports an unfinished
master
<br>bedroom with bath.
<br>I thought I was very lucky for not only had he not heard my arrival
but there
<br>was a chance that I could get by him with the treasures and he would
never
<br>know it and I would not have to argue for what was mine.
<br>You arrive upstairs/outside by going out the backdoor which is located
in the
<br>kitchen and into what once was the back porch.&nbsp; It is now a small
room that
<br>holds a large freezer and nothing more.&nbsp; You can go down three
steps and
<br>through a hall into the garage or walk past the freezer and take a
steep
<br>stair climb to a landing, make a right, up three more stairs.&nbsp;
To your right
<br>is a hallway leading to the master bedroom and bath, but to your left
is a
<br>set of double doors that open into the room above the garage.&nbsp;
It is the
<br>upstairs/outside.
<br>The double doors were open and as I stood looking into this sunny room
filled
<br>with collectibles and furniture (there is even a full sized billiard
table
<br>with slate bed), I was witness to the strangest thing.&nbsp; A wind
was blowing in
<br>this room that was like no wind I had ever seen inside a house.
<br>It is true that every one of the windows was open wide and that outside
the
<br>day was windy but inside this room was a wind that moved things.&nbsp;
Not
<br>furniture but paper, spools of thread rolled acrossed the floor, small
things
<br>you really wouldn't notice except for the fact that they were caught
up in
<br>this wind that was circling the room and making an awful racquet because
it
<br>was trapped inside.
<br>Weird!&nbsp; That's exactly what I thought as I started acrossed the
room for my
<br>possessions were on the far east wall and the plan I was formulating
in my
<br>mind was that I would way over there and work my way back acrossed
the room
<br>and out the doors before dad caught on to me.
<br>I was halfway acrossed the room when the double doors slammed shut
behind me
<br>with such force, it made me jump.&nbsp; I stood there a moment, surprised.&nbsp;
The
<br>room was quieter and nothing was moving about me any longer.&nbsp;
I was compelled
<br>to go back to those doors and open them.&nbsp; I wanted them open.
<br>I took hold of a door knob, turned it to open the door and it wouldn't
open.
<br>I tugged on it and it still wouldn't open.&nbsp; I remember laughing
right outloud
<br>and I remember thinking that I now know what it's like to be in a "B"
rated
<br>horror movie and on the other side of the door that will not open when
you
<br>want out.
<br>I braced myself and pulled on that door knob as hard as I could and
was able
<br>to open it, barely, and not enough to see who was on the other side
holding
<br>it shut.&nbsp; Whoever it was very strong.&nbsp; Dad!
<br>I called to my dad to quit teasing me and let me out!&nbsp; No response
and the
<br>door would not open.&nbsp; I loudly cursed my brother, Mark, for holding
the door
<br>shut on me and still whoever stood on the opposite side of that doors
would
<br>not let me out.
<br>I couldn't think of what I could do to open it and still laughing because
it
<br>seemed so unreal, I began to call for help.&nbsp; What else was there
to
<br>do.....dad could only be a room away and if it was him holding the
door shut,
<br>my helplessness would appeal to him and he would let me out and we
would have
<br>a good laugh about it.
<br>But no one answered and no one came and someone was holding that door
shut
<br>and keeping me inside and it wasn't funny anymore.&nbsp; I took hold
of a single
<br>knob with both hands and determination and in that moment the door
swung open
<br>as easy as you please and there at the top step reaching for the door
knob
<br>was Kam.&nbsp; I was bewildered.
<br>I asked him twenty questions.&nbsp; Was he holding the door?&nbsp;
Did he see my dad or
<br>my brother holding the door shut?&nbsp; Did he hear me calling for
help?&nbsp; Had he
<br>seen anyone at the door?&nbsp; To all of my questions his answer was,
"No."&nbsp; There
<br>had been no one at the door and he hadn't heard anything.&nbsp; He
had come
<br>looking for me.
<br>I had Kam go back downstairs with me and we went to find Mark.&nbsp;
He was still
<br>on the floor in front of the TV although now awake.&nbsp; I found out
that my
<br>dad's truck wouldn't start that morning and he had taken my mother
to work
<br>and used her car.&nbsp; He wasn't home and hadn't been home all day.
<br>I didn't go into any great detail with Mark or Kam about what had happened
<br>upstairs/outside, since I was still kinda stunned by it all.&nbsp;
But I did talk
<br>to my mother since I was curious to know if she had had anything strange
<br>happen to her in the house.&nbsp; She has a story to tell, but it is
hers for the
<br>telling.
<br>I kept away from the upstairs/outside for a good long time and was
teased
<br>about it as the tale was told to others.&nbsp; Sometime afterwards
I spent the
<br>greater part of my weekends at my folks home as we began a landscape
project
<br>that circled the house.
<br>I often felt we were being watched at our work and my eyes would always
go to
<br>the windows of the upstairs/outside...the feeling was so strong.
<br>Years later, I moved back to my folks home for a brief period of time
and
<br>whatever was upstairs/outside came downstairs/inside....those tales
are for
<br>another night when I cannot sleep and I'm looking for people who have
had
<br>similar experiences....just to share.

<br>&nbsp;
<p>By: Kisst3DMJ@aol.com
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I live in Washington state. Have lived here
<br>since forever. In 1992, when I was about 9 years old, my grandfather
on my
<br>fathers side died from lung cancer. I didnt know him very well, me
being so
<br>young, but my grandmother, father, aunts and uncles say I was his favorite.
I
<br>never really believed in ghosts until my experience happened. Now I
am a
<br>strong believer. I t started out as he would appear to me in dreams,
every
<br>night. And each night the dream would become more vivid. I didnt tell
anyone
<br>about my dream because my family would probably think I was crazy.
But I
<br>figured it out that he was only coming to protect me. Heres how I know:
<br>One night I was coming home from the store and my little sister and
my mom
<br>were in the living room. As I was passing my moms room, it was becoming
very
<br>cold, I had noticed. As I looked into my moms room as I passed it,
there
<br>stood my grandfather, clear as day, I screamed. A pile of something,
that had
<br>the wall to support it, no reason, no way to fall, I saw my grandpa
move into
<br>my moms bathroom, and as his leg by the the pile of something, the
pile fell.
<br>Meaning he kicked over the pile. Ther was nothing to cause it to fall,
it was
<br>propped up against a wall, it was stable. I ran very quickly into my
room and
<br>began to cry hysterically. My mom soon came in and asked what the problem
<br>was. I asked her if shed heard me scream, "NO" she didnt. I tried to
<br>reconsile what just happened, and I finally came up with the conclusion
that
<br>I had seen a ghost. WOW! I told the story to my nana and she is a strong
<br>believer in spirits too, she told me it was going to be ok. Another
thing
<br>that would happen, is theres was always this song called GRANDPA by
the
<br>judds. And every single time I am thinking of him, that song comes
on, every
<br>single time! Slowly but defintile the ghost faded away. But now I think
about
<br>it I am even more scared because that day I had a bad asthma atack,
and I was
<br>wondering if I might have nearly died, or did die? Someone got any
comments?
<br>PLease do comment.

<p><font size=+2>Sharing My Experiences</font>
<p>By: llanapod@webtv.net
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; i would like to share&nbsp; with you some of the strange
experiences that
<br>my husband and i had several years ago and&nbsp; see&nbsp; what your&nbsp;
opinion is
<br>about them (if you have time)&nbsp; by the way i found your site to
be very
<br>interesting!
<br>&nbsp; in 1993 after having been married for only a short while, my
<br>husband,mark and&nbsp; i moved into an apartment in carrolton, georgia.&nbsp;
it
<br>was a duplex style apartment and was fairly new.&nbsp; our apartment
was
<br>nicer than the others in the complex because the previous renter had
<br>been a
<br>carpenter and had&nbsp; added some extras
<br>to the place--molding, nicer cabinets etc.
<br>why he would improve a rented space tho that extent i do not understand.
<br>upon moving in to the place we found out from the landlord that the
man
<br>had lived there alone until he had committed suicide on the patio
<br>outside.&nbsp; there was a sort of faded stain on the pavement that
the
<br>landlord pointed out to us claiming that it was a blood stain from&nbsp;
the
<br>suicide (gunshot).
<br>during the year that we lived there many strange things happened....
<br>&nbsp; once, we all went to the grocery store and returned home to
find a
<br>sturdy piece of furniture ( a bookcase with drawers in the bottom)
<br>flipped over and books all over the room.&nbsp; there was nothing that
we
<br>could find to explain this.
<br>&nbsp; another time i was taking a bath and the water&nbsp; came out
all muddy
<br>looking like it sometimes does after a hard rain.&nbsp; it hadn't been
<br>raining but it didn't look too bad so i got in the tub and the water
<br>started&nbsp; moving back and forth. it would move from one end of
the
<br>bathtub to the other.
<br>i got out and called for my husband.&nbsp; it continued to do this
for at
<br>least 30 minutes.
<br>its kind of silly but we talked to the water telling it to speed&nbsp;
up
<br>it's movement&nbsp; and then slowdown and it did it every time.&nbsp;&nbsp;
then we
<br>told it to stop and it did.&nbsp; then we drained the tub and ran fresh
water
<br>which was not discolored at all .&nbsp; this time nothing happened.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; at 3;00 am on halloween morning we heard&nbsp; horrible
sounds outside our
<br>window. we opened the window so we could see what it was but we saw
<br>nothing/ it was very windy and we heard a sound i have never heard
<br>before.&nbsp; it sounded like lots of pigs screaming.&nbsp; it was
very distinct
<br>and plain and we heard it for a good while.&nbsp; it was not the wind
and it
<br>was not cats.&nbsp; it was very weird.
<br>&nbsp; quite a bit of stuff happened while we lived the---a hole appeared
in
<br>the wall the size of a fist.&nbsp; doors would slam.&nbsp; i would
wake up at
<br>night to feel a hand grasping my shoulder.&nbsp; a presence seemed
to be
<br>watching us from the kitchen .
<br>&nbsp; i was not brought up to believe this stuff could happen.&nbsp;
i would
<br>discredit it if it were not so concrete.&nbsp; but it was. i patched
the hole
<br>in the wall, put the books back on the toppled bookshelf, watched the
<br>water move in the tub for an extended period of time .&nbsp; i can't
see how
<br>this could e a flash of imagination.&nbsp; i was real and it lasted
long
<br>enough for me to&nbsp; know that it was real.
<br>&nbsp;theres other stuff that happened but&nbsp; it would take too
long to tell
<br>you about it right now.
<br>i appreciate your taking the time to read this.&nbsp; these experiences&nbsp;
seem
<br>to contradict the faith --- God and&nbsp; devil and heaven and hell
that i
<br>was taught as i child.&nbsp; i thought that when a person died that
they left
<br>this earth.&nbsp; do you think that these experiences were related
to the
<br>suicide?&nbsp; if so or if not they seem rather pointless to me.&nbsp;
it would be
<br>cool to get your view on this .

<br><font size=+2>Cemetery Story</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>By: JDROSET1018@AOL.COM
<p>SEYMOUR,CT-HOOKMANS CEMETARY-THE STORY HAS IT THAT THE GROUNDS KEEPER
OF THIS VERY OLD CEMETARY HAD KILLED HIS ENTIRE FAMILY BACK IN THE 1800'S
WHEN THEY LIVED IN AN OLD HOUSE IN THE BACK OF THE ACRES OF PROPERTY THAT
THIS CEMETARY IS ON, THERE ARE
<br>OTHER MYTHS LIKE IF YOU GO IN THE REMAINS OF THE HOUSE YOU WILL NEVER
RETURN. I'M TO SURE ABOU ALL THAT BUT I HAVE SEEN STRANGE SUPER NATURAL
THINGS THERE i.e. WHEN WALKING WITH ONLY 2 PEOPLE UP THE HILL WE COULD
DESTINCTLY SEE THE SHADOW OF
<br>&nbsp;4 PEOPLE AND IT WAS NOT A DOUBLE SHADOW OF ONE OF US, IT WAS
DEFINATLY ANOTHER PERSON! ALSO THERE IS A STORY THAT A WOMAN ACCUSED OF
BEING A WITCH WAS HUNG ON THE TREE ON TOP OF THE HILL. SOMETIMES YOU CAN
SEE THE SHADOW OF HER JUST STANDING
<br>THERE. MANY OTHER THINGS HAVE HAPPENED THERE, EVERYONE IN THE AREA
SEEMS TO HAVE A STORY SOME ARE TRUE SOME ARE NOT BUT I&nbsp; HAVE BEEN
THERE AND I KNOW THERE IS AN ENTITY THAT IS NOT HUMAN PRESENT. I'M NO PROFESSIONAL
I'M JUST A GIRL WHO HAS
<br>VISITED SEVERAL TIMES. SOMETIMES THINGS HAPPEN SOMETIMES THEY DON'T
BUT SOMETHING IS THERE. I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THOUGH THAT I HAVE LIVED IN
SHELTON MY WHOLE LIFE AND I
<br>HAVE NEVER HEARD NOR EXPERIENCED ANYTHING AT INDIAN WELLS STATE PARK.
LIVING IN A TOWN THAT HAS NOT MUCH TO DO BUT DRINK AND GO EXPLORE SOMEONE
SOULD HAVE HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT THAT BUT NO ONE I ASKED HAS. I HAVE MANY
FRIENDS THAT LIVE IN
<br>INDIAN WELLS COTTAGES AND HAVE NEVER HEARD SO MUCH AS A WORD ABOUT
THIS. MAYBE SOMEONE HAD AN EXPERIENCE THERE I CANNOT SAY THEY WERE WRONG
BUT I HAVE I FEELING IT WAS MORE BECAUSE THEY HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK FROM
ONE OF THE PARTIES THROWN
<br>THERE THAN AN ACTUAL SITING OF A GHOST. THE CLOSEST THING WE HAVE TO
A WHITE LADY IS THE ONE THAT EXSISTS IN MONROE AT THE UNION CEMETARY. THANKS
FOR YOUR TIME
