<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">From what I
remember it was
1998 I was pregnat with my daughter at the time and had trouble
sleeping some
nights, but there was one night that in the middle of the night I was
woken up
by a really loud bang in my sons room (my son being at the time only 2<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>years of age) as I got up I heard this closet
door slam closed, when to see what was wrong I had trouble getting his
door
open because his night table was upside down behind it ( the door ) so
I
squeezed through the opening, then moved the night table I went over to
my son
to see if he was ok, he was very shaken up I just thought<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that he had a bad dream Then it accured to me
that his night table was across the room and there was no way the could
have
done that, so instead of tucking him back into bed I brought him into
my bed
for the rest of the night The next day I my mom take my son for the
afternoon
so I could take a nap as I was lying down with eyes closed, I heard a
voice a
little boys voice say &#8221; do you like me&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I very slowly opened my eyes and saw a little boy about 8 or 9
maybe
even 10 years of age (what looked to be in the late 1900&#8217;s) standing
there I
quickly closed my eyes again when I opened them for the second time he
was
gone. After that for the next year in October my sons room at night
would have
a some what of a bright blue haze through his room, before all of that
happen
my son liked playing in his room a lot he was always talking out loud
but I
just figured that he was playing with and talking to his toys until
after all
of that happened if I wanted him to play downstairs he would cry kick
scream
any thing to be able to go back up stairs to play. Then about mid
November to
Later November I had moved out of there I found out later that it was
said that
there was a farm there way back in the day and that a boy died in the
barn due
to a fire, and before that the land was used for &#8220;milk-box-babies&#8221; I&#8217;m
not sure
if that&#8217;s correct or not. But that is my story as of today sometimes I
can
still feel his presents around me occasionally<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Being around the
paranormal
is no new experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After I left my
parents house, 75% of my residences have been haunted. My favorite
place was
the funeral home I lived in for 3 years. Where many of my friends had
similar
experiences as to my own. I find the paranormal fascinating and tend to
welcome
many different experiences. For the first time I am apprehensive about
some
experiences that have been taken place recently. Approximately 7 months
ago<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started to notice a door would
never stay closed in my bathroom, and my cats watching a particular
movement as
if someone is walking across the floor, however no one was in the room.
Shortly
after that experience I hear foot steps in my living room, I have a
very
squeaky floor you can even hear the cats walking around. This
particular
occasion both cats are laying on the sofa when my floor boards start to
squeak.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In my bedroom a dark mass will
fly across the room, then suddenly disappear. None of this seamed to be
bothersome till one of my cats was laying in bed with me and she woke
up crying
the terrible shriek of a meow for about 15 minutes. I took her out of
the bed
room and she ran underneath the sofa. Some mornings when I get out of
bed, when
I do sleep in the room which now is rare unless my boyfriend stays with
me, I
will have bruises on my legs and ankles that were not there when I went
to bed.
4 nights ago I went to bed around 11 P.M. and my boyfriend went in
close to 1
A.M. told me he saw a man next to the bed, he looked away then back
towards the
direction of the bed and the man moved in front of my boyfriend's face.
My
boyfriend looked away again and was gone. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Dark Shadow
Encounter<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>ourob0r0s@yahoo.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Just wanted to
share my Dark
Shadow encounter as information for others. If there is anything you
would like
to tell me about it, please don't hesitate.I have had dark shadow
encounters in
my dreams as far back as the age of 4. I never really knew what they
were,
until I had the one major encounter, and none since, Thank God. I was
dating a
guy about 10 yrs my senior when I was in my early 20's. After sometime,
we
became quite serious and I flew to Alabama to meet his parents. My
boyfriend at
the time was to meet me 2 days later. His mother is of Caucasian and
Cherokee
decent. I had no pre-conceived notions of meeting her, except for
excitement.
When she came to pick me up at the airport, my first impression of her
was not
a good one. I couldn't put my finger on it, she wasn't rude or mean,
but there
was a strange energy to her that made me feel that I couldn't trust
her. I
slept in the guest bedroom in the second floor of the house. It was
decorated
in white lace and red hearts, with a large window. I was tired from my
trip and
decided to retire early feeling as if everything was going well in
meeting my then
would be future in-laws. I fell asleep easily and comfortably and most
have
been asleep for a few hours when suddenly I opened my eyes, except for
I
realized that my body was still asleep, and then yet I wasn't sleeping.
I must
have been having an OBE, or a lucid dream. However, I was still in the
room,
lying on the bed, when I looked straight in front of me and saw a
large, oval
globb of blackness about 7 feet tall. It moved very quickly in front
and around
my bed, I could hear it grunting, snarling, like an animal, and it
seemed and
felt angry at me because it couldn't get to me. I next realized I had a
bright
light surrounding my body and the bed. The light was coming from above
and thru
the ceiling. The light was beautiful and misty and it enclosed me in a
bubble.
The dark shadow couldn't penetrate the light and it knew it. I watched
the
shadow, to my surprise, as a child watches something it doesn't
understand. I
had no fear. I was just observing. Suddenly, my eyes opened, and the
sun was
coming thru the bedroom window to my left, and the black shadow was
gone. It
was morning. I didn't know what to make of the experience.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That day we drove to upstate New York, to my
future sister-in-law's wedding. I soon learned on the trip that my
future
in-laws were heavy smokers, and I suffered from bouts of asthma
attacks. I
endured a few hours of hot Alabama weather in a car full of smoke with
the
windows cracked slightly open. I finally mastered the courage to ask my
mother
in-law to open her window completely since I couldn't open mine and
explained
my medical condition. Suddenly, she blew up into a fit of rage,
screaming at
the top of her lungs that she was not happy she had to do that to keep
me
comfortable. I will never forget that day, as I suddenly felt this
black glob
of energy enter into my body and sit inside my stomach. I was numb,
cold, and
confused. We stopped to eat thereafter and I went to the bathroom and
threw up.
I had diarrhea and felt depressed for the next few days. Of course,
when I came
back to Houston, I broke up with my then boyfriend, and never saw him
again.
That was my last encounter with Dark Shadows. I don't know what they
are, I
just now know that they are not good or come from the light, and
believe that
some of them may be demons.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Experience in a
Cemetery<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Shannon.New@interfaceflor.com <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">A group of
co-workers and I
decided to take a trip during lunch to N. Whatley Cemetery in LaGrange,
GA,
Troup County.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are all fascinated with
history and we heard the graves dated back to the early 1800's.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>While we were there one of the ladies and one
of the guys suddenly saw a hazy ball shaped figure float by and
disappear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We snapped a photo immediately
and looked at
the pics when we got back in the car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
had a great paranormal pic that really made the hair stand up on our
arms (I
will be glad to forward the pic to you if you'd like).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We got back out, latched the gate shut with
the lever and drove away.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
noticed
that the rd. was longer than we expected so we turned around and went
back the
way we came.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we passed back by the
cemetery the gate was wide open already.....after we had let the lever
down to
lock it and there is no way possible it could have opened on it's own.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>When we stopped to make sure we weren't
seeing things the blinker in my co-workers van started going off on
it's
own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All 6 of us were a little startled
and left very quickly after that.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Indian Spirits In
Log Home<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>bubberray@catt.com <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My wife and I live in Ringgold, Ga. and have
lived here for 25 years in a log home that we built ourselves with a
lot of
help from friends and family, this was about 1983. About 3 or 4 years
after we
moved into our log home some strange things began to happen.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would be watching T.V. when all of a
sudden the T.V. would go off and when we found the problem, it was
unplugged
from the back of the T.V. You have to turn the plug on the power cord
to unplug
the T.V. and it was laying on the floor behind the T.V.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After this happened we started to hear Indian
music and some very low volume chanting. At times it would get very
chilly in
the house even when it was warm outside, but only in one bedroom. We
have a big
wall clock hanging on the great room wall and it has 3 chimes hanging
down from
it for the doorbells.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When you push the
doorbell button the chimes play a short tune. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At
times for no reason at all the chimes
would start to move and ring like someone had pushed the doorbell
button but
there would be no one there. Our commodes would flush and there would
not be
any one there to flush them. We have found human bones and Indian
pottery,
arrow heads, and lead bullets about 50 cal.in size, and we do know that
a Civil
War battle was fought on our land and we checked with a University in
Alabama
and they told us that this was an area that had a Cherokee Indian
village back
in the 1700-1800 hundreds. We re-buried the bones and the pottery
shards and
the strange happenings have not been as frequent as they were.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We still live here and intend to stay
and
the strange happenings has not ever been a threat or harmed anyone in
any way.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I read with
interest your
listing<span style="">&nbsp; </span>about Ghost Road.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I and my family have lived along side this
road for 23 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can be a little
creepy at times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My youngest son related
an experience he had when he was a teenager.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My kids always played in the woods back in there and they know
the tombstone
you refer to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One evening as it had just
gotten dark he was walking home on the road when he heard a truck
coming from
behind and the headlights illuminated him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He stopped and moved off to the side to avoid possibly being hit.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Well the truck stopped too.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As he stood looking at it, the headlights
suddenly went off and there was no truck there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Needless to say, he ran home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

(our lady
of bellefonte hospital).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm writing
this toyou from work because i work evening shift w/ midnight call.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>In regards to the ghost of fannie, the story
goes that she tended to a garden here at the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>shortly after her death, the garden was
replaced by our cardiovascular lab which is adjacent to the surgery
dept.
(where I work).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've heard housekeepers
at night who've cleaned the operating rooms state the anesthesia
machines will
turn on and flash an EKG reading with an abnormally fast heart rate
which flatlines
then machine as a whole shuts off again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>also rooms are "flooded" at night yet morning shift crews
report fresh blood stains are on the floors.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>one last story, a co-worker decided to stay in the pre-op room
to sleep
instead of going home for only a couple hours.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>she said she was having trouble with her blanket, so she was
kicking her
feet in an attempt to straighten the blanket out when all of a sudden
the
blanket went straight up in the air, fully unfolded, and gently came
back down,
covering her up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>pretty bizarre stuff,
huh?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I have been living
in this
house for close to 3 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the
first 6 months, nothing happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
night, my hubby and i were laying on a spare mattress in the living
room watching
a movie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was around 11:50pm at
night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We started hearing these heavy
footsteps in the house. We have two doors leading into the living room.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the sliding doors was right beside us,
and the other one is approximately 5 metres away from us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We heard footsteps in the hallway outside the
door furthest from us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first we
thought it was my older brother who was also living with us. But he has
this
routine where he goes to bed at 10pm and its the same every night and
he doesnt
change his routine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Weird i know.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, we looked at each other thinking
"Is that Micko walking around in the hall at this time of
night?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We sat there listening to
the footsteps that next walked into the kitchen, which has a door that
leads into
the living room where we were closest to.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The footsteps came closer and closer until they stopped just
outside the
sliding door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We waited. We
listened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were expecting my brother
to open the door and have a whinge that our tv sound volume was on far
too
loud, even though it wasnt. But he is like that you know.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We waited, and then my hubby pushed the
sliding door and opened it and we found nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
other door on the far side of the kitchen
was also closed, which lead into the hall that the footsteps originated
from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were a bit spooked because we
both heard the steps and laying on the mattress on the floor could sure
as hell
feel the vibration in the floor from those footsteps.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We decided to search the house, minus my
brother's bedroom and we found nothing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>An old man lives next door and i was starting to imagine that
perhaps he
passed away and wandered over to our house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We saw him a few days later alive and well, so that threw that
notion
out the window. The next morning we asked Micko if he were up last
night and he
says "no."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We told him what we
heard and all he could do was shrug and insist that he was in bed and
didnt
even come out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I believed him simply
because there was no way he could have walked away without us noticing
when
hubby opened the door, and the footsteps never left. It just stopped
outside
that door, but nothing was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
thing that does happen here a lot is birds always hitting our front
window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This has happened so many times
that i have lost count.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Im not sure if
this is significant and whether its a common occurance with houses with
weird
things happening inside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another thing
that we notice on a few occasions is phantom smells.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sometimes they smell really pretty, but other
times it is foul.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They rarely last more
than 10 minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a while, things were
back to normal, but my brother said one day "I dont know who is always
walking past my window or what they want." I asked him who? He said
"some kid."<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He believes it
was a girl, probably no older than 8 or 9.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She walks past his window and heads toward the backyard and he
never
sees her walk back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This has happened
about 4 times that he can recall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told
him "WHY dont you go out there and check it out?" He always has some
excuse of how he was busy etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He plays
online games and says he was in the middle of something.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ok, lets continue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 9 months
after hearing the footsteps,
we heard them again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were in the
bedroom this time and it sounded like it was coming from the laundry
and
kitchen area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, we investigated,
checked all the locks on doors, but everything was secure and fine.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked my hubby if he believed this house
was haunted. He said it was a very real possibility.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Not too long ago i was taking a bath around
11pm and I heard a really loud thump just outside the bathroom window,
i got
out of the tub and wrapped a towel around me and met my hubby in the
hallway.
He thought i might have fallen and i told him that it seemed to have
come from
outside the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We switched on the
backyard light that had an outdoor seating area, but the place was
clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We didnt go outside, but we could
tell
nothing was on the floor that could have made that sound.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We went into my son's room to look out the
window where the garage and the rest of the yard is but couldnt see
much, save
for a few feet from the house because the outdoor lights arent strong
enough
and the trees are too dark and cast many dark shadows.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We just put it down to maybe the neighbour
was outside doing something though it was dark and if that were the
case,
wouldnt he have a light on?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
recently, I got a real shock of my life.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>About 3 months ago, they put the house on the market, and around
this
time, i went into my son's room about 7am to wake him to get him ready
for
school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was still quite dark, though
the sun was starting to come up and you could see enough.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I pulled his bedroom curtain open and saw
what looked like a girl child, in the yard, looking directly at the
window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She just stood there, watching
and then she turned her body and made her way toward the back of the
garage.
She kept looking my way for a few seconds before looking away and
disappearing
behind the garage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didnt know WHAT to
think to be honest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What would she be
doing
out there at that time of morning wearing inappropriate clothing for
that time
of morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Im not even sure if she was
solid or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was just thinking
"Who are you and WHY are you in my yard?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
think she wore a light blue dress. It could
have been white.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didnt have too much
light but it almost seemed like she had a bit of a glow.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I could even tell she seemed to have long
blonde hair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By now my brother and my
hubby had left for work and i was alone in the house with my son and
there was
NO WAY i was going to go into the yard to investigate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What if she wasnt a little girl?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Can
a little girl create such heavy
footsteps?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She is always spotted
outside, yet the footsteps are inside.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Or is that something else inside?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Is she trying to warn me?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have
seen shadows here and there, and many things have been breaking down
recently.
Since the house was put on the market, our little portable oven broke
down, our
microwave is breaking down, my washing machine isnt working well
anymore. It
wont do the final spin cycle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hot
water mysteriously stopped working as well, and the landlord came by to
fix it
and says he doesnt even see anything really wrong with it. The hot
water
started working again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The toilet was
blocked up with a root of a tree, but why now?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The kitchen faucet broke and fell off, our Video player stopped
working.
It chewed up a tape and had to throw it out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Birds continue to occasionally fly into our front window. ALWAYS
that
same window. Happened on the day of the house auction too.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And its not just these, but also
illnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My son was choking on food
the other day and needed an ambulance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since living here, my hubby has needed two surgeries, one being
spinal.
He's always been strong and then he spent a year out of work with a bad
back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He developed diabetes while living
here
though a test a year ago said he was fine.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I also developed problems, Polycystic Ovarian Sydrome, an
umbilical
hernia requiring surgery in near future, high blood pressure that
recently got
even higher, ankle swelling that cant really be explained, chest
infections
that occur frequently, and a few others.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Before living here, we were fit and healthy, and its like being
here is
making us sick.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Could be a
coincidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But you cant help think
these things. Ive read that there is a house somewhere in Europe i
think, and
people that move in there die of a heart attack within 2 weeks of
living there,
even those with no history of being ill. They say the house is cursed.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>So who knows if this is why we are getting
these issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are moving out in a
couple of weeks and we are counting the days.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I feel more like a 70 year old these days than a 36 year old.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>And all this change has happened in the past
3 years of living here.Anyway, this is my story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">The Assisted Living
home in
Pittsboro, NC where I used to work has "something" present. It was
first built in the 1920's as a children's home. In the late 1970's it
was
converted into a home for the aged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
were several nights when you could "feel" someone or something there
with you. On occassion myself and other workers have seen shadows and
other
things there. Because it is a Christian facility we never brought this
up to
the Director or Administrator. There is resident there currently who
claims to
have seen people in her room (they atribute it to dementia) and
regularly
speaks to children and has on occassion asked one of us to help them
find their
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The center building where there is
currently a 3 BR apt located on the top floor is part of the original
structure. The wing where I get feelings of not being alone is part of
the
1970's expansion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are all curious
about what things may have taken place there when it was a children's
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You know they say children and the
elderly
usually see things we don't because of the mind at those times are the
most
open.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>jjwoodz28@yahoo.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">This is an account
of a
Shadow Person. I was sat in the dark in a security lodge which is
mostly made
of windows. About three A.M. I turned and noticed a shadow of what I
thought
was a man looking into the lodge window from outside. When I looked at
the
Shadow, it turned slowly and walked to the side (which would have put
the
person making the shadow move into the open road. Surprised that there
should
be anyone there at this hour I looked out of the window and saw nobody.
I
looked around the Lodge but no one was around. It began to strike me as
strange. I did the usual thing of checking to see if it could have been
an
anomaly caused by automobile lights etc, but there were no automobiles
around
or any other light source as probable cause. There was something about
the
Shadow that struck me as odd. The shadow 'was' the presence, it did not
seem
cast by another presence. I could not think of anything that would
attract such
a being, so I just put it down to experience. However, a while later I
was on a
Web site where a woman with knowledge of Shadow people was explaining
that they
enjoy hanging around illness and death. A work colleague at the time
had his
wife seriously ill with some illness like alzheimer's or something, and
he
would bring her to work as she could not be left alone, (we work alone
so there
is no problem with bringing a wife like that). Around the time I saw
the Shadow
person his wife died at home. Had the Shadow person got into the habit
of
visiting the lodge to watch events there?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Ok,
I have been seeing and feeling spirits since I was 17 months old. My
mother was
rasied to believe in the paranormal and so was I..<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>My first inconture happened when I was
17 months old. My great grandfather had just passed away. I don&#8217;t
remember
seeing him or talking to him but, I do remember the smell of his
cologne. My
mom told me this when I got older. She said that she had just put me
down for bed
and a few minutes later she heard me talking. So she came to check on
me and I
told her it was papa and that was that I never saw him again until we
moved
into the house we are living in now.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>My second happened a few weeks after my great grandmother
passed. I was
12. When I was little she had given me a jewelry box. I was little and
I had
put baby powder in it. Well a few weeks after she had passed I was
vacuming my
room and nothing was near that jewelry box and it just fell off my
dresser. It
even fell off when I was in the living room watching tv with my dad.
The last
time it fell, I was at my nannies and my mom had the door shut so no
one was in
there. When it fell my mother got it up and cleaned it out and put it
in her
room and well that was the last time it did anything. My great
grandmother was
telling me to clean it.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ok,
now my
pawpaw fathead he was beloved to me because well I knew him for only 11
years.
I was 13 when he had passed. That night in the hotel room by the
hospital after
he had passed, we were getting ready for bed. My mom was crawling in
the bed
with me when my step grandmother said "Shell is that you standing
there?" my mother replied "No mawmaw I'm in the bed.". Well my
grandmother told us what she saw. There was an angle where my mother
had stood.
My mother could't see it but I could barely. I know it was him telling
us that
everything would be ok. My pawpaw fathead always messed with me so I
wasn't
surprised if he did it after death. One night I was in my nannies
living room at
like 11 o'clock waiting for CJ to get home. My nanny was in bed and I
was just
watching tv. Well there is a desk close to my nannies room. My pawpaw
use do
bills there when he was alive. I remembered before I sat down the chair
was
pushed in. A few minutes later I heard a creeking noise and I looked
over and
the chair was out of course I it scared and it made forget that it was
pushed
in. I told nanny and she said "It was probly your pawpaw fathead."
The last time I was at her house before she moved. I had just got out
of the
shower, I was drying my hair and I heard a name. I don&#8217;t remember if it
was
Randy or Rodney but I asked my nanny and she told me that it was probly
someone
he knew so I left it at that. I had used his old phone because mine was
dying.
Well we took it home before CJ and her boyfriend Joe could pawn it.
This was a
few months before my nanny moved out from up there. Cj and Joe was
stealing
stuff and pawning it. Well we had the phone and one night out of the
blue it
started ringing and it said dad. My mom answered and nobody was there
well the
funny thing is it was dead and shut off. Well next time it rang, I was
at home
and this time it said Joe and I answered, of course no one was there.
We took
the battery out and my nanny moved. And now no one knows what has
happened to
Joe or Cj.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Last
one I promise. My
dads father just passed recently and I was very very close to him. I
did
everything with him when I was litte. I'm even named after his daugter
who
passed away when she was 3. I was like his daughter and the one chance
he got
to know what it felt like to have a little girl again. He passed away
Dec. 8th
I was 16 and I miss him dearly. When I was little they had lived in a
trailor.
I knew his daugter was there because I could feel her even though I
never saw
her. When they moved to the house that is on the hill above the
trailor. I
could feel something that wasn&#8217;t good. I still feel it when I go over
there. I
don&#8217;t feel dianna (his little girl) or even my pawpaw. The week my
pawpaw passed
away my mom asked me to vacum his room. Well I started the vacum and
you know
that feeling you get when you know your not alone and it feels like
someone is
going to hurt you, well that&#8217;s how I felt and I started to panic. I
hurried and
I looked down for just a momment and then looked up and my mom scarred
the
living crap out of me. I left the room and let her finish. To this day
I never
go back there or even go to the bathroom there because I never want to
feel
that feeling again.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
know I am very
blessed to have had the chance with them all and to know that they are
watching
over me and protectingme because, sometimes when I'm alone or scarred I
can
smell their perfum/cologne or feel their presences and I know that I'm
not
alone or that I shouldn&#8217;t<span style="">&nbsp; </span>afraid anymore
because they're always going to be with me..<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 16pt;">When
I was little we lived in Belgium.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had
a very large room with a large window.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the corner of my window my mother hung a small stuffed angel.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>At night I would see it moving its arms and
head as if it were talking to the sky outside.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I would watch it do this for a while and then I would slowly and
quietly
get out of bed to go and see it and touch it but as soon as I would
come close
it would stop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was about the extent
of my encounters until I was in the 6th grade my family and I moved
into a
house on Elsee St in Orlando, Florida.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
remember the layout perfectly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My room
was located in the back of the house next to my bathroom and across
from my
brother&#8217;s room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My parent&#8217;s room was
located on the other side of the house next to the garage. <span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>I had three different experiences at this
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night I woke up out of a deep
sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought it was kind of weird
because I was wide awake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard people
talking and pots and pans banging around.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I didn&#8217;t really think anything of it because my mom was known
for
getting up early and cooking if we had people coming over that day.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I got out of bed and walked to the kitchen
expecting to see my mom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
completely dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went into my parent&#8217;s
room and they were asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went into
my brother&#8217;s room and slept on the ground.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There had been some time that had passed before the second
experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, I was sleeping and I
woke up in the middle of the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
bed faced the window and behind my bed was my closet.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The closet doors were made out of metal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was laying there when all of the sudden I
heard a tapping on my closet door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was a light tapping and then it would stop.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I yelled for my brother to get out of my closet and leave.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The tapping happened again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It sounded like someone was doing it with
their nail and it was making the door vibrate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was a little scared so I didn&#8217;t open the closet.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instead I went to see if my brother was in
bed and he was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I slept in his room
again for the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I decided to tell
my parents about what happened and I told my dad that I was too scared
to sleep
in that room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, my dad converted the
garage into a new room for me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, a
lot of time passed and one night my friend spent the night.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We were being silly and playing around with
my Ouija board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later we went to bed and
I locked my room door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a dresser
that I kept trinkets and glass figures on and it was under two vent
windows
that my dad built for that room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
windows were close to the ceiling and they had a ledge on both.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>That night I felt a little uneasy and scared
from playing with the board, my friend on the other hand was out like a
light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next morning I woke up and I
went over to my dresser to find that someone or something moved all of
my
little trinkets from my dresser to the top of the window ledges.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I am a very light sleeper and in order to do
this you would have to climb on top of my dresser to reach the ledge of
the
window and my door was dead bolted shut.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I am now about to be 30 and I have not had another experience
since
then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just thought I would share my
story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>pams1966@yahoo.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I have been reading
the
stories you posted by lots of people for many years now.I have posted 2
stories
under a different e-mail myself I would like to tell you about the
newest one
thats been happening for over 3 years now at work.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I am a restaurant manager in a small town in
georgia, milledgeville. Now i have to mention that the building this
restaurant
is in, was brand new when we opened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About
7 month after we opened the doors the first time to the public it all
started.
At that time i was promoted into management and took over 2nd shift. We
(
employee's and I) started seeing a shadow figure walking in the back of
the
house, always by the ice maschiene and dry storage room. One day I was
carrrying a glass rack bach to the dish room when the swinging door
that
seperates the diningroom from the back of the house opened and stayed
open
untill i walked through the door and put the rack down by it self. This
is a
swinging door that we just push open with our foot to walk through. It
swinges
right back. Except for that time.As i walked through the door i looked
and saw
noone by the door that could have opened it for me. At that time all i
had was
1 server who was taking an order in the dining room at the time, 1 cook
that
was on the grill line cooking an order and me, no dishwasher yet.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Things have been progressing over the last 3
years. When i walked out of my office one night after closing, the dish
cart
started rolling from the swinging door to the diningroom right in front
of me.
I was the only one left in the building!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now things are starting to happen in the front of the house. I
now am
running shifts during the day. from 5:30 in the morning till 3 or 4 pm
depending. Glass racks are coming out of thair slots by them selfs. on
time a
rack came completley out of it's slot and fell on the floor. With only
one
server there, and she was nowhere near it. she got scarred when she saw
that.
we always see a shadow figure walk around in the dining room now. Also
on the
Grill line and then back to the dry storageroom. All the employees have
had
some kind of something happen that neither one of us can explain. But
we don't
get a bad feeling when anything happens so we just named the shadow
figure" george". We also talk to geoge alot. when asked to please
stop moving things, it stops, if only for that day. We all shure would
like to
know what is going on here, and how did "george" come into a brand
new building to stay?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing scarry I
know, but they are not all scarry. I think ghosts are just people like
us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thanks for reading<span style="">&nbsp;
