<p><b>Another Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: prtblonde@excite.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hi, I would like to tell you things that been happening here lately,</b>
<br><b>This is the 3rd time i am writing to you about happenings. This
time it is just like the first time something quite nice.</b>
<br><b>I am German and came here in 1990 to live with my husband. In 1994
my Grandmother ( moms mom) died of cancer. My Brother, mother and i were
very upret and hurt to have lost her. After we took care of things and
she was laied to rest i came back over here and tryed as good as posible
to go with my live. My Grandmother ( OMA)</b>
<br><b>did come by my house a few times. But not as much as she has in
the last few month.</b>
<br><b>She desidet to show up for Christman of last year to join us. It
was quite funny really, as first she played with one of the kitchen lamps
right above the kitchen sink. So i took a look and well, she was tryin
g to tell me to clean the dishes and the sink. The kitchen sink was always
the most important area to keep spotless at all times for her in live.
So i told her i was sorry and cleaned everything so she would be happy.
Then when i was done, i went into the livingroom to sit down for a few
minutes. It just so happens that my old t son is very psychic. He started
laughing at me and asked me to get back up as i just sat right ontop of
her. I jumped up, got my camera to take a pic of her. As i was standing
infront of the chair, she went right behind me and fixed my shirt in the
back. It was not hanging straight down, and she did not like it. I can
not tell you how it felt to have the spirit of my oma fix my shirt.</b>
<br><b>So month went by and she would come over and always play with the
lamp above the sink to let us know she was here. I talked to her and felt
alot of love from her.</b>
<br><b>So, the other night, i went to bed early. At 1 am i woke up. so
i got up and watched TV for a few m inutes, then laied back down. After
laying in bed for about 15 minutes i felt that someone was right behind
me. I just knew that if i would have turned around, ( i was laying on my
left side with my back to the door) that i would see her standing there.
I had kicked my blanket off of me because it was very warm in the room.Except
the area where oma stood. I had my eyes open and saw the she picked up
my blanket and tucked me in. Is that sweet oe what?</b>
<br><b>i was so touched. The night after that i dreamed of her telling
me that she is happy and everything is just fine with her. I already knew
that, but it was still very nice to hear her say it</b>

<br><b>The Little Dog</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cheese-head@att.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>This story is completely true and real. It may not sound scary but
it was freaky to me. Okay here it goes.</b>
<br><b>I had just gotten out of college and&nbsp; after staying at my parents
and looking for a house to rent, I found a nice house about thirty miles
away from my parent's house.</b>
<br><b>On moving day, I was packing my belongings inside my father's uhaul
he had rented. My mother was in the van already with my younger&nbsp; brother.I
was just getting in when I heard a whimper under the van so I peeked under.
I saw a little black dog. I've always been an animal lover so I reached
under the car to pick it up. It imeadiatley started growling at me. So
I pulled back a little. Then, it started coming out towards me and wagging
it's tail. After I persuaded it with a piece of meat it let me pick it
up. My little brother was so excited to see a dog that he jumped out of
the van and started petting it.</b>
<br><b>I was allowd to have pets in the house but there was something I
didn't like about this dog once I had picked it up. I looked for identification
tag but all I could find on the mutt was a cross necklace carved out of
wood. Then I noticed the cross had flames engraved and painted on it. I
reached to take the necklace off when I touched it the finger I touched
it with started burning and hurting badly. I howled with fright, surprise,
and pain. When I let go of the necklace the pain went away.</b>
<br><b>My mother hopped out of the van and started inquiring over what
had happened. When I told her what had happenedshe didn't believe me so
she patted the frightened dog in my hands and then touched the cross. She
screamed and when she screamed her eyes turned fiery red untill she let
go of the cross.</b>
<br><b>I put the dog down instantly but when I put it down it started barking
madly and growling. It ran up to my little brother and bit him. In my brother's
defense he smaked the dog upside the head. When he did the dog howled(he
had thrown the dog clear across our driveway) the dog's howl sounded so
awful. My dad ran into the garage and grabbed a shovel. The dog started
running towards me and just before he bit me my dad whacked him in the
head with a shovel. The dog hit the concrete and blood started coming out
of his nose. My dad threw it into our small pond to drown it.</b>
<br><b>W instantly all got into the van without talking. We didn't talk
untill about five miles left to the house. It was my brother who spoke.
He said I don't like that dog. We all agreed. I said I think I'm going
to get a nice dog from a pet store not a pound. We got to the house and
my dad parked and was about to get out when he saw a little dog with a
cross on it's neck. We sped away.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Evil Warrior Pygmies</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: gildedbutterflydva@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This incident happened to me when I was about 5 years old.I'm now
married, 27 yrs of age and have a daughter of my own. i can still recall
this plain as day! it freaked me out! I lived with my parents and baby
sister in a modular home in Clarksville, TN.</b>
<br><b>First of all, i'll give you a little detail of how the house was
setup. You walked into the main entry and had the living room and off to
your right you had the little hall. The first door on your right was My
bedroom and across from that was the bathroom and at the end was my sister's
room. the rest of the house detail is not really important because the
incident happened in the hall out from my room. Well, in my room. my desk
was on the wall that was opposite the living room. My bed was on the wall
opposite the hall by the door.</b>
<br><b>Anyways. i was sitting at my desk listening to the tape and storybook
things i had gotten from the previous Christmas. it was a nice spring day&nbsp;
and i had gotten home from school. Well as i am sitting there, i happen
to turn my head to the right and i see these too little armored people
running past my doorway. well one stops and gives me this aweful look.
the other one just keeps going. they look like little pigmies. they were
about 2 feet tall, had metal helmets and chest plates and the one that
looked at me carried a very medeival looking weapon in his right hand (a
bat with spikes at the end). Well after he gave me the look he turned and
ran towards the living room. i was like "What the heck did i just see?"
i walked out and they werent there. My mom and sister were in the kitchen
when i came out. i was white as a sheet and i told my mom but she thought
it was overactive imagination, but it freaked me out. i never saw them
again after that. it was really weird because our house was fairly new
and the land had never had any sort of house on it. So i can't explain
what happened that day!</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Doors</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: larrypowers515@MSN.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have sent in the story Ghost story.&nbsp; Now I was going down
your list of haunted places in Iowa and I noticed Dowling Catholic High
School was on there.&nbsp; I go there!&nbsp; Seeing this got me thinking
about something strange that happened to me the other night.&nbsp; I'm
a freshman and have been going there for about a month or so.&nbsp; So
after football practice around 6 o'clock these double doors in the cafeteria
slam shut and no one is there but me because I went back up for a gatorade.&nbsp;
The doors could be auto set to shut but for some reason I felt like I wasn't
alone when it happened.&nbsp; I just thought it was an overactive imagination
until I read this.&nbsp; I don't know if the doors are set to shut or not
but I just thought I'd share a little strange story I had.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Boy in the Bathroom</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: PLF@bbl-inc.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My husband and I bought a house 3 years ago.&nbsp; We moved in near
the end of October 2001.&nbsp; This incident happened in the spring of
the following year (I think).&nbsp; One night, my 3-year-old son was asleep
in bed and my husband and I were watching television.&nbsp; I took a potty
break.&nbsp; Our downstairs bathroom is off the kitchen.&nbsp; I walked
through the kitchen without turning the light on.&nbsp; When I was leaving
the bathroom, I turned out the fluorescent bathroom light.&nbsp; I saw
a flash of a boy.&nbsp; It was like when you look at a light too long and
then there's an impression on your vision afterwards, except this impression
was of a boy with a striped shirt on.</b>
<br><b>A couple of days later, my son was doing the pee-pee dance, and
I told him to go to the bathroom.&nbsp; He started crying and saying he
was too scared to go into the bathroom.&nbsp; I asked him why, and he said
because of the boy in the bathroom.&nbsp; Because of my vision a couple
of days ago outside the bathroom, I was prompted to ask my son what the
boy looked like, expecting him to tell me about the striped shirt.&nbsp;
He said he couldn't see him because he was invisible.&nbsp; I was surprised
that my son used that word; I didn't think a 3-year-old would know such
a big word.&nbsp; I took my son into the bathroom with me, and we said
a prayer for the spirit of the boy in the bathroom to find his way and
to leave our house.</b>
<br><b>My son didn't have anymore fear of the bathroom; however, he started
talking to an "imaginary friend" that he called Junior.&nbsp; I've been
wondering all this time if Junior was a ghost that only my son could see,
but I wasn't sure; he could just be an imaginary friend.&nbsp; I played
along with him though, as if Junior was real.</b>
<br><b>Yesterday, my son started talking to Junior while we were having
breakfast.&nbsp; I asked my son what Junior was wearing (again thinking
of my vision a couple of years ago).&nbsp; He said Junior was wearing an
orange and yellow striped shirt.&nbsp; I almost fell out of my chair.</b>
<br><b>There have been other little instances in the house since we moved
in, most of which happened in the first year.&nbsp; The t.v. would turn
on by itself. The lights on the ceiling fan turned on by themselves.&nbsp;
One of my son's toys starting running, but the button was in the off position.&nbsp;
All of these could probably be explained somehow, like maybe a neighbor's
remote was affecting our electronics, and maybe the batteries in my son's
toy were going bad * who knows.</b>
<br><b>What can't be explained is that twice when I was just waking up,
someone spoke right in my ear.&nbsp; Once it was a "psssst" sound, the
other time, a man called my name.&nbsp; Just last week my son was in the
upstairs bathroom washing his hands.&nbsp; He cried out my name.&nbsp;
When I asked him what he wanted he asked if I just called his name.&nbsp;
When I told him no, he said someone had whispered his name while he was
washing his hands.&nbsp; When I asked him if it was a grownup or a kid,
he said it was a grownup.&nbsp; When I asked him if it was a man or a worman,
he said it was a man.&nbsp; My son and I were the only ones in the house
at the time.</b>
<br><b>It seems that whoever is in the house is protecting our son.&nbsp;
Twice he was shocked (once by a bare 220 volt wire while we were looking
at the house before we bought it and once when he put a key in an outlet).&nbsp;
Both times, he came away with nothing but a slight red mark on his finger.</b>
<br><b>Either way, whoever it is seems friendly, so I'll just keep praying
for him.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Strange Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cliff.autin@cox.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>In 1988, the mother of my brother's girlfriend committed suicide.&nbsp;
The lady was distraught over the breakup of her marriage, blaming it on
her husband's affair with his childhood sweetheart.&nbsp; My brother's
girlfriend was at my mother's house when her father had to come over and
break the terrible suicide news to her.&nbsp; To say the least, the atmosphere
was highly charged with emotion at mother's home that day.&nbsp; Mother
and my step-father had grown close to the lady prior to her suicide.</b>
<br><b>Later that day, mother was laying down alone in her bedroom to try
and calm down.&nbsp; She had turned off all of the lights in the room in
order to completely relax.&nbsp; One of the lamps in her bedroom inexplicably
turned itself on for about two seconds.</b>
<br><b>This may not be the most terrifying or dramatic of haunting experiences
but I think it helps to have it documented.</b>

<p><b>My Grandmothers and My House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Bellwitch08@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have 2 experiences to tell. I will start with the one that doesn't
have many experiences in it.</b>
<br><b>well a lot of people in my family seem to have ghost experiences
that happen to them especially my stepdad.</b>
<br><b>I live in a townhome and we lived here about 4 years. things started
happening about 2 years after we lived here but they've only happened to
me. One night i was upstairs in my room by myself and as i was typing i
swore i saw someone standing RIGHT BESIDE ME!!!!</b>
<br><b>but as i turned and looked there was nothing there. But i remembered
that whatever it was had blonde hair and was about as tall as my cousin
who Robby who died about 5 or&nbsp; years earlier. My hair was standing
up straight.</b>
<br><b>One other night i was upstairs taking a bath and there are two bedrooms
up stairs but no one was in them at the time and the tvs weren't on. My
aunt and grandmother were downstairs watching TV. but i can't hear the
tv upstairs and anyways i had the water running. Well while the water was
running i heard a voice outside of the door to the bathroom yell "Mom Help
me!!"it sounded like a teenage boy's voice and it was very clear. I asked
my aunt and grandmother if they had heard it but they said no and it could've
been the tv and i said i had the water running and no radios or tvs were
on upstairs. Also when i'm by myself downstairs and i'm going upstairs
i turn the lights off downstairs and run up reallllllllllllllly fast becuase
i always have a feeling that something is coming behind me. And when i'm
asleep with my back turned towards the door i sometimes get a feeling that
someone is watching me or standing behind me and i'll turn over and look
but noone is there.</b>
<br><b>i'll save the other story for some other time.</b>

<p><b>My Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Sexygoth24226865@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>hi my name is kerry i'm 15 and i live in altofts in west yorkshire
in england. i've had quite a few experiances well i like to think they
are!</b>
<br><b>i've lived in haunted houses al my life my first house was haunted
by a ghost who helped look after me and my brother and my first experiance
is with this ghost.</b>
<br><b>well one night i was in bed and i thought my mum was at work that
night and i also thought it as really late in theory it was only nine o'clock.
but i heard the t.v on and i thought that my dad was in bed asleep so i
thought there was monsters downstairs plotting to kill me ( i was very
young) so i got up and went into my mum and dads bedroom ( this was the
haunted room) and i saw my dad or something layed on his side of the bed
so i thought it was him so i asked him if i could get in bed with him because
i was scared&nbsp; and i heard someone or something replie yes!&nbsp;&nbsp;
so i got in and for about half an hour i tried to&nbsp; sleep then i rolled
over to say thankyou and the bed was empty except for me . i ran out of
theat bedroom and into my brothers room and told him and we both went downstairs
together and told out parents.</b>
<br><b>that is my most vivid experiance but later on in the years that
i lived there someone had given us a bull mastiff ( we also had two other
dogs too)and i can remember i was sat in the living room on my own with
duke ( the bull mastiff) and he suddnely stood up and stared into the left
hand corner and started wagging his tail then he suddenly ran out of the
room so i look in the corner and saw nothing then he came back in and stared
right at me but not at me he was looking behind me and he started growling
so i turned round to see if there was someone in the window but there wasn't
then the dog ran out of the room yelping so i got up looked outside there
was noone there so i ran into the backyard to sit with the dogs untill
my dad got home.</b>
<br><b>i also saw a cloaked figure dragging his foot past the garden gate
thid was a different day at about ten it also felt like you were being
watched and it was always freezing in my hpouse even in the summer or with
the central heating my freinds refused to stay there so when we moved out
i thought that was the end of it all i was wrong i was at my new house
when it was just me and my friend sat in my room talking about stuff when
i suddenly heard someone run upstairs and so did my friend so i thought
it was just my cusin then i heard the person run down stairs again but
heard noone leave so i went downstairs remembered that i'd locked the door
and went back upstairs then we heard it again but this time it kept going
like childrenand the minute i opened my bedroom door it would stop and
when i shut it again they would start.</b>

<p><b>Little Boy at Gettysburg</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: psonski@pngusa.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I go the Gettysburg camp ground every Halloween with my friend. Last
Halloween, we met a boy who claimed to see ghosts all the time. We don’t
know if he’s lying or not, but Gettysburg is very haunted. I’ve heard weird,
random noises that I can’t explain at times. And I see random lights in
the far-off distance down a river and into the nearby woods at night. One
occasion that the boy told us about was seeing a little boy dressed in
1800’s attire run past him without making any sound at all.</b>

<p><b>I Have a Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: psonski@pngusa.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My story is pretty long. It all started with my grandpa, who is now
in his mid-70’s. when he was young, he lived in a haunted house in Springfield,
Mass with his family. He said everyday he’d hear loud footsteps coming
from random rooms in the house, even when he was home alone. The family
grew to get used to the ghost, since it was just loud and not harmful.
One day when my grandpa was about 21, he was home alone with his big, mean,
fearless “wolf dog” as he called it. All of a sudden, the dog’s head lifted,
and he watched the dog’s eyes follow something across the room. The dog
continued to do this for a while, and my grandpa figured it was probably
just the ghost, and continued what he was doing. All of a sudden, the dog
got onto his feet and started to bark loudly and snarl. My grandpa was
startled and watched the dog in horror. Then the dog’s tail went between
his legs, he started whimpering and ran towards my grandpa, who grabbed
his collar and ran out of the house and as far away as he could go. He
told me several times that his dog was afraid of nothing, and he’d never
seen him scared before. They moved out, and he went back to visit about
10 years later. No one was living there, and he went to a neighbor’s house
and asked about it. The man told him that nobody’s lived there in 10 years,
because people don’t stay there for too long. And now, I think my grandpa’s
house is haunted, but nobody believes me. His current house is in Barkhamsted,
Conn, his wife, my grandma, died in 1995. About a year or so after her
death, (I was only about 7 or 8) my grandpa heard a very strange voice
coming from downstairs when he was home alone. He ran downstairs because
he thought it was a burgular, but he only found his cat in a corner with
his hair standing straight up. The cat obviously was horrified, so something
had to have been in his house. He describes the voice to me as “un-humanly”.
And in July 2003 I was spending the night in his house with my mom and
brother while he was on vacation. I was sleeping in his room, which has
no clock or telephone. I couldn’t sleep, and my watch said it was 12:30.
All of a sudden, there was this very, very loud ring that came out of nowhere!
I couldn’t even tell where in the room it came from. But it was a very
old fashioned kind of ring, like from an old movie, not like a telephone
ring or an alarm clock. And it only rang once. I found that very strange,
and I’ve searched for what could have made that noise, and I’ve found nothing.
This past summer, his wife says that when she’s alone she gets strange
feelings like there’s someone else in the house, but of course there’s
no one there. Yeah, my story’s kinda long, but it’s all true.</b><b></b>

<br><b>HAVING DOUBTS?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Ijuannie93@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I don't know whether or not I'm on the correct web page with this
story I'm about to share with you.&nbsp; However, I do know that I have
a supernatural story to tell because it is not a normal everyday occurrence.&nbsp;
This event occurred when I was 18yrs old.&nbsp; I was fresh out of High
school and I had just discovered that I was pregnant.&nbsp; I was so upset
because I felt that I was ruining my chances of getting a higher education
and excelling myself.&nbsp; I was also upset because my so called boyfriend
didn't want anything to with me. One day during that summer, I was home
alone and laying in my parents bed crying my heart out.&nbsp; I was having
doubts about whether there was a God, because if there was he wouldn't
have his children go through so much heartache such as this.&nbsp; I had
a two year scholarship to attend Maryland U and it is ruined and I don't
believe in having abortions.&nbsp; Then suddenly I was unable to move.&nbsp;
It was like someone or something invisible just came in and sat on me.&nbsp;
I couldn't get up, move my legs or my arms. I then, closed my eyes and
attempted to scream, but nothing came out.&nbsp; When I opened my eyes,
I noticed a transparent figure above me looking down at me. I'm not sure
but it closely resembled my grandfather on my father's side. I closed my
eyes once more and&nbsp; I suddenly had a flashfoward if that's such a
word.&nbsp; I saw my son's face, myself walking across the stage in front
of a&nbsp; large crowd accepting my degree, and the look on my face a very
exhilarating expression.&nbsp; Then all of a sudden the weight was lifted
off of me, and my flashforward images disappeared. When I opened my eyes
the transparent figure was gone.&nbsp; As I slowly sat up on the bed my
hand felt something that wasn't there before, when I turned to observe
the strange object, I noticed that it was the frame that hung up over my
mother's bed with the lord's prayer.&nbsp; Being the skeptic that I am
I immediately threw my experience off as frame falling on my head causing
a temporary blackout.&nbsp; Although there were no evidence of scars, bruises
or soreness to back that claim. I only begin to realize that maybe something
unnatural occurred when I over heard my father speaking with my mother
a few days after my experience. He had told her that he could have sworn
he saw his father that morning when he was in the kitchen cooking breakfast.&nbsp;
My mother responded by telling him that maybe your father has something
to tell you or maybe something is going on with a family member that we
need to know about.&nbsp; Later that day I sat down with my parents and
told them about my situation, it was hard but I knew it was something I
had to do.&nbsp; I even told them about the experience I had with Papa
my grandfather and they believed me.&nbsp; I found out that my family are
not strangers to sightings of past family members. That was twelve years
ago, and although it hasn't been easy being a single mother, things are
on the right path.&nbsp; I have my own home, a good career, and I'm in
my third year at Maryland U college online with a "B" average.&nbsp; But
most of all, I'm happy. And that vision I had of my son during my flashforward
was right on the mark.&nbsp; The same exact face.&nbsp; I have no doubts
not any more my beliefs is that God is real and he sent an angel, my grandfather
down here to tell me that everything was going to be all right. Are you
having doubts?</b><b></b>

<p><b>Hamilton New Zealand Ghost Story</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: rivers@riverstavern.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I found your site very interesting. It is taking me awhile to read
all the stories.</b>
<br><b>I admit I don't have a great memory but one of my few childhood
memories was of waking up one night and seeing the figure of a young boy
at the foot of my bed. He was transparent. I was not scared or anything.
I blinked for a second and he was gone. My door was close and there are
no other younger in the house.</b>
<br><b>There have been other odd things around the house. The first was
a sawing noise in the middle of the night only I could hear clear as a
bell. I tired working out where it was but the sound faded. My parent could
not here it.</b>
<br><b>Another night I hear someone walking upstairs. It wasn't my parents
and the doors where locked and the windows closed.</b>
<br><b>The next odd thing happened when I was on the toilet. Our toilet
is in a room by itself and is less than a meter wide and two meters long.
The toilet is opposite the door. Anyway I suddenly had this urge to look
left. Instead of the wall I was looking at a field with a man in it. The
man was staring at me. I gasped and quickly turned my head with the shock
of it all and then looked back again but the wall was normal again. It
was very unnerving.</b>
<br><b>The only thing I could figure in with the boy and the man was the
other side of the creek was an abandoned farm with a burnt out farm cottage.
It was abandoned as far I a can remember. It is gone now and the land turned
into housing. I don’t know how it was burnt or when. My parents did use
some of the old fireplace bricks for the patio, drive and garden.</b><b></b>

<p><b>When I was young about 6 I was living with my mom my father and older
brother, we had recently just bought a house in washington...I had never
had an experience with ghosts before so I didnt know what I had been feeling
since I moved in, when I walked through the halls at night I felt a creeping
figure behind me and the hairs on my neck stand up, It was so cold when
I opened my closet, like a freezer.. I could see my breath every time I
opened it, I checked but there were no openings or drafts..About a month
after we moved in things began to happen, we were in the living room with
candles lit(Power outage) and as soon as I was about to talk to my parents
about the feeling I had the candles flames lit up and melted the newly
bought candles to the very bottoms and went out.. We were all scared but
my father would not admit it being anything supernatural. About 2 days
later I was curious about the things happening I was stupid and asked who
was there, I felt the hair stand up on my neck and fingers running up the
side of my head, I screamed and ran to the bathroom and turned on the light,
as I did I saw a horrifying black figure fly past the door.. I stayed there
until the morning. The night of my 7th birthday I woke up to the sound
of voices... blurry eyed I looked up from my bed and saw faces on the wall,
a young child, a woman and an old black bearded man, They were talking
as if they didnt notice me but they spoke in gibberish like their voices
were being fastforwarded, then they immediately stopped and the man looked
at me directly, I felt my breath stop and hair on my neck stand up, He
glared at me and I felt horrified, He turned and spoke to the other 2 and
I could only understand one word, "kill" I was terrified and ran to my
parents room, they came in but did not see anything. About a week later
we were going to move, we were leaving at night time, as we were driving
off I looked back at the house and saw the 3 people standing there full
bodied. Later then I was about 10 I searched that house up on the Internet
and the history, I found out that a Man, a woman, and a child had all died
there in a gas leak during the night.</b>
<br><b>This is another encounter I had but happened only once, I was 11
and In a friends house sleeping the night, I woke up and was heading to
the bathroom, I head a womans voice call me from the kitchen, being a little
kid I went without suspicion, A black haired woman was sitting at the counter
staring at me, she continued to call me.. As I walked towards her I saw
she had a Butcher knife hidden behind her, I walked backwards slowly out
of the kitchen, her face changed from a beautiful kind looking woman into
a hideous mutated looking woman, I was terrified and ran from the kitchen,
the butcher knife flew next to me and stabbed into the wall. I ran and
hid in my sleeping bag until I fell asleep, the next day I went to the
kitchen and the butcher knife was sitting there in the wall, I knew now
that it was not a dream....The mother of my friend saw it and thought I
did it(of course) I never went back to his house but I found out history
on his house, a mother had killed 3 of her children in the kitchen, with
a butcher knife. My friend moved away a month later and the only explanation
was he saw a wierd woman in the kitchen and his mother didnt want to take
a chance.</b>
<br><b>And my last word of advice, Never speak to ghosts in the night,
it seems as long as you do not call,provoke or start believing in them,
they wont bother you.</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Time to Share with everyone , an event in my life that changed my
perseption of reality at a very young age.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was 5 years
old and my famly had moved into a house on Golden St. in Cirencester England
. My father was to be Stationed in Fairford England AFB in 1962.&nbsp;&nbsp;
One night I woke up in the middle of the night, I had to go to the bathroom
but I didn't want to get out of bed because of an eerie feeling that was
in the air.&nbsp; I shared a room with my 2 yr. old sister that had a pink
blanket that she would hold onto and I had a blue blanket.&nbsp; when you
would come out of my room and turn left you would walk straight down the
hall past my sisters room and to the bathroom.&nbsp; On this night I would
encounter a spirit that was almost demon like.&nbsp; I got up out of bed
and headed to the bathroom only because I really had to go. I flushed and
turned to open the door making sure to leave the light on so I could see
my way back to the room.&nbsp; As I approched my door to my room, I noticed
a pile of clothes sitting in the doorway that I would have to move to get
back to bed.&nbsp; I was wondering where the clothes came from since I
was the only one awake and had only been in the bathroom a few minutes.&nbsp;
On top of the pile of clothes was a pink blanket just like my sisters blanket.&nbsp;
I looked past the clothes and in my sisters bed to see that she had her
blanket with her.&nbsp; I was a bit&nbsp; baffled by all of this so I picked
up the pink blanket that was on top of the pile of clothes in front of
me and tossed it to the side.&nbsp; Then the next piece of clothing looked
like my sisters robes that were hanging on their door at the end of the
hall.&nbsp; When I looked at their door I saw both of their robes on the
door of their room.&nbsp; Again I was a little weirded out by all of this,
when I turned back toward&nbsp; my door I was going to reach out and grab
one of the robes off of the pile when suddenly a demonic face appeared
on the pile of clothes and screamed a blood curdling scream that went right
through me.&nbsp; I screamed louder than I have in my entire life and jumped
back in a squatting position behind a dresser in the hallway.&nbsp; My
father came running out of his room and the whole family met in the hallway.&nbsp;
My Dad picked me up and was asking me what was wrong but I could not speak
a word, I tried to say something but all I could do was point at my door
which at this point was clear of any pile of clothes or evidence of any
presence at all.&nbsp; There was much more that happened in that house
and in time I will share it all....</b>

<p><b>Toddlers</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Bellwitch08@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>i read one of your stories and she said she believes toddlers have
a 6th sense. I believe that to. My nephew and nieces mom said that sometimes
they would be playing in their room and all of a sudden they will look
up and start pointing at the wall or ceiling and smile and laugh. I didn't
really believe her that much until one night i was trying to get sarah
(my niece) to go to sleep she was laying beside me on the couch and and
kept going "shhh be quit" and then all of a sudden she looked up and pointed
at the ceiling and started smiling and stuff and i asked her what she saw
(she was about two or three at the time) she didn't say anything but just
kept smiling. i just wanted to share this. thank you</b><b></b>

<p><b>By: samyjoc@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>ok well i am absolutely sure that no one will listen to this and
will think that it is just a high school student making up stroies or hearing
things ect. but here it goes,i attend the las vegas academy of international
studies performing and visual arts and as many history books can tell you
this school (built in 1934) is haunted by an un-identified ghost that some
student decided to name 'Mr. Petri'. this ghost likes to slam doors in
the theatre,blow cold breezes on us while we practice and cause lights
to turn off for long periods of time,well for a week now when ever i walk
past 2 areas of the school campus i hear a man calling my name from about
5 feet away from me,but when i turn around,there is no one looking at me
or calling any other person,and yesterday when my bus was late *as usual*
i was walking across the parking lot to get to choir all alone when i heard
the some one calling my name,but i there was no one else around because
no one else had to get to sunset hall,i think that this might be 'mr petri'
tyring to get in touch with me,and even if you dont believe my story then
at least now you know a little bit about mr petri the lva ghost</b><b></b>

<p><b>ANother Ghost Story for your Files</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: madcatbellino@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Forgive me if this is long, but it is nice to finally tell someone
about this.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; I am uncomfortable talking about this with others in person,
because I usually get that "are you crazy?" look. I am glad that there
is a place to read and compare experiences without feeling ridiculous.
I started experiencing bizarre things around the age of 25. These things
usually happen when I have just fallen asleep. I struggle with insomnia
so keep in mind that my experiences could be linked to exhaustion. (At
least that is what I would like to think sometimes.)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Back in 1994, I feel asleep on my couch and woke up to a
transparent Pepsi can (it was a Pepsi can design that they use to market
back in the late 70's or early 80's) floating 5 feet in front of me. Every
time I blinked or rubbed my eyes it would move farther away. It floated
all the way upstairs until it disappeared.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; A few years later I rented an old farmhouse that was built
across from a school house built in the 1800's. There was also a church
across the street built around the same time. Keep in mind that this was
out in a country setting. Again, I had fallen asleep on the couch. I woke
up to a woman standing in my kitchen doorway. She didn't have any color;
she was a transparent/ black and white image. She was wearing an apron,
her hair was pulled up and her arms were folded in front of her. I watched
her watching me for a few seconds, and then I fearlessly threw my blanket
over my head! I later convinced myself that I was dreaming.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; A lot of other unexplained things happened while we lived
in that house. Water would turn on in the upstairs bathroom, doors would
open and close on their own and objects would be missing and then randomly
reappear. My oldest son who was 13 at the time lost $10.00 somewhere in
the house. He looked all night rummaging through papers, closets and his
pants pockets. About 1 am I heard him upstairs still walking around searching
for his money! I stood at the bottom of the stairs and called his name.
He didn't answer because, he was sound asleep in his bed!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Another incident actually happened during the day. I went
outside with my dog. My husband and my other son age 3 and daughter age
1 1/2 were inside. I heard a young child crying. I thought that it came
from inside the house. When I went in to check, everyone was playing quietly.
I asked my husband if someone was crying before I came in, he said no.
Later, a relative that grew up in the area told me that a little boy drowned
in the pond just 200 feet from my house back in the 60's. He fell out of
a tree into the pond and broke his neck. I think my three year old son
had an experience too.&nbsp; My brother and his girlfriend were babysitting
for us and my son said to them "There's that man again." My brother's girlfriend
asked "What man honey?" My son pointed to an empty hallway and replied
"That man." She said that he kept insisting he was there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I could excuse these experiences as imagination, lack of
sleep or stress. The last experience I had in that house was hard to brush
off. Once again I had been asleep. I woke up, my heart was racing. I looked
at my bedroom door and saw this "thing" fly into my room from the hallway.
It resembled a skeleton, its arms and legs were drawn into its body similar
to the fetal position. It appeared to grip the ceiling over my bed directly
above me. Its head turned upside-down to look at me. It had what looked
like dust particles drawn to it. Whenever it moved, the dust moved with
it. I was scared out of my mind, but all I could do was lay there in shock
and disbelief! I bravely pulled the covers over my head. I looked out again
and it was still looking at me. It appeared to cock its head as if it was
puzzled by me. I didn't know what to do so I decided to give it a dirty
look. It nodded its head and flew back out the door. I can imagine what
some people are thinking as they are reading this "She was probably overtired
again or needs psychiatric drugs." I would think that too, but I saw my
cat watch that thing fly out of my bedroom! I bet you are also asking yourself
why we didn't move the hell out of there. Well, the only witnesses I had
with these experiences were a three year old, a thirteen year old and a
cat. My husband never believed any of it. So I convinced myself that it
didn't happen. We finally moved out of that house, THANK GOD!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; We bought a house and moved in April of this year. I thought
that everything would be better. Well, I was wrong. We bought a two family
house. When we were fixing up the side that we wanted to rent out, I would
get the feeling that someone was watching us (now you are probably thinking
I have schizophrenia.) I would paint, clean up my mess and get the heck
out of there as soon as possible! I had a feeling who was watching us,
but I never told my husband how I felt. There was only one family that
lived in that addition since it was added on in the 40's. The woman who
lived there was still alive, but her husband had passed away. I knew it
was him, I don't know why or how, I just knew.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; One night I was on the phone with a friend. My dog would
not settle down. He paced and whined all night. I tried to take him outside
a few times, but he didn't want to go. I decided to sit on the stairs next
to the front door just in case he changed his mind. I was still on the
phone when my dog started barking like he does when someone is in our driveway.
No one was outside. The next thing I know he walked into the living room
and stood in the kitchen entrance and started barking. The kitchen door
opened that lead into the empty apartment. He went nuts and the hair stood
up on his back. Then there were two loud crashes in the empty apartment.
I hung up on my friend and dialed 911. I also called my husband who works
third shift. Both my husband and a police officer searched the house inside
and out. There was no way for anyone to get in or out. We had also changed
the locks in case anyone still had keys. After the police officer left,
my husband was getting ready to go back to work. We both heard another
crash. He blamed it on our cat and went back to work. I slept with the
lights on for a week!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; We recently rented the apartment. I gave my tenants time
to get settled in. I brought paperwork over for them to sign one night.
The wife asked me "By the way, did you know you have a ghost over here?"
Her husband nodded his head; they had both witnessed a ghost. I asked them
if it was a man. They said yes and asked me if I had caught a glimpse of
it too. I finally confessed my feelings. I made a joke and said “Maybe
he is looking for his wife?” The lights over head flickered. So I said
out loud laughing “Your wife is with your daughter down the street now.”
My tenants say that they haven’t seen him since.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I consider myself to be a down to earth /common sense and
maybe a little wacky type of person. However, I try to keep an open mind.
I don’t think that we should be cocky and say that we know everything there
is to know in this world. While it is possible that my experiences are
due to insomnia, stress or an active imagination, I can’t help wondering
if there is more to it.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Experience, Malden, MA</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: anni670@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>From 1989 - 1996, I lived in a two-fmaily house in Malden, MA, located
on Washington Street near the Oak Grove MBTA Station.&nbsp; I lived with
my family- mother, father, and younger sister, in the apartment that took
up the second and third floors.&nbsp; My sister and I had the bedrooms
on the third floor.</b>
<br><b>This house was unbelievably creepy.&nbsp; Just looking up at the
house from the outside gave you a sinking, dreadful feeling.&nbsp; Inside
the house,&nbsp; there were cold spots that couldn't be explained, they'd
even happen in the dead of summer.&nbsp; We had three cats, and two of
the three wouldn't go upstairs to the third floor, they would get very
freaked out halfway up the stairs.&nbsp; Sometimes, I'd start to ascend
the stairs to go to bed at night, and I'd get this extremely foreboding
feeling as soon as my foot touched the third for fourth step, and I'd turn
around and sleep on the loveseat in the TV room downstairs rather than
go upstairs to sleep in a comfortable bed.&nbsp; I never exactly saw or
heard anything, just this awful feeling would abound in that place.&nbsp;
My sister, however, said she heard, on several occasions, the sound of
a woman crying in the attic storage room off of her bedroom.&nbsp; As she'd
open the door, the crying would get louder, but when the door was opened
all the way, it would cut off, and there'd be nothing there.&nbsp; Her
room was always cold, even in the summer.One of my cats was furiously digging
at a wall in the dining room once, and right behind that wall, were the
stairs leading up to the third-floor bedrooms.&nbsp; A friend of mine is
clairvoyant, and she refused to go into t house, would only wait for me
outisde in her car.&nbsp; She said there was something 'very bad' there.&nbsp;
Another friend wouldn't go up to the third floor, or into any room in the
apartment alone, without me going with her, because she said the house
was 'extremely scary'.</b>
<br><b>Sometime after moving out of that house, I ran into the tenant who
was residing in the first floor apartment, both when my family and I lived
upstairs, and currently.&nbsp; He said that many people got that same feeling
in his living room, which was at the front of the house, and in his kitchen,
which was in the back.&nbsp; He said the reason he couldn't keep any roommates
was because they felt 'uncomfortable' there.&nbsp; He mentioned this to
the owner once, and the owner told him there was some kind of history.
when she bought the house, the realtor told her that something bad had
happened there a bit after the house was built in 1916.&nbsp; Sometime
in the 20's, the man who owned the house came home from work.&nbsp; He
had the house built for his young wife, who he'd just married.&nbsp; He
came home a bit earlier than usual, to find his new wife and his cousin
in bed together, and the man, in a rage, shot them both dead, then went
up to the third floor, and shot himself.&nbsp; While there's no proof this
happend (I couldn't find anything in any newspaper archive in the Malden
Library about such an incident) it would certainly explain a lot of things,
wouldn't it?</b>
<br><b>Anyway, that house has since been sold, and I moved from there in
1996.&nbsp; I'm not sure if anyone currently living there has felt anything,
but that was the creepiest, freakiest place I've ever been in.&nbsp; I
was not too unhappy to move from there!</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;CCC Road Rome, Georgia</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: JessicaLi1432@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have personally walked down CCC Road with a couple of friends of
mine. Of course we didn't make it all the way down there. Awhile back you
could drive down it, but they have it blocked off now so you can only walk.
It IS true that there are only 6 bridges on the way back. While you walk
down the road you are constantly pulling spiderwebs off your face and body,
but the strange thing is is that the trees are so far apart from the road
that there is not way spiders can make a web that big, and so many of them.
No matter where you walk there are spiderweds. Also, some friends of mine
and I decided to atleast go to the last bridge, then turn around. We took
7 milkjugs full of rocks and set one on each bridge. On the way back, we
only picked up seven. There was one occasion where some friends and I got
so creeped out we turned around and began walking back. We were probably
20-30 feet from the car when we saw a black figure, it looked like a shadow
but was wearing like a cloak floating in front of us. My friend rubbed
her eyes and stood still for a second, and said "Okay I am seeing things."
When I realized that she had seen it too, we took off running.</b>

<p><b>One Room School</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Comedycrew6@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>In Plato Center Illinois on barr road my parents had rented one of
the houses that my grandparents had purchased.&nbsp; This was about twenty-five
years ago.&nbsp; When they moved in all of these very strange thing started
happening.&nbsp; My mom would set down something on the counter and go
back later to get it and it would not be there.&nbsp; Then a couple of
days would go by and it would magically appear in the same place exactually
where she had left it.&nbsp; They would hear me,&nbsp; being two at the
time talking away in my room.&nbsp; My mom would come in and ask me who
I was talking to and I would tell her Mikey.&nbsp; Even though no one was
ever in the room with me.&nbsp; They also heard strange noises at night
in the basement like a dog growling even though we did not own a dog.&nbsp;
Sometimes they would hear a big boom and the whole house would shake.&nbsp;
My father was terrified of the house with good reason.&nbsp; One time when
my mom was working nights and he was sleeping in his room when he felt
a weight on his chest when he open his eye he didn't see anyone but when
he tried to get up he couldn't.&nbsp; So he started screaming finally he
was released. He took me and spent the rest of the night at my grandmothers
house.&nbsp; We moved shortly after that incident.&nbsp; I later found
out that the house used to be a one room school house and a child had been
playing up on a ladder and falling to his death.&nbsp; Also there had been
a occult that was having meetings in the field behind the house.&nbsp;
Which we found animal skulls that they had burned for there rituals.&nbsp;
This house is still standing and from what I told still haunted today</b>

<p><b>. My Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: gjharm@charter.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is John. I live in a town in North Carolina called Boone.
My story started when I was a child about 11 years old. My parents moved
a lot because we had to go where my father made money. We moved in a large
house in the Cover Creek area. The house had I think 4 bedrooms. It had
3 upstairs and 1 downstairs if I remember correctly. It was a big house
and as a child it seemed huge. My room was upstairs (right beside the attic
of course). It was a very old house but I am not sure how old. My first
experience was about 2-3 months after we moved in. It was night and I was
off to bed. I started to climb the stairs and I could hear foot steps behind
me. I thought it was my older brother but when I turned around I seen nothing.
So I ran to my room. What is odd it done this ever night and when it did
I got this image in my head of a person and I even named him. Well anyways
at night everyone heard what seemed to be a rocking chair rocking back
and forth upstairs. We all went to go check it out and it turned out to
be nothing. My Aunt and her husband came to the house to stay the night
one day. That is where my uncle heard a dog lapping water out of a dish
or something. He jumped out of bed and looked around and there was no dog
around. We did not even own a dog at that time. Sometime after that we
got a dog and her name was Sugar. I came home from school one day and no
one was home. I went to go inside the house and my dog came to me and grabbed
my pant legs and growled and would not let me go inside. I paid no mind
the dog and went on in. I went the bathroom where I noticed a light was
on and the door was shut. We never leave the bathroom door shut when no
one was inside. I was thinking there was no one here and I was worried
and thought it may be a stranger. I bent down to look in the key and there
was this bloody nasty eye looking back at me. I jumped up as fast as I
could and ran outside with a sheet and covered up on the front porch and
waited for my father and mother to return. When they finally returned they
checked the house and no one was to be found.</b>
<br><b>Well we decided to move in another house. Not because of the stuff
that happened but because we had to for the rent was cheaper. It was a
beautiful house though I thought. We went to go look inside the windows
of the house to see what it looked like before we moved in. The first window
I looked in I seen a old man in front of a doorway holding a old metal
pail in his hand and was wearing crutches.&nbsp; I shook my head and looked
again and he was gone. I just thought it may be my imagination.</b>
<br><b>Me and my brother ran into a shed in the yard of the house and started
playing while my father and mother looked over the house. I jumped on the
rafters of the shed and fell down and when I fell something landed on top
of me. I looked to see what had dropped on me and it was old pair of crutches.
I had cold chills run all over my body then and as I type this story. We
finally got all moved in. This was a 3 bedroom house it had upstairs as
well my parents bedroom was downstairs and our bedroom was upstairs. By
the way there is six in the family. It was my Father, Mother, Sister, Brother
and my other Brother and of course me. The upstairs had two bedrooms. The
first one on the left of the staircase was me and my brothers and my sister
room was in front of ours and it had a separate door. My mother loved scaring
us kids to help us fall asleep. We had a 3 foot tall bugs bunny rabbit
that she tied to a broom handle and she would walk it up the steps as she
hid behind it. It scared the crap out of us kids. It got late and brother
and I were still awake. I thought I heard a noise on the stairs so I looked
down figuring I see my mother and I seen nothing but the huge rabbit on
the bottom step where my mother left it. Well about two or three minutes
later we heard a tapping sound coming from the steps. I figured mom heard
us talking and was going to try to scare us again. I ran to the steps to
see that the rabbit was half way up the steps and no one was behind it.
I ran as fast as I could to mothers room and she was sound asleep. I don’t
think I ever been so scared in my life. My mother saw a glowing object
coming from down the stairs as well at one time. Like a big sphere of some
sort. My sister had a small television in her room. She would leave it
on the cartoon channel at all times. When she left the room and returned
the television was always on another channel or turned off. It has been
doing this for some time now. We decided to unplug and then come back and
see what happened. Well did and when we returned the television was on
and turned way up. My brother and I witnessed my sister bed shaking up
and down so hard by it self with her in it. Me and my brother both had
to sit on bed to make it stop.</b>

<p><b>My Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tammygirl30@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Back in 1991 I moved into an old house in springfield, MO by myself.&nbsp;
Nothing happened that I really remember except my dog used to run from
room to room barking at the closet doors.&nbsp; I just assumed she heard
something outside or maybe a mouse.&nbsp; After about 2 months, a friend
of mine moved in with me.&nbsp; One night we were in his room, laying on
his bed talking, all of the lights in the house were off.&nbsp; At the
same time we both said "do you see that?"&nbsp; Right up above the doorway
to his room was this real pale green smoke or fog.&nbsp; I freaked out,
he thought it was cool so when it started to move slowly, he got up and
followed it.&nbsp; It went into my room and into the closet.&nbsp; From
that point on, things started happening.&nbsp; The t.v. would constantly
turn itself on right after it was turned off, you would fight it several
times and finally say, that's enough, and it would stay off.&nbsp; The
answering machine would come on by itself without the phone ringing and
then would be flashing 1 message, but nothing but static would be on the
tape.&nbsp; The doors to our t.v. room would constantly open and close
with us sitting at the kitchen table (there was no breeze coming from anywhere).&nbsp;
One day we had bought some mini chocolate bars and had seperated them (we
each l e a certain kind) and left them on the coffee table.&nbsp; Later
we both left for work at the same time.&nbsp; My friend had gotten off
of work early and he called me at work to ask me why I ate all of his chocolate.&nbsp;
I told him that I hadn't been home since we had left for work.&nbsp; He
laughed and said he would leave the wrappers the way he found them for
me to see when I got home.&nbsp; The wrappers were folded out flat and
stacked perfectly on top of each other in the middle of the coffee table
(maybe the dog ate the chocolate??).&nbsp; At christmas, garland would
be moved from where we put it, placed in a perfect circle on the couch.&nbsp;
It was a curious ghost, we never felt at all in danger.&nbsp; The only
time I got spooked was when my fiance and I were in the t.v. room watching
movies in the dark.&nbsp; He got up to go to the kitchen and fix him something
to eat.&nbsp; I was laying on the couch facing the doorway, the bathroom
was just outside the t.v. room, I saw a perfect shadow of someone going
into the bathroom.&nbsp; I thought it was my fiance, so I got up to ask
him something, he was standing at the kitchen sink, the bathroom was empty.&nbsp;
My fiance really didn't believe the ghost story until one night we had
rented the movie "somewhere in time".&nbsp; We got tired so we turned it
off, t.v. and vcr, and went to bed.&nbsp; After I got in bed, I had to
get back up and go to the bathroom.&nbsp; When I walked back into the living
room, the t.v. was back on and the movie was playing again (my roommate
was not home at the time, so noone could have turned it back on), my fiance
was freaked out and then to top it off, the answering machine turned on
by itself again, it was great to see a grown man pull the covers over his
head and hide.&nbsp; When we moved out, I kind of hoped it would follow,
but it didn't.&nbsp; Must have loved the home it was in.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Across the Street</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Comedycrew6@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>In creston Illinois there is a house across the street from me that
is claimed to be haunted.&nbsp; We recently moved here and we were introducing
ourselves to the neighbors when we heard this claim.&nbsp; He told us that
he has a ghost in his house and he knows the name of the ghost.&nbsp; He
told us the name of the ghost that frequently visits him and told the reason
he knows the ghost by name.&nbsp; It seems that he had found a head stone
in his yard while doing some landscaping and upon more digging he had actually
found the coffin.&nbsp; He called the county about what he had found they
were not suprised they told him there used to be a cemetary where his house
is now.&nbsp; When they told him how much it would cost to remove the body
he decided to leave the body there and just move his digging a little to
the left.&nbsp; So the coffin still lays in the ground and the ghost still
remains in the house.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunted Home</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Spirk187@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm writing you about my own experience in my
home. I live in Springdale PA and have had many experiences along with
others that have lived here. I've lived in my house for 25 years and from
when I was small I have seen things but always put they off as my own imagination...That
is until strange things were brought up by other who live in the house.</b>
<br><b>I live on Pittsburgh St. in Springdale we own a large home that
has 3 other apartments besides our own dwelling. Many people over the years
have told us different things about different occurrences in the home before
my parents bought it. Everything from a fire killing two to the roof blowing
off years ago. My first experience that I remember was late at night bedroom
doors would creek open with no one there, once 3 doors shut at once and
my whole family stood there in amazement.&nbsp; Apparently for many years
my parents thought the house was just like any other house until we did
some remodeling and found a plaque that named the owner of the house as
Dr. Johnston. Everyone believed that the house across the street was his
but the plaque proved other wise. The plaque was for insulation and is
dated July of 1935. The reason for the mix up may be because the houses
were at one time moved and addresses changed, the number on the plaque
is 2 off from what the addresses is now. I tried to do some research into
the house but found very little. I looked through the census and found
the doctor his wife and his two boys but also interesting enough also some
live in patients. So was this the hospital built in 1915? Seems to be what
everyone agrees on. It definitely is a strange place. The third floor seems
to be where almost everything happens. Anyone that lived there reports
seeing a girl in the living room area. Until recently I didn't believe
it. The apartment on the third floor is now vacant and we have been doing
work on it to get it ready for someone new to move into it. One night after
turning off the light my brother went back in to get some tools he left
behind. As he walked in the door the girl walked right past the opening
to the hall way. He looked around and seen no one and got out as fast as
he could. He's not one to make things up and he was listening to his Walkman
at the time and was a little spaced...so it didn't seem like he's was trying
to be funny in anyway. My aunt lived on our third floor and second floor
for many years and reported the girl a few times...along with other strange
things. She and her friends used Ouija boards a few times and thought they
talked to someone. My mother went up to get my aunts laundry and the Ouija
slid from under the bed. That moment she threw it away and never told anyone
till she told me after my brother saw the girl...she swore me never to
tell my aunt. She also told me when I was about two I would see the girl
in the basement and she would hate to go down there with me cause I would
always ask..."who's that lady over there??" So many other stories have
come from this house. Far too many for me to write. I now have a room in
the basement and anytime I hear or see anything I try to ignore it because
as a child I spent many sleepless night and don't want to feel uncomfortable
in this house. Very little else is known about the house..all former owners
dead now...still everyone who knows about the house asks me all the time
if anything new is happening. So far it's been quiet but when we get a
new tenant for the third floor it maybe a different story. Sorry this is
so long hope you can use it and shorten it. Thank you</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunted Elementery School</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Tjs123456789@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>this school is located on pardee just north of wick.&nbsp; in the
city of taylor, michigan. it has been the place of many unusual experiences.
4 children were killed on a carnival ride at Taylor Town shopping center
in the mid 1960's. they all atended this school there is even a plaque
in remembrance of them in the hallway of the main entrance. my husband
has worked there for many years and has become familiar with the happenings.
not to say it doesn't still rattle him from time to time. many of his prior
co-workers have quit because they couldn't handle the freaky happenings.
i'm surprised this story isn't on your site. by the way my husband is a
janitor and works afternoons. there are many who&nbsp; will attest to these
happenings. and as a freakish co-incidence my husband was at the scene
of the tragic accident. he was on the ride that killed the young kids prior
to their turn to ride the ride. as he exited the ride he told the worker
of the ride something was wrong. the guy blew him off.&nbsp; the 4 kids
took his seat on the ride and my husband a boy at the time watched in horror
and the children met their horrid deaths. he was in shock. someone took
his coat off of him to use on one of the injured children. all of this
should be able to be verified with newspapers.</b>

<br><b>Enchantment of the Seas</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: evie1@shaw.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>A few years ago i worked on an older royal caribbean cruise ship
called the enchantment of the seas. in the very bottom levels of the ship
there are areas that contain water tight doors that in the event of an
emergency such as a breach in the hull, they can close off and stop the
ship from filling with water. As soon as the doors start to close there
is no way of stopping them unless you can call the bridge in time from
the phones that are located within the flood areas and give the captain
a good enough reason to override the water tight doors from closing. Well,
many years before I started working there, as told to me by the officer
who oriented me to the ship, during a normal hurricain season while the
ship was on its regular eastern caribbean itinerary, something went wrong
on the outer hull. there was either a small crack or a rivet was loose
or something but in any case the very bottom starboard side of the ship
started to fill with water. The bridge was allerted right away by sensors
all over the ship and the water tight doors started closing. a new off
duty crew member and her boyfriend were making out in the flood area of
the ship during their break and got cought between the doors and the interior
of the ship. the guy got through before the doors closed but the girls
pant let got cought on a somehthing before she could get all the way throught
the door. You have to know that when the thick steel doors start to close
it isn't like an elevator and you cant put your hand in the way of a sensor
and stop them to get out. you either get out or your done for. the girl's
pant leg got cought on something in her haste to get through the doors
and she fell right in the the doorway so that the bottom part of her legs
from her mid thight down was on the flood side and the rest of her was
on the inside. the officer telling me the story said that the fall must
have knocked her out and her boyfriend didn't notice her scream at first
becouse of the alarms and people yelling and she was cut almost in half
by the doors. she was still alive but in deep shock when she was pulled
away from the doors and dragged about ten metres down the hall before she
gave up the ghost literally. anyway this was the story told to me on my
first day of orientation. around a month into my contract I was out partying
after work with some of my mates at the crew bar after a ton of drinks
we went to one of their cabins to drink some more. we got into talking
about what happened to that girl and i thought it was just a legend meant
to scare new crew member from messing with the doors. the next day was
an early morning port day which meant that the duty free shops that i was
working in had to be closed and i could sleep in so 2 my mates and i decided
it would be fun to sneak into the bowels of the ship with our blankets
and beer and spend the rest of the night waiting for the ghost of the girl
that supposedly haunted the particular starboard hallway of the ship. some
time went by and we were having a good time whispering, laughing and drinking
when suddenly the yellow emergency light above our heads flashed around
once but the siren that acompaneid it did not go on. we giggled and thought
that was weird and didn't think much more about. i, however, thought that
it got even colder suddenly then it was earlier. i didn;t say anything
because i thought it was just my imagination after all we were well below
sea level sitting on a steel floor and drinking cold beer. anyway i suddenly
wanted to pee so i asked if they wanted to come with me as it was two levels
up the stairs and i still wasn't that familiar with the layout of the ship.
my two friend wanted to stay so i went on alone. i didn;t have a watch
but it must have been really early in the morning as in 3am or so because
the lower crew levels were a ghost ship. after i was done i proceeded to
head back and this is where the weirdness begins. like i said i wasn't
completly familair with the ship so i took a wrong turn and got lost along
the way. when i fianlly got to an area that i recognised as the right hallway
all the flourescent lights above my head started to go of one by one for
just a moment and i was leaft in complete blackness. then they just came
back on but i suddenly had the feeling that i was not alone. I had a very
heavy paniced feeling and my legs fealt like lead. i started walking down
the hallway but the farther i walked the more panic filled me. i remember
thinking to myself just stay calm it's just a cruise ship not a midi-evil
castle. i started walking very fast despite my 'sticky' legs and looking
down at the ground when i noticed that the painted steel floor was slightlty
discolored in along strip down the left side and around the corner that
i was heading towards like it was rusting, all orangy brown. just before
i rounded the corner where i could already hear what i hoped where my friends
whispering i saw something for a split second that i will never forget.
i stopped and followed the orangy-brown smear with my eyes to the very
corner it dissapered around when i swear i heard a sound like some coughing
up muccus or something is the only way i can describe it right by my right
ear. i looked right really fst just in time to see a thick brown mass dissapper
around the corner. when i rounded the corner i asked my friends if they
had seen anything and they said that the lights went out for a while and
they heard gurgleing and scratching sounds around the corner while i was
gone. needless to say all our hair was standing on end and we got the hell
out of that hall.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Rental in Rural Philly</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: robert.j.rhodes1@navy.mil</b><b></b>
<p><b>This happened to my wife and I few years back while renting a home
in rural Philadelphia. We rented an older modular home that was very nice.
It was warm and cozy for the most part until about 3 months after being
there. That is when it started getting wierd. First my wife and I were
watching tv one evening in the living room with a fire going.</b>
<br><b>I was on the couch and my wife sitting on the floor next to my legs
when she asked what was wrong with out dog Romeo, a small loving cocker
spaniel. I asked why, she said that he was acting wierd, when I asked her
how she said didn't you just see him? She had seen him jump off the couch
and cross the room and was staring down the hall. I asked her what she
was talking about, my dog was sleeping on the couch and had never moved.
Second, I had always had an wierd feeling any time I entered the second
bedroom which we used for storage. Whenever I went in there the closet
door was always open.</b>
<br><b>I had even placed some boxes in front of the door just to make sure,
but next time I entered sure enough the door would be open. I had mentioned
this to guys from work. Three of us had decided to do some investigating
and planned to spend the night in the room with some cameras and video
equipment. Two nights before our planned sleepover I awoke with my wife
screaming and jumping over me onto the floor on my side of the bed. When
I finally got her calmed down she said she had woke up and when she opened
her eyes she saw an older man in overalls staring at her, he told her not
to let us spend the night in that room, it was "his room".&nbsp; Needless
to say we stayed out of that room and I only went in there when I absolutely
had to and was quick to exit. We moved away and I have never heard if the
new tenant had the same problem.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Next Chapter...</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: nicole197698@juno.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Well y'all it's been a while since I last wrote to you about MY ghosts.</b>
<br><b>John is still here protecting me, little Bobby is still here protecting</b>
<br><b>my youngest son and there are still plenty more ghosts that have
yet to</b>
<br><b>be identified in terms of names. As some of you know, i have 5 portals
in</b>
<br><b>my house, the closet door being 1, my sister, a medium #2, my wall
of</b>
<br><b>mirrors #3 and 2 more to yet to be identified. Lately we can hear
the</b>
<br><b>ghosts in the closet walking around bumping into things inside,
the</b>
<br><b>reason i know is because the closet is packed full of my sister's
stuff</b>
<br><b>and that's what they are walking on. They still come out whenever
the</b>
<br><b>closet door is opened, the gate keeper isn't doing a good job though,</b>
<br><b>he's at least kept some evil ones out of the house however when
you live</b>
<br><b>with a satanist it isn't always easy keeping the evil ones away.
Charles,</b>
<br><b>my sister's gargoyle type protector still lives with us and wanders</b>
<br><b>freely around the house instead of just in the bedroom.</b>
<br><b>The most recent events have become very strange and mysterious if
i must</b>
<br><b>say so myself, now i have seen and heard a lot of weird things going
on</b>
<br><b>in my house but this one took the cake. I have a series of medications</b>
<br><b>that i have to take on a daily basis for different health problems,
well</b>
<br><b>about a week or so ago, on a Sunday, i went to get my meads to put
them</b>
<br><b>in my daily reminder box which are marked Sun through Sat.</b>
<br><b>When i went to get them off the kitchen counter, they were gone,
every</b>
<br><b>single last one and there were about 6 medications along with 2
in boxes</b>
<br><b>instead of bottles, all in a pharmacy bag so they wouldn't get lost.
The</b>
<br><b>entire bag was missing, now, i PERSONALLY went thru and destroyed
my</b>
<br><b>entire house looking for these medications, looking in every nook,</b>
<br><b>cabinet, drawer, corner, every possible place in the house...NO
SUCH</b>
<br><b>LUCK!!! I went through 2 days of withdrawls, the first day wasn't
too</b>
<br><b>bad, but by the second day, i could feel the effects of withdrawal
and</b>
<br><b>they weren't pretty, by the 3rd day if you so much as said a word
to me,</b>
<br><b>i went off. Needless to say every last ghost in my house stayed
away from</b>
<br><b>me. These pills are all missing still to this day. I've asked for
them</b>
<br><b>back, I've demanded for them back, I've called reinforcements and
they</b>
<br><b>suggest that it might be fairies that have taken them seeing as
how they</b>
<br><b>are mischievous little things anyway and like shiny, rattling things.
So</b>
<br><b>they told me to get a bag of skittles and tell the fairies that
i have</b>
<br><b>some goodies or pretty beads for them if they will replace the item(such</b>
<br><b>as in my case, the pills), well i must have done something wrong
B/c the</b>
<br><b>skittles are still there and no pills. Now, I assumed that i was
to lay</b>
<br><b>the skittles out on a plate for them to take, which would make sense
to</b>
<br><b>common man, so maybe i just need to get a bag, leave it unopened
and see</b>
<br><b>if i get the pills back that way. I've known about having fairies
in my</b>
<br><b>house for a while now, every once in a while i can catch a quick
glimpse</b>
<br><b>of one fluttering their wings, especially when I'm just falling
asleep, i</b>
<br><b>can see their light thru my eyelids as they crowd around my face
to make</b>
<br><b>sure I'm asleep before, I'm sure, doing something else or taking</b>
<br><b>something else that they shouldn't have. I ended up having to get
all my</b>
<br><b>medications refilled and still ended up getting some new ones too.
It's</b>
<br><b>very difficult to say for sure who took my medications, i just wish
they</b>
<br><b>would replace them, there are a few medications that i still need
that i</b>
<br><b>haven't been able to get.</b>
<br><b>My next step is to try to get a psychic to come into the house and
try to</b>
<br><b>get my ghosts to talk, to try to find out why my house is so popular
for</b>
<br><b>these spirits, bypassing the fact that i live on a cemetery that
was here</b>
<br><b>before 1836 when Houston was founded, it was an Indian graveyard
back</b>
<br><b>then but for some reason they all come to my house, even those who
have</b>
<br><b>died as recently as the past 3 1/2 years. I would like a lot of
them to</b>
<br><b>cross over because quite frankly they are noisy, they fight too
much and</b>
<br><b>they don't' do anything around the house except make things disappear,</b>
<br><b>move things, moan and talk. I love ghosts as much as the next person
and</b>
<br><b>i even have a great relationship with mine, however, they are getting
on</b>
<br><b>my nerves.</b>
<br><b>So anyway, that's my newest chapter in my Ghost Saga.</b>
<br><b>Until Next Time, Happy Haunting,</b>

<p><b>Never Mentioned</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jackie@taylor14571.fsnet.co.uk</b><b></b>
<p><b>my name is chelsea and my best friends name is amy one day me and
amy where at her house her mum just popped out to tesco to do the shopping
me and amy sat down in the living room when amy saw a tall looking man
wearing a blue suit walk down the garden path amy didnt know who this man
was she felt a bit concerned so she got up and looked out of the window
she turned round to me i looked at her and she was all pale and cold she

<p><b>My Submission</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: darren@evered85.freeserve.co.uk</b><b></b>
<p><b>I’ve finally been motivated into writing these events down after
trying to study the haunted history of Rodley, the village I live in. I
emailed Shadowlands after finding a comment on your haunted places list
that stated "England - Leeds - Rodley - Many apparitions seems to haunt
the area." and I received a very nice reply from Tina Carlson stating that
I should use the message board to post my own stories and ask for help.
Here we are though I’m afraid no one will be switching the hall lights
on after reading this as they are relatively boring and I also apologise
for the length but I felt I had to add a sense of realism.</b>
<br><b>The house we moved into seven and a half years ago was built in
the 30’s, although our vendor suggested otherwise, and has no historical
value as far as we can tell. I think we’re the third family to live in
it and we’re not sure if anyone had died in it but we do know, from stuff
found in the loft, that the old woman that our vendors bought the house
from was into local politics. We have found electoral registers from the
turn of the century and a collection of old books in various states of
repair.</b>
<br><b>At first nothing unusual happened but this can easily be put down
to the fact that we had to wait so long for the previous family to move
out that there were only two weeks before our first born was due and this
time was taken up with frantic painting, hanging, laying, stripping and
lugging.</b>
<br><b>Some unspecific time later (maybe a year or so) we started to notice
odd things, the sort of things that you would ignore if they didn’t repeat
themselves regularly and to be honest we’ve forgotten most of them but
one sticks in my mind.</b>
<br><b>It was Autumn and I was stood next to the Georgian door that leads
to our living room talking to my partner who was at the top of the stairs
that are opposite the door, running parallel to it. I was drawn to a tapping
sound that was coming seemingly from one of the panes just below head height
(I am exactly six feet tall). The door was shut and my initial reaction
was that it was vibrating in the door frame due to air pressure difference
or a nearby vehicle but when I put my ear to the glass it became clear
that the sound was as a result of something physically touching the pane
every second or so. This went on for a minute or so until I called my partner
and asked her to come down and listen to it. The instant her foot hit the
top step the sound stopped and did not return.</b>
<br><b>This in it’s self would not go down in the annals and paranormal
lore but it was a taster for a couple of the more interesting events that
would follow.</b>
<br><b>A year or so later I was re-reading (for about the eighth time)
the Dune series by Frank Herbert and I was becoming a little puzzled by
the fact that the one I was reading had been missing for a few days and
no amount of searching had born fruit. One sunny day my partner and I were
downstairs and my son Luc was upstairs on his own, probably bouncing on
our bed when prompted my some of the minor events that were happening at
the time I decided that I’d use an idea I’d recently read in a book. Apparently
if you have this kind of thing happen regularly asking for the missing
item can result in it being returned so I explained what I was going to
do to my partner and said aloud "can I have my book back please". Smiling
to herself she plodded upstairs and, after being up there for a few seconds,
shouted my name down with that edge to her voice that suggested that she’d
gone looking for a shoe and found a four hundred year old watermelon instead.</b>
<br><b>I ran upstairs and found in plain sight my book laying on the ottoman
and the foot of our bed. Obviously I quizzed my partner but she swore blind
that it was there when she entered the room and has kept to this story
to this day. The only other person left was my son who was stood nearby
clearly bewildered by the events surrounding him but I decided, wisely,
that interrogating a two year old was not going to make a good read if
I ever decided to record this story. Nevertheless I calmly asked him if
he’d seen the book put there and he nodded. I asked where it can from and
he pointed to the ceiling directly above the book. Odd as it seems this
is exactly the kind of thing I’d been reading about when the subject of
asking for the book crept into my memory. This has never been explained
to my satisfaction as Luc was, and still isn’t, the kind of boy that plays
practical jokes. He loses thing on a regular basis but never finds them.
That’s our job.</b>
<br><b>Another peculiar thing actually happened to my partner while I was
at work. She was defrosting the fridge and had taken the salad tray out
and put it on the draining board full of water and Dettox. She’s gone upstairs
to potter or some such thing and when she returned the tray was empty,
upside down and lying in the sink. The only other person in the house at
the time was Luc and he was asleep.</b>
<br><b>We later went through a period of time where strange things were
becoming common so armed with a CCTV camera, about forty feet of cable
and a three hour blank video tape I decided to catch the blighter in the
act, if you like. The camera was put on top of the TV and held in place
by some blu-tac to stop the weight of the cable pulling it down. The VCR
was set to long play and everything seemed to be in order so I left the
room with the lights dim.</b>
<br><b>The next day I had the unenviable task of sitting and viewing six
hours of relentless grey inaction but I had an unexpected surprise when
I found that the camera also recorded sound so I’d doubled my chances of
catching something. After a few minutes it became obvious that I hadn’t
the mental discipline to watch the whole tape so I skipped forward for
a while and, to my surprise, heard loads of loud knocks and bangs. The
most impressive of these was the sound of something knocking in to the
camera. It was exactly the same as someone knocking a naked microphone.
This sound repeated itself when I repeated the experiment upstairs the
following week.</b>
<br><b>Apart from my partner being very wary of the landing some of the
other things that have happened recently include me waking up to see a
shape looming over my sleeping partner and a similar shape moving past
the bottom of the bed. We’ve been woken in the middle of the night petrified
thinking we’ve been burgled again only to run downstairs and find a DVD
in the middle of the floor with absolutely no explanation as to how it
got there. Things disappear frequently, in fact I kept a log of these incidents
but that vanished as well.</b>
<br><b>We’ve come home from a night out and my partner has seen a man shaped
silhouette at the top of the stairs facing to front door. She later had
me stand in place to test the scale and as far as she could tell it could
have been me.</b>
<br><b>One of the most impressive things that I’ve ever happened to me
witnessed happened about ten years ago when we were stopping at my partners
parents house which is a seventeenth century weavers cottage. Ruth was
always frightened of the landing there (see a pattern appearing here?)
so when she went to the toilet, which is at the other side of the landing,
she’d rush back to the bedroom. On this occasion she’d gone through the
same routine and closed the door behind her and taken a couple of steps
when there was an almighty bang on the door. Needless to say she covered
the short distance between the door and the bed at a velocity that would
have made Einstein wince. We tried to replicate the noise by seeing if
the latch clicking into place and a few other things but the only one that
came close was as if someone had hit the door about three quarters of the
way up, hard with the palm of the hand.</b>
<br><b>Whilst at the same house we came home one night after an evening
with friends and parked the car at the top of what is a short private road
right outside the house. My partner got out and left me to apply the steering
lock and secure the car while she proceeded to the front door to unlock
it. I caught up with her a few seconds later to find that her mum was at
the bottom of the stairs rattling the keys in the lock. This wouldn’t have
been in any was unusual but for the expression on Ruth’s face. She later
said that she was rummaging around in her bag looking for her door keys
when the lace curtain on the inside lifted up as if someone was looking
out to see who was outside. She assumed, not unreasonably, that this was
her mum who’d been waiting for us but this was shattered when the upstairs
landing light cane on and her mothers silhouette could be clearly seen
descending the stairs so whoever lifted the curtains wasn’t her mum. We’ve
since discussed this and Ruth’s convinced that the movement of the lace
wasn’t as a result of a draught or anything like that as it was deliberate
and familiar, so much so that she misidentified it as someone in the house.</b>
<br><b>A few other things happened in that house but aren’t worthy of being
reported here. I also do have a number of orb photo’s if anyone’s interested
though, personally, I pay them little credence.</b>
<br><b>All the things stated in this email are as they happened and have
not been embellished in any way. I would also like to state that I am as
psychically gifted as a tractor with a flat tyre and I don’t have a record
of mental illness</b>
