<p class="MsoBodyText">Maude's Grave in Sterling/Voluntown, CT<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">By: jacobkharman@gmail.com<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I am a lifelong resident of Voluntown CT. I
wanted to give
you some <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">information regarding two places of interest
where I've
had experiences, both of which have been less than pleasant. The first
is
Maude's Grave.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The last time my friends and I, a total of four
people,
went looking for Maude's grave was in 2009 or 2010. We were all 19 or
20 and
have all had paranormal exposure, and we wanted to see what was at
Maude's. We
went and parked in the turnoff located in Hell's Hallow. I had a <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">pendulum, one friend had a voice recorder, and
we all had
flashlights.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I would ask the pendulum in which direction to
go. After
about 20 minutes, we all got a horrible feeling. I asked the pendulum
is maude
was near, it said no. I than asked if we should leave, and it gave me
the
biggest yes I've ever seen. We all turned and left. We stopped about
fifteen
feet before the exit of the wooded area, as a car was driving by and we
didn't
want anyone to see us. Than, a large tree branch<span style="">&nbsp; </span>fell
down, than swung out across at us. Had
we not stopped and waited for the car to drive by, that branch would
have hit
all of us.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">So if someone does choose to go there, please
advise them
to proceed with caution. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The second place I would like to mention isn't
listed on
the site yet. It is located in Canterbury, CT The house is abandoned
and has
been for several years. I've had a few strange experiences here. The
first time
I heard this place was haunted, I drove by. I wasn't sure which house
it was, I
was just told around where it was. When I saw the house, my entire body
froze.
I couldn't hit the gas or brakes on my car, until my car drifted pass
the
house. The next time I drove by, I brought my friend with me. My car
stalled,
which it had never done before, and she started shaking her head.
Again, as
soon as we passed the house, my car started up and we drove off. She
said she
was overwhelmed by a feeling of dread.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Another group of friends and I went in during
the day. I
have pictures, one of which has a very interesting face in the photo.
There was
also a small stair well with a book open to the title page. The name of
the
book was 'Final Scream'. It was creepy, to say the least. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I just wanted to give people a word of caution
about those
two places.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">My True Halloween Story<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">By: <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Sschimmel8@aol.com<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As so many other people have stated from their
experiences
and stories shared&#8230;..I too grew up experiencing paranormal activity and
spiritual energies on an everyday basis, which made co-existing with
the
paranormal an easily accepted part of who and what I am today. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">One
experience that really stands out in my memory was a Halloween day I
experienced a little over thirty years ago.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I still to this day find myself gravitating ready incase the
experience
repeats itself in the hopes to consciously and with wide-awake logic
are able
to discern and document the event as it is occurring.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I worked 3rd shift at a nearby hospital and
would sleep from mid afternoon until approximately 9:30 pm in the
evening,
where I would get ready and report for duty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was before I was married and I lived alone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had recently moved into a new apartment
building that backed up to an embankment and winding creek.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>My apartment balcony hovered for what seemed
like thirty feet over the embankment and the heavy pine trees and
landscaping
gave the appearance of a nice and secluded park.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
had been rainy that afternoon and
evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Leaves really beginning to drop
and blow mysteriously in the gusty wind and rain, helping to set an
eerie
atmosphere for the Halloween holiday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
did not have a lot of furniture at the time and I had made canopy swags
with
designer sheets that were on brass curtain rods that I had extended
parallel
from the headboard of my bed following the length of the bed.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>These rods were placed in hooks that I had
mounted in the ceiling and the rods allowed the designer sheets to flow
down
and be swaged back with ties to the wall behind the headboard.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>My budget was on a dime but a little
innovation on my part was proving to help me to give color and life to
the bare
apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, it was mid-afternoon
and time for me to lie down for sleep, to rest before my upcoming shift
at
work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The weather being rainy and cool
still was not drastic enough for me to turn on my furnace for the first
time in
the fall, so I added an extra blanket to snuggle down with and found
myself
quickly in a deep and restful sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
am not sure of the exact time when I became aware of a presence close
to
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could tell the sun had set and
that it was dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wind was howling,
mixed with rain as I could hear leaves being blown in the mix pushing
their way
against the apartment building and windows, but it was sensing the
presence of
a strong energy just inches from my face that had me into an immediate
alert
state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The presence was so strong that
the hair was standing up on my arms and body and I first thought that
it was
where a human had broken into my apartment and was standing over me.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried to keep my breathing slow and steady,
as though I were still asleep and also to keep my eye lids shut smooth
to
simulate the same, so that who ever it was would not know I was awake.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>It was too late to run, since the presence
was just inches from my face, so I guess I thought if I played opossum
that I
would have a better chance of survival.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I lay there for several long moments and did not hear movement
of what I
thought was a human intruder in my room, but the home made canopy
curtains
began to flap in a freezing cold breeze.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The air was cold and blowing in an apartment that had no open
windows&#8230;.and where the furnace had not even been activated yet for the
fall
weather.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Laying for what seemed an
eternity, but in actuality were only several moments, I finally braved
enough
courage to slit one eye open to see if I could see what was still very
close to
my bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I opened my eye, I could not
see anything at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Braving a bit more
courage I opened up the second eye and still could not see anyone in
the room
with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sat up in bed looking out
towards the hallway, for I seemed to detect faint noise just outside
the
bedroom, when all of a sudden I heard what sounded like a female voice
call my
name, &#8220;Sharon&#8221;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The voice sounded
somewhat familiar to me and I followed the voice out into the apartment
answering the voice, &#8220;Yes, it is me, who is this?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The voice would call out my name in almost a
sing-song pattern and led me to the front doorway that led out to the
main
hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the voice was on the
opposite side of the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I opened up
the door, still trying to answer the voice that. &#8220;&#8230; Yes, I am Sharon
and that I
am here&#8221;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no one in the
hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stood there perplexed over
the experience and then all of a sudden the female gendered voice was
directly
behind me, again, calling out my name. I slammed the door shut and
whirled
around to see who and what was calling my name and again there was
nothing to
be seen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought of my grandmother,
that lived with my parents and she had not been feeling well
recently&#8230;so I ran
to the phone and called home to check and see if she and my parents
were
okay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother answered the phone and
stated that everyone and everything were fine, that I must have been
having a
bad dream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could not relate the
experience to the degree that I had just encountered to the point where
mom
would understand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was reassuring me
to go back to bed and try to get more sleep before my alarm would go
off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After hanging up the phone with her I
could
feel the apartment air temperature returning back to normal and
thoroughly
checking out the apartment for myself, at that point, I could see that
everything was secure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could not find
anything out of place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Calming myself I
lie back down and tried to get more sleep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Surprisingly enough I was able to go into another good and deep
sleep
and yes&#8230;you guessed it, the same occurrence I experienced earlier in
the
evening repeated itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I cannot stress
enough here how shocking it is when you find yourself awakened by a
presence
being mere inches from your face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
automatically think of a human intruder.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again the hair on my body was standing up on end and my body was
covered
in goose-flesh.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The curtains were
blowing gently in the frigid cold that again had manifested in the
bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time I braved a peek out
into the room, and again I could see no one standing, but then the
female voice
called out my name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time I jumped
out of bed and shouted, &#8220;Who IS this?&#8221;.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again the voice went towards the front entrance door&#8230;and again I
followed it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A repeat experience of the
voice calling my name on the opposite side of the door happened and
upon
opening the door, again I could find no one there.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The voice all of a sudden was behind me as I
slammed the front entrance door shut and it traveled over to my balcony
door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I followed it and flung open the
sliding door
and followed the voice as it went out the balcony, but it did not stop
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It flowed over the balcony and
down the thirty-foot embankment and wound its way up the deep creek,
while all
the time still doing the sing-song calling of my name as it faded out.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Freaking out I turned all lights on in the
apartment and just stayed awake the rest of the time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I even went ahead and dressed for work and
arrived extra early because I needed to be with live people.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I had friends with our Emergency Room/Trauma
department and stopped there first, talking with my friends and fellow
staff
members, relating my strange encounter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My friends could tell that I had been shaken to the core by the
experience and while none of them could explain what happened, they
truly
believed that I had experienced something extraordinary.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I am sure some of my co-workers thought that
I had just been dreaming the events and kind of shrugged off the story
as a
spooky Halloween event that had made its mark on me.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A couple of hours into my shift, the head
nurse from the Emergency Room paged me and asked me to come to her
department,
when possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was able to break from
my work and went to see what she needed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The city&#8217;s Fire Department Paramedics had just brought in a new
female
patient, who was in her early sixty years of age, who was well known,
respected
and affluent person in our community.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Apparently this woman had been awakened by a female voice that
sing-sung
her voice to the front door of her home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was home alone at the time&#8230;.her husband was out of town on
business
at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As with my experience, the
woman had been drawn to her front door and opened it, hoping to see who
it was
that was calling out her name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And upon
answering the door she found no one there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Immediately the voice was directly behind her and she whirled
around to
see who it was and again she found no one there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
voice wound its way through her mansion
towards the back of the house and she followed it to one of her
multiple exits
leading out to the back of her house. The voice beckoned from outside
of the
doorway threshold that she was at, still using that sing-song type of
voice to
urge her to follow it&#8230;and like myself&#8230;she stopped following the voice
as it
wound its way off the porch and out past her pool and yard.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She had become so frightened that
she
started experiencing chest pains and shortness of breath and she ended
up
calling 911 in the fear of her fainting from the fear and pain she was
experiencing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once the Paramedics
arrived and started assessing her, she tried over and over to relate
her
experience to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like some of my
co-workers and friends, they were skeptical of her experience and were
just
chalking it up to the fact that the poor women had been dreaming<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>This woman suffered congestive heart failure
and had to be admitted to our Intensive Coronary Care Unit, for over a
week and
be treated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She stayed adamant of the
truth of her experience&#8230;.and I for ne believed her, for I had
personally had a
close up and personal experience similar to hers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thankfully
she did not let some people&#8217;s
skepticism affect her self-truth of what she had experienced for
herself. The
story of the women&#8217;s encounter spread throughout the hospital, for the
woman
being so well known and respected was telling her experience to any and
all
that would listen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My fellow
co-workers&#8230;.while some of them may not believe in the spiritual realms
as being
a co-existing force along with our human experience, at least in my
opinion, they
could not explain away what had happened. We humans are
multi-dimensional
beings that have so much a part of who and what we are crossing through
the
different levels of dimensions throughout our lives.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So no wonder we experience so many incredible
adventures and are able to see and interact with other human and
non-human
creations out there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If we deny the
ability to do so, then we will only be able to view life as black and
white,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>from our self-created box that
does not allow what we deem as acceptable or ordinary to co-exist with.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>If we are more open minded and are given the
gift and acknowledgement of other co-existing dimensions and
planes&#8230;along with
other intelligent and interactive energies out in the world, then our
worlds
become greatly expanded. Some great minds that were open to these
concepts,
such as Albert Einstein and Edgar Cayce were open minded and greatly
inspired
by these and made it their life&#8217;s work to be able to document the
reality
behind the theory. You will usually find that when a person denies the
paranormal realms of existence, there is nothing to be done to sway
their
opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But that is fine, for each one
of us needs to have our beliefs honored and we absolutely have the
right to
have those beliefs&#8230;what ever they are.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
know from my own personal experience the truth of what it was I had
experienced, for I lived it for myself and still feel the anticipation
of each
Halloween that comes, in the hope of experiencing it again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">This
wasn't my first experience with the Paranormal, but it was the first
time I saw
an apparition.My grandma and I were very close, she was close with my
other
siblings as well because she and my grandfather basically raised us
until we
were pre-teens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When my grandfather
passed I was distraught but after a few years the pain ebbed, and then
in 2008
my grandmother passed away, and I was inconsolable. I was depressed
when my
grandfather passed but it wasn&#8217;t as bad because I still had my
grandmother so I
was mildly okay, when she died too it was horrible for me. That is just
a
general summary so you can get the idea of how much I was bonded with
them. Anyways,
my grandmother passed away and it had been about a Month since her
death when I
had the scariest and yet interesting experience of my young life, so
far I
should say. I was still horridly depressed about everything so my
emotions were
very very high. My twin sister (fraternal) and I were laying in our
bedroom
that we shared and the night was passing us by. We couldn&#8217;t sleep and
finally
decided to go sleep in the living room. We grabbed our blankets and
pillows,
got our small Chihuahua/terrier mix to get up and walked to the living
room on
the other side of the house. My twin took the couch while I spread out
a bed on
the floor right next to it. Before we had laid down we turned on the
light over
the oven so there was a soft light keeping where we were sleeping from
being
completely black from the night. I laid on the floor in my makeshift
bed with
my eyes closed for awhile, I did not at any time fall asleep because I
wasn&#8217;t
tired and it is hard for me to get to sleep at night, I was laying on
my back
with my Chihuahua/terrier curled up by me. My twin was already asleep
at that
point and I was just laying there with my mind wandering. Suddenly I
noticed a
&#8216;weirdness&#8217; to the air, the best way I can explain it is that it had an
electric or static like feel to it, and somewhat of a heaviness but not
a huge
amount, the electric/static feel was really powerful and seemed to get
more
powerful as I noticed it. I opened my eyes and was staring up at the
ceiling, I
sat up and turned my head and top of my body to look to the left of me
towards
the sliding doors that had our washer and dryer behind them. I could
see
everything perfectly well because we had a light on so the living room
wasn&#8217;t
really dark. When I looked to the left that was when I saw a small
girl, she
was like a shadow in the way that she was all black like a shadow but I
could make
out that she had long hair and bows on her head, plus her shoulder area
was
rounded and puffed like she had on puffy sleeves. I also knew she was a
girl
because right when I looked at her I automatically had the thought she
was a
girl. The electric/static feel seemed to smother me at this point, I
felt
paralyzed as I stared at her, from the way she looked I would guess she
was
about 6 maybe 7 years old. I stared at her and she stared at me or I
assume she
was staring because I couldn&#8217;t see eyes but she was facing me. I felt
like I
was made of stone, I was in this awkward position with the top of my
body
turned so I could look left and my knee lifted because I was going to
stand up.
I believe I stared for about a minute when an overpowering wave of fear
came
over me as it finally connected on what I was looking at. I couldn&#8217;t
move my
limbs or straighten my body out so I finally just tipped myself onto my
side
and at the moment I broke eye contact I could move enough to cover my
head with
a blanket.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I laid underneath my
blanket I began calling for my sister, loudly. I repeated her named
like
&#8220;Hannah, Hannah, Hannah&#8221; and as I said it my voice got more urgent and
scared
sounding. Suddenly she began to move and replied with a groggy &#8220;What?&#8221;
but I
was too afraid to answer at that point. I remained underneath the
blanket ALL
night, too afraid to peek out to see if it was still there. Finally I
fell
asleep after awhile and woke up the next morning with the blanket still
over my
head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When my sister and I got up that
morning I told her what happened and she replied &#8220;I was wondering why
you were
calling my name and then didn&#8217;t answer when I replied to you.&#8221;<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>So what happened wasn&#8217;t a dream which is
something I already knew but I like to point it out when I tell people
what
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t know who the girl was,
she didn&#8217;t try any way to communicate and I was too frightened to say
anything,
it was the first time I had ever seen her and I haven&#8217;t seen her since.
I
believe the state of mind I was in, that being really high emotions and
sadness, might have been what helped draw her to me or atleast helped
me see
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

 style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">I
included this incident in a fiction book that I wrote, however, it is a
true
incident that I experienced myself. I was a nurse on the oncology floor
at my
local hospital on the night shift.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
had a patient who was in the process of what is termed "actively
dying."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This means that the patient
is in the final stages of dying and is not expected to live more than
24
hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are typically comatose at
this point and heavily sedated for pain.As usual, this man's family was
present
at his bedside and had been for nearly a full day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The nurse who was in charge of his care was
very conscientious, but fairly new on the cancer ward.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At one point she checked his vital signs and
general appearance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Noting an
improvement in his condition, she suggested that the family go home and
rest
for a while.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They lived several hours
away and were exhausted, so they jumped at the chance to shower and
rest at
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, it is very typical
of oncology patients to rally just a few hours before death, and this
nurse
wasn&#8217;t familiar with this fact. The family left and the patient died
about an
hour after they had gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The poor nurse
was devastated at her mistake, but dutifully called the family and told
them
that they needed to return immediately.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Of course, it took them another hour to get back. About 5
minutes after
his death, the nursing call-light lit up in his room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then the light in the room next door lit up
and so on up the entire hall toward the east.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This took just about the amount of time that it would have taken
someone
to walk into each room and pull the light cord.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then the light across the hall to the north came on.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Once again this took just about the amount of
time that it would have taken someone to walk across the hall and enter
that
room to pull on the call-light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
that, the lights started coming on back down the entire length of that
side of
the hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You guessed it, just about the
amount of time it would have taken for someone to walk into each room
and pull
the chain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, there was a short
pause and then the light across the hall came on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
that, they each came on successively up
the rest of that side until the circle was completed and they came back
to
where it had all begun, at the dead man&#8217;s room.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Now every nursing call-light on the wing was
lit, even in the empty rooms. We nurses were just about to get up to
check on
our patients when our resident prankster walked up to the nursing
station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Realizing that he hadn&#8217;t been
there when the
lights had done their stunt, we all accused him of being the culprit.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>He adamantly denied it, so we each went to
check on our patients, turning off their lights and those in the
adjacent rooms
that were empty. About 10 minutes later, the lights all came on again.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>It happened exactly the same way, one at a
time in succession until every light on the ward was on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It started in the deceased man&#8217;s room and
circled back there again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time, our
prankster nurse was sitting next to me, so we knew he hadn&#8217;t done it.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Once again, we all went to turn off the
lights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The charge nurse called building
maintenance and they sent a technician to check out the light system.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, he found no problem with it and
left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 5 minutes after that, the
lights did their thing again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By this
point we were all starting to half-jokingly speculate about the
deceased man&#8217;s
ghost playing pranks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one wanted to
admit that it might be true, but obviously, everyone was thinking it.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>At<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>last, the family returned, the funeral home was contacted and
the body
was removed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We all figured the problem
would end then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But we were wrong.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The lights did their thing once again.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>This time, after checking my patients and
turning out their lights, I went to the dead man&#8217;s room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The body was gone, but the room had not yet
been cleaned and prepared for a new patient.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I stood there and talked to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I told him that I was sorry his family hadn&#8217;t been present and
that the
nurse had made the mistake of sending them home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
told him that she regretted her mistake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
also asked him to quit messing with the
lights because it was compromising our ability to care for the other
patients.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I then prayed for peace for
his soul and left the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lights
did not come back on again after that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
can&#8217;t swear this was a ghost because I never saw, heard or felt
anything
strange in the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just observed the
situation with the lights as it started immediately after his death and
stopped
immediately after I talked to his spirit and prayed for his peace.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

about 1966 or so, my little sister was crying in the middle of the
night
because she said she saw a lady standing by her bed. We couldn't seem
to settle
her down, because she was trying to convince us that she really saw
someone
standing there, although me and my other sister who were sleeping in
the same
room never saw or heard anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About
a decade later I was reading a book about apparitions on Long Island
and many
of them were reports of Native American apparitions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My sister had never described the lady
before, but I knew that Rockaway was named after an Indian tribe.<span

I asked my sister if she could describe the lady all those years later.<span

standing by my bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had long, black
braids, and she was smiling."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is my father&#8217;s account when he was a child, and was experienced by him,
his
parents, his siblings, aunts and uncles as well who lived there. I am
not sure
that the building is occupied now. Apartment located at 60th ST below
the D
train, by train station stairway. 1 child died, ate rat poison. A lady
came out
of her apt naked, screaming &amp; bleeding into the street she use to
live
alone, kept the apt for awhile without staying in there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Two people went crazy in there, talking in a
strange language. They had to leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
saw dark shadows of a tall male.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hearing
steps around the living room and around the bedroom. The door was
always being
played with late at night, scratching on the main door plus turning on
the
knob, like someone waiting to come in. There was always negative stuff
attracted toward the building. One time we were playing in the hallway
and a
guy came in from the street with a knife, but with the screaming from
all of us
he left quickly. Another time a guy was looking around in from the
front of the
building and it looked like he was attaching a bomb to the step of the
train
station stairway, then when he saw us he left running. Many times there
were
deaths from the front of the building on the train platform from people
falling
or pushed off onto the train tracks and being killed and their body
parts were
into many pieces. All negative things happened there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">We
moved to our farm in Oklahoma in 2007. Early one morning, I was out
walking and
exploring. The place was a bit overgrown at the time. I caught a quick
glimpse
of a woman kneeling by a thicket of wild roses. She appeared to be
kneeling
with her head bowed and her hands folded as if she was praying. She had
a shawl
around her shoulders. She disappeared after about 2 seconds. I went to
investigate and in the middle of the thicket, I found a large limestone
slab.
It looks like it was hand cut. There&#8217;s no writing on it. I got the
impression
that it&#8217;s an old grave. I&#8217;m not afraid of spirits, but I do treat them
with
respect. I laid wild flowers on the grave and I explained that I meant
no harm
and that I now live on and own the property. I caught a quick glimpse
of a
cowboy. He disappeared after about 2 seconds, just like the woman did.
That
night I dreamt of a horrible ranch accident where a man was seriously
injured.
I saw glimpses of a man being laid out on the ground and other men
trying in
vain to help him. I also got glimpses of a funeral and burial. I also
saw
images of the limestone slab. It was out in the open and not surrounded
by a
thicket of bushes and trees like it is now. The year 1910 came to mind
as I was
dreaming all of this. I&#8217;m trying to do research to find out if I can
back any
of this up with historical facts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">I
have had a bad to horrible relationship with my mother-in-law.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>It started early on before I even married her
son, my now husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would tell her
about me and about where we would go on our dates, and she would get
sour and
whinny and complain that no one takes her to those places. Then we get
married
and the inappropriate comments started to flow.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Things that you would think someone would have had <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">enough
common sense to not say, or thing that hust weren't true.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It got even worse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't make
heads or tails of her
behavior.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we had children it got even
worse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the kids were small they
refused to stay with her, but being a working mom I needed help.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally after causing so many problems and
becoming so unstable around my children, we cut off all communication
with
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was so sad but so necessary.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>She didn't appear so unstable, but it didn't
matter what anyone else thought, it was best for my kids.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After 19 years of marriage, One cold Feb.
morning when a family member couldn't get her to answer her door, she
found her
dead in her home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had been dead
about 3 days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She died in her
sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was even harder on me and my
family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We bought her home and so the
task of cleaning out her house and belongings was left to me.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>And this was eye opening.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It turns out she had been treated over the
years for severe mental illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
when she felt "better" she would quit taking her meds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That was when she would get unstable. She
would lock herself up in her house for days.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The neighbors knew to leave her alone till she came out, so it
wasn't
unusual that she was past on for days before someone would go check.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>You are probably wondering why we couldn't
have found out about her illness, you can thank the government for that.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Privacy issues.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
told my country bumkin S-I-L that
wouldn't be able to figure it out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
it worked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was a very upset with her
because she called the daily meds "her every now and then pills" for
when she "feels bad". But because S-I-L didn't have a clue I couldn't
get mad at her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have been visited
before by friends and family that have passed on. But I knew that MIL
was going
to have a hard time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My 17 yr old son
would come running into my room in the night freaked out because the
dog was
shaking, things moving in his room. I told him his Granny was worried
about him
and he needed to talk to her. Let her know that he loved her and that
he is
going to be OK. ( he was joining the military after graduation).<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>He was reluctant but got up and went back to
bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Right after he left through the
door, little sparkling lights twinkled over the place that he had been
at.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I spoke to her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My fear was that she wasn't crossed <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">over
and that her mental illness wouldn't be gone and like it should if she
crossed
over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't want a ghost version of
the crazy bad MIL!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So far it is
OK.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have had a touch lamp turn on when
I would speak to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My daughter is the
only one left at home with us and she sleeps in the same bed that her
Granny
slept and died in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She says it doesn't
bother her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She says that she is her
Granny's little granddaughter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The shame
about it is that this is the closest she could be to her Granny.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>She has had a few things happen, but she
knows that it's her Granny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

 style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">I
never see this listed in the well known haunting websites, but I have
on
independent sites. I lived behind a civil war ruin/memorial called the
LIBERIA
PLANTATION... its like the sister house of STONE HOUSE.. after doing
research... I found that not only were many massacred during the civil
war..
but even before the biggest battles took place... odd and unexplained
events
took place. In March 1862, three unknown corpses were found in the
basement. As
the civil war became more intense.. soldiers began to refer to the
Liberia
House as 'The Death House'.By the end of the civil war.. the amount of
bodies
on the property was massive. Since then, those who live and work around
the
area can hear strange sounds and shouting. The house was also struck by
lightning in 2003. Ever since moving into my house (directly behind the
Liberia
House).. everyone who visits or spends the night witness strange
unexplainable
things. Its become a long going joke in the neighborhood in the area
that the
house is possessed or infested by demons, lol. I guess my family
deserves it
though.. since we bought a house that plowed down a lot of the area
where many
people died and were buried. I wish that the LIBERIA PLANTATION wasn't
private
property (its only open for tours during a few days of the year)... I
would
love to get some paranormal equipment and take a look around. Anyway...
just
thought I would mention this place... hope any of this is useful.<span

is a string of apartments on Riverside Drive in Grundy VA that were
built in
the 1920's and still stand with little remodeling. In one apartment an
old dark
looking man stares out the window in the kitchen. This same man haunted
my
friend, her husband and her mother who came to stay a few nights.
Eventually
she and her husband had a baby and it could be seen staring off in to
the
distance at things that were not there and laughing when no one was in
the
room. Each of these apartments is a separate house they have a basement
and an
upstairs. In each apartment one floor is closed off and sealed for
storage
(nothing can get in). My friend's brother live next door in another
apartment
(I stayed there for a month). There were weird sounds coming from
upstairs and
in the walls at all times of day and night! I tried debunking it but
the
upstairs was sealed and locked plus on side of the apartment was built
into the
hill side! So there was absolutely no way anything could get there, it
was all

would spend every weekend at Grandma's. She lived in A duplex
apartment,the
kind that has two apartments with A wall dividing the two. well, that
evening
my Grandma was going somewhere, A church social I think, and my sister
and I
stayed next door at the neighbors apartment. About the time it was
getting
dark, we started hearing sounds coming from Grandma's place. there were
footsteps-heavy, doors opening and closing, the kitchen faucet turning
on and
off, and the toilet flushing. When we first heard these things, we
thought that
Grandma was back early, so we went next door to check, well, Grandma
was not
home, the doors were locked and the lights were off. We went back next
door and
continued to hear these noises until Grandma did get home A few hours
later. We
told her that someone had been in the house while she had been gone, so
she
searched carefully and could'nt find anything, there was nothing out of
place,
no sign that anyone had been there. I slept there that night and many
nights
before then and after and there were never any other times when that
happened.
I don't know what caused it, but I do know that there was no-one in
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

moved to another local town, so we didn't get to see him often. When my
estranged sister cristel, turned 18 she moved into our home, and my
other SIS
Connie and I were finally going to have the chance to form a real
family bond
with her.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But our time was cut short
when on November 28th, 1999 she and 3 close friends of hers were struck
by a
train. Sadly the driver was killed instantly, and one of the others
were
announced dead shortly after paramedics arrived on the scene, she was
life
flighted to a hospital where she passed away on the 4th of December. On
the day
of her funeral we had many people in our home, wile I was occupying a
younger
family member n my room he continued to ask where the cat was hiding,
but I
assured him we didn't have even a single pet. Later on as guests were
leaving
and the day was winding down, I went to my room, closing the door, to
be alone.
While laying in my bed in the dimming light of my Windows I heard a
cat. I
first thought it was a stray outside I was hearing, moments later I
felt my
blanket tug at the corner. I was a little afraid, but had to know what
it was.
I bent nervously over the side lifting the blanket to peer underneath.
First
there was nothing, then as I scanned from end to end of the dark space,
I saw
two green eyes glinting back at me. I dropped the blanket and ran for
my light
switch. My heart leaped n my chest when as the light came on the eyes
moved to
peer out, I was frozen for a few moments until slowly a black cat
crawled out.
I felt like an idiot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I put the cat out
after showing my mom. We cldnt keep it, she never really was a cat
person. The
following night the cat came from under my bed and climbed n with me.
Bewildered as to how it got back in, and a little startled, as I was
not
expecting it and was on the edge of sleep, I went to my mom, to ask if
she had
let it n after maybe changing her mind about keeping it. She said no
and put it
out herself. The same thing occurred the next night, but this time we
searched
for holes, open Windows, spaces a cat cld fit in through the floor,
ceilings,
walls, vents, u name it. But found nothing. Cluelessly we decided to
keep her.
She obviously had chosen not to allow us to be rid of her. She stayed n
my
room, and many times @ night I wld b staring @ the ceiling thinking
about
cristel, asking questions n my head, only to look @ the cat by my side,
starring at the same spot as me. Nothing more than that wld ever
happen, except
n the mornings she wld b gone, with no sign she was ever even there.
Only to
re-appear n my room @ night fall. We moved away from the town not long
after my
sister passed away, and to my disappointment we never saw her again. I
feel
like maybe she was there to help comfort me through that bad time.<span

situation? I would greatly appreciate any clarification, or explanation.</span><br>
