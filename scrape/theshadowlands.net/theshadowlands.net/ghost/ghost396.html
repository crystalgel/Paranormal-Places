<p class="MsoNormal">Freaky Dream Woman</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I have been enjoying visting The Shadowlands for three years
now, and fin<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y I have a story to
tell. </p>




<p class="MsoNormal">Recently I went on a trip to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Washington</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">State</st1:placetype></st1:place>
for vacation. Coming home we (My family and I) stayed at a motel in <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Wyoming</st1:place></st1:state>. </p>




<p class="MsoNormal">Well, that night I had a strange dream. In my dream, the
door to ourroom was shaking, like someone was trying to get in. After awhile,
the door opened. Standing in the doorway was a Native American woman. She had
long dark hair and almost black eyes. She glided over to my bed until she was
standing over me, and starting choking me. I blacked out in the dream, and woke
up. After awhile I drifted back to sleep. The next day, I just shrugged it off
and went to breakfast at the motel. I had just sat down for breakfast when the
cleaning lady came in..She was Native American and had long dark hair...She was
the woman from my dream! A shiver ran up my spine and the hairs on my neck stood
up. She just walked around tidying things up. At one point she turned her head
and looked at me. The look re<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y
creeped me out. Nevertheless, I got the heck out of there. I would like to add
that I had not seen this woman before my dream occured. Is this something like
Voodoo? or just coincidence? I'd appreciate your opinion</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">Thankyou,Keep up the goodwork on your site!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">First of all I have never told anyone this and I'm not sure
how to explain it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am 37 years old and
was born Oct.4,1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On Oct.1 of the
same year my first cousin was born.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
parents were excited because we were born so close together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was my aunt and uncles second child and I
am an only child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">Our first Christmas the family gathered at my grandmothers
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You see my aunt and uncle were
from out of town so we were all to be at gramdma's house on Christmas Eve.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we arrived, my mother realized that my
cousin and I even had on the same outfits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My mother said it made it sort of special after what happened.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">About 4 months later my aunt had went into the
hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My uncle, being at home with a
small child and a baby, put the baby in bed with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the night he rolled over on her and
smothered her to death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he awoke it
was too late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He called my grandmother
and all he could do was scream into the phone, "She's gone."</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">Having children myself I can only imagine the heart
ache.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The story has haunted me for years
but in a way I can not explain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">At about the age of 17 I started to realize that when I went
on vacations or on visited somewhere special I had a feeling inside of me I
couldn't explain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All I knew was for
some reason I would stand and stare and start to cry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being young, I tried to hide it at first and
then I began to wonder what was wrong with me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As I got older, I would try to really ask my self why was I feeling this
way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And one day I got an answer from
inside of me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That's the only way I know
how to explain where it came from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">I don't even remember where I was or what I was experiencing
at the time but I was getting emotional again and I heard a voice in my head
say,"Go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>See.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because I can't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Take me with
you."<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">I honestly believe that she is with me and all the things I
have experienced in my life she had been here with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would like to tell my mother but I'm not
sure she would understand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I always feel
her and I feel connected to her even though I never really knew her.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">I have taken the Riordan House tour only once but that is
not where I encountered the haunting.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">When the Riordan's lived in that mansion they had a rather
large garden not far from the house. Where that garden used to be now stands a
large entertainment superstore, Hastings Entertainment. Not too long ago I was
the assistant manager of this store. One night another associate and I braved
the attic to retrieve some DVD lock boxes. I was standing on the ladder with</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">half of my body inside of the attic, while my associate held
the ladder for me. I started to throw down some lock boxes when I suddenly
heard a little girl's voice. I stopped as I thought I was just hearing things.
My associate informed me at this moment I looked like I was about to vomit. I
took a deep breath and continued my duty. Then I heard it again, but this time
it was unmistakable. The little girl's voice said, "Get out!"</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">I was down that ladder faster than you could say,
"White as a ghost."</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">Because we had a duty to complete I had my associate climb
the ladder to retrieve the rest of the lock boxes. She positions herself just
as I had when suddenly both of us heard it again, "GET OUT!"</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">It was so loud I heard it from where I was standing below
the attic. She instantly said, "I'm out!" and shot down the ladder
just as fast as I had. </p>




<p class="MsoNormal">We exited the "stock room" and decided to make do
with what lock boxes we retrieved. Being paranormal enthusiests we discussed
what happened at great length. Of course when we told other employees most of
them stated, "I'm not going to encourage your quests for adventure."
What ever that means.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">This incident sparked my curiosity about the house. I had
heard <st1:city w:st="on">Hastings</st1:city> used to be the location of the
Riordan's garden but rumors tend to fly around <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Flagstaff</st1:place></st1:city> like undergarments at a Rolling
Stones concert. I decided to look into it by taking the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Riordan</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">Mansion</st1:placetype></st1:place>
tour and the tour guide confirmed the rumor. He stated that the garden is where
the daughters used to spend a lot of time. He also confirmed rumors of
hauntings in the mansion.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">Shortly after I took the tour I heard from a books
department associate at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Hastings</st1:city></st1:place>
that she heard the pitter patter of feet in that area at night when no one was
around but her. The books department is just below the attic where the lock
boxes are held. Months later a stocking associate went all the way up to the
attic and stood as he sorted through the lock boxes. He fell through the sheet
rock and barely missed injury. Perhaps the little girl was right for trying to
warn us?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When I was about four or five years old my sister and I were
spending the night with my grandmother who had just lost her husband three days
earlier. My sister and I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>slept in the
same room with our grandmother. In the middle of the night a sound woke me up,
it sounded like coffee percolating. So I got up to see what it was. I walk down
the hall from the bedroom to the kitchen and there he was sitting at the table
(her husband). It must not have bothered me because I sat down at the table
with him and carried on a conversation, I can't remember what we talked about
but at some time he got up and went and got a candy bar that we both must have
liked because he divided it in half and we sat at the table and ate it all
along<span style="">&nbsp; </span>still talking. My grandmother said
she woke up and heard me talking to someone but didn't know who it could have
been. In the mean time he had ask me to go and get her so I got up from the
table and walked down the hall to the bedroom door and told her that he wanted
to talk to her. She said he was dead and I replied<span style="">&nbsp; </span>no he's not, he's in the kitchen and I turned
to walk down the hall and he was standing at the end of it<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and said tell her I will see her later and
faded away.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Dream</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">By: Tystin@uga.edu</p>




<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">Hi, I wanted to share a story with you regarding ghost
contact through dreams. On June 1st, 2006, one of my best friends and
fraternity brothers passed away due to a sudden burst of capillaries in his
brain. My best friend and I, a great friend to him, found him in his room
without response after he had been complaining that evening of a horrible
headache. After calling 911 he went through two brain surgeries to save his
life but sadly the efforts failed. His death has been extremely hard on me. I
have been thinking alot about how good of a friend he was to me and whether or
not he knew it. It has really bothered me. This afternoon after class I took a
nap because I was exhausted from staying up late studying the night before. In
my dream I was in a hallway. I cannot decide whether it was a school or a
hospital, but in my dream I was aware that Richie was dead. </p>




<p class="MsoNormal">He appeared in the hallway to me and I remember being dumb
strucken and unable to speak. He appeared anxious at my difficulty and I
finally blurted out to him "I loved you and you were my second best
friend." He looked perplexed and said, "No. We were Brothers."
In his life, being fraternity brothers meant more to him than anything and he HATED
how many of us had "best friends." That is all I remember from the
dream. I really feel that Richie visited me in my dream to soothe my mind about
our friendship. We were Brothers and he was confirming that he knew what that
meant to both of us. I woke up in chills and in awe at what had happened during
my dream. I love your site and am happy to share my story with you. Thank you.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">hi, im 15 yrs old and when i was about 8 i saw somthing i
will never forget...</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">i was watch ing t.v with my younger sister, when my mum
called me from the kitchen to go and get my dinner, as i turned to go through
the doorway to the kitche i saw a boy roughly my age standing in the hall. the
thing is i could see straight through him. i was a bit freaked out and turned
to look at my sister to see if shed seen anything, but she just went straight
through to the kitchen so i turned around and the boy was gone. i thought
nothing of it and just figured i was seeing things.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">later that day my mum asked me to go and fetch something
from the upstairs bathroom, the bathroom was right next door to my bedroom and
as i walked by for some reason i looked into my bedroom and i saw the same
transparent boy standing in front of my dresser. i was really scared and
refused to go upstairs for the rest of the day. </p>




<p class="MsoNormal">i havent seen the boy since but sometimes i feel him about. </p>




<p class="MsoNormal">this is not the only weird experience i've had. </p>




<p class="MsoNormal">a few yrs ago i had a friend over on halloween and we were
talking with only a candle on so we could see each other in the middle of aour
conversation the candle went out so i got up to turn the light on but when i
did the candle came back on again. later that same night a glass jar full of
glass stones threw itself at my friends head we were really badly shaken up and
didnt sleep well that night</p>




<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>




<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>




<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">Ghosts....</p>




<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">By: pretty_short_stuff@yahoo.com</p>




<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>




<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">I really believe in ghosts. I know that they are real and
walk this earth. I admit i have never seen one face to face or anything but i
have a feeling that they are always around me. Well my first encounter was when
i went to sleep over my cousins house. I was sleeping in the middle of both my
cousins since i was the smallest and all. That night i woke up wanting to go to
the bathroom.I was about to wake up my oldest cousin to tell her to go with me
because it was dark and didn't want to go by myself. i stopped and decided not
to thinking she was going to think i was some kind of a hi ken or would get mad
at me for waking her up in the middle of the night.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">So i got out of bed and went into the hall. My heart was
pounding because i was really afraid of the dark and i couldn't turn on the
hall light because my aunt would get mad. Since they had trouble with the
electricity bill. Well anyway the bathroom was all the way down the hall. So i
walked as fast as my little chubby legs could walk. When i got in the bathroom
and turned on the light i was so happy. I did my business. The worst part was
opening the bathroom door and turning off the light because then everything
will turn pitch black all over again. So i took a deep breath turned it off and
started walking that's when i heard the little rustling and the little
footsteps. I was about to call out who is there when i saw a small little
person peeking around a corner of the hall. I stopped dead in my tracks. I
swear i saw the little person give an evil grin in my way. I couldn't tell
because i wad already running to my cousins room. I got into the middle ad felt
safe. Well that's my story. Other than that in my house i always hear noises.
I'm a night person so i am always the last in my family to go to sleep. I stay
up every night reading a book. Some night while i am reading (i can assure you
i am wide awake and alert) i hear someone in the kitchen getting water from the
sink, or someone shuffling my parents papers in the dining room I am the only
one with a view of the living room and the kitchen and the dining room<span style="">&nbsp; </span>its really weird hearing those sound since i
didn't see anyone come down the hall of pass my room. Other times i hear steps
in the hall going back and forth back and forth, but i dont see anyone. I dont
think its anything evil.I just think they are ghosts who are roaming around my
house. Or the ghost of the old lady who lived here before us. The lady was
found in the living on the floor because her granddaughter treated her really
badly. She didnt feed her.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My husband and i have lived in this same condo for nearly 8
years now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's become our
"home" and we're suite happy with staying here until we're more
financially stable to buy a house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've
never had any "bad" feelings here, but I've always felt that there
was something around us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our daughter
used to talk about a lady in a<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">blue shirt that kept trying to take her water she kept by
the bed.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">She would also have "guests" for tea besides her
stuffed animals and dolls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she
pointed out a picture of my aunt Katie, we knew it was her immediately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our daughter was only a little over 2 when
Katie passed away from diabetes complications, but in the time that they had
together she brought so much happiness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So now, when I feel<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">something in her room, I know it's Katie there watching over
her.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">Other family members have had visits, too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The radio will come on when a Smokey Robinson
song is playing or it will turn to her favorite station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have other visitors, too, mostly family I
believe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband was laying in bed
the other day, after kicking the cats out of bed and reading a bit (he works
nights).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just as he was about to close
his eyes, someone rattled the hangers in the closet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He looked up and saw them moving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were no windows open, the cats were
out, and nothing had fallen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He believes
it was his mother sending a message to him to "Chill out", as he had
been stressing all week about a job interview to the point it was affecting our
daily lives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was the first person to
pop into his<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">head when it happened.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We also have someone being mischievous here.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">I cleaned out my purse the other night, trying to find my
wallet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I completely empties the purse
and it wasn't there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This morning, it
was right in the top.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sewing things
get moved, keys that were hung up the night before are across the room in the
morning, little things like that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've
also heard them, too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A couple of times
I'll be reading or something and I'll hear a faint voice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once it simply<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">said "Hi", another time it sounded like a couple
people whispering.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">None of it has been frightening, most of it has been
comforting in fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm not sure who
else is here besides our family, or who likes to play jokes, but they are
welcome.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They've never scared us and
when my daughter was little and was becoming frightened I asked them to stop
and they did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess we're pretty lucky
to have respectful ghosts, they feel like part of the family after all this
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oh, I better mention Otis or I'll
pay for it later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otis was our cat we
had when we moved in here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had an
attitude to say the least and her favorite game was terrifying anyone that came
to visit by trapping them in the kitchen and growling at them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But she was always loving to us and very
protective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sadly, she became ill and we
had to put her to sleep about 3 years ago.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But she still comes around, even more now that another cat we rescued is
the spitting image of her, but a lot more friendly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've seen both our cats jump up on the bed,
only to get scared and jump off again like she was there to let them know it
was still her spot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've felt her climb
up on the bed when I'm reading and when I look to see which cat it is, there's
nothing there but an impression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've
even heard a purr when no other cats are around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So she's still here, too and still staking
her claim on her favorite spots and letting the other cats know who's boss from
the other side. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">. my first one was one time i got up earlier than usual so
everything was still dark so i couldnt see anything, i went upstairs, when i
was going up i felt a strong feeling from nowhere when a man in a glowing
yellow overcoat approched me. i almost screamed but i said "Spirit leave
and dont come back ever" and amazingly, he listened and i never had
another with him at least. My second one was when i was actually looking the
the shadowland ghost page a loud banging was right next to me, it sounded like
a hammer, so i remembered when i told the other spirit to leave so i told iot
to him or her and it left again, and i know my dogs ghost is here, you can feel
her licking your hand in the morning when the other dogs is 20 feet away with
my dad</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A Couple of My Stories</p>




<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">By: bryndy0401@yahoo.com</p>




<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">My first story is the one I call The Man in the Doorway.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">In the early 1990's I had a friend who was renting a room in
a house in the Mayfair section of <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Philadelphia</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man my friend was renting from was rarely
there, and there was a third bedroom that was furnished but unoccupied.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">One night my friend and I were out in the city dancing and
having fun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we returned to his
house it was quite late and we both decided that it would be safer if I spent
the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The owner of the home was not
present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After unwinding for a little
bit, my friend went to his room and I went to the third bedroom and lay on the
bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was drifting very close to sleep
when something made me look at the bedroom doorway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There I saw a figure of a man.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">Thinking it was my friend, I very sleepily asked,
"What?"</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">Getting no response I sort of lifted my head off the pillow
and looked closer at the figure, which was just kind of slouched against the
doorframe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although there was a
nightlight in the hallway to the right of the figure, I noticed that I couldn't
see any discernable features.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
frightened me and all I could think to do was turn my face to the wall and say
a prayer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I looked again, the
figure was gone.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">In the morning my friend swore it was not him standing in
the hall and I know it wasn't the homeowner because he arrived sometime around
noon and I asked him if he minded that I spent the night in the third
bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said he didn't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I then asked him if he had been home and gone
back out while we were sleeping and he replied that he hadn't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did not sleep in that room again.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">Another strange thing that happened to me also occurred in
the early 1990's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A very good friend of
mine took me with her to several farms while she looked for a new place to
board her horse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a bright, sunny
Saturday and we had been around to several farms, soaking in the sunlight and
enjoying the country air.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">As we drove up the gravel drive of the last farm of the day
I started to feel strange.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My fingers
began to tingle and, although it was hot in the car, I broke out in
goosebumps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she parked the car in
front of an old shed across from the farmhouse, I tried to act normal but felt
weak in the legs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The owner of the farm
had come out to greet us and as we walked past the shed I felt what I can only
describe as a darkening of my spirit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
wanted to get out of there, but didn't want to act like a fool and ruin my
friend's chances of finding a boarding place for her horse.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">As we approached the gate that opened onto a path to the
barn my steps became slower and slower.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Something inside me was telling me not to go through the gate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I made a feeble excuse about wanting to watch
the horses in the pasture and waited while my friend and the farmer went
through the gate and down the path toward the barn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the while they were gone I refused to
turn around and look at the shed, without really knowing why.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">Shortly, my friend returned and I all but ran to the car as
she bid goodbye to the farmer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she
got into the car I noticed that she gripped the steering wheel very hard and as
she turned around in the drive I asked her what was wrong. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>She related to me that she didn't like the
farm and wouldn't be boarding her horse there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I asked her why and all she could tell me was that she didn't know why -
just a feeling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, I told her why I
wouldn't go through the gate with her and the bad feeling I had about the
shed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We both agreed that there was
something evil there and that we didn't want to get any closer to it than we
already had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do not know the exact
location of this farm, but I do know that the area where it had stood was later
sold and homes were built on the site.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
wonder to this day if anyone in those homes has weird or unexplained
experiences. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Many Ghost Experiences</p>




<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">By: thwing@cox.net </p>




<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">i have had, in my opinion, alot of experiences with ghosts.
so i will write them all down here.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">in our old house, me, my dad, my little brother, and my
littlest brother were sitting down eating dinner. all of the sudden, my
littlest brother jumped up cried "look! moms here!!" my mom got off
work later so my dad sadi "No she isnt!" then my moms voice replied
"yes she is! so naturally we all got up to see if she was there. when we
looked out side, her car wasnt there, and she was nowhere in sight. my mom got
home about an hour later. in this house, i would constantly here the gate
opneing and closing, many times i would get up to see if somone was there, but
i was usually dissapointed. </p>




<p class="MsoNormal">one day as my dad was driving us home from school, i looked
out of the window and saw a man wearing cowboy boots, a red checkered shirt,
and a cowby hat walking down the street. all the sudden, he disolved into what
looked like colored bubbles. i call him the cowboy(duh).</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">another time, i woke up in the middle of the night. this is
pretty unusual becuase when i am asleep, i usually sleep like a log. so anyway,
i woke up and it was pitch black except for this weird blue light on the wall.
i started to walk to it, i was a bit confused and freaked, so i reached for the
light and turned it on, there was nothing on the wall. we think that this may
have been my grandmothers ghost, becasue it was my moms first birthday since my
grandma had died.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">on the night our beloved rat died, i encountered his ghost(i
think). i was really upset becasue i loved him alot, all the sudden my sweater
started to move around like something was clinging on to it and trying to climb
up my sweater. later that night, my cat was chasing somthing i couldnt see, he
looked like he was hunting. he always had wanted the rat.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">also our cats would look around and act strangley sometimes.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">anyway we moved from that house to our current house which
is also in my belief "haunted". me and my friend and her little
sister were in the hall, when we saw the corner of a white dress whip around
the corner. we all saw it, and it was a bit freaky.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">one night when i was just about to fall asleep, something
banged on the mirror right by my head (the wall my bed is against is made up of
three floor length mirrors). the mirror was it with alot of force, and i
couldnt have hit it by accident, becuase i would have felt it. </p>




<p class="MsoNormal">the door to my bedroom will sometimes open, stay open for
about 45 seconds, then shut. it will do this for about 3-6 minutes, then stop.
sometimes when i am in the big bathroom at the back of the house i will see a
young woman watching me in the corner of the mirror, or sometimes, i will see
her out of the corner of my eye. once me and a friend were in there, and we saw
her clearly in the mirror, she had dark hair, and a white dress, but i sensed
that she is a "nice" ghost.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">since i was born, i have lived in three haunted houses. the
first one when i was two months old, and apparently that was a "mean"
spirit. and the other two i have written anout. so i hope you enjoy my
experiences.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In 1987 i was stationed at Shaw AFB SC, then a Staff
Sargent. I had just finished my shift at midnite and was on my way down 378
east to my fiance's house to spend saturday and sunday with her.About 15 miles
down the 4 lane road devided mostly by a wide median with dense trees in an
area called bear swamp,i saw someone standing in the road. I was so close to
him or her all i could do was hit my brakes hard,i was doing 60 and slid to the
rightand onto the shoulder to a stop.I jumped out of the car to see if i could
help the person i had hit,but no one was there.I open my trunk and got my
flashlite.I found nothing,no damage to the car nothing at all.It scared the
hell out of me.I drove the next few miles with the hairs on back of my neck standing
up.Next day i drove back to the site with my fiance and saw the tire marks and
the torn up grass on the shoulder.She said i had just been tired and imagined
it.I was not that tired and i would swear that it was real.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">"JENNY" DIED I TO MY BEST OF RECOLLECTION , MID
DAY DURING THE SUMMER PERIOD, IN 1993 OR 1994 I CANT REMEMBER FOR SURE, BUT IT
WAS A SHORT TIME BEFORE I LEFT THE COMPANY IN 1995 ( MY EMPLOYMENT WAS 1989 -
1995).</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">I REMEMBER I WAS A " C0 - CONTROLLER" IN AN
UNDERGROUND ROOM (ONE OF TWO, AS WE RAN 2 TOWERS) WE WERE RESPONSABLE FOR
WATCHING ALL<span style="">&nbsp; </span>RIDE VECHICLES IN OUR
TOWER. WE HAD A SAFTEY SWITCH TO STOP THE RIDE AND BRING DOWN THE ISOLATED CAR
THAT SEEMED TO HAVE ANY PROBLEMS.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">IN THIS PARTICULAR ISOLATED OCCURANCE, I SPOTTED A PERON
SMALL IN FORM, WHO WAS NOT DOING WELL, NOTIFIFING MY SUPERVISOR WHAT WAS GOING
ON WE BROUGHT THE VEHICLE DOWN. THE ATTENDANT THEN WENT INTO THE ROOM OPENED
THE VECHICLE DOORS, LIFTED THE SAFTEY BARS</p>






<p class="MsoNormal">AND A HUMAN FORM FELL OUT OF THE VECHICLE.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">THE GIRL WAS REVIVED BY PARAMEDICS THAT HAD BEEN CALLED, BUT
DIED MOMENTS LATER. ( VERY EMOTIONAL BY ALL INVOLVED )</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS FOLLOWING WIERD THINGS BEGAN TO HAPPEN
AROUND THE BUILDING.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>KEEP IN MIND JENNY
DIED IN TOWER 2 , 3RD FLOOR ( I CANT REMEMEBER THE LAB. DOOR NUMBER BUT IT WAS
THE LAST DOOR FROM THE EXIT). I WAS ALWAYS ON THE MORNING SHIFT WHICH ENTITLED
CLEANING OF EACH FLOOR, LAB ROOM, JUST DAILY ROUTINE STUFF TO OPEN FOR THE
PUBLIC. I ALSO HAD TO GO DOWN TO THE <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">CONTROL</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype w:st="on">CENTER</st1:placetype></st1:place>'S TO TAKE THE
VECHICLES UP TO RUN A TEST ON THEM TO DETERMINE IF ALL VECHICLES WERE IN
WORKING ORDER.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>WE ALWAYS HAD A PROBLEM
WITH THE VECHICLE THAT " JENNY"<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>DIED ON. IT WOULD FREEZE UP, ACT ABNORMALY.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THE MOST IMPORTANT AND FREAKISH THING WAS THE
VISION OF A YOUNG GIRL SITTING ALONE ON THE " TEST RIDE" WHERE SHE
DIED.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">OTHER THAN SEEING HER ON OPENING SHIFTS, I SAW BALLS BOUCING
DOWN THE HALLWAYS , THE HOLDING ROOMS HAD DISPLAY ITEMS<span style="">&nbsp; </span>LOCKED BEHIND PLEXY GLASS FOR DISPLAY BUT
WHER ALWAYS OUT AND TAMPERED WITH, THE KEY TO THE CASES WAS KEPT<span style="">&nbsp; </span>IN THE CORPORATE OFFICE WE COULD NEVER FIGURE
OUT HOW THEY GOT OPENED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>COLD SPOTS AND
BREEZES IN HOT SUMMER DAYS, AND LOUD VIBRATING SOUNDS OF A YOUNG GIRL LAUGHING
OVER THE LOUD SPEAKER, I WITNESSED A CO WORKERS HAIR LIFT AND BE TUGGED ON WHEN
SHE WAS LOUNGING ON THE GROUND ON THE <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">THIRD</st1:placename> <st1:placename w:st="on">FLOOR</st1:placename>

<p class="MsoNormal">THERE WERE ALL KINDS OF STORIES FLOATING AROUND FROM
DIFFERENT EMPLOYEES WHEN I WORKED THERE.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>SOME I KNOW AS FIRST HAND EXPERENCES, SOME SECOND HAND, MAYBE SOME HAVE
BEEN FABRCATED OVER THE YEARS WHO KNOW'S ?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I DO KNOW WHAT IVE SEEN, AND I WILL LEAVE YOU WTIH THIS LAST STORY.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">A MAN THAT I HAD DATED FOR A WHILE, HAD A VERY BAD
EXPERIENCE AND QUIT SOON AFTER.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">HE CLAIMED WHILE HE WAS RUNNING TEST RUNS IN THE EARLY
MORNING HE SAW WHAT HE DISCRIBED TO BE A SKELETON<span style="">&nbsp; </span>WITH RED GLOWING EYES<span style="">&nbsp; </span>HOPPING FROM VEHICLE TO VEHICLE, RIGHT AWAY
HE WAS NACIOUS, AND LOST HIS BREAKFAST, HE SAID HE FELT AN OVER WELMING
SADDNESS AND TERROR.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">THROUGH RUMORS FROM EMPLOYEES THAT I CONTACT FROM TIME TO

<p class="MsoNormal">THERE WAS A PYSICIC INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED IN PREVIOUS
YEARS, AND THEY HAD NO LUCK IN RELEASEING WHAT EVER WAS HAPPENEING THERE.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Anklet Sounds</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">we live in hyderabad,India.when i was 14 our family faced a
financial crisis.we had to shift to a 3 room house.there was an empty land
right to our house.I norally used to study till late while preparing for my
annual tests.that was the first time i encountered a ghost.all though i didnt
see it for the first 2 months,i could say that it was a ghost as i could hear
the sounds of anklets when a woman moved.(in our country women wear anklets to
the heels.It is a custom here).The sound would be so clear and start at 11:45
pm every day and continued to atleast 3:00 am in the morning.The sound appears
as if someone walked through the balcony and then in the walk area in the right
side and then to the front door.Initially i was very frightened and could not
study at nights and i told my parents about this.my mother also agreed that she
would hear the sound so clearly when she was all alone in the afternoon.she
said she would hear the sound from 11:45 am to 3:00 pm! after it one night i
was studying as usual,late at night,may be it was 12:00 am and i was studying
in the table light.suddenly i got up and opened the side door(i could not stop
myself from doing so and felt like i was being forced to open the door).It was
summer and temperatures were as high as 30 degree celcius at night and i felt
deadly cold and my hair on the neck stood and that was the first i saw a
ghost.It was a white form from top to bottom and i could see the feet glowing
and i could say that she was wearing golden anklets.After a minute or so I was
back to normal and i felt warm again.just then my mother came running and
pulled me inside.she had a dream that very night that i was opening a door!
later on the sighting becam more often and i cared less about it.The owner of
our house knew nothing about the ghostly lady but she too heard the sound of
the anklets and thought it was made by some one down the street.My father's
friend (a priest)once came to our house and he couldnt enter the house.he says
that a white form is opposing him.he said that the spirit had great powers and
it was a good one and it will protect the people in the house.By this I became
more brave and often leaved the door open while i studied late in the
nights.now we became wealthy again and moved into a different house and had no
such experiences yet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">OK iv had personal experiances but it was when i was real
young and i re<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y cant figure out
the detail's it <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname> sorta a mesh of
things so ill give you my best friends story.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">ok my best friend live in an orange grove when she was like
five or six and a lot of lil things would happen, but because it was just lil
things most adults didn't believe her but one night she was <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname> alone. her mom and lil brother had walked up the
street to the store and she didnt want to go and since it wasn't that far they
didn't think it would be a prob. well my best friend was sitting in the living
room when she heard a noise it startled her, since she was <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname> alone<span style="">&nbsp; </span>she
got up to check what it was. when she fin<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y
got into her moms bedroom she saw what looked like a lil girl siting on her
moms bed but she was slightly transparent, my best friend was so scared <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname> she could do was sit there and stare. then she
herd the door close so she looked toward the front door and saw that her mom
had come back but when she looked back the lil girl was gone. she told her mom
but of course her mom said she just had an over active imagination and my
friend didn't see the lil girl for a week or so but one night maybe a week later<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my friend was lying in her moms bed room
witch had a big glass sliding door that looked straight into the orange grove.
yea i know what you thinking the lil girl could have gotten out that way i said
the same thing except that<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it was only a
half second that my friend had her head turned and she was close enough that if
any one went out the door she would have herd it. but anyways,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>they were watching TV when my friends mom
looked over into the grove and what she saw almost gave he a heart attack. my
friend looked over when she herd her mom gasp what was standing maybe ten feet
from the glass slider was the same transparent girl from the week before. then <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname> of a sudden as if she just floated away she was
gone. my friends says over the next year a few random things would happen and
every once in a while she would catch some one staring at her out of the corner
of her eye and feel the lil hairs on the back of her neck stand up but when
she'd look there wouldn't bee any one<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a
year later they moved but my friend still to this day sees thing i think she
may be a lil bit clairvoyant but i don't know the things she sees Arnet always
the same but, some times i don't like spending the night with her cause i never
know what she may see.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It was Just before winter. I was lying in bed with my two
year old daughter. Not asleep yet, I opened my eyes and saw the figure of a
little boy. I couldn't see any features. He was a silouette but I saw his
little body. </p>




<p class="MsoNormal">We had toys strewn <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>
over the floor at that time.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">My daughter and my roommates kids would play with them <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname> day and be too tired in the evening to pick them
up. So I believe that this is the reason for the little boy wanting to be in
our room that night.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">When I opened my eyes I had seen him bending over as though
he was picking something up (like a toy) and he slowely lifted up. As he lifted
up his silouette faded away.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">I've thought before that I've seen something but not like
this. I can say that I've thought that I've seen something befor, but this time
I question myself on those because I know what I saw this time. I do not
question myself now.</p>

of the clothes in my closet just moved out of no where!!! And there no one else
in the room but me. At first I thought that maybe it was the ghost of someone
who died in our house but didn't to leave it and was haunting the place. We
also had just moved in not to long ago. But then I remembered that we we're the
first ones to live there!!!!! I'm still not sure if it was a ghost-or just a
figure of my imagination, but whatever it was, it sure freaked me out. Nothing
weird or paranormal has happened since then, but there's no telling where it
will strike next ir if it'll even happen again. my mom just got remarried and
the guy she has two sons that sleepover alot, so we <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>
swapped rooms; my mom and Pat downstairs, the boys got my sister's old room, I
got my parent's old room, and my sister got my old room. Let's just hope that
the same thing doesn't happen to my sister. And it freaked me out pretty bad,
and she's sm<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>er than me, so it
would probrobly freak her out even more.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This is my second submission to your site.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After reading so many stories, I find myself
remembering how scared I was to go to sleep while living in this one
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I must've been between 7 and 10
years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house was my maternal
grandmother's house, which had been passed down to my mother after she
died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did I say house?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was more like a third-world wooden shack -
liter<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Four rooms in the house in <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname> - sm<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>
living room, sm<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>er kitchen and two
bedrooms in <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How did 7 of us live there?!!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Oh yeah, did I forget to mention the
outhouse?</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">Anyway, my grandmother was a medium and was always
contacting the spirit world, this before I was ever born.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After her death, my mother, her new husband
and <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname> 5 kids move in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Though the worst horrors I remember in this
house had nothing to do with spirits, (having been an abused child) I never had
a good night's sleep in that house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
roof was nothing more than tin planks, so when it rained it made a wonderfully
lulling sound that could put most people to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Me...I heard this, plus clapping, <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname> night!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
I would lay in bed, in between my two sisters, (we shared one bed and never
would I sleep alone or on the outer side of the bed - always on the inside!) I
would think, that's not clapping, that just rain f<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>ing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But no matter how much I tried to fool myself
out of being scared out of my mind, it wouldn't work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some of the clapping was so loud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would lay there in bed and envision these
hands, nothing more than these pairs of hands in the kitchen, the room right
next to our bedroom, floating and clapping <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>
night.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">My sister swore she saw this woman going up the walkway that
lead from the roadside up to my mother's aunt's house (she lived behind
us).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said the woman was dressed in
black complete with a black veil covering her whole head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As my sister was looking out the only window
in our room, the woman turned to look at her and c<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>ed
her name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never believed her
either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told her she was
dreaming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Though I never "saw"
anything strange, I cannot deny the minute night fell (whether raining or not)
I was always terrified to go to sleep and would lay awake for hours sometimes
listening to other noises of the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">Of course, this was rural <st1:place w:st="on">Puerto Rico</st1:place>,
where there were rats the size of possums in the cornfields across the road
from our shack!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So many of the noises I
would hear in or around the house, I would attribute to these and other
critters of the night.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">My mother swears experiencing some supernatural events in
the house while her mother was living.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was sitting in on a seance her mother was holding one night and was
picked up, chair and <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>, and held
up against a w<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>, while everyone
sat and watched.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">I was her firstborn and she divorced my father even before
my birth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She went back to live with her
mother and one night, after I was born, she and my grandmother were awoken by
my hungry cries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They both got up and my
grandmother picked me up and told my mom to get my bottle from the
kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother could not leave the
room - there was one solid w<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname> in
front of them but no door!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both women
tried to find the doorway and couldn't.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So my grandmother sat back down on the bed and said, When they are
ready, the will let us pass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They waited
about a minute and possibly said a prayer and then they were able to walk right
through the doorway they both knew was there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The room had been dark, due to no electricity in the house - we lived by
candlelight back then - I am now 42, just to give you a time reference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even 20 years ago, most people there did not
have a telephone and would receive and make phone c<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>s
at someone's house who did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many
roadways in this sm<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname> rural
community were not paved and every yard had a handful of chickens - so, yes,
very rural indeed!<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">As a kid, I heard more than my share of supernatural
stories.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some I found easy to believe
some I didn't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While my experiences have
been very few and not having actu<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y
seen anything, I know that certain people can open doors into places we'd
rather not go to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">I know this is getting lengthy, but I just remembered
another house (this one a row home here in the states) where some creepy stuff
was supposedly going on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this house
it was said that the previous owners had found some witchcraft or black magic
artifact in their front entrance and this had brought some spirits in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People claimed some weird stuff was going
on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">A friend of the family was over one night and while she and
my mother chatted in the kitchen, us kids hung out in front of the TV. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>My mom's friend got up to go to the bathroom
upstairs and did a fast walk back to the kitchen - without having gone up!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told my mom that she saw a teenage girl
dressed in a long, white, nightdress walking from the back bedroom and towards
the front bedroom, with her arms crossed in front of her chest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was about 13 at the time and did not
believe her, but she looked white as a ghost herself and I now think, Why would
this woman make this up?<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">There's more that we experienced in this house, but I will
have to share that later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Though not
terribly exciting, I still hope you enjoy the read!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>




<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">When we first moved to our house about 8 years ago, our
house was only 8 years old built on what was farmland that saw skirmishes in
both the French and Indian War and of course, the Civil War.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The road was an access road between what is
now Rte 3 and <st1:street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Zoar Road</st1:address></st1:street>
(611).</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">I was in the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I just moved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband was gone
back west to bring out stuff out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had
a new born and a 4 year old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The kitchen
is a fairly open space.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was standing
in the middle of the kitchen, I had on a b<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>
cap with sun glasses sitting on the bill. Out of no where, something knocked
the bill and the glasses went flying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was slammed with a strong impression of a pissed off Indian both of us eye to
eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can tell you what he looked
like.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't see him but this was the
very strong thought that came to mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
know I live on <st1:street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Indiantown Road</st1:address></st1:street>
but duh, I didn't put two and two together at the time that Indians lived
there.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">We've had candles (in particular) knock over--I couldn't
keep a pair of tapers whole until I just stopped buying them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every night about 11:30, I would hear a
crash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I kept a heart shaped candle on
the back of the guest commode and about the same time every single night, the
crash would come and this or any other knick knack I put on the back of the
commode would invariably be in the middle of the h<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>way.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">Two kids--one 10 and one 5 were playing in my girls'
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The baby was in a stationary
walker.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I peeked in on them and I was
about to admonish the (older kids) to not play in the bathroom when I realized
that the noise in the bathroom (this would be the master bath except we gave
the girls' the master bedroom) was that of a rattle rocking on the floor, by
itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">There have been other things, but things that other people
have seen are a cabinet door flying open, same area of the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Something or nothing, rattling the kitchen
door knob to point that my now 12 year old daughter went flying and hollering
for my husband and about two weeks ago, I was in the house by myself, in the
living room and heard very distinctly the silverware drawer in the kitchen,
open and close.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Same area of the kitchen
I was standing where my hat went flying, etc.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">Also, there is an area of our front yard where we've
"heard" stuff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the ten
year old friend would leave our house to walk to the bus stop, as she passed
this corner of our yard, she would ask if I c<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>ed
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She claims to have heard her
name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I mow that area of the yard,
I hear what sounds like a record being played backwards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I have never re<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y
been a believer in ghosts or spirits before my experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now I know that there is.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">My experience took place at <st1:placename w:st="on">Curve</st1:placename>
<st1:placetype w:st="on">Lake</st1:placetype>, Native Indian reserve just
outside of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Peterborough</st1:city>, <st1:state w:st="on">Ontario</st1:state>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region></st1:place>
about 2 years ago.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">Me and my friend Blaze, A native, were walking around the
reserve late at night one night around where the forest was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friend noticed what time it was and became
very nervous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His family were big
believers of spirits and other....supernatural things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told me of a forest spirit that wandered
through the forest late at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
spoke of an old medicine man who was murdered that was buried around their many
years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said it was a legend of
his ghost but he didnt know if it were true or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The legend went that if you wandered through
the forest at night and were to whistle loud enough in a high pitch and then a
lower pitch you would hear the exact same whistle somewhere in the forest and
then the spirit would take revenge on the person who c<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>ed
him and anyone else around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I said at
the start I wasn't a believer in spirits or anything of that kind so I started
whistling as a kind of joke.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friend
became very upset and said he wanted to go back to the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We started walking back to the house which is
right beside the forest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't stop
whistling which I gravely regret.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember
like it was yesterday what happened next.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I whistled for the last time and everything went silent and very cold,
which was wierd because it had been verry hot a few seconds before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next thing that happened horrified me to
my very soul.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Me and my friend heard an
extremely high pitched and loud whistle exactly like mine come from the depths
of the forest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next thing we knew we
heard sm<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname> trees and sticks
snapping in the forest <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname> around us
and a mad laughing come from where we heard the whistle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never remember running faster than I did
then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We could see his house from where
we were so we ran along the dirt road <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>
the way there and slammed the door when we got in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When my friends mother saw the look of horror
on our faces she knew already what had happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"You whistled?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told her that I didn't know it was
real.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We don't want that kind of
negative energy around our house thankyou.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Don't do it again."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
this expierience I know that there is something<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>beyond our world and some of it isn't a joke and shouldn't be fooled
around with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It happened when I was studying at my university. One night
I decided to stay up since the exam is just around the corner. I make a cup of
coffee because I hoped that I won't get into sleepy.I looked at the watch and
it showed me 1.00 a.m.'Oh, it's still early', I mumbling to myself. I was alone
in my room. My roomate went back to her house because she had a long gap
between her final examination. </p>




<p class="MsoNormal">When I was focusing on my study, suddenly I heard someone
knocked the door. I thought that it was my friend. Then, I walked to the door
and opened it. There's no one in front of that door. I looked to the left and
to the right to ensure that I didn't missed my sight. I didn't see anyone.
Then, I decided to continue on my study. After a while, I heard foot stepping
and someone knocked again my door. The sounds become louder and louder. I get
into angry because it interrupted me. I walked to the door and opened again the
door. Suddenly, I heard women's screaming and laughing. The sounds keep on
continued and I felt someone whispered on my ear. My hand suddenly shaking and
I re<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y scared. I want to shout but
my voice didn't come out. I want to cry but there's no tears on my face. I
prayed to myself hoping that it was just my illution. It took me 10 minutes
standing in front of my door. After realized that I had stand for a long time,
I took decision to go sleep. i said to myself that I won't stay up again.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I used to walk to the bus stop with the elderly gentleman
living near us.He became ill and I did not see him until one bright sunny
morning a few months later.As I walked down the path,I glanced to the left and
I saw the elderly gentleman walking slowly up past the hedge round the front
garden.He turned and looked straight at me,and I was struck by how pale he
appeared to be.Not until later did I realise I could not hear the sound of his
footsteps,although he appeared to be walking in his usual manner apart from
being slower.I happened to glance away and when I looked back there was no one
there.There was nowhere he could have disappeared to,and he had not collapsed
on the pavement.In the evening,I discovered that he had died about half an hour
before I had seen him that morning.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Parents bought the house that we currently live in, about
5yrs ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Things didn't re<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y start happening till maybe after a yr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the basement, there is a living room,
laundry room, my room, my bro's room and a bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night, I stayed up late using the comp,
which is located in the downstairs living room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All of the sudden, I heard a faint whistle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I look up, to see if anyone was there, but
no.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I decided that it was either the TV
or my imagination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 10-15min later,
I hear the whistle again, but this time it was a lil louder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought that maybe it was my bro trying to
scare me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I opened the door to his room
and saw that he in real deep sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I go
back to the living room and get back on the comp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>5min later, I hear the whistle again, but
this time, it's right next to my ear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
freaked out and turned everything off and went straight to bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that, I would hear the whistling,
downstairs, more often.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never re<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y felt scared or threatened by it, its was just
normal to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I even gave it a name,
''The Whistling Ghost''.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would tell my
family about it, but they just said it was just my imagination or something. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>But then one night, it happened to my
sis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was downstairs using the comp
and I told her I was going to bed early, so had to try and keep quiet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She stayed in the living room by
herself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was fin<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y
f<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>ing asleep, when she just busted
in my room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said my name and I just
said ''What?!''<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She just looked around
and said, ''Never mind''.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She leaves my
room and I hear her turn everything off and go upstairs to her room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day I asked why she did that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told me that after I went to bed, that
she heard a loud whistle and got re<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y
scared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just remember telling her, ''I
told you''.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was the only thing that
would happen at my house, till recently.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My mom told me that one night, her and my dad were in their room,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>just watching some TV.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She remembers that no one was home that
night, it was just them 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later on that
night, she heard someone open the door and walk into the living room, straight
to the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She thought it was my
bro coming home, so she c<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>ed out
his name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one said nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She c<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>ed
him a couple more times and no one answered her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She got up and went to check and see who came
in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She went to go check the door to see if maybe
they had left the door open, but she saw that the screen door was locked, so
there was no way that someone could've come in.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A couple of days later, I was watching TV in the family room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know that everyone is asleep and my bro was
out that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maybe around 1am, I
heard the door open and some footsteps going to the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought that my bro had come home, so I
turned around to wait for him to come out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>10min passed and he never did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
went to go check in the bathroom and there was no one there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I checked the door, and the screen door was
locked. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>I didn't re<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y feel scared, just kinda weird.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So now, in my house, your hear "The
