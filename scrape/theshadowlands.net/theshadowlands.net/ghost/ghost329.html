spiritualist and well versed on the history of the Mansion. The<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>evening started
out with a brief description of the Mansion and a<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>demonstration of
the use of divining (sp) rods. I have never used them<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>before and in
all honestly very skeptical of their use. Anyway - we were<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>allowed to
explore the 3rd floor at our leisure. My wife started to enter a<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>closet and
immediately backed out saying that there was something strange in<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>there. I being
skeptical decided to step into the closet with the rods in<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>hand. I stood
there perfectly motionless and blocking the <span class=SpellE>enterance</span>
to the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>closet. I stood
there for maybe 15 seconds and started to think in my own<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>mind how lame
this is. At that very moment the rod in my right hand was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>pushed up into
the air at least 10 - 12 inch. I stood there for a second the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>shined a light
into the closet to see if by chance anyone was in there with<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>me. Now remember
I am blocking the entrance/exit. No one is there. I found<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>that very
interesting. My wife and I took several pictures with our digital<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>camera. Several I
believe had Orbs but 2 of them have something in them I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>cannot explain.
In one picture<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>there is a streak of
light that looks like a<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>fluorescing
light is standing up by itself right in from of me as I took the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>picture. The
other one is a &quot;Swoosh&quot; of light that looks like a time lapse<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>photo of a
moving light. However the other items in the picture are clear as<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>a bell without
distortion. I cannot explain either of these. I will forward<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>them to you if
you are interested. The last event in the mansion did get my<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>attention. I was
standing at the top of the stairs waiting for the people to<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>go down when I
felt 3 tugs on my shirt. I turned thinking that the lady<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>behind me was
trying to get my attention. However she was turned with her<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>back to me
speaking to her husband. I looked forward again and as soon as I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>did so I felt
another tug on my shirt sleeve. This time I turned quick<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>enough that I
seen 2 more tugs on my shirt and no human hand doing the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>tugging.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At this point I am trying to rationalize what
had just taken<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>place. I looked
for a possible air supply but realized that a breeze would<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>not have felt
like the tug on my shirt. As the people started to move down<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the steps I<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>turned my head to concentrate on the steps
for they were narrow<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>and steep. Just
then I felt 3 more tugs on my shirt sleeve. This time I was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>quick enough and
seen all 3 tugs. I found this very fascinating. Like I said<o:p></o:p></span></p>

by trade and always look for the reason of anything and how<o:p></o:p></span></p>

rod being hit while holding it or the tugs on my sleeves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

GOT BACK INTO BED. AS SOON AS HE LAID DOWN THE RADIO CAME ON AGAIN. I SAID THAT
MAYBE THE SNOOZE ALARM WAS ON AND TOLD HIM TO JUST TURN THE VOLUME DOWN AS LOW
AS IT WOULD GO. HE GOT UP AGAIN TO TURN THE VOLUME DOWN AND GOT BACK INTO BED.
THIS TIME THE RADIO CAME ON AT FULL VOLUME. AS SOON AS HE GOT UP TO UNPLUG THE
RADIO, THE WATER IN THE KITCHEN SINK CAME ON FULL BLAST. HE RAN TO TURN IT OFF
AND NO SOONER THAN HE TURNED OFF THE WATER IN THE KITCHEN, THE WATER IN THE

style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>. I have had many things happen to me
while living in this house and they still <span class=SpellE>countue</span> to
happen. The first time was right after we moved in. One night around 12:30am <span
class=SpellE>i</span> heard our back door slam and <span class=SpellE>i</span>
just thought it might have been my brother going to pet the dog and went back
to sleep the next morning my oldest brother asked me and me other older brother
if we went outside around 12:30 that night we both said no and he said he heard
the backdoor slam and we thought it was odd because his room is in the basement
and mine is on the 2nd story and we were the only ones to hear it. I was never
out of my room after 12:00 until one night <span class=SpellE>i</span> opened
my door were there is a small hallway and the door to my parents room the
bathroom my room and my brothers <span class=SpellE>rrom</span> and the <span
class=SpellE>stairwy</span> and to this day after12:00 if you open your door
you can feel someone watching you until you get to the bottom of the stairs or
close a door to the room you are going to. On <span class=SpellE>ocasions</span>
<span class=SpellE>i</span> can hear people walking up and down the stairs and
my mom says the same time every night in her room she hears a boom and her
walls. At night <span class=SpellE>i</span> have to sleep with the <span
class=SpellE>tv</span> on because <span class=SpellE>i</span> can hear the
boards squeak in my room like someone is walking and <span class=SpellE>i</span>
hear noises in the attic. When <span class=SpellE>im</span> home alone <span
class=SpellE>i</span> hear the noises even more louder and clearer. One <span
class=SpellE>mornign</span> while <span class=SpellE>i</span> was getting ready
for school <span class=SpellE>i</span> was home alone <span class=SpellE>i</span>
got up opened my door and <span class=SpellE>i</span> heard chiming in my moms
room. <span class=SpellE>i</span> thought it was <span class=SpellE>occw</span>
d because she <span class=SpellE>doesnt</span> have <span class=SpellE>windchimes</span>
in or anywhere around her room and all the windows were closed. There was one
time <span class=SpellE>i</span> was on the phone with my 2 friends and <span
class=SpellE>i</span> was in my closet(its as big as my room if not <span
class=SpellE>bigger..it</span> was an add on before we moved in) Well <span
class=SpellE>i</span> as on the computer and all of a <span class=SpellE>sundden</span>
<span class=SpellE>i</span> hear whispering <span class=SpellE>comin</span>
from the attic and my friends could tell u <span class=SpellE>i</span> was
freaking out and <span class=SpellE>i</span> made my friends mom come pick me
up <span class=SpellE>i</span> was so scared. I had a part one night and my
friend was over and she was the last to fall <span class=SpellE>aslepp</span>
she said she was up all night and at one point she woke me up because she heard
<span class=SpellE>somthing</span> <span class=SpellE>goin</span> up and down
the stairs and <span class=SpellE>wounld</span> stop and noises in the attic.
And we were all in my closet and it opens on its own sometimes but if you close
it you cant open it again and you get stuck inside and that <span class=SpellE>happend</span>
to us. One day about a month ago <span class=SpellE>i</span> started seeing
black and white flashes <span class=SpellE>int</span> he corner of my eyes and
when <span class=SpellE>i</span> look its stops and <span class=SpellE>i</span>
<span class=SpellE>dont</span> see it until the next day. My dog will be <span
class=SpellE>sittin</span> there in the living room and look in the walkway
behind the <span class=SpellE>recliers</span> we have and follow something like
its <span class=SpellE>walkin</span> and get up and go to the kitchen likes she
does when she is following one of us. But nothing is ever there and then she
will start to bark. I never seen any spirit but <span class=SpellE>i</span>
know there is one here. My dad was talking to a neighbor that has lived here
for years she said that a lady ran a salon in our basement and one day she <span
class=SpellE>doesnt</span> know what happened but she shot her dog and the shot
herself and <span class=SpellE>i</span> think the dog and the lady walk our
house and <span class=SpellE>mab</span> <span class=SpellE>i</span> heard her
whispering to her dog that one day in the attic.....And <span class=SpellE>i</span>
forgot one night <span class=SpellE>i</span> <span class=SpellE>dont</span> no
if it was a dream but <span class=SpellE>i</span> was awaken by a <span
class=SpellE>scratchin</span> on my closet door and <span class=SpellE>i</span>
heard boards creaking and sounds like someone throwing rocks at the wall and
ceiling. To this day <span class=SpellE>i</span> am afraid to be home alone and
the events are still happening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I worked the front desk at very early hours in the morning and I would hear <span

<span class=SpellE>experiance</span> I had was in the basement of Pierce.<span

many people have been murdered here. Either shot <span class=SpellE>upstaires</span>
or buried, in the concrete in the subbasement. I have heard many stories form
employee's and I myself have had a few experiences. One late evening as myself
and a manager were closing the building, I waited on the restaurant side to
help the bartender close down and take out the garbage. The manager went across
the complex to the office and started doing the paperwork. I escorted the
bartender out, locked the doors, and turned out most of the lights. The manager
and myself are the only people in the building. Now this place is huge 65,000
square feet. Two floors, 7 different dining rooms etc.. I walked across the
complex to help the manager do the paperwork. Finished, and took the paperwork
downstairs in the <span class=SpellE>elevator,made</span> the drop, and came
back upstairs. We walked back into the restaurant, and was blown away buy the
stench of cigars, and the smoke. We look at each other to make sure we are both
seeing and smelling the same thing. Of course we checked out what we could,
there was no source for the smoke or the smell. There <span class=SpellE>was'nt</span>
anyone even smoking a cigar that evening. There was NOWAY<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Our living room
is one long rectangular room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The couch,
at the time, was positioned to where it was right in the middle of the

one night when she woke up thinking I had just gotten home, everyone was asleep
and I was not home yet.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Instead of
seeing me; she saw a little girl in a yellow dress sitting on the living room
floor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The little girl was sitting there
watching TV.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My sister described her
with black hair, pale skin, and she was wearing a yellow dress.<span

her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>After seeing
this little girl, my sister covered her face under the blanket until she fell
back asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>So far, my
little sister has seen her twice, and heard her too.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>When I was a
girl growing up my grandmother came to live with us. She had liver <span
class=SpellE>priblems</span> and was never quite well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Grandma used to
tease my mother and tell her that when she died she would be sure to come back
and tell her what it was like on the other side and visit. Mom used to tell her
just to stay where she went and spend time with grandpa. I was just a kid and
didn't care much at this point.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Grandma passed
away when I was about 17yrs <span class=SpellE>old.She</span> died at the house
like she wanted. We <span class=SpellE>didnt</span> notice anything for about a
year. the following year I became <span class=SpellE>pregnate</span>. Still in
high school and just a kid still myself I became scared and <span class=SpellE>unsertain</span>
about my future.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Things started
to happen that year. First I had a <span class=SpellE>girlfried</span> stay
with me and she left in the middle of the night . Because she swears my
grandmother was calling my name to go eat and the whole house <span
class=SpellE>smwlled</span> of fresh tortillas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>When I spoke to
my mom about this she started to cry. She said that grandma did come back and
walks in her room all the time and bumps her <span class=SpellE>bead.Things</span>
started getting stronger to the time I was going to give birth. I was asleep in
bed when I felt <span class=SpellE>ehat</span> <span class=SpellE>i</span>
thought was my mom sit on my bed and shake my shoulder. When I sat up I saw
nothing but <span class=SpellE>coud</span> feel someone sitting on the lower
side of where I was sleeping. I sat up scared but reached out and I could feel
a figure that felt the same shape as grandma but could see nothing so I said
goodnight and laid <span class=SpellE>doum</span> with my head under the covers
till it left.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>nothing happened
for a while after that we<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>were <span
class=SpellE>hetting</span> ready to move out of this house while things were
getting packed full boxes started falling and rolling around on the ground,
lights started going on and off the <span class=SpellE>tv</span> would change
things really started to feel uneasy. It <span class=SpellE>didnt</span> feel
so friendly anymore. We were all <span class=SpellE>haveing</span> bad dreams
evil ones at that. so I started to talk to people about it. A lady at the
church I was attending asked if I had bought anything used for the baby I was <span
class=SpellE>suprised</span> but said yes all the furniture was from used
stores. She also told me that <span class=SpellE>spitits</span> can attach to
physical things like that and it might not have been grandma at all. We <span
class=SpellE>eventualy</span> called someone to bless the house before we left
.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

about a 10 foot hallway that goes right into her general room.<span

walking, sort of creeping, towards me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

vanished.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was staring directly into

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I encountered a
bully while walking home alone from my first day in 5th<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>grade.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He tried to start a fight with me for no
reason, but I kept on<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>walking, I saw
him basically everyday for the first week of school (he was a<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>6th grader from
Forest Park Middle School, which I had to walk right by to<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>get home) and he
kept tormenting me, but he was always with another kid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Finally, on the
last day of that first week, I walked past him and he was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>alone so I
confronted him, he kept trying make fun of me, and I finally<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>punched him in
the stomach.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now he really wanted to
fight me, but I figured<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>now was a good a
time as any to take the &quot;high road&quot; and I walked away. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>didn't see the
kid after that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then about 3 months
later I had a dream one<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>night that I
kept punching that bully.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The entire
dream consisted of me<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>punching him in
the face, over and over and over, but he was like one of<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>those inflatable
punching bags that is weighted on the bottom, so that every<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>time it's hit,
it always rights itself and pops back up straight.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So every<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>time I hit this
kid in my dream he would pop back up.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The next day walking<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>home from school
I saw the kid for the first time since our fight.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>that can <span
class=SpellE>easliy</span> be chalked up to <span class=SpellE>coincedence</span>
and I don't look deeply into<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>that moment, but
it stuck with me over the years and sets the tone for the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>next experiences
I had.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>When I was in
college (I went to College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, MA,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>a Jesuit
institution that was founded in the 1800's) I was sleeping up in my<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>girlfriends
apartment and I had a dream that I was at one of my high<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>school's indoor
track meets.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My old cross country coach
was there and he<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>desperately
needed me to run in the upcoming race.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
was pretty out of<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>shape compared
to when I was an athlete in high school, but I remember I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>really wanted to
help my coach out so I told him I would get ready, so I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>started
stretching, and then left the gym to go for a warm-up run, but when<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I got outside
the ground was covered in wet, slushy snow.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Now I was pissed<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>because I hadn't
run in a few years and now I had to run in this dirty,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>cold, sleet-like
snow, but I did anyways.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I woke up the
next morning early<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>to go to class
and as I was walking downstairs to my apartment, which was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the second floor
of the triple-decker we lived in, I glanced out the window<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>and outside the
ground was covered with the same wet snow as my dream.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>this isn't
unusual for New England, but this was early September (right at<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the <span
class=SpellE>begginning</span> of the school year) and the snow fall was very
unexpected,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>and I know I
didn't hear any weather forecasts pertaining to it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Kind of<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>weird.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Then in the
summer between my Junior and Senior year I was living in the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>same apartment,
and a good friend and class mate of mine suffered the loss<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>of her twin
brother.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was only 22 at the time, but
suffered a fatal heart<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>attack.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The night I heard about the news from my <span
class=SpellE>roomate</span> I had a dream that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>my friend whose
brother died, Katherine, and another friend of mine, Helen,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>were sitting on
the floor in a door way.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I walked up and
started talking to<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Katherine in a
casual way before easing into the conversation about her<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>brother, I
remember thinking this would be a better method to handle the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>situation and
keep her calm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Yet my friend Helen
started basically yelling<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>at me because I
&quot;forgot&quot; to mention the death.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I got annoyed and explained<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>right in front
of my sorrowing friend that I was easing into that <span class=SpellE>convo</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>The whole
scenario got kind of <span class=SpellE>embarrasing</span> and
uncomfortable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then the next<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>day I woke, once
again came down from my girlfriend's apartment, and was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>greeted by my <span
class=SpellE>roomate</span> telling me that Helen had called the night before
to<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>tell me that
Katherine's brother died and wanted me to call her to give my<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>condolences.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Again, nothing to crazy, but very <span
class=SpellE>coincedental</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Now that I think
about it, there might have been something up with the 3rd<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>floor apartment
where my girlfriend lived because we actually experienced<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>numerous
things.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These experiences began when we
were hanging out on my<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>floor one
evening and we heard someone walking up the main stairwell.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>was an older
house and you could <span class=SpellE>easliy</span> hear someone enter the
stairwell and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>walk up to
either the second or third floors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There
was a big, heavy<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>swinging door on
springs that squeaked when it opened and slowly swung shut<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>at the bottom of
the stairs leading outside, but on this occasion I didn't<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>notice the
noises of the door opening.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All my
girlfriend and I heard were<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>footsteps go up
to her apartment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This happened multiple
times everyday<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>whenever any of
our <span class=SpellE>roomates</span> came in our out of the house, but the
only<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>reason this time
stands out in my mind is because I started busting my girls<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>chops saying
things like &quot;What if that's a robber and he hides in your<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>kitchen
cupboards and waits for you come upstairs and we never hear him come<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>back
down!&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And matter of fact I never
did hear anyone come back down the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>stairs.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then a little after my girl went up to her
apartment to get ready<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>to go out for
the night, and she called me up there sounding very<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>nervous...no one
was in her apartment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was expecting
one of her<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:white'>roomates</span></span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>
to be home, but the place was empty.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now
the steps we heard could<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>have been a <span
class=SpellE>roomate</span> or friend and maybe we just didn't hear them leave
or<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>there is a very
slim chance they went down the back stairs, but then this<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>happened several
other times where we would hear steps on the main stairwell<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>go up to the
third floor and no one would ever be home.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We joked we had a<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>ghost, then one
afternoon my girl and one of her <span class=SpellE>roomates</span> were taking
naps<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>in their <span
class=SpellE>tv</span> room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My
girlfriend had the sensation that someone leaned over<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>her, very close
to her face, and a female voice whispered &quot;Get up.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>opened her eyes
expecting her <span class=SpellE>roomate</span> to be awake and standing there,
but<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>her <span
class=SpellE>roomate</span> was still out cold on the futon next to her.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then soon after<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>that she was
again napping in the same spot, this time alone, waiting for me<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>to come home
from class.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She had another sensation
that someone entered the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>apartment,
walked across the room, and sat down at the end of the couch by<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>her curled up
feet.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thinking it was me she didn't
react right away and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>slowly stirred
from her nap only to find no one on the couch and no one<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>home.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I came in a few minutes later and she told
what had just happened.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>am aware that
naps during the afternoon can often be very vivid and physical<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>due to the
nature of the sleep cycle at that time, but again, these<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>occurrences were
definitely weird. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Prior to me
moving off <span class=SpellE>capmus</span> to the apartment I just discussed,
I lived in<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>a dorm for the
first two years of school.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Here I also
experienced odd<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>things.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The third installment of my dream trilogy
occurred here and was the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>most poignant
one I've ever had.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The dream began with
my riding a bicycle<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>down my street
in Springfield, and like most activities in dreams requiring<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>motor skills
(running, punching, driving etc) I was having a very difficult<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>time <span
class=SpellE>peddaling</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The bike
was inching along and I was fighting to keep my<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>balance.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I finally turned onto a street two blocks
from my house and lost<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>momentum,
falling to the ground in the street.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
was in front of my good<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>friend's
grandfather's house and before I could get up and dust myself off,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>my friend's
grandfather came running out of the house and up to me, except<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>he looked very
pale, skinny, and sickly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He is a very
old man in his 90's,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>but in the dream
he was looking <span class=SpellE>exageratedly</span> sick, like a human
skeleton.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>His eyes were
very sunken and he was mumbling and fumbling his way towards<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I actually got kind of nervous and tried to
tell him I was alright and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>don't bother to
come over, because I didn't really want him near me, but he<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>came over and
kind of jerked around while standing over me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That's all I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>remember of the
dream, but then two days later I was talking to my mom and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>at the end of
the conversation she asked me to say a prayer for Doctor<o:p></o:p></span></p>

  color:white'>Murray</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:white'>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I inquired, and she
told me that on Monday he had heart failure and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>had gone into
the hospital and was still in there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
then proceeded to tell<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>my mom of the
dream I had Tuesday night where Doc Murray, my friend's<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>grandfather,
approached me looking very sick and weak and was mumbling.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>mom wanted to
know what he said to me but it was indistinguishable at the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>time.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have never dreamt of my friend's
grandfather before and I don't<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>know why I
would, but I happened to meet him in my dream the night after he<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>almost
died.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He survived and is still kicking
today, but I thought that was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>a little too <span
class=SpellE>coincedental</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>In that same
dorm room where I had the dream I just described, I experienced<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>something else
very odd.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was cleaning the room one
afternoon while my<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:white'>roomates</span></span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>
were at class.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I'm kind of a neat freak,
so I was going to town on<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the room, even
to the point of making my <span class=SpellE>roomates</span>' beds.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was standing by<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the door to the
room which was in a little enclave of the room, sectioned<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>off by the
built-in closets and the two sets of <span class=SpellE>bunkbeds</span> we
had.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>facing the wall,
throwing out some trash, when I heard a muffled thud behind<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I turned around and my attention was caught
by a ceramic dinner plate<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the floor on the other side of the <span class=SpellE>bunkbeds</span> in the

seconds before.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In fact, the plate had
been on a shelf above my<o:p></o:p></span></p>

desk, about 6ft above the ground.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was
the plate his mom had<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>delivered
cookies to us on so I knew where it was in the room, but now it<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>was just laying
there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then when I played the scenario
back in my mind I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>realized the
muffled thud I heard was consistent with the sound a ceramic<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>dinner plate
would have made if placed on the floor, which was cement with a<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>thin carpet over
it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The key word is &quot;placed&quot;
however.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is no way<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>that the plate
could have fallen from the shelf it was on and landed where<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>it was without
hitting the desk, hitting the floor, and rolling to its<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>current
spot.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And even if it did fall, the noise
it would have made would<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>have much louder
than a muffled thud, if it didn't smash into several pieces<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>from the
fall.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This moment was so peculiar that I
broke out my measuring<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>tape and took
some measurements.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Come to find out the
plate was almost<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>directly in the
middle of the room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was so intrigued
that I marked the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>spot on the rug
with a permanent marker.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nothing like
that ever happened<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>again though.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Before I go, I
would feel like I was cheating myself if I didn't describe<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the time I saw a
UFO.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now UFO has a very negative <span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>probably brings
to mind hoaxes and cooks, but I technically did see an<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Unidentified

looked over at my<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>neighbors house <span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I thought
nothing of it other than that I thought it might have been Venus<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>because it was
the brightest object in the sky.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Its
brightness wasn't<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>absurd, just
enough so that I took notice of it and its positioning in the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>sky.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>About 10 minutes after noticing the star, I
was still looking out the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>window towards
my neighbors house, when suddenly the bright object began<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>moving in a
smooth, fluid motion across the night sky in the direction of my<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>house.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was no pulsating, wiggling, vibrating,
or blinking, the object<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>just made its
way across the sky until it was out of my view.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It wasn't<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>like this UFO
was near the ground or anything, it <span class=SpellE>bascially</span> looked
like any<o:p></o:p></span></p>

look up and see day in and day out in the sky just up and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>moved clear
across the entire sky, and I don't think it could have been a<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:white'>satelite</span></span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>
because it was in the same spot for at least 10 minutes before<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>accelerating
quite quickly and abruptly through the sky.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As this was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>happening I was
describing it to my friend on the other end of the line.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>didn't know what
to say.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>That's about it
for now, but I'm waiting for the next time some<o:p></o:p></span></p>

class=SpellE>so..it's</span> not so much a ghost story I <span class=SpellE>guess..but</span>
it is <span class=SpellE>kinda</span> creepy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>It was earlier
this year, perhaps March or so, when I was downstairs on my <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>computer.(Hate
having the computer in the basement)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
was talking to a few <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>internet
friends, when I started hearing odd music coming from the other side of <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the basement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Now let me
describe my basement. One light more near me, while the other side <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>is pretty dark.
There's a door that is locked, and I know we never go in <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>there, or use
the room that the door <span class=SpellE>is..at</span>. I think it's just
pipes and stuff in <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>there though. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>The music was
coming from inside the room, from where I could hear it anyway.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Oh, but this
gets even more <span class=SpellE>cliche</span>. No one was home either. My
brother and <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>sister out, and
my mom and dad out as well. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>So, I got up
slowly to check it out, but as I got to my washer machine, which <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:white'>is..oh</span></span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>..
5 or 7 feet away from the door/room, it stopped. So I hurried back <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>to my computer
to relate my tale to the four or five friends I was talking to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>But it started
up again soon, and I ignored it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>It was then that
my parent's also came home. I called up a 'hello!' as I <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>usually did, and
listened as my mother came down the stairs to check on the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>clothing in the
washer and dryer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Now remember,
the music was still going as she walked down the stairs, so I <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>stood, and went
to meet her, asking, 'Did you hear it, did you hear it?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>As I got up, and
met her, the music had stopped, and she gave me a weird <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>look, asking,
'Did I hear what?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>She never heard
it, so I wonder if it was really there, or if I was just <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Hi there.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was just checking out your amazing site and
I decided to send my experience to you.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Could you please post it on the site for me?!?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I also welcome any comments or questions you
may have.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Here is my experience plus a
footnote at the bottom.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thanks a bunch. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>One night I had
this very strange experience and to this day I still don't understand why it
happened.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All my life, I have had
experiences, but this one was by far the strangest and scariest one for
me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It happened a few months ago, I
can't remember the exact date.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>We have
our computer on a chair so I can lay on the bed while I am online and the <span
class=SpellE>tv</span> on a stand next to that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I'm telling you this now so you can understand where things are when I
tell you in the story.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One night I was
playing games on the computer with my husband asleep behind me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After awhile I started seeing orbs or rods
flying around out of the corner of my eyes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I could also feel where they went through me leaving my skin icy cold.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I just continued playing on the computer
since I knew they were harmless.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>About
an hour later I saw 2 white shadow figures; human shaped.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One was standing behind the computer, the
other behind the <span class=SpellE>tv</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I didn't feel threatened so I left them alone.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After a while I started getting a real
nervous feeling and then I started seeing a black shadow hand reaching for me
between the computer and the <span class=SpellE>tv</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The hand was coming from the white shadow
that was behind the <span class=SpellE>tv</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Whenever I would look at the hand, it would
snap back like I had caught it red handed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I got really scared so I put on a movie for the light and the
noise.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It seemed to calm me down a
bit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After the movie finished, I <span
class=SpellE>rned</span> off the <span class=SpellE>tv</span> and continued
playing games on the computer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After
awhile I started seeing the orbs and rods again and again I could feel where
they would fly right through me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Almost
instantly I started feeling nervous again so I turned on the <span
class=SpellE>tv</span> and watched movies until morning.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The next morning I got my husband ready for
work and after he left, I went back to bed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>After a while I felt nervous again and I felt something force its way
into my body.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The real nervous feelings
had already woken me up by that time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
could feel where the thing had taken over my body and I could see the world through
its eyes and everything looked like a blur.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I was there, but I wasn't there all at the same time.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I felt extreme confusion which quickly
escalated into anger.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I tried to talk,
but my mouth wouldn't move.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I tried to
move, but I couldn't.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I felt like I was
glued to the bed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In my mind, I was
asking Jesus for help and yelling at myself to say it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then I remember that I slowly opened my mouth
and said, &quot;In the name of God, I command you to leave and go back to
Hell.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I got really scared as it
was not my voice that came out of my mouth, but a mans voice; very deep in
sound. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>After saying and hearing the
words, I felt the thing leave my body and the room got warm again.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then it felt real peaceful and I was able to
get some sleep. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Footnote:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>When the
experience was over, I thought maybe that my voice was normal and that I heard
a mans voice due to being really scared, but my brother-in-law heard it as well
and even asked me if my husband had decided to stay home from work that
day.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This isn't the first time that a
spirit has used my body to try and communicate, but it has never been <span
class=SpellE>frightning</span> before this experience.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I'm hoping it will be the last time that ever
happens.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you would like to comment or
have any questions to ask, you can email me at asera6@yahoo.com.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thank you for reading my experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>they don't

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>It was a dark

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>beautifully, and
it was a full moon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>It wasn't a very

we were wearing nothing more than a pair of jeans and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>a short sleeve
shirt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was asleep on the couch and I was watching MTV.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>blanket for
Luke, and put on one of his <span class=SpellE>hoodies</span>. I felt very
uneasy<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>upstairs. Being
inside in general felt quite uneasy, also.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

for a cigarette, and it was rather warm out for a<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>winter night, so
I'd taken the <span class=SpellE>hoodie</span> off. I sparked up a cigarette<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>and I just sat
outside there for a while, Luke woke up during Beavis<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>And Butthead and
came outside to have a cigarette also. We both<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Butthead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Luke went up
stairs to bed, where my bag was just outside the doorway<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>as Luke watching
his TV. I went outside for one last cigarette before<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I turned in for
the night, and I could see his door handle moving from<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>his window. (He
has blinds, which were parted on this particular<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>evening)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I went back
inside and <span class=SpellE>layed</span> down on the couch kind of
half-watching<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the TV. That's
when I first started hearing the voices. It sounded<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>like a boy..
maybe 10 years old, maybe a little older. He asking for<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>help. At first
he called out &quot;Hello?&quot; and then started saying &quot;Help<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>me&quot; a bunch
of times.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was pretty freaked out, so I
tried to ignore<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>it. His voice
developed a kind of worried, scared tone, and he<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>frantically
started asking for help, to which point I replied with a<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>simple
&quot;What...?&quot; During my asking what he wanted, he kind of yelped<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>and groaned,
there was a thud, and I could hear footsteps trailing<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>towards the
stairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>There was
another voice. This time it was a man's. He was saying<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>things like
&quot;I'm going to get you, and you'll be sorry once I'm<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>through with
you.&quot; I could then hear a girl's voice, practically<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>screaming at the
top of her lungs. I dashed up the stairs as quickly<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>as I could to
check on Luke, and the voices and the screaming stopped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I checked in
Luke's bedroom, and he seemed to be asleep (although had<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>his head under
the blankets, so I couldn't really tell). I walked back<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>downstairs and
propped myself on the couch again. The voices had<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>returned. The
girl was screaming again, and there was another thud,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>then silence.
The sound of footsteps echoed down the hallway and down<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the stairs, then
vanished into silence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>In the morning,
when Luke and I had both woken up, we were outside<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>having a
cigarette.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Luke started
discussing what he had heard last night, and soon enough<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>my eyes lit up
and he knew that I knew exactly what he was talking<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>about.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>It was an

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My husband and I
bought this house in Fontana, California near the Mary B. Lewis school. We had
never believed in ghost. We bought the house in 1995, the first week we moved
in I was sitting in the living room with my husband and we both heard a loud
crashing sound in the kitchen. When we went to see if something had fell on the
floor, there was nothing there. That was the beginning, we went to bed and I woke
up by the sound of chanting coming from the living room, it sound like a lot of
little bell like sounds, like when you run your finger around a wine glass, but
<span class=SpellE>maginfied</span>. I went to go see what it was and I seen a
bunch of flickering lights. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, so I woke up
my husband and he seen them too. We thought that we had to have the house
blessed by a priest, so we did. And things just got worse. We would hear
running late at night in the back yard, there would be nothing there. We even
called the police they didn't find no one. Then I went into the garage one
morning and it was freezing cold, it was summer time and it was 90 degrees
outside, and in black substance the words &quot;BURN IN HELL&quot; were written
big on the floor, my husband tried everything to wash it out, even gasoline, it
just <span class=SpellE>disappared</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>on its own. We thought someone was just trying to scare us at first, but
one day I was talking to my mother on the phone and a horrible, demonic voices
were speaking at the same time, my mother heard also, and I only had one phone
in the house and so did my mother. It keep saying &quot;whore <span
class=SpellE>whore</span>, die whore, and laughing. My mother started crying
and told me to get out of the house and wait for her to come for me, my husband
was at work and this was in the day. I was sick to my stomach, just to remember
makes me feel scared as I write this. In one the bedrooms we heard banging we
went to see and there was brownish stuff dripping from the ceiling and on the
walls, my dad came to check in the attic to see if we had a leek, and there was
nothing there. The dogs would cry and <span class=SpellE>houl</span> at night,
It got so bad I couldn't sleep and I thought I was going crazy, but there were
so many wittiness. I couldn't understand why this was happening. One day the
neighbor across the street came when I was in the yard watering the grass, she
asked me if I had heard any strange noises in the house, and I didn't know if I
should tell her, so I just said &quot;no why would you ask&quot;? And she said
that the people that lived there were devil worshippers and that there was a
rumor that they had <span class=SpellE>sacrified</span> their 16 year olds baby
in one of the bedrooms and that it got out of control. And they just moved out
and moved to another state. We never meet the people that lived their they were
out of state. So when we bought the house everything was through our <span
class=SpellE>realitor</span> and <span class=SpellE>faxes.Any</span> ways, I
thought &quot; why didn't this lady come and tell me this when we were looking
at the house. I told my husband I wanted to put the house for sale. We did, the
house sold on three different times. When it was time to close escrow for no <span
class=SpellE>unknow</span> reason the buyers just backed out at the last
moment. I was so scared, I would not stay in the house alone, I started to get
very sick, I tried to kill myself, I slit my wrist. I was just so depressed and
scared, because I couldn't sleep because of the banging and chatting that would
go on every night. One morning the neighbor that lived next to us, came and
asked me if we had a man living with us. I told her no that no one lived with
us. She said that she had seen me and my husband leave, and a few minutes after
we left she heard a mans voice screaming and cussing and heard very loud bangs
coming from in the house. She asked if I heard the dogs crying the night before
and I told her yes, she said that she got up and<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>looked out her back window and she seen a
huge black shadow pass <span class=SpellE>throught</span> our wooden fence and
that her dogs just laid down as it passed by. And that it went to through her
backyard. I was trying to sell the house, so I told her I had never heard
anything in the house like that. There was so many things that happened to
people that would come visit, that they would leave terrified. If we were
listening to the radio, The demonic force would turn the volume all the way up
and change the station. My sister-in-law stayed in the room with the blood
stains, and she was a woken the something breathing on her face, she said she
was getting up to turn on the light and she saw a small door open, and that it
was just pitch black , but that she could hear horrible sounds coming from
within the small door. She was so scared that she called her brother to come
pick her up, it was 3am when she left. We ended up just leaving the house one
night at 1am, we never went back, I gave all my furniture to the <span
class=SpellE>neigbors</span>. And we would not even go by that street ever
again. We lost our material things, but <span class=SpellE>thats</span> how bad
the demonic spirits got. We have been <span class=SpellE>courious</span> and
have gone on line to see who owns the <span class=SpellE>house,and</span> ever
person with in a year has lost it, and now it belongs to the government, for
public housing. It was chilling to see that it is still going on. I never
reported anything about this, because I didn't think the <span class=SpellE>authories</span>
would believe me. My mother said I should have some people that do
investigation on hauntings, but I didn't know how to go about it, and I was
more concerned about leaving there and never ever going back. This is not
something made up, this really did happen, and there are people who <span
class=SpellE>wittinessed</span> some of the most horrible things that happen in
that house. I thought My husband and I would grow old in that house together,
but what happened there almost cost us are marriage, and our <span
class=SpellE>lifes</span>. I do now believe in ghost, or demons and they can
wreck <span class=SpellE>havick</span> on peoples lives.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>During my
younger years, I vividly remember that two of my sisters used to collect
porcelain masks, which were hung on their walls. One of them bought a mask,
which I remember being very creepy looking. The night that she bought it she
had a dream that someone wearing the mask was trying to kill her. Feeling
uneasy by this, she gave the mask to my sister without mentioning why she was
giving it away. That night, with the mask being hung in my other sister's room,
my other sister had the exact same dream. She told my oldest sister about the
dream, and that's when she came clean that she had had the exact same dream.
They took the mask out to the sidewalk and smashed it with a hammer. After
that, the dreams stopped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My sister told
me about this one, and being fairly <span class=SpellE>religous</span>, she
doesn't make up stories like these. She was married with a three year old
daughter. Her husband worked nights, leaving her and her daughter home alone
nearly every night. Several times a week, she would walk out to the front room
to find that the ceiling fan was turned on. Because this was during the winter
season, they never turned it on. You had to pull a cord <span class=SpellE>attatched</span>
to the fan to turn it on, which proves that they're daughter could not have
turned it on. Also, my sister was awakened one morning by her daughter trying
to open the front door, yelling &quot;Come back, come back!&quot;. Because she
was so young, it was hard to understand exactly what she was saying, but she
said that she had been painting with an older man when he suddenly got up and
left. My grandfather, who died many years ago, enjoyed painting with his
children when they were younger, according to my grandmother.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

suddenly I awoke. I felt a strong presents and it felt very evil. The next
thing I see a spirit pass me rubbing two of his fingers on my body while I was
laying down as he passed me. I did not see his face because I was to frightened
to look but I can tell it was a man. I was so frightened that I got up, turn on
my lamp, looked to see if he was still there. I could not see him anymore but I
could still feel his presents. So I ran out of my house, got into my car, drove
off and did not return home till the next day. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I sent you guys
a couple of stories back in 97 or 98, a story from when I was pretty young and
another from around that time. I had a couple of things happen to me back in
2000 and 2001, but I havent gotten around to letting you guys know about it
until now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>At the time, I
was working as a sports copy editor for the newspaper here. I was living with
one of the sports writers in a tri-level, triplex. Its on a lot with another
just like it. Its a few blocks from the heart of downtown, so it was probably
built sometime between 1910 and 1920. The place itself is pretty cool, and two
of the other apartments were occupied by fellow journalists, so we had some pretty
wild complex parties. Each of the apartments have identical floor plans. The
front door opens into a large living area with hardwood floors. The living
areas open into a small dining room that connect them with a small kitchen. The
kitchens have a back door that opens into the courtyard and a door on the
opposite side that open to the stairs that lead to large basements. The living
area also opens to a staircase  that runs parallel to the length of the living
area  that leads directly to the only bathroom. At the top of and to the left
of the top of the staircase are two bedrooms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I won a coin
flip for the bedroom that faces the front of the complex. It is considerably
larger than the other, has a walk-in closet and two large windows, one of which
opens to the front of the complex.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Ive always been
a little sensitive when it comes to whatever the hell is going on beyond the
dimension we live in. I certainly dont like it, but theres not a lot I can do
about it. This being the case, I had some reservations about moving into a
place so old and that obviously would have a lot of history, but it was such a
cool setup for a guy in his mid-20s with a pretty good job, a borderline
self-destructive obsession with partying and nothing to tie me down except an
at-the-time dying relationship with a girl I had been dating a few years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>The first six
months or so were somewhat of a blur. Myself and a couple of sports writers
would religiously end up at local bar after our shifts ended at midnight, drink
until about 2 a.m. and head over to the place to play darts or play poker. I
wasnt really paying much attention to my surroundings. But one night early in
the spring, I had one of those dreams that almost wake you up but leave you
somewhere in between the first and second levels of consciousness. Ive battled
these for years, but I usually get them as Im drifting off to sleep. This
night, it semi-woke me from a pretty sound slumber. I was aware that I was
trying to wake up but couldnt. I tried to move my hands and arms, anything to
try to break out of the purgatory state. After struggling with it for a few
moments, I snapped out of it and realized I was half-moaning, half-yelling. My
original thought was that I hoped it didnt wake my roommate, because I didnt
want him to think I was some kind of a weirdo. My second thought  or feeling 
was that I was not alone in the room. I glanced around toward the closet and
saw nothing. The feeling was still there. I laid back down facing the wall to
the left of the bed. It was a double bed and wasnt large enough to sleep two
comfortably. As I laid there talking myself down from the situation, I swear to
God I felt the full length of a body lay itself down behind me. I could tell
whatever it was <span class=SpellE>was</span> facing the same direction I was
because as it climbed into the bed, I could feel its knee hit the bed first,
its upper body come to rest and its legs sprawl out behind me. I try to posture
myself as a little bit of a tough guy  not a meathead or anything  by
participating in manly (sorry about the sexist undertones) type activities,
cussing a lot and openly sharing with most of the people in my life the filthy
thoughts I generate, but in this instance I couldnt even muster the courage to
turn around and see what was laying behind me. I couldnt get up. I just closed
my eyes until my alarm went off a few hours later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>The scenario did
not repeat itself, so after a couple of months I just chalked it up to all the
drinking Id been doing. Shortly after that, I had another experience. It
started exactly the same way. I semi-woke into the same purgatory state. But
this time, as I was struggling to wake up completely, I could feel what I can
only describe as hands pushing on my chest, almost like someone was about to
perform CPR. I again woke up moaning and yelling, and the first thing I saw was
a smooth, almost black figure leaning over me from the left side of the bed,
still with its hands pressing on my chest. I just stared up at it. I wanted to
swing my arms at it or twist my body around to shake free from it, but my body
felt like it was made of stone. I dont know how long I stared at it  it felt
like 10 or 15 seconds  but Ill bet it was more like three or four. It pulled
its hands back and spun around like it was about to dart through the wall and
it disappeared. Needless to say, I did not sleep alone in that room again. I
staked out a place on the couch for the next year or so, until things started
to get serious with my then girlfriend and now wife and I moved out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Ive grown up a
lot since then. My wife and I seldom party, I went back to school and finished
my degree and have become a typical, happy working stiff. We bought a beautiful
house that was built in 1951, and so far I have nothing but love for the place.
Throughout the process of cleaning up my life, Ive done a lot of reflecting on
the things that happened in that room. I can still remember how the body felt
crawling into my bed, and I can still vividly picture whatever it was that
molested me in my sleep. I often wonder if they were guilt-driven dreams or
hallucinations brought on by the debauchery of my lifestyle, for I am a good
person who doesnt feel to good about many of the things Ive done. I just
dont know what they were for sure. The one thing I cant get over is the
physical makeup of the latter what-have-you. It was expressionless and I could
make out nothing but its dark contours. But there was something about its
presence  and physical size and body shape  that reminded me of myself. I
cant explain this aspect of it clearly, so I wont try. Its just a strange
feeling I get when I think about it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>4 years ago my
dad was dying of cancer and he was my star my best friend and a very loving
dad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>4 days before dad
died (which at the time <span class=SpellE>i</span> didn't no that) my mum
asked me to look after dad while she went shopping, this <span class=SpellE>i</span>
did and now looking back <span class=SpellE>i</span> am so happy that <span
class=SpellE>i</span> did. I was watching TV when dad said look there is <span
class=SpellE>shelley,she</span> is asking me to go with her, <span
class=SpellE>i</span> must say <span class=SpellE>shelley</span> is my 17 year
old daughter but she was one of a twin which <span class=SpellE>i</span> lost
when <span class=SpellE>i</span> was 2mths pregnant, <span class=SpellE>i</span>
never told my family about my lost, so when dad said this <span class=SpellE>i</span>
felt a bit out of sorts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I asked dad what
is she doing now and he said she was holding her arms out and saying come on
granddad come on. <span class=SpellE>i</span> thought it best to change the
subject, <span class=SpellE>i</span> left dad that day. 3 days later dad was
taken into hospital, he had all the family around him but <span class=SpellE>i</span>
thought it best that my daughter did not come as she was only 12 at the time, <span
class=SpellE>i</span> was holding dads hand when he was looking a bit confused <span
class=SpellE>i</span> asked what was the matter and he said to &quot;is it time
to go yet&quot; <span class=SpellE>i</span> was very upset and said no not and
with he looked pass me and said to ever was there &quot;no not yet&quot; <span
class=SpellE>i</span> asked dad who was he talking to and he said Shelley which
of course it was not her. To this day <span class=SpellE>i</span> really do
think that my unborn child helped my dad over to the over to the side which <span
class=SpellE>i</span> feel very humble and happy to no the dad is still being
loved has he was on earth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>anybody has any
answers or suggestions as to what might have been going on. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I rented a house
with two other young ladies in the city of Yucaipa, CA in a<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>neighborhood
called Rolling Hills. This was not an old house, it was built<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>in 1994 and only
had one family live in it and nobody died or anything. It<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>backed up to a
ravine that led to a large state park so it wasn't exactly<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>rural either. I
have done some research on the area and haven't found any<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>documented
evidence of other people having experiences in the neighborhood.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Anyways, we
moved in the house in October of 2003, and the weekend after we<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>moved in I was
home alone on a Saturday, and about 3 in the afternoon I felt<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>like taking a
nap. My room faced the street and was above the garage. I left<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the light on and
was out in a few minutes. I Had a dream that I was lying in<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>that room, on my
bed in the dark and that there was a person on the bed with<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>me, but they
were on their knees and they were moving, almost crawling over<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>me and the
person came above me, with one hand on either side of me and put<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>their face very
close to mine while making a hideous hissing sound. I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>remember in the
dream that the person was almost zombie-like. ( I attribute<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>this to watching
a zombie type movie earlier in the day) but I woke up<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>screaming. I
have never done that in my life. Things got a little more<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>interesting
after that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My roommate
would hear the door in the room next to her ( a playroom ) open<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>and shut in the
night. This bothered her so much that she started locking<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the door to get
it to stop. We would hear dishes clanging in the kitchen<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>when we are
upstairs and home alone. We would sit on the patio to smoke and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the way the
porch light faced it left a side of the house completely black<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>with darkness.
We were having a cigarette and talking when I saw smoke, like<o:p></o:p></span></p>

smoking and we were the only ones out there. needless to say<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>we got scared
and went inside. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Dave laid the

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>What I am about
to recount is an experience that will keep me away from any house.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But first, allow me to tell you about
myself.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I am a 24 year old native of Las
Vegas.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I am also a <span class=SpellE>wiccan</span>
priest, and one of the youngest people to achieve the priesthood.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have had extensive dealings with spirits
and ghosts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I seem to be extremely
&quot;in tune&quot; to them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I am in no
way, shape, or form, frightened when I come across paranormal beings.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, that changed with one misguided
youthful excursion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My family moved
out of Vegas to a small town 60 miles southwest called Sandy Valley.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is a small old mining and bootlegging
town that is literally out in the middle of nowhere.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I was 16, some friends and I thought it
would be fun to ditch the hour and half bus ride to school and hang out with my
girlfriend.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So we did.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Two friends and I got off the bus and walked
to my girlfriend's house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We woke her
up, and started playing childish games.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Around noon, we had gotten bored, so we began to look for something new
and interesting to do.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That was when we
saw the abandoned house on the property next door.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Obviously, most of us said, &quot;Let's go
check that house out!&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
automatically had a bad feeling about it, and so did one of my friends.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the majority rules.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>As we made our
way to the house, jumping fences, dodging bushes, etc., I kept saying that I
didn't like the feeling of the area.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
had one person backing me up, therefore, I had no say.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>When my friends
made it into the house, they started fooling around in the living area.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is a room that is fairly large, with
kitchen and dining area being the same.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There was graffiti on the walls and most of the windows were busted out.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To the left of the main entrance was a narrow
hallway with two side by side bedrooms and one bathroom.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That hallway was dark, except for minimal
light shining through the bedroom windows.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My friend and I
were the last ones to enter and we watched the fools screwing around for a
second.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then I started looking down the
hallway.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The hair on my body stood on
end, and I felt deathly cold.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That was
when I saw a jet black figure step out of the bathroom, into the hallway.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I froze in place, all that I could feel from
this spirit was just plain, outright, evil.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It flooded over me like a wave.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The spirit stopped, then it just turned it's head and stared right at
me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I could feel that it was aiming to
do horrific things to me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I turned to my
friend, and saw that he was looking at the spirit also.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He looked at me with a pale face and said,

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>One of my
experiences happened when <span class=SpellE>i</span> was around 14.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At that time I lived an a 100 year old<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>house that
resided across the street from a cemetery.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Before moving in here we all herd the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>stories the old
lady that lived here would talk about.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Most people just thought she was crazy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Well the house
was old so you always herd noises, like floors creaking<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>cupboard doors
opening and much more.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But with all that
you still pretty much let it go.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Except one night
my sister was complaining about a cold draft that would go through <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>her room and
blow things on her wall.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Well the only
way into my sister room was an <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>old back
stairwell that led to a root cellar that was hidden or through my room. (house
was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>built <span

night the door between our rooms start to shake and the knob <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>move like
someone was opening it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I just thought
it was my sister she slept walked in this<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>house all the
time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I waited for her to come in my
room but she didn't, finally the door slowly<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>creaked open and
it was not her it was a boy dressed in all white wearing a blue baseball<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>hat he just
stared at me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I quickly threw the

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>morning.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Hello. I am
Megan, a thirteen-year-old girl with a few comments. I have seen in other areas
that this might be important, I am a Baptist Christian and have not prayed to
force the feeling away.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I read your
Children and ghosts column, and thought I might share a few things, mainly
about my brother, but one particular item of interest about me and my history.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My Grandmother
has the power to <span class=SpellE>communitcate</span> to Spirits. She also
feels when one is around. Yes, some in my family call her talents &quot;<span
class=SpellE>Zooloo</span>&quot; powers, but I actually believe them. At night
while laying in my bed, the feeling of someone watching me is always over
whelming. I am too afraid to look around, in fear of actually seeing a spirit.
I simply lay there in fear, afraid that something will touch me. Yes, I am a
chicken.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have felt this since I was
very young, and in turn have slept in bed with my mother until the age of
twelve. I have never actually seen a ghost, which leads onto my beloved
brother.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My brother is
six-years-old, and named Spencer. He is extremely sweet and a bit feminine. He
also has Audio Processing Disorder, and a horrible lisp. He has &quot;an
imaginary friend&quot; named Jackson. I played along, pretending to prepare a
seat at dinner for Jackson one night. I giggled as I thought I was playing with
my brother's imagination. As I sat down, my dog started growling at the chair.
Spencer glared and turned around, yelling &quot;No bark at him!&quot; I raised
my eyebrow, and glanced at the chair. The green cushion was pushed in at the
middle, as if someone sat on it. I made a small noise and jumped out, causing
the lump to <span class=SpellE>dissappear</span>. Spencer looked confused and
glanced at me. &quot;Where'd my friend go?&quot; I glanced to the dog and saw
her sleeping peacefully on the floor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My mother is not
helpful at this and one of those who, as you say, block out the thought of
ghosts at a young age. We have decided against telling her. Many more incidents
have <span class=SpellE>occured</span> with Jackson, especially my current
medication to be opened and waiting on me when I walk down the stairs. (I'm
having to take five pills for an infection.) My mother would scold me, and tell
me not to prepare them the night before. I go along with it, apologizing. I
simply asked Jackson, &quot;Please wait and don't do this for me.&quot; It had
stopped and the medication is only set out if I am either running late or have
forgotten to take it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>hi there, and
thanks for a job well done!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>A few years ago,
I was living in Prague, Czech Republic. I was lucky enough to find an apartment
in the &quot;old town&quot; in the castle grounds. The houses in this area are
some of the oldest, and thus they do not even have numbered addresses, but
pictures. Mine address was &quot; at the two gold stars&quot;, and<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>it's backyard faces<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>a monastery that houses an amazing secular
library. (apparently during the reformation it and it's monks were saved from
death because of the extent of the library's secular <span class=SpellE>signifigance</span>
to the city).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>OK, enough
background history... well it was winter, and I had just finished my third week
in the flat. Now I must mention that as a child I would go sleep walking, and
even be able to reply when talked to, this doesn't occur as frequently now, but
sometimes when I am under <span class=SpellE>alot</span> of stress, it will
still <span class=SpellE>happen.there</span> is a similar thing that happens,
and that is like I am sleep walking, but I am in bed, and it is rather like
being somewhere between awake and asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>hat night I went
to sleep in a normal matter, but soon had a dream that seemed to take place in
that between place. I was wandering around my flat lost.. the hallway was
suddenly many <span class=SpellE>labrynthine</span> hallways and a little man
in a satiny <span class=SpellE>rosed</span> hued monk's cowl with a bell on the
end of it was leading me around these hallways by the hand. He was no taller
than three feet and looked a bit like a <span class=SpellE>cort</span> jester,
or punch from punch and <span class=SpellE>judy</span>- <span class=SpellE>fame..a</span>
hooked nose and chin. He hopped up and down as he led me around, laughing in a
very high pitched way. I felt he was trying to confuse me, get me lost.
Suddenly the hallway opened up into a red lit train platform. We were on one
side, and a large writhing mass was on the other. He seemed to get very excited
about this and started hopping even more irately... &quot; and then he said in
his high pitched way, &quot; This is were the souls get off, this is were the
souls get off&quot;. Upon closer inspection the writhing mass looked like a
huge head with a huge pulsating brain. But looking even closer it was made up
of writhing, naked people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I awoke in the
hall of my flat wandering around, still lost, and confused. It took a bit for
me to <span class=SpellE>realise</span> I was awake and doing this. That was
actually more frightening than what I had seen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>It was only
later, from the lady that lived upstairs did I find out that not only was this
the oldest [art of settled land in Prague, it was also early on, in the 8th
century, part of the chambers for the monks from the monastery. <span
class=SpellE>Infact</span>, the summer before I moved in, The backyard was dug
up to make way for a patio, and the Ukrainian workers <span class=SpellE>atared</span>
digging up remains of the monks. They had used the backyard for their <span
class=SpellE>cemetary</span>. What's more, is that spring I was in the National
library and came across an old illustration in a book of my little friend. He
was leading an elderly lady off a country road into the dark woods.......<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Thanks for
letting me share! It was so <span class=SpellE>so</span> strange and If anyone
has any similar experiences or knows something of this type of character, I'd
greatly <span class=SpellE>apreciated</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

spoke to me and said..&quot; take care of your mom and do what she says and be

paranormal experiences, but this one sticks out in my mind by far. In 2000 my
grandma died or a brain aneurysm. We brought here to her house on hospice and
she died in the bedroom she lived in for over 50 years. When she was alive, me
and my brother would often stay at her house. The sleeping arrangements
consisted of me sleeping in my grandma's bed and my brother sleeping in a small
cot next to the bed. When we were going to sleep she would sit in her rocking
chair in the opposite corner of the room and watch us fall asleep. After she
died my Aunt and Uncle bought the house and moved in. In 2002, me and my
brother were spending the night while my parents were out of town. We were in
our usual arrangements and I never realized that I was sleeping in the very
spot where my grandmother died. We had just gone to bed and we heard the floor
boards creaking outside the room. We just figured that it was our uncle or
aunt, until we heard them talking in the kitchen on the other side of the
house. The creaking then proceeded to move into the bedroom and the rocking
chair where my grandma always watched us fall asleep started moving back and
forth in grandma's usual rhythm. Needless to say, we were pretty freaked out
until we realized it was just grandma watching us fall to sleep one last time.
My brother and I never got a final goodbye from her and we figured that this
was it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>When I was 6 or
7 my grandma was sick of cancer. And slept in my room. My dogs were acting
really strange when she was going outside. But when my grandma died the dogs
were really crying. When they took my grandma away, my Mom took off my grandmas
husband picture off the wall and the dogs came inside the house and started to
bark at the picture that really freaked me and my family. Now my grandma is
still around my house even when I am sleeping. I do see her sitting down at the
chair or maybe sitting next to me at bed when I go to sleep. But I know that
she is protecting me from everything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
