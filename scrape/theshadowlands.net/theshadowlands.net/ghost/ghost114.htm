<p><b>I have had several ghost experiences but the one I am writing about
happened</b>
<br><b>when I was about sixteen. We lived in a very rural area in a big
tri-level</b>
<br><b>house. The bedrooms and on bathroom were on the top floor, a small
bedroom, a</b>
<br><b>bathroom, the kitchen, and a huge living/dining room were on the
second and</b>
<br><b>the bottom floor was a two car garage. The master bedroom on the
top floor</b>
<br><b>had once had it's own deck and still had the sliding door which
now leads to</b>
<br><b>a sixteen foot drop to the backyard. It is important to know this
because</b>
<br><b>often we would hear someone knocking on that door even when we had
the blinds</b>
<br><b>open and could see there wasn't anyone there. The stairs from the
second</b>
<br><b>floor to the third went straight half way to a landing then turned
right and</b>
<br><b>went up the rest of the way. on the landing on your left if you
were going</b>
<br><b>upstairs was a picture window. I was standing at the top of the
stairs one</b>
<br><b>afternoon calling my two younger brothers. The youngest,Lee,came
to the</b>
<br><b>bottom of the stairs and asked what I wanted-he and Chris were getting
a</b>
<br><b>snack. I was going to answer him when I felt a hard shove against
my</b>
<br><b>shoulders. I fell down the stairs to the landing. My brother raced
up the</b>
<br><b>stairs to the landing calling our other brother. I stood up with
Lee's help.</b>
<br><b>Since I was OK I shrugged it off as an accident and forgot. Weeks
later my</b>
<br><b>brother was in the house by himself. He was coming downstairs [I
could see</b>
<br><b>him through the window] and he tumbled down the stairs to the landing.
He</b>
<br><b>swore someone pushed him. But he an I were the only ones home and
he had been</b>
<br><b>the only one inside. The next day [stupid kids that we were] we
decided to</b>
<br><b>test it. Lee stood at the bottom of the stairs, Chris stood outside
and</b>
<br><b>watched through the window and I [really stupid, OK] stood at the
top. I felt</b>
<br><b>something push me and I started to fall again. I caught myself on
the rail</b>
<br><b>and was standing, something I couldn't see was trying to pull my
hands off</b>
<br><b>the rail! I got up and ran down the stairs in record time. Chris
said he</b>
<br><b>couldn't see anything but Lee swore he saw a shadow chase me from
the landing</b>
<br><b>down to the second floor. After that none of us would go down the
stairs</b>
<br><b>alone and we always ran. For some reason they wouldn't tell us our
parents</b>
<br><b>decided to move only six months after we started living in that
house.</b>

<p><b>Floating Woman</b>

<p><b>Ever since I was a little girl I've seen things or felt things.&nbsp;
I haven't</b>
<br><b>decided if I follow the feelings and spirits&nbsp; or if they follow
me.&nbsp; When I</b>
<br><b>was 7 I lived in a huge farm house.&nbsp; I was awaken one night
by a cold feeling</b>
<br><b>on my cheek.&nbsp; Almost like someone was placing their hand and
just brushing it</b>
<br><b>against my cheek.&nbsp; I sat up in bed and looked around expecting
it to be my</b>
<br><b>sister trying to wake me up.&nbsp; Instead I was greeted with an
empty room.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>tried to fall asleep all night and couldn't.&nbsp; For weeks I refused
to sleep on</b>
<br><b>my own room and stayed with my parents.&nbsp; About a month later
I was back to</b>
<br><b>sleeping in my room and was awakend again but this time by the closing
of the</b>
<br><b>side door downstairs.&nbsp; I thought it was my father coming home
late so I</b>
<br><b>walked into the hallway.&nbsp; What greeted me on the stairss still
scares the</b>
<br><b>daylights out of me today.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I got to the stairs, a lady that I had never
seen before was walking</b>
<br><b>up the stairs, or so I thought.&nbsp; But when i looked closer I
reliezed that the</b>
<br><b>woman was floating up the stairs.&nbsp; SHe wore I dark brown skir
and a white</b>
<br><b>blouse covered by a jacket.&nbsp; The white blouse had been stained
red in a few</b>
<br><b>places.&nbsp; When I squinted my eyes to try and get a better look
at the blurred</b>
<br><b>image I saw that the womans face was battered and covered in blood.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>frozen in my tracks and unabvle to move I just stood there.&nbsp;

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hi everyone - as promised, here is the next story...</b><b></b>
<p><b>In my last anecdote, I introduced you to my mother's</b>
<br><b>family, the Sorensons, who lived in East London, South</b>
<br><b>Africa, during the first half of this century.&nbsp; In</b>
<br><b>fact, most of the family members remaining alive at</b>
<br><b>this time are still living in East London (although a</b>
<br><b>few have also moved to other cities in the country).</b>
<br><b>Families were, in those days, much larger than they</b>
<br><b>are now-a-days and my mother's family, which had</b>
<br><b>twelve children, was not unusual.</b><b></b>
<p><b>This story concerns one of my mother's brothers,</b>
<br><b>Nigel, who was, for some reason, nicknamed "Boy".&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>have always known this story for as long as I can</b>
<br><b>remember but, two weeks ago, I formally interviewed my</b>
<br><b>mother in order to obtain all the details so that I</b>
<br><b>could "report" it on the Shadowlands' page.&nbsp; Before I</b>
<br><b>start the story proper, let me give you just a little</b>
<br><b>background on my family.&nbsp; My maternal grandmother's</b>
<br><b>name was Mina but I was, however, never fortunate</b>
<br><b>enough to meet her, as she died some years before I</b>
<br><b>was born. She and my maternal grandfather, Chris, did,</b>
<br><b>however, instill in all their sons and daughters a</b>
<br><b>deep and abiding belief of all things spiritual and</b>
<br><b>religious, and the whole family were stauch Catholics.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My mother and her brothers and sisters believe in</b>
<br><b>ghosts and spirits and, in my mother's own words</b>
<br><b>"firmly believe that spirits of those people that we</b>
<br><b>are close to in life remain close to us after their</b>
<br><b>deaths".</b><b></b>
<p><b>It was not uncommon, in the days at the beginning of</b>
<br><b>this century, for an above average number of babies to</b>
<br><b>die when very young.&nbsp; In my mother's family, however,</b>
<br><b>only the firstborn, a boy called Ivan, died in early</b>
<br><b>childhood and the remaining eleven were all healthy</b>
<br><b>and thrived, until 1944 that is....&nbsp; My uncle Boy, who</b>
<br><b>was thirty years old at the time, came home one night,</b>
<br><b>after having a few beers,and, as he did not want his</b>
<br><b>mother to smell the alcohol on his breath, he decided</b>
<br><b>to spend what remained of the night in his car that</b>
<br><b>was parked outside their family house in Park Street.</b>
<br><b>(Yes, the same house that features in the "Mr Miller"</b>
<br><b>anecdote.)&nbsp; He did not have a peaceful night, however,</b>
<br><b>as he was, unfortunately, rather brutally attacked and</b>
<br><b>robbed.&nbsp; His attacker had on a pair of army boots and</b>
<br><b>forcefully kicked my uncle on the head -so forcefully</b>
<br><b>in fact that Boy later contracted, and died from,</b>
<br><b>inflammation of the brain.&nbsp; He died in hospital on 2</b>
<br><b>July 1944 and was buried by the family near the end of</b>
<br><b>that month.&nbsp; The entire family was devastated as he</b>
<br><b>had been much loved - he had been the joker of the</b>
<br><b>family and always used to perform practical jokes on</b>
<br><b>my mother and her older sisters (dressing up as</b>
<br><b>Dracula and jumping out to frighten them and so on).</b>
<br><b>He apparently had had a very loving nature and a great</b>
<br><b>sense of "family"; but had never married.</b><b></b>
<p><b>On the day of the funeral, my grandmother, my mother,</b>
<br><b>and her sisters Lily, Jeanetta and Edna locked up the</b>
<br><b>house in Park Street and prepared to walk to the</b>
<br><b>church, which was just down the street.&nbsp; They had</b>
<br><b>recently received a large arrangement of St Joseph</b>
<br><b>Lilies from a family friend, in sympathy for Boy's</b>
<br><b>death, and the flowers had been placed in a vase on</b>
<br><b>the diningroom table before the ladies had left for</b>
<br><b>church.&nbsp; No-one was left in the house and,</b>
<br><b>furthermore, no-one, other than my grandmother, had</b>
<br><b>keys to the house.</b><b></b>
<p><b>After the service was finished, they walked back to</b>
<br><b>their house and my grandmother unlocked the front</b>
<br><b>door.&nbsp; The dogs were very excited to see them; most</b>
<br><b>probably wanting company after having been left alone</b>
<br><b>for so long.&nbsp; My mother, being the youngest, rushed</b>
<br><b>passed the others and into the diningroom.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>stopped dead in the diningroom doorway and turned</b>
<br><b>around and said "Ma, Boy's been here !"&nbsp; What she had</b>
<br><b>seen was that all the lilies had been carefully taken</b>
<br><b>out of their vase and arranged in a cross on the large</b>
<br><b>oval diningroom table...</b>

<p><b>New House In Maryland</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LJRokie@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>In 1967, i was 12 then, my mom and grandma, had a house built from
the ground</b>
<br><b>up in Randallstown, Maryland.&nbsp; At the time of construction,
all sorts of</b>
<br><b>things delayed the plans.&nbsp; It took about 8 months to get it
built.&nbsp; First</b>
<br><b>they dug it too deep, they had to add additional stairs for the
upstairs and</b>
<br><b>downstairs to compensate, the ground wasn't settled, so many things.&nbsp;
Anyway,</b>
<br><b>we finally moved into the house in August of 1968.&nbsp; I had my
own room as well</b>
<br><b>as my siblings.&nbsp; It was a 5 bedroom house with a sewing room,
den and</b>
<br><b>basement (which was a finished basement with panelling and tile
floors).&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>back part of the basement had a storage area and a laundry.&nbsp;
This house was</b>
<br><b>the biggest one in the neighborhood.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Well, things went well&nbsp; the first year.&nbsp; (Oh, I should
mention that before we</b>
<br><b>moved to Randallstown, we lived in a older house, owned by my great</b>
<br><b>grandmother and great grandfather in Parkville Maryland.&nbsp; While
we lived</b>
<br><b>there, my father was always ill, bad heart, in and out of the hospital.&nbsp;
He</b>
<br><b>died in 1966, but not in the house.&nbsp; He died at work, called
my sister just</b>
<br><b>minutes before he died and told her he loved everyone and would
not be home</b>
<br><b>for dinner.&nbsp; In 1967, my 2 sisters and brother along with my
great aunt and</b>
<br><b>great uncle, were in a car accident.&nbsp; My great uncle was killed
immediately</b>
<br><b>on impact, my great aunt had 33 broken bones and in a coma for a
month, my</b>
<br><b>older sister suffered right brain damage, currently has grand mal
seizures</b>
<br><b>and was in a coma for 3 months (they thought she was dying but suddenly
woke</b>
<br><b>up).&nbsp; My younger sister had a fractured collar bone and my
brother only</b>
<br><b>suffered bruises.&nbsp; Prior to my fathers death, he brought home
an ouija board.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Fun and games, huh.&nbsp; Since that time, we have had terrible
experiences, just</b>
<br><b>like i mentioned above.&nbsp; After the accident, my mother blessed
the house with</b>
<br><b>holy water, put salt under the threshold with a brand new penny.&nbsp;
That is</b>
<br><b>when she decided to move)</b><b></b>
<p><b>Anyway, getting back to the new house now.&nbsp; Things went well
the first year.</b>
<br><b>No problems.&nbsp; Then little things&nbsp; started happening.&nbsp;
Things like items being</b>
<br><b>misplaced and showing up somewhere else.&nbsp; The toilet flushing,
water running,</b>
<br><b>glasses breaking in the cupboards, footsteps upstairs.&nbsp; Nothing
really</b>
<br><b>significant.&nbsp; This all started in 1970.&nbsp; I was in high
school then and wasn't</b>
<br><b>home very much.&nbsp; I was a regular member of our church and attended
there for</b>
<br><b>many functions.&nbsp; So, some of these things i heard but others
are only things</b>
<br><b>my mom told me.&nbsp; anyway, this continued year after year and
it didn't really</b>
<br><b>seem to bother anyone.&nbsp; I went into the military and my mom
said that things</b>
<br><b>quieted down.&nbsp; She never heard another sound again.&nbsp; Well,
in March 1975,</b>
<br><b>right before my discharge from the Navy, I called my mom to tell
her when I</b>
<br><b>was coming home.&nbsp; That night, she started hearing the noises
again.&nbsp; When I</b>
<br><b>returned home that next week, I began hearing the same thing. Again,
nothing</b>
<br><b>devastating but noises all the same as before.&nbsp; This continued
until I moved</b>
<br><b>out in September 1975.&nbsp; Again, things quieted down.&nbsp; In
1977, I moved back in</b>
<br><b>and stayed for a while.&nbsp; The noises started again.&nbsp; This
time, with</b>
<br><b>intensity.&nbsp; One night my mom was watching TV and she thought
my brother had</b>
<br><b>come in and was in her room walking around.&nbsp; She yelled upstairs
his name,</b>
<br><b>Eddie.&nbsp; Suddenly she heard a thump like someone dropped something
(my dad's</b>
<br><b>name was Eddie too).&nbsp; She went upstairs but saw nothing.&nbsp;
However, the light</b>
<br><b>was on and she never keeps her lights on, very conscious person
when it comes</b>
<br><b>to&nbsp; paying the electric bill.&nbsp; She turned the light off
and went back</b>
<br><b>downstairs.&nbsp; She finally got settled and our little dog started
barking at</b>
<br><b>the basement door.&nbsp; She went over and opened the door and the
dog ran</b>
<br><b>downstairs, barking.&nbsp; She came back up, layed down and went
to sleep.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Later on, after my first child was born (a boy), he was 3 at the
time, I was</b>
<br><b>cleaning the dining room.&nbsp; He was in the living room watching
TV.&nbsp; The way</b>
<br><b>our house was set up, you could go from the living room, to the
kitchen to</b>
<br><b>the dining room, through the hall and back to the living room again.&nbsp;
As I</b>
<br><b>was cleaning I heard the front door open.&nbsp; I thought my brother
had come in.</b>
<br><b>I heard footsteps going upstairs.&nbsp; (my sister worked during
the day).&nbsp; Then I</b>
<br><b>heard music (rock and roll for the 70s era) and people talking coming
from my</b>
<br><b>sister's room.&nbsp; Well, my brother was known for stealing money
from everyone</b>
<br><b>and he did not get along well with my sister either.&nbsp; So, I
thought he came</b>
<br><b>in, broke into her room (she kept her door locked), had some people
in her</b>
<br><b>room just to make her mad.&nbsp; I took a broom handle and knocked
on the ceiling</b>
<br><b>right below her room from the dining room.&nbsp; It didn't stop.&nbsp;
I yelled his</b>
<br><b>name from downstairs but no response.&nbsp; I went upstairs and
tried to open the</b>
<br><b>door, it was locked.&nbsp; I came downstairs, got the spare key
and went back up</b>
<br><b>to unlock the door.&nbsp; I could still hear the music and people.&nbsp;
But as soon as</b>
<br><b>I opened the door, it all stopped.&nbsp; No people, no music.&nbsp;
I was not afraid.</b>
<br><b>They never did anything before, so I&nbsp; very politely said to
them "please, if</b>
<br><b>you are going to have a party, take it to the basement and keep
the music</b>
<br><b>down".&nbsp; Of course, I was just joking and making light of the
situation to let</b>
<br><b>them know it's okay but don't be disturbing.&nbsp; Well, later that
night, my two</b>
<br><b>children, 3 and 1 1/2, slept in the basement in the spare room we
made.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>daughter kept telling me about a face.&nbsp; Well, being 1 1/2 years
old, I</b>
<br><b>thought she was just telling what she saw in her dreams.&nbsp; These
things went</b>
<br><b>on for many years to come.&nbsp; Once, I was doing laundry.&nbsp;
I have a special way</b>
<br><b>that I fold men's underwear.&nbsp; Just like the military, I fold
them in thirds</b>
<br><b>to save on room.&nbsp; My husband, at the time, had an appointment
and we had to</b>
<br><b>leave.&nbsp; My kids were in daycare.&nbsp; My ex was verbally abusive
and at times</b>
<br><b>physically abusive to me.&nbsp; Anyway, I folded the underwear and
the rest of our</b>
<br><b>clothes and put them in piles on the bed.&nbsp; I figured I would
put them away</b>
<br><b>when we got back.&nbsp; Well,&nbsp; we returned about 4 hours later
with the kids.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>went downstairs and everything was still in place except for his
underwear.</b>
<br><b>He yelled at me because he needed them for his national&nbsp; guard
weekend and</b>
<br><b>now they were gone.&nbsp; I looked all over, but could not find
them.&nbsp; I even went</b>
<br><b>up to the second floor and checked all the rooms and bathrooms.&nbsp;
No luck.</b>
<br><b>Later that night, we had a friend over.&nbsp; While we were sitting
in our room,</b>
<br><b>which was adjacent to the laundry room, we all looked at the same
time and</b>
<br><b>the hamper lid opened and shut about four times, then suddenly slammed
shut.</b>
<br><b>I got up, went over, opened it up and there they were, his underwear,
in the</b>
<br><b>bottom of the hamper.&nbsp; All neatly folded in place as if they
were placed</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; I took them out and quietly said "thank you" to the
spirit who took</b>
<br><b>them.&nbsp; Then the toilet flushed.&nbsp; I guess that was a "you're
welcome".&nbsp; These</b>
<br><b>little occurences happened in my mom's&nbsp; house until my husband
(at the time,</b>
<br><b>now ex) and I moved to Kansas.&nbsp; Little things kept happening
to us, like the</b>
<br><b>smell of lilacs, things being moved.&nbsp; Nothing as significant
as it was at my</b>
<br><b>mom's.&nbsp; But my mom's house was quiet.&nbsp; When we decided
to move back to</b>
<br><b>Maryland, I called my mom and it started all over again.&nbsp; By
this time, it</b>
<br><b>was 1985.&nbsp; I moved in and out of the house several times.&nbsp;
Each time I moved</b>
<br><b>out, the occurences stopped.&nbsp; But as soon as I moved in, they
started again.</b>
<br><b>I guess they didn't like my ex.&nbsp;&nbsp; We had another child
in 1983.&nbsp; I filed for</b>
<br><b>divorce in 1985 because of the abuse.&nbsp; Things got a little
better at the</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; In 1988, my mom decided to sell the house.&nbsp; I
met someone else.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>mom moved out to an apartment and my live-in at the time helped
with the</b>
<br><b>bills.&nbsp; Occurences still happened.&nbsp; Each time someone
was interested in</b>
<br><b>buying the house, they would go to closing and it would fall through.
This</b>
<br><b>happened about 8 different times.&nbsp; The house could not be sold.&nbsp;
My mom was</b>
<br><b>in debt because she had a second mortgage on the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;
She finally filed</b>
<br><b>bankruptcy.&nbsp; We all went back to the house to retrieve what
was left in the</b>
<br><b>basement, little things.&nbsp; While in the basement, my ex (whom
the spirits did</b>
<br><b>not like) came by and asked if we needed help.&nbsp; I told him
that there are</b>
<br><b>some heavy boxes upstairs, if he could please put them in the back
of the</b>
<br><b>truck.&nbsp; He said okay.&nbsp; My mom, youngest daughter and I
were in the bedroom</b>
<br><b>where the kids used to sleep cleaning it.&nbsp; We had a lamp lit.&nbsp;
My ex sat down</b>
<br><b>on the floor to talk to my youngest daughter.&nbsp; He made a comment,
said to me,</b>
<br><b>"well, it seems quiet here now.&nbsp; What's the matter, no more
ghosts", and</b>
<br><b>suddently sparks flew from the lamp cord.&nbsp; It looked like a
mini fourth or</b>
<br><b>July.&nbsp; I unplugged the lamp, thinking we would have to throw
it away.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>looked at the cord and there was no damage.&nbsp; My ex knew the
spirits didn't</b>
<br><b>like him.&nbsp; He said, "I guess I should be leaving now".&nbsp;
I told him that was a</b>
<br><b>good idea.&nbsp; We moved out.&nbsp; Later that weekend, I still
had a couple of more</b>
<br><b>things to get so the guy I was living with at the time, took the
key, went</b>
<br><b>back to the house to meet his brother to bring the few things left.&nbsp;
He came</b>
<br><b>back, said I gave him the wrong key, it wouldn't turn.&nbsp; I said,
bull.&nbsp; I got</b>
<br><b>in the car, drove over there.&nbsp; He said to me, "watch".&nbsp;
He put the key in the</b>
<br><b>hole, it turned but the door would not open.&nbsp; You could see
it trying to push</b>
<br><b>open but it was like someone was holding it shut from the inside.&nbsp;
I said,</b>
<br><b>"let me try".&nbsp; I put in key in, turned it, turned the door
knob and it opened</b>
<br><b>without a problem.&nbsp; I could sense someone (thing) was there.&nbsp;
I sat on the</b>
<br><b>step and could hear voices telling me not to go.&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt
bad because I had</b>
<br><b>no other choice.&nbsp;&nbsp; The house went on the auction block.&nbsp;
Still, it could not</b>
<br><b>be sold.&nbsp; It sat dormant for 3 years.</b><b></b>
<p><b>There was no electricity or gas in the house.&nbsp; One night, I
got a call from a</b>
<br><b>friend who wanted to know who moved in.&nbsp;&nbsp; I told her it
was still vacant and</b>
<br><b>that it had not been sold yet.&nbsp; She told me that&nbsp; there
were a bunch of</b>
<br><b>people in the house with music blaring.&nbsp; It was late at night
so I checked it</b>
<br><b>out the next day.&nbsp; I still had a key.&nbsp; I went to the house,
unlocked the door</b>
<br><b>(only one key opened all the locks in the house).&nbsp; They all
had deadbolts and</b>
<br><b>door locks too (the back door, basement door and front door).&nbsp;
I walked in,</b>
<br><b>nothing was out of place, and no electric was running.&nbsp; Not
even the water.</b>
<br><b>But, I found a beer can laying in the sick and the sink was wet.&nbsp;
I left,</b>
<br><b>locked up and went next door and asked the neighbor if she heard
anything.</b>
<br><b>She told me the same thing.&nbsp; The house finally got sold in
1989 to four</b>
<br><b>investors.&nbsp; They put the house up for rent but everytime someone
came to see</b>
<br><b>the house to rent it, they declined.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Out of curiosity, on October 31, 1989, I called the real estate agent
and</b>
<br><b>asked her how much it is being rented for.&nbsp; She told me $1200.00
a month.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>said that was too steep and thank you very much.&nbsp; She insisted
that I see the</b>
<br><b>house because it was quite lovely.&nbsp; I told her who I was and
that we lived</b>
<br><b>there before it was sold.&nbsp; She got angry with me and said that
she would not</b>
<br><b>rent it to me because of the condition we left it in.&nbsp; She
told me that the</b>
<br><b>pipes were cut in the basement, trash was all over the kitchen,
the carpet</b>
<br><b>war ripped up and the bedrooms had scribble on the walls.&nbsp;
I explained that I</b>
<br><b>have not been in that house since earlier that year, just before
it was sold</b>
<br><b>at auction.&nbsp; I also told her of the experiences we had while
living there and</b>
<br><b>that before we left, the whole house was immaculate, ready to be
moved into.</b>
<br><b>She said she would talk to the new owners to see if we could move
in for $900</b>
<br><b>a month.&nbsp; She seemed desperate to rent it.&nbsp; I told her
no.&nbsp; I was just</b>
<br><b>curious.&nbsp; She called me the next day and said we could have
it for $800 a</b>
<br><b>month.&nbsp; They were having a hard time renting it.&nbsp; In 1991,
they finally had</b>
<br><b>it rented.&nbsp; The new renters stayed there 3 months and moved
out.&nbsp; The next</b>
<br><b>renters moved in, stayed 6 months and moved out.&nbsp; The house
went back on the</b>
<br><b>market to be sold.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I didn't hear much about the house after that, though I have told
this story</b>
<br><b>on many occasions.&nbsp; In June 1998, my husband now and I moved
back to</b>
<br><b>Maryland.&nbsp; I showed him the house where all this happened and
I saw a "for</b>
<br><b>sale" sign outside.&nbsp; I said to him, "see, they can't keep it
sold to any one</b>
<br><b>particular person".&nbsp; I called the real estate agent and asked
him if I could</b>
<br><b>see the house.&nbsp; He agreed.&nbsp; I was curious to see how they
fixed it up after</b>
<br><b>the previous real estate agent said it was torn up.&nbsp; We got
there early and</b>
<br><b>looked in the windows, and the basement door.&nbsp; When he arrived,
we went in.</b>
<br><b>I felt very very comfortable, warming when I walked in.&nbsp; Just
like I never</b>
<br><b>left.&nbsp; But the weird thing is, nothing was different, same
carpet, no cuts in</b>
<br><b>the pipes, same paint in each room, same everything.&nbsp; Even
the shelf lining</b>
<br><b>in the pantry were the same.&nbsp; From what I understood, everything
was redone.</b>
<br><b>They were asking $148,000 for the house.&nbsp; My mom bought it
for $20,000 in</b>
<br><b>1968, it sold at auction in 1989 for $79,000.&nbsp; I told him thank
you and I</b>
<br><b>would get back with him.&nbsp; Everyone exited the house and I was
the last one in</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; I could feel the spirits still there.&nbsp; They seemed
sad.&nbsp; It finally</b>
<br><b>sold right before we came back to Oklahoma (I don't know how much
it sold for</b>
<br><b>though).</b><b></b>
<p><b>Some spirits are still with me.&nbsp; I was told by a very reputable
card reader</b>
<br><b>that 2 of the six spirits followed me.&nbsp; One of them is my dad.&nbsp;
He comes and</b>
<br><b>goes but I can still feel the presence.&nbsp; Occurences still happen
whereever I</b>
<br><b>move to.&nbsp; Not as severe, maybe because it is only 2 spirits
and not six.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I did a history of the land and there was nothing significant about
it.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>card reader that I saw (who was right on the nose with everything
in my life</b>
<br><b>and things are still coming true) said that 1 of the spirits (my
dad) is</b>
<br><b>protecting me.&nbsp; She told me that he said, "don't have your
tubes untied to</b>
<br><b>get pregnant.&nbsp; This will only cause harm and possibly death
if you do".&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>reassured the reader that I would have custody of a child in time
to come.</b>
<br><b>I'm glad I listened to his warning.&nbsp; I went to see what I needed
to do about</b>
<br><b>having a reversal of my tubes and the doctors told me it would be</b>
<br><b>life-threatening for me because of my age and heart disease in my
family.</b>
<br><b>Just this past May, my husband and I got legal custody of my grandson,
Dylan.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;This reader read my cards in 1988.&nbsp; It was predicted
(by my dad) that in</b>
<br><b>10-12 years, I'd have a child to raise.</b><b></b>
<p><b>So, now, here we are, 1999, all the predictions have come true, the
two</b>
<br><b>spirits (one is my dad) have followed me everywhere I have gone
and the other</b>
<br><b>four spirits remain in the house, unhappy.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I think about the house all the time.&nbsp; I don't know why.&nbsp;
I wish there was</b>
<br><b>something I could do to help those spirits.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Any suggestions would be helpful.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Imaginary Friend</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; I am writing to you about just a few of the many encounters
that I have had.&nbsp; I have a ghost filled life I guess you could say.&nbsp;
Please do not think that I am some sort of freak.&nbsp; I struggle with
this everyday, and have only told very trusted family and my fiance. So
this is very hard for me to do, because I feel that people might think
that I am crazy if I admit that I see ghosts on a regular basis.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had an imaginary friend like every other
child, but mine was real.&nbsp; My mother even walked in on him shaving
early one morning.( I have found out that the people on my Mom's side of
the family are very sensitive to ghosts and ghost activity)&nbsp; His name
was Mr. Graves.&nbsp; (really no joke, my parents found this out when they
bought the from from the family.)&nbsp; He taught me basically all that
I know about ghosts.&nbsp; He told me as a small child to beware of the
"Shadow People"&nbsp; I have only had one encounter that I konw of in my
entire life.&nbsp; He said that they were very bad and dangerous.&nbsp;
He even helped me pack my stuff when we moved from our house.&nbsp; He
started out my "ghostly life"&nbsp; I&nbsp; guess that I am pretty lucky
to have a nice begining.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After I moved from there i had very few ghostly
encounters.&nbsp; Everything has been "normal"&nbsp; until a few months
ago.&nbsp; In March, I had a stroke.&nbsp; Ever since then, I&nbsp; have
been seing more and more.&nbsp; Now it is almost a daily occurance.&nbsp;
I felt that I would give you a little information about myself before I
told you about the place where I work.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I work in a movie theater that used to be a theater
before, but not movie, but stage.&nbsp; As a matter of fact the stage is
still there complete with the vents, dressing rooms and the overhead mechanisms
to control curtains.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a very happing place during it's
time.&nbsp; There was a dining place called the Kit Kat next door to the
thater.&nbsp; And a hotel on the other side.&nbsp; When the stage was closed
the place became a movie theater with one screen.&nbsp; It is still set
up as a theater would have been in the era of segregation.&nbsp; It became
a two screen movie theatre recently and the balcony has been closed off.&nbsp;
There have been some pretty weird things going on upstairs.&nbsp; I was
talking to the manager one night about something that happened as I was
leaving pretty late.&nbsp; It sounded like something upstairs in the old
lobby fell.&nbsp; Something BIG.&nbsp; I went up with a friend to check
it out, but nothing could have fallen.&nbsp; After I had gotten about half
of my story out, the manager finished the story for me.&nbsp; he said that
he had experience the same thing.&nbsp; We have both heard voices upstairs
and footsteps on carpeted floors.&nbsp; No one else really has experienced
anything, or they don't talk about it.&nbsp; Up until a few months ago,
no one ever saw anybody.&nbsp; Well that all stopped pretty recently.&nbsp;
I have seen 2 men.(I am the only one who has seen anyting)&nbsp; One downstairs,
who seems to be pretty nice guy.&nbsp; Or at least that is the feeling
I got.&nbsp; The other was upstairs in the balcony.&nbsp; The feeling I
got off of him ranks up there with the feeling I got the one time I encountered
the shadow people.&nbsp; The manager, which is my uncle, has been doing
a little bit of research and has come up with very little information.&nbsp;
I have written a narrative abaout the man upstairs.&nbsp; My fiance drew
a picture of him without my knowledge, just from the description I had
given him.&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw&nbsp; the picture one day in the backseat
of his car and it sent chills through my body.&nbsp; The city is wanting
to tear down this building and put an even larger theater in it's place.&nbsp;
We do not know how long the owner of the building is going to hold out
on selling it.</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Ghost Experience</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: joeb@innernet.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My experience with the supernatural
occurred in 1997.&nbsp; I was</b>
<br><b>married at that time to a man who shall here be known as "Shawn".&nbsp;
We</b>
<br><b>shared a split-level ranch house with his father and step-mother.&nbsp;
His</b>
<br><b>real mother who was domineering and over-protective of&nbsp; her
only son</b>
<br><b>died in 1993 of Multiple Sclerosis.&nbsp; He kept a full-sized portrait
of</b>
<br><b>her on his bedroom wall.&nbsp; I always turned it around at night
because it</b>
<br><b>seemed like she was really watching you.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My experience happened one night when "Shawn"
was out late partying</b>
<br><b>with his friends.&nbsp; His parents went to bed around nine-thirty
and I</b>
<br><b>retired to our separate room around eleven.&nbsp; I was maybe asleep
for</b>
<br><b>perhaps an hour when I awoke to the sound of the hallway's wooden
floor</b>
<br><b>creaking.&nbsp; At first, I thought maybe it was his one of his
parents going</b>
<br><b>to the bathroom when I suddenly realized that they had their own</b>
<br><b>adjoining to their master bedroom.&nbsp; Then I thought maybe it
was my</b>
<br><b>husband drunk again and swaying in the hall.&nbsp; A few minutes
later, I got</b>
<br><b>up and opened the door only to discover that nobody was there!&nbsp;
This</b>
<br><b>continued every night that "Shawn" stayed out late.&nbsp; I tried
to explain</b>
<br><b>this occurrence to my in-laws, but they simply dismissed it and
told me</b>
<br><b>it was just my imagination.&nbsp; I knew the floor in the hall creaked</b>
<br><b>because everytime a person would walk over this certain spot in
front of</b>
<br><b>our bedroom door, it WOULD creak.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another incident I had happened sometime after
that, perhaps a month</b>
<br><b>or so.&nbsp; "Shawn"&nbsp; was out again and I was in bed when I
got thirsty.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>was on my way to the kitchen through the dining room when I realized</b>
<br><b>that it was chilly.&nbsp; Which was very unusual because they always
kept the</b>
<br><b>house at a comfortable seventy degrees.&nbsp; Then I saw an older
woman</b>
<br><b>leaning over the sink.&nbsp; I admit, I got frightened, but she
had this look</b>
<br><b>in her eyes that said that she wasn't there for vengeance, but for
a</b>
<br><b>more peaceful reason.&nbsp; She faded away, and I ran for the bedroom
and</b>
<br><b>slept with the light on for the rest of the night until "Shawn"
came</b>
<br><b>home.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That weekend we all&nbsp; went up to his paternal
grandparents' log cabin</b>
<br><b>in the woods and I explained my experiences to Grandma.&nbsp; That's
when I</b>
<br><b>learned about his real mother and how they had a genuine mother-son</b>
<br><b>relationship.&nbsp; She told me how when his mother died he literally
threw</b>
<br><b>himself on her casket as it was lowered into the ground, begging
her not</b>
<br><b>to leave him.&nbsp; His father then told me how she would walk the
floors</b>
<br><b>when he was out late, waiting for him to return to her.&nbsp; And
how she</b>
<br><b>wouldn't let him play sports because she was terrified that he would
be</b>
<br><b>injured.&nbsp; That was too much for her to bare.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lived in that house with her spirit for a year.&nbsp;
My marriage went</b>
<br><b>to hell, but I never had a problem with her after I learned who,
or</b>
<br><b>what, was making the floor creak.&nbsp; I got so used to her in
fact that I</b>
<br><b>would talk to her, even though she never answered back.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It just goes to show that a mother's&nbsp; love
will last forever-even</b>
<br><b>after death.</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Ghost</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: shirl49@mtneer.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I sumitted a story a month or two ago, but I don't remember if I
told you about the house I live in.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a matter of fact I was
born in this house.&nbsp;&nbsp; About four years ago I moved back in to
take care of my Mother, she in almost eighty-five now.&nbsp;&nbsp; My father
passed away in 1959 and I have felt and seen him a few times over the years.&nbsp;&nbsp;
When I moved back in I started to hear him more often, several people have
also.&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally it's just a shadow that moves across the kitchen,
sometimes it's the sound of footsteps.&nbsp;&nbsp; We see and hear alot
more when Mom is sick or hurt.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once when I had spent a week
in Charleston on business I came home about seven at night and Mom wasn't
home, a light shot out of the kitchen and toward the french doors to Mom's
room.&nbsp;&nbsp; It frighten me as Mom did not answer me when I called
out to her.&nbsp;&nbsp; She had fallen and broken her wrist and the light
went to where a note was from my friend telling me she had taken Mom to
the hospitial.</b>
<br><b>The past two weeks things have gotten a little out of hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Stuff started to go missing only to show up a week or so later in places
we had already looked for them.&nbsp;&nbsp; An example was I had purchased
extra ink for my printer and layed it on the kitchen counter.&nbsp;&nbsp;
A day or two later (OK, so I don't always put stuff up right away) I went
to get them and they were gone.&nbsp;&nbsp; My nefew was fixing our back
door and he remember seeing them.&nbsp;&nbsp; I went through every thing
in the kitchen at least six times and even went through my room in case
I had put them in there and forgotten but I couldn't find the ink cartriges.&nbsp;&nbsp;
That was a Saturday, the next Thursday I purchased more.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Saturday I lost (?) the cartriges I cleaned my computer desk.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Friday when I got off work I went to check my E Mail and the missing cartriges
were laying on top of the ones I had just purchased.&nbsp; Mom swares she
didn't see them and my nefew said he didn't either.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a matter
of fact he thinks I'm trying to scare him.&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been
several other things that the same thing is happening and all but three
items have reappeared.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am rather confused as to why nothing like this
has ever happen before and why is it starting to now.&nbsp;&nbsp; What
has changed?&nbsp;&nbsp; I know the ghost is my Dad and I know he wouldn't
hurt Mom or me, so why is he doing this.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you could just
give a little insight I would be grateful.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
