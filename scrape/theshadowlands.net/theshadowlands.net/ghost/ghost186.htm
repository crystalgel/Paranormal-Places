<p><b>&nbsp;Graveyard Party</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LytDreams@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>The apartment complex that i live in has a church behind it, with
a opening</b>
<br><b>in the fence, so the residents may walk to church if they attend
there. well,</b>
<br><b>on the other side of the church there is a cemetery, a small, yet
somehow</b>
<br><b>personal cemetary, with a hole in the fence and a little opening
to crawl</b>
<br><b>through. my best friend lives behind the cemetery, so to get to
each others</b>
<br><b>houses everyday, we simply walk through the cemetary and jump the
fence to</b>
<br><b>her backyard. last summer, we were throwing and party and decided
to make it</b>
<br><b>exciting by going to the cemetary. I know it sounds a bit morbid
and stupid,</b>
<br><b>but to a group of teenagers in a small town with little to do, it's
exactly</b>
<br><b>what you need. so we were in the cemetary, walking around and talking.
it was</b>
<br><b>around midnight, full moon. well,..we were just about to go home
when all the</b>
<br><b>sudden we heard one of our friends, screaming. we ran to her to
quiet her</b>
<br><b>down and see whats wrong. at that point she ran as fast as she could
from us</b>
<br><b>and towards the fence to my best friends yard.when we caught up
to her, her</b>
<br><b>breathing was extremly heavy and she was sobbing hysterically. we
finally got</b>
<br><b>her over the fence and into the house. she went into shock at that
point. we</b>
<br><b>had gotten her a glass of water, hoping that would help, and she
was shaking</b>
<br><b>so bad that the water was splashing out of the cup. we were all
rather</b>
<br><b>annoyed, figuring she was just joking. all of a sudden she startedcrying</b>
<br><b>again and talking in very broken spanish. her cousin stayed in the
room and</b>
<br><b>the rest of us sat around upstairs until her cousin came to tell
us what was</b>
<br><b>wrong. she was crying also and started shaking as she told us the
story.</b>
<br><b>while we were in the cemetary, karla had seen a man, completly white,
with</b>
<br><b>long white hair floating above her. he was smirking at her and he
started to</b>
<br><b>laugh at her and make fun of her. he tried to offer her candy, and
told her</b>
<br><b>that if she told anyone about him, that he would kill her friends
and he</b>
<br><b>would find her one day. the reason we know she wasn't faking is
because she</b>
<br><b>would have eventually told us the truth, and besides that,..karla
is an</b>
<br><b>extremly bad liar. not to mention the fact that we all knew the
cemetary was</b>
<br><b>haunted. not only i, but my best friend have both heard strange
noises from</b>
<br><b>there, and we hear footsteps behind us when no one is there. needless
to say</b>
<br><b>we never go in there at night anymore.</b><b></b>

<p><b>as i sit here trying to figure out how to explain my experience to
you, it still seems unreal, maybe even imagined but in my heart i know
it happened.it didn't just happen to me though it came about while 3 other
people we're here in my house.the evening seemed to be just like any other
evening my two kids and i watching tv, my daughter decided to go get her
night clothes,after a few minutes my back door slammed,I thought Joanie
did it but she ran to the livingroom obviously frightened,I went to check
the door it was locked but I opened anyway screen door still closed so
I decided that it must have been the wind(although there was very little
wind) I explained to my daughter that it was okay just the wind I said.We
settled back into watching tv when the door slammed again this door was
opening then slamming shut while it was completely secured no logical way
to explain it.but to keep from scaring my daughter or myself ,I assured
her the wind was making this happen.the slamming of this door accured four
times in a matter a one in a half hours,by this time I was getting spooked
so I called for my uncle bobby and Lisa to come here,but as i called for
them the pulled in out front .so we we're sitting in my kitchen and I was
telling Lisa about how I was feeling at night like someone had been watching
me sleep but when I woke up there wasn't anyone around(I never mentioned
to them about the door until later)just as I finished saying about somebody
watching me,the door flew open and slammed shut i couldn't see anything
but I felt a cool air pass my arms and immediately my uncle bobby started
to cry he said my mothers here and i don't know why I can't stop balling(if
your wondering what the big deal is about my uncle crying is he lost his
only son a few years ago and he never cried he's one of those men that
think men shouldn't cry)so that's why this is so strange for us.anyway
after I would say 8 to 10 minutes he stood up and said she's gone now.Joanie
Lisa and I couldn't figure out what just went on we weren't afraid of what
it was or who,but we were amazed that it happened to us. we to figured
people would think we were drunk or crazy,believe we're neither something
happened.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Ghosts and me!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: anshar55@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Here is my account of my little ghost!</b>
<br><b>I have always been a rather spiritual person delving deep into wicca
and the 'after life'. Recently after moving into a house I started to have
many life problems and life became harder and harder to deal with. One
night when I was feeling especially down, I was walking down our staircase
and noticed a hazy figure sitting at the bottom.</b>
<br><b>At first I was more intimidated than fascinated and ran past and
into my room. I awoke later that night with a strong urge to go back out.
I sat in the dark hallway for a while staring at the stairs. My closest
friend also came out and sat with me (he is also into witchcraft and the
like) and after about ten minutes it appeared again. This time more clearer
though. It was a young boy about 15 years old. We both saw him as though
we were seeing an old photo. The colour around him and him himself, was
a brown, yellow. Both of us said at the same time, 'his name is Matthew'.
>From this time on, we were no longer afraid...he bought a kind of peace
to us and soon problems seemed to vanish.</b>
<br><b>A couple of weeks later when things were going better, I no longer
felt his presence. Now I only feel or see him when I am in trouble and
things are always ok.</b>
<br><b>My friend had a dream not long after Matthew left that he saw quite
vividly and 'acted' this dream out as though he were awake and talking.
Fortunately I witnessed this and foudn out exac;ty who Matthew is. He is
my guardian angel. He is here for me when I need him and goes when I don't.
He used to live just across the street from us but died very young from
Scarlet Fever (or something like that.) He told us of his life and that
he would never leave me.</b>
<br><b>The next night I had a dream and he appeared to me. He told me his
great fascination with me was that my former life, I had been his best
friend. We did everything together and when he died the only way he could
be with me and watch over me again was to do this.</b>
<br><b>Ever since, nothing has done me wrong and when I get down or upset,
he is there.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Genina's story: California</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Geninarose</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>My house I live in today is haunted. It really started along time
ago</b>
<br><b>although I do not know the exact date. One day I was standing in
my room</b>
<br><b>watching t.v. (all by my self in the house), waiting for my cousin
to come</b>
<br><b>over, when I saw a shadowy figure float past my room really fast
into my</b>
<br><b>parents room. Needless to say I was terrified. The next day we all
went to</b>
<br><b>the movies. We had seen "Stir of Echoes" and when we got home we
: my mom, my</b>
<br><b>cousin and I (my dad was in the other room), were sitting in the
kitchen</b>
<br><b>eating sandwiches talking about the movie. As I was talking I saw
another</b>
<br><b>shadow this time outside the front yard. It was visible from the
kitchen and</b>
<br><b>living room window. I did a double take then I told my mom and cousin
what</b>
<br><b>had happened. A lot of times when my cousin comes over, we will
experience</b>
<br><b>things. We both have heard whispers. I heard somebody call my name
many</b>
<br><b>times. When you walk down the hallway, sometimes it makes creaking
noises.</b>
<br><b>Well alot of times you can hear the creaking noises even when nobody
is</b>
<br><b>walking. One night my cousin was over again. I had went into the
kitchen to</b>
<br><b>throw some garbage away and when I bent down to put the garbage
away, I felt</b>
<br><b>someone floating over me.I quickly walked out of the kitchen into
the hallway</b>
<br><b>and felt it following me. The faster I walked the faster it moved.
I ran in</b>
<br><b>my room and told my cousin what had happened. One day the light
fixture</b>
<br><b>almost fell on my head in the kitchen. I also heard a sound coming
from the</b>
<br><b>ceiling like the sound a dog makes when it runs along the floor.
I have even</b>
<br><b>heard a child voice and man's voice from the outside backyard. It
was</b>
<br><b>nighttime. One day the bathroom faucet turned on by itself full
blast. my mom</b>
<br><b>was by herself in the house and she heard the back screen door open
and the</b>
<br><b>front screen door open and close. They were both locked. My dad
also being</b>
<br><b>alone in the house heard the front door open and close. It' a big
metal</b>
<br><b>screen so it makes noise everytime you open and close it. One early
morning</b>
<br><b>around 5:00 am, a cabinet nailed to the wall came crashing down.
It had been</b>
<br><b>up since we had moved in about 4 or 5 years ago.I don't know what
it is but</b>
<br><b>it is a little freaky and here I am 20 years old afraid to sleep
with lights</b>
<br><b>out. A lot of times I will feel someone watching me while I sleep.
Well I</b>
<br><b>hope you enjoyed my story.</b>

<p><b>Out of the Blue</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Bear1dad2@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have always been a believer in the paranormal.&nbsp;
I have had many unusual</b>
<br><b>and unexplainable things happen around me.&nbsp; Around me is the
key.&nbsp; I have</b>
<br><b>never had anything happen to me and never have I feel threatened.&nbsp;
That</b>
<br><b>changed during November 2000.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bought my first home in 1999 at the age of
40.&nbsp; The house was very</b>
<br><b>quiet and peaceful (unlike my last home of fourteen years which
had a great</b>
<br><b>deal of energy in it), and I was so glad to have this refuge.&nbsp;
Out of the</b>
<br><b>Blue, after having lived in this house for a year and a half, this
all</b>
<br><b>changed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My couch divides my living room so that I can
have an entry (behind it)</b>
<br><b>where the door to the hallway and bedrooms can be found.&nbsp; Each
night I played</b>
<br><b>the same game with my nine month old puppy.&nbsp; I would sit in
front of the fire</b>
<br><b>place and throw a toy into the dining room or behind the couch.&nbsp;
Often it</b>
<br><b>would land in the hallway or even further into the guest room.&nbsp;
Always, she</b>
<br><b>would run after it and bring it back.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night, I threw the toy and it landed just
behind the couch, possibly</b>
<br><b>six feet away from me.&nbsp; The couch sits high off of the floor
about ten</b>
<br><b>inches, so I could clearly see my dog's head as she would come up
and then</b>
<br><b>back away from the toy.&nbsp; She would get within inches, and then
put her ears</b>
<br><b>back and back away.&nbsp; I could not figure this, so I went around
and tried to</b>
<br><b>encourage her.&nbsp; She just gave up.&nbsp; I got the toy and brought
it around.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I threw it back and again, she would come close
to picking it up, but</b>
<br><b>then back off.&nbsp; I went around and looked at her and she was
looking up and</b>
<br><b>making the same facial expressions she made when I was talking to
her.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>was if she was seeing someone.&nbsp; I saw and felt nothing.&nbsp;
So, again I picked</b>
<br><b>up the toy.&nbsp; The game was over; she simply would not play if
I threw it</b>
<br><b>behind the couch.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second night we began playing again, and
it started out well.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>would go behind the couch for a while, and then all of the sudden,
she</b>
<br><b>cowered down and ran to me.&nbsp; I went around and tried to call
her over, but</b>
<br><b>she was obviously not pleased and would not come.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third night, all was going well again, but
this time went very badly.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My dog began to growl...a sound she had never made before
and was backing</b>
<br><b>up.&nbsp; Her face was that of a frightened dog as she was looking
up at something</b>
<br><b>that I could not see.&nbsp; She backed right up until her hind end
touched the</b>
<br><b>front door and she panicked and began to wet all over.&nbsp; She
was house broken</b>
<br><b>for about four months at this time.&nbsp; She ran through the house
to the back</b>
<br><b>door wetting all over and begging to get out.&nbsp; Something had
scared her very</b>
<br><b>badly.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was angry after letting her out and went back
in.&nbsp; I don't know what</b>
<br><b>made me consider this, but I went back in and started telling whatever
it was</b>
<br><b>that this was my place and my time now.&nbsp; They had had their
chance and they</b>
<br><b>were not to come into my house and scare my dog or me.&nbsp; They
had to go, and</b>
<br><b>go now! I was emphatic.&nbsp; They left.&nbsp; The dog came back
in and all was well</b>
<br><b>for a few more days.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several nights later, I was playing with her
again in my bedroom.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>hall is a square with a door on each side.&nbsp; My bedroom door
is beside the</b>
<br><b>door to the living room and only about four feet away from where
my dog was</b>
<br><b>having her problem before.&nbsp; I had my back to the door and my
dog was facing</b>
<br><b>me while playing.&nbsp; Once again, she began to back up, growling,
and wetting</b>
<br><b>everywhere.&nbsp; She began to run around the bed to find a way
out.&nbsp; I felt so</b>
<br><b>sorry for her.&nbsp; She did not deserve this.&nbsp; I spun around
and saw and felt</b>
<br><b>nothing.&nbsp; I just yelled, "Get out of my house now."</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog was so freaked out, that I had to carry
her to the back door and</b>
<br><b>she panicked in my arms as we went through the hallway.&nbsp; For
the next few</b>
<br><b>days, I could not get her back in the house.&nbsp; It was not gone,
although I</b>
<br><b>could not tell this.&nbsp; She spent all of her time in the very
back of the yard</b>
<br><b>wanting me to come out and be with her.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few days later, I had a reason to go out into
a detached garage that</b>
<br><b>has been converted into a family room.&nbsp; As soon as I opened
the door, I felt</b>
<br><b>the presence for the first time.&nbsp; It was unlike any other that
I had felt</b>
<br><b>before.&nbsp; I would not call it evil, but I would call it angry.&nbsp;
My skin wanted</b>
<br><b>to crawl off my bones and run out the door.&nbsp; I just stood there
thinking that</b>
<br><b>I was not going to be chased from my home.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the family room was a cage with two finches
in it.&nbsp; I checked them for</b>
<br><b>food and water and they were fine.&nbsp; Before I left, I said one
more time, "Get</b>
<br><b>out of my house off of my property, I don't even want you in the
street in</b>
<br><b>front of my house.&nbsp; Get out, Now!"&nbsp; Then I left.&nbsp;
About a half hour later, I</b>
<br><b>decided to go back out.&nbsp; I did not want this thing to rule
me with fear, and</b>
<br><b>I was getting pretty edgy.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went in and the feeling was gone.&nbsp; I was
so grateful.&nbsp; But as I turned,</b>
<br><b>I noticed that both birds were dead.&nbsp; This scared me because
I had never had</b>
<br><b>any type of manifestation like this and I took it as a direct threat.&nbsp;
I felt</b>
<br><b>so sorry for the birds, but I thought it was gone now and just wanted
to show</b>
<br><b>me a thing or two before it left.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As my computer was in this room, several days
later, I went out to work</b>
<br><b>when I got to feeling that I was not alone.&nbsp; A battery operated
clock that I</b>
<br><b>have began to tick very loudly.&nbsp; I looked up at it and noticed
that I had not</b>
<br><b>reset it with daylight savings time and glanced back at my computer
to verify</b>
<br><b>that it was exactly one hour ahead.&nbsp; Then I noticed that the
second hand was</b>
<br><b>caught between the seven and eight and could not move forward.&nbsp;
This was</b>
<br><b>causing the loud ticking.&nbsp; I have had these battery operated
clocks do this</b>
<br><b>very thing before, so I decided not to be concerned over it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to communicate with the being and said,
"If you want to</b>
<br><b>communicate, let the clock start back up again."&nbsp; I waited
and the clock</b>
<br><b>continued to malfunction.&nbsp; So I turned back to my work wanting
very much to</b>
<br><b>get it done and out of there even though I thought the clock was
just acting</b>
<br><b>up on its own.&nbsp; For no reason I can think of, I thought, those
birds died</b>
<br><b>because I did not give them water.&nbsp; I turned my head to look
over and at that</b>
<br><b>moment, all the water began to run quickly out of the water bottle
onto the</b>
<br><b>floor of the cage.&nbsp; That was enough for me.&nbsp; I went back
in the main house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, I went back out to lock up, and noticed
that the clock was now</b>
<br><b>working.&nbsp; In fact, it was only forty-eight minutes ahead instead
of one hour.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Those twelve minutes were about how much longer I had been
in the room after</b>
<br><b>it malfunctioned.&nbsp; As soon as I left, it had gone back to working
correctly.</b>
<br><b>Two months later, it is still forty-eight minutes fast...no more</b>
<br><b>malfunctions.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following night, a friend called to catch
up.&nbsp; She is a longtime,</b>
<br><b>very close friend, so I decided to confide in her.&nbsp; We had
meet when I was</b>
<br><b>serving as a new minister of the church she had been a member of
for some</b>
<br><b>time.&nbsp; As soon as I told her, I felt that I had done the wrong
thing.&nbsp; I told</b>
<br><b>her I did not want to say any more while in the house.&nbsp; Too
late, the cornice</b>
<br><b>that was hooked to the wall and ceiling for a year and one half
came down at</b>
<br><b>such a strange angle as to hit me.&nbsp; Six big chunks were taken
out of the wall</b>
<br><b>and ceiling as the screws that I used to put them up were long and
still</b>
<br><b>unbroken.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked her to pray and I would too.&nbsp; A
few minutes later, it was gone</b>
<br><b>and has not returned.&nbsp; It was too much for me and I do not
want to experience</b>
<br><b>any of it again.</b><b></b>

<p><b>I’m sending this to you because I want to tell you about my sleep
paralysis’ experiences. I’ve read in your page that this experience occurs
one or two times as much in a person’s life, but it has happened to me
a lot of times, since the age of twelve.</b>
<br><b>I can’t remember the first time I experienced this terrifying sensation,
but I do remember how I felt about it when it happened.</b>
<br><b>All the times that it took place I remember that I was trying to
sleep, and suddenly, without knowing how, I felt all my body paralyzed,
while I (I mean my brain, mind and conscience) was totally awake, trying
with all my strength to get up, but the effort was always in vain. I too
remember that I could visualize things (such as colors, variations in the
posters that I had, and faces of the people that I knew) and hear sounds
too, such as loud noises, knocks everywhere and music without any kind
of rhythm.</b>
<br><b>After a little time the sensation tended to disappear, but when
that happened I found out my breathing going as fast as a sport car and
I remember myself sweating and totally afraid to go back to sleep again.</b>
<br><b>I mean, that experience isn’t a big deal, but is something that
I don’t wish to anyone, even to my enemies.</b>
<br><b>A long time has passed since I don’t suffer from that, but I wanted
to share my experience with you, and I would like you to know how terrible
it is to feel that you want to get up but your body doesn’t, while you
try by all the ways to scream for help. Excuse me if my English isn’t very
good, I’m from Argentina.</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in 1995. I lived in Robinette, A small
community in West</b>
<br><b>Virginia.&nbsp; Robinette was a place where nothing ever happened.&nbsp;
And if</b>
<br><b>something did happen we weren't apart of it.&nbsp; My father worked
in the</b>
<br><b>coal mines, usually on the graveyard shift.&nbsp; So that gave me
the perfect</b>
<br><b>chance to stay out all night.&nbsp; And I usually did.&nbsp; Me
and my buddy Wayne</b>
<br><b>would go out almost every night.&nbsp; Wayne's dad usually slept
through the</b>
<br><b>night because he had to go to work the next morning.&nbsp; And also
if he did</b>
<br><b>get caught, he wouldnt get into any trouble.&nbsp; He had a very
level headed</b>
<br><b>father.&nbsp; Through all the times that we had our late night meetings.&nbsp;
There</b>
<br><b>is one time that will always remain fresh in my mind.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night I was awakened by a knocking
at my window.&nbsp; The window was</b>
<br><b>next to my bed so I reached up and pulled the curtain back to see
what it</b>
<br><b>was.&nbsp; When I did,&nbsp; there was Wayne standing on my dog
Cub's dog house.</b>
<br><b>Flipping me the bird, and with a wide smile on his face.&nbsp; I
quietly got out</b>
<br><b>of bed making sure not to wake my grandmother.&nbsp; Threw on my
shoes and jacket</b>
<br><b>and made my way out the window.&nbsp; See we had a large dog, he
was a Shepherd/</b>
<br><b>Chow mix.&nbsp; So he had a large doghouse,&nbsp; thats really what
made us able to</b>
<br><b>get in and out the window.&nbsp; Without it we would have a pretty
mean fall.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I finally made it to the saftly of
solid ground, I noticed Wayne</b>
<br><b>had rounded up two bicycles.&nbsp; One belonging to my younger brother
and the</b>
<br><b>other that he rode belonged to his then future step sister.&nbsp;
It was small and</b>
<br><b>pink with white wheels and stickers of the Barbie logo stuck to
it.&nbsp; That</b>
<br><b>was a good laugh to wake up to.&nbsp; Well, we climbed on our only
means of</b>
<br><b>transportation and headed up the road.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the times of night that we would go
out the traffic was almost none.</b>
<br><b>So we could safly ride on the main highway.&nbsp; As we rode we
went past the</b>
<br><b>little convience store that stood right on the edge of our neighborhood.</b>
<br><b>Then, by the small collection of little, clean and nicely framed
house's</b>
<br><b>that people usually referred to as the Circle.&nbsp; A few more
minuets later we</b>
<br><b>made our way past the apartment complex that sat across the creek
from us.</b>
<br><b>We kept riding the bikes further and further.&nbsp; On up the road
we could see</b>
<br><b>the street light that stood in front of the lonley brown trailor.&nbsp;
We made</b>
<br><b>our way past that and was going in the direction of the swimming
hole that</b>
<br><b>was across the road from a friend of ours house.&nbsp; We finally
made it to</b>
<br><b>the swimming hole and from off the tracks we could hear dogs barking
and</b>
<br><b>growling. We could then see them make thier way toward us, as they
ran</b>
<br><b>through a beam of light coming from our friends front porch. We
came to a</b>
<br><b>sudden stop and quickly turned our bikes around and hammered it
down the</b>
<br><b>road in the oppisite direction.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we hurried to get away from the dogs,&nbsp;
We were getting tired and</b>
<br><b>getting tired quick.&nbsp; When the dogs finally stopped with the
chase and the</b>
<br><b>barking we were back at the street light that we had passed earlier.</b>
<br><b>We brought our bikes to a stop and I placed both my tired feet flat</b>
<br><b>on the ground.&nbsp; A few feet from me I saw Wayne do the same.&nbsp;
We stood there</b>
<br><b>right in the middle of the main highway catching our breaths.&nbsp;
The street</b>
<br><b>light that we stopped under wasn't one of the brightest lights I
had ever</b>
<br><b>seen.&nbsp; It left a large circle pattern of light on the ground
about twenty</b>
<br><b>feet wide.&nbsp; What ever stood outside the circle was swallowed
up into the</b>
<br><b>stomach of the night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We stood there a good five minuets in the
crispness of the early</b>
<br><b>summer morning.&nbsp; trying to get our hearts to stop racing and
our leg</b>
<br><b>muscels to loosen up.&nbsp; I really don't remember what made it
catch our</b>
<br><b>eyes,&nbsp; But from the road in front of us we saw something.&nbsp;
It emerged</b>
<br><b>from the darkness.&nbsp; IT really didn't frighten us,&nbsp; Because
the distance</b>
<br><b>from that we saw it, it just looked like somebody else riding a
bike.</b>
<br><b>Me and Wayne kept our eyes on it as it drew closer to us.&nbsp;
Thats when</b>
<br><b>we decided at the same time to say "Hello." to the dark figure.
I remember</b>
<br><b>saying hello a few times.&nbsp; With never a response.&nbsp; It
didn't speak to us at</b>
<br><b>all. It got right upon us and that's when I think that it finally
hit us that</b>
<br><b>something wasn't right about this picture.&nbsp; Because as it went
by us.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>could see that it wasn't riding on the asphalt like we were, but
on the</b>
<br><b>graveled side of the road.&nbsp; And also that it did'nt make a
sound. And we</b>
<br><b>knew if something rode over gravel it would have to make a noise.&nbsp;
We</b>
<br><b>stood there with our eyes wide open and fixed to the dark shadow.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>shadow kept up it's pace and was almost to the other edge of the
light</b>
<br><b>circle.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it finally made it to the other side
of the light it vanished.</b>
<br><b>When we saw that happen thats when I remember just looking at Wayne
and</b>
<br><b>seeing him look at me. And then we suddenly screamed at the top
of our lungs.</b>
<br><b>We headed in the same direction as the thing we saw.&nbsp; But it
would have had</b>
<br><b>to been something pretty fast to have caught us.&nbsp; Because I
would have to say</b>
<br><b>that we probably broke records for bicycle speeds that night.&nbsp;
And on our way</b>
<br><b>home we didn't see anything,&nbsp; nothing at all.&nbsp; On foot
or on a bicycle.</b>

<p><b>Police Story from Australia</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>Anyway, I was working the 7pm to 7 am shift at the "old" police station
in</b>
<br><b>our command. At night you are there alone save for occasional police
car</b>
<br><b>crews dropping in and occasional visits by the public. I have worked
theer</b>
<br><b>MANY MANY MANY times by myself at&nbsp; night and NEVER felt in
the least</b>
<br><b>"spooked" or hear anything untoward.</b>
<br><b>On arrival at 7 pm I relieved the day shift officer, obtained the
Station</b>
<br><b>keys and carefully secured the premises other than the front door
which I</b>
<br><b>sat ajacent to and which remained unlocked until about 10 pm. I
locked it</b>
<br><b>at maybe 10.30 pm. It was a quite night. A few phone calls, a few
police</b>
<br><b>visits and that was it. I settled down to catch up on a HEAP of
paper work</b>
<br><b>and TV watching in between ( and I knew the senior officer on duty
could</b>
<br><b>not bust me for this little pleasure of TV watching as there was
NO WAY</b>
<br><b>into the Station&nbsp; without ME letting him in ). SO I was rleaxed
and as</b>
<br><b>happy as a cop probably can be.....</b>
<br><b>At around 1 am I heard a door in the building slam loudly. I knew
no one</b>
<br><b>else was in the building. I rang the sister station as a precaution
and</b>
<br><b>advised of what I had heard and that I would be doing a routine
search of</b>
<br><b>the buidling just to ensure no intruder ( we store a lot of guns
there,</b>
<br><b>sensitive info etc BUT an intruder seemed very very very improbable
to me</b>
<br><b>in reality and I was not really worried by it ). Search revealed
nothing</b>
<br><b>untoward as fully expected. There is an old cell section ( no loner
used )</b>
<br><b>down stairs with a "false ceiling". A storm brewing outside had
probably</b>
<br><b>created an air current. Back to work and TV watching when bored
with work.</b>
<br><b>Wide awake, relaxed cop. No problems at all thankyou very much.</b>
<br><b>About 2 am decide I need to go for a shit. Downstairs to the toliets
)(</b>
<br><b>near the old cells ). Sit in one of two cubicles in the mens. Both
had</b>
<br><b>their respective door open when I walked in.</b>
<br><b>Sitting there doing "my business" - no problem. Stand up and pull
up my</b>
<br><b>pants and I hear VERY LOUD and VERY "PRESENT" a sound that I can
only</b>
<br><b>accurately describe as being similar to a toilet roll being unravelled</b>
<br><b>very quickly - "clatter, clatter, clatter". But real LOUD. Cop thinks
:"Oh,</b>
<br><b>there IS someone else in the building, another cop must have been
sleeping</b>
<br><b>in the station without me knowing it, if the bosses find him or
her</b>
<br><b>they'll be in DEEP trouble!".</b>
<br><b>Soooooo I open my cubicle door and obviously see that there is no
one in</b>
<br><b>the male toilet - which I knew anyway because I saw no one when
I walked</b>
<br><b>in AND i heard nothing when I was sitting there ( the door into
the toilet is</b>
<br><b>VERY noisy and it had not opened since I entered ). So the noice
MUST have</b>
<br><b>come from the female toilets I deduct. I yell out, "Hey, whose there?".
No</b>
<br><b>answer. I leave the male toilets and say similar to , "Anyone in
there?".</b>
<br><b>No answer. So I look inside ( that is, I open the door and walk
in). No</b>
<br><b>one in there. ALSO I note that the toilet roll in the single open
cubicle is</b>
<br><b>NOT the type capable of clattering ( unlike those in the male toilets</b>
<br><b>which ARE capable of "clattering" ).</b>
<br><b>O.K., now, I'll be honest, I'm wondering exactly what is ACTUALLY
going</b>
<br><b>on. The noise was loud, close, "present", real, even "electric"
if you know</b>
<br><b>what I mean - it really SHOCKED me, it was so very unexpected and
CLOSE -</b>
<br><b>I was wide awake and consider myself crazy in the way many cops
are just a</b>
<br><b>tiny bit "crazy" BUT real sane too.</b>
<br><b>Return to the main desk up stairs. Sit down. NOW I hear more noises
down</b>
<br><b>stairs.....hard to describe BUT basically like stuff being moved
around,</b>
<br><b>muffled like, maybe even footsteps. Call sister station again. Advise
of</b>
<br><b>"situation". Advise that I want a car crew to make its way down
on a</b>
<br><b>non-urgent basis due to unexplained continuing noises. Indicate
that a</b>
<br><b>full search needs to be made as only explanation that seems at all
logical or</b>
<br><b>rational IS that there really IS someone else in the Station besides
me.</b>
<br><b>Feel VERY strongly I'm being watched. Electric feeling somehow,
hard to</b>
<br><b>describe, but electric is best word for it. Something close and
"present"</b>
<br><b>and very real. I'm scared because in my HEART I damn well KNOW the</b>
<br><b>building IS secure, there is NO ONE else here and I just DO NOT
understand what is</b>
<br><b>going on.</b>
<br><b>But I search anyway. Real tactically "just in case". All doors and
windows</b>
<br><b>checked - all 100% secure. Creep around like a ghost myself for
15 minutes</b>
<br><b>or so. There IS indeed no one besides ME in the Station.</b>
<br><b>Car crew arrives. Expected ridicule of course forthcoming in plenty.
Haw</b>
<br><b>haw haw......well to be fully expected!</b>
<br><b>Mant tests undertaken to replicate "the clatter clatter noise" -
air con</b>
<br><b>turned off and on, water turned off and on - NOTHING that sounds
anything</b>
<br><b>like what I heard. More ridicule.</b>
<br><b>Go down to male toilet AND in the cubicle next to mine discover
an</b>
<br><b>unravelled toilet roll totally scrunched up at the end - the type
of roll</b>
<br><b>that will go clatter clatter clatter if pulled HARD. Is this why
it</b>
<br><b>sounded so loud, and close and "present"? Or was it like that BEFORE
I even</b>
<br><b>started my shift? - who knows, no one ever will.</b>
<br><b>I then started to make OPEN inquiires about other officer's experiences
in</b>
<br><b>the Station . Because I was the FIRST to be OPEN about it well guess
what</b>
<br><b>- numerous officers come forward with stories ( and they ALL say,
"I was</b>
<br><b>afraid to say anything casue I felt people would laugh at me..."
or</b>
<br><b>similar ). Footsteps, doors slamming, doors closing slowly ( this
one is VERY hard</b>
<br><b>to figure out!!) , sounds of people in the upstairs kitchen cooking,</b>
<br><b>electric feelings and a sense of being watched by someone very near
by.</b>
<br><b>Lots of stories from maybe a dozen different people currently serving</b>
<br><b>there. Some of them very down to earth and tough people EVEN by
the</b>
<br><b>standard of cops!</b>
<br><b>Research with some older officers reveal three "ghosts" associated
with</b>
<br><b>the station. (1) Destitute man dies in old cells maybe 20 years
ago (2) man</b>
<br><b>shot dead in 1930s by police haunts it ( not feasible in my view
as</b>
<br><b>Station was build later than his death - but tell me if I'm wrong
- his photo is</b>
<br><b>hanging in the stair way AND the really FUNNY thing is I actually
look</b>
<br><b>EXACTLY like the cop who shot him, his photo also hanging next to
his in</b>
<br><b>stairway....but I think that's all just coincidence)&nbsp; (3) story
that</b>
<br><b>BEFORE station was built a woman, possibly a prostitute, was murdered
in the</b>
<br><b>house where teh Station now stands ( unconfirmed if true BUT repeated
by many</b>
<br><b>difefrent sources...).</b>
<br><b>When I think about what happened, even though fairly undramatic
by</b>
<br><b>comparison to many so called ghost stories, I really CANNOT believe
that</b>
<br><b>what happened DID happen - except that it DID!. I can't stress how
close</b>
<br><b>and real and electric it felt.</b>
<br><b>There is honestly still no rational or obvious explanation for that
very</b>
<br><b>close and loud noise - and BELIEVE me we have tried darn HARD to
find</b>
<br><b>one.The door slamming CAN be explained by a false ceiling over the
old</b>
<br><b>cells where an air current can be generated. Doors closing slowly
and</b>
<br><b>purposefully, as desribed by a fellow officer, cannot be so easily</b>
<br><b>explained by the false ceiling I'm afraid.</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;Family Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: CrimeWriter878@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Interesting site you have.&nbsp; I come from an unusual family.&nbsp;
These are all</b>
<br><b>true stories.</b><b></b>
<p><b>My maternal grandmother died in 1993.&nbsp; She lived alone in a
small two bedroom</b>
<br><b>house in Houston.&nbsp; My mother inherited the property, and she
leased it to my</b>
<br><b>sister's boyfriend, an attorney.&nbsp; A couple of weeks later,
the attorney</b>
<br><b>reported hearing strange noises.&nbsp; Then he said faucets would
come on by</b>
<br><b>themselves at night, and that he would often wake up to find someone
had put</b>
<br><b>the chain on the front door (he locked but never chained the door).&nbsp;
When his</b>
<br><b>blender came on in the middle of the night, I think he had enough
and he</b>
<br><b>moved out.&nbsp; My mother tried to sell the house, then my sister's
new</b>
<br><b>boyfriend, a financial analyst, offered to rent it.&nbsp; Within
weeks he was</b>
<br><b>reporting the same things--except he also said he saw an old woman
standing</b>
<br><b>at the foot of his bed one night.&nbsp; When this guy and my sister
decided to get</b>
<br><b>married, he called in a priest to "exorcise" the place.&nbsp; But
then he went out</b>
<br><b>to the garage and found all his tools scattered and his golf clubs
stuffed</b>
<br><b>underneath his car.&nbsp; He called the priest back, and had him
bless the garage.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My sister and he ultimately tore down the house, and built
a new, larger one</b>
<br><b>on the lot.&nbsp; They got married, and had a baby.&nbsp; A few
years passed, then two</b>
<br><b>weeks ago, their two-year old son said he saw "gramma" in a tree
in the</b>
<br><b>backyard.&nbsp; A two year old kid.&nbsp; We're still all a little
perplexed over this</b>
<br><b>one.</b>
<br><b>My father's side of the family is even spookier.&nbsp; His father,
my grandfather,</b>
<br><b>was born in 1896 (died in 1995 at age 99).&nbsp; When my grandfather
was 8 or 9,</b>
<br><b>he was very close to his cousins, aged 8 and 6.&nbsp; One day, the
6 year old boy,</b>
<br><b>James, died suddenly, as children often did then.&nbsp; A couple
of weeks later,</b>
<br><b>the 8 year old came running inside and told his mother he had seen
"Jimmy</b>
<br><b>sitting on a cloud, asking him to come up and play."&nbsp; The boy's
mother</b>
<br><b>explained that his brother was gone, and he should not imagine things.&nbsp;
But</b>
<br><b>the boy insisted he had seen what he had seen.&nbsp; He died that</b>
<br><b>night--inexplicably.</b>
<br><b>When my father's mother, born in 1903, was 10 or 12, her father
was a</b>
<br><b>railroad engineer (drove the trains).&nbsp; They had a phone, but
the railyard did</b>
<br><b>not.&nbsp; If the railyard needed my great grandfather in the middle
of the night,</b>
<br><b>they sent a runner to bang on his bedroom window.&nbsp; Now, my
grandmother (who</b>
<br><b>died in 1986) had an aunt living in Cincinnati (my grandmother grew
up in New</b>
<br><b>Orleans).&nbsp; This aunt kept writing asking for my grandmother--then
a young</b>
<br><b>girl--to visit.&nbsp; She didn't want to go, and kept putting her
off.&nbsp; One night,</b>
<br><b>my grandmother was waken up by a banging on her window.&nbsp; She
went and woke up</b>
<br><b>her father, and he went to the railyard.&nbsp; Then she and her
mother had hot</b>
<br><b>chocolate in the kitchen.&nbsp; Her father came home, and said the
railroad had</b>
<br><b>not sent over a runner.&nbsp; Just then the phone rang, with the
news that the</b>
<br><b>aunt in Cincinnati had died, at the same time my grandmother heard
the</b>
<br><b>banging on the window.</b>
<br><b>One last story:&nbsp; When my mother was pregnant with my sisters
(identical</b>
<br><b>twins, now aged 43), old Aunt Alice was still alive (I don't remember
her).</b>
<br><b>Supposedly, Aunt Alice said she would not live to see the girls
born.&nbsp; They</b>
<br><b>said Aunt Alice, a spinster who lived with her twin sister, could
make a</b>
<br><b>coffee table "walk" 2 or 3 feet across the floor.&nbsp; Aunt Alice
touched my</b>
<br><b>mothers abdomen, and said "name the first child after me."&nbsp;
Aunt Alice did</b>
<br><b>die before my sisters were born, and my folks named the first one
"Alice."</b>
<br><b>My sisters are identical in every way, except that Alice has a natural
one</b>
<br><b>inch blonde streak in her dark brown hair--just like Aunt Alice
had.</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp;Visits After Death</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: downsclan@desertlinc.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>i`ve been reading this web site for two days strait.&nbsp; ieven
puy in some of my past hostory before i found out what the site was about.&nbsp;
i am a believer and have been raised that way since as long as i can remember.&nbsp;
the only thing i haven`t delt with as of yet is a sighting, but i`ll tell
you about 'sightings', in dreams</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;let me give you a little of my family history...&nbsp; my
mothers side of the family isn`t very mentaly stable,&nbsp; actually the
most of us are bi-polar.&nbsp; basicly we lackly we don`t make a certian
chemical in our brain (it happens to be salt ) so we go into a deppesion
and do stupid things&nbsp;&nbsp; well as i was saying when my mother was
5 my&nbsp; grandma joan killed herself,&nbsp; she was only 35 and left
5 kids behind,&nbsp; the youngest being 2 almost three.&nbsp; when i was
11 my mom desided she had to go shopping because she was sure she had to
go on a trip soon,&nbsp; she just had a feeling.&nbsp; i remember asking
my uncle and daddy if they needed beer, even checked the icebox before
i left with my mom, they didn`t need any.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;needless to say when we got back my uncle told my mom they
had to go back to the store to get more beer.&nbsp; i started to argue
but my daddy made me stop.after my uncle and mom left my daddy sat me and
my little sister down to tell us that my grandmother( my moms adoptive
mom ) had died the night before. soon there after my cousin called to talk
to my uncle and me (she was my best friend at the time ).&nbsp; as i was
talking to my cousin i told her about a dream i had about our other grandma
joan (the one who died years earlier) telling me that no matter what happens
things would be ok.&nbsp; then she started to tell me she had the same
dream!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;time went by but i never forgot the visit. my grandma joan
always came to me in my dreams when thing were going bad for me,letting
me know things will be ok.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;in may of 99 mt mother took her own life at the age of 45.&nbsp;
she was so proud that she lived passed 35 unlike her mom.&nbsp; i`ll admit
i had a real hard relationship with my mom my entire life, thats what makes
this the funneist of all.&nbsp; a couple of months after my mom&nbsp; died
i had a dream about her and it wasn`t nice.&nbsp; she used my son to make
a point.&nbsp; in my dream my mom, my husband, and my self were sitting
in a room together because by son had just died (don`t worry actually alive
and well ).my mom told me to go back in the room my son was, she had something
to show me so i went.&nbsp; when i went into the room my son was sitting
up in bed so i rushed to him and hugged him very close.&nbsp; he pushed
himself away and told me that even though people leave they will always
be with us. thats when i realized he was still dead.&nbsp; right then my
grandma joan showed up and started to yell at my mom, telling her that
she was doing it wrong and that she didn`t have to use my kids like that,
she didn`t even have to scare me like that.&nbsp; she grabbed my mom by
the arm and walked my mom to a very bright light telling her that if she
wanted to see me again she had to learn a few things...then they were gone.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;i`ll admit i woke up in a cold sweat and i ran out of bed
to make sure my son was ok but later after i talked to my aunt on my daddys
side i learned that even when you cross over you still have things to learn
and that my mom won`t visit me until my grandma joan deems it ok.&nbsp;
to this day i still haven`t had another dream about my mom but i know it
will come.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; other people see things, feels things, or hear things,...
i dream things.&nbsp; past present future,&nbsp; even things that don`t
make sense at the time but now do.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Daddy'S Little Girl</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Koda67@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Ghostly incident began back in 1998,
when I met a woman from work</b>
<br><b>that I am now married to.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I never had the chance
to meet her</b>
<br><b>father.&nbsp; He had cancer and passed on just as his daughter and
I became a</b>
<br><b>couple.&nbsp; After a period of time, she and I moved in together
at her</b>
<br><b>residence.&nbsp; One night, I heard a loud bang come from somewhere
in the house.</b>
<br><b>She heard it too, and after awhile suggested that the noise might
be her</b>
<br><b>daughter turning over in her sleep and hitting the wall with her
elbow,(her</b>
<br><b>daughter's room was next to our bedroom).&nbsp; That made sense
to me, so we went</b>
<br><b>back to sleep, because we didn't hear anything else.&nbsp; I went
downstairs in</b>
<br><b>the morning to get the coffee started, and noticed a picture that
had been</b>
<br><b>hanging on the wall next to the front door was lying on the ground.&nbsp;
The nail</b>
<br><b>that had been holding the picture up had been driven into the wall
at an</b>
<br><b>upward slant, so something must have picked this picture off the
nail and</b>
<br><b>thrown it to the ground.&nbsp; It was strange, but I still joked
that it was her</b>
<br><b>father letting me know that he didn't appreciate me being there.&nbsp;
The picture</b>
<br><b>was nothing though, because I was about to see what my wife (and
I) believe</b>
<br><b>to be the ghost of her father.&nbsp; About a week after the picture
incident, it</b>
<br><b>was probably 3:00 or 4:00am that I woke up from a heavy sleep.&nbsp;
In the</b>
<br><b>bedroom, standing next to the door appeared to be her father.&nbsp;
He had his</b>
<br><b>arms crossed in front of him and he was just standing there watching
me</b>
<br><b>sleep.&nbsp; I didn't get very excited, because when you wake in
the middle of the</b>
<br><b>night you see things all the time when your eyes are tired.&nbsp;
Also, I had seen</b>
<br><b>a couple pictures of her father and thought I might have his image
in the</b>
<br><b>back of my mind.&nbsp; I closed my eyes and opened them several
times, but he was</b>
<br><b>still always there.&nbsp; I finally just went back to sleep.&nbsp;
When my wife woke up</b>
<br><b>in the morning, I began joking with her about seeing her father
in the</b>
<br><b>bedroom earlier that night.&nbsp; She asked me what he was doing,
so I told her</b>
<br><b>what I saw.&nbsp; She began staring at me in awe when I told her
how he was</b>
<br><b>standing with his arms crossed.&nbsp; She told me how in his life
he always stood</b>
<br><b>in the corner with his arms folded and watched the family.&nbsp;
This is the</b>
<br><b>really strange part.&nbsp; At the time of this incident, my wife
and I were</b>
<br><b>correctional officers for the local county prison.&nbsp; Our uniforms

<br><b>blue shirt with dark blue slacks.&nbsp; I told her that this was
going to sound</b>
<br><b>even more crazy, but it looked like he was wearing something that
looked like</b>
<br><b>our work uniforms.&nbsp; She told me that a factory he used to work
for had work</b>
<br><b>clothes almost the same color as our uniforms, light blue shirt
and dark</b>
<br><b>pants.&nbsp; I had never seen a picture of her father standing with
his arms</b>
<br><b>crossed or in his work clothes, so I had no way of&nbsp; knowing
those things</b>
<br><b>about him.&nbsp; This is a true story that still gives my wife the
chills three</b>
<br><b>years later.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Candles Walking</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: chooch4@prodigy.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>To say the old house I lived in as a young girl was spooky is an
understatement.&nbsp; From the time we moved in until the time I married
and moved away, the upstairs bedrooms worried and frightened me.&nbsp;
There were two bedrooms upstairs and to get to the second one you must
walk through the first which is reached from downstairs by narrow, steep
stairs.&nbsp; I have slept in both bedrooms and both have given me cause
for chills but the bedroom at the very top of the stairs seemed the more
ominous and the one in which I had more "experiences."&nbsp; I have lain
in bed, paralized, as something large, dark, and with oval yellow eyes
sat upon my legs.&nbsp; I have had girlfriends staying over who have seen
a gray-haired woman standing on the stairs, and I have heard breathing
as if the house itself were sighing over past histories.&nbsp; One night
in particular (although the "hag" on my legs was most terrifying) stands
out to forever make me a believer in ghosts.&nbsp; My bed was against the
wall away from the stairs so I would be able to see anyone walking up.&nbsp;
My two brothers were in the other bedroom and I was alone.&nbsp; It was
late and for some reason I awoke, uneasy.&nbsp; I sleep light to this day,
one ear always alert.&nbsp; There were no cars going by and the house was
lying silent.&nbsp; Suddenly, I saw something coming up the stairs.&nbsp;
Or rather I saw two candles coming up the stairs.&nbsp; Nothing was holding
them.&nbsp; They were being carried at what would be waist to chest high.&nbsp;
They glided up the stairs slowly, went across my bedroom and entered the
other bedroom.&nbsp; I immediately broke out in a cold sweat.&nbsp; I heard
nothing when they moved and I heard nothing from the other bedroom.&nbsp;
I took a deep breath and quietly crawled out of bed and turned on the light.&nbsp;
I peeked into my brothers' room.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; They were quietly
sleeping and all was well.&nbsp; I wasn't.&nbsp; I stayed awake the rest
of the night, worrying.&nbsp; I had almost talked myself into believing
the lights were car lights but I would always come back to the fact that
I could see the tops of the candles aglow, not just the candle flame.&nbsp;
It was this experience that led me to question my mother and father about
our house.&nbsp; It turns out not one but two people had passed away in
the upstairs bedroom, my brothers' to be exact.&nbsp; It would seem, at
least, on one occassion they came back for a visit.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Dog</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SpiritWalker1042@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>The first time I saw it was when my&nbsp; dog Bear died. He had been
sleeping</b>
<br><b>under the truck when I accidentally ran over him and I really felt
bad about</b>
<br><b>it. That night I went out on my deck and decided to take some pictures
and</b>
<br><b>see if I could catch anything. Well when I got my pictures back
I got a real</b>
<br><b>surprise. In three of my pictures I caught a white orblike thing.
It was</b>
<br><b>shaped like a circle with its top and bottom were flatted out. In
the middle</b>
<br><b>were two dark eyes. In the first picture it was looking right at
me and in</b>
<br><b>the next picture it was moving away from me and in the third picture
it was</b>
<br><b>by the tree next to the deck. I didn't know what to make of it.
Well a few</b>
<br><b>weeks later I decided to go out on my deck and take some pictures
again. When</b>
<br><b>I got them back, there it was again. I don't who or what it is.
There is</b>
<br><b>absolutely nothing out in my pasture that would cause this to happen.
The</b>
<br><b>other night I went outside on the deck to enjoy the night air.&nbsp;
My hubby was</b>
<br><b>asleep upstairs and except for my two cats I was alone. When the
lights are</b>
<br><b>on in the living room, the light from the living room hits the trees
that are</b>
<br><b>near the house. I was thinking about that thing I had caught in
my pictures</b>
<br><b>and was looking in the direction of the trees when someone or something</b>
<br><b>passed silently infront of the window, blocking out the light as
they passed.</b>
<br><b>I went back in the house to see if my&nbsp; hubby had gotten up
but found him</b>
<br><b>sound asleep upstairs. It dawned on me that whoever or whatever
it was it</b>
<br><b>couldn't have been my hubby because it blocked out all the light
as it passed</b>
<br><b>by and my hubby's not THAT big around. Perhaps its was my ghost
that I caught</b>
<br><b>on film letting me know it was there.... Who knows.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Happy Haunting!!</b>

<p><b>Apartment Poltergeist</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: hant7213@concentric.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>In 1997, my fiancee and I moved into an old apartment complex near
the campus of Southwest Texas State University (The Balcones Apartments,
401 N.&nbsp; Fredericksburg, #404, San Marcos, Texas 78666).&nbsp; My fiancee
was going to school at Southwest, and since the apartment was very close
to campus, it seemed perfect.&nbsp; The apartment was sort of run-down,
and it looked as if it had been built in the 1950's.&nbsp; Our apartment
was on the top floor.&nbsp; We were very happy while we were moving in
our first place of residence together.&nbsp; However, as soon as we had
moved all of our things in and began to unpack, my fiancee and I became
very ill.&nbsp; We both felt as though we were coming down with flu.&nbsp;
We were also very fatigued, but we thought it was due to the exertion of
moving.&nbsp; Well, over the next few days, we got worse.&nbsp; We were
both violently ill - bed-ridden and vomiting constantly.&nbsp; I remember
that I couldn't even hold my head up without being in pain - it was just
that bad.&nbsp; Neither of us had never been that ill, and we haven't been
since.&nbsp; Anyway, we got over being sick after about 7-8 days of it.&nbsp;
Shortly thereafter, strange phenomenon began to take place.&nbsp; I would
see shadows out of the corner of my eye, but when I looked there was nothing
there.&nbsp; My fiancee and I once saw the coffee cups that we had hanging
on hooks in the kitchen swinging rapidly back and forth,but there was no
gust of wind or anything that could've caused the movement.&nbsp; It was
very eerie!&nbsp; One time, I got home late at night and was all alone
while my fiancee was at the library.&nbsp; I just wanted to read a little
bit, then go to sleep.&nbsp; As I was reading, I heard clanging noises
coming from the kitchen.&nbsp; I got up to see what it was, and as I got
closer to the kitchen I heard pots and pans rattling like crazy in the
cabinet.&nbsp; We didn't have any pets, so it obviously was something else.&nbsp;
I was terrified, but I thought it might have been a rat or a mouse, so
I opened the cabinets and the noise just stopped.&nbsp; There were no signs
of any rodent. It was so scary!&nbsp; After that, for about an hour, I
kept hearing the bathroom door creak. And I just felt as though I was being
watched intensely.&nbsp; It was so creepy!&nbsp; Then there was a time
when my fiancee and I were laying in bed at night talking, and we kept
hearing slow, pacing footsteps on the roof!&nbsp; We were on the top floor,
and so we were scared to death.&nbsp; Especially since the footsteps were
slow and methodical.&nbsp; My fiancee got sick of it, and yelled, "Shut
Up!!!", and the footsteps actually stopped!!!&nbsp; It was weird! Then
all of a sudden, we both felt a strange feeling.&nbsp; I don't know how
to describe it except it was a feeling of impending doom.&nbsp; We turned
on the lights and my fiancee said, "Look! The branches of eucalyptus are
bending down by themselves!"&nbsp; I looked and lo and behold, our vase
filled with eucalyptus on top of the dresser was being touched by the poltergeist!&nbsp;
The branches were bending down as though someone were trying to smell them!
It was the most terrifying thing to witness! After that, we knew we were
not alone.&nbsp; The poltergeist also once took a glass and filled it with
crumbled crackers, milk, ketchup, and mustard, and left it in the middle
of the counter.&nbsp; It was pretty gross.&nbsp; I saw the glass when I
got home from work and I thought it must have been my fiancee, but when
I asked why he did that, he didn't have a clue what I was talking about!&nbsp;
The final time we experienced strange happenings was right after we got
married.&nbsp; We were married, and after the reception, I put our wedding
cake into the refrigerator.&nbsp; Then, my husband and I went on our honeymoon.&nbsp;
When we returned a few days later, we discovered that the refrigerator
had been unplugged!&nbsp; The cake was melted and ruined.&nbsp; I was furious,
so I called the apartment manager to ask if any maintenance had been done
in our apartment.&nbsp; And he said no one had been in the apartment to
his knowledge.&nbsp; I think it was the evil, malicious spirit telling
us that it was not happy for us getting married.&nbsp; We moved shortly
after that, but I've never been able to forget some of the things that
happened in that apartment.&nbsp; I don't know the history of the apartment
building or the land.&nbsp; I do know there are Indian burial grounds very
close to the campus.&nbsp; My husband and I visited them several times.&nbsp;
That may or may not be why that apartment is haunted, but one thing for
sure - it is haunted by a very sinister spirit.</b><b></b>

<br><b>EXTREMLY HAUNTED TOWN HOUSE</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: scryer75@ipa.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>This ordinary town house looks just like an old house,</b>
<br><b>but..... it's haunted. people have reported seeing a women in the
house,</b>
<br><b>their belongings are always being replaced, and a cold hand up their
neck.</b>
<br><b>the house was built in 1905 and a rich women with maids</b>
<br><b>lived there. years later, she dies of cancer. then the house was
bought by my grandpa.</b>
<br><b>when I was four years old in 1994, I was playing up stairs,</b>
<br><b>there is a big mirrior then was built into the house in 1905.</b>
<br><b>I was looking in the the mirrior normally like I always did.</b>
<br><b>putting on make-up, brushing hair, etc.</b>
<br><b>when right behind me in the mirrior I saw a women that was dressed
in a long blue dress , wearing a bonet , black boots that were tall , and
also wearing an aporn.</b>
<br><b>it looked rather like a maid.</b>
<br><b>I swirled around to look. no one there. but she was still in the
mirrior. she was moving a little. she was a white person,</b>
<br><b>not a black person. in a few minuetes, she was gone.</b>
<br><b>but my mom has herd her name being called from her aunt ethel or
her mom essie.</b>
<br><b>my brother used to leave his toys laying out for like about 5</b>
<br><b>minuetes, then when he came back....</b>
<br><b>they were gone. 1961, when mom was 11 the age I am now, she saw
the women who died of cancer standing on the stairs. then she ran up the
stairs and disapeared.</b>
<br><b>the house on Garrison sreet in Carthage Missouri is still standing
and is forever and always will be haunted. this is a real true story. I
hope to see some more ghosts again someday. I love getting scared. I like
to tell ghost stories to people in the dark. alot of them I make up. but
some of them are true.</b>
