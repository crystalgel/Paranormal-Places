Weird Dream<br>
<br>
<br>
By: yayfloyyd@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Ok so I'm a 15 year old who lives in California. when I was in 2nd
grade my coolest grandfather died. So ok my mom always says when you
dream about a relative that has passed on it means a new family member
will be born soon. So in 3rd grade I dreamed a random dream about my
grandfather. a couple months later my cousin was pregnant with a girl.
Later when I turned 13 I had a dream about my Grandfather talking to me
asking how my life was, I heard about ghosts of loved ones contacting
you thourgh dreams, so I'm assuming that. then after that my same
cousin was pregnant with a boy. I don't know if&nbsp; my dreams were a
true physic experience or just a coincidence. thanks for reading this
and oh ya I love your site. read it every day, and hope to become a
ghost researcher.<br>

Mrs gibson the vice principal, spoke very slowly, and sympathetically,
I looked at the preps and looking for vincents happy face only to see
him red eyed and sad.<br>
Mrs gibson slowly said "vincents dad has died, sadly last Wednesday" <br>
Me and caitlin looked at each other. Wide eyed. <br>

Strange Goings On<br>
<br>
By: STEVENMCNEILL77@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
hi tina, my name is steven and im from northern ireland. i witnessed
something when i was just seven years old that to this day still has an
imprint on my mind.<br>
when my mother met my stepfather we moved from a place in coleraine
called winston way into a flat on a street called&nbsp; westbourne
crescent, also in coleraine. it wasn't long after moving into this flat
that my mother noticed that there was a small bird which would sit at
the kitchen window every morning tapping its beck on the glass. we
didn't really take much notice to the bird, we just thought that it
must have been fed at the window by the previous occupants of the flat.<br>
our flat was a two story flat with just one other below us. in the
other flat lived a family of four. the layout of the flat was two
bedrooms one on either side of the stairs, which led from the front
door. my room was on the left and mum and dads room was on the right.
the landing at the top of the stairs was square in shape and quite
small. opposite my room door was the door to the kitchen, and next to
that was the living room door. if you stepped out of my bedroom door
and went directly left that would be the bathroom.<br>
my room was a small rectangular shaped room with the door opening into
the room itself. my bed faced the door on the opposite side of the room
and it was in the this bed that i started to witness something which to
me was not normal.<br>
i was asleep in bed one night when suddenly i woke for no reason. i did
not open my eyes fully but enough to see that there was two silhouettes
at the bottom of my bed. one of&nbsp; which was smaller than the other.
they made their way towards the open kitchen door and vanished into the
shadows of the room. i closed my eyes and began to cry loud enough so
that my mother would here. my mother came to my room and i told her
what had happened. she took me to her room where i slept until morning.<br>
frequently after that that the bird which tapped at the window in the
kitchen would waken me with its constant tapping. i believe the tapping
would start at around six in the morning, i do not the exact time
because i would always go back to sleep only to be stirred by my mother
for school at 8am.<br>
a few months after my first scare i was asleep in my bed with a torch
because of the fright i had received previous, i was woke again. only
this time when i squinted my eyes to the bottom of the bed i discovered
there was a man standing at the foot of my bed with a young boy. both
of which were dressed in oliver twist like clothes. their faces were
blackened with a black dust. i closed my eyes again and lay there for
what seemed like forever until i fell asleep again.<br>
my mother never believe what i was telling her about what i had seen.
she said i must have been dreaming or imagined it. nevertheless she
moved my bed so that it was behind my bedroom door when it was open.<br>
moving my bed did not deter what i could only think were ghosts. i
awoke with the sound of the tapping bird as i did almost every morning.
it was daylight through the curtains. out of the corner of my eye i
could see a silhouette of a person moving along the side of my bed and
across the bottom. i said to myself it must be dad and went back to
sleep. later that morning when i got out of bed i asked dad what he was
looking for in my room and he said " i wasnt in your room son ". i knew
then that it was the man that i had seen previous at the foot of my
bed. that was the last time i ever witnessed them.<br>
i am now 26 years old and this has been in my head since i was seven.<br>

My Story<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Here's a little story that you might want to add! English is not my
native language, so if you see mistakes or anything, feel free to edit
it! :)<br>
That story didn't really hapenned to me, but to family members who are
not really the kind of people to believe in that kind of thing
(althought they kinda do now a bit more!). My uncle (my mom's brother)
was with his wife's family because his step-mother was dying, it was
the end of August. Just before her last moment, she was confused in her
speech and was saying senseless things, but then she said (in French so
I translate): "Mrs Jacques told me in January". My uncle and his wife
were now a bit confused because Mrs Jacques is actually my grandmother,
and the two ladies had met only one, only the time to saluate each
other. And my grandmother actually died in January, so everybody
thought it very strange. Then she went on saying "She's pulling my
legs, she wants me to go...She's with a man, but I don't know who he
is, I don't know him." We all thought it could be my grandfather who
died years ago. We couldn't say for sure, but it was strange enough for
my uncle to call and wake my mother to tell him he just had news from
their mom...<br>

Step Father Followed Us<br>
<br>
<br>
By: star_bytch_0304@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
After the death of my step-father I was relieved. Finally we were at
peace and able to live our lives without the fear of wondering when the
next drunken stuper would occur. My step-father had commited suicide by
drug overdose when he discovered he was going to jail for killing two
people in a car crash. His spirit had haunted the house we lived in
before we moved for two years. It started small at first with footsteps
and little noises coming from the kitchen. When my uncle moved in with
us, the noises became more violent with bangs on the walls and doors,
slamming of cabinet doors and drawers, the floors being banged at like
it was coming from the basement. My uncle said he had never heard the
noises, nor mom or sister. My brother told me he could hear the noises
too. A few months before we moved to where I live now at about 2 in the
morning I awoke to the heavy smell of vodka in my bedroom. My
step-father drank vodka everyday. I got up and left the room and the
smell of vodka was gone. I went to the bathroom, feeling sick and threw
up numerous times before i was left on the bathroom floor, dry heaving
and feeling terrible. My mom had found me there the next day and took
me to the hospital. The doctor found nothing wrong with me and said it
was just a fever. I had told mom about the vodka smell in my room but
she didn`t believe me and brushed it off. When we moved to my new
house, things seemed uneasy. There were no noises at night and the air
seemed lighter. But soon after the first month we lived there, the air
seemed to feel heavier. Or as if my body had gotten more dence and it
seemed hard to walk up the stairs. I was sitting on my computer one
night about a year ago at around 2 in the morning when I felt someone
watching me. My uncle had moved out months ago so I knew he wasn`t
watching me. The doors and windows were shut and the blinds were down.
I reached over to pick up my cigarettes when I felt this hard slap
across my face. It had enough force to throw me back to the floor. I
looked around, seeing no one was there. The smell of vodka quickly
filled the room and I knew it was my step-father and he had followed
us. Feeling scared, I turned off my computer and ran to my room, going
to bed. The next morning I woke up and went to the bathroom to brush my
teeth and I saw a large bruise on my face. It looked like a hand print.
The coming months were no different. I would awaken to feeling pain all
around my body. I awake one morning feeling a burning sensation on my
leg and i looked and there were 3 gashes on my leg. I was more
frightened than ever before. Mom had humored me and asked a preist to
perform a blessing onto the house. The occurences stopped but I`m still
scared. I just hope it has finally ended.<br>

The Little Girl<br>
<br>
&nbsp;By: ms_lmartinez@juno.com<br>
<br>
<br>
My niece &#8220;Pretty&#8221; was about 4 years old when she went to visit her
great grandparents in Thermal, Ca. It wasn&#8217;t her first time; in fact
she had been going on a regular basis since birth. She always found a
place to go and play, and entertain herself with her friend. On this
particular day she was playing in grammas room. When her little friend
came in and began to turn the light switch off and on. The little girl
had blond pig tails and a dress on always. &#8220;Pretty&#8221; asked her to stop,
because she was playing. The little girl didn&#8217;t stop. After a short
while of pleading with her friend she called her mother. Her mother
walked into the room and asked her what was wrong. Pretty complained
about the little girl. <br>
&#8220;The little girl won&#8217;t stop turning the lights off and on&#8221; she said.<br>
&nbsp;&#8220;What little girl?&#8217; asked her mother.&nbsp; <br>
&#8220;The little girl that was here!&#8221; she replied. <br>
&#8220;Pretty&#8221; her began &#8220;there are no other little girls here. You&#8217;re the
only one. No one else lives here, just grandma and grandpa,&#8221;<br>
&nbsp;That&#8217;s when Pretty realized her little friend wasn&#8217;t real, and
wasn&#8217;t a neighbor either. She began to cry and tell about how she
always played with a little girl at grandmas&#8217; house and she thought it
was a cousin. She never learned her name, and she hasn&#8217;t seen her
since. <br>
You see, there was only one house close enough to have neighbors but it
had just been &#8220;unoccupied&#8221; by the old man who lived there, and grandma
lives on what once was the town of Arabia.<br>

Old Trail Road<br>
<br>
By: maggie40@earthlink.net<br>
<br>
It was nineteen-ninety and my husband, Jamie and I were so excited too
finally buy a house to call our own.&nbsp; It was located in the
country and on two acres of land.&nbsp; It was what we were looking
for.&nbsp; Two car garage, three bedrooms, enough land for chickens,
ducks and goats, but we never imagine the experiences that awaited us,
until after six months of living in that evil
house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
At first, there were little things, like knockings at the doors and
windows, and locked doors shutting on their own, sounds I thought might
be in my mind or caused by the wind.&nbsp; At night it was the
worse.&nbsp; I would lay in bed beside Jamie and my son Zach, hearing
music and talking carrying on in the living room.&nbsp; To me it
sounded like a big party was going on in my house.&nbsp; I felt
paralyzed with fear.&nbsp; I did not know if Jamie was hearing the same
sounds, but he too, I know, was experiencing some paranormal
activities.&nbsp; One night I caught him holding Zach in his arms,
yelling, &#8220;No one is going to take him, and no one can have him.&#8221;&nbsp;
Instantly I woke up, thinking somebody was fighting, but instead I saw
my husband and son standing in the hall screaming and crying.&nbsp; I
grabbed Zach, and Jamie ran back to bed as though somebody had scared
him.&nbsp; That scared me so much that from then on I was scared to go
to sleep, scared for my family and me.<br>
Another night of experiences that would put chills down ours spine when
Jamie experienced another activity. The night I became involved.&nbsp;
I was lying there praying while sleeping, which I try to do often. The
old devil or something got into my mind, telling me I had better be
scared.&nbsp; Well, I responded, &#8220;Jesus and God will help me, and I
will not be scared.&#8221;&nbsp; All of a sudden, Jamie yelled out and said,
&#8220;Be scared, be very scared,&#8221; and started laughing with a devilish
sound.&nbsp; I woke him up and asked him why he would say that. He did
not even remember saying a word.&nbsp; I was in shock to believe that
this really happened because I was saying all this prayer in my mind.<br>
Through the day, I would hear cries and screams from children, as if
they were being tortured, even when I was taking a shower.&nbsp; The
lights would flicker off and on constantly, along with the cries and
screams.&nbsp; I thought I was going out of my mind because I thought
these sounds were coming from me, not from the house. I tried ignoring
it each day and telling myself that I was not crazy and that there was
trouble with the wiring causing the lights to flicker.&nbsp; At night
while I was a sleep, unseen touches would grab my arm and tried to yank
me off the bed. I was so afraid I would cover myself completely up in
covers and try to go back to sleep.&nbsp; Another night a cat was fast
asleep around my neck choking me until I could not breathe.&nbsp; I
grabbed that cat and threw it into the hallway.&nbsp; I was astounded
too find a cat in my house because we did not have one for a pet.<br>
Unfortunately, my son Zach experienced some activities also.&nbsp;
Before we would go to sleep he would stand on the bed, scream, and cry
in front of this mirror, which was in my bedroom.&nbsp; He would stand
and yell, &#8220;There it is see him.&#8221;&nbsp; This occurred at least twice a
week, and it was an awful experience for him.&nbsp; He is now sixteen
years old, and he can still remember how scary that mirror was to him,
and it still scares him today, but he cannot seem to remember what was
in that mirror.<br>
We stayed in that house for four and a half years, dealing with the
haunting. I can say that now.&nbsp; We sold that house on land
contract, and the married couple that bought it lived there for only
two weeks, and during the two weeks there were a couple police cars in
front of that house and they ended splitting up. This is what I
heard.&nbsp; I cannot say for sure what actually happened, but I bet I
can say it had something to do with that house on Old Trail Road.&nbsp;
We now live in our new house, have lived here for eight years with no
haunting experiences, and are happier than ever.&nbsp; To end this, I
just want to say all the stories I have told are true, and I hope that
no one else will ever experience what we went through.<br>

My True Haunting in Vancouver<br>
<br>
By: gibsonman@comcast.net<br>
<br>
Hello, I just thought I would share a story w/ you that I have. I have
read alot of spooky stories on your site, and while mine may not be the
scariest, it is 100% true. My mother lived for 6 years in a house in
downtown Vancouver, WA The house was small, but cute and in a great
neighborhood. When she and my stepdad, along w/ my little brother moved
in, right away my mom started to experience strange things. The first
odd occurance was that at night, when my mother would put her head down
on her pillow, she would hear what sounded like static and mumbled
voices coming from below her. Having a basement in the house, she
thought at first that maybe somehow there was a radio plugged in down
there and it had been left on. So, she got up and investigated-there
was no radio. When she returned to bed and laid here head down again,
she heard the same sound again. But now knowing there was no radio
anywhere, the sounds spooked her. This kept up for about a week, and
then it stopped as suddenly as it began. Then, something new started.
As she would lie in bed trying to fall asleep at night, my mom would
hear the brass drawer handles on her dresser jiggling. She would cuddle
up next to my step dad and cover her head w/ the blankets when this
would happen. It kept up for about one week, also. One night while
dozing on the couch in the living room, she heard a faint knock on the
far window in the room. She got up and listened only to hear it again.
She looked out the window, but could see nothing. All of a sudden, she
heard it again, and at the same moment, my brother who was about 11 at
the time, came out of his room and said he had heard knocking on his
window. I have to add that since there was a basement, the main floor
windows are up about three feet higher than windows in a house w/ no
basement, so for someone to stand on the ground outside and knock, they
either had to be using a long stick (not too likely in that
neighborhood) or be on stilts (also NOT very likely!). My mom was
scared since the knocking had happened at the same time, but in
different areas of the house. Once I was there and my mom had to run
down to the corner store so I decided to just hang out and wait for
her, since I knew she would want to see my son, whom at the time was
just a newborn. As I was sitting at the kitchen table eating a burger
from Dairy Queen and waiting for my mother to return, I heard what
sounded like a car pull up in the alley behind their house, the
backdoor open and close, feet come up the back stairs, and shoes (they
sounded like they were wet because they squeaked)&nbsp; come up the
stairs and into the kitchen, but stop halfway across the room. I
actually thought it was my mom coming home from the store, or that she
had forgotten something like her purse or something and had came back
for it. I looked out the back window after calling out to my mother and
getting no answer. There was no car there. I know I heard someone come
in and come up the back stairs and cross the kitchen half way. I know I
did. Once, before my husband ane I were married, but we lived together,
we had gotten into a squabble so I had gone over to my mom's to relax
and I decided to take a nice, warm bath in their large claw-foot
bathtub. As I lay there with my head against the back of the tub,
something caught my eye to my left and when I turned my head I swear I
saw a towel on the towelbar moving, like just waving in the wind. The
only problem was, there was no wind. It was a bathroom, after all. I
thought maybe it was the heater, but when I got out and checked, the
heater vent was all the way closed, and not even in the ame vicinity as
the towel bar.Also, it had been spring time, so I doubt the heat was
even on. Once when my mother was getting dressed, she had on everything
but her shirt and as she walked past the basement steps, she heard a
male voice (no one else was home at the time) distictly say, "Nice!" In
the same kind of voice guys use when complimenting a woman on their
looks or something. Needless to say, my mom was spooked. Another time,
my mom had gotten up early to make coffee for my step father before he
left for work and as she sat in the coffee/smoking room of their house
(it's actually a back sun porch, but they would smoke out there) she
saw the sillouette of what (who?) she thought was my stepdad, going
past the sunporch door, towards the kitchen. She thought little of it,
since she knew he would be joining her out on the porch soon. Well,
after about two or three minutes, she began to wonder what was taking
him so long to get his coffee-she got up to check and there was no one
in the kitchen! Doug (my stepdad) was still sound asleep! Weird, huh?
They moved out of there in spring of 2004 and moved back into the other
house they own, but had been renting out. I don't know who bought their
old house down on Columbia Street, but I often wonder if they, too,
have had any odd phenomenon happen. Also, my mom just told me a few
weeks ago (why she waited to tell me, I have no clue) but the old
neighbor they had to the right of them when they lived down on Columbia
had once told them an owner in the past had come in from outside one
day and had had a heart attack in the kitchen and died there. The
neighbor who informed them of this had no knowledge as to the strange
happenings my mom had encountered, they had just been talking and the
previous tenant's heart attack had come up. I think that was strange,
considering I heard shoes cross the kitchen floor only half way that
one time...could that have been where the previous owner had his heart
attack? I wonder. Thanks for the opportunity to share my encounter!<br>

My Old Hag Experiences<br>
<br>
<br>
By: elshbee@blueyonder.co.uk<br>
<br>
I have been reading your piece about sleep paralysis and thought you might be interested to hear my experiences.<br>
I am a 39 year old married woman living in the north of England and I
have had a few frightening episodes , they have only seemed to happen
over the last couple of years or so except for a few during my teenage
years.<br>
My first episodes happened whilst sharing a bed with my husband who was
asleep and totally oblivious to me being woken up by the bed rocking
gently but enough to wake me up. I was lying on my right hand side and
facing a wall. As I woke up the bed was still being rocked, it felt
like someone was at the foot of the bed pushing and pulling the iron
bedstead but I couldn&#8217;t move although my eyes were open .I felt angry
and scared at the same time, I wanted to tell them to stop it but
couldn&#8217;t speak. Suddenly and abruptly the bed was still and I was wide
awake.<br>
I have recently had two more weird happenings in the spare room where I
now sleep due to my husband snoring which is unbearable! Again I was
lying on my left hand side ,and was woken up by a strange vibration
against my back but it didn&#8217;t feel like anything I&#8217;ve ever felt before,
it felt like something or someone behind me was doing it to me, yet I
was paralysed and my eyes were open. It definitely wasn&#8217;t a twitching
nerve .<br>
Another time I was woken up by my legs being moved across the bed and I
could feel and hear the duvet moving against my legs and feet, I was on
my back this time. I went back to sleep and woke up with my legs in the
same place they had been moved to.<br>
Finally last week I was woken up by a feeling of someone lifting the
cover from behind me , it felt like someone was trying to push me over
by lifting me onto my left hand side, I felt the draft of cold air of
the duvet lifting and dropping and then I opened my eyes and I was on
my back. I could feel and hear something or someone running their hand
repeatedly back and forth in a menacing fashion across my chest area
i.e the top end of the duvet .The duvet is silk and I could feel and
hear a slight snagging and the pressure of a hand. I told my self not
to be scared and realised that it was just another one of these old hag
experiences and promptly went back to sleep.<br>
I am now expecting it to happen again and go to sleep facing the room
with my back against the wall so that I can at least see around me as I
fall asleep, not that this would prevent it happening but it is the
only way that I dare face now.<br>
I hope this is interesting to you and I&#8217;ll keep an eye on your website,
it&#8216;s comforting to know that I am not alone with these strange and
scary happenings.<br>

My Mother-In-Law<br>
<br>
<br>
By: dixiebandit2001@hotmail.com <br>
<br>
My mother-in-law and I were very close. In Feburary 2005 my husband and
I moved her from St. John's, Arizona to be near us in Roswell, NM. In
December 2004 she purchased a house here and my husband and I restored
it for her. We loved having her live so close and we saw her every day.
Unfortunately our time together was very limited as she passed away at
home in June of 2005. She only lived in her "new" house for 4 months.
Although she had seven children, the house and all her posessions were
given to my husband and I in her will. The other six children got
momentos and an equal share of her actual money. After she passed away,
we moved into the house since it was in better condition than the
mobile home we were living in. I am always up at or before 6:00 a.m.,
but one morning I overslept. At 6:15 I was woke up when I heard my
precious mother-in-law call my name. That was all she said was my name,
but the way she said it was as if she were questioning if I was going
to get up. Another time my husband was sitting in the livingroom with
the front door open and he say her standing on the front porch looking
at the flowers we had planted for her. Her ashes are buried under her
favorite flower (a Queen Victoria Rose) at the corner of the house by
the flower garden. These are the only two times she has contacted us
for which I am thankful. I believe she crossed over to be with Jesus
and was privilaged to say her "good-bye's" in her way. While she was so
sick and bed-ridden with cancer, I stayed here at the house with her.
During the four days before she died, I heard some amazing things. I
set up a baby monitor in her room and carried the receiver with me
around the house and outside so I could hear if she needed me. On two
different occasions during the night, I would here her talking in her
sleep. That was not unusual, but what was unusual was that over the
monitor I could also here two other voices. I could not understand what
the two voices were saying although mom's words were quite clear. I
would go to her room and still hear her talking but not the other
voices. I only heard them on the monitor. Although it has been almost
15 months since she has been gone, I still miss her very much. When the
missing is great, I feel the warmth of her love cover me and I know
everything is alright and that when Jesus calls me home she will be
there waiting for me with open arms.<br>

Home Experiences<br>
<br>
By: fergfamily@tds.net<br>
<br>
We had some ghostly happenings start up shortly after my sons' friend
died in a car crash, in 2000. None before that, other than our oldest
son reporting a black shape in his room that made him nervous. After
this boy's death (our two boys were very close to him), we bought a
foosball table for them. One night, as my husband was working, our sons
were playing it, I was sitting with my back to the front door, watching
TV. I had the inside door open (it was summer). I heard our door open
and close. I looked around to see who it was, and no one was there. I
asked the boys who was at the door, and they didn't see anyone, either,
although they, too, had heard the door open and close. We had many
instances like that, and other things like orbs in pictures, sounds,
and cold spots. <br>
After my father-in-law died in 2002, more instances. My husband wasn't
a believer, but he finally had to admit something was going on. He
worked 3rd shift, so he was home alone during the day, while I worked
and the boys were in school. He often fell asleep on the couch. It took
him a few weeks after these happened, but he finally told me about some
things. One day, he was sleeping on the couch, and was slapped by
someone. He could even hear it. Another day, he heard a knock on our
door. He got up to see who it was, and there was no one there. This was
in winter, fresh snow falling. He looked out our front door and our
back door. He went outside to look for footprints around the house.
There weren't any but his own.<br>
Our oldest son's former girlfriend is supposedly a "medium" type. The
first time she came over to meet us, she asked my son who the two guys
were in the back yard, by my husband's dog kennels. There was only my
husband, so our son said his Dad. She kept saying who is the other man?
Our oldest insisted there was only his Dad out there, and she insisted
right back there was a second man there. She finally described him, and
our son recognized that it was his grandfather at an earlier age, as in
one of the pictures shown at his funeral. She wasn't his girlfriend at
the time of his grandpa's death. Grandpa has been around many times
since, a lot out by the dogs area, and the dogs sometimes stop and look
intently at something we can't see. They also howl&nbsp; at something
every time my husband leaves them.<br>
As my mother lay dying next door to us (we moved out here in 1999, she
died in 2005), there was tons of stuff happening. She had cancer, and
in April of 2005, it was finally diagnosed terminal, although we had no
idea how long she had. It turned out to be a short time (she died July
18), but she made the most of it. She took a really downward turn on
June 18th, we called the priest in for last rites. We also called all
of our family, her sisters and brothers, in-laws, and friends. We
thought that was it. She recovered, and later that day, as she sat
holding her two older sisters' hands, she made the comment, "I'm glad I
came back." One aunt, myself, and my sisters and brother spent the next
month out in the front yard, every evening, with a campfire and
cappuccinos (and other things to drink!), close enough to help when Dad
needed it, but out of the house so they could spend their last evenings
together. We only came in when it was time to go to bed, after 2:00
a.m. There's a reason for that time, but this is getting too long as it
is. So much happened while Mom lay there that I'll have to write about
it another time. We heard doors open and close, my Mom saw people we
couldn't see (no, she wasn't drugged up), we heard birds at odd times
of the night, my aunt saw her Mom (my Grandma) in an upstairs window,
and the oldest son's GF saw a lot of visitors we couldn't. <br>
Hope you enjoy this little tidbit from central Indiana. By the way, we
live in the country, on about two acres, my parent's house is about 150
yards from ours. The land we bought is on an old Indian reservation,
the Miamis. There is a boundary marker for the southern line about one
mile south, one mile east of our house. The eastern boundary is
somewhere around 5 miles from our house. For the record, at no time
have I ever been afraid of any of these occurrences. <br>
As I said, there is more, but it's late. Please let me know if you have any questions. Just in case:<br>

Have We Disturbed "Fred"?<br>
<br>
By: wendy.taylor@fdl-law.co.uk<br>
<br>
<br>
This is an account of the happenings in my boyfriend&#8217;s mother&#8217;s house in Rhyl, North Wales, a 1930&#8217;s three bedroom semi.<br>
When the house was first purchased in 1972 it remained empty for some
time as a lot of work was required to be done to it before it was
habitable, especially for a two year old as my boyfriend was then.<br>
Work was carried out on weekends and in the evenings by my boyfriend&#8217;s
mother.&nbsp; Whilst this was being carried out, she was aware of a
male presence on the stairs and landing area.&nbsp; She is not the sort
for any nonsense and used to shout out &#8220;Oh go away, Fred, I don&#8217;t have
time for you&#8221;.<br>
Whilst the house was coming along but was still unoccupied, my
boyfriend&#8217;s uncle was courting at the time and he and his girlfriend
used to go over there to spend some time alone&nbsp; On one occasion
they both heard what sounded like footsteps and furniture being moved
around directly above them.&nbsp; They were so startled by what they
heard and, knowing that no-one else was in the house and there was no
furniture upstairs, they fled and never went back on their own.<br>
Fast forward to 2006.&nbsp; My boyfriend&#8217;s mother has been suffering
from poor health for some time and has had to come and live with us in
Manchester because she can no longer live on her own.&nbsp; In light of
this, her house is being put up for sale but, beforehand, all her
belongings are having to be cleared out and the house done up in the
hope of attracting a quick sale.&nbsp; As my boyfriend is an only
child, this task has been left to him, with myself helping out where
possible.&nbsp; Because of the distance between the two houses
(Manchester and North Wales) visits are limited and, on occasion, my
boyfriend has stayed the night to try and get as much done as possible.<br>
This is where &#8220;Fred&#8221; comes into it again.&nbsp; The first time my
boyfriend spent the night, he felt the presence of &#8220;Fred&#8221; so strongly
that he ended up sleeping in his car because he felt so uncomfortable
in the house.&nbsp; I would add that he is not someone of a nervous
disposition and I know he had a very uncomfortable night in the
car.&nbsp; He also told me that he was very nervous of getting up in
the night to use the toilet because of who or what might be waiting for
him on the stairs/landing.&nbsp; After this occasion, he told me he was
never going to spend the night there again on his own.<br>
The second time he was going to spend the night, he took one of our
German Shepherds with him for company and, for this reason alone, slept
in one of the bedrooms (with our dog lying next to him).&nbsp; On this
occasion, neither he nor our dog picked up anything.<br>
My boyfriend is fitting a new kitchen and, due to lack of time, is
going down on a week night after work to try and get a few hours in so
the house will be completed as soon as possible.&nbsp; <br>
The following happened last Wednesday (30th August 2006).&nbsp; He had
finished what he was doing and went upstairs to one of the bedrooms to
get changed.&nbsp; There is a pendant light fitting on the ceiling with
no shade.&nbsp; There used to be a strip light but this has been
removed and a pendant put in its place.&nbsp; Each time he turned
around to get changed the light kept flickering as if someone was
cutting off the power but then putting it back on quickly so, instead
of going on and off, it was flickering.&nbsp; Each time he turned
around and looked at the light it stopped flickering but when he went
back to getting changed it happened again.&nbsp; This happened several
times.&nbsp; He also told me that, whilst he was working in the
kitchen, he kept hearing what sounded like small objects being dropped
on the floor.&nbsp; There is no carpet upstairs as this is going to be
replaced once the rooms are painted so it is bare floorboards and the
sound was very distinctive.&nbsp; I asked if he had the boiler on and
it was possibly the pipes and floorboards creaking but he said the
boiler was not on and it was not that kind of noise in any event.<br>
On his way out of the house, he set the alarm and, as he was locking
up, it went off.&nbsp; He went back inside to re-set it and stood there
and it did not go off.&nbsp; As soon as he went to leave it went off
again.&nbsp; He again re-set it and waited to see if something was
triggering the motion sensor.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; Then, once again, as
soon as he went to leave, it went off.&nbsp; By this time he was
getting annoyed as it was late and the drive home takes 90 minutes so
he stepped into the hallway and said out loud &#8220;OK, I know you are there
but I don&#8217;t have time for your silly games so can you please
stop&#8221;.&nbsp; At this, he re-set the alarm, locked the door and went
down the path.&nbsp; The alarm didn&#8217;t go off.<br>
My boyfriend thinks that &#8220;Fred&#8221; has been disturbed by the house being cleared out.<br>
When they first moved into the house in the 1970&#8217;s he recalled feeling
a presence and seeing a shadowy figure on the landing at night when he
was in bed.&nbsp; This happened for about a decade and then, all of a
sudden, it stopped.&nbsp; His grandmother, who was very superstitious,
did not like the house and tried to talk her daughter out of buying
it.&nbsp; She also always used to enter and leave by the same door to
avoid taking whatever was in the house with her (not something I have
ever heard of).<br>
Also, back in the 1970&#8217;s, one of his mother&#8217;s friends once said that he felt someone push him down the stairs.<br>
The house is hopefully being put on the market within the next month or
so and, if anything further happens, I will of course keep you
posted.&nbsp; <br>

Haunted Newburyport<br>
<br>
<br>
By: speedsterjay@verizon.net<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
My friend and I set out to catch anything supernatural in the
Newburyport - Old Hill Cemetery. On a clear but windy night we setup a
tape recorder , at about 12am, on the top of the hill and as close to
the center of the cemetery. Once we pushed the play and record button
we said, nice and laud, that we were walking away and that we&#8217;d be
clear and talking clear when we came back. Staying close enough to make
sure anything that the recorder would pick up we could hear, we waited
about 2 hours, the length of the tape. Walking around the outskirts of
the cemetery for two hours saw few car driveby and some people come
home that live across the street. We went back up to the top of the
hill to find the record button and play button still pushed in (they
pop out when the tape is done) and though the batteries must have died.
Once getting back to his house we went right upstairs to listen to what
ever, if anything, we found. <br>
Not thinking about the batteries we hit play and it worked fine. The
sound was clear and pretty crisp. The beginning was us talking about
what we were doing and that we could be back. We listened for about
20-30 minutes and the wind was clear and the &#8220;normal&#8221; night sounds were
clear.&nbsp; Then all of a sudden we heard an odd slam, some quick
noises, another slam, the noises again, and then nothing, no wind or
the bugs or anything. Dead air, no pun intended. So we rewound it and
listened a few times, about 25, there seemed to be words but to high
pitched to really hear. (Mind you this is when we realized that we
never changed the batteries and that obviously wasn&#8217;t why it stopped.)
So I had a bright idea and played the tape in slow motion, that&#8217;s when
we freaked out.<br>
I know it was in slow motion because of the wind, so we listened to the
slam, like rocks falling on rock, then the noise &#8220;HELP&#8221; my friend
dropped the recorder and turned all the lights on. We picked it up
again and hit play again in slow motion, then a Help or Ouch in a
woman&#8217;s voice, &#8220;is he caught?&#8221;. Then a moan in a mans voice. Then
another slam, then slam, the last part was harder to hear but it sounds
like &#8220;can you help&#8221;. Needless to say we were pretty freaked out. We
went back the next night and got nothing. Other adventures there have
led to nothing more than orbs (dust in the flash?) and a few shadows
and feeling.<br>

I've had lots of psychic and ghostly experiences over the years.&nbsp;
One of my favorites involves a hotel on the west coast of
Florida.&nbsp; We were visiting in the Cedar Key area and I went for a
walk on a quiet Sunday morning.&nbsp; As I passed one of the older
hotels I looked over to see a man and woman sitting on the front
porch.&nbsp; They were in "costume" - the woman wore a lovely lavender
dress and had a large matching lavender hat.&nbsp; She was sipping
something from a delicate looking cup and looked over at me and
smiled.&nbsp; The man just sat beside her, also looking at me.&nbsp; He
had no expression on his face at all.&nbsp; He was wearing a black suit
and round wire rims.&nbsp; He was definitely NOT smiling and kind of
gave me a chill.&nbsp; I was deep in thought and absent mindedly waved
and smiled and kept going.&nbsp; I thought when I came back from my
walk I would go back on that side of the street and say Hello.&nbsp; It
intrigued me that there might be some sort of turn of the century
re-enactment or something going on.<br>
Well, when I returned, there was no one there.&nbsp; In fact the porch
didn't even extend down to the street.&nbsp; There were no tables at
that part of the porch at all and there was no activity at the
hotel.&nbsp; I walked inside and figured I would have a cup of tea or
coffee but the kitchen wasn't open.&nbsp; There was no one at the desk
to ask so I just went back to our hotel.&nbsp; I was immersed in some
family problems and didn't give this too much thought although I never
forgot about it.&nbsp; Several years went by and a friend and I were
discussing our many other worldly experiences and I mentioned the Cedar
Key area.&nbsp; My friend said that particular hotel has quite a
history of hauntings.&nbsp; After that I spent some time on the
internet looking up ghostly activities at that hotel.&nbsp; Sure
enough, there was mention of both the man and woman.&nbsp; They have
been seen by many.&nbsp; <br>
The reason this is one of my favorites is because I saw those "people"
around 1992 or 3.&nbsp; I never read anything about that hotel and the
internet wasn't around yet.&nbsp; I'm sure you other "old timers" can
remember when there was no internet to reference and no TV shows about
ghosts and such..There was no way I could have seen or heard anything
about it.&nbsp; Yet I saw what I found out later many have seen.&nbsp;
It definitely lends credence to the tale.&nbsp; I've since gone back
twice and had experiences both times.&nbsp; I hesitate to mention the
name of the hotel because I believe the current owners may not
appreciate ghost hunters.&nbsp; <br>

Haunted Hotel<br>
<br>
<br>
By: concepts-unlimited@msn.com<br>
<br>
My little sister 13 came from a slumber party at the albuquerque
Raddison which has been renamed as park plaza inn over the past
weekend.&nbsp; <br>
Her friends accompanied her as they walked around the hotel at around three a.m. <br>
they all experienced a frightful experience.&nbsp; As soon as they got
off of the elevator onto the the third floor. they reported feeling
like they were walking on air.<br>
2 of the girls saw a woman dressed in white suspended slightly above
the ground and her wrist had broken off of her arm.&nbsp; as they
immediately turned around to exit, they got back into the
elevator,&nbsp; they saw a woman kill a man, and then herself with a
hand gun. and the blood was splattered all over the elevator, she said
that they were all screaming, they exited the elevator, and the
security guard had come to their rescue, and told them that no one goes
on the third floor. When the security guard looked in the elevator he
saw two old blood stains on the elevator walls, which have left a
remnant of a stain there. <br>
My sister called me to pick her up from the hotel around 4:00 am.&nbsp;
She was very scared, and insistent that she was not lying.&nbsp; I have
been searching the internet to find anything that supports her
story.&nbsp; This is the only thing I have found so far.<br>
She has never told me anything like this, and she told me to go look for myself.<br>

Ghost Story<br>
<br>
<br>
By: dutchskie@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Hi I stumbled on to your website and found it interesting.&nbsp; Anyhow
I have a story to tell you guys.&nbsp; I had been living with my uncle
since I was 16-17 yrs. old and when I turned 27 I finally moved out on
my own into a house with my then 5 yr. old son, I'm a single parent
father.&nbsp; I dont know the history of the house I moved into but I
decided to spend the night in the house the first night alone just to
get a feel for the house and get ideas where I wanted to put stuff like
furniture, etc.&nbsp; My son stayed with his grandmother.&nbsp; Well in
the middle of the night on the first night, I remember being in a
dream-like state and felt uncomfortable, like I wasn't welcome
there.&nbsp; I remember my eyes being open and looked like I was being
carried out towards the front door but on my way to the front door I
started struggling and and being the big brutish guy I am I was able to
struggle myself up and found myself in a cold very cold room in the
middle of the night.&nbsp; At first my feeling was a lil bit of fear
but then my instinct kicked in and wasn't one to be bullied and I must
have gave whatever it was that notion to not mess with me cause shortly
there after the room wasnt cold anymore.&nbsp; I eventually called my
local deacon from my church to come and bless my house and when he came
inside there was this eerie feeling that he must have had also because
I noticed on his arms he had goosebumps like I did.&nbsp; After
blessing the house my son has said that he now has an "invisible
friend".&nbsp; I asked him what is his friends name and what does he
look like and he said, "his name is tommy and hes a little boy like
me".&nbsp; Heh, well, I wasn't surprised cause I've noticed that when
we get home somtimes my sons toys are out after I made my son put his
toys away before we leave anywhere, and I do hear things in the middle
of the night in the house but dont get that cold unwanted feeling
anymore, an occasional cold one but not often...<br>
