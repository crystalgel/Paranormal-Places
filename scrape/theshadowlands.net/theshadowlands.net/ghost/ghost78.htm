<P><B>By: wyrdrune@feist.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Victorville, CA. George AFB is deactivated now but back when I was</B>
<P><B>assigned there in the 70's, I lived next door to a haunted house in
base</B>
<P><B>housing. My wife and I lived in what were known as Wherry housing
units.</B>
<P><B>These were small concrete block duplexes (2 Bedroom)that had swamp
coolers</B>
<P><B>for cooling in summer and natural gas wall heaters for the winter.
We moved</B>
<P><B>into our unit and found it agreeable for just the two of us. While
talking</B>
<P><B>to the neioghbors we found out that our unit and the next 3 units had
to</B>
<P><B>have the heaters replaced. The unit next to ours had malfunctioned
and the</B>
<P><B>woman living there was aphyxiated. The next family to move in had a
small</B>
<P><B>boy and he would wake up screaming every night. His mother asked him
what</B>
<P><B>was wrong and finally he told her the "white lady" kept coming into
his</B>
<P><B>room and saying "I'm going to take you home with me." My wife had told
her</B>
<P><B>that I have had experiences with that kind of thing and "volunteered"
me to</B>
<P><B>go have a look. Naturally I waited until it was full noon (Momma didn't
raise</B>
<P><B> no fools) before I went in to check out the house. Now at this time
we had a stupid cat </B>
<P><B>(what other kind is there)that would follow me around. So, in we go,
kitchen-ok, dining</B>
<P><B>room-ok, living room-ok, master bedroom-ok, bathroom-ok. Kid's room,
oh-oh,</B>
<P><B>no feeling cold or anything, but my eyes are drawn to the far corner
of the</B>
<P><B>room. I can't see anything there but I "know" something is there. I
glance</B>
<P><B>down at the cat and it's looking in the same spot. Glance up, "it"
has</B>
<P><B>moved closer to me, glance down, cat is fluffing up and backing down
the</B>
<P><B>hallway. I figure the cat has the right idea. Now, here is where I
made a</B>
<P><B>stupid mistake, I got in front of the cat. I hear the cat make a loud
hiss</B>
<P><B>and the next thing that happens is the cat went up my back and off
the top</B>
<P><B>of my head running. I don't stop to look behind me (remember what
Satchel</B>
<P><B>Page said about that?)and take off running. My wife said she heard
the cat</B>
<P><B>make a noise then me saying "OH %&amp;*!" than a herd of elephants
running out the door.</B>
<P><B> Needless to say I recommended our neighbor have the chaplain come
out. A second episode</B>
<P><B>after that really had the hair stand up (still does to this day). I
was</B>
<P><B>coming home around 2AM and noticed the master bedroom window was open
and a</B>
<P><B>light was on. I glanced over and there was the gal next door brushing
her</B>
<P><B>blonde hair and not wearing a stitch. Well, good neighbor that I am,
I call</B>
<P><B>out to tell her to close the blind at least. First word out of my
mouth,</B>
<P><B>lights off, blind closed, window shut. I don't to this day know how
I got</B>
<P><B>through the front patio gate or the front door. I woke up my wife and
told</B>
<P><B>her what I had seen. She said 1) Our neighbor's hair is brown, 2)They
were</B>
<P><B>in San Francisco. 3) The woman who died in that house was a blonde.</B>

<P>
<P><B>I went to Blackburn College in Carlinville, IL.  Before I moved into
my</B>
<P><B>dorm room, people asked which dorm I was assigned.  When I told them</B>
<P><B>Stoddard, everyone told me to watch out for the ghost in I believe
it was</B>
<P><B>room 305.  Blackburn is a very old school and Stoddard was one of the</B>
<P><B>oldest dorms dating to the 1800's.  The supposed haunted room  was
the only</B>
<P><B>single room, the rest were doubles.  It was on the 3rd floor as the
3rd</B>
<P><B>floor was all guys and the first two all girls.  the story goes, a
freshmen</B>
<P><B>hung himself in that room years ago, or another one was that a
boyfriend</B>
<P><B>killed his girlfriend and then himself there.  Anyways, you were
supposed</B>
<P><B>to be able to hear him walking around at night and see him in windows
and</B>
<P><B>such.  My room was diagnal from this room.  My only encounters there
were</B>
<P><B>sometimes in the middle of the night if I walked down the hall to the</B>
<P><B>bathroom, I could swear someone was outside the stall walking around,
but</B>
<P><B>there would be nothing there.  Also, I would leave stuff in my room,
and </B>
<P><B>when I came back, it would be gone and then</B>
<P><B>later return to the same spot.  I transferred schools the next semester
for</B>
<P><B>personal reasons, but the weird thing is the guy who lived next door
to me</B>
<P><B>there always said how he would see the ghost, and then I got word that
he</B>
<P><B>tried hanging himself last semester!  If you have any questions please
feel</B>
<P><B>free to contact me.</B>

<P><B>Many Haunted Places</B>
<P>
<P><B>Kelley40@excite.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Mountain View- There are a number of places that are suspected to be
haunted in the area.  The </B>
<P><B>first would be on Highway 17N going toward Jacks Fork river from Mountain
View.  A Large, </B>
<P><B>(almost vicorian styled,) house was being built there in the early
1990's.. just before the </B>
<P><B>building was complete and the doors had not yet all been hung, my husband
and I went in to look </B>
<P><B>around on our way home from swimming at the river.  It had been said
many times that the land </B>
<P><B>there was haunted all around by LongPast Native-American warriors...
possibly Cherokee...  As we </B>
<P><B>went first to the upper level of the huge house, we heard sounds that
we attributed to settling </B>
<P><B>of the new construction.  When we would go from room to room the sounds
would move to another </B>
<P><B>room.  It was a very hopt summer day, but one room in particular was
rather cool in a spot about </B>
<P><B>3 feet in diamiter. We went to the ground level of the house and heard
nothing out of the </B>
<P><B>ordinary.  We then descended down to the basement which was mostly
finished and nothing </B>
<P><B>remarkable was about the huge room.  We stood still and quiet in the
center of the basement and </B>
<P><B>I began to feel very sick at my stomach.  I felt a sudden, huge urge
to cry and became so afraid</B>
<P><B> that it made me shake uncontrolably.  My husband could only watch.
 I said to him what was </B>
<P><B>happening, he suddenly became very cold and shivered and I could see
his breath.  I knew they </B>
<P><B>were angry and didn't want us there.... we ran as fast as we could
out of the building and into </B>
<P><B>our pick up.  Immediately upon leaving the structure, the fear, nausea
and shaking and coldness</B>
<P><B> left us both.  We could only laugh for a long time.  The structure
bacame a Bed a Breakfast, or</B>
<P><B> an INN for a few years but it didn't make it as a business.  There
are people residing there </B>
<P><B>now.  My husband went there while it was an Inn for a 4th of July
Celebration the last summer it</B>
<P><B> was in business and he noticed no activity other than living human
activity....  </B>
<P><B>Secondly, there is a site that a big three story house stands where
I think that house is about </B>
<P><B>75 to 100 years old.  it consists of first floor, second floor and
an attic space area, I don't </B>
<P><B>know if there is a basement there as i have not been in the house.
 It is located about 4-5 miles</B>
<P><B> out on "Y" highway, heading Northwest, toward  Jacks Fork River. 
I don't know when the even of</B>
<P><B> death was but a child, very young.4-6 years old from what the stories
are was wandering and </B>
<P><B>playing about the big yard.  Her mother was hanging laundry on the
clothes line.  The child fell</B>
<P><B> into an old well and suffered a great deal before her death.  They
say that the child can be </B>
<P><B>heard running through the house and lughing, but also that she can
be heard screaming and sobbing</B>
<P><B> out near the well.  There was a new baby in the house in a cradle
at the time of the girl's </B>
<P><B>death and if someone lives there with a cradle or rocking chair it
either will rock on their own</B>
<P><B> and you can hear the little girl singing a lullaby to the baby.  Many
people have moved in and </B>
<P><B>moved out of the old place.  I don't know who owns it now but it appeared
that there had been </B>
<P><B>some restorations done and it looks real nice.  I don't know if people
are moving in and out as </B>
<P><B>fast as they used to but the story of the haunting still lives.</B>
<P><B>Third- On the street east of Elm on Second Street there lives an old
house.  Several owners and </B>
<P><B>renters have resided in this house that was built sometime, (I think)
around 1940.  I never </B>
<P><B>investigated the age of the house.  About 15 years ago I moved in there
with my two small </B>
<P><B>children and we all slept in the same room.  My mother was renting
it with her husband and her </B>
<P><B>sister and my youngest sister.  It is a big house with two stories
and a full basement.  While </B>
<P><B>my 6 moths time living there before I found my own place to live I
encountered several not </B>
<P><B>unpleasant encounters with 'someone'.  It always appeard to be a boy
about ten years old, dark </B>
<P><B>hair , not too thin but not heavy either.  The first encounter i could
only feel someone watching</B>
<P><B> me.  the washer and dryer were in the basement and my aunt had a huge
work table in the center </B>
<P><B>of the basement that she did her crafts on.  I often used a protion
at the end of the table to </B>
<P><B>fold and sort laundry on.  It was August of 1984,  my son was not yet
a year old.  My daughter </B>
<P><B>was 4 years old.  I was folding laundry in the basement and my son
was napping and my daughter </B>
<P><B>was out with my mother and her husband.  My aunt was at work.  I felt
someone looking down at me </B>
<P><B>from the stairs.  I looked but didn't see anyone.  I shrugged it off.
 I went back to my folding</B>
<P><B> and then heard foot steps on the stairs.. I looked and still saw no
one.  I could smell cinnamon</B>
<P><B> for a second and then orange... then a cool touch on my right arm
that started near my shoulder</B>
<P><B> and travelled down to my wrist.  It was like it was petting me.  I
wasn't afraid of it, i </B>
<P><B>thought it was sweet.  I had to smile about it but it was gone very
quickly.  Then I would feel</B>
<P><B> the presence off and on very often if I were cooking or cleaning the
house.  It seemed to be </B>
<P><B>attracted to me.  No one in the house was terribly aware of it, but
my daughter was very afraid </B>
<P><B>of our bedroom closet  she told me every night that she couldn't sleep
in that room unless I was</B>
<P><B> in her bed with her. She was very afraid to go into the bedroom alone.
 I moved my sons crib out</B>
<P><B> in to the alcove near a window so he could have fresh cool air as
he slept.  the old house was </B>
<P><B>very hot in the summer.  My daughter and I had a fan that blew on us
all night but my son was </B>
<P><B>just not cooled off enough to rest well there.  The alcove was just
out side the bedroom door.  </B>
<P><B>anyway, my daughter stayed afraid of the bedroom and the closet through
the whole six months we </B>
<P><B>lived there.  My son became very ill with pneumonia later on and recovered
well as long as we </B>
<P><B>weren't in that house.  If we went to the house he would again become
very sick.  I never put </B>
<P><B>the ghost and the kids difficulties together but now I see how they
were very much a part of </B>
<P><B>each other.  I have more incidents to tell of this little ghost but
have to go for now.  Email </B>
<P><B>me if you want more details.</B>

<P><B>Ghostly Wanderings</B>
<P>
<P><B>coolfang@aol.com</B>
<P><B>Groveport, Ohio</B>
<P><B>In 1992 I was a full-time student at Columbus State Community College,
earning an associate's </B>
<P><B>degree in Law Enforcement.  I had to earn a full-time salary as well
so I took a job as a </B>
<P><B>security officer during third shift at an American Electric Power lab
in Groveport.  It was a </B>
<P><B>facility set out in a rural area and, with the understanding that I
would be the only one in the</B>
<P><B>building during the graveyard shift, figured it would give me time
to study.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I will try to make this as short as possible.My first few weeks there
were rather strange, as I</B>
<P><B> kept seeing the shadowy figure of man, walking very fast, out of the
corner of my eye.  I really</B>
<P><B> did not consider it a "haunting" or ghost because I never saw the
apparition head on, so I just</B>
<P><B> went along my business and really did not give it much thought.  However,
I became very uneasy</B>
<P><B> and spooked during the midnight and early morning hours.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One morning, at about 6:00 am, I happend to be looking in the direction
of some window blinds </B>
<P><B>while I was sitting in the lobby area (the window seperated the lobby
and a work area).  Just </B>
<P><B>then I saw the DEFINITE figure of a man walk by the blinds.  I got
up and, thinking it was an </B>
<P><B>employee who had gotten in early, went to investigate the area.  There
was no one there at all.</B>
<P><B>The cleaning crew then related a story in which they were seeing a
ghost in the building.  They </B>
<P><B>described the same type of apparition to me.  I had never told them
about my experience.  </B>
<P><B>While training new officers, I had some who would stop in their tracks
while I was showing them</B>
<P><B>the building.  I would ask them what was wrong and they would be looking
toward a room or hallway</B>
<P><B>and tell me something like, " I thought I saw someone walk by".  This
happend more than once.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I spoke with a guy who used to manage the security division and he
told me he had an officer </B>
<P><B>leave in the middle of the night because he saw the shadowy figure
of a man walking very quickly</B>
<P><B>around the perimeter of the security fence.  There was about two feet
of snow on the ground, </B>
<P><B>but, after investigating the grounds, there were no footprints in the
snow.         </B>
<P>
<P><B>I told an employee at the building, whom I had gotten to know over
the time I worked there, about</B>
<P><B> the sightings.  Almost immediately he said, "Oh, that must be Roger".
 He was very serious.  He</B>
<P><B> said that Roger died about eight years prior but that he loved his
job and that it was probably</B>
<P><B> him.  Indeed, there was a former employee named "Roger" that died
eight years ago.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Without going on and on, I will just say that many other security officers
had reported the same</B>
<P><B>types of activity.  I quit the job back in June of 1993  (I worked
there almost two years) . </B>
<P><B>I would like to contact some officers working there now and see if
the haunting is still going</B>
<P><B>on.   </B>

<P><B>Haunted Guthrie</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: e.m.ritter@worldnet.att.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Although I have lived in Guthrie, Oklahoma only a few years; 14 to
be exact;  my family has been</B>
<P><B> in the area for generations. Besides the Governors Mansion for the
Territory, the Territorial </B>
<P><B>Museum and Carnegie Library Museum are also haunted.  The library book
room has an unknown force</B>
<P><B> feeling about it, and even when well lit seems to be extremely dark.
 The Boiler Room for the </B>
<P><B>building is haunted by the spirit of a janator who, apparently was
not too fond of people </B>
<P><B>entering "his" boiler room.  Staff and volunteers refuse to enter the
boiler room even in groups,</B>
<P><B> and tourists and daily visitors are told never to go below the walkway
for any reason.  Those </B>
<P><B>that have, even without knowing about the ghost have always been injured,
some seriously. The </B>
<P><B>Stone Lion Inn, a B&amp;B that sits between NW 10th and NW 11th Streets,
is haunted by the ghost of</B>
<P><B> a little girl who continues to play with living children in her attic
retreat.  To my knowledge,</B>
<P><B> no one knows who she is, but she is dressed in turn of the century
clothing.  Even adult guests</B>
<P><B> have seen her peeking out of the attic window, and on occasion her
laughter can be heard </B>
<P><B>throughout the house.  (Highlighted on the TV-News series "Haunted
Oklahoma" on KWTV-Channel 9,</B>
<P><B> Oklahoma City.)</B>
<P><B>And there is the Guthrie Lady, whom I have heard and seen.  She is
a wraith that no long term </B>
<P><B>resident will discuss, and she "haunts" the area around the Carl's
Junior Resturant on South </B>
<P><B>Division.  I have contacted Troy Taylor and Pamela Bayhylle about her.
 I hope there will be an </B>
<P><B>investigation on her this year.</B>
<P><B>The old State Senate Building which is part of the large Masonic Hall,
is haunted by an unknown </B>
<P><B>number of individuals who seem to spend their time in the Public Gallery
above the old Senate </B>
<P><B>meeting chamber.  The gallery is kept locked and no one except maintinance
workers ever go up </B>
<P><B>there.  I have "heard" and felt their presence, most seem amused about
the "living" walking </B>
<P><B>around the dead chambers.</B>
<P><B>I have been reading about and researching (via book research
unfortunenately) spirits, haunts, </B>
<P><B>etc. for 45 years, with no reason to stop, nor desire to do so.</B>

<P><B>Mathews Room </B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Floranne Casella</B>
<P>
<P><B>It was a cold Winter's day, the year was 1991, and I thought it was
a very typical day. Matthew,</B>
<P><B>the little boy that I care for, was taking an afternoon nap, as usual.
I was cleaning up the </B>
<P><B>kitchen. Then gathered up all Matt's dirty clothes, and put up a wash.
It was around three-thirty</B>
<P><B>in the afternoon when I heard Matt screaming. I could hear his voice
very clearly from the baby</B>
<P><B>monitor that was on the kitchen counter. I called to him, so that he
wouldn't get scared, as I </B>
<P><B>walked upstairs to his bedroom. That's when it first hit me. On the
way up the staircase, I was </B>
<P><B>chilled! I ran back down, got my sweater, then ran back upstairs to
Matt's room. Well, that's </B>
<P><B>where the coldness came from! Sure enough, as I opened the door,
that's where all the cold air </B>
<P><B>was coming from. It was freezing in the baby's room! I walked over
to his bed, pulled the railing</B>
<P><B>down, and held him in my arms. His hands, were ice cold, and he was
shaking and crying. In an </B>
<P><B>effort to calm him down, I held him in my arms, and I tried rocking
him back and forth. He </B>
<P><B>finally had quieted down, so I began to change his clothes, and
that's when I noticed my tape </B>
<P><B>recorder on his dresser. I had forgotten all about that! You see,
Matt's family was relocating </B>
<P><B>to another state soon, and I knew that I wanted something of Matt's
to remember him by. So, that</B>
<P><B>morning I brought my tape recorder with me to have a tape recording
of him. Little did I know </B>
<P><B>that's not all that was on the tape! When I got home, I never did listen
to the tape, it was </B>
<P><B>Friday, so I thought to myself that I had the whole week end to listen
to it. On Sunday, I had </B>
<P><B>some free time, so I started to listen to the tape. In the beginning
I thought, well I did it, </B>
<P><B>I finally have Matthew's voice on tape, and was happy to know that
I have something to remember </B>
<P><B>him by. As I began to listen I heard our voices, Matt's, mine, and
something that I couldn't make</B>
<P><B>out. I kept backing the tape up, because I heard something so strange,
that I couldn't even make</B>
<P><B>out what I was hearing! But it sounded so eerie that it gave me the
chills! What could this be?</B>
<P><B>Did I have a faulty tape here or what? As I kept rewinding and listening,
the more clearer it </B>
<P><B>became. It was definitely a voice saying pull the gate up. But what
kind of voice was it? It </B>
<P><B>sounded ghostly! But, how can this be? I heard nothing that particular
day. Only Matt and myself!</B>
<P><B>There was no one else there, just the two of us. </B>
<P><B>As I kept listening, I became more frightened, I heard the same voice
saying I wish you were </B>
<P><B>dead. I couldn't believe what I was hearing! I never heard of anything
like this before. I </B>
<P><B>thought to myself, your just imagining all of this. Your going crazy.
But, it was true. The </B>
<P><B>tape doesn't lie. It had to be a ghost or something else! I had no
other explanation, it just </B>
<P><B>had to be! After a few hours, I decided to let my daughter listen to
the tape. Now my daughter </B>
<P><B>is a very religious person. She has many religious friends and even
knows a couple of Catholic </B>
<P><B>Priests personally. After she heard the tape she told me that we should
contact a Priest right </B>
<P><B>away. The baby was our first concern! The next day, we called a Catholic
Priest that we both </B>
<P><B>knew very well, and made an appointment with him for the next night.
Since the priest knew about</B>
<P><B>the tape already, when we arrived there we went right into his office.
The three of us sat down,</B>
<P><B>and he listened to the tape right away. Well, it only took him one
time to listen to it. He </B>
<P><B>already knew what had happened. He looked at me, and he asked me if
the family was Catholic, </B>
<P><B>and I answered yes. Then he asked me if there was anything religious
in the home? I said no, </B>
<P><B>and then asked him why? Then he began to explain that the family had
no protection in the home. </B>
<P><B>It was at this time that I understood what he was talking about. He
was very concerned for the </B>
<P><B>baby's welfare. He said that what he heard on the tape was evil voices,
and other things, that </B>
<P><B>I didn't even hear! Certain sounds of doors slamming, and some creaking
floors! He told me to </B>
<P><B>tape Matt's room again, and if it happened again, then I should tell
the parents. But, what </B>
<P><B>should I have told them? That Matt's room was haunted, or the whole
house was haunted? </B>
<P><B>I didn't know what to do? If I told the parents the whole story, would
they think I was nuts? </B>
<P><B>So, I decided to take this to a Doctor friend of mine. He happens to
be a Psychiatrist, and also</B>
<P><B>dabbles a little into strange and unexplainable things.... Parapsychology.
When I went to see </B>
<P><B>the Doctor, I told him the whole story thus far, then he listened to
the tape. His exact words </B>
<P><B>were: This voice is not from this word, it's from another dimension,
this is not a human voice.</B>
<P><B>Well, from then until this day, from a Priest to a Doctor, this tape
has been a mystery to me.</B>
<P><B>So, I have decided to take my tape and story to any Parapsychologist
or Website that has to do</B>
<P><B>with the Paranormal, and let the experts decide for themselves. What
in the world happened in</B>
<P><B>Matthew's Room, that cold Winter's Day in 1991? I'm finally ready to

<P>
<P><B>The Captain and His Wife</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:jsnbrns@yahoo.com</B>
<P><B> WV- The Mallow Family Farm is haunted by two ghosts. One of them is
Capt. Dougherty, a </B>
<P><B>confederate civil war captain who walks the central staircase repeatedly
during the day and the </B>
<P><B>night. He evidently had a wooden leg to replace his own. An observer
can clearly hear the </B>
<P><B>difference between his "step" and the "thump" of wood as he walks.
The other ghost is his wife, </B>
<P><B>who haunts the upstairs bedroom. She is always seen wearing a purple
dress, and is often staring </B>
<P><B>out the window. The room, even in the heat of summer, is deathly cold.
And no matter how it is </B>
<P><B>blockaded, the doors leading from the room to the stairs and to the
attic cannot be closed. On </B>
<P><B>one occasion they were nailed  and wired shut. The next morning they
were open and the wire was</B>
<P><B> hanging loose from the doorknob. The "purple lady" also speaks, it
seems. Once, a young lady </B>
<P><B>was sleeping in the haunted bedroom. During the night, she awoke and
heard a woman tell her, "You</B>
<P><B> should turn over before you fall out of bed." The girl looked, and
she was hanging over the </B>
<P><B>edge of the bed. Thanking the woman, she turned over and went to sleep.
The next morning, she </B>
<P><B>thanked her aunt (the only other woman in the house), but her aunt
knew nothing about it. They </B>
<P><B>attributed it to the "purple lady". Capt. Dougherty himself has only
been seen once, though he </B>
<P><B>has been heard many times. A local schoolteacher moved into the farmhouse,
and was unpacking when</B>
<P><B> she heard movement upstairs. She followed the sounds up to the attic,
where she saw a man </B>
<P><B>sitting in a rocking chair. As she stared horrified, the man removed
his head, placed it in his </B>
<P><B>lap, and laughed as the rocking chair rocked and spun in circles. That
is the only reported </B>
<P><B>sighting of Capt. Dougherty. The teacher moved out the next day. Later,
when a family of four </B>
<P><B>moved in, they reported hearing the footsteps and the "purple lady".
They were the ones who </B>
<P><B>nailed the doors shut, and later found them open. </B>
<P><B>The two children of the family were evidently the buffers against the
spirit's malicious </B>
<P><B>activities. If any member of the family was home, the ghosts were
relatively quiet. If relatives </B>
<P><B>dropped by and no one was home, they were chased out of the house with
loud bangings and thumps.</B>
<P><B> The father of the family would never spend time in the house alone.
Many times the mother and </B>
<P><B>two boys would return home to find him out in the yard. </B>
<P><B>I know this from personal experience. That was my father.</B>

<P><B>Tampa, University of Tampa </B>
<P><B>It is said that U.T. is haunted by the ghosts of residents that had
stayed in it when it was the </B>
<P><B>tampa bay hotel and I have personally seen the paranormal events in
the university about 3 years </B>
<P><B>ago I arrived at about 5:30 in the morning to help my father in the
mail room I asked if I could</B>
<P><B> walk around the main builiding he said yes and off i went it is a
pretty straight shot from the</B>
<P><B> mail room to the museum at the other end of the main building as I
walked by the the large ball</B>
<P><B> room to the right I started to get a very uneasy feeling but I thought
it was nothing but as I </B>
<P><B>continued to the far stair case and ascended to the top floor what
hadent been remdeled the </B>
<P><B>feeling grew stronger as I walked out of the stairwell onto the top
floor I saw a man dressed in</B>
<P><B> a 3 piece suit satanding there his clothes were of an older style
and he didnt seem to belong </B>
<P><B>there I did so I called out to this strange man standing probably 300
feet away from me at first </B>
<P><B>I got no response so I called out  to him again I asked if there was
somthing I could help him</B>
<P><B> with he said nothing but turned his head as if to aknowledge me and
his were bright red almost</B>
<P><B> illuminating his face he was pale and thin but he began to walk towards
me and then his walk </B>
<P><B>turned to a jog and finally a dead sprint seeing this I turned and
ran back down the stairs to</B>
<P><B> the ground floor I then asked my father waht time the construction
crews started work on the </B>
<P><B>top floor and he said that the top floor wasnt to be remodeled for
another month it was then </B>
<P><B>after a 5 minute ordeal on the top floor that I realized that I had
seen a ghost.</B>

<P><B>MacKenzie House</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: norton1@idirect.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Mackenzie House is located at 82 Bond Street in downtown Toronto, Ontario
Canada. It was the last</B>
<P><B> home of the first mayor of Toronto, William Lyon MacKenzie. This house
was a gift to MacKenzie </B>
<P><B>from his friends in the twilight of his years in 1859. He lived there
until his death in 1861. </B>
<P><B>William Lyon MacKenzie is a well-known figure in Canadian history.
He was the leader of the Upper</B>
<P><B> Canada Rebellion of the 1830's as well as publisher of an important
newspaper of the day known </B>
<P><B>as The Colonial Advocate. The haunting of this three story brick residence
took place roughtly </B>
<P><B>between the years of 1956 and 1966. </B>
<P><B>The hauntings consisted of sighting of a woman and a man in period
dress, the latter being bald.</B>
<P><B> It is a well known fact that MacKenzie, in his day, was bald but wore
a wig, which is how he </B>
<P><B>appears in all his portraits. Much of the haunting was witnessed by
various caretakers who were </B>
<P><B>employed by the City of Toronto. These caretakers actually lived in
the house, on the third floor</B>
<P><B>. Besides the sightings of the woman and man, they were said to have
heard the parlour piano </B>
<P><B>playing, as well as hearing the old printing press, once belonging
to MacKenzie, and on display </B>
<P><B>in the basement, working away in the dead of night. One lady even reports
waking up and seeing a</B>
<P><B> lady looking over her from the head of her bed, and then promptly
striking her,leaving a very </B>
<P><B>visible bruise. The haunting received much play in the Toronto media
at the time, and at least </B>
<P><B>one well-publicized seance was held there. The results are not known,
but any reports of further</B>
<P><B> hauntings, if any, have been few and far between from this Heritage
location. Having visited </B>
<P><B>this place on more than one occasion myself, and knowing the history
of the house, I can say that</B>
<P><B> there is, real or imagined, an eerie feeling when one walks within
it's walls, and looks upon </B>
<P><B>the famous printing press which is still located there. </B>

<P><B>Edgefield Manor, Troutdale, Oregon</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: magerius@coho.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>One of many McMinnimin's pubs/inns/restaurants in restored </B>
<P><B>historic buildings. Edgefield Manor is a combination inn &amp;</B>
<P><B>pub complex on the property of what was originally a "poor</B>
<P><B>house" and later a rest home.  There are several ghosts said</B>
<P><B>to be on the property, many of which have been experienced </B>
<P><B>by both employees and guests.</B>
<P><B>My husband and I were married and began our honeymoon here,</B>
<P><B>and we ran into the ghost of the little girl who haunts the</B>
<P><B>upstairs "attic" rooms. My husband heard her call his name</B>
<P><B>twice while no one was around, the second time only 2 feet</B>
<P><B>behind him.  He said she sounded playful, like she was just</B>
<P><B>having fun, but he was terrified. Later, my husband worked </B>
<P><B>at Edgefield, were he learned from other employees that the</B>
<P><B>little girl is a very active spirit.  Also, there are at </B>
<P><B>least two other spirits as well. One of them moves furniture</B>
<P><B>and scares guests in a downstairs room.  Lastly, there have</B>
<P><B>been some odd "slips-in-time" occurances in the huge  </B>
<P><B>basement of the mansion.  Again, my husband experienced this</B>
<P><B>personally once.  Sometimes, employees sent into the celler</B>
<P><B>to find wine or ale stored there will be lost and find that</B>
<P><B>the celler no longer looks familiar, but instead is dirty,</B>
<P><B>cobwebbed and confusing. (Actually, the celler is well-</B>
<P><B>maintained, clean, and easy to navigate, normally.) There</B>
<P><B>seems to be a time-placement discordance as well. My </B>
<P><B>husband, for example, was lost for 45 minutes, wandering</B>
<P><B>around, worried about missing his next catering shift. </B>
<P><B>When he finally found the door "back out," he found that</B>
<P><B>though 47 minutes had passed on his watch, only about 10</B>
<P><B>or 11 minutes passed to everyone else.  He refused adamently</B>
<P><B>to ever fetch things out of the basement stores again, and</B>
<P><B>he is not the only employee to decide this. (They always </B>
<P><B>make the NEW employees fetch stuff, because they haven't</B>
<P><B>been lost yet.</B>
