Sacred Heart, Bloomfield Hills haunting<br>
<br>
By: MBeal@ASHMI.ORG <br>
<br>
<br>
I have attended the Academy of the Sacred Heart since the 6th grade,
and have heard the story about the boys playing by the statue before.
I'm sorry to say that it's not true. The hands of the statue did fall
off, but it was during a senior prank in which the seniors put a tutu
around the statues waist. The hands fell off because it was a fragile
statue. The school was planning on replacing the statue later that year
anyway. <br>
However, the school is haunted. There used to be a residence for nuns
on the fourth floor, which is now the boys middle school, and teachers
who stay to work late at night have seen the figures moving around the
hallways, sometimes full figures gliding into the room, stopping and
watching the teacher at work, and then disappearing right before their
eyes. The scariest ghost that I've heard of is the nun who wears a
habit so that it you cannot see her face, just black. Doors will open
and shut on their own in the middle of classes, and footsteps are heard
in the chapel late at night. Anyone who has spent the night at the
school can tell you that the organ in the choir loft plays on its own
around midnight or one o'clock in the morning. Some people have seen a
figure in black playing, but some people say that its no one at all.
There did used to be a nun who lived here that loved to play the
organ.... but no one knows for sure.<br>
I hope that I was able to clear a few things up for you.<br>

London Central High School<br>
<br>
By: jessicap@coxkliewer.com <br>
<br>
When I was 15 I was sent to London Central High School. LCHS is a dodd
school and anybody who is military should know what I mean when I say
that.<br>
LCHS is a boarding school located on a British Air Force base on a hill
in a small town called High Wycombe. It was a mix of American students
who either dormed there or were stationed in England, I was a dormie.
Anyways while I attended school there, weird things would happen. Never
anything threatening, just playful. We used to joke around about the
little boy with the ball (our resident ghost). It was a coed school
although the dorms were not. The boys dorm was directly across from the
girls dormitory. Each dorm was set up the same way, three floors with a
hallway on either side of the stairwell lined with rooms. Along with
the bedrooms each floor had a computer room, a tv room, the guidance
counselors office, a laundry room, and two bathrooms one in each hall.
At the end of each hallway the was a glass fire escape door leading out
to the stairs in case of emergencies.<br>
Now, I don't know if this actually pertains to my tale, or if it is
even true, but I had heard that the reason the school was called London
Central was because it used to be located in the central London area
and that in the early seventies it had caught fire and was moved to
High Wycombe. Anyways back to my story, because we were not completely
filled with dormies many of us got our own rooms instead of having to
share unless we wanted to (which some did). For some reason this little
boy only liked to play pranks on the girls, because the boys dorms
never had any strange happenings like we did.<br>
Many times girls would go into the bathroom and hear someone call their
name and giggle, and nobody would be in the bathroom at the time. One
time one of the girls was taking a shower on the third floor when she
said that she was washing her hair when she realized that she could not
fell the shower curtain behind her (we could always feel the shower
curtain because the pressure from the shower head would cause the
curtain to stick to your back, it was really annoying). Because she had
soap in her eyes she reached her arm back behind her to grab the
curtain or whomever was pulling on it. She still couldn't feel it.
Trying to get the shampoo out of her eyes and getting really frustrated
(she thought someone was playing a joke on her) she called for whoever
was doing it to stop. Just when she got all the shampoo out of her eyes
she opened them just in time to see the curtain falling from the
ceiling back into place. As if someone had pulled the bottom of the
curtain all the way up against the ceiling without pulling it off the
hooks. Terrified she ran out of the shower and look around the bathroom
to see if anybody else was in there, nobody was. She didn't her the
door close (it was a big wooden door which made a thud when it closed),
so she thought it was the wind. The bathroom windows were a line of I
think four or five small windows at the top of the wall (hard to open
if you didn't stand on something) and they only pushed open a little
bit. When she looked up they were all closed. Needless to say she
refused to go in that bathroom again especially not alone. One personal
story involved the ball as I mentioned before. Every week day night we
had study hall every student unless you had a certain GPA had to be in
their room studying for one hour, unless you had to use the computer
for studies. I hated study hall so I snuck out and was playing around
in the computer room (which was directly across from my room) when
suddenly I heard my neighbor pounding on my door and telling me to
"knock off the noise." Confused I went out into the hall and asked her
what the problem was. She looked confused as well and asked if anyone
else was in my room. I said no and told her that I had been in the
computer room the whole time.&nbsp; When I opened the door nobody was
in there just as I had thought considering that our door locked
automatically once closed and had to be opened with a key to get in.
She said that she was studying when she kept hearing a thud on the wall
like someone was bouncing a ball on it. Just then we all heard it
coming from her room this time.<br>
Everyone including&nbsp; my guidance counselor who came in when she
noticed all the commotion, heard it. My neighbor then ran to her room
and nobody was in there either. My guidance counselor said it was
probably just the pipes and to ignore it. I probably would have left it
at that except for an event that occurred a few weeks later that
substantiated that happening. We had a new girl transfer from Italy
into the dorms she would later become my best friend. It was her first
night there and to make her feel welcome a couple friends and myself
went to her room to meet her. Her room was at the opposite end of the
hall right next to the emergency exit door. When it was time to go to
our rooms my friends and I left (they were spending the night in my
room). About an hour or two later I got in trouble with my counselor
and they had to go back to their own rooms. I was mad about my friends
being sent upstairs so I couldn't sleep and stayed up listening to the
radio, when suddenly I heard someone frantically knocking on my door. I
thought it was my friends sneaking back down (we often snuck around
once the counselors were gone) when I opened my door I saw that it was
the new girl, she was pail white and crying hysterically, so bad that
she couldn't even talk. I eventually got her to calm down and tell me
what happened. In between gasps for air she told me that she was laying
in bed and trying to sleep she was still awake but at that point when
your eyes are slowly closing and opening attempting to stay awake no
matter how hard you are trying to sleep. She said she suddenly opened
her eyes to see a hand in her face, startled she sat up quickly and
pulled her covers up to her chin. She said that the figure backed up
slowing and came more into focus. She described the figure as a little
boy wearing jeans and a white t-shirt she also said that he had a big
red ball under his arm against his side. And then she said he spoke to
her "HI" with a little giggle. Short but sweet and then he disappeared.
As soon as he did she ran down to my room, the only person she knew.
After a little bit of coaxing I talked her into going back to her room
to get her pillow so she could stay in my room for the night. She said
okay but wouldn't go alone. When we got to her room she opened the door
and almost fainted. I asked her what was wrong this time, again crying
she said that when she ran out of the room, her lights were off her
radio was on and her window was open. Everything was the opposite when
we opened the door. The next day she moved to my end of the hall and
for the rest of the year unless she absolutely had to she never went to
that end of the hall. Nobody believed her, but I did she was absolutely
terrified and nobody had told her the story of the little boy and the
ball. On other occasions girls claimed to see a young girl crying in
the corner by the fire escape thinking it was one of the dormies would
walk over to her and she would just disappear. I don't know how to
explain all those things that happened but I know what I believe. Every
now and then I miss living there and sometimes I miss the little boy
even though I never personally saw him I would often get the feeling he
was around just planning another silly prank to play and revealing
himself to the new girls just to say "HI".<br>

Little Boy Following Me<br>
<br>
<br>
By: alauracastaneda@sbcglobal.net<br>
<br>
Hi. this experience happened in laredo in 1902 frost apt 3&nbsp; at the
side of the bed there was a little boy just looking over us and we
thought at first it was our 5 year old and we would tell him to go to
bed until one night i got up he was there and i told him lets go back
to bed but when i got there he was in bed fast asleep i returned to my
bed and he was gone. from then on i would ask him to tell me what he
needed or wanted but never got a response.<br>
In Laredo in 1202 louisiana its a two story house all the bed rooms are
upstairs so we would all sleep up there. there was only 1 room,
kitchen, living, dining, and den downstairs. the room we used it as a
play room. the tv would turn on in the middle of the night by itself, i
checked it to see if it had a timer and it didnt we thought again it
was our child well we played several "traps" for him but it was never
him the tv would be on when we would come home from work and school,
always on cartoon channels. the play room we would fix it before going
to bed and in the morning it would be messed up, same thing when we
would get home, also we would find toys on the stairs and you could
hear footsteps coming up and down. also in the balcony you could hear
someone walking on it late at night, in the foyer as well upstairs i
thought my husband had come home and i waited for a while until i would
look out my room or even when the door was open and no one would be
there... one night we went to sleep and in the morning the tree we had
upfront just collapsed with root and everything, it was healthy we
would water it so there was no reason for it collapsing... after we
moved out the owners told us we had stayed the longest ever because
people couldnt stand it hearing all those things and going through
that, they said they bought the house and lived in it about 2 months
before they moved and rented it out, we stayed almost the two years
because we did our own "investigation" until we found out it wasnt our
child.<br>

Ghost Experience<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
<br>
I thought I would relate a rather interesting experience I had as a
college student.&nbsp; During the summer of 1987 my friend Jeff and I
were driving around the small town of Columbia, PA.&nbsp; Columbia is
located in Lancaster, PA.&nbsp; Lancaster is an old colonial era city
with a fantastic history in the forming of America and in as much is
filled with wonderful ghost stories.<br>
Jeff and I decided that it would be interesting to drive to the top of
the hill over looking Columbia and see what we could see.&nbsp; As we
made our way to the hill Jeff told me that there was an old grave yard
at the top.&nbsp; I suggested we drive through it.&nbsp; As we were
driving a summer evening thunderstorm was making its way toward
town.&nbsp; The higher up the hill the more the wind increase.&nbsp; It
was the type of storm you can feel approaching.&nbsp; Lightening began
to flash and a slight rain was beginning.&nbsp; The graveyard entrance
was at the top of a blind hill in the road.&nbsp; as we crested the
hill, there was a brilliant flash of lightening and a tremendous clap
of thunder.&nbsp; The lightening must have been very close as there was
no perceivable delay between the flash and the thunder.&nbsp; In the
flash of the lightening, I saw a man standing by a large obelisk shaped
tombstone.&nbsp; He was tall, probably 6', with a paste white, gaunt
face.&nbsp; He wore a long black coat and a stovepipe hat.&nbsp; His
dress was very reminiscent of Abraham Lincoln style.&nbsp; I screamed
and practically climbed out of my seat belt.&nbsp; Jeff slammed on the
breaks asking what had happened.&nbsp; In a panic I told him.&nbsp; We
drove to the head stone where I saw the man.&nbsp; The stone marked the
grave of a man and the date on the stone was early 1800's.<br>
Apparently, these kind of sightings and occurrences are not uncommon in Columbia.<br>

A Couple of stories<br>
<br>
By: coolv43@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
I have no pictures, I brought a camra to the cemetary and all the pictures came out blurry. but, I do have stories.<br>
my first encounter: I was laying on my bed one night, trying to go to
sleep. when all of a sudden I sensed someone standing above me, believe
this or not, but as I turned around a girl with long black hair and an
80's nightgown on, stood over me, with a knife, she told "leave, leave
now you don&#8217;t belong here" I couldn&#8217;t move, all I could was stare, and
I definatly couldn&#8217;t talk. Finally, she disapeared. I did hear from her
again, she's never held a knife to me. thank you Goddess.<br>
I live up the street from a cemetary, I love the cemetary, its
absolustley beautiful. I heard its mostly soldiers from the civil war,
and most likely immagrants that died of diseases. back in the 1800's I
believe. the cemetary is falling apart and people move thr graves
around, but everytime I go in there, I see new flags for the american
soldiers.&nbsp; but I know who it is, no its not a ghost. but I am
thankfull someone cares about the old cemetary.<br>
so, I went on a walk around 8pm. and I found myself standing in the
cemetary and afraid of some thing. spirits, and gaurdians of the
cemetary. it got jet black in the cemetary, and wicked cold. but I
continued to walk. something, or someone told me to leave. but I kept
telling her that I meant her no harm. I couldn&#8217;t see much and I didn&#8217;t
want to go back too far. so I stopped. looked around and the next thing
I noticed was a girl, standing in front of me. she had long red, hair
and piercing black eyes, her body mangled, large gashes I noticed. she
held the tip of the knife to my throat, looked directly at me and said
"I told you to leave, you disobeyed me, this is my place" she drew the
knife back, and before she could hit me, I was out of there. I call her
Miyoko, shes a beautiful whome was killed, by her mother. her mother
dispised her, hated her for who she was, and so she left her at the
cemetary... shes not a bad spirit, I think she was just having a bad
night. but I know shes happy now.<br>
you ever get an e-mail, call or whatever about a possession? an
excsorsist or someone being possessed? or someone's friend or someone
else having an evil spirit or another kind in their body? well, heres a
story for you.<br>
it just a few months ago me and my friend were talking about a man that
was evil. I was 16 at the time but I had no idea that this man who was
a demon (or more so that we believed) would possess me. until a night,
on a half moon, I sensed a spirit outside. now im not the one to let an
evil spirit that is 253 years old in my house, but that&#8217;s what
happened. every became quiet and the next thing I knew, I was on the
floor, and my friend was trying to get me pinned down so stop what ever
was happening, happening. my friend is much smaller then me and didn&#8217;t
have much controll. so, the spirit ended up getting up, pushing my
friend off of me and pinning her down. I remember breathing hard, as I
fell out of my own mind. but still fighting for it to get out. the
demon growling and moaning through my mouth, as my body thrashed on the
floor to get it out. "get it out! it hurts so bad.." I kept
repeating.."get it out!" my voice was deep, and my friend stayed
strong. I knew it wasn't me I could feel the spirit tranfer his blood
in mine, it felt like pressuring on my body, like someone was curmpling
up my body and using it as a basketball. the&nbsp; spirit did pass
through, and the spirit stayed I believe for 3 days. the hardest part
was trying to get it out, all though it didn&#8217;t work so good. <br>
I hope that this was a good enough story for you, I hope you enjoyed it and have a good halloween.<br>

<br>
<br>
last summer me and some friends went up to the hill ward 5 or 6
times.&nbsp; the first time we went up there we had no idea where we
were going.&nbsp; so as we are walking down the long dark gravel road
we think we hear someone.&nbsp; so we slow up our walk and turn on our
flashlights and look around.&nbsp; nothing. we just thought it was our
imaginations running wild or something.&nbsp; so as soon as we turn off
out flashlights and start walking again i notice a figure in front of
us walking. so i shout at the figure, "Is this the way to the
ruins?"&nbsp; and ther was no responce.&nbsp; so i shout, "dont worry,
we arnt the cops, we just want to know where the building is."<br>
so i turn on my flashlight and point it at the dark figure, nothing, no
one in sight... my hair started to stand up.&nbsp; so i turn off the
flash light again and once again i see the figure walking in front of
us... so no i am interested, and i start to pick up my pace, i wanted
to catch up to the figure... so i start walking faster and faster, and
the figure has not changed his motions, but is getting further and
further away, and so i get almost to a run and i start catching up to
him... and as i get closer and closer something is telling me to get
back but i just kept going... and right as i was about 10 feet away
from the figure i turn alittle corner and there was the hospitle and
the figure was gone.<br>

2 Stories<br>
<br>
By: Stephanie.Rowland@law.arizona.edu<br>
<br>
I have two interesting stories that happened to me:<br>
Story one:<br>
My father is a retired Marine, when I was in high school we lived on
Camp Lejeune, a Marine base in NC.&nbsp; We lived in the house for
about 4 years, but I never saw anything until the last year we lived
there.&nbsp; (before this my dog would freak out and chase something,
etc. but nothing else happened).&nbsp; Anyway, I used to wake up at the
same time EVERY night.&nbsp; It was like 3:27 am, I can't remember
exactly.&nbsp; But the EXACT same time EVERY night for months on
end.&nbsp; Then one night I heard singing outside my window.&nbsp; Kind
of weird because my bedroom was on the second floor.&nbsp; I wrote it
off as a loud party and maybe the sound traveled.&nbsp; Anyway, the
NEXT night I woke up at my usual time and there was a transparent child
with sort of a bluish glow sitting in the chair beside my bed looking
at me.&nbsp; I reached out for him (her?) and my hand went right
through it.&nbsp; It wasn't really scary, just odd.&nbsp; My parents to
this day think I was dreaming.&nbsp; But I was most definitely
awake.&nbsp; <br>
Story two:<br>
A few years ago my Nana died.&nbsp; She was a wonderful woman and she
absolutely loved my son.&nbsp; He was her only great-grandchild and she
just loved children.&nbsp; Anyway, a few nights after her funeral, my
son and I were eating dinner. My son looked across the table at the
empty chair and said "Hi Nana!!!"&nbsp; Mind you, my son was not yet
three years old and I told him NOTHING about her death.&nbsp; I think
she was saying goodbye to her "little guy."&nbsp; <br>

True Ghost Stories<br>
<br>
By: startreker@sbcglobal.net<br>
<br>
I am a 47 year old woman who has lived in Indianapolis, Indiana for
most of my adult life. About 8 years ago I began working for Video
Update on Arlington Ave. When I first stated there I worked the day
shift and nothing out of the ordinary ever happened . It was only after
I was promoted up and transferred out to other stores and eventually
transferred back as General Manager that my ghost story starts.<br>
I was asked to go back to this location because for some reason the
store was not only losing money but they could not seem to keep a
manager past 6 months. Seeing as to how I had started as a regular
employee at that local and was a troubleshooter. They wanted to see if
I could fix the problem.<br>
I was putting somewhere around 50 to 60 hours a week and was tired a
lot of the time time so when things started happening I shrugged it off
as imagination. When there late at night alone I would here footsteps
in the store and no one was there but me .Out of the corner of my eyes
I would see movies move from one shelf to the other one across from it
and when I checked they would be flip flopped exactly across from each
other on the shelf's. <br>
When the district manager showed up for a inspection ( after 2 Months
of my being in charge) I joking said that I thought that the building
was haunted. You could imagine my surprise when she said " Did you see
him?" <br>
Now after this she confessed that the last two male managers would not
ever come back to this store because of the weird stuff that went on at
this store.<br>
Here are just some of the things which occurred in the 2 years that I worked at this location.<br>
The toilets would flush late at night and the lights would go on.
Motion sensors would go off and the alarm company would wake me up to
check that there was not a break in. Movie cover boxes flew off the
window ledges as if knocked off by invisible hands. I might add that
this happened right in front of me while standing with in 10 feet and
that the boxes flew far enough from the ledge to land on my shoes. It
seems he did not like any messes. When working late at night at my desk
I would feel like someone was blowing on my neck.Yet the air vent in
the office is closed .<br>
One of the regular customers out of the blue felt like she had to tell
me that the presence in the stores name was Charlie and that he had
died during the construction of the building. She also stated that he
didn't care for the male managers but that he liked me and was sorry
for freaking me out at times. She said that whenever it really bothered
me to just talk to him like I would an employee and that he would stop.<br>
I have to say that when there late at night I did do just that. When
leaving clutter in the window ledges or on the counters I would say :
Now Charlie I have to open in the morning and if you make a mess of all
this it is going to take me longer to get rid of the mess. And you
guess it nothing would be disturbed. I also used to say to him not to
move things after I leave because I would like to get a full nights
sleep and not be woke up by the alarm company. And I would get a full
nights sleep. But if I forgot then I would have to come back because of
the motion sensors.<br>
I have since left not because of Charlie but because of armed robberies
but kept in touch with the new manager(male). The store again started
losing money and he only lasted 6 months . The company decided to close
the store down . With in 6 months after that a CiCi Pizza went in. I
talked to the new ( male) manager and asked him if he has noticed any
thing happening. He said no. But the CiCi Pizza only lasted 5 months
and now the building is empty again. <br>
Makes me wonder if Charlie hasn't run them off <br>
Please don't think that I am making this up. Everything is the absolute truth.<br>

Phone Call<br>
<br>
By: brosepark@bellsouth.net<br>
<br>
<br>
Hello my name is Brose I live in Huntingdon,TN. Ive never actually saw
a ghost that I know of but I have a few good friends some family that
have. I have though had a couple of what I think were supernatural
experiences in the fall and early winter of 2004. One afternoon in
december me and one of my kids went to see my mother who lives close
by. My wife told me to call as soon as we got there cause there was
snow and ice at the time. Anyway I didnt call when we got there but
after about an hour I decided to call home. Me and my son werw in the
kithen Mom had went another room. I picked up the phone and could hear
talk from the receiver. I figured Mom was on another line. As I started
to hang up I distinctively heard my wifes voice saying ''I told him to
call as soon as he got there'' I thought her and my mom were talking so
I hung up. Mom came back in the kitchen and didnt have the cordless
phone with her,also there is no other line on that side of the house. I
picked the phone then and called home I immeadeately asked my wife if
she had tried to call. She had not,''<br>
Sometimmes people pick up befofe a phone rings and might talking to
someone in the house while not realizing that someone is already on the
other end.'' ,or vice versa. I asked had she just told my daughter or
anyone that I was supposed to call? She had not.. How did I hear her
voice so clearly? There was no one else in my moms house but me, my son
and Mom.And there is NO party phone line there. Is that a form of
doppleganger experience?? I will save my other experience for another
installation. Please feel free to email me for your idea, advice, or
similar experiences. <br>

Story about a Haunting Maybe...<br>
<br>
By: dnpl16@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I have a good story... you may not think it's real great, but I was
little, and it was happening to my whole family.&nbsp; When I lived in
Baldwinsville, we lived in this little green house, and the landlord's
wife worked at a cemetary.&nbsp; Our stairs leading to our front door
were also tombstones, that were never used.&nbsp; After a while of
living there, I would wake up and have horrible nightmares of skeletons
that were trying to get me.&nbsp; I would then wake up and look down at
the floor to see a glowing skeleton rising, so then out of fright I
would put my blankets over my face and about an hour later, I would
finally get back to sleep.&nbsp; I told my mom and dad about what was
going on, and they didn't believe me at first, they thought I was just
making it up.&nbsp; Soon after, my mom was cleaning the bathroom, and I
happened to lift up the rug around the toilet and find a black and red
toy casket.&nbsp; How strange.&nbsp; About a month later, my mom
started to see white orb like things swishing across our living room,
she told my dad, and he then started to see them.&nbsp; About a week
later, we had to evacuate our home, because our carbon monoxide
detectors were going off.&nbsp; We had carbon monoxide coming in our
house from our vents.&nbsp; Maybe you know what is going on, maybe it
was just nothing, but we thought it as haunted so we packed and moved
out of there.&nbsp; <br>

Personal Haunting and The Charlemont Inn<br>
<br>
By: timmydoomsqueaks@gmail.com<br>
<br>
I lived in this house for about four years, and it never felt "right."
Often, I would feel like I was being watched - particularly when
sitting in the living room at night. The house was relatively young,
having been built in the mid-sixties. Vials and flasks found in the
basement upon moving in were evidence of possible drug production or
experiments by the previous owners. My worst experiences were in my
bedroom (the first on the right, upstairs). I had recently begun
dabbling in the spiritual, and was attempting to contact my 'spirit
guide' via what one might call a "homemade Ouija board." Despite
warnings from my mother about such things, I did it anyway, and did it
alone. WARNING: DO NOT ATTEMPT SUCH A THING ALONE! I was sitting on the
floor of my closet, asking spirits questions, asking them what they
wanted of me. They said, "We want you to die." The tap-light across my
room began flickering violently on and off. Previous experiences with
the tap-light going from bright to dim in my presence are also notable.
The spirits were ANGRY, and proceeded to haunt me. After I felt a cold
breath on my neck and ears every night, despite being under layers of
blankets (one of them electric). Hazy figures could be seen in the room
at night. Even alone in the office (across the hall, wall has a
tapestry), I felt touched all over by invisible entities. The house is
currently occupied, do NOT attempt to trespass. <br>
The Inn is said to be haunted by a the ghost of a woman, nicknamed
"Elizabeth." Shattered glasses have been repaired, objects move and fly
through the kitchen. Feelings of being watched are also noted
throughout the building. The Inn is a historical piece of property, and
dates back to the founding of the town. Elizabeth is said to haunt one
room in particular. She's been caught as a white figure in various
pictures taken in said room. One story says that a mother and child
were in the room, when the door started shaking violently, as though
someone were trying to open it and it was locked. The mother kept
telling the daughter to stop, not seeing that the girl wasn't touching
it. Upon realizing that she wasn't, the woman said, "Stop it,
Elizabeth." The ghost is nonviolent, and generally responds to such
commands. She is social, and can often be felt brushing past patrons
standing in the lobby and the banquet room.<br>

House is occupied by 2 men, a woman, and the ghost of a cat that kneads the carpets at night.<br>
Hugo Parpart passed away in the front room, family room. His heavy
footsetps can be heard walking the floors. When alive, he drank quite
profusely. Sometimes while he's walking down the hallway towards the
master bedroom, he can be heard brushing up against the walls as if
he's staggering. Also you can hear the sound of his heavy ring hitting
the wall as if he's steadying himself.<br>
His wife Cecelia passed away 10 years before him. She likes to turn on
lights. Especially bedroom lights. The lights will go on, and the
switch willl make the normal "click" but the toggle never moves. She
too can be heard walking the main hallway going to and from the master
bedrooom.<br>
Day and night there are cold spots that appear and vanish. These cold
spots also move. The cold spots, believed to be associated with
Cecelia, are most common in the bedroom adjacent to the master bedroom
which served as her painting studio after her eldest son Steven moved
out.<br>
After inheriting the house, Steven died when the house burned in 1999.
He was found by firefighters in the family room. Lying in the same
exact place where Hugo passed away in 1994.<br>
There is no known activity directly associated with Steven.<br>
Finally there's Snoopy. Snoopy was a Russian Blue cat. He was the
family pet and died of old age at 15. At night, Snoopy used to sleep
with the youngest son Peter in his bedroom. Snoopy and Peter were the
same age and grew up together. They were very close. After Snoopy
passed on, the sound of cats claws kneading the carpet could be heard
in Peters bedroom very frequently. When he was living, this tomcat
would go out doing his tomcat thing. When he would come inside in the
early morning hours,(usually around 2am), he regulary went into Peter's
room to sleep at the foot of the bed. He would announce his intentions
by purring loudly and kneading the floor for a few minutes before
jumping up on the bed.<br>
This manifestation is by far the most common, occurring more nights than not.<br>
The Parpart Family; Hugo, Cecelia, Steven and Peter were the original
owners of the house moving in directly after completion in 1967. It is
believed that it was one of the very first houses to be completed on
San Carlos Way. The house is currently occupied by Steven's widow
Sharon.<br>
The only surviving member of the Parpart family is me, Peter, and I did witness all of these things first hand.<br>
I lived in the house from the time of my birth in 1968 until I moved
away in 1994. I knew all of the homes idiosyncracies. I knew which
windows creaked when the wind blew, every creaky floorboard, etc. After
all those years living in the same home, it was easy to tell when there
was someone in the house, and where they were.<br>
None of the entities were ever malicious, though sometimes they were a bit startling.<br>

New Century Air Haunting<br>
<br>
<br>
By: cosmicpal@comcast.net<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I came across an article in the local independent paper (Westword),
here in Denver, Colorado.&nbsp; The article mentioned your
shadowlands.net site and I can't begin to tell you how interesting it
is.&nbsp; But, I was pleasantly surprised to notice you had a listing
for a couple of places I was very familiar with when I was living in
the Greater Kansas City area.&nbsp; <br>
The first area of interest is the New Century Air Center (formerly
known as Johnson County Industrial Airport) in Olathe, Kansas.&nbsp; I
used to work for Executive Beechcraft located onsite back in the early
90's.&nbsp; I worked there for 3 years.&nbsp; <br>
Up until that time, I never believed in ghosts.&nbsp; The first couple
of years working there, I heard strange happenings all the time.&nbsp;
I always ignored them or blamed them on the winds, stray animals, and
an old, creaky building (the abandoned hangar on the west side of the
airfield).&nbsp; I used to hear stories about a few pilots who crashed
during, as far back as WWII, but there was always one that was the most
interesting to my fellow co-workers and resident pilots- I've forgotten
the name he was given, but he did miss the runway and crashed into the
now abandoned hangar.&nbsp; I believe he's the ghost.&nbsp; <br>
A couple of times, guys would mention how the place was haunted and I
would laugh and make fun of their beliefs.&nbsp; But, then came the
night- then night I'll never forget as long as I live.&nbsp; It was
late at night, in the middle of summer.&nbsp; It was still very humid
outside.&nbsp; The temperature was still in the 80's.&nbsp; Since we
are 30 miles southwest of Kansas City, the darkness outside was deep
and dotted with a million stars.&nbsp; I was fueling one of the jet
fuel trucks and peering up at the night sky.&nbsp; I was on top of the
truck while it was being fueled when I hear a noise like someone was
walking toward me.&nbsp; When I looked in the direction, the sound
stopped.&nbsp; So, as usual, I blamed the sound on something the wind
would make.&nbsp; <br>
But, the noise then grew closer and heavier.&nbsp; I then figured it
was a co-worker or two playing games.&nbsp; And then it spoke.&nbsp; I
couldn't understand what it said, but it was a hurting voice, a painful
voice, a dying voice.&nbsp; My heart raced.&nbsp; And then it felt like
someone was standing next to me, but I couldn't see them.&nbsp; In that
very moment, the air around me chilled me to the bones.&nbsp; It was
frigid!&nbsp; I immediately ceased the fueling process, and hopped in
the truck, and drove as fast as I could out of there.&nbsp; <br>
I don't know what it was, but that moment made me a believer.&nbsp;
Some of the co-workers and myself went to a bar an hour later- and I
was still shaking from the experience.&nbsp; I couldn't hold my beer
bottle straight.&nbsp; They were all concerned, so I told them what had
happened.&nbsp; From then on- we would have two guys go as a team to
fuel the trucks.&nbsp; <br>
The second place of interest happens to be another place I used to work
at:&nbsp; Kemper Arena, Kansas City Missouri.&nbsp; However, the site
says the WWF wrestler fell from the ceiling 3 years ago.&nbsp; What
year this was posted on the website, I have no idea.&nbsp; The
intersting thing here is- I used to work for a professional soccer team
and minor league hockey based in the arena in 1995.&nbsp; My office
during the day was in Kemper Arena, and at nights, I worked the
games.&nbsp; During the halftime shows, I used to climb up to the
catwalks and drop minature soccer balls for a local store's
promotion.&nbsp; So, I've been everywhere in that arena, and I can tell
you this- I've never experienced anything out of the ordinary.&nbsp;
Particularly, since I met my first encounter at the airport before
working at Kemper Arena.&nbsp; <br>
Again, I don't know when that "3 years ago" is, and the only thing
scary then was being on the catwalk and afraid it would give way.&nbsp;
;-)&nbsp; <br>
Anyways, I thought you and your staff would be interested in hearing those tales from someone who's been there.&nbsp; <br>
Happy Halloween,<br>

My Haunting Story<br>
<br>
By: fozzybear2@adelphia.net<br>
<br>
I've only had one haunting so far and yes I don't mind telling you that I do believe in ghosts. This is my story:<br>
This took place January 27th 1987, we were living in a home that my
father had built during the late 1970's. My mother's parents had aged
to a point where the were no longer able to live at the family farm and
had moved into a house in the small town of New Richmond WI. Grandpa
had, had a stroke a couple of years prior and Grandma's persistent
health problems had led to the move. One day my Grandma became so ill
that she was taken to the local hospital where she spent several weeks
in a dementia like state. Her short term memory had became about five
minutes long and she barely knew anybody or what was going on. Shortly
after she was taken to the hospital, my grandfather who up to that time
had been relatively healthy except for some minor deficits in the use
of one arm and problems with balance decided one day that he wasn't
going to eat, talk, or even get out of bed for the matter. The family
shipped him to the same hospital that his wife had been in. I guess we
all expected Grandma who was much worse on to pass first but this was
not the case. <br>
One day after grandpa had been admitted he walked over to his wifes
beside told her goodbye and then got back into his own bed and went to
sleep never to awaken. Grandma remained in the hospital until they
finally transfered her to a nursing home saying that she wasn't ever
going to get any better that it was only just a matter of time. My
mother had brought grandma a small battery operated alarm clock to use
while she was in the hospital. When grandma was transfered mom brought
the clock home, removed the battery's which where dead and set it down
in the laundry room on the built-in clothes folding station that was
located next to the washer and dryer. There the clock up there on the
folding station for about a month while grandma continued to hold on. <br>
The day finally came when my mother received a phone call from the
nursing home to let her know that my Grandma was finally passing and
that she should go. Mom left that morning and the rest of stayed at
home as Mom had eight children in her family and that there wouldn't be
much room in grandma's tiny room for anymore people then that. Maybe
two hours had gone by after my mother had left and I'd gone into the
laundry room to fold a load of clothes. I guess anything to keep myself
busy as we waited for the call from my mom saying that she had passed
on. As I was folding grandma's alarm clock suddenly went off. I
remember giving an exasperated sigh as the noise seemed to intrude on
my otherwise somber mood. Without thinking I picked up the clock and
searched for the button to turn if off. It was then that something felt
off because the clock was much lighter then it should have been. It
kept ringing and wouldn't stop so finally frustrated with the thing I
tipped it over and removed the battery cover. It was my intention to
remove the battery's thinking that something was wrong with the clock.
Much to my surprise the space where the battery's should have been was
empty and then just as suddenly the clock stopped buzzing and then the
phone rang. I put the clock down where I found it and ran out to the
kitchen to answer the phone and it was my mother stating that my
Grandma had just died.<br>
Have I had anything weird happen since, no...maybe it was grandma
telling me that she was passing away and her time was up in her own
way. <br>
She was a good person and I think she must have met up with grandpa and
they both passed into the light together. They where very much in love
and I think that grandpa must have known that his life partner wasn't
ever coming back and couldn't stand to sit by and watch her suffer so
he passed on so that he could wait for her on the other side.<br>

My House was Haunted Growing up<br>
<br>
By: NolasMermaid@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I grew up in a 3 bedroom home in a small neighborhood of Virginia Beach , VA<br>
In early 80's . I started seeing strange things in the house from the age of 8 <br>
my stepfather saw many horrible things.&nbsp; A black Smokey figure of a person<br>
hovering over the bed of my pregnant mother. I saw eyes always looking at me in the <br>
window of my bedroom at night and sometime in the kitchen. My mother saw them once <br>
as well. I believe it was when I turned 10 years old I began to hear screams of women <br>
and children in the kitchen at night - I would get so scared I had to sleep with my older <br>
sister or parents. I also had the weirdest dreams in that house, that I was frozen in <br>
my bed and couldn't move I was so afraid to even breathe. I tried with
the force of everything I had to crawl out of bed -- crawl to the front
door. My parents would find me asleep by the front door a few times. I
saw a green light fly across the living room - one night when it was <br>
very dark and all the nights were off in my home. My mother believed
this home was dammed and we had to move.&nbsp; We found out later while
living there that is home <br>
was&nbsp; huge in the news in the 70's. A man killed his whole family
there and hid there bodies in the garage. The garage was my bedroom
after family before us bought the home. They rehabbed it a bit . ...
Scary to look back on that after all these years.<br>
I lived in another home alone in a bad neighborhood in New Orleans -
the same thing happened to me there. I being so scared when sleeping I
could moved but <br>
used every force I had to&nbsp; crawl to the door .. hahhaha I guess that's my sign now <br>
that I say hey (it's time to move)<br>

My Ghost to The Rescue<br>
<br>
By: skatefire9214@yahoo.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Hey this is Amy. I recently just read almost&nbsp; all of the stories
on here. Ive always been facinated with the idea of supernatural beings
being on earth. Well when I was about 5 years old I lived in a house
built in the 1960's. My grandparents lived next door. My grandfather
told me about an old couple who died in the house a while back and of a
man who fell in the huge space of 100ft of water under the house.
Anyways back to my encounter. The house was old and needed to be heated
with a kerosene heater. At the time only my dad, my brother, and I was
there. Well sometime in the middle of night the kerosene heater went
out some disfunctions made it blow dangerously smoke all over the
house. It was enough to kill you if in it to long. Well, my dad and
brother, at the time my brother was 3 years old fell asleep in the
living area. I was in my own room being a big girl and all. We were all
sound asleep when something nudged me as if someone waking you up. I
woke up not knowing why my vision was blurred. I woke my dad up and he
realized what the heater had done. He cleaned me and my brother up as
there was gray ash all over us. All I can say is what ever woke me up I
have to thank for my life. This is not very scary but is very true.
Thanks<br>

My Ghost Cat<br>
<br>
By: lclkerl@msn.com<br>
<br>
The house I bought five years ago was built in 1880.&nbsp; It has a good feeling to it; nothing horrible every happened here.<br>
But the man who owned my house for most of the 20th Century kept cats,
lots of cats.&nbsp; It is said that he buried most of them in the back
yard, as they met their demise.&nbsp; And a deep depression in my back
yard, under a tree, is said to be where most of them are buried.<br>
I had only lived in the house about a week, when on going to bed, I
felt a cat jump in the bed and settle down next to my legs.&nbsp; I
have two cats, but I always lock them out of my bedroom at night.&nbsp;
I thought one of them had somehow gotten "trapped" in the room with me,
so, resignedly, I turned on the light, intent on getting up and letting
him out.&nbsp; There was nothing there.<br>
Many times since, when both my cats are comfortably curled up in the
living room, I feel my bed move and the warm body of a cat settle down
next to me.&nbsp; I've named him Harvey.<br>

My Own Experiences<br>
<br>
By: ldbruce@olypen.com<br>
<br>
I do remember a time when I lived in Enumclaw Washington of a few
experiences I had. I know of a restaurant on Highway 410 by the
fairgrounds that has a back room for dinner parties. I noticed these
lights on the ceiling that hang down and there is always this on light
that always swings in a circle in always the same direction. It is
always the same light and the only one that is moving in the room. I
found that to be very odd. Now I can't remember the address of the
place but I know where this place is. If you need to talk with me you
can email me at blueharmony30@yahoo.com.<br>
The other experience I had was at a house I lived in with a friend. It
was a house my friend grew up in and is also located in Enumclaw
Washington. I remember one morning waking up to the noise of someone
walking down the hallway past my room. Thinking it was one of my
roommates I opened my door to see who was up. As soon as I did the
footstep noise suddenly stopped and it seemed everyone was still in
their rooms asleep. Just thinking I was just hearing things I closed my
door to go back to sleep. Very soon after shutting the door the
footstep noise started again. I quickly opened the door and the noise
instantly stopped. I had to get up. It was freaking me out.<br>

My Childhood ESP<br>
<br>
By: kouryuu_no_sakura@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
When I was a kid, I had the ability to feel the presence of unknown
'existence'. I would suddenly feel scared and frightened to death when
I was in a certain place even with many people around. I often went to
my father's hometown where there are many old buildings from hundreds
years ago with war filled historical background and suddenly felt a
chill in my back or frightened every time I passed a big old landmark
building which I found out later as a place that's surrounded by many
ghost stories.&nbsp; But the most interesting experience I had is when
I was in the elementary school (about in the 5th or 6th grade).<br>
My school arranged a field trip to a historical monument known as the
"Lubang Buaya" (Crocodile Hole in English) area. It's a historical
ground where some of the national heroes were murdered by communist
group(s). At that time I didn't know anything about the place or the
history and felt no fear at all before we arrived at the site. But when
I first laid my feet off from the bus I suddenly felt so scared as
there was something very evil surrounding the historical site. My heart
beat like crazy despite the excitement of my classmates and the
teachers. I couldn't enjoy myself being there.<br>
We then went to the main site where I learnt about the history of the
place. Some military officials were kidnapped and murdered and six of
their bodies were dumped in a 12 meter deep, narrow well (which now the
historical site is located) back in 1965. This was known as the
September 30th Communist Party Movement. When my friends were enjoying
the excitement of learning from the site, I felt very nauseous after
looking inside the hole (which had a lamp in it and no longer a 12
meter deep well). I felt very scared and I wanted to cry. I was really,
really scared that even looking at the diorama statues in the site
freaked me out. I couldn't speak or anything. Later on we went to the
museum located in front of the site of the hole. I clutched to my
teacher's arm and I felt a very dark feeling coming from the museum's
building. I was the only kid who trembles and after spending some times
in the museum I went to go back to the bus with other people who
entered the museum earlier than my group.<br>
I did not dare to visit the part of the museum where they keep
blood-smeared clothes of our national heroes. After arrived at the bus,
I still felt very scared. I went to the toilet with my friend and I
thought I felt someone was present outside the restroom's door, though
when I peeked outside from the bottom of the door I saw no people's
feet. After came back home from my field trip I couldn't sleep at all
at night. I kept my mom and my auntie up all night and I did not speak
any words for three days. I never went back to the site again. But then
again I remembered I always felt very, very scared whenever I had a
field trip to museums or historical sites, and yes, my country's
history is filled with bloodshed. Luckily for me, after went to junior
high school I somehow become very brave and do not easily frightened of
ghost stories (but I still believe them though).<br>

In 1972 my mom shot herself. She still haunts the house. She was a neat
freak and will clean up the house if it is dirty. If shoes or clothes
are strewn on the floor, she will pick them up and put them away. My
youngest daughter spent the night there with one of her friends in the
late eighties and she said a woman sat down beside her on the bed and
told her 'she was sorry'. My daughter said that she looked so sad. I
showed her a picture of her grandmother and she paled. She told me,
"that was the woman, mom I thought she was a real person sitting next
to me". She isn't a bad spirit, just sad for taking her life and
missing out. She doesn't hurt anyone but she does keep the house clean.<br>

Was it Real?<br>
<br>
By: Arment24@comcast.net<br>
<br>
<br>
My mother passed away at home on May 13, 1997.&nbsp; She was well loved
by alot of people and it was hard for the people in my family to deal
with the loss.&nbsp; This was the begining of the next 11 months of
hell as my family had lost not only my mother, but 4 MORE members of my
immediate family.&nbsp; My mother was found at home about 4 hours after
she had passed away outside the backdoor of her house by our next door
neighbor (who I had found when he passed away).<br>
A few days after her passing, I went to her place of employment to
gather her personal belongings and as I walked into the employees door
of where she worked, I had my head down looking at the ground.&nbsp; I
walked probably about 10 to 15 feet into the door and when I picked my
head up, I saw my mother standing at the opposite end of the hall
looking at me.&nbsp; She was wearing her eyeglasses around her neck
like she always wore them.&nbsp; She had her brown curly hair (shoulder
lenght) and I froze right where I was standing.<br>
I stared back for about 30 seconds and then she walked down the very
last isle in the warehouse.&nbsp; This was a pretty long warehouse so
when she walked away, I ran to the isle and it probably only took a
matter of 30 to 45 seconds to get there but as I rounded the corner,
she was gone.&nbsp; I walked up and down every isle in the warehouse
looking for anybody who I may had mistaken her for but nobody even was
remotely wearing the same clothes that I had just saw my mother wearing
a few seconds before.&nbsp; I didn't know if what I had seen was real
or if my mind was playing a trick on me.<br>
My brother had moved into her house after she passed away to prevent
people from breaking into her house because she had lived alone and he
had told me that while he was home, he had heard the doorbell ring and
when he went to answer it, there was nobody there.<br>
When my wife and I had our 3rd child in November of 2002, we had
decided to use my mothers first name, as our new daughters MIDDLE name
(Irene).&nbsp; Well, as my wife was giving birth to our new baby
daughter, my wife told me that she had seen my mother standing in the
corner of the delivery room and that had made my wife relax as our new
child came into the world.<br>
I used to be very skeptical of ghost stories because they seemed too "far-fetched" to be for real until this happened to me.<br>

House on Denton Rd Canton, MI<br>
<br>
By: onepaintrider@peoplepc.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
When my husband and I were first married in 1986, we rented an old farm
house on Denton Rd.&nbsp; close to the Denton Bridge.&nbsp; Although we
saw alot of kids trying to get the "Ghosts"&nbsp; to come out on the
bridge we ourselfs never saw any there.&nbsp; We did however have
experiences in the house we rented.&nbsp; For instance, One night as we
were setting out to go to dinner with firends we got into a little tiff
about if we should leave the ligths on in the kitchen for when we came
home.&nbsp; I said yes because the house was so remote and dark at
night, My husband said no it waste electrity.&nbsp; When eneded up only
turning on the outside light.&nbsp; When we returned after dinner,
Every light in the house was on, even the ones in the closets that you
have to turn on by pulling a little chain!&nbsp; We could set itmes
doen and they were moved to other places.&nbsp; Strange noises came
form the basement well.&nbsp; I would hear voices talking when there
was no one there.&nbsp; I would smell lilacs in the middle of
winter.&nbsp; My husband who is a total non believer to this day says
there was something in that house.&nbsp; They were never mean, just
kinda pranksters.&nbsp; The road has changed and the bridge is gone but
the house is still there, I have always wondered if the new people
living there ever had such occurances.<br>

Hotel at Williams Railroad Station<br>
<br>
By: LStark@nep.benfranklin.org <br>
&nbsp;<br>
We spent two nights at this hotel.&nbsp; The first night was
fine.&nbsp; The second night I decided to take pictures of the
beautiful lobby.&nbsp; The picture I took had a strange &#8220;smoke&#8221; from
above a woman&#8217;s head (this area is non-smoking).&nbsp; When I went back
to the room, I joked to my husband that I got a picture of a ghost in
my picture.<br>
That night I woke up when I felt someone sit on the other side of my
bed.&nbsp; I thought &#8220;Why is my husband coming into my bed?&#8221;&nbsp; It
was then that I looked over to the other bed and my husband was snoring
softly in that bed.&nbsp; The &#8220;person&#8221; sighed and laid down next to me
and put his arm around me.&nbsp; I was petrified and couldn&#8217;t move or
speak.&nbsp; I tried to call out my husband&#8217;s name, but the words just
wouldn&#8217;t come.&nbsp; Finally, I got my arm out from the blankets and
picked up the &#8220;arm&#8221; and moved it off of me.&nbsp; The arm was skinny
and hairless.&nbsp; I was then able to call my husband to come over to
my bed to sleep with me.&nbsp; When he did, nothing else happened that
night.&nbsp; <br>
It took me three days to tell my husband what happened.&nbsp; I had a
hard time believing it myself and wanted to think about it before I
told my husband.<br>
I won&#8217;t stay there again!<br>

Story from 1920's<br>
<br>
By:ray.kokel@yahoo.com<br>
My name is raymond&nbsp; I was born&nbsp; in harlingen texas my story
goes back from what my family can remember. Around the 1920s my
grandmother had just fought with her mother and cursed at her. My
grandma was around 12 or so at the time.&nbsp; My grandma ran to a pile
of wood and after sitting there for a few minutes she felt the wood
tremble and a undescrible moan came from the pile and threw her off the
pile.&nbsp; My grandma then ran to her mom and apologized for
everything and asked for forgiveness.&nbsp; About 10-15 years Later for
reasons unknown to my family she seeked help from a family supposedly
able to assist people in supernatural affairs.&nbsp; They banished her
from their house because she had some curse on her and her
family.&nbsp; When my mother was younger she had her own stories to
tell but the most memorable things happened to my sisters and I.&nbsp;
My older sister when she was about 15 had a strange encounter with a
beast like creature staring at her from a mirror.&nbsp; My little
sister had a creature constantly visiting her in the night and making
her do things unnormal like peeing in the hallway or screaming while
she slept.&nbsp; I had visitations while I was about to sleep when my
bed would suddendly be pressed down next to me.&nbsp; The things that
happened to me only happened after my grandmother died we were very
close.&nbsp; The night that she died she visited me in a dream saying
that she had to leave but she couldn't take me with her.&nbsp; When I
awoke the next morning my mom told me she died.&nbsp; That's when I
experienced the supernatural like being held down while I slept trying
to get up or even open my eyes and not able to.&nbsp; Only when I in my
mind does the experience stop.&nbsp; Also feeling sensations of other
beings or manifestations around me when I no one is there.&nbsp; There
is too many stories to recall right now but if you can tell me I am not
crazy I would appreciate it.&nbsp; Thanks Ray<br>

My House is Haunted<br>
<br>
<br>
By: angeleena_m_c@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
I've posted my stories before, and I have a new experiance.<br>
My house in my opinion is haunted. . . well I'm not scared by any
means. I've become used to them, and they've apperated to me more than
once. I feel safe, thats for sure. Okay I get creeped out but here's my
exspirance. <br>
I was sitting on my bed on a Saturday night, I was typing on my
computer. I usually medetate, but I really don't get a chance much, so
I'll usually try to talk to the ghosts, but its hard. Well as I sat
typing my remote next to the table across the room. My TV was off and I
was very focused. I had a paper do the next morning. Well from the
corner of my eye I noticed my remote fly off the counter and into the
wall. I spazed. Then my TV turned on and started flipping through
channels, until it got to a certain channel that I watch a paranormal
show like clock work and had decided my paper was to important. <br>
I was more in shock then anything as I felt pressure on the side of my
bed and a cold presance next to me, as if it was trying to talk. My
laptops energy drained and went off. I coul hear a whisper in my ear,
but I couldn't really hear what it was saying. A few minutes past and
with the TV still on, the thing got off the bed and I felt it leave the
room. But when I turned off the TV, it came on again. This went on
until I yelled for them to stop and then I kind of felt that it sat on
the other bed in my room, and it laid down. I saw pressure in the bed
and then it was gone.<br>

Ghosts and My Family<br>
<br>

&nbsp; <br>
This is NO JOKE.&nbsp; My family and I being almost all including wife
and daughter have seen unnatural things putting it lightly. I dont know
how to explain any of it. When i was about 13 yrs old my parents and I
lived in a house that would have things happen all the time. Mainly at
night of course. In this house every night at 11pm the dead bolt to the
front door would lock. None of every actually never seen it lock but
would here the noise. Also one night I had seen to figures glowing in a
green tint in front of my bedroom door. They were both males dressed
like the time of President Lincoln. One had top hat the other was
balding. It scared me to the point that I couldnt sceam. The next
mournig I had over heard my Mom and Dad talking. My Mom was telling my
Dad that she had seen two ghosts last night. Before she could tell her
story I was already in the living room. I then told my mom and dad what
I had seen. They were shocked especially my mom. As the story was told
she would finish my sentences. WOW. I freaked out thinking it was all
true. It was...<br>
Later in life my daughter was screaming at the top of her lungs. My
wife I ran to her room. She was standing on her bed (crib) screaming at
her shut closet door. This door was left open for a night light. I
freaked out open the door, the light was off and I turned it back on.
Nothing was in there except clothes and stuff. At this point (Ooo
chills) I remembered my past. <br>
A couple of years later I had seen more things like moving shadows etc.
Things that I will be able to explain. I know that the dead live among
us. Thats my only explanation.<br>
Well thanks for reading my story all though I had to cut a lot of things out to make this letter short.<br>
Please if you would like to reply we can tell our exp. together.<br>
My wife and I was a top a hill over looking a old house (that has been
destroyed) as we talked we both had seen a man between us in the rear
view mirror. The image we had was very grosome. It scared the crap out
of us both. I peeled off in a hury, scared to death to say the least.
We did however return to the area within a week or so. Not to get to
graffic but we were making out and stuff, LOL. As this was happening my
wife freaked out. I had no idea what was going on. I then felt a
strange bad fealing in side. She had told me in a flash that the roof
of my truck had lifted up. She said "The seat sucked me in". I again
freaked out thinking of my past experiences with ghosts and unnatural
things.To let you I felt at the same time a pulling sensation that was
not right. I then left the area never to return. <br>
&nbsp;My wife and I had moved away from this town two or three years
later. Then we had our daughter and thats were my last story starts.
Leaving parts and years out of course. We now live in the city we left
finding that the house that we had once over looked has been destroyed
like had said. Know a road passes through the area and you would never
find me using that road.<br>
&nbsp;Another experieince that my wife and I had encountered was in the
basement of my parents. At the time we were broke and needed help to
get back on track. I will tell you this story another time due to the
chills and how freaked out I am at this time.<br>

San Pedro<br>
<br>
By: hardrocker13@msn.com<br>
<br>
Hello my name is Brian, one night me and some friends went to San
Pedro. To the Sunken City (a place where a city sunk into the ocen and
hundreds died), we were there at about 2a.m. My friend was standing on
a rock looking down at the ocean, when suddenly his shoulders and head
flew back than his legs as if he was pushed I caught him, he came at me
with great force. he was freaked out he lifted his shirt and had two
hand prints on his chest/collar. <br>
So we were a little cautious after that. We looked down and seen a
blueish glowing man who walked across the rocks quite fast, the rocks
are very slippery might i add. He just paced back and forth. So we went
down to check it out on the way down i had slipped and almost fell but
i felt something holding me up pushing on my chest. I continued down to
find no one down there. so we returned up. While climbing up we all
felt as if we had gained about 20lbs. when i got to the top
someone/something grapped my leg and pulled it. i yanked it lose and
found a hand print on my leg and where the fingernails would be i was
cut as if they dug their nails into me. walking out there is this tree
we passed a small girl, looked about three years old long black hair,
and a brownish dress walked out of the tree looked at us, we said
"hello" and she stepped back into the tree. i've been there about five
times sence and had no other sightings. although my brother claims to
have seen the same little girl in the tree. i have photos but
unfortunatly there is nothing on them just the trees and rocks. if you
would like to see them you can email me at Hardrocker13@msn.com<br>

Chapel piece in antique mall<br>
<br>
By: jennesa_@hotmail.com <br>
<br>
I&#8217;ve had a few experiences with paranormal activities&#8230;.Doors swinging
open, soda cans moving on there own before my very eyes, heard
something like what I think and Angel would sound like.&nbsp; We were
camping in the middle of no where, thought it was the tooth fairy but I
didn&#8217;t have any missing teeth. I didn&#8217;t open my eyes b/c I didn&#8217;t want
to see it.&nbsp; Maybe it would have been mad that there weren&#8217;t any
teeth.&nbsp; Logic of a 5 year old child.&nbsp; Also have had my covers
hold me down&nbsp; unable to move at all.&nbsp; All this things
happened in different locations and different times in my life over a
span of many years.&nbsp; My latest,&nbsp; I don&#8217;t really call
paranormal but more that I&#8217;m in tune with this sensitivity.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve
shared my stories with my Mother but I never get the feeling she
believes any of them.&nbsp; Anyway, she was in town for the weekend,
and we went to a local antique mall.&nbsp; Now this antique mall has
had an unusual things.&nbsp; Once there was an old wooden hospital
operating bed that you could see where blood had seeped into the aging
cracks of the woods.&nbsp; Strange huh?&nbsp; Creepy.&nbsp; Well the
day my mother and I went to see what was new.. there was this piece
from a Catholic church in Spain.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t know what it was but
was unusually attracted to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Looked like where maybe you
would have went to pray.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I got closer to it I felt this
energy that tickled my body.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the best way I can describe
the feeling.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t say anything to my Mom about it, just asked
her to come closer and look at it.&nbsp; When she got as close as I was
I asked how she felt.&nbsp; She said she felt like there was some type
of energy coming from this furniture.&nbsp; As we moved away the energy
would go away, as we got closer it came back. Really strange.&nbsp; <br>

Missouri Residence Tale<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
<br>
<br>
We bought a house in the southern part of St. Louis County when we
moved here in 1998 (we still live in it) - a normal, suburban
subdivision home.<br>
It was built in 1987.&nbsp; Nothing remarkable about it at all.&nbsp;
We had probably lived in it for about 6 months when the "occurrence"
happened.&nbsp; I was standing in the kitchen having a conversation
with my wife, and the kids were playing in their rooms.&nbsp; In the
middle of a sentence, I got the worst case of heebie-jeebies I've ever
had.&nbsp; It felt like someone was behind me, and then had walked
right through me.&nbsp; My wife was right in front of me.<br>
While she didn't see or feel anything, she saw me turn white, jump
sideways and turn - all in the space of about 1 bazillionth of a
second!&nbsp; Right in mid sentence.&nbsp; Forgot what we'd been
talking about afterwards.<br>
We had purchased the home from a widowed woman.&nbsp; A few months
later we learned from our neighbors that her husband had been
terminally ill, and had died in the home under hospice care a few years
earlier.&nbsp; Don't know if it was him or not - and nobody has
experienced anything else "supernatural"<br>
here since.&nbsp; It was definitely the most creeped out I have ever been.<br>

Growing Up in a Haunted House<br>
<br>
By: TOADZTATTZE@MSN.COM<br>
<br>
&nbsp;My name is Beth Holmes and I had grown up in a house build in 1900. My mom's parents had owned the house<br>
when she grew up, they later sold it to another party. After my mother
married about 3 years later they happened to rent the same house then
owned by a railroad company. The first time I had seen something I was
only 6 or 7 <br>
years old. I had gone to bed and started to say my night prayer (I was raised Catholic). When I started saying it<br>
a figure of a head appeared before me and was saying the prayer along with me, when the prayer was done he <br>
vanished. I had actually thought it was Jesus being that young I did not realize it was someone else.<br>
Later while I was in&nbsp; High School my mother happened to notice I
was started reading about ghost stories and&nbsp; parapsychology, she
asked me if I had seen the man who dressed like a monk wandering
around. She told me of his visits he makes to her late at night when
she would wake up and have him stare right into her face being inches<br>
away and then he would straighten up turn and walk right through the
wall into the next bedroom. I then asked her what he looked like, she
described him being bald with the crown of hair around his head and
wearing the brown traditional robe with the rope tie around his waist
and the hood would sometimes be up. I then told her about my evening
prayer when I was younger and I had thought his course hair looked like
a crown of thorns making me think<br>
it was Jesus. I was excited! Occasionally the house had strange noises like walking up stairs and the lights would<br>
turn on and off by themselves. One time the Stereo turned on by itself
and the dial would move back and forth like trying to find a good
station. My friend and myself would shut if off and try figure out how
the button could be pulled out by itself. The power switch is one you
had to pull to turn on and push to turn off. Some years later (1981) my
brother was lying on his bed @ 4pm while it was still light outside
listening to his radio when he&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; noticed his
Album cover on the wall started flapping and tore itself off the wall
and it was flying around the room like a tornado, he then noticed had a
cloaked figure standing at the foot of his bed pointing at him while
the cover was still circling the room. My mother and I were upstairs in
her room which was down the hall when suddenly we heard him scream. I
was the closest to the doorway and had seen a shadow of the figure,
then it vanished while my brother had jumped up from the bed and ran
out of the room. He was hysterical and yelling about the ghost scaring
him. apparentlly the monk didn't like the Album cover on the wall (it
was Meatloaf Bat out of Hell).<br>
When my parents moved the house was vacant when the a brothers
girlfriend was trying to find my brother and thought he mentioned he
was going to the vacant house to check it because he still had a key
and the company<br>
who then owned it was going to tear it down. She was calling his name from the outside front and heard<br>
someone yelling from the inside saying "I'm in here" so she went to the back door and entered the enclosed<br>
porch and had seen a man inside coming to the backdoor at the same time saying "come on in"<br>
when he approached the door he disappeared. We think a monk and his housekeeper had lived in the house<br>
around the time it was built. The St. Paul Cathedral 5 to 6 blocks not sure if he was there or not. <br>
The housekeeper was seen outside tending to the bushes outside in the front of the house and friends<br>
had commented they could see right though her.<br>
