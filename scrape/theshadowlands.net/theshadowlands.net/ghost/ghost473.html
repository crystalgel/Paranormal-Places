By:sightsunseen@nhghosts.com<br>
I have a friend of mine whose been metal detecting for over 20 years
and he'd shown me some interesting artifacts he discovered. Many of the
items of were found on an estate in southern Vermont that dated back to
the Revolutionary War.&nbsp; One day, during the late afternoon, we had
the idea to lay out the stuff on a white blanket on top of a rod iron
patio table and take a picture. Both of us are very interested in
history, and this expresses itself in his propensity for metal
detecting and my interest in the paranormal. The variety of
objects--old coins, a cannon fuse holder, an old toy, a dagger from the
Civil War, a gold snuff box--and their historic nature really struck
me. On at late August night around 11pm, my friend and I were standing
around a campfire in his backyard. I had wanted to visit the estate
where he discovered most of the artifacts because he told me about
being &#8216;helped along' by a ghost when he was metal detecting. This took
the form of a helpful hand on his back. "No way, you've been touched?"
I said, a little too exuberantly. "Oh yeah. It was like I was walking
in a line of people. I paused a moment, and felt a hand on my back,
like it was encouraging me to keep moving." My friend isn't scared of
ghosts, but he is very leery. Of course, he is wise to be cautious.
When you've seen full-bodied apparitions that have spoken to you, ended
up in a line of ghostly revolutionary war soldiers, and have been metal
detecting and found a ring still attached to skeletal hand and
arm--then re-bury it, ring intact- he had every right to be wary. So,
after nagging him for about a year, he finally indulged me, and we
hiked down the road and crept up on the big estate during the full
moon. We stuck to the shadows as we edged up to the well-manicured lawn
and looked toward the house-an old New England estate that even had a
photograph of some Civil War soldiers standing outside the residence
hanging in a frame above the fireplace. This photograph could be easily
seen-I had glimpsed it one during the day-if you could get close enough
to peek inside the large bay window looking in on the living
room.&nbsp; I had kept telling my friend that I wanted to run up and
look in the window. He said that he didn't think that this was a good
idea. My friend had permission to be on the property to metal detect
whenever he wanted, and we weren't worried about the police arresting
us for trespassing as both of us are the trust-worthy sort. The house
wasn't abandoned by any stretch of the imagination, though we knew no
one was there at the time. Well-taken care of by a caretaker, it was an
excellent example of an old New England salt box, with an old red barn
on the property. Considering the historical nature of the location-and
with all the artifacts that had been discovered-the place was something
we definitely treated with respect. We had crept to the edge of a lilac
bush, next to a big tree, across an expanse of lawn from the window
that I planned to look in. Being a fledgling paranormal investigator at
the time, I had a vague realization that this isn't really how you
should do that sort of thing, and wasn't prepared in the least. With
this thought in my brain, I made a break for the house. I ran to the
northwest corner, and hid in the shadow of a rhoderdenron from which I
could inch my way up and peek in the picture window. I moved forward
very slowly. The sound of the crickets and other insects was very loud.
I got to the edge of the window and put my hand on the frame, pulling
myself forward, just wanting to gain enough of an angle where I could
seen the picture hanging above the mantle. Suddenly, there was a knock
on the front door. Two solid knocks. I paused, and had the distinct
feeling that looking inside the house wasn't such a good idea. I turned
and ran back toward the tree-across the open yard-to where my friend
was standing. At the same time I saw a shadow rush out from the door to
the barn, which was closed. At the same time, my friend swears he saw a
farmer in overalls moving quickly from the barn toward the house, with
something like a shovel or axe handle in his hand. By the time I had
made it to my friends location, the apparition had disappeared. He
stood underneath the tree, trying to comprehend what had just happened.
"What the hell did you do?" he asked. I had no answer to his question.
We crept slowly along the edge of the shadows to the road, then walked
home. Something I have learned is to respect the paranormal. And intent
is everything. If we hadn't been sneaking around like we were, perhaps
we would've had a completely different experience. My feeling is that
we stirred something up, and it reacted to us. And, whatever it was, it
wasn't messing around. Instead it appeared to be protecting the
location, ensuring that the property was safe from two people who
hadn't made their intent clear. In all my years of ghost hunting, this
remains one of the strangest and most unsettling experiences I've had,
and it's not one I intend to repeat. Now, I go in with an open mind and
announce my intentions, ensuring that whatever spirits I encounter
don't misconstrue my curiosity for something else.<br>

My Story<br>

my name is amanda and i am 28. i am very fascinated with the paranormal
a but havent had many experiences. although i have a gift where ghosts
come to me in my dreams and dream of the future. my first dream
happened when i was 14yrs old. when i was 14 i had the same reoccuring
dream of bein raped. let alone i didnt know this was gunna happen. when
i was 15 i was date raped and relived every aspect of my reoccuring
dreams. i have alot of deja vu and didnt really think anything of it.
then recently acouple years ago i had another dream. this time a spirit
would appear in my dream almost every night. i imet my husband 2yrs ago
and moved in with him. when i moved in i experienced something i didnt
know i would. i came home and set my purse on the dining room table. as
i turned around my purse flew off the table like someone just knocked
it off the edge pretty hard. my heart raced. then acouple nights later
i started to see this little girl spirit in my dreams in the same house
but was set in an 1800's setting. i then described to my husband that
this little girl in my dreams. she was about 6 or 7. african american
looked like a slave or servent. in my dreams im assuming it was her
mother that would appear with her as well. but when i described her my
husband said ya u were&nbsp; visited by theh little girl spirit that
lives in our home. and she likes to play games and hide things. so
everyday that i was there id get a visit from her every night.&nbsp; 7
years ago i moved to hays kansas. one day i drove by this big beautiful
rundown house that had no address and i was drawn to it. i looked to
see if i could find an owner but couldnt find one til recently. i have
been having dreams about this house for the past 7years. in my dreams i
dream of&nbsp; a family in the 70's. i only get bits and pieces of the
dream tho. but next after i see the family they disappear except for
the man of the house. in him i feel loneliness and watch him commit
suicide by hangin himself upstairs of the house. this reoccuring dream
made me want to know more and wonder why im having the experience. so i
finally got ahold of someone who knew the owners in the house.
apparently the house is haunted and they wont let anyone in. so i asked
her what had happened in the house. but first i told her let me tell u
what im dreaming. so i told her and my dreams of that house are true
and she was astonished. i still dont know what the spirit wants from
me. id like to go and investigate and find out but the owners wont let
me. but i repect their decision. but i still dream the same occurances
of that house but not everyday tho. and it still have my curiosity and
urge to find out.<br>

Burst of Light<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp; kristolspears@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
I was 23 at the time, and had just lost my Father very suddenly. I
started getting panic attacks that were unbearable and quite
freighting. I started seeing a Psychologist, trying to learn how to
cope with this anxiety disorder I had developed. At one of my sessions,
I confided in this Doctor a experience I had. One night I had gone to
bed. I had drawn the blinds and shut the bedroom door. I settled into
bed, laying on my right side. I just couldn't fall asleep. I started
tossing and turning. At one point while I was laying there, I got the
impression that one of my Children had come into the room, and was
standing at the side of the bed. I rolled over on my back and brought
my body up by my elbows. I sat up right for a few seconds, with this
feeling that someone was standing right next to me. That's when this
bright flash of light went off above my head and to the left. I looked
right at it. The light was exactly as if someone three feet away from
you in the dark took a picture of you. It was just like a photography
flash, I even heard this noise that sounded like when you snap a
polaroid camera off. After that flash, the room just went absolutely
silent. Even the atmosphere felt wrong. I jumped up and walked out of
the room and into the kitchen. I was stunned and frightened. I asked my
Doctor, what caused this. I had fears that I was going crazy. The
explanation he gave me really didn't make sense. He believed that when
a person is under extreme stress, the mind will go into a defense mode,
where it will attempt to distract you as a way to alleviate the extreme
emotions you are having. I said so you are saying I am hallucinating?
he said no, your mind is actually working just fine. He told me other
patients under extreme stress or trauma had made claims close to mine.
I asked the Doctor what was he taught in school regarding dealing with
patients that make claims of the paranormal. He said that they are to
take a stand that it does not exists on any level what's so ever. There
is a scientific reason for everything. That was 17 years ago, I have
never had a experience like that again, but when ever I think about
that event, I still find it fascinating. What ever happened that
evening was very real to me. I felt, saw and heard this.<br>

Caryville Wi.<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Now I know this isn't much of a story, but it happened to me and I
thought I would share it with you. Anyone who is familiar with
Paranormal Wisconsin should be familiar with Caryville. Yes, the little
unincorporated village on the outskirts of Eau Claire is home to many a
folklore and paranormal activity. Some of which has happened to me and
my friends personally. So in Caryville, there is a supposedly haunted
schoolhouse, children's cemetery, boat landing, church, bridge and even
a lesser known house in the middle of a corn field. Yes, all this in a
village of like 20-30 people. They are actually quite accenting of one
another, the haunted activity and the size of the town. Anyways, before
I go off on a rant, let me brief you on a couple of the items as
mentioned above. As for the church and schoolhouse, there is rumors
that a boy died in the dead of winter in the schoolhouse, in the seat
he sat in class. Supposedly, if you sit in the exact same seat that he
died in, you'll feel a rush of energy go through your body. And the
church right across the road is rumored to be haunted by a minister who
supposedly hung himself in the bell tower many years ago. As for the
bridge, it is said to be haunted by the phantom car of a prom queen who
drove off the bridge one drunken night. It is said that if you drive
over the bridge on cold winter nights, you'll see the headlights of the
car in the river and hear screams for help. The boat landing is kind of
tied in with that story as well as it is said that the same prom queen,
drowned in the Chippewa river right by the boat landing. Now, no one
knows exactly where this prom queen died that fateful evening, but
recent events have spawned stories of paranormal activity at both
locations. You never can tell, but perhaps the prom queens ghost could
be haunting both spots as it is not uncommon for one ghost to haunt
multiple locations in this area. What I am referring to here is the
ghost of "Blackie" who supposedly watches over the children's spirits
at the children's cemetery and has been rumored to haunt the old
schoolhouse I mentioned earlier. There's also stories about
"Hellhounds" and a crazy mad professor's ghost that haunts the area,
but I won't bore you all with details as I have never experienced
anything in any of these locations. What I am writing about is
something that did happen to me...a couple times. That other stuff is
just my prelude to this story. (I am also very much in the Halloween
spirit right now and my fingers just ran away on the keyboard...sorry.)
But anyhow, I would like to talk about that abandoned farmhouse that is
located in the middle of a grove of trees, a cornfield and is a stone's
throw away from another cemetery. I know, it is hard to picture this
scenery, but I swear it's like that. Only in Wisconsin my friends. Me
and a couple friends were out ghost hunting one night in the Caryville
area and we had heard a few days earlier of an abandoned house just six
miles away from this village, so like all curious lads, we went with
our instincts and decided to pay this house a visit. When we got there,
the first thing I thought of was..."This is so Texas Chainsaw
Massacre." And I say, just think back to the 1970's, cult classic,
directed by Tobe Hooper and think of what that house looks like and you
got what we saw that night. It was almost a replica. But we knew it
wasn't an old movie set...it was a real house that was really
abandoned. So we unsaddled from the minivan we were in and cautiously
approached the house. (The area is also known to have squatters A.K.A.
"Homeless folks" who inhabit abandoned buildings. And we didn't want to
mess with that.) So long story short, my buddy Paul and I went into the
house and the other two guys went into the barn. When Paul and I got
into the kitchen, we stopped to listen for any sounds and we heard 2
loud thumps coming from the upstairs. Yeah, this creeped us out a bit.
But we proceeded on anyways. As we VERY cautiously went upstairs, we
heard the thump again. Forget running away, we were already too close
to finding this thumping noise out. We went on and upon further,
detailed inspection of the upstairs, we found that there was no
possible explanation for the thumping noise. We decided to go find the
others and as we approached the staircase, I personally felt something
goes through my hair, as if someone was running their fingers through
it. And at the same moment, Paul claims to have felt someone or
something tap him on the shoulder. At this, we went in a full on sprint
out of the house, found the other guys and drove off the property with
such vengeance, it would have appeared as if we were in a Tarantino
movie. The second time we visited that property was just a couple short
months later. It was just me and Paul this time around and we decided
to make this trip because the experience we had before gave both of us
a feeling a connection with the spirit world. We decided to explore the
area as before with intentions to let the spirits know we meant no
harm. When we got in the house, we flicked on our flashlights and
noticed what appeared to be blood stains on the wall, and in these
blood stains was written..."Help me." Sure, this freaked us out but
when we got a closer look, we noticed that it was only red paint and
that someone had vandalized this house. That actually kind of angered
us as we knew that people would do this and completely disrespect any
and all spirits that dwelt in this makeshift mansion. As we walked
through the house, we noticed that it wasn't only the kitchen that was
vandalized, but also every one of the 10 rooms in the house. The tub
was filled half-way with the red paint, the upstairs bed was soaked in
it. Someone had blatantly destroyed what was a great place to make
contact with the paranormal realm. Well, needless to say, we
experienced nothing on this trip.&nbsp; Now I know this wasn't much of
a story, but I kind of put a moral in it. Please, if you are a ghost
hunter, do not vandalized or disturb the places you visit. I'm not
saying you'll be cursed or anything, but it is very disrespectful to
the spirits and others who want to honestly experience the paranormal.
I joined the Marine Corps shortly after the last visit to this house,
and upon returning from boot camp, I sadly enough, found out that
authorities had tore the house down due to "vandalism issues." It makes
me cry big clown tears knowing that this had to happen to a place I
felt so compelled to visit and connected to in a way that cannot be
explained by words alone. Sorry I rambled on...but thank you for
reading this. Perhaps, I may write more of my experiences later on. <br>

Ghost in Battle Creek Michigan<br>
<br>
By: heather@tricklingfalls.com<br>
<br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
As a teenager I lived in a multilevel house right on M66 in Battle
Creek, Michigan close to the Pennfield schools.&nbsp; A couple of times
I was walking along the rows of corn in the cornfield just behind my
home when I had a paranormal experience.&nbsp; I was only about four or
five rows back, walking parallel to the back of my house when I saw a
farmer in blue jeans and a red flannel shirt walking towards me in the
row closer to my house.&nbsp; I was too scared to look up to see his
face.&nbsp; There was no sound from his footsteps or his arms hitting
the dried leaves on the cornstalks.&nbsp; I had massive
goosebumps.&nbsp; A couple of weeks later I was walking along the the
corn rows in about the same spot and this time I saw the farmer with a
hound dog.&nbsp; Once again I was too scared to look up.&nbsp; He was
between myself and the safety of my home.&nbsp; I kept my eyes down,
held my breath and hoped he wouldn't say or do anything to me.&nbsp;
The dog never looked my way.&nbsp; They passed silently and my heart
rate slowed back down.&nbsp; My sisters and I loved to play in the
cornfields.&nbsp; Years later one of my sisters admitted she had seen
the farmer.&nbsp; He is probably still walking the fields every fall as
he had in life.&nbsp; Farther back in the fields I had the sensation of
indian presence though I never actually saw or heard anything to back
that up.&nbsp; It was in a small area that wouldn't grow corn in the
middle of acres of very successful corn.&nbsp; Possibly an old fire pit
for a small native american tribe?&nbsp; <br>

Lake County, Illinois (between the Wi/Il border and Chicago)<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; buddapeacecz@aim.com<br>
I grew up in a house where lots of strange things happened, and have
always loved a good ghost story.&nbsp; For many years I was a bartender
and around the Halloween I always asked my bar customers to tell me a
true ghost story, if they had ever experienced anything, etc.....so
over the years I've heard some really great stories...this is one of my
favorites.&nbsp; I won't use the name because I don't have permission,
or contact with the lady who told the story, and her family name would
be well known in the community where it takes place, in Lake County
Illinois, in an affluent Chicago suburb, that is now full of quaint
downtown shops, and big beautiful houses, but once was a farming
community.&nbsp; My client's family bought and moved into a big old
farm house.&nbsp; The first night as she was going to bed, she saw
lights in the closet, little lights.&nbsp; She called her father, who
insisted they were just one of her toys, and he shut the door.&nbsp;
When he left the room, the lights came back, only now outside the
closet.&nbsp; She said for the many years she lived there as long as
the room was dark, the lights would appear.&nbsp; At times she would
say "go in a circle" or "go back and forth"...and they would.....the
shades in the room would all go up at the same time, all kinds of
wierd, bizarre and unnerving things....and for many years she slept
with the lights on to avoid seeing them...and then think that maybe
they had gone away, only to turn the lights off...and the closet lights
would appear again.&nbsp; Her parents would always downplay her
stories, but anyone who used the bathroom next to her room got scared,
was out quick and felt uncomfortable in there....years later, after
they sold and moved her mother told her that after the kids went to
school, she would have to leave, she couldn't stand to be alone
there.&nbsp; So they needed some work done to this house, and when the
contracter went into the basement/crawlspace he inquired about the
newly cemeted area in the dirt floor....(which was right under her
bedroom!)&nbsp; Her dad said he had no clue, he hadn't touched a thing
since moving in....and the contractor assured him, that whoever put the
cemet down there would have had to carry it down, through the low, dark
area, bucket by bucket, no simple task.....the best they could find out
is that a drifter of sorts had moved in as a caretaker to the old lady
who owned the farm.&nbsp; The caretaker and his wife inherited the farm
when the elderly lady died....but the wife had "run off" some time ago,
hadn't been seen or heard from in years....when the property was sold a
woman claiming to be his 'estranged' wife showed up at the closing to
sign the papers.....but no one knew what happened to her, and they were
quite sure the lady at the closing was not who she claimed to be.....so
is the wife buried in the basement?&nbsp; They never found out, no
doubt to keep their property value intact in this very pricey
area...too bad.&nbsp; ---some others ....a man who had a cabin up North
in Wisconsin, who was told by locals that the previous owners were
"devil worshippers".....when they came back on their next trip all the
storm windows were out, inside the cabin, standing on end.&nbsp; .....a
girl who's grandma's house had a male ghost in it...she would always
ask her gram 'who that man is' and her gram would say, just ingnore
him....when her grandma sold the house, she sat down a had a talk with
the ghost, "these are nice people, don't scare them"...and she heard
crying when she left.....a house of Cuba Road in Barrington, very close
to haunted White Cemetary, where the furniture would be re-arranged
when the owners returned....actually I have quite a few Cuba road
stories, and having driven down there at night, it feels like a murky
time warp.&nbsp; ....a friend who often saw black cloaked figures in
the back bedrooms of their house.&nbsp; One night she said she woke and
long, skinny, white hands were over her face...she was so scared, she
shut her eyes thinking they'll be gone when I open them...except when
she opened her eyes the hands were still there....she was visibly
rattled when telling me this, so I believe it....and had heard similar
stories from her brother at different times.........a man driving home
down 41 by the Wisconsin, Illinois border, seeing a woman wandering on
the highway, and freaking out that he can't stop in time to not hit
her...except he drives right through her.....(over the past 10-15 years
a number of women's bodies have been found dumped in this area,
possible serial killer?)<br>

My different Homes<br>
<br>

&nbsp;<br>
Let me start with our old Jennings house in Santa Rosa, CA.&nbsp; We
first moved there in the early 90's and I've come to find out only a
few days ago from my sister that an old woman died in that house.&nbsp;
One night, my dad and sister woke up to what sounded like our rocking
chair rocking back and forth.&nbsp; They got up and went into the
living room where the chair continued to rock.&nbsp; All of a sudden,
the chair stopped rocking and at that point they felt something cold
rush through them.&nbsp; I never experienced anything notable in that
house. Rincon Valley house Our family moved into a much bigger house in
Santa Rosa around the late 90's.&nbsp; Nothing out of the ordinary, but
one night I remember my mom and some friends playing with an Ouija
board, and at that time I didn't know much about those things but had
no desire to use the thing either.&nbsp; After that, nothing much
seemed to happen until a bit later.&nbsp; I was home alone and remember
the garage door opening by itself one day.&nbsp; I also had my stereo
turn itself on while I was at school, that happened a few times.&nbsp;
One time, I fell asleep with a yearbook opened on the floor, next
morning it was closed and I know no one entered my room.&nbsp; I
remember catching something very odd on camera at that house downstairs
by the garage.&nbsp; I don't tend to see anything in that house(except
what I caught in a picture, below), but my sister once saw white
figures floating around her bed, and my brother sees shadow apparitions
there all the time when he's by himself, not to mention doors and
cabinets opening and closing by themselves.&nbsp; I took a picture of
our cat and above his head was what looked like a bright blue orb with
a trail like it streaked by the picture, it was really bright and a
blue color!&nbsp; After I moved out of there, I'd come back and visit
and stay the night, and one night I was sleeping downstairs below my
brothers room which used to be my sisters room before she moved
out.&nbsp; I heard what sounded like two thumps come from his room, but
he wasn't home and my parents were fast asleep in their room at the
other end of the house.&nbsp; More recently, about a few months ago, my
grandparents stayed a few days in our guest room downstairs by the
garage.&nbsp; My grandma was washing dishes at the kitchen sink and a
glass that was sitting on the counter to her left flew up and off the
counter onto the floor and broke.&nbsp; The glass was nowhere near the
edge and she didn't bump it or anything.&nbsp; Another occurrence, my
grandpa uses a breathing apparatus to help him breath while he sleeps,
it has a hose that attaches to the unit and is hard to detach, so it
doesn't pull out in his sleep.&nbsp; Twice, on two seperate nights, the
hose was disconnected from the unit!&nbsp; I plan on going back to that
house when no one else is there.&nbsp; I also need to mention that odd
stuff dissappears in that house, never to be found, like bras for
instance. The Ranch We now own a big piece of land in Napa county with
three houses on it, one of the houses is the oldest one in the
area.&nbsp; In that house, the wife who once lived there shot and
killed her husband while he was sitting on the toilet.&nbsp; You can
see from inside the bathroom the hole that was blown in the door and
how it's aimed right at your head if you sit on the toilet.&nbsp; Many
visitors have reported seeing the apparition of an old man in the other
house across the way, he usually is seen stepping out of the bathroom
and standing at the end of the hall.&nbsp; I have felt him looking at
me one night when I had my back to the hallway and was in that house by
mysself.&nbsp; Visitors have reported hearing footsteps both in that
house and up at the main house when no one else is there.&nbsp; Very
recently, I went there(I tend to visit ever few weeks) and I was there
by myself, and out of the corner of my eye I saw on the front porch the
shadow of a man through the window from within the house, when I turned
my head to look there was nothing there.&nbsp; A week ago, I saw him
again, this time I was watching TV with a friend who usually stays
there, he was in the hallway by the door that seperates the rest of the
house from the back quarters containing the bedrooms and
bathroom.&nbsp; Turned my head to look and he was gone.&nbsp; I went to
bed and turned off this little F8T5 fluurescent light with a rotary
switch, next morning that light was turned on!&nbsp; I still enjoy
going there and even spending the night alone, it only seems to get
freaky when the power goes out and you're alone at night there, other
than that it's very comfortable.&nbsp; Sometimes I do go into the house
where the man was killed at night, haven't seen anything yet but I
might in the future, I'm trying not to fear the spirit world that seems
to coexist with our world. Byron Hot Springs This is an old run down,
abandoned hotel near Brentwood, CA.&nbsp; Me and some friends decided
to visit it a few times in the dead of night(be careful if you visit,
there is no trespassing signs posted).&nbsp; The first run, we hung out
by the main building, looking in through the door, it was a very windy
night.&nbsp; The first thing that happened was a loud metal clang right
in front of us like something metal hit the edge of the bulding, I
shined my flashlight all around and could see nothing that could have
caused that sound!&nbsp; Next, me and my friend had our eyes on the
stairwell going up,and at that moment, a big, faint orb came into view
right in the doorway for the stairs and then faded away, we both saw
it!&nbsp; The second trip back, this time I had a video camera amd we
decided to roam the entire building.&nbsp; My friend pointed out where
he found a cold spot last time, but it wasn't cold at this time.&nbsp;
It's when I got to the third floor that I began to feel uneasy and
uncomfortable, dread and all that.&nbsp; At that point, we decided it
was a good time to leave and so made our way back down through the
building.&nbsp; On the walk down the long, dark driveway I kept getting
this strong feeling of being followed!&nbsp; It lasted until we exited
the gate and back onto the main road.&nbsp; That night and a few nights
after, we both experienced strange occurances at our houses, a glass of
water flew off the counter at his house and here where I currently
live, a jacket draped over a chair seemed to fall to the floor but
there was no wind and the windows were closed and I know I didn't knock
it off, it was draped all the way over the back of the chair where you
had to life it up to get it off.&nbsp; Well, thats all for my stories
and I'm sure I'll have more in the future, I plan on visiting more
known haunted places.<br>

An Old House<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp; cindybgn@yahoo.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
My husband and I bought an old house that needed alot of work. It was
what I called a demolition special. We had been married for only two
years when we bought it and things between us were not great but ok and
I thought we would make it through.&nbsp; I was much more excited about
the house than he was.&nbsp; The very first experience I had in the
house was while I was unpacking.&nbsp; Sun was pouring in all the
windows, and I was excited about ideas and future projects and I was
full of energy and getting things done.&nbsp; I was hanging the clothes
in the walk in closet of our bedroom when I felt something like a
blanket on my back.&nbsp; That is the best I can describe the weight of
it, but it had a feeling, like pure pity.&nbsp; It was as if something
was telling me, "oh, you poor thing."&nbsp; I spoke out loud, like it
was some type of realization, and said, "your kidding, things are not
going to go good here." After a moment I was thinking, what could this
be, my gaurdian angel, a ghost, the former owner ?&nbsp; I thought
maybe he felt bad for us, for the way condition the house was left in,
so I said his name out loud and told him "Back off, I have alot of work
to do." I felt it pull away from me, and just concentrated on stuff I
had to do. I had had experiences before, so I didn't make too big of a
deal of it, and just got on with things. We had begun digging in the
basement to work on the foundation, and one day as I was home alone I
went down there to get some work done. I heard voices upstairs, like a
man and a woman talking, and I remember thinking the woman sounded very
pleasant and happy. I thought maybe they were talk show people and I
left the radio on upstairs and maybe it faded out and just came back in
suddenly, but when I checked it it was unplugged. Another time, I was
sitting in the living room praying the Rosary.&nbsp; I was praying for
my favorite Uncle who was very sick. I was raised catholic, but got
married in a protestant church.&nbsp; While I was praying, I heard a
voice say "What is she doing?".&nbsp; There were only two families that
lived in the house before us, and they both attended our church, this
was an old mostly protestant town, and our church had been around for a
long long time. I figured maybe whoever said it had been protestant,
and didn't know anything about the Rosary. I just shrugged it off. I
was not afraid at all.&nbsp; I just kept on praying. I really felt like
they were just curious about me for some reason, or even cared about
me. It was just a feeling I had. From the time we had moved in my
husband's drinking increased, and his temper grew worse and
worse.&nbsp; He didn't come home directly from work most of the time,
stopping at the bar to drink. So I was home alone alot, still, I felt
like I was not there alone, but in a postive way, again, I was never
scared.&nbsp; One particular day he really flew into a rage, and came
inside the house stomping his boots swearing and yelling and looking
for me. I was in our bedroom closet hanging up clean clothes.&nbsp; At
that point I did not know what he would do if he found me, so I stepped
back and hid behind his hunting outfit. I heard his footsteps lighten
as regained some composure and then he went back outside. It dawned on
me later about the time I had been in the closet and what I call the
"pity blanket" experience, only a year and a half prior.&nbsp; It was
not long after he flew into a rage again, and for the first time put
his hands on me, and I fled the house. I am not one to give up, but it
was time to cut my losses, I was not being treated well. I never went
back except to get some of my things little by little while he was at
work.&nbsp; He kept the house in a terrible state, garbage everywhere,
dirty clothes, blankets, papers, it was awful to see.&nbsp; I&nbsp;
divorced him and he ended up loosing the house we had put so much work
into.When I look back on the experience now I realize how truley sad
the enitre thing was, and how he was on a downward spiral, and would
have taken me down with him.&nbsp; I believe that whatever was in the
closet that day with me was trying to prepare me or warn me. I've had
other ghost kind of experiences in my life, but this one is so personal
and tied in with the events of my life at the time. It seems like when
my life is in some kind of turmoil or changes these kinds of
experiences happen more. I am thankful for the warning, who knows, it
may have saved my life.<br>

Ghostly Bed Partner<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp; lyndabooneclerk@windstream.net<br>
<br>
Being the baby of four older siblings, I had a bedroom all to myself at
age 17.&nbsp; Around 4:00 or 5:00 a.m., I heard one of my parents
walking through the living room and then he or she shut my bedroom door
to not wake me with their early morning ramblings.&nbsp; As I tried to
go back to sleep, I felt hands go around my waist from behind.&nbsp; I
tried to move closer to the edge of the bed and the encircling became
tighter and tighter.&nbsp; I began to yell for my mother, which is hard
to do when you&#8217;re scared to death and can&#8217;t find your voice.&nbsp; I
then heard a deep gravelly voice right behind my ear say, &#8220;I&#8217;m not your
mother.&#8221;&nbsp; Then the sensation went away.&nbsp; When I finally got
the nerve to move and look behind me, I noticed that I was far away
from the wall on the left that met with the left side of the bed and
that no covers were wrapped around me that could have made me feel the
hugging sensation around my waist.&nbsp; I never experienced anything
like that again in my house, but other family members have experienced
ghosts in it.&nbsp; My parents built the house and it was only 27 or so
years old at the time.<br>

Haunted BC Part I<br>
<br>

<br>
I grew up in a tract home in Boulder City, Nevada. On a supernatural
level, B.C. is perhaps best known for the paranormal activity that goes
on at the historical Boulder Dam Hotel. I cannot refute or substantiate
those claims. I can only use this forum to relate several experiences
from my childhood home, which my parents still own and live in to this
day.My parents bought the house in the mid 1970&#8217;s. I was a year old
when we moved in, and my sister was born two years later. The house was
brand new, with no former occupants. One of the first incidents
occurred while my mom was pregnant. She felt an invisible foot trip her
in the hallway, forcing her to land flat on her belly. Worried, she
went to the hospital, but thankfully, the baby was fine. The activity
increased after my sister came home from the hospital. Within a few
months, my mother began to witness shadows in the hallway. On one
occasion, the dark form of a man &#8220;in a cloak with a wide-brimmed hat&#8221;
floated across the hallway and into my sister&#8217;s room. My mom said she
sensed a feeling of &#8220;dread and evil&#8221; from this thing. But, maternal
instincts won out over fear, and she rushed into the room to collect my
sister. The shadowy figure was not there when she opened the door. The
activity seemed to grow exponentially as we grew older. However, they
still seemed focused on my sister. Like most children, she would beg my
parents to stay up late at night. However, her reasons were probably
much different than most. She would hear conversations at night from
the ceiling. The voices were not distinct, in that she could never make
out actual words. But, she said they consisted of a man and a woman,
and often times she felt as if they were laughing at her or
intimidating her. My sister became so frightened of the voices, she
refused to open her eyes or get up out of bed to use the bathroom. This
went on for several years.One night, the family sat down at the dinner
table. My mom told my sister to &#8220;hurry and wash up,&#8221; as dinner was
ready. She was gone a minute or two, when we were suddenly startled by
a blood-curdling scream. The family rushed to the bathroom door, and my
father banged on it. &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; he asked, trying to stay calm.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a man in here! Oh my God, Daddy! There&#8217;s a man in here!&#8221; My
sister&#8217;s voice shook with fear. My dad asked her to unlock the door,
but she kept screaming she couldn&#8217;t and to please help her from &#8220;the
man in here!&#8221; My father was unable to open the door. This continued for
several minutes, until we finally called the fire department. My
parents continued to try and comfort my sister as the firemen worked
the lock. Unable to unlock the door, they finally kicked it in. We
found my sister curled up next to the toilet, sobbing uncontrollably.
When asked later about &#8220;The Man,&#8221; my sister was unable to recall any
specific details.&nbsp; Several years later, we had the garage
converted into a family den. The garage had large mirrors installed
that reflected out into the hallway. Each night, I would pretend to go
to bed, only later reemerging to watch late night television. This was
when the &#8220;Hallway Walker&#8221; first appeared. I would sneak out of my room
on school nights, and sit in the den with the TV on low, so as not to
wake my parents. After a few minutes, the activity would start. I would
notice a grey form walk past the entrance to the den. It was always the
same: very fast, and from left to right. This would startle me, not for
fear of the supernatural, but the very real wrath I risked if my
parents caught me up past bedtime. I would quickly turn the television
off, and venture out into the hallway to offer an explanation for my
nocturnal activities. Each time, no one was there. After a week of
this, I realized the Hallway Walker had to be an apparition, as I
simply couldn&#8217;t explain the sightings any other way. It would happen
every night, especially during the summer time when curfew was relaxed.
On some nights, she appeared as often as a half dozen times or more. At
first, it frightened me a great deal. But, it occurred so often, I
honestly grew (somewhat) accustomed to the sightings. It was like she
was trying to get my attention or communicate through fast movement.
Some nights I would pretend to watch TV, just waiting for her to
appear. As soon as she &#8220;walked&#8221; by, I quickly turned my head, desperate
to catch a full view. I could never manage it. The thing was too quick.
Months went by where I continued to engage in this nightly ritual. I
refer to the apparition as female, although I can offer no real
explanation. It was just something I sensed, coupled with the general
form I gathered from my peripheral vision. One night, our strange game
took a different twist. She walked by the doorway several times, and I
completely ignored her. By this time, I was actually talking to her,
going out into the hallway, and telling her things like &#8220;I can see you&#8221;
or &#8220;How are you tonight?&#8221; But, I decided upon a different strategy. I
made no head movements or gestures of recognition after several passes
down the hallway. This either intrigued or annoyed her, because I
suddenly noticed a face staring at me from the right side of the
doorway. It was grey and formless, like the body, so I knew it was her.
I quickly turned to look, but it was gone. From then on, the Hallway
Walker mixed it up, going from quick passes down the hall, to poking
her head out from the side of the door.&nbsp; My uncle came to stay
with us for a few weeks during the Hallway Walker&#8217;s tenure. He actually
stayed on a couch in the den. One morning, I came out into the kitchen.
My uncle was there making coffee, and looked like he hadn&#8217;t slept a
wink. I asked him what was wrong. He whispered, &#8220;I know you&#8217;re going to
think this is crazy. But, I swear I keep seeing someone walking down
the hallway at night.&#8221; I told him I see it all the time, and we both
just sat there at the kitchen table in silence. In one way, I was
relieved to hear him say it. Even though the apparition was real to me,
I never once dismissed the possibility it may have all been a trick of
the eyes, or worse, a figment of the imagination. But, to have someone
validate what I had seen every night for almost two years was extremely
gratifying.&nbsp; The Hallway Walker has since moved on, hopefully to a
better place. I sometimes house sit for my parents and watch their
dogs, and I have not seen her in many years. In a weird way, I actually
miss her, although as playful as we got with each other over the course
of a few years, it was always a little unsettling. Thank you,
Shadowlands, for giving me a forum in which to retell these incidents.
I have more stories I will recount in Haunted BC Part II<br>

East Haddam Wedding Ghost<br>
<br>
By: smarott@yahoo.com<br>

Hi, my name is Sylvia and I would like to share a story of a house I
believe to be haunted. My sister is getting married on september 5th so
she rented an estate to live at for a week where we are holding the
wedding at as well. During the course of the entire week here most of
the family has had quite a bit of experiences. It all started off when
I was outside a few days ago putting together some wedding decorations
when I stopped and leaned back in my chair and had to do a double take
at the balcony above me as I saw someone standing there looking at me
but when I looked back she was not there. I saw the woman clear as day
though and told my sister in law what I saw. I had seen a woman in a
white victorian style dress with lace all over it, she had light
brownish hair up in a bun and wore a white hat with a white flower on
it and was looking down over the balcony at me. She had the look of
sadness in her face as well and she looked to be in her 20's to me and
was very pretty. Upon telling that to my sister in law she told me she
was sleeping on the third floor one night and she felt someone
constantly tapping her to wake her up and when she woke up there was no
one there. This occurred on day one of being here. On day two, my
grandmother in law was telling me that when she got up one morning she
saw someone in her room and they looked like they were painting and
standing next to that person was a woman in a white lace dress but she
could not see what her face looked like. This was shocking news to me
since she did not know I had also seen the lady in the white dress and
she pretty much brought proof to my claim as well. later on that night
I was telling my sister in law what my grandma seen when we heard a
loud splash coming out of the lake (I believe its called Bastion Lake)
followed by an audible woman's voice but we could not make out what she
was saying. It was pretty dark out but the lights from the house
reflected enough on the lake for us to know if someone is swimming or
not however we did not see anyone. Later on that night some of my
family were out on the porch talking when they heard the sound of
laughter coming from behind the shed and upon inspecting nobody was
there. Since they could not explain what made that noise they all went
inside and were a little freaked out by it. That same night at about
3am I was in my room when I heard the sound of moving furniture coming
from directly above me. I mentioned something the next day to my
grandma and later on that night my mother in law decided not to sleep
here since she also heard the sound of moving furniture and said it
came from my parents' room. We asked my parents if they moved any
furniture around and they did <br>
not do anything. (which I believe because my dad hobbles around on a
cane and is quite weak to move things around and my mom cannot really
move things by herself either) On day three I refused to sleep alone
because when I was in my room and on the cell phone with my boyfriend I
was looking at the dining room window and saw an invisible force pull
the curtains in front of me open. Not only did I freak out and gt
hysterical at that but it also did not help that the cell phone I was
on died which I found to be odd since it was fully charged. My little
sister belittled the whole ghost experience and figured it to be a
bunch of bull and even talked it down until she had an experience of
her own. When she was out at the lake with my other sister, she claimed
that someone or something hit her in the back of her head really hard.
This is all the experiences we have had so far that I thought I would
share with you. We have been intrigued enough to ask the owner of the
estate if the place is haunted and we are also going to look up
historical records on the house as well and we will let you know how
that goes. Thanks for reading my story Today is the wedding day and if
anything else happens then I will send you an email to update
you.&nbsp; Thanks for letting me know when it will show up in your
stories section. I also would like to update you on some further
occurences that happened within the house. On the day of the wedding
nobody was allowed within the house since we did not want people
walking in and out of the estate we were renting however, one of my
dad's friends went in the house anyways because he had to use the
bathroom. When he came back out he was frightened by the house and told
us when he went to open the bathroom door after he was finished
relieving himself the knob turned and the door opened itself. This
frightened him and he ran out of the house as quickly as he could. He
was not aware that we also had experiences within the house and we told
him our stories after he told us his. Later on that night the DJ was
playing slow music (the reception was on the same property and was also
outside) and for some reason the music just randomly changed from a
slow romantic song to a fast song followed by some of his equipment
malfunctioning. According to the DJ he has never had that happen
before. Later on that night my grandmother in law heard scratching
noises in her room that sounded like it came from one floor above. At
about the same time she heard that I was upstairs on my dad's cell
phone in his room talking to my boyfriend and charging the cell at the
same time when I heard something hit the door leading to the room next
to my parents room. I then became quiet on the phone and heard someone
in the next room walking around and once again something hit the door
harder than the first time which freaked me out. I called for someone
to come up here and my brother in law and his friend came up and
checked the room I heard the noises coming from and nobody was there.
Multiple people (including me) also heard doors slamming shut randomly
throughout the night as well. The windows were not open and there was
no breezes to cause the doors to slam themselves shut. Finally one of
my brother in law's friends claims he heard my brother in law outside
of his room at about 3am talking to someone else however my brother in
law was not anywhere around when he went to check who he was talking to
in the hallway. These were the rest of the experiences we had within
the house. Upon asking the owner she seemed to avoid answering the
question directly and was not too happy when we told her we are going
to go to look up the records on the house she was not too happy hearing
this. Our guess is maybe she does not want people to know that her
house is haunted otherwise she would lose potential clients that would
want to rent the house or something. I tried looking up online to see
if others had experiences within that house but did not find anything.
The only thing we can do is check up historical records and talk to the
next person renting and living within the house. Thanks for taking the
time and reading my story :)<br>
