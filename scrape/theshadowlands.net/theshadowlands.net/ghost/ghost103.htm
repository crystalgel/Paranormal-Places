<P><B> </B>
<P><B>Throughout my life I've had some unusual things happen to me. And </B>
<P><B>usually it had to do with people who have passed on (like the "Last
</B>
<P><B>Goodbye".) Except in this case. I never thought that I would have </B>
<P><B>premonitions because, although a couple of other family members have
the </B>
<P><B>ability, I didn't think that I did. </B>
<P><B>About 2-3 years ago on a Sunday, my fiancee (I'll call him 'J')and
I drove to </B>
<P><B>the Bank of Hawaii at the Ala Moana Shopping Center because he needed
some cash. </B>
<P><B>Since it was the middle of the day on a weekend, there was almost no
one else </B>
<P><B>there except one other guy at the first ATM. I watched 'J' walk towards
the 2nd </B>
<P><B>ATM as another car (a Toyota, I think)pulled in to a stall three spaces
away </B>
<P><B>from us. About a minute behind him was another car, an older model
American car </B>
<P><B>and he parked next to us on the left. The first guy left and was replaced
by the </B>
<P><B>Toyota owner at the ATM. The guy on the left looked like he was looking
for his </B>
<P><B>wallet on the passenger seat when I noticed that 'J' was finishing
up. As I </B>
<P><B>watched 'J', I felt the blood suddenly drain away from my face. I shuddered
and </B>
<P><B>felt this overwhelming need to LEAVE THE AREA! As those three words
boomed </B>
<P><B>through my head, I saw 'J' starting to walk back to the car. I got
more and more </B>
<P><B>antsy as I wished that he would hurry up. At the same time, my vision
seemed to </B>
<P><B>have clouded over until all I could see was just a pinpoint. As he
opened the </B>
<P><B>door and I told him "Get in! We need to leave NOW!" As he jumped in,
he asked </B>
<P><B>why . I said through clenched teeth (out of pure fear and not anger),
"DON'T </B>
<P><B>question ME! Just get us OUT of HERE!" And that he did! As we tore
out of the </B>
<P><B>area, my vision cleared and I felt such a sense of relief! And a little
foolish! </B>
<P><B>'J' turned to me and and ask what the hell was that was all about.
I told him </B>
<P><B>that I was as baffled as he was. He said that my face had been white
and that I </B>
<P><B>had a glazed look. He said that he had gotten scared when he saw my
face. We </B>
<P><B>kinda laughed about it and promptly forgot about it. Until Tuesday.
</B>
<P><B>'J', who works for the same bank but at a different branch, called
me and </B>
<P><B>said "Hon, you are not going to believe this. Guess what I just found
out? </B>
<P><B>Remember on Sunday, when you freaked out for no reason?". I said "Yeah."
He then </B>
<P><B>proceeded to tell me that the second guy that was standing next to
him at the </B>
<P><B>ATM was held up at gunpoint right after we left! I was shocked! After
he gave me </B>
<P><B>a description, I realized the gunman was in the car that was to the
left of us! </B>
<P><B>He asked me if I knew because I saw the guy with a gun. I told him
'no' and that </B>
<P><B>the guy looked normal. Nothing spooky or mean about him. The only thing
that I </B>
<P><B>noticed about him was that he had rummaged around his passenger seat
like 'J' </B>
<P><B>would do when he was looking around for his wallet ('J' sometimes takes
out his </B>
<P><B>wallet and puts it on his passenger seat with other stuff so that he
has to </B>
<P><B>rummage for his wallet whenever he gets to his destination.).'J' asked
if I was </B>
<P><B>sure and I said 'yes'. If I had known that the guy next to us had a
gun, I would </B>
<P><B>have said so. I had only glanced at him. I couldn't really see into
his car, </B>
<P><B>anyway, because I had been on the passenger side so all I could see
was about </B>
<P><B>chest up. </B>
<P><B>I wondered later if the gunman was actually going to hold us up first.
</B>
<P><B>Usually people park/sit away from others if there is a lot of space
like in </B>
<P><B>theaters, resturant and parking lots. He had parked right next to us
in a nearly </B>
<P><B>empty parking lot (it was only us and the Toyota). That might not have
ment much </B>
<P><B>if we had been parked in the first row where the ATMs were, but we
parked sorta </B>
<P><B>in the middle of the lot . Thanks to my premonition, we never got to
find out! </B>

<P><B>Vacation House</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: felix@sssnet.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>My name is Danielle. My family and I rented a house in South Carolina</B>
<P><B>for a weeks vacation and we believe that it was haunted. First of all
we</B>
<P><B>thought it was strange that the house was so much cheaper than other</B>
<P><B>houses in the same area, especially in tourist season. Not being able
to</B>
<P><B>pass up a good deal we rented it. About the third day we were there
my</B>
<P><B>mother was awaken by the sound of cans crashing against the cupboards</B>
<P><B>downstairs, we had bags of aluminum cans out because you have to
recycle</B>
<P><B>there, they were being shaken and tossed about the room. My father</B>
<P><B>jumped out of bed, ran downstairs and everything was in its place.</B>
<P><B>Nothing looked as if it had been touched, So he returned to bed. Then</B>
<P><B>about an hour later both my parents heard the large and heavy curtain</B>
<P><B>that was hung across the downstairs front door sliding back and forth</B>
<P><B>continually. Once again he got out of bed and looked over the
upstairs</B>
<P><B>balcony down onto the  living room. There was nobody down there and
the</B>
<P><B>curtain was closed. My father went back to sleep and a little while</B>
<P><B>later my mother, still wide awake, was in a cold sweat as she heard</B>
<P><B>heavy footsteps ascending the stairs then turn to walk down the
 balcony</B>
<P><B>towards her room she awaited the sight of whatever was coming but</B>
<P><B>nothing ever passed her door. Later that night there was a wild</B>
<P><B>scratching coming from the closet in my parents room. My dad
practically</B>
<P><B>flew out of bed threw open the door and it stopped. It had appeared
to</B>
<P><B>originate from the trap door that leads to the attic which is located
in</B>
<P><B>the closet. The last occurrence happened to be the only one I heard.</B>
<P><B>Something hit the shower curtain, in the bathroom that adjoins my</B>
<P><B>parents room and mine, then scratched in the tub, and slammed the</B>
<P><B>cabinet doors. I was awaken by this and thought my mother was is the</B>
<P><B>bathroom so I called out her name, there was no answer so I figured</B>
<P><B>that, as mothers often do, she was ignoring me and I went back to
sleep.</B>
<P><B>For the rest of the week my parents left all the lights on downstairs</B>
<P><B>and there were no more happenings. They did not tell my sister and
I</B>
<P><B>what happened until we were pulling out of the drive to go home
because</B>
<P><B>they were afraid that we would be frightened.</B>
<P><B>    When we had our pictures developed two of them came out with some</B>
<P><B>odd features. The one has a white blur in it which when looked at
closer</B>
<P><B>you can see little waves and to the right of the object is a black</B>
<P><B>darker smear. The other is a little white squiggle. Years later I
went</B>
<P><B>to a psychic who read pictures and she told me that they were
spirits,</B>
<P><B>without me saying a word about what I felt they were. She informed
me</B>
<P><B>that it was a very old spirit and that it was an indian. She said if
the</B>
<P><B>one squiggle would have further developed it would have been a
feather.</B>
<P><B>Well that is my story.</B>

<P><B>Son's Ghostly Experience</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: lwph@gateway.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>In the spring of 1988, my family and I were </B>
<P><B>renting a rather dilapidated house in a bad part of Oakland, CA that
had to be </B>
<P><B>fixed up before we could move in.Shortly after we did, we gave a party
for one of </B>
<P><B>our daughter's nurses who was leaving. Everyone was pretty much
congregating in </B>
<P><B>the kitchen around the refreshments when my son walked in from the
back of the </B>
<P><B>house looking scared and confused.When I asked him what the matter
was he said </B>
<P><B>that there was a man in my bedroom who had held up a finger to his
mouth and </B>
<P><B>motioned him to shush. Patrick, who was only 6 years old at the time,
</B>
<P><B>pretended he was playing with a toy on his sister's bed for a few minutes
before </B>
<P><B>he nonchalantly got up and came into the kitchen to tell me.</B>
<P><B>He described in detail what the man looked like </B>
<P><B>and what he was wearing before my friends went in the back cautiously
to see if </B>
<P><B>he was there.Other than my door being open when I kept it </B>
<P><B>closed, there was no sign that anyone had been there. And there was
no way that </B>
<P><B>he could have escaped had he been human because my windows were so
small, even </B>
<P><B>my children couldn't get through them. The only way out was through
the </B>
<P><B>kitchen door of the room we were congregated in and he definitely didn't
</B>
<P><B>come that way!Two months later we were packing to move when my </B>
<P><B>son came running upstairs from the basement where he was helping his
dad to pack </B>
<P><B>with an old photo album in his hands and a picture of the man he says
he saw at </B>
<P><B>our party.This is the one and only time our family has had </B>
<P><B>an experience with the supernatural ...that we know </B>
<P><B>of!</B>
<P>
<P><B>Nothing There??</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: COPELACR2@MS.NDCORP.COM</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>  I have lived my house 12 years now. I bought it new in a new
subdivision</B>
<P><B>in </B>
<P><B>Powder Springs Georgia, right outside of Atlanta. About a year ago
I started</B>
<P><B>feeling that something was present in my house (just a feeling). </B>
<P><B> I have two ferrets that I keep in my room, and I have a piece of
plywood</B>
<P><B>about</B>
<P><B>3 feet high resting in front of the bedroom doorway so that they cannot
get</B>
<P><B>out.</B>
<P><B>  At 2am (on the dot) one morning I heard a loud bang and then another,
it</B>
<P><B>sounded as if someone was at my front door banging on it. Then it did
it</B>
<P><B>again, this time it sounded like the plywood at my bedroom door was
slapping</B>
<P><B>against the door jam. I was lying on my stomach, and was afraid to
turn</B>
<P><B>over.</B>
<P><B>Then I started feeling pressure on my  back like something or someone
was</B>
<P><B>pushing on me holding me down. I said "who is there". No answer. I
again</B>
<P><B>said "who is there", I could hardly get the words out I was so scared.
Again</B>
<P><B>no answer. I finally got the nerve to turn over. I did so very
quickly.</B>
<P><B>There was</B>
<P><B>nothing there. I got up to see if my ferrets had made the noise, but
it was</B>
<P><B>not them</B>
<P><B>because they were fast asleep.</B>
<P><B>  Ever since then for some reason I awake at 2am. I just wake up. It
does</B>
<P><B>not happen</B>
<P><B>every night, but often. The area I live in is close to Kennesaw
Battlefield</B>
<P><B>a famous</B>
<P><B>battle during the Civil War. I can only think that my neighborhood
might</B>
<P><B>have been</B>
<P><B>built upon one of the sites where a skirmish or battle took place.
Just a</B>
<P><B>guess.</B>
<P><B>Maybe there is a Civil War ghost hanging around.</B>
<P><B>I am in the process of moving now. If this follows me I will let you
know.</B>

<P><B>'My Unknown Aunt'</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: milhoan@email.msn.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>It all started when I was about nine years old.  One night I wasn't
tired at</B>
<P><B>all and I had a feeling that I was being watched.  At that time I was
laying</B>
<P><B>in bed facing the wall.  I turned over and looked out into the hallway
(I</B>
<P><B>never slept with the door closed because I was scared) and saw a
little</B>
<P><B>person about two feet tall dressed in black with red glowing eyes.
 He</B>
<P><B>turned and looked at me, grinned, and proceeded down the hallway and
into my</B>
<P><B>brothers room.  I then heard him scream, but I was too terrified to
move. My</B>
<P><B>parents quickly ran to his room and found nothing. We talked about
it and</B>
<P><B>came to the conclusion that it was not our imagination, for we saw
the same</B>
<P><B>exact thing.</B>
<P><B>    The house had been constructed sometime before 1910. It had been
burnt</B>
<P><B>down by a fire that started in the attic.  Then rebuilt. The house
was old</B>
<P><B>and rotten so we decided that there was no reason to restore it because
of</B>
<P><B>it's condition.  That was when the strange things bagan to occur
constantly.</B>
<P><B>    Almost every day I would see a woman standing in the windows(this
was</B>
<P><B>after we moved into a new house right beside our old one) It looke
as if she</B>
<P><B>had just otten in a bad fight and lost. She was wearing a dark green
dress.</B>
<P><B>It looked old and it was torn. But still It wasn't a dress you would
wear</B>
<P><B>around the house.</B>
<P><B>    One day me and two of my friends were hiking in the woods behind
my</B>
<P><B>house, when we heard the sound of someone digging with a shovel. We
followed</B>
<P><B>the sound and saw two men digging, while the girl I had always seen
in the</B>
<P><B>old house was tied to a tree on her knees crying. The girl turned toward
us</B>
<P><B>and simply said,"1980". The two men looked over at her and they all</B>
<P><B>vanished. I went home and told my mom, and she said it was just my</B>
<P><B>imagination. I left it at that and figured-three people's
'imaginations</B>
<P><B>couldn't be exactly the same.</B>
<P><B>    For about a year I hadn't seen the girl, or any other ghost for
that</B>
<P><B>matter. But one day I was looking through my mom's highschool yearbook
and</B>
<P><B>there in the eleventh grade was the girl. I looked up her name in the</B>
<P><B>signitures in the front of the yearbook, and sure enough there was
her</B>
<P><B>signiture, it said something about her wedding, and 'best friends
wink</B>
<P><B>wink'. I confronted my mother about it ,and she spoke in a tone of
voice</B>
<P><B>that I'd never heard before, but all she said was,"That was a long
time ago,</B>
<P><B>I told you it was your imagination!Don't bother me with this
anymore!".That</B>
<P><B>proved to me that that she knew that I was telling the truth the whole
time.</B>
<P><B>    I started seeing the girl again and decided that I should talk
to my</B>
<P><B>grandmother  and she gave me a wierd looking key and said, "The truth
 is in</B>
<P><B>the attic, don't look until I'm gone". A couple of weeks later she
passed</B>
<P><B>away. I looked in the attic about a month later after I was a little
less</B>
<P><B>shook up. I searched the whole attic and found nothing. But when I
moved one</B>
<P><B>of the china cabinets, there was a door. I opened the door. There was
a</B>
<P><B>child's room, it was perfectly clean and organized. There was a row
of dolls</B>
<P><B>on a shelf, a dresser full of clothes, and a pink lacy bed, all made
up.</B>
<P><B>There was a night stand with a small lamp, and a dresser full of
clothes.</B>
<P><B>there was also a closet.  I opened the closet door and a gust of cold
wind</B>
<P><B>came out.there were a couple of dreeses hanging in a pole, and a trunk
on</B>
<P><B>the floor.  It had a lock an it, so I quickly pulled the key out of
my</B>
<P><B>pocket and unlocked the lock.  Inside were a pile of papers, a photo
album,</B>
<P><B>and two pairs of baby shoes. I dragged the trunk down stairs, and looked
at</B>
<P><B>the papers. They were adoption papers and a birth cirtificate.  The
name was</B>
<P><B>the same first and middle name of the girl in the yearbook!I looked
through</B>
<P><B>the photo album and saw pictures of two little girls about four years
old in</B>
<P><B>te room in the attic! I quickly drove to my mothers house and demanded
that</B>
<P><B>she explain it! It turns out that my mother had a twin sister that
her</B>
<P><B>mother had put up for adoption, she died the summer after graduation.
It</B>
<P><B>seems her boyfriend killed her because she backed out of their wedding.
 My</B>
<P><B>mother said that she had seen her ghost too but didn't want me to
know</B>
<P><B>because she didn't think I was ready.</B>

<P><B>The Lake</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: william.bain@sympatico.ca</B>
<P>
<P><B>Several years ago, I was visiting a friend at his summer home. His</B>
<P><B>grandparents owned a beautiful house that looked out onto the lake
and</B>
<P><B>since they were away for a few weeks, we had the place all to
ourselves.</B>
<P><B>We decided to take his grandfather's boat out for a spin and take a
tour</B>
<P><B>of the lake one afternoon. The weather was pleasant enough, but being</B>
<P><B>early spring, it wasn't too warm. The lake itself is huge and dotted</B>
<P><B>with several small islands that people have their cottages</B>
<P><B>on.......places for the rich to retreat to on the weekends. After</B>
<P><B>untying the boat, I remember reaching into the water to pull the rope</B>
<P><B>out......the water was so cold it hurt! It would be at least another</B>
<P><B>month until swimming season my friend explained as he fired up the</B>
<P><B>engine and guided the boat away from the dock. We cruised around the</B>
<P><B>lake for about half an hour when we decided to go dock at the public</B>
<P><B>boat launching area. After we grabbed a bite to eat, we decided to</B>
<P><B>cruise around the other end of the lake before going home. Here is
where</B>
<P><B>things get a little strange. We were hugging the shoreline moving
fairly</B>
<P><B>slow.......my friend pointing out various things of interest. Ahead
to</B>
<P><B>our right was a patch of what is called "sea grass"...it looks just
like</B>
<P><B>tall blades of grass jutting out of the water. Beyond the weeds I
could</B>
<P><B>see what appeared to be someone standing in the water.I turned to
Andrew</B>
<P><B>and asked if he could see the same thing I saw. He replied that he
did</B>
<P><B>indeed see whoever it was. At first I thought it was someone</B>
<P><B>fishing....out in the water with those hip waders on. As we cleared
the</B>
<P><B>weeds however, we saw it was a girl.........wearing a bathing suit.
My</B>
<P><B>god, I thought to myself......how the hell can she be in the water
when</B>
<P><B>it's so cold? What was so unsettling was that she stood stone still
and</B>
<P><B>stared at the two of us with this strange smile on her face. Andrew
and</B>
<P><B>I both called out to her, but she didn't say anything or move. Just</B>
<P><B>stood there grinning at us. I asked Andrew if he thought she was a</B>
<P><B>mannequin (????weird I know but you HAD to be there)  But as we
slowly</B>
<P><B>passed by.......she turned her head to continue staring at us. Andrew</B>
<P><B>called out to her again, but still no reply. As he tried to get the
girl</B>
<P><B>to reply I noticed that unlike most of the cottages on the lake, the
one</B>
<P><B>on the nearby shoreline was sort of run down and empty looking.
Andrew</B>
<P><B>then poked me in the ribs and pointed.....the girl was wading out
into</B>
<P><B>the deeper water until she went under. Thinking that she was in
trouble</B>
<P><B>we edged the boat closer to where she'd been a second ago. Without</B>
<P><B>warning, she emerged just to the right of the boats among the weeds.
Now</B>
<P><B>her back was turned to us, and I called out to her again. This time
she</B>
<P><B>seemed to be going to answer because she turned towards us. Andrew
and I</B>
<P><B>both gasped when we saw that where her eyes had been there was now
just</B>
<P><B>two dark holes. Part of her cheek was torn away revealing her teeth;
her</B>
<P><B>hair was entangled with weeds and mud. I leaned over and was
violently</B>
<P><B>sick.......we were looking at a corpse that looked like it had been
at</B>
<P><B>the bottom of the lake for years. Andrew slammed the throttle and we</B>
<P><B>took off . As we hauled ass out of there, I looked behind us and saw</B>
<P><B>that the apparation was slowly sinking beneath the waves. We didn't</B>
<P><B>speak a word the whole way home; when we got back we opened a bottle
of</B>
<P><B>Jack Daniels and tried to drink the ghastly image out of our minds.
The</B>
<P><B>next day after the hangovers had worn off, we both sat talking about</B>
<P><B>what we saw and trying to come up with a reasonable explanation. We</B>
<P><B>decided to drive to the run down cottage and find out if maybe
someone</B>
<P><B>did in fact live there.......perhaps they could tell us something.</B>
<P><B>However, the place was indeed abandoned........by the looks of it for</B>
<P><B>quite awhile. There was a weather beaten for sale sign on the remains
of</B>
<P><B>a wooden fence.....but who would want to buy a beat up shack like
that</B>
<P><B>I'll never know. Suddenly, an old man appeared from the road and</B>
<P><B>demanded to know what the hell we were doing there. We told him we
were</B>
<P><B>just seeing if anyone lived there. He frowned at us and said the
place</B>
<P><B>had been empty for the past seven years. Andrew asked him who used
to</B>
<P><B>live in the old cottage.The old guy told us a family used to own</B>
<P><B>it......came up every summer they did until one of the daughters
drowned</B>
<P><B>in a boating accident. Seems she was out in a canoe by herself and</B>
<P><B>somehow fell into the water. The poor girl wasn't wearing a
lifejacket</B>
<P><B>and drowned. The most tragic thing about it was that they couldn't</B>
<P><B>recover the body...........the lake is just too deep out that ways.
We</B>
<P><B>went to the town's small library and looked at the old newspapers on</B>
<P><B>microfilm. There was a small article dated back to July of 1985, and</B>
<P><B>next to it a picture of the same girl we'd seen in the lake. This may</B>
<P><B>seem very far fetched and hard to believe and I don't blame anyone
for</B>
<P><B>being skeptical, but I remember it in my worst nightmares. My friend</B>
<P><B>Andrew still talks about it and everytime I see him it comes up in</B>
<P><B>conversation. He told me he'll never go out on that lake again and
he</B>
<P><B>was glad when his grandparents sold their summer home.</B>

<P><B>Everyday People</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: garell@interactive.net</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>When I was 5yrs old which would be about 1972,  my family and I lived
in a</B>
<P><B>house in which the main part of was built in the 1800's.  I remember
waking</B>
<P><B>up out of a sound sleep one night and everything in my room had a
strange</B>
<P><B>look to it.  To this day I cant really explain the look, but lets just
say</B>
<P><B>everythhing looked lighter than it really was, not exactly in color
but</B>
<P><B>also in weight.   I had a large closet  and the doors had been left
open</B>
<P><B>and a I looked around the room thinking that it looked different, I
noticed</B>
<P><B>that all of the clothes in my closet were very slowly swaying back
and</B>
<P><B>forth.  Well, I got very scared as I guess anyone would have,and I
got out</B>
<P><B>of bed to go to my parents room.  I seemed to not be able to go very
fast</B>
<P><B>even though I was in a hurry.  Now, to get to my parents room I had
to walk</B>
<P><B>down a hall which my room was at one end and my parents room was at
the</B>
<P><B>other and in between the two rooms in the middle of the hall on the
right</B>
<P><B>was the entrance to the kitchen.  As I walked by I noticed different</B>
<P><B>figures floating through the air.  I dont know what possessed me to
stop,</B>
<P><B>but I did and I stood there for atleast a minute as the figures
slowly</B>
<P><B>floated across the kitchen toward me.  They moved slow just like the</B>
<P><B>clothes in the closet.  They were people that seemed somewhat
transparent</B>
<P><B>but they were only about 2ft in lengh and they floated sort of at the
in</B>
<P><B>between point of the ceiling and the floor, but closer to the ceiling.
</B>
<P><B>There were four figures, and they floated in pairs.  The first pair,
was a</B>
<P><B>lady and a man.  The lady had on a beautiful dress that almost
sparkled,</B>
<P><B>and it was the kind that flared out from the hips and went down to
the</B>
<P><B>floor and she carried one of those pretty umberellas,  The man had
on a</B>
<P><B>suite and a top hat and he had a cane in his hand.   Four or five ft
away</B>
<P><B>was the other pair, also a man and a woman.  They looked like every
day</B>
<P><B>people.  The man had on a button up shirt that looked like a flannel
or a</B>
<P><B>work shirt and what looked like a pair of jeans.  He was next to a
woman</B>
<P><B>who was pushing an older style baby carriage.  She was wearing an every
day</B>
<P><B>house dress.  Both pairs looked like they were out taking a walk.
 There</B>
<P><B>was no emotion on their faces at all.  As they came towards me it seemed
as</B>
<P><B>if they didnt know I was there.  That was the only thing that had
ever</B>
<P><B>happened to me there.  We moved and in the next house which we were
in for</B>
<P><B>about 5yrs I never had anything happen to me.  Then we moved again
into</B>
<P><B>another old house, I dont know when it was built but it was insulated
with</B>
<P><B>newspaper if that helps and in this house things happened again.  It
was</B>
<P><B>different though. I would see shadows. hear noises and be sitting doing
my</B>
<P><B>homework and hear my bed creak and I would look over and see a spot
on my</B>
<P><B>bed pushed down like someone were sitting on it.  I would think I saw</B>
<P><B>shadows but I never really saw anyone like in the other house.  Well
I then</B>
<P><B>grew up and got married and had three children.  My husband and I bought
my</B>
<P><B>Aunts house that her and my Uncle lived in for about 20yrs.  Its a
cape cod</B>
<P><B>style house and at the top of the stairs is a room that I decided to
make</B>
<P><B>my kids play room.  I was up there getting things situated and I stood
at</B>
<P><B>the top of the stairs looking to see if everything was were I wanted
it and</B>
<P><B>I felt a tug on my nightgown. I looked down expecting to see one of
the</B>
<P><B>kids wondering how they got up the old creaky stairs without me
hearing</B>
<P><B>them and noone was there.  I had on sweat pants and a knee length
night</B>
<P><B>gown, so I just figured that my gown got stuck on my sweats some how
and it</B>
<P><B>felt like a tug.I thought nothing of it and stood there looking around.
</B>
<P><B>All of the sudden it happened again and I couldnt mistake it for any
thing</B>
<P><B>but a tug, and this time it wasnt one tug it was two.  I got a little</B>
<P><B>nervouse and went down stairs.  Then many other things started to
happen,</B>
<P><B>noises, toys with no batteries starting to work in rooms noone was
in, my</B>
<P><B>kids were always complaining that they heard noises or someone walking.
</B>
<P><B>This time it wasnt just me hearing things, my kids my husband all of
us</B>
<P><B>did.  I finally decided to call a paraphsycologist that I found in
the</B>
<P><B>phone book.  Come to find out she was well known and has been on
sightings</B>
<P><B>the TV show. She told us that there was someone there and everywhere
where</B>
<P><B>some thing had happened or we saw things were places in the house that
she</B>
<P><B>told me it went alot.  I never told her any specific places things
were</B>
<P><B>heard or happened at either.  She told me that whoever it was for
some</B>
<P><B>reason was attached to me but she didnt know why.  She told me to put
sea</B>
<P><B>salt in all the corners of my house and to play music and spend more
time</B>
<P><B>upstairs make it a little more homey.  We werent using upstairs alot</B>
<P><B>because thats where the kids rooms were and they became afraid to sleep
or</B>
<P><B>play up there.  Well I took her advice and did all she told me and
ended up</B>
<P><B>having the worst night of my life.  My brother in-law spent the night
and</B>
<P><B>he was about 15yrs old at the time.  I had music playing upstairs in
my</B>
<P><B>daughters bedroom [not loud enough for us to hear downstairs] and we
were</B>
<P><B>watching t.v.  All of the sudden we started hearing these really loud</B>
<P><B>noises like stuff was falling or being thrown, we went to see what
it was,</B>
<P><B>I had a fisherprice play house sitting on top of the tv upstairs with
some</B>
<P><B>other stuff and I thought maybe it all fell, we got up there and
nothing</B>
<P><B>was out of place, we had no idea what all the noise was.  We went back
down</B>
<P><B>and it happened again.  Well this went on for awhile,  the last time
we</B>
<P><B>went to look the radio station I had on in my daughters room was
changed</B>
<P><B>from a rock station to a religious station.  We turned off the radio
and</B>
<P><B>went back down stairs both of us, my brother in law and I were a
little</B>
<P><B>nervous.  We continued watching TV and we started hearing foot steps
going</B>
<P><B>up and down the steps and each time it would come further down and
go back</B>
<P><B>up.  By this time we were scared, I woke up my husband and everytime
I woke</B>
<P><B>him up to hear it, it would stop.  It then started comming all the
way down</B>
<P><B>the steps and into the livingroom.  When my husband left for work at
4:30</B>
<P><B>me and my brother in law went in my room with my kids and all squeezed
into</B>
<P><B>my bed and shut the door.  You could still hear the floor and the
steps</B>
<P><B>creaking and it started coming right outside the door.  The next day
I</B>
<P><B>called the parapshychologist and told her what happened,  She said
that</B>
<P><B>things like that happen often because phsychics give off alot of energy
and</B>
<P><B>since she was here it got alot of energy and thats why there was so
much</B>
<P><B>activity.  Well after that things did quiet down but I can still feel</B>
<P><B>something here occasionally or we will here unexplained noises and
things,</B>
<P><B>but never like that night!</B>

<P><B>New Home Haunting</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: robermom@prodigy.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>        Shortly after I moved into my home, I met my current husband.</B>
<P><B>When he moved in, alot of strangethings began to happen. Several
times</B>
<P><B>we were awakened late at night (three a.m.) by loud knocking at our</B>
<P><B>door. When we got up, no one was there. One night we awoke at three
a.m.</B>
<P><B>to the sound of footsteps. We both got up, looked all around the
house,</B>
<P><B>looked OUTSIDE the house, no one there, yet we could both still hear
the</B>
<P><B>footsteps. They stopped after about ten minutes. Later still, one</B>
<P><B>evening, we were discussing these events, when I said something like,</B>
<P><B>"Geez, if only we had some sort of proof of all this weirdness..."
and</B>
<P><B>atthat moment, a large dark shadow flew out of a mirror we were
sitting</B>
<P><B>by, making aloud fluttering noise as it flew through the house and
out</B>
<P><B>the front door. My husband looked at me, I looked at him, we were
both</B>
<P><B>afraid to speak. "Did you see that?" He siad it first. Welll, we both</B>
<P><B>saw it. I can't describe to you how weird it feels to see something
that</B>
<P><B>can't exist with another person. I mean, it's disturbing. It really
is.</B>
<P><B>The kids began to see shadow-cats. That is, cats in the house. At
that</B>
<P><B>time we had no cat! I asked if there was a spirit in the house one
day,</B>
<P><B>and a name popped into my head, but I never pursued that.We began to</B>
<P><B>affectionately address the ghost and treat it like it belonged there,</B>
<P><B>and graduallly these strange events stopped.</B>

<P><B>Something's Watching Us</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: phyllisstein@hotmail.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>Well, here's my experience, although it's not quite as fantastic as
others!</B>
<P><B>     Two friends of mine and I had recently moved into the historic
5 points </B>
<P><B>district in Jacksonville, Fl.  Many of the buildings are of 19th century
and </B>
<P><B>1900's vintage, and there are several historic renovations going on.
 The 3 </B>
<P><B>story building we moved into is about 80 years old, and sectioned off
into </B>
<P><B>several different apartments, our 3 bedroom penthouse apartment being
a </B>
<P><B>converted attic.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Here's where the weird stuff starts...I don't know if it's just my
</B>
<P><B>imagination, as I've always been interested in the paranormal, but
nothing </B>
<P><B>of this sort has ever really happened to me.  For the first few weeks,
I was </B>
<P><B>the only tenant in the house, as my roommates travelled in their jobs
alot. </B>
<P><B>I would see a form in the corner of my eye.  Sometimes it would be
a dark </B>
<P><B>figure, between 5 to 6 ft tall.  Other times, it would be something
akin to </B>
<P><B>a large black rat that would dart away once you directed your attention
to </B>
<P><B>it.  It couldn't have been rats, as the place was well maintained with
</B>
<P><B>regular pest control visits, and I never once found droppings or evidence
of </B>
<P><B>any sort.  These forms never made any sounds.  I kind of just figured
that </B>
<P><B>maybe I was adjusting to the new place.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One night a couple of weeks later, I was slipping into a deep, comfortable
</B>
<P><B>sleep when I was jerked awake by an enormous pressure upon my throat,
like </B>
<P><B>two thumbs pressing into my esophagus..someone was choking me!  I awoke
</B>
<P><B>ready to kill or be killed, but there was noone on top of me...the
pressure </B>
<P><B>was gone.  I eventually went back to sleep, thinking I needed to lay
off the </B>
<P><B>occult books.</B>
<P>
<P><B>About a week later, I awoke about 2 a.m. to an unsettling racket of
heavy </B>
<P><B>foosteps on the hard wood floor of the living room area, like someone
with </B>
<P><B>boots on was walking around frantically searching for something.  I
figured </B>
<P><B>it was one of my roommates home from their roadtrips, and after the
</B>
<P><B>footsteps ceased, I went back to sleep...later that morning, I awoke
to find </B>
<P><B>myself still alone in the house!  Calls to both my friends at their
</B>
<P><B>temporary residences revealed that they were in bed asleep hundreds
of miles </B>
<P><B>away!</B>
<P>
<P><B>After my friends moved in, I was sitting in the living room talking
to one </B>
<P><B>of them, when he just all of this sudden broke out with "I feel like
</B>
<P><B>something's watching us"...all I could do was nod.  I'm not sure what
</B>
<P><B>history this house has, but there's definitley something here!
