<p><b>The Old Priest In Bryn Mor</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: graham.lewis40@tesco.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>It all started when I was age 16 and I was on a holiday while visiting
my auntie at her house in bryn Mor in Cearnafan, the house that my auntie
and cousin live in is 18 century's old, The House has a three bedroom with
an extension in attic made into two bedrooms with a stairway heading onto
the second floor opposite the bathroom, on the second floor they is three
bedrooms and one bathroom down stairs they is a spare room which is called
the private room and extra toilet and a kitchen heading into the laundry
room. My cousin once mentioned seeing a ghost but no one believed her.
while my auntie went out shopping and visit a friend, me and my cousin
was alone listinng to music and messing around the kitchen which had an
old fire place, centured in kitchen next to the window that viewed the
back garden,&nbsp; the house was on full heating, that was until the room
temperture went down,&nbsp; the room went cold and silent, we both paused
and stopped the music as a cold breeze shrived down our spines we slowly
started heading toward the door which was linked into hall, the hall way
was twice as freezing cold as it was in the kitchen, we then heard footsteps,
we froze and turned our heads to the stairway when we saw an old shadow
of an priest, the shadow was just a dark shadowy figure with with a see
through image staring straight at us, we both paused and could'nt speak,&nbsp;
we both panicked and legged it to the front door that lead out side the
house,&nbsp; while we where running a stool out of nowhere came sliding
across the floor in the hall, it slid and tripped me over which left me
with a big bruise on my ankle, so i got up and managed to reach my cousin
outside house, i then closed the door then decided to wait outside house
outside the garden until my auntie got back, when she didn't turn up for
two hours,it was only after my experienced i found out that a priest once
lived and died in this house, but our secret still lives on until now.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;That moment will always be stuck in my head for the rest of
my life.</b>
<br><b>my anutie has now moved out and is now living in a small house,
whoever now owns the old house good luck! i am now 20 and i haven't seen
my cousin and my auntie for two years the end.</b>

<br><b>My Little Haunted Life</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dizzie_me_gurl@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I'm 14 and im turning 15 in 3 months, this is whats happened in my
life so far... Ever since i was real little i've been experiecing ghostly
encounters. My mom said when i was little (about 2-3) we lived in the city
of Forest Grove, Oregon. Well i Forest Grove we lived in a comunity with
a whole buch of people. Our house was a former old folks home and was haunted.
I had my own room and i was so proud. According to my mom i used to see
"shadow people", and there was one shadow person i didn't like. I also
saw a little boy who died in a fire and was trying to find his parents,
and i would try to help him. we moved a few times but never lived in a
house, always a camper. Then we moved into a really old house. The house
was built in halfs (one half was added later). The first half was around
107 years old and the second around 50-60. My little brother and I shared
a room upstairs across the hall from my older brother who had his own room.
The upstaris was divded into two rooms a hall then mine and my brothers
room. The backroom was always cold and always had flies, regardless of
the whole in the window, and it always felt like someone was watching you.
The middle room wasn't haunted but was still kinda creepy! Jeren (my little
bro) and I would stay up late and play with our stuffed animals. We would
always hear footsteps in the long hallway connecting the two rooms to our
rooms. Any time we heard the footsteps we would jump into bed and pretend
to be asleep because we asumed it was our dad.&amp;n p;But noone ever came
in our room, and anytime we opened our door to look in the hall we wouldn't
see a body. My older brother Robert had his room just across the hall from
uss and would hear voices and scratchings in his closet. In m closet we
would hear scratching also but not voices. Above our rooms was the attic,
and w would always hear footsteps walking aroud up there. My bunkbed would
shake if me or my brother was sleeping in the room alone, and Robert said
he used to walk into my room and find me having conversations with noone!
Also my little brother saw a figure with red eyes. After living in that
house for four years we moved into anothre house. Robert would see shadows
walking down the halls of our new house and i also saw a little girl with
black for her eyes just watching me sleep. We also heard noises. after
living in that house for three years we again moved into a different house.(the
last two and this house are all in the same town...) Whenever i went to
bed i would have to have my dog with me or the closet doors would shake
and something would walk around on my bed. In the daytime when i was downstairs
me and my little brother would hear pounding upstairs. My little brother
also heard voices in his room.We lived there for a year and just recently
moved. The house we live in isn't haunted but does have a barely noticable
non-threatning prescence. Some time i hear whispers of kids, and Robert
hears whispers also. But nothing else has happened in my house that would
scare me.</b>
<br><b>Once me and my ex-bff were at a cemetary near my dads and we felt
the presence of a young man and he wanted to do us harm so we ran like
crazy fools!</b>
<br><b>sorry for the long story... hoped you enjoyed it!!</b><b></b>

<p><b>Presidio Park</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Flrs68@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>THERE IS SOMETHING STRANGE OVER THERE AT THE WITCHES TOWER.&nbsp;
IT HAS ALOT OF HISTORY THAT IS SCARY.&nbsp; I JUST CAME UPON YOUR INFORMATION
ON PRESIDIO PARK.&nbsp; I DIDNT KNOW WHAT I SAW A FEW YEARS AGO WAS ACTUALLY
GUARDIANS OR GHOSTS.&nbsp; I WAS SITTING ON THE WALL CLOSET TO THE PARKING
LOT WHEN THEY CAME WALKING UP THE STAIRS AND STOPPED IN FRONT OF ME . AT
THAT TIME THERE WERE TWO OF THEM.&nbsp; WHITE PALEISH MALES BLONDE WAS
THE FIRST ONE DARK HAIR THE SECOND.&nbsp; THEY WORE DARK CLOAK LIKE CLOTHES.&nbsp;
I HEARD THEM SNARL.&nbsp; THE BLONDE BENT DOWN ON HIS KNEES WITH HIS BACK
AGAINST THE WALL CLOSET TO THE PARKING LOT.&nbsp; HE STARTED PRAISING THE
PENTAGRAM WITH HIS TWO ARMS GOING UP AND DOWN WITH THE SECOND ONE STANDING
BEHIND AND BESIDE HIM.&nbsp; THEY SPOKE IN LANGUAGE I DON'T KNOW.&nbsp;
I SPOKE TO THEM AND ASKED IF I WAS INTERRUPTING SOMETHING HERE.&nbsp; I
DONT RECALL WHO SAID IT BUT ONE OF THEM SAID SOMETHING LIKE NO YOUR NOT
INTERRUPTING ANYTHING OVER HERE.&nbsp; THATS WHEN I LEFT THEM AND WHEN
I WAS LEAVING THE THE BLONDE WAS PRAISING THE PENTAGRAM AND THE DARK HAIRED
STILL STANDING.&nbsp; I NEVER THOUGHT ANYTHING OF THIS ENCOUNTER.&nbsp;
I THOUGHT IT WAS TWO WIERD GUYS.&nbsp; BUT WHEN I SAW YOUR ARTICLE THAT
WHOLE EVENT POPPED BACK INTO MY HEAD AND THINKS STARTED TO CONNECT.&nbsp;
WORD OF ADVICE IF YOU SEE THESE CHARACTERS IN DARK CLOTHING DO NOT I REPEAT
DO NOT SPEAK TO THEM OR ACKNOWLEDGE THEM OR STARE AT THEM MAYBE THE EYES
PLAY A PART TO.&nbsp; LEAVE THAT TOWER AND BE CAREFUL AND KEEP A TAB ON
YOURSELF.&nbsp; IN THE ARTICLE IT SAYS THAT THERE ARE REPORTS OF POSSESSION.&nbsp;
I THINK THAT THE WAY THEY POSSESS YOU IS BY GIVING THEM A WAY INTO YOUR
BODY.&nbsp; SO DO NOT SPEAK TO THEM OR STARE AT THEM.&nbsp; JUST LEAVE
THAT TOWER AND PRAY.&nbsp; SO AFTER THIS EVENT I DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING
OF THIS.&nbsp; BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED TO ME THAT SCARES THE SHIT OUT OF
ME.&nbsp; IT WAS RIGHT AFTER THAT ENCOUNTER PERHAPS A MONTH OR LESS.&nbsp;
I BEGAN HEARING THINGS MY BRAIN STARTED TO BECOME DIFFERENT&nbsp; MY HEAD
FELT DIFFERENT&nbsp; MY MIND WAS PLAYING TRICKS ON ME I KNEW I WAS NOT
FEELING NORMAL AND FOR SOME REASON I BECAME MORE RELIGIOUS I TURNED TO
GOD.&nbsp; THAT FEELING&nbsp; GRADUALLY CAME OVER ME I WAS THINKING KIND
OF UNUSUAL THIS LASTED FOR ABOUT A MONTH THEN I GOT BACK TO NORMAL AFTER
HELP FROM GOD.&nbsp; BUT THAT MONTH WAS A SCARY MONTH AND I WOULD RATHER
NOT GO INTO THE DETAILS. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS A POSSESSION OR WHAT
BUT I KNOW WHAT I WAS FEELING AND IT WAS SCARY. SO BEWARE AND BE CAREFUL.&nbsp;
AND IF YOU DO ENCOUNTER THROW SOMETHING AT THEM TO SEE IF THEY ARE REAL.&nbsp;
PERHAPS THAT COULD GET YOU POSSESSED TO.&nbsp; GOOD LUCK.</b>

<br><b>One Day at a Friends House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: moonlightsurrounded@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Well the only time I can recall, ever having an ghostly encounter,
(if you'd even want to call it that) was when I was around five or six
years old. My mother and I were staying at a friends house at the time.
Our friend, lived in a trailer out in the woods around ProphetsTown, Ill.
It was late at night, and keep in mind, I was just a kid, so, my mother
wanted me to sleep on the couch with her. Just when I was ready to doze
off, my mom jumped, and kind of maid a starteled-gasp noise. I remember
that I asked her what was wrong, and she told me something that I thought
(at the time) was crazy, scarred me a bit. She said that she was just about
to fall asleep when she looked up and seen a man. She said he was wearing
a cowboy hat, had long, black hair, and that he was standing right by me,
looking at me. Now I also remember when I sat up right quick, I saw no-one,
and it couldn't have ben our friend, because although we were spending
the night their, he (our friend) was wasn't at the residense. The thing
about it though, is that I still remember, that I had felt a presance,
but it wasn't very strong, and their was nothing, at all threataning about
it. My mom said "maybee he's your gardian spirit", and I would like to
think so, maybee but, I don't know. Peace</b>

<br><b>Nanny</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: JGarcia@TVGNetwork.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Let me start off by saying that I love you site.</b>
<br><b>I have had many experiences, Maybe I will send you more later but
for now</b>
<br><b>I would like to share with you something that happened to me just
this week, and</b>
<br><b>it involves my 9 year old daughter.</b>
<br><b>I was at work and my personal line rang and it was my daughter Sydney.&nbsp;
She was sleepy</b>
<br><b>and I could tell that she had just woken up.&nbsp; She said "Mom,
Nanny told me to call you and</b>
<br><b>tell you that you don't have any oil in your car.&nbsp; She wouldn't
let me go back to sleep until I call</b>
<br><b>you to tell you that."&nbsp; I don't know anybody name Nanny, and
I had never heard her speak of anyone</b>
<br><b>that she called Nanny either.&nbsp; So I was confused, I figured
that she must be dreaming or something (sure yeah</b>
<br><b>right, a nine year old dreaming about motor oil?)&nbsp; okay.</b>
<br><b>So on my lunch break, I was intrigued and I checked the oil in my
car.&nbsp; NOTHING... it was empty.&nbsp; I did need oil</b>
<br><b>in my car.&nbsp; I couldn't hardly believe it.&nbsp; I put oil in
my car and came back into my office and called my daughter</b>
<br><b>back to ask her a little more about Nanny.&nbsp; I asked her if
Nanny came to the door or what?&nbsp; She said "no mom, she just popped
up</b>
<br><b>beside my bed, and she kept telling me to call you, that you don't
have oil in your car, and if I don't call you she wouldn't</b>
<br><b>let me go back to sleep."&nbsp; I asked her if she was dreaming
and she said no, she had awaken her to call me.</b>
<br><b>I asked her how she knew Nanny.&nbsp; She told me she had met her
when she was 4.&nbsp; When grandma was sick in the nursing home. (my mother
was sick and in a nursing home for about 6 months before she died.)&nbsp;
She said the lady would tell her stuff sometimes.</b>
<br><b>I asked her what she looked like and she told me she was a skinny
lady with short gray hair and she was wearing a yellow outfit.&nbsp; It
sounded like MY grandmother, My mothers mommy.</b>
<br><b>Last night I was at my grandfathers house, visiting with my aunt
and uncle and grandfather.&nbsp; I told my grandpa about what happened
that day, and he said that he truly believes that it was his wife, my grandmother,
visiting and watching over us.&nbsp; He said, She was buried in a yellow
suite, (I didn't remember this, I was only 10 when she died).&nbsp; As
we were leaving he said, "Hey, tell Sydney that if Nanny comes back to
tell her something that I said Hi. (he said that with a tear in his eye).</b>
<br><b>I don't know what happened but It seems that my daughter may have
the same gift that I have.</b>
<br><b>Thanks for reading.&nbsp; Later.</b>

<br><b>Happened in the Night</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: donna.hubert@sbcglobal.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Alone in a friends' room, on a comforter, folded in half on the floor,I
was laying peacefully trying my hardest to fall asleep.All of a sudden
I feel a cold breeze (as common as it does sound) but the windows were
as closed as can be. I closed my eyes as tight as possible preparing my
self for what was about to happen (for some strange reason I knew)I looked
over to the left of me on the quilt that I was laying on to see the imprints
of 3 or 4 footprints slowly walking from the top where my head was down
towards my feet.What happened to me next was enough to make your skin crawl.Suddenly
I felt a being put itself on top of my body making it hard to breath.I
tried to move, but could not move a muscle.I opened my mouth to scream
and felt my voice traveling through my voice box through my throat but
it never made it out of my mouth.I knew I was screaming but I just could
not believe that all the effort I was putting forth wasn't producing a
sound.</b>
<br><b>Whatever it was proceeded to cover my mouth with it's own face,I
know it was a face because I could feel it holding my arms down with hands.I
was scared to death, but I had remember seeing the Warrens and they said
when you are scared your body is most vulnerable to being taken ver by
a demon, so I calmed down and accepted what was going on ,even though I
did not understand exactly what it was.I prayed harder than I had ever
prayed in my life ,HAIL MARY FULL OF GRACE ....With in seconds this THING
had lifted itself off me.I felt more peaceful at that moment than I had
ever felt in my life.</b>
<br><b>I awoke in the morning hoping that some how some way I could have
proof of what happened to me the night before and sure enough I had 4 bruises
that looked just like fingers on the upper inside part of my right bicep.
At that moment I was sure I WAS NOT CRAZY but my mother still seems to
think so.</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;Fort Roberdeau, Full Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: VAMPIRE_JEFFREY@peoplepc.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello, I have a great respect for what you do; in fact, I’ve done
a little ghost hunting with some friends and found it to be quite interesting.
Nothing professional, no instruments or cameras of any kind just personal
curiosity. I used to do this when I was in college, though I lived in the
Scranton area I went to college at Penn State Altoona. I found that local
folklore claimed there were many hauntings. We checked out a few but one
stuck out in my mind the most. A place which was in the Altoona/Bedford
area called Fort Roberdeau (pronounced Ro-Ber-Doe). This fort was used
to protect a mine within it from Native American attacks during the time
of the Revolutionary War. The fort not only housed mines but swelling areas
for the workers, soldiers, women, and children. It was like a very small
town. I heard it was haunted from a friend who lived in that area, but
he wasn’t sure why or even knew any story behind it. I did however find
out why it was haunted. Apparently the entire fort was moved about a quarter
of a mile down the road, where it still stands today as a park that has
Revolutionary War reenactments. Where it is haunted, is the ground it used
to stand on. The dirt road that leads to where the fort now stands goes
through a corn field, the right side of the field is where the fort stood.
Down the road the road about &frac14; to &frac12; in the middle of the
cornfield you are supposed to stop, get out of the car and look down the
road. If you look down the road you are supposed to see a black figure
walking back and forth by a power line pole representing a guard who patrolled
the entrance to the fort. If you look to your left you are supposed to
see a dark orb and a light orb, which is supposed to represent children
running in the field outside the fort. I’ve been there three times. I will
share each of those experiences with you. My friends and I heard about
the haunting from a few people. So one night out of boredom we went on
our first ghost hunting expedition there. We found nothing. We went a few
other places until we decided to go back to the fort again. This time 6
out of 7 of us did see the black figure walking back and forth by the pole,
the seventh being a skeptic. We left shortly after, it was getting late.
A few weeks later we came down, at this time the cornfield had been harvested,
it was just a barren plain now. We stopped, got out of the car and looked
down the old dirt road again. This time everyone saw the figure walking
back and forth by the pole. After a few minutes of marveling at the figure,
it was gone. I suggested to everyone that we walk down there, my friends
were a tad leery of walking but soon after I started walking down, everyone
followed. I kept walking…. I inspected the pole where the figure stood,
nothing out of the ordinary, I walked down the road maybe 15 feet more,
I was more towards the left side of the road when I felt the most eerie
feeling I have ever felt in my life, I felt a little paralyzed by the feeling.
I stood there for a good minute.. I stepped away the feeling went away,
when I stepped back and the feeling came back. I did this a few times with
the same result and finally I looked down. There was a spot on the road
where I was standing, it was black, darker than any other spot on the road,
it wasn’t caused by shade, and didn’t appear to be caused by any fluids
on the ground, it was just black. I stepped away again, nobody noticed
my interest in what had just happened. I asked a friend to come over and
stand right there and look (as if to look at something). He felt it too,
felt it so much in fact that he exclaimed a word of profanity. Slowly but
sure I had everyone stand on that spot…. EVERYONE felt something, everyone,
there were about 8 of us this time. All of us had pretty much the same
powerful, eerie feeling except for one of us. This girl claimed that she
felt as if there was something on her throat and had a piercing pain in
her stomach; she nearly doubled over in pain before jumping right off the
spot. We all stood around discussing what had just happened for a few moments.
I then noticed something. There was fog rolling in, I pointed it out to
everyone, we then realized that the fog was rolling from every direction,
I’m talking like a big circle about 100 yards in diameter was rolling in
around us. On that note we all started back to our cars. We kept watching
the fog…. The big circle of fog rolled in, and collected on the spot where
we had that eerie feeling. Then, just as quickly as the fog collected on
that spot, it just disappeared. Then we left. On our way home some said
they felt it was following us, but I’m skeptical about that. My experience,
my friends’ experience I did believe, we all felt it, and saw the fog with
our own eyes, it’s an experience I’ll never forget. We may not have seen
the orbs but it seems we experienced so much more. If you’d like I can
have my old friends verify this experience, I haven’t spoken to many of
them since I left college, but I may be able to get at least one</b><b></b>

<p><b>"Factory Ghost"</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: robynj67@bigpond.net.au</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;As of March this year (2004),I worked in a Factory.I was told
soon after I started that a worker had died there a few years before I
started.It wasn't until maybe 3-4 years later that I felt anything.Things
like seeing a person walk up to you out of the corner of my eye and then
turning around to say something to them and no body was there.Also I worked
weekends when only a few others were working and upon walking to the toilets
having the doors close just as you get there and again nobody being in
the area.I have also felt the feeling of someone just walking past and
brushing into me but again,no body there.He liked to play with us I think.When
machinary stopped working for no reason at all we put it down to our "friendly
ghost" just having some fun."He" was never malicious in any way.I think
he knew how boring and monotunous the work was a was helping us pass the
time......</b>

<p><b>Black Angel</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: auntkaren21@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Reading the stories on your site, I was surprised to</b>
<br><b>hear there are more than one Black Angels. And in</b>
<br><b>Cemeteries with the same name.</b>
<br><b>When I was a Sophomore in High School, one of our</b>
<br><b>teachers told us about the Black Angel in Riverside</b>
<br><b>Cemetery in East Moline (it may actually be Moline, I</b>
<br><b>am not sure where the dividing line is between the 2).</b>
<br><b>It is east of I-74 just as you cross over the bridge</b>
<br><b>from Bettendorf. The cemetery can be seen from the</b>
<br><b>Bettendorf side of the river.</b>
<br><b>He told us how the football team at Bettendorf had one</b>
<br><b>time for an initiation, taken a boy over there to see</b>
<br><b>it. Rumor went, that if you walked around it 3 times</b>
<br><b>and kissed it's feet, you would die within 24 hours.</b>
<br><b>Well supposedly while there it started lightening as</b>
<br><b>this boy was suppose to be walking around the angel.</b>
<br><b>It struck and tree and a branch fell scaring the boys.</b>
<br><b>They all ran for their vehicle except the one they</b>
<br><b>were intiating into the B Club. They found him the</b>
<br><b>next day in the ditch near the cemetery in shock. He</b>
<br><b>had to be hospitalized. He asked all of us to beware</b>
<br><b>of doing things like this, that people get hurt from</b>
<br><b>pranks.</b>
<br><b>I didn't think too much of this at the time. He had</b>
<br><b>told us about other instances with the Black Angel,</b>
<br><b>but I wasn't convinced that it was all true. After I</b>
<br><b>had graduated high school in 1969, some kids had done</b>
<br><b>the samething he had warned us about. Only this time a</b>
<br><b>boy was found in the arms of the Black Angel dead.</b>
<br><b>There was no signs of injury to the body, nothing to</b>
<br><b>indicate what killed him. How he was able to be in the</b>
<br><b>arms of the angel also were baffling to the police.</b>
<br><b>They said it would have been impossible for a human to</b>
<br><b>have put him up there in the arms of the Black Angel.</b>
<br><b>There would have been holes from the legs of a ladder</b>
<br><b>and weren't. They said it would have take 2 or 3</b>
<br><b>others to have put him up there, and there were no</b>
<br><b>signs to indicate anyone did. This wasn't the only</b>
<br><b>time this had happened either. The Times Democrat</b>
<br><b>listed the names of several other victims. All with</b>
<br><b>the same scenero.</b>
<br><b>I went to the cemetery when I was 29. The Black Angel</b>
<br><b>was still there. It was up on a pedestal, and to even</b>
<br><b>see it's feet, I had to stand up on part of the base</b>
<br><b>of the pedestal. The arms of the Black Angel were way</b>
<br><b>above my head. I am 5' 7" tall.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;After another incidence with the statue, it was</b>
<br><b>decided to remove it from the cemetery. This can all</b>
<br><b>be documented in the Times Democrat newspaper</b>
<br><b>archives. The newspaper is located off of River Drive</b>
<br><b>in Davenport Iowa. And the Davenport Library should</b>
<br><b>have them archived.</b>
<br><b>About once every 10 years around Halloween they will</b>
<br><b>feature haunted places in the quad cities.</b>
<br><b>Something I forgot to mention about the Black Angel is</b>
<br><b>that it was thought to have been struck by lightening</b>
<br><b>causing it to turn black, I believe it was suppose to</b>
<br><b>be made of Bronze. I know it was there in 1979 or</b>
<br><b>1980, but it was removed between that time and 1990.</b>
<br><b>They never said what they did with it.</b><b></b>

<p><b>A Haunted street in Hollywood</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Marlab717@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>The&nbsp; entire 6000 block of Barton Avenue in Hollywood seems
to be haunted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to live in one of the houses as
a child, and now own the house next door.&nbsp; A friend of mine used to
live down the street. In each house, the same front bedroom is particularly
haunted, although other rooms experience activity as well.&nbsp; The front
bedroom in the house that I grew up in had a huge cold spot, and was unbearable
to stay in there for more than a minute or two.&nbsp; Also in that house,
a closet door in another bedroom refused to stay shut, and a subsequent
tenant claimed her sheets were repeatedly torn off her bed in the middle
of the night.&nbsp; I got hit hard in the head one afternoon when I was
visiting the people who were living there at the time.&nbsp; They saw me
yell and grab my head, but didn't see anyone hit me. I had several other
incidents while living there as a child. The current residents also claim
the house is haunted, and their daughter won't go into the bathroom alone.</b>
<br><b>In my friend's house, her bedroom doorknob would jiggle and turn
on its own, someone would sit down on her bed in the middle of the night,
leaving an imprint,&nbsp;&nbsp; and she saw a spirit in her backyard of
a man who lived down the street on the day he was buried.&nbsp; Her parents
had been to the funeral that afternoon, and when her father asked her what
the ghost was wearing, she described the suit the man was buried in.</b>
<br><b>At my current residence, a middle aged woman in a nightgown (who

vanishes into the wall every so often.&nbsp; She's also been seen in the
front bathroom, and walking through the living room wall into the front
bedroom.&nbsp; Things fly off the shelf on their own accord from time to
time, and footsteps are heard in the room when nobody is there. I've also
seen a ghost walking down the driveway.&nbsp; He appeard to be a man with
a limp.&nbsp; When I ran outside to see who it was, he had vanished, although
there was no place for him to go if he'd been a living person.</b>
<br><b>It's my guess that if these three houses are haunted, then others
on the block must be as well.&nbsp; It's something in the area, no doubt.
The houses were built in the 1920s.&nbsp; None of the spirits seem to be
malevolent, but their constant presence is eerie enough.</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;Supermarket</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sharikamesba@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>A few years ago, when I was nine years old I called my friend Yashvi
at nine o' clock, who lived upstairs from me, to come out and play with
me. When she came out we headed over to Laya's house. She was our other
friend. When we reacher her apartment, which was right behind apartment,
we knocked on the door. No one opened it but we heard Laya say that she
couldn't come out to play.&nbsp; So me and Yashvi played in front ot the
apartment so we could see if anyone entered or not. An hour later we saw
Laya come with her parents. We ran up to her and asked her why she didn't
want to play and she replied and i quote "I've been at the super market
with my parent since eight o' clock, so i couldn't have been there</b>

<p><b>When I was young my grandmother had this cat.&nbsp; Back then even
it was old but</b>
<br><b>it lived and had a good will to live as it survived being ran over
bye a</b>
<br><b>car.&nbsp; This cat didnt like me much at the time but I cant blame
her she was</b>
<br><b>always sore from being ran over and everything.&nbsp; When I got
older I had to</b>
<br><b>stay over my grandparents for about a week and I grew to love this
cat as</b>
<br><b>she did me.&nbsp; She always slept with me and always watched me.&nbsp;
She would</b>
<br><b>follow me to the door every morning when I went to school and she
would be</b>
<br><b>there when I got back.&nbsp; She knew what time I would be home
and if I was late</b>
<br><b>she would actually scold me.&nbsp; Well sadly enough she died a
few years ago.</b>
<br><b>There were ghosts in that house one of fritz a dog I loved and very
loving</b>
<br><b>and very protective. One we think was a little boy who played with
a ball.</b>
<br><b>And there was one who was very scary.&nbsp; Often nights It would
wake me up only</b>
<br><b>to have Perty (the cat) calm me down.&nbsp; I always felt safe there

<br><b>around.&nbsp; There were a few other strange things like waking
up to see a boy</b>
<br><b>holding a ball, and hearing what we thought to be a dog walking

<br><b>My Ghostly Friend</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: xxboomxboomxx@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>It all started when I was around five and I had just moved into a
new house. Its a pretty big house with two floors and three bed rooms.
One of the beadrooms, the one my sister is now in used to be an office
and we haired a room. The room we shaired had a door in that lead up to
the attic. One night when I was asleep I hears something in the attic,
it was music, very sad and slow music being played on a guitar is what
I fugured. Well I got scared and ran out of the room into my moms room
and slept there. I kept hearing the music and would always go into my moms
room, but after a while I just learned to live with it. I was a very open
minded child so I delt with it well. I moved out of that house for a while
and lived with my aunt in another town, but when I was 12 I moved back
into the same house with my mother. I had my same room again and didnt
hear the music, until one night about a month after I had lived there.
I wanted to kown what it was so I took a flash light and went up to the
attic. I was looking around when I saw something move that looked like
a person and a screamed and ran down the steps, but as I neared the bottom
I slipped and fell down breaking my leg. About two days after it happened
I was in my bed sleeping when I opened my eyes felling a cold draft and
saw the attic door open. I got scared and covered my head with the covers
but they were pulled down and I looked up seeing the figure of a mabye
16 or 17 year old boy. He simply said sorry and disappered. After he disappered
the attic door shut. I got to thinking and figured that he didnt want to
hurt me, he was just sad so one night I left the att door open as I slept.
That night I woke up to find him sitting in a chair beside my bed. He looked
at me amd smiled, and I just smiled back and fell back to sleep. My mother
soon had another baby so we started turning the attic into my new room
so the baby had his own. The first night I slept in my new room in the
attic I was visited by that same boy. I asked him what his name was and
he told me it was Jake. I soon fell asleep. Every night I would see him
and I would ask him a question. I found out he was 17 and he had lived
in that house before her. I also found out that he had killed himself by
hanging in the attic. He did this because he was being abused by his father
and his mother couldnt do anything about it because she was always drunk.
I would see him every night and we would talk about different things, it
was like I just forgot her was a ghost. My aunt who I was very close with
died about a year ago and I remember the night I heard about it. I was
crying and I felt a very strange touch wiping off my tears. It was warm,
but all around it it was very cold. I looked up and sat Jake sitting beside
me on my bed. I cried myself to sleep that night, but him being there made
me feel better. Three days later when I was at the furnial I felt that
same touch on my shoulder and it just made me feel better like it did before.
I just knew it was him. On the night of my 16th birthday I was sleeping
in my room with a group of friends when I was woken up by a kiss on my
forehead. I just though it was my mom, but then I relized it was that same
strange warm and cold feeling. I looked up and saw Jake. He told me he
had something for my as a gift. He held up a small cross that was on a
rope and said his mother gave him the cross and the rope was a piece of
his hanging rope. He tied it around my neck and I fell asleep only to find
when I woke up in the morning that it was still there, around my neck and
the beautiful silver cross was reflectiong the sunlight though the window.
My mother had asked me where I ot it from and I just told her a friend.
I am now 17 and have had a visit from my ghostly friend every night.</b>

<p><b>It is me, Nancy. Still having a bit of trouble sleeping. Thanks for
replying to my email so fast. I wasn't expecting a reply that fast. Well,
who knows. Maybe someday I will figure it out or maybe it was just a really
mseed up dream. Ya never know.</b>
<br><b>As I said earleir I have been to the Devil's Footprint here in Manchester,
Maine. It wasn't a pleasant place. There is definatly a strong presence
there and not a nice one at all. I could feel the evil coming from it.
Who, or Whatever, it is, it is very angy. The second half of the graveyard
is a little more new and there are nice spirits there. It seems the good
spirits are trying to keep the bad one at bay. I would like to go back
again sometime. Maybe during the day to take a better look at it and the
church beside it. It was dusk at the time I went and I couldn't look into
the windows very well.</b>
<br><b>As I went around the cemetary I had my hands together, like in prayer.
It was winter but I was NOT rubbing my hands together for warmth. My husband
and our friend went back to the car just before I did. I stayed in the
cemetary about 2 or 3 minutes longer then they did. I had my friend feel
my hands. The palms were kinda warm. The backs of them were ice cold, not
like the usual cold from winter but ice cold like I'd put them in half
frozen water and left them there for a couple minutes. This really freaked
him out. I heard a couple children's voices in my ear whispering but couldn't
tell what they said. No one else heard it but me.</b>
<br><b>Well, thats pretty much it. Thanks for listening. Thanks for trying
to help with the dream.</b>

<p><b>Conneaut Lake</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: blakelybunch@comcast.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>We recently had a wonderful vacation in Pennsylvania.&nbsp; My husband,
daughter</b>
<br><b>and I went to the amusement park at Conneaut Lake with my in-laws.&nbsp;
There is</b>
<br><b>a Hotel there, and out in front is a boardwalk type of thing, it
goes across</b>
<br><b>a stretch of beach.&nbsp; My Mom-in-law and I were walking ahead
of everyone</b>
<br><b>else, and she told me that Conneaut Lake Hotel is haunted.&nbsp;
We stood looking</b>
<br><b>at this goreous old hotel, and she told me her story.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; They live way out in the country, in a place where it takes
half an hour</b>
<br><b>to get to the nearest grocery store.&nbsp; She was at home one night
and saw an</b>
<br><b>American Indian in her bedroom doorway.&nbsp; She's felt as if she
wasn't alone</b>
<br><b>in the house, when no other humans are there...Apparently my sister
in law</b>
<br><b>is sensitive to ghosts and the vibes of places she visits, and she
has seen</b>
<br><b>a few ghosts at their home.&nbsp; Once she refused to spend the
night at a</b>
<br><b>friend's house because of the feeling of darkness that permeated
the house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; To me the house is very confortable, the only thing I noticed
is that the</b>
<br><b>doors to the bedrooms will not stay shut!&nbsp; My husband is allergic
to cats,</b>
<br><b>so we always make sure we shut the bedroom door so they can't get
in; but</b>
<br><b>the door is always open when I wake up in the morning.&nbsp; At
some point during</b>
<br><b>the night, it opens up.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Last time I was there, I was dressing in the bedroom...and
the door popped</b>
<br><b>open.&nbsp; I just laughed...but I'll make sure I change somewhere
else from now</b>

<p><b>Sound Sleep</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dmason@improvedliving.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; To start, I will explain that for most of my life I have been
unable to</b>
<br><b>sleep with my feet uncovered or a limb hanging over the side of
the bed.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>am sure this was due to my childhood experiences when my brothers
would wait</b>
<br><b>for me under my bed and when I would climb into bed they would reach
up and</b>
<br><b>grab me to scare me.&nbsp; And, boy did they ever!</b>
<br><b>This happened quite a few years ago, 1992 to be exact, but I remember
every</b>
<br><b>detail as if it just happened moments ago.</b>
<br><b>My first husband, Russ, and I were visiting friends, Tim and Pam,
in Hammond</b>
<br><b>Indiana.&nbsp; I was working 3rd shift at the time and had not slept
for about 33</b>
<br><b>hours.&nbsp; We went out until the bars closed, myself being designated
driver as</b>
<br><b>I don't drink, and as soon as we entered their home, I excused myself
to the</b>
<br><b>bedroom to finally get some sleep.&nbsp; Russ, Tim, and Pam all
stayed up to</b>
<br><b>watch a movie.&nbsp; The bedroom that I was in was right next to
their living</b>
<br><b>room, so we were really only seperated by a door and a wall.&nbsp;
(I should have</b>
<br><b>said that we had visited this home at least 20 times prior to this
evening.)</b>
<br><b>I believe that I was asleep before my head even hit the pillow.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>awakened by Russ holding my foot out from under the covers over
the side of</b>
<br><b>the bed.&nbsp; I felt his grip around my ankle.&nbsp; I thought
it was odd, but seeing</b>
<br><b>that he had been drinking and the room exposed no light, I thought
maybe he</b>
<br><b>was having a hard time finding his way into bed.&nbsp; I whispered,
"Russ."&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>did not reply.&nbsp; I whispered again, "Russ, answer me."&nbsp;
Still no reply.&nbsp; But</b>
<br><b>what I heard next didn't come from inside the room where my foot
was still</b>
<br><b>being held out over the side of the bed, it came from the other
side of the</b>
<br><b>door to the bedroom that I occupied.&nbsp; It was the sound of laughter;
the</b>
<br><b>laughter of Tim, Pam, and Russ in the living room still watching
the movie!</b>
<br><b>I screamed, "RUSS!"&nbsp; When I screamed, the grasp on my ankle
freed and I</b>
<br><b>pulled my foot back under the covers and held the covers up to my
neck.</b>
<br><b>Russ opened the door and I told him to turn on the light.&nbsp;
He asked, "why?"</b>
<br><b>I replied, "Just turn on the light!"&nbsp; He did and I looked around
the room</b>
<br><b>trying to find an answer.&nbsp; Nothing or no one was there.&nbsp;
I made him stay in</b>
<br><b>the room as I examined under the bed and the closet that was in
there.</b>
<br><b>Nothing.&nbsp; Russ asked me what was wrong.&nbsp; I explained to
him exactly what had</b>
<br><b>just occurred.&nbsp; He smirked and insisted that I must have been
dreaming.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>hadn't!&nbsp; "This woke me from a sound sleep", I insisted.&nbsp;
He just wouldn't</b>
<br><b>believe me.&nbsp; With that my fear was replaced by anger for his
refusal to</b>
<br><b>believe me.&nbsp; I told him to close the door then and let me go
back to sleep.</b>
<br><b>I was not afraid.&nbsp; I was in the same room, but yet I had no
more fear.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>couldn't explain that then, but I believe I can now.&nbsp; Since
this episode, I</b>
<br><b>sleep with limbs over the side of the bed most nights now.&nbsp;
I also rarely</b>
<br><b>cover my feet for the sake of them being covered.&nbsp; I reserve
this for the</b>
<br><b>nights that I am actually cold.</b>
<br><b>I don't know why this event occurred, or how this entity knew of
my fears,</b>
<br><b>but I believe that this event cured me of my fears and my subconscious
nor</b>
<br><b>my conscious mind are no longer restraining my movements while I
am lying in</b>
<br><b>my bed or in my sleep. Now if only there were a ghost that could
take away</b>
<br><b>my poor eating habits!</b>

<p><b>Two Faces</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: miserychick59@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This story takes place at yet another graveyard. My friend and I
were out driving around waiting on a movie to start at the local movie
house when we got bored and thought it would be fun to go country crusing.</b>
<br><b>He took me to the graveyard where he has a plot. I had never been
there but I had heard of the little children that were buried there after
their father drove their car into the nearby lake killing them all, 5 children
in total.</b>
<br><b>But I don't think they were what we saw that day.</b>
<br><b>We pulled into the graveyard and beside the tombs is a very old
and large church, of what faith I'm not sure, but as I was getting out
of the car I noticed something in the very top of the church looking out
at us. I choose to ignore it, and went on with the tour my friend was giving
me. We found his plot and it had the most beautiful flowers blooming everywhere
on it. We hung out there for a little bit longer then turned to leave,
before i got in the car stupid me looks up once more and I saw two faces
peering out from the same window, once more I ignored it but as my friend
was buckling his seat belt he glanced up and told me not to look up, I
knew what he saw but he said they were moving towards us, I closed my eyes
real tight and he peeled out of there and I did however as is my habit
look behind me. I didn't see anything but&nbsp; for some odd reason I felt
sad. Well that's my story hope you liked it.</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;Possibly Grandfather</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: oops_thereitgoes24@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I live out by traverse city michigan. for some odd reason my father
and i</b>
<br><b>are the only ones in our family who have had uh, weird encounters
and wierd</b>
<br><b>things happen to us that is hard to explain.</b>
<br><b>i guess i will start with my father. this incident was when we lived
in west</b>
<br><b>valley city, utah. everyone was out of the house that evening (my
sister and</b>
<br><b>i spending the night at a friend's up the street and my mother was
away on a</b>
<br><b>business trip). it was just my father in the house and he was doing
some</b>
<br><b>summer cleaning and repairs in the kitchen. i will admit he had
been</b>
<br><b>drinking but he swears to this day that the beer did not mess with
his mind.</b>
<br><b>he said he set his half full beer on the counter and went to the
other room</b>
<br><b>for not even ten seconds. he came back and it had disappeared. he
thought he</b>
<br><b>might have just misplaced it so he opened another one. this time
he was in</b>
<br><b>the room .as he was working on the stove he felt something behind
him and</b>
<br><b>when he turned he didn't see anything or anyone; but his other beer
was</b>
<br><b>missing. my dad thought that whoever was messing with him did not
want him</b>
<br><b>drinking alcohol, so he stopped and he had no problems until later
that</b>
<br><b>night.</b>
<br><b>my dad went to bed around one in the morning. he always turns off
all the</b>
<br><b>lights in the house at the end of the night except the front porch
light in</b>
<br><b>case my sister and i wanted to come home. my dad woke up from his
dead sleep</b>
<br><b>for some reason. he felt like someone was watching him. that was
when he</b>
<br><b>realized that almost every light in the house was on. and again
no one but</b>
<br><b>him was in the house all night. he turned the lights off, and nothing
like</b>
<br><b>that happened since. we now live here in michigan and at around
eighteen</b>
<br><b>years old i started having weird things happen.</b>
<br><b>i just came home from watching a chick flick at my friend's house
across the</b>
<br><b>street. i was tired and decided to go to bed a little early even
though i</b>
<br><b>had the next day off. anyway, i was in the middle of wake and sleep,
where</b>
<br><b>you start dreaming but you are still kind of aware from what is
going on</b>
<br><b>around you? all of a sudden i felt this cold breath in my ear and
a man</b>
<br><b>spoke in my ear in finnish. i am finnish decent and even though
i do not</b>
<br><b>speak finnish i know what language it was. i sat straight up in
my bed and</b>
<br><b>my room was ice cold with the scent of a sweet tobacco scent that
i was</b>
<br><b>familiar with. my window was open and it was chilly that night,
but not</b>
<br><b>chillly enough to make my toes and nose ice cold in a matter of
seconds. it</b>
<br><b>went away, but for some reason i wasn't scared anymore, just stunned,</b>
<br><b>because the feeling i got was very positive. i told my dad of my
wierd</b>
<br><b>encounter the next morning and he just looked dumbfounded. he told
me that</b>
<br><b>my that my grandpa armus (his father) spoke fluent finnish and smoked</b>
<br><b>tobacco in a pipe. my grandpa was very devoted to his grandchildren,
he</b>
<br><b>loved being around us. he has also been dead since i was three years
old.</b>
<br><b>anyway, other things would happen to me over the years, and no matter
where</b>
<br><b>i go, what state i am in, something would always happen. it has
been getting</b>
<br><b>more and more noticeable lately, especially at work and at home.
doors would</b>
<br><b>shut behind me, banging noises, people calling my name, laughing,
crying</b>
<br><b>sounds; at work(a local ski/golf resort), i have my friend johnna
terrified</b>
<br><b>because she says everytime i am in a room with her she notices odd
things,</b>
<br><b>like items falling off the shelves for no reason (how she described
it was</b>
<br><b>thrown across the room), equipment shutting on and off by themselves;
no one</b>
<br><b>ever gets hurt though. a few people have died since the resort opened
in the</b>
<br><b>late fifties and at times i wonder if they are contacting me. i
never see</b>
<br><b>apparitions but something seems to clatter, bang, or fall when i
am near or</b>
<br><b>ten feet away. i always feel like someone is watching me too and
at times it</b>
<br><b>makes me nervous. the only thing i can think of is that i am pregnant
(a</b>
<br><b>baby girl; i am due the 22nd of this month) and that i could just
be under a</b>
<br><b>lot of stress with a child on the way and work too (I heard stress
can cause</b>
<br><b>people to hallucinate sometimes). but why would half of my co-workers
and</b>
<br><b>family members say the same thing, that something happens when i
am around?</b>
<br><b>i don't think i have a sixth sense or some ghost magnet on me, at
least i</b>
<br><b>hope not. i also don't think i could make things move without touching
them.</b>
<br><b>maybe it is just my grandfather keeping me on toes. i would love
to know</b>
<br><b>what it is because i want it stop, but at the same time i kind of
like the</b>
<br><b>attention from whom or those who are haunting me</b>

my father was about 4 or 5 years old and playing with his puppy in the
chourtyard when he hears two cats fighting up on the roof of one of the
homes,he looks up to watch,but what he sees terrifies him,in between these
two cats is what looks like flames,and in the middle of the flames,is the
head of satan,complete with horns,and goatie laughing,he runs inside to

lived with them at the time* had looked up out the window while she was
doing dishes at the same time and fainted when she saw the horrible apparition
so they were forced to believe him,the next morning the whole courtyard
smelled like sulfur,and the cats were found dead with there fur singed,the
next night my dad was in bed in his room wich he shared with his grandmother,now
lemme explain the set up of that part of the house,there wer rooms that
were divided by curtains and in between my dads room and the next was a

<p><b>I have had a few experiences in my life. Once, I was sleeping in

and you could see part of the landing on the second floor. I was downstairs
watching television and when I looked up to the landing a large flash of
light went off just like a flash on a camera and that happened twice.&nbsp;
Then, I was balancing my checkbook and left my checkbook on my bed while
I went to the bathroom. When I returned the checkbook was gone. I looked
high and low for it and when I gave up, I walked back over to my dresser

<p><b>Hendrix</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Cddolphinchic@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hi. My name is Christian. This is a story of some of the things that
have happened where my mom lives. Well to start it off about 12 years ago
my grandmother's husband died of a heartattack on the place that she still
lives at. She owns his land now there and has a double wide trailer that
she lives in there. My mom bought a trailer and moved on the land that
my grandmother owns so they could be near each other just in case something
happens. Well we've had some experiences and we believe that they are the
spirit of my grandmother's husband. His name was Guy Hendrix but we just
called him Hendrix. Well one of the experiences happened to my brother
and my grandmother in the trailer that she lives in (and by the way he
had the heart attack in it) Well my brother and my grandmother were setting
there watching T.V. when all of a sudden they heard a loud bang that came
from her bedroom. Well they walked into her room and found a cooler in
the middle of the floor that had been setting on a shelf beside the bed.
There was no way it could have gotten in the middle of the floor unless
someone had picked it up and thrown it. Another experience happened to
my stepdad who was close friends with Hendrix when he was alive. Well there
are a lot of woods on the land that she owns and my stepdad hunts in them
in the winter. Well he was setting in his deer stand one day in the woods
and he heard a rustling in the leaves below the tree. He was thinking it
was a deer but when he looked down he saw the ghost of Hendrix walking
and he stopped and looked up at my stepdad and gave him a little smirk
like he always gave when he was alive and then walked on and disappeared.</b>
<br><b>One other day my stepdad and brother were setting in the living
room watching tv one night while my mom was asleep. Well my brother some
something walking past the hallway in front of the living room and he looked
up and there was a little girl walking towards his bedroom real slowly
and he turned to our stepdad and said "do you see what i see" and he said
"yeah" and they watched her and she kept walking towards his bedroom and
then sort of dissappeared. They said it couldn't have been my mom because
the girl looked like she was around 9 or 10 years old and had long brown
straight hair and our mom has short black curly hair. They said she was
wearing a long white night gown and a night cap that looked from the 1800's
and she glowed white but you could see through her a little bit.</b>
<br><b>One night me and my brother were watching TV late one night and
i was laying at one end of the couch while he was at the other end and
i saw this blue mist come from his room out of the corner of my eye and
i turned and looked and it drifted back into his room. I asked him if he
had just seen it and he said No and i told him what i had seen.He was a
little bit freaked.</b>
<br><b>Another night i woke up in the middle of the night to go to the
bathroom and as i walked through the living room i looked over at the couch
and my brother was asleep so i walked quietly to not disturb him and when
i looked up this black figure in the shape of a human walked in front of
me towards the wall and then sort of seemed to dissappear into it.</b>
<br><b>Another night i was asleep in my bedroom and you know how when you
are asleep you will open your eyes and little and then go back to sleep?
well i did that but when i opened my eyes i saw this faint image of a little
boy around the age of 7 or 8 with black hair and then he faintly dissappeared.</b>
<br><b>These are all the experiences that have happened to us there. there
aren't any evil spirits or anything like that.</b>

<p><b>Childhood Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: smithsql@kos.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Laura Smith and I am 27 years old.&nbsp; I always thought
my childhood was so different from anyone elses'.&nbsp; I grew up in a
very scary house located in Smithfield, Ontario Canada.&nbsp; I lived there
for 13 years with my parents and 2 brothers.</b>
<br><b>This house contained many spirits, none of them were too harmful,
but we moved out after there energies seemed to be growing.</b>
<br><b>Every night foot steps would approach my bed, then the cold air,
then the little hairs on my neck would stand up.&nbsp; My blankets would
be pulled off of me almost everynight.&nbsp; I was always to scared to
look because when I would look it would worsen things.&nbsp; For example:
One night I was sleeping and I felt something jump on my bed, I looked
down at my feet and red eyes were staring back at me.&nbsp; I quickly ran
into my brothers' bedroom (the two of them shared) and tried to wake them
up and they did not.&nbsp; I then ran down stares to my parents bedroom
and woke up my dad, my mother would not wake.&nbsp; I told my dad that
something followed me, then we felt it jump on the bed....My father grabbed
me and told me not to move.&nbsp; It seemed like hours went on...and it
finally left.</b>
<br><b>These hauntings didnt only happen to me...My mother and father experienced
hantings, as well. For example....battery operated things would move around
without batteries in them....taps would turn on and off....doors would
swing open and closed...</b>
<br><b>To this day I still sleep with my ears covered.&nbsp; If I dont
I have nightmares.&nbsp; I would always wake up to something whispering
in my ear and the cold breath sending goose bumps down my spine.</b>
<br><b>The house was abandoned for quite some time after we moved out...a
hermit moved in for awhile, now someone is cleaning it up..It seems like
no one stays there long...We researched historical events pertaining to
this homestead and apparently a child died there.&nbsp; The child was two
years old and he was upstairs (in my bedroom) and apparently he was trying
to climb his dresser to get something off of the top, when the dresser
fell over and broke his neck.</b>
<br><b>When I was little I use to see a sailor type fellow, he seemed very
sad and lost.&nbsp; I dont remember this, but my Mom talks about it all
the time.</b>
<br><b>Sometimes, I would wake up and hear parties downstairs.&nbsp; Lots
of noise and music.&nbsp; I would cry out for my Dad, who would come up
and I would tell him to keep the noise down because I couldnt sleep.......only
to find out nothing was going on..my parents were sleeping as well.</b>
<br><b>The ghosts bugged everyone in the house but I always wondered why
the harassed me so much????</b>
<br><b>Looking back I think it was because I was the only one who slept
alone and I was the middle child, only girl.</b>
<br><b>My mom and dad finally saved up enough money to move.&nbsp; MY dad
didnt even take a light bulb from that house, because he didnt want anything
to follow us.</b>
<br><b>This home use to be a beach house. Lake Ontario use to come up right
up to its backyard.&nbsp; A long time ago people use to rent rooms there.&nbsp;
I suspect a lot happened in that house. It is located on Smith Street in
Smithfield.&nbsp; Weird eh, that my last name is Smith too.</b>
<br><b>I would like to chat more about what happened.&nbsp; I suspect you
dont think we are crazy.</b>
<br><b>I drive by our old home sometimes and I never get out of my vehicle.&nbsp;
I am starting to get brave though, my Dad told me to stay away from that
house because something may try to follow me.&nbsp; I dont know about that,
but it sure isnt worth trying.&nbsp; If some ghost researcher wanted to
come with me I may.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Baby Monitor" - Not "Daddy's Voice......</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; Anonymous</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>First off, I would like to say that I have always been intrigued
with the</b>
<br><b>paranormal....When I was younger, my best friend and I would walk
through</b>
<br><b>the cemetery that literally was located around the block from her
home.</b>
<br><b>Still to this day, old cemeteries I find fascinating and very soothing.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>like to read the headstones.. Sometimes, they would tell short stories
about</b>
<br><b>the person buried beneath. I often find myself thinking of what
it was to</b>
<br><b>live/die at that time.... Or what that specific family must have
gone</b>
<br><b>through.</b>
<br><b>After my father had passed, I would often pray for signs from him.</b>
<br><b>Anything... Just anything... the thought of going through life without
my</b>
<br><b>Dad was horrific....</b>
<br><b>So seeing his favorite bird in a tree.. at the time I was thinking
of him</b>
<br><b>was enough for me.&nbsp; I believe it was at that point in my life
that I opened</b>
<br><b>myself up to another side, or should I say another world.&nbsp;
I feel that if</b>
<br><b>you believe, then you will often see or hear.. maybe even feel something</b>
<br><b>that was meant for you to pick up on... A non-believer</b>
<br><b>would never pick up on anything, they are not open to it...Heck,
even if</b>
<br><b>they did....What a coincidence it would be right?</b>
<br><b>Have you ever walked into a room... within&nbsp; a moments time
pins and needles</b>
<br><b>(goose bumps) on your arms and legs for no reason...Maybe your chilly....
Or</b>
<br><b>maybe</b>
<br><b>you senses picked up on something that you never even thought of
at that</b>
<br><b>time to be there......Have you ever walked into a room and smelt
a specific</b>
<br><b>fragrance or</b>
<br><b>flower.... Maybe the windows were open on a hot summer day.....
But... what</b>
<br><b>if it was winter?.....Were you ever thinking of someone who had
passed...</b>
<br><b>out-loud or even silent... and then moments later you smell cigarettes....</b>
<br><b>just as if they were in the next room.....Or how about you are bending
over</b>
<br><b>to wash your face and you get the sensation that your are not</b>
<br><b>alone....Noises.....hell, I can go on and on and on.....How about
knocking</b>
<br><b>on a sliding glass door while you are settling in for the night..</b>
<br><b>But wait, did I mention that this door is on the second floor...
A deck</b>
<br><b>thats only entry is from the inside?</b>
<br><b>Needless to say I am a believer... these things do not bother me...I
know</b>
<br><b>these things are done to validate that my loved ones are still with
me....Of</b>
<br><b>course not the way I would want them to be... But never the less
I'll take</b>
<br><b>it..... The story I am about to tell you though.....I did not dismiss
as I</b>
<br><b>did for the others above... This one hit home!!!!</b>
<br><b>Every morning before my husband goes to work.... He goes into our
daughters</b>
<br><b>room... and re-tucks her in......Very quietly he would leave and
never</b>
<br><b>disturb the two</b>
<br><b>of us who are still sleeping... This particular morning... I woke
up and</b>
<br><b>exactly 5:50 a.m.&nbsp; I went to use the master bathroom.. located
about 5 feet</b>
<br><b>from my bed.</b>
<br><b>Afraid that I would fall back to sleep and never wake up in enough
time for</b>
<br><b>work... I decided to put on the TV and catch up on some current
events.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>was at that time..</b>
<br><b>when I reached for the remote (located next to the baby monitor
on the</b>
<br><b>nightstand)&nbsp; I heard my daughter say "Daddy"!!!&nbsp; and then
what I thought was</b>
<br><b>my husband say... Shhhhhh... go back to sleep honey.....Again..
Daddy up!!!!</b>
<br><b>followed by another Shhhh ....Honey go back to sleep......</b>
<br><b>Now... I am very aggravated... you see in my mind.... my daughter
is now</b>
<br><b>having a conversation with her father at almost six o'clock in the</b>
<br><b>morning.... Which is a wonderful thing in itself.... But not when
my getting</b>
<br><b>off to work on time... depends on my little girl sleeping , so that
I am</b>
<br><b>able to get ready and literally run out the door</b>
<br><b>once I wake her up... change her diaper and give her a bottle.....From
there</b>
<br><b>it is off to Grandma's house.....This routine can never be altered....Any</b>
<br><b>working mother reading this understands exactly what I am talking
about.</b>
<br><b>I get out of bed....open my bedroom door... ready to raise hell
once my</b>
<br><b>husband walks out of her room..... and suddenly, I glance over to
where my</b>
<br><b>husband keeps hid keys and wallet.....Every night&nbsp; when he
gets home... He</b>
<br><b>places his keys and wallet on a table which is located in our hallway.....</b>
<br><b>His keys were gone....and so was his wallet..</b>
<br><b>Suddenly, I started to panic.... I thought someone (physically)
was my</b>
<br><b>daughters room..... What must have taken 2.5 seconds for me to realize
this</b>
<br><b>scenario.... felt like eternity.... I was going in....had not idea
what to</b>
<br><b>expect.....But my little girl was in there....there was no hesitation.....</b>
<br><b>I opened that door...... and there was my daughter sitting up in
the crib</b>
<br><b>saying Hi mommy... She She's chocolate milk Mommy.....I know what
I</b>
<br><b>heard.....but ...how can I explain this one....I picked my daughter
up... I</b>
<br><b>literally turned on every light in the house.... Gave my daughter
her</b>
<br><b>bottle......and called my husband on the cell phone....</b>
<br><b>and thank goodness he answered.......because if he didn't.......there
would</b>
<br><b>have been no doubt in my mind that something had happened to him...
I was</b>
<br><b>not dreaming...There was another voice in that room.</b>
<br><b>When I explained what happened to my husband ( a little frazzled
I may</b>
<br><b>add)... He said hun... if I could be in two places at the same time.....
It</b>
<br><b>would be done.... Maybe you picked up conversation from another
baby</b>
<br><b>monitor... possibly out neighbor next door .... yeah ok...</b>
<br><b>Well... what ever it was... my little daring... was not afraid ......So</b>
<br><b>maybe guardian angels really do exist.. Personally, I think it was
my dad...</b>
<br><b>who never got a chance to meet her while he was still with us.....&nbsp;
I have</b>
<br><b>to tell you though.... It took some time for me to shake that one</b>
<br><b>off....very rarely do you hear a voice... let alone a conversation..</b><b></b>

to say the least .A first I thought it was my granddaughter's friend who
was sleeping over but I found her in the kitchen.The little girl was in
a nightgown and she was blonde.The reason I thought it was my granddaughter"s

<p><b>Nursing Home Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: KMGracy3261@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I just came across your website and was reading some of the stories
and thought that I would tell you about my work. I work at a county nursing
home in NH and have witnessed many things in the year and a half I have
been there. Almost everyone that works there can tell you a story of something
that happened to them.</b>
<br><b>Well as you know nursing homes are really the final destination
for most elderly and they pass on a frequent basis. So i am not surprised
that our building would Have spirits wondering around on a regular basis.</b>
<br><b>We are constantly hearing foot steps in the long hallways late at
night when there is no one coming down them. Lights in rooms going on and
off when no one is touching them.</b>
<br><b>I had taken care of this certain resident that was on a tube feed
because she could no longer swallow do to a stroke. Well a nurse had hooked
the tube up wrong and all the 1,000 cc that were in a new bottle emptied
into her stomach at a rapid rate. Well this women got very sick and passed
about three weeks after the incident. Well in our suction room we still
had the machine that she used for the tube feed. Well one night it started
beeping for no reason and the nurse shut it off. Well while the other two
girls were at supper it started beeping again and when I went in to shut
it off, everytime i hit the off botton it would turn back on and start
beeping the second i turned it off. I did it for three times and finally
unplugged the machine. Well after about five minutes the machine started
beeping again and this time it was still unplugged.</b>
<br><b>Other occurences are of the elevator going floor to floor with no
one in it and staying open until you enter. I have been told that a resident
that had commited suicide there had always gone to visit his wife and would
hold the elevator for people to get on and off. Well it seems that even
after his passing he is still a very helpfull gentleman holding the elevator
for the staff to get on and off. His name was Frank so we were told to
make sure we thank him upon entering.</b>
<br><b>The oldest part of the building is from 1890 and I have been told
it was an old Hospital before it became a nursing home.</b>
<br><b>There are many other incidents almost happening on a nightly basis.&nbsp;
I do believe that it is not only residents that visit us but of staff members
that have passed that had worked there for many years.</b>

<p><b>FIRST OFF I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I HAVE NEWLY FOUND YOUR PAGE AND HAVE
ENJOYED THE TALES. I HAVE SO MANY STORIES OF GHOSTS THAT I WOULD TRULY
BE HERE ALL NIGHT TELLING THEM. EVER SINCE I WAS YOUNG I HAVE SEEN "THINGS".
AS A TEEN I MOVED INTO A PLACE OF MY OWN AND FOUND THAT THE "ACTIVITY"
IN MY LIFE WAS ONLY GOING TO BECOME MORE KNOWN. I HAVE HAD THINGS MOVE
WHILE I WATCH. WITH NO ONE AROUND. NOICES HAVE BECOME A PART OF LIFE. EVEN
MY HUSBAND HAS LEARNED THAT THESE GHOST COME WITH MARRING ME. I WILL TELL
A FEW TALES TO GIVE YOU THE IDEA.</b>
<br><b>ONCE AS A YOUNG ADULT I WAS IN MY HOME ALONE. WHEN I HAD MOVED INTO
THE HOUSE THERE WAS A STATUE OF JESUS THAT WAS ON THE TOP OF THE FRIDGE.
I ALWAYS JUST KEEP IT THERE. ONE DAY AS I STOOD WASHING DISHES IN THE SINK,
WITH MY BACK TO THE FRIDGE THIS STATUE FLEW OFF THE FRIDGE AND HIT THE
FLOOR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM. WHEN I WENT TO INVESTAGATE I FOUND
THAT THE HEAD OF JESUS WAS BROKE OFF. I FELT REALLY BAD ABOUT THIS SO I
SEARCH THE ENTIRE ROOM FOR WELL OVER AN HOUR LOOKING FOR THE BROKEN PART
OF THE STATUE. I MOVED THE CARPET, ALL THE FURNITURE. I LIVED IN THE HOME
FOR TWO MORE YEARS AND NEVER FOUND THE HEAD.</b>
<br><b>WHEN MY HUSBAND AND I MOVED INTO OUR NEW HOME. A 1890 HOUSE. HE
WAS BUSY CLEANING THE BASEMENT. IN THE DININGROOM THERE USE TO BE A FIREPLACE.
I NOW HAVE A BAKERSRACK THAT STANDS THERE. MY HUSBAND SPENT THE WHOLE DAY
CLEANING OUT THE BASEMENT AND HAD MOVED THE OLD FACE OF THE FIREPLACE TO
A DIFFERENT SPOT. THAT NIGHT AS WE TRIED TO SLEEP THERE WAS SO MUCH NOISE
IN THE HOUSE. IT SOUNDED LIKE SOMEONE WAS BREAKING ALL THE WINDOWS. MANY
TIMES IN THE NIGHT WE WENT TO SEARCH FOR THE SOURCE OF THE NOICE. FOUND
NOTHING. IN THE MORNING I WALKED BY MY BAKERSRAKE IN THE DINNINGROOM AND
FOUND THAT A HUGE CARVING WAS CUT INTO MY CHERRY SILVERWARE BOX. I WAS
VERY UPSET ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN A GIFT FROM MY MOTHER. FOR DAYS
AFTER THAT I WOULD RUN MY FINGER UP AND DOWN THE CARVING IN THE WOOD.</b>
<br><b>I HAD SHOWED MANY PEOPLE. A MONTH LATER I WALKED BY THE SAME BOX
ONLY TO FIND TO CARVING IN THE WOOD WAS GONE.</b>
<br><b>A FEW WEEKS AGO I AWOKE FROM A SOUND SLEEP AND SAW A MAN STANDING
TALL AT THE SIDE OF MY BED WHERE MY HUSBAND SLEEPS. HE WAS WEARING A BLACK
AND RED FLANNEL SHIRT BUT FOR SOME REASON I COULD NOT SEE HIS HEAD. I COULD
SEE HIS TORSO AND NECK CLEAR AS DAY. I YELLED TO MY SLEEPING HUSBAND TO
TURN THE LIGHT ON. THE MAN THEN DISAPEARED. MY HUSBAND SAW NOTHING!</b>
<br><b>I AM A PHOTOGRAPHER AND KEEP MY BACKDROPS AND LIGHTS SETUP IN MY
ATTIC FOR QUICK PHOTOS. ON MANY OF NIGHTS MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE AWOKEN
TO THE FLASH GOING ON AND OFF (IT SHINES DOWN THE DARK HALL INTO OUR BEDROOM).
I HAVE SPEAKERS THAT HAVE PLAYED MUSIC WHEN THEY ARE UNHOOKED. I HAVE PICKED
UP THE PHONE TO MAKE A CALL AND HEARD MUSIC AND COULD NOT GET A DIALTONE.
PAINTINGS HAVE BEEN HUNG UPSIDE DOWN WHEN WE HAVE RETURNED FROM A NIGHT
OUT. ON MANY OCCATIONS WE HAVE FOUND THE BATHTUB FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH

<br><b>My Experiences in that House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: fowens-johnson@excite.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Goodafternoon. I wanted to tell someone about my experience at my
aunts house here in Charlotte, N.C. In the summer of 1998 my mother, sister
and I were getting ready to move into our new apartment. Since it was not
ready yet we spent the weekend at my aunts house. It is an old house and
to this day I believe someone died there. It's a two story house. Three
bedrooms upstairs and one bedroom downstairs. This was the first time I
had ever spent the night. It was the very last also. My aunt slepted in
the bedroom down stairs. My sister and mother took one of the rooms upstairs
and I took one by myself. I fell asleep eventually (can't remember what
time). For some reason I just happened to wake up. There was a figure standing
at the foot of t he bed I was sleeping in. I thought it was my mother coming
in to check on me. I called out to "it". I said "Mommy?" There was no answer
and no movement. I sat up a little and said "Mommy?!" All of a sudden the
figure said "Its okay baby. Go back to sleep". The voice sounded just like
my aunts voice so I was at ease for a minute and laid back down. Then I
had to use the bathroom but I was too scared to get out of the bed. I kept
repeating it to myself "I have to use the bathroom. I have to use the bathroom".
I felt something come towards me and as clear as day it said "GO!". I got
up so quickly I almost fell out of the bed. I slept in the room with my
mother and sister the rest of he night. The next morning everyone got ready
to eat breakfast. I came down stairs and asked my aunt why she came in
my room the previous night. She said after everyone went to bed so did
she and had not been up until that morning. To this day she still lives
in the house and I d o go and visit her there. I have not spent the night
there since my experience. I have never told her about that night. She
has never said anything about her having any experiences there.</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I'm a little shy to get into detail.&nbsp; From the time I was a
child up untill now, the hauntings in my mothers house have grew slim.&nbsp;
I'm not sure if it's because all the their children have moved out or if
the spirit(s) were angry with the way everyone didn't get along.&nbsp;
My parents, siblings &amp; I all believe the house is haunted still, regardless
of activity.</b>
<br><b>It was built in 1972.&nbsp; We are the only ones who ever lived
there to this day.&nbsp; I want to say that it was the third house on the
block.&nbsp; Now its a sub-division.&nbsp; The house is only 32 years old
but the activity &amp; feelings have been the whole time that I know of.&nbsp;
I was born in 1977.&nbsp; We have never had it checked out.&nbsp; I would
like to have my friend "Gary" come &amp; check it out because he does paranormal
research but I think that my mother would blow it off.&nbsp; Keep in mind
that she believes there is something or someone there also.&nbsp; I also
have a feeling that it all started to happen after I was born.&nbsp; I
couldn't tell why.&nbsp; I wasn't told that and I never told anyone that,
even as a child.&nbsp; Now, ever since I moved, activity is gone.</b>
<br><b>Just a few quick examples what has happened. 1. A shadow of a man
wearing a cowboy hat holding chains walking past my bedroom window.&nbsp;
I could'nt make it out because the shade was down. 6yrs old.&nbsp; 2. My
oldest sister moved back from Florida &amp; was spending nights on my parents
sofa because I took over her room.&nbsp; Well she woke in the middle of
the night because she heard the tea kettle on the stove wrestling around
and the burner ignight.&nbsp; She got up to see why our mom got up to make
tea so late but as she was standing in the kitchen, our mom was walking
down the hall to see what she was doing.&nbsp; Our mom heard the kettle
also.&nbsp; 9yrs old?</b>
<br><b>3. Running up the basement steps.&nbsp; All the time, still.&nbsp;
4. 2x4's falling in the basement and heavy footsteps coming up the stairs.&nbsp;
All the boards were leaning against the wall when my dad checked.&nbsp;
Not one on the floor.&nbsp; My mom has locked the basement door with a
chain at night ever since then.&nbsp; I was a baby at the time(sleeping).&nbsp;
5. Not too long after I had my twins, I was fixing up a bedroom for my
oldest.&nbsp; I was standing in the kitchen taking a break and the vacume
turned on by it's self.&nbsp; It wasn't plugged in.&nbsp; My oldest sister
walked it the door with my niece.&nbsp; All she had to do is look at me,
turn around &amp; walk out.&nbsp; She knew.&nbsp; 6. Has anyone felt like
they were being lifted out of ther bed?&nbsp; 7. Last that I can remember,
my mom was home by herself.&nbsp; I got a call at work.&nbsp; Every single
cabinet door in the kitchen open and slammed shut.&nbsp; Just once.</b>
<br><b>I know there is more, I just can't remember everything.&nbsp; I'm
just glad that we talked about it freely to each other.&nbsp; Yes we got
scared but we delt with it.&nbsp; Lived with it.&nbsp; Maybe thats why
there is limited activity now.&nbsp; Or is it just that I'm not there.&nbsp;
Only so often.&nbsp; Don't know.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Friedmans Woods</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Brandywine10576@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I just wanted to share another experience and i had some questions
as to if you've ever heard of this place.It a place right off highway 21.(
basically a strech of road) My father just moved to a place they call smallwood.
It was called Friedman's woods at one time. There have been several strange
things to happen while I was there such as keys disappearing and the shower
turning on and off at will.My stepmother also swore that she saw something
cross the porch one night. This site was where a house once stood, we had
to demolish the chimmey to build on top of a ridge.( the house stand in
the middle of these woods and my dad chose a spot where an older house
once stood) I don't know why my father chose this spot, but he did. Also
people have seen other people who are supposed to be dead on the side of
the road at night.My great-uncle had an experience of this.I've also seen
dead animals that look like their bent upwards while they were dead. They
say that this place is a passing point that spirits go through before they
reach heaven or hell but I'm not sure why it would be. My grandmother also
claims ( she doesnt believe in most of the things that people say about
this area) that there was a headless mule that roamed the area and was
seen by people from time to time. People also say that the spot was once
an indian burial ground. And that someone had disturbed them by building
on the graves.If any one has any information on the area I would love to
know the history and the rumors surrounding it. You can email me at Brandywine10576@aol.com.</b>

<p><b>When i was in the sixth grade my friends and i would always go to
the edge of the playground in the soccer field and talk. It was any normal
talk between twelve year old girls. but thats when we started to get scratches
on our legs and arms. We even whitnessed a scratch being maid on my friend
maryah's arm. it was going slowly down her arm and she said she couldn't
feel it until it stopped. My friend emily is big on the paranormal and
said maybe we should steer clear of that place. but the urge i got was
telling me "stay, stay" so after lunch on second recces i went out to the
edge of the soccer field and looked out on to the property of the schools
neiborghing houses. and i saw a girl in a white dress then she turned around,
when she did a train appered.&nbsp; she started to run and as the train
hit her the image faded. my friends came up to me, noticeing i was deep
in concintration. these encounters continued until we got a new student
in our class. We (my friends and i) became</b>
<br><b>fast friends with her. but she didn't believe in ghosts and said
they were demons playing with our heads. so about a month later we were
spending the night at emily's house and we were up late with her mom talking
about ghosts and paranormal. Emily had a ghost in her closet so we slept
down stairs because maryah was affraid of it. (we know there was a ghost
because we saw a figure run into the closet while we played 'Mash'&nbsp;
and watched it slam the door.) we ran down the stairs after that and kelly
(our newest friend) said that it was our imaginations. when we went back
to school on monday i opened my paper folder and on it, it said :" you
can call me Aleena" i looked up at maryah halfway across the room and saw
a woman touch maryah's sholder. we looked at each other at the same time.
and both mouthed the name : 'Aleena.' how she new that was her name i still
don't know. but lately when ever i look in my mirror at home i see myself
in really old looking clothes. i have plenty</b>
<br><b>more "ghost encounters" i guess you can call them. The down</b>
<br><b>de was i almost got in trouble because i was talking about this
with my friends and one of the annoying boys at school spread it around
that we had a ghost in the school.</b><b></b>

<p><b>A Gift from Grandmother</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: aslan8241@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Ever since I was nine years old, I have seen and felt strange things
around me.&nbsp; I have no recollection of this happening before then,
but definitely after, and I think this has something to do with my paternal
grandmother.</b>
<br><b>My dad and his parents had a falling-out before I was born, so I
never met with them until my grandmother's death, when my dad, two of my
sisters and I went to her funeral.&nbsp; I don't remember much about that,
but I do remember feeling her presence nearby, but I couldn't figure it
out since I had never known her in life.</b>
<br><b>After that, I began to feel and hear things around me.&nbsp; When
my father remarried and we moved to another house, I felt vibes off of
rooms in the house and heard noises that sounded like walking up and down
the stairs, over and over again, late at night after everyone had gone
to bed.&nbsp; The noises probably had something to do with my dad's second
wife, though, because after she and my dad moved out and my mother moved
in (custody switch) the noises stopped.&nbsp; But the vibes were still
there, the feelings of something still hanging out at the house.&nbsp;
Maybe it just didn't like my stepmother, either!</b>
<br><b>Nothing like this happened again until we moved to the next county,
and then I began seeing things, too.&nbsp; Mainly it was passing things,
just on the periphery of my vision that would vanish before I could turn
and look at them fully.&nbsp; The one that comes mainly to mind is something
I would see passing by the bay window in the dining room; a figure wearing
a red hooded jacket opening the latch to the side gate and entering the
backyard.&nbsp; I remember the first time I saw this, I went rushing tto
the back door, thinking it was one of my sisters wearing my red windbreaker
without my permission.&nbsp; But when I got to the back porch, no one was
there. I saw this quite a bit over the six years I lived there, but it
always vanished before I could get a better look.&nbsp; After a while,
I just let it pass without trying to meet it.</b>
<br><b>I felt something in that house as well, so when I was home alone
I would talk out loud to it.&nbsp; I never got any kind of answer, but
it didn't seem to mind my talking.&nbsp; I even starting singing to it,
which it also didn't seem to mind.&nbsp; I figured whatever it was just
liked having a young girl paying it attention.</b>
<br><b>I've gotten vibes off of other houses as well, usually something
benevolent who just liked being talked or sung to.&nbsp; Two of theses
houses were haunted; one by a little girl whose remains were found when
the ground for the house was being broken up, the other a brother of the
lady of the house who liked watching over her.</b>
<br><b>So after all of this, why do I call whatever I have a gift from
my grandmother?&nbsp; Because my dad was telling me a story the other day
about my grandmother, and apparently my grandmother could see, hear and
feel things too.&nbsp; I don't know if this is hereditary or not, but I
can't think of anything else that would explain it, can you?</b><b></b>

<p><b>For you Joyce</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; Anonymous</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Let me start by saying I have always been different and very sensitive
I have never spoke to many people other than some members of my family
and a few very close friends about my experiences for fear of ridicule.
My mother (as I am, is very sensitive) her abilities are frightening. I
discovered this early on as a child. Had it not been for her abilities
I would have died many years ago in a car accident.</b>
<br><b>There are many things in my life such as what I am about to reveal
to you. These things weigh heavy on my heart and somehow sharing these
things with others like myself that have been born with a gift and a curse
may someday bring myself to the point of reckoning.</b>
<br><b>This story begins about ten years ago. An old building in my neighborhood
was being renovated and turned into a shopping mall. I have always liked
nostalgia and antiquities so it was a natural place for me to visit when
the restoration was complete. It was there that I met Joyce.</b>
<br><b>As soon as I walked into the building there was a sense of age.
Whispers from the past began to fill my senses. “Much has happened here
over the years,” I thought as I walked down the wooden planked corridors.
Although the building was crowded with shoppers and people a familiar feeling
began to take me over. The hallway lights began to suddenly dim and I knew
it was happening again. Someone or something wanted to speak with me. As
the sounds began to slowly diminish I saw her. She was a young girl possibly
16 or 17 years old with very sad pale blue eyes. Her blond hair was done
up in what used to be referred to as a “bee hive” hairstyle. She wore a
blue floral dress and her skin was very pale.</b>
<br><b>At that point I tried to walk away. But as the people shuffled by
me in silence I seemed powerless to move from that spot. I felt her hand
slip into mine. “I have to show you something,” she said in a quivering
voice. She led me down the hallway down an old flight of stairs that was
in a state of disrepair. It looked like it might have been an old storage
room or basement. There was an old wooden sliding door that had rusted
hinges and the paint was cracked with age. She released the grip on my
hand and said “ I am down here, you have to tell someone”. She then walked
through the door.</b>
<br><b>Suddenly as if I had awaken from a deep sleep I was back in the
shopping mall. I stumbled back up the stairs. People were giving me curious
looks as after an encounter I sometimes loose my composer. I managed to
exit the building and back to my car that was parked about a block away.
After a brief rest I drove home. But this was far from over.</b>
<br><b>I have a severe sleeping disorder that can directly be attributed
to this ability of mine. After over 24 hours without sleep I was again
too tired to keep my eyes open and I fell into a fitful sleep. I usually
awake about every 30 minutes or so in a start. But this night would be
different.</b>
<br><b>The last time I looked at the clock it was nearly midnight and I
fell into a deep sleep and began to dream. In my dream I was back in the
shopping mall. The young girl with sad eyes came to me again. This time
she told me her name was Joyce. Her story was one of terror and sadness.</b>
<br><b>She told me she ran away from home because her father was so strict
with her. While hitch hiking she met a man named Darrell who gave her a
ride. She said he seemed like a nice guy at first. She called him a “hippie”
with a beard and long hair. He made several advances toward her on the
trip over the state lines but she refused. At first he seemed OK with this.</b>
<br><b>As they had no money they stopped to spend the night in an abandoned
building. That night he tried to get her to take drugs and drink some wine
with him. When she refused he began to force himself on her. She said she
fought him and screamed but there was no one around to hear her cries.
After he had finished with her he told her that he was sorry. She told
him she would tell the police that he raped her. That’s when things started
going wrong.</b>
<br><b>She said he beat her up and as she lay there in pain he left for
a few moments. When he came back he raped her again. He wore a piece of
beaded leather band that he tied around his head to keep his hair back.
This is what he used to strangle her with.</b>
<br><b>As I listened to her story I found myself crying. She stopped at
that point and looked at me with her eyes brimming with tears. “Please
tell my daddy,” she said her voice breaking up. She then slowly faded away.</b>
<br><b>I awoke from my sleep still crying and emotionally drained from
the encounter. I looked at the clock. It was a little after four A.M. There
would be no more sleep that night.</b>
<br><b>Several days went by without incident. On the sixth day things again
began to happen It started with a day nap I took after work. I lie down
and closed my eyes for what only seemed like moments, but in reality was
well over an hour.</b>
<br><b>Again Joyce came to me and pleaded for help in my dream. This time
she gave me a phone number to call. But upon awakening I could never remember
all of the digits. I did however remember the area code. I called assistance
and asked for the origin of the area code. It was out of state and no longer
in use. The operator told me that that code had been out if existence for
some time and gave me the replacement for it.</b>
<br><b>That night I sat contemplating what I should do. If I did involve
the authorities and they did look and find nothing I would be labeled a
nut. If they did find Joyce they may think I could be somehow linked to
the crime. I decided at that point to do nothing and quietly just go on
with my life.</b>
<br><b>But Joyce would have none of that. Night after night she came back
to torment me. She once revealed to me in a dream the last few moments
of her life. I awoke gasping and crying. Always her sad blue eyes brimming
with tears.</b>
<br><b>Sometimes I would awaken to the horrible stench of decomposition.
Sometimes in my dreams she would tale me down into the basement where she
lie in a shallow grave and show me the spot where he buried her. There
in the corner with a broken wooden planter laying on her.</b>
<br><b>I was at the end of my rope for she would not let me rest. I finally
prayed for her to leave me alone. I told her I never wanted to see her
again and to go in the name of Jesus Christ and find peace. After my night
of prayer she never returned.</b>
<br><b>There are times I have thought about asking her to come back and
helping her. But something always told me not to do this. I feel it would
be very bad for me and possibly for her as well.</b>

<p><b>My Lil Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: anna_lobaa@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, my name is Anna, and I'd like to tell you about my first little
meeting with a ghost.</b>
<br><b>p. s. sorry for my spelling and grammar.</b>
<br><b>I was 5 years old back then and we lived with our grandma in her
old house. One night I woke up, because I herd some noises from the kitchen.
I went there to see what is it. In the beginning I thod it's my cousin.
And there, I saw it. It was a young woman ghost. She was short and glowing
blue. She was looking at the plates and the glasses and then she started
to drop them one by one.</b>
<br><b>I asked for her name but she turned around and then she disappeared.
My grandma entered the kitchen. She didn't believe me and thod I was the
one who broke the plates, although i was 30 meters away from them. Only
my cousin believed me, because she saw her too.</b><b></b>

<p><b>"Her way of saying goodbye"</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Lilhomegurl311@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My mom had this best frind named "Vi" and she was mentally, sexually,
and an emotionally abused women by her husband! She was 45 and was very
sick one night, so she went to the hospital to get some X-rays! After they
got the X-rays done the nurse told her that they would call her immediately
to tell her what's wrong! So she got home took care of some business and
called my mom. She told my mom that she was going to come stay the night
with us because james (her husband) was going to go party and get drunk
tonight ( that's when he abuses her)! James ran her life basically, he
didn't let her have phone calls, hang out with her friends, or even let
her go buy groceries!</b>
<br><b>So my mom told me that I would have to sleep in the bed with her
and Vi would sleep in my bed ( I was only 11 years old)! So 8:00 o' clock
came around then 9:00 o'clock came around, and still no Vi! So I figured
if I layed down my mom would wake me up when she came!</b>
<br><b>Well all of a sudden I woke up out of a dead sleep for no reason
and I noticed that I was still in my bed! So i figured Vi was asleep on
the couch! So of course I layed there for about 20 minutes and drank me
a glass of water I had sitting on my table! Well I sat up in my bed and
happened to glance in the living-room ( which I could see from my bed),
and I saw Vi wearing my mom's red night gown with white fish bones on it
(I figured she didn't bring no clothes with her)! Now everytime Vi came
to my house her and my mom would always watch "Cocktail" with Tom Cruise,
because they were in love with him. So I seen her walk across to the entertainment
center , she waved at me and mumbled " I love you Meranda, never forget
that" and of course I said it back! Well, she bent down and got a movie
out the bottom , turned the TV on and put it in ( but it was still on the
blue screen)! She turned around and waved at me and said "GoodBye"! So
curiously I got up and looked in the living-room and I didn't see Vi! So
I looked everywhere I could think of, and I didn't see her car outside
either. As I was near my kitchen I heard someone sobbering! As I walked
in there my mom was talking on the phone, crying. I asked her where did
Vi go? Then she said................"Meranda, Vi died 2 hours ago! And
I couln't believe it so I walked into the living room and looked into the
VCR and out popped............COCKTAIL!</b>

<p><b>My Old House and First Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Randomperson1667@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>About seven or eight years ago, my family lived in a spacey one story
house with a furnished basement, four bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a stable,&nbsp;
riding ring and paddocks for our horses.when I was about two or three my
parents moved all my toys down to the basement, the problem was: I had
only been down there with someone before and when I had my toys down there
I played with them as much as possible, my family obviously couldn't be
with me all the time, so I was down there alone basically all the time.
sometimes when I was down there, even if I had brought all my stuff up
to the landing I would freeze, absolutly petrified with fear, afraid to
move or scream or it would get me, or I would get a screaming headache
and crawl up the stairs but when I reached the top it was completely gone.
and whatever it was wasn't confined to the basement, when i tried to get
to sleep at night I would hear giggling, music, or hissing from under the
bed. sometimes I would just freak out for no reason whatsoever when I was
alone. We moved since then to a house that was at one point part of the
underground railroad, I'm sure I'll find some kind of ghost here.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Feelings About my House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Dmm12078@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have had a number of experiences, I will try not to make this too
long! My first ones were in the house I grew up in. I remember being very
young (probably elementary school) and my best friend at the time and I
were sleeping in my bed.I woke up and it felt as if someone was shaking
my bed.The next day I asked my friend if she had felt it and she said yes,
I was very young, and had no idea about ghosts or spirits or anything of
that nature.On another occasion I had gone into my parents room to get
in bed with them in the middle of the night.When I layed down I heard a
voice say "I'm gonna get you".This scared the living daylights out of me!
It was a very mean sounding voice-or so I remember thinking.I didnt tell
anyone about anything at that time.Not long ago I was talking with my sister
and she told me that she had an experience in that house as well.She and
her friend were sleeping in her bedroom and she awoke to voices in her
room.They were little childrens voices, and they were saying "She's over
here!" "No, she's on this side!" and they said that a few times. She pulled
the covers over her and her friends heads, and saw that her friend was
awake as well. She asked her if she heard what was happening and her friend
said"yes, I hear it maybe its your sister" My sister knew it wasnt me because
it was the middle of the night and it wasnt my voice.They just stayed under
the covers whispering and terrified until it went away.</b>
<br><b>My next experiences I had were years later in the same house.I was
about 17 and at the time, it was just my mom, myself and possibly my youngest
sister(cant remember) living there.It all started when my mom attended
a seance at her friends house down the street from ours.She learned she
had a spirit guide and came home and didnt think much of it i guess.Well
soon after, she was alone at home one night and talking on the phone in
her room when the dog started barking.She went into the family room to
see what the dog was barking at and in the middle of the room was this
misty cloudy type figure-my dog was looking straight at it and barking.She
said she ran back into her room and told her b/f what she saw and he told
her to just go to bed.Well, I guess these sightings became a regular thing
for her-she would wake up to him in her room hovering over her bed, she
would look at the crack between the door and the wall and notice that the
hallway light only was showing through the top few inches, and know that
he was standing there blocking the light.She didnt care-it didnt scare
her anymore.Well it was a different story for me altogether! I didnt believe
in any of this stuff (even though i had the experiences when i was a kid)
I always would try and come up with a logical reason.I would make fun of
the spirit, say "oh, he doesnt exist" "this is BS" and so on.Well he was
DETERMINED to prove himself to me.And he did so by scaring the daylights
out of me.I would go into the back bathroom and the faucet would be running
full blast when no one else was home.I was in the bathroom one day and
i was facing the door talking to my sister who was in the kitchen.I was
making fun of "him" and the door slammed shut on me.And lights would go
on and off as well.One particular time I remember clearly-me and my boyfriend
at the time were laying in bed talking.Where my room was you could look
through the kitchen into the dining room.Well the light went off and on
and no- one was home-my mom was out of town.Needless to say, this scared
him and I thought that was pretty funny.There were many things that happened
there, too many to list and most that i cant remember anymore anyways.I
lived there on and off for a long time and after my father moved back in
and my mother moved out, I never felt anything strange again and didnt
have anything else ever happen.The next thing that happened to me was a
few yrs later when I was about 20 or 21 and in a different house.I was
at home and the phone rang-I answered it and it was someone asking for
my sister.I said to hold on and I yelled to her that the phone was for
her.She yelled back to me"ok just a minute!" and I layed the phone down
on the table and went back to whatever I was doing.A few min later I found
the phone still sitting on the table and went to look for my sister-but
she wasnt home.No one was home and no one had been there the whole time.I
have no idea who's voice I heard, but it was definately there! and it sounded
exactly like my sister.Ok well, this has gotten pretty long, so I will
leave it at that.I have a few more "feelings" or "ideas" about the house
I live in now-just little things like TV turning off and baby toys playing.Maybe
I will be back sometime, thanks for letting me share.</b>

<p><b>I Attract Them</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kd_wright@perfectfitindustries.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I probably have enough experiences to write a book! But I thought
that I would share one. I will e-mail the others separately.</b>
<br><b>Just an FYI as to my background… I have a full blooded Cherokee
Indian as my great grandmother on my fathers side and a full blooded Cherokee
Indian as my great-great grandmother on my mother’s side. I can sense ghost
more than I can see them and I have been told by numerous friends (and
my long-term boyfriend) that I “attract” ghosts!</b>
<br><b>Well the first real haunted house that I remember living in was
around the time I was 11. We had just moved to Missouri and were living
in a fairly old farmhouse with 80 acres. A few weeks after we moved in
I was sleeping in my bedroom, which at one time was a living room, on the
top bunk of my bunk beds. At sometime in the early morning hours(probably
around 1am) I woke up to the feeling of being watched. Upon opening my
eyes (the room was pitch black) I saw a tall black shadow standing at the
bottom of my bed watching me. I know it was not a threatening spirit, but
none the less I am a fraidy cat and I screamed at the top of my lungs.
As soon as I did it vanished. Needless to say my father (who can also sense
spirits) started sleeping on the bottom bunk. After waking up a few more
times to this person watching me sleep, I started sleeping on the couch
where he did not seem to bother me. As time went on though other things
started to happen:</b>
<br><b>*I always felt like some one was watching me</b>
<br><b>*Atleast twice a week we would here someone at the old barn in the
field and it sounded like they were hammering on the tin roof. We never
could find anyone.</b>
<br><b>*One night my tire swing started swinging like someone was in it,
although there was no wind or anything that could have caused this.</b>
<br><b>*While playing in my room one day I saw a man walk by my window
through my blinds. I assumed it was my brother and went back to playing.
When I asked him later he said that he had not been outside, in fact no
one had (we lived 15 miles from the nearest town and about a mile from
the closest neighbor).</b>
<br><b>*I was scared to death of our attic and always felt a heavy evil
presence there but soon I started sleep walking at night and would go upstairs
in the attic and turn the lights on. I also started suffering from constant
nightmares. Everytime my nightmare would start to get really bad it would
feel like someone woke me up. Since I was having constant nightmares sometimes
this would happen almost every hour on the dot.</b>
<br><b>* One day well trying to get some stored items out of a closet in
the attic ( the kind that goes out over the rafters of the house) I, my
mother, and my friend all heard very clearly a voice that sounded almost
like a child start calling my mothers name. We were all so scared we dropped
everything and ran out of the attic.</b>
<br><b>*Often if we went into town at night upon returning we would find
the attic lights on although no one was home and all the doors and windows
were locked.</b>
<br><b>* Later that year during a really bad thunderstorm our house was
hit by lightening. The lightening went through our electrical wiring, but
also hit a corner of the house roof and tree right at that corner… there
is really no explanation as to why our house did not burn down. There were
flames but they seemed to instantly go out.</b>
<br><b>Years later my father told me that the previous owner of the house
had died in the house of old age. He loved children and I believe it was
him who used to watch me sleep at night and also who I always felt was
following me. I also believe it might have been him waking me up when I
was having horrible nightmares. I always felt safe with this presence around,
and I think that it may have protected me from the other presence that
resided in the attic.</b>

<p><b>Old House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kd_wright@perfectfitindustries.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was about 13 my family and I moved to New Hampshire. My parents
rented the third floor of a very old apartment building from an elderly
gentleman who lived on the first floor. The building was so old it had
the separate summer kitchen across that hall that was used in the older
days (it was now used for storage).</b>
<br><b>I believe there were many different types of spirits in the house
now that I think about it. But from the instant we moved there I knew there
was going to be trouble. From the first night I spent there I could not
sleep in my room, all night long I could here somebody running up the front
hall stairs and right before they would get to our locked front hall door
the sound would just stop and then start again running up the stairs from
either the first or second landing.</b>
<br><b>My parents then moved me into the bedroom that was closer to their
bedroom with the bathroom in-between us. I was able to sleep but was constantly
woken up by the feeling of someone watching me although I did not see anyone.
About a month later my parents moved their bedroom to the big room at the
front of the house. The way our apartment was set up it was separated in
the middle. There was the kitchen, pantry and two bedrooms on one side
with a door that could close this area off from the rest of the house and
then on the other side was my brother’s bedroom the living room and my
parents room at the very front. I was now the only one with a bedroom on
the kitchen side of the house.</b>
<br><b>Not long after my parents moved their room I awoke to find my bed
shaking violently. I ran into my parent’s room, but was assured that I
probably just imagined it. This happened to me about 10 more times before
I started sleeping on the couch in the living room at night. I also started
suffering from a recurring nightmare in which I would jump out of my bed
and start running to my parent’s room. As soon as I made it out of my room
it would look as if I was a person watching the scene. I would be running
in slow motion and this thing that can only be described as looking like
a swirling liquid tornado would be behind me. Then it would change back
to viewing it from my eyes and just as I was about to make it through the
open doorway separating that half of the house I would feel something cold
grabbing my ankles and it would pull me down on the floor and start dragging
me back into my bedroom. I would try to scream, but it felt like someone
had punched me in the throat and I couldn’t get a sound out. As it dragged
me I would claw at the kitchen floor leaving long deep scratch marks while
trying to pull away from it. Just before it would finish pulling me back
into my room I would wake up. I started having this nightmare every night.
I almost completely stopped sleeping. I slept on average 2 hours a night.</b>
<br><b>This was only the beginning. Soon anyone that came to our apartment,
even adults, would comment that it felt like someone was following them
up the stairs. Our washer was in the bathroom, and my friends and I started
hearing things coming from behind the washer. You could here things move
behind it and you would hear what sounded like little people whispering.
My parents thought me we had over active imaginations and started calling
them the elves behind the washer. I started hearing people whisper right
outside the shower while I was in it. You would here things move in the
other part of the house when noone was in there and you would hear footsteps.</b>
<br><b>One night while in the kitchen getting a bowl of cereal I heard
a noise by the door. I looked up and watched as the chain on the door undid
itself and started swinging back and forth.</b>
<br><b>On quiet a few occasions if you walked by the front hallway door
the door knob would start rattling like someone was trying to get in.</b>
<br><b>In my bedroom my radio would turn itself on and change songs on
the cd itself. One night while a friend was sleeping over we were playing
super Nintendo and when we entered a new world the screen went black for
a second while the world changed. As this happened for some reason both
my friend and I turned to look near the top of my bed. There stood a massive
black shadow that resembled a man. Another time when she spent the night
we were sitting in the living room watching TV. she was sitting in a chair
that was positioned so that you could see into my parents bedroom. All
of a sudden her jaw dropped and she turned as white as snow. When I asked
her what just happened she told me that a whitish transparent female had
materialized right before her eyes in my parents bedroom. The apparition
looked right at her. It turned and looked at my parents (who were sleeping)
for a few moments and then turn and floated through their wall out into
the front hallway.</b>
<br><b>On another occasion I had two friends spending the night. We had
two birds in a cage in the kitchen at the time that used to go nuts at
night (gee, I wonder why!) When they got loud we would throw stuffed animals
at the cage to get them to be quiet. Well on this night I passed out early
and my two friends stayed up. This is the story they told me the next morning.
They had sat on my bed watching TV. while I was passed out beside them.
They started to get a creepy feeling from the kitchen so they closed the
door to my bedroom. A little while later they heard a knock on my bedroom
door. Assuming it was my dad they opened the door but did not see anyone.
One of them happened to look down and there right in the middle of my doorway
stood a completely plush (meaning it can not stand on its own) cookie monster
doll that was about 9 inches tall (it had been thrown at the bird cage
earlier. As soon as he noticed it so did the other friend. The doll then
started walking towards them obviously wanting to come in my room. They
freaked out and one of them kicked the doll across the kitchen and then
they slammed my door and locked it.</b>
<br><b>Once also as I was standing by the stove in the kitchen warming
up I saw what looked to me like a little demon creature that was all white
and had blood red eyes crawl up on my bed and jump off the other side of
it. I went ballistic at that point and refused to step foot in that room.
Needless to say we moved shortly after that.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Early childhood experience with???</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>So glad to have come across your sight.&nbsp; I'd like to share a
strange experience with you that now, many years later, I have been recalling:</b>
<br><b>Doing some quick arithmetic I surmise that this experience took
place when I was no older than 3 or 3 1/2 years of age.&nbsp; My parents
had a party of some sort in the basement apartment that we lived in during
the late 1950's (dad was the building super).&nbsp; I can vividly remember
waking up during it, probably due to the noise.&nbsp; I wandered out and
asked for something--water or milk, I don't remember exactly--and was brought
into the kitchen.&nbsp; I can still in my mind's eye see the colorful aluminum
"cocktail" glasses that they were using at the party, strangely enough.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, while my mother (maybe an aunt) went to get the beverage
for me, I was amazed to see a small, ugly figure perched up on the kitchen
cabinet.&nbsp; It had a leathery face that was all scrunched up--like a
newborn baby.&nbsp; I don't recall what, if any, clothes this thing was
wearing.&nbsp; What I DO recall (and it's making the hair on the back of
my neck stand up right now as I type) is the absolutely pure essence of
hatred that this thing had in it as it settled its ugly, squinty eyes on
me.&nbsp; Now keep in mind, there had to be other people in that kitchen--a
female relative or my mom for sure, but everyone else was oblivious to
this creature's presence.&nbsp; Here's where it gets strange, folks:&nbsp;
the torrent of foul language that came out of its mouth, and which I did
not understand, was non-stop and very angry.&nbsp; It was like the "troll"
did not like the fact that I could see it.</b>
<br><b>I started to cry, and when I was asked why I just kept pointing
at the thing.&nbsp; I remember other people now coming over and telling
me it was "a bad dream", or some such nonsense.&nbsp; The only reason I
KNOW it was using foul language at me was because I repeated some of the
words right then and there in an attempt to tell people what "it" was saying,
and BOY did I get a smack on the butt!&nbsp; I'll edit here, but keep in
mind that these words are just as vivid today--some 45 years later--as
if they were at that instant.&nbsp; The thing actually started giggling
when I got smacked (the punishment I definitely recall, because it was
the first time I was ever spanked), and at that point I ran out of the
kitchen and back into the living room, where I found my father.</b>
<br><b>"What are you looking at, you little bastard?", it snarled.&nbsp;
"You f***ing c**ksucker, get out of here!", it railed at me.</b>
<br><b>I can't tell you how good it feels to get this off my chest.&nbsp;
I have never, EVER spoken about this to anyone, including my wife of over
20 years.&nbsp; It is never very far from my memory when the subject of
the paranormal or occult comes up, but I have always hesitated in speaking
about it.</b>
<br><b>I certainly don't know what to make of it to this day.&nbsp; Was
it just my over-imagination at that young age?&nbsp; If so, where in the
world did I conjure up words such as that?&nbsp; No one in my family, nor
anyone at that party spoke in such a way (my dad would have physically
tossed them out).</b>
<br><b>The building we lived in was an OLD, old four story apartment house
that was one of the first multiple family dwellings built on Hudson County
Boulevard in Bayonne.&nbsp; In talking of the old days, my mom often said
she was afraid to be alone in the apartment with just me and my younger
sister, even taking care not to go hang a wash in the basement because
she felt she was being watched from somewhere in the shadows of the cavernous
basement.</b>
<br><b>Here's another neat fact about the place:&nbsp; my cousin and I
had gotten some pedal cars a couple of years after this ( I recall that
I had just started kindergarten and was five years old).&nbsp; My dad took
some 8mm home movies, using the old-fashioned shoulder mounted lights to
illuminate the basement as we wheeled around.&nbsp; In the films, I can
recall a whitish figure being in the background of some of the speeded-up,
blurry but typical home movie frames that dad projected onto the screen
for us.&nbsp; It must have been shown a dozen times over the years, and
every time it was, someone would inevitably make a joke about the blur,
saying things like, "here comes Casper in the back".</b>
<br><b>Unfortunately, my dad passed away around eight years ago and my
mom threw out a bunch of his old things in the basement of the home they
have lived in for the last thirty years or so.&nbsp; We assume that a bunch
of the old home movies were among the items discarded.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, I thank you very much for the opportunity of sharing this
strange episode with you, and hope you don't think me too crazy;-)</b>

<p><b>Lots of Ghost Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: blazin_princezz878@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hey..my name is ashley and i have many different eery stories i'd
like to share with you.</b>
<br><b>First story: First let me start of by telling you that my bedroom
door isn't the easiest thing to close, it takes a bit of force to either
open or shut. Now the story....ok well i was upstairs in my room watching
TV.. i was on my bed (my stomach on the bed) facing the tv, the door was
directly behind me. As i watched tv i had begun to get thirsty so i decide
to go downstairs to get a cup of water. when i got downstairs i saw my
dad on the couch asleep and my brother and sister watching tv, my mom was
in the basement with some friends of hers. So i got my water and went back
upstairs, i closed my bedroom door all the way so that if someone was trying
to get in i could here them. i went back to watching tv and i layed down
the way i was then i felt this strange feeling ...it made me uncomfortable
and before i knew it my door flew open! someone had to have used a lot
of force to open it the way it did..it was so strong it kept swinging back
and forth for a while..as soon as it happened i looked back and saw nothing
and i know it wasn't anyone in my family trying to trick me because i would
have seen them running down the hallway to the staircase. There was no
one there..it may not seem like lot but it terrified me.</b>
<br><b>second story: Ok this was one of the things that scared me the most.
It was the classic setting..i was a teenager home alone and it was getting
dark. I decided to watch some tv until my family would get back. i was
sitting on the a green couch that was facing the staircase. I was watching
the tv when i began to hear faint footsteps coming from upstairs ..at first
i thought nothing of it..probably just the neigbours but i knew i was wrong
withing the next 10 minutes. the noises would go on for about 45 seconds
then stop. they began to get louder and louder and at one point i seriously
heard the footsteps come down the stairs then just stop. i was freaking
out like mad..i didnt know what to do. I calmed down after a while of sitting
on the couch where i could see everything. When my family came home i was
so relieved. But that wasn't the last time i was going to hear those noises.
It all happened again this time my mom and sister were with me. the noises
were the same and one time it sounded like someone was jumping on one of
our beds and we could hear heavy running back and forth...it was something
i know i wont forget.</b>
<br><b>third story: this story happened to my dad, after he told me it
freaked me out bad. the day went the way it normaly does and it was getting
late so we all decided to go to bed. we were all sleeping when my dad woke
up and saw my little sister standing at the end of his bed.( this wasnt
something new she would get scared at night easily and come to his bed)
But then he noticed something that made his hair stand up....my sister
was floating! she was about 4 or 5 inches off the floor! Her eyes were
wide open and at that point my dad noticed she was as pale as and sheet
of paper..even her nightgown was white! My dad didnt know what to do he
sat up and asked what was wrong, but she never answered. my dad stood up
and told her that he was going to take to her bed and when he walked to
her she was back to normal. It freaked my dad out a bit. the next d he
asked my sister if she remebered it and she as hard as she tried she couldn't.</b>
<br><b>Well i have lots more stories that i love to share but i'll tell
them another time. Thanx for reading!</b>
