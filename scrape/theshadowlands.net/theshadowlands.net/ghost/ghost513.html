<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Ghost Story of my
Childhood<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">By:<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I recently came
across your
website, and decided to share my story with you, because it is
something that
has always perplexed me. I was wondering if you could maybe help me
out. When
we were small, my brother and I, we lived in a house that my parents
built in
1980 on a newly developing area of Miami.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They used to give wonderful parties and had us both in that
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They got divorced when i was 4, my
brother 3,
the reason being that my father became ill and became life threatening.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the three of us, my mother and my
brother and I from then on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a child,
I remember being extremely afraid in my room. Our house had two stories
and we
had three rooms on the top floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
night, I used to be very afraid that something would come out from
under my
bed, and slept against the wall. My brother was in the other bed.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I have recollections of seeing a figure by
the room door at night, it was dark, but sort of shaped like a man who
looked
into the room sort of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I would have
to go to the bathroom, I would have to get up in the dark and go to the
door,
and go down the hallway to the bathroom. I would be very afraid of
doing that,
and I would never go back to the room, always into my Mom's room and
sleep with
her, bc I didn't want to go back to my room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Almost every night, she would have to "sit" in our room until
we fell asleep. As soon as she left, I would wake up, and cover my head
with my
sheets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was also another room next
to mine, which was the guest room. It was empty, had a bed, a desk,
etc. But
for some reason, I hated being in that room. I would never go in, and
when I
did, I would feel extremely uncomfortable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We also had a big snake problem, since our house was on a newly
developed area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Huge snakes would come
into the garage and onto the back porch, and my Mother would kill them
bc she
was afraid they would reproduce or bite us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Also, another time, our dog started barking like crazy during
the day at
a tree in the empty lot next door, and when we went outside, there was,
believe
it or not, a Koala up in the tree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
thing was very mean. Animal control came and took it, and said that it
was
probably escaped from Metrozoo, and that also it looked rabid. I have
no idea
why that thing was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My brother and
I recently talked about these things in our room and our childhood
during
conversation, and he told me that he would also see the figures in our
room,
and said that they came from out of the closet, and one touched his
face when
he covered it with his heets. They weren't harmful or anything, just
disturbing
to us. He said it was always the closet. I also got sick in that house
and
stopped walking for years. I developed a muscular deficiency.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother had tried to sell the house for
about two years in 1992. People would come in and leave right away. She
had a
secretary that would never go past the living room for some reason.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother, though, never saw or felt
anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1992, we stayed under the
stairs for the hurricane to pass. It was as if the house was exploding,
the
noise was so horrible. Wind noises, howling wind, things flying,
dropping, the
reason being the windows from both sides broke and a sort of suction
was
created and our living room furniture ended up in the lake.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>When it was over, we stepped out of the
house, and never went back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the
storm, however, my mother found many strange things on top of the
kitchen
cabinets after they fell down. They were sort of herbs tied with
colored
ribbons, and other things that people which pratice Santeria use. She
had no
idea who had put them there; a few years back, though, she had found
three huge
steel nails under her statue of the Baby Jesus.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My Grandmother, my father's mother, Im sorry to say, practiced
Santeria
at times. Not professionally or as a religion, but for her
superstitions and
also wished badly upon people at times.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Anyway, after the hurricane, the insurance paid for the house,
and we
moved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got better, my Mother got
better work, we were happier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of my
relatives bought the dilapidated house and rebuilt it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A few months later, he started having marital
problems. Also, he called my mother and asked her why the house always
smelled
like burning candles. He soon sold the house and also left. A few years
before
we left, my Mother had found out that in the 70s, a small private plane
had
crashed into that lake, and all the poeple aboard had died.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>There was also some rumor about it being
built on a burial ground. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Last year,
after 18 years of not going back there, we drove by just out of
curiosity, and
there was a construction crew. We asked if we could go in, and we did.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>They had torn down a dividing wall, and it
had new marble stairs, a third level put on the house, etc. However, I
went
into my old room, and it was the same, as was the guest room.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked around, and it was just plain as it
could be. After a few minutes, though, I started feeling uncomfortable,
and
wanted to eave, because I just didn't feel right, not in my room, nor
in the
guest room. I dont know why, but I just wanted to leave. Everything
looked
creepy to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My randmother on my
mother's side, refused to go in the house. I never went back there,
except have
driven by.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It still looks ominous to me,
and it still has an empty lot next to it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I dont know what was in there, or why it just bothered others
,but not
my mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">By:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>knittinblonde@gmail.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My family and I
moved from
St. Petersburg, FL, in the summer of 2001, to a small town in Illinois
called
Jacksonville. In South Jacksonville, which is it's own little town, we
moved
into the first house ever built in the area. Sometime during the early
1800s.
It was owned by a very prominent family who helped during the Civil
War. They
moved to Jacksonville, to what is now an art gallery. But not before
some of
the family died in our house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
upstairs had not been used for 20 years up to our moving in. It was
cold and
drafty up there. There was some old furniture. The activity did not
start until
we started construction on it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A couple
months after we moved in, we'd all be fast asleep, then be woken
suddenly by a
loud crash. We have this large chandelier in the foyer. The crash
always came
from the foyer. Mom and Dad would go to see what it was, and nothing
would have
happened. That went on for a couple weeks, but not since. I was alone
in the
house about a year after we moved there. It is very big, and very dark
at
night. I was watching tv in on part of the house when I started hearing
whispering. Loud whispering of a man. I knew none of my family was in
the
house, so who was whispering? I called my dad, who said to go see what
it was,
but keep him on the line. I went into the front living room of the
house, and
the whispering started up on the second floor. Someone started pacing
up there
as well. I went upstairs, no one was there, but then someone was
walking on the
front porch. I turned on all the lights in the house and cranked the tv
volume
up high until someone got home. Dad still doesn't believe me, but Mom
does.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About six months after we moved in,
Mom was
putting away laundry upstairs in one of the bedrooms. She heard a
little girl
call out for her mother, not in distress though. Mom turned around and
a little
girl in 1800s dress came skipping towards and past Mom. A woman was
sitting in
a rocking chair on the other side of the room, watching the little
girl. That's
the last we've seen of the little girl, but we have heard the woman up
until
now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The woman likes to pace, around 11
pm for about an hour, between the kitchen and the formal dining room.
She just
paces. Around midnight, the man will start whispering, and I've heard
the woman
as well. My bedroom is in the basement, and we have hardwood floors, so
I hear
pretty much everything. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And
recently,
within the last two months, there has been a new entity in the
basement. My
brother does leather working as a hobby, and has his tools in the room
next to
my bedroom. Just before I go to bed, between 11 pm and 1 am, a banging
like my
brother is working on leather will come from that room. I have heard it
walking
into where I am laying, and rustling papers and such, even shaking my
bed. I've
felt it watch when I do my rituals (I'm Pagan), and that freaks me out.
I don't
like it when they just watch. It would be better if they just showed me
themselves and then I'd know they were there. Not knowing where it is,
if it's
on my bed, or if it's standing right behind me. That makes me feel
unsafe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other spirits I know would
never harm me,
I've never gotten that vibe from them, but this one I'm not so sure. My
brother
is having his room re-decorated, but when he moves out of my room
upstairs, I
plan on moving back upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">First of all I have
to say I
never believed in this stuff and NEVER would have believed anything on
your
site or any ghost story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am now a
believer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard with my own ears!!<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I was awakened at 5:00 am to children
laughing and giggling upstairs and running across the hardwood floor.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>It went on for so long that I called the
front desk to very politely complain that they were so noisy I could
not get
back to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vickie (front desk clerk)
checked and told me that there was just a single gentleman in the room
above me
and that she would send Security upstairs to check it out anyway.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I apologized as I never complain about
anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have 3 children myself and
of all people, I understand children playing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But for some reason this was exceptionally loud and almost
intentionally
annoying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So a couple hours later, about
8:30 am, I spoke to the front desk clerk on my way out and explained
what
happened earlier in the morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
said Vickie had left at 7 am and she reluctantly agreed that many
guests before
me had heard similar children's voices and that there were no children
in the
hotel <span style="">&nbsp;</span>that night and it was not hard
wood on the 4th floor. As I was hearing the small pitter patter of feet
on hard
wood earlier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stayed in Room 301 when
this happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And I assure you I sleep
like a log so for this to wake me up, they were loud.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And I heard them continuously for 30 mins
before I called the front desk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I noticed that you
only had
one ghost hunting in Caldwell,TX ..Well let me tell you about my Ghosts
experience. It's in a house that my parents own...still till this day.
It was
there very first house as a young couple in a small town. we use to
share a bedroom
at a rent house beside my aunt. A one bedroom house for 4 people. So
you could
tell the excitement of having there very own house of 4 bedrooms,large
backyard,kitchen,living room,restroom. When I was 6 or 7 till this day
I can
feel the feelings when I first walked around the house. It felt like
something
was in the house and someone was staring in my face looking at me up
and down
head tilting wondering who I was and what we are doing there ....well
the first
night we sleeped there I had the big room in the middle of the house
and in
front was a door to the kitchen (that I would leave open) and on my
left a
hallway to restroom and my parents bedroom in the front and on my right
my big
brothers bedroom which he always closed the door on me..I wanted it
open
because at night is when I get scared. It would start off with scary
dreams
..Like me getting killed by thugs from the block . They would tie me up
and cut
me with broken glass and put a gun to my head. or sometimes it would be
me
alone in the house and they would jump the fence and try to get in the
house.
They even hurt my mom and brother. Then the dreams would wake me up and
once I
would be awake I'll try and keep my eyes open but some how I fall
asleep....then after a month I started to hear noises and not wanting
to go
into the kitchen ...I cryed one time telling my parents I don't want to
go in
(at night was the worst) and get whatever they wanted out of the
kitchen. My
mom told me just keep the door open and go in...my dad said " shut the
door
and just go" so I look at my mom and she said " shut you eyes and
just run in and turn on the lights" well even then I can see them with
my
eyes shut. So then it went from kitchen and noises to the BATHROOM! at
anytime
of the day mostly night and mid-day I would go to the restroom and
close the
door on the back of the door there is a mirror and when I look at it I
would
see 3 faces (male) look at me laugh and point. so after awhile I would
leave
the door open to the restroom. Till this day I still do that. Now after
awhile
I had experience strange feelings,dogs barking like crazy at
night,hearing
restroom faucet go on , toilet flushing, light turning on and off. And
then the
big thing. One night I woke up scared from a bad dream. I had a
nightlight on
and I was still scared. I curled up in my bed and I hear sand dripping
thru and
hour glass and then I hear footstep getting closer, I hear the clock
ticking .
Then I hear banging so loud in the the kitchen and the footsteps got
louder and
I was so scared I put the covers over my head shaking. Then some how I
told
myself "stop being scared just look and it will be gone" I hear then
the knob turn and the door opens. I tear the cover off of me and I see
a lady
draped in a white gown with lace she was standing in the doorway and
looked at
me ...she walked closer to me with her hands out. She was beside me
reaching
out towards me , to grab her hand. I stood up and screamed for my mom
and my
mother did not come I screamed aging for my dad and he ran towards
me...I told them
what happened they searched the whole house and outside and found know
one
there....That night I went to sleep with them. I was scared for my
brother bc
he was alone in his room which is connected with mine. He told me in
the
morning he saw the hallway lights,restroom lights and toilet go off and
on....The next morning my mom changed my room to the very back. She
also asked
my to religious aunts to pray over me . The first time it did not help
so we
went to my other aunt and she poured holy water over me and blessed me
. That
worked. ! but I still felt that they where still watching me, heard the
dogs
barking,bad dreams, and scared of the kitchen. My dad had got a job
offer after
2 months of me getting blessed and we moved!!! that was the best day
ever. We
moved to Round Rock,TX right beside Austin,TX. They ended up putting
that house
for rent. Well the people that moved in there one of the guy's ended up
taking
the big room (the one I saw the lady) and he left after 1 month because
he said
" I see things moving, hear noises, and saw someone in the
room""something is in the house" . So after them my brother
moved in the house to rent from my parents he to only stayed for a
couple of
months but in those months he said " I heard lots of noises , tolilt
flushing,things moving. After he moved out they started to do
remodeling and
yet they have not finished. They say " one thing after another" But I
think it's the sprits in the house making it take so long to remodel.
One day
when my brother was renting the house from them my Fianc&eacute; ( I
was 21) asked me
"are you sure you want to stay the night in the house I can get a hotel
room" I said crying " no ...I'm going to stick it thru" I cryed
all that night and slept on the living room floor my Fianc&eacute;
stayed up with me and
I had my dog lay with us. Inever been back to that house aging to stay
the
night or walk around in there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My partner and I
lived in a
1910 home in Armory Park Neighborhood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
experienced several apparitions there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One night I got up to go to bathroom and I distinctly heard a
little
girl laughing in the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I
turned on the lights, she stopped laughing.One day I was folding
laundry in the
living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked at the back door
that went into the laundry room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
window on the door is painted white.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I looked I saw what looked like the silhouette of a man
wearing
what looked like a Smokey the Bear hat.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Weeks later my partner brought home a photo of the original
owner of the
house he found at the Arizona Historical Society.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
man was a volunteer firefighter and he
was in his uniform with his hat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon
as I saw the photo I remember saying to my partner, "That is the man
who I
saw in the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The woman who bought

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Haunted Movie
Theater<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My husband and I
and our
three kids used to own and operate a movie theater.It had Harry the
ghost who
we believed was the original owner, he was a prankster, he would pump
the
butter from the butter machine, move the clamps for the movie prints,
show up
as a shadow. He was a nice man, not scary or mean.. altho he did like
teasing
me when I'd be cleaning at night. He would flip down the seats where I
had just
cleaned and flipped them up. Once I had yelled at him he'd chuckle( yes
I heard
it) and stop. The creepiest place was down in basement where the band
used to
be. The rumor was that there were illegal poker games down there, and
it was a
unwelcoming area to say the least. No one on the staff liked to have to
go down
there for supplies.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While we were
there
I had a son who died at 5 months. He spent a lot of time in my husbands
office
or down with me in the ticket booth. Since we literally raised our
children in
the public eye, we knew that everyone knew us and our kids ( even
Christopher)
When he died everyone in town knew and mourned with us. I honestly
don't
remember much of the time then. About a year after he died, Steve was
up in his
office, and he heard a baby cry. If after I had moved the bassinett
down to the
basement he went down and saw that the stuff in the bassinett had been
rearranged. He said he first heard someone come up stairs to the
office, and
when he looked up he saw a man holding a baby.. he can only assume that
it was
Harry holding Chris. It made him cry but also made him come home early.
We lost
the theater in 2000, sadly because the business failed. But we will
always
remember Harry with fondness and our son Chris.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Haunting in
Buchbrunn,

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">By:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>kennedyprocell@yahoo.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">17 years ago, my
parents were
stationed in Buchbrunn, Germany and my mother was pregnant with me. The
house they
lived in was, according to them, haunted. They always describe the
basement and
upstairs room to be the two areas with the most activity. They describe
a sick,
depressed feeling in the upstairs room. Just a feeling that something
bad
happened. My mom refused to go in the basement, because of the feeling
of dread
that would wash over her. In one instance, my dad was out doing PT and
my mom
was locked out of the house. She called one of her army friends (a
large,
highly ranked, male) to help her break into the house so she could get
in. He
broke in through the basement and said said quote "from the moment I
went
in, all that went through my mind was 'GET OUT! GET OUT OF THE HOUSE!
GET
OUT.'" He refused to ever go in the house again. On multiple occasions,
my
mom would have terrible contractions. (way to early I might add) They
would
rush to the hospital and get the contractions to stop for several
hours. Only
to return to the house and have the contractions start again. This went
on
until I was born at 27 weeks, 2 pounds 2 ounces, and almost died. Could
this be
a possible haunting? I'm not sure what the address was...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I
want to add one (not at a private residence)
and correct one. The one to add is as follows: State: Vermont <span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>City: Burlington Location: Bank Street
McDonalds The restaurant is on the sight of a nightclub that burned
down, the
owner and his son inventorying liquor at the time. Neither were ever
found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The closing manager tells of
being with the two other women on shift preparing to start closing
duties. The
restaurant was closed, and had been checked, nobody else was there,
when they
heard a blood curdling scream. Some weeks later, the closing crew had
just left
when a night maintenance man went to start cleaning the basement,
discovering
the empty 5-gallon stainless steel soda syrup tanks stacked in a
pyramid. He
showed the other night maintenance man this, they turned the radio that
was
playing off, agreeing to show the manager in the morning (same manager
as the
closer from the scream incident) and went back upstairs, saving the
cleaning of
the basement till morning. When the manager came in, they went to the
basement,
the full soda tanks were now stacked as well, and the radio was back
on. No one
had been in the basement that whole night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I can attest to the accuracy of this description, as I was the
second
night maintenance man. I was the one who turned off the radio, and
verified
that is was back on, and tuned to static. I could not have accidentally
changed

the only
listing from Winooski Vermont. I went to school at Winooski High School
and
never heard of the haunting events, however, the accident that is said
to have
led to these events is well known. Winooski is an hour south from the
Canadian
border, too far for the drinkers to be coming back from there. However,
the
state of New York had a drinking age at 18 at the time of the crash,
and they
hit a large (and well marked) tree near Sand Bar State Park on the
drive back from
Grand Isle after coming back to Vermont from New York via Rouse's Point
Bridge.
They hit the tree at about 110 miles an hour and basically, shattered.
The
service in the school gym was a real horror, as it was June, hot and
humid. The
students had been celebrating their upcoming graduation. They had been
put back
together with mortician's wax, and in the summer heat, during the open
casket
service, the wax began to melt, with noses and other pieces sliding
off,
including from one of the teens, where it was noticed that the nose he
had was
not his. We were taught about this crash in our classes, including by
one
teacher, who's brother was one of the crash victims. (He had 9
siblings, big
family)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Witnessed A few odd
things
living in a house in Henderson Nevada, had just got home from working
at a
Wendy's down the street, friend was staying there with us (my dad had
just
bought house) had noticed a few cold spots in the house but didn't
think much
of it, friend was sleeping in living room and I went to my room and
went to
bed. After an hour or so my friend came in and asked me if I was
talking to him
a little while before, I told him no and that I had come home and went
to bed.
He layed down on the floor and went to sleep, I fell back asleep as
well. Not
long after I woke up and happened to look towards my friend who was
sleeping
next to my closet (which had mirror doors on it) and I saw what looked
like a
girls face in the middle of the door, I yelled out and he jumped up and
we left
the house and spent the rest of the night at a diner in a casino in
downtown
Henderson. I was later told by some neighbors that years before there
was a
couple (original owners of the house) who had a daughter that was
followed home
one day after work by a co worker who snuck in and killed her,
supposedly the
police found him in the bathroom holding her head while the rest of her
body
had been cut up and scattered through the house. I'm not sure about the
facts
of this story and have done some research but haven't found anything. I
since
moved to California and was told by my dad that he had noticed some
things as
well, like what sounded like running children in the middle of the
night and
said he thought he felt fingers running down his back in the shower. He
no
longer owns the house and all that comes up when putting on the address
in
google search is "families of murdered children". I lived in the
house around the middle of 2001 for only a few months. And my dad lived
there
for a little while longer. I don't know who the original owners are but
according to my dad, they requested that we not repaint one particular
wall in
the hall way (which was a deep red) because the color was picked out by
their
daughter. I've always wanted to go back to the house just to see if I
see
anything again but haven't yet. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My dad lived in
hillsboro,
Ohio which is just next to Leesburg. When he was a teenager, him and a
few
friends went out on Blackrabbit Road when it was snowing. Unfortunately
he got
stuck on the road due to the ice. So he left the group and walked up
the road
to get help. When he was walking he came across a farmhouse in which he
went in
and called the police for assistance. He went back to the car and his
friends
told him they had heard screams and dogs snarling in the trees. When
the tow
truck came, it towed them out and past where the farmhouse that my dad
had used
the phone in... But the farmhouse was not there. My dad took my mom
there later
and they had a similar experience. On October 14, 2011 my parents took
myself
and my sister to blackrabbit road because i did not believe their
experience.
When we were there we went to the place where my dad saw the farmhouse,
and
surely enough there it was, a farmhouse. We continued on down the road
and
turned around, but the farmhouse was gone. We turned around again, and
surely
enough the farmhouse was there again. But the even scarier thing was
what we
found down the road. We were driving slowly by and looking in the
forest when
we saw, deep in the woods, an old 1800s style barn but it looked brand
new. It
wasnt very big and it had an old 1800s style picket fence which also
looked
brand new. But there was no road to it, so we couldnt drive to it. So
we just
examined it from afar. We started to drive away from it and had an
overwhelming
feeling to drive back. So we did and this time stopped and rolled down
our
windows. As soon as we did we heard a loud thump and then sometype of
scream,
so we floored it. But again we went back and this time we heard a loud
scream
coming from a dog so we floored it again. We got 20 minutes away and
once again
had a feeling to go back so we did. When we turned on blackrabbit out
of
nowhere came a giant German Shepard, which scared the pee out of us,
but we
continued on. We did the same as we had been doing cause it seemed to
attract
attention. This time we heard a loud thump and my dad screamed "oh my
gosh, there is a man standing out there". So once again we floored it.
But
we decided to go back one more time out of curiosity. When we went back
my dad
said "look over there beside the barn, dont u see him". And surely
enough there was a silhouette of a man standing there but not moving.
We just
kept staring at him until i told my dad to floor it because out of the
woods
came a giant thing. It looked like a dog but was about 5 times the size
and was
running on all fours. We never went back after that. I am not the only
one to
have these experiences because a singer named lance brewer wrote a song
on
these experiences. When on the road the farmhouse can be spotted near a
ditch
in the wooded area of the road. When next to the ditch look across the
field
and there may be a farmhouse. The barn and fence is a little ways down
the road
past the ditch and in a heavily wooded area.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">For almost a year,
every
night I felt a strange occurrence in my bedroom at night. A feeling as
if
someone was watching me. Little did I know, this would be my first time
dealing
with a spirit. I didn't know what, or who, it was at the time. Every
night, as
I was trying to go to sleep, I felt as I was being watched. It was
something I
had never experienced before. It wasn't normal. It wasn't like someone
was
standing there just looking at me, it felt as if someone was staring me
down
with hate in his eyes. I had a feeling of where this "thing" was
watching me. And on this spot on my ceiling, there was a white spot
there that
I had never seen before. For a little over a year, it watched me. Some
nights
were worse then others. Some nights I would cry myself to sleep,
wishing it
would leave. The worse nights were the nights I were depressed.
Eventually my
fear grew stronger. He would growl deeply into my ear, and did
everything he
could to scare me out of my room. Not long ago, I learned one of my
very good
friends was what some people would call a "medium". I asked her about
my experience. The next day she came to me with an answer. I had a
watcher, by
the name of Micheal. The name sent chills down my spine, and I thought
my heart
would explode when she said Micheal was standing next to me. I asked
more about
him. She said he was a man in his late thirty's, and she told me that
he looked
very cliche' for an evil spirit. Micheal was dressed in all black, a
black
trench coat, black pants, black shirt, long black hair, but one of his
features
really stood out. Micheal, had no eyes. She figured this was the reason
he
watched me. Why me, specifically, she didn't know. She told me she
could get
rid of him. She grabbed my hand and stared off into space. I have no
idea what
she did. After what seemed like an eternity, (but was really 5 minutes)
I felt
an ease over me like never before. I knew Micheal was gone. I felt
happier then
I ever had in my entire life. But, deep down, I felt sad. I felt as if
I missed
Micheal. To this day I still feel his presence every once in a while,
and I
still look to my celeing, to see if the glow of Micheal will return.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

it

</span>chelseycharizard@hotmail.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">So, everything that
I'm about
to tell you is 100% truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I was
about 14 or 15 (17 right now), my mother made me stay in my room and
wouldn't
let me out until my room was clean. I had to go to the bathroom REALLY
bad and
had no clue if I was allowed to come out of my room and use the
bathroom. As
soon as you walk out of my room, the pictures on the hallway wall
reflect into
the kitchen, making part of the kitchen visible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
saw a tall girl in a white dress, with long
brown hair. My mom wears nightgowns, but she doesn't have long hair.
For some
reason, I never quite put that part together and I thought it was her.
I called
out 'mom' at least 4 times, but nobody said anything. So, I just walked
to the
kitchen and nobody was even there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
soon as that happened, I went on the back porch where my mom and dad
were, and
asked my mom if she was just out in the kitchen. She replied 'no, I
haven't
been in the house for about<span style="">&nbsp; </span>half hour.'<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I still never put things together.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When my mom, grandma, and I were on a
short
vacation at 16-years-old, somehow we got on the topic of ghosts. My mom
told us
that one time she was sitting on the back porch, and she happened to
glance
inside and as she did; saw something glide past in the kitchen. Before
she got
to explain what she saw and asked "was it a girl with long brown hair,
in
a white dress?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't think my
mom has ever been that shocked. We talked more about this girl and my
mom has
seen her twice, me; once, my brother and dad saw her once before too.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Another thing, when someone in our house is
alone; we'd hear pots and pans fall. And they'd create a loud noise. My
old dog
(before he died) would run out into the kitchen barking. Anyone would
get up
fast and look in the kitchen, but there's nothing on the ground and all
the
pots and pans are completely normal how they were before.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There's more things that happen in my
basement. Like for right now as I'm typing this, my laundry room door
started
closing a teeny bit. Then when I look back over, it'd be opening a
little bit.
We have NO windows at all in our basement. It's pretty scary, because
that's
where I sleep. And I'm afraid of the dark.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A few months ago I was in my basement and smelled this amazingly
perfume. My mother hardly wears perfume and I know what mine and her's,
smell
like. It was an older-smelling perfume and none of us had it.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>For some reason I said out loud 'Mmm, that
smells really good.' as soon as that left my mouth, the smell started
drifting.
It was drifting towards the television and I could still smell it.
After
smelling it for about a minute, it went away. So, I started walking
back
around. As soon as I did that, the television turned off. (It does that
a lot,
but turns right back on) This time it didn't turn back on. Before I
could go to
turn it back on, it turned on....then off. I started getting a weird
feeling,
but then the light above me flickered on and off. I don't think I've
ever ran
that fast from my basement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Experience<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">By:thraeelddim@gmail.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">At the time we were
living<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in Tacoma, WA. I was twelve and
my cousin was nine at the time. From the moment we moved in we felt
terrified.
Like something was watching us, especially at night. I was sleeping in
one of
the attic rooms with my mum when I woke up in the middle of the night,
seemingly for no reason. But I saw the shadowy figure of a man in the
landscape
portrait on the far wall where there was none before. And he walked
closer and
closer until he stepped down to the floor. I closed my eyes and refused
to open
them until I heard my mum wake up. We felt eerie things from the master
bedroom
and the shed in the back as well. The next door property was equally
terrifying. Someone had been shot there, after two subsequent fires
that
destroyed any additions to the house. From the attic (which there was
no way to
get up to) we heard a rocking chair several times, as well as a piano
playing a
few times. Everyone but me was pushed out of the old apple tree in the
back
yard at least once, which always grew fruit that grew but rotted before
it
became ripe. Eventually my cousin was watching tv when in the
reflection she
saw something slide out from under the hall table. It came closer and
closer,
and the cat started hissing and spitting. It got to the side of the
sofa and my
cousin looked over to see this thing, completely white with big sunken
eyes,
skeletal and on all fours with no conceivable joints except leading to
the
torso. It slowly looked at her and she got up and ran. Behind her the
door
closed and locked on its own. Her mother admitted to seeing the same
thing
once.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the alley behind the house we
saw three dogs- a Chihuahua, a great dane and some other kind I
couldn&#8217;t
identify. Their eyes were glowing red like coals and they chased us the
whole
way to the main street. The alley used to always close up on me and
make me
dizzy and sick and claustrophobic, and I felt like I was being observed
and
even pitied as I walked down it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Years
after we moved away, we went back to see if it was just our
imaginations. It
wasn&#8217;t. One of the neighbors warned us about the place, and then after
it
started to get dark we got that terrible helpless feeling again. We
left,
noticing as we did that the porch light to 6423 had come on. Nobody
lived there
at the time. I found out that day also that it was when we lived in
those two
houses that our families started to fall apart. People started hard
drugs, my
youngest cousin got behavioral problems, My aunt got more and more
short
tempered&#8230; And the next person to live there turned into a kleptomaniac.
That
place changes people, and not for the better.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Memories<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">By: Anonymous<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I am 18. I need to
finally tell
my story. I finally found a place to. When I was 5 I shared a room with
my
little sister who was 2. We had a bunk bed (me on top) and her on the
bottom.
One night I was sleeping and I always have woken up multiple times
during the
night. Don&#8217;t know why, I just do. Anyways, I woke up and was sleeping
on my
back. I rolled over onto my side and saw something bright move like it
ducked.
I looked over the edge and saw a small kid at the bottom of the
ladder.I
couldn&#8217;t tell if it was a girl or guy because it had hardly any hair
and it&#8217;s
face didn&#8217;t resemble either.It looked probably my age or 4. I don&#8217;t
remember
what it was wearing, but it looked like ratty old clothing. It has one
eye and
the other was all blacked out. It&#8217;s head had a big dent like mark on
the side
and the kid looked sad and like it was crying. I was extremely
frightened and
didn&#8217;t want to move. The kid just starred at me and smiled. I remember
I said
&#8220;hi&#8221; because I was too afraid to call my mom who was on the other side
of our
little house. The kid said &#8220;hi&#8221; in a little voice. It sounded like a
whisper,
but I could hear it perfectly fine. The kid walked over to my trains I
had set
up in the corner and sat down next to them. I remember that I wanted
the kid to
go away because even though it wasn&#8217;t going to harm me, it disturbed
me. I
yelled &#8220;MOM!&#8221; and the little kid looked frightened. It disappeared and
my mom
walked in. I told her there was a little kid playing with my trains but
she
just told me to go back to sleep. So I did and I hoped I wouldn&#8217;t see
it again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, when I was 13 I was up
late reading my
little stash of books I had on my bunk. I can&#8217;t remember what book I
was
reading, but I set it down and turned off the book light of mine to go
to
sleep. It was later and I could hear my parents turning off the t.v. so
that
meant they were going to bed. I don&#8217;t like being up by myself, so I
tried to
fall asleep. I heard my parents bedroom door close and I trying in vain
to fall
asleep. I heard my bedroom door open a little bit more than it was
because I
heard a little creak. I looked down but nothing was there. I went to
sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I woke up sometime later that night
and I had
to go to the bathroom. I went and came back. I got snuggled up in my
blankets
and rolled over onto my side. I saw a pale greenish glowing hand on the
top
bunk and then it disappeared. I looked over the edge and I saw the same
little
kid when I was five at the bottom of the ladder. Please believe me when
I tell
you this next part, because no one I have told this to has. I looked at
it and
it looked the same. I still don&#8217;t remember what it was wearing, but
probably
the same thing. It looked at me and it seemed like it recognized me. It
smiled
and waved. I was afraid, yet I didn&#8217;t feel threatened from it. I just
looked at
it. A while before my dad was watching the Sixth Sense and I hear the
part when
the boy needed to confront the ghosts bothering him.I made my dad let
me watch
it and asked him to tell me about it. I thought it might work because I
didn&#8217;t
want to have the kid come back. I said &#8220;why are you here&#8221;. It looked at
me and
it seemed like it thought it over. It said &#8220;I want to play with you&#8221; I
was kind
of shocked. I said &#8220;it&#8217;s too late now. Why not some wear else?&#8221; it said
&#8220;because I like your toys&#8221;[I am just going to list it so I cant make it
shorter]&#8220;who are you?&#8221;&#8220;Sophie&#8221;I didn&#8217;t expect her to say a name.&#8220;oh.
What's
wrong?&#8221;&#8220;My mommy hurt me. My head hurts.&#8221;I was really grossed out by
that
because of the The kid seemed like it started crying.&#8220;what happened to
your
eye?&#8221; I was curious and something made me want to keep talking to the
kid. &#8220;It
got hurt&#8221;&#8220;how?&#8221;&#8220;My momma poked it. The people had to take it out
because it was
hurting.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t remember what that meant, but I was assuming it had
to be
removed.&#8220;are you a ghost?&#8221; she didn&#8217;t answer me.&#8220;where did your toys
go?&#8221;&#8220;I got
rid of them. I got too old.&#8221;( I wanted her to tell me more about her)
&#8220;Why did
your mom hit you?&#8221;&#8220;I spilled my juice on her. She looked pretty and I
got her
gross. I didn&#8217;t mean to! I said sorry&#8221;I felt really bad for the kid
right then.
I knew I had a small stuffed penguin in my closet and I wanted to help
the kid.
&#8220;Do you want a toy so when you leave you can have a toy with you?&#8221;The
kid just
sat there and I still had to share my room and had the bunk bed, so I
slowly
crawled down the ladder because I didn&#8217;t want to scare her. I got the
little
stuffed animal and set it on the ground and crawled up my ladder. She
picked it
up. &#8220;are you going to come back again?&#8221; &#8220;no. thank you. bye.&#8221; She
walked out of
my room and I just laid awake the rest of the night and wondered if she
would
come back. I wrote down most of the conversation in one of my books so
I wouldn&#8217;t
forget. I may have missed a few things, but it is pretty accurate. I
never saw
the little girl again, nor my stuffed animal. One day my mom and I were
going
through my room and she asked where my penguin went. I just told her
that I
didn&#8217;t know and maybe one of my cousins took it or something. We kind
of
shrugged it off, but I wanted to share this experience because when I
was 14 I
got out of the shower and the mirror has condensation on it. It had a
little
&#8220;thank you&#8221; in the corner. I thought my sister did it but the door was
locked
like always. I don&#8217;t think I will ever forget the little girl. I have
had
several dreams about her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My husband, Larry,
left for
hunting about 5am a few days ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
poured a cup of coffee and watched the news in leisure...had a good
morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Got our boy, Kenny, up @ 6am
and he had his b'fast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He and I got
dressed then off to the bathroom...the dogs were at their usual place
facing
the front door, laying down on a rug right down the hall from us
(mopey, as
they didn't get to go with Daddy).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
putting toothpaste on Kenny's toothbrush and I heard the dogs jumping
up and
down (not barking) and someone (I thought it was Larry) said a
distinct,
"HI !" (to the dogs).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not
loud, not soft, not much inflection...just a man's voice, "HI."<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought it was unusual for Larry to be back
since he was quite eager for his hunting trip, then I thought he forgot
something important (over an hour has passed since he left).<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>When I move from the bathroom to the hallway
where the dogs are, NO ONE WAS THERE; they are looking around, kind of
confused;
I am feeling the same way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had turned
the TV off before this to get Kenny into the bathroom and the radio was
off;
all was quiet as Kenny was brushing his teeth...that still leaves why
the dogs
were jumping up and down (joyously, like Daddy was home)...<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>the hair is standing up on my arms and then I
check the front door: locked...dead bolted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I check the back doors: also locked...dead bolted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Creepy.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">It was in 1983 and
I lived
off of Percival Rd. Columbia, S.C. My husband (at the time) was living
paycheck
to paycheck in a small shack looking house that was barely enough for
one let
alone 2 grown adults. I was working at Bojangles on Forest Drive.
Columbia,
S.C. and I had to get up around 4am in the morning to get ready for the
morning
shift.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the alarm rang, I opened my
eyes to reach over and turn off the alarm and it felt like I bumped
into
something. My husband yelled at me to turn off the alarm so I try to
get up
again. As I looked to get to the alarm clock, there was a dark, heavy
set male
figure in front of me. All I could see was like the waste on up. I was
just
thinking it was the morning and I still am half asleep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As I try to get up, I'm knocked back down.
I'm like what the world is going on. Once again, I look up and the full
figured
man is still there and reaches out to touch me. Well, I started to
scream and
scream saying there is someone in the house. My husband said "What the
Hell", I screamed again, There is some man in the house. (I was under
the covers
with my face covered and shacking like leaves on a tree on a windy day)
My
husband leaped out of bed and ran throughout the house which only had a
small
kitchen small living room and a bathroom with just a sink, toilet and a
stand
up shower..Well, I wasn't good for the rest of the day... It never
happened
again but we moved out not long after that...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">hi my name is
Alisha, i am 20
years old and i have a a-lot of paranormal experiences myself.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>they all started when i was really young. i
have an older brother, we both believe my mom is cursed. she had my
brother on
friday the13 in 1988 and i was born in 1991, i was born 666. 6 lbs, 6
ounces at
6 am.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">to start with the
stories, i
was around like maybe 3-5 years old. i have a playmate her name was
Elizabeth,
i called her Lizzy for short, she was also around my age maybe a little
bit
older but she was my best friend. my mother never ever saw here. (i
don't
really remember any of this, i was told all of this by my mom) but she
was
always nice to me and was my best friend, one day i told my mom her
name and
her last name i really couldn't pronounce the last name, out house is
very very
old back in the 1900's it was built.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my
mother checked the deed to see who all the owners have been and it
states that
there was a family who lived there who had a daughter around my age and
the
very name and a similar last name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>then
my mother has seen two children cross from my brothers old room to her
bedroom.
there was a birthday going on for my brother all the kids have gone and
she
told my father to go into the bedroom to look and he said that there
were no
kids in there. there have been multiple sightings of those kids when we
were
younger now that we are older those spirits have left.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>after that we have been having our heavy oak
door open by its self, and the dogs barking for no reason at a door way
or a
window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my mother has a few brothers who
have passed away and we think it was them because they were always over
and were
always welcome.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>when i was 15 years old
i had a friend die in a car accident. and my birthday was not far from
the
funeral. i went to sleep the previous night and i had a dream about my
friend
kevin he was 16 when he passed. he came to me in my dream where black
and white
stripe silk pajamas and he wanted to tell me happy birthday and to have
a good
day. i woke up crying because he was a very close friend, i grew up
with him my
whole entire life, he would always come over on our birthdays and to
swim in the
summer, he was telling me good bye and happy birthday. i miss him still
to this
day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>one day when i was a sophomore in
high school i had a dream about me and my friend going into this one
house and
it was lightning, and storming. we went into the back bedroom to get
flash
lights because all the power was out. i had forgot to shut the screen
door and
the regular door and when i went to go close them i saw this old man
dressed in
a black suite and he was very clean cut and had very white hair. he had
his
arms behind his back and he was walking very slowly to the door. i
could not
scream in my dream all i could do was back away and fall onto the couch
in
horror. next thing i know is that my mother is bursting into my room to
see
what is going on and i told her nothing that it was just a dream. when
i talked
to her later that day i asked what i had done for her to come into my
room like
that and she said that i had been screaming bloody murder.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>then when i started dating my now husband we
moved into his parents home and started taking over payment on the
house, and
there is a tomb stone on the 5 acres of land and the head stone reads
Abraham
Wilson. he was born and died on Christmas day. in the 1800's. for the
time that
he had lived there we always heard talking and what sounded to be like
out TV
on and a radio always on. when we would go out into the living room
there would
be nothing on at all. one night my husband got up to get a drink and he
walked
into the living room and there was a figure of a man sitting on our
couch and
it had asked him where he was going... he said into the kitchen and the
guy
laughed and disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>all of our
friends are very afraid to go into our back yard because you can see
red
glowing eyes follow you and you will see figures following you and
trying to
mess with you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in my mothers house again
there were alot of incidents where you would be in the bathroom and no
one
would be in the house and you would be hearing knocking on the door or
loud
laughter. i was always afraid to go to bed with all the lights off
because
there were always shadowy figures in the house. i would always sees
faces and
figures in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i have several,
several stories i can share if you want to know more just let me
know... thank
you for letting me share these with you. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hi, my name is Jodie<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>from NC. I wanted to share my story with you
guys about an experience I had back in 2003 after my cousin, Scott<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>passed away. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>I
haven't seen any shapes or figures in the
shadows because this spirit is one of the good ones! And<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I think he does not want to communicate with
me in that way. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Me and my cousin were
very close,much like brothers are. So I feel we had that special bond <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">created that was
still there
after his passing in 2003.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He passed
away from injuries sustained in a Tough Man Boxing Contest in SAGINAW
MICHIGAN(remember this name). <span style="">&nbsp;</span>After his
match he was taken to a hospital in Saginaw Michigan where he layed in
Coma for
nearly a month, he never moved or spoke one word during this time.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, I was at home in NC waiting to
hear any news from his family. At this time I had just sustained a
massive knee
injury and couldn't travel up to see him in Michigan. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>All
this time I kept having these crazy sick
feelings at night all over me like he was there with me telling me
things are
going to be ok, it's almost time to go! Then I would wake up in a cold
sweat
every time. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>But these visions were so
vivid it seemed like he was whispering in my ear. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>I
think he was trying to tell me it was his
time to pass on and to make that connection with me for further
contact. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>And
in
January<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he passed away from a blood clot
that moved from his abdomen up into his heart when they were trying to
set him
up because he had said something to his dad about water, and being
thirsty.
After his passing was when the really weird stuff started happening at
my
house. Before Scott had went and fought his Tough Man fight at Saginaw
Michigan
I had hardly ever even mentioned that cities name but maybe 1 time in
my entire
37 years of living. But now all of a sudden it started showing up
everywhere I
turned around. The first place it had showed up was in a subscription
of my
Sports Illustrated that I had sitting on my table. I was watching Tv
one day
and gently reached up to grab the magazine and a cool breeze came
across me and
blew open the magazine to a page and as I got to reading the story , it
was
about a superstar athlete from SAGINAW , MICHIGAN. I was like OK...that
is very
weird. I just played it off to being a coincidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So as the weeks went on and I just had
started thinking about him more and more and this is when the TV would
start to
turn on and off all by itself. Just out of the blue it would turn on
late at
night and cut off before I would get up to check on it.And trust me I
checked
everything about it to make sure something was not turning it on. And
there was
nothing that was there to turn it on! The more I got to thinking about
this over
time I realized it was him trying to get my attention. This would
happen at
night like about 12-2am, this is when he would call me sometimes from
Texas
where he lived at the time before his death. This went on for a couple
of
months until I got back into my normal routine again. Then it subsided
for a
while and would happen from time to time again. Other instances where
the City
name would come up is when memories of Scott<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>would just pop up into my head and in a matter of minutes
something around
me would be related to or directly mention SAGINAW, MICHIGAN and I
would get
cold tingly feelings like something moved around or through me, but it
was
always in a good way or good feeling.Another example of this was one
early
morning I was up drinking some coffee and got to thinking about him and
in a
commercial somehow SAGINAW MICHIGAN was mentioned in the commercial.
And it
just made me smile! At no time was any of these actions ever scary to
me,
because I knew what was going on and could feel Scott's presence or
spirit near
me.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He was there telling me it was
ok
and he was ok! Move on and keep the memories we had!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And still today I have these experiences with
SAGINAW MICHIGAN and every time i hear it or see it this feeling of
cool air
runs literally through me and around my bones and akes my hair stand up
on end
because I know it's him! <o:p></o:p></span></p>
