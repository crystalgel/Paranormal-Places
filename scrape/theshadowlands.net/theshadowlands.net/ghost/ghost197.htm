<br><b>ICY</b>
<p><b>By: MORGANHARBOLDT12@prodigy.net</b>
<p><b>This all began three years agon (1998). My friend Jessie told me
she had</b>
<br><b>seen a ghost in her house, and I didn't believe her at all. Until
that</b>
<br><b>night. I was lying next to her in bed when all of a sudden I got
the</b>
<br><b>coldest feeling , even though it was summer and their air conditioner</b>
<br><b>had broken down. I turned over to face the wall, and out of the
corner</b>
<br><b>of my left right eye, I saw a figure right before my head hit the</b>
<br><b>pillow. I cocked my head to one side, and it was still there. It
was a</b>
<br><b>woman, maybe 19 or 20, with long blonde hair and bright, icy blue
eyes</b>
<br><b>(Hence, our nickname for her). Her dress was once white, but had
turned</b>
<br><b>a sickly blue-green, like she had been drowned. Even her skin had
blue</b>
<br><b>hues.</b>
<br><b>This freaked me out real bad. The next morning I told Jessie about
it.</b>
<br><b>She hadn't told me yet what her ghost looked like, and when I told
her</b>
<br><b>what I had seen, her jaw dropped and she said, "Yep, that's her."</b>
<br><b>For the next two years, I dreamt about ICY every night. We pieced</b>
<br><b>together the story of her death based upon each of our dreams: ICY's</b>
<br><b>real name was Isabelle Caroline Young, and she lived in Muskegon,</b>
<br><b>Michigan. On December 14, 1985, her school held a dance. Her boyfriend</b>
<br><b>got bored, so he took her up to a point, sort of a cliff, that</b>
<br><b>overlooked a lake. She then decided that this was the right time
to tell</b>
<br><b>him that she was pregnant, but she didn't know if it was his. See,
her</b>
<br><b>uncle had raped her, and she might be carrying his baby. But before
she</b>
<br><b>could say anything, a dark figure knocked her boyfriend out cold
with</b>
<br><b>the butt of an axe. Isabelle tried to scream for help. She jumped
out of</b>
<br><b>the car, and started to run, but the figure hacked her with the
axe 42</b>
<br><b>times. He then tied her body to a rock and dropped it and her into
the</b>
<br><b>lake.</b>
<br><b>I discovered this only because when I went up to muskegon, I recognized</b>
<br><b>the same lookout point only about a mile from my dad's cabin. Plus,</b>
<br><b>while stranded on a raft one day, I saw a rock with a chain at the</b>
<br><b>bottom of the lake.</b>
<br><b>I only dream about ICY sometimes, but I think that our best friend,</b>
<br><b>Misty, is ICY reincarnated. She looks like ICY, except for the blue</b>
<br><b>eyes, and her birthdate is december 14, 1985. Oh, and I forgot to</b>
<br><b>mention that ICY is related to Jessie; it's jessie's great-aunt.</b>

<br><b>I Have an Experience</b>
<p><b>By: llacy@pacwest.net</b>
<p><b>My friend Adalina and I were at my house a friday night watching
a show called the scariest places on earth. We wanted so much not to be
scared as we really were so we started telling eachother we didn't believe
in ghosts and that that was a bunch of foolish stuff for people to believe.
Now, you don't know this yet but my house is older than it seems and it's-haunted.
Three ghost are supposed to haunt my house and I've experienced them so
i know it's true. All the sudden I realized what i had done and got extremely
scared when i felt chills go up and down my spine and felt like i was being
watched. My friend got cold but didn't think anything of it. All the sudden
a from came into view but vanished just as quickly as it came. I have since
experinced that several times and trust me you have never experienced a
ghost it's truly bone chilling.</b>

<br><b>River Phoenix</b>
<p><b>By: crowfemale@hotmail.com</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is very hard to tell my experience to someone because
I was afraid if people did not believe me. I kept this secret a very long
time to myself. I had an experience about this young actor named River
Phoenix. When I first use my ouija board, i thought I was talking to my
other spirit friend. But something had change and my spirit friend did
not came back. I got scared for a minute and I ask this spirit who are
you? He said my name is River Phoenix and I need your help. I actually
got shock at first. I truly believe that he is River Phoenix because that
night got very cold, and I saw a white shadow in a dark. Then it become
clearly, here he was he has long blonde hair by his shoulder, green eyes,
he was 5'10'' tall.&nbsp; He told me he could not rest in peace and he
wanted me to help him. River, had save my life when I thought I was going
to died when I had my breasts operation. I saw him for the first time,
before he even contact me when I was using the ouija board. He said to
me that God has send him down here with me to help me and for me to help
him finish his unbusniess. It was very amazing experince i have with River
Phoenix and it is still going on. I see him in my dreams when he going
in the bar and showing me the sign what really had happen to him. He believes
that someone tried to kill him. In my dreams I saw someone putting something
in River's drink and I told him not to drink it because it is going to
kill him. I felt his heart being so tight, i felt him shaking, he could
not breathe. I felt the water splash on his face. Everything was a blur
that when I saw him come out of the bar and fell down on the street and
died. I saw him lift up on the suface and he was seeing his own body on
the ground. He was scared, lost, confuse and he was angry. He did not really
want to die. When I woke up I saw him standing by my window, he came over
to me and I saw his tears. I tried to hold his hands and he felt so cold.
I knew he was trying to tell me something. The dream I had about River
it mean something to me. I honestly believe that River did not tried to
kill himself. I believe that he was murder. I heard River speak to me.
I wanted to write a book about my experince with River but I am too scared
to do it. River wanted me to send messages to his friends and family, but
I have a hard time to do that. I am telling the truth I did saw River as
a ghost. I even light candles for him and I feel him all around me. River
and I had shares so many secrets together and I know alot of River's Dark
Secret that he never told anyone. He was the first one ever told me. In
a way River and I are alike because we both share the same experince what
happen to us. River save my life by an a evil force tried to kill me in
my sleep. River warn me that there is a evil spirit trying to kill me.
River is always there protecting me. I feel like he is my angel. He also
fell in love with me too and I fell in love with him too. If it wasn't
for River, I would be dead, too. So many times I almost died in my sleep,
I was so close to go to River Phoenix. but he keep sending me back. It
was not time for me to die yet. There was a reason why River won't rest
in peace now because he is trying to help me and that he wanted me to help
him to do his unfinished busniess. In a way, I like River around me because
I enjoy his company and I am being there for him now because nobody have
not been there for him when he used to be alive. I am trying to help River
to find some clue but I don't know where to begin. I honestly believe when
it time for me to die, I will be with River because he said he is waiting
for me. One night I felt River touch me, and I saw him move the cup across
from the table, i saw him move the curtians and open the doors and shut
it. I heard his footsteps in my bedroom and i heard him whispering me.
When River touch me it felt so amazing something i won't never forget.
Some ways I don't know how I can help him about his unfinished busniess.
But in a way, RIVER likes being down here with me and he does not want
to rest in peace yet. I know he is lonely, scared, angry, sad, and confuse.
But he knows I am there trying to help him some how. He knows now he is
not alone because I am being there for him now. River knows there is a
demon at my house but not sure how to stop the demon for attacking me in
my sleep. But somehow River keep saving my life. I am not scare but i am
scared of the demon. I still see River enter to&nbsp; my dream and sometimes
it repeat over and over. I am not telling a lie about this, but if i was
telling a lie i would not be writing this now. But what I saw was real
and very incrediable experience I won't never forget. River is still here
with me in my house and he always follow me everywhere I go. I hear him
talk to me in my mind and sometimes out loud. This has been going on since
1995. When I sleep in my bed, I feel River next to me and he touch me.
It amazing feeling. Sometimes I feel him go inside my body trying to protect
me from the demon trying to harm me. It feels so cold when he in my body
and my hands would get very cold. I would sweat during the night sometimes.
River tried to keep me warm. River Phoenix never tried to harm me. But
he always tried to warn me about something what might happen. I don't know
if people would believe my story but it is true what I am saying. River
is my true love and he know he found his true love that is me and he wish
he is alive today to be with me for real. In a way I know it hard to fall
in love with someone who is dead, but it is possible and anything is possible.
River and I love each other alot and we always tried to help each other
one way or the other. But I won't forget the way how he touch me and how
he save my life. River have change my life and he is trying to help my
life get better. How can I contact River's family to send them a message
from River? How can I write my first book about this experince and get
it publish for people who wants to know the truth about River. I wish River
was alive, too. But I know in my heart that he is still alive around me
and his soul will never die. I believe in Ghosts and I had saw them many
times in my life. I grew up in a haunted house and I honestly believe that
some spirits had follow me when i moved a few times. I have so many experince
about the Ouija Board and evil spirits. But I would not forget about River
Phoenix that saved my life. I know that there is something out there and
we are not alone. People can ask me questions and I will try to answer
them. But I do need some help how to contact River's family and friends.
If anyone knew River in real life please contact me at&nbsp; crowfemale@hotmail.com&nbsp;&nbsp;
I need some help where i can find some clues to help River Phoenix to rest
in peace. I also have a little psychic ability. I hear River all the time
talking to me in my mind. I am scared to share my experince about this.
Let me know what you think of my story? Should I write a book about this?
I am very close to River Phoenix now and I am glad that he is here for
me protecting me and I am trying to help him too. Bye for now.</b>

<br><b>Haunted University</b>
<p><b>By: isolda_@hotmail.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I had just completed all my courses for my Law Degree, but I had
to pass my</b>
<br><b>graduate exams, I had been an assistant professor at my University</b>
<br><b>(Universidad Francisco Marroquin, Guatemala, Central America) I
had gotten a</b>
<br><b>special permission to use the premises after normal hours including
weekends</b>
<br><b>and holidays.</b>
<br><b>On weekends, my study partner Maria, and myself would always have
the</b>
<br><b>company of other students cramming for one exam or another, but
mostly med</b>
<br><b>students, the regulars had special permits also, they were studying
for</b>
<br><b>medical boards, and a few pre-meds that were still more interested
in the</b>
<br><b>party scene than in studying, so they would spend all their weekends
trying</b>
<br><b>to catch up for the Monday morning quiz.</b>
<br><b>The day my story happens, is November 1st,&nbsp; All Saints Day,
in my country</b>
<br><b>there is a special dish to eat on this day, besides the visits to
the</b>
<br><b>cemeteries, etc and it is a holiday. I had about 80 finals to grade,
and I</b>
<br><b>had rented 4 movies, but I was way behind my scheduled study program,
I</b>
<br><b>decided it would be wiser to go to school (so I had no distractions)
and</b>
<br><b>grade the finals, catch up on my studying and grab a burger since
I don't</b>
<br><b>eat the traditional dish.&nbsp; Once I got to school, the security
officer told</b>
<br><b>me no one had come in (of the regulars) and that I had the school
to myself,</b>
<br><b>I installed myself in my normal classroom, and I went to work.&nbsp;
Occasionally</b>
<br><b>I would hear footsteps coming towards my classroom, I would look
up, the</b>
<br><b>doors are red with a little square window in the middle, and could
see no</b>
<br><b>one, plus the steps would fall short of my door, during the morning
I did</b>
<br><b>step outside to the restroom, smoke a cig and to check if anyone
else was</b>
<br><b>around, it was already 1:00pm and I was still alone, like I said,
I would</b>
<br><b>hear the footsteps.&nbsp; So I just finished the last exam and my
watch read</b>
<br><b>1:15pm and out of the blue I hear this huge crash and a piercing
scream of</b>
<br><b>pain !&nbsp; My first instinct was to run out, which I did and go
check the</b>
<br><b>architecture drawing room.&nbsp; The regulars were all in the bad
habit of being</b>
<br><b>overcome by tiredness or sleep we'd go into the drawing room and
pull the</b>
<br><b>drawing table to a flat position, climb on top and take a nap (floors
were</b>
<br><b>always cold ) my thoughts were that someone had fallen from one
of these</b>
<br><b>tables and had gotten hurt, I run in flip the lights on, nothing.
By then I</b>
<br><b>got this horrible feeling, I flee back into my classroom get my
things and</b>
<br><b>run upstairs to my car (roof parking lot) I pulled out of school
as fast as</b>
<br><b>I could.</b>
<br><b>The eerie part is that once at home it hit me. A couple of months
before,</b>
<br><b>Maria and I had arrived at school on a Sunday and our classroom
was a total</b>
<br><b>mess, knowing it had been two of the pre-med regulars we barged
in on them</b>
<br><b>in the next classroom and bickered about the mess they made, they
apologized</b>
<br><b>BUT they told us something had happened to them that night. They
had been</b>
<br><b>studying in their classroom one of them had been dowsing when they
heard a</b>
<br><b>loud crash and a piercing scream. Thinking it had been the security
officers</b>
<br><b>that had fallen from the 6th floor they ran out and looked over
the</b>
<br><b>balconies, at the same time, the security officers came running
downstairs</b>
<br><b>thinking it had been them goofing that had fallen. They searched
all over</b>
<br><b>and found nothing.</b>
<br><b>It is also known that the elevator for the second building (floor
3 to 7)</b>
<br><b>moves on its own, opens and closes all the time. There has also
been a</b>
<br><b>sighting of an old man walking on the 2nd floor of the first building
and</b>
<br><b>when pursued will appear on the 6th floor of the second building.&nbsp;
The door</b>
<br><b>fly open on the 6th floor during night watch, and dozens of other
little</b>
<br><b>stories.&nbsp; Needless to say I never went back alone to study
on a holiday.</b>

<p><b>He Was There</b>

<p><b>This occurance happened back in 1983.&nbsp; I was living with a roommate

past the</b>
<br><b>bathroom and the toilet seat was down.&nbsp; Two minutes later I
walked by the</b>
<br><b>bathroom again and the toilet seat was up.&nbsp; My friend John
did not use the</b>

<br><b>I Have a Story to Tell</b>
<p><b>By: Cheshirecat80672@cs.com</b>
<p><b>OK, I have always considered myself sensitive, but after I became
a witch I</b>
<br><b>really noticed it flare up.&nbsp; I was always told I was paranoid,
but you tell</b>
<br><b>me.</b>
<br><b>I moved into my grandparents house about a year after my grandfather
died (we</b>
<br><b>lost them a day apart).&nbsp; Unfortunately I had the last pick
of rooms and I was</b>
<br><b>given the middle room (the same room my grandfather died in), and
with the my</b>
<br><b>luck also got his bed.&nbsp; Well, needless to say to this day I
don't feel</b>
<br><b>comfortable in that room. I had this feeling like I was never alone
in there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;It wasn't a bad feeling, but uncomfortable.&nbsp; Late one
night I woke up from a</b>
<br><b>noise (the foot of my bed faces the closet) I looked at the closet
and my</b>
<br><b>grandfather was standing there looking inside.&nbsp; That was the
last night I</b>
<br><b>spent in that room.&nbsp; This was only one of the many occasions
I happened to</b>
<br><b>bump into him. Two days later I was moved into my grandmothers room.&nbsp;
At the</b>
<br><b>time I was really close to my cousin so she always spent the night.&nbsp;
One</b>
<br><b>night she woke me up and told me to look at the foot of my bed.&nbsp;
This did not</b>
<br><b>surprise me to much because if you stand in that place to long you
start to</b>
<br><b>get light headed and you skin goes numb (well I guess it is only
me, nobody</b>
<br><b>else would do it).&nbsp; At the end of my bed there was a mist.
I know as cheesy</b>
<br><b>as it sounds, but I have several people who will attest to seeing
the same</b>
<br><b>thing.</b>
<br><b>About every four or five days that I sleep there, I have the distinct
honor</b>
<br><b>of hearing my grandfather tromps through the house at 2:03 in the
morning.</b>
<br><b>This wouldn't be so bad except every time I'm awaken I end up wide
awake.</b>
<br><b>I wish this didn't effect me still, but it does.&nbsp; About two
years ago I</b>
<br><b>noticed that there was something much worse than my grandfather
in my house.</b>
<br><b>I don't know exactly when it started because I had moved back in
with my</b>
<br><b>mother, but I had visited my dad shortly after I had become a witch.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>standing in the kitchen doing dishes and I heard the back door open
and</b>
<br><b>close.&nbsp; The footsteps moved up the steps and stopped at the
door of the</b>
<br><b>kitchen.&nbsp; I stopped what I was doing.&nbsp; Thinking that my
cousin had come to</b>
<br><b>see me, I looked up and waited for her to come through the door.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>footsteps stopped at the top of the steps, turned around and went
back out</b>
<br><b>the door, politely closing it behind them.&nbsp; I went to look
and there was no</b>
<br><b>one outside.&nbsp; So I went back to doing the dishes.&nbsp; Keep
in mind the hair on</b>
<br><b>the back of my neck had started to stand on end when the door opened.&nbsp;
Not</b>
<br><b>two minutes later I heard the back door open and the whole ordeal
started</b>
<br><b>over.&nbsp; This time I ran to the entrance way and there was no
one there.&nbsp; This</b>
<br><b>continued about three more times.&nbsp; I was in hysterics, ran
to my room,</b>
<br><b>grabbed the phone and called my friend Sarha, I asked her if she
could come</b>
<br><b>and get me early.&nbsp; I hung up the phone and listened.&nbsp;
There it was again,</b>
<br><b>except this time the footsteps didn't stop at the kitchen door.&nbsp;
They</b>
<br><b>continued through the kitchen, into the hall, to the door of my
room.&nbsp; I felt</b>
<br><b>the room get really cold.&nbsp; This is where my sensitivity kicked
in.&nbsp; I have</b>
<br><b>this knack of feeling what it is trying to tell me or convey.&nbsp;
I had this</b>
<br><b>overwhelming feeling of fear and not so far under the surface a
lot of anger.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;It came into the room and though I couldn't see it, it backed
me up into the</b>
<br><b>corner of my room.&nbsp; I was about to start screaming when I heard
Sarhas tires</b>
<br><b>on the gravel in the driveway.&nbsp; It must have heard my rescuer
to because I</b>
<br><b>could feel it withdraw.&nbsp; At the time I hadn't noticed the drop
in</b>
<br><b>temperature, but when Sarha came running into my room it looked
like she hit</b>
<br><b>a wall.&nbsp; She froze at the door, looked at me cowering in the
corner and asked</b>
<br><b>how long ago it left.&nbsp; I couldn't even speak, I just stood
there shaking.</b>
<br><b>Later on when I was safely at her house she told me that the room
felt like</b>
<br><b>it was about 50 degrees in there.&nbsp; We came to the conclusion
that we had to</b>
<br><b>find some way to get this thing to leave me alone.&nbsp; After one
trip to the</b>
<br><b>local herb shop and a large chain bookstore we had come to the discussion</b>
<br><b>that I had to demand that if it was going to live with me it had
to stop</b>
<br><b>harassing me.&nbsp; Well, not five days later I was once again standing
over the</b>
<br><b>sink when the hair on the back of my neck and arms stood up and
I felt a hand</b>
<br><b>reach out and touch my shoulder.&nbsp; I spun around and started
yelling, well</b>
<br><b>maybe screaming at it is a better description.&nbsp; I told it that
it was not</b>
<br><b>aloud to touch me or sneak up on me.&nbsp; Well, it must have listened
because</b>
<br><b>from that day on it never tried to intimidate me.&nbsp; Although
he has started</b>
<br><b>whispering.&nbsp; Babble, that I constantly tell it I can't real
understand.</b>
<br><b>Unfortunately it sounds muffled, like if you leave a TV on in a
room and</b>
<br><b>close the door.&nbsp; It still continues to whisper if I'm not paying
attention</b>
<br><b>and let my mind wander on with me.</b>

<p><b>Great Grandmothers Visit</b>
<p><b>By:dsanchez@kiva.net</b>
<p><b>I am only sixteen years old but have always heard my house was haunted.
I, being fifteen at the time, didn't believe it. One night about six or
seven months ago, my best friend and cousin were spending the night with
me. In the middle of the night my cousin, who was ten at the time, woke
me becouse she thought she heard noises in my closet. We sat there lisnting
for a good ten menunts but didn't hear any thing. By this time I had to
use the bathroom so I woke my bestfriend to sit with my cousin. While I
was in the bathroom my cousin and bestfriend swear up and down that saw
someone or something part the clothes in my closet and jump out. I didn't
believe them untill three days ago. About two weeks ago my parents and
I moved my room to the basement so that all of us would have are own room.
And just three days ago I was awoke by the sound of footsteps on our basement
stairs, but only thought it was my brother coming to get my phone. After
calling out what he wanted, I realized it wasn't my brother. So I got up
to see who it was but fond no one on the stairs. When I went back to my
room I saw the figure af my dead great-grandmother on the foot on my bed.
I now believe that my house is haunted and won't let people tell me other

<p><b>Never Alone</b>
<p><b>By: IRELANDCLOVER@webtv.net</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had moved into a new house with my parents and the
rest of my</b>
<br><b>family about 13 years ago. It was about 6 years into living in that</b>
<br><b>house that a couple things happened.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I alwys felt like someone was watching me from the
two windows in my</b>
<br><b>room in the attic.</b>
<br><b>I would hear bumps in the night and my mom would tell me it is just
and</b>
<br><b>old house . Well one night I was sleeping in my room in the attic
and</b>
<br><b>about 3 in the morning I woke up wide awake to look at the two little</b>
<br><b>windows at the front of the house. All of a sudden there was a man</b>
<br><b>walking pas the first one to the second one turn look at me turn
again</b>
<br><b>and walk into the dark.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I pulled my covers over my head and stayed like that.
The next</b>
<br><b>morning I awoke to a man wispering in my ear saying a name like</b>
<br><b>corneileo.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just say that I never slept up there again And
I will not go</b>

<br><b>Ghosts in Ireland</b>

<p><b>Hi,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Last summer I went to Ireland. My family and I stayed in
Dromoland Castle.</b>
<br><b>While I was in the basment with a friend I met in my group, playing
pingpong</b>
<br><b>she saw a shadowy figuer behind me, in the halway. I also felt a
coldness and</b>
<br><b>a strange feeling. So we ran upstairs. Very sacry. My sister while
exploring</b>
<br><b>the grounds had a strange feeling in some parts. We also stayed
in some other</b>
<br><b>castles, but no other things happened.</b>

<p><b>I was recently reading some of the fascinating stories on your web
page.</b>
<br><b>After reading them i decided that i would write to you with some
of my own</b>
<br><b>experiences.</b>
<br><b>i have always believed that the supernatural exist, but when i have
tried to</b>
<br><b>tell my experiences to some of my family members i am always met
with</b>
<br><b>scepticism.</b>
<br><b>The first event happened when i was baby-sitting for my aunt. i
was sixteen</b>
<br><b>almost seventeen (i'm 21 now), and i had a regular job baby-sitting
my aunts</b>
<br><b>2 children on a sunday evening when she would go out with her female
friends,</b>
<br><b>and her husband would go to the local social club. Before the experience
i</b>
<br><b>had always had an uncomfortable feeling there, especially her staircase.
the</b>
<br><b>way her home was built was that she had her shower downstairs just
underneath</b>
<br><b>the staircase, and whenever i had a shower i used to get a feeling
that if i</b>
<br><b>didn't run into the sitting room then something was going to get
me.</b>
<br><b>The night that my first experience happened it was just like any
normal</b>
<br><b>sunday evening with me doing homework and then going to bed around
midnight.</b>
<br><b>I must have went to sleep almost at once, then i remember being
woken up by</b>
<br><b>something, it was a noise from downstairs, i looked at the clock
and it was</b>
<br><b>around AM and i just thought it was my aunt returning from her night
out. I</b>
<br><b>also remember my cousin's dog, who had never woken me before in
the months</b>
<br><b>before, was going crazy,barking,running around and growling. Then
all of a</b>
<br><b>sudden the lights to the bedroom hall came on, i lay there pretending
to be</b>
<br><b>asleep because i knew pretty soon that my aunt and uncle would begin
to argue</b>
<br><b>about the time she was returning, and I also didn't want them to
think i</b>
<br><b>would be listening to them. Anyway, something made me peek around
the corner</b>
<br><b>of my duvet, and all i saw was the shape of a person, about 5 '3
and blonde</b>
<br><b>walk into my aunt and uncles room. I just thought it was my aunt
and set</b>
<br><b>about returning to sleep, all of a sudden my uncle stumbled out
of the room,</b>
<br><b>sees that I am awake, and asks 'did you switch on the lights?",
i told him i</b>
<br><b>didn't and because he was half asleep he didn't think anything else
of it.</b>
<br><b>After he switched the light off i had a very hard time going to
sleep after</b>
<br><b>he turned the light off.</b>

<p><b>By: ChicaBalla@aol.com</b>
<p><b>Alright, I have never met either of my grandparents but I think that
I might</b>
<br><b>have seen one after he had passed. One night, I was in my living
room and</b>
<br><b>watching television. My mom was in her room laying down because
she has some</b>
<br><b>really bad problems with her back and is in pain most of the time.
I had to</b>
<br><b>go put my hair up and so I went down the hall to the bathroom to
get a hair</b>
<br><b>rubberband. I noticed my mom's light was off so I went to go shut
her door so</b>
<br><b>not to disturb her, as I reached for the knob I noticed a white
figure on the</b>
<br><b>lower corner of her bed. As soon as I made "eye contact" with the
man on the</b>
<br><b>corner he got up, turned and walked towards the closet and was gone.
I was</b>
<br><b>never afraid or scared just more curiouse. The next day I came home
from</b>
<br><b>school and saw my mother had put up new pictures in our hallway
with those</b>
<br><b>frames with a lot of spots for pictures. There was a picture of
my</b>
<br><b>Grandfather in a white or khaki colored shirt and pant set. I think
it was</b>
<br><b>him just watching over my mother and just seeing how she was doing.</b>

<p><b>&nbsp;First Time</b>
<p><b>By: walnutridge_2000@yahoo.com</b>
<p><b>This is the first time this story has ever been told</b>
<br><b>to anyone outside of our family so I hope that</b>
<br><b>everyone finds it as interesting and chilling as me</b>
<br><b>and my family have.&nbsp; It all started about two years</b>
<br><b>ago when I stayed the night with my sister in her new</b>
<br><b>house in NE Texas.&nbsp; I was lying on her couch watching</b>
<br><b>tv, when out of the corner of my eye I saw someone</b>
<br><b>standing behind me, they were wearing a gray</b>
<br><b>sweatshirt.&nbsp; I just assumed it was my sister and said</b>
<br><b>hi, I then turned back around and there was no one</b>
<br><b>there so I went into my sisters room to see if she</b>
<br><b>wanted anything, she was in the shower!&nbsp; I freaked out</b>
<br><b>so I sat in her room until she got out of the shower.</b>
<br><b>I didn't say anything to her about it because I was</b>
<br><b>afraid she would be scared since she was often home</b>
<br><b>alone as her husband is truck driver.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Two weeks after this inccident my sister and her</b>
<br><b>husband came to our house for a visit.&nbsp; As my brother</b>
<br><b>in law was talking to my father he mentioned that he</b>
<br><b>will be laying in his bed sometimes and out of the</b>
<br><b>corner of his eye he will see someone in a gray</b>
<br><b>sweater standing at the bar in the kitchen and when he</b>
<br><b>gets up to investigate further, he finds no one in the</b>
<br><b>entire house.&nbsp; My father told him and my sister that i</b>
<br><b>had seen the same thing but it seemed to scare my</b>
<br><b>brother in law more than it did my sister.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;On another visit me and my niece fell asleep on the</b>
<br><b>living room floor watching tv, my niece had been long</b>
<br><b>asleep when I began to hear a creaking noise and due</b>
<br><b>to the previous inccedent I automatically decided that</b>
<br><b>it was the rocking chair recliner rocking by itself.</b>
<br><b>I was honestly scared to death, I am 16 and I was</b>
<br><b>afraid to turn around and look.&nbsp; After trying forever</b>
<br><b>to wake my niece she finally woke up I explained to</b>
<br><b>her the situation and told her to run as fast as she</b>
<br><b>could to her mothers bedroom, i also followed and as I</b>
<br><b>was going out I happened to look back and I was right</b>
<br><b>the chair was rocking very fast and by itself.&nbsp; I laid</b>
<br><b>in my sisters bedroom floor for an hour listening to</b>
<br><b>the noise before I fell asleep.&nbsp; The next morning when</b>
<br><b>I told my sister she just laughed and told me I was</b>
<br><b>crazy.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;A few weeks later the man who owns my sisters house</b>
<br><b>came by and wanted to know if she would like to buy</b>
<br><b>the house instead of just renting he then told her</b>
<br><b>,"this house just has to many bad memories for me", my</b>
<br><b>sister also found out later in the same week that the</b>
<br><b>owners son had fallen off the back of a tractor and</b>
<br><b>into the tractor discs and died in her backyard, and</b>
<br><b>there is still an old tractor disc and many very old</b>
<br><b>childrens bicycles behind her shop.&nbsp; There are two</b>
<br><b>rooms in the house that everytime me or my other</b>
<br><b>sister ,who lives in Arkansas, go in them we get this</b>
<br><b>strange feeling of being watched and or followed and</b>

<br><b>FAMILY STORIES</b>
<p><b>By: hum@i-o.net.au</b>
<p><b>These are a few of the things that could be ghosts that have happened
to members of my family.</b>
<br><b>My Grandmother didn't believe in ghosts, they dont fit with the
religion she was taught. My Grandfather died suddenly, at home. My Grandmother
was with him as they waited for the ambulance that didn't get there in
time. The next night and for every night for two weeks he would come back
and hold her till she slept, just as he had for 40 years. The last night
he told her " I cant keep coming here like this".</b>
<br><b>My Mother has no interest in the supernatural, despite the fact
she had pretty regular contact with " ghosts" at her last job. The spirit
of a nurse friend who worked on the ward and died&nbsp; as a patient there
after a long illness was regularly seen making the rounds. There were lots
of ghosts reported in the hospital but this one is the most interesting,
as she was seen regularly by&nbsp; fellow nurses and was recognised.</b>
<br><b>That hospital closed about 5 years ago along with another local
hospital. Since the closures both hospitals have had security guards there
at all times. All the guards I have met have interesting stories to tell
about the hospitals, including the singing in the chapel that suddenly
stops if the chapel door is touched.</b>
<br><b>My husband has had many odd experiences but there haven't been many
of late. The most recent one involved an earring I made years ago. We were
both playing on the computer when he yelped "hey!" .The earring had hit
him smartly on the cheek. We have no idea where it came from, I certainly
didn't throw it and we were the only ones there. Interestingly I recognised
the earring. I had thrown it out 4 houses before.</b>

<br><b>Army Career</b>
<p><b>By: fth@cox-internet.com</b>
<p><b>Here is one experience which I have had second hand information from.
A second will follow. In the early years of my Army career as a Military
Policeman, I was assigned to a small base known as Arlington Hall Station.
This base is located on the intersection of State highway 50 and George
Mason Drive in Arlington, Va.&nbsp; At the time I was assigned to the base,
it was basically your normal, run of the mill, ordinary Army type military
installation. There was a main building from which most of the military
activities functioned, known as Building1 or Headquarters. Strange activities
occurred within this building. The building contained numerous alarms throughout,
and almost upon queue, alarms were activated within, every night, which
we as MPs were directed to investigate and clear. Numerous stories evolved
from such incidents, however I will convey only that which I know personally.
I have always been a skeptic, and I am still somewhat of one, but my first
encounter was during a semi-hourly, nightly security check of the entire
building. The facility consisted of numerous areas which required a Military
Police check throughout the day and night. On this particular night, I
was conducting a security check throughout the building as usual, starting
from the 4th floor and working down. There were large filing cabinets (too
big to move single handedly) which were required to be checked on each
walkthrough. Upon completion of clearing the 4th floor, I was nearing the
completion of clearing a security check of the third floor, when I heard
what sounded like a large filing cabinet (with great weight) being slid
across the floor on the 4th floor. I contacted the main desk on the 1st
floor to verify whether or not anyone was within the building.</b>
<br><b>The person on the main desk informed me that there was noone in
the building. Given the size and weight of most of the filing cabinets
which were within the building (some in excess of 500 lbs) I figured that
whomever it was, was much stronger than I. Upon a second check of the building,
about 50 minutes later, I found nothing out of place.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The second incident occurred while I was providing
security in another building, and I basically heard over the military police
radio and information from those involved in the activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;
On this particular night, within the building which I previously discussed,
there were numerous activities occurring. The MPs working on the desk on
the first floor were experiencing audible sounds in the form of footsteps,
through-out the night. The desk was located centrally within the building.
The sounds which were occurring above the desk were similar to that of
a person walking on a hardwood floor, and suddenly walking on a carpet.
The shift supervisor was dispatched to the scene, and within minutes of
his arrival, the activity occurred.</b>
<br><b>The shift supervisor and his additional patrol immediately investigated
the incident within seconds, and revealed nothing at the top of the second
flight of stairs. During the entire ordeal, a second patrol was driving
outside the building, at which time he observed a woman whom entered the
second floor female bathroom of the building, and appeared to be primping
herself. He called to the main security desk to relay the information,
with a description of a woman in an older type floral print dress, whom
continually enters and exits the bathroom checking herself in the mirror.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; All attempts were made to investigate the occurrences of
this activity. It was never founded.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; The phenomenon which occurs within the building supposedly
originates from a young woman, whom attended a school for females in the
early 20th century, who became impregnated from a stablehand, and committed
suicide due to the fact that it would have brought shame to her family.</b>

<p><b>Jim Come Back</b>
<p><b>By: OWAThrill@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&nbsp; I worked closely with a man in his</b>
<br><b>mid 50's. Was very special to me. He was diagnosed with hemocromotosis,
and</b>
<br><b>underwent a liver transplant. Survived the surgery but never regained</b>
<br><b>consciousness.</b>
<br><b>A couple years later, I was racing some movies to the video store.
As someone</b>
<br><b>who naturally "flies" I was on my way back and still in my "racing"
mood. We</b>
<br><b>lived about 4 miles out this long, dark, curvy at times, road in
Smyrna TN,</b>
<br><b>just south of Nashville. I was in my car by myself, and as I approached
the</b>
<br><b>worst curve on the road, this smell filled my car. Instantly I knew
the smell</b>
<br><b>but couldn't place it. I slowed down, looked around the car, as
best I could</b>
<br><b>since I was still driving, I remember looking in my rearview in
the backseat</b>
<br><b>a couple times, still trying to recall where I knew that smell.
At one point,</b>
<br><b>I rolled down my window to see if it was coming from the outside.
It wasn't.</b>
<br><b>Just past the curve, the thought hit me where I knew the smell from.
My</b>
<br><b>friend, Jim, my co-worker/mentor who had died, had been on some
very strong</b>
<br><b>medicines before his death. The meds created an odor around him
when you were</b>
<br><b>near and his breathe had a certain smell that I'm sure was induced
by the</b>
<br><b>medicine. The smell that I smelt in my car was exactly this. I had
never</b>
<br><b>smelt it before nor after his death. Then the thought, clear as
a bell came</b>
<br><b>to me, Jim had come to me to slow me down on that curve. I swear
this to this</b>
<br><b>day. Needless to say, it was scary, and I raced the rest of the
way home.</b>
<br><b>That night as I lay in bed, I remember looking up in the 4 corners
of the</b>
<br><b>room, saying "Jim, are you here?". I didn't really think so, because
that</b>
<br><b>smell had disapaited just round the curve.</b>
<br><b>To this day, almost 14 years later, I have never encountered it
again. I know</b>
<br><b>without a doubt the smell, as it was "burned' into my memories of
Jim.&nbsp; After</b>
<br><b>it was over, I remember thinking "Jim, come back, I would love to
talk to</b>
<br><b>you", but never another appearance.</b>

<p><b>Story From England</b>
<p><b>By: Angelbaby21ny@cs.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Hello, I live in New York but my story comes from England.&nbsp;
My husband pasted</b>
<br><b>away in July of this year because his mother lives in England and
because of</b>
<br><b>her age his sisters and I though it would be best not to tell her
of his</b>
<br><b>passing.&nbsp; At age 92 we were afraid the news would brake her
heart so badly</b>
<br><b>she would pass as well and since there was so many miles between
them and her</b>
<br><b>hearing so bad they almost never talked on the phone we didn't see
any need</b>
<br><b>at this time to brake this wonderful woman's heart.</b>
<br><b>This story starts a few months ago, his sisters and I are very close
and</b>
<br><b>still speak on Saturday moorings.&nbsp; This one Saturday in Jan.
I called and</b>
<br><b>things went as always asked about the grandchildren and how mother
is feeling</b>
<br><b>and everyone in England.&nbsp; This is when she said, you know mother
has been</b>
<br><b>speaking to our George (this is my husband who has pasted).&nbsp;
I listen closely</b>
<br><b>to what she was saying.&nbsp; This is the funniest thing she keeps
telling me to</b>
<br><b>get her shoes and give them to George we need to go home.....Now
the problem</b>
<br><b>with his it that the home she lives in now is been home for 200
years for</b>
<br><b>this family and she is seeing George as a young boy.&nbsp; My sister
in-law keeps</b>
<br><b>telling her, Mother you know George is in America and he is a man
now ... but</b>
<br><b>she get very dismay with that and just keeps speaking to him as
if he is</b>
<br><b>standing right by her...he was very close to his mother since his
dad passed</b>
<br><b>away when he was 5yrs.&nbsp; and she never remarried....</b>
<br><b>My though on this is I have heard that when you go you return to
the time you</b>
<br><b>were the happiest, is this true.&nbsp; When he was a child he was
very happy is he</b>
<br><b>helping his mother to cross over.&nbsp; The other thing is George
and I had a</b>
<br><b>wonderful live just to short and we cared so very much for each
other in</b>
<br><b>every way.&nbsp; I talk to him everyday and tell him how much I
love and miss him,</b>
<br><b>I have his pictures up in the living room and one on my dressed
and night</b>
<br><b>stand in my bedroom. I miss him so much and want to know it there
is anything</b>
<br><b>I can say or do to have him come to me.&nbsp; I have been told he
will come when I</b>
<br><b>am ready I want to be ready now. To be able to seen him even in
my dreams</b>
<br><b>would be the best for me.&nbsp; It makes me so sad that IM not seeing
him in my</b>
<br><b>dream, I though I did one night and wanted to open my eyes and couldn't
so I</b>
<br><b>let out a loud noise and the feeling was gone, this made me say
I wish he</b>
<br><b>would come back if for only one more time.</b>

<p><b>Hey Dave, I enjoy your site, it comforts me that this isn't just
happening to me!</b>
<br><b>I'm 19 years old now and I lived in my old house for 15 years. The
house was fine, it was the road that was the problem. The road is called
(# 1 side road) A.K.A (RR#1) In Burlington Ontario, Canada. The road is
about 2km long and has lots of hills with a total of 6 houses on it.</b>
<br><b>It all started about 12 years ago,I would be about 7 yrs old. I
had a dream about two girls (sounds pretty good so far) who destroyed their
dads new Jag and were both killed as their car hit a tree in the bottom
of the ditch. About 2-3 days later I woke up to the sound of sirens from
Emergency vehicles. When two girls shopping for fathers day crashed their
dads new car on the road and both girls were killed in the accident. The
road has about 10-20 foot ditches and the girls lost controll and went
down the ditch and ended up in an old tree, destroying the car and taking
their lives.</b>
<br><b>After this accident every now and then when my parents would drive
down the street you would see a car coming towards us in the distance,
as it got closer we would be going over the hills and loose sight of this
car every few seconds, it would appear to veir off the road and disapeer
as we went down the hills. This freaked me out a lot!</b>
<br><b>5 years later ,6 teenagers driving down the street lost controll
of their vehicle went through the ditch rolled upside down and hit a tree,
the car burst into flames, the driver and front passenger got out alive,
but unforchanatly the 4 people in the back of the car screemed for help
as they burned alive in the car. All the neibors tried franticaly to save
the peoples lives but being a chemical fire (the gas) it was hopeless with
only a few fire extinguishers. The 4 people in the car died. Another man
driving his pick-up truck down the street exactly one year to the date
(June 11th) at night, when his truck burst into flames, he swerved off
the road into the ditch and was killed as he hit a tree and was thrown
through the windshield. The father of the one teenager who died in the
burning car commited suicide in the same spot his son died 5 years to the
date.&nbsp; To add to this nightmere Kristen French a victom off Paul Benardo(sereal
rapest and killer) was found on #1 side road in the same spot where the
first two girls were killed in the car accident.</b>
<br><b>At a later date I had to do a project for my school on the street
we live on, we had to find out when it was built, who it was named after
ext...</b>
<br><b>I found out the street was oringinally a driveway for a farmer who
owned all the property in the 1800's. The farmer was accused of killing
his wife and daughter, they found the body of his wife but still to this
day never found the body of the daughter. The farmer was convicted and
was hung in the nearby town of Milton. The ruins of the house are still
there, they were located at the edge of our property line on the other
side of the fence. Many people say that the body of the daughter was buried
under the road, we have since sold the house and moved last year 2000.
Another odd thing about the road is that all the trees along the road seem
to be dead, all the trees in the nearby forests are alive and healthy.
Is this all a coincidence or is there a disterbed spirit, what it was i
do not know. If anyone has any answers E-mail me at PORNSTAR200069@hotmail.com</b>

<br><b>Did Grandpa Come to Visit?</b>
<p><b>By: SNA1997@cs.com</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a story told by a cousin of mine.&nbsp; I believe
what she said is</b>
<br><b>true because it just didn't happen to her but my mom also. Here
is my</b>
<br><b>cousin's story:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My grandpa passed away in Dec. 26, 1991, by not
of natural death, but by</b>
<br><b>a horrible death...he was murdered.&nbsp; My grandma had witnessed
this and we are</b>
<br><b>very lucky that she had made it through the horrible trauma.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The night my grandpa was murdered, my cousin,
we'll call her jen, had</b>
<br><b>just came home to an empty house after a band practice.&nbsp; She
was even</b>
<br><b>wondering where everyone had gone.&nbsp; Without knowing her family
had left to go</b>
<br><b>to my grandparents house because of my grandpa just being murdered.&nbsp;
She</b>
<br><b>decided to lay on the sofa in the living room and watched t.v..</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 10pm the phone rang and this jilted her
off her nap.&nbsp; Jen answered</b>
<br><b>the phone but nobody was there, just dead silence.&nbsp; Again a
few minutes</b>
<br><b>later, the phone rings again and Jen answered but again nobdy there.&nbsp;
She was</b>
<br><b>getting frustrated and decided next time the phone rang she was
going to give</b>
<br><b>the caller a piece of her mind.&nbsp; So then the phone rings again,
but this time</b>
<br><b>someone had answered...it was our grandpa asking her where Julie
(her mom/his</b>
<br><b>daughter) was at.&nbsp; She told grandpa she didn't know and that's
when he told</b>
<br><b>her good bye and will see her later.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Jen went back to her nap.&nbsp; Jen started
having this bad feeling that</b>
<br><b>made her feel sickly.&nbsp; So she got up and walked to the kitchen
and get</b>
<br><b>something to drink thinking it may help her feel better.&nbsp; As
she got back to</b>
<br><b>the living room and turned on the television.&nbsp; But out of the
corner of her</b>
<br><b>eye, from the living room window she thought she saw someone standing
outside</b>
<br><b>looking in.&nbsp; She looked again and thought it was just shadow
maybe coming</b>
<br><b>from the light in the living room reflecting off something.&nbsp;
She didn't pay</b>
<br><b>it anymind because the curtain might have something to do with the
silhouette</b>
<br><b>she just saw. But when she looked again the silhouette was gone.&nbsp;
This</b>
<br><b>freaked her out and she ran to my other cousins house which was
just next</b>
<br><b>door.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well when she got to my other cousins house they
just told her they</b>
<br><b>received a bad news from her mom.&nbsp; She was all in a panic and
told them</b>
<br><b>someone was just at her house looking in through her living room
window and</b>
<br><b>this scared her because the thing just disappeared.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This scared my other</b>
<br><b>cousins too because they just told her that the bad news was our
grandpa was</b>
<br><b>just murdered and her mom and family was at the scene.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen came to think of it that the phone calls
and the shadow at the</b>
<br><b>window...was of our grandpa. And she thought of that last sentence
he told</b>
<br><b>her on the phone..."good bye and see you later."</b>

<br><b>Beginning of the Sensing of Them</b>
<p><b>By: fpike1271@home.com</b>
<p><b>It began when I was about 11-13 years old.&nbsp; My family moved
to a new subdivision in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada.&nbsp; It used to
be an apple orchard and there were 3 old homes circa 1850 that dominated
the subdivision.&nbsp; These were the last to be demolished and most of
the subdivision was built while these 3 homes were upright but abandoned
due to family death and sell off of the land.&nbsp; I was sleeping over
at a friends house, there were 3 of us, and we decided to visit the last
home at the top of the hill that was abondoned.&nbsp; The builder had smashed
out all the windows and doors as it was scheduled to be demolished in a
week.&nbsp; As we approached the house, I got a really bad feeling and
refused to go in.&nbsp; I was called chicken and all the names in the book
but I somehow knew something was in there.&nbsp; My 2 friends went in there,
one carrying a BB gun.&nbsp; I waited about 50 yards from the house, it
was near 11pm and very dark.&nbsp; I all of sudden saw a dark green glow
around the knocked out bay window in the front of the house.&nbsp; 20 seconds
later it was pulsing bright white and 10 seconds later my friends jumped
out of that window, with one firing the BB gun back into the house.&nbsp;
We ran home and swore that we would all agree it didn't happen.</b>
<br><b>The next instance came when I was at a party when I was about 17-18,
people were playing with a Ouija board and when I came into the room the
board piece began to jump.&nbsp; It asked me to leave, when they asked
why, It stated because I knew.&nbsp; I said to someone in the living room
that I felt someone was in the shrubs in the backyard.&nbsp; I never didn't
know the people playing the Ouija board, but one member playing came to
me and asked if i knew wher ED was, and i said in the shrubs in the backyard,
her face went white and she ran to the other room.&nbsp; Apparently it
kept spelling HE KNOWS.</b>
<br><b>I am almost 30 now and lately I can walk into a room and&nbsp; "sense"
something is there.&nbsp; Recently myself and my fiance moved into a cica
1940-50's apartment building.&nbsp; I woke in the middle of the night and
sensed somthing outside our bedroom window which is ground floor.&nbsp;
I found myself spiralling downward, somewhere between dreaming and awake.&nbsp;
I was aware of my fiance's body next to mine but could not move or speak.&nbsp;
It took everything I had to draw my inner strength and awake with a loud
noise.&nbsp; I told my fiance it must have been a bad dream.</b>
<br><b>Don't get me wrong, I probably walk into a room with a ton of ghosts
and not feel a thing, just at certain times.&nbsp; A friend of mine passed
away, LOY, I won't give his last name but when I went to the funeral home,
as soon as I walked in, I wanted to get out.&nbsp; I felt Loy standing
behind his wife as if to say it was okay.&nbsp; But the feelings were too
stron for me and I broke down.&nbsp; I had only worked with Loy for about
a year and was working in a different area 2 years after we worked together.</b>
<br><b>I am wanting to get rid of this, and am looking for serious replies
only.&nbsp; It is affecting my social life and work life.&nbsp; Serious
replies only to seniorfish@hotmail.com please.&nbsp; If you reply use the
title of Ghoststories so I now what to keep and delete.</b>
<br><b>Thanks - this has been a great weight off of me to know there are
others like me.</b>

<p><b>MP Story</b>
<p><b>By: fth@cox-internet.com</b>
<p><b>During my last tour on active duty in the Army as a Military Policeman,
I was assigned to the Military District of Washington Military Police Company,
Ft McNair, Washington D.C.&nbsp; During the revolutionary war, this base
was also known as Greenleaf Point. It was an ammunition storage area and
a key strategic area during that time. Sometime during the war, Greenleaf
Point was about to be overtaken by the Brits, so American forces took precautions
to remove everything possible prior to the invasion, and all gunpowder
and explosive material not immediately capable to be removed was stored
in a deep well which was out of reach of enemy forces. During the invasion
of Greenleaf point, a British soldier of an unknown identity struck a match
in an attempt to "see" deeper into the well, which resulted in a mass explosion,
killing many of the invading force. To this day, glimpses of British Redcoats
have been sighted by many people. One such story was in 1994, when a Military
Policeman was conducting a routine security check of the post, and was
completing a check of what is now known as the Officers Club, after hours.
At the rear of the club, the MP was checking one of the access doors, when
he noticed a glowing light toward the rear of the building. As he stood
watching, this light moved in his direction rather quickly, and soon appeared
at the rear door as the form of a British Redcoat soldier! The MP drew
his weapon, however found he was incapable of firing into the entity due
to a lack of response from his fear. As related from the MP, it was noted
that the entity traveled into his person, (feeling the entrance as a suction
of his MP uniform into his own body) and exited through the rear ( as a
pulling of the uniform away from his body). The MP then ran to his vehicle,
and drove at a high rate of speed back to the MP station, at which time
he entered and shakily relayed the story to his supervisor. Ft McNair is
a very small post, which is barely 1 mile in circumference. The distance
the MP traveled at the time was approximately 1/4 mile, and the speed he
claimed to have obtained was @ 50 MPH. While he was driving, he insisted
that the entity was levitating and remained in the vehicles rear for most
of the distance, at the same speed, taunting him.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Other stories of supernatural activities have been claimed
on this post also. Ft McNair was once the site of a Civil War prison camp,
of which many prisoners lost their lives, most of which were through the
flooding of the Potomac Riviera rising above her banks, drowning an untold
number of prisoners. Guards and employees have heard such things as voices,
chains and sighted entitities within the established buildings still in
use at the Fort.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The ghost of Mary Sarrate, one of the Lincoln conspirators,
is said to frequent this Fort. (This was the Fort in which the Lincoln
conspirators were hanged.)&nbsp; She was witnessed on occasion running
across the parade field, levitated a couple feet off the ground, from the
west end of the parade field heading east.&nbsp; It is also said that on
snowy or foggy nights, the parade field has been host to apparitions, with
eyewitness sightings of civil war soldiers conducting military drills or
ceremonies, which immediately afterward, revealed no signs in freshly lain
snow or morning dew.</b>

<p><b>Jersey City</b>
<p><b>By: ngennace@earthlink.net</b>
<p><b>As a child I lived in a house in Jersey City which my mother had
leased from a man named Jasper Weidman.&nbsp; Recently divorced, my mother
and we three children stayed at this house for approximately five years,
moving out of town in 1965.</b>
<br><b>During the time we spent in the house we "shared" the premises with
two ghosts.&nbsp; One was certainly that of a woman, who wore a lilac scented
perfume, and was very shy.&nbsp; Upon entering a room, she would hastily
exit, leaving her fragrance behind.&nbsp; A young man, not at all shy,
was observed and heard playing a piano!</b>
<br><b>In the mud hall/pantry at the rear of the house was an old ornate
studio upright.&nbsp; As my Mother played the piano, I recall her thinking
it such a shame that the old piano was left to stand in the unheated pantry
as certainly the instrument's sound board was ruined.&nbsp; My mother's
own baby grand sat in the living room.</b>
<br><b>One night we heard the old piano "playing".&nbsp; My mother told
the landlord that the piano was likely infested with mice, and asked that
he arrange to have it removed.&nbsp; Mr. Weidman agreed, but did say that
the piano had belonged to his late brother, and it had some sentimental
value.</b>
<br><b>Another night the piano was again heard.&nbsp; However, although
dreadfully out of tune, my mother recognized a pattern, this was not mice!&nbsp;
We crept part way down the stairs and were able to peer through the clear
glass transom over the door at the rear of the stairs, looking into the
pantry.&nbsp; There, seated at the piano was a slender &amp; very pale
young man.&nbsp; I recall he had rather long and thick dark hair. I also
recall he seemed whole but in a sort of luminous haze (it was a long time
ago!).&nbsp; As we watched the man turned and looked up at us, I still
recall thinking he looked pleased that he had an audience!&nbsp; Both my
mother and I ran back up the stairs, and clinging to each other, discussed
what we saw.&nbsp; As we spoke, the piano played on!</b>
<br><b>The following day my mother called Mr. Weidman and demanded that
the piano be removed immediately. I suppose he wondered why my Mother was
so anxious to get rid of the old piano, as I recall my mother saying he
told her his brother had died a very young man having suffered from a heart/lung
ailment.&nbsp; He said all he was able to do was play his piano.&nbsp;
I recall my mother saying that the brother composed his own music and often
gave recitals.&nbsp; Mr. Weidman described his brother as being very thin,
pale and having long dark hair in the fashion of the great masters.</b>
<br><b>After his piano was removed, the music stopped for a time, until
one night the ghost discovered my mother's piano.&nbsp; He would not play
too loudly or for too long, and never a familiar tune.&nbsp; The pieces,
according to my mother, were original and somewhat mimicing other works.&nbsp;
My Mom liked to keep the keys exposed, and the ghost used to close the
lid, and she one day announced to the air that the lid was to remain open
and it did!</b>
<br><b>After that one incident, we never saw the brother again, but did
hear the music occasionally, and always felt their presence in the home.&nbsp;
After a time, knowing they were near, actually became rather comforting!</b>
<br><b>I have driven by the house on a number of occasions.&nbsp; Oddly
it is the only residence yet standing in what used to be a "neighborhood".&nbsp;
Now all sorts of industry surround the house, and instead of the picket
fence, there's an ugly chain link type. I can't help but wonder if it remains
standing because these gentle spirits have over the years convinced its
owners that the house must remain.</b>

<p><b>The Poltergeist</b>
<p><b>By: Leah_Webber@planar.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I'm not quite sure exactly how this came about.&nbsp; I was only
thirteen at the</b>
<br><b>time, and highly afraid of anything out of the ordinary.&nbsp; Luckily
for me,</b>
<br><b>I've only had the one experience with anything paranormal and/or</b>
<br><b>frightening.&nbsp; I spent my summer vacations watching my younger
brother and</b>
<br><b>sister, supposedly with the aid of my older brother, who more often
would</b>
<br><b>go out to play with his friends.</b>
<br><b>On the day of this event, I decided to take my brother and sister
to the</b>
<br><b>park for a picnic lunch.&nbsp; One of my duties was to keep the
house clean, and</b>
<br><b>myself and my younger siblings worked all morning to that end.&nbsp;
We packed</b>
<br><b>our lunches, carefully locked the door, and left to enjoy ourselves.</b>
<br><b>We returned two hours later, to find the entire house in disarray.&nbsp;
There</b>
<br><b>were no open windows, and both the front door and the sliding glass
door</b>
<br><b>were still locked.&nbsp; The cupboards and drawer in the kitchen
were all left</b>
<br><b>hanging wide open.&nbsp; Every piece of food from the cupboards
had been ripped</b>
<br><b>from it's packaging and strewn across the living room.&nbsp; We
couldn't find</b>
<br><b>the containers at all.&nbsp; It seemed like they had just vanished
into thin</b>
<br><b>air. I have a specific memory of examining a pile of Corn Flakes
sitting</b>
<br><b>next to the dining room table.&nbsp; I thought someone had broken
in, and</b>
<br><b>refused to go past the kitchen, or down the halls into the bedrooms.</b>
<br><b>My younger brother ran to get my older brother from his friend's
house, and</b>
<br><b>he and I together went to examine the damage in greater detail.&nbsp;
The ashes</b>
<br><b>from the fire place had been blown outward across the carpet like
a great</b>
<br><b>wind had come down the chimney.&nbsp; The entire apartment was freezing
cold, as</b>
<br><b>if it were winter and the heat had been left off.&nbsp; It was the
middle of the</b>
<br><b>summer, and it was only slightly after one o'clock in the afternoon
and</b>
<br><b>nearly 100 degrees F outside.&nbsp; The coffee table was tipped
over, and there</b>
<br><b>was some kind of crunchy stuff (probably more food) scattered very
evenly</b>
<br><b>on every part of the carpet throughout the house.</b>
<br><b>The most frightening part for me was in the bathroom.&nbsp; My makeup
bag was</b>
<br><b>ripped open, scattering the contents across the floor, except one
bright</b>
<br><b>red lipstick, which was open on the counter.&nbsp; On the mirror,
the word "MARY</b>
<br><b>MARY" were scrawled in loud red capital letter eight times.&nbsp;
As I was</b>
<br><b>examining this, the bathroom light went out without anyone touching
the</b>
<br><b>switch, and I ran screaming from the room.</b>
<br><b>I remember being absolutely terrified that my parents would come
home and</b>
<br><b>blame us for the mess, so I made my siblings help me clean everything
up.</b>
<br><b>The ash refused to come completely off the carpet, however, and
there still</b>
<br><b>remained the issue of all the nonperishable food being trashed beyond
the</b>
<br><b>point to still be consumable.&nbsp; The bedrooms, except for the
crunchy carpet</b>
<br><b>covering (Which smelled like honey and vacuumed up pretty easily),
were</b>
<br><b>untouched.&nbsp; My parents believed me when I told them what happened,
and they</b>
<br><b>immediately had the apartment exorcised.&nbsp; We moved out shortly
thereafter,</b>
<br><b>and I haven't had any strange happenings since.</b>

<br><b>Battle Creek Michigan</b>
<p><b>By: clarke@iserv.net</b>
<p><b>Hello Dave, I just found your web site and thought I would let you
know</b>
<br><b>about my experience with a haunted house that my sister lived in
several</b>
<br><b>years ago. Her and her husband lived in the house for seven or eight</b>
<br><b>years and you wouldn't believe the things we saw, heard and smelled.
She</b>
<br><b>first realized the house was haunted after she had been to a local
tarot</b>
<br><b>card reader. The woman mentioned that there was an unhappy presence
in</b>
<br><b>the house. My sister wasn't sure what she meant at first and mentioned</b>
<br><b>it to me later. I told her it meant there was a spirit in the house.
Odd</b>
<br><b>things had happened in the house before this information came to
light</b>
<br><b>but they didn't think anything of it. They would find lights left
on in</b>
<br><b>various rooms as well as faucets running.</b>
<br><b>Really bizzare things began to happen right after the visit to the
tarot</b>
<br><b>card reader. They were having a new roof put on the house at the
time</b>
<br><b>and this seemed to stir up whatever was in the house. They began
to find</b>
<br><b>lights and faucets left on more and more. Soon noises and smells
began</b>
<br><b>to happen. There would be the sound of footsteps on the basement
stairs</b>
<br><b>and rushes of frigid air in our faces. Many times we would smell
roses</b>
<br><b>in the air after these things would happen. She had three sun catchers</b>
<br><b>hanging in her picture window which would start to swing back and
fourth</b>
<br><b>in unison and then suddenly stop. We were watching tv one afternoon</b>
<br><b>which was in the corner of the living room near the front window.
The</b>
<br><b>shear curtins behind the tv suddenly blew straight out and draped
over</b>
<br><b>the tv. This was on a warm summer day and there was no breeze outside.</b>
<br><b>She walked over to the tv and put the curtain back where it belonged
and</b>
<br><b>sat down again. Moments later it happened again. She moved the curtain</b>
<br><b>back several more times only to have it continue. I said it must
not</b>
<br><b>want us to watch tv! When I said this a 12" teddy bear sitting on
a</b>
<br><b>little wooden stool flipped up in the air and landed in the middle
of</b>
<br><b>the living room. I then said "who's going to go in there and pick
that</b>
<br><b>up"? My sister said she would and put the teddy bear back on the
wooden</b>
<br><b>stool. Her husband worked third shift so my sister was alone over
night.</b>
<br><b>After a while loud pounding started on the floors and walls and
at the</b>
<br><b>foot of her bed. I told her I didn't know how she could stand to
be</b>
<br><b>there by herself when this was going on. They had a priest come
in on</b>
<br><b>several occasions to bless the house. Each time it was done the
smell of</b>
<br><b>roses would fill the air and things would be quiet for as long as
three</b>
<br><b>weeks but then it would start in all over again. One afternoon the
smoke</b>
<br><b>alarm in the kitchen sounded off and wouldn't stop. She got the
step</b>
<br><b>ladder out to open it up only to find out that there was no battery
in</b>
<br><b>it. They put the house up for sale but didn't have any luck selling
it.</b>
<br><b>The strange things continued to happen and it was really beginning
to</b>
<br><b>effect my sister's emotional state. It didn't seem to bother her
husband</b>
<br><b>as much although he saw and heard many strange things as well. It
got to</b>
<br><b>the point where he wouldn't even mention them to my sister because
it</b>
<br><b>would only upset her more. They had a great dane which was upset
on many</b>
<br><b>occasions as well. The dog was lying in the kitchen one afternoon
when</b>
<br><b>suddenly it let out a yelp and ran into the living room shaking.
A noise</b>
<br><b>scared the dog. We went out in the kitchen to investigate and found
a</b>
<br><b>puddle of slimey stuff on the counter top. It was about 10" round
and</b>
<br><b>had no smell to it. It was kind of oily to the touch. Another time
my</b>
<br><b>sister was getting a cooking pot out from a lower cabinet when a
book</b>
<br><b>they had bought on hauntings fell from a top shelf and hit her in
the</b>
<br><b>head. She picked the book up and laid it on the kitchen table. The
cover</b>
<br><b>of the book flipped open and there was more of the slimey stuff
inside!</b>
<br><b>When her husband got home she opened the book to show him the stain
and</b>
<br><b>there was nothing there. The most bizarre thing that happened to
me was</b>
<br><b>when I heard a voice. I was sitting on the couch watching tv and</b>
<br><b>suddenly I had the strange feeling that someone was watching me.
I put</b>
<br><b>the tv on mute and sat there for a moment. Still feeling like I
was</b>
<br><b>being watched I said "is there anybody there"? To my shock and amazement</b>
<br><b>I got a reply! A faint female voice said "yes". Needless to say
I made a</b>
<br><b>beeline out of the house and joined my sister in the back yard where
she</b>
<br><b>was filling the birdfeeders. She looked at me and said "what's the</b>
<br><b>matter, you look white as a sheet". I explained to her what happened
and</b>
<br><b>she got very upset and told me not to do anything to stir it up.They</b>
<br><b>finally sold the house and on the last day of moving things really
went</b>
<br><b>wild. My sister and I were down in the basement packing things.
Her</b>
<br><b>husband had just left to take a load of stuff to their new</b>
<br><b>house.Suddenly there was all kinds of footsteps upstairs and the
sound</b>
<br><b>of slamming doors. I yelled upstairs to ask if my brother in law
was</b>
<br><b>there. Soon as I did this it went silent. We went up stairs and
found</b>
<br><b>nothing. I went down stairs one more time to get the last box. I
bent</b>
<br><b>down to pick up the box and was blasted with frigid air again. This
was</b>
<br><b>my last visit to the house until several years later. The house
went up</b>
<br><b>for sale again less than two years after my sister moved out. The</b>
<br><b>reality company was having an open house so my brother in law and
I</b>
<br><b>took a tour of the house. The moment we walked in you could feel
it in</b>
<br><b>the air. The realtor mentioned that the current owner's dog refused
to</b>
<br><b>come within fifty feet of the house and would just sit in the back
yard</b>

<br><b>A Bedroom Visitor</b>
<p><b>By: Grazer@gmx.net</b>
<p><b>HI !</b>
<br><b>First off I have do excuse for errors which are maybe in this writing,
but I am Austrian and not really used to write in English.</b>
<br><b>So, my story happened to me app. 3 Weeks ago and I still feel very
uncomfortable thinking on it.</b>
<br><b>I am living alone in a apartment in a newly build house in Graz,
Austria. One Night I woke up feeling a Body lying aside me (at my back)
pressing the body firmly to mine. As I've said I am living alone and I
was sleeping on the left side of the bed, my body was turned to the right,
so the other body would have to float in mid-air !!</b>
<br><b>First I thought that i am still sleeping, but I could hear the 1.00
AM News with actual content. I reached behind me and could feel a leg and
the hips of this individual. I Ask "How are you, you can't be Barbara(my
former Girlfriend, that left me 1 month ago)" and I could hear a kind of
long howl (like an angry dog) and feel (!) the body disappear under my
very hands !!. Not to mention that the rest of the night I was awake with
my lights turned on watching TV to calm me down. The next night I was afraid
of going to sleep, but I finally had a light und unsteady sleep. Again
at app 1 AM I could feel the rising pressure of a hand at my back. I jumped
out of the bed, hoping to get a visual interpretation of "it". But the
only thing I saw was a kind of little clouds at this side of the bed (I
am not really sure if I have seen it or if it was only a "wish to see").</b>
<br><b>For god sake, up till now it was the only experience of this kind
and I hope that it will stay this way. Best regards from Austria and you
have a real great page</b>
