<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The House In High
Point<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">OK. There are
plenty of
skeptics out there who dismiss haunted houses as fakes or products of
people's
overly imaginative minds. We all know what opinions are like but I know
what I
can see, hear and touch. I may never have actually seen a ghost but I
know for
a fact I have heard them clear as day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Let me convey a little story.......... In 1994, I moved in with
my ex at
her house. This is the same place I mentioned in my previous blog
where- on two
separate occasions- my cousin and brother both heard what sounded like
furniture being thrown around in the room next to the living room. It's
an old
house and the center section was built sometime during the late 18th to
mid
19th centuries. No one really knows for sure. There are remnants of
slave
quarters in the basement so that tells you how old the place truly is.
Not that
the age of a house matters but in many cases, it does.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Anyway, let's cut to the chase. When I moved
in, the house was being restored. This, as many people know, can get
things
rolling for whatever manifestations exist in the area. One day- yes
DAY- I was
in the new bathroom brushing my teeth. It was the time of day when my
ex would
usually come home for lunch. Then I hear foot steps coming up the
stairs. Not
creeky house settling sounds, these were foot steps on hard wood
floors. I kept
the door closed and called out my ex's name. There was no answer but
the foot
steps continued. I called again, still no answer and they kept coming.
I walk
over to the door and listened. They reach the top of the stair case,
walk right
past the door, down the hall and into the bedroom where they stopped
dead. Then
I thought it might be our friend pulling a prank on me. I slowly open
the door,
ease my way down the hall and jump into the bedroom to scare him. There
was no
one there. I looked in the closet. Nothing. I never ran so fast in my
life. I
banged into doors, leaped down the stairs, smashed into the wall
knocking
framed pictures to the ground and ran outside. I figured I'd wait for
my ex to
come home as she had a gun.................as if that would matter!<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Another story- and this is the one that
confirmed it for me- my ex had never had an air conditioner in the
house. The
lethal combination of humidity and an ape like myself is not good so I
insisted
we get one. Once it was purchased, we decided to put it in the living
room. Of
course this meant that the bedroom would be a sauna so until an AC was
put in
that room, we took the mattress and placed it in the living room. So,
the very
first night we slept in that room, I was quite content with the AC
cooling
things off quite nicely. I am laying there awake and my ex is fast
asleep. All
of a sudden out of nowhere, I hear the voice of woman SCREAM at the top
of her
lungs "SHERRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
can just imagine how I reacted to this. I
jumped up off the mattress and was bouncing off the walls like a
pinball. My ex
woke up and didn't know what was going on. She found me on the couch
shaking
and in tears. She tried her best to calm me down but I couldn't. I was
up for
the rest of the night with a knot in my stomach the size of Manhattan.
Try to
imagine yourself in a quiet room and someone or something that isn't
even there
stands directly above you and screams at the top of their lungs. Not a
good
feeling at all. The next day, I was pacing around trying to figure out
what it
was I had heard. I couldn't stop thinking about it. Eventually, I
decided to
just shrug it off but I did not forget that it had happened.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Now the story gets better............. About
a year and a half later, my ex calls me from work:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"You will never believe what I just
found out. A friend of mine who used to work here at the park dropped
by the
office. With a strange look on his face, he asked me how I liked living
in that
house. I told him it was fine. He then asked if I had ever heard or
seen
anything strange. I said I never have but mentioned that you had
thought you
had heard a woman scream out the name "Sherry". He turned white and
said "You have GOT to be kidding me! Really? I told him that was what
you
told me. He then said that the owners who lived there from the
30's-60's had a
niece who used to come up and visit them for the summer. She was killed
outside
on rte. 23 and guess what her name was? Sherry!" The house is abandoned
now. The living room was on the side of the house which faced the
highway. The
road is about 10-15 feet away with a bird's eye view of a very sharp
turn. We
had both witnessed some nasty automobile bang-ups in that same spot.
What was
it I heard? Could it have been an echo from the past which was
manifesting
itself? The voice of the woman who lived there who may have seen her
niece hit
by a car from that very room? Mind you, I had NEVER done any research
on the
house nor did I hear any stories of a 'Sherry' visiting nor being
killed
outside the house. It could have been any name on the planet. It
could've been
Ethel, Muriel, Gloria, Beulah or whomever but no, I distinctly heard
the name
'Sherry'. Why? I am still waiting for someone to come up with a logical
answer
for it. But alas, since there are no such things as haunted houses, I
must be
making it all up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In July of 2008, I
went to
Sedona, Arizona on vacation with my mother. At the time I had been
through
several surgeries. Although I was not ill, I was in quite a bit of
pain, and I
hoped that the vacation would do me some good. One afternoon during our
stay,
we decided to hike around Bell Rock. About halfway through the hike, we
stopped
to rest and drink some water. We paused for several minutes to look at
the view
and catch our breath. I was facing away from the trail when we decided
to
continue on our way, and so I turned around to head back out. When I <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">turned, there was a
man standing
very close to me in a long blue tunic-type shirt. I turned and backed
up to let
him by me on the trail, but when I turned again, he was gone. I looked
around
and said to my mom, "That was odd, there was a man..." and as I said
the words, I felt the coldest chill pass through my body (in July!). I
became
very dizzy and needed to sit down. We found a tree to sit under, and as
the
dizziness passed, I realized that I was suddenly out of pain. I had NO
PAIN. I
still felt fairly disoriented, and so my mother was asking me about the
experience, and so I told her that the man had been wearing some sort
of a long
blue shirt-- and as I told her this, a large flock of some sort of blue
jay or
scrub jay-- with brilliant blue feathers-- filled the tree. I believe
that I
was visited by a Shaman, who knew how to relieve my pain. I lived pain
free for
several weeks after that. I have searched for stories or legends of a
Shaman in
a blue tunic, but I've never been able to find anything. If anyone has
any
information on him, I would love to hear it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I'm 29 years old
and all
through out my life (and still) I've had strange experiences that I
could never
explain. Some of them have scared me while others have just made me
wonder if I
had really saw what I thought I had. I've been told that there is
something
about me that makes me very receptive to paranormal activity and I'm
not sure
so if that's a good thing or bad. But there are two instances that
stand out
among the rest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first happened when
I was about 8 or 9 and I was sleeping in the living room of our house.
I
refused to sleep in my room because it was the closest to the woods and
I
always felt like something was standing at my window looking at me,
even with
the curtains drawn. I was sound asleep when suddenly something work me
up. I
opened my eyes to see this little impish looking thing standing on my
chest
staring down at me just mocking me. It was dark in color, sort of dark
reddish
brown. About a foot high, a haggard face and a very skinny body with
its ribs
straining against the dry skin. It was just standing there looking at
me. I
couldn't move. I wanted to scream, but I couldn't. I was terrified and
it just
kept looking at me, taunting me to scream or yell for my "mommy".
Suddenly it looked up, looked mad and just vanished. My mom walked into
the
room a second later out of their bedroom. As soon as it was gone I
could breath
and move again but never told my mother what happened since she already
thought
I had problems. That exact instance never happened again but from time
to time
since, till now, I would / will feel things touching me. Brushing my
hair from
my face or just lightly rustling to top of my hair. Touching my face,
racking
it's fingers down my back. And each time this happens I'm frozen until
the
episode is over. I have no idea what it was / is or what it wants.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The second happened when I was around 15 and
I had been having a really hard time. I was depressed, on Prozac and
sleeping
pills and even then I couldn't sleep. I would lay in my room at night
and see
faces in the dark, feel things touch me, hear them talking to me. I
would go
into the bathroom and when I looked in the mirror I would see extra
eyes appear
in my face, another mouth, a snarling face that appeared to be just
under my
own skin. I was terrified to even look at myself. After about a year of
this I
ran into my mom's room and threw myself into her bed and begged her to
let me
die. I wanted to kill myself. I had officially gone insane and I
couldn't take
it any more. (Up till now I had never told my parents any of this
stuff, I
thought they would put me away but I told them everything laying there
crying
and pleading to die) My father, who is a preacher, couldn't take the
thought of
his daughter wanting to kill herself and did the only thing he thought
he could
do. He prayed over me. He yelled out "Spirits I rebuke you in the name
of
Jesus Christ! I command that you leave my daughter alone!" The door to
their bedroom that had been tightly closed, opened itself up, slammed
against
the wall and then closed itself again and we heard this piercing shriek
from
outside the house. I will never forget that. That night he blessed the
house,
and in our religion we use olive oil. He prayer over my bedroom, making
a cross
in olive oil on my bedroom door. Instantly, the atmosphere was
different. But,
the next morning I was aghast when I looked at my door. Where the oil
had
dripped down you could see what looked like the face of a screaming
demon. I
couldn't wash the oil off so it had to remain there. After a few days I
tacked
a poster over it but just knowing that that face was there was
horrible. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hello, my name is
Matt<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and for two years now, I've been
having a
series of very realistic and emotionally taxing dreams. I don't know if
this is
a paranormal occurrence or just dreams, but they seem important enough
for me
to investigate into them. In said dreams, I am contacting or am being
contacted
by people. Mostly a girl named Amber, but also I've been contacted or
am being
contacted by a teenage boy and a priest( I'm not sure of their names,).
Beyond
the way I react to these dreams( typically, I'm taking heavy breaths
and
feeling fear, longing, a sense of contentedness, anger, whatever
emotion the
person had in the dream), the reason I think they might be real is the
fact
that they feel real, both in imagery and content. For example, when I
first met
Amber, she told me about her 5 year plan, to go to Nursing school at
night,
once employed as a nurse, she'd move from her father's home and all the
while
she'd work on her music career. Not something I typically dream about.
It's
rather mundane by dreamworld and at time by real world standards. These
dreams
could easily just be dreams and if so, I'm happy to just be crazily
chasing
dreams, but if it's a real thing, I want to know if it's possible to
contact
the people in the dreams. It's not something I can control, it happens
when it
happens and sometimes happens months apart from the last. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">When I was about 7
or so, I
woke up in the middle of the night. I was about to call out for my
mother when
I saw a lady standing in my bedroom doorway. She had long brown hair
and was
wearing a blue gown that was flowing around her, like there was a
breeze. There
was also a bright white light coming in behind her. I've only seen her
2 or 3
times, all before I became an adult. This took place in Rockdale, Tx in
my home
on a quiet, middleclass residential street. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The House In
Brooklyn, New
York<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The house in
Brooklyn, NY. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It seems that this
place had it's
"problems" before my relatives moved in. The story goes that years
earlier, a New York City Police Officer lived there with his wife. One
night,
he heard strange sounds emanating from the attic. He went to inspect
and fell
down the stairs, breaking his neck. To make matters worse, after this
happened,
the same thing happened to his wife! Though no one knows if she heard
the
sounds. Regardless, they BOTH fell down the stairs to their deaths. I
remember
the steps to that attic. They were very steep and had a sharp narrow
turn.
Creepy indeed. My relatives bought this house around 1963-64. It still
stands
today in one of those "not so nice" Brooklyn neighborhoods. However,
at the time it was still fairly decent. It started out that my
grandparents and
my Uncle Bobby moved into the main floor and my Uncle Richie's family
on the
second. The house is quite large and quite lengthy. It's three stories
and I
believe was built circa 1915 which would have made it about 48 years
old when
my relatives moved in. Not that the age of a house matters.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I am going to borrow from my Uncle Richie's
blog that he wrote in September, 2007 and let him tell you how things
went down
while he lived there: I don't recall what started the conversation at
home
about "things going bump in the night"; but, once it began, out came
a flood of "experiences."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each
thought it was only imagination at work, at first!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don't know where to begin or who heard what
first.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I will start by saying that my
Mom's dog, Tippy, would never come up the stairs to our apartment.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>He was a very friendly dog and always
responded when called; but refused to come up to our apartment..<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>If he was held and being brought up the
stairs , he would squirm and resist until he was put down and he
returned to my
Mom's apt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would stay at the foot of
the stairs and bark at us yet he was not a "barker" by nature.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>It seemed the hair on his back would stand up
when he was called upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We associated
his behavior to the "spirits", in retrospect, when we began sharing
experiences. My wife and I, on numerous occasions, heard footsteps
ascending
the stairs, passing the louvered doors that separated our living room
from the
hall, and continuing up to the top floor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were not the creakings one hears when a house settles.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>They were footsteps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
was a progression and diminution of the
sounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They occurred at different <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">times, even late at
night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We attributed the footsteps to
those living on the top floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
on several occasions , my wife or I wanted to speak with one of the
girls and
proceded to the attic apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one
was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We didn't know what to make
of this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We just blew it off.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was one of the "stories' that came
out when the subject was opened.My sister said that often after making
her bed,
she would find it rumpled as if someone had lain on it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She also reported that her covers would come
off during the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was not a
restless sleeper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At times it felt as if
they were slowly being pulled off the bed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At a later date, she swore she heard a woman's voice, at her ear
as she
lay in bed, saying: "This is my house! GET OUT!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
was when she had moved up to the attic
apartment.Another time, my brother, Bobby, told me that I needed to
talk to
Vreni, because he heard the entry door open and then subdued voices
under the
stairwell .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His room was opposite the
stairwell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that she apparently
was bringing her date in and "making out" there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
were responsible for Vreni and didn't want
her to get into any troubles here, so I confronted her with this.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>She was dumbfounded and a bit put out that I
should think this of her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
vehement that never, ever did she do anything like that.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>During that year, Ursula's brother and his
wife were returning home to Switzerland from Chile where he had worked
for
several years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They came to our house,
en route, and stayed several days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
sister gave them her double bed while she bunked with my mother. ( My
father
had already passed away.)The following morning they came down to the
kitchen
and asked us what was the joke.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
said during the night they were awakened several times by sounds of
paper being
scrunched together, like paper bags used by super markets.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The sounds awakened them and they couldn't
discern who was doing it; but the sounds were in their bedroom!<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We assured them that none of us was doing
that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We didn't tell them our suspicions
for fear of scaring them away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We let it
go at that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It didn't happen for the
next two days and they left. My son mark slept in the same room as his
brother,
while my daughter slept in an adjacent oom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mark had a habit if he awoke from sleep at ten or eleven p.m.,
of
standing behind his door opening, that faced our living room until I'd
say,
" It's okay Mark; you can come out."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He'd sit with us a bit and then we'd tuck him back into bed.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>One night I heard the sounds he usually made
at the door and said that it was alright to come on out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was no response.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard the
sounds again and repeated the
invitation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still nothing!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I got up to look for him and he was sound
asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My wife and I looked at each
other and agreed that we had "heard" him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
few hours later, after we had gone to
sleep, Mark came to my bedside, rubbing his eyes, saying he couldn't
sleep
because there were people in his room talking and waking him up.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>This was about 2 a.m. and everyone was asleep
in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My wife brought him back
to his bed and tucked him in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He fell
asleep immediately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She then said, in
the room, "You're welcome, whoever you are, to be here; but, please
don't
harm my children."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night while
she and I were watching television, we heard the footsteps again
approach and
recede up the third stairway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My wife said
it sounded like my sister was going to bed early, and there was
something she
wanted to discuss with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She went to
the stairs and up to the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All was
dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one was there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were all at my Mom's watching her
television.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My wife again made a plea
that: "whoever you are, welcome; but please don't hurt my
children!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That's how strong our
belief had become.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another incident
occurred after we had gone to bed. It was between 11-12 p.m.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We were dozing off, facing each other and the
sound of heavy breathing startled us awake.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She asked me, : Do you hear that?"<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I did hear it and I was frozen in place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It sounded right beside my ear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
felt my hair literally stand on end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was scared!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And I will admit it!<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>So was my wife!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
seemed to last about a minute then
receded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another time my Mother awoke in
the morning to find the inner hallway strewn with leaves.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There were two entry doors, an outer door to
a vestibule, then another door to the hall and stairway.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She said she had locked both doors as usual
before retiring for the night and they were still locked in the morning.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We had no idea how the leaves got into the
house!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On one of my overnights on call,
at the hospital, my sister and mother and brothers heard the doors open
and
footsteps go up to the second floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
sister said,: Oh good, Richie's home; I need to talk to him."<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>She went up to our apartment and asked Ursula
where I was, that she needed to speak to me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My wife told her I wasn't home, that I was on call at the
hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sister told her that they all
heard me
come in and go up the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course,
I wasn't home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ursula told my sister she
had just finished speaking with me on the phone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
last tale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was an alleyway between
houses and the
lady of <span style="">&nbsp;</span>the house on the side that had
my childrens' bedrooms, complained that we must stop making noises late
at
night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She thought we were having
parties, and disturbing her peace and quiet !<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We assured her that there were no such parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We had children and would not be the ones
making noise at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The footsteps we
all were hearing, sounded like those a little old lady would make.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other side of our house lived a family
who knew of the previous occupants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
wife got to talking with her and asked if there had been an old lady
living in
the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told us that the house
was built and occupied by the same family until the last member, an old
lady
died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house went on the market and
was bought by a Russian man, who didn't stay in it long.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He put it on the market and that's when we
bought it. You could say it was all a figment of imagination; but we
all heard
these things separately and didn't reveal them to each other for many
months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I still want to not believe. but
I cannot deny what I (we) heard! You can "Believe It or Not" Throughout
it all there was never a sense of fear that was sufficient to make us
want to
sell and move out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides we couldn't
afford it! After Uncle Richie moved to Texas, his brother- my Uncle
Tommy and
his family- moved into the second floor apartment. I believe this was
about
1965-66. My brother Tommy told me of the times he heard footsteps
progressing
up the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On one occasion, he came
home early to an empty house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The whole
family had gone to some outing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While he
was sitting in the living room, with the louvered doors shut, he said
he heard
a door open and slam shut, followed by footsteps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
thought: 'oh good, they're home.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he
opened the louvered door, he said he
heard AND felt "something, go by him and proceed up the stairs to the
attic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hairs on his body "stood
up". and he ran down the first three steps then jumped down the
remaining,
banging into the wall at the bottom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
asked him what he did then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said he
sat outside the house untill the family returned!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another
incident he related was during the
Christmas season.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sister had put up a
tree with all red Christmas balls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
they were sitting in my mother's living room one evening, the Xmas
balls began
"jumping" off the tree! smashing on the floor. Whenever these things
happened, we each had a sense of being dumbfounded!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Each "happening" was brief and then
was over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of us liked to go into the
unfinished part of the attic alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
always sought to have someone with us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We all had that "uneasy" feeling. We never let the kids go up
there alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My brother, Tommy, said he
always felt a "presence" when he went up there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
never did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sounds were all I ever heard. I'm sure if the family got
together
there'd be other remembrances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I haven't
spoken with Heidi, nor with my brother,Bobby.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Someday I will call them and ask if they can add anything more
re. this
phenomenon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I said, my family and I
are hard headed, in general; but, all this leaves us with the sense
that we
HAVE to believe that "something" was, and maybe still is, going on in
that house on Jerome Street!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was
Uncle Richie's take on it all. Mind you, I heard other stories from my
aunts,
uncles, my parents, and even their neighbor who had come to baby sit. I
cannot
recall what the neighbor's story was. I should contact her and have her
refresh
my mind. I had also heard that Heidi- whom I believe was Uncle Richie's
Swiss
born maid- had come screaming out of the attic, banging into walls and
knocking
things over. She was shaking and screaming that she'd never go back up
there
again. She wouldn't say what had happened but she never did go up there
again.
My grandmother- who were referred to as "Nanny"- had also mentioned
that she'd actually seen the old lady that Uncle Richie mentions in his
blog.
Apparently she was sitting on the couch in her living room doing Nanny
things
when she noticed something move in a hallway which was off the dining
room.
There she saw an old woman walk out from the hallway, cross in front of
the
fireplace in the dining room and into the kitchen. Nanny yelled out
"And
just where do you think YOU'RE going?!" Of course, there was no answer
and
when she went to investigate, there was no one to be found. A few days
later
she mentioned to one of the neighbors what she had seen and they
responded with
"Oh yes. That's Mary" She used to live in the house".
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My parents both heard the same footsteps that
wandered past the second floor louvered doors and stop at the attic.
Whereas,
everyone else who had heard this same progression were on the first or
second
floor, Mom &amp; Dad were in bed in the attic and heard the sounds
coming
toward the other side of the attic door and stop. I believe this
happened to a few
others as well. Also, Mom said she heard the front door open and slam
while she
was on the second floor with my Uncle Ronnie but no one came in the
house! Now,
I can't recall if it was Uncle Ronnie or not, but one night someone was
sleeping in the attic apartment and while they were laying in bed,
still awake
in the darkness, they felt someone sit down on the bed alongside them
and start
caressing their face! They were frozen with fear and wisely did not
open their
eyes. I can't recall who it was but I seem to recall it being Uncle
Ronnie or a
friend of his. Either way, UGH! What do you do when something like that
happens?!L ike three jerks, my brothers and I always wanted to hear
about the
ghosts in the house and when we would visit, we always had to sleep in
that
attic apartment. Sleep would never come easy in that room as every
sound and
shadow became something ghostly. The last time we stayed there, I was
nine
years of age and from what I recall, I never heard nor saw anything out
of the
ordinary. This may not be true. One New Year's Eve- we'd always visit
on that
holiday and we loved it- I was laying on Uncle Tommy's couch on the
second
floor. Their dog, a Boxer named "Nero" (ffft!), was laying alongside
the couch with me. I could hear the faint sounds of the party going on
downstairs but I was rather tired so I was enjoying the serenity of the
second
floor. All of a sudden, Nero rises and his ears perk up. He is looking
directly
at the louvered doors that are wide open. He gets up and slowly walks
over to
the landing, slowly sits down and stares up the steps towards the
attic. I
watched this for many minutes. That dog did NOT move an inch nor did he
stop
glaring up toward the attic. I was so creeped out by this that I ran
down the
back stairs (which were scarier than the front!) and joined the party
again. I
have no clue what that was but something wasn't right! Speaking of that
creepy
back staircase, many people had fallen down them. Including Uncle
Richie's son
Eric and Uncle Tom's kid Michael. Both of them hit their head on a
heavy
radiator at the bottom of the stairs. My cousin Mike hit extra hard and
had to
get stitches. The common denominator is that both Eric and Michael and
another
person who fell but I forget who, still insist that someone PUSHED them
down
the stairs yet there was no one there!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, by the time we were around, my Grandmother had placed a
rather
large Crucifix at the foot of the stairs that led to the attic. She
told me
that once she did this, the disturbances stopped. Wow.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My Aunt Grace, who we referred to as
"Tanti" (the one who heard the woman's voice), had mentioned that
besides the sheets being slowly pulled off the bed, they once FLEW off.
She
boldly stood up and blurted out "I have to go to work in the morning!
Please leave me alone!" She quietly settled back down and went to sleep
and it stopped. Also, when she heard the woman's voice, she said she
was so
frightened that instead of panicking, she merely stood up, went
downstairs to
the first floor and had a cup of coffee until she calmed down. In the
early
1980's- a few years after they sold the house- she dropped by the place
and
during a conversation with the new owners, she asked if they'd finished
the
attic (she was dying to hear what they would say). They responded with
a very
quick and nervous "We never go up there."Recently, my girlfriend and
I made a trek to the area. It was like stepping back in time to the
early
1970's. Besides all the bars on everyone's first floor windows,
everything was
essentially the same. The house is still there and has fallen into
disrepair.
We did not feel welcome nor safe at all. We were being monitored and
since she
is quite an attractive blond, after about ten minutes, I made sure we
bolted
out of there. Funny thing is, on the front door of the house, there was
a sign
"Apartment For Rent". Gee, I wonder why...........<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">During my sophomore
year at
the U of I, I worked as a lifeguard at the Church St. YMCA in Champaign
IL,
that is listed in your haunted places index.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This building is very old, and has an air of creepiness about it
even
without the weird things that happened to me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was the morning lap swim guard which meant that I was one of
the first
people in the building on the days I worked.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My day would normally start with me changing in the women's
locker
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many mornings while changing I
would hear a shower turn on, and go to investigate the shower room to
find it
dry and no showers running.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were
also many times when I would close my locker and start heading toward
the pool
entrance and see "something" in the mirror above the sinks that
showed a portion of the locker room and also the entrance to the
showers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being the only person in the pool
area was
usually quite the experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During
morning lap swims the guard would sit in a door way which allowed them
to see
both the large competitive size pool and a smaller warm water pool.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>This put the guard's back to the hallway
leading
in from the locker rooms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many mornings
I would hear someone walking down from the women's locker room, and
listen to
the steps coming into the pool area, and when I would turn around to
look
through the windows of the small pool NO ONE would be there.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes I would be doing my morning
maintenence chores such as checking the chemicals in the big pool and
hear a
splash in the small pool.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would always
stop what I was doing to go to the doorway and let the person who
entered the
pool know that I was there, and several times there was no one in the
pool but
the water was rippling as if someone had just gotten in or out.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I was ALWAYS glad to have a lap swimmer in
the pool because it was much harder to hear the noises when someone was
swimming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Closing the pool at night was
usually not a fun time either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many
times I walked up the stairs to the women's locker room backward
because if I
walked up with my back to the pool I could hear someone walking behind
me!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was a competitive swimmer as a child
and
spent many Saturdays and Sundays in the Champaign County Y's gym
waiting for my
swimming events.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The gym never felt
right to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even with the all the
lights on it seemed super dark and shadowy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later on as an employee of the Y I actually heard basketball
bouncing
noises coming from the gym with noone inside it!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Regardless
of the strange things that
happened to me at the Y it is a great place, and I never felt
threatened or
like I was in danger.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hello, This
experience
occurred at a friends house that we used to hang out at as teens in the
late
1970's, her house was actually an old turn of the century farm in Hugo
Minnesota, I mean it was old when we where there, it was a car junk
yard at the
time and there was strange,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>things did
happen like<span style="">&nbsp; </span>pictures would swing on it's
nail all of a sudden on there own or a pencil would fly across the
living room
but nothing "evil", well as adults we went back for a visit and my
friend's brother told me a story about the house that made my skin crawl<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>and he hasn't been back since, he said he was
coming to visit his father one afternoon walking up the long dirt
driveway one
of the dogs met him, as they approached the house the dog wanted real
bad to
get into the house so he let him in, there is a door to the upstairs
bedrooms,
the dog barking like mad wanted to go up them stairs so he let him up,
when he
got upstairs the dog was barking and growling at one of the bedroom
doors, so
he opened the door, the dog did NOT want go inside the room at all even
after
his bizarre behavior, he looked in the room, there on the floor was a
large
goat like creature lying in the middle of the room, as if resting with
it's
neck twisted backwards! he said the goat creature lifted it's head and
looked
at him! he said he never ran so fast down them stairs and out the front
door in
his life! with the dog behind him! his father was not home that day, he
never
went back there again even though it was his childhood home, the house
has been
torn down in the mid 1990's. and I believe that happened, knowing that
house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the
bones would have been scattered if the animal was eaten, and if it had
merely
been washed up there would be no blood.i still dont know what

animal... but when we got back on the trail the youngest of us sudenly
started
running from the woods. then i heard voices thousands of voices young
and old

all
saying this ..." get out of here, leave, go"... conner the youngest
was scared out of most of his wits we went back to the house and stayed

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">So many of these I
have
encountered--here are just a few.... <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My grandmother's
story <span style="">&nbsp;</span>My grandmother lived in a apartment
that was
located by the railroad tracks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
night, she was alone with my mother (who was an infant) while her
husband
worked the night shift.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She woke up to a
whooshing noise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thinking it was the
train passing, she started to go back to sleep when suddenly she saw a
horrible
glowing orb coming from the corner of the room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was horrible because she said it had a face riddled with
slash and
stab marks---with a horrible grimace.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The "face floated to the other side of the room and
disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gram never went back to bed
that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her husband told her that
she was dreaming. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Gram told people
before that there was a dark stain on the floor of the room that no
matter how
she scrubbed, she never got the stain out.--It comes into play later.
The next
day, Gram related the story to a neighbor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The neighbor asked again, what appartment di Gram live in.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>When Gram told her, she said "Oh THAT
apartment!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The neighbor told her
that before Gram and her family moved in, that there was a murder
commited in
the very room that Gram saw the apparition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A woman lived there and was murdered by a tramp who camped out
by the
railroad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stain on the floor was
blood. Gram moved out shortly into another flat not to long after that.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Dog Ghosts? I had a
Terrier/Poodle that I was very close too.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Booger" (yes, that was his name) was very protective and
rarely wanted to leave my side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day,
he became deathly ill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a sort of
leukemia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vet advised me to put him
down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't decide what to do, but
prayed to God that if he wasn't going to heal him, please take him into
Heaven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, God heard my prayers and
the phone call came right afterward saying that he died. Needless to
say, I was
devistated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, a few nights later,
I lay awake in the dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I swear that I
heard a panting noise like he usually would do before coming to bed. a
small
pad like footsteps and THEN something HEAVY jumped on the bed and
settled down
by my feet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>NOW I WAS TERRIFIED!! I
really thought I was losing my mind.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was not happening, I told myself. What was really scary was
that I
knew what was coming next.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Booger would
always cuddle up to my side and lick my hand before falling asleep.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't take it...I yelled, sat up in bed
waving my hands at "it" and found...nothing!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Later, I felt bad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was he trying to
reach me?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maybe one day, when I am more
brave to face it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I'm a resident of
Prince
George's County MD, so both of these locations are very familiar to
me.For Glen
Dale Hospital, some of your information is a tad..false? The hospital
is made
up of in total 23 different buildings (believe it or not), and the
hospital was
a tuberculosis sanitarium. These "ghostly images of packs of dogs"
are not ghostly, there are indeed MANY German Shepherds running around
the
grounds(as well as 24/7 patrols) to keep people off of the property(not
disputing people have gotten around them of course!), although the
building is
abandonded and has been since 1983, tuberculosis can still linger. I
never
experienced anything ghostly, not saying that this place isn't haunted.
For
Ammendale Normal Institute, I know this place ALL to well, at least
before they
demolished it 3 years ago(2006) however, the building was destroyed in
a fire
in 1998. Thinking about this place sends chills down my spine, a friend
of mine
lived about 10minutes walking through the woods from there, and we
would
constantly hang out around there.There were many noises of
rustling...when
nothing was around, no animals, no other people, and no wind. When I
had walked
in from the front of the building(there were no doors &amp; windows
gone,
mainly just a frame) you could view the entire inside was a large pit
of dismembermant,
I walked to my left into one room( there were no walls but you could
see the
frame of where things were) and I felt a strong brush passed me and a
second
later I felt a hand on my shoulder for a couple seconds.Another
experience, my
friend thought she had seen something moving on an upper level and I
said she
was crazy, but before we left I saw a "figure" for a brief second
standing in the lavatory just staring at us waiting for us to leave.
I'm amazed
of how well kept the cemetary was, and walking through the main path
way
through the tall black gates you could feel a change in presssure, like
you
weren't by yourself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hello, I have been
coming to
your site for a while, and I can not begin to explain how comforting it
is to
know that others have seen or experienced similar things to what I have
experienced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am not sure what the
connection is but I noticed that the majority of the events, that are
similar
to my own, are all experienced within a couple of years of the age of
thirteen.
Coincidence? Maybe, but it for sure strikes my interest. Seeing It was
my 12-13
years that I experienced these events.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
grew up in a two story victorian house(built 1906) in one of the oldest
neighborhoods in Oklahoma City.I moved there right before my tenth
birthday. It
was a simple but elegant victorian with incredible woodwork. It had a
huge
basement that was seperated into 5 different rooms, all creepy in their
own
right. But one room in particular, that always made me feel
uncomfortable. To
access this room you would have to crawl through what looked like a
trap door.
It was no bigger then 6 x 6 feet and had a dirt floor, unlike the rest
of the
basement which was either stone or concrete. For the first couple of
years we
lived their(moved in summer of 1985)no one in my family had ever
actually gone
into this room, mainly because there was no lighting in this room. All
we ever
did was just peak in with a flashlight. My father<span style="">&nbsp; </span>always
told us it was just the beginning of
the crawl space for the front of the house. He was half right. It was
the room
that connected to the crawl space but it also had a wooden ladder that
ran
along the backside of the chimney, from the basement all the way to a
walled
off room in the attic. I should mention that my parents had the attic
converted
to their master bedroom when we moved in. It was shaped like an +
symbol, and
in each of the four corners was a walled off area, all four were
thought to be
just empty spaces in the walls, but one was accessible from the
basement. My
friend and I climbed up the ladder, which was not pleasant seeing that
no one
had used it in about 80 years, that I could tell. When we reached the
top we
found a small storage space with maybe enough room for a couple of
children to
sit down in, a grown up would have had to move on all fours to get
around in
it. In this room were two paintings and a very old picture of the
surrounding
area circa 1906. The paintings were both portraits of two previous
owners, I am
guessing,They were both portraits of a victorian lady.. One a liitle
older then
the other, or maybe they were of the same women at differnet ages now
that I
really think about it. We still to this day can not figure out why they
were
stashed in such a odd place, but I am guesiing its because they wanted
them to
be left alone. Cause after that strange things started happening, and
then
abruptly stopped when I turned fourteen. The one event that I had that
I don&#8217;t
think I will ever be able to forget was waking to my bed shaking so
violently
that it almost threw me out of my own bed. I stood straight up and the
shaking
stopped, and jumped from the bed to the doorway, fearing there was
something
under the bed. I turned the lights on and ran out of the room. And the
door
slamed shut behind me. After waking my parents, I drug them downstairs
and made
them check the room before I would go back inside. Which by the way my
father
was not thrilled about when he found nothing in around or under my
bed.My mother
said she heard the noise from the bed shaking clearly upstairs, but my
father
said he did not. This happened one other time, but was no where near as
violent
as the first time. Shadows out of the corners of my eyes is what I saw
the
most, but one incident I saw the outline of a figure standing on the
main
landing of the stair case, kind of like a shadow with more depth. This
didn&#8217;t
really scare me, it gave me the feeling of sadness, and I got very
emotinal and
started to cry, but not from fear. There were many other events but
they were
small, and like I said they stopped around my fourteenth birthday.
There is
another type of incident that happened at least three times that I can
remember, but it was in another location. I don&#8217;t have time to go into
details
right now, but it was a abandoned hospital. I will write about that
next time.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I have been
investigating
haunted spots for a couple of years now (investigated over 10 places so
far)
and have had the interest in the paranormal for many years, actually
since high
school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It started when I got my first
book on the subject called "Ghosts I've Met," a Hans Holzer book.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>That was in 1965, I believe.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I read it when I was in high school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also
Suzy Parker's "Prominent American
Ghosts," (1967) which further interested me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thanks
to that book, I went to the Whaley
House in San Diego, California to check out the place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I talked to one of the ladies that worked
there, since it is now a museum for the public, and she mentioned some
of the
things going on there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rocking chair
upstairs is known to rock by itself once in awhile.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That was in 1971, when I took my first trip
to California.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had talked to people
about the subject every once in awhile and most people have had a story
to tell
that they had experienced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
checking out the Shadowlands store and found some great meters that I
use on my
investigations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My favorite meters are
The Ghost Meter and the K2 meter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have
communicated with both and also when I was on the Queen Mary ship in
Long
Beach, California in 2008.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
paranormal walking tour, hosted by a psychic, I used the K2 meter for
the yes
and no answers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One for yes and two for
no.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The yes answers were he was male,
was a sailor and died on the ship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
were many people on the tour and all had witnessed the communication
with the
meter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had gotten orbs in the swimming
pool on that ship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It doesn't have water
in it any longer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The changing room next
to the pool was also a hot spot for activity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They turned out all the lights in there and the only light was
from the
pool area filtering in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One woman
screamed, she saw a face in one of the darkened changing rooms.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The security officer mentioned he thought he
saw something move and I asked him to shine his light on it and it was
a light
bulb on the floor, which I saw rolling back and forth.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then it stopped suddenly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could
have been gimmicked, but then again
it wouldn't have been able to be seen if I hadn't asked for a light to
be shown
on it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only a very few of us actually
seen it move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ship is dry docked and
used for a hotel these days and like the psychic said at the beginning
of the
tour, if you feel the ship moving, that is a psychic experience right
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ship does not rock at all.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Only in a psychic re-enactment, when the ship
used to travel on the ocean.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, that is
more reason that it couldn't be why the light bulb moved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have much more to tell, but don't want to
write too much in an email at a time. Steve, the ghost hunting
"hobbyist."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I was reading all
the places
on your website after looking up the Pikeville college. I used to live
behind
the college several years ago. Because it was shorter I would cut
across the
campus when I walked to town. One day I got a really strong whiff of
what
smelled like a hospital. No one I was with could smell it but me. I
didn't know
until recently that there used to be a hospital there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Just thought you might like to know that as
well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know if you know anything
about the old Shelbiana school house, but I went there with some
relatives one
day because it was rumored to be haunted. While there it started
raining, but
as we were leaving we saw that it was only raining over the school and
no where
else. It was sunny everywhere else. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">By:yroserustler38104@yahoo.comy<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I bought a old home
in
Memphis in 1985 and spent the next 24 years remodeling the home and
landscaping
the grounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house was a craftsman
style cottage built in 1911 and had originally 1400 square feet.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>After the remodeling the house had 1800
square feet and a master bedroom upstairs in what had originally been
the
attic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I first moved into the house
in the Cooper-Young historic district I had no idea that I was sharing
the home
with others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The major remodeling to the
house started about 5 or 6 years ago and most of the activity began
then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My family has a history of being
sensitive to
spirits and I have the "sensitive" gene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
house originally had floor furnaces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
were gas heaters in the floor and were
original to the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To get to the
room I used as an office and computer room you had to move over one of
the
furnaces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You couldn't avoid stepping on
The furnace every time you exited or entered the room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It made a very distinctive sound as anyone
that has ever had the heaters in their house is familiar with.
Frequently when
I was in the office on the computer I would hear and feel someone move
over the
heater and stand there and peek around the corner at me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Eventually it became time to remodel the
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was working in the room one
day and building and installing bookcases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The room was only 13 x 13.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I
worked on the cabinets I put my hammer on the floor left the room to
get some
nails and came back to find the hammer gone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I work on my projects I seem to spend most of my time
trying to
find my tools - usually where I put it down somewhere and forget where
I put it
- LOL!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought this is when
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hammer was a large framing
hammer about 16 to 18 inches long and red.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After searching everywhere I remembered I had been told if
something disappears
to go outside the area and ask to have the thing returned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This I did and when I walked back into the
room the hammer was there leaning against the wall resting on its head!<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Several people claim to have seen shadow
people in my home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have seen nothing
but have heard some shocking things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
had a dog pass away in the home and she evidently visited me after her
passing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was a dog that had hip
problems and wore a collar with a jingly ID on it and she made a
distinctive
sound when she walked and went upstairs to the master bedroom.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>One night I was in bed upstairs reading with
one of my other dogs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard her come
up the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought I was imagining
things but the dogs laying beside me was looking at the stairs with his
head
cocked to one side - so he evidently heard the same thing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The most frightening thing that happened to
me in the house also happened upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One night I was drifting to sleep and heard someone scream in my
ear
"HEY" and then like she was talking to someone else saying "he
heard me".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That freaked me out.
Soon I calmed down and finally went to sleep but I was always curious
as to
what they wanted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never found out and
moved from the house two years ago.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
