<p><b>My Many Strange Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cdasilva1@sprint.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>I started experiencing strange things at a very young age.&nbsp;
My earliest recollection was when I was around 5 or 6 yrs of age.&nbsp;
I grew up in Scarborough, Ontario.&nbsp; While sleeping one night ( I shared
a bed with my oldest sister) I awoke to see a very tall man, dressed all
in black standing beside our bed looking down at us.&nbsp; He wore a jacket
one would see in a photo from the 17-1800's and had, I think a sort of
top hat.&nbsp; I remember being terrified. I tried waking my sister but
did not want to move much to really attract his attention.&nbsp; The next
morning I asked my parents who it was that came to our room in the middle
of the night all dressed in black.&nbsp; Nobody believed me. I remember
being terrified while living in this house and was thrilled to learn we
were moving.</b>
<br><b>Nothing significant happened after that until I was married and
became pregnant with my daughter.&nbsp; My next strange encounter happened
while staying at my in-laws home as they had gone away and my sister-in-law
was to afraid to stay in the house on her own.&nbsp; While my husband and
sister-in-law were at work (it was around 9:00 am) I was lying in bed about
to get up when a heard a voice in the diningroom say "Where's Brandy" (
the family dog who was tied up outside but hadn't barked to indicate someone
had come to the house)</b>
<br><b>My first thought was that someone had broken into the house, so
I pretended to be asleep hoping that if they saw me they would run out.
All of a sudden my body became very tense and I could sense that someone
was standing at the end of the bed watching me. This feeling lasted for
approximately 2 minutes when all of a sudden my body relaxed and I knew
that I was alone again.</b>
<br><b>I opened my eyes and sure enough no one was there, all the doors&nbsp;
were locked and I realized that the dog had not made a sound.&nbsp; Talking
with my in-laws, they stated that they had sometimes seen a person in another
part of the house out of the corner of their eyes.&nbsp; I also remembered
sitting in the livingroom, which was at the front of the house, and could
swear someone was walking up the outside&nbsp; stairs&nbsp; leading&nbsp;
to the front door only to look and find no one there.</b>
<br><b>My husband and I bought our first home, a townhouse, when my daughter
turned one.&nbsp; Whenever I laid down in the afternoon, with my daughter
for her afternoon nap, I would always here someone pacing back and forth
in the unfinished part of the basement.&nbsp; Whenever I would get up,
and go part way down the main floor stairs, the pacing would stop.&nbsp;
One day my husband and I planned to be away for the night, but at the last
minute decided to go home instead.&nbsp; We arrived home just after midnight.
While waiting for my husband to get out his keys, I noticed the front curtains
moving as though someone had been looking out and had just released them.
I mentioned this to my husband and we both thought maybe someone had broken
in. He already had the keys in the lock and was determined to check.&nbsp;
As he tried to open the door he said it felt like someone was pushing the
door from the opposite side. He gave a heavy push against the door and
suddenly there was this bright flash of light from inside the house.&nbsp;
Looking inside we neither saw nor heard anyone running away.</b>
<br><b>Looking around I noticed that our staircase light was on and mentioned
it to my husband.&nbsp; He responded that I must have left it before we
left. I answered " That light has been broken for months, why would it
come on after all this time,"&nbsp; My husband tries to justify the flash
of light as coming from the parking lot behind our townhouse but if you
could see the set up of our townhouse&nbsp; you would understand that this
theory was impossible.&nbsp; For the light to reach our front door it would
have to go though a 6 foot privacy fence, down a small hill and around
three corners before it would even reach the&nbsp; doorway.</b>
<br><b>I had to go for some minor surgery, the next morning my husband
picked me up at the hospital, dropped my off at my sisters penthouse apartment
and left.&nbsp; I fell asleep on the sofa.&nbsp; I woke up around 11:00
am and lay there with my eyes closed thinking I should get up and have
something to eat when I felt something hit the back of the sofa (it was
set up so that you walked behind it to go down the hall to the bedrooms)
as if someone had banged it with their hip.&nbsp; My body went very tense.
I could then hear someone walk from behind the sofa, around the coffee
table to stand in front of my face.&nbsp; I was lying with my back to the
back of the sofa and my head was on a pillow.&nbsp; Suddenly, someone hit
the pillow just in front of my face twice.&nbsp; My body then totally relaxed
and I knew that I was now alone.&nbsp; Checked out the apartment and nothing.</b>
<br><b>Next, while staying with the same sister and her family one Christmas
Eve, my daughter and I slept in my nephews room while my husband slept
on the couch in the livingroom.&nbsp; My husband is not the type to seek
his own comfort at my&nbsp; expense yet this night he came into our room
saying he could not sleep and would I exchange places with him.&nbsp; Not
thinking this strange or even question him, we traded places.&nbsp; I fell
asleep but woke up a short time later. Looking at the clock it read 12:14
AM. I closed my eyes thinking I would have a hard time falling asleep again
when I felt something crawling over the arm of the sofa where my head was.&nbsp;
Thinking it was one of the children sneaking in to see if Santa had come,
I was about to open my eyes and yell "what are you doing out of bed", when
I felt a shock touch me on the top of my head and travel to about my waist.
Nervous, I again tried to open my eyes only to get another shock.&nbsp;
Truly scared now, I thought I will try this once more and if it happens
again, I am going to scream bloody murder. I opened my eyes and nothing,
looked at the clock and it read 12:16 am.&nbsp; I ran into my husband and
said. "don't ask me why, just change places with me."&nbsp; He got up,
said nothing, and promptly fell asleep in the livingroom.</b>
<br><b>I can't explain why any of these things happened to me but I know
that I was not asleep when these things happened.&nbsp; My youngest nephew
was terrified of that apartment and he was around 2 - 4 when they lived
there and there were parts of the apartment he would not sit, be rocked
or go alone.</b>

<p><b>Nighttime Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LGodzilla1@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi.&nbsp; I think your website is great! I read the ghost stories
almost every</b>
<br><b>day.&nbsp; I know you hear this all of the time,but I do not really
believe in</b>
<br><b>ghosts or the supernatural.</b>
<br><b>But since I have been reading your site and have experienced a few
strange</b>
<br><b>things of my own,I decided that I had better keep an open mind.&nbsp;
So,here goes</b>
<br><b>one of four</b>
<br><b>experiences I have had in my 33 years;&nbsp; My husband and I bought
our very</b>
<br><b>first home in 1997(we still live here)and it is a fairly new home,great</b>
<br><b>suburban neighborhood here in Texas. Anyway,no bad past attached
to the house</b>
<br><b>according to the previous owner and the neighbors who have lived
here from</b>
<br><b>day one.&nbsp; My husband works nights and</b>
<br><b>I work days and juggle three children so I am pretty exhausted at
night when</b>
<br><b>I finally get to bed;&nbsp; One night back in August 2000 I had
awoke sometime</b>
<br><b>after midnight.</b>
<br><b>I was asleep flat on my back(which I never do unless pregnant)and
I had felt</b>
<br><b>what I thought to be a cat jump on the end of my bed,walk across
my</b>
<br><b>ankles,turn around a few times and curl up between my ankles.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well,&nbsp; I&nbsp; did</b>
<br><b>not have a cat at that time,I had a great dane puppy who slept directly
under</b>
<br><b>my bed.I was wondering why he did not wake up or sense the cat in
the room.</b>
<br><b>As a matter of fact,I remember thinking where&nbsp; in the hell
was that dog when</b>
<br><b>I heard him under the bed snoring!!&nbsp; I was just about to open
my eyes and run</b>
<br><b>the cat off when I felt a finger reach over&nbsp; and take a strand
of my hair</b>
<br><b>from the side of my face and curl it ever so slowly around the finger
and</b>
<br><b>then let it drop.(my hair is long,naturally curly and curls easily
with a</b>
<br><b>finger twist such as this)Then the finger reached over and repeated
the</b>
<br><b>process a few more times</b>
<br><b>I need to say,the whole time this incident was taking place,I did
not open my</b>
<br><b>eyes</b>
<br><b>Something in my mind just told me not to because I did not want
to see who or</b>
<br><b>what it was;My children are very small and if they had come in the
room they</b>
<br><b>would have just jumped in the bed and crashed back out.&nbsp; I
seriously doubt</b>
<br><b>they would have stood there gently playing with my hair.I finally
decided to</b>
<br><b>turn onto myright side very quickly to see if the "cat" would fall
off.I</b>
<br><b>did,but nothing happened.I opened my eyes,</b>
<br><b>there was no one there. My husband came in the front door about
thirty</b>
<br><b>minutes later and I went back to sleep. Just a note;I was not asleep,as
I</b>
<br><b>live on the corner of a very</b>
<br><b>busy street and I could hear the traffic outside,my next door neighbors</b>
<br><b>teenager pulling in the driveway w/his stereo blasting,my dog snoring
loudly</b>
<br><b>I might add.</b>
<br><b>Nothing since but I still get chills when I remember.&nbsp; Anybody
want to tell</b>
<br><b>me what they think?&nbsp; I am not a "crackpot" (which is what I
felt like later)</b>
<br><b>I am well educated,</b>
<br><b>the mother of three children and I try to attend church regularly
(Southern</b>
<br><b>Baptist)as is my husband. Any responses welcome!!!</b>

<br><b>Headless Horseman Road</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: BigLudo@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose that some people think of&nbsp; me as
weird, but I've been having</b>
<br><b>paranormal experiences for much of my life. I have trouble telling
this to</b>
<br><b>alot of my friends and family, because most of the time no one believes
me.</b>
<br><b>Many of my experiences have to with some thing I just don't understand,
but</b>
<br><b>most of them half to do with the dead.&nbsp; Many people think that
my stories and</b>
<br><b>what I say are stange and made up. But all of my stories are true
and I don't</b>
<br><b>lie, especially when it comes to these things. Take this story for
instence...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was riding home from one of my perfomances
when my mother turned to go</b>
<br><b>on the back rode.&nbsp; "The Headless Horseman Road" we always called
it, because</b>
<br><b>it always reminded us of a place like "Sleepy Hollow".&nbsp; We
were driving down</b>
<br><b>it and we went past a graveyard.&nbsp; I always read things about
ghosts and knew</b>
<br><b>that ghosts almost never dwell in graveyards, but I still felt uneasy
about</b>
<br><b>where we were at.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mom? I'm just gonna cover my eyes going past
this graveyard, because i</b>
<br><b>don't feel very confortable, okay?" I said to my mom. She just said
that we</b>
<br><b>were safe in the car, but she had a feeling that I would get a little
scared.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;She knows that I see things that other people don't, but she
still thinks</b>
<br><b>I'm a little different.(as in crazy)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once we passed the graveyard, I was alright and
I opened my eyes.&nbsp; What I</b>
<br><b>saw was not what I expected to see, or want to see.&nbsp; Beside
the graveyard are</b>
<br><b>fields that run behind the Basilica near my house.&nbsp; I looked
out my window</b>
<br><b>and saw a man in the distance who was glowing.&nbsp; It wasn't a
bright</b>
<br><b>outstanding glow, but it was a pale, soft and erie glow.&nbsp; He
was wearing a</b>
<br><b>long robe that fell fast hie feet and his arms were folded.&nbsp;
As we were</b>
<br><b>driving past, I saw that the man was staring at me, and his face
was</b>
<br><b>following the car.&nbsp; I let out a tiny noise, and all of a sudden
the man</b>
<br><b>disappeared.&nbsp; I was a little shaken up by this and I told my
mother.&nbsp; And she</b>
<br><b>actually BELIEVED me.&nbsp; When I got home I told my sister and
she was a little</b>
<br><b>jealous that I saw a ghost and she didn't, but I told her that it
wasn't an</b>
<br><b>exciting experiance.&nbsp; It was scary.&nbsp; But now I'm not afraid
of the dead</b>
<br><b>anymore, because i know that they don't want to hurt us, and that
thay're</b>
<br><b>just lost soles who don't know where they are, or where to go.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are so many more experiences that I've
had with the strange and</b>
<br><b>unknown, but this was just one of them.&nbsp; my advice to anyone
who sees a ghost</b>
<br><b>is to not get scared and run away, but to tell them that they're
dead and</b>
<br><b>they can move on now.&nbsp; If that doesn't work, than put God into
the picture by</b>
<br><b>saying something about Him protecting you, and in His name you demand
them to</b>
<br><b>leave.&nbsp; No matter how frightning or powerful these forces might
be, they</b>
<br><b>ALWAYS obay God.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just wanted to send in one of my experiences,
because I read that we're</b>
<br><b>among friends here, and I wanted to say that I really appriciate
how you</b>
<br><b>understand and take these kinds of things seriously just like I
do.</b>

<p><b>My Recent Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: NamasteW1@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I would like to submit my story that happened to me just last week.
I have</b>
<br><b>never sighted a ghost before until then and I wasn't scared at all.
It was</b>
<br><b>when I had just awaken from a deep sleep and when I sleep heavily,
I have</b>
<br><b>strange dreams and sometimes nightmares.</b>
<br><b>This particular day, I had a strange dream of being in a spiritual
world that</b>
<br><b>was parellel to this world. It was beautiful and I even got to visit
friends</b>
<br><b>that passed over, so I woke up feeling good but disappointed that
I woke up.</b>
<br><b>I got up to wash my face and brush my teeth. In my bathroom, there
is a</b>
<br><b>mirror above the sink. Through the mirror, you could see my bathroom
door</b>
<br><b>which had light from my living room boucing off of it. Since the
hallway</b>
<br><b>leading to the bathroom is curved only part of the door is lit up.</b>
<br><b>When I looked up, I happened to notice that there was a clear shape
of figure</b>
<br><b>in the glare that was on the door as if someone was coming down
the hall to</b>
<br><b>the bathroom, where I was at. I just stared at this figure surprised
because</b>
<br><b>I was alone in my house. Then I had a strange feeling that this
was the</b>
<br><b>presence that was responsible for my strange dreams.</b>
<br><b>I looked down at the sink full of water and closed my eyes tight
and when I</b>
<br><b>opened them the figure was gone.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Lack of Sleep</b><b></b>
<p><b>From: Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>well here's my story. I am 25 years old and I live in the San Diego
area. I</b>
<br><b>have been reading this sites stories for a couple of weeks now and
my story</b>
<br><b>seems to partially match a lot of peoples stories. First I have
had a long</b>
<br><b>history in seeing things in my peripheral (probably because I am
legally</b>
<br><b>blind in one eye) and hearing things, but most of that went away
as I grew</b>
<br><b>older. The start to my latest experience was about a year and a
half ago</b>
<br><b>when I awoke like three nights in a row with what seemed to be a
shadow</b>
<br><b>(only darker then any other shadows in the room) in the shape of
(the first</b>
<br><b>thing that came to mind) the grim reaper. it was about 7 feet tall
with a</b>
<br><b>hooded cloak that just seemed to be even darker inside. no face,
no eyes,</b>
<br><b>just scary as hell. I would turn the lamp on my night stand on and
it would</b>
<br><b>disappear. after three times it never appeared again. I moved about
a year</b>
<br><b>later to another condo. this one is about 25 years old and seemed
fine when</b>
<br><b>my roommate and myself moved in. about three months later I started
feeling</b>
<br><b>like I was being watched when I was home alone. then I awoke one
night to</b>
<br><b>somebody (in a loud whisper real close to my ear) saying "Hey!"
it woke me</b>
<br><b>up and I felt very scared. I have had a few more of those incidents
sense</b>
<br><b>that day but they started getting more aggressive like, being shaken
awake</b>
<br><b>by somebody holding my ankles at the end of my bed. I have recently
been</b>
<br><b>having the feeling of falling when I am just about to fall asleep.
then</b>
<br><b>realizing it was something slowly pushing down on my chest and letting
go as</b>
<br><b>soon as I wake up. the scariest so far has been when I was sleeping
on my</b>
<br><b>stomach and had my left arm extended out of the bed and I woke up
to</b>
<br><b>somebody pulling my arm and making me feel like I was being spun
around. I</b>
<br><b>couldn't open my eyes and I couldn't scream for what seemed to be
about 15</b>
<br><b>seconds, then finally it let go and I was so incredibly afraid when
I opened</b>
<br><b>my eyes that I would be laying sideways. I opened them and to my
surprise I</b>
<br><b>was laying in the same position I had fallen asleep in. Some of
the</b>
<br><b>strangest things are that my room mate doesn't see or feel anything.
He even</b>
<br><b>has a dog that never seems to be bothered. I have had one girl out
of about</b>
<br><b>five spend the night and she could barely sleep that night I think
mainly</b>
<br><b>because I told her. most of my friends are pretty supportive of
whets been</b>
<br><b>happening to me but most aren't bothered by anything in my house.
I</b>
<br><b>sometimes think I should move very quickly and then I will change
my mind</b>
<br><b>and be fine with it. one last thing all this stuff has only happened
at</b>
<br><b>night. I feel completely safe and normal in the day time. I really
hope this</b>
<br><b>is happening to me and not my overactive imagination.</b>

<p><b>My Aunts House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Huey0125@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin my Aunt live in Florida on an
old plantation where battles</b>
<br><b>during the civil was took place.&nbsp; There is an old barn in the
back that is</b>
<br><b>now part of the house.&nbsp; And her house is an expansion of an
old school that</b>
<br><b>was once there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well we just went down there in April
for Spring break.&nbsp; We had a lot</b>
<br><b>of fun until the nights came.&nbsp; I was staying in my own appartment
out in the</b>
<br><b>barn.&nbsp; My friend was right upstairs an my cousin was upstairs
next to my</b>
<br><b>friend.&nbsp; All three of us were in our own appts.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a Tuesday night my friend
was the only one there.&nbsp; His CD</b>
<br><b>player stopped in the middle of one song and started playing it
backwards.</b>
<br><b>He fixed then it paused and started to speed up.&nbsp; It then stopped
again and</b>
<br><b>then began playing slowly and the words in the song were mixed up.&nbsp;
We don't</b>
<br><b>think that there was anything wrong with the CD player because he
bought it a</b>
<br><b>week before he got there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; later in the week I believe a Thursday
we were in the room.&nbsp; We heard</b>
<br><b>talking and we believe that it was coming from the little closets
in the</b>
<br><b>corners.&nbsp; At first we expected that it was my younger sisters.&nbsp;
We thought</b>
<br><b>they found the spare keys and hid themselves.&nbsp; Well we were
wrong there</b>
<br><b>wasn't anybody anywhere in the house but we continued to hear the
talking.</b>
<br><b>We didn't see anybody either.&nbsp; Then we began to hear someone
cry.&nbsp; We left,</b>
<br><b>yes we were too scared to stay.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night I was in my appartment
and there is a game room next door.</b>
<br><b>And there is a window in between the two.&nbsp; Well I saw a figure
in that</b>
<br><b>window.&nbsp; But I never heard the outside door open.&nbsp; I got
up the courage to go</b>
<br><b>close the blind.&nbsp; I got to the window and the figure just stared
abck at me.</b>
<br><b>Like I wasn't even there.&nbsp; It was opaque and covered in rags.&nbsp;
That seemed to</b>
<br><b>be drenched in blood.&nbsp; I shut the blind and went into the room
to bed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Friday my last night there my
cousin finally told us about the</b>
<br><b>hauntings that seemed to be continuos.&nbsp; He explained that many
bodies use to</b>
<br><b>be thrown into the river behind the house where alligators would
eat them or</b>
<br><b>they would be swept away.&nbsp; He told us that he also heard the
talking and</b>
<br><b>people walking around.&nbsp; Although he never heard the crying.&nbsp;
And he had once</b>
<br><b>seen three ghosts in one of the rooms.</b>
<br><b>Well that is all.</b>

<p><b>Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Mapper@visuallink.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My story begins at my dads house, I don't know how many people lived
in it</b>
<br><b>before my mom and dad moved in. Anyway, I never really had a problem
with</b>
<br><b>spirits in my house until one day I had laid a doll on my bed, that
I had</b>
<br><b>been playing with, and I turned around for a second and it was on
the floor.</b>
<br><b>I knew I had put it on my bed and wasn't sure what happened. Other
things</b>
<br><b>were moved like that like, pens, books, hairbrushes, and lots of
other stuff</b>
<br><b>that I know where I had put it. That was just the beginning. At
night I'd</b>
<br><b>wake up to hear footsteps going up and down the stairs, and someone
walking</b>
<br><b>around on the bottom floor, and hearing all of my family asleep,
I</b>
<br><b>originally thought it was a burgler, so I snuck up on the footsteps
one</b>
<br><b>night, and no one was there, and there's only one set of stairs.
So, I was</b>
<br><b>very spooked, and I silently got back into bed, and as I was about
to go to</b>
<br><b>sleep, a cold hand pressed on one of my shoulders, I turned my light
on</b>
<br><b>immediatly, and no one was there. And when i was sure no one was
in the</b>
<br><b>room, I tried to go back to sleep, when I heard soft whispering,
I don't</b>
<br><b>know what they were saying, but I was terrified. I finally got to
sleep that</b>
<br><b>night but the sounds are still there, and I can still feel someone
is</b>

<br><b>The Black Window</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jwlennon9@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Here's my dear little experience with a ghost.&nbsp; First,</b>
<br><b>here's the backround.&nbsp; My house was built in the</b>
<br><b>1940's.&nbsp; My family has been the only one to live in</b>
<br><b>it.&nbsp; My great-grandma and my grandma both died in it.</b>
<br><b>My great-grandma in my bedroom and my grandma in my</b>
<br><b>living room.&nbsp; One night a few years ago, I was home</b>
<br><b>alone listening to the Beatles.&nbsp; I felt something</b>
<br><b>persuade me to look towards a painting on the wall.</b>
<br><b>In the window in the house in the painting, there is</b>
<br><b>nothing.&nbsp; It is painted black.&nbsp; This time when I</b>
<br><b>looked at it, there was a person in the window.</b>
<br><b>Naturally, I freaked out.&nbsp; Naturally.&nbsp; So, I got up</b>
<br><b>and bolted to my bedroom.&nbsp; The radio was blasting</b>
<br><b>"Blackbird" by the Beatles.&nbsp; I crawled under my cotton</b>
<br><b>blanket (there were no pillows on the bed) and</b>
<br><b>huddled.&nbsp; I felt something soft under me.&nbsp; I took off</b>
<br><b>the banket and noticed I was lying in a bed of black</b>
<br><b>feathers.&nbsp; Beatles song Blackbird seemed to get louder</b>
<br><b>as I began to shake and wait for someone, anyone, to</b>
<br><b>get home.</b>

<p><b>I was 12 yrs. old and I saw&nbsp; smoke&nbsp; coming from an old&nbsp;
fashion type</b>
<br><b>heat register in the wall. This was a very old home across from
Woodland</b>
<br><b>cemetary At first I thought&nbsp; the&nbsp; house was on fire,but
this smoke took</b>
<br><b>foam and moved&nbsp; in front of my chair. I could not see the chair&nbsp;
when</b>
<br><b>this&nbsp; form was in&nbsp; front of&nbsp; it . It&nbsp; was moving
across the room slowly.</b>
<br><b>I ran downstairs .My parents were not&nbsp; beleivers in such things
even tho</b>
<br><b>my father had heard many strange sounds durung the late hours of
the</b>
<br><b>night. I to had hreard these sounds and seen my father&nbsp; looking
around</b>
<br><b>for the source.The sounds were always&nbsp; coming from the hall
closet where</b>
<br><b>the attic ladder was&nbsp; located.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I had&nbsp; descided&nbsp; that no one would</b>
<br><b>admitt to&nbsp; hearing&nbsp; the sounds or believing my story.
I spoke outloud</b>
<br><b>that I was not able to leave this place, and that I believed&nbsp;

<br><b>My Grandmother</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tiggerlc11@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My family moved to New Mexico because my grandma was very sick .
We stayed at her house for the time she was sick. Then it came to a point
where all my aunts and uncles were in town because my grandms was getting
worse and was in the hospital. So while my whole family was at the hospital,
I was at my grandma's housebabysitting my sister and cousins. this has
happened many times before. But this time, I was worried. It was late and
all the kids were asleep. So I had to sleep on the couch. It was dark in
the house,with only the little lamp on. I was talking on the phone with
my friend from school. I was telling her about my grandma, and how I was
worried. I was getting to tired to talk on the phone. So we hung up. I
drifted off to sleep.</b>
<br><b>I heard the front door opened and it was my grandma.She was dressed
in her little flannel like she always wears at home. I got so scared. I
could not move. My grandma keeps a little portable heater in the living
room. She walked up to the heater and was trying to turn it on. But for
some reason she couldn't turn it on. I was so afraid. I walked up to her
and helped her turn it on. It was as if she was cold. Just then I saw lights
of a car driving up the driveway. I ran outside to see my mom and dad getting
out of the car crying. I started to panic and cry. I shouted " grandma
is inside! why is grandma inside? what happened?". My mom said " what are
you talking about grandma just passed away. We walked inside, to see that
no one was there.</b>
<br><b>That was when I woke up. I realized it was just a dream. I looked
at the clock. It was 2:00 am exactly. I got scared, and started to cry.
I some how knew my grandma didn't make it. I drifted off to sleep.</b>
<br><b>Then I heard the front door open. I got scared again. It wa my mom.
It looked like she was crying. I knew right then that my grandma was gone.
She sat on the couch with me and told me that my grandma had pasted away
at 2:00 am exaclty.</b>
<br><b>Nothing like that has ever happened to me before. I think that everyone
thinks that I have made it up. But I will never forget the night my grandma
was cold.</b>

<p><b>My Childhood Ghost</b><b></b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This
ghost is o longer a problem for me as we live in a new house</b>
<br><b>but I thought maybe you could clear something up for me. I'm fifteen
years</b>
<br><b>old now, we moved into our old house when I was a year old and moved
from it</b>
<br><b>when I was ten. Before us an old couple lived in the house, the
man passed</b>
<br><b>away in hospital (I think) leaving his widow behind, she buried
his ashes in</b>
<br><b>an urn in the garden but took it with her when she left. Since I
was born I</b>
<br><b>suffered from insomnia (don't know if that's spelt right) and when
I was</b>
<br><b>about three I used to sit up to all hours in the morning having
nothing else</b>
<br><b>to do, at this point I began to see a tall man walking up and down
the</b>
<br><b>hallway. I automatically thought it was my Dad becuase he's a tall
man, but</b>
<br><b>one night I had a nightmare and I saw the man walk past towards
my parents</b>
<br><b>bedroom, being scared I jumped up and ran after him into my parents
bedroom</b>
<br><b>and I found both my parents asleep. I woke my Dad up and he declared
it</b>
<br><b>wasn't him. Since that I realised it wasn't my dad and everytime
I saw him</b>
<br><b>walk past (which was just about every night) I used to hide under
my covers</b>
<br><b>frightened the 'boegy man' would get me. Then after about a month
when the</b>
<br><b>man walked past I was about to hide under my covers when what looked
like</b>
<br><b>the shadow of a lion walked past him into my room. It walked right
up to my</b>
<br><b>bed and faded into the floor. After that whenever late at night
I was scared</b>
<br><b>or saw the man, the lion shadow would appear. When I stopped being
scared of</b>
<br><b>the man and the dark the lion stopped comming.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Hot Spots</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Cplprice@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I was interested in finding out if hot spots are ever associated
with</b>
<br><b>hauntings. I went to a location that is reportedly haunted (not
looking for</b>
<br><b>ghosts) I have been there hundreds of times, about 50% of the time
at nite, I</b>
<br><b>have never seen anything I would consider paranormal. Most people
are afraid</b>
<br><b>of going to this location at nite. Friday nite May 18, 2001 myself&nbsp;
(a) and</b>
<br><b>two (b&amp;c)others were at this place. One of the three (c) was
about 50yds.</b>
<br><b>behind us having fallen behind coming up a hill. I was standing
talking to</b>
<br><b>(b) and we both took a step forward at the same time. We both stepped
back</b>
<br><b>quickly and looked at each other. I said "did you feel that" and
he said</b>
<br><b>"yeah it was really hot, that is really weird". We stepped forward,
to the</b>
<br><b>same spot, again and it was gone. The third person (c) had caught
up with us</b>
<br><b>and we continued up the hill, we had gone maybe thirty feet when
we (a&amp;b) hit</b>
<br><b>the same type of warm spot again. We stopped and when (c) caught
up with us</b>
<br><b>again we told him what we had felt and he tried to find the spot
with no</b>
<br><b>success. We felt the same thing once or twice more that nite and
can think of</b>
<br><b>no rational explanation. The warm spot was noticeably warmer maybe
even hot,</b>
<br><b>the air temperature was in the mid 70's when we noticed the spot,
and it was</b>
<br><b>a good deal warmer, at least 30 degrees. The spot was probably two
to three</b>
<br><b>feet in diameter and at least 6' 2'' high. There was no wind blowing
and</b>
<br><b>there was no noticeable air movement in the spot. The heat could
be best</b>
<br><b>described as about like your car heater turned all the way up (but
without</b>
<br><b>the blowing). The spot only lasted a second or two and when we stepped
out of</b>
<br><b>the spot and stepped back in it was no longer there. We experienced
the same</b>
<br><b>thing several times in several different locations. Even though
the place we</b>
<br><b>were at is notoriously haunted we have never seen a ghost.</b>

<p><b>Horrible Night</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Dottywho@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I never really think of my house being haunted. Just a nice new house
with no</b>
<br><b>deaths or anything to make these things happen. I notice things
like my radio</b>
<br><b>turning on and things dropping off desks for no reason, but nothing
like what</b>
<br><b>happened to me a few nights ago. I woke up somtime in the middle
of the night</b>
<br><b>and the first thing I noticed was that it was so cold, I could see
my breath.</b>
<br><b>I rolled over and pulled the covers around me. Then I came face
to face with</b>
<br><b>two glowing red eyes at the corner of my room. Being the wimp that
I am, I</b>
<br><b>pulled the blanket over my head and closed my eyes. I began to feel
somthing</b>
<br><b>poking my legs through the covers. I reached over and tried to turn
on the</b>
<br><b>lights and I felt somthing grab my arm, somthing ice cold. I looked
up and</b>
<br><b>saw three things that looked human like but almost see-through flying
around</b>
<br><b>my room. Out of my open door, in the darkness, I saw a pulsing green
light.</b>
<br><b>By then I was in hysterics, screaming for my parents like a baby.

<br><b>&nbsp; Children and Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: zooangel@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I visit your site requently and I really enjoy it. Today, while looking
through it, I read your page about children and ghosts. It made me think
of my 16 year old son. When he was four, we lived in a two bedroom aprtment.
We were one of two aprtments on that floor. From the time that we moved
in he refused to sleep in his own bedroom. He claimed that there was a
monster in his room. Every night, I would wake up with him in my bed. Finally
I put my foot down and refused to let him in bed with me. Still, every
night he would leave his room. I would find him in the morning sleeping
on my bedroom floor, out side my door, the livingroom, everywhere but his
own room. Jokingly, I said to a friend, maybe there's something in there
but I just can't see it. Finally I switched the rooms around. I gave him
my room and I moved my stuff into his. He slept in his own bed from then
on.</b>
<br><b>I didn't really believe in ghosts then, so that thought never entered
my mind. My friend moved next door to where we used to live a few years
ago. Upon getting to know her neighbors, she found out that the apartment
across the hall from the apartment that I used to live in is haunted. This
same apartment shares a wall with the bedroom that my son refused to sleep
in. Over the years I have had many experiences with several ghosts and
now I do believe that the "monster" in my son's old bedroom was most likely
the ghost from next door that only he could see. I slept in that room for
over a year and I never saw anything......not in that apartment anyhow.
The apartment building next door that my friend moved into is also haunted
by at least two spirits, both of which I have encountered. One is a female
in her mid twenties. Although she can be a prankster and very emotional
at times, she was nice. The other one, however was an older man that just
sent chills through your spine if you happened to be walking up the front
steps and his presence was there. I only encounterd him maybe twice, the
feeling I got when I went up the front stairs creeped me out so bad that
I never entered the apartment that way, I used the back stairs. I could
go on about all that happened there but I won't right now. I just wanted
to tell you that I know children can see things that us adults can not.
Also, my nine year old sees something in our house from time to time. She's
the only one that sees it. She refers to it as her. She sees her in our
upstairs hallway at night. She is a shadow about 3 feet tall, with long
hair. A couple friends have told me that they felt the presence of a youg
girl here, however I never mentioned it to my kids. Like I said, kids CAN
see things that we adults can not.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Edgar Allan Crow</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SpookyCatBoy@msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>The following is a story which I will never forget and seems always
to be met with either a reaction of severe heebiejeebies or condescending
incomprihension.</b>
<br><b>I live on the south side of St. Louis, MO.My parents backyard is
wild,overgrown and a horticulturist's nitemare.In the winter it is a haven
for wild birds,stray cats, and squirrels.My mother and I have made it a
habit of feeding these creatures, especially in the winter.In 1998 winter
came early and we had snow on the ground by mid-Nov (16/17).The next day
after the snow stopped I went outside to feed the birds and to give them
warm water and I noticed something unusual; a crow,usually not the tamest
of birds,instead of quickly flying away, came walking toward me.It hung
around all day and by the following day was literally eating out of my
hand.I eventually named him or her Edgar, after Edgar Allan Poe who wrote
"The Raven".Edgar for nearly six months was a daily visitor.Sometimes he
would stay in our yard all day long, other times we'd only see him for
a few hours.Ed was very affectionet.He (I mostly referred to him as male)
would always sit on either our heads or shoulders when we would go outside
and stayed mainly in the backyard and only very rarely ventured to the
front yard.He would peck at our back window and caw to get out attention
and he was also friendly with our next neighbors, particulary the wife,
who was also an animal lover and owned a parrot.One of the most amazing
things about Ed was his ability to see me from nearly a half-mile away
and how he would then fly staight for me and land on my shoulder.We fed
him daily a variety of different foods,as did the couple nextdoor,and I
took many pictures of him. He also had a mate who was not tame and never
came closer then the telephone pole in the alley out back. He dissapeared
on April 2,1999.</b>
<br><b>Now The WEIRD PART</b>
<br><b>After Edgar left I remembered something odd which happened to me
two months before his arrival.I was at St. Matthew's Cemetery one day visiting
the grave of a friend of mine who had died(a suicide) five years prior.
I was slowing down to park on the road near her grave when I noticed something
on resting in front of the headstone. It was a crow. As I neared it I noticed
how lifelike it was even though I knew it wasn't alive.I believe it was
a taxidermist crow. One last point of interest that I might add (however
anticlimatical) is that Edgar returned for a two day visit on Oct.10-11,1999.
He was rather subdued and spent his time mainly sleeping and eating. And
that was the last time I saw him.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ghost Encounter</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: pdb1951@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I recently came across your site and thougtht it is very well done.
I am</b>
<br><b>submitting an experience that both my oldest brother and i experienced.&nbsp;
In</b>
<br><b>October of 1981 i moved from Houston, Texas to St Petersburg, Florida
and</b>
<br><b>moved in with my eldest brother who was 36 yrs old at the time and
i was 30.</b>
<br><b>It was a small one bedroom apt. in a small apt. complex of around
20 units.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
His bedroom was in</b>
<br><b>the back of the apt. and i slept on the sleeper sofa in the living
room.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Almost immediately I</b>
<br><b>sensed that something just wasn't right. I couldn't put my finger
on it, but</b>
<br><b>there was just something!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I'd catch glimpes out the</b>
<br><b>corner of my eye of something, but when i'd turn towards where i
had just</b>
<br><b>glimped something, nothing was ever there. This went on for weeks.
Also at</b>
<br><b>the same time, when i would go to the bathroom at night, through
the</b>
<br><b>ventilation fan, i could hear what sounded to be, as an old man
severly</b>
<br><b>coughing. This went on every night and after a couple of weeks i
finely</b>
<br><b>decided to go to the apt. under us to see if i could be of some
help for the</b>
<br><b>poor old guy. He was obviously in dire straits. Well, to my surprise,
when i</b>
<br><b>knocked on the door, a young man answered. I then proceeded to ask
if his</b>
<br><b>Dad or Granddad was okay? He gave me this puzzled look and informed
me that</b>
<br><b>only his wife and small baby lived there with him. I told him as
was sorry</b>
<br><b>to have bothered him and left, wondering whether i was going nuts
or what!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I finally mentioned this to my brother
and he looked at me and</b>
<br><b>said"you, too!" That's when things really started getting interesting!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few weeks later, i had pulled
out the sofabed and was nodding off</b>
<br><b>to sleep after a short while. I had the covers pulled up to my neck
with</b>
<br><b>both hands holding them, when suddenly they were yanked halfway
off the bed!</b>
<br><b>Needless to say i was startled! I jumped up, turned on the light
and there</b>
<br><b>was nothing there! I walked down to my brothers room and as i stepped</b>
<br><b>inside, it was ice cold! I woke him and told him what had just happened
and</b>
<br><b>he informed me that when i woke him he was dreaming that something
was after</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As i was leaving his</b>
<br><b>room, starting down the hallway (with light still on in the livingroom
area)</b>
<br><b>I saw in the center of the hall what was a round dark shadow that
got darker</b>
<br><b>towards the center of itself, but you could see right through it!
I went</b>
<br><b>back into my brothers room and told him what i saw, he got up and
when we</b>
<br><b>got back to the hall, it was gone! I was off work the next day and
was</b>
<br><b>watching the idiot box when i heard rustling noises coming from
the back</b>
<br><b>room. I went to investigate and again, the room was cold! I noticed
that the</b>
<br><b>curtains were moving and checked to see if the window was open.
It was shut</b>
<br><b>tight! So i put my hand up to the air duct and no air was coming
out! I said</b>
<br><b>to myself, f... this! I'm moving!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got with Ron, my brother,
that night and we both agreed that it</b>
<br><b>was a good idea. We found another apt. comepletely on the other
side of</b>
<br><b>town!&nbsp; We had the power transferred to the new apt. and the
power to ghost</b>
<br><b>central was cut off, so that we had to use candles while moving,
for light.</b>
<br><b>I had to work that night, so Ron had to do the bulk of the moving
himself.</b>
<br><b>We had most of it boxed up and i was off to work!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Let me say</b>
<br><b>this now...Ron is one big guy and there's not much that scares him....but</b>
<br><b>that night, he came screaming up to my place of work and i ran up,
because</b>
<br><b>something was obviously wrong!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When i looked in the van</b>
<br><b>at him, he was white as a, well, you know. His eyes where bloodshot
and he</b>
<br><b>was scare s...less.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I asked him what happened and</b>
<br><b>he told me that all the candles where lit as he was moving some
of the final</b>
<br><b>boxes. He went to his bedroom to get one out of there, and as before,
the</b>
<br><b>room was very cold! He picked the box up and as he left the room,
the candle</b>
<br><b>went out! As he went by the bathroom, that candle went out! As did
the</b>
<br><b>kithcen as he passed. There in the living room he saw the same round
shadow</b>
<br><b>in mid air as i had. He kind of slid around it and was out the front
door,</b>
<br><b>put down the box to grab his keys to lock the door. When he turned
to the</b>
<br><b>door, it slammed in his face and the deadbolt locked itself! He
grabbed the</b>
<br><b>doorknob and he said it was as if someone had sprayed freon on it!
Needless</b>
<br><b>to say, we never went back and we left stuff there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That very night we stopped at a Country
Kitchen and we were trying to</b>
<br><b>figure out what in the world was this thing and why was it pissed
at us?</b>
<br><b>After lengthy conversation Ron told me about his exwife whom he
had stole</b>
<br><b>from some guy in his late 50s. She had lived in that apt. with Ron
and thats</b>
<br><b>the last address that that guy had for her. The man had died if
throat</b>
<br><b>cancer earlier that month.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Do you think</b>
<br><b>it could have been him looking for her or trying to get even with
Ron?</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I know for the next two</b>
<br><b>months looking for that thing to show up at our new residence, but

<br><b>never did.</b><b></b>

<br><b>"How many?"</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: TrumpSwordz@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've read your page entitled "Ghosts That Follow",
and it has convinced</b>
<br><b>me that of which I only questioned before is true. I've always had
an</b>
<br><b>interest in the paranormal, and am pleased to say I myself have
expirienced</b>
<br><b>it as well. When I was small, maybe around seven, I had my only
visual</b>
<br><b>expirience to date, and it seemed to be the gateway for all the
rest. One</b>
<br><b>night I was sitting on the couch in the living room of my old house,
watching</b>
<br><b>television, when suddenly I became very cold. Using seven-year-old
logic, I</b>
<br><b>got up to turn on a light, thinking it would heat up the room. Well,
as I</b>
<br><b>reached for the lamp's switch, I glanced over into the den/doorway
area, and</b>
<br><b>saw a woman, bending over, staring at herself in the mirror. She
had a pale</b>
<br><b>blue tint to her...and her hair seemed to be pulled back. She was
pretty</b>
<br><b>clear, but the passage of time has dimmed my recollection. She may
have been</b>
<br><b>putting on make-up...I'm not sure. She was holding something, and
it seemed</b>
<br><b>like she brought her hand to her face. Well, it was at that time
my mother</b>
<br><b>stepped into the house from the garage door (on the other side of
the house),</b>
<br><b>and called for me. I looked in the direction she yelled from, then
looked</b>
<br><b>back, and the woman was gone. I told her about it. To this day,
she believes</b>
<br><b>that I did see something, but I'm not sure she's convinced it was
real.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, a cross-state move and a couple years later,
I began to expirience</b>
<br><b>poltergeist-like activity. We used to have these two very heavy
lawnchairs in</b>
<br><b>our backyard (which was fenced in, by the way). And, for a period
of about</b>
<br><b>two months, four or five times a week we'd awake to find them both
pushed way</b>
<br><b>back across the yard, up against the fence, still upright. Obviously,
there</b>
<br><b>could be natural explanations, like the wind or my dog. But, my
dog isn't</b>
<br><b>strong enough to push them that far, and the wind wouldn't keep
them upright.</b>
<br><b>Besides, if it was the wind, then it would have to come over our
house, down,</b>
<br><b>and then still have enough strength to push those heavy chairs all
the way</b>
<br><b>across our backyard. I took notice of this, got a book about ghosts,
and</b>
<br><b>conducted one of its tests (taping paper beneath furniture legs,
and seeing</b>
<br><b>if they move). Unfortunatly, the activity stopped before I could
get any</b>
<br><b>results.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, we moved, though only across town. This
is where I currently live.</b>
<br><b>I'm now fourteen, and things are still going on. I can remember
one weekend</b>
<br><b>day (Saturday or Sunday), I was home alone for the entire day, and
began to</b>
<br><b>hear strange noises, like people mumbling, and coming up the stairs.
Needless</b>
<br><b>to say, I was terrified. I eventually just got on the phone with
someone</b>
<br><b>until my parents got home.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three-quarters of a year later (about January),
my mom dropped me off at</b>
<br><b>home after choir practice, only to find a gigantic tree slumped
over the</b>
<br><b>mouth of our driveway (we live in a woodsy neighborhood). We had
had storms,</b>
<br><b>so nothing too strange. She dropped me off and left to go run some
errands,</b>
<br><b>so I made my way through the tree until I got up the driveway and
into the</b>
<br><b>house. Unfortunatly, the power was off and the phones were dead.
Not too</b>
<br><b>weird, but still a bit spooky. Well...getting to the point. I walked
into the</b>
<br><b>kitchen after about twenty minutes of being home, and opened the
door. The</b>
<br><b>power was still off. Then, I said aloud, "I'm hungry, I wish the
power would</b>
<br><b>come back on...". And..yeah...you guessed it, a loud whir, and the
fridge</b>
<br><b>lights flashed, and the power came back on. I freaked out, and grabbed
a</b>
<br><b>phone, currently forgetting they were out. Well, they had started
working</b>
<br><b>again! I called up my friend and told her and her mom about it.
Needless to</b>
<br><b>say, I sat in a corner staring at all possible doorways in view
until my mom</b>
<br><b>got home.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, a few weeks ago, my dad got home around
three in the morning (he</b>
<br><b>works the nightshift) and found the water in my bathroom faucet
turned on</b>
<br><b>almost full blast, and the sink was very close to spilling over.
I was blamed</b>
<br><b>for leaving it on when I went to bed. But there's two reasons why
that isn't</b>
<br><b>true. First of all, I know I didn't. I'm forgetfull, but I've always</b>
<br><b>remembered to turn the water of. Secondly, I tested this, if the
water was on</b>
<br><b>as high powered as he said it was, it could only have been on maybe
ten or</b>
<br><b>fifteen minutes before he walked in...while my mother and I were
asleep.</b>
<br><b>Nobody could have turned the water on.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, those are the expiriences I've had to date.
I currently run some</b>
<br><b>small-scale investigations with a friend of mine, using EMF detectors
and</b>
<br><b>such. So far, I've had nothing, but...you never know. Thanks for
reading my</b>
<br><b>story, and keep up the good work, your site is an inspiration!!</b><b></b>

<br><b>Killer Car</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sallyport@iwon.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have really enjoyed reading all of your 2500 stories.&nbsp; Some
I have</b>
<br><b>read twice, whenever I have finished the last new month's.&nbsp;
Now I felt</b>
<br><b>it was my turn to summit one to share with your readers.</b>
<br><b>Our gardener told me this story a week after it happened.&nbsp;
It happened</b>
<br><b>during the first week of December 1999 in the San Fernando Valley
of Los</b>
<br><b>Angeles.&nbsp; It is not a ghost story exactly, but it is a strange
tale of</b>
<br><b>actual events.&nbsp; The gardener's young son-in-law was involved
in a car</b>
<br><b>highjacking.&nbsp; The fellow was hard working, and he and his young
wife</b>
<br><b>were expecting their first baby.&nbsp; Things couldn't be any better
for</b>
<br><b>them.&nbsp; They had just moved out on their own a month earlier
and had set</b>
<br><b>up their apartment with new furniture.&nbsp; His job was secure
and his boss</b>
<br><b>allowed him to work extra hours.</b>
<br><b>He had asked his father-in-law to take him to a used car dealership
to</b>
<br><b>purchase a car.&nbsp; When they arrived at the sales lot he spotted
the</b>
<br><b>perfect car, a very hot sporty model - the type most young men his
age</b>
<br><b>enjoy driving and showing off.&nbsp; His father-in-law had reservations
and</b>
<br><b>felt the car was not right ... he felt the car would attract attention</b>
<br><b>and envy.&nbsp; The gardener&nbsp; also had a premonition that something
would</b>
<br><b>happen to&nbsp; him in this car.&nbsp; He urged him to make another
selection, but</b>
<br><b>the young man would not hear of it.&nbsp; He was stuck on this car
and the</b>
<br><b>price was right.&nbsp; When they went to make the purchase the dealer</b>
<br><b>informed them that the car's previous owner had been killed during
a</b>
<br><b>highjacking inside the car. This frightened the gardener, on the
other</b>
<br><b>hand, his son-in-law had no problems with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; He couldn't
change the</b>
<br><b>kid's mind.&nbsp; They took the car home.</b>
<br><b>It was not unusual after working extra hours to earn money for the
baby</b>
<br><b>that the son-in-law would get home late.&nbsp; One late evening
in December</b>
<br><b>when he got home he was not at all interested in the dinner the</b>
<br><b>gardener's daughter had prepared.&nbsp; He decided to drive to the
market to</b>
<br><b>get something else.&nbsp; The first market he went to did not have
the</b>
<br><b>special dish he had his heart set on, so he decided to go to another</b>
<br><b>market further away.&nbsp; When he arrived at the second market
the parking</b>
<br><b>lot was full and he had to park on the street.&nbsp; As he was about
to exit</b>
<br><b>his car two men approached him.&nbsp; One guy was pointing a gun
at him.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>is believed that he gave his car keys to the highjackers, however,
he</b>
<br><b>attempted to retrieve his cell phone from the glove compartment
when he</b>
<br><b>was shot dead inside the car.&nbsp; This was according to one eye
witness.</b><b></b>
<p><b>When the story was told to me the gardener still had the car which
he</b>
<br><b>was planning to return to the dealer.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: gage@cayuga-cc.edu</b><b></b>
<p><b>When my son was 12 we experienced some seemingly ghostly phenomenon.&nbsp;
Your</b>
<br><b>explanation of poltergeists, however, may account for the bizarre</b>
<br><b>happenings, as he was a preteen at the time of the occurrences.&nbsp;
Every</b>
<br><b>Monday night at around 1:12 a.m., his alarm clock would go off,
even though</b>
<br><b>it was set for 6:30 a.m.&nbsp; I bought my son a new clock, but
no matter -- the</b>
<br><b>same thing would occur.&nbsp; There were other occurrences -- the
TV picture</b>
<br><b>could be shut off with the power switch, but not the sound.&nbsp;
We also heard</b>
<br><b>bb's drop and roll across the floor in the middle of the night.&nbsp;
Unsettling</b>
<br><b>stuff!</b>
<br><b>We no longer live in that house (a side-by-side duplex), my son
is now 21,</b>
<br><b>and our lives are relatively peaceful!&nbsp; We haven't experienced
anything like</b>

<br><b>Memorial Day</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: BLUeyedBRITT@cs.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When I was a sophomore in high school, my best friend Michelle and
I went to</b>
<br><b>a cabin on Lake Hartwell in SC that had belonged to her family for
some time.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I think it may have been either Memorial Day or Labor Day.&nbsp;
I always get</b>
<br><b>that confused.&nbsp; Anyway, we got through the night fine and everything
and the</b>
<br><b>next morning I walked into the kitchen for something to drink.&nbsp;
I believe</b>
<br><b>Michelle may have been in the shower but there is this window that
faced the</b>
<br><b>boat dock down at the lake.&nbsp; I happen to glance out the window
and noticed an</b>
<br><b>old woman down at the docks.&nbsp; She was as clear as you and me
and I thought</b>
<br><b>really nothing of it because other cabins also have access to the
docks.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>was early and all her hair was down and she had on what looked like
a white</b>
<br><b>gown, so I just assumed that she was just out for some air or a
short walk by</b>
<br><b>the lake.&nbsp; I went into the living room and saw a bunch of photo
albums on a</b>
<br><b>shelf.&nbsp; I flipped through one then picked up a second.&nbsp;
By this time,</b>
<br><b>Michelle had gotten out of the shower and walked into the kitchen.&nbsp;
I flipped</b>
<br><b>through a couple of pages and one picture kinda confused me.&nbsp;
It was the old</b>
<br><b>lady I saw down at the docks.&nbsp; I called for Michelle and showed
her the</b>
<br><b>picture.&nbsp; She said it was a picture of her grandmother who
died over 10 years</b>
<br><b>ago.&nbsp; I turned out that the cabin belonged to her grandparents
and her</b>
<br><b>grandmother had a stroke one morning by the docks and died.&nbsp;
She wasn't</b>
<br><b>surprised when I told her what I saw and simply told me it wasn't
the first</b>
<br><b>time.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Passages</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tymole@home.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello.I myself have had many experiences with ghost. Most have happened
when I was younger. My grandmother and&nbsp; grandfather lived down the
road from my parents in an old farm house. When my grandparents bought
the house, my grandmothers grandma swears she saw a dark hooded figure
at the top of the steps. This had to be early 1940's. My greatgrandmother
would never let the children go to the bathroom upstairs alone,she would
always accompany us. I never thought anything of this until I was older.
One day in the house (I was about 10) mygrandmother asked me to get a tablecloth
from a cupboard upstairs.(my greatgrandmother had passed by this time)
Upon opening the closet door I felt a cold go straight thru my body and
exit behind me. Needless to say I didn't get the tablecloth and still will
not open the door. I didn't see anything at the time but have felt and
smelled many other things and occurances in my life. I am only 34 and hope
to continue this journey into "feeling things" and "just knowing" the messages
that are being&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conveyed thru many different "passages"
of life. It's really very fun and a puzzle to figure out just what the
present message is. I get alot from dreams. One time my grandfather came
to me in a dream, and another instance my husbands grandmother floated
over our bed when we were recently married. (now 11 years later). Well
I've bored you enough. Than you for your time.</b><b></b>

<p><b>My mother passed away in October of 1996 after having battled with
her</b>
<br><b>colon cancer for more than two years.&nbsp; I saw her three days
prior to her</b>

<br><b>to be comforted.&nbsp; It seemed the more the time went by, the
more I missed</b>
<br><b>her.&nbsp; Anyways, one night she came to see me in a dream.&nbsp;
Now this was no</b>
<br><b>ordinary dream.&nbsp; It was one of those dreams in which the deceased</b>
<br><b>communicate with the living.&nbsp; There is a big difference between
a dream</b>
<br><b>such as this one and an ordinary dream!&nbsp; Remember that I was
very sad.</b>
<br><b>In the dream, my mother appeared to me in white.&nbsp; She had a
long white</b>
<br><b>robe on and looked like an angel.&nbsp; She told me, and it was
her voice, &laquo;</b>
<br><b>Oh Caroline! Heaven is such a beautiful place!&nbsp; I just wanted
you to</b>
<br><b>know that Heaven is such a beautiful place and how happy I am here!

<p><b>One summer, during the 1980s, I decided to take some math courses.&nbsp;

<br><b>I was not very good at maths and was staying up extremely late to
do my</b>
<br><b>homework and trying to understand what I was being taught in class.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>really wasnt getting enough sleep.&nbsp; I would sleep some five
hours each</b>
<br><b>night and was extremely exhausted.&nbsp; One night, while I was
returning</b>
<br><b>home (I took the subway) I arrived at my subway station and, as
usual,</b>
<br><b>was climbing the stairs when suddenly I lost my balance.&nbsp; I
tripped over</b>
<br><b>the stair and went flying in the air.&nbsp; Now normally I would
have fallen</b>
<br><b>on my face in the stairs and would have probably hurt myself really</b>
<br><b>badly.&nbsp; But no!&nbsp; I was protected!&nbsp; As I was flying
in the air and about</b>
<br><b>to fall on my face, I felt as if somebody replaced me in a straight</b>
<br><b>position unto the step.&nbsp; Yes, I was gently placed back on the
step!&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>remember feeling so surprised!&nbsp; I was just standing there,
on that step,</b>
<br><b>and just being amazed at what had happened to me.&nbsp; I knew and

<p><b>Haunted Drugstore?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: fboily@sympatico.ca</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I was working as a cashier in a drugstore in downtown Montreal at
the</b>
<br><b>time.&nbsp; It must have been around 1997.&nbsp; Some very strange
things happened</b>
<br><b>at this drugstore while I was working there.&nbsp; The first strange
event</b>
<br><b>that happened was during the Halloween Season.&nbsp; A little further
from my</b>
<br><b>counter were shelves on which were Halloween decorations.&nbsp;
Besides those</b>
<br><b>shelves was a table on which were small-sized Pringles chips cans.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>was serving a client.&nbsp; Suddenly, one of the Pringles chips
cans popped</b>
<br><b>right up by itself unto the floor.&nbsp; I mean, it just popped
up with a &laquo;</b>
<br><b>pop &raquo; sound, and when it popped up, it went quite high in
the air, then</b>
<br><b>it fell straight down unto the floor, just like that.&nbsp; The
client I was</b>
<br><b>serving couldnt believe her eyes!&nbsp; She exclaimed &laquo; Oh
my God!&nbsp; It just</b>
<br><b>popped up by itself!&nbsp; Could it be because of the Halloween
decorations?</b>
<br><b>Is there something weird in these? &raquo;&nbsp; Another event happened
on a</b>
<br><b>Saturday morning.&nbsp; It was very quiet on Saturday mornings at
the</b>
<br><b>drugstore.&nbsp; When that happened I was the only one in the drugstore
with</b>
<br><b>the pharmacist.&nbsp; On some shelves that were not very far from
me, there</b>
<br><b>were individually wrapped pens.&nbsp; They were all lying flat on
the</b>
<br><b>shelves.&nbsp; Suddenly one of them flew right off the shelf!&nbsp;
It flew,</b>
<br><b>twisted and fell on the floor!&nbsp; What a surprise I had when
this</b>
<br><b>happened!&nbsp; I tell you, I thought I was dreaming or something!&nbsp;
Another</b>
<br><b>time the paper towels went flying off the shelves.&nbsp; They were
literally</b>
<br><b>thrown on the floor, as if somebody had pushed them.&nbsp; The guy
who placed</b>
<br><b>them on the shelves had experience and had done the job very well.&nbsp;
He</b>
<br><b>couldnt understand why they had fallen off the shelf.&nbsp; Like
I said,</b>
<br><b>they didnt fall off the shelf, they were pushed with a great force.</b>
<br><b>Same thing happened with the ladies sanitary napkins.&nbsp; They
were pushed</b>
<br><b>off the shelves; at times it could be only one package that went
flying</b>
<br><b>then another and so on.&nbsp; One day an employee told me that she
saw a</b>
<br><b>bottle falling off by itself from a shelf in the backstore.&nbsp;
Indeed this</b>
<br><b>drugstore was very strange and seemed to be haunted by some prankster</b>
<br><b>ghost</b>

<p><b>GLORIA SWANSON</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: KNP971@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, the reason I am writing is because you sound like a person truly
interested in this field.My story will probably not be the most facinating
one you have ever heard nor a terrifying poltergeist experience,instead
it is a touching one to a certain degree. It concerns the late silver screen
star Gloria Swanson.She was probably best known for her film Sunset Blvd.
It all started several months ago when I was looking at her photographs
on the internet at my home.Just to let you know, she never lived in this
place at any time,we never met,I dont know her friends or recived any mail
from her. I have been a fan of hers for about a year in a half now,fell
in love after first seeing sunset blvd.Yes although I am a huge fan,I swear
this is not wishful thinking,not a dream. I can honestly say that I would
not waste your time with falsifications,there would be no point. Simply,
I have made contact with a spirit who claims she is Gloria Swanson. Although
I have not seen a full spectrum ghost, I have felt and heard many things.When
I first took a look at those pictures on the internet late one night,I
felt as though i was being watched. A very warm hand toucbed my shoulder.A
voice whisphed my name,it said "things are not the way they used to be."
and "films,the films."(she sighed) As I write this I can feel her watching,giggling
at the situation.She is telling that I have a chance to write,just as she
did.She is reminding me of the work that went behind her 500 page autobiography.She
is in a very friendly,curious and sweet mood now,shes smiling very brightly.Sorry,
guess Im going off course here. Moving on,she was rather silent for a while
until this one day.While lying in the dark I heard(aloud) this beautiful
voice humming at first and then singing.Supposedly she was quite a singer
as well.She said little tidbits here and there. However when I asked her
"why me?" she vanished.A while later however she told me that my answers
are in her drawers,the ones she kept in her bedroom in the last apartment
she had in New York.she died at age 84.I have a picture of that room,those
drawers.Last month she told me,finally gave me a short answer. She simply
said " You are beautiful,very precious"</b>
<br><b>In your experience is it common for these sprits to speak in riddles?
If so do you know why? why would a well known spirit take interest in someone
they never knew in any way, shape or form? I can feel her hands on my shoulder
as we speak. Its as though she wants come in and speak through me again.
It feels as though all of these hands are trying to stretch out of my chest.I
feel the most beautiful presence-relaxed.Nothing is being said.Usually,
she will end up humming,grasping my shoulders,play with the radio,playfully
tickle my feet or leading me to certain pages in her book or books about
her- the silent movies. In order to get my attention she often toses things
or makes the curtains shake. She also writes to me often, guides my hand.
In my mind if I ask her about how shes feeling she will tell me to open
a book to a certain page.Sure enough it always pertains.She tells me that
there are certain songs on the radio that make her think of us. In my dream
she said "I will never leave you,dont worry.Im here to watch over and protect
you!" and "You will in time figure out the riddle" She then told me that
she loves me and left.I havent had that dream since. I apologize for such
a long letter,promise I will wrap it up very soon,end it with something
remarkable. On the morning of her passing,actually the anniversary of it,she
came to me.She showed me her passing. I felt exactly what she did that
morning. The sights,noises andemotions. It was the most heart wrenching
and yet beautiful experience I have ever come across. I wish I could explain
it in words,but its humanly impossible. How do you thank someone for showing
their soul? I pressume I will learn in time. My life will never be the
same,nor will my heart and soul. Thank you once again for your time and
patience!! It feels wonderful knowing their is someone out there who truly
believes. Any advice would be deeply appreciated.Please do not place this
story on the internet,I feel it too personal at this point.I know in my
heart she would want it that way.</b>

<br><b>christian and believe that God can perform any miracle. After the
baby</b>
<br><b>came home, everything seemed to revolve around her. She had her
days and</b>
<br><b>nights mixed up just like any baby. After a few weeks she would
sleep</b>
<br><b>about 5 hours at a time. I was on maternity leave and my husband</b>
<br><b>returned to work after staying at home with the baby and me. I wanted</b>
<br><b>him to sleep in the guest bedroom at night so he could get a full
nights</b>
<br><b>rest. On the weekends, we would sleep in the same room with me because</b>
<br><b>he would get up with the baby if she was hungry. After a month,
the</b>
<br><b>baby's sleep schedule because easier and everyone seemed to be getting</b>
<br><b>more sleep. One night while lying in bed, I heard the baby cry.
I</b>
<br><b>usually let her cry three times before going to her. I let her cry</b>
<br><b>again. About 5 minutes later, I heard her cry again. I rose to my
feet</b>
<br><b>and stood at the end of my bed while putting my robe on, when I
heard</b>
<br><b>the following, "Shhh, Shhh, Just Go Back To Sleep" The voice was
a male</b>
<br><b>voice, soothing and soft, just like my husbands. I though, how nice
of</b>
<br><b>my husband to take care of the baby on a week night. I heard the
baby</b>
<br><b>cry again. I started to walk down the hall into the baby's room,
when I</b>
<br><b>heard my husband snoring up a storm in the guest bedroom. I immediately</b>
<br><b>ran to her crib, thinking there was a kidnapper in the house. She
was</b>
<br><b>cooing at me when I picked her up. I believe that what I heard was
my</b>
<br><b>daughters guardian angel protecting and calming her.</b><b></b>

<br><b>came in and I was introduced to this lady who was real nice. After
that we were</b>
<br><b>invited to her bedroom because she was going to give my mother some
clothing</b>
<br><b>out of her dresser. As she was opening the drawers I was amazed
of what I saw,</b>
<br><b>a human skull. I asked her, Who is that? Why do you have that in
your closet?</b>
<br><b>She said, it was my husbands head that was the only piece they found
of him.</b>
<br><b>I was startled and then I was told to go to the living room. I came
in and saw a</b>
<br><b>real nice basket of fruit, Then I turned around and their was a
full skeleton looking</b>
<br><b>at me. I started screaming, As a result of this episode it began
my journey into the pararnormal.</b>

<br><b>Haunted Campgrounds</b><b></b>

<p><b>I would like to share with you, my last camping trip at one of my
favorite MO</b>
<br><b>State camp ground. My faithful dog and i had just finished dinner
and clean</b>
<br><b>up when a storm moved in, forcing us inside the pop-up camper for
the night.</b>
<br><b>The storm was typical for this state, high winds, hard sudden rains,</b>
<br><b>lighting,tunder and hail.&nbsp; My now wet and dedicated watch dog
was trimbling</b>
<br><b>as close to me as possible.&nbsp; She started growling softly as
the locked camper</b>
<br><b>door flew open.( now the dog is cowering in the bottem of MY sleeping
bag) I</b>
<br><b>froze in fear as i felt the camper rock with a weight of a person
stepping</b>
<br><b>into the camper, it was so dark all i could see was the strobe effects
of the</b>
<br><b>lighting, and standing in the entrance of my camper was a very large
indian</b>
<br><b>brave with his arms crossed just looking at me. I was so scared
i couldnt</b>
<br><b>move, than as quickly as the fear came,it supsided, its as if i
knew he wasnt</b>
<br><b>there to hurt me. I woke the next morning to sunshine and birds
singing,</b>
<br><b>thinking to myself, that was one weird dream i had last night. I
set up in</b>
<br><b>bed and saw the camper door standing wide open, so i got up and
look at the</b>
<br><b>door and the slide bolt was bent from being jerked open. I packed
my stuff</b>
<br><b>and my wet brave dog and went home. Did i forget to tell you, this
camp</b>
<br><b>ground sets next to indian mounds.&nbsp;&nbsp; Happy Camping, and

<br><b>More than a Local Urban Legend</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Cyclops10380@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is about actual apparitions that my friends and I have seen.
There is</b>
<br><b>this old house in the city we live in here in cali where we would
go for fun</b>
<br><b>to see if it was really haunted and on many occasions we didn't
see much. We</b>
<br><b>were just told it was. One night we decided to go again, we were
bored and</b>
<br><b>there is nothing to do here&nbsp; anyways. We stopped in front of
the house for a</b>
<br><b>couple of minutes when all of a sudden we see a woman in red dress
hanging</b>
<br><b>from the big tree in the front yard, it wasn't there when we arrived
and then</b>
<br><b>in the window there was a person who looked to be missing his arm
and looking</b>
<br><b>kind of blue. Well we decided not to stay longer and hauled major
butt outta</b>
<br><b>there. That was like 3 years ago, I went back again with another
friend and</b>
<br><b>that's when we told me what she said was an urban legend. The story
goes that</b>
<br><b>the man who first lived there went crazy and killed his family.
He hung his</b>
<br><b>wife from the tree, he hacked up his son with and axe and drowned
his</b>
<br><b>daughter in fountain. And they say they still see the man waking
up and down</b>
<br><b>the road holding the bloody axe. Well we haven't seen him but what
we saw</b>
<br><b>makes this more than just an urban legend, we all agree and what
we saw.</b>

<br><b>True Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: morelandr.98@bhbs.hereford.sch.uk</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have lived in the country
all my life, I was born in a village and</b>
<br><b>the only time I am in a town is when I am shopping or on holiday.
I live in</b>
<br><b>a four bedroom detached cottage in a small village just outside
Hereford. I</b>
<br><b>thought that there was nothing strange or even unusual about where
I lived.</b>
<br><b>I must admit I was initially quite skeptical about the existence
of ghosts,</b>
<br><b>phantoms, demons and all the rest of them. Until we did up the house
and I</b>
<br><b>moved into my new bedroom. I was the first person to sleep in there
for</b>
<br><b>three years and I was looking forward to the challenge of redecorating
it.</b>
<br><b>But I didn't expect on sharing my room with anyone else. Then, during
my</b>
<br><b>first night in my new room I heared a scraping on my cupboard door.
I chose</b>
<br><b>to ignore it. But over the weeks the scraping got louder and louder
and soon</b>
<br><b>I heard bangs rather than scrapes. The first couple of times it
made me</b>
<br><b>jump. Then on the third occasion I got up and walked over to the
cupboard</b>
<br><b>and inspected it thoroughly. I noticed that there was a small crack
that was</b>
<br><b>not there when I went to bed. After several more days I noticed
that objects</b>
<br><b>where being moved from the time I was going to bed, to the time
that I was</b>
<br><b>waking up. So I told someone about it. About a week later I went
on a field</b>
<br><b>trip to Belgium and my sister slept in my room. She was complaining
of bangs</b>
<br><b>and scratches and how my nephews cot kept moving. She was also complaining</b>
<br><b>because he woke up many times during the night crying. I knew then
that</b>
<br><b>something fishey was going on in there, but I still couldn't fathom
out</b>
<br><b>what. So when I was in the school library I took out as many books
as</b>
<br><b>possible on the paranormal. I have linked these strange occurvances
to a</b>
<br><b>form of ghost called a POLTERGEIST or a form of mischievous spirit
that</b>
<br><b>throws objects around a room. Though I am still wondering what happened
in</b>
<br><b>my room to cause this spirit to be so restless. Could it be because
I moved</b>
<br><b>in to the room and my redecorating angered him to come out and start</b>
<br><b>haunting the room, or is it more deep rooted than that.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Fathers Visit?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: msbig@nac.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My father had cancer and was at his home with my mother during the
last</b>
<br><b>stages of his life.&nbsp; Every day my two sisters, my brother,
our</b>
<br><b>respective husbands and wives and my mom and I would sit with him.&nbsp;
He</b>
<br><b>was always in and out and you never knew when he would wake and
talk to</b>
<br><b>you.&nbsp; He smiled alot when he was not conscious and talked to
his mom.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>love my dad very much and told him often.&nbsp; I made him promise
me he</b>
<br><b>would not me leave unless he told me good-bye.&nbsp; I was sleeping
in my own</b>
<br><b>home next to my husband one evening.&nbsp; At about 2:00 am I was
woken up by</b>
<br><b>this large glowing light over my bed, it just floated in the air
and I</b>
<br><b>knew it was my father coming to say good-bye.&nbsp; I woke my husband
up</b>
<br><b>pointing toward the ceiling trying to explain what I had just seen.&nbsp;
He</b>
<br><b>did not see anything.&nbsp; I never went back to sleep I just laid
there</b>
<br><b>until about 4:00 am at which time I got up, showered, dressed and</b>
<br><b>waiting until about 6:00 to call my mother.&nbsp; I asked her how
he was and</b>
<br><b>he was the same and I told my mom that I knew he was going to pass</b>
<br><b>today.&nbsp; My sister, my mother and I were the only ones there
when he</b>
<br><b>passed away.&nbsp; We were sitting in the kitchen and he in the
bedroom</b>
<br><b>adjacent.&nbsp; We would check on him often and during one of our
checks, he</b>
<br><b>passed away.</b>
<br><b>I was divorced about 5 years later.&nbsp; My children and I moved
to a home</b>
<br><b>about 10 miles south of where we lived, in a pretty rural area.&nbsp;
There</b>
<br><b>are no street lights outside so when it is dark, it is dark outside.</b>
<br><b>One evening I was standing in my living room, the room has double</b>
<br><b>sliding glass doors and adjoins a front eating area with windows
all the</b>
<br><b>way around, I had not hung any curtains yet.&nbsp; The house has
a deck that</b>
<br><b>wraps around these windows with stairs going down.&nbsp; As I was
standing in</b>
<br><b>the living room I saw a man walking across the deck toward the front</b>
<br><b>door, I ran to the front door and opened it and no one was there.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>believe the man was my father.&nbsp; He was dressed in a light brown
jacket</b>
<br><b>and golfers cap which my dad wore quite often.&nbsp; I called the
kids but</b>
<br><b>neither of them saw anything.&nbsp; I saw this figure walk accross
the deck</b>
<br><b>only one other time after this with the same ending, no one there.</b>
<br><b>Recently my youngest son moved downstairs and took over the TV room
as</b>
<br><b>his bedroom.&nbsp;&nbsp; My bedroom is directly above his, I often
hear noises in</b>
<br><b>the corner of my room.&nbsp; This corner has a vanity that I purchased
from</b>
<br><b>an antique store.&nbsp; I know nothing of it's history.&nbsp; There
is nothing</b>
<br><b>there but the vanity, no pipes in the walls, no heating ducts, nothing</b>
<br><b>but a noise.&nbsp; One day I was telling my son about the noise
and he said</b>
<br><b>he hears "stuff" all the time and sometimes it scares him.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I told him</b>
<br><b>it was probably the furnace in the basement that he hears thru the
walls</b>
<br><b>but he insisted that it was above his head which as it turns out
is</b>
<br><b>directly under the corner of my room where the noises come from.</b>
<br><b>Last week I was in bed and my son was in the shower.&nbsp; No one
was up.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>said when he got out of the shower and went to walk thru the living
room</b>
<br><b>the TV was on.&nbsp; There was no channel on the TV it was on zero.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>screen was just white and black fuzzy stuff moving back and forth.&nbsp;
He</b>
<br><b>turned it off and went downstairs.&nbsp; The other evening my son
and I were</b>
<br><b>in the kitchen having a lengthy conversation.&nbsp; The kitchen
is L shaped</b>
<br><b>and has a doorway in the living room and one in the front room.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>standing in the doorway to the front room and he was sitting on
the</b>
<br><b>counter.&nbsp; There was a light on in the living room and nothing
else.</b>
<br><b>When we were done talking we walked together into the living room
and</b>
<br><b>the TV was on again.&nbsp; Same channel and same black and white
pattern.</b>
<br><b>There is no reason for the TV to ever be on that channel, even if
you</b>
<br><b>were using the vcr it would be on channel 4.&nbsp; We just looked
at each</b>
<br><b>other.&nbsp; I called to my boyfriend who was in bed and he thought
there was</b>
<br><b>some logical explanation for it but I know there is nothing logical.</b>
<br><b>My other son has not seen or heard anything.&nbsp; My boyfriend
has heard</b>
<br><b>noises in the bedroom but most of the time they happen so fast that
you</b>
<br><b>are not sure if you've actually heard anything.&nbsp; But, when
you hear the</b>
<br><b>same noise on several different occasions you know it is "the noise".</b>

<p><b>Doberman pinchers &amp; horses</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: rpeel@siumed.edu</b><b></b>
<p><b>This incident happened around 1977 when I was 12 years old. I never</b>
<br><b>thought about it being a ghost story until I read a number of the</b>
<br><b>experiences on this site that were about ghosts of animals. It happened</b>
<br><b>on a half day of school when I &amp; a friend decided to take a
couple of</b>
<br><b>cap guns in which I had just bought a huge supply of cap roles for.
We</b>
<br><b>went to an old house that I &amp; another close friend (who used
to live in</b>
<br><b>that neighborhood) considered to be haunted, mainly because it was
an</b>
<br><b>old large house that had a spooky long driveway that was lined with</b>
<br><b>trees that overshadowed it so it was very dark no matter how sunny
it</b>
<br><b>was outside, &amp; lots of signs saying "keep out".</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;On this particular day it was cloudy &amp; eventually started
to rain.</b>
<br><b>Because of the rain we went into an old horse stall that was in
the</b>
<br><b>woods that surrounded the old house. The stall obviuosly had not
been</b>
<br><b>used for many years, obviuos because of all the weeds growing up
around</b>
<br><b>it &amp; it was very run down.We went into the stall to avoid the
rain &amp;</b>
<br><b>shot the cap guns for a couple of hours. After the rain let up we</b>
<br><b>decided to leave &amp; got to the edge of the woods at a cornfield
adjacent</b>
<br><b>to the house property. As soon as we got to the cornfield we were
met</b>
<br><b>with a strange sight, two horses with two doberman pinchers running</b>
<br><b>along side yet no sound, which I thought was odd. Freaked out mainly
by</b>
<br><b>the dobermans, we went back to the stall for a little while longer
&amp;</b>
<br><b>then tried to get back to our bicycles.</b>
<br><b>As we were heading back to my house I kept expecting to come across</b>
<br><b>someone looking for their horses and/or dogs but never saw anyone
at</b>
<br><b>all. I had played in that neighborhood alot when my good friend
lived</b>
<br><b>there &amp; could not remember anyone in the neighborhood owning
horses.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I always remember this incident because of how surreal it
was, but not</b>
<br><b>until reading stories on this site did I ever consider it to be
a ghost</b>
<br><b>story, but now I'm convinced that those dogs &amp; horses were in
fact</b>
<br><b>spirits.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Nothing Out of the Ordinary</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cheryl@mikrotec.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello!&nbsp; I am such a fan of your website!&nbsp; I must praise
you for the help you</b>
<br><b>offer people, and the information you unselfishly distribute, I
believe it</b>
<br><b>helps many.</b>
<br><b>I am only 15 years old, but these "paranormal" encounters have became
an</b>
<br><b>almost daily experience for me.&nbsp; And I have found that It is
more</b>
<br><b>spiritually involved than others make it out to be.</b>
<br><b>Although I have known most of my life that I have some sort of gift
in this</b>
<br><b>area, It was recently put before me by a Spiritual Advisor, who
is also now</b>
<br><b>a close friend of mine, that I am Clairaudient- meaning that I can
hear</b>
<br><b>things on "another level".&nbsp; I am Clairsenient-&nbsp; meaning
that I feel</b>
<br><b>presences almost like it is just the people around me...because
they are,</b>
<br><b>but just not seen like a human.&nbsp; And I have a rare gift that
excites me very</b>
<br><b>much- I am an empath.&nbsp; Meaning that I can feel not only what
"spirits" are</b>
<br><b>feeling but what others around me are feeling also.</b>
<br><b>Now that I have shared this, I would like to share my most recent</b>
<br><b>experience, because it is unlike any other that I have had.&nbsp;
Just last night</b>
<br><b>I was sleeping with my door closed in my room.&nbsp; I had my t.v.
on with the</b>
<br><b>volume turned all the way down so I could have the light just because
it</b>
<br><b>comforts me.&nbsp; The timer was set for 45 minutes because I thought
I would be</b>
<br><b>deep asleep by the time it went off.</b>
<br><b>I had just drifted off to sleep when "click!" the timer turned off
the t.v.</b>
<br><b>and my room went black.&nbsp; Not 15 seconds afterwards I heard
a faint</b>
<br><b>"growling" that&nbsp; made me jerk wide awake.</b>
<br><b>I lay stiff in my bed straining to hear.&nbsp; I didn't have to
strain too much</b>
<br><b>because the growling arose again, this time it sounded as if it
stood right</b>
<br><b>in my door way!</b>
<br><b>Like I said, I am used to these types of experiences so I went back
to sleep</b>
<br><b>without hearing the growl again.</b>
<br><b>I am skipping school today because my horse has had it's baby, a
beautiful</b>
<br><b>spotted Philly.&nbsp; And while we took shelter from the rain in
the barn, my mom</b>
<br><b>took over 20 pictures of the Philly and it's mother and we weren't
surprised</b>
<br><b>to see 4-5 pictures covered in orbs!&nbsp; We believe that the little
balls of</b>
<br><b>energy were showing us to celebrate the new life!</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ghostly Massage</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: christina.price@osan.af.mil</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was about 10 or 12 years old, it was summer time and the nights
were hot.</b>
<br><b>I was sleeping on my belly with the covers kicked down by my feet.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>remember feeling a cool soothing sensation grazing over and across
the skin</b>
<br><b>on my back.&nbsp; It felt sooo good, so soothing.&nbsp; Like a cool
massage, very</b>
<br><b>light feeling though.&nbsp; This went on for a few minutes until
I realized I was</b>
<br><b>being touched, I was alone in my room and this just wasn't "right"
so I</b>
<br><b>began to feel nervous and looked around to the side of my bed and
the</b>
<br><b>"massage" ceased and I saw 2 forms, more like blobs-low to the floor
scurry</b>
<br><b>a few feet away and disappeared.&nbsp; This happened twice more
on non</b>
<br><b>consecutive nights in the night and I was feeling a bit freaked
out!!!</b>
<br><b>Finally I just screamed for the things to go away and not touch
me !&nbsp; Get</b>
<br><b>out leave me alone-I screamed so much my mother in the next room
told me to</b>
<br><b>shut my mouth!!!&nbsp; So, I shut up pulled the blankets to my chin
